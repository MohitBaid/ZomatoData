Buffet didn't include a variety of options, be it for breakfast or lunch. Most of the chicken gravy preparations are similar.
Food was rather on the saltier side but well that depends on one's personal taste.
Personal Favorite would be the Kentucky Fried Chicken! One of the most unique looking dishes.

Taste: 3/5
Ambience: 3/5

This place is located at the ibiza resorts...
Amazing ambiance beautiful decor and the poolside view  makes the entire dining experience even more special.... üëçüèº
We have tried the weekend special lunch buffet and some of the breakfast üç≥ options and I have to admit each and every food item was delicious üòã... The buffet offers a wide range of both veg and no-veg cuisine 
Including one chicken üçó fish üêü and one Mutton üçñ dish 
The service was   exemplary... the staff is extremely well behaved and friendly...

I had been there quite a number of times.the food is good but the buffet spread during the weekend is excellent.They keep a good selection of salads.The number of items kept are worth the money they charge. Dessert was typically bengali with rajbhog and mishti doi to our surprise.Even their breakfast buffet is commendable.Great selection of fruits,salami,and juices...well the ambience is worth of each penny

Firstly let me tell you - the quality of food is sure excellent. Ppl are friendly. But how authentic the different cuisines taste is the matter in question. Don't take parcel from here coz the portions reduce considerably I have noticed. Rasmalai or their tuti fruti are the best desserts offered, just make sure Ras malai is fresh. Good food for a modest dinner after a swim at their pool. Ah yes! Their pool is a state of the art one... Also the cleanest in town which public can access. I ve not been to swimming club so let's leave that out from comparison. Hotel is also lovely, cottages are toooo good-spic n span, excellent service and world class! A lil pricey on the tariff but great stay! The location is their big minus-far away for us regular central kolkata dwellers.

Location: Ibiza, Merlin Greens, Amtala, South 24 Parganas
Pros: Very good ambience with pool-side view! Try the Indian Cuisines n I'm sure you'll traverse the whole Diamond Harbour Road only for these! The coolin' inside is really good too!
Cons: Mostly kept reserved for parties n all!
Don't leave the place without: Havin' Mutton Kasha
