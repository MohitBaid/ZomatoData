We went there for some evening snacks and found the bakery to be of reasonable price. We ordered a white chocolate pastry. The chocolate topping was really good and had a rich dairy flavoured, but I didn't like the whipped cream of the cake. It was tasteless. Average bakeries serve better pastries than Delice.

Discover unsafe and stale food at sky rocketing prices.

Recently a few of my seniors from my company were staying at Novotel, Calcutta. They had arranged for some cakes on a couple of days and on both the days the cakes tasted stale and reflected bad taste. Shocking to find such stuff at a five-star. Shameful.Â 

We discovered fungus on a dry fruit cake slice from the same place; refer to the picture attached. When the issue was raised, the authority was more keen about whether they should refund the entire amount or just the price of the infected slice.Â 

I am really glad that I have a "Nimai da'r Chaa er Dokaan" (Brother Nimai's Tea Shop / ThÃ© Kiosk de Nimai) which sells fresh Baapuji cakes and never have I got a stale one from his shop.Â 
I wanted to give you a BIG ZERO. Shame on you, Novotel.

Ordered a Black Forest cake from here for a friend's birthday. The cake was well decorated with chocolates shavings , on top and on the sides too. The cake had dollops of whipped cream in it , with a soft chocolate sponge cake intervening. Even though it was called Black Forest, I could not get the flavour of cherries at all. The cake supposedly wasn't soaked in cherry syrup and chunks of cherries were nowhere to be found. Thus the cake happened to taste like a normal chocolate cake with whipped cream icing. The price of the cake was okay.

A small bakery outlet in between the bar and restaurant in Novotel Hotel. But it transports you to confectionery land....When you gaze at the various pastries, cup cakes and macaroons. The Eiffel tower installation also adds to the atmosphere. The tea boxes, of different sizes also adds to the ambience. The macaroons were good. There is no sitting here, but you can sit in the restaurant.

Just a single time had a birthday celebration cake from this bakery shop at novotel. I celebrated my birthday this year at studio , they surprised me with a cake , and surprisingly charged Rs 750++ for a butter scotch gateaux cake which wasnot fresh at all. The decoration part was nicely done , but just after the first bite i got confusing a half baked half stale taste . Not expected from this brand .

The buffet at novotel is fantastic for price,they have one of the best dessert offerings in kolkata. We were so impressed that we popped one day just to try some desserts,and we were very disappointed,they were kind of stale ,we felt these were there for sometime,as this place is not that crowded. Its not expected from a place this this. Not going unless we are having the buffet anymore.

Utterly disappointing, unprofessional and unethical gestures.. Not expected from a place like Novotel serving stale products to customer. Followed by some uncalled for incidents forced strong dislike about this place.
Well to justify my words would like to share my awful experience I had here. I was there to redeem my Zomato voucher given on my day of verification. After arriving we were offered a place to sit at Square. After choosing my products directly from the bakery showcase not any menu card or chart. Opted for the chicken croissant- Very ordinary and no chicken stuffing at all don't know what it was in apart from the bread. Then some of the pastries among which chocolate pastry, Fresh fruit , cheese cake, Blueberry muffin and Tiramisu. 
Firstly the chesse cake and Tiramisu was stale don't know how came they serve it to the customers also even though informing no sign of apology at all. Very reluctant. And the server started arguing until someone else interrupted in.

Fresh fruit tasted awful as well even though it was not stale fortunately but the taste was very poor. 

Only the chocolate pastry and blueberry muffin was decent in taste. Also the muffin was expected to serve warm which was not the case neither asked for.
That's the part of food coming on to the other part the service very poor. Don't if it was because I informed that I have a voucher. If that's the case then y do u even issue a voucher?? 
Next up the billing ..Tell me which 5 star property doesn't offer a bill?? Leaving 5 star smallest of the place also offer a bill. No bill was offered even after asking the person just said all the products are covered under the 750 INR. Did I ever ask him not to charge me if the billing is higher than the voucher value. Nothing such was mentioned in the voucher as well. I even don't know how much i was charged for which product.. Is this ethical ???

After all this we haven't told them anything only asked for the manager in charge to talk who was not even called after asking for. Utterly disrespectful.. 
Not recommended at all.

The have a nice set up, but the desserts are nothing more than average. They should remember that in a place like Calcutta, you don't stand a chance with desserts unless you offer something fantastic, which unfortunately they do not. Please pull up your socks and come up to Calcutta Mishti levels.

This is one of the best bakeries in town. I came to Novotel this March for a Zomato meetup where we were given vouchers worth 750 INR to be redeemed here by September. Last Saturday evening we were nearby. So thought of coming here and tantalize my sweet tooth.
Delice is a small quaint patisserie inside the hotel which is decorated beautifully in a pretty French style. Cakes, pastries, morning pastries, cheese, bottled water and bottled juice were exhibited at the showcase and the man at the counter was really helpful. He welcomed us warmly, allowed us to sit at The Square, the buffet restaurant at The Novotel Hotel and Residences as Delice doesn't have their own sitting area and also helped us in choosing our dessert platter.
The pastries here are comparatively cheap compared to other five star hotels. Most of them costed 70 INR except the Mango Truffle which charged us 125 INR.
We could manage a total of nine pastries. As we had five over there, we thought we would have to pay extra. But to our surprise, the man who was waiting us let us know that we can take some more.
For sit in and trying desserts, we had Roasted White Chocolate Brownie, Chocolate Dome, Tiramisu, Chocolate Eclair with Meringue and a Mango Truffle.
The mango truffle was too good. Rich, creamy, gooey with lots of freshly cut mangoes. Chocolate eclaire with meringue was okayish, good to taste but nothing extraordinary according to Novotel standards. Tiramisu was good but for those who loves the bitter flavour of coffee. The best was the roasted white chocolate brownie. The white chocolate layer was undercoated with a thick layer of caramel. Below which there was a small brownie. This was a very different kinda dessert which I never had before. The chocolate dome came with a surprise. Thick chocolate sphere came with chocolate mousse inside. I loved the berry jelly they served on top of the mousse. You can't see the jelly and mousse until you break the dome.
We brought home some pastries too. White chocolate roasted brownie and the chocolate dome were so good that they had to be there because I wanted my family to try them too! On extra, we also got a Fruit pastry and a Tuscan Slice. Both of these were extremely good. Loved all of the bakes here at Novotel and once again my sincere gratitude to them for gifting us such a voucher. My suggestion to them is that they can introduce coffee or tea so that we can have the desserts over a cuppa. This assured, everything will be more than perfect. Thank you once again. Happy Dining! :)

Happiness is a thing that we all look forward to!! And while treasure hunting for the same we often end up in seamless efforts with no result at all!!

But have you ever imagined or tried to find happiness in simple things?!!
How about a plate full of desserts and snacks, if it can bring a flattering glee on your face??!!!
Sounds interesting?!!

Walk in to some happiness at "Delice", without thinking twice.
Located inside "Novotel", this house bakery of theirs houses an exclusive collection of pastries, bakes and confectioneries which is sufficient enough to delight anyone with its beautiful aroma and heart melting taste. So, the moment you have your first bite, you wont need to hunt for happiness anymore. Because, happiness will eventually follow you to bring in the smile of rejoice, with your heart dancing in the rhythm divine.
But you'll really regret, if you miss out on their house special wide range of flavoured Macaroons, 'Danish Pastry', chicken sandwiches and Chocolate Pastries, as these are the must have items without which your visit is incomplete.
And apart from that, they have a wide range of other snacks and confectioneries in their menu, which you can try, and I can assure you that you'll be utterly delighted with each and every bite.

The entire service team is extremely nice, and courteous. Specially, Mr. Saheb deserve a special mention for his charming personality and excellent sense of hospitality. And off course a standing ovation to

We were there at Novotel on a Sunday which has been newly opened at Kolkata. Though the term â€˜newâ€™ is pretty relative and I only got the chance to visit it nearly after 11 months since the day it was inaugurated. Novotel with its headquarters in France has got nearly 400 hotels and resorts in 60 countries. The grandiose structure and interiors generates immense awe which is hard to explain in words, so I wonâ€™t try to depict that here in this quick review, I better store that for my blog. The overall experience was lovely and while we were leaving we promised to visit the place more often for reasons more than one.

LOCATION - - - - - The property is located just beside Axis Mall which is now quite a landmark in the Newtown Action Area â€“ I region. It is very easy to locate the building by passers-by as it has got a prime location right beside the flyover and the main road (that is connecting Rajarhat and Saltlake Sector-5.

AMBIANCE - - - - - As I had said in the introductory paragraph, the interiors are world-class and you feel overwhelmed when you walk inside the property. Obviously the place has got valet parking which is smooth and seamless.  At this 5-star property you can choose to rejuvenate yourself in the way you like, and we chose to indulge in some sinful desserts at their bakery called, Delice so that we could end that weekend on a sweet note! It is a bakery cum an open Air Terrace outlet serving Mediterranean & Arabic cuisine through live counters. We chose to have their bakery products and were seated indoors which had high ceilings, awesome interiors and standards absolutely at par with the other 5-star properties I have been to. The soft background music which was being played at the restaurant area was very pleasing; mostly saxophone instrumentals were being played that evening. The place has got some remarkable cleanliness quotient and the staffs are working pretty hard to keep the place clean on a continuous basis. Overall, I would say 5 on 5 for ambiance.

FOOD - - - - - We ordered the below items from this bakery:

a) Macaroons â€“ One of the best French Macaroons (or rather, Macarons) I have had so far in the city. We opted for Coffee flavored Macaroons and Vanilla Macaroons. Both of them were excellent though I liked the Coffee flavored ones a bit more. The macaroon cookies were neither flat nor cracked, so the mixture/batter must have been prepared perfectly. It had a lovely texture, nice ruffled circumference, mildly moist and was just melting in the mouth. Gives immense pleasure and satisfaction when you have this piece of gastronomical marvel on your plate!   

b) Danish â€“ This multilayered pastry from Denmark next conquered our plates. It had nice sweet puff that you can get from fine rolling your yeast dough. We really loved the juicy sugary layered finish to it that was surely not overtly sweet, it optimally satisfies your taste buds and fills you up a bit. 

Â  

c) Chocolate Mud Slice â€“ This piece of mud cake looked so perfect, so royal when served. It was covered with ganache on top that made it more appealing and appetizing! It was extremely chocolaty and should satiate your wildest cravings for Chocolate in a moment. It has gooey chocolaty soft crust or rather mud filling up the whole slice end to end. A piece of heaven for chocolate lovers! 

d) Chocolate Doughnut â€“ It was a glazed toroidal ring doughnut with thin covering of chocolate. The dough must have been prepared well as it had a nice fluffy inside. Overall the item was above average and filling. 

e) Opera Cake â€“ Oh I just loved this. It was a chocolate pastry with loads of difference. It was covered with ganache on top that made it extremely enticing. The inside had an amazing finely grounded nutty texture to it that just blew me away! I donâ€™t remember if I had ever tasted something like this in pastries before. Very pocket pleasing price and hence should be tired out for sure.

Â  

f) Fresh Fruit pastry â€“ This white colored pastry had fresh canned fruits (Kiwis, etc) on top of it that made it look stunning and appetizing. It was extremely soft and tasted amazing, not very sweet but soul satisfying for sure.

PRICE - - - - - Now comes the best part, if you are at this bakery you need not worry about the pocket pinch. Yes, it is in a 5-Star property with top-notch quality product being served but at amazing pocket-friendly rates. The Macaroons will cost you INR 40 per piece and most of the pastries with cost you below INR 100. Taxes will be charged extra on the printed price, but overall the bill amount should not hurt your wallet!

SERVICE - - - - - We were extremely pleased with the service here; it was very professional yet warm. The person looking after our table was extremely well spoken and courteous, which was expected at this place. They were also helpful while selecting items / placing the order and had knowledge about the available items and ingredients of the items available.

SUMMARY - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.6/5

Food quality: 4/5

Food presentation: 4.2/5

Hygiene: 4.4/5 

Value for money: 4.2/5 

Ambiance: 5/5

Service: 4/5

Overall I will rate this place 4 out of 5. I will be back pretty soon to try out rest of the items they have to offer since this first experience of mine was absolutely brilliant. Moreover since this place is pretty close to my apartment it is absolutely very convenient for me to host small chit-chat sessions at this place with my friends while savoring these delicious desserts and sinful gastronomical wonders! Do visit them and I am sure you will be amazed with the entire experience!

Cheers!

Went there to pick up some pastries for my friend's birthday.. saw those tiny petit fours on the display shelf. Couldn't help but buying them. The packaging was so cute ...in tiny pencil case style boxes with a pack of four each and slightly bigger ones too. The bag given was also very colourful and classy.. my friend loved it..thanks for giving such detail on packaging.

Was craving for some rich pastries and ended up landing at this place. My first visit to Novotel - indeed a mind blowing place.

Have visited numerous 5 stars in my life, but indeed, this one's the best. Ambience at this place is better than those at the Gurgaon 5 stars. Felt like entering some Nawab's Palace - size of Novotel was mesmerizing. Several staff greeted me on the way and wanted to help me out for anything I needed. Hygiene - crystal clear - not a single dot of untidiness. Indeed, it was maintained to perfection. 

Coming to the food, I ordered some pastries priced at just Rs. 70 + taxes - which are very reasonable since this is a luxury hotel. Pastries were very nice - the brownie pastry deserves a special mention for its taste. The Mocha pastry was also good. Presentation and Packing was also very nice. Staff was inexperienced as was evident from the mistakes he was making - no issues - as with time, he will become skilled :). However, the person was very sweet and made all efforts to satisfy customer preferences - Cheers!

Only drawback I felt was that no eggless pastries were available. Even the snacks items (patties etc.) contained egg - so, the veggies might have a hard time.

Not rating this place 5 stars due this!

Looking forward to visit again soon!

Delice is the bakery section in the Â recently opened Novotel. The spot is perfectly done and enriched with huge amounts of macaroons of different flavors. The decoration part with such a large number of bright treat containers and confections make you feel you are in a pixie land. In any case, the Novotel's friendliness administration gathering was something truly lovable. They are extremely inquisitive and accommodating, I must say. What's more, the primary point is cleanliness that I like most.Â 

About the food, I guess Delice is the best part of the Novotel. You should try this dessert section once. Such a large number of sorts of creams and shot glasses loaded with bunches of known and obscure flavors make you go gaga over treat. You can likewise attempt their truffles cake and tart. Truly yummy! I wanted to try main course but filled my tummy here :D

Delice is the bakery section in the newly opened Novotel. The place is beautifully done and decorated with tons of macroons of various flavours. I personally thought the items there were limited though price wise it was very pocket friendly. The staff was friendly and very informative. While we tried their desserts in the outdoor seating are he stood there updating us about their buffet and dessert options.

We had tried the strawberry macroon which was nice, buttery and was Rs.30 per piece.

Next we tried their black forest which too was soft and just melted in our mouth priced at Rs.70.Â 

Overall small but nice bakery. Hopefully they will introduce more items in the near future.
