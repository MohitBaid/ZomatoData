I am utterly in love with their rolls. I have tried all the basics,  egg,  chicken and mutton and I must say,  in the area,  they are selling the best quality rolls.

Very bad experience I must say. The price is relatively on the higher side whereas the food you get is really bad and bland with absolutely no taste and no smell. Just a waste of money. 5 of us went to that restaurant and they literally drag us  to make us go inside. The service is so horrible that we literally had to get our plates and tissue paper by ourselves as there are no people to do that even. When the food came In front of us we were literally shocked to see the portions of fried rice. Even the chili chicken I tried was the worst I ever had. Roadside stalls sell much decent and tasty at a much cheaper price.
I would suggest no one to go there even if you are hungry. Better get your stomach full by eating those momo and phuchka which you get on the opposite side of the footpath if you are damn hungry. üòÑüòÑ. Even I didn't click any pic as I didn't even feel like itüòëüòëüòë

Was hungry so had to chek in over here the place here i found is shaggy n untidy...
After complaining about the untideness they took the iniative to clean the table n spray room freshner. The ambience out here is pathetic.
Coming to the food it is not at all edible. Food quality over here is worst.
Simply wasted my money here.
Would rate 0 out of 10.
Will suggest people not to come here...

Rating it based on their rolls... They are SUPERB when it comes to rolls.. it's situated just where southern Avenue is starting and they are very famous for their wonderful rolls.. it's a take away place though they have a small place where you can dine on chinese but I doubt if that if as popular as the take away counter! Fantastic rolls!!

Located near rabindra sarobar this small food joint serves rolls, noodles & different types of pakoras.

Tried their chicken roll once. Had to wait for a long time to get it as it was very busy that day. But it was disappointing as the roll wasn't worthy of the waiting, it was pretty average.

Peep Inn is a small dine restaurant with big kitchen located on the corner of main road near to Rabindra Sarobor Metro & Lake Garden. Dine is small with AC that doesn't work & very few sittings that also kind of dirty I would say. Their menu is having common Indian & Chinese items to choose from but all may not be available.

Our group of friends ordered Mutton Biryani, Moghlai Paratha, left over ordered Chicken & Mutton Roll. They served Moglai at first within a small period of time, then they served Biryani & after a long gap they served the Rolls. This says how pathetic is their service.

Now talking about foods the quality of the Biryani was very poor as well as its quantity. Biryani wasn't well cooked & spices weren't mixed properly. It was very rich & oily. Mutton piece wasn't of Biryani it was served by taking it from Mutton Kasha. Mutton was soft but with bad taste. Surprisingly the same Mutton Kasha of Biryani was in my Mutton Roll, that also with some small bones. Sauces used was of pathetic quality. Overall all the foods were very bad in taste & not at all satisfactory in any way.

Pricing is average but that doesn't deserve a single penny for their quality. Overall experience over here is so bad that you would pee rather than peep in. Recommendations is to avoid this place doesn't matter how hungry you are.

One of my favourite rolls. For takeaway, this is really good. The rolls are big, spicy and nice. Not a big fan of the other food there. My favourite is definitely their egg roll. The other rolls, chicken, mutton are not so crunchy, rather they are juicy. If you gonna have that, then it's a great one.

Situated at the rabindra sarovar crossing. I heard of this place many times from my father but never had a chance to experience it. So I gave it a try. I tried egg mutton roll. It was really good in taste and size. I did not expect the roll to be that good. And the roll had sufficient mutton pieces.

Just across the Rabindra Sarovar crossing you can find this place. For rolls they provide that in front counter..rolls are okayish if you're going to compare with other hotshot roll counters. But for proper dining they have a tiny place in their 1st floor. 
Well, I only went there once that experience was enough to repel me. The place is kinda shabby tiny and highly unhygienic which I disliked the most. 
Apart from that, coming to food we went for mixed Hakka chowmein n Manchurian chicken ...the food came almost half-an-hour after we placed the order, chow mein was greasy and burnt in several portions and trust me it was distasteful as well. Chicken Manchurian was rather okay ...we could only eat the chicken pieces otherwise the gravy was inedible..salty n extra soya sauce making it extremely unsavoury! 
After that horrific experience I'll never recommend it to someone else.

A once famous roll outlet which has now lost it's prominence due poor quality of food served. I remember how one had to stand in a serpentine queue to get a roll from this eatery. Their double egg roll was famous as it would suffice the hunger of even a glutton. Now the rolls are tasteless and stuffed potatoes and dripping in oil.

As this place doesnt offer a good place to sit..people prefer to stand and eat outside the counter on the footpath... but poor pavement!! It gets littered with wrapping papers and food waste!! This is a huge turn down point... on such a sophisticated and busy locale this is not tolerable..
We appreciate ur food stuff and service but you should also maintain both external as well as internal hygiene..

This small restaurant is located at Southern Avenue right at the Tollygunj rail bridge crossing. It is a very small place with a seating capacity of around 10 people max. Nothing really to write about this place except that it offers food at a very cheap and subsidised rate which is expected taking the quality and every other aspect of the restaurant into account. Food quality is decent and the place can come in handy when one is low on budget and around this place with a empty stomach!

The thing about this place is you won't feel the need to "peep-in" .. or better you can take parcel from here. .. Now comes to my experience ..
Food - I have tried there special chicken roll, chicken roll , egg roll etc. Chicken rolls consists of big chicken chunks. Its quite full filling. 
 Having eating here since many years but never took seating availability because it looks quite a bit unhygienic and  Shady from outside. It is not a usual restaurant type. Mainly take out station. Mind it you can't think about calories when eating here!
LOCATION - it is situated at the crossing of rabindra Sarobar,  very near to the metro station. At the crossing of the lane which goes to menoka cinema.
Price - as per the price of rolls it is moderate.  Overall price is not high. No taxes included either. 
My suggestion will be to try their chicken roll or other rolls.. dont go for high priced items.

Nothing really to write about this place except that it offers food at a very cheap and subsidised rate which is expected taking the quality and every other aspect of the restaurant into account. Food quality is decent and the place can come in handy when one is low on budget and around this place with a empty stomach!

Try the rolls from this joint only .. you will not be dissapointed.. the rolls are quiet big and staffings is decent.. the price is also cheap.. this is one of the oldest joint for this area known for their rolls only :)

The thing about this place is you won't feel the need to "peep-in" .. or better you can take parcel from here. .. Now comes to my experience ..
Food - I have tried there special chicken roll, chicken roll , egg roll etc. Chicken rolls consists of big chicken chunks. Its quite full filling. 
 Having eating here since many years but never took seating availability because it looks quite a bit unhygienic and  Shady from outside. It is not a usual restaurant type. Mainly take out station. Mind it you can't think about calories when eating here!
LOCATION - it is situated at the crossing of rabindra Sarobar,  very near to the metro station. At the crossing of the lane which goes to menoka cinema.
Price - as per the price of rolls it is moderate.  Overall price is not high. No taxes included either. 
My suggestion will be to try their chicken roll or other rolls.. dont go for high priced items.

It's an old restaurant. Located near Rabindra Sarabor Metro Station. The place has a sit and dine area. It's small and uncomfortable. The food is nothing much to talk about. The rolls are good. You can try chicken and egg roll. The place is bit unhygienic.

Peepin is an age old famous restaurant which has lost its fame wid passing years. Nd there are quite obvious resns also. The place is not renowvated even once may b and now the owners have started two restaurants seperately and fight over customers lyk anythng which is quite embarrasing. A women who takes ordr literally insists u to give ordr which she will suggest. And is vry annoying. coming to d food their famous roll and biriyani is jst bhogus nd horrible. Last tym i tried their paratha and chkn curry which was ok type bt prices are quitee high too. So its nt wrth it.

Let's face it, it's not a resturant, it's a food stall..don't even bother sitting inside to enjoy your meal. Parcel it or better yet grab a Chicken Roll or steamed momo and enjoy it standing outside (if you don't mind). They have maintained the traditional taste of rolls for ages. So give it a try. Recommended with discretion.

Been and taken food from here numerous times. Situated near the Rabindra Sarobar Metro, just opposite the Tollygunge Railway station, this place boasts of good rolls, Moghlai, Chicken Biryani etc. Fast service and ideal fast food joint. 

Recommended : Their special Chicken Roll which costs Rs. 65 is something you should try.

This is a nostalgic place. This was delicacy in the childhood days in early nighties when I used to stay in Tollygung. The size of the roll used to be enormous and it was so very different and Better than the para stalls.

Peep n inn is the pioneer of rolls in south kolkata though to be very honest in todays standard they are pretty mediocre . They are privileged becuz  they are located at the main entry of rabindra sarovar from D.S. Road. They are damn pocket friendly too. As a result they attract a lot of couples from lake.

An offshoot from the old peep-n-inn, this one is a nice small joint for quick snacks. We tasted egg roll, chicken roll, egg chicken roll and fish fry. Service is pretty fast and they are less oily than the original food joint. The rolls are made with nice soft paranthas and the chicken were well cooked. The fish fry was to my my surprise good. Overall value for money and you don't have much option in that area.

This restaurant is located on rash behari avenue towards menoka cinema hall and lake. It is situated on first floor. The decor of the restaurant is moderate with low lit dim lights. For the sitting arrangements they have leather couches and the area is quite spacious. They offer mainly chinese cuisines ranging from- chinese soups, chowmein, fried rice, chilli chicken, manchurian, chilli paneer,etc. The quality and the quantity of their offerings are around average and does have that distinguished chinese flavor which spreads on your palette delicately. Overall it is a moderate setup with average set up and standard and provides quite tasty savories in reasonable price.

Only good thing about this restro is the location. U will "peep" n not feel like going "in".. its so unkempt.  Dirty. Not even a proper pedestal fan. U ll die out of d heat. So I decided to leave n parcel the food. but the mutton roll dat I had was quite good. So u may parcel it. Highly not recommended.

Peep-N-Inn- Probably located Near Tin Tin. 
--------
Brief:
Had visited this place quite sometime back. It is located just on the main crossing when you take a right turn towards menoka (heading from sarobar metro station) you see the big peep-n-inn board. I probably had never tried it before as it always used to look empty and all. 
--------
Food:
As couple of my friends were tired to try any nearby places, we bumped into peep-n-inn for a roll. I ordered:

1) Chicken Roll - The roll was pretty okay okay. Not very great or something
--------
Conclusion: 
Probably, it was not a hell of an experience for me. I did not like the hygiene out here too.

The place is situated in a prime location and the hotel is quite old . People from Rabindra Sarobar lake come to have food here. The place is Quite good for fast food. Rolls are very tasty here and they serve a number of delicious rolls. Its situated beside Tintin. It faces some competition but Its quite busy in the evenings. Its on the road so no place for sitting. Main thing is food quality is good. Must Visit if you are near and if you are a foodie.

Have been visiting there over 3 years. Located beside TIn Tin and i specially like their rolls.  Menu card does not consists much food items but the listed ones are great to eat. Prices are reasonable and staffs are good. Starting with chicken,had Chicken Butter Masala and Chicken Bharta...both were very tasty. Also had their biriyani,,,which i did not like completely,,,Then in mutton preparations,had Mutton kasha cause the other items of chicken were unavailable. It was tasty. I like the chicken roll and i have their rolls very rarely. Quantity is immense but sometimes some staffs prepare the rolls like anything,,by putting less amount of chicken and other topping,,,,but who do their work consciously,,they prepare the roll in a good manner. Now  about ambiance,,,its okay and slightly untidy...sitting arrangement can be for 25 to 20 people. They do not take much time to serve food,,,but sometimes they take a bit time. Its really a good mini restaurant which is having a good food quality with nice food quantity,,they can improve.. i would rate 3.5 for them....Guys,,visit there to have mini snacks..
