A regular since past 2 decades now. The quantity, taste and price are what has helped them sustain in the market for all these years. A must try if youre nearby.

Located near bata more. Small restaurant area.. pocket friendly..üòÅ
Atmosphere is good. Neat and clean.
We ordered chicken clear soup, mixed fried rice and chilli chicken. All the items are good. 
Stuffs behavior and attitude also very nice.
I didn't like the kitchen area. Because one side of the kitchen is open towards the road and there are big windows there. So easily all the dust from the road can mix with your food while cocking. 
If you wanna have pocket friendly good chinese food then I will recommend this place in park street area.

üòÜüòÜI Have Visited This Place Lazzat, Wellesley Atleast 6-7 Times And I Loved And Liked Thier Manchurian Fried Rice For Rs. 135/- Full And Special Chicken 8 Pcs For Rs. 130/- Full. The Staffs Were Friendly And The Ambience Were Good As Well. Their Hospitality Was Even Great. Within Rs. 290/- Including Tax I Was Happy To Enjoy Their Delicious Food. Thank you Lazzat For Making My Day Superb.üòãüòã

Last Sunday I was at my friend's place at Eliot Road and we ordered dinner from this place. Their mixed rice was good but little smoky but their fish chilly was perfect.

Pocket friendly Chinese joint...Would suggest Chicken Fried Rice along with Chicken Manchurian....The Restaurant accommodates around 15-20 heads hence take away would be the best option... Would recommend this ¬†for an economical meal

Lazzat used to be my favourite place when I was in school. Its a small restaurant not too many tables. Clean and tidy. 
Chicken in hot garlic sauce, schezwan chicken, mixed fried rice/noodles, manchurian fish are some of my favourite dishes here. 
Lazzat is absolutely not a pocket pinch yet it can give you a good meal.

Good Chinese food at affordable price. The pricing has remained consistent over the years and the food tastes good too. The place is small but air conditioned. Overall value for your  money!

Located off Elliott Road near Bata store. This place has been an old ally for cheap chinese food.

True fact that over the time, quality has dipped a little. 

But for the price they serve a very good quantity.

The staple Noodles and Fried rice will never disappoint you. (Unless you have pretty high expectations)

The Dry Chilly Chicken, Hong Kong Chicken, Garlic Chicken, Crispy Chicken, Chicken Lollypop, are all worth the pocket.

Simple taste. Satisfies the palate.

Bonus point: Does home delivery to my place irrespective of the bill amount.

There was a time when I used to be in school that this restaurant was arguably one of the best Chinese outlets in the locality. Those days have passed. This is more of a go-to outlet when you find no other outlets closeby serving food. The food is okay, to be honest. Lacking the taste it once carried to attract customers. And the rate is slightly on the higher side as well. Not to mention, it is mostly vacant these days.

Located near AG School which was my school so lots of memories attached to this joint.
This time went for Crispy Chicken , Lemon Chicken Dry , Mixed Fried Rice and Hong Kong Chicken. Quality has degraded a little bit and the quantity has reduced too , but made new memories.

Tried the food of lazaat after ages again and they didn't disappoint me. The food was good but not like what it used to be but then again no restaurant these days are the way they used to be so according to today's standard it was good.. Tried the chicken fried rice and the chilli chicken and it was really tasty.. Lazzat used to be the King of Chinese in Wellesley years back but now too they have maintained their name..

The Chineese food is the speciality of the Lazzat but slowly and gradually it is even trying to bring up the standards of other cuisine but i would suggest to try the Chinese..!

Location and Description: Its just nearby my Office at the Royd Street at Bata more. They have Indian Chinese and Tandoor items to offer as well as they also offer Full plate and Half plate.¬†

Ambience and Staff: Its a small restaurant with 4-5 tables with A.C, Its clean but require ¬†better lighting.The Bad Part: Well my first visit today at this place as it was in my wish list ¬†for over a month, and i was totally disappointed at my 1st time. ¬†I walked in with good expectations to have something for my lunch as parcel. Some people were dinned already and guess what only 1 waiter to serve all. I gave my order of Veg Fried rice to just have a taste. After giving the order i have to wait over 20 mins to actually know that the chefs don't know that i have a order and i m waiting outside. When i told this to the cashier then they started giving me attention and in 10 mins i had my Parcel in my hand. ¬†

Food: Coming to the food so it was an OK rice nothing to be expressed much. The quantity need to be increased so are the chefs and waiters over here.

QNQ & Prices: Quality of the food is ok but not par average, quantity is ok. Prices are fine as the resto.

Conclusion: ¬†I give 6/10.
Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

I ordered Szechwan chicken & Mixed Fried Rice the last night I forgot to bring food from my house for late night shift. I had previously food from them and according to me their quality of food is regularly going down as days pass. 

Two of their best item is DRUMS OF HEAVEN & Chicken Hakka Noodles.

but for now they seriously need to work their food quality.

What 2 say. Its one of the fineness restaurant i have ever been to. 
The food is amazing specially chicken Hakka noodles with chilly chicken and at times with paratha too.
The hospitality is up to the mark The standard of the food and the best part its just a 5 min walk from my house. 
The owner of the restaurant Mr Sohail is very cooperative and friendly. 
So do visit this if u get a chance and trust me it will b worth it.
