This place is a relief from those tasteless cakes of branded cake shops.The cake thoroughly melts into your mouth.To any birthdays among friends or family we only opt for Bagels.Its delivery criteria are also extremely nice like if the event is in the evening and You probably forgot about the cake then you can think of bagels It will surely help you out.

Well had a sweetooth felt like having some pastries. Ordered pastries through swiggy. Bagels the Cake and Cookie Shop. Ordered a few best sellers as they say from their menu.
My rating on 1 to 5
Chocolate Fudge Pastry 4/5
Kiwi Delight Pastry 1/5
White Forest Pastry 1/5
Black Forest Pastry 1/5
Pineapple Pastry 1/5
Strawberry Delight Pastry 1/5

It's waste of money!!! The size of the Pastries are small to be priced at RS 40 to RS 50 Average. The packing also is not that great. To be true there are better options available at such price range. Would not suggest Bagels to anyone...
