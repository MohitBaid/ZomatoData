I have been waiting to visit this place for a long time and finally made it during this festive season.Most people dont know about this place that serves the best Chelo Kebabs aside from Peter Cat.At an unbelievably low price too.The Chelo Kebab that u get here is simply amazing and that in itself makes this place highly recommendable.That apart,the interiors are Lovely and very spacious- everything that a fancy eatery must have.The staff is quite courteous and you dont feel the pressure to get up from the table as soon as you finish the meal.U can have your meal and a conversation too,at peace at your own pace.A must visit I must say.

Good food with good ambiance...and it is very easy to locate this place. More than a restaurant this place brings a bag full of nostalgia of school and college days for me. This place offers lipsmacking dishes at friendly pocket pinch. Truly a good place to plan a hangout.

There was nothing so special about the signature restaurant. Staffs were inattentive the ambience was not at all good but still the food was good. There are lot of things which should be improved.

Been to this place many times.What I like is that it's always brings bit of nostalgia for me as I am the part of that place nearly for 14 years.Since my school is just next to it I visited this place always.This restaurant is a cozy one with different kind of cuisines.The food is nice.Quality is good but quantity is very less.What I mostly like from here is the caramel pudding. Try it once you'll love it. :)

Being a Gokhalite Sugarr n Spice is my favorite place to give 'adda' with friends. When I visited the restaurant, I received immense disappointment - only Indian cuisine was available. Food is good. Both quality and quantity is satisfactory. Wanted to give 3 but then .5 extra is for the affection to the place.

Amazing atmosphere and food is yum. The staff is very courteous. I had a nice experience. This place is very near to my place, so it will be a regular visit now on. I went there with my best friend and we had dragon chicken as starters and nawabi chicken biriyani and special mutton biriyani. We took chicken butter masala as well. The portions were so much that we didn't had any room for dessert. So, we came back in the evening to taste the cakes. And I loved the whole experience.

One of my friend recommended this, now I can understand why she did. The food was delicious, quantity was great too. Ambiance was good too, a great place to hang out and dine. And the best part is, it is cheap. Although the service was kind of a bit slow. All in one, a 4.5 star rating from my side.

This place holds so many memories... We literally saw this place evolving from a small snacks bar to a restaurant now.. Being just beside our school, we used to get discounts and what not... The perks..! Though I'm not a fan of the cakes, but the fish fry and double fish roll used to be good...Rating this place a 4 for the buckets of memories associated with this place...

I have so many memories in this restaurant I can't even begin to count. Though I am not a fan of Sugarr and Spice cakes, I must admit they have saved many a days of impromptu birthday parties at the hospital.  We have had quiet lunches, dinners or boisterous parties.... Signature had been our haunt ever since it opened doors and I really like some of their food. Especially the Chinese cuisine. I love their pepper chicken and their manchow soup. And you cannot go wrong with their drums of heaven and chilli chicken! However I have never ventured to their north Indian delicacies and I have heard that they are quite inconsistent.

I remember getting introduced to this place by a friend of mine. We had a starter, she a stroganoff and me some grilled chicken kind of a dish. I felt the place to be underrated and not being given much of an exposure as the major footfall is in there ground floor section. 
I've been to this place after that as well and found it to be quite a value for money. 
This was a couple of years back though.

I visited there quite a few times but never have been disappointed the way I visited this time. We order Korean fish and was startled to see that they gave Rohu fish instead of Bhetki fish. It is not that they are taking any price less. Fresh lime soda didn't have lemon in it. And the waiters denied that they gave rohu fish instead of indian bhetki they should offer. Feeling sad we ordered a mix Cantonese noodle which was also plain and shallow. 
Ambience is good for a good position but food quality should be according to the price they are charging.

Food taste and quality is good.

Personally a fan of their food & taste I was delighted to visit this outlet as it is the biggest sugarr & spice outlet I've visited till now..it also offers sitting arrangements something which is not available in their other outlets.
We went their soully keeping in mind other outlets & mostly to order pastries but once it's appearance changed our perception we decided to set for some delicacies
Chicken buttermasala deserves a mention...it was finger licking given in that cheap price range..just incredible. Pulao was OK. Drums of heaven was also good but chicken pakora was a bit hard fried..may be that's an individual case or may be it was a mismatch for my taste buds:-( overall be sure to check out this joint atleast once..it's totally worth it √:-)

Signature By The Sugarr & Spice is a very simple restaurant with everything OK about it. The place can't be stated as very good or bad. Starting with the ambience and decoration of the place, I personally felt its quite common and simple. I liked the glass walls and the round structure of the place. The lights are dim and can be little more.
The quality of service and behaviour of staffs are decent as well. But I would mention that they take more than the usual time which other restaurant take.
The taste and quantity of food is what it excels at. The taste of the foods are really good. They provide a decent quantity as well. The price of the food items are quite reasonable.
This is a place i have visited quite a few times earlier. I liked most of the items which I have ordered. This time I went with my family and
the following food items were ordered :
#Chicken Shawarma : It has its own unique taste and is different from all other places. Price is unbelievably low.
#Crispy Chilli Babycorn : Its one of my favourite dishes and they prepared it well.
#Mixed Fried Rice : Good
#Mixed Hakka Noodles : Could have been better.
#Hunan Chicken : Loved it.
#Mandarin Fish : The quality could have been better.

The desserts are the best thing you can get here. The quality of the desserts are really good with the taste in same level.
We ordered Choco Moose, Choco Crunch and few others.

What to order?
You should definitely go for Chicken Shawarma. And a must order of the desserts. You will definitely run again for another round after having one.
The Chicken Club Sandwich is also special out there.

How to Locate?
This place is very easy to find. Located in Bhawanipur area near the very famous Balwant Singh Dhaba and PG Hospital you will easily get this place.

Final Words:
If you are looking for classy decoration and cool ambiance you can search zomato again. But if you want to fill your tummy with good food by spending less bucks you should visit this place. This place is definitely for students. Get endless varieties of food from snacks to desserts at one place. One last thing to mention : DESSERTS

3.5/5 is what I will give overall for this place. I would have given 3 but 0.5 for its desserts.

Being a Gokhalite, it used to be our Canteen after school. Such nostalgia it is glad to see it in Zomato
Anyhow, coming to the food they do serve a healthy food and have an excellent ambience. Previously they used to have the dine in facility upstairs but now they have it downstairs as well. 
However, they take a long time to serve the dishes. Overall, a good place!

Have been to this place a number of times. They provide a nice roadside view up there and the ambiance does feel nice. The food is of a mixed quality. Try the starters, they are the best. Especially the drums of heaven. And crispy chilly babycorn for those who like them. The indian dishes are good though. But the chinese dishes might disappoint as they are not quite up to the mark. They serve baked ice creams which is quite capable to make you feel full if you go through one serving. The chief con is the service as they take a shitload amount of time to prepare and serve the food and mostly they seem understaffed or whatever. But anyway they do deserve a visit and so this is recommended.

Previously rated this place 3.5 and it used to b one of my favrite places to have lunch n dinner at a moderate budget..

But time to update my review..n rated 1.0..

Thanks to the staff n management..During my last two visits..The bhvr of the staffs dsappntd me..

Visited this outlet on 26/05/2016 fr lunch.....Thought of ordering Italian..n they said.. "Mam continental er chef akhono aseni.." ..thus ended up ordering north Indian cuisines...
Visited this outlet today 22/06/2016 at about 5 p.m..n wen we reached the first floor..we were informed that the floor has been booked for a party.. Ok  ...We moved to the ground floor...

But hell!! no one was there to attend us..we waited for a table but no response form the management..Only one table was available..n the waiter guided a group of 5-6 people towards the table..n completely ignored us since we weren't in a group...(order km peto..) 
 
Such a disgusting bhvr  from the management was nt expcted... Not recomended at all..
