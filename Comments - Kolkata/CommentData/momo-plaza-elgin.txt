I have visited this place 3-4 times. Tasty momo in reasonable price is the best thing of this place. I like its ambience. I have tried pork fried, pork pan fried, chicken fried, chicken steam momos which are of awesome taste. The soup is also nice.

I dont know why people recommend momo plaza for having momos. I feel denzong is a btr place to grab a plate of momo. Momo plaza is simply overrated with normal taste of momo. There is nothing special about their momo

So, it speaks for itself.. Chinese food at a very affordable rate with decent taste.. The only real issue with this restro is that it has no AC section.. So in the summer time, it is a tad difficult to seat in the alley part of this joint!!
The most favorite dish of mine is Chicken with Kaju Salad, Pork Pan Fried Momo and all noodles!

Located near elgin road crossing this restruarant is one of the oldest momo joints of south kolkata..One must definitely try any of its types as all are equally mouthwatering momo dishes.Their chinese maincourse and side dishes are charged at a nominal rate and their quality is average..Momo lovers should definitely try this.

I love, love, love this place! A tiny heaven selling amazing momos, thukpas, fried rice and chilli chicken! I won't vouch for the cleanliness but definitely for the taste. This small restaurant has got enough seating to seat around 50+ customers now, maybe more. They have expanded into the rooms and corridors inside, but earlier used to only seat people in the first two rooms. The decor is nothing great, very standard, but the large frame of the woman trying to catch 'The Last Train' home will always intrigue me. Momo Plaza has a huge fan following, mostly of college goers but they appeal to all age groups. Even my dad has a soft corner for this shop!

So we went to this place on 26th Sept 2017 (yesterday)
We ordered chicken deep fried momos, chicken steamed momos and pork steamed momos 
The ambience was 0.5 stars
Coming to the food
The chicken momos were awesome and filled with chicken 
But the pork momos lacked the amount of meat
And the clear soup served with the momos was awful
It was just warm water and herbs not even a pinch of salt 
Overall average place

This place is situated on the way to brand factory near the sadan metro station. Nice place for tibetan and chinese food with varieties . Ordered pan fried pork momo , mixed hakka and chilli chicken (gravy).
Momo is too good. You should try them atleast. Hakka was good but a less spicy . In a short a good food outlate .

The pork thukpa was heavenly. The pork pieces were evenly cut and boiled, and the broth was a beautiful combination of just the right amount of veggies and spices. A must try here.
The American chopsuey was decent, although the gravy was too spicy, and the fried noodles had a tad bit extra oil.

The ambiance is okayish, depending on where you sit, and the spaces are slightly cramped, but overall, it's good nonetheless.

Pricing is reasonable and this place is a must for hungry college-goers.

Located in a lane adjacent to the Rabindra Sadan Metro Station (Gate No. 3) and almost opposite to the Chain Break. I went there today with my brother in the afternoon and ordered Chicken Gravy Noodles and Dragon Chicken. Both of them tasted awesome! A little more care towards the hygiene of this place would make it more comfortable and appealing. Overall a nice and pocket friendly place to hangout with friends and family. I would like to come here more and taste their other dishes as well.

A quick bite would define the place. Simple Chicken fried rice had a smokey flavour which made thr dish more special. Chicken momo steamed have always served the purpose. This had a certain amount of the juice stock in it which elevated the flavour. Lastly, the side dish Chicken with bell peppers. The dish seem to be a simple one but had loads of flavours which can be differentiated from one another. In other words, almost authentic chinese cuisine.

I always seem to have a bias towards places which emanates the old 'Calcutta' charm. This place is not spacious, no AC, dining rooms crammed together with the kitchen ensures its actually warmer than outside here. But the service is fast, food tasty and prices reasonable. Added attraction are its pork based dishes.

I have been there before have tried momos which was great but this time we tried chicken fried rice(Quantity was good), chicken boiled rice(taste was awesome),pork sweet and sour(quality was good as dis was my first time with pork).It is pocket friendly.It is a good place to hangout as it is near to bhawanipur, forum mall and brand factory. The inner space was quite small and was simple without much decors!

This is a small cosy place situated in a lane adjacent to Rabindra Sadan metro station( 2mins walk actually from the Metro station ).
We went there on a Saturday afternoon and it was bustling with people. We had to wait for some 15mins to manage a seat for four.

A very simple place with nothing fancy decor or interiors but offering some awesome momos.

We have ordered for-

1) Cheese chicken fried momo ( Just one word for it- Superb! Really I did not believe that it will beat the taste of chicken cheese fried momo from wow momos but I was proved wrong. It was soo good in taste. Per plate contains 5 pieces of momos. Served with hot soup )

2) Chicken Pan fried momos ( Again good in taste. Totally lived upto my expectations both in quality and in taste. The gravy was a bit spicy so if you like something subtle and non-spicy then don't go for it. Served with hot soup. )

3) Chicken Kothey ( Tried this unique dish for the very first time. Half portion of the momo was fried and the other half was steamed giving it a different taste and the chicken filling was yummy. Served with hot soup which was watery and runny very much )

4) Chicken hakka noodles ( They ran out of veggies so proportion of veggies was less in the noodles and the chicken pieces were a bit hard and chewy. Taste was average.)

5) Chilli chicken dry ( Crispy and tasted really good)

Overall had an unexpectedly good experience. The food was awesome and momos were too good to be true.
Service is prompt. Staffs are courteous. Space might be an issue and there is no A.C. So you might feel a bit uncomfortable on a warm humid day. Otherwise all good.

Will surely visit there soon to have their momos again.

An old known Tibetan restaurant in Elgin area, famous for its momos and soups. This place is a frequent hub for chaps from the nearby schools and thus goes easy on pocket.
To talk of taste , I'd say it's okay. I've been here twice and to be honest haven't been any bewildered by their dishes. The momos we ordered weren't soft , and the prawns were somehow unfresh. Although I really liked their triple schezwan fried rice. The pork was also up to the mark.
Momo plaza , is the place to go when you're extremely hungry but low on cash.
What we ordered : Roasted chilli pork, triple schezwan fried rice, chilli prawns , chicken panfried momo.
Taste: 3/5
Ambience : 3/5
Value for money: 3.5/5

This place is located in Elgin Road, inside the alley leading to Brand Factory and Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital. The place is built on the side of a very old building and doesn't boasts of nice ambience either. We had Egg Fried Rice along with Sweet and Sour Pork. The taste and quality of the food is not very good and the price is attached to this quality of food is tad high as well.

Went to this place after a 3km walk and my expectations went high with each step.
Its a small place with very old interiors and dark ambience.
I ordered the most preferred and famous steam chicken Momo's. The momos were no doubt great but the sauce was not up to my expectations so didn't really relish the same because according to Me the sauce plays the most important role and this was disappointing!!
The most hideous ever CHILLY CHICKEN is served here... Recommended by the owner himself but I couldn't gulp down more than a bite..it was so not upto the taste!!
I would definitely not recommend this place to someone who has a very good taste for this cuisine..
And maybe would never visit again because it's food couldn't do it's magic on me FOR SURE!!!

I have lost count of the number of times I have visited this place with my mother as a kid. I simply loved their momos! Filled with the broth, juicy and melting in your mouth kind, they would make some of the best momos in the city. Other than that, the noodles and rice too had the touch of 'Indianised Chinese's as I prefer to call it. However, over the years, their quality have degraded very badly and my visit a few years back was pretty disappointing. Infact, I had got food poisoning after that!

However, I have heard that the place has recently made attempts to better their service and food, so I do plan to make a visit soon.

Momo plaza is another hidden gem this city had to offer. Absolutely delicious Chinese food is served here at very reasonable prices. The interior is dark and shabby. But then again, it lends to the whole charm of it, according to me. The service can be improved on. Food is served in generous proportions and it is the ideal place to feed a big group.

Visiting this place since my school days. Recently I went there but the quality of food was not the same anymore. An authentic Chinese restaurant which lost it's place gradually. Still some of the dishes are still great like the Chicken or Pork Pan Fried Momo and the Dry Chilli Prawn. The only good part is maybe it's still on a tight budget and doesn't leave you short of money after having your meal.

A good, old fashioned chinese-Tibetan restaurant. You can feel and enjoy the homely atmosphere here.
The taste of the food is really good and probably one of the best ones in kolkata in such e reasonable price. Try momo and thukpa here ; these are really awesome.
But the thing I did not like here is the quality of plates, bowls the use. These things are old, cracked and most probably not washed properly. And so I'm not sure how hygienic are the tasty foods here.

Being an absolute momo lover, I HAD TO go to this place after watching it on Zomato. Not a very catchy restaurant if we consider looks. But the food was the real deal. I ordered momos (obviously), one chicken pan fried momo with schezwan sauce and one chicken deep fried momo. Well as expected, the momos were amazing! One of the best momos in town, I can guarantee that. But I felt the pocket pinch was high.

Its situated just off Ashutosh Mukherjee road near to the Rabindra Sadan metro station exit number 3. Only tried the momos in this place. They serve one of the best momos in Kolkata. So, if you want to taste some pretty good momos in Kolkata momo plaza is one of the places you definitely don't want to miss. Not a place which is highly decorated but a place that prioritises quality of food to the ambience on offer. It's a building's passage way that has been developed into a restaurant. The pork pan fried momo and the cheese chicken fried momo are they ones that stand out. The pork pan fried is a bit spicy but if u like it spicy then go for the schezwan variant of the same. They serve hot soup but if you visit the place late evening you might be just getting a bowl of hot water which you need to tell yourself​ that it's the chicken soup that's on offer. It is here that they lost the one rating point. But if you visit the place on an afternoon or early evening you will be greeted with an extremely tasty and thick soup. A must visit for all momo lovers and I always look forward towards visiting this place.

This place is known for Tibetan food. Used to come to this place with family in childhood and at that their momo were delicious. Now they have added Chinese in their menu. We generally go for their momo but once we had their Chinese which was not at all up to their mark, the Chinese chopsuey was too pale and soup part taste like water rather than broth, noodles was like roadside stalls. This time I went there and as we wanted to have something light we just ordered steam momo and pan-fried momo(dry). The taste is degrading day by day. The soup they give with momos are nothing but water with coriander steams and pepper. The pan-fried wasn't tossed in any particular sauce rather sauce was actually fried onions,coriander with vinegar,soy sauce and wasn't a bit spicy. The steam and fried momos are good and if you want to have soup order them separately like hot n sour soup and fried momos(pork) which I liked and try to avoid clear soup as I find the broth added is too tasteless.

There were 5 pieces and was accompanied by a small bowl of soup. We used to love the soup that they served, but yesterday it looked just hot salty water with no taste at all. Coming to the momos ( they were served cold)... We had a horrible experience. Two of my friends got 1 momos each , which were bitter ( yes you read it right!) And was a bit smelly. When we informed the staff, he didn't give any heed to our complaint at all and we were left totally disgusted by their service. Very sorry to say Momo Plaza has lost some of it's dedicated customers. We are never going back!

Small food joint near elgin road. Decorum as well as ambience was not that much appealing but food was tasty.  Fried momo, chicken thuppa and hakka noodles were delicious and a pocket friendly place indeed!

I've visited this place twice.the first time I had  schezuwan pan fried momo along with chicken gravy noodles.this is a small eatery in Elgin road opposite chai break.you can easily spot it.the price of the food is quite reasonable and they don't add vat. the ambience is quite old school.I like this place.

Earlier as a child I used to love going to this place, but recently their quality has been towards the downward side. My last two visits were nothing but waste of money. Recently I visited it and ordered, chicken pan fried momo, chicken cheese momo and chicken kothey! The pan fried momo seemed to have raw colour in it and was less than average in taste, the chicken cheese momo was okayish, the kotheys were more or less nice.
Before that I visited it during the pujas, we ordered, mixed fried rice, lemon chicken, Cantonese chowmein and chicken Manchurian, only the chowmein had been good in taste, the others were waaay below average.

The spoons were so dirty, so were the glasses! So NOT looking forward to visit it again.

Once you have the pan fried momos here, there's no going back.. the gravy is simply addictive. 
The dry chili pork was also amazingly delicious. Juicy,  tender and flavourful. Although the dishes are slightly oily, they are too tasty to not indulge in.
However , this place has gets a bit uncomfortable on hot and humid days. The prices aren't dirt cheap or anything, so I guess an AC or two could be installed.

It's my second round when I reminiscence my old childhood days to find good n mouth-eatering food in a budget values...Momo Plaza remains the same as it in old days.

Located on the lane of Shambunath Pandit Hospital and behind the rabindrasadan metro station.Its is on the ground floor of an old house, but they modernize somewhat to attract more customer by hanging chinese lights outside the buildings.

Menu is same as it in old days and serves all types chienese, Tibetan foods (you can get good pork items also,if u like).

I prefer Thukpa over the momos as as well chopsuey also.

It's a suggested chienese and Tibetan eatery in the central kolkata, should try once..

It's the best place to eat when you are running short in pockets.  A pocket friendly Chinese restaurant. I don't remember how many times we went there. This is one of the best place for me & my boyfriend. We tried almost everything in there menu. I must say their Chicken pan fried momos, Chicken American Choupsy,  Mixed & M.P special Chowmine in Hakka & Schezwan style, Chicken Pakoda, Chicken Drumstick,  Chilli Chicken,  Schezwan Chicken,  Garlic Chicken,  Sweet & Sour Chicken,  Hong Kong Chicken,  Singapore Chicken,  Sanghai Chicken, Manchurian Chicken,  Lemon Chicken,  Mixed fried Rice , M.P special fried rice (Sez) are must try or my favourites.

Located near Rabindra Sadan metro station. Used to visit this place during our school days. Recently we ordered food via Zomato. Except for the momos & kotheys the food standard has taken a steep dip in terms of taste and quality. The bill was that of any decent Chinese restaurants which didn't do justice for the grub they served. You might end up with a stomach bug soon in this hot climate. I really liked this place before but giving 2.5 just because of the momos. There are Chinese restaurants in every localities these days & In order to keep up with the competition they must improvise......

Pan fried momos from The MoMo Plaza is  the best dish from that place. I bet you'll love the tangy flavour of the tomatoes at the same time sweetness of the onion and the essence of garlic and chopped coriander with which the gravy of this fried momo is made up of, this  is actually mouth watering.
Noodles were good, 
We've also tried thukpa which was nice in taste
The seervice is good.
But ambience needs to be taken care of, the place isn't clean and sometimes also smells which can be a turn down.
Rest the food is to drool for! 😍

This place is located near Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital but it was a bit difficult to locate the place. The ambiance is not much to be mentioned but there is a kind of old school charm in it, quite like when you visit really old and traditional restaurants of Kolkata. For starters we ordered Chicken Pan Fried Momo, which we found to be quite good in taste. For main course, had Mixed Fried Rice with chilly Chicken. Nothing much to state about the food quality. It was good overall. The quantity of Fried Rice was adequate too. And at the price at which the items are being offered, we thought it was quite a value for money, though there is room for improvement in terms of quality

Momo Plaza is a medium-sized restaurant located near Rabindra Sadan Metro Station, next to Sambunath Pandit Hospital. Being at a stone’s throw distance from my home, I have visited this place literally a hundred times since childhood. For years, my parents made established a tradition of treating me here after every semester at school..

It mostly offers Chinese and Tibetan delicacies. The place has an eerie, appealing dark setup inside. Earlier, their best dish used to be hakka chowmein and Manchurian(veg as well as chicken). I have also tried their fried rice and momos. The momos are standard, while the rice is a bit too spicy for my taste. Unfortunately, the quality of food dropped greatly about 4 years ago, which made me stop visiting after 3-4 disappointing attempts to restore my faith in the place! I recently visited this place after years, apprehensively. And I did not regret it one bit. Their current veg Manchurian is awesome. I also tried Cantonese chowmein. The quantity as well as the quantity was satisfactory. On the plus side, they do not charge any taxes beyond the prices mentioned. It isn’t too cheap, but it won’t burn a hole through your pocket either. A nice place to hang out with 4-6 friends and indulge in authentic Chinese dishes.

A value for money food joint, Momo Plaza is situated at Elgin Road, right opposite the entrance-cum-exit gate of Rabindra Sadan metro station (not the main gate). The place is quite popular among young people for their delicious dishes. Last to last time we ordered Chicken Fried Momo, Mixed Fried Rice and Garlic Chicken. The food was average. But last time we ordered for Chilli Pork Roasted and Mixed Noodles (gravy). The pork was so yummy that we hardly took any time finishing it off. The noodles was also very tasty. Though the food was delicious, the ambience wasn't that much good. The staffs too should attend the visitors more seriously! But the experience was a good to moderate one. Give it a visit. Cheers to food!
Pocket pinch: Around 400/-

It is quite hard to spot if you are not particularly looking for it, just down the street from Brand Factory, near Rabindra Sadan Metro station. A definite visit for their momos. They serve generic chinese items too but Momos, as their name suggests, is a must. A value for money place that serves a variety of momos (veg, mushroom, chicken, pork; steamed, fried, schezwan, pan fried). The decor and ambience give out an old school vibe, perfect for day to day snacking musings.

Heard a lot about this place as a momo specialist. Went for an evening snack. Ordered chicken pan fried momo and chicken Hakka noodles. The momo tasted good with its sweet and sour taste, well stuffed inside. The noodles was poor. Came in big quantity but lacked taste. The shredded chicken tasted like rubber with sprinkled roughly chopped vegetables. One thing I would like to draw attention to the owner is about the utensils they are using in this place. Age old plates, not even cleaned properly. The vegitable stalk that comes in with the momo was served in an old dirty plastic bowl. On asking for an extra plate, received another dirty plastic plate with a crack in it. The hygiene of this place is a serious concern.
Restaurant accepts cash only.

This had been our regular food joint as the momo they serve is mind blowing!
We tried the following items from here-
1) steamed chicken momo
2) pan fried chicken momo
3) deep fried chicken momo
4) mixed fried rice
5) American chopsuey
6) Schezwan chicken
7) mixed veg noodles(gravy )
Full marks to their momo especially the soup! Their steamed chicken momo is a MUST try! Other items I feel is a little bland... American chopsuey and mixed noodles disappointed us immensely! I wouldn't recommend these dishes to anyone. I somehow feel they make their dishes spiceless! Schezwan chicken, however is a somewhat spicy dish ! I would recommend this place only for momos as thats what they expertise in :)

I have been to this place many a times. So thought of putting up a review. 

Starting with the location.  
Locating this place is pretty simple. Stands on the lane where Brand Factory lies. A 2 mins walk from Rabindra Sadan metro station. 

About the food joint. 
Its a small building turned into eatery. 

Ambience. 
Cozy and homely. Bit congested seatings but works. 

Food. 
Not a fan of the steamed momos they serve. Pan fried momos are exceptionally good. Soups served are never impressive. Chilly Pork Roasted is a must try. 

Service.
Staffs are not much interactive. But don't keep you waiting. 

Pocket Pinch is low. Overall, a good place for Brunching and hanging out.

I have been to this place many a time. This place is located near the Brand Factory outlet on Elgin Road. In fact, the alley that leads to Brand Factory from the main road is the place where this place is located. It is the ground floor of a building transformed into an eatery and you will surely understand that once you enter this food joint. The seating arrangement is done in bits and pieces as it is distributed evenly almost in every room of the first floor. This place serves a variety of dishes but if you are planning to visit this place then do so for their momos. The momos they serve are amazing. I have had their Chicken Steamed Momo, Chicken Deep Fried Momo, Chicken Pan Fried Momo, Chicken American Chopsuey, Mixed  Fried Rice and Schezwan Chicken.

The momos are excellent. The soup served along with the Steamed Momo wasn't up to the mark. Otherwise, the momos were flawless. Do give them a try.

The Chopsuey was disappointing. We had literally struggled to finish this dish. Not recommended

The Schezwan Chicken was very tasty and this is another dish I would like to recommend to you. Very spicy preparation with soft, juicy chicken pieces. Tasted good and complemented the rice well too. The rice, on the other hand, wasn't that good.

A pocket-friendly place apt for college goers. If you love momos then do visit this place.

Momos might have been a popular dish along the Darjeeling belt but it gained popularity along other parts of the state in late few years. This Tibetan cuisine is now a household name and a popular breakfast among urban folks. Since my friends are very fond of this fast food, I have had tasted it too.

Momo Plaza is a popular destination for momo lovers as they are said to serve the best momos in town. 

Located just near the Forum Mall at Elgin Road, this is the place where you find people flocking all the time.

The taste of the momo seemed fairly ordinary to me and I couldn't justify the hue and cry of this particular shop. However, the soup tasted differently on different days. A day you might get amazed and the next day it might seems to be a hot soap water being served. A particular thing what might attract the masses is the fact that all types of soft drinks are available and they charge just ₹2 above MRP.

A visit preferred if you are a momo lover!

My first outside-Chennai review. And it has been one awesome experience. Amazing Tibetan food.

It is my custom to not rate such food joints with specialized awesome food based on ambiance. It's just a small house turned into a restaurant and in busy hours or summer you might even feel the place to be cramped and sweaty. But that's not why you go here! It's the food. 

We started off with Pork Fried Momos which was delicious beyond words. This is one of the best momos I have had yet. Then went with Pork and Mixed Thupka. Both were rich in vegetables, hot and perfect for the cold weather. Mixed Thupka was obviously better. Finally ordered Veg Pan Fried Momo. It was again wonderful but not to my expectation. Still wonderful! 

Glad my early experience with restaurants in Kolkata was so amazing! Cheap and amazing food is the best way Kolkata could have welcomed me!

The momos are good but the Thukpa was not that great. Ambience is okayish. Price is on the cheaper side. There are other varieties of momos available too. I didn't try other kinds of food like the chowmein. You can visit this place more than once.

This is situated near Rabindra Sadan Metro station and is part of the road having more Momo serving eateries. Nothing to say about the ambience, it's kind of neat,with normal seating arrangements. I would suggest one to go for only the Momos , they are quite good. Not a fan of the chowmein here. Pocket pinch is low.

Neat little place along the line opposite forum mall, the street actually lined with momo serving places. This is the cosiest and cleanest long the line, quite old and the best part being pocket friendly. The have ample seating , places appearing at nooks and corners. A somewhat half hearted attempt at what could be called decor is there. Coming to the food, we ordered something called a kothey which is half steamed and half fried momo s.honestly they were like burnt steam momo s. The mixed thukpa was although very appetizing with generous amounts of chicken egg n prawns. The shanghai chicken was stuffed with a lot of cashew n wasnot bad to eat.
Quantity was good

Okay so i went with my sister yesterday 
We ordered pan fried momos and mixed hakka noodles 
The momo finally came after a long time and it was cold
I have been here before but yesterday the service was so poor.
The staffs seemed so rude and disinterested 
We told one of the staff about the momo
And they took another 20 mins to just warm it up.
Meanwhile the hakka noodles were served, we had just taken a bite when we saw a long strand of hair in it
We finally cancelled the hakka noodles and had just the momos
As I said I have been here before but yesterday was a bad experience 
They really need to keep the place clean and hygienic 
And improve their service.
Yesterday was disappointing.

If its not the high end places, it is this for chinese. When the chips are down and you want a cosy place sans aircondition. This is the place for you. The food available is good, my favourite is panfried chicken momo(dry). The quantity is something which I love about this place. The chowmein is great and fills your stomach.

Saw this place many times on my way to the rabindra sadan metro station so decided to drop in. Seating capacity of the place is good, but the ambience is kind of shady. Ordered chicken steamed momo. After they served it looked totally like roadside momos, but tasted even worse. Made me wonder what the high price for that quality of momo was for. The soup spoons were also dirty. We somehow managed to eat the food and left the place immediately. Definitely not going again!

This place is located near elgin road. Opposite of PC Chandra jewellers. A rater low key place where they food quality is above average. They serve various dishes ranging from items of pork, chicken and fish. We ordered gravy and Hakka Chowmein as well as chilli pork. Gravy Chowmein was stashed with chicken and tasted quite good. However the Hakka Chowmein failed to tickle my tastebuds. The pork was average. One thing that they need to improve is their ambience, since in a location like this, ambience matters.

If you are looking for good chinese and tibetan food at a budget price, this is the place to visit. Last time when I visited, I tried garlic fried rice and hongkong chicken. The quantity is more than enough for two. They accept only cash though. The place is small and is homely.

This is my go to place for momos in Calcutta, few of my friends like the restaurant next door more but I prefer this one and that always leads to fights.

I've never had anything else apart from the momos here, they are amazing, juicy and full of flavor. Great tase, great price, great service. Ambience is decent, not like a proper restaurant but with food that good, I don't mind. Do visit if you want some of the best momos in town!

I know this place for years now. They sell very nice and tasty authentic Chinese dish at a very affordable cost.! Their momos and chicken dishes are very good.! On my last visit I tried their pan fried dry chicken momo and Chinese choupsey! 
Then momo was the best with slight crunch on the outer side and the soup was good and filling yummy!
Then choupsey though not the best one that I have tasted but was good, crunchy and delicious with lots of gravy and chicken.
Overall a nice place :-)

The famous joint for momo lovers, serving for so long..the heritage and memories here are unparalleled for many people.
Ambience: those who like that x-factor over air-conditioned fine dines will certainly love it. Dim light ambience and momo goes great together.
Staffs and services: well behaved and fine for me completely. They helps a lot during order but if you're in a bit hurry then you might find the service a bit slow.
No extra taxes.
Food: last but not the least at all, food food food. Of course they serve great mouthful momos which are such a treat for your taste buds. I never tasted their Chinese main course, so can't tell anything about that. personally I feel steamed momo is not good here but fried, deep fried, pan fried chicken momo in sez sauce and pan fried chicken momo gravy all are just delicious as hell.

So, if you're near rabindra sadan or Elgin and you want to have some momo, no place can match this one. 
P.s. the take rs. 10 extra for refilling the soup served with momo.

Went there after shopping. Located near beside Rabindra sadan metro station 3no gate. Just turn left and keep waking, you'll see this  place just right beside you. Not too much hi fi but very good place. 
We tried-
1.Chicken deep fried momo: Very crunchy and crispy, definitely tasty. One bowl of thukpa was served with it. Thukpa was not so thick but okay.

2. Pan fried chicken momo- usually this thing tastes delicious in all the way, but still they made it so good. Gravy was thick, spring onions, garlic were in it. Momo pieces was obviously good. Thukpa was served with it too.
Nice food joint to heal the hunger.

It is located close to rabindra sadan metro station gate 4. We have been there several times to appease our hunger right after college .Today we went there and ordered
Pan fried momo in schezwan sauce-   the bun wasn't soft at all. We didn't get that happy vibes we usually feel as we bite in their momos. It disappointed us. 
Cantonese noodles- appeared to be an lifeless preparation without any  proper taste. The gravy was also served less. :( it tasted way better previously. 
Chilly garlic noodles-  they seemed to be overfried.
We were thoroughly disappointed by the food today. something went wrong or may be the overcrowding mattered.
Hopeful of the next time :)

The momos were quite large in size and the pan fried once had a good spicy and tangy taste to it. The place is a complete value for money and is a must visit for all the momo lovers.:)

I have tried their momos and Thukpa..... both are good in terms of taste. Specially loved their tukpa. They also serve chinese items like fried rice and noodles but in my opinion there are better place available for that. I would suggest to stick with momos.

Overall rating.... a cheap place with great momos.  :)

Best Momos in town, and you get Pork Momos here - exactly what momos are supposed to be filled with. 

All options are good - Steam, Fried or Gravy. 

The fried rice is decent but order if you have to. Sticking to the momos is recommended.

One of my Favourite Chinese Restuarants in the City!
Had been there with my best friend And I remember we were on the verge of crying because of hunger when we entered this place. It was raining so we thought of having a bowl of soup each but decided to share. We ordered a bowl of Non veg Hot and Sour Soup and divided into two and we were almost full after having it! Such was the quantity! The taste was heavenly. We still miss it whenever we are having fever and crave for something really Hot!
We ordered a Plate of Mixed Hakka noodles and a plate of  Chilli Chicken and we could not complete it with ease. However, we had it all because leaving the food on the plate would have been injustice.
I love the decor, the ambience this place has!
Next time I will visit the place to have Momo! Soon!
Till then, 5points to this place. 😘

Elgin road is a place I have to visit every once in a while, and usually such a visit also serves as an excuse to stop by at this restaurant. It isn't much to look at, or even touch and smell to be honest, but the food is generally quite tasty for the price.

The momos are obviously their forte. The other oriental dishes on offer are, although not quite the outre ventures beyond the wildest gustatory daydreams of Kolkata's most fabulous sybaritic chowhounds that some of the other reviewers (presumably inhabiting that same demographic) evidently expect them to be, adequate for the purpose of pleasurably occupying one's maw whilst enjoying a visual feast along the lines of Emilia Clarke's unexpurgated breast show on HBO's 'Game of Thrones' within the comfort of one's own home. Succinctly put - the food is good but the locale deficient, but the latter is not a problem if the former can be taken home.

4 for food; 2 for everything else.

If you're a regular visitor of Elgin Road, you must have come across the name Momo Plaza once in all your visits. It is a small place located near Forum Mall, with no fancy decor or polished look. This place may not look impressive but you know the saying "Don't judge a book by its cover". 

Food here is top notch. I must mention that even with the large number of commercial momo joints that are coming up, Momo Plaza is doing far better taste-wise. It can certainly be called the underdog of all Chinese restaurants. Hygiene is a problem. So is the rustic and almost outdated finishing of the place. But at the end of the day, their food conquers all.

Every time I have to go to brand factory for shopping ... mono plaza comes as a complimentary visit.
Delicious momos but the quantity is far too less compared to the food!
I really like the chilli pork n American chopsuey ....
The food is fair enough but the service is pathetic.
The ambience has nothing special about it.
It's rather small since the entire eating area is divided into separate rooms. On certain occasions I found the place and especially the kitchen very untidy!
Overall it's a cheap place where you can get good food.... but if you come expecting out of the world momos ..... you r definitely going to b disappointed!

The momo tasted delicious as it looked.It looked like any other types of momo except for it's taste.Though the taste of the pork could not be found as it is found in other preparations as the meat was minced here.The tangy taste along with the sauce makes it one of the food in my list to go for.This was my first experience with pork though it tasted like any other kinds of momo except the meat was a bit chewable.It contained minced pork meat prepared in different kind of sauces to make it spicy.
Along with the momo, soup is also on the list as a side item to the momo.
I would give it a thumbs up and taste it again from here.
Definately it will be on my list.

Back ago when I used to visit this place with my sister and Dad, I used to love their Momos. Their Pan Fried Momos were the best I'd known in town. I kept wanting to go back for it every time but since it's so far from my place somehow I couldn't make it. UNTIL, last week.

AMBIANCE & SERVICE: This restaurant is located taking over the ground floor of a flat. So, there's like a 3 or 4 compartments for the seating. The first one's cool.. the second one, where we were sitting, is basically the hallway. Ambiance is okay. Service is good.

FOOD: Chicken Hot & Sour Soup was neither hot nor sour. It was sweet. Now THAT was a surprise.
I had so high expectations with this place's Momos.. but it turned out, they were the WORST Momos you can have in town. Pan Fried Momos' were real stiff and rubbery. The sauce had this dominating flavour of this red-chili paste. There was no other flavour I could get, no matter what. It was so so bad. We wasted all the rest four Momos.
The Mixed Thukpa was nice. The stalk was flavourful. However, I could get that fishy smell from the prawns in it.

May be, we ordered the wrong stuff but I was highly disappointed with what we ordered. Not going back for a long long time now.

My friends are Momo Plaza loyalists. They introduced me to this place. I am a fan of their chilly garlic noodles.  If you like (really) spicy Chinese food and don't want to splurge this is your go to place. They have no aur conditioning.

It was after a nice stroll at the South Park Street Cemetery on a pleasant Saturday afternoon that we happened to feel hungry and my friend who had been to the place several times quickly zeroed in on Momo Plaza. Situated at Elgin Road just a few steps from the Rabindra Sadan Metro Station the place is really easy to find.

The eatery located at the ground floor of a building is definitely pocket friendly with good quality food... and therefore Bingo! a great hit amongst students like us. The decor was easy on the eye... nothing too fancy but clean and nice , the seating again comfortable. On being seated we were given the Menu card and the food arrived soon after the order, steaming hot momos...

We had ordered a plate of Pork Kothey and another Pork steamed momo. The momos were tasty , the pork delectable, and the soup and the sauces added to the meal definitely. The Kothey was interesting with its two sides of the same momo prepared differently... one side steamed and another fried.. Overall a nice time spent with some great food. Looking forward to the next visit.

I dunno if this place has lost it or never really had it in the first place, but the momos I've had here are ordinary, at best. Though the interior is a touch better than most places of its kind, the staff looked lost and disinterested in taking orders. Not that we had to wait too long once the food was ordered but it took nearly 10 mins for the menu cards to appear on our table. 

Now for the food. We ordered two plates of steamed chicken momos and a couple of bowls of chicken thukpa. The momos weren't piping hot but weren't too cold either. The taste? Bland -- as if they stuffed the dumplings with nothing but boiled chicken mince. The soup that came along with the momos was very good, though -- light, flavourful broth perfectly seasoned and topped with chopped scallions. 

The thukpa came in good portions and was something that I could see myself chugging happily in cold, winter evenings or to soothe my monsoon sniffles. But I have to admit I'd have loved more veggies in my thukpa. At first, it was a little too tangy for my taste but a few drops of soy sauce and a few more of tomato sauce balanced it out nicely. 

The bill rounded up to nearly Rs.400, which I think I'd have been happier to pay if the momos were good. Sadly, they were not. And, that's why I'm not keen to go back. For a place that's been raved about by momo lovers across the city, it has been a poor show!

1st Visit: While searching for a place to have lunch at, we came across this restaurant. The place is neatly organised. The service is a little slow. The food is okay. A budget restaurant in the hub of Rabindra Sadan. 2.5 stars.

2nd Visit: We unanimously decided to visit Momo Plaza on the eve of Poila Boishakh. We chose to order Chicken Pan Fried Momo dipped in Schezwan Sauce and Chilli Chicken. The momos were slightly tasteless but the chilli chicken tasted pretty good. The service was way better than the last time. People who want to curb their fierce appetite without burning a whole in their pocket can try out this eatery. :)

Went to momo plaza with two of my office colleagues-cum-good friends. The ambient was captivating due to the interiors of the shop and the lighting. We ordered Chicken Hakka Chowmein, American Chicken Chopsuey and a platter of Pork Steamed Momo which was served accompanied with a clear soup. My friends and I were amazed by the quality of food. Simply amazing! I did not expect them to be so good after the interaction with the, quite frankly, unprofessional, waiters. I was so very glad that their food proved me wrong and I would most definitely go back for more. :)

Momo Plaza!!
Located opposite Chai break(elgin), It is basically a never ending old house offers Chinese foods, I have been to this place quite a few times & liked their foods earlier but recently we ordered egg hakka chow,egg fried rice & chicken with capsicum. Apart from the chicken the other foods were horrible, we found several stones in the rice & it was burnt too, the eggs in the chow were cold maybe they have added it from the fridge just before serving us, we complaied, the waiter assured us that he will inform it to the kitchen, I dunno weather he informed or not cause he never came back since then, Finally we informed the matter to the manager but surprisingly he was least bothered & was more interested in the payment, finally we gave up & promised never to visit this place again.

Visited this place last Friday along with my friends. This is located right opposite Chai Break on Elgin Road. This place looks small, but has considerable amount of sitting arrangements in various small rooms and corners. 
Coming to the ambiance, it is poor. Tables and glasses are dirty. It takes them forever to take the order and prepare the food. Though moderately priced the food is horrible. We ordered egg fried rice and egg hakka chowmein along with chicken with capsicums. The rice was burnt and had several GRAVELS in them. I mean they aren't tiny, big ones like the size of a pea. The chow was cold and bland. When we told the manager about this, his behaviour wasn't expected. 
I was thoroughly disappointed and going to avoid this place in future.

Must try:
* Thupka portions!
The gravy is so thick and delicious! Filled with veggies and meat. Both pork and chicken thupka are good.
* pork dishes!
Specially red chilli pork. While I like all their pork dishes.
* Momos: love their chicken momo more than the others. The soup taste yum!
* Gravy noodles is good too!

For as many times as I have been to this place, my experiences were always underwhelming, especially since people go nuts about Momo Plaza. Today, it was hugely disappointing. On their menu appear two varieties of fried momo - a deep fried momo, which, according to them, is crispy on the outside, and the other is a regular fried momo, which I expected to have a light char. I went for the latter, and it turned out to be very crispy. The second disappointment was the size - five size 0 Momos for Rs. 85 felt a little too much. I would have still whined less about the skinny dumplings, if the dish had been tasty. Instead, I found the fillings absolutely bland and totally unseasoned. The soup was unseasoned. And the sauce was horrendous. It was super oily, weirdly bitter, with a touch of heat, and nothing else. I had to mix tomato sauce with it to get some tang and sweetness. Nothing, absolutely nothing about the dish was worth the price. Took home some steamed Momos - the dumplings had bits of paper stuck on the outside. The size of the steamed Momos were better than the fried ones, and they even though there was NOTHING remarkable about their taste or flavour, at least they had some salt. The corners and edges were doughy, chewy and hard. I don't know how it is possible, but the soup they packed was even worse than the one I had at the restaurant. No one could touch it, even. In case of both kinds of Momos, the onions tasted almost raw. There's a difference between the fresh taste of onions, and the raw taste. Yes, this taste was definitely raw. The service was fast, but the servers didn't seem to care enough. The last time I had visited, there was something appealing about the ambience. I didn't find that charm today. The honest truth is, it is an overrated placed, and I have no clue what the hype is all about. And I won't encourage anyone to go find out.

If you are looking for some delicious, belly warming and heart pleasing Indo-Chinese food then Momo Plaza will not disappoint. Do not go in looking for fancy interiors. It is dark, it is a tad shabby, but the food delights.    

If you decide to drop in, you must try the  chicken pan fried gravy momos, the prawn and chicken cantonese noodles, dry chilli chicken/fish and definitely the dragon chicken.

These place is pretty awesome because of its ambience and heritage. Low light with gigantic ambience will drove your mind to explore its Chinese items. Mono are really full of chicken stuff instead of onions. Chilly pork is one of it's turn on. Price is not less but standard. Cantonese and gravy items are to good when it is hot. If you visit in summer I advice to choose the table from exterior . Visit and eat well. 😋

Had tried Chilli Roasted Pork and Pan Fried Momo from this place a long time back with my friend. We were just passing by and thought of trying this place. The quantity was sufficient for two of us. The better dish of the evening was the pork. Rich and flavorful, the portions were surprisingly soft. The Momos too were lovely but I prefer the Pan Fried Sauce of Wow Momo better. Definitely recommended if you around.

Momo plaza caters yummy tibetan delicacies. Their steamed chicken momos are awesome. I also like the fried ones. But my personal favourite is thukpa which is less spicy , very tasty himalayan soupy boiled noodles. I have also tried chicken choupsey and chicken soup in momo plaza, and found them quite satisfying to tastebuds. They serve yummy "kothe"s too.Their Chinese preparations are not bad but not as delicious as tibetan ones. The restaurant is economic. But sorry,i cannot write something praiseworthy about the ambience.

Have been to the other tibetan and Chinese restaurants around rabindra sadan hundreds of times but God knows how I missed this place! May b the name suggested only a momo centre! On a cloudy summer afternoon we went to this place for a quick lunch and ordered very basic veg gravy noodles and chilli roasted pork. The amount of the gravy noodles was humongous!! One was sufficient for two people (two equally decent eaters). The chilli roasted pork took my heart away. Such rich aroma and flavour of d dish was just awesome with the plain gravy noodles. The meat was also very well cooked. Had such lovely pork after a long time. Enjoyed the meal thoroughly and shall definitely looking forward to check out the other wonders of the menu.

Momo plaza is an old option for authentic pan Asian delicacies in the city.

**Location**
On the side lanes of the road hitting straight to brand factory Elgin followed by Forum.
Take the first left from the Ranbindra Sadan Metro station if you are walking towards the PC Chandra showroom.

**Experience**
This place has been an good and cheap option for me back in old days. With my every forum visit this place has been in my cards most of the time that time as it is cheap and value for money as well.

Though I haven't visited them recently but still remember last time I came here from my office with all my friends and had a gala time here. 

Momos  soups and noodles everything available is worth a try. The quality they serve in the price is really commendable. 
Wish they keep on serving in same way so that the specially youngsters from school and college gets a chance to make some good memories here.

When I go to any Chinese restaurant for the first time, I always try Momo and soup which they have to offer. I did the same here...but was disheartened.
Cleanliness : Room was clean enough but not the plates...it was also a little bit broken at the side. Not too impressed.
Food : Momo made large in size by thickening the dough...the meat inside was not chopped fine so that it has the property of melting away when having it. Soup : Lung Fung soup was not at all upto the mark...felt like just the name was served and not the name being defined. Vegetables should be finely chopped ...here there were few...the prawn was supposed to be chopped but they provided small shrimps which did not appear fresh...did not even finish it.
All in all am going to think more than twice before going back there again.

Momo Plaza, our hangout destination since the time we were in school. Located in the lane diagonally opposite to Forum's lane. Easy to locate. parking is always a problem! But food is not a problem.
The prices used to be easy on the pockets given the quantity but their price growth has been understandable given the competition.
Their momos, noodles n chicken gravy dishes are commendable.

Man! ive been visiting dis place since i was like 3 or 4 yrs old...with my parents back den, nd now most of the time by myslf or vd my pals. The food is pretty good, nd i rlly cherished the momos frm here. The Chinese and Tibetan recipes dey serve are rlly mouthwatering and are delicious too. The interior ws nice nd proper back den..but since, it has not improved much. Just the outlook seems a bit re- organised. And its not a place where u can hangout with d bunch ur mates..its fine if dere's two or three of 'em. Anywy, just visit fr the food nd nd..yeah! enjoy!

The Momo Plaza, my hangout since school time. The authentic Tibetan place. The restaurant is not very classy but the food is amazing. If you are visiting Kolkata please try this place as you well get the touch of Kolkata Tibetan food. The momo, thuppa, noodles, fried rice and all non-vegetarian dishes are authentic and tasty. This was my all time favorite place and will always will be.

I have visited Momo Plaza once, that also quite a long time back. That time i was not in Zomato.
Went there with a friend to grab a quick lunch. Seeing the interiors i didn't dare to order any main dish (don't know why).
We both settled with 2 plates of steam momos along with soup. Momos tasted like any other mediocre momo serving joint. It was kinda okayish. Actually before coming here, i had heard that this place serves very good momos undoubtedly.
I found nothing like this in the momos. Anyways didnt return here for tasting any other dish so can't comment on it. 

==============================

As I said that I would return to this place for tasting few other dishes here. So I did. What a waste of time and money!!!
I tried their pork momo, mixed fried rice, sechzwan chicken, fried chilli pork & roasted chilli pork.
Except the pork, rest of the dishes were disgusting. My rating goes down to 2.

This place is not recommended at all. Plz don't go and waste your money.

Located at the lane which leads to the Elgin Road Brand Factory building, this small snack outlet is a hit among the students and the shoppers around who urges for a quick bite at cheap yet tangy snacks. 
The outlet is basically an old house with tables and chairs aligned to cater people. There are no ACs and many times I faced an obnoxious irritation in my eyes and nose due to the fact that the kitchen is opened at the end of the house and so the air travel towards the sitting arrangement. The hygiene of the restro is also under question according to me.
However, the food served by them are quite delicious with the Pan Fried Gravy Chicken Momo and Hot and Sour soup being my favorites. The staffs are quite ok with their behavior and serve fast if being asked to.

One of those places where perhaps your mum has visited and chilled after her college. :) Have been going there since a kid. Interiors is nothing extraordinary(it is quite basic) Like the name suggests this is basically known for its momos but you do get other filling items as well. The chicken panfried momos here is to die for! *_* One the few pocket friendly places where you can fill up your stomach and not feel guilty about spending a bomb on food. Must visit guys!

Have travelled past this joint several times, and had been wanting to try it out for quite some time until yesterday I finally got an opportunity. And the experience was a horror.
We ordered a plate of gravy momos and mixed hakka chow. The taste is average and the quantity is good. But the food is not all that makes a restaurant good, is it?
This place is an absolute nightmare in terms of hygiene. The inside is hot and stuffy and the tables and glasses are not really that clean. Same with the floor. Yet we sat down and ordered our food. A few minutes into our food being served, I felt something crawling over my feet. To my absolute disgust, it was a cockroach. Pretty soon there were more than just one of them, and all the customers appeared to be pretty horrified and disgusted. I let the staff know but they seemed to be least bothered. One of them just nonchalantly told me that they had used some sort of roach kill and that was causing all the cockroaches to run around the place.
I've tried out many not-so-clean eateries around the city, but none like this one, yet. Would never revisit.

But the only turn off is the hygiene.
The place looks dirty n d dim lighting adds to the shabbiness.

Momo plaza is a popular joint that serves Chinese and Tibetan delicacies. I have been going to this place for more than 6 years. However my recent visit was not at all satisfactory. Well, the insides were hot and humid. Tables were not cleaned properly, glasses have lip marks on them. The floor was dirty. We overlooked all these and ordered our chicken fried momo. The filling was bland, the soup was shouting, "I was not cooked with care.", but the chutney was good. Then we had dry chilli fish, the preparation looked promising but the fish had a pungent odour, same thing happened with our prawns. If anyone dine here, refrain from ordering fish and crustaceans. The staffs were comparatively less cordial this time, as refiling a jug took more than 30 minutes. A below average experience.

Ok so I had visited this place yesterday ( 3-3-2016) probably my second or third visit in this restaurant till date as it holds a very popular name for Tibetan and Chinese foods among the college going folks nearby as well as others . This place is way different from your regular restaurants having a nice spread out of tables. And as you keep walking inside straight which is like walking through some old vintage property but done up and properly arranged with house rooms into a restaurant which is a creative thing in its own way. Dim chandelier placed all over above giving it a controlled warm atmosphere while you eat .The tables and chairs are mostly plastics and it can only accommodate 4 people in one however there is one big table too which easily is for 6 people . The service behind this restaurant is pretty fast which is a good thing however I strongly don't understand the case of shifting customers from tables to tables as soon as you sit they ask you to sit in their preference seats not yours which I actually kind of feel offensive at times nevertheless my main aim was food so talking about the food factor of this place well I keep hearing good, bad or mixed up reactions among my friend circle and known people so as I lost my serious knowledge behind how this place deals with food I gave it a try to remind myself and the order that I placed was 3 SOFT DRINKS, 1 CHICKEN THUPPA , 1 CHIÇKEN PAN FRIED MOMO and EGG HAKKA CHOW.

Starting with the soft drinks I need to mention the plus point that they have stocked up of all the flavours and choices in drinks which was a great thing and all of them where chilled absolutely a good feeling to be in . The Chicken thuppa had come in a medium size bowl having noodles , soup , veggies chicken pieces and all the necessary ingredients making it an instant hit for me as whether you garnish it or not it tastes awesome . Moving on to the Chicken pan fried momos it was stuffed wholesome with minced chicken inside made with red nice gravy based outside and quite spicy on taste but certainly enjoyable only when its hot as as soon as my last two pieces of momos were cold it tastes just awful.
Lastly the Egg Hakka noodles was a full plate of fried noodles with scrambled eggs on it along with a sufficient amount of veggies. I felt the noodles to be very dry and lack of strength in the taste as well as preparation , however the good thing was it was fully loaded with noodles covering the entire plate I feel two people can eat one plate but considering the blunt taste I don't think so I will order this again any time soon.

To the conclusion I would say that this place has its own magic in Tibetan and Chinese foods and its much much better in terms of taste , pricing , quality and quantity however some things can be taken into consideration like I mentioned about the noodles .So visit this place whenever you are around Elgin road as its a famous place for lip smacking and a hangout point for youth crowd .

Never heard of this place before so I was a bit hesitant at first but the food and ambience won my heart!!
It's a cosy place and really great for couples to have a candle night dinner ( well,some might not agree with me but its from my point of view).
We ordered chicken schezwan momo and pork schezwan momo, oh my they were so delicious. The vibrant texture and the hot and tangy taste of the momos made me realize that I've to visit this place yet again to try out their other items.

Momos in momo plaza are my favourite. Always love to have momos here and I am having them here form last few years. This place is good but in summers, the inner chambers become too hot to sit hence having a meal then is just difficult
This place is exactly what it is called. And most of the dishes other than momos are always unavailable .

I have been eating in momo plaza for quite a long time. I mostly have the chicken momo steamed or friend. There was a time when I liked the place very much, has lunches (long long ago) there. At some point of time we stopped going to this place because of bad food quite frequently. 

Though recent visits changed the views again back to normal. The good point of the restaurant is the cost is pretty good and within small budget. The food you get can be a bit oily, but for those who don't mind it's fine. I won't be able to list down the items which are good at this date, but for me it is a pretty good place to get some momo and ThumsUp quickly within 100 Rs. (For a lower budget and more quicker service but smaller and momo see shop beside Exide building)

Momo Plaza.. A very attractive name for a momo lover. The place is hidden and yet decorated with alot of asian influence. I had gone only to try the momos and saw they had thuppa too. Called for the chicken momo , veg momo and the prawn thuppa. I must say all were good. The spicy chutny with the momos was awsomly spicy. I enjoyed the food and had my sinus' clean by the end of the meal. The only thing that disappointed me was the service. The waiter was not bothered. The owner was a step worse. He was busy watching his daily soap on a television as I kept calling for service. If it weren't for the service I would have rated the place a 4.

The area around Elgin have been quite a momo hub for a long time and probably one of the primary areas to steer the acceptance of momo as a popular fast food option..Apart from Tibetian Delight or Hamro Momo, Momo Plaza have been the other big player in the league but sadly in recent times the quality has degraded much..Located just opposite to Chai Break this joint is situated in an old house with few rooms and alleys jampacked with tables..Kind of stuffy and uncomfortable and the place also lacks a proper exhaust facility..
Mainly frequented by crowds for a plate of hot momos and some evening snacks this place do serve an elaborate array of Chinese and Tibetian dishes.. Coming to the momo I have been visiting this place for quite some time..But last time I went I found the FRIED CHICKEN MOMO to be really lacking in flavour..the stuffing should have been prepared with a bit more share of chicken, lacked the balance and also a bit too greasy..the complimentary Broth served was of no use and tasted more like salted water.. We also sampled DRY CHILLI PRAWN BALLS which was again a disappointment..the sauce was way too salty and the shrimps were a bit smelly..Adding to it Hygiene issues are there as well..Overall the price is even higher than its counterparts, so no incentive on that front either..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 1.5/5

Awesome dumplings , rather one of the best joints in south Kolkata . I happened to visit this place with my friend . they only had momos at that time so we ordered chicken pan fried momo (gravy) and vegetable streamed momo. They only served chicken soup with pan fried momos but not with steamed momos . pan fried momos tasted divine and was served in good quantity . Not at all expensive . do give it a try. :)

Yesterday I along with some of my friends tormented the place. Nice small homely atmosphere, soothing ambience.
Now to start with the food, we ordered the following:
1. Chicken Cantonese noodles
2. Chicken Mushroom soup
3. Pork Chinese chopsey
4. Chicken pan fried momo (red sauce)
5. Veg pan fried momo (red sauce)
All the items were quite delicious but Chinese chopsey could have been better. Foods are moderately priced according to quality.
We ordered 7 dishes (some items doubled) and cold drinks too, which costs us 850 bucks. That's fine I guess. Enjoy ur day. Happy fooding. :)

The place needs to really do something abt its arrangement of tables near thr restroom. It was a bit ugly to get the smell of urine in a restuarant.

Last Saturday i had dinner in this Dine in.I'm a frequent visitor in this restaurant.I must say that the behaviour of the staffs need to be more polite.I was looking for a table which could accommodate 6 people but no one was there to assist.I had chicken momo,chicken dry chilly,mised cantonese noodles,american chopsuey,singapore chicken.foods were moderate.No sign of cleanliness was shown to the customers.Flies can be spotted everywhere.Location was good.

This eatery is located just near the Rabindra Sadan metro station opposite to Chai Break. If you want to taste Chinese dishes but you don't have much money in your pocket then only its the right place for you. Qualitatively the food is not so impressive but quantitatively its very economic. Ambience is really average but the dim lights are pretty nice. Interiors are very dull.

Good pocket friendly outlet for having some Chinese. Good for friends outing.. Quantity is pretty good and food tastes fine as well.. Not much of a pocket pinch. Place is small hence be prepared to wait outside if you are planning on a weekend!

This place used to serve good food at affordable price during our college days but my recent visit has really left me dissapointed.we had ordered veg cantonese noodles,crispy chilli babycorn n chicken hakka noodles.and to my surprise each of the dishes were fighting a very close battle among themselves to be rated as the worst  dish of that day.chilli babycorn had a burnt smell n their was hardly any chkn in chkn hakka noodles.even a  roadside para stall would have served a better noodle.

Very disappointed with my last visit. they are supposed to be the best in that area. but their standard has dropped so much. I ordered chicken steamed momo and chicken hakka noodles. the momo was too dry and sticky. the chicken stuffing has small ginger pieces as well which should have been more finely chopped. the clear soup along with it was just fine. the chicken noodles tasted poor, less salty,less spicy and it was cold by the time we started having it.
Overall very bad experience.

Momo plaza used to be one of my favourite food joints but recently the quality has degraded unbelievably. 
The momos are good . chilli chicken,mixed fried rice served is okay.
Chicken drumsticks are really bad .

It's a very old joint... used to visit the place during college times or after watching movies in Nandan... at that time our pocket permits for having pan fried chicken momo gravy... its just awesome.. still the taste sticks in my tongue... but recently due to increase in number of food  joints and restaurants in the town... forgot to give a visit for a long time... I have also tried there mixed fried rice and chilli chicken... but that experience was not as good as pan fried momo... deco was pretty ordinary... staffs are good... service was also ok... and more importantly pocket pinch was friendly...

I went there around a month back on a Saturday evening. The place was buzzing with people although we were lucky to find a table for six. We ordered their Schezwan Pan Fried Pork Momo, Steamed Pork Momo and Pan Fried Pork Momo (okay, yes, we are BIG fans of pork! :P). Compared to its nearest competitors (Tibetan Delight and Orchid), the price is slightly higher at more than Rs 100 for the pan frieds. However, the quality was great. The momos were bursting with stuffing and their sauces were yummy. We wanted to order other pork dishes, but sadly they were out of it! I'd recommend the place only if you are a momo enthusiast.

This place has a cult following but man do the servers have an attitude. This is no fine dining place but the interiors can be maintained a bit better. Leaking water from basin nearly slipped and fell there.The waiters have huge attitude which I guess is a result of the huge clientèle they have. Absolutely rude.Only had chicken steamed momo there as I couldn't stomach neither their food or attitude. Ps chicken steamed momo priced at rs 85 or so was absolutely not worth it. Some road side stalls make better momo. Never going back

Visited this place yesterday... have heard of it quite often as a nice place for momos, but I would rate it as an average one. The momos were little bit extra oily than usual which you can ignore if you are not a fitness buff. But the soup that was served with it, tasted like plain water, with few drops of oil in it and fewer vegetables. That is something you can not ignore.

Cheap and quality momo joint near Elgin. We tried steamed and fried momo (with gravy) and it was quiet tasty. The soup that accompanies the momo is just flavoured water and few drops of oil.  The seating arrangement can be better, the gas from the kitchen disrupts the ambiance.

Been to this Momo plaza yesterday (25/09/2015) after abt 7 years, but found what a drastic down gradation. Asked for 6 steamed Momo > not possible, one plate 5 pc@ 75/- for 1 more momo have to take full 1 more plate.So had to take kothey Momo ( first steamed then lightly fried> you can't stop the frying even if u don't want), and the accompanied soup?? Ha ha just a bowl of chicken powdered hot water, any roadside handcart Momo sellers soup is much better than that. Chicken thupka, 7 years before when we couple were 7 years younger, having more intake capacity, then could not finish 1 bowl of thukpa, but now @ age almost 58 felt had hardly any input into the stomach after finishing 1 bowl so called thupka, it is 85% water,10% veg and 5% chicken hahhh. So ordered 1 plate hakka chicken chow.....any roadside,open ,office area ,footpath chow mein sellers makes better than that. Lastly service? Better don't ask. No body bothers whether your table's glasses are dirty or not, water is there in the jug or not, all sauces are there in the pot or not, and lastly after finishing 1 item if you require anything else or not....only while paying at the cash counter, the stewards will be very active> expecting some tips. Informed manager / person sitting in cash about lack of service, instead apologizing rather supported his staff, we have less people > hahh.. So then why not taking less money? No cards accepted, only cash. It's just running on its old fame, but don't go and waste your money and appetite here. Found lot of young gangs has filled up all the seats at another nearby small Momo shop ' Humro momo' , but couldn't taste it as there were no place vacant, where as this age old Momo plaza's 80% seats were vacant...Sad

Small shabby place with 7 or 8 tables.
Ordered a plate chicken steamed momos and a prawn hakka noodles. The momos were thick and doughy but the filling was nice. The clear soup served along with the momos was fabulous. The noodles was ordinary with very small prawns.
Caution: the place isn't well maintained, dirty dishes were present beside the washbasin and I also saw a few dead cockroaches lying underneath the tables.

Monmo plaza needs no introduction to foodies and momo lovers in Kolkata. It has a following of its own. But can't say I am very impressed; its quite dingy for my choice.  The interiors are not very impressive. Now moving on to the food. Today I visited and had ordered chicken mono, pork chilly and chicken thukpa. The mono was not steamed well enough for my choice. The chicken was not tender. The dough was just d and raw. The thukpa was nice, fragrant but there was a smell of mud in the soul as if the veggies were not washed properly. 
The saving grace was the pork momo. It was spicy and well cooked and served in good portions. Although not the best I have had, certainly better than what I had ordered here. 
The price is the only good factor that can attract me to this place in case I crave for chilly pork at low cost. The order came upto 315/-.  For momo, I certainly have better options.

It's a joint located on elgin just to the opposite of chai break.Love the momos.They serve excellent soups with numerous succulent pieces of chicken in it.Their chilli pork is something that you must try.Decent noodles and fried rice.Their schezuan chicken has to be one of the spiciest in kolkata.It's lip-smacking nonetheless. The only drawback is that there is no air conditioning which is kinda unbearable taking kolkata's hot climate into account.I hope they would do something about it,soon.

Have visited Momo Plaza umpteen number of times for their lipsmacking momos. My orders are somewhat repetitive there, as I almost always order Chicken Steamed and Pork Steamed Momos. Thukpas are also good. Noodles though little oily but nevertheless can be tried if you are too hungry. The place may seem a little untidy, and that's the only con.

This used to b a good momo joint once but sadly now it has lost its charm. This plce used to serve delicious chicken and pork momos( tht was probably the onlt good thing about the place) . Last time i went i was very dissapntd. 

There ia nothing called a decor or ambience anymore..just tables here and there. We order the chicken momos , hakka chow and a chickn dish. There was a time the momos used to b great..from there it just seemed ok now..the hakka chow wasn't that tasty and the chickn dish was very oily and spicy.

I am avoiding this place in future. But anyone wants to try they can feel free.

Okay so on a particular rainy day i had a sudden craving for momos...but considering that i am nearly ayways broke i decided to try out this place which is very pocket friendly..it is localted in elgin road near the rabindra sadan metro station. It has a very small space. The lights are dim...and it does not have much of an appeal...anyways getting past it i ordered chicken momo, pan fried pork momo (dry), chicken kothay and chicken drumsticks. The chicken momos were excellent. The kothay lacked salt. The pan fried momo was also very good. The chicken drumsticks were a dissapointment...the chicken was very chewy and a bit undercooked. The thing that i fell in love with was the broth accompanying the momos. It was heavenly.. Overall its 'ok'. You can visit this place if you want to enjoy some yummy tibetian food at a reasonable price.

Still has its flavour but somehow not like old days. The Fried Momo is something you can still try with Mixed Hakka Noodles.
Good for Office lunch with your colleagues quite economic. Weekends its a rush still you need to wait
Small request to Management if you can please work on the sitting arrangements the seats inside you can decorate the place to make it looking more appealing  and also try to bring the old taste back

The gang decided to hit this place afrer hearing lots of positive reviews.. From the exterior look it looks like a residential place, which it originally probably is.. But modified.. Cleanliness is an overlooked factor.. Service was a bit inattentive and slow but that wasn't much of a problem for us as we wete engrossed in out own share of talks and stories.. Coming to the food... It's good, not great but not average either.. In reasonable prices.. The gravy of chicken pan fried momo was really really hot.. And we were seriously disappointed for the unavailability of any shezwan dish... The chilly pork really took the prize.. It was well cooked with the right amount of juices intact.. The seasoning was nice and the crunh of the side onions and capsicum was superb.. Salt may be a bit too much for few tongues but that really differs from person to person.. The Chicken and mushroom side dish was marvellous.. Creamy juicy and perfectly balanced..
All in all, this place is a great hit if you're looking for a quick bite of Cantonese or Chinese food in a pocket friendly situation..

I had heard a lot about this place and frankly saying I am disappointed. Went there with  my friend during an Inter School fest as our tummies were knawing from hunger pangs. Decor is below par! This is a restraunt not a street side shanty for me not to mind the decor.. Staff members are horrendous and service snail like! Coming to the food, the Fried Chicken Momo with gravy was the only thing that I enjoyed! Size of the pieces were okay and the dish had proper balance and seasoning. Pork Hakka Chowmein was dull and bland. Nothing except oil according to me could be tasted and I was lucky to find even a few pieces of pork in it! The Chilli Pork was okay. I was happy with the way the Pork was cooked, tender and moist but the dish was lacking in the flavour and smell which I have to come to expect from Chilli Pork as a North Eastern. The quantity offered was also good but it was nothing extraordinary considering the price! To sum up :I AM DISAPPOINTED

An evening hunger strike led me and my besties to this cozy place right on Elgin Road. Easy to spot, just 2 min walk from Ravindra Sadan and on the opposite of Fifth Element and Chai Break,  Momo plaza seemed like a residential place converted to a small food outlet. 
Ambiance - Though they don't boast of a sprawling carpet area, the place is well lit and clean, though gets a little uncomfy in the humid Kolkata climate due to lack of AC. 
Food - They are known mostly for their tibetan delicacies, we played safe with pan fried momos and thukpa. 
1. Schezwan Pan fried Pork Momo ( dry ) - Loved the subtle use of garlic and Schezwan spices, the momos had a translucent texture and I am not a big fan of deep frying momos, so thumbs up for keeping the crispness optimum. The pork filling was well cooked as well.
2. Schezwan Pan fried pork Momo (gravy) - the gravy kind of dampened the flavor. The Schezwan gravy was more on the sweeter side and was not anything like a Schezwan although it tasted well.
3. Mixed Thukpa - It was an absolute delight. A hot,hearty bowl full of broth, with boiled noodles, abundant portion of egg, chicken, prawns and boiled vegetables gave it an amazing flavor. Would love to have it during the winters.
Service - the area they really have to work upon. Waiting time for our order was like 25 mins. They really have to speed it up a bit. Rest is well.

Overall, an enjoyable casual dining experience within a really pocket friendly budget. Cheers!

Located at a very Shadowed place, very hard to get.... The outside looks dirty , not much decorated neither you will find inside it.... But, it has Got a Special Charm .... Although the place is not spacious and a bit clumsy you will enjoy once you get inside.... I heard that its the FIRST CHIENESE Restaurant in Kolkata .....
Anewy, you must try the Momos here...Must !!! The Chilly CHICKEN with the Mixed Fried RICE is my favorite dish here....
MUST COME IF you love CHINESE FOOD ...
What I felt , they must Decorate the place a bit and also play some Tracks inside .... and the Most important , the servicing is too slow .... had to wait for almost a half an hour....

It was delightful to see the closest to authenticity Chinese and Tibetan food over here. The variety in the menu is great and the taste is really appreciable. Lots of authentic Tibetan food, varying from very spicy to lesser one. The joint is a small one in the ground floor of an old building. One might find almost every time a queue for the seats which authenticate its popularity. Ambience is ordinary and service is of typical dhaba style. Pricing is okay in respect to food quality being served.

The restaurant is normal..... Food is normal..... Ambience is normal....... They have a nice collection of momo. But other food is quite bad. I tried mixed hakka chowmin. But astonishingly the ingredients like chicken or prown or pork ar cold like not cooked after taking out of the refrigerator. That's makes the food weird.

I went to this place after numerous recommendations from popular newspapers and friends. Where do I start? Unfriendly and uncourteous staff, cold momos, burnt chowmein,  harmful chemical colouring agents in the name of schezwan 'sauce' and rotten food are par for the course here. I have given this restaurant many tries and won’t try again or recommend this over-hyped place to anyone at all. There is nothing ‘heritage’ about this place. Give this place a visit if you like your food cold and stale with a horrible stench emanating from it! Oh and I forgot to mention that a liquid is served here with momo in a bowl bearing a distinct taste of detergent! People there call it soup, we call it bleach!

Have always heard a lot about this place being one of the oldest momo places in the city. The ambience is major boo but has a classic 'Indian coffee house' feel to it. The steam fried and pan fried versions were both nice. The difference between schezwan and pan fried is distinct and understandable and not just same gravy for all. The food was delicious,service was okay.

This place is very close to Brand Factory. I went there a number of times. The place has a touch of old Kolkata as the restaurant is in an old building which always had an advantage in my case. Their steamed chicken momo,its worth experiencing atleast once in lifetime. Other than that,you can go for their sanghai chicken,schn. Fried rice too. They cook the food really in a healthy way,using less oil.

They just survive on the ashes of their glorious past..horrible food and service. They have not been able to cope up with the demands of hospitality with the passage of time. The attitude of take or leave is absolutely unpardonable, especially when you are in the hospitality industry. Food is just average, so had to shift my momo allegiance to a much descent outlet in wood street which infact delivers to our office in Russell Street.

Location: Just as one enters elgin road from Ashutosh Mukherjee road, on the right side.

My visit: visited it today around 7:45 pm (20th June) for a quick Momo's meal. I ordered a veg pan fried Momo with gravy and Sprite 200ml bottle.

Ambience: from outside the place looks small as front facing side is cramped up and has look of a small outlet. The reddish light and interior gives a hazy look and it has a joint kind of a feel.As I entered I found three sections due to architechture, one at the entrance having 4 tables with 4 chair each, one just near the kitchen (uncomfirtable) and last one in the interior with 4 tables ( which is nice) (3/5)

Food: I liked what I was served. The taste was descent and didn't disappoint (3.5/5)

Service: it was ok. The waiter did not help with menue and looked least bothered about it. He simple took order and left. The order was ready in 15-20 min. So descent I have to say (3/5)

Hygiene: again descent. The table was clean and tissue paper was served with dish. The place near the kitchen was a bit filthy though.  Average (3/5)

Value for money: order cost less than INR 100/- and quantity was good enough.Good. (3.5/5)

Overall experience:descent (3.5/5)

Recommend: experience depends on which section you get the seat, so not sure

I was a frequent visitor of this place during my school and college days and needless to say this place served delicious momos during those days. I remembered the very name of this place would make us crave for their delicious momos and we use to rush to this place like anything. But all this is past glory now. Momo plaza now serves momos which can be quite comparable to the ones sold by roadside vendors. I went to this place few days back and was highly disappointed with the degraded quality of food. We ordered pan fried momo(both gravy and dry),lung fung soup and dry chilli chicken. The momos were the worst i have ever had in recent times....they were dry,the flour coating was too thick and extremely leathery. The chicken portions were very small. The gravy was way too spicy and overflowing in the plate. The dry chilli chicken was good though it tasted much better in previous years. The chicken pieces were not at all succulent and juicy. The only likeable item was the lung fung soup. It had a very nice taste and was ample in amount and it was a saviour in the otherwise disastrous served food. The price of the food was alright. Honestly,though i loved this place earlier as it holds many special memories from my college days i am not going back anytime soon for their food again and would definitely not recommend it for trying out momos as there are much better options available around the city.

Whenever I am anywhere near this place i cant resist myself going there because of their mouth watering chinese dishes.
This place not only serves great momos but also a wide variety of other chinese items at a reasonable price. The quality of the food is good & reliable and the amount is also good enough. It can be easily spotted in exide area. If u r looking for an affordable place to have lunch or dinner then momo plaza is the right one. Even though few days back i tried thukpa there, it didnt taste that good but the cantonese was delicious. My personal favourite is chopsey out there. And dont go by the name, it serves many more dishes other than variety of momos.

I had heard a lot about this place and was eagerly waiting to go there. But recently when I gave this place a visit I was disappointed. I had ordered pan fried momos. The gravy was good but the momos werent properly cooked and neither they were ready to replace it with cooked ones. So I guess this place is not what it used to be. So i will think twice before going again.

Needless to say, they serve great momos. The momos are a bit smaller in size, a bit slippery but the filling is good.
Soups, as usual, tastes heaven if you are feverish and is craving for some hot soup.

We(my bf n me) found this place, one fine day..on our way back from office. The first thing i liked abt this place is..they still serve you the 'clattering of the cutlery and the constant buzz of happy conversation'. The food is okay,however I love their thukpas. The place is pretty hot and stuffy during summer, so winter will be the right time to drop by. The place is not very costly, so it is definitely worth a try.

I used to hear friends rave about this place a few years back but somehow I never had a chance to eat there myself. So the last time when I was at Rabindra Sadan I decided to grab a quick bite.

The place has a cool air, I mean literally cool air, which is a treat in Kolkata's heat. I decided to stick to the basic and ordered pork momos. The order took some time to arrive . The momos were nice, the soup though was exceptional. Also the service was rather slow.

This is a good place for a quite snack on a budget. Just don't expect any firecrackers.

Once upon a time there was a Momo Plaza quite famous obviously for serving momos but nowadays only the skeleton remains. I feel really bad to say that this place has lost its charm. Gone are the days when we used to be actually excited because we were on our way to Momo plaza for some super delicious & hot chicken/pork momos. 
This place has never been or even claimed to be fancy, very humble decor, some chairs and tables thrown here and there the only good thing about them were their momos! Fried or steamed doesn't matter they used to be super delicious. Upon my last ( probably the last time indeed ) visit we ordered a chicken Hakka chowmein and obviously their supremely famous steamed chicken momos and a pork Momo, since I don't eat pork can't comment on how that was ( I was told it was good ) but my chicken Momo was not seasoned and instead of minced chicken I could only taste finely chopped onions! And the worst thing was the entire thing was dry! How can a Momo be dry?! It's supposed to be juicy from inside with all the chicken stalk if I am not mistaken. 
As far as the noodles was concerned it was drowning in a pool of oil! We literally had to eat Hakka chowmein floating on a bed of stinky oil. I guess that was it, I ain't coming back here not until they do something about their standard. As it is the place looks like an aftermath of some natural disaster. Staff looks primarily bored and gives you angry look from time to time if you ask whether "my food is ready yet"! Scary! 
I ain't going back here if you do and get scared don't come back and say I didn't warn you! Haha

Amidst the mixed reactions I had a pretty good experience here. It was my first time and I liked the food quite well. I had ordered pork fried momos, chicken drumsticks and fish fry. I had no complaint about the food except that they tested our patience. We had to wait for quite sometime before we could stuff our stomachs. Otherwise it was fine enough, the quality of the food as well as the  ambience.

Momos. Thukpas. Noodles. Chicken. Pork. Foodie heaven! What more does one want? And the price is quite reasonable aswell. A small joint with an inside room. It's mostly crowded and that goes to show its popularity. The service can be a tad bit slow. But once the food reaches you. There's no complaining!

One of the most pathetic experiences of my life. Poor ambiance, cold momos and hair in my food. An extremely over-spiced sauce was on the table that wasn't probably replaced for an entire week or maybe more. Fried momo managed to fill the stomach somehow but the paneer inside spoiled that too. I was confused whether my experience was bad or my luck. The adamant waiter and the arrogant owner couldn't even manage to shove an apology, if not serve with one. All the hype for the place and my experience only reminds me of a proverb i learnt in school, "All That Glitters Is Not Gold"

Well, to be honest, it was quite overrated, the meat was not so much tender. Nothing much special of that sort.

I visited this place just a few days back. On entering I felt I was entering an 1980's snack bar.. I had assumed this place to be way dirty but thankfully it wasnt.. the steamed momo was quite tasty and the filling was satisfyng and proper (usually its adulterated with cabbage and onions).. The pan fried momos were a bit chilli overdose and I literally had tears.. But overall its quite decent to hav a quick snack or a brunch without digging a hole in ur pocket!

I have been here only once and had a very very average experience. The ambiance was clumsy and suffocating. The tables, sauce pots and dishes were not clean and fresh. Still I was expecting some surprisingly tasty momo as there are legendary places in the city with very average ambiance but extraordinary food. But nothing like that happened. The momo was of very average taste and quality. The red sauce was having too much pungent smell and it was not fresh. Then came the chicken hot and sour soup. It was not tasty but a thick broth too much dominated by so-called green chilli sauce. The menu card was having lots of items but all surprisingly less price than the average standard in the city. Basically, it is pocket-friendly but compromising quality and hence taste. Badly needs improvement.

It has been nearly 7 years relationship with momo plaza.. Whenever I am around rabindra sadan, I managed to hv some 'pet puja' here. The decor,the 'dim' lights, the couples sitting around..this is momo plaza fr u..a old city charm..no show off..only gd food..some may complain with the stained plate..not so 'clean' environment.. Bt belv me it is food that matters isn't it? Or is it the well dressed workers,high priced half heartedly made food?..they will give u enough time decide ur menu..no hurry.. Which I liked..today we tried chickn khotey which is very good..It is momo..half fried half boiled..But tastes new.. Thanx 
P.s. don't worry they plates are very clean ;)

Very good food and it was such a surprise too! I could not have imagined such a heaven was waiting for me inside, going by the decor outside! The spicy sauces added a zing to my then boring life! I had gone out with some new friends after the hugest heartbreak of my life and I now believe those spices were the first ones to start sending me zooming out of that!

Talking about evening snacks Momos and thukpas have become one of the most desirable and delectable dishes that gambols on our taste buds. We ordered a bowl of  chicken clear soup and a plate of steamed momo. Since I like originality in terms of food so I sticked to the steamed version. Each piece of the momos were very soft and friendly to my tasste buds as I was able to savour every chunk of steamed and well salted chicken under my tongue. Now coming to the soup, it played its role well. Because I got a bit hungry after I drank the last sip from the bowl. In and all, I would like to visit Momo Plaza again....

Easy to locate (elgin road almost opposite chai break and 5th element) Momo Plaza is one of those places serving you up chinese  and Tibetan dishes without any ambient frill . Needless to say that the interiors are non-descript with simple wooden tables and chairs . We ordered a pan fried chicken momo and a chicken pot –sticker (here known as  Kothey)…. And I just have to say this I did not like any of them ! The coatings were way to thicker and floury for my liking and the fillings tasted somewhat stale and dry … it was such a disappointment ! Given the fact that momo has made it into the list of our regular snacking and almost every street vendor to posh dining places serving them up… I was not expecting this. I would reconsider twice before next visit to this place

Been visiting this place since college. This place hasn't changed a bit. Same dimly lit room, same staff, same dirty tables, yet their food quality has sharply declined over the years!!.
However, I still like to visit this place. Everyone says this place has the best pork food. I dont eat pork much, so can't tell.
But what I can do tell, low on budget, always visit this place. Ample food, so so quality n very easy on pocket.
U might not like this place the 1st time...but then I just grows on u.

Perfectly featured in great momos. The place is having moody cooks, most of the times they are at your favour but sometimes they do dishearten you. 
Mixed Chowmien is too good.
Best place to be with your friends. 
And date your girlfriend away from the crowd in the lunch hours.
Pocket friendly.
Well behaved staff. An nice eatery and a good ambience.

.Mixed Chowmein must
.Take a momo and talk as much as u want.

The ambience is nice and cozy...an old world charm about it. It looks like an old house converted into a restaurant....nothing flashy or expensive but nice and clean.

The momo, which is their speciality, is good. Although the filling was not as juicy as the momo that you get in Darjeeling :) The clear soup to go with the momo is nice...kind of tries to make up for the lack of juice in the momo filling.

The sauce etc. is OK..Tried other stuff on the menu such as the chowmein and fried rice...these are also OK, though nothing exceptional...

Overall, a great bang for the buck! mostly a good place for having momo in the city...

Whenever I am in vicinity of the Elgin Road area, I try to eat out here! The ambience is not that great, just like an old little house. They serve Tibetan and Chinese cuisines, and they certainly do a good job! I love the food here. More than the momos here, I love fried rice, noodles and other chicken delicacies. My favourite here is the Schezwan fried rice, which is absolutely delicious! This place is mainly good for take out purposes.

If I am around Elgin Road and I am in a mood to have momo Tibetan Delight has always been my fav choice but the day was 28th Dec and there was too much crowd and so it compelled me to visit Momo Plaza and give it a try. Momo plaza was also having a queue but thanks to it bigger size than Tibetan Delight we didn't had to wait for a long time. As soon as we entered we were given the menu card and so we ordered a Chicken Hot and Sour soup, Chicken Pan Fried Momo and Pork Thukpa. All the dishes were so-so and I didn't find anything special.

En route to the National Theatre Festival at Rabindra Sadan and the day being a friend's birthday, we were looking for a place to have some evening snacks. I started looking for one of my personal favourite Tibetian Delight, but lost our way and bumped into Momo plaza. Its situated right opposite the popular Chai Break. From the outside, the place looked cramped as all I could make out was a tiny room but as soon as we set out feet inside, I was quite taken aback as gradually one little room led to another and then another. Finally we were comfortably seated at one of the farthest room. Being in a hurry, we ordered a plate of Chicken Chowmein and Chicken Momo with gravy. The chowmein arrived within 10 minutes. I have no complaints regarding the quantity as the quantity was huge. But what irked me were the ingredients- there was nothing else in it except a few pieces of chicken, egg tit bits, capsicum, carrots, onions and a few sprigs of spring onion- each of which are present in the chowmein they make at the local roll centres and sell for not more than 70 bucks. This might taste a little better than that but expect nothing else. And now let's come to the momo. The gravy had lots of schezuan sauce, tomato and chillies in it, making it super hot and spicy. The fillings inside tasted so so. Nothing to talk about. And for the clear soup, I would suggest to add few slices of chicken, and more garlic so that it tasted like a clear soup apt for momo and less like cornflour. I would not recommend this place for momo for sure.

The chicken they used was not of good quality and was not properly cooked. Asked waiter for a bottle of 7up, he came back with a bottle of thumbs up -_- Would go there one more time just to try their momo! That's all!~

Mono plaza is a place very close to the heart. Me and a friend of mine decided to drop in to have some of their specialities. This place is easy to locate as it is right opposite Chair Break on Elgin Road. You would definitely have to wait if you are visiting on a weekend. Good momos are available in quite a few place as you have a sizeable population of Tibetan population here. But I chose to start off with the Thukpa. The Mixed Thukpa was very good in terms of the portion. Quite big to quench your thirst and fill your belly. It was mixed and there was good amount of egg, prwan, chicken and pork. The best part is that one does not have to add anything because the Thukpa is itself very nicely flavoured. It tastes perfect. The Chilli Pork is also worth a try. Chunks or rather thick strips of pork cooked in soya sauce and shoots is also exquisite. 
We ordered a pan fried momo right at the end but was a tad bit disappointed. It was very sweet and did not taste that good. This is below an old house so please do not bother about cleanliness. 
P.S : Thukpa!! Thukpa!! Thukpa!!

The momos are superb. The chicken deep fried momo is just too good.And the clear soup which they give with momo is bettr than the momo.Infact I order momo for the soup. I know its lil wierd. Another Favourite dishes of mine is the Chicken Schezwan Chowmein with Singapore Chicken.
The prices are reasonable.
I go regularly but I never get bored.

Just for fun we friends entered here while we were returning from forum a year ago. a small restro with low lights . not the restro to flaunt about the ambience. As the name suggests momo plaza we ordered normal steamed momos. The taste was good & was worth it. However recently again we went there and ordered the same steamed momos. It was horrible taste. Complete dissatisfaction it was. The soup was awful and unhygienic . I don't want to recommend it now .

Well again Momo's and a bit more this time. Located in Elgin Road again. Very near to the Rabindra Sadan Metro station, it's a nice place to have Tibetan dishes and not hard to locate. I have been there thrice and tried different things each time. All in one.

Well i have had Chicken Szechuan Pan Fried Momo's and i liked it. Met my taste of a bit spicy stuff and with quite good a stuffing inside, nicely fried as well, it's worth a try.

Moving on to the Chow. I had egg chow and the quantity was good for one person and with fair amount of egg pieces, it was quite satisfying to sum it up.

Now. Thupka. Well. I had no idea what this meant, my friend suggested. So had it. It's like a gravy chow thing with moe gravy than normal as i found out. Chicken Thupka it was and honestly, i was disappointed as i found it pretty tasteless. The sauces even couldn't add much to it. Money wasted. Much in quantity but lacks quality. Atleast i didnt find it good enough. Will not have it again. Go for the momo's mainly. They are good enough.

Well it's a strange place to be in because it feels like we are in someone's home. Different rooms. Dining areas. A small congested place. Dimly lit until you get a place in the corner room. Which is still fairly lit. Homely atmosphere.

Price is quite reasonable and if someone wants variety in a reasonable range in a less hyped place yet average or a tad above. You can definitely try this place out. Wont be a waste of money fully until you order a " Thupka " ????

I have been to momo plaza for an uncountable number of times obviously for the momo. However, one of the most memorable experience here would when me, S and few of few of S's friends came here, last Pujas. No wonder, I liked it. Pujas+lots of friends+momos. You cannot be disappointed with a good bite of momo. 

We ordered a lot of things that included pork momo, chicken momo, chicken thukpa and pork fried rice. Firstly, let's talk about the momos since it has them in their restaurant name. The momos are very good, not exactly the oozing, juicy type, but the type that would make you mumble "Aah, momos". The soup, which is the main accompaniment with the momo is a delicious one. You would always find the soup very enjoyable. It might not be a juicy, oozing momo, but it certainly is a soft one with a lot of filling in it. Now to jump to the thukpas. I am not a very big fan of broths and soups, so I would not comment much on it as I would be biased while giving my opinion on them. However, the thukpa is fresh and definitely is an option for you when you want something hot to warm you up. The fried rice is just ordinary, like any other pork fried rice would be. The pork pieces seemed like a bit overlooked as they turned pretty hard.

Overall, a nice meal but a better experience. If you are momo plaza, do try the momos and mostly nothing else. The decor of this place is minimal and it has a very homely atmosphere with just plain rooms with tables calling you for a homely food experience.

This,being situated near my school, was a place to grab a bite whenever we craved for momo. The momos, though not best in town, are very tasty indeed. The szechuan momo and the pork momo are spicy and delicious. The thupka tastes great. They also serve average Chinese food.  The ambience is not much good and the place can be filled with strange smells. But the place is a huge crowd-puller for being very pocket-friendly and serving a great quantity at such affordable prices.

Momo plaza located at Elgin Road, near rabindra sadan metro, has been a frequent  place since my college days. Specially, after Brand factory came up, and after the shopping spree, we used to sit in here to worship the hunger. I will not say they do the best momos in town, but they are one of the best surely. The steam ones are not so good, and I personally prefer their schezwan or gravy momos. Spicy yet good. I have also tasted the ThUkpa and Fried rice, chilly pork, chilly chicken here. Pork was okay, rest dishes were also average. Thukpa was great! 
The ambience is not a great one though, non-AC, and also damp at times with strange smell. Price is very much affordable, and quantity is enough also.
A must visit for the MOMO lovers.

This is one of the favorite place I prefer having momos. I had chicken and pork pan fried, fried, steamed momo. Once I ate mixed thukpa which tasted good also.
During summer, I preferred to order 'lemon chicken' which tastes delicious and kept me get going under the scorching Sun.
The food quality and quantity can be shared by two easily except momos.

The ambience is NOT good and the staffs are NOT well-mannered. They treats you as per your ORDER. If you order less expect getting cold vibes. Once you are done with payment, they prefers you go out of the place as soon as possible as they have limited sittings.
Another BAD point is that the place is not hygienic.
I had a view of the kitchen which is awful. stinky black pans are being used. 

But the digestion process left me out of any issues. That's why I can't make a stop in visiting this place.

Momo plaza is a pocket friendly restaurent, I must say..
The pan fried momo is d super one among them.. I just love the tangy taste of the pan fried gravy..
But the side dishes are more or less so so..
Not so good...
After completing shopping from brand factory, its a good place for foodings..
But the cons are the soups are not so good..
In one sentence, Momo lovers best place is Momo plaza..

Practically a fan of the place! seriously speaking whenever am in the Bhowanipore area, this is the place that pops into mind first whenever I plan to get a quick bite. The pan fried momos they serve are simply yummylicious! the rest of the food are quite good, and they don't burn a hole in your pocket which makes me visit that place often. Ambiance isn't something remarkable but if you manage top get a corner seat, Voila! you are in for a romantic food-outing :D

My all time favourite place to hang out with friends.Though sometimes I find the service a bit slow,but it won't be a problem if one goes with a large gang.And what I always have there is chicken pan fried momo.Corn soups,rice items and chicken dishes are also delicious.  Although Prawn dishes are not quite satisfactory.

Went there yesterday after reading some good reviews about the place, almost wasted an hour until we found the outlet. And here goes the sad part. I ordered Pan fried chicken schezwan momo, and all I was served was just a regular plain normal momo with too much of tomato gravy which wasn't hot and spicy like regular schezwan sauce, plus the soup was just hot water and tasted bad. With taste like this I wonder if anyone else was this disappointed like me! Never gonna visit this place again, even if I go I won't have this one for sure!
If you want your schezwan momo to exactly taste like schezwan then you should think twice before placing an order!I rated one because the cold drink I ordered was cold!

Momo plaza is nearby to my workplace and thus I tend to visit this place at every chance I get. The Pan fried chicken momo is great. The chicken kothey is okayish, nothing extraordinary. Noodles and the other side dishes are good. The waiters have become quite familiar and so they are quite friendly. Overall a good restaurant.

Came to know about this place from Telegraph......was roaming around in the Elgin road area and suddenly I had a craving for dumplings.......This place serves one of the best Tibetan food in Kolkata without burning a hole in your pocket........I am originally from Shillong and I had my fair share of Tibetan food, especially momos, but the Chicken Pan fried momos I had here were simply heavenly.......My first experience of this place was so good, that I visited this place again within the short span of time that I was in Kolkata. This time with a friend......had a steaming bowl of Pork Thukpa and a veg steamed momo........The thukpa was simply awesome...........

So, in short, this restaurant is and should be a perfect haunting place for students and teenagers as it serves great food at really affordable prices...........

There are hundreds of roadsidse stalls who sell momos with fillings of pork,mutton,chicken,vegetables,etc.Although they are available at a throwaway pice but they do a lot of compromise with their quality.They are unhygienic and tend to upset your stomach.On the other hand,there are several chains of restaurants which charge a bit hefty price but maintain a strict policy when it comes to their quality and quantity.

         One such outlet offering good quality momos at reasonable prices is MOMO PLAZA near the Brand Factory,Elgin Road.Although it offers a diverse variety of chinese and tibetan cuisine but still it is best known for its momos.It has a lot of picks to choose from for the non-vegetarians.But for the veggies,the options are a bit limited when it comes to momos.

         I,being a pure vegetarian,had five varieties to choose from and i put my hands on the veg pan fried momos with schezwan sauce.Served hot with spicy schezwan sauce,the lip-smacking momos were worth the money spent on it.There were only 5 pieces but its size was almost double the normal size of  momos.I never thought i could get this variety of momos better than what i had at WOW! MOMO but i was mistaken.It is a must try for those who  eat hot ,spicy food.And a must try for all the momo-lovers.It is worth every single penny spent on it.You can pair it with a vegetable thupka to get a good combo of flavours,both chinese and tibetan at the same time.Besides,these spicy momos coupled with non-spicy noodle soup(veg thupka) is an ideal combo which can even suit the taste-buds of non-spicy food eaters.

         Commenting on the ambience i would say that the ambience is not good.There is a lack of cooling systems and the interiors are old-fashioned in this fashionista world.The furniture used is also shabby.The service is slow.In the daytime,you would think as if you have come across a typical bengali bungalow when you approach this restaurant.At night,you realise that it s a restaurant.The restaurant needs a lot of modernisation to survive in the near future.

Sasta, Sundar and Tikaou is what comes to my mind when i think of Momo Plaza. A nice place which offers you good food with a not so good ambiance. But at the price charged the ambiance cannot be criticised.  Both the gravy and Non gravy momos are a delight to the taste buds. The chinese food is also up to the mark at very reasonable prices. If the service can be improved abit this place has the potential. Overall a nice place to have food when you worried about the pinch on your pocket more than the food.

There are places which you grow out of eventually. Momo Plaza for me is one such place.
This was one of my college regulars. 
But now I am sick of this place.
The service is really very bad. Most of the times they goof up  orders and also the staff is not friendly.
I used to have the Cantonese and Pan fried noodles here everytime I used to go.
But to be honest, the place has totally lost its charm for me.

I literally stay all the time in the "exide" area though I do not live there and trust me Momo Plaza is a place as good as a little hut in a barren land(yes it is not a barren land over there but good non-veg food at affordable price..there are only a few options)  . Though there is nothing plush about it and its a bit hot inside and the air is not freshened by room fresheners but still there is something magnetic about the place. As the name suggests, momos are the best, the other Chinese items are good and the quantity is enough, rather more than enough and you are getting all these at a very reasonable price. The Chicken Pan fried Momo with gravy...its heaven!The gravy is fiery hot colored and the moment it touches the tongue there is a burst of spices..garlic and ginger being most of it.. So when at momo plaza you must try it.. the flavor would not leave your taste buds the whole day..and you will long to return!

Momo plaza another previously renowned place for momos and Chinese and Tibetan food located in Elgin road opposite Chai Break and Fifth element which has declined over the years and is no where near what it used to be.It bears many similarities to Orchid and Hamro momo located just next to this one.
I used to be a regular at all these places during my childhood but it is not the case nowadays because these places have declined and there are better options available.These days if I have to choose one among them I would probably choose this or Hamro momo.The momos here are still pretty decent.The coating is thin and the content is filled with the main ingredient and not the onions and cabbages.The momos are not rewarmed and generally freshly prepared.The main course items are just about average.Again this place does not have any air conditioning and hygiene and cleanliness is a bit of an issue.The prices are reasonable.

Love this place. Food is good. Place is pocket friendly, ambience is good. Only drwback is that the place is too hot to sit and eat. Pan Fried Momo is really tasty, not the soup though which comes with it.

Fried rice, noodles quantity is good. Chicken quantity could have been better. But keeping in mind the prices of dishes which is on an average 120 bucks, it can be considered okay.

Above all, the food. Ya I could suggest for a meal once in a while. Pocket-pinchc is not at all a question. You can always choose from a whole variety of "CALCUTTA STYLE CHINESE", Authentic in its way.
They have a really short stock of snacks.
The maincoirse offers a wholesome. College goers and office-para people, this place is for you.
I dont call it cheap, rather reasonable.

This place is one of those places that i hold very close to my heart , as a child most of my birthdays were spent with my mom and sister here.. This place  is ancient (my mom used to go to this place as a college student). TRUE IT HAS NO VIEW AT ALL AND is a little low on being clean but they serve the best food if you know what to order!!. Our all time favorites were 
1.Pork Fried Momo- beautifully done crisp and succulent 
2.Mixed Fried Rice- really loaded with goodies and tastes good
3.Chilly pork- yum.. a lil too salty so ask them to go easy on the salt when you order this dish
4. Mixed Thupa-yummy and filling
5.Fried Prawn Balls- awesome with some of that really spicy sauce.. :)

all this and then an orange stick ice cream from the ice cream vendor who sits right on the corner of the crossing.. a perfect meal

It is easy to access by  bus metro or taxi and is located in plain sight so no venturing into dark alleys to find this eatery and that is definitely a big huge plus for me . 

On the downside they should consider making the place more clean and installing air conditioners.the same staff has being working there since i remember visiting the place so a sense of "i am all" has entered the staff and that could do some serious damage to the place.. serve crap with a smile and people with spare you the criticism and come back  to try the place a second time..:) But on a personal note i love the place .. it is my all time "go to " haven

Momo plaza is a small eatery in Elgin Road. The ambience is nothing great. It is a dimly lit. Hygiene is not maintained at all. The staff themselves make the place dirty. Today, the cashier was spitting beside the chair he was sitting on. The view was just horrible so we decided to bring the food home instead of eating out there..We wouldn't have even eaten from there after this view but it was too late for us to cancel the order placed. 

Coming to food we ordered:-
1) Steamed Chicken momos : The momos were of good sizes, the filling was sufficient and the coating was thin. The only thumbs down was that it was a bit dry.
The sauce served with it was somewhat spicy but the taste was'nt good.
The soup served with the momo was really very good. Liked it.:)

2) Chicken Thai Soup : Hell and heaven difference between the authentic thai soup and Momo Plaza thai soup. It was more of like hot and sour soup with an overpowering taste of ginger. Just too much of ginger.

3) Chicken Fried rice : Just above average. Quantity was good.

4) Chilli Chicken : Again, just above average.

Pocket pinch was around 470 bucks.
Not recommended at all. 

Eat at your own risk.

Location: Elgin Road, opposite Chai Break. 

This is a small eatery which serves Tibetan and Chinese cuisine. 

The ambiance out here isn't something to be excited about, an old house has been converted into a eatery.
Dimly lit. 

Have been here for a number of times just for quick bite while on my way back from work. 
Have tried the following until now: 

Steamed Momos 
The flour wrap is thin, filling is flavourful.
Tastes good. 
Clear soup along, is average. 
The sauce accompanying it is spicy. 

Veg Panfried Momos (Sez) 
The momos are pan-tossed along with Schezuan sauce! 
That tastes absolutely delicious and is extremely spicy. 
Recommended for people who love fiery food. ;-) 

Veg Fried Rice (Sez) 
The "Sez" represents schezuan, i.e. this is nothing but Schezuan fried rice. 
Yet again a great dish, perfectly cooked rice with the right amount of sauce! 
Tastes good. 

Veg Hakka Noodles 
Tastes average, is oily. 

Veg fried rice 
Perfectly cooked but tastes average.  
Schezuan preparation is a much better one. 

The staff is well-informed and the service is quick. 
Pocket friendly prices.

Overall a good experience.

A Visit to Momo Plaza! 
From Where do I start ! A bit complex place! No too spacious!! The temperature inside can be compared to Delhi's recent one! Just a Fan making u feel to Life! 
Service: No very impromptu... Nobody services u water! The Glasses are Clean Every Week or So I guess! 
Food: Ordered Veg. Pan Fried Momo with Schezwan Sauce, Veg. Hukka Noodle, Chill Panner and Soft Drink.. 
Appreciating the Momo brings me to the Spice in the Sauce! The Sauce was like nothing but A ocean of red and green chilies.. But was dish to be ordered for sure with Conditions.. Hukka Noodle.. Quite Good. But I felt the noodles could have been more Boiled.. Chilli Paneer.. I guess they literally meant it.. A dish full with Chilly Sauce I had to find paneer.. Soft Drink.. U get it as usual in other places but "COLD" .. But here it was a bit different.. The Temp pulled it all.  :) 
Not a bad Visit but not that great ! I would love to visit again but with few precautions! ;)

Generation by generation people are visiting this place. This is that place where I am coming at around 10yrs approx.  Not a single day till date mono plaza has ever disappointed us. Their world class hospitality with simple food in affordable price attracts people from the age group of 8 to 80 I suppose. I was wondering how they can continue this Service in decades. 
Only couple of negative side I thought Momo Plaza has that of not having AC And not the availability of accepting cards. 
Everything else is good about it.

This place is one of the best if you want to have a really good Chinese meal without spending much. 
Located just opposite chai break this is the first joint among the legendary three momo places this place boasts of. 

 It takes you back to the old charm of the city when the 'authentic' Chinese outlets weren't open and accept it or not, sometimes the satisfaction the indianized Chinese gives us- nothing can. So if you want to drown yourself in the Chinese food heaven, do not think twice. Just step in. 

Even though the interiors are a little dingy, somehow the little lamps add to the feel of the place. And if compared to the other outlets present on the same lane, this one has the best interiors hands down. 

Coming to the food, I love their thukpa, sweet corn soup. I wish they served talumein soup too but sadly they just don't. 
The Momos are nice - really big pieces of veg filled Momos. 
Coming to the main course, I love their fried rice and chilly baby corn and paneer. However the latter has scope for improvement. 

The quantity is huge and the prices are really really realllly pocket friendly. 
So people if you've to satisfy the sudden craving for Chinese food (which I often have), think nothing beyond this joint!

My love affair with momos begun with momo plaza. It brings so much happiness by just the mention of it.Located in elgin road(the same road has another favourite,hamro momo) this place serves amazing momos. 
The place is divided into rooms that go in lengths and lengths never ending sorts.I prefer sitting at the last (if i get the seat that is), near to the kitchen so that i can give my olfactory glands a treat to remember.Also forget the ambience, it is a restaurant that has been made inside an old house.My favourites here have to be a plate of steaming momos ,followed by more momos :p the veg pan fried momos in schezwan sauce my most favourite is not for the weak hearted .It is fiery, trust me, but so delicious that you ll come back more for this.Word of caution, if you love super spicy,extremely heat generating stuff, then try.The mixed thupka is very nice. I have also tasted their chinese(namely schezwan fried rice with chill paneer) and it was nice. 
The prices are reasonable. 

Momos are served everywhere, but nothing like momo plaza(im a little more partial to this place,over hamros though i love hamros too)

Easy to locate. Opposite Rabindra Sadan metro station. It looks like a residential building but thankfully they have a signboard outside. No ambience as such. Just an ordinary food joint with a pretty small place. Average service. Moderately priced menu. Tried the Pan Fried Pork Momo (Gravy). Five pieces fill you up good. Nice place for a quick grab with friends.

So this place was pretty much of a surprise ! 
Not a very fancy place BUT definitely popular of it's momos 
My cousin and I went for wedding shopping and landed up here filling up our empty stomach 
So to start with .. Had to wait for about 10 mins to get a place which was okay 
Then came the food ordering 
We ordered 2 plates of pan fried pork momo and a plate of chicken steamed momo 
 The food took SOME time to come .. Which was a huge turn off cus I was dying of hunger 
~ pork pan fired momo 
This was extremely delicious 
~chicken steamed momo 
I couldn't get enough of it ! Damn damn good 
Both in quality and quantity 
It had enough chicken n pork filling and the spicy sauce was totally worth it 
A major flip side was the soup ! 
It was terrible ! It's the worst I've ever had .. It tasted more of soap  and not soup :/

I just visit their yesterday with my two other food lover friends and get disappointed with the reviews. This is mainly a pocket friendly restaurant for hungry people or for couples bt not for real food lovers those who just concentrate on the food quality. regarding quality its an most ordinary eating point mainly on pork items. Now the momos of momo plaza - many foodies says its great so we tried pork steamed momos at first and our frustration begins as the dish is undercooked (we think) coz the outer side of the momos are under cooked and hard the sauces are not up to the marked bt the sizes are quiet big. Now come to the main course we ordered pork mixed noodles Hakka and gravy with chili pork dry. The dishes come with proper quantity but most ordinary quality and taste. the noodles are not far better from road side food stalls and the chili porks are just so so for those who already had a visit at Blue Poppy or Jimmy`s Kitchen. And I am confuse about their hygienic system also .

Had a disgusting experience of this place. 
The Momos weren't steamed properly and were still raw. Also the noodles were tasting too oily.
Would'avoid this place if possible and go to any other place in the vicinity.

Never heard of this place until recently and this place was a marvel.
The ambience and service was pretty bad. Very badly lit and the joint is in an old building. I didn't like that. Plus the waiters were slow and takes a long time.
If we can overlook that, this place is amazing. The momos were out of this world and the pork dishes were amazing.
I'd love to go back and try other things as well.
Overall it was worth it.
Easy on the pocket and good for the tongue.

We had a tough time locating this place or maze.. yea thats what I thought when I entered the place. Located in a residential building though, the environment was not at all comforting for me. We ordered straightway... which was Chicken Kothey and Chilli Chicken Dry along with two bottles of Thumbs-up. The service took its own sweet time. The Kothey was pretty tasty, it was perfect in every sense, but the sauce was far from ok. Anyways I always prefer the soup with it & it didn't disappoint me. The Chilli Chicken on the other hand was a disaster, it was clearly over fried to the point of making it quite gristly. I literally had to wash it down with the thumbs-up. A decent place for momos though...

I've been eating at this place since I was a child and I've seen this place evolve over time. Their momos are delicious and economic although they could work on their pork momos a bit. Apart from that the other food items can be best described as average. One can stop here when hanging out at Nandan or Elgin Road Forum.

Been here today with a friend. Though I previously had thought of visiting hamro momo which is just beside momo plaza, thought of trying out momo plaza instead specially because of my wish to try kothey which hamro momo does not serve. Ordered pork kothey, pork pan fried momo (sez) and chicken wonton soup. They took a while to serve the order. The wonton soup was below average. The momo covering was very thick and rubbery. The kothey was quite delicious though! So all in all I was quite disappointed and henceforth won't visit it if I have a craving specifically for momo. So I can't give this place more than 2.5.

It was after a lot of walking that we manged to locate this little place. The ambiance is quite okay, located in a residential house. Our order was simple.....Chicken Kothey and Chilli Chicken Dry along with bottles of Thumbs-up. It did take a while to arrive. The Kothey was pretty good....the covering wasn't too thick and the filling was tasty. But the momo sauce could have been better. I have never been a fan of soups....but my friends said that the one served with the Kothey was good enough. The  Chilli Chicken, on the other hand, turned out to be a disaster ! It was way overdone....maybe it was fried multiple times....to the point that it was rubbery. 'Bad' would be an understatement. :( So.....when in Momo Plaza, I'll stick to the Momos ! 2.5 stars from me.

Stop Press. Visit on 03 May 2014.

Tried out the Pork Kothey. It was served with a light broth (the momo is steamed in it). The Kothey itself is a momo, half steamed and half fried. Six large pieces for Rs 80. It went so well with the Thums Up.

--------------------------------------------------

Paid a visit to Momo Plaza (situated among a host of other momo-serving establishments in the vicinity) after quite some time.

The place has multiple smallish rooms, each with 4 or so tables. Standard plastic tables and chairs. I wanted a quick bite and got a place easily at about 2 pm. I ordered a plate of pork steamed momos and pork chilli (dry). They were out of Thums Up so I had to satisfy myself with a Coke.

They took a bit of time to serve. The momos came first. Five large pieces. It came with the standard soup which I found over salty and with a bit of chaat masala like taste (which I find a tad obnoxious). The momos themselves were not warm enough. The covering was perhaps too thick. The meat though was well minced, and tasty. But definitely not the juicy melt in your mouth kind. It must have been reheated, but then I wonder why they took that long to serve. The Coke thankfully was reasonably cold.

The Chilli Pork was served almost along with the momos. I was disappointed with it. There were six large slices, with hardly much of capsicum. The flavouring was passable. The meat seemed vastly overcooked though. It tasted more boiled than anything else, kind of pasty and dissipating on chewing. The fat too wasn't as tasty as it should have been.

The entire meal cost Rs 210. Not too bad a price, but one would definitely expect food that is kinder to the palate. I have had far better fare here.

There are certain places you have to develop a liking for when you have visited it for the first time when you were just 6 months old. Such is the case with Momo Plaza. What followed was a very bad case of green diarrhea and I ended up very sick but then I guess one cannot blame the management for such a thing because probably they do not have many customers in that age range :P. Anyways it has grown and opened up more rooms and happens to be my must visit place every year during winters and I must have at least two plates of momo before sharing a combination of fried rice and chilli pork. Sometimes a pan fried momo replaces two dishes of steamed momo. The chopsuey is  a no no according to me. 
The ventilation is low but you will like the new lights (which is also pretty old now) and the seating is not comfortable but then it’s supposed to be a momo joint and very few momo joints in its true sense is any different.  The décor is not something you might appreciate if you are a décor person but then for décor go to other places come here for quality momo, thukpa and pork.
Though some say the quality has fallen I must pay another visit to update you on that but a heritage eatery like this will always be able to make up for it in a small time according to me or else they would not have survived so many years.
As for the location it is 3 minutes’ walk from Rabindra Sadan metro or you can walk from Brand Factory towards it along the suburban hospital road….

Like the name and menu suggests, it is a cheap and tasty place to eat.
I have often had the fried, steamed and pan fried momos and they are excellent. There is a lack of authentic sauces to go with the momos but at the price, there really is little else you can ask out of this place. The chow and Rice dishes are also worth a shot if you are visiting for a full meal in mind.
The soups however were not a pleasant experience.
Overall, great place for a budget meal and good for a quick snack.

Momo Plaza is one of those places in Kolkata which actually serves great momos like how it should taste. I'm not sure if many people know about this place. It is very colse to Rabindra Sadan Metro station. 
The momos here are seriously much better than the ones you get around nandan or the streets. Before, even I used to think that those momos were so cheap and it also tastes good but once you try this at Momo Plaza, you'll be able to differentiate both. There a number of kinds of momo available there. You ca even get pork momo. The soup also tastes much better here.
So if you're willing to pay that extra bit, try this place.

Momo plaza was the place that introduced me to the momos may be 7-8 years back and i fell in love with both straightaway !!!!!!!!

Located in the lane opposite brand factory towards chowringhee, it accessibility is one of its biggest forte but parking has off late become a major hassle in this lane coz of the the rising popularity of this place and the few tibetan and chinese food joints nearby. It is a small eatery with seats on both sides of a long passage without much of a decor. They do not generally serve you in the car unless you are a regular and known face. The staff is polite and service is a bit on slower side.

Momo plaza means lots of momos and memories to me since this used to be a very frequent destination for our college gang when everybody used to gulp uncountable momos in a span of just half an hour. I do not like much of the other offerings other than its steamed or pan fried momos. They stood to be my favorite destination for the same hands down for a span of  5 years when blue poppy replaced it. Fried rice and noodles are decent while side dishes and starters disappoint. But prices being very reasonable with serving on the generous side, one cant complain much.

They have a huge foodie base and great momos to offer but would love them even more if they could improve their chinese preparations and overall presentation of food.

This quite little place is on  Suburban Hospital Road or to say it simply, the road leading to Brand Factory from the Rabindra Sadan Metro station. The  comparatively lower cost of the items as compared to the neighborhood it occupies, is a plus. Among the few other restaurants bordering it, all serve the same Tibetan-Chinese cuisine, but this is the best of the lot. The ambience is particularly nice, located as it is in the confines of an old residential house. The long corridors with the winding passageway and dim lighting smokes the mind. The perfect place for a date. The service is nice and the food is not late. The only bother may be the bit shoddy ventilation which brings back the kitchen smokes over onto the diner's tables.
The food was nice if not great. The Pork Chow mein we ordered was true to its original cooking style. The Tibetan flavours were unmistakable, the warm broth supplementing the juicyness of the long cut vegetables. The serving was large enough for two. However the pork had to be searched for in the dish. That proved the only downer.

Chakraborty Tip : "The toilet" consists of only a washbasin. Don't know how you'll be able to do your business there. :D

The place is neither a restaurant nor a street side fast food center I believe the owners turned their flat into a restaurant. The momo's available here are one the best. but if you are veggie then this is certainly not your place.
Thumbs (y) : 1. The location (always packed with all sort of people i.e all age groups)
                   2. The food is nice and tasty.
                   3. The service is pretty fast, you wont have to wait too long

Set backs : 1. The place is not at all clean, sticky tables, the plates and all aren't properly cleaned.
                  2. They are fast but they dont serve you well.
                  3. You need to TALK IN BENGALI if you want them to understand what you want.

Sarcastically, I never had any momo at Momo Plaza... But truly I love the Chinese... any-day go for Chinese out here and they will simply awe your taste buds... They provide a large quantity of food too....

The place can get a little claustrophobic... and has very low amenities...

But their main problem is hygiene and only hygiene...
They have seating arrangements opposite a bathroom-like space, where they wash the utensils and platters... I witnessed to my utter disgust the way they just dip the platters in a dirty tub of water (no running tap water) and just wipe them dry with a dirtier cloth.

Given every single person wants to have healthy and quality food, I cannot recommend this shop inspite of the great tasting menus!!!

Location: Momo plaza situated opposite to chai break Elgin road. 

Offerings: Offers varieties of momo both veg and nonveg, soups, noodles,thukpas, greavy items And rice. 

Pros: 1) pocket friendly
2) quantity of food is too much as compared to price. 
3) service is pretty ok. 
4) 150-200 for 2. 

Cons:1) place isn't that hygenic. 
2) quality of food is not that great.
3) staff area not maintained i.e. dirty 
4) cockroaches and insects roaming around the wall at times. 

One must try: momos, schezwan rice , soups. Chilli chicken is very oily here.

MOMO PLAZA!!!One of the most pocket friendly joints serving delicious MOMOs and located at the Heart of the City .The Steamed Chicken Momos/Steamed Pork Momos are good to taste..The condiment served is hot and spicy as it should be.The Pan fried Momos are a bit different here than their regular versions and leave a lingering taste in the mouth.They also serve proper thupka and especially the Mixed Thupka tastes quite good.

The ambiance doesn't score much with tables arranged one after another but the service is prompt.

They also serve Chines dishes but their forte of fame being the "MOMO"s.If you are looking to gorge on Momos/Thupka this is quite a good place.

Long before a Tibetan eatery had opened its gates to Kolkata a tiny little place near Elgin Road was where one went for those amazing little dumplings stuffed with succulent meat or vegetables. The decor has always been the usual dimly lit 'Chinese decor'. People somehow always manage to associate Chinese restaurants with dim lighting for some odd reason and the seating is not very comfortable without any backrest but if one is lucky enough to secure a table with the wall as the backrest it seems not too bad but then again the wall is not the ideal backrest. The momos are lovely whether steamed or pan fried. The condiment served is hot and spicy as should be. The upside is its price which is extremely economical. Their Chinese fare isn't too bad but is a bit on the oily side. Funnily I have found that the rice which they serve is less oily than the noodles. The side dishes are a bit disappointing. The chicken is usually quite tough but then again as the name suggests most people drop in for a steaming plate of dumplings. The momos are always served with a clear soup which has very little trace of the fat from the chicken and has some floating spring onions in it but is delicious on a rainy day or a chilly evening.

Both Momo plaza and Orchid (same building, on the left side) are great choices for momos in cold or draughty weather. I personally am giving Momo Plaza because I like the taste of the momos and (strangely enough) the clear soup here a bit better than its neighbour. 
The ambience isn't much to check out: it's basically a tiny place with tables one behind the other, so don't take your girl out on a date here......but when you just want a nice memory on a random rainy afternoon, get down here and indulge yourself.
They have all types of Chinese items, so I'd say even a proper lunch here is a good choice. The prices are comfortable even when you're low on cash. The service is really quick too. With the exception of the place being really cramped up, I have no complaints.

Okay, Momo Plaza and Orchid are things of the past, and now a part of my epic Kolkatan Hangover. However, what do I love about the two places? First, the steamed pork momo and the pan fried momos, which are quite different, and taste quite good. I would have loved it if the service and hygiene was taken care of a bit more. Personally, that is the bad part about this place.

A very affordable place right near Elgin Road/Rabindra Sadan.

There is nothing to talk about the ambience or the service. If you are hungry, and you want good food for a very pocket-friendly price, do drop in. It started out selling Momos only (hence the name) but quickly expanded to a Chinese and Tibetan eatery. I personally like the Pan Fried Momos, and the Chinese section is also very tasty. It has the quintessential spirit of the Chinese Street Food in Calcutta. The helpings are fine, and service hardly takes 5-7 minutes.
There are no special recommendations, except for the Pan Fried Momos - but that is because I love my momos pan fried anyway; and not for this place in particular.

Verdict: Stick to the basics, order your fried rice and your noodles and your regular gravy chicken and you won't complain. Very light on the pocket, a filling lunch for two would cost around Rs. 350 at the most.

Are you a Chinese food lover?? well this one is a must try for you. Awesome food and overwhelming quantity. The momos are the best here as the name itself suggests. Personally I love steamed momo but their fried momos are nice too. You must try their chicken thukpa and the soups here are well done. The prices are very reasonable and you will definitely be able to afford it. Yes the ambience is very simple and nothing grand but the food and low pricing makes up for it. The staff is inexperienced but it won't really bother you. 
Overall I completely loved my meal and enjoyed my entire experience here. So I rate it 4 and would suggests all of you to visit 'Momo Plaza' if you don't won't to miss something quite unbelievable.

Momo Plaza is a mediocre restaurant situated at 2A, Suburban Hospital Road, near Elgin Road, Kolkata. It is a typical Chinese and Tibetan restaurant serving a variety of preparations. It is located at the ground floor of a house. So the entrance is nothing appealing, neither the interior also. The dining tables are arranged in three sections partitioned by walls. The place seems to be very congested and dingy due to the discolored and dull walls with a few dirty antique decorative pieces and limited lighting. You can even ignore these flaws if you get a better service from the staffs. But still this place remains crowded and I am also a frequent visitor here because this is one of the best eating hubs in Exide area at affordable range. 

Though it offers a wide range of Chinese and Tibetan dishes, they don't know how to prepare Momos. I love Momos and so I have tasted Momos at various destinations but I must say the road side Momo stalls prepare at least much better Momos than Momo Plaza. Twice I have ordered Momo here and both the time, I was very much disappointed. So dry and rubbery..that I literally had to put effort to tear a piece. Moreover, the stuffing is also very less. More onion than chicken in the stuffing. However, they are expert in thukpa, soups and other Chinese preparations. The Dry Chili Chicken is really amazing. Another thing that I really never want to miss whenever I am here is the Chicken Thukpa. Healthy, tasty and enough in quantity to satisfy my tummy along with the taste buds! Russian Salad and Chicken with Kaju Salad are also two of my favorite preparations here. Though the ambience, service and momo preparations have always disappointed me but still, this is one of my favorite dining destinations.

It is a decent lower budget joint to have some fun with steaming chicken momo or fried momo.  Located conveniently in the heart of Calcutta, it gets crowded at peak houes.

This is a place for a foodie who want to try different. This place worth visiting.  

Quality - You won't get a quality food anywhere with the price offered in menu.

Taste - Try the Tibetan thuppa. You are going love it. I keep trying variety they offer.  Try the chilli fish the barbecue tasted will make you force you to return. Another must try is Chilli pork, they first roast it and make the preparation. Your taste bud will find a new taste.

Dont let looks deceive you.This place looks dingy....but the food is affordable,and comparatively good. Actually,this area has got a number of roadside momo stalls,specially near Exide building.So compared to the roadside fare,this place is a god send for the Momo lover within a 5km radius. :-) .The service isnt worth mentioning,and the tables could do with a decent scrub.But the wide variety of tibetan and chinese food available quite make up for all the obvious flaws.Prices are pretty average.Next time you are in the area,why not sample the delights of Tibet without burning a hole in your pocket?

their hakka noodles are great
pan fried momos & kotheys (one side seared momos) are great also
& to top it all off very reasonable price & great quality

PS: they might come to table with a different order from what you ordered... :P
but that just adds to the fun

this place never fails to satisfy me.
whenever i feel like having a delicious plateful of momo i decide to come here.
excellent pan fried momos in schezwan sauce.
the schezwan sauce is deliciously enough to have it just like that without anything else!
tried their hakka noodles.. it was good..
quantity is great. 1 plate of noodles is more than enough for two people.
the best part- very reasonable

awesome momos(except the clear soup.. i found it to be a little under seasoned) and thukpa! i simply loved it!
ambience is quite nice!
service is also fast!
and more importantly its quite pocket friendly!

A splendid place for having momos. After shopping in Brand Factory i visit 'MOMO PLAZA' and have exotic and delicious momos. Especially they are famous for their momos only and other chinese and tibetan dishes too. It is really near to my house and i rarely visit there. Ambience is dull,not much decorated. Price is reasonable and quantity is pretty well. All dishes momo like fried and steamed momo are really great here. Being a pure chinese lover, it is one of my favourite chinese having places. Suggestion goes to folks for having food here. 4 stars for it. They do not do home delivery.

This place has some of the best momos you will find anywhere in Kolkata. If momo is your thing, be sure to visit this place.

Now the down side, decor is on the minium here. Service is rather slow and I find the place too small for my liking. Apart from the momo, fried rice, and chili chicken, other dishes are quiet lacking in taste.

For momos "If there is a heaven on earth it is this it is this it is this".Period.
I dont know exactly how many times I have had momos from from momo plaza and probably have tried almost all varieties they have-chicken,pork,veg evrything. However my favourite remains and will always remain the Chicken Pan Fried(dry) momos that they have here. Crispy fried momos coated in sauce thats both hot and sweet at the same time. Although they could do some improvement on the soup that they serve with their momos(what they serve is probably vegetable stock,topped with spring onions).Their Chinese fare is equally delectable..especially the chicken noodles and the chilli garlic noodles. Also they have one of the best chilli chicken(dry) in the city. 
The place might be small,the waiters might not pay you a great deal of attention and there's no a.c to keep you cool,but when the food's on your plate,you would definitely be ready to forgive and forget everything.

Momo plaza serves good momos and thupka.
Chicken Steamed Momo, Chicken Steamed Schezwan Momo, are good.
Chicken Pan Fried Gravy momos are very good too.
Chicken Pan Fried Momo in Schezwan Sauce is very tasty. Must try!
Chicken Thupka is good too.
Ambiance is poor. Staffs are okay. Service is quick.
Very Very Reasonable.

This one looks like a dingy place when u enter it but what came to my surprise was that they had Pot-Stickers (dumplings pan seared on 1 side ) called Kothey ...... and they also had pan fried momos tossed in a hot garlic sauce. The pan fried momos here are way better than anywhere else.especially Pan Fried with Gravy and with sichuan sauce The thing that i liked here was the fantastic Dipping Sauce. Spicy, but not gullet burning hot, with heady coriander bursts, gingery undertones and a fantastic balance of chili, with hints of sweetness. their chili chicken and fried rice too are great and food servings are of large sizes total value for money have been here twice and am in love with the place. with an average of rs 150 per head this place is fantastic The Lunch ended with an over stuffed belly an satiated taste buds.

The momos are good and so are the thukpas. The side dishes not up to the mark. The ambiance is shabby, though you cant expect everything for the price they charge. A good place for a quick unorthodox lunch if you are somewhere around. The steamed momos are better than the fried ones as the fried ones are a bit too oily than they should be.

I had first visited this place with my friends a couple of years back when I had gone for shopping in Elgin Road.The place is not very fancy but it offers good and authentic Tibetan food.The chicken wonton soup tastes very good,along with the pan fried gravy momos.The prices are quite decent and the portions are fulfilling.Now,i am a frequent visitor to this place thanks to the Metro connectivity(Its just 1 min away from the Rabindra Sadan metro station).

I completely agree with Akshat... Momo plaza is perhaps the worst momo experience I have ever come across... We had ordered for chicken momo which after half an hour wait; learnt are not available. So  the closest we could alter our order was mutton momos, they too made us wait for another half an hour. Only if the wait was worth it, we were served with half cooked unseasoned horrible momo. We too felt that the soup was nothing but warm water.  The attendants are 'rude', yes i mean it. 

Anyone planning to visit this place please deroute... hope you did not have to go through the same experience, i.e. Bad.

Momo Plaza is a much new entrant of the Tibetan eateries located in Bhabanipur.Chicken momos will come either deep-fried or steamed. I prefer the latter, and the fiery hot chili paste they give with it is fantastic. The surprise treat is this green onion light soup that comes with the momos as well. I'm told that natives will actually just put the steamed momos in the soup and consume it as such. I usually eat it separately, but do as you wish. I love Tibetan food.
