This tiny shop is situated at Hedua, near opposite of Kshuduram College. They serve milkshakes, lassi, syrup. It is very pocket- friendly, and a good stop to refresh oneself with some quick fluids. Been to this place a few times.

A glass of mango lassi from Shiv Assram after a hectic day in college used to be so refreshing. Once tried the bhaang from here too. The taste was nice, but the after effect was terribly brutal. XD

Its the best place in North Kolkata for Lassi and shakes. It comes with a wide range of variety. Each and everyone of those are awesome with all goodness of milk. Its a must try for everybody if you are walking down Bidhan Sarani(Hatibagan).

Though the place is little tiny and form a like shop within a small place and some portable seating arrangements are there to seat 
But it can be ignorable in terms of test of the drinks 
They served thandai,lassis and milk shakes

While walking towards Hatibagan from Hedua, you will easily find this syrup stall located along the footpath. It is a tiny place tightly packed to make itself call a shop, with a few portable seating arrangements.
On approaching it, you will find one single person handling the whole procedure, starting from taking order to making drinks available, cleaning up to serving the customers, tuning to required song to smiling at the people waiting for their order. The way he multitasks is a lesson for us all.
This place makes a range of beverages available from lassi to syrup. While, I am not fond of lassi, I prefer ordering syrups and my friend goes with lassi. I, on various occasion ordered flavours like green mango, mango, orange, strawberry, kesar badam, milkshake.
While all of the beverages were from quiet right to good, I found the badaam flavour quiet intriguing. Taking into consideration the price and place, it makes justice to it's beverages.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Yes, you should visit it once and then form an opinion of your own.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4 stars?
Ans) This place deserves positive feedback, but, since one person handles the whole procedure single-handedly, cleanliness becomes an issue.

A very old shop, serving delectable thandai, lassis, milkshakes. A place that blends the old Kolkata feeling with the numerous benarasi thandai shops. I was delighted that I got an opportunity to try their thandais . The kesar badaam thandai was soothing and refreshing. Will surely revisit this place . A big thanks to

Love this place from my school days.My fav from this place is Ripe Mango Milk Shake and Pineapple Milk Shake.Also Badam Milk Shake was also good.
Generous in amount.You can see them making the lassi or milk shakes in front of you.So don't need to worry about hygiene.
Alltogether very good experience..

Don't know why this famous stall is underrated, it don't deserve it to get under 3.5 at any conditions!

Location is very easy, located between Scottish Church School and Hedua Park!

They served various kinda water syrup based lassi, Milk Shake, Ghol Sarbat in many different flavors like Green Mango, Lichi, Orange, Rose and more and more! Each of them are very tasty, refreshing and different in taste from one another! Rose and Green Mango flavor is my all time favorite flavors!

This is a small stall, so no sitting arrangement for obvious reasons but few chairs are there In front of the stall, where you can sit easily!!

Service is very fast and the lassi maker remains busy most of the time to serve ur desire lassi!

So, in conclusion I must say, if you are a lassi or sarbat fan, then Shiv Arsram is your must visit destination! They remain same and so does their taste from my first visit, when I was in school. Awesome lassi with very nominal price make this stall really a must visit spot!

Quite famous in the Hedua Locality, a small shop with shiv shlokas ringing round the clock in the shop, providing good refreshing sherbets like Lassi, Syrup, Milk shakes,ghol and thandai in variety of flavours at reasonable price. The service is really fast inspite of being crowded with college students, and passerby.
            
Nowadays they have replaced the glasses with the disposable glasses for those who are hygeine conscious.
I personally prefer the Rose Syrup Sherbet, Rose lassi, Ripe mango and green mango Lassi.

This is a small but popular stall selling syrup based drinks, milkshakes and ghols. You will get lots of flavours and the price is reasonable. If you are around it's worth stopping for a drink or two. Service is real fast despite the crowd. I personally love their Litchi (water based) drink.

Cons are, as the stall remains crowded, sometimes they do not put much effort in making the drinks and hence taste becomes inconsistent. Also they play loud religious music all the time, which will disturb you if you want a cool drink in a hot and humid day. Also I personally am against sound pollution.

Can't believe shiv asshram is also on zomato... This is one of the best places to have lassi... Whether u prefer normal lassi or mixed with flavoured syrups they serve it all and will definitely win your heart...and if u want to get drunk during holi then my friends this is best place serving bhang wali thandai with mild,medium and strong version of bhang as per ur preference...  Even if you don't want to have bhang try their normal thandai.. It tastes superb...
