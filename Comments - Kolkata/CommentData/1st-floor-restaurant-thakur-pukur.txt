Located near 3A bus stand crossing at DH Road, this small, neat restaurant happens to be a place serving descent food at reasonable price.
Not a very georgeous place with stunning ambience, but a standard 'value for money' restaurant to opt for some nice food or quick bites.

Opened few years back it is located near 3a bus stand...ambience and decor is really nice however the problem is on their food...they are not at all consistent...one time its great but the next time its worst...earlier there used to be some crowds but now it is empty most of the times...

The location is nice, the setting is nice, the placement is nice. Yet the place hasn't managed to take off yet in spite of having pleasant, helpful staff. Perhaps it is because they have nothing new to offer and whatever they have on offer is easily and cheaply accessible in ground floor places so no one bothers to climb up to the first floor. 
At one point of time they had south Indian cuisine on offer during breakfast, which was a good idea as there are no south Indian restaurants in  and around joka. Then it disappeared from the menu, perhaps because of lack of proper cooks.

Been there at nabami. They have good food except biryani. I don't like their biryani preparation, kind of tasteless. Kebab's are okay. Chicken gravy preparation's are good with nun. Chowmin is also good. Will visit again. 1 drawback is , no desert available.

Firstly this is not in Joka, this restaurant is in Thakurpukur 3A bus stand, starting MG Road.
Food is quite well.
I booked one evening the restaurant for my son's birthday party. 
Food quite good value for money.

This place is located near to my house so have tried their many items. The ambience is quite good but the food that I had was worst. I have tried their Biryani and Chilli Chicken. The Biryani was normal but on the other hand the chilli chicken was the worst chicken I ever had. The vegetables were not properly cooked and the gravy in it was disgusting as if it was looking like a pool of red water in which the vegetables were floating. So for me it was a bad experience.

This is the closest restaurant from my house. Been here couple of times. Ambience is decent restaurant types. I had Biriyani, Mughlai Paratha and Rolls from this place many times. Once I got stale Biriyani other times were fine. Their Rolls were good sometimes and were shit sometimes, I threw it in between and their Mughlai Paratha was good.
