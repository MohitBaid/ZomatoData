One of the tastiest food in South 24 Parganas area. Great Lassi and chicken items. Overall amazing place to eat from if u want to spend lesser than usual.

The Lassi is one of the best!
Chicken Bharta is to try!
Over all quite good according to the locality...where nothing good is available nearby

This is one of the worst restaurants i hv ever been. They serve dry and stale rice. I had fried rice once from here and all i was served was a plate of stale rice smeared with ghee and red chilli powder. I would suggest foodies never to visit this place.
