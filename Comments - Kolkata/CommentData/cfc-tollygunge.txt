Fantastic quality of the food needs to be mentioned first and foremost .... I was a bit apprehensive considering the negative reviews while ordering via Swiggy . The delivery and food washed away all my concerns. The Veg Thali was awesome . The quantity may be increased a bit but more or less it was okay. The¬† French Fries were delightful. I would certainly recommend the restaurant to those who order online frequently.

I had ordered chicken thali online for Rs133. It was the worst thali you can ever have. Roadside thali stalls sell even better. The price was neither worth qualitywise nor quantitywise. The actual valuation of the thali was not more than ‚Çπ55. They are doing unethical business.

Ordered 2 plates of Hing Kachori with Chola Daal, was delivered within time, but paying so much money for such awful food? The Chola Daal provided for 10pc Kachori was such a disappointment, no salt, no spices, it was as bland as it could be. The Kachoris are so small in size! Like seriously? You people can charge that much money for such disappointing food? You people really need a lot of work to do, on the food quality, and packing as well. I am ready to order again, only if the food quality gets better! This was such a waste of time and money. Please improve the food quality.
