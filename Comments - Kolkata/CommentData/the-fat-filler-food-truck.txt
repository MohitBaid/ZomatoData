Tried this joint last night.. very new concept in kolkata.. foodtruck.. what an experience..just wow. As its a restaurant on wheels hence the prices could be kept at a very low. But the quality is AMAZING. Never had such good quality pork.. lean no fat at all.. tried their grilled pork and chicken in brown sauce. They serve it with french fries which are really well done and the chicken pork pieces were right kind of juicy and well done. It is a MUST GO. There is home delivery option too.. though there are no seats but standing there and having the food was a real good experience.

An extremely simple solution to your problem of good food at low prices: The Fat Filler. Well not just one of the best, this is The Best food truck I have come across. We ordered for Oozy Grilled BarBQ Chicken Burger, Hot Cheese Garlic Pork Burger, Hot Garlic Fried Rice and Dry Chilli Fish. Hot Garlic Rice will not be available in the current menu card but will be made for you on request. Each one of the dishes is extremely luscious, and most importantly at very much affordable prices. The Dry Chilli Fish requires a special mention. Eight tender pieces of fish tossed with magical spices will cost you only 120. Once explored by the foodies, this can become a delight for students.

Decent taste, good staff & good location. Will try their Chinese dishes next time. They have pork based Chinese dishes too. Try if you pass by it.

There are only a few food trucks in Kolkata.
I have seen earlier the name of this food truck on Calcutta times where it was stated as one of most pocket friendly place catering delicious food and now after visiting this place today I also had the same feeling.

Location - The location might turn out to be complicated for a person who doesn't reside near Hindustan park. For them I should say that firstly arrive at gariahat and then follow Google maps or you can arrive at Hindustan park and similarly you can again follow Google maps.

Ambiance - It is a well decorated and nice looking food truck serving foods with no seating arrangements (not even outdoor seating). The food truck manager and the staff's behaviour were too good and they also helped us in ordering the signature items from their menu.

Food - The foods turned out to be super delicious and every bite of the food was worth for money.
We ordered the following items :
1) Hot garlic rice( mixed )(3.5/5).
2) Chilli fish dry (4.5/5)
3) Oozy grilled BBQ chicken burger(4.5/5).
4) Grilled pork BBQ cheese burger(4/5).
From my opinion you must try their dry chilli fish and oozy grilled BBQ chicken burger which I liked the most.

I would like to visit the place again and again as it's budget friendly and at the same time they provide good quality and tasty foods.
You can also order food from here via zomato and swiggy.
Just can't wait to visit this place again !!!

The best food truck in Kolkata, hands down. Starting from the awesome graffiti on it, to the short and simple menu, great food, amazingly affordable pricing - It's absolutely worth it. Run by 2 of the humblest dudes you'll come across, who also happens to be musicians and metalheads (hell yeah!)

The coolest food truck of the city. Sandwiches, Burgers, Fried Fish as well as the chinese items (Roasted Chilli Pork, Crispy Chicken) all are mouthwatering. Give it a try whenever you are at the Hindustan Park- Jatin Bagchi Road area.

"Discovered" this food truck while walking through Hindustan Park. I had the Grilled chicken sandwich which is among their least expensive items(Rs.80). It was a little low on spice and high on cheese. Generous quantity of chicken provided and a very filling snack.

They have an extensive Burger menu (Rs.140 to 150 on average) including Pork which needs to be tried. There is some Chinese on the menu as well (Aroud120) and loads of options to choose from.

As befits a food truck service is quick. Its available on both Swiggy and Zomato for delivery also.

Only issue is the location...its a little stinky due to a garbage cart and stagnant water a little distance away. Perhaps they can shift to the other side of the road.

Food is nice. Worth another try.

Relatively new joint.. Was on my bucket lust.. So went to try... Had their grilled pork... It was well seasoned and cooked perfectly... It came with a side of coleslaw and French fries... The coleslaw was yummy
... And the french fries had a nice crisp texture.. Since it was lunchtime I asked for some bread and they happily provided the same at an extra charge
..Also tried their combo meal.. Was skeptic at first but it turned out to be really nice..Keep the grub quotient up...Brutally :)

Go as per the location given, and you will find this giant truck standing to serve delicious food. 
It is pretty easy on the pocket, and offers a variety of food items, starting from sandwiches to burgers to Chinese combo meals. 
I happened to try the grilled pork chops(dry) which is served along with fries and coleslaw. 
Taste wise it was tender juicy and made fresh. 

All for 120 bucks. 
I'm gonna visit this ample of times from now. Loved it.
