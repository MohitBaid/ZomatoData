Was there on two occasions on 23rd & 31st Dec. On 23rd Dec I and my brother-in-law, opened our first innings with Chicken tandoori and chicken lasuni kabab half, which was just yummy n chewy and ended our innings with hot simmering Chicken dopyazza with butter nan. On 31st Dec, I and my brother-in-law was joined with my sister. We started our second innings with lasuni kabab full it again tasted just yummy, soft, delicate and built to IOU perfection. We later had butter nan, chicken curry which simmering, hot, creamy n yummy and along that had mutton curry, which tasted just awkward n ugly. Except the mutton curry we had a delightful food on both occasions.

Visited this place with my friends yesterday. The place is well decorated n the staffs were friendly.
Now coming to the food...finally got to try their 'mutton adrak ke punje'. I've heard really good stuffs about this item so my expectation was really high.. They served 3 pieces of mutton along with the typical green chutney. The mutton was well cooked,soft,looked absolutely delicious... But the taste was quite simple, nothing extraordinary.. Also for the price you're paying its a bit disappointing.
Apart from this we ordered butter nun, masala kulcha, chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken tikka butter masala... Those were really good and yummy.
Overall its a good place to hangout with your family or friends... I am looking forward to try out their other items.

We visited the place in a group of 16. First I will tell about the service, the promptness has impressed me.
Now come to the food, the basket of breads, kebabs are awesome. Main course chicken tikka masala is outstanding.

We also ordered for biriyani, which is not at par with the other dishes, here there is a scope of improvement.

Overall highly recommend.

Punjabee Rasoi is doing a brilliant job. The kababs are mesmerising. Though a little in the interiors but worth the visit. It was my first and my brothers fourth visit. Warm ambience and very polite people around, patiently serving and taking orders. Good is indeed amazing. Loved the place. Loved the food. Will surely visit again soon.

The place is quite nice. The decor was pretty appealing too. We were a group of four and started of  with their fresh lime soda sweet and sour and cold drinks. Did not like the soda. 

Mutton Adrak ke punje and Murg Lasooni Kebab were the starters.  Both the dishes were outstanding. 

We had the mutton special biryani which was very bad for the main course.

Overall the prices were quite steep but the starters justifies it.

Visited Punjabee Rasoi last night with my family and it turned out to be a great outing.
Located just behind the Acropolis, Punjabee Rasoi serves great North Indian food. One can notice their restaurant from the road by their lighting.
Coming to the food, we had their famous Mutton Adrak k Punje as starter. After that we ordered Kabuli Naan, Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Mutton Saag.
Mutton Adrak k Punje was really very good. Mutton pieces were just melting inside our mouth, it was that soft. One of the best preparation Chicken Tikka Butter Masala was also fantastic. Combination of Kabuli Naan and Chicken Tikka was perfect. Mutton Saag was a bit different, but it was also nice.
Coming to the service, they were pretty efficient and caring. Decoration was simple yet nice.

Location:It's very near to acropolish mall, just a few minutes walking distance at opposite lane of the mall. 

Ambience: decor wise it's a very simple restaurant. 

Food: now come to the best part of the place I.e. food. OH MY GOD!!!! Everything we ordered was so awesome that we forgot to click a single picture at all!! As starter wanted to try to different flavours. Hence ordered mutton adrek k panje , lasooni chicken kabab and ajwani fish tikka. All of them were just too good. Mutton kebab was so soft and juicy we hadnever had so good kebab before. Chicken has its Cassini flavour in it too. Fish was well cooked and had exact proportion of ajwani flavour.

Then we ordered Kabul naan and garlic naan along with chicken tikka butter masala as a main course. Gravy was of well amount and tasty. Gone really well with both of the naans. Here a tips. Their Kabul naan is famous and best thingis you  an have it with mutton kebab too.

As we were already too full, only ordered for no as dessert and it was ok ok.

Service: the staff and the delivery time both are very prompt and spontaneous.

A Friday night dinner went really yum. A big thumbs up to the full team of panjabee rasoi. Job done really well, keep it up and all the best.😎😃

Another little gem of a restaurant catering to the North Indian cuisine hidden in the alleys of Kasba is worthy of a visit if you're craving for finger licking and lip smacking kebabs and naans and typical punjabi delicacies on it's a la carte menu.
Though the management lacked in arranging for proper sorting and sitting because we had to wait for a good few minutes , the food that was served made up for the time lost and pain endured. 
We ordered much tandoori (full) and chicken malai kebab as appetisers. Then we ordered daal makhani and chicken butter masala and chicken bharta accompanied by butter naan and cheese garlic naan and some more garlic naan and we had cucumber raita for main course. Since there was almost nothing that could comprise a dessert, we didn't order any. 
The food is awesome. Seriously awesome and perfectly done. So it is a delight to visit.

Mutton adrak ki punje.... I go to this place and order only this.... Just heavenly... I see ppl coming and ordering different things and feel bad for them frankly... Other food available is also very good(dal makhani is really good) but the mutton starter is the best in the city... I order only this and the waiters give such a nice satisfying smile which tells u that u r ordering the best thing.... Place bit small which leads to some waiting time on weekends....

While searching for a good north indian in zomato , found this restaurant named Punjabee Rasoi .The rating indicated it's a very good restaurant.So we,a group of 5,visited this restaurant.
The Outside look of the restuarant is not so impressive , however as entered the restaurant we saw a wall full of awards , this meant there is something amazing about the restaurant . 
Now , the interior was good . well maintained.
For Starters we ordered :
Mutton Adrak Ke Panje - Superb.The most amazing kebab i ever had , it was very soft , juicy and well marinated.
Chicken Pahari - Excellent.
For Main Course ;
Chicken Tikka Butter Masala - Superb
Dal Makhani - Superb
Palak Corn -  Excellent

One who is a great fan of north indian food should visit here !

The decor and the food of this place is top notch. A fairly reasonable price they offer. Their kebabs are to die for.
Must try:
* Chicken lehsooni kebab
* Kadai chicken
* Chicken tandoori.
You might opt for their biriyani..it is not so amazing but a fair deal to try upon.

Chicken Tikka butter masala was really good. Mutton punja was good to taste but the bone quantity was too much. Lasooni Chicken was good to taste but was a bit on the burnt side. Mutton keema can be better. Overall a good place for North Indian food. The place is expensive when the overall outlook of the restaurant is considered. Byepass Dhaba is way better in food taste and price.

Got recommendation from an office colleague. Situated just across the Acropolis Mall.
To describe in one word, it is AWESOME. One the best places that offers north Indian delights in town.

Starters: Murg Khusnawa Kebab and Mutton Adrak Ke Punje-- these two are the absolute master class from them. I mean, you will have the hangover of these for next few days for sure. We also tried Murg Lasuni Kebab and Ajwani Fish Tikka.

Main Course: Took Cheese Kali Mirch Kulcha along with Mutton Keema Matar Masala and Mutton Kassa. The Mutton was soft as hell believe me. Cheese Kali Mirch Kulcha was another fantastic item from them.

Dessert: Well, there was no room for us after that humongous dinner. So we took only firni and it was okay.

Ambience was normal. There was a chanting type tone was going on in the background and it was very soothing for the mood.
One thing I must mention while closing this review, the behavior of the staffs. They were absolutely polite and friendly from the very beginning and was continuously in contact with us with the status of the orders.
A must visit for North Indian food lovers.

We 8 were there on 2nd and had gone for dinner..ambience was good...waiters were nice...as there were no 8 seated table...
Orders were mutton adrak ke punje, murg lasuni kebab, kabuki Naan, chikn Tikka butter masala, keema Naan, mutton keema. Murg lasuni was the best. But the mutton disappoint me.  It was below my expectation.rest of the dishes were good. Mutton keema was also very good. Overall was good but mutton adrak ke punje comes approx 360 for  piece . For the price tag, it is not worth it. Pocket pinch was approx 3000 out of which 1200 was for the mutton...otherwise everythng was good..

Serving delicious food with amazing hospitality. Visited this place for sunday dinner after shopping at acropolis. Little difficult to locate but gps will help you in tht. It is in the bylanes of kmc building.
U will feel amazing by seeing the picture of golden temple at entrance and continuous chanting of 'wahe guru' in a low volume. The restaurant is in 1st floor so uve to climb stairs(there is no lift). 
When we entered this place was packed with families eating sunday dinner. 
We ordered chicken lasuni kebab(4pc) nd mutton adrak ke punje( this are mutton ribs kebab nd r soft. This was 3pc in a plate but they are priced as per piece so u can order 4/5 and they cost @rs125/pc)
Then came our butter nun soft lathered with butter accompanied with mutton kassa nd chicken bharta. Mutton in kassa was a little hard but chicken bharta with egg was one of the best. Chicken biryani was of good quantity with potato nd a big piece of chicken(its kind of punjabi biryani types) and we ordered a mixed raita. Raita was just awesum...ive not had this good raita for ages.
We wre all stuffed bt still was craving for a sweetdish. No sweetdish was on their menu. I askd them nd they said they have firni( its good thick nd grainy) but in a punjabi restro like this i would prefer to have atleast halwa in ghee(amritsar golden templewali) or gajar ka halwa( since its winter). 
Food was very good with good quantity nd quality. But would like to tell onething please change the tissue papers to tissue napkins as that suits ure eating place more. Loved this place nd would love to visit again.

This restaurent is certainly one of the best in Kolkata that i have to been. The atmosphere is perfect and food quality is beyond awesome. The staffs are well behaved and that certainly adds plus points. We ordered the Plain Nun and Chicken Kadai. The Chicken Kadai tasted better than all the restaurent I have been too. The price are also pretty decent, though the restaurent is a little tough to locate, but the food does make up for that.

Kebabs are a must try. Lasuni kebab and mutton adrek ke panje are my personal favorite. 
Palak corn and dal makhani steal the show in the veg section. 
Courteous stuff and home like feel.

Serving delicious food with amazing hospitality. Visited this place for sunday dinner after shopping at acropolis. Little difficult to locate but gps will help you in tht. It is in the bylanes of kmc building.
U will feel amazing by seeing the picture of golden temple at entrance and continuous chanting of 'wahe guru' in a low volume. The restaurant is in 1st floor so uve to climb stairs(there is no lift). 
When we entered this place was packed with families eating sunday dinner. 
We ordered chicken lasuni kebab(4pc) nd mutton adrak ke punje( this are mutton ribs kebab nd r soft. This was 3pc in a plate but they are priced as per piece so u can order 4/5 and they cost @rs125/pc)
Then came our butter nun soft lathered with butter accompanied with mutton kassa nd chicken bharta. Mutton in kassa was a little hard but chicken bharta with egg was one of the best. Chicken biryani was of good quantity with potato nd a big piece of chicken(its kind of punjabi biryani types) and we ordered a mixed raita. Raita was just awesum...ive not had this good raita for ages.
We wre all stuffed bt still was craving for a sweetdish. No sweetdish was on their menu. I askd them nd they said they have firni( its good thick nd grainy) but in a punjabi restro like this i would prefer to have atleast halwa in ghee(amritsar golden templewali) or gajar ka halwa( since its winter). 
Food was very good with good quantity nd quality. But would like to tell onething please change the tissue papers to tissue napkins as that suits ure eating place more. Loved this place nd would love to visit again.

This restaurent is certainly one of the best in Kolkata that i have to been. The atmosphere is perfect and food quality is beyond awesome. The staffs are well behaved and that certainly adds plus points. We ordered the Plain Nun and Chicken Kadai. The Chicken Kadai tasted better than all the restaurent I have been too. The price are also pretty decent, though the restaurent is a little tough to locate, but the food does make up for that.

This place was in my wishlist for a long time and when finally I visited, it did not quite live up to my expectations. Mutton Adrak ke punje , Chicken tikka butter masala are supposedly the mast haves here. We had also ordered Chicken Biriyani. Talking of the starter, it was good. But the chicken tikka butter masala they serve is very average, something which you can get in local Mughlai joints. Definitely do not try Chicken Biriyani if you are here. Given the ambience and the food they serve, I found the prices here to be quite high. Overall, not an experience that I enjoyed .

I have tasted almost all the non veg items..but my favorite is adrak ke punje..omg it tastes sooo damn good..
Each and every item is different from one another 
The main thing which attracts me alot is their hospitality..
The manager of this place is so friendly..

Situated close to Acropolis Mall.
I have tried the mutton biriyani, tandoori roti, garlic naan, pudina paratha and chicken tikka butter masala.
The biriyani was light and flavourful and the mutton was soft and juicy.
The breads were all pretty standard but I didn't enjoy the pudina paratha as much.
The chicken butter masala is to die for!
Juicy boneless chicken pieces in an awesomely flavoured gravy.
The best chicken tikka butter masala I have ever tasted!
A must visit place.

P.S. The food was so tasty that I forgot to click pictures!

Walking distance away from Acropolis Mall. A pocket friendly family restaurant. Ordered Mutton Makhmali Kebab for starter. It was really like Makhmal. So tasty & soft. The Kabuli Naan is worth mentioning.
Other than the food, I just really liked the picture of the Golden Temple of Amritsar. It was an eye soother.

This is my first visit to this place. Well we ordered for Mutton Adrak ke punje kebab,  it was superb, the quality of the mutton was too good, it comes whole size.  Nd we tried chicken lasuni kebab. Which was also nice. Then in main course we ordered for Mutton Biriyani with bundi raita, superb taste, and moreover for people who are concerned abt healthy food belive me it won't be like those dalda heavy ghee biriyani. Very tasty and healthy. The decor was decent. Enjoyed the food very much will like to visit many more time.

I was searching for good punjabi cuisine restaurant. Saw this one in zomato. The rating indicated it's a very good restaurant. I ordered for home delivery adrak mutton k panje, dal makhani, chicken boneless tarka, tandoori roti, jeera pulao. 

They delivered food at promised time so it's 5.0 for that. Now about food-

Adrak mutton panje- very good
Dal makhani- bad, no taste at all, disappointed
Tandoori roti- ok
Chicken boneless tarka- ok
Jeera pulao- good

I am not sure if this was one of their offdays or what, but I am not very satisfied with the food.

This place is located just opposite to Acropolis Mall and one of the best known for its mouth watering kebabs. Must try place for all foodies as it has a great ambience.

It should ne enlisted in punjab di shaan, great food no bull and one of the hidden gems. 

Kabuli naan and mutton kassa goes hand in hand. 

Their biriyani totally tastes different from the regular road side biriyani. It has its own signature which makes the biriyani taste great. 

At the end the owner personally takes feedback from every individual.

Ambience and Staff courtesy wise , this place is good. Sitting arrangements are just comfortable enough to enjoy a happy meal with family and friends. Service is prompt and satisfactory. 

Now , coming to food, we ordered:
Ajwani Fish Tikka - 4/5
Fish Tikka Butter masala - 5/5 (Best one tasted in town so far)
Chicken Tikka Butter Masala - 5/5 (Best in quantity enough for 4 people for one plate)
Chicken Biryani - 4.5/5
Tandoori Roti - 5/5 (Perfectly prepared)

In all this was a great place at a price which will not pinch your wallet. A must visit if you are in for a good meal at great cheap price.

The attendant didn't find it compulsory to check that they have provided the chutney and kuchumber salad with or not as they forgot to put them in the packet. Butter Naan taste was disaster seems so cheap.

Near the acropolis mall, do pay a visit to this nawabi food house.. The ambience is simple, services are excellent and the food is delicious. Do try their kebab and Mutton dishes. Rotis and naans are their speciality. We had tried Mutton adrak ke punje and murg lasooni kebab. Kabuli naan and chicken biriyani. The quantity is quite good.

Punjabee Rasoi is located within 3 minutes walking distance from Acropolis Mall. We went there for Shoshti lunch.The place has decent seating arrangements , quite minimal decoration but simplicity is the important key in many cases.

Coming to the food,I have something to point out. The menu needs more variation included in the main course. We ordered the following -

|| Drinks ||

√ Fresh Lime Soda : This was really refreshing.

|| Starters ||

√ Murgh Lasooni Kebab : This was one of thr showstoppers of the evening.Theyer three pieces if you take half plate . The pieces were soft and succulent and tasted heavenly. The chatni was also very tasty. Highly recommended !!

√ Mutton Adrak e Punje : This is one of the best mutton kebabs I have tasted. Highly recommended !

|| Main Course ||

√ Chicken Tikka Butter Masala : It tasted exactly as it should. The masalas were perfectly added and the pieces were also decent.

√ Butter Naan : The naan was decently cooked and great !

√ Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala : This is one of the best chicken preparations I had in my entire life. The creamy gravy and chicken coated with that stole our hearts for the evening. Highly recommended !!

√ Mutton Keema : This dish was average compared to the rest . But still it was good enough.

|| Desserts ||

√ Firni : It was really goof but did not reach our high expectations from this place. The kebabs and butter chicken set the bar too high for the other food items actually 😅

The staff were courteous and helpful.

Overall,it was a great experience ♥

We visited this place during the puja. One thing I like about this restaurant is that you can order by number if u want not by plates.. For example if there are 3 people in your groups you can order 3 kebabs not plates.. So no worry of sharing among friends .
Coming to food we ordered Chicken lasooni kebab,mutton adrak ke punje as starters then Butter Naan, kabuli naan, masala kulcha; chicken biriyani and chicken butter masala as main course. Sadly no dessert was available in the menu.
The two starters were extremely fabulous .We liked all the foods except the kabuli naan. It was sweet and covered with nuts. Biriyani was okayish. Overall a good experience

Coming to the food..we ordered plain nun, kabuli nun, chicken reshmi kebab, and chicken tikka butter moshala, and 2 glass of lime soda. Kabuli nun was the new item amongst them also. I preferred the tikka butter masala the most 

Food quality was good..quantity was okayish. Bt the service is not prompt.

Near the acropolis mall, do pay a visit to this nawabi food house.. The ambience is simple, services are excellent and the food is delicious. Do try their kebab and Mutton dishes. Rotis and naans are their speciality. We had tried Mutton adrak ke punje and murg lasooni kebab. Kabuli naan and chicken biriyani. The quantity is quite good.

Punjabee Rasoi is located within 3 minutes walking distance from Acropolis Mall. We went there for Shoshti lunch.The place has decent seating arrangements , quite minimal decoration but simplicity is the important key in many cases.

Coming to the food,I have something to point out. The menu needs more variation included in the main course. We ordered the following -

|| Drinks ||

√ Fresh Lime Soda : This was really refreshing.

|| Starters ||

√ Murgh Lasooni Kebab : This was one of thr showstoppers of the evening.Theyer three pieces if you take half plate . The pieces were soft and succulent and tasted heavenly. The chatni was also very tasty. Highly recommended !!

√ Mutton Adrak e Punje : This is one of the best mutton kebabs I have tasted. Highly recommended !

|| Main Course ||

√ Chicken Tikka Butter Masala : It tasted exactly as it should. The masalas were perfectly added and the pieces were also decent.

√ Butter Naan : The naan was decently cooked and great !

√ Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala : This is one of the best chicken preparations I had in my entire life. The creamy gravy and chicken coated with that stole our hearts for the evening. Highly recommended !!

√ Mutton Keema : This dish was average compared to the rest . But still it was good enough.

|| Desserts ||

√ Firni : It was really goof but did not reach our high expectations from this place. The kebabs and butter chicken set the bar too high for the other food items actually 😅

The staff were courteous and helpful.

Overall,it was a great experience ♥

We visited this place during the puja. One thing I like about this restaurant is that you can order by number if u want not by plates.. For example if there are 3 people in your groups you can order 3 kebabs not plates.. So no worry of sharing among friends .
Coming to food we ordered Chicken lasooni kebab,mutton adrak ke punje as starters then Butter Naan, kabuli naan, masala kulcha; chicken biriyani and chicken butter masala as main course. Sadly no dessert was available in the menu.
The two starters were extremely fabulous .We liked all the foods except the kabuli naan. It was sweet and covered with nuts. Biriyani was okayish. Overall a good experience

Have you ever been to a place where everything just feels like you belong; with its pleasant, calming and homely vibes? Punjabee Rasoi is just like that - home. Located 5 minutes walking distance from Acropolis Mall, this place really took me by surprise. So, let me tell you whether or not it's worth going to or not. 

1. Mutton Adrak de Panje: Fabulously cooked mutton marinated in some splendid spices. Which made it taste so much better. Great starter.

2. Murg Lasuni Kebab: Chicken kebab that you can't stop taking a bite of and which melted off the bone. Crispy delight. Another great starter.

3. Chicken Tikka Butter Masala: Fantastic chicken in THE BEST gravy I've perhaps had. It was creamy. The chicken was delectable, with just the right amount of savouriness of the gravy that made for a terrific dish. I had it with butter naan and couldn't have asked for a better pairing. 

4. Mutton Jhal Farezi: Succulent pieces of mutton that melted so easily. The alluring aroma! My god. Coupled with just the right amount of spices and capsicum. It had just the right balance of sweetness and savouriness that made for simply an amazing dish. Most definitely the best dish I had here. 

My only gripe was that we couldn't have the firni because they didn't have dessert prepared there. Oh well, maybe next time.

The staff was very courteous and attended to our needs promptly, without much delay. Especially since it was peak hours for them. 

This is one of the, if not the best places for North Indian I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. So do I recommend this place? Hell yes I do! Go there and be amazed by the quality of food and hospitality. I'll definitely come back here again.

It's one of the best North Indian Restaurant in Kolkata, though it is situated in the interior alley near to Acropolis Mall, it's hard to locate if you are first timer.
Moreover the food quality is superb though as a quantitiy is a little bit short. Murgh Lehsuni Kabab, Kaabuli Nun, Mutton Adrak ke Punje is a must try.
Biriyanis are also great. Chicken Tikka Butter Masala was also very good.
Staffs are pretty good but the service is awfully slow.

Situated opposite to Accropolis mall,not so easy to locate...we went there for lunch..the restaurant was crowded..waited for 15 minutes to get a table.. Ordered their signature dish - Mutton adrak ke panje- which was good...also ordered - Murgh lehsuni kebab...kabuli naan and chicken bharta...Lehsuni kebab was okay but their kabuli naan was not upto the mark,it was full of almonds....And we found hair in the naan which was really irritating and after that they given us fresh kabuli naan when we complained but unfortunately we found hair again- which was not expected from a restaurant like punjabi rasooi...
Overall not a good experience... :-( :-(

We had ordered Mutton adraki panje and Chicken Tandoori for staters, Mutton Saag and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala for the main course . Mutton adraki panje was the best kebab i ever had , Chicken Tandoori was brilliant.Plus the main course was as tasty as the staters. A wonderful experience.

Probably the best North Indian food I ever had. Would surely make a revisit.

was not in a mood to have north-indian food that day. But, as soon as  I had a first bite of "mutton adrak k panje"  realised I have made the right decision to end up  having dining over here.
its heaven. I strongly suggest it.  Along with this goes kulcha or naan and any mutton curry for main course.  Loved it!

Up for a perfect dinner? Punjabi Rasoi has the best delicacies for you! 
Have been there a couple of times and it never failed to amaze me. 
Would love to name a few items that are a must-try: 

1) Murgh Lasooni Kebab
2) Kabuli Naan
3) Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala
4) Chicken Kadhai
5) Hyderabadi Mutton Biriyani 
and last but not the least, 
The Fresh Lime Soda ❤

Coming to the ambience, it has the ideal one. With soft music playing in the background and mild lighting, you can sit for hours and relax while savouring the dishes! Wish to visit there soon again 😍

Food is made with  a lot of TLC. I have seen people eat their dal makhni leaving aside non veg preparations. I just love it.

Food that's worth spending for. This small joint is located in kasba and this was my second visit and ofcourse the quality of the food is always on the top. 
 As for starters we had their signature dish Mutton adrak ke panje and oh yeah u will fall in love with the dish if you're fond of mutton. To my surprise I also had chicken lahsuni kabab n I found it awesome inspite of being a mutton fan. As for main course we had garlic naan n Kabuli naan with chicken tikka masala which was also lip smacking!!
So overall if someone is looking for best quality food with nice ambience n ofcourse under budget this will be the place to visit for. So Punjabi Rasoi u will get a big thumbs up from me...

Located in place where car parking is great problem. So many cars, we had to park almost 1km far from restaurant. . Then according to other reviews our expectations rised, that this must be a great restaurant.. but food Quality was average, nothing special... Food in veg dish, babycorn was not cooked properly, we can feel them uncooked.... Menu items are highly priced, which could be available at cheaper rates at any north indian dhaba restaurant.... in salad they used rotten carrots & served them... When I got there there was no one to talk to, we walked to an waiter & spoke to him. There is no reception to keep note of people in queue. Everyone is standing infront of table ( moment you finish - they sit down) ...
Only positive fact about this restaurant, nice punjabi ambiance.& Clean toilets&handwash area... Anyway this was our first & hopefully last visit to Punjabee Rasoi... Last suggestion - if management is reading this - "get a good chef"

I feel hungry as soon as tge name comes up.. too tasty food to have in such an odd location (considering the by lane where it is situated). Best north indian joint. Biriyani, kebabs, side dishes, you name it. The lasooni kebab and adrak-e-panja is my fav. Biriyani is a must have. The best thing they have in there is no fixed number of pieces in a plate. You can order according to your choice. That saves a lot if you go in group. Had visited thrice and will visit again. Only the wash rooms are too messed up.

We went to this restaurant on 15th August and had one of the best lunch. 
For appetizers we ordered chicken tandoor which was quite delicious and juicy
and mutton adrak k punje.. This one was really tender and nice do give this one a try
Then for main course we ordered cheese garlic naan, plain naan, chicken reshmi masala.. (This was was really great with quite big sizes of reshmi kababs in gravy and this was suggested by the waiter) 
For dessert we ordered Firni ( I love this dish anyways )
Overall a great lunch both me and my friend enjoyed a lot looking forward to visit this place again.

Strongly recommended

P.S.
The only negative point is that it is located in little interior area so it was little difficult to locate the place. For everyone of you here it is practically a 5mins walk from Acropolis mall but you have to ask people around to reach the place as it is not on the main road.

Everything was really exceptional and the staffs were well mannered and professional! No wonder the restaurant got the awards for best North Indian cuisine by many reputed councils in succession for past 4 years!!! I highly recommend you people to go and try it for a tempting gastronomic adventure with love from the North!

Cock a hoop!

Whenever your parents pour you with numerous gifts and surprises, it always satisfies your heart, however, when you revere them with surprises or small gifts, it delights your soul more than anything.

Thus, the day was planned, we went for a feminine movie, offered by My Lady herself and later I took them for lunch in Punjabee Rasoi. I have visited this place before, almost 3years back though during Durga Puja. This was the second time. 

As read its review for good Punjabee style non-veg delicacies so was eager to swallow them down. Therefore, the choice were Mutton adrak ke punje as starter: which was extremely soft, juicy and amazing in taste. I can still drool for it. And for main course our picks were Mutton keema mattar masala, humongous in quantity and stupendous in taste; fish tikka butter masala: it was delicious though I felt this dish was bit above range in bucks based on its quality & quantity. And Mutton biryani, well one of the only dishes for Bengalis for which either they can die or they can kill. It was luscious. 

And apart from food what I earned more on that precise day was my father's happiness. Hope to pour that more on him.

Lasuni kebab, adrak ke panje( no one makes better mutton kebabs than them) and the sometimes available khushnawa kebab ( the filling is a pleasant surprise). There are other items on their menu, but really don't remember any. These 3 are the jewels of the crown. So, what are you waiting for?? Go...

We ordered murgh malai kebab, fish ajwani kabab, biryani, garlic nan, chicken tikka butter masala and mutton keema masala for 4 people. Quantity was huge. The food tasted out of the world. The meat and fish were blasting with flavours and just melted in my mouth. Service is prompt. I would love to visit this place again

This restaurant is famous for its Indian cuisine and it offers amazing Indian preparations. The dal makhani and the kabuli naan is my favourite, not to mention the delicious tengri kebab.

One of the best joints serving North Indian cuisine.. the place was a little hideous but the food oh boy did it hit the spot.. go for kabuli naan, cheese naan( with layer of melted cheese inside ) chicken tikka butter masala, Rogan Josh.. these items are what I had .. and I am gladly looking for my next visit hopefully to try their other items as well..

I am happy that apps like Zomato exist. Otherwise I doubt that I would have scoured the lanes and by-lanes of Kolkata, reaching a restaurant like this one. This is a simple restaurant which focuses most of its energies on the one thing that matters most, the food. I tried some of their signature dishes like Mutton Adrak ke Punje, Murg Lasuni kebab, the Dal Makhani (which comes in a cute bucket) along with their Naans. All of them were of a high standard. The service during our late afternoon lunch was very prompt and the server courteous. The prices are reasonable (though not exactly cheap). Overall a good experience. We need more hidden gems like this in Kolkata, places where owners focus on getting the basics right, instead of wasting their time and energy on fancy décors and flashy names.

One of the best, kebab and north Indian serving restaurants in south kolkata. Chicken qalmi kebab, mutton bhara kebab are simply best they produce in kebab section, do try those. In the mains hara mutton, kabuli naan, daal makhani, chicken tikka better masala are too good to taste. service is little slow as they say after placing ur order they strat to grill you choic of kebabs. Neways be there have patience anf enjoy the foods they serve. Ambiance is okiesh. Moderate pricing :)

Bit difficult to find if u r not an inhabitant of kasba area..located opposite acropolis mall,in a lane..
Decor is peaceful ..with gurdwara type enchanting making u feel more devotional rather than hungry!!
Coming to food - they are quite good..worth tasting mutton adrak ke panje..basically mutton kabab..well marinated,juicy inside..it's now almost been their signature dish..others are good two..
Service is rather cold..
I faced problem with bill payment though..but that is not really a big deal..overall good but somewhat costly

Been to this place somedays back and had the best kebab till now. The KHUSHNUWA KABAB was suggested by the service staffs and frankly i was a bit apprehensive as I never had it before but when they served it with salad the very appearance of it can stimulate one's gastronomic glands. It's basically chicken pieces with dry fruit stuffing and it is prepared so well that it almost melts in your mouth.
The biriyani was average though nothing out of the world but the KHUSHNUWA KEBAB is the dish which will drive me back to this place soon..

Yesterday was my birthday and went for dinner after a long research on Google and Zomato. We ordered their signature dishes mutton adrak ke punje, murg lasooni kabab, masala kulcha and chicken tikka masala. All were just delicious, dal makhni and butter roti are also good options to choose. Staffs were polite and helpful on choosing items. I would rate them 4, would like to visit again.

P.S it might be a little difficult to locate this place but you can reach Acropolis mall and follow google map and u will be there.

Went for this one last Wednesday atlast. It was quite crowded for a weekday. First of all, the atmosphere of the restaurant is very soothing. They really placed every pieces of decorations beautifully. 
Now as for the food goes, it is undoubtedly one of the best in kolkata. We ordered the fan's favourite Murg Lasuni kebab first. Frankly, the taste is heavenly. The soft pices of chicken is to die for. 
Then we went for Tandoori rooti, Masala kulcha and my favorite Reshmi butter masala. The Tandoori was alright, nothing special though. The kulcha, soft greasy, filled with a somewhat sweet masala is a better companion with Reshmi butter masala in my openion. Now the Reshmi butter masala was a hit and I have tasted this this many places. You can taste the amount of care and love that was put into this dish. The staff is very helpful and feel free to ask for their advice. Looking forward to visit again soon.

Another north indian gem tucked away in a small lane just opposite to the acropolis mall ,Punjabee Rasoi lives up to its name. A pre-birthday dinner on late night we landed here only to be blow away by their delicacies. It is quite difficult to make out the place from outside but once u step in the decor is neat and on point. Well the simple decor was not a problem when their food speaks for them. We ordered for the

1.Mutton Adrak ke panje
2.Chicken Lahsuni kebab

Both the starters are recommended specially the Adrak ke panje .The meat so tender that it falls of the bone.The lahsuni kebab has a significant taste which is not overpowering but just enough to make it last in your mouth even after polishing it off the plate.

Next came the main course

3.Butter nan
4.Cheese garlic naan
5.Egg masala
6.mutton keema matar masala

The naan was soft and had generous amount of garlic in it.Since i am a huge fan of garlic naan i dont mind the quantity.Each naan had 3pieces which is enough for a meal for two.The egg masala was average and had two eggs in a spicy gravy masala.The mutton keema was quite a large portion for two but who is complaining when your dish is that yummylicious. Two glasses of sweet lime soda served along side with the grand dinner but they were not chilled enough.

Punjabee Rasoi is here for the long run.Simple menu including flavour punches is their USP. Keep up the good work

This place was for long on my wish list. Finally went to the place for a weekend dinner. The place is clean , staffs are very well behaved and customer friendly. Suggests awesome choices.
As per the suggestions of the staff we ordered one of their signature dish chicken tangri kabab. The kababs were very will cooked, well spiced and large chunky chicken legs. Absolutely marvelous to eat.
The Hyderabadi biriyani biriyani was very spice and had whole spices and veggies . Tasty to eat, meat was succulent and well spices and large. The special mutton biriyani was also very good. Mutton pieces were good. They gave extra potato on request if you share the plate. However the raita was too sweet to pair with biriyani. The sweetness killed the freshness of the cucumber and onion.
Overall it's a nice place. However the price is on higher side if compared with quality and quantity.

This is my favourite place for North Indian food today onwards, undoubtedly. Today we tried some of their signature dishes like Mutton Adrak ke punje, Chicken lasooni kebab, Mutton keema matar masala along with butter nun and Malai kulcha. All of them were outstanding in taste. A special mention obviously needed for Mutton Adrak ki punje, because it is the best mutton dish, I have ever had. The mutton was so tender, it melted in mouth. All I can say, it was a brilliant Sunday lunch for me.

Heard a lot. about this place both online and off it. so we ordered chickhen tandoori, butter naan and mix veg.. Franlkly speaking chickhen tandoori was under cooked with the masala being completely raw. Applying white oil on naan and calling it butter naan is blasphemy and cheating customers. mix veg was atleast eatable.. and it was a home delivery which was so late than time given that i started wondering if i wud myself go and collect my order.

I had heard that it was there for a very long time, located away from the grandeur and opulence of Acropolis Mall, Kasba in the lane opposite to the gigantic Mall. It wasn't as popular earlier as it had earned its fair share of attention from the foodie fraternity of our always-hungry metropolitan in the recent years due to the advent of Zomato and foodie groups hence. My didi and I went there after a hectic day at college. We had the famous Mutton Adrak ke Punje, their best on the menu. And, best it was indeed. The soft and succulent pieces melted at the instant you put them in you mouth. Fish Ajwani Tikka and Murgh Lasuni Kebabs also followed as starters thereafter. They were pretty good as well. We also tasted their Kabuli Naan which had khoya and badam raisins garnished on top.All in all, the first time visit went in the right direction so much so that it calls for another visit. :)   with

It is located near Acropolis mall.The exterior is not impressing but as you enter their 1st floor, the soft melody of punjabi devotional songs will soothe your senses. Coming to the food, they serve one of the best punjabi cuisines in the city. We ordered murg lasuni kebab, mutton adrak ke panje, kabuli naan and chicken tikka masala. The quantity is huge. The kebab was so soft with the perfect blend of spices and a lingering flavour of garlic. Adrak ke punj- one piece is sufficient for one person. Personally I found the kebab better. Kabuli naan is a complete dish in itself. Topped with varieties of dry fruits, a single piece of this mildly sweet naan was the star of the evening. The waiters are polite and they will adjust the quantity of the dish according to your order. Will surely visit again.

In one word - Superb! The first time I visited it was at  lunch time and there wasn't a rush. We savoured  mutton adrak ke panje, paalak corn, chicken tikka butter masala with butter naan and masala kulcha. After we had ordered they insisted we must try the Dal Makhani. As we were only 3 people we said we'll try next time. But when the food arrived, they had added a complimentary portion of Dal Makhani for us - and it was smooth and excellent. After the first visit I often had cravings, esp for the paalak corn. Next time we visited for dinner, and yes there was a rush. We tried murg lasuni kabab - they are like drumsticks - 4 pcs in a full plate. It was heavenly. We just had to repeat dal makhani and paalak corn. Additionally we had mutton keema - it was a bit spicy but good to taste. Pujabee Rasoi does full justice to utterly 'butterly' delicious food.

The food was finger licking and delicious. The thing which surprised me more is their super fast service, it was lightning fast. We were impressed indeed. We ordered adrak ke panje (their speciality, a sort of mutton kabab with bone) as starter along with fresh lime soda sweet. Main course included kabuli naan, masala kulcha, palak corn, daal makhani and chicken tikka butter masala. All of them were awesome, special mention - daal makhani. Ambiance is really good and so is service. Would visit soon. A real gem. Prices are on the higher side but it worths every penny.

The food is amazing - probably the best North Indian I have ever had. We had ordered Chicken Kadai, Chicken Bharta, Butter Naan and Peas Pulao for the main course with Lahsuni Kebab as the starter. The taste is absolutely impeccable, especially the rice which was cooked in butter. A wonderful experience.
P.S. - The food is spicy and rich in butter and ghee, so not for those looking for something light.

I don't remember having a single dish in this place which tasted average...each and everything they serve is way too delicious. But you have to try the dish they are most famous for - "adrak ke panje" which is basically a mutton kebab. Take this dish for starters since it's on a dry side. 
Another favourite of mine is the "kabuli naan" but u should only try it if you have a sweet tooth or u don't mind sweet flavour in savoury dishes. They serve this naan which has six slices n since it's filled with nuts it's quite heavy; so 1 naan should be enough for 2 people. It's also advisable to have it with something spicy so that it balances the sweetness of the naan.
If you go there once u will surely want to come back again n again :)

You want to gulp down some super awesome Punjabi delicacies, then do try out this rasoi (kitchen) in Kasba, Kolkata. One of the top rated restaurants for their unique features-“PUNJABEE RASOI“. A sumptuous meal is incomplete without a single bite of juicy mutton. So if you also share the same feeling then without having a single thought you are going to order this dish right away after stepping in.

I am a regular customer here from 2013. I don't know whether I should feel bad or good but frankly till date I haven't tried anything apart from Chicken Lasooni Kabab, Mutton Adrak ke Punje and the Kabuli Naan but yesterday itself I was there with my boyfriend and wanted to try something new. Thus we ordered Fish Butter Tikka Masala. The new dish was all nice but I felt the fish was little smelly which I didn't like. Anyway it is and will always be my first option to have punjabi khana.

This is quite a gem. Located near Acropolis Mall, I have visited this restaurant quite a few times. Their biriyani is legendary- truly north Indian style. The kebabs are to die for. The ambience is alright. The only con of this place is they don't accept cards. Otherwise it's a fine place to treat your taste buds with mutton and spices...

I am a regular customer here from 2013. I don't know whether I should feel bad or good but frankly till date I haven't tried anything apart from Chicken Lasooni Kabab, Mutton Adrak ke Punje and the Kabuli Naan but yesterday itself I was there with my boyfriend and wanted to try something new. Thus we ordered Fish Butter Tikka Masala. The new dish was all nice but I felt the fish was little smelly which I didn't like. Anyway it is and will always be my first option to have punjabi khana.

This is quite a gem. Located near Acropolis Mall, I have visited this restaurant quite a few times. Their biriyani is legendary- truly north Indian style. The kebabs are to die for. The ambience is alright. The only con of this place is they don't accept cards. Otherwise it's a fine place to treat your taste buds with mutton and spices...

Mutton adrak de punje was extremely succulent. It is so difficult to make mutton so soft, that too a portion from the chap region. It was extremely flavorful. We followed it up with dal makhani and naan. Although I prefer eating non veg, but this came highly recommended. Tell you what, it did not disappoint at all. The dal was just awesome. Reminded me of dal makhani from ITC Maratha. The Naan was a masterpiece too. We topped it off with mutton biriyani. This was made with such care. The potato had just the right amount of softness. The rice was well made too. All in all this is definitely one of the best north indian food I have had in a while. This is a must visit place for anyone visiting Kolkata.

Situated at the back of acropolis mall, inside the lanes of kasba the place was decorated above my expectations. Being completely vegetarian ordered dal makhani, malai kofta and veg biryani. Food was very good. Service was fast and despite being a big rowdy group the management treated us very well.

I think its high time to stop spending on zomato for fake reviews n invest that money on better cook rather for better food. Ordered egg tadka n chicken bharta. Food was below avg not even close to a 4.5 rated eatery with brilliantly fake reviews.

share the experience in very crisp way
Food: 3.5 / 5-- liked their Adrak ke panje dish very much
Ambience: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
the driving factor for reaching this place is the rating in zomato. though I feel They can much improve on quality and quantity as per the price range they offer.

A very good North Indian Restaurant located near Acropolis Mall. The overall food quality is fantabulous . As a starter everyone should try Mutton Adrak k Punje, the dish comprises of 3 chunky pieces of grilled mutton which comes with a smoky flavor. Kaabuli Naan is one of the showstoppers here which is a treat to the taste bud but a bit sweet. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala is also good in quality and quantity. Ambience and service are decent enough. 

Recommended.

Tucked away from the glitters around the Acropolis Mall, yet just a few blocks down, in one of the quietest by lanes of Kasba is this modest dining place. Located in the ground floor of a two storied building it wasn't hard to find with the help of Google maps and the large board over the gate proudly announcing "best north indian food award winner" of consecutive 4yrs from 2013 by The Times of India.The interiors are unpretentious and simple to give a nice homely atmosphere. 
   The service was quick. Kebabs came within 10mins of ordering and the main course took 15 mins. We had lasuni murg kebab and mutton adrak k panje for the starters. Well this review has been due for a long time now, but still I can feel the heavenly taste. Mutton was tender and flavourful, and succulent juicy pieces of chicken with the titilating aroma-- one of the best few dishes I ever had. For the mains we had mutton biryani, chicken tikka butter masala, reshmi butter masala and masala kulcha and each one of them did justice to our taste buds. We left with our tummy full and content. A complete value for money experience. Highly recommended for north Indian cuisine.

This place is a hub of north indian food! After a long time i had such great north indian dishes which are so delicious! I got to hit this joint with my friends and i loved this place . Though its a small restaurant in a single floor yet the ambience was very nice .

We ordered for chicken tandoori ,lasuni kebab,mutton adrak e punje ,and we took different nuns,butter nun and kabuli nun along with egg bhuji and chicken reshmi butter masala .Each item was extremely tasty and juicy. The flavours in each item were better than the others. We had a gala time there along with the tasty food.

Servers were vert friendly . Even they offered us complimentary dal makhni and palak paneer which were also very delicious. I would like to come here again for the love of north indian cuisine.

What can I say about this place other than OMG !!!!How come I didn't know about this hidden gem !! Finally I visited there with my friends for Friday lunch . Two of my friends were Veg , so we had a mixture of veg and non veg dishes and both  were equally delicious . For starters we orders Chicken lahsuni ,Mutton Adrak ke panje , paneer tikka and bharwan alu . The mutton was so soft and was falling apart. Chicken was soft and flavourfull. Same for Bharwan alu. The filling was delicious. Paneer was okay. Now for main course , we ordered different breads. Cheese garlic naan was the best !! Malai kulcha was a bit too sweet . Butter naan was soft and buttery . The matar paneer was very good with the paneer being soft . The Chicken tikka butter masala was equally good . And the Dal makhani was the bestest ... Would definitely visit this place a lot more times ..

Arguably the best North Indian restaurant in town. The melt in the mouth fish ajwani tikka is a revelation. Calcutta bhetki marinated in signature spices and grilled to perfection...for me this was the man of the match of the dinner. Mutton adrak ke panje lived up to its reputation, however managing the bones might be an issue. Kabuli naan is a dream... Stuffed with khowa and generously studded with nuts this huge bread can be enjoyed on its own...But to counter the sweetness mutton makhmali kabab was the perfect accompaniment. Also their chicken tikka masala is far better than many famed "Mughlai" restaurants in town. Located very close to Acropolis Mall, this restaurant is indeed a gem. Highly recommended.

Finally! After 4 years of college life and planning to come here, I can finally strike off Punjabee Rasoi off of my bucket list (What? Doesn't every foodie have one of those? Don't give me those stares!). (Cue Ted Mosby voice:) And kids, please don't repeat my mistake of waiting so long to visit this place. A bit off the main road, Punjabee Rasoi is a moderately small restaurant about 5 min away from Acropolis. Most people even miss the door and pass by it till someone gives them either (a) a warm welcome (as in a waiter coming out and telling them that the restaurant is that way), or (b) they get better directions (turn left and take the 1st door to the building, don't pass by it). Anyway...... The place was packed when we visited and thus we had to wait for about 10-15 min till a table was vacant. Though small, the place is neatly furnished and the ambience is warm and homely. The part that stood out was how the ambient lighting complimented the golden walls and dark tables. Now the highlight of this restaurant is the impeccable service. Not only are the workers polite and helpful, but they also see to it that the customers can have the best possible combination, and can adjust the dishes and quantity according to your preferences. It's different from the well mannered polished politeness and care from the fine-dines, in that this place gives off that whole homely vibe. We were suggested combinations (as opposed to ordering a full plate of just one dish) of various dishes (including their signature items) and the price was adjusted accordingly and that's a huge bonus for a foodie for he/she can try a variety. Food was served in a reasonable time as well. All the dishes were delicious, spices were bang on! And the chicken or mutton was so tender that you can't help but appreciate. It's an excellent quality to be able to tell when the meat is cooked just right. But the skills shown by the chef here was on another level in this regard. And i must say, as a kebab lover, this place offers some of the best you can find in Kolkata. People, do not miss out chicken Lasuni kebab. I promise you will thank me for that. Oh and the pudina chutney served with the food was heavenly! You can't have enough of that! I really hope this restaurant expands a bit, otherwise it gets crowded during peak hours (really, there's barely place to stand if all chairs are occupied). And with the food they serve out and that service, I'm sure loads of people would appreciate it. A must visit for all kebab lovers!

This restaurant has been in my list since a long time. Finally visited here and had an awesome experience. People must atleast give a try to their biryani while visiting Acropolis mall. The restaurant is located in a residential area and it is behind Acropolis mall.

Now, coming to the restaurant. It is medium size restaurant bustling with people. The smell of the kebas while stepping inside the restaurant was making my tastebuds go crazy for a foodie like me.

It is a neat and clean restaurant with good seating arrangements. We ordered Lahsuni kebab(one of their specials) and Chicken Special Biryani and masala cold drinks.

The lahsuni kebab was too good to be true. It will just melt in your mouth leaving an after effect.

Well now coming to the biryani. The biryani was just perfect. There was aloo(being a Bong i love aloo in my biryani so it was satisfying for me), two succulent pieces of chicken and the rice was cooked to perfection. I just loved their biryani.

The masala cold drink was also good.

The service was good and upto the mark. The staffs were courteous. Though the prices are on the higher side but overall a really satisfying experience.
I would like to drop by there soon and all you Biryani lovers must do that too. Highly recommended!

** Location = Kasba, behind Acropolis Mall. We called them up to have the precise location. Thanks to zomato that helped us finding this hidden gem of a place.

**Brief = I went there with my friends and Triasha Banerjee was one of them as usual :P

** Ambiance = At the very entrance you find a humongous picture of the Golden Temple and the chantings of "wahe guru" makes one feel great, as I am brought up in a Sikh locality I felt elated to these. We had to wait for 15-20 minutes as the place was packed. The servers were very much cordial. They have a seating capacity of about 20 people more or less and probably the upstairs part of the restaurant was undergoing some sort of renovation, hence the rush.

** Things tried = Chicken Lasuni Kebab(Full), Chicken Tandoori(Full), Mutton Adrak Ke Punje(usually consists of 3 pieces but one can add one more piece to that).
The food took about 7-8 minutes to be placed on the table. The starters were just too good, Lasuni Kebab was really succulent and tasty. Chicken tanduri was also superb. The Mutton Adrak Ke Punje was also really fresh and the mutton pieces were huge.

In the mains we ordered Garlic Nan,Butter Nan, Kabuli Nun and they were accompanied with Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Egg Bhujiya.
I loved Chicken Reshmi butter masala more , but the rest of the items were really made in punjabi style just apt for their name. They even complimented us to taste their speciality being Dal Makhani and Palak Corn. The dal makhani is a must have here, it was just too good to be true. 

**Recommended = Dal Makhani, Lasuni Kebab,Butter Nan, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala.

** Purse Check = Our Bill came around Rs.3000/- and I think Rs.1000/- would good enough for 2 persons.

**Overall = Really a gem of a place, they serve quality food and is truly worth the ratings given to them.

However they sometime take a little time to serve , staffs are friendly.

This place is a couple of inlets away from Acropolis Mall. Trust your GPS or just ask around. It's not difficult to find.
Every time that I visited, we have been seated on the 1st floor, including today. The interiors are well decorated and waiters make sure to suggest all their signature dishes. Sometimes the owner would also come and check in on your meal.

Today, on a Friday evening almost every table was booked. Unfortunately there was a large group which was exceptionally loud for the space, and it kind of bummed our experience.
Food is simple but good. We ordered Tandoori Roti, Chicken Lasuni Kebab, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Masala Kulcha, Dal Makhani, and Fresh Lime Soda.

My highlight of the night was that Masala Kulcha. Their Lasuni Kebab is great too. The Fresh Lime Soda was too sweet for my liking. But above all, the place is a overpriced compared to the food they are serving.
Their hospitality is great. It's worth an occasional visit.

Today, on a Friday evening almost every table was booked. Unfortunately there was a large group which was exceptionally loud for the space, and it kind of bummed our experience.
Food is simple but good. We ordered Tandoori Roti, Chicken Lasuni Kebab, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Masala Kulcha, Dal Makhani, and Fresh Lime Soda.

My highlight of the night was that Masala Kulcha. Their Lasuni Kebab is great too. The Fresh Lime Soda was too sweet for my liking. But above all, the place is a overpriced compared to the food they are serving.
Their hospitality is great. It's worth an occasional visit.

This restaurant has been in my list since a long time. Finally visited here and had an awesome experience. People must atleast give a try to their biryani while visiting Acropolis mall. The restaurant is located in a residential area and it is behind Acropolis mall.

Now, coming to the restaurant. It is medium size restaurant bustling with people. The smell of the kebas while stepping inside the restaurant was making my tastebuds go crazy for a foodie like me.

It is a neat and clean restaurant with good seating arrangements. We ordered Lahsuni kebab(one of their specials) and Chicken Special Biryani and masala cold drinks.

The lahsuni kebab was too good to be true. It will just melt in your mouth leaving an after effect.

Well now coming to the biryani. The biryani was just perfect. There was aloo(being a Bong i love aloo in my biryani so it was satisfying for me), two succulent pieces of chicken and the rice was cooked to perfection. I just loved their biryani.

The masala cold drink was also good.

The service was good and upto the mark. The staffs were courteous. Though the prices are on the higher side but overall a really satisfying experience.
I would like to drop by there soon and all you Biryani lovers must do that too. Highly recommended!

** Location = Kasba, behind Acropolis Mall. We called them up to have the precise location. Thanks to zomato that helped us finding this hidden gem of a place.

**Brief = I went there with my friends and Triasha Banerjee was one of them as usual :P

** Ambiance = At the very entrance you find a humongous picture of the Golden Temple and the chantings of "wahe guru" makes one feel great, as I am brought up in a Sikh locality I felt elated to these. We had to wait for 15-20 minutes as the place was packed. The servers were very much cordial. They have a seating capacity of about 20 people more or less and probably the upstairs part of the restaurant was undergoing some sort of renovation, hence the rush.

** Things tried = Chicken Lasuni Kebab(Full), Chicken Tandoori(Full), Mutton Adrak Ke Punje(usually consists of 3 pieces but one can add one more piece to that).
The food took about 7-8 minutes to be placed on the table. The starters were just too good, Lasuni Kebab was really succulent and tasty. Chicken tanduri was also superb. The Mutton Adrak Ke Punje was also really fresh and the mutton pieces were huge.

In the mains we ordered Garlic Nan,Butter Nan, Kabuli Nun and they were accompanied with Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Egg Bhujiya.
I loved Chicken Reshmi butter masala more , but the rest of the items were really made in punjabi style just apt for their name. They even complimented us to taste their speciality being Dal Makhani and Palak Corn. The dal makhani is a must have here, it was just too good to be true. 

**Recommended = Dal Makhani, Lasuni Kebab,Butter Nan, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala.

** Purse Check = Our Bill came around Rs.3000/- and I think Rs.1000/- would good enough for 2 persons.

**Overall = Really a gem of a place, they serve quality food and is truly worth the ratings given to them.

One of my favourite North Indian Restaurents of Kolkata.


Their Lassuni Kebab, and tandoori is really good.
Jhal Farezi also rocks the scene.
Masala Kulcha is great.
So is the main courses.

This place is all about good food.

However they sometime take a little time to serve , staffs are friendly.

Decor is nice.

We chose this place because many of my friends and other known people visited here and they all praised about the food. It was my grandparents anniversary so it was a family treat. We were not at all disappointed with this restaurant. Starting from the food,the service,their accommodating nature and the ambiance everything was just perfect. I am sure you will definitely end licking your fingers as all the dishes were equally tasty and delicious. Do try the mutton kebabs. They are just 😍😍..Surely visiting this place again 😁

Excellent food. Tasted north Indian food after a long time and was thoroughly satisfied. We ordered two types of kebabs, kabli naan, tandoori paratha and chicken kadai. Ambience and decor is wonderful. The most important thing about Punjabee Rasoi is their staffs' behaviour. They are indeed very friendly and suggest while taking order.

This restaurant is like a hidden gem of kolkata. It is located in a place where it is kind of tricky to find it. But if you depend upon Google maps then its all ok. Now coming to the food part. Food here is exceptionally good. I had their signature starters which was Mutton adrak ke punjee and lesuni kebab. Both taste equally good. Special the mutton was cooked yo perfection. It was just melting in the mouth. If you are heading there try it and you will just love it. Now i have visited here quite a few times. There kabuli naan was excellent and also the garlick naan. Tge dal makhani here was equally good. Though there is a lot of scope to improve the staff behaviour. But overall i had a great time there.

The decor ambience service are all fantastic & well the food just makes you forget about everything else. A must visit for all food lovers.

A hidden gem of punjabi food in Kolkata. Located just behind acropolis mall, this was till date the best north indian restaurant I have visited. 
We had ordered kabuli nun along with mutton adrak ke punje, murgh lehsuni kebab and fish tikka. The mutton and chicken were heavenly and out of this world. Perfect melt in the mouth to have with paper thin and soft kabuli nun sprinkled generously with crushed cashwe nuts. The above food were so good that the biryani after that felt bland.
Prices are extremely reasonable. Cannot wait to visit again.

Today I was there. 
One of my old friend recommended me for this restaurant.  I'm glad that he was there today with me.
He is someone who is in hotel industry.. what I want to say he have the understanding of food much better than me.  And today we both felt love for the test of foods from here.  We love each and every dish that we ordered .. for the first time I totally depends on the ratings from zomato.  And I love it. Even i do love the hospitality from staffs.  I wish thay had a much bigger space.  But I think they are in the kind of starter in the field and a long way to go and new things to come. But definitely I recommend this one to everyone who is thinking to have there lunch or dinner after the shopping at the acropolis mall. It's beat of difficult to find the location. For me I was there after goggle navigation even after calling them. 

Thank you.

"Cooking is like love. It should be entered into with abandon or not at all." -Harriet van Horne. Situated near Acropolis Mall, Rajdanga, Kolkata, India this place describes these lines perfectly the way one should. My review today is based on-:

1. The ambience
2. Food quality and quantity
3. The service

1. The Ambience-:

The ambience is more of a basic sort. The seating is comfortable. One thing that should be kept in mind that the crowd normally in these punjabi dhaba sort of a place is not of the super quiet sort. Instead they are more of the opposite i.e. of the talkitive sort and that's one of the things that adds more colour to the picture. In a nutshell... a place where you can sit talk your heart out with your folks and at the same time take a bite....

2. Food quality and quantity

In short "The Best Part". The food of this place is the sort a person expects from a punjabi restro. Perfect blend of spices, cream perfectly blended and yes, the meat well cooked, yet juicy. We ordered for a Dal Makhani, few tandoori rotis and butter chicken of which I will be coming one by one.

A. Tandoori Rotis

Well nothing to say much about this though. This is a sort which is one of the most well known "members" of the "tandoor-oven-cooked-flatbread family". But only an expert can make it into something that perfect. Here the tandoori rotis were properly oven baked. Something which you find a bit rare in many punjabi restros.

B. Dal Makhani

Being one of the signature dishes of this place. This dish proved it "why" right the time we had a spoon of it. Dal Makhani is one of those quintessential indian dishes whose history dates back to the days of Sardar Singh's "Moti Mahal" restaurant in Dariyaganj, Delhi, following the partition of India. Dal Makhani’s popularity is due in part to its versatility and the rich vegetarian dish that can be served as a main meal, included in a buffet (thali) or as an accompaniment to a principal meal. In India, soups and curries with a red or yellow lentil base are an important staple. Preparation of dal makhani involves a series of time-consuming procedures, which can take a huge time to complete. The "dal" gets its richness from the use of cream, however, it can also be prepared with yogurt or milk. The amount of cream used in this place was absolutely fantastic, served hot and BOY.... it was something.... !!!

C. Chicken Tikka Butter Masala

Very little to say about this dishin this place as it almost brought me to my knees in front of the waiter to convince him for another plate as their kitchen was closed..... it was not his fault, it was 22:45 at night and they were doing their day's cleaning :( However he managed to get us one. I guess that is enough to review this dish. ;) lol. However speaking about the origin of this dish well... yess... it is a bit messed up. Some say that it originated in an Indian restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland over a bowl of tomato soup which was spiced up eventually to make the gravy by the probably the british bangladeshi community which ran most of the Indian restaurants back then. While recent explanations suggest that it has originated from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh during the last 50 years. Whatever be it this dish became the second most popular dish in Britain in 2012. The preparation of this dish requires a bit of hard work though. Chicken tikka masala is chicken tikka, chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt, that is then baked in a tandoor oven, and served in a masala (spice mix) sauce. A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but there is no standard recipe for chicken tikka masala. The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as purée), cream, coconut cream and various spices. The sauce or chicken pieces (or both) are coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric powder, paprika powder or tomato purée, or food dye. Other tikka masala dishes replace chicken with fish, paneer and sometimes even with lamb. Here the dish was made fantastic and sorry for the "copyright violation" It was fingure lickin good". The blend of cream as told earlier was amazing and perfect and the meat chunks... really juicy.

3.The Service :- Well the service was really fast. Well groomed staff I will say polite as well. Which as always adds a @lot to your experience. They were courtious and didnot fidget a bit when something was asked about the food regarding the preparation.

Word to the management-: Thank you for a fabulous experience. Probably the best punjabi food I had since a long time. Keep going strong the way you are right now. If possible even better. Strongly recommend this place to all fellow foodies out there walk in and just get lost in all the fantastic preparations....... Ciao !!!!

This is one of the hidden gems of Kolkata, although it's popularity has now spread far and wide, and people flock here in numbers. My first visit to Punjabee Rasoi was way back in 2012, when barely a handful knew about it. It had been quite a number of years before I revisited the place, and how it had changed! They had even got a bigger place to accommodate more visitors, even though the ground floor remained the same. 

What had not changed about this restaurant was the delicious North Indian food they served. Their Kebabs will make you a regular at this place - my favourites are the Lasooni Kabab and the famous Mutton Adrak ki Punj. The latter is a speciality of this place, and why not? The soft mutton that melts in your mouth is really one of the best they have on offer.

For the main course, I mostly have had their naans. The Kabuli Naan, with its sweet taste and topped with khoya and nuts, and Garlic Naan are my top choices. For the accompaniments, it may sound a little strange coming from a strict non vegetarian, but I absolutely am in love with their Daal Makhani !! And you need to taste it to believe it! Other than that, Chicken Tikka/Reshmi Butter Masala, or their Chicken Bharta are good to go down with the various kinds of bread they have on offer.

Overall, tucked away in a corner a few lanes away from Acropolis Mall, this restaurant is a clear winner. Previously, the prices were tax inclusive, but they have started taking extra taxes now. Si the pocket punch may be on the higher side.

Absolutely good food. I loved their mutton and  kebabs which were succulent, juicy  and tender. In main course they have lots of options and one can not go wrong with quintessential chicken tikka masala. They have a naan made with dry fruit which goes perfectly well with the same. Last but not the least they only have one dessert; firni, which is definitely a must try.

We went in a group of 16 people; still the the service was prompt food delicious.  

All the starters we had was very good especially Mutton Adrak Ke Panje; you should try it once and for sure every time you would visit you would like to have one. Also Bharwan Aloo Gilafi in veg was pretty good.

We have been here couple of times and like the food overall. Even the veg Items are delicious specially dal tarka.

The best part is the standard of the food which luckily for us has not deteriorated and hope so would not in future also.

Finally after saying no all the time, I decided to try this out and to my amusement found the experience disappointing. Had visited this place with my wife. As we started ordering, found that most of the items were not available. Finally decided to go with what the staff suggested us and ended up eating tasteless food. The biriyani was extremely ordinary. The Indian breads were hard. The sides were decent.

Punjabee rasoi is one of the very few places where you can really enjoy North Indian cuisine at its finest. It is located near acropolis mall and is a really easy place to find. The ambience and the staff is both satisfactory. What blows your mind is their food. My friend and I had ordered the mutton adrak ke punje for starters and it was like a party inside my mouth. It was soft, tender, succulent and juicy with this amazing combination of spices. For the main course we ordered garlic and butter Nan and that too was just as good. The Nan was nice and soft. The palak paneer was very creamy and it just melts inside your mouth.
 The only thing that came as a shock to us was the bill. We had read on zomato that all prices were inclusive of tax however, they have started adding vat since this month. They are also accepting card payment.

A great place to go when you're a fan of Punjabi food. It's not much far from Acropolis Mall. Among their breads, Kulcha and Garlic Naan are probably the best picks. Before diving into their main courses, one must give a more patient look to their starters. Their kebabs are immensely delicious!

After having heard so much about the place, I had decided to give Punjabi Rasoi a try. It was really difficult to locate the place at first and I had to call them up for directions. Coming to the ambience, it seemed nice and soothing, but the food was nothing great. Ordered tandoori chicken and chicken reshmi butter masala. The tandoori was undercooked and the quantity of reshmi butter masala was dissapointing. Also, it's not authentic punjabi food that you would get at a Dhaba. The waiters were courteous but this place is definitely overhyped and a tad bit expensive. I had better expectations. Hope they make it better!

Went to this place for dinner.
Wonderful ambience and very courteous . The food was great. We ordered :
Kabuli naan ( was not good. It's sweet to taste and hence doesn't go at all with savory dishes )
Butter naan ( was very soft )
Dal makhani  ( best dal makhani I've tasted so far )
Chicken tikka butter masala ( okayish )
Keema mattar  ( another very tasty dish )

Over all the experience was good and would come back soon.

Are you sometimes, in kind of, at loss of words for appreciation ?
It's said that a catchy begining and a consummating ending to a story really appeal to the readers. And if you just add good contents in between, that's just imbuing all the more greatness.
Punjabee Rasaoi, is just THAT to me.
Let's get straight to dishes.
I'll write in points for a change.
• Mutton Adrak ke Panje: I'd like to call it Utopian Mutton Kebab. Packs punch with every ambrosial bite and lingers till the end. Best starter amongst all.
• Mugh Lasooni Kebab: All the marinated garlic chicken tries to hit you slow and nice.
• Fish Tikka Kebab: Fresh Bhetki has always been love. All the more with the spices and charring permeating the whole recipe.
• Bharwan Alu Gilafi : This one has just the right balance of recognition and newness. Gives the pleasure of reminiscing Kashmiri Aloo Dum yet the luxury of exploring a new variable.
• Nun and Kulcha: Didn't care much cause rest of the dishes stole the show, but of course they didn't deviate our attention to negativity, simply meaning they accompanied the side dishes neatly.
• Mutton Keema Mattar Masala: Home made yet not so. The slight amount of extra spices gives a wee bit of extravagance that we need once a while.
• Mutton Jhal Farezi: Always a pleasure to honour its welcome to taste buds. Best dish among the main course. Period.
• Chicken Resmi Butter Masala and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala: Infused with the creaminess of butter, while one was seated on the sweeter side of the palate, the other preferred the peppery seat. Needless to say about their finger licking taste.

And to sum it all up, the best dessert, Phirni.
Had to be one of the best fives I've ever had. The light yellow colour not only allures you but so does the aroma and the taste. It just makes you happy!

Epitome of satisfaction, that's what this place offers.
Okay, tell me how many times I need to re-visit again?

Located very near to the acropolis mall, kasba,,
This place has mininal decor, lighted seating area and cordial staff..
Visted around 1.30 pm ,,
Shocked to see the place empty
May be bcoz they only accept cash ( which is so short with everybody these days)
The waiters confirmed twice that they only accept cash and clarified whether we bought NEW NOTES..

Coming to the food
Chicken biriyani was unavailable.. 😭😭😭
Ordered tandoori rotis
And chicken tandoor butter masala,,
Both were properly cooked
Chicken butter masala gravy was very tasty..
Prices are inclusive of vat and service tax,, which is at par with quality and quantity

Will look forward to visit again and try more dishes with more cash in pocket,
BIG problem of the place is that they don't accept cards..
Plz ensure that you have enough cash before u enter the place,

Will visit again.

Punjabee rasoi is a restaurant located in kasba, right opposite Acropolis mall. It can occupy a large number of people as it has 2 floors but go here on a weekend and you'll have to wait quite a good amount of time before you can get a seat. 

The must try dishes here are: 
Mutton adrak ke panje - this is one of the most tender, juiciest and tastiest mutton I've had. Writing about it is making my mouth water, it's come to that stage, where we aren't shy about ordering two plates of the starter cause we know we'll finish it. 

Dal makhani - although this is a classic dish, these guys do it well enough to be mentioned as a must try

Chicken butter masala - again, a classic dish, but really well done! 

This place is a must visit for sure!

Who does not love the taste of Punjab? I surely do, but after being treated to a lot of the badly made, overly greasy, and loud variety in Mumbai, I would admit that I have developed a certain resistance towards having Punjabi food. So when a friend recommended this place very highly, I was in two minds – but one look at the Zomato page sealed the deal for me. It was quite surprising that a small place like this maintains a 4.5 rating, and this place was on my list as a must-visit this time. Well, it is easy to locate – just take the Acropolis Mall lane and take the second left. A little ahead and you see an unassuming building with Punjabee Rasoi written on it. The exterior does not give away its simple, yet very well done interiors – and the place and its staff have a warmth about them even as you settle down.

We started off with a Fresh Lime Soda, and that was well-made. The first dish to come at our table was the Mutton Adrak Ke Punje – and one look at it and you had to know that it’s divine. I don’t think I have ever had a better Mutton Kebab in my life (save Galawati) – be it the Burrahs from Delhi or Seekhs from anywhere. The melt-in-your-mouth meat off the bone, infused with a marinate of malai and ginger does things to your taste bud that border on the erotic – and finishing them is like killing yourself, slowly. I saved the last bite for the end, but each of my Kolkata trips shall be incomplete without the Adrak Ke Punje from Punjabee Rasoi – for sure.

The other kababs that we had were Chicken Lasooni Kabab and Fish Ajwain Tikka – and both were delicious. We ordered a Kabuli Naan to go with the kebabs – and the naan was kickass too – garnished with a mixture of khoya (milk solids) and nuts. The Lasooni Kebabs had a zing of garlic, and were very well done on the Tandoor – the meat not too dry and infused with the marinade till the bone. However, the second best dish of the afternoon would be the Fish Ajwain Tikka – which were unbelievably well made. The flaky and best quality Kolkata Bhetki roundels cooked delicately in the tandoor with authentic Punjabi spices and a punch of ajwain – what more do you need! The flavor was balanced and not overpowering the fish – and once again it was perfectly done. The crust gave you the spicy flavor and the soft flesh inside paid a homage to the purity of good quality fish – which is now a rarity even in Kolkata’s restaurants. 

The afternoon was made and how! Satisfied way beyond expectations, now we knew why the place had won so many awards – as displayed at the entrance. The best part of the day was their staff – who suggested the right things and made half plate kebabs available for us – as we were there only for the starters. A main course trip is on the next time I am in the city. And really – if you are in Kolkata, it is criminal to postpone your visit anymore. This place is the shizz.

Located inside the lane opposite of Acropolis mall, this restaurant is a gem. As you walk inside you will see many food awards hanging on a wall. This surely increases your expectations of the food here. The restaurant us spacious and well done up with paintings on the walls. The décor is simple and the ambience is nice. I had gone here for lunch with friends after watching a movie at Acropolis mall. The waiters were polite and took our orders after giving us ample time to decide. We ordered many dishes such as chicken rashmi kebab,chicken tikka butter masala,chicken bharta,chicken reshmi butter masala, kadhai paneer,dal makhani,butter naan,malai kofta, garlic naan and butter rotis. The food took a while to arrive on the table. I mainly had the reshmi butter masala with butter and garlic naan. Six big chicken pieces bathed in white gravy which was a little sweet and had a lot of flavours. This dish was very tasty and went very well with the naans. Special mention of the Dal Makhani must be made. It was delightful!! The food exceeded all my expectations and it was evident as I was constantly looking for extra naan or roti on the table to have some more of the chicken gravy and the Dal Makhani. The manager came up to us after we were done with the food asking us what we thought about the food. We gave him a very positive feedback 😃 To sum it up,tasty north Indian food at moderate prices which are also VAT inclusive. Kudos to Punjabee Rasoi 😃

Venue for a senior's treat is how this place was introduced to me. Located in the lane beside Acropolis mall, this food joint can give any five star restaurant a run for their money. Our big gang settled in on the first floor and were served heavenly dishes on after the other. The lahsuni kabab was awesome, followed by the scrumptious adrak ki bhaji and the superb fish tikka. Bharwan aloo gilafi was delectable too. In the main course naan and kulcha were accompanied by the gorgeous mutton keema tarka, mesmerising mutton jhaal farezi, silky chicken reshmi butter masala and scintillating chicken tikka butter masala. To finish it off we had phirni..I could have 3-4 more of that, trust me.

This place is my visit list long back and finally last week, we went for a dinner. This restaurant is running inside a 3 storied building opposite to Acropolis mall, kasba.When we went to the sy floor no one was there except the table and chairs.Then we moved to the first floor and asked them for wash room. They hinted to go up. We ordered steam rice, yellow dal,garlic naan and the famous mutton adrahkepunje.  We enjoyed our dinner as each and every dish was worth to give a penny. The signature dish was excellent. I may visit this place if I fix a plan around Acropolis mall in future.

We relished Murgh Lahsuni Kababs, Tandoori Roti, Palak Corn, Dal Tadka, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Chicken Bharta and Paneer Pulao 🍛🍲🍢👻

Every item was top-notch except the Paneer Pulao, which was just paneer bits in cardamom tempered plain rice 😌 Hoping for better pulao next time please😇😇

P.S. All this for a steal of a price tag😌

Overall very happy tummies😊😊

You don't need to be a so called food 'Blogger' to explain your sense of taste, once you experience this place you know what r u exactly upto. Truly a hidden treasure as it is located off the street. I was there with my family for my birthday dinner the order taker advised us there signature Kabuli Naan, Mutton Adrak ke Paanje and Chicken Lasuni Kebab. The kabuli naan was simply a great discovery by the chef as I never had a naan with sweet dry fruits stuck to it. Paanje was an awesome item from the tandoor, never tasted ribs so good and oh my my the lasuni drumsticks were so soft and succulent u feel like having it again and again. The garlic butter naan was another unique piece as it had garlic bits stuck to it yet the rich smell was off keeping its sweet taste live. Mutton Dopiyaza was damn good and yummilicious. Rogan Josh could be done better. Last but not the least the Firni needs a bit of improvement in taste. Overall a great dining experience worth remembering...

Not a lot needs to be said about this restaurant. It deserves the rating it has. If you love North Indian food, then this would be the place for you. "Mutton adrak ke punje" was the dish that stole the show for me. Murgh tandoori and lasuni kebabs are also "yummilicious". Infact except for dal makhni I enjoyed all the items that we ordered. The service was prompt, the staff were very polite and overall ambiance was great.
I am keeping this review short. If you have not been here yet, you are missing out on a lot. Punjabee Rasoi gets highest recommendation from me.

Just kidding. Their north indian cuisine is just marvellous. After the meal, you'd say, yes now thats punjabi food yaar.

This place is easy to locate. The ambience is pretty good & peaceful as well maybe because it lies a bit away from the main road, in a lane very near to the Acropolis mall.
Now coming to the main part, that is the food; I have been a dedicated customer since 3 years as they never compromise with the quality or quantity of the food they serve. Mutton adrak ke punje, chicken lasuni kebab, dal makhni are their signature dishes. Mutton adrak ke punje is definitely my favorite & I never fail to order it whenever i visit the place. The extremely soft n succulent mutton makes it taste out of world. 
The staffs are very helpful & courteous. The ambiance is pretty nice as well. 
 CONS: 1) They don't accept cards 😩
               2)NOTHING 😊
Would love to visit again n again.

My Ratings of 4.0 for an authentic Punjabi taste & very courteous staff & owner! 

My earlier two attempts in last 6 months went in vain as the waiting queue was too much to enter. This time, I rang up and confirmed my seat upfront! 
The restaurant is located conveniently near Acropolis Mall, Kasba. On entering the restaurant, pictures of Golden Temple, Gurunanak and most importantly a constant but pleasant chant of Wahe Guru transports you to a ' Pind' of Punjab! A very courteous staff suggested the Vegetarian specialities and we had a few mentioned below:

- Bharwan Alu Gilafi - Stuffed Tandoori Potato, very well grilled, served with mint chutney (8/10)

- Mushroom Tikka Kebab -  A marinated, stuffed & grilled mushroom, very succulent (9/10)

- Dal Makhani - As per owner, they actually slow-cook the dal on a low flame the previous day so that the Dal melts in the mouth and gives a fantastic feel. (7/10)

- Dal Tarka - This is the Dal for spicy food lovers! Go for it! (8/10)   

- Veg Kofta - Kofta in yellow gravy, comes with 3 big pieces in a plate! Highly recommended! (9/10)

- Palak corn - Spinach tossed with cream and corns, a smooth & distinct flavoured dish (7/10)

- Garlic Naan /  Lachha Paratha /Masala Kulcha - First two really crispy!

The owner Mr P. V. Raju, a very courteous person was visiting each table to inquire about the food and experience. We were halfway through when we started conversing with him. He pointed out a very innovative and meaningful thing - the restaurant serves the quantity of starters as per demand. Suppose a plate of Bharwan Alu Gilafi consists of 4 big pieces but there are only two people to order, they can order only two! Similarly, if a group of 5 wants to taste the same dish, they don't need to order two plates, instead can specifically order 5 pieces! Hardly any restaurant offers this option, which is cost effective and follows a policy of anti-wastage! Kudos! 

Cost for 4 people including soft beverages may come to around Rs 1500-1600 (around 350-400/person)

Highly recommended to foodies for the authentic taste of Punjab it offers and the superb hospitality! I will visit again with a bigger gang :)

P.S. Carry Cash as the restaurant doesn't accept cards. But then it doesn't any extra service charge and the prices in the menu are inclusive of VAT!

Nestled in one of the quiet bye-lanes of Kasba, the restaurant serves authentic Punjabi food. My family and I have been there quiet a few number of times and every time we have only ordered the various kinds of kebabs that the menu offers. To be honest, we have never really looked at the menu card. We just tell the waiters to serve us the different kababs on the menu.
Our favourite is obviously Mutton Adrak ke Panje. However we also like the Murg Lasuni kebab and the Mutton Makhmali kebab. These kebabs taste the best when paired with the Badami Naan.
The ambience of this place may not be great, but the kebabs will always keep pulling me back to this place. It is a must visit for all kebab lovers...

Didn't know it's existence until recently when I miraculously dropped on it during durga puja. However let me clear it first that it has two separate a-la-carte menus:one for durga puja and the other for normal days. I had tandoori chicken, biriyani and kadai chicken . biriyani was the best coz it didn't have the pungent or overly cooked spices' smell, neither was it too oily. They use the right combination of spices and flame and heat. However if you are willing to wait for approx an hour outside in the queue , the food is the ultimate prize

We headed to Punjabee Rasoi late on soshti night, happy to find a place for dinner. It's tucked away in the lane next to Acropolis and serves good quality north indian fare. It's a small homely place run by a Punjabi family. We ordered mutton biriyani and lasooni kebab. The kebab was melt in the mouth and sumptuous. The biriyani meat was cooked well but the taste of the rice didn't go down too well with me. Affordable and satisfying, is how the food they serve can be summed up.

It's a world full of Punjabi lipsmaking delicasies, tastes no less than authentic Punjabi food. This revamped place now has well decor with homely ambience n a fine dining experience. We had the following:
Murgh Lahsuni kebab: smoky, mouth-melting chicken legs, juicy n a burst full of spices that gives u a unique flavour when u feel the food.
Kabuli naan: naan with roasted ground nuts n sugar hazzled on top. Tender n smooth.
Butter naan: tender naan with butter on top gives a fantastic taste.
Murgh Reshmi Butter masala: smoky kebabs in smooth rich gravy of cashew paste n heavy cream. Flavorful n buttery. Perfect punjabee...

Overall, the ambience n food is excellent..! Probably one of the best Punjabi restaurant in Kolkata...

Punjabee Rasoi is serving authentic Punjabi cuisine from 2008, they won lots of food awards for their brilliance. 
■Located at the lane beside of Acropolis Mall. You have to walk for 2 mins and take the first left hand side to get this restaurant.

■They renovated recently I guess. So the place were clean and ambiance was nice. Decorate with some clay statues and paintings.

■Ordered Fresh lime soda, Palak paneer, Cheese garlic Naan and Alu Paratha. 
Palak Paneer was brilliant and comes in a good quantity. 
Alu Paratha was average. 
Chesse garlic naan was just out of the world. It was awesome and a must try on there. 

■Service is a key factor in the restaurant business and there is some room for improvement. We waited 30 mins for those simple dishes.

We went to Punjabbe  Rasoi 3 days ago. I would like to rate this restaurant not on a scale of 5 representing 5 star..rather 5 diamonds..the latest suggested way of rating hotels by hotels association of India

Hospitality by Mr Raju the owner was awesome, the personal touch  beyond expectations..just couldn't believe. Palak corn- the signature dish was simply delicious, definitely a must try. Helpings are pretty good, enough to serve a small family of 4. Service delivery quite fast. though you have to wait for your turn but worth it.  Palak corn a must try...Mr Raju suggested this dish, though we didn't order as we had already ordered other 3-4 items, he made it sure we try this..AT HIS COST....yes he offered free tasting of the dish for all 4 of us..jaw dropping experience.

Went there on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. The place was full as there was only 1 floor with not much tables. Moreover 2-3 families were waiting before us to get in. So we had to wait for quite some time...around 30mins or so before we could be seated. One good news is that they are opening their ground floor tomorrow, just before the Pujas, so people will not have to wait for seats like now.

Coming to the food....the best North Indian food I have ever had! We ordered

#Chicken Lasuni Kabab - it was juicy and tasty leg pieces
#Malai Kulcha - it was average without much fillings
#Chicken butter masala - this was on the better side, tasted good with the kulcha
#Kabuli Naan - Superb! Badaam pieces all over it, tastes a bit sweet but wonderful, comes in 6 pieces
#Mattar Methi Malai - This was the show-stealer! Never thought a veg dish could be this good! Must try! Tasted heavenly with Kabuli Naan.

The service was slow, but it could be overlooked as the restaurant was full.
Food quality was awesome!

I loved their dahi!! I think they serve the best punjabi food in Kol. Price is not dhaba-like. You have to spend a bit more money than punjabi dhabas but it worths every penny!!  Aloo paratha, kulcha, paneer, chicken everything was top-level !! Only problem We got was to locate the restaurant!! Another problem was, they were not accepting cards. Hope that will be resolved soon.

Visited this place for a friend's birthday treat and thoroughly enjoyed the food..
1. Chicken lasooni kebab: this one was the best out of all that we had. A true foodgasm!
2. Mutton Adrak-e kebab: was good too, but definitely not for the people who can't handle the typical smell of mutton.
3. Garlic naan : too good!
4. Tandoori roti : fine
5. Dal makhani : good as always!
6. Chicken tikka butter masala : quite good
7. Masala thumbs-up : fair, didn't like the taste of asafoetida (hing) in it.
The only drawback that we faced was the hour-long wait at the stairs on a rainy-sweaty afternoon. We nearly waited for 1 & half hour to get a table for 4! 
And the service was quite slow as well!

One of the best places for Punjabi cuisine in Kolkata.
Winner of 'Times food award' for four consecutive times.
Location: Bye lane behind acropolis mall. A bit difficult to locate. Situated in a residential area.

Ambience and Interior: Nothing special. Comfortable. 
Food:  MUTTON ADRAK KI PANJE- one of the best Mutton dishes I ever had. Three pieces of Mutton, mainly the rib pieces, cooked in such way that they are soft and juicy. You can use it as a side dish for Biriyani or roti/nun. This one is a must order here.
DAL MAKHANI: It's also superb.
BIRIYANI: Not that great but OK.
Price: on the higher side.
Will visit again particularly for Mutton adrak ki panje.

First of all its not so easy to find as it is not situated in any commercial market or on any popular roads. It is located in a residential area where its hard to guess. I reached there by doing a lot of research on zomato. On the entrance only you will see the collection of awards and it will feel like as if you are visiting any art gallery. The food was awesome and as a non veg lover I would like to suggest to definitely visit this place..and their "mutton adrak ke punje" are mouth watering and must ordering..it's a hidden gem..one may find it a bit costly but the quality of food doesn't make you feel that.

Hidden gem located on the second bylane - left to Acropolis Mall. Meat lovers will go krazy if you taste the kebabs - i would say the best in Kolkata. Visited at least 10 times to this eatery with friends and relatives... The staffs and the owner are courteous with a prompt service. Mouth melting mutton kebabs are the best to try out...
Only shortcoming about this eater, they accept only cash...

Not much space in the dining area but nontheless the food is very good. The mutton adrak ke panje is a very unique dish and must have. The dal makhani is one of the better dals i have had among the restaurants in Kolkata. Ordered corn palak on being suggested by the server, but the dish was made too sweet which I personally did not like much.

The servers are very courteous and one may need not wait for long to get the food served. Overall, a good experience and look forward to visit again.

Despite the awesome overall rating, I did not like this eatery. 
First things first, it is located in a lane opposite to acropolis mall and is kind of hard to identify. It is usually very busy because of it's reasonable/low pricing. The food served is just adequate and just commensurate with the pricing.

Service is slow. The staff doesn't even offer to serve the food proactively. 

And then the biggest downside (Which is a deal-breaker for me), this outlet doesn't accept card payments. So, after a wholesome meal with my family i had to run out to the ATM , fetch money and pay the bill.

I will probably never visit the place because of this shortcoming. So, in case you are okay with it do visit it for the adequate-okayish food and pricing. The service, however, can be improved.

We decided to visit this place after hearing warm reviews from a friend. Locating the restaurant may be tricky for the first timers. If you are coming from Gariahat towards Ruby Hospital take left turn at Acropolis Mall crossing and then again take left turn at the  second bylane to reach this joint . There is a big water tank beside this place which can be used to locate the place . The ground floor is their takeaway joint while the restaurant is at the first floor . It is not a big place but neat & clean . We tried the following items : 
Fresh lime soda : We thought about ordering Masala Drink but they explained that it is basically cold drinks peppered with some masalas , so we tried lime soda which was usual type .
Mutton adrak ke punje : They said this is their signature dish & it is really beautiful. It is basically a kabab item with three big pieces of mutton cooked to perfection & served with associated salads . The mutton was coming off from the bones without any effort & the best part of the dish was that you can savour the mutton bones as they were soft & juicy , simply mind blowing.
Mutton Biriyani special : The special biriyani consists of two mutton pieces instead of one as in the normal biriyani. The quantity is quite large & sufficient.It was  not very rich yet tasty .
Butter Nun : Usual type , satisfactory.
Mutton Roganjosh : Roganjosh is not a Punjabi dish but a Kashmiri one . I was a bit sceptical about ordering it but went ahead. The dish was tasty with four mutton pieces in it yet I must say it is not the type I had fallen in love with while visiting Kashmir.  But with butter nun the dish tasted good nevertheless. 
                        The prices at menu card are inclusive of taxes which is a plus considering you do not have to bother about service charge etc . I was a bit disappointed with their service as they simply left the dishes at the table & did not bother to serve it in our plates . 
            Overall a nice experience with tasty food which erased my disappointment regarding services.

Was out on a bike trip along em bypass to pacify my soul with my soul mate and had no plans to go there. Suddenly my husband asks me to have biriyani and i refused (for the first time in my life). Then I started to think 'what can we eat or what can he eat'. Bypass has so many options nowadays but I took no time to decide Punjabee Rasoi. Before a year I missed the chance of going there as I couldn't locate the exact place. Today I could.
This is a treasure of new age. The place is good for family and friends along with the food they serve. Loved the interior. The best part is the hygiene. Not a point of dust can be found there.
Now to the food. We ordered #muttonadrakkepanje and #nuttynun. Adrak ke panje is the best preparation of mutton in the town. Never ever I had this succulent taste of mutton here. Will go there again to taste their other varieties to mark the points up for sure.

For the second time in a fortnight ordered from this place. At the very onset, I can't comment about the first-hand in person experience. Though a takeaway is also no less an experience.

Usually, the guys are strict when it comes to minimum order, however, on hearing that am ordering for myself only, they put a relaxation on the limit. This is usually unheard of unless you are a regular, which I am not. This should mean a lot to any customer! The guy on the phone was really friendly and eager to help.

This time I had gone for a mutton adrak ki punje which was an absolute delight what with its patient marination in yogurt and other spices. The end product is a plethora of taste though it falls short of the competition by its other cousin from the same outlet - mutton makhmali kebabs. Both stand out in their own rights. The former is a little bland when compared to the latter. Both are soft and succulent and the meat literally melts in your mouth as soon as your incisors sink into the meat. 
The egg masala is a typical dhaba menu with rich oily sinfully tasty gravy.
The only thing which according to me is below par is their mutton keema.

A must visit for all dhaba lovers...

I went there with a friend and we took Mutton ki Adrak Punje and Mutton Biriyani. Quantity wise it looked never ending for food hoggers like us and taste wise , well whatever I say is less. A must recommendation to all seeking authentic Punjabi and Mughlai dish. Cost wise well it wont pinch your pocket as the saying goes.

This is one of the busiest punjabi joint off Acropolis mall. Not a very easy place to find out. With its growing popularity they are now expanding from first floor to second floor. We ordered Muthoot malai kebab, succulent chicken kebabs in rich malai. Very well made. For main, we ordered chicken bharta mutton jhalfarezi yellow dal fry rice veg jhalfarezi and roti. The bharta was good. The mutton was cooked perfectly and the dish tasted super. Not too spicy. 

Veg jhalfarezi was also delicious. The hero of the day was the daal fry. Wonderfully cooked and tasted great with the rice. 

Ordered firni for dessert and it met expectations. The only concern is lack of fish items.

This is one busy place, with the crowd bustling about and the smell of kebabs creating an atmosphere of utter bliss for foodies. The mutton adraki panja is delicious, the chicken lahsuni kebab smooth and succulent. The kabuli naan is slightly sweet, rich and decadent with the generous coating of nuts on it. The chicken bharta is a classic, as is the chicken tikka masala. The mutton keema matar is a pleasure to the tastebuds. Go there for swift, professional dining experience, with homely, tasty Punjabi food. It'll leave you full and satisfied to the brim, without blowing a huge whole in your pocket.

I have called for a home delivery.The person who had received the call told me at first to place a large order.  I stay 3 kms away from the restaurant and had placed a order of over 1000 INR. When he heard the order he refused and said they only accept party order. This is very unprofessional  where it clearly states on Zomato it offers home delivery . Either the information published here is incorrect or the restaurant does not practice as it preaches.

I regret forgetting to carry my phone to this place, so no pictures. Let me tell you, the food is stellar. Their signature dish is Adrak ke Panje and the long marinated mutton just melts in your mouth with a beautiful essence.
We had a special naan (whose name I'm forgetting) with sweetened nuts and although I hated it (because I hate nuts), it was apparently the best you could ask for (friends said).
We also had a tangri kebab with a hearty amount of onion rings and lemon wedges along with the paste they give with tandoori chicken.
The place looked neat and clean and it was cold, though the room was occupied and hence, not so quiet. The service time is good and the staff is polite. Would surely come here again.

Biriyani though is good is not up to the mark.Its really a must go venture for punjabi cuisine lovers.Staff needs to be trained a.little bit..had to keep on telling them to fill up water glasses all the time (I'm a voracious water drinker during my meals)

Being on the top of my wishlist, I gave this place a visit when I was in Acropolis with a friend. This is located on the first left crossing on the lane next to Acropolis. The ambience is decent. Since my friend had been to this place before, our order was pre-decided in accordance with her suggestion. We had lasuni kabab for starters followed by tandoori roti ( maybe something else which i can't recall at this moment ) and mutton keema. The service was quite fast, considering the fact that only three tables were occupied including ours. 
 
The lasuni kabab was amazing ! There was a strong aroma of ginger in the soft chicken kababs. A full plate contained four pieces, which were large enough! The next pair of dishes were a superb combo. The roti was perfect and the mutton keema was simply windblowing! This wasn't much oily, like the other Mughlai restaurants, yet the taste was amazing, the courtesy of which goes to the chef for his amazing mix of spices. The delicious minced mutton was a treat to the taste buds! Would be visiting this place very soon and would try a lot of dishes :D

I recently visited this place with my family. The ambience really good and it gives a good vibe instantly but that's just secondary what matters is the food. And this place has quite frankly the most delicious foods. They have kept the menu short and simple. I ordered their speciality Murg Lahsuni Tikka and Fish Achari Tikka for starters. Both of them were amazing, the taste was really good, not too spicy and not too oily, just perfect! For main course I ordered Methi Malai Mattar and Garlic naan and to be honest I have never had Methi Malai Mattar this good ever!! It was so delicious I can't even express. All in all it was a great place to have lunch at. 100% must visit.

This is a hidden gem in the true sense of the word. Literally located away from plain sight, Punjabi Rasoi can be found across Acropolis mall, in an alley behind the main road beside the mall. They have dine-in facilities on the first floor. Also, it's a cash-only establishment (no cards are accepted as on date). However, none of this matter once you get your hands full with the out-of-the-world kebabs available at your disposal.  

We were there for the legendary Mutton Adrak ke Punje - and that's what we ordered  - along with Chicken Lehsuni Kebab and Chicken Tandoori. Our only mistake was to have taken the food as a takeaway. As soon as we ordered, the owner suggested that we should actually have dined-in so that we could have enjoyed the food better. We realized how true his words were when we reached home and could literally feel how good it would have been straight out of the tandoor. 

Truth be told, Mutton Adrak ke Panje (albeit a bit costly at 340/- for 3 pieces) is unlike any other delicacy we have had so far. It's unique, it's flavorful and it's unforgettable. Tender chunks of most delicious mutton cling lightly from the ribs - and it's an experience in itself to have such a wonderful dish along with some Port Wine. Chicken Lehsuni Kebab is another item we enjoyed to the fullest. Chicken Tandoori was also up to the mark but at the end of the day, everything got overshadowed by the Mutton kebab. 

Punjabi Rasoi has made its mark in our hearts for its kebabs and we will definitely be back for more!

I visited this place after reading some great reviews on Zomato but I must say I found it hyped! The Veg Menu though plenty in numbers, is not so good to eat. It seems like the gravy is the same, whether you are having the aloo dum or the mushroom masala. The breads were decent but the veggies were as I said, not upto the mark. Also, the famous “Mutton Adrak ke Punje” gives u only 3 pieces at 340 + taxes & the pieces ain’t that big, so I would give another low on the price to quantity ratio there. Though this is considered one of best places in the Kasba Bosepukur Area (most probably due to the lack of any other good place), it still is quite some distance from being considered as one of the preferred places in the city.

Rasoi rocks...👌✌
If you love kebabs you are going to fall in love with the kebabs they serve... the lasuni kebab is the best kebab I've ever had till date... besides, we had ordered butter roti, lachha paratha and kadai paneer and each and every item was sooo sooo delicious... Though the ambience they say is homely but I found it little bit clumsy and robustous as when we had visited the restaurant, it was almost full... the staffs are welcoming... overall, this is the best place to have kebabs to your heart content....

Murg lasuni kabab is one of the most unique kababs I've ever tried. And it tastes superb. This restaurant provides a homely atmosphere with very co-operative staffs. And above all the food is yummilicious!! Worth trying.

#Location: By lane of Kasba,Acropolis Area.

#Service: Okish, I picked up food so i found it to be fine.

#Food: Tried their Murgh Lasauni Kabab and Tandoori Chicken. Both of these are famous dishes from Punjabi Rasoi and they lived up to their 'talk of the town' charisma. The portions were good and kababs throughly juicy.

Visited Punjabee Rasoi yesterday after hearing a lot of rave reviews about the place from my friends.
Well, for starters, the ambience isn't really something to vouch for, but that is hardly an issue. The food served here is the closest to authentic North Indian and Punjabi fare one can get in this part of India.
We ordered Sweet Fresh Lime Sodas which were nicely made.
For starters, we ordered Mutton Adrak Ke Panje and Chicken Lasooni Kabab, both speciality items of the restaurant which were recommended by the server. The mutton was superbly tender, mildly spiced and just falling off the bone. This is a must try. I am not overly fond of mutton, but I totally loved this dish.
The chicken lasooni kabab was also extremely soft and well marinated, but I was slightly disappointed maybe because the Mutton was amazing and had pitched my expectations higher. 
For the main course, we ordered Tandoori Rotis and Chicken Bharta. Again, the rotis were soft and well baked, unlike the rubbery ones served at most eateries nowadays and the Chicken Bharta reminded me of the one I had in Amritsar. Full points for retaining the authentic taste. Tender shreds of chicken, in a mildly spiced gravy, with just the right amount of oil and served with half a boiled egg was just out of the world. Definitely a great side dish, which was perfectly balanced in taste.
Will definitely come back again.

Ever since i read Punjabee Rasoi winning awards in consecutive years for best north indian food, i was desiring to go . and what a better day than a monsoon day to enjoy tarka -roti!!
finding this place is little tricky as it is not on the main road ( it is near acropolis mall). 
the restaurant is very well decorated. sublime and elegant i can say.
we ordered only main course as we were past by lunch time hour and hunger pangs had taken a front seat.  our meal comprised of dal tarka (which could have been better and was certainly not the dhaba types as suggested by the waiter), paneer butter masala ( prepared well) and veg kofta ( a recommended dish by them and certainly well cooked). in indian breads  - kabuli naan, garlic naan and roti were ordered and was good. kabuli naan is usually sweet, which was not the case here.
cost of 2 adult and a child was around 900. portions are good. and yes, the menu price includes taxes.

The place is a little smaller than what I expected but the food was just great. Service was a bit slow. Starters and main course was yummy and Garlic naan is a must try over here. However tandoori roti, plain dal and egg curry weren't up to the mark. Would have given 4 points if I didn't have to run to withdraw cash as they don't accept cards. But would surely recommend to others.

I've been visiting this place since late 2013, when it had just opened and this place has proven to be hands down the best place to visit for anyone who craves for quality north Indian/ mughlai food. While earlier the seating area was limited to a single floor, it has since then expanded its seating capacity in tune with its popularity. The mutton adrak ke pajne, murgh lasuni kebab and the murgh khusnawa kebab are to die for. The butter chicken and especially the dal makhani are also distinctly better than any other restaurant. I am yet to be disappointed by this place.

Had been there with office colleague for a weekday lunch. It is just opposite Acropolis mall. Our order was...Chk Bharta, Dal Makhani, Chk Tikka Butter Masala, Kosha Mangsho, Roti, Butter Naan and Pudina Paratha.. The food tastes... will not say average.... but could have been better... Also the prices are high compared to the ambiance of the restaurant and restaurant upholstery. They only take cash....Do not accept cards...Please carry big cash if you are dining with 5 or more. But the service is good.

Not very impressed with their signature kebabs. Had Murgh Lasuni Kebab and Mutton Adrak ke Punje. Both tasted a bit bland. Plus i do not like so much bone in my kebabs. Going by the hype, probably went on an off-day in the kitchen. Kabuli Naan and Dal Makhani were good. Somewhat managed to quench the disappointment.

We ordered lehsun e murg, Butter chicken tikka masala and kabuli naan.
Lehsun e murg was amazing. The staff informed us that it'll take half an hour. That was quite appreciated.
Kabuli naan was sweet and nutty. I didn't like it at all.
The tikka masala was creamy and good.
Overall a nice experience. If you're in Acropolis, this is a must visit.

Must say we were really delighted by the food , courteous staff and warm decor. True blue punjabi food we were served starting from mutton kebab, chicken lastuni kabab, fish kebab ..malai nan, chicken tandoor butter masala ,palak corn and firni!! The firni here is the best i have had in a long time..the kesar flavour was deep. Hearty delicious meal ...a must visit!

After listening a lot about this restaurant decided to go there with my girlfriend. This restaurant is totally dependent on Acropolis Mall for the location. Now get to the review :
Order : We were pretty filled up so could not taste a lot dishes. 1 X Adrak ke Panje , 1 X Kabuli Naan
Price : After a first lookout at the menu i though this is surely not  a reasonable restaurant but then i notice all the prices are included VAT + Service Tax. That's where its enters the "Just past the reasonable" category.
Don't liked : 1) The location is odd. If the Acropolis Mall and GPS was not there its hard to find. 2) They don't accept cards for payment. That's a big deal for me as i prefer paying with cards over cash. 3) They don't have washroom on both floors. This is not acceptable. If you are at the 1st floor and need to avail washroom, then you have to come down to ground floor dining area to avail it.
Liked : 1) Service was pretty good and all the staffs (the ones we encountered with :-) ) were well mannered and helpful. 2) Now the food - Adrak ke panje lived up to the hype. It was soo good in taste and soft to eat. Kabuli Naan was the show stealer. Thanks to the uncle who suggested it to us. I have never tasted such a good naan in my life. I can come to this place again just for this one. Its that's good. I don't know the exact preparation but i think there were corns,daal and nuts spread on the naan to give its taste.
That's it for the day. I really want to come here again to taste their other dishes. Thank you.

Butter chicken, mutton keema, and lasuni murg are also definitely worth trying out. It's usually very lively even on weekdays but even on busy days I've always enjoyed prompt service. All this at such an affordable price. Full points.

Oh my god! I've been to this place a few times and this is such a gem! This has been there for a while now, previously we would have issues giving directions to friends however now it's easy. It's located very close Acropolis mall. I could just survive on the kababs they serve. It is so so sooo good. The Chicken Lasuni kabab, mutton adrak je panje, fish kabab taste beyond words. I love the keema Naan, dal makhni, chicken kakori ( I hope I got the name right) and the mutton dishes. The place doesn't look fancy and is just like any other average air conditioned restaurant but honestly who cares when the food is THAT good. 😍 The staff is helpful and very well informed about the menu. The service is prompt and satisfactory. Price wise this place is beyond reasonable. I love the food here. Must visit.

We had our dinner delivered from Punjabee Rasoi, and instead of beating around the bush, I'll cut straight to the chase - that the food is finger locking stuff! The tandoor rotis remained soft even after about an hour of delivery. The tarka was heaven inside the mouth. And the mutton adrak k punje was heaven. The meat was falling off the bones. The smokey flavour was just perfect. Everything in perfect harmony, just like it probably is in paradise. The only thing weird was that there were 3 pieces in the mutton dish - restaurants usually offer a single large piece, or multiples of two. Anyway, I'm already looking through the menu to see what I'll have next from this place.

Followed fellow Zomatians advice and had an excellent lunch for two with only one Kabuli Naan & one plate of the famed Adrak ke Panje. Both were superlative! The Maitre'd graciously changed the 3 piece Mutton plate and added a 4th piece to even the distribution to 2 pieces each for the 2 of us at a proportionate cost. I swear I have never ever tasted (in all of my 59 years) such succulent grilled mutton! The Kabuli Nan was also huge & exotic with nuts & a few strategic crystals of sugar. We were fully stuffed by the time we finished this simple meal. All this at a ridiculously low price of Rs. 600/- for both the above items.
The Wahe Guru chants at the ground floor is the enchanting ambience which I'll try the next time!
Navigation: opposite Acropolis shopping mall at Kasba - cross Cheeni Kum cafe, turn left, turn right & you are suddenly there.

Mutton Adrak is one of the signature dish here and it is to die for. All preparations are finely done. Food is too tasty.
The only disadvantage is , they have less sitting arrangrmt compare to demand. If u go on weekends, you need to wait for 15-20 mins and there is no waiting area. 
Other than these no issue at all.

I am deeply saddened that I do not have good or for that matter any pics to post for the Punjabee Rasoi.  If you are craving some delicious kebabs, this is the place you need to order from or drop in right away. 

If you are as big a Mutton craver as I am, it is a must for you to try the Mutton Makhmali Kebab. Other kebabs that are as delectable as the one mentioned above are the Chicken Tandoori, reshmi, malai and lasuni kebab. 

Punjabee Rasoi is the hog den for North Indian food lovers.  Right from the starters to the mains, everything is down right delectable.

I have been hearing about this place for long time, specially the dishes they have created, each dish its own unique flavor. Mutton adrak ka punja, one of the most famous dish which almost every orders for it and once u have this u will remember the taste for ever,then lasunni tikka, ajwani fish, dal tarka, if see this you will wander which one to start will, all this are very typical dish yet not boring. one more thing i will add on is the behavior of the owner, he was personally going to each table and taking feed back from the guest, suggest the best in the house dishes.

This place is located just beside Acropolis mall, take the lane beside the mall, walk for a minor two and you're there. It's not a very hard place to find if you know where to get off, but there is a high chance to overlook it if you have no idea where it is.
Now coming on to the food and ambience. 
The ambience is pretty normal, nothing extraordinary, pretty moderate to average. 
Now coming on to the food, this is where it makes the difference. The food is lip smacking given which items you order. The mutton Tandoori is just fabulous. One if my recommendation will be the Aloo Parantha. It's one if the best Aloo Parantha I've had. Biryani is okayish, nothing extraordinary. Overall satisfied.

One of the best punjabi khana I've had. This place is truely a hidden gem. Its near Acropolis mall, and you might want to use Google Maps the first time you go there. I don't know whether to call it a restaurant or not- its a 2-story corner place HOUSE, and the seating area is on the ground floor. This place can seat very limited number of people, so you might want to 'kind of' reserve your seats.
That being said, this place is not all that shabby from inside, it does have decent air conditioning. Coming to the most important part, the food is very very good, both veg and non veg. All the preparations have a rich punjabi taste and aroma. Quite affordable. Do visit this place.
Do try: keema naan, cheese butter kulcha, butter chicken.

Truly a hidden gem. Visited this place today and it was a wow experience! Murgh lahsuni kabab was mind blowing. Besides, murgh tikka kabab, veg kofta curry, chicken kadhai and firni were very palatable. I would recommend this place to everyone. Shall visit once again soon. Kudos to the owners.

Adrak ke Punje - They serve one of the best mutton Starter here. It is so soft and juicy. It got melted with my first bite. Another main attraction over here is Kabli Naan. It is so soft and it is best tasted with Palak corn..

A great place... Mostly operates as a take- away ......
At the counter, sits the proprietor himself.. With chants of "waihe guru" playing in the background.......
Mutton adrak k punjee, lasunee kebabs, chicken tikka masala are its signature items..... Food's relatively cheap than other restros...

A must visit place for cheap punjabee crusine........

Food: 8.5/10
Value for money: 8/10
Ambience: 6.5/10

Adrak ke Punje - I must mention this first. This is their signature item. Every time I took it I got same delicious taste of it. If you like mutton then definitely you should try it.

Other foods are also descend. Specially Butter NAN and Masala NAN.

Biriyani is also good.

Situated very near to Acropolis Mall..not easily visible as situated inside a lane..it seems a flat has been converted to a restaurant 

Talking about food..loved the food...me being a vegetarian you wont find more options of veg food..more options of non-veg items is available 

Overall decent place to visit and its quite reasonable too

This is the place if you want to have proper punjabee food. 

FOOD- We have ordered fresh lime soda, dal makhani, tandoori roti and lasuni kebab. 
Fresh lime soda is nice. Lasuni kebab is love. Mouthwatering pieces of meat with sauce from the punjabee kichen will melt in your mouth. Dal makhani was served in a small bucket like utensil. It tastes so good.  

AMBIENCE- The ambience is very nice. The service is good. 

But the disadvantage is being such a well known restaurant they still do not accept any types of cards. You need to pay in cash. :(

Mutton Adrak ke Punje is the first the thing that comes to my mind whenever i think of this place. I visited this place a couple of years back along with 14 other friends of mine. This dish practically blew us all away. The experience was inexplicable. We also had Cheese Garlic nun, mutton rogan josh ,chicken do piazza, raita and fresh lime soda. The place is small and a bit difficult to locate the 1st time. The prices are a bit on the higher side but then again i would say this is an experience of a lifetime for very mutton lover out there. I'll be visiting this place very soon.

Today we ordered food from punjabi rasoi and we finally have a good food station for biriyani and north indian foods in our locality(kasba).Their order taker maintained decorum over phone.They delivered their food in neat and clean way , the every customer would like to have their food. I hope they will maintain this discipline.
              We ordered lasuni kabab, mutton Hyderabadi biriyani and chicken Hyderabadi biriyani.The chicken of the kabab was so good and so we'll cooked and i glad that they are maintaining good quality.biriyani is something everyone should order from this place cause this is unique and will surprise your taste bud and i think the secret is in their elements like they used ghee and that is how it supposed to be.
      Do not compromise with your food quality , just try to hold this position and i will visit this place for sure.

Get down at Acropolis. Enter the road beside the mall, take the first left( after crossing the cheeni kum cafe), then turn right and head straight. You'll find this restro.

I have eaten here a lot of times. Over the years I've seen this place grow and emerge into a truly awesome eatery. Earlier there was no first floor, only the ground floor was there. Its basically a house converted into a restro with small rooms and nice decor. The first floor has a restaurant like feel and vibe to it.

Food is lip smacking. Delish I must say. Over the years, the prices have soar higher than I would've ever hoped. Like now, when I and two of my brothers go there to eat, 600 -700 bucks of our entire bill is due to plain naans. 
I love their kebabs, dal makhani and other salans. All of their dishes are really spicy and rich in flavours and they provide a lot of thick gravy with their salans. And the green chutney they serve with their kebabs, o my! I never leave a single bit of that chutney. Pocket pinch is definitely on the higher side. But it is worth it. Great food and great quality. Recommended!

Chicken Malai Kebab, Mutton Adrak ke Panje for starters. For main course, kabuli naan, malai kulcha, masala kulcha, chicken reshmi butter masala, and chicken bharta.
Mutton adrak ke panje was delicate and melt-in-the-mouth delicious. It was probably the first time that I found mutton at a restaurant so soft and succulent. The chicken malai kebab was beautifully done too. A must try is the kabuli naan, which is richly covered with roasted nuts. Malai kulcha is filled with khoya kheer, and is good for anyone who has a sweet tooth even in main course! The other items were equally good. Good family ambience. Reasonable prices.

It's located near the Acropolis mall-the 2nd left lane to the road that leads to the Acropolis car parking.ambience wise it has nothing great!it's basically 2 storeyed where the ground floor has a hand wash area and a kitchen that prepares take aways and the first floor which has a kitchen too(which is for dine in)!so service is fast!the wall connecting the 2storeys has all the certificates and rewards framed they have earned!we ordered chicken reshmi kebab,chicken tikka kebab and chicken lasooni kebab for starters.all the three were amazing!the tikka kebab consists 6 chicken pieces and was full of flavours ,the lasooni kebab consists of 4 chicken leg pieces.the reshmi kebab (6pieces)was the best!really soft and smooth like resham! Unfortunately they couldn't serve fish kebab so we couldn't try it there.for main course we ordered hyderabadi chicken biryani which was okayish ,chicken tandoori butter masala which was amazing-tandoori chicken pieces in buttery smooth creamy gravy.aloo ke paranthe which was okay again(I have tasted better aloo ke paranthe else where),veg kofta which was really great and butter naan.the aloo ke paranthe were a disappointment as North Indian restaurants are supposed to serve the best paranthas!another reason why i gave them a 3.5 on 5 is because the staff isnt very efficient-there was a kitty party group where the ladies were practically howling making it impossible for us to sit-in spite of our complaints the staff coudnt help-it was only when the manager caught us walking out -the noise was lessened.Also the food wasn't served-it was just brought and kept at the centre of the table-it was only on our asking that the waiters helped us serve.overall neglecting everything else this place serves amazing food-perhaps one of the best North Indian food serving joints! their kebabs,fresh lime soda(I haven't tasted a better lime soda else where-trust me!!) And the veg kofta are a must try!will surely visit this place again.

Visited the place twice.. To be honest I would have to say I didn't like this place at the first time.. But it was my friend who requested me to try this place once more and this time Punjabee Rasoi has won me over. It's a cozy and homely restaurant near Rajdanga, Kasba. I never heard a prayer song playing at the entrance of a restaurant before. It felt good. Coming to the food, Chicken Lasooni Kabab was absolutely mouth watering.. I fell in love with their Kabuli Nun and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. The only shortfall of this lovely place is that they don't accept cards. Overall a nice place to plan a gathering. You will definitely leave with a smile.

It was same as butter nun only difference with the shape. So if they try to prepare the authentic lacha partha that would be super good for them

We were a group of four people and went there to try their signature dish "Mutton Adrak ke Punje". We did also order another item named " Mutton Makhmali Kebab". Both the items were mouthwatering, lip smacking, hot and spicy. Two of the best mutton kebabs we've ever had. Mutton makhmali was heavenly in taste. I've never had such soft, juicy, boneless mutton kebab before. They took a little longer time to serve it but it was worth the wait. Definitely visit this place again!

One common thing that connects most good restaurants in Kolkata is the level of patience required to locate the place and this was no exception.Adrak ke Punje is probably their best dish.Its amazing how they manage to cook the mutton so perfectly,every single time!
Add to that the Lasuni Kebab and Dal Makhani.

Today I went there with a group of friends. I did not have any idea of its existence before, and to tell you the truth, I like North Indian dish but don't prefer it. But I must say that I enjoyed every moment of it.
It is not far from Acropolis. Ample car parking space. A bit cramped sitting space but no problem if you are among friends. Comfortable sofas and lovely red colour.
We started with mushroom masala. It was delicious. Then we tasted paneer tikka. Outstanding. Then came tengry kabab. Soft and juicy.
The best of the lot. Kabuli nan. And adrak mutton panjre. Out of this world. Soft and juicy mutton pieces. Delicious and tasty kabuli nan. I have made up my mind to bring some for home next time.
Staff very courteous and helpful and very active. The only problem is lack of space.

If good North Indian food is all that you care for.. Then go for it. Outstanding food. Good ambience. Extremely courteous manager. All in all a great place for tandoor lovers. The dal makhani needs special mention and the murg tandoori is mouth watering.. Just a little difficult to locate and the service could be better but it is no doubt one of the best restaurants serving authentic North Indian food in Kolkata

Another one ticked off from my bookmark list.This one courtesy a weekday-night order-in at a friend's place.This place is like a David among the seasoned Goliaths famous for their north-Indian/mughlai fare.Things that I ordered:

Mutton-adhrak-ke-punje:The house speciality didn't disappoint.I pine for red meat like most girls do for chocolate and cheese.While 3 pieces per plate seemed stingy at first,they were wholesome,tender,flavour-packed and a MUST-TRY.

Chicken reshmi butter masala & butter naans:I usually don't like white gravies because they are too sweet for my pallete but this one was rich,creamy,tasty and went fabulously with the well-made butter naans.

Mutton biryani:I'm not the kind of person who butchers the essence of biryani.Bottomline is I love any biryani that's decently made and above.This one was way better than just decent and the quantity was nice too.

The prices are pocket friendly considering the quality,quantity and "nothing-like-you've-ever-had-before" feel to every dish.

Came to know about the place after reading an article in The Telegraph where many celebrities praised their dishes a lot. Then read the zomato reviews and went with a lot of expectations. Must say thoroughly pleased with the experience. If it is only food that matters to you, don't think twice and head towards Punjabee Rasoi now! The Mutton Adrak ke Paanje is sublime - so is their Egg Tarka and Chicken Lasooni Kebab. Would have given a rating of 5 if the place had a bar and the ambience was a little better.

I spent 9 years of my life at a school in Kasba, of which, the last 2 were spent while Punjabee Rasoi was in business. Not once did I set foot in there. I look back and I realize how stupid I was to ignore a restaurant of such premier class.

Punjabee Rasoi does everything correctly -- from food to service, from cutlery to crockery. It is a rather simple restaurant, minimalistic decor and standard yet comfortable tables and chairs. Their service brings them to a different level. Fast, efficient, friendly -- the cornerstone to every restaurant's success. Punjabee Rasoi isn't the easiest to locate at night because they don't have a large, flashy billboard which lights up when the sun goes down. What they do have is excellent food.

As the name suggests, this restaurant is primarily a Punjabee restaurant. From their naan to their dal to their kebabs, everything hits the spot -- and hits it well. Their naan was absolutely gorgeous, whereas their kebabs are reminiscent of the kind Zaranj served up in the past. I was told to not order the biryani, because apparently that wasn't a very good idea. But I went ahead and did it anyway, which I do not regret because it probably still was better than most other well reputed Biryani joints. They even managed to make their Fresh Lime Soda/Water standout! However, the star of the show was always going to be the Dal Makhani and the Saag. I usually pride myself on being a staunch non vegetarian, but this was the first time a vegetarian dish managed to grab the limelight. Absolutely fantastic!

Punjabee Rasoi amazes and refreshes -- a rarity in today's culinary scene. From the minute our car pulled up next to the place till we were safely back inside again, Punjabee Rasoi threw immaculate service at us. They even have a valet.

Fantastic food. Excellent service.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Punjabee Rasoi has become one of the default places I suggest to people now. The food is excellent, and the staff are polite as well. The only 2 issues with the place are regarding the location (first timers may have to look around, but that shouldn't be a problem anymore with Acropolis Mall opening up opposite to this place). Secondly, if you want to come during dinner time, do call in advance. 
Must try the Aloo and mushroom starters, and Kabuli Nan along with babycorn mushrooms dish and the Dal.

To be honest all of their kebab items are very good......   Biriyani went a little dicy with one parcel tasting good and the other one just okay okay - not sure how that happened - which leads me to doubt they sent me an older stock to clean up their fridge...

My second visit to this place was for a lunch. Only the dining space on the ground floor was open for lunch. The enclosed area was quite stuffy when we reached there. Even though the three of us were the only customers, the service seemed quite slow and the waiters quite uninterested. We ordered the highly recommended stuffed potatoes gor starters and that turned out to be quite disappointing, half cooked and barely stuffed. The paneer jhalfrezi main course was way too oily. The vegetable koftas just about okay. The naans/ kulchas were good however. What disappointed me the most was that the staff was least bothered with any complains brought to them.  For the pricing this place is hardly a value for money. Don't expect any vinegar soaked onions or for that matter missi rotis that one looks forward to when visiting a punjabi restaurant. All in all a bit of a disappointment for the vegetarian foodie.

Zomato has perfectly categorised them as hidden gems.. Truly they deserve that.. Went to have dinner there on a Sunday evening .. Located near the Acropolis mall ...

Food quality and taste is just yum and excellent...
We ordered Mutton adrak ke panje... Highly recommended as I haven't had such delicious mutton kebab .. Also had Murg lasuni  kebab which was yum and kabuli nan with those is a must try combi:)

Had bharta and tikka masala which is way more different and tastier than other Indian restaurants..
If you love to have North indian food this is the right place to have it ... Go ahead and try
I would request the management to keep up the good service in terms of food and service... They really serve fast and most importantly food is yummy...

The food here is quite good. Mutton Adrak Ke Punje was highly recommended and it turned out to be a great choice. The Corn Palak (or some such thing it was called) was also on point. Chicken Bharta could've been better; the chicken pieces a weren't very soft. Naan was well made. 
For the price and quality, I would recommend this place.

Edit: Went back after a while. The Dal Makhani is insane as it was before. The service remains really good with the family ambience intact.

Coming to the food, mutton adrak ke punje was so delicately cooked and with such amazing flavors, it was one hell of a foodgasmic experience! Chicken jhaal farezi teamed with butter naan made for the perfect lunch experience. Surely coming back to this place!

The best North Indian food I've had in a while for sure. After eating here now I know why this restaurant got the best North Indian restaurant award for three years in a row and is one of the highest rated restaurants in Zomato. 
Superb food quality, great service. This place doesn't disappoint you in any way. Their trademark dish "Mutton Adrak ke Punje" is definitely a must try when you go here, beautiful soft, tender mutton, not too spicy, this dish is awesome. The other gravy dishes are also pretty amazing. 
Need to go back there soon again to try out some of their other dishes.

Found about this restaurant through Zomato. As it was one of the highest rated North Indian restaurants, decided to go there for a lunch. Located near Acropolis mall, it was not difficult to locate. Rather a place from where you take away food for home, as it can only serve at about 16+ people at a time. We decided to order Murgh Reshmi kebaab for starters, tandoori roti and Chicken tikka butter Masala for main course. I was rather disappointed with the kebabs. Roti was okay. But the chicken tikka butter masala was tasty. The gravy was thick and with good blend of spices. The staff are helpful. Price within the budget. Nothing exceptional.

This one's  a hidden gem  and its discovery  totally made my day! Located very close to Garden high school Kasba, it's a nice and cosy place on the first floor of an apartment building. Coming to the food, mutton adrak ke punje was so delicately cooked and with such amazing flavors, it was one hell of a foodgasmic experience! Chicken jhaal farezi teamed with butter naan made for the perfect lunch experience. Surely coming back to this place!

This place has been always know for its starters (even for vegetarians like me). The best thing i find in their menu is stuffed Tandoori Aloo and Dal Makhani which is one of the best in town. Their service is also good with great new ambience upstairs.

Feeling hungry? And your standing beside acropolis mall...then go to punjabi rasoi. One of the best restaurants in the area undoubtedly. Its mutton adraki is just awsome and you will feel it when it melts in your mouth. And guess what,its fairly reasonable.

Perhaps the best Punjabi food outlet in town. The kababs are soft, juicy and melts in your mouth. You get a variety of breads to try out. My favorite is cheese garlic butter naan. Most of the items will satisfy your taste buds.

This is more than a hidden gem just in the opposite lane where Acropolis Mall ends.The place is not that spacious.But the food is AMAZING.We ordered Mutton Adrak Ke Panje and Biriyani.Unfortunately there was no biriyani that day and so as per the waiter's recommendation we took Kabuli Naan with it.We were two in number.and the naan was of 6 pieces and the 3 mutton pieces were considerably big in size.It was so tender and so perfect in taste.
Mutton Adrak Ke Panje is a MUST HAVE in Panjabee Rasoi 😊

I visited this place with the suggestion of the DC South of Kolkata Police. He seemed very delighted with the place so I went in with my friends for a Sunday lunch. They had seating sections across two floors and we were seated in the ground floor which had the kitchen but was not manned at all times with staff to wait tables. Anyway, we ordered like crazy since none of us had breakfast. It included two kinds of Dals, two non-vegetarian main course preparations, a veg main course preparation, lots of breads including the amazing stuffed kulchas cooked perfectly and masala papads and beverages including soft drinks and everything. 5 of us had lunch there and the bill was only Rs. 2200. Very surprised since the place had consistently won the Times Food Guide Award for Best North Indian food for three years. The mutton was exceptionally cooked and we liked the gravy as well. The Chicken reshmi main course was also very soft and amazing gravy for someone who doesnt like spicy food. They didnt have rumali roti or garlic laccha parantha but the breads they had were very well cooked and seemed like homemade rather than restaurant quality. I gave 2 points for the food, 1 point for hygiene & cleanliness, .5 for owner behaviour and .5 for presentation. 1 point more could have been earned with better service and ambience upgradation. Fantastic recommendation!

there are places which you dont expect too much from and then they take you up in a storm... that was Punjabee Rasoi for me.... the look from outside was very tough to figure out how the food is going to be but post reading amazing reviews on Zomato we went in anyway.... this place is located just behind acropolis mall in kasba.... on entering your hope go way high cause the place is smelling of awesome food and it is clean and nice... the staff is friendly and willing to help you order the right things as well... we met with the owner and he took over our whole order and suggested the best there is too have.... we started off with the mushroom tikkas which were so good that we had a small squabble for the last piece... post which for the main course the dal makhani and the palak corn... they were just amazing and a must order... normally at a north indian place it is the dal which is the make or break factor for me.... but the dal in this place can give big big places a run for their money.... other than these we ordered the paneer makhani which was average and the egg masala which was very good as well... in the rotis the kabuli naan is a must try and the tadoori paratha is also something a person should call for.... i have only 1 small complains... one that there was no diet coke which a strict no no in todays world. 

this place i have added to my normal go to place for indian food as the taste is just amazing and the pinch to the pocket is not that great... overall a fantastic experience and a must visit place.

It was truly awesome a couple of years back. Reasonable. And awesome food. And large quantities. Nowadays its become much more expensive. Prices for almost all items have doubled and quantities have gone down. But quality is still the same and the food still tastes awesome. Id strongly recommend the chicken khushnawa kabab or the lasuni kabab. The mutton adrake kabab is also awesome. I usually have them with kabuli naan. The dal makhani is awesome too. But due to recent decorations and revamping.. Theyve had to reduce the quantities and increase price... But theyve kept the quality constant.

The murg lasuni kebab was good the chicken was soft and melted n mouth, though it took quite a lot time to get it ready.
Tried chicken biriyani total waste of money and time. Not at all good. Could not even finish it.
Chicken Jhal Farezi was also awful. The chicken seemed to be stale and tough.
Service was okay...

For me the rating of 4.4 here seems to be misleading.

I could locate the restaurant from the rear end of the Acropolis mall. This is not my 1st visit. I have been to this place long back when it just started. The owner shared his personal life and ensured hospitality to its best.
The food here is never disappointing, coz what I tasted then, still tastes the same.
Palak corn and dal makhni make a good combi for veg lovers.
Kabuli nan(little sweet), mutton adrakk ke panje, murg lasuni kebab.. The tenderness of the meat is just amazing.

Dropped down to Kolkata for the NYE. We planned a small reunion and it was getting hell difficult to decide over a good restaurant to dine in (keeping aside Park Street due to Traffic and Parking problems).
After a good scrutiny in Zomato, we decided Punjabee Rasoi because of the amazing reviews. It totally lived up to each word spoken in favour of this restaurant. 
Many spoke against the service time, but I did not face that problem, in fact it was impressively quick.
Dal Makhni was bliss. Punjabee Dum Aloo was just perfect. Butter Naan soft and had a taste that made the food even better.

Only thing that I would point against them could be the presentation of the food items and to add some new-ness in the Vegetarian starters so that it can become The North Indian Cuisine Restaurant in Kolkata, for both Vegetarians and Non Vegetarians. #kudos

Reached here around 10 at night on new year's eve. I've heard a lot of good things about this place. We ordered chicken adraki kabab as starter. They served four leg pieces which was good enough for four of us. The taste was amazing. The chicken was perfectly flavored and cooked .
For main course I wanted biryani but it got over before we reached.so I settled for veg pulao and kadhai chicken. Other orders were mutton kasha , masala kulcha and butter naan. Everything was good enough. 
The mutton and chicken preparations were lip smacking. :D

They weren't accepting debit or credit cards which created a little problem.

Happy eating!

Punjabee rasoi as the name suggests brings you a brand of food from the authentic punjabi households. Full of different & unique spices blended together to produce lip smacking food.
So on the eve of new year we decided to hit this place for a delightful lunch. Due to the occasion we went there early to get our seats considering the rush. This is situated at the opposite of acropolis' 2nd entrance in white building. The place is spread out with 2 floors(ground + 1st). We were seated in the 1st floor which had a larger dining space as compared to the ground floor. So moving on we ordered the following items:-

1. Mutton adrak ke panje= Ordered this on the recommendation of fellow zomatians. This dish is their speciality. It consisted of 3 succulent mutton pieces marinated in garlic & other spices. It was outstanding to say the least. Must try dish.

2. Lehesuni murg(F)= 4 leg pieces of chicken nicely charred & the cooking of the chicken was perfect. Tastewise it was awesome as well. Another must try dish.

3. Butter nan= Our original order was garlic nan but since it wasnt available so we had to settle ourselves with butter nans. Thin pieces of nan nicely made without being too doughy or too thick.

4. Chicken tikka butter masala= 6 pieces of chicken tikka served in medium spicy gravy. The taste was authentic indeed & went very well with the nans.

5. Kadai chicken= This was taken by 2 of our companions. Although didnt taste the chicken but tried the gravy. The gravy was spicy & rich which went well with me since i love spicy gravies.

6. Chicken biriyani= This was also taken by our companions. Normal biriyani served with potato & chicken. They didnt like it that much.

7. Fresh lime soda

We also wanted to try their phirnis but unfortunately it wasnt ready so we had to give that a miss. The overall food experience was good but their service needs improvement in my opinion as we found it to be a bit disjointed & slow. The owner gave us a visit & asked about our meal and he even offered us a complementary bowl of dal makhani which we accepted happily & it tasted awesome as well. The pocket pinch was on the lighter side with the total bill coming to around 2000(400 per head) since they dont charge any extra vat/service tax.

Been there a lot of times. Wonderful food quality, probably one of the best restaurants in kolkata, though little bit hidden from the main road. If you visit there, mutton adrak ke panje is a must have starter, dont miss it. The only downside I found is the lack of handwash in the first floor (when you go for dinner). I had excellent experience every time I visited this place

A solid MUAAAAH for Mutton Adrak ke panje n chicken makhmali kebab....Just awesome...10 on 10. Thanks Tarunava for ur strong recommendation, otherwise I would have opted for any Chinese restaurant in Park st in this festive mood. May be the best kebab in kolkata n its ok if they offer 3 pieces @rs 340. For d kebabs 10 on 10,for mutton biriyani 7 on 10,I prefer Arsalan more (may b I m li'l bit partial). We also took garlic butter nun,tandoori roti,chicken tarka n fresh lime soda. All foods were served hot n served well. Ll visit again again only for kebabs though.

Very very impressed with the quality.
For starters,the murgh malai kebab was heavenly! With generous servings of malai.
Paneer tikka was moderate.
For the main course,all the side dishes were delicious. Made with the right amount of everything. Dal makhani,dum aloo and tikka masala : all were flawless.
Butter naan was not up to the mark but doable.
Food presentations should be looked after. :3

Ambience and service are nothing worth mentioning. But the food makes it an amazing experience.

These along with Kabuli naan is a treat for your taste buds. The main course is not bad, but not comparable to the quality of the kebabs. The ambience is not that great,service is good though.

Naan and Chicken Butter Masala were hot & delicious.
The food was highly satisfactory but the price was a bit on the high side.

After reading such raving reviews of this place I was eager to go there. Found the place easily bcoz mos zomato reviewers had given directions. I must say that I'm a bit disappointed with the place. Not that the food was bad per se. In fact it was quite good but the hype of the various reviewers had made me expect magic and that extra zingwas  p missing .We had Paneer tikka,dal makhani,kadhai paneer with Kabuli naan. All were good. As was the firni we had for dessert. The fresh lime soda too was good . So as I said I can't. Really fault any food item BUT....no zing.
The service was not good...they didn't bother to serve us. Just put the food on the table and left. Also had to ask for cutlery. Price wise also I felt it was high compared to ambience and service.

Punjabee rasoi- An amazing place to satisfy all your punjabi food cravings.
 We ordered mutton adrak ke punje-it took me to another dimension altogether. Each bite was delicious to the core of it. For the main course we had dal makhani , chicken tikka butter masala, butter naan, lachha paratha & egg biriyani...all the dishes were finger licking good...
Can't wait to make a few more trips there...;) -

I was considering trying this place out from sometimes, and made it on last week. My experience had been pleasant over all as per my expectation. 

Location : It is not difficult to locate if you can reach Acropolis Mall without glitches. 

Ambiance : It is moderately well, as there is scope of improvement. I visited the place at around 3 pm in a weekday, so crowd was less. We dined in the ground floor area, there were two separate air-conditioned areas, we chose the one in outer side. It is was simple and comfortable but nothing overwhelming.

Food : Well, the menu contains typical North Indian dishes, and we ordered 3 kebabs - Chicken Pahari, Chicken Khusnawa and Fish Tikka. Chicken Khusnawa was really tasty, and the meat was well cooked which is crucial to kebabs. Rest were average. Along with that we ordered Stuffed Kulcha and Chicken Bharta. I personally think, Chicken Bharta could have been better. Over all, the starters were filling and can be recommended.

Service : This is the part, where I think Punjabee Rasoi stands out a bit. I really like the way the staffs asked for suggestion regarding the quality of the food, and if we were comfortable or would like to change sitting. 

Cost : The cost was moderate, justifying the quality and quantity of the dishes.

Wrapping up, I rate this place 4 over all and would say it is good option for casual eating outs.

Yesterday, on the occasion of my mother's birthday, went there. It is located in a quiet isolated place somewhat. You have take the left turn adjacent to the Acropolis Mall, then the second left turn again and there you will find it. The place was neat and clean with not much of decorations. The waiters were very much courteous. We ordered Mutton Adrak ke Punje and Murg Lasuni Kebab for the starters. Both were just awesome, specially the former one. The Mutton was cooked very well, was soft and tasted out of the world. Best ever kebab I had. For the main course we ordered Special Mutton Biryani, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and tandoori rotis. The biryani was not that great, quantity was less, but again the mutton piece of the biryani was great. The Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was also pretty good. We were so full that we couldn't try anything more. The bill for 5 of us costed around Rs 2200, and it was reasonable considering the great kebabs we had. A must visit for the kebab lovers. Overall a nice experience, hope to visit it again to try the other kebabs and dishes and maybe I can come up with an even better rating.

P.S: Mr Raju, the owner is a very nice man. He went around from table to table suggesting the kebabs and the dishes we should try.
P.S.S: Was very hungry and the food looked so delicious and smelt so good that I forgot to click pictures.

This place was on my wishlist for quite some time and we decided to give it a try today. Being situated near the newly opened acropolis mall, it is very easy to locate and it will take you around 5 mins walking from acropolis mall! I had high expectations from this place but one thing which disappointed me was the service, it was too SLOW. 
                          The food was good and we tried the chicken lasooni kebab and the chicken special biriyani. The lasooni kebab was just brilliant and the biriyani was light and less oily, something different from the regular biriyanis that we have in arsalan or aminia!  
                        The interiors and the ambience of this place is simply and classy and the prices of the dishes are also quite reasonable. The only drawback was the poor service though the restaurant was almost empty. Nevertheless, we were satisfied with our visit to this place!

Though the location can be a bit confusing, you should visit this place for its food. Its awesome. Try mutton adrak ki punj and chicken lasuni kebab. I personally don't prefer mutton but even I am floored by its taste. Its soft,juicy and the taste absolutely lingers in your mouth long after. Must visit.  Only thing is you have to carry cash with you as this restaurant doesn'tyet accept debit or credit cards.

Its a very new restaurant and near to the new mall of kolkata "Acropolis mall". This is a new small restaurant and its mughlai cuisines are lip smacking undoubtedly. We had adrak mutton.. For starters it was awesome. Then for main dish we ordered butter nun it was soft and tikka butter masala was buttery also. All over it was a good experience.

We had a long longgg wish to visit Punjabee Rasoi, as we stay nearby. However, today it clicked on suddenly and we were there in no time. As per the suggestions, we had ordered Mutton adrak ke punje,Dal makhani,Chicken reshmi butter masala,Tandoori roti.... And yesss it really triggered our taste buds. I love north Indian delicacies and visit many restaurants and most importantly these menu was nothing new except the mutton starter. But I admit Punjabee rasoi serves the best... The bestest best...yummy

Went for dinner last night, and the taste of the Mutton Adrak ke Punje is still stuck in my mouth!
It was simply delicious and we couldn't just stop at one. The Chicken Kebab was also very delicious.
Ambiance is good and it is a decent restaurant where you can go with friends as well as family.
The service was super fast! The food we ordered was served within about 20-25 minutes. And the staff was very courteous, not to mention a couple of naughty kids jumping around and bothering them so much!
All in all, a great experience. I'm sure to visit again.

Pros: Lip smacking dishes, good ambiance, 
Cons: hard to find place, and have to wait long for your food.
So if you are not in hurry and really not hungry this place can be a good choice..

The BEST place to have Kebabs in town. Mutton Adrak-e-Punjey would definitely take you to the 7th heaven and you would surely be craving for more. Murg Lasuni is equally splendid, and tastes fantabulous. Their main courses, both Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian are lipsmacking.. Be it Corn Palak, Babycorn and Mushroom, Dal Makhani or Chicken Tikka Butter Masala or Mutton Rogan Josh or any other side dish. Their Malai Kulchas and Garlic Naans are to die for. I just can't get enough of this treasure named Punjabee Rasoi..trust me! Firni is delectable as well. All this you can hog at an affordable price and come out of the place happy, satisfied and a few inches fatter. So worth it... I have been visiting this place ever since its inception, and the quality of food and service have kept me glued always. The owner is soo nice and friendly, that you would have to thank him wholeheartedly for the awesome food and service. I have rated verry few places a 5 on Zomato, but this one by far has been my most favourite out of those few 5 rating holders.

Took a hell lot of time to finally be there considering its not even a km from my house. I must say it was simply worth the wait. The Kebabs are simply awesome. We ordered Adrak k Panje along with Lasuni Murg. Both were amazing. In main course we went for Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Chicken Bharta which is quite common but still managed to get us going after the heavenly starters. A must go for all North Indian food lovers.

A nice and cosy place behind kasba kfc. A little hard to find. The food is awesome and so is the place. The owner himself looks after guests and takes reviews! Coming to the food, the kababs are to die for. We had ordered lasuni kabab, kabuli nan and chicken jhal farezi. Both the kabuli nan and lasuni kabab is a must try. Loved the place.

Hi foodies!

=14th November, 2015=
We seriously had never heard of this place before. My friend stays in Kasba itself and she too hadn't. It is now a bit more popular thanks to the Acropolis Mall. (Just two mins walking distance from there).

Food:
For starters, if you love chicken, try the Chicken Lasoni Kebab. If you love mutton, try the Mutton Adrak ke Punje. If you love both, like we do, try them both. :) Both are succulent and almost fall off the bone.

For the main course, we had Dal Makhani and Cheese Garlic Naan. The Naan is so tasty that it could be had alone. I was a bit apprehensive in having a veg dish but the Dal lived up to the hype.

-Cons-
1. The decor is very unimpressive. The upper floor was closed off. The tables for two are so clumsy that you'd prefer sitting on a multi capacity table.

2. Fresh lime soda, card payment; these were not available. I believe an award winning restaurant should ALWAYS have these basic things which majority of customers avail.

-Endnote-
The major draw of the restaurant is the price. All prices are INCLUSIVE of all taxes. (Yes you read that right!) All the above dishes were availed at a price of 990rs.
Highly recommended. :)

-Bon Appétite. :)

Punjabee Rasoi is a quaint little place in kasba with some of the best melt-in-your-mouth kababs. Try the much vaunted mutton adraki and the ajwaini fish tikka kababs. Stuff yourself with the kababs for the main course both in terms of choice and taste is just about decent with a couple of exceptions.  For the mains do try the dal tarka for unlike most of the dhabas in kolkata it is freshly made and is very very good. Well if the kabas are to die for and the dal is great then why is it just 3. Well for one they do not accept anything but cash which meant we had to go running for an ATM. In today's day and age it is unacceptable for a restaurant to run like so. The service is also on the poorer side with slightly confused and disinterested staff. An improvment on these grounds and I am sure this place would be a 4 and by that statement alone one knows that i am going to give it another shot.

Mutton adraki, chicken lasooni and kabuli nan mwuuaah!
A little bit far off but worth the journey.

They should open more outlets and then it will be given the 0.5 more.

Quite easily one of the best restaurants in the city offering North Indian food. The only con, in my experience, is that food is limited. You might or might not get some dishes during lunch time or so. But otherwise, you wouldn't want to miss it for the world. Food is amazing. Price is decent. The ambience is decent. But the food *drools*. Whenever I go there, I try out their "Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala." Out of this world. Sometimes they get creative with their dishes and it usually turns out to be amazing. I'd give it a full 5 if that particular con isn't there but that can be fixed easily I suppose.

Did your food ever smell and visually appeal to you so much that you couldn't keep your patience to just devour it? Yes, that is how good the Mutton Adrak ke Panje was, which was accompanied by the Kabuli Naan. I didn't know whether to click a picture of it then eat it or just eat it, so I did the latter. The food is oh-so-amazing. Must try the Lasuni Murg and Dal Makhaani as well. Nice, warm and a cozy little place with brilliant food.

Easily the best punjabi food I have had in a loooooong time in Kolkata. Mutton adraki is highly recommended. The meat just falls off the bone and is super soft and succulent. The dal makhani, chicken tikka butter masala and butter naan that we had for main for just as finger licking! I am honestly surprised that this place doesn't feature in the "hidden gems" section in zomato.
If you are craving for some delectable punjabi food in this side of the city..Punjabee Rasoi is your best bet in my opinion.

We had mutton adraki punje for starters. They tasted great. For main course we had dal makhni, chicken tikka butter marsala and naan. They were phenomenal. Best north Indian I have tasted in Kolkata so far( better than tandoor park, BBQ nation, sigree etc.).

Top notch punjabi food. We used to get home deliveries from this place regularly for their beautiful tandoori rotis, absolutely creamy kali dal or dal makhani, and punchy, spicy chicken dishes. The keema mattar is something I love with a plate of steaming basmati rice. 
 The paneer  butter masala is a favourite. They use such fresh, soft paneer in their dishes, that the heart warms up when you have a spoon of it.

Even while dining in, punjabee Rasoi appears small and somewhat homely on the inside, but the food compensates for all of that. Yes it does.

That was awesome, and tandori chicken was juicy but must try is Dal Makhni.. After a long time since Delhi.. I really felt I had authentic Dal Makhni.. Typical punjabi style.. We had our apetite full but felt light still after such robust lunch!

WORST RESTAURANT 
First the food quality is very average.
They served fish curry instead of paneer butter masala. They insisted it to be paneer even after asking thrice, when we doubted it. The owner and the waiters have no remorse knowing that three of my vegetarian friends had it. This speak volumes about concern and care they have for their customers.
BIG NO

Location: In the lane adjacent Acropolis Mall.

The magnificent Acropolis Mall adorns the Kasba area with its motto of shop, work, club and dine and has also become one of the biggest landmarks around the area making it easier for people to locate hidden gems around. One such gem is Punjabee Rasoi which earlier was difficult to locate due to it being established in the by lanes of Kasba. Now, easy to locate, happened to visit it hours before the inauguration of The Acropolis Mall over lunch.
Established inside a residencial building, this place is simple and of the non-descript type in terms of AMBIANCE. More of a flat revamped to a restaurant, it had pink textured walls with showpieces and picture frames around on the wooden panelling. There's another section for seating with a total for approximately thirty heads.

But, the FOOD out here is something to drool over. Hardly would you find such a quality around the area. ORDERED the following:

- Pindi Chana
Perfectly boiled chickpeas tossed in a flavorful masala mix, sautéed ginger and onion. Served with a lemon wedge. Apart from being slightly low on salt it was delicious! Recommended.

- Dal Makhani
Black lentils simmered overnight along with balanced spices and butter. Had a perfect creamy texture. However, this dish was also low on salt. Except that, lip-smackin' it was. Recommended.

- Tandoori Roti
The roti was requested to be crisp, but sadly it was soft and slowly turned chewy. Disappointed.

- Garlic Naan
Perfectly baked flatbread with a generous yet, balanced chopped garlic on top. Served with a slight brush of butter. Nice to taste.

- Plain Naan
Light and fluffy flatbread, perfectly baked it was.

- Green Salad
Consisted of Cucumber, Tomato, Carrot and Onion with Lemon wedges and chilies to compliment.

The SERVICE by the friendly and polite STAFF was found to be slightly slow.
PRICES were found to be set at reasonable bars.

Overall was a good experience.

Went with my friends and family last weekend. Place is like remotely located inside streets without any name board, small 2 floor restaurant. Food was delicious, chicken tandoori, rice fried, chicken lahsan kabab, chicken butter masala, paneer mushroom, and naan. Ambience was amazing, it was quite a surprise as it was looking very ordinary house kinda building. What really disappointed us was service. We had to keep asking for things, what is generally noticed and asked by a waiter or may be they had crowd which was difficult to handle for them but they should take care this so that they can deliver best experience. I would have given 5/5 but for since I believe they need more space (it was really congested there), and  service should be better. So I'll give 4/5, on based of good food and good ambience.

To start off i want urge everyone to visit this joint for some delectable, mouthwatering and toothsome Punjabi fare without hurting your pocket severely. Located near the newly built Acropolis Mall, Punjabee Rasoi is a moderate sized restaurant with an unpretentious and homely atmosphere serving finger licking dishes and meeting our innate meat cravings day in and day out.I have visited this restaurant twice before but the last time was a true revelation for i have never imagined that the taste of Biriyani of a not so old and celebrated restaurant could trump that of the legendary Arsalan. I aslo tried other dishes such as Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masla which were both soft and succulent. The portions were generous and each mouthful tickled our taste buds is such a manner that we yearned for more and more. Although i have not tried the appetizers but I have heard high praises for Chicken Lasuni Kebab and Mutton Adrak ke Punje, which i just can't wait to put my paws on (This Puja I must and I will). 
Kudos to Punjabee Rasoi for this Culinary achievement and for those all who wants to experience a punjabi bhangra in their taste buds, I suggest you to visit this place ASAP.

What an amazing place to satiate one's hunger for really well cooked and juicy kebabs. The food items are quite innovative. From starters to dessert there was no single let down. 
We ordered chicken lasooni kebab, fish amritsari, mutton adrak panje ( tastes as royal as it sounds) in starters. We ordered for garlic nun, kulcha that catered to our taste buds very well, also there was no after taste, we did not feel heavy at all. They went well with karhai paneer, and the surprisingly good dish - saagwala mutton. They even allowed us to taste a heavenly daal though we did not order for it. What a nice gesture towards food lovers like us. The guy who was recommending was really good. He came up with the idea of having masala sprite, and yes it was superb as well. Firni was also worth a try. Thank you punjabee rasoi for your amazing service. This place is definitely going to be on our favourite list. We wish you all the very best.

Long time back (almost 2 yrs ago) when I heard about this restaurant, it was rated 4.5 and the best place to eat near bypass-ruby area. Now when I browsed the nearby places to eat, it still remains the best one with the same rating. Now that is called consistency, which most of the restaurants in Kolkata lack. 
Reaching there, it seemed an ordinary small local restaurant, not accepting cards and bulk of the customers waiting for take away. I was skeptical,doubtful and unsure about the food. But OMG, I was gladly proved wrong when the food arrived us. Served Hot, fresh and good in quantity. I loved the Kabuli Naan and the Chicken Lasuni Kebab. But what I would request, urge and desperate ask the readers to order is the Mutton Adrak ke Punje. It was incredibly good, and one of the best tender mutton I have ever had. We also ordered one veg mushroom babycorn dish which was equally mind blowing. 
I would definitely come back for more options and Mutton Adrak ke Punje again and again..
Keep up the good food !!! Very Impressed n Happy :) :)

Oh just forgot to mention, no service tax, no vat and not much pain to the pocket too. With four of us after full lunch we paid some 1200 Rs. Good price.

My go to place for comfort food. The decor and ambience is simplistic and hygienic and the service is fast. But generally I take away. Recommended: their veg dishes are splendid. Dal makhani is example of a perfect dish. Other examples of excellence palak paneer, palak corn, dum aloo. In starters definitely try fish ajwaini tikka, murg lasuni kebab, adraki punje. These dishes are examples of perfect kebabs. In breads definitely recommended cheese garlic naan, butter naan. Kabuli naan is over rated though. Too sweet and overwhelms the side dishes. Among non veg definitely try chicken saag. However be warned it is an extremely popular place. So the waiting period for a dine in on weekends is pretty long. Take away is efficient and fast.

BEST. KEBABS. EVER.

Undoubtedly the best place for kebabs I have experienced in my life. This is considering my multiple visits to Barbeque Nation, Flame and Grills and Sigree Global Grill, who have mainly kebabs and grills as their USP. This small but cozy establishment offers the most delicious, juiciest mutton in the form of Adrak ke Panje, and the Chicken Malai Kebab is worth dying for! The fish kebab is my wife's favourite, and one hardly can finish the Kaabuli Naan alone. The side dishes are a bit off when compared to the kebabs, but certainly can stand out on their own. However the kebabs wins over all the other offerings hands down, and these made us visit this modest restaurant in Kasba time and again, all the way from Baguihati.

We regret that we never were lucky to get the chance to try the other mutton preparation, Makhmali. Also it becomes a bit crowded at prime times, so prior reservation is recommended. The stuff are courteous and the ever smiling manager/owner is always there to help out. The ambience has improved tenfold after the renovation done sometime back. 

Ambience: 3.5
Service: 4
Food: solid 5.5 for starters


Repeat: A must try for any foodie who lives in Kolkata.

Aloo Paratha-It was an average dish and we were reminded by the owner that it is a Tandoori Aloo Paratha which will be unlike the usual ones. It was nice and soft but I wish the filling was more spicy. 

Veg Kofta-The koftas could have been softer than what it was since some portions within each kofta was dry and we had to discard those areas and then consume.

Chicken Do-Piazza-It was okay and nothing that surpassed our expectations.

We could not try the house favourites such as Adrak ke Panjje as had to stick mostly to vegeterian options for some reasons. 

However, will give above and more items a try and revert accordingly. Till then my rating for the joint remains the same.

To start off, honestly the best punjabee food in Kolkata. This food taste quality and quantity is spectacular. The dal is the best. The naans are thin and soft. The ambiance is nice. The only let down that day was the service it was slower than a snail but the food can just ignore that. I can wait hours for that taste. Our hospitality was well taken care of and the owner himself assisted us in every step.

Mouthwatering kabab wala after a longtime. ...mutton adraki one of the best and different type I had...can't wait for the second visit. Hope they will keep up the same quality. But backdraw - bldg looks like a small standalone flat and also they don't accept cards at this age...but price is little higher than the expectations like ambiance and others already described. Never try biriyani out here as its almost as same as any canteen. Chicken kabab is not satisfactory as its hard in texture... dont try the mutton makhmali as it wasn't good in taste

I heard so much about food orgasms but had my first when i tried their palak paneer. The gravy was creamy melted and mixed with good quality palak and cooked to perfection. The texture is also appreciable. 
The mutton keema was equally good. With matar tue gravy tasted better. The mutton just melts in the mouth.
This place has to be the best palak paneer i have ever had.

Heard a lot about Punjabee Rasoi from friends and read reviews on Zomato,so decided to visit the place on my 23rd birthday,and the place lived up to its expectations. Adrak ka Kunj is a must,and Ajwani fish tikka is something out of this world. Mutton saag with Kabuli nan is too good. Overall,if you love grilled items and a quiet place to enjoy them,this is the place to be.

Awesome food. Beautiful hospitality. The food are authentic Punjabi preparation. And their Adrake Panje is just the triumph card. It will just bold u away. Must visit must try. Only thing dat may bother u is that they don't accept card.

This place is really good and near acropolish mall. Authentic north Indian, panjabi food at reasonable prices. We had kababs, kadai chkn, chkn varta with Masala Kulcha and Butter Rotis.  the food here reminded me of homely food. The food was not just really teaty but also light for health.

Awesome food, awesome service. This is one of the rare places where I found the manager taking complete responsibility to decide on our food menu as we asked to serve non-vegetarian food in both starter and main course where chicken and prawn should not be served at all :)
I have recommended this restaurant to everyone I know.

We have been a regular at this place since few years. Clearly remember my first visit, a small little place tucked off the ruby connector behind siemens. The place actually started off as a rasoi that was serving typically punjabi food with limited seating space and no a/c's.
Today the place has ground and 1st Floor with A/c's and superior interior. What has remained consistent is the quality of food which is the same every time you visit.
The owners are involved with personalized attention to each table to date.
Must try for starters : Bharwan Alu Gilafi, Murg Khusnawa Kebab, Adrak ke Punje and Paneer Tikka. I also have Bundi Raita for starters. The bundi in the raita is very crisp and crunchy.
For the mains I'd recommend Roti, Dal Makhni, Egg tarka and Palak Corn.
You should not miss the phirni here.

Punjabee Rasoi....Thank you for made my birthday (yesterday) so special,thanks a lot.When i entered at 7 pm with my girlfriend,it was empty but not more than half an hour.I am proud for your meat cravings collection,super tasty food with decent behaviour.
             Murg Lasuni Kebab & Mutton Adrak ke Punje both are fabulous,i knew these two are your signature dishes but what a signature guys..both are very tasty & reasonable price also.In main course Chicken Tikka Butter Masala is awesome and most importantly chicken & mutton quality was very very good,the dish was also spicy.
              Then ordered Malai Kulcha,Cheese garlic naan,Butter Naan.Tastewise everything was superb but naan sizes are not good enough comapare to prices,i think naan & kulcha both prices are reasonable but they are thin & small,it should be good enough.you have to take atleast 3 naan or kulcha to compare with  2 naan or kulcha of any other good restaurents...but i repeat that the taste was very good.Atlast Masala drink was nice.
                                               otherwise everything was in its place,good ambience,
comfortable sitting arangement,not any behavioral issue..Faced a little problem to locate this restaurent but Zomato helps me. Welldone & keep going.

P.S- Prices are inclusive of all taxes(so,its very much reasonable)

This restaurant is very popular in zomato and that's the reason I visited this place today. With the appreance of the restaurant I wasn't impressed its a small restaurant below a flat.
Now to food. We ordered mutton adrak ke panje and murg lasuni kebab not of which were immensly delicious. In the main course we ordered kabuli naan and butter naan both of which were awesome specially the kabuli naan, chicken tikka butter masala and chicken reshmi butter masala were also verry nice. This joint makes one of the best food in town.
Thumbs up 
Cheers

And the garlic naan and malai kulcha were of same taste..the size was also too small.. i really didn't have idea that the quality of punjabee rasoi degrades so poorely.. it was really a hopeless lunch we had today..

Punjabee Rasoi is slowly emerging as a well known place for north Indian food in Kolkata and has created a special niche among all other popular restaurants. This special place or popularity is for its kababs. I can say that I have tasted the best mutton kababs here. Adrak Ke Panje is something that is a must try for anyone who visits this place and also becomes a reason why people go there so often. The kababs are succulent, juicy, soft and in short just amazing! To add to their kababs section is the Chicken Lasooni Kabab which is also very yummy. The food is good in quantity as well as quality. However, the restaurant does not really create that special ambiance of a restaurant. I would recommend this place for anyone who loves kababs.

I have been to this place twice. I am writing this review after my last visit yesterday.
The food is good but I find it overpriced in comparison with other well known places. 
The number of pieces in side dishes are less and even the rotis and parathas are much lighter and smaller in size. Even the waiter did not serve the dishes after bringing it to the table.I am surprised that they do not take payments via debit/credit cards.

Whatever else you order, order the mutton adrak starter. It is soft, juicy and superbly well seasoned. I can't really find flaw in it. At 290 bucks, they serve three pieces per plate and I would say it is a killer deal. 

I also had the dal makhni and chicken do pyaja parceled. The dal makhni is excellent for the taste pallete most of us have, that is it is not sweet and cream based as the Dilli-wala dhaba version will be. This has a tinge of heat, in an otherwise rich creamy curry. I like my dal makhni just like this. So full marks ! 

The chicken do-pyaja was somewhat ordinary,  but not bad at all. 

Service took about an hour. I marked them 4/5 because I sampled too few items and I am yet to visit the place upon which I will re-write my review.

Again i followed zomato and again I wasn't disappointed. Located inside a bylane, this place can be a little tricky to locate but the zomato app has the location nailed so just follow that. The tandoori chicken was awesome and the mutton was just to die for. The service very helpful and courteous. Definitely recommend it to people.

I was a big fan of this place with only one visit in the kitty, i said "was" but it does not mean the food is bad, the food is excellent, but i was a little disappointed today. We had packed some of the food we could not finish, namely 1 piece of Adrak ke Punje and half of Palak Corn. On opening the packet, the kabab had huge deposits of dalda on it, which almost made it un-eatable but we managed. When we had left the Palak Corn from the table, it was almost half the bowl it was in, but the packed item was not even one-third of the quantity we had seen! But again, the food is good...!

And the Card acceptance business.. guys, people don't carry that much cash on themselves these days.. Have a heart, get a card payment system!

I went with my wife and 7yr kid. Ordered Mutton adrak ki punj, and lasoni chicken kebab to start with. Both the dishes were delicious. Mutton was so soft that, it easily looses off bone and melts in your mouth. A fresh lime soda goes well.
As a variation, we tried Mutton saag with malai kulcha. I was skeptical till I tried this combination. It was wonderful to try.
Ambience was good. Servers were courteous.
Only problem they are not accepting credit card. So, I had to drive a minute to ATM to pay off. Price is descent. Not sure how long that would be as Acropolis will have a positive impact on this restaurant.

I would have never known what I was missing if it hadn't been for my cousin treating us to lip smacking kababs and main course. Not having heard about the place, we (group of 4) went to this place expecting medium prices and a standard affair. How wrong could I have been. When we left after 2 hours, I had already planned the course fare for my next trip to Punjabee rasoi.

We started with 3 starters - Mutton Adrak ke Punje, Murg Lasuni Kabab and Murg Malai Kabab. Now if you haven't been to Punjabee Rasoi before like me, you should know that we ordered Food of the Gods. All the three items were just awesome and for the critics, it was served quickly as well. In fact, the guy who took the order suggested Kabuli Naan with the starters. Another Yum choice...

Finally for the main course, we ordered naan, palak corn and Murg Lasuni Kabab (again!) and to was all this down, Fresh lime soda. Trust me when I say that I have never had such beautifully tasting Palak Corn before...simply yet just great. And before I forget, the fresh lime soda had fizz (unlike lot of major restaurants where the fizz has died as big soda bottles are used).

The bill too was quite decent. Considering all that we ate, it was just about 400+ per person. 

After such a heavenly experience, I definitely cannot criticize these guys for anything. Still it would be better if the place is tidied up a bit. The seats on the first floor looked great but the ground floor arrangement needs to be uplifted, specially since people are always waiting outside.

All in all, I would definitely visit Punjabee Rasoi again and the restaurant would have to serve something real bad next time to stop me from going again and again.

We started with the signature mutton starter, adrak ke panje, along with ajwani fish tikka. Both very well prepared.. Spicy, juicy.. Everything you would like a good starter to be.. Mains was super fresh and fluffy garlic naan with butter chicken tikka masala... And fresh lime soda to accompany.. A supremely good meal and an excellent experience. 

Decent portion sizes and not too much wait time are additional benefits of this place.. Am already planning a re-visit :)

When it comes to tasty north Indian food, nothing parallels this place. Service is quick too. Its a place you feel like going back to for the taste and would give it full points on that. Few minuses accompany however. The larger sitting is open only on weekends and the smaller area is really small given the traffic it attracts. And they do not accept cards.

your taste buds are spoilt once you have kebabs at Punjabi Rasoi...thats cos you will not enjoy kebabs anywhere else. I have been visiting this place for quite a while and the best part that their food has been consistent in quality and taste. the must haves here are Chicken Lasooni Kebab, Mutton Adrak ke Punje and Tandoori Chicken. Vegetarians should definately try the Bharwan Alu. Main course one will not be disappointed in they have the Mutton/ Chicken Saag and the Mutton Keema Masala with either Butter Naan or Garlic Naan.

The main information about food: the food was awesome. The Roti and Nan was perfectly done. Veggies were excellent. They were neither too spicy nor oily. The pindi Channa was good and perfect. Dal makhni was really tasty. Paneer was rich in taste. The price and quantity of veggies was perfect. On the whole we really rejoice the north Indian food after a long time. 😃😄😁😃😁😁😁😂😂😂👍👍👏👏👌👌

If you really love spicy north indian muglai food to be very specific authentic punjabee food here in kolkata then you must visit "Punjabee Rasoi". Trust me after having the food you will not be disappointed. 
Must eat items...
1. Starter: delicious "Mutton Adrat Ke Punj" - a delicious mutton preparation. 

2. Chicken Lasoni Kabab - awesome chicken preparation. 

3. Mutton makhmali kabab - just yum.

4. In main course - Kabuli nan - best in kolkata. Just enjoy the taste of it without anything else in your mouth.

5. Chicken Tikka masala - very nice.

6. Mutton keema.

In veg you can try paneer tikka, dal makhani etc 

Whatever items they are having those are best.

In desert you can try firni. Previously they used to have gajor halua which was awesome.

1800 for 3 people standard food.
Keep one thing in mind payment only in cash. Cards are not accepted.

Njy the food. Just awesome.

After going through almost all the reviews, it was time to hunt this joint. The joint is located a bit off the main road of kasba. Take the lane adjacent to the upcoming Acropolis mall and then again turn left. For sure when you first spot the restaurant, you will say "Yeh Kya hai". But I had read in some of the reviews don't judge by the cover of the book but rather go for the contents and that's exactly what I did. 

Ambiance: Nothing much to talk about it, simple.

Food(the most important): ordered the following, Tanduri chicken, Mutton adrak ke panje, Murg lasuni kebab, chicken bharta, mutton saag, spl Mutton biryani and spl Chicken biryani. Hopefully I had covered the specialties of this joint on the order. Chicken Tanduri, I think I had better Tanduri chicken than this place, the chicken was soft and tender, but taste wise I cannot give much to this. Mutton adrak ke panje, I loved it. Murg lasuni was nice but  I was expecting it to be a bit spicy but eventually its not and tastes good. 

Chicken Bharta, very very ordinary, Mutton saag, for the first time I was having mutton and with a green gravy, and I loved this dish. Though the pieces of mutton were not the best, but I can still score this dish high for the taste. Chicken and mutton biryani above average I would say.

It is definitely a value for money, but if you are planning to pay the bill using your debit card/credit card, they don't have this facility.

Overall nice experience.

Hidden inconveniently in a lane beside the kasba KFC, its authentic punjabi spread makes this restaurant worth the visit. The decor n service are average but the food is finger licking good. Mutton adrak k punje and kabuli naan are must haves.. Any n every kebab dish is cooked to perfection. Loved it :)

Situated in a lane besides KFC (Kasba) this small restaurant serves probably one of the exquisite North indian Cuisine in the city. The space is small with only 2 small rooms but the food is amazing. Mutton Adrak ke Punje was brilliantly cooked. I tried the chicken tikka masala and it was very delicious and juicy as well ! I am very satisfied with my experience here and the only thing they can consider improving is their number of staff.There was only one waiter for each room and we had to wait a bit longer to order our dishes initially.

yes finally the long awaited food and review! as heard mutton adrak ke punje _delicious . so delicious that i would recommend every person out there to have it! it is really remarkable and has set an all new benchmark of mutton! the tandoori roti is what i was not satisfied, it was life cow skin after 5-7 mins and was not chewable. anyway the tandoori butter masala was also good but i have had better . the ambience and service of the restaurant is also very good! ambience 4.5/5

A small but lovely place in the alley opposite to Acropolis,  near gitanjali stadium. Don't be fooled by its ambience or decor, this is the best place for Indian food,  and add to that,  vat inclusive prices,  making it pocket friendly and definitely a bong's delight! 😜
I visited this place today fr a friend's birthday treat. We ordered the following. Good quantity amd excellent food 
Adrak ke panje : three large pieces  of mutton cooked to perfection.  Couldn't ask for a better starter
In main course we had,  garlic nan, malai kulchas, soft and made to perfection.  
With it murgh butter reshmi masala and mutton keema was served. I have never tasted a better white gravy chicken dish. And mutton keema was also as good. 
We also ordered a mixed raita which was okay.
This is the only restro where every dish was lip smacking delicious.  
I would love to come here again!

This place is specially made for north Indian delicacies. The atmosphere and the get up is very warm. It welcomes you whole heartedly. I have tried kabuli nun,lasuni nun,adrak k panje,fish tikka,chicken reshmi butter masala. Adrak ke panje deserves a special mention.the meat is perfectly cooked and its soft and tender. I will give an overall rating of 9.5/10 and will suggest everyone to go and visit the place at least once :)

Good ambience. Food was ok. Though they took almost forever to serve. The naans and chickrn side dishes were tasty and well coocked. But can't say the same about the biriyani. It was too salty and full of unnecessary scents! Will recommend others to stick with naans here.

Beverages : 1/5

Food 4.5/5

It is clear from the above that the USP of this place is food and food alone and that's why I salute the owner of this place in the unwavering confidence towards his products.
A unimpressive location,a dull building,ordinary interiors and muted workforce pale the moment you bite into the Adraki Mutton like we did.Also the tandoori chicken and a fish tikka.With hard chutney and onions our kabab craving was more than satisfied.The flesh was tender,perfectly marinated,cooked to perfection with the flavour intact.
Followed up with keema mutter,alu mutter,chicken tikka masala and the dal,oh the dal,oooohhhhhh the dal.The dal reminded me of the Bukhara,the chicken good,the keema and alu mutter ordinary.Excellent attentive service.Definitely a go back place.

We reached there around 8:15 pm and were told to go upstairs and were also informed that table would be available very soon for four persons. However, this did not happen. They could not even tell us the estimated wait time until table is available. They said they do not accept booking over phone; However when we checked we were informed that they had taken reservations earlier during the day. This was total mismanagement. We lost almost 40 mins due to poor communication. They are incapable of handling and managing customer expectations. Moreover, we also had a kid along with us. Still this was not considered. I am very dissatisfied with the whole experience.

I had huge expectation from this joint. But sadly it was the worst experience I have ever had. We had brought home 3 dishes of which Babycorn Mushroom Masala and Kadhai Paneer was okay but the chicken pieces of Chicken Tikka Masala was badly spoilt. In all these years of eating chicken I never thought it could smell so bad. It's a shame that they have double standards for takeaway food by trying to sell spoilt food. My children vomited and I was worried I may have to take them to the doctor. The Peas Pulao was also really tasteless and half cooked. I don't know how this place gets good ranking. I am definitely not going back to this place.  Please check the food before getting it home. Sorry but Punjabee Rasoi stinks!!!!!!

Visited the restaurant yesterday after seeing all the great Zomato reviews and must say was not disappointed at all having experienced some great Punjabi food in Kolkata after a long time.
The restaurant has a nice modern decor with no over the top gimmicky themes and the focus seems to be on the food and service.
Tried out a few items like the Murg Lassuni kebab, dal makhani, garlic cheese nun etc and every one of the items was excellent especially the kebab which was done just right with the meat soft and succulent and falling off the bones as it should be.
Service was fast and efficient and prices were quite reasonable for the quality and quantity.
This place is now in my favourites list and hope they maintain  the quality and standard of the food and service.

Had some amazing kebab after such a long time! For starters had mutton adrak k punje and murg lassuni kebab with kabuli naan. The kebab was succulent juicy and melts in mouth. The masala kulcha and chicken jhal farezi was pretty good however it's the kebabs which win. Its good food with value for money. In fact  price is very reasonable when it comes to the quality and quantity of food.

Well, I have been their for almost 5 times.
My last visit was in April'17 (For Dinner)

AMBIENCE (4/5) - A small Family resturant, with not much of special/attractive decors.
Homely Environment.
You can laid back and relax in your seat for the waitors to serve the food for you (Hence No Buffet :-p )

SERVICE (4/5) -- Waitors are easy going but not that exuberant like BBQ Nation, HAKKA or Global Grills.
We had to wait for ~20 mins after placing the order. Behaviour of the waitors were good.

FOOD (4.8/5)-- Its really Awesome.
One of the best Mughlai dish that you can taste here.
'Murg Lasuni Kebab' and 'Mutton Adrak k punje' - Simply "KONO KATHA HOBE NA...".
Main courses (Biriyani, Tandoors, Kadai Chicken, Naan) are equally 'finger licking'

POCKET PINCH (4.5/5) -- Very much reasonable.
We were 6 people, and it had cost us ~3000/- (Total)

AREAS that CAN / NEED TO BE IMPROVED / UPGRADED --
1. Service
2. Dessert

**If you love Mughlai Dishes, and want to have a "AHhhh..." feeling after completing your Lunch, PUNJABEE RASOI is A MUST GO**

On recent weekend,we decided to beat the heat, by having some north Indian delicacies. After debating over the place of our choice, we decided to go for Punjabee Rasoi.The place is conveniently located, just off the R B connector, close to upcoming Acropolis mall. As the place was overpacked, we chose take away. 
   The kabuli nan was soft yet crunchy, & not overtly sweet. The chicken reshmi butter masala had thick n very smooth gravy. The boneless chicken pieces were succulent. The mutton kasha was bit spicy,but not too heavy for a summer inflicted stomach. It went perfect with tandoori roti. The chicken bharta was also yummy.
On the basis of our take away menu experience, we definitely revisit  P R, to taste more of their signature dishes.

Oh well!! This was my second visit to this awesome punjabi restaurant and they bowled me again with the taste & quality..! We ordered our favorite two kebabs here mutton adrak ke punje & murg malai kebab. The mutton was so succulent and tender that it melted in my mouth and so was its taste, the meat was literally coming out from the bone. Murg malai kebab.. So creamy & soft that you will lick your fingers over & over again. For the main course we ordered tandoori roti & mutton saag which were awesome. On an earlier visit we tried the cheese garlic nun, chicken jhaal farezi & lehsuni kebab & I must say the quality of food they serve is simply out of this world. The prices are inclusive of VAT & S.Tax & trust me it will not be too heavy on your pocket. In one line I'll call it THE FOOD FOR SOUL!

After having tons of speculation my family and i decided to drop in here... We reached at one go all thanks to the gps. This place is near rajdanga. 

Food: we ordered
1) adrak ke panje
2)mutton makhmali kabab
3 ) dal makhani
4)chicken tikka butter masala
5)choice of naan/roti

Serving time: a bit more specially if someone is waiting for just a roti or naan...

Taste: all the dishes were perfectly done... The mutton was tender ans chicken very soft and juicy. The dal was also very tasty .
Mutton makhmali is recommended.

Ambiance: pretty good... But by 9 suddenly the place filled up really fast..
So do reach early.. The waiter was very helpful and also suggested the dishes very well.

Price: well this place is reasonable... All prices mentioned are inclusive of taxes... But they donot accept CARDS. 
For five the bill was 1650.

Found some difficulty finding this one. Get up is more like a 'flat' than a typical restaurant.
Anyway, I ordered chicken reshmi kebab, lasuni kebab, special chicken & mutton biriyani & chicken tikka butter masala. Kebabs were just sooooo good. Literally melted in my mouth. Lasuni kebab did not tasted different than the reshmi one, yet no complain from my side. Now, biriyani is not like the 'Kolkata' one. Tastes sweeter than the traditional one. I found it over scented too. Tikka butter masala consisted more gravy than the usual. Personally I like the 'kosha' one more. But tasted good.
Hospitality is good, ambience was ok ok. Price is towards the cheaper side which was surprising (no tax was levied extra). Finally, though i t was not that much good as the rating says (4.5 when I checked), but really deserves a try.
P.S: don't forget to take cash, they don't accept card.

I went today to this restaurant.  It is situated near the upcoming shopping mall acropolis.  Nice ambience.  Ordered Mutton Makhmali Kebaab,  Chicken Saag and Mutton Keema Masala along with Tandoori Roti.  Makhmali Kebaab was exquisite.  Texture is sort of galauti Kebaab.  Mutton Keema Masala was standard Taste.  Chicken Saag was also very good.  It had two pieces of chicken with bone cooked with palang Saag.  Liked it.  One disadvantage I must say that they don't accept cards.  So if u wish to go carry cash.  Or else u have to run to an atm nearest 10 min walk from the restaurant.  Overall it was pleasant experience. Loved it.

We were opting for north Indian food this time so we searched through zomato and found this place. Reviews and ratings suggested it as a very good place but personally we were very dissatisfied. No complains with food. Taste wise quite good and quantity wise sufficient. But their service is really not up to the mark. Waiters did not offer to serve the food and left it on the table for us.

Worst part is that they have no arrangements for the waiting customers. They were waiting by the side of our table staring at us while we were finishing our food. Even the staff gave us finger bowl n bill before we had finished and never bothered to ask if we needed something more.

Still if you want to try this place just for food, try out the lasuni kebab, special biriyani, masala kulcha and mixed raita. They are worth having.

I visited Punjabi rasoi with my family.
The food was great and it was nice to have something refreshing.
We had adrak ke panje which was like really soft but didn't really have any adrak flavor.
The dal makhani was awwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeesoooooommmeee. 
The naan was good. The chicken tikka masala was really nice.
The fish tikka wasn't really great.
It lacked flavor.
The phirni was ok ok.
But,the service quality was excellent and the place is worth visiting again.

A tiny Indian restaurant in the silent bylanes of a very busy area, owned by a Punjabi makes it worth a visit because the food's taste is as Punjabi and authentic dhaba(ish) North Indian. Have been licking my fingers all throughout and not wanting the food to get over. 

The restaurant though simply made doesn't feel very modern but gives a feeling of the last decade, the environment we have grown up in and seeing in our childhood and youth. 

Must visit here if you are fond dining out on Indian food..

A chance encounter with a fellow traveler gave us the incentive to try this hidden gem in the by lanes of developing Calcutta... and we're glad we found it! 
The food is always consistent and Punjabi in character, in a city where the food almost always has a Bengali touch.  This is a seriously good Punjabi joint run by a nice guy. Though the seating is not much to talk about, the food makes you forgive all else.

Recommend all that one can try here.

Punjabi Rasoi is a place for carnivore like me. I wasn't sure where the place was but with some friends waiting for me there it was quite easy to figure out where the establishment was. 
This restaurant is the only place or one of the only places that thrives on the quality of the food. The management doesn't do any publicity or pr activities cause I dont think they need it, their food is so good.

We found the restaurant to be plesantly decorated. Nothing great but nice and sweet. The waiters friendly and helpful.

We ordered for fresh lime soda and their ever so famous adrak ki punje. Followed by lehsuni murg and ajwaini mahi tikka. Along with that also placed an order for kaali daal and huge family naan to be shared between three people. The food came in pretty quick and after that we three friends just didnt have anything to say. We just kept on eating. The food was brilliant to say the least. I was abs floored by the kebabs. The adrak ki punje was almost falling off the bone....grilled abs to perfection. Next we had the ajwaini mahi tikka. Ji Pieces of bhetki with a right ajwaini flavour grilled over charcoal which added to the flavour. All along with this we were having the kaali daal with the naan. The daal was to die for. Silky and thick consistency cooked for hours and hours. The naan was also cooked in the tandoor so well that it was soft inside but had a lovely crust at places.
Coming back to the lehsuni kebab....chicken drumsticks marinated in a creamy marinade with a sharp flavour of garlic took the taste of the kebab to another level. Soft and succulent pieces of meat falling off the bone.
We loved the food so much that we ordered another round of kebabs. It was a real memorable experience. At the end when we got the bill...we were laughing all the way couldn't believe that the amount was so low. A great place for food. The owner does his rounds to ask his clients personally how hood or bad the food was. That's a great initiative on his part. Looking forward to many such meat eating evenings in the days to come :)

It was my first visit to Punjabee Rasoi with my family,but it didn't seem so. It's a small restaurant,which can house 25 people at a go. Due to the high demand,they're expanding the area. 

We were very hungry so we ordered Chicken Biriyani & chicken tikka butter masala,without giving a second thought to it. 

I must admit,it was awesome. One of the best awadhi biriyanis,i have ever had ,was at Punjabee Rasoi. The chicken tikka butter masala was well made with the spices & gravy well soaked into the chicken,it just melted in my mouth right after i took a bite of it. 
Regarding the hospitality of the staff members,they were warm,but they need to be prompt & quick. Hope to visit it again. :)

All thanks to Zomato I came across this gem of a place! I was searching for some home delivery options near my place and that's how I discovered this one. 
Have never been here but have ordered their innumerable times. Their home delivery service is extremely quick and the food sent is packed meticulously and in a neat matter. My mother loves their mushroom tikka kebab! A must try dish for any mushroom lover anywhere, for sure. 
I personally think their vegetarian options, unlike the other restaurants are not only delicious but quite extensive and varied. 
I personally love their yellow butter dal fry and jeera rice. The egg tarka is another dish which I love and goes very well with their choice of wide range of Indian rotis, garlic nun being my favourite, undoubtedly one of the best places in South Kolkata if you want to have good North Indian food. Their menu is extensive and you are spoilt silly with delicious choices. This place shouldn't be missed for sure. Highly recommended! Even if you are not a huge North Indian food fan I bet you will love their food, surprisingly non greasy this one is a must try.

Well Done Mr. Raju ! That's the Proud Owner of this absolutely Fantastic Tandoori Restaurant called " Punjabi Rasoi" ... I have been eating there for several years now and even my guests from Delhi Swear by their "Adrak ke panje" which actually is a better option then all the mutton Burrah Kababs in town ... The Dal Makhni, Tandoori Chicken Butter Massla, Lasooni Kabab, Corn Palak & the Attawala Tandoori Parathas are just toooo Good ! It is most Definitely the Best Tandoor in Town with Due respect to the Patila food elsewhere which could be better here ...@Shagun Kapoor

Tucked away into one of the side lanes of Kasba, this is hands down the best place that I've had North Indian food at. There is nothing fancy about Punjabee Rasoi: the interior is minimalistic, with seating accommodation for about 20-25 people. The food however, is a different story altogether. We had ordered butter naan and reshmi butter masala. The naans were soft and greased with butter. The aroma was enough to have us salivating. The other unique naan was the cheese garlic naan. It was simply amazing with the taste of melted cheese and garlic. The chicken reshmi butter masala was also well cooked with tender meat.
It serves great North Indian food at a reasonable price. Parking outside the restaurant is also not a problem. I hope to visit again to try out the biryanis and mutton kebab.

We ordered lasoni kebab..chicken biriani...chicken butter masala....
Each and every item was finger licking good...the aroma of the biriani will just take your breath away...
Price is also very reasonable
Service is quite good.
Interior is interestingly decorated.   
I will like to visit this place again...

Found this place thanks to Zomato.
When a place tucked away in the bylanes of kasba gets such high ratings,you know there's magic involved. For first timers and google map noobs like yours truly, the place is located in the lane between the building hosting KFC and Siemens on the Rashbehari Connector between Gariahat and Ruby. Go straight and then turn right to find this gem of a place.

We were a large group of noisy adults on a birthday treat. The staff very politely bore with us while we waited for over an hour for everyone to arrive. The owner also kept coming back with pointers and polite suggestions.Brownie points for that. 
Coming to the food, order was placed for chicken lasooni kebab,butter naan, cheese kali mirch kulcha, laccha paratha,veg pulao,jeera rice, chicken bharta, chicken reshmi butter masala,aloo dum and dal makhani.
The much talked about on zomato-chicken lasooni kebab and dal makhani did not disappoint.
Splendid flavours. The chicken reshmi butter masala in a creamy gravy was sinful to say the least. Splendid north indian flavours. 

If food is what's on your mind,go to Punjabee Rasoi. 
P.S-The portion sizes for Rice is a little less than the standard. Other than that,will definitely go back again.

Punjabee Rasoi, Might not be a hugely popular restaurant. But believe me, the food is out of the world. Located just beside the Kasba overhead water tank, the restaurant does not have the best of ambience, but the quality and taste of food is too good. the staffs are nice and cooperative. Went there as a group of 12, we ordered chicken lasooni kabab,butter naan, cheese kulcha, veg pulao, chicken bharta, chicken reshmi butter masala and dal makhani. The food was served within 10 minutes. Each and every dish was awesome but quantity can be better.

Do you like North Indian foods? 
YES.
Would you like to dive in the ocean of delicious kebabs? 
YES.
Will you go anywhere in Kolkata to have North Indian foods? 
YES.
Then this is right place to be. Maybe you have to wait for a while in the que but in the end all you will have is a belly full of delicious foods and still some money left to buy a drink or watch a movie. 

P.S. just get your directions right that will be enough. Because it is a bit confusing.

"Don't judge a book by its cover", goes the old adage, as is very applicable in this place's case. Tucked away in a quiet lane not far from the main road, Punjabee Rasoi is a must visit for all. The food is lip-smacking and easy on the pockets at the same time. I highly recommend the Kabuli Naan. Happy Eating!

Tandoori never tasted so good and light on the stomach!! The lasooni murg kabab and chicken tarka takeaways were awesome indeed. 
The guys really mean business with a heart. Hope they continue the same for years to come...

It was a cloudy day and I have planned for a lunch outside. I have completed my lunch @Punjubi Rasoi. It is a very simple restaurant but the food is really awesome. Kebabs are so different than others. I have tasted Murg Lasuni kebab which is best in its taste. It is little bit hard to find the restaurent for the first time. The only problem I have faced is with the restaurant payment mode, they are only except cash no card.

Had food here first time yesterday and I am blown away! We chose adrakhi panje ki kebab which is a melt in your mouth mutton rib kebab and chicken lasooni kebab. We were told to try it with kabuli naan- a naan packed with caramelised nuts. First time we had kebab and naan combo.Trust me..you wont need a side dish.Its that good! 

 The staff behaviour is very good too and they really care about  the customer satisfaction. First restaurant we saw where they will modify the number of kebabs in your platter to suit the number of guests you have! All restaurants should do this !

 
One of the best kebabs I have ever had..Cheers Punjabee Rasoi ! We will keep coming back for more !

Only downer: Remember to take cash as they dont accept cards :)

Caution !! Balle Balle coming through. Pujabee Rasoi located in Kasba is "THE" place to cater to your palettes if you wish to enjoy Punjabi food.Starting from the Bona fide Dal Makhni  cooked in retro Handi cooking technique to Chicken Pahari kebab and mutton Makhmalli kebab cooked over charcoal bringing out the potentiality of those meats, is what Punjabee Rasoi makes this place a stand out. This restaurant believes in cooking food in the old charcoal which most places have gotten away with due to tardiness and maintenance issues. I'm happy to see "paaji" is still very much attached to the old values of cooking meals the way they're supposed to be cooked and making people happy. Prices are a notch higher but this place has value for money. One must try the food here. It'll make your day.

Highly overrated. Service is pathetic .ordered fresh lime water but was served fresh lime soda instead.  Adrak ke panje was just just bones and very little mutton on the ribs. Not worth the price. Fish kabab was burnt on the sides. Mutton keema was bland.  Even the salad was not freshly cut.   Also the cutlery was very ordinary not to
 mention Poor quality napkins .Overall a disappointing experience.

It is very rare for a place to be so good. It is capable of making you forget every other kebab place that you may have had till now. The ambiance is simple and this place does not waste any time on the frills. Though a little hard to find the first time, the large banner they have put up on their building may serve as a good guiding light. It was a weekday afternoon, and none of the tables remained empty for long. The staff seemed to know most of the customers by face, and looked like the place has got a very stable fan club.  We were starving and went straight to business, ordering the chicken lasooni kebab, the adrak ke panje, the daal makhani, one garlic naan and one butter naan. The kebab pieces were massive, the meat melt-in-your-mouth tender and spiced perfectly. I am a soft corner for a well made daal makhani, and this one was extra special, perfectly complemented by the naans.  We were all smiles at the end of the meal and heavier by a kilo at the least.

The best indian food I have ever had. Trust me on this one that even 5 stars and local infinite stars will fail,  after you have the lip smacking food they have to offer. Just dig into those lovely kebabs and you will forget what other restaurant offer you. The spices subtle and are quite healthy. The signature dish in the modest looking restaurant is the ADRAK KE PANJE mutton kebab. Must visit.

So, I got the chance to go there when one of my friends was giving a treat... had to wait for long time to get a seat... I recommend you to book in advance if you plan to go there .... we were 8 people, so we had the opportunity to order variety of items.. mutton adrak ke punje...!! subhan Allah!! mouth melting!! I have never tasted mutton such good and such soft too.. murg(chicken) malai kabab was very good..murg khuswana kabab and lasuni kabab both were mouth melting... now in main course we had kabuli naan.. it was one of a kind!! little sweet.. peanuts spread over it.. waao..!! with dal makhani.. really good... peas polao, chicken kosha, chicken reshmi butter masala as expected these were good too!! and the best part was yet to come, that is the bill...!! cost only about 4500 rupees..

A restaurant located in the interiors of Kasba, this is the 'it' place for kebab and naan lovers. Had had dinner with family there the other day, and I must say we were more than pleased with the food. 
Although we had to wait for like around 20 minutes for the starters, it was totally worth the wait. We'd ordered the murg malai kebab, ajwani fish tikka, mutton adrak ke punje along with Kabuli naan for starters. Whereas everybody adored the mutton kebabs, I took to the murg malai kebab.
For the main course we took garlic naan, butter naan, mutton saag, another fish item and dal - the name of which I don't seem to recall now.
We were also helped to make our choices - I wanted to order biriyani but was advised against it by the man attending our table. And I was glad that I'd chosen more of kebabs and naans over rice! 
Service - very good.
Price - reasonable (good quantity).
Food - yummylicious. 
I'd strongly recommend - murg malai and ajwani fish. :D

After hearing a lot of reviews about Punjabi Rasoi, about how good it was, I planned to visit it with my family. I had great expectations from this place as it had received the Times Life Award-Best North Indian food for two consecutive years-2013 and 2014. 
On reaching the place, the ambience was just fine. 
We ordered 1 full plate Lasuni Kebab and 1 plate Ajwani Fish Tikka for starters and masala papad. 
When the food arrived, there were only 4 pieces of lasuni kebab and 4 of ajwani fish tikka The presentation was disappointing as they did nothing but just put the kebabs on the plate in a messy order. 
Still ignoring the fact that we got only 4 pieces and there was no presentation of food, we expected the taste would be brilliant, as it had received Times life award, and the place was jam packed when we went there, which would indicate that it's really good. But the taste of the lasuni kebab was just mediocre and the ajwani fish tikka was satisfactory. The masala papad was way too spicy(I'm a fan of spicy food, but this was way too spicy to handle).
Hoping that the main course would be better, we order dal makhani, chicken bharta , Garlic naan and tandoori roti. 
I liked the garlic naan, as it had a good helping of butter and garlic. The dal makhani and chicken bharta were again satisfactory, and the tandoori roti was fine. 
The quantity of dal makhani and chicken bharta was good. 
 All in all the food here was just satisfactory, and I won't exactly say it was value for money. 
When one visits the 'so called best north indian restaurant' in Kolkata, which has been awarded the same for 2 consecutive years, one has a lot of expectations. 
Sadly, Punjabi Rasoi could not meet this expectation for me.

We went to this restaurant after hearing great reviews...so here is from a veggie view....the place is all right tucked in a korner in kasba...we ordered the dal makhni. . ( average) which the place considers there favourite..but I found all right and nothing exceptional.. ...paneer  makhni..had tough time searching for the paneer as there was only 8 pieces to share btw two of us...but the highlight was the egg curry ...it was awsome and so was the masala kulcha. ...
Overall food was however good as it lacked the overall heavy mix of colours and spices one normally finds in dhaba food...so no bad feeling and burps..
Overall I would rate average ...

This restaurant is by no means an ideal place to go. The service is pathetically slow. Even though the food was good, due to the "snail-ish" service half the food was left as-it-was served. The salads were served after the meal was over. I had to literally wait for over 30 minutes for another serving of Garlic Naan. No wonder by that time all the vegetables had dried up on my plate (which is perhaps the worst thing a diner would expect).
I had brought up this issue to the manager of the restaurant (who politely listened to all my grievances). Under a (wrong) notion that things would improve I ended up ordering Vegetable Biryani (which made me wait for another 45 minutes). Ultimately I had to walk off the restaurant by handing over cash to the waiter to adjust against the Bill (because I could see people at nearby tables waiting for their Bills for well over 30 minutes).
With no sign of regret on their face, they accepted the money only to hand me over an incorrect Bill and a finger bowl of cold water.
If Zomato had a negative scale of rating I would have given this place a negative five for such an amazing experience.

Probably the only restaurant ever, that I will rate 5/5. Ambiance, treatment, pricing, quality of food.. one triumphs the other. The best part is, owner takes in keen interest in operations, including shopping for the ingredients (fish/meat), and then whenever I have been, I have seen him individually attending the tables, to suggest best dishes and collect feedback. I have introduced at least 10-15 new customers (my friends), to Punjabee Rasoi, and almost each of them have gone back there again, sometimes with family as well. With the expanded 1st floor, it is now bigger and better! Whenever I am in Kolkata, I visit PR. One of my closest friends introduced me to this place, but sadly, she passed away in March 2015. She absolutely loved Punjabee Rasoi. I will miss her even more, whenever I go to this wonderful place to eat!

If you are really looking for a good Punjabi food then you got to visit this place which has gained a lot of popularity due to its delicious food.
Mutton Adrake is one of its best dishes....definitely u can try murgh malai kababs,chicken lasuni..but u cannot miss mutton adrake and fish tikka...
I have been visiting this place since its inception and i could never complain about  the taste of food.
Punjabi Rasoi will never compromise with the quality of food...just go and enjoy the food....

Would definitely recommend this place for people who like north indian delicacies'. The place is a bit difficult to find and parking is limited, but the staff is exceptionally cordial and the food more than makes it up for it. I expected to have the dish called adrak-ki-punja but unfortunately it was finished due to heavy rush. I was asked to call up and reserve a plate on my next visit, which I definitely would. Nevertheless the mutton makhmali was really soft and delicious and I suspect its some kind of close cousin of gelawati kabab. We ordered kadai paneer and chicken bharta. The bharta was good but I personally prefer shredded chicken in bharta compared to the granular variety. The kadai paneer was tasty too though the gravy could have been a bit thicker. On the whole its worth going back as the restaurant has lot of other dishes  which I expect would be equally tasty.

I have been to Punjabi rasoi many many times. 
Although we have a fixed menu of what to eat there, the food that comes is still awesome.
I could go as far to call it the best standalone north Indian food joint in Kolkata.
Our fixed menu includes chicken lasuni, mutton adrak ke panke as the starters. Usually we fill up on these 2 items since they are awesome.
Sometimes we are suggested new items which we try and like but all the other items are overshadowed by the giants Chicken Lasuni and Mutton Adrak Ke Panje.
But we never leave without the dal makhni and kabuli naan. Perhaps the best dal makhni in the city. The kabuli naan is also too good. It doubles up as a dessert most of the time.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF U LOVE FOOD AS MUCH AS I DO.

A gem of a North Indian restaurant. They have won Times Best North Indian restaurant award for both 2013 and 2014. Located a bit inside from the main road in Kasba.
I had ordered  Mutton Adraki Panja, Murg Lehsuni kebab and Fish Tikka and all of them were excellent. Special mention for the Mutton one. It was just out of the world :)
Then in main course had Pudina Naan, Dal Makhani and Chicken Bhurta and once again all were very good. Ambiance quite normal nothing much to mention. Service also good and quick. A definite visit for all foodies.

First of all I would like to thank Zomato for letting me discover this amazing place. I wanted to have North Indian food with reasonable price. And this is the place to be. The food is simply awesome. You may not find the decoration fancy but their food will do the talk. You must have Chicken  Lasoni Kebab and Mutton Adrak ke Punje. Both ate so soft and very very tasty. Perhaps one of the finest Kebab with reasonable price. The Manager suggested me to try their Dal Makhani. But I was so full that could not try it out. I will definitely visit again to have other items. Staffs are Ok. Thumbs up for Punajbee Rasoi. Keep up the good work.

Been here so many times previously, but first time writing a review about it though. This place is small and ambiance is good, with comfortable sitting arrangements. Service is okay, not so great.  Me and my friends always come here to eat Kebabs, which are simply awesome, the best one is their Mutton Kebab, which is soft, tender and taste amazing, and fresh too. Vegetable curries are okay, It is not so amazing compare to kebabs. I didn't get much impressed by there Daal Tadhka, Mixed veg and Palak Paneer as compared to get impressed by their non-veg curries. I will say, this restaurant is perfect for non-veg foods. Loved their Kabli Naan, which are always amazing and their Masala drink.  Over all this is the perfect restaurant for people who love to eat non-veg food. My rating is 4 for Pungabee Rasoi.

Seating is quite limited here but great great great food.

Their Ajwani fish tikka Masala is very Tasty, so is their Garlic.

But have you ever felt not heavy after eating at a pujabi restaurant? here you will feel happy and healthy.

This restaurant focuses more on great taste and fresh ingredients rather than saturated fats.

Quite pocket friendly and clean atmosphere. 
Please try this place out.

If u crave for good food, especially Kebabs, then u must visit "Punjabi Rasoi" (behind Geetanjali Stadium, Kasba) at least once a month.. No, seriously.. I mean it.. What u have to do it is to pay a little bit extra bucks (cost for 2 persons comes around 700-800 INR) but m sure u would love to pay it for such a good food, ambience and the treatment that makes u feel like home. smile emoticon

 So do drop in there and write down ur own experience instead of reading mine. And if ur pocket isnt in a good condition, not an issue.. Just get a foodie sponsor (as i've managed) and keep pleasing ur tongue and stomach uninterruptedly! tongue emoticon wink emoticon devil emoticon

Mutton Adraki Panja & Murg Lehsuni kebabs had creamy mild flavour and were super succulent. Hyderabadi Mutton Biriyani (Special) was also good but one cannot compare it with the orginal Hyd Biriyani. Chicken Tikka Butter Masala was creamy rich and very tasty. Kabuli Naan was ok kind of.  All those with sweet tooth can actually  gorge on a small portion of Firni after the bigtime pet pooja.  Service is Excellent... I am surely gonna visit this place with my family in a short while.

Quite a nice place to have your dal and naan. Simple but authentic. The north indian food out here is tasty and delightfully spicy. Was surprised to see packed house even on a dull Wednesday.  The owner takes care of his customers quite well. Take my word and go for it. You won't regret.

Let me put this first..... Punjabee Rasoi is the best tasted North Indian cuisine I have had in Kolkata in the recent future. Each and every food speaks for itself, though I would specially like to mention Mutton Adrak ke Punje and Murgh Khushnuwa Kabab, as they are the best mutton and chicken kababs respectively I have ever had. 
However I have rated the restaurant as 4.5 instead of 5 only for the fact that any sort of card payments are not accepted which is kind of a disadvantage for a restaurant, where price is (you can say) is not very less ! 
But for foodies or connoisseurs of delicacies, I would urge you to visit the place once, and you would feel that it's not about ambience, location or any sort of thing, but it's purely for the ecstatic food, which makes it different !

Having read the reviews I went to this restaurant with high hopes. Being a vegetarian, I ordered a kadhai paneer, butter naan and garlic naan. I wasn't very impressed with the taste of the kadhai paneer. Although the naans were quite good. Renowned mostly for its non vegetarian items, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for Veg food. Cost was also quite high compared to the quality of the food that was served. Wouldn't visit again.

They make one of the best Mutton kebabs in town. That's the signature dish. 
All other dishes taste really well. The seating and decor has room for improvement. But a must visit joint. Good choice for family meet ups.

Very impressive north Indian cuisine. Mutton adrak de punje(the best mutton ever) and Murg lasuni kebab is a must try. Kabuli nun compliments the mutton really well! For the main course the Dal Makhni is a real treat along with other varieties of nun. Even the fresh lime soda is worth a try!
PS: Credit/debit card not accepted! Only cash (as of 24/1/2015)

This is an amazing place for take-away. Even though KFC is located right in front of it, the allure of the Mutton Adrak ke Panje is such, it pulls us away from the heady fried chicken smell of KFC. EACH TIME. 

This is one of those amazing tiny food joints that never go out of style or demand, because they are just that good. Don't go looking for decor or ambience because you won't find any. It's quite clean though. What matters is the kebabs. Rest assured, they will leave you licking your fingers.

Must tries:
1. Mutton Adrak ke Panje (Blissful, with a light overplay of ginger)
2. Murg Lasuni Kebab (Creamy, garlic flavoured, soft chicken)
3. Fish Tikka Butter Masala (Maybe you'll find a better version of this, but something about the flaky white soft fish in that fragrant sauce from this place..*sigh*) OR the Ajwaini Fish Tikka 

This place is hallowed for the juicy-soft, flavorful lightly charred kebabs. 

However their Cheese Garlic Naan is pretty good.

4.0 because their excellence in the kebabs, doesn't QUITE spread to the other items on the menu. 4.0 entirely for the kebabs, especially the 2 I've mentioned. And the prices are quite cheap too, considering the flavour. Thumbs-up!

My friend found this place via Zomato. When he told me about this place I was like "what? I live near to that place but I never heard about it. I don't think it will be that good". Soon I found that I was soo wrong. The food was yummy. They are very conscious about the food quality and hygiene. I visit the place now & then. If you are a foodie then you must visit here because all the dishes are worth having.

Punjabee Rasoi - A dine in restaurant serving smoky hot food. 
======
Location & Intro: 

It is not very difficult to locate at all. It is located right behind the KFC building. Take first left from the crossing after KFC(If coming from gariahat side) and ask anyone, the white building is the punjabee rasoi if you move a bit forward. I was looking forward to try this place as a lot of my foodie friends had reviewed this place real good. I had been there with one of my friend and i was really impressed with the minimalistic decors and courteous staffs happy enough to serve you. 
======
Beverages, Food and Dessert: 

1) Sweet Lime soda - The soda was really bubbly. Nice drink to sip up with food. However, sadly there were no more beverages available here. 

2) Chicken Lasuni Kebab - It was with bone kebab. The bone was just to hold up the boneless chunks of chicken. Served extremely hot. Very succulent and mouth melting. It was served with Green Chutney and Loads of Onions. I wanted to try the Chicken Khusnawa kebab but sadly it was unavailable. #musttry

3) Chicken Tikka Butter Masala - It was served smoky hot. Red gravy with extra cream and butter. #musttry

4) Dal Tadka - Sadly, the dal tadka disappointed me real bad. It had too much of garlic and oil. The oil was dripping too much. Had there been less oil, the dal would have tasted much much better. 

5) Tandoori Roti - It tasted the usual. It was fine.

6) Garlic Naan - #musttry. It is really good. 

7) Firni - As there were no other desserts, we ordered a firni. It was good but not the best. I had have much better too. 
======
Pros:

1) Serves smoky hot food.
2) Courteous staffs.
3) Prompt service.
4) A la carte is easy to understand.
5) Lasuni Kebab was unique. Not had like this anywhere before. 
6) Good quantity with respect to the price charged. 
7) Simplistic ambience. 

Cons:
1) Some items on the menu were unavailable.
2) The menu calls for more desserts and beverages. 
======
Meal for two: 750-1200 approximately
======
Summary: 
Food quality 4.3/5
Food quantity 4.3/5
Taste 4.2/5
Hygiene 3.9/5
Value for money 4/5
Ambience 3.8/5
Hospitality 3.8/5
======
Conclusion:
I would surely recommend this and visit this place again in the near future. Really good food served smoky hot at a moderate speed. :)

Note: 1) This is an Unbiased review based on my dining experience.
2) Pictures to be attached shortly

Excellent mutton chops or as given in the menu - mutton adrak ke punje. Soft, well marinated and easily the best item on the menu card. A close second is the kabuli naan which was very different from the other ' mainstream ' naans. Very courteous manager and hope this place expands soon to other locations in India

If i am not a zomato user i would never know about this place. Located near the gitanjali stadium in kasba it's not so familiar to a outsider. After getting its name and ratings from here we went there today. It was a small restro with ordinary decor but quite peaceful. We have ordered chicken reshmi kebab, butter nun, laccha paratha and chicken tandoori butter masala. They tasted good, specially the tandoori butter masala was awesome. Servings was also good. Recommended for a budget meal..

This is a hidden gem for sure. Tucked away from busy Kasba connecter, it is situated in a peaceful and serene neighborhood. The decor is pleasing, nothing over the top.

Food is  AWESOME !!  Lasuni Kabab and Adrak Ke Panje was superlative. Adrak Ke Panje was one of the best Indian starter I ever had. Even the side dishes in the main-course was well made. We were 4 and the bill was just Rs 1800. I would say it is quite value for money.

Keep it up.....

Went for dinner on 10th December in a group of 12 people. Whatever we ordered was just amazing barring couple of items. From Dal makahni, Kofta their signature Palak corn, Garlic naan, Crispy tandoori roti and starters like Tandoori paneer tikka and Tandoori mushroom, all were fantastic. Tandoori aloo was a big let down and biryani was just ok. Starter quantity should have been better especially Tandoori paneer.

I am being a lover of north Indian foods.. have visited this place twice.. Both times I am pleased with kababs.. specially Murg khuswana kabab(must order), lasoni murg, malai kabab.. kababs r so soft and tasty..
In biriyani both motton and chicken are soft and they come with a big potato, which is must for Bengali biriyani.. but, I am little bit disappointed with the hydrabadi biriyani and firbi.. Kabuli nan and chicken reshmi butter masala were good too... this place is a must visit for mughlai khana lovers.. and it is cost friendly too..

Starting off with the ambiance, Panjabee Rasoi is a cozy little establishment with minimal albeit tastefully done interiors. For anybody familiar with Punjabi Cuisine which is a delightful assault on the senses with all it's spices and gravy, one would realize that decor plays little role on the culinary experience. It is only about the food. And nothing else.                                      
                                          So coming straightaway to the food, for starters we ordered Mutton Makhmali Kebab which actually lived up to it's name. The meat was juicy, tender and grilled to perfection. Served generously with chopped onions and lime one would only wish for a dollop of green chutney to go with it. Otherwise it was perfect. 
                                        The main course consisted of stuffed Kulchas, a plate of Mutton Keema Masala and a plate of Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. The Kulchas were delicious and quite filling. The Mutton however, wasn't satisfactory. It was spicy but lacked character. So much so that I found it hard to distinguish it's flavor from that of the Kulcha stuffing. 
                                           The Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, however was perfect. The gravy was just right, with just the right amount of butter and sweetness which complemented the grilled chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly and it literally melted in the mouth.
                                              The service was decent. However, I didn't like the way water was served in used mineral water bottles. A jug would have been better. Coming to the pricing, the kebabs were slightly expensive quantity wise but still worth it. Overall speaking if you want authentic Punjabi food without having to visit your nearest highway dhaba then this is the place for you.

P.S- They do not accept cards. Make sure you have adequate cash.

We were looking for a good North Indian restaurant in Kolkata. Depending upon the reviews in Zomato, we decided to try Punjabee Rasoi in Kasba. We didn't have an exact idea about its location. It wasn't even specified in Google Maps. We got off at Gitanjali Stadium and wandered for about half hour to locate the restaurant. It seemed that it was developed in a residential building. The interior was simple, yet pleasant. We heard quite a lot about their Chicken Lasooni Kabab. It was definitely a lot more than what we heard of.  The starter gave signs of an amazing dinner ahead. We ordered Chicken Kadhai, Chicken Bharta, Dal Makhani, and Naan for the main course. All of the dishes, interior, and the ambience are interwoven into a single theme- simplicity and pleasant. The service was good. On returning home, the first thing I did was to specify Punjabee Rasoi in Google Maps. Food: 4/5  Service: 4.5/5  Location: 3/5  Ambience: 3.5/5  Value for money: 4/5  Overall: 4/5   Why?*Food   Why not?*Location     Must Try: Chicken Lasoon Kabab

Punjabee Rasoi has become a part of our weekend dinner, may be its close to my place and also the items are irresistable :-). Won't spend much word here - Must eats are the kebabs they have - especially Adrak ke Panje and Murg Lasooni are must. 

One best part is that they tailor the order as per your need and it seems they also offer a mixed kebab platter, if you have dinner at their outlet, but for home delivery the staffs are very helpful to tailor the food quantity as per your requirement. 

The Nans and Kulchas are simply too good and the price are also reasonable. Take my advice and enjoy a evening at their outlet - you won't be disheartened.

Tha raving reviews of Punjabee rasoi urged me to try the place and luckily the place is located near my place so one day i decided to give it a try. Since i was craving biryaani I ordered their chicken biryaani, mutton hyderabaadi biryaani and mutton adrak ke punje. 

I ordered in so i have no clue about the ambiance of the place but one thing i know is their hyderabadi biryaani was the wrost i have ever had. It was burnt . Even the onions were so badly done that they tasted bitter. I am assuming their gravy items are good but if you want to try biryaani i suggest you stay away from this one. Their Chicken biryaani was just ok. Yes the chicken biryaani was much better than their hyderabaadi biryaani for sure. Total waste of money on that one to be honest.  However their adrak ke punje was really yum and different. The pieces were humongous i must say and taste was delectable.

Reserving my thoughts on their other items till i try them. So far just OK.

It is a place you will have to really look for to find.
number of seats very few.....you will actually be disheartened when you reach the place.
The ambiance is warm, the owner greets you with a smile.

Then comes the food. I have never been able to go past starters. The Kababs are so succulent and awesome that one would keep wanting more.
And then you will make sure you will never forget the place and keep coming. Or better still keeping ordering for Home Deliveries.

Very pleasant food!

Very seldom do you come across a restaurant where everything that you ate makes you crave for more. Each and every item is impeccable. Panjabee rasoi is one such place. In fact it is a god send for food lovers. It has the kind of food that calcutta is recognised for. 

I can go on & on about this place but lets finish the review first.

Location: pretty easy to locate, just take the first left after KFC and then another left voila! 

Ambience:  It has decent contemporary interiors, neat and clean. Anyways thats not what this place is about. Its about food, food and only food.

They do not have soup on the menu. 

Starters: 

1. Mushroom tikka: Well cooked, succulent, big, round, marinated  mushrooms. A must try. 

2. Bharwan Alu gilafi- Big barrels of potato scooped in the centre & stuffed . Covered in aluminium foil. 

3. Tandoori Gobi -  In its truest sense, tandoori gobi. You get the smoked  taste of charcoal in every bite while maintaining the actual taste of gobi. 

Main Course:

1.	Kadai Paneer: Not the typical kadai paneer, had good gravy in it with lots of ground black pepper and other spices. They can increase the quantity of paneer pieces though.

2.	Corn Palak- Again very well made, corn kernels in well cooked palak gravy.

3.	Maa ki Daal: Made the way it is meant to be. 

Breads:  Cheese kali mirch kulcha ( a must try), masala kulcha, garlic naan and tandoori  roti.  No complaints at all.

Desserts: They only have phirni, not very fond of it but it was pretty decent. 

Conclusion:  By the end of our meal we all were so full and satiated, yet licking our fingers and plates.

We must have filled every nook and cranny of our stomach with food. It was so divine.  So if you really want to enjoy some really delicious food which is not too oily and greasy then this is the place to go. 

I have been there once only so far, but definitely plan to make regular visits. Whoever is the owner I must say you are doing an outstanding job and hope you continue doing so.

Complaints:  none.

Suggestions: Please incorporate more desserts in the menu.

Alternatives:  uuhhmmm…Not  really, Maybe second house.

I had had food from here quite a number of times. This was the first time i had food sitting there. Nice decor on the 1st floor. 
The food quality is excellent and similar to earlier times, i was very happy with the food quality.
The only point that can make it a little better is to serve the food a little faster. It takes too long a time, considering it not to be a fine dining.
Having said that the food is excellent specially the adrak ke paanje...i will keep on visiting.
Thanks

Went there on zomato's recommendations. found the wait in spite of pujo to be absolutely mouth-wateringly worthwhile. the murgh lehsuni kabab, fish ajwain tikka as starters surpassed themselves. the butter naan, punjabi aloo dum (a must try) and chicken reshmi butter masala were a hit. pleasing to all with not too spicy or sweet flavours, this place definitely adds to my haunts for north Indian food.

My first review ever goes out to Punjabee Rasoi, because these guys were able to deliver a near perfect meal yesterday on the occasion of Maha Ashtami. 

The place won't impress you at the first glance, neither is the interior decor something to go gaga for; the restaurant manager himself plays a huge role to ensure that you leave with you heart and stomach satiated. 

Mr. Raju takes you through the best items on his menu personally and in our case he customised our entire order because we were new to the place. We started with Mutton Adrak ke Punje, the mutton was sumptuous and instantly melts in your mouth. After experiencing the Kebabs at Karim's, Delhi I never thought I would eat something as divine as that in Kolkata but I was left pleasantly surprised. 

Next arrived the Chicken Lasuni Kebab and Fish Ajwain Tikka, by now the sheer aroma and texture of these dishes had completely overpowered me. When you combine these Kebabs with their Kabuli Naan you end up getting a perfect combo; filled with nuts and with a touch of butter the Kabuli Naan simply wows your senses.

The manager made sure that we ordered their Dal Makhani which he claimed is cooked overnight and is one of their signature dishes. I personally am a big fan of Dal Bukhara, served at Peshawri, ITC Sonar Bangla and an instant sense of comparison came into the picture. 

The Dal truly delivered to it's promise, rich aroma and a perfect buttery texture; combined with Chicken Biryani you arrive at another perfect combo. 

I thanked the manager umpteen number of times for helping us out with the order and making our experience so memorable. The total bill value of just Rs 1500 was the icing on the cake, there were 4 of us and we were extremely hungry, this in itself speaks volumes about their value for money. 

All in all a divine experience, I am going there tomorrow as well :)

Went there after reading loads of fantastic reviews on Zomato. N it surely was a LIP SMACKING EXPERIENCE.

We had already pre-planned to have the signature dishes. So when it came to ordering we promptly ordered Chicken lasooni Kebab n Muttom adrak ke panje.
Me not being very fond of mutton did not like the adrak ke paje much. still it was good. But OMG the lasoonu kebab!!!!! it was even better thean what i had expected it to be. Simply mouthwatering.

For the main course we had ordered kabuli naan n garlic bread. there were 4 of u but 2 kabuli naans n 1 garlic bread were more than enough for us. N both were equally good. Cant compare between the two. The side dishes we ordered were Palak corn n Murg tikka butter masala.What i just loved about this place is  that the are equally adept at preparing veg dishes and non veg dishes. Palak corn was nice. N as for the tikka butter masala there is nothing i can say about it. It was really very very delicious.N this place is really cheap.

Would love to revisit to try out other dishes. Expecting a lot from them. A 4.5 for that off location.

After reading so much about this restaurant, we finally made it! Even though it took us an extra two minutes to find it, it was easier with help from all the people who've submitted reviews. The food was really really good! Lived up to all its popularity. Really worth it. The only thing i would've really liked is greater quality in my chicken dish and for it to be boneless. This was reason why Punjabee Rasoi didn't get full marks from me. My current fav for North Indian food :D 
PS- Their naan is amazing!! The best I've ever had- so soft and flaky! :3

Well Trust  Google maps and I tool 3.5 years to find this place (figuratively).... actually its very easy to find. Its right behind KFC near Siemens in kasba  

Well Coming to the place even Whne you are around it its very diffiut to say that something this brilliant awaits you inside . I've been there twice and ordered a take away once and i have never been disappointed. Be it veg or nonveg food here tastes truly punjabi and not mughlai with butter and kasoori methi . 

The minute you enter the place the smoky fragrance of the tandoor will just leave you smitten . The place is very humble in decor and in one of my visits I also had the opportunity to speak to the owner . They are very humble and down to earth people who are loyal to their work and believe in serving good quality food . 

The star of this place has to be the lehsuni chicken which just drove me insane . Even the adrak ke panje , WOW ! the quality of the meat they use is one of the best I have tasted in the city . 

They even make amazing fish ajwaini tikka, One must not forget the paneer tikka and the tandoori gobhi . The foil wrapped stuffed tandoori aloos are also simple delicious . Although I am not much of a vegetarian but the Daal makhani and the kabuli naan are to die for . Just kebabs, daal and naan are enough for me. 

But since I come from a vegetarian family I have to mention that my family loves the food here, and the vegetarian food is as good as the non-veg, especially the malai kofta 

Simple and honest Food always makes people happy...  As is the case here 

KUDOS!!!!

Serves the best north indian food in Calcutta. PERIOD.
The accomodation is small and even the ambience is not very remarkable. But the food is absolutely top notch. Their best dishes are Lasuni Kabab, Dal Makhani and Kabuli Naan. It is really very appealing to your taste buds. The service is fast and is presented well. The staff are courteous. Well, in short- This is the place in Kolkata to go to if you want to have North Indian food.

Visited this restuarant couple of weeks back on a Saturday night ........ had some problem in finding it in the first place ...... not situated on the main road(connecting ruby with gariahat) in kasba, but in a alley next to KFC ,then 2nd left turn .....infact on reaching the restuarant , we couldn't find the name .... :) ...the name was partially obstructed from view by distractions ,and also no proper light was there to at least light the name ........ 
Ambience is ok ....... waiters were quite friendly ...... one of them showed more interest in serving us well on knowing that we have come from far to taste their cuisine after finding them out in zomato ...... :)
Coming to food, we ordered what they are known for .......Adrak ke Punje and Murgh Lasooni in starters ...... both werereally good in taste ...... the mutton pieces were really soft .....we liked it so much that we reordered the same dishes again :) ...... in main course we ordered biriyani .....its nothing great ,infact i didn't like that much ....... mutton roganjosh and chicken butter masala was so-so ...... kabuli naan was sweet in taste ..... i liked it ....... 
Prices are standard i would say ...maybe slightly on the higher side if u consider for main course dishes and side dishes, but for starter items, considering the quality that they serve, its worth it i would say .......

Had dinner at punjabee rasoi on a strong recommendation by a friend, tucked in a big lane behind Acropolis, no frills place, cramps, smokes from the kitchen made eyes teary, but proves dat tis' the restaurant tat maketh the restaurant.
Kebabs were delicious. A must try for all kebab lovers.
Tandoori aloo and tandoori gobi were insane.

Currently it should be counted among the leading kebab junctions in Kolkata. their kebabs are just more than awesome. the ambience is soso, a bit crowdy and not too spacious. even at a time, i don't think they will be able to accomodate more than 30 - 35 pax. their stuffs are very good, almost 2-3 stuffs regularly visited our table to take the feedback. even there are some kabab items which are not available in their menucard, like mutton suneheri or rojanjosh etc. but they will prepare those according to your choice and they will suggest those also. 

Regarding food, we have tried mutton adrak ke punje, chicken lasuni kabab in starter along with mutton biriyani, kabuli naan, chicken tikka butter masala, mutton roganjosh in main course. the kababs were very good, mainly adrak ke punje, their signature dish. even we were so impressed that we ordered it one more plate during the main course. the biriyani was ok, not typical kolkata biriyani, rather quite less spicy and was a bit sweet on that day. the sidedishes were quite good to have and quantity was also not bad. 

during the visit, i found following odds:
1. the location - it's really tough to locate it if you are not familiar with that area. to make it simple, i m noting down the route. in kasba, reach to gitanjali stadium. take the road just left to it. go straight and take second left, a very narrow lane. 
2. they do not accept cards. my request to them is please start accepting cards, else sometimes it becomes difficult to carry all the cash.
3. they should add all of their special kababs in the menucard. it will be easier for the customer to give order even in the crowded circumstances also.
though there are few odds as i mentioned, but still i will highly recommend this place to everyone to have the kababs mainly, i am also planning for it again shortly...

When you reach the place it's so unassuming but when you start eating the food is awesome. The Mutton Adraki, Chicken Lasuni and the Kabuli nan is lip smacking. Have been to the place numerous times and the standard has been the same throughout. The staff and the owner Raju is extremely hospitable. Must go place if you like kebabs

I had a lot of difficulty finding this place because its hidden away in a corner but once I tasted the food I had no qualms about it. I ordered their Cheese Garlic Naan and found it to be absolutely lip smacking! It was cheesy and had bits of garlic in every bite. The Dal Makhani was clearly the star of the evening! It was creamy and well seasoned and the best I have had till now in Kolkata. I did wish that they served Rumali Roti here so I could enjoy the dal makhani with it. The Tandoori Roti they served was soft and a good accompaniment. I also ordered the Murgh Lasuni Kebab and Mutton Adrak ke Punje. The kebab had a very good smell and taste of garlic and was light on the palette. The Mutton Adrak ke Punje had a very good flavour of garlic and there was a lot of meat on the bone. The service was a bit slow but the staff was amicable.

Recently I went back for a visit. Since the restaurant was a bit packed I had to wait a while for a seat but the food was worth it. I tasted their Chicken Reshmi Kebab along with the Chicken Lasuni Kebab which I had tried previously. The Reshmi Kebab was adequately seasoned and flavourful. The Dal Makhani this time didn't impress me as much as it had on my last visit but it was quite tasty nonetheless. This time around I tried the Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Chicken Bharta with Plain Naan. The Reshmi Butter Masala had a well rounded taste and was quite delicious but the Chicken Bharta was lipsmackingly delicious. It was packed with flavours and had a very refreshing taste. Sweet Lime Soda helped me wash down the delicious food.

This time tried Kushnawa Kebab. As the name suggests bound to make one happy. Stuffed kebab cooked to perfection in tandoor. Rating updated to 4 out of 5.
------------------------
This morning when I woke up still fonder the taste of Mughlai dishes we tasted last evening at Punjabee Rasoi. Located at off-beat route behind KFC is difficult to find unless you are aware of the route in advance.
We started with Laasoni Murg Kebab and Mutton Adrak Ki Punj. The later makes an amazing combo with Kabuli Naan. Both chicken and mutton were so soft that falling apart from the bone and melts inside your mouth.
In main course we went for Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Butter Masala. Again the butter masala can't be better than this and will recommend the same over tikka masala. Either of them again makes an amazing partnership with Cheese Garlic Naan. They goofed-up by serving us Garlic Naan instead of Cheese Garlic Naan. Value and taste wise its in top of the chart in Kolkata for me. Bill was just around INR 1325 for 4 of us. We also sampled their Dal Makhani which was so creamy. Another speciality from them us highly recommended.
Now when we visit a restaurant along with food we prefer to have basic ambiance and certain comfort level. Here ambiance is very very basic and in peak hours it becomes stuffy as the air-condition is not that effective. Be prepare to wait at least 30mins or so. Management should look at comfort level of guests when they are gradually becoming household name. Was very uncomfortable for us. They have a plan to expand another floor in September.
Home delivery option is there but not recommend by hotel owner himself as all these dishes taste better straight out of their kitchen.

Note: We missed Kushnawa kebab as it was sold out due to high demand.

Who would have thought that a restaurant tucked in an obscure corner of Rajdanga , Kasba would serve such high quality food !

I took my family of four to punjabee rasoi and was pleasantly surprised with the authentic and tasty flavour of the food.

We I did not experiment much with the menu and ordered a chicken biryani , 3 butter nans , a tandoori chicken and a chicken bharta.

The tandorri chicken was roasted almost perfect with spices getting into layers of chicken meat.

I was delighted with the biryani , not reeking of dalda and a set of crispy nans.

Would definitely come here again !

Small place tucked away behind KFC at Rajdanga but worth the effort as the food is excellent and affordable. The jeera aloo is different and good. The kaali daal is very well done. 5* standard. We liked their biryani too. The service takes a while but the staff are polite and friendly.

I recently again went to this place. It has been renovated and looks so much cleaner and better now. Lasuni kebab is always my preference for starters. And they make is exceptionally well. The mushroom tikka and paneer tikka are really tasty. For main course we had the kadai paneer, Mutton keema, palak corn and matar mushroom.. I think this is the best choice for North Indian when it comes to the kasba area. 


***********************************

This place is just 5 mins away from my house. A very small restaurant which is not near the main road. You have to enter the prantik pally lane, rajdhanga, the way to Garden High School, and keep an eye on the left. You will see a yellow hoarding with punjabee rasoi written on it.
It might look small, but dont go by the appearance of it. It has one of the nicest mughal food in south kolkata.
There spaciality is their lasooni kebab. JUST CHURANTO!
Biriyani, mutton keema, roti are the dishes we order generally when we go there.
The price is also very reasonable.

Punjabee Rasoi is a nice little North Indian cuisine joint located in Kasba. Was hearing a lot about this place so decided to order from here just on a random odd day.

The food is quite good, starting with some nice and juicy Murg Malai Kebabs, they really tasty and fairly quantitative however may be just a little too sweet to the tongue. Next up is nice Mutton Biryani with a single piece of very juicy and soft mutton, the biryani comes with a large piece of aloo (potato) too. The gravy item or the Murg Reshmi Butter Masala is equally good with some large pieces of chicken.

Price is descent for the quantity you get which is stomach filling. Service is quite good however the home delivery time is a bit of concern as delivery time to a place within 2km range is 1.5hrs, however they told beforehand that the delivery will take some time because of too many orders.

So, overall not a bad choice of North Indian food and if you want some, it is surely recommended,

Nothing more to add to whatever beautiful things are written here... been here a couple of times and expect to go back time and again whenever I have the urge to gorge on the BEST Punjabi food in town, the unique and the softest feel of mutton (Adrak Ke Punje) , the beautiful taste of garlic on tandoori chicken tangdi (Murgh Lasooni) or the softest Naan with a difference (Cheese Garlic Naan) !!!Nothing new to say... just GO if u haven't... You are missing out on an integral part of modern Kolkata cuisine

Punjabee Rasoi = Adrak ke Punjee & Murg LasuniThe best Adrak ke Punjee & Murg Lasuni you can taste in Kolkata. Succulent pieces of Mutton & Chicken, well marinated and even better cooked to perfection. Cuts like a knife on butter. Tastes heavenly too.Well, everything on their menu is good. The quality is great.Apart from Adrak ke Punjee & Murg Lasuni, we loved the Mahi Tikka (Bombay Betki).  We also ordered Pulao, Biryani, Naan and Veg Jhal Frezi and needless to say, everything was great. The pricing is EXCELLENT !!We keep going back often.

I heard about this restaurant from one of my friend and wanted to taste the mouth-watering Punjabi cuisine. So, I decided to call them & order for home delivery. I ordered Mutton Adrak ke Punje (I pick this because the name is very interesting) & Hydrabadi Mutton Biriyani. Within 1 hour I received the parcel. Adrak ke Punje was damn good, yummy, very soft. It is basically a Tandoori dish. You can have it as a starter. The Biriyani was Okay (Not as good as Arselan or Amenia).

Can't tell you about the ambiance as I didn't visit this place (ordered for home delivery). But I have heard that, this place is basically very crowed at weekends.

This review will be purely on the food. I have not been at the restaurant, but have ordered for home deliveries quite a few times. The first word that came to my mind when I tasted the Kadai Veg was " Authentic", this was indeed the sui generis taste that pujnabi food has. The veggies were absolutely fresh(a thing mostly ignored now a days)  and had that distinctive crunch which comes with it. The gravy was great and the veggies being fresh added the most finest of flavours in the sabzi. The tandoori chicken which I had only once was great as well, the chicken inside was not dry and the outside was grilled well, which is my yardstick for judging a tandoori besides the usual taste distribution. The Nans and Rotis were well cooked, I did not find any soft flour spots hence the tandoor was done well. This place is on my wishlist for a restaurant experience, but food-wise I am more than impressed. 

I will recommend this place for quenching the craving for some "chagde Phatte" food ! A shout-out to to the Zomato Ads, found this place with the help of it., usually do not trust the paid Ad section, but I guess this one was meant to be ! :)

Nestled in a quiet Kasba neighborhood, this north Indian food joint is a sheer delight for all the gourmand around. At first sight, I thought they should be fortunate enough for the allegiance of Zomato and their ever enthusiastic reviewers, for their location is not so good for a new restaurant to bloom. But after a decent lunch, I had to accept they thoroughly deserve all the accolades and rewards they have won over the recent years.  
Let's talk about the different aspects of this place :-
Decor :-
----------
This does not have much to write about.  For a moment we thought , we have trespassed into someone's dining hall and having lunch there, their interior is that simple.
Its 3.5/5 from me. 
Staffs :--
---------
Staffs were cordial and co-operative. Nothing to complain about. 
A 4/5 from me.

Food :-
---------
Now come the into that what matters most. In a word, their food is finger licking good. We had Murg Lasuni kebab as the starter. The tender juicy succulent chicken pieces just melted in our mouth. Then came the Kabuli Nun and Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala. The soft kabuli nun with right amount of cheese and nuts toppings tasted heavenly. That with the thick gravy of Tandoori Butter masala was a treat to our taste buds. 
A straight 5/5 from me. 

Price :-
--------
The reasonable pricing will not burn a hole in your pocket. All the dishes are reasonably priced given their quantity and taste.
4/5 undoubtedly.

Cons :-
---------
Now comes the bitter pill which they have to swallow. 
1)First thing is that they provide a pre-filled Kinley Bottle, if one asks for regular water. That looks cheap to say the least.
2) A little more investment in cutlery and crockery is needed.
3) They are not accepting any type of cards for the time being(don't know the reason), that may land in you in a spot of bother if you do not have ready cash with you. 
 I think the management will make a note of this and rectify them as this restaurant has all the potential to rule the charts of fine north Indian restaurants for many more years to come.

After reading some fantastic reviews of this place, we finally decided to order from here. We had a very high expectation and to be very honest we were not dissapointed at all!
The person over the phone who was taking the order was very helpful and polite.
The food was excellent.

Food we ordered :-
1) Adrak ke punje (Rs.240/plate) : 3 big pieces of mutton (Rib cage portion) marinated with some amazing gingery marinade which was just a true delight to our taste buds. The mutton was as soft as butter. The meat was actually falling off from the bones. The muttom just melted in my mouth.

2) Murg Khushnawa Kebab (Rs.210/plate) : This was even better than Adrak ke punje. Two big breast pieces tandoored with stuffed cheese, khoya, kishmish and many more ingredients which we failed to guess (*Cries*) but the stuffing was surprisingly not sweet. It accompanied the chicken perfectly and we enjoyed each bite of it. Total foodgasm.
(I AM ACTUALLY SALIVATING. OH LORD).

3) Kali Dal Tadka (Rs.90/plate) : Oily but nice! :)

4) Murg reshmi butter masala (Rs.180/plate) : The best butter masala dish I have ever had. 5 large kebabs dipped in a thick gravy made with god knows what but the taste indicated the use of kaju paste and cream. The smokyness in the dish was mindblowing. We could not help but wipe the whole thing neat and clean off the container. Heavenly.

The price is on the higher side but the quality and tastes compensates for that. It's really difficult to get such a great quality of food so it's worth it.

The cheque came upto Rs.735 [Including Rs.10 for 2 containers. Excluding Tips.]
An amazing dinner.
Wish to order more from here.
Highly recommended!
Do try the above mentioned dishes and trust me, you won't be dissapointed at all! :)

Happy Eating! :D

It is the perfect epitome of 'substance over form'.
If you simply look at the entrance, ambience and locality of the restaurant you will find it hard to believe that this could be probably the best North Indian place in the city. However, just before you enter there are lot of certificates and accolades put up for public view. And this is what builds the expectation. These guys surely know how to satisfy the build up they create.

Best thing to try is the mutton ke punje. Best mutton I've eaten in this city. And overall the food was superb. Gluttons paradise for non-vegetarians. 

The ambience and service can be improved. That's why I rated it a 4 first. 
But the exceptionally good food and the value for money that you get covers for it. So, finally a 4.5 rating. 
This is a must visit place in the city!

I went there yesterday with my best buddy.I was initially worried if travelling all the way to kasba would be worth it,but Punjabi rasoi allayed all such forebodings.
The ambience is neat,with the colour combinations creating an overall warm aura.
We ordered-
Murgh lasuni kebab:It was great,well cooked tangris with a garlicky flavour.
Adrak k punje:This was the dish of the day.Succulent mutton ribs,with a mouth watering smell and creating an explosion of flavours as it melted in your mouth.
Garlic cheese naan:Again a delicious,soft delight.
Murgh jhal frezi:This comprised of chicken cooked in a gravy with capsicums and onion. It worked just fine with the naans.
Fresh lime soda:Soothing and sweet.
The service was good,with a warm welcome.Later the owner came over to our table and inquired politely about the food,and about our medical careers.
The bill came at rs.710,which we paid without any resentment.
A must visit for all north indian cuisine lovers.

Nestled in one of the quietest bye-lanes of Kasba (Behind KFC-Kasba; second left turn), the restaurant offers authentic Punjabi & Mughlai cuisine.

The 42-seater Restaurant is situated in the ground floor of a 2-storeyed building and has a ‘Blink-and-you-miss’ Entrance. The building would not have to try hard to give you second thoughts of entering the restaurant, but once you decide to take the plunge, the food makes it totally worth it.

Once inside, the ambiance was a tad better. The menu was simple and short. Breezing through it we decided that Kebabs will be the highlight of the meal and we asked the waiter to suggest us the Best Kebabs that the Restaurant has to offer. The staff was friendly and he immediately suggested Murg Lasuni Kebab, Fish Tikka Kebab and Mutton Adraki Kebab.
He also suggested a special Kabuli Naan as an accompaniment (another speciality of the Restaurant).
The Kebabs were delivered in about 10 minutes time and It was absolutely delicious, the mutton variant being the Best.

For main course, the staff taking our preference for non-veg, suggested Mutton Roganjosh and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala along with Butter Naan, and they did not disappoint either. As a special gesture, the staff also brought a dish of Palak and corn and it was absolutely beautiful. It along with Dal Maakhni is the speciality on the vegetarian menu.

There are very rare occasions when I say this but the entire food experience was absolutely orgasmic and I would definitely recommend all to dine at the restaurant.

Once  you enter this place ull feel as if you've entered a shady place. But once you order the food, ull forget all that.
This place is a delight for people who have non veg.  but they have limited but excellent vegetarian options too....

If it wasn't for Zomato, I would have never found this place. I am not much of a North Indian cuisine lover, but reading the rave reviews and the fact that it is so near my office, I gave it a try. And I was pleasantly surprised.

We ordered Mutton Adrak Ke Punje, Kabuli Naan and Mutton Biriyani. The Mutton Adrak Ke Punje was mind-blowing, the mutton was falling out of the bones and melting in my mouth. They serve 3 pieces in a plate, but they can serve you 2 or 4 and adjust the price. The Kabuli Naan, was soft, sweet and wonderful, but a bit too heavy for me. The portions are really large and don't believe them when they say one Naan is good for one. It is for 2, or even 3 if you are having other dishes as well.

The biriyani, not the best I have had (the best was the Kachhi Biriyani I had in Dhaka :P), but was very light and tasty, and again the mutton in the biriyani was awesome.

But the best thing about this place is the service. The waiter told us repeatedly that we are ordering too dry. We didn't mind and also bit short of cash (they don't take cards). But after we were served the waiter came with complimentary little bowl of Dal Makhani (which was one of the best I have had, with that creamy texture and smoky flavor) . It was soooo touching.

tried Resimi Butter Masala, Tandoori Butter Masala, Tandoori Chicken and Kabuli naan. Kabuli Naan is their specialty which is made with peanuts and cashew,,, it compliments the flavor of food with little sweetness of naan. Its the most authentic Punjabi food i had in Kolkata... Place is comfortable and service is quick.
Food justifies the price.....I recommend it.

Update:
I am visiting this restaurent for all most 8 years now. I am out of words to describe the quality of food here, its perfect and consistent whether its durga puja or other festival . There are many punjabi food joints out there but those cannot match Punjabee rasoi. 
 
Punjabee Rasoi is jewel for food lovers and according to me its a best place to get biryani and kebabs in Kasba region. Their Lasuni , pahari and malai are must have for tandoor food lovers. In main course, Biryani, butter masala are just too good and tasty. One bite you ask for more wow. For me I regularly visit this and the staff are friendly as well. And the best part is the owner will ask you for feedback. Last time I order Chicken biryani and Tikka buter masala.

This restaurant was on my wish list for quite some time now fuelled by the high ratings given by all other foodies. 

I went to this shady looking place once but was denied entry as it was beyond their service time, they don't serve between 3-6 pm. 

As it is said "Don't judge a book by its cover", so is the case with Punjabee Rasoi, located in a narrow alley near Siemens the first feeling was not a very pleasant one ad the location is a let off.

But hey isn't it the food we are reviewing here about and let me tell you its been 4 days since I went there but my tastebuds are still lingering with the flavours of their Murg Lehsuni Kabab. 

I will give you a crisp review on all parameters.

Location : Take the road to the left of Geetanjali Stadium if you are heading from Gariahat towards Ruby and then again take a left turn in the 2nd alley. 2/5 for location.

Ambience : Nothing special its just some tables and chairs arranged in series. 2.5/5 for ambience.

Food : This is the winner here,We had ordered the Signature dishes out here starting with Adrak Mutton ke Punje and Chicken Lehsuni Kabab, the manager gives you the option of a customised order depending on your requirements which is very convenient. The food arrived in around 15 minutes and the aroma and look of the starters was lipsmacking. We just ate our heart out, kebab was nicely marinated and grilled very tender and juicy and the unique aspect was the char coal smoky smell which just added on to the taste. We also had Kabuli Nan and Chicken Tikka Masala, both were good and the quantity was good. 4.5/5 on this.

Staff : The manager himself was very courteous but the same cannot be said for the remaining staff, they need to be trained properly in servicing. We had ordered starters as well as the main course and expected them to be served as and when they are supposed to be , Starters to be followed by Main course but instead he brought me the whole order at once and I had to instruct him to bring the Main course later once we had done with our starters. 3/5 on this.

Cost : Its just right, affordable. 4/5.

overall its been a wonderful experience and I am looking forward to more such visits to this wonderful place.

Today was my third experience with Punjabee Rasoi and their consistency in quality of food forced to write a review.
Location: Located behind KFC of Kasba main road. It’s not a huge place but still can accommodate 50-60 people at a time. As soon you entered the food you see certificated of Times food award for best north Indian food in Kolkata. The ambience is neat and clean, staff are courteous and service is fast.
Food: Coming to the main point FOOD. My rating for quality as well as quantity would be 10/10. I have tried Daal makhni, Mutton Saag, Chicken Tikka masala and Fish Tikka masala in my visits and every time they surprise me with awesome taste. I have been in Delhi for 5 years and being a foodie I feel have a decent taste for North Indian food. By any parameter these guys are as good as any north Indian food I have had. Add to that their very economical prices.
My suggestion would be to try this even if you are not a north Indian food fan. This restaurant might change perceptions. And my personal experience says try anything and you won’t be disappointed.
One more thing the person who is the manager/owner (I am not sure) is a very courteous and approachable. He would come and ask for feedback and generously listen to every feedback you give him.
Looking forward to going again and keep up the good work

Reading all the excellent reviews, we visited this restaurant last Sunday for lunch. 

Location and ambiance: The location is good, however the ambiance is not that great. It is situated in the ground floor of a residential building, where the bedrooms turned into your fine dining space. LOl!

Food: We ordered the popular dishes like the "lasuni tangri kebab", mutton adraki kebab, both chicken and mutton biriyani, tadka dal and nuns. The lasuni tangri kebab was good but not the best, the mutton kebab was soft and excellent.

The biriyani was also pretty good, however the egg tadka dal was sub standard. However, overall the food was fresh and good quality.

Price: The prices are not that reasonable as it should be considering it's low running cost for infrastructure (not having to rent/invest on a decent commercial space). Rather I'd say that the prices are rather comparable with other top restaurants out there. Example: 4 leg pieces of lasuni kebab costs Rs.260, 4 pieces of the mutton adraki costs Rs.325, the biriyani costs Rs.150 for mutton (one piece, no egg), egg tadka dal Rs.125. etc.

Credit cards not accepted, so in case you do not carry cash you're in for some inconvenience.

They do not give you a printed bill and do not add the service tax which indicates they might be suppressing the tax to the govt.

Overall: I don't think I'll be a repeat customer although the food is good.

Every time I think of indian I can't help thinking of any other place cus of the mind blowing food and yea its close to my house! The starters are different and really good! Must have is the adrak ke punje for non-veggies and aloo nazakat for the veggies!comment to main course all that I have tried so far is up to the mark... Must have here is chicken bharta for non veggies and kadai paneer for veggies! The cheese kulcha and the pudina naan is very good too! I have never been a phirni lover but here its different and good :) if they work on their service I would call them one of the best in town!

I shifted from delhi to Kolkata and really looking for a good North Indian food outside. Yesterday my colleague told to have food here and we visited the place . The first thing after going to this place was a homely feeling . Quality if food was real good, however I felt that if the dal makhani were good hot it would have been more tastier. However it's really good and recommended here to be there.

Heard about this restaurant from a friend who lives in the same locality. So decided to visit it. The location is a problem coz the restaurant is not exactly located on the main road and you have to search a bit to end up getting there. The decor is nicely done and sober and gives the feeling of a typical family restora. Now coming to the food, the Kebab we ordered was excellent and we enjoyed it a lot. For main course we ordered Garlic Naan and two dishes of Chicken. The food was decent but the garlic naan could have been better. If you are in and around that place or looking to satisfy your taste buds if you are passing around that Kasba sector, you can visit this place. Good but not excellent.

I had heard a lot of praise about this place from some of my relatives, so decided to try it out. The elderly Sardarji at the counter recommended Adrak ke Punje, so I ordered it along with Murg lasuni kabab. They were only so-so, nothing out of the ordinary. I’ve had better kababs at neighbouring Naushijaan.
                    

Update: Went for dine-in a couple of times since then.....was seated at the first floor on both occasions. The first time, ordered Kabuli naan.....it had lots of groundnut pieces on its surface, and proved to be a welcome change from other rotis and parathas. The accompanying Chicken bharta was also good.

On the next visit, opted for Mutton Makhmali Kebab; it was tasty, but instead of looking like conventional kebabs, it was a shapeless mass....almost resembling pulled meat. Also tried their Hyderabadi Mutton biryani....excessive beresta (fried onions) made it taste a bit sweet! The side-dish of Mutton kassa was okay, though.

Dear Foodies !! 

This is to introduce one of the best biryani's i have had in a very very long time . So my friend M's family took me out for dinner here . As we went on entering this place , slightly inside, very shady location. At first i thought it would be a below average place because it looked like we were trespassing someone's property ! 
However , we entered and i realised the place was completely full ! So we managed to squeeze in and sit in one corner where thankfully we had the air conditioning running pretty well . So we ordered for the chicken lasooni kebab, mutton adraki and mutton makhmali kebab . OH MY LORD . That was my expression when i took my first bite. It took  me back to ameenabagh in lucknow where daddy showed me where he used eat at his times !!! It was marvellous . So much that i am really at a loss for words . The kebab was soft , succulent, flavourful and basically everything you want in a kebab . All i can say is that there was a party going inside my mouth. We went on ordering for the biryani which was equally delicious . In fact i happen to find it much better than arsalaan or shiraaz or naushi jaan ! 
People !! Please pleaaaaase try this new place ! Its absolutely stunning ! If this is the standard of food that is there in this city, me for a change am ready to go miles ! 
And let me tell you the owner of this place is also a wonderful gentle man who happen to meet us and greet us very well. His team too makes one feel absolutely at home ! So three cheers for punjaaabeeeee rasoooiiii ! 
Till then ! Happy eating !!! I am still thinking of the kebab... Omnumnum

Two things which can be looked at is a) the place is a bit small and the tables are literally on top of each other. b) was a bit surprised when the waiter told me that they accept only cash and they don't take any cards (luckily I was carrying cash with me)!!!!

I have visited this place twice,first time out of curiosity and next for the food.
Decor is very simple and place small which is ok if you value good food at reasonable price.
Both times we have tried their different chicken dishes.
Lasundi murgh kabab is a good one to try.
Chicken tadka was good too without being too oily or spicy..I found their kulcha to be very soft and not heavy as in most North Indian eateries.But I have liked their special hyderabadi chicken biryani most .simply loved the spices in it.
Best thing was after meal it did not feel bloated and stuffy.
They can improve on lighting and space.
Keep up the food quality at reasonable price.

Punjabi rasoi is awesome. I went two times for take away dinner and it was both times mildly crowded. I being vegetarian only ordered paneer with assortment of naans... pudina naan came out to be awesome, and rest were better than many I had before. guys at this restaurant take their cooking seriously. Being from Rajasthan where dhabas are littered of scrumptious food servings I went a bit nostalgic, because this rasoi was kind of similar... bt 1 thing was missing which is quintessential to any Punjabi restaurant, shahi paneer :p :p best wishes to owners to keep offering traditional Punjabi taste...

My parents live in Kolkata and I visit, say, three to four times a year. THIS place is a family reunion ritual. My mom heard about this from a family friend and we were lovestruck from the first visit. The food has been of the same great quality everyone we have been there. The guy who owns the restaurant is super friendly and is always willing to suggest dishes to you if you are confused. The only drawback would probably be for first time visitor as they might find it difficult to locate. 

We usually get the kabuli naan, boti kebabs, lasuni murg and some mutton curry. They have been spectacular every time! Do visit, you won't be disappointed!

Been there yesterday. Had murg lasuni kabab and was good. I wish it was softer a bit. Both the kabuli naan and masala kulcha were sooo good. The chicken reshmi butter masala and its gravy were mouth watering. One must try this. And yes I didn't have any digestion problem which I usually have at other place with north indian food. :-P :-P This is the first time I'm rating someone 4. :-) :-) I'll visit again. Hope this review helps. B-)

Again I had been to this place yesterday. Ordered kabuli naan(good as usual but next time I would definitely like to order something different for different taste),  chicken jhal farezi( it was okay, not a 'must try' though), dal makhani( it was quite impressive I must say). The only negative point about this place was their very late service. We had to wait for a long time for the food which was quite disappointing. So my second visit was not as good as my first one, I rate it 3 this time.

This place. THIS PLACE IS NEAR MY PLACE YAY ! 
Okay it took me a while to discover it though as it is located inside an alley near Cheeni Kum. So me and my mom came here for dinner. 
The place is really small, maybe about 30 or 40 people can comfortably sit there and eat. The owners were really polite and courteous and me and my mom got ourselves a nice small little table. Now this place is no fuss, no glamor, just punjaabi khana ! (The table was really small, I thought the food would not fit on the table or something :p )
 The waiters are quick, give sensible suggestions and hence we ordered. 
1. Lasuni Murgh Kabab.- Four chicken legs roasted in the tandoor to perfection so that the meat falls of the bone literally ! It was served with green Chutney(mediocre) and salad. The taste was delicate as kebabs should be, most people think that they are all about spice but I am glad that this joint stuck to authenticity. :)
2. Gralic Naan- One of the best naan's I have had in the city in my opinion. Soft, light, garlicky, It was surely not  naaansense. Okay bad jokes apart I was in Naan heaven.
3. Chicken Tikka Butter Masala- This was the traditional stuff, with six chicken cubes perfectly cooked in a rich gravy, it was quite nice. 
Me and my mom were quite full from lunch so we didn't get a chance to try the famous kebabs but I will be coming back here again without a doubt ! No fuss, no glamor, just khana. :D

very good restaurant with lot of options for both veg as well as non vegetarians.

Location :
Bit difficult to locate..It is near to KFC,Kasba.Restaurant doesn't has any posh presence and therefore you need to ask the locals  for  help 

Food :
I guess the quality and taste for each and every dish is amazing.Always remember, punjabi dish are very easy to make because the spices are available and easy to cook.But the way of cooking makes all the difference.I tried chicken lasuni which was just one of its kind.The taste and odour of garlic was evenly spread over the chicken pieces and chicken is soft and tender.I guess  the secret lies in the marination.Further ,garlic cheese nan is worth trying.For veggies,just close your eyes and order dal makni and kadhai panner ..

Price :
i felt its quite reasonable .The quality of food matches the price you pay .

Ambiance :

Good .Though i want it to open the first floor.Ground floor is too congested.

Overall 
 4.5 ...... just reach there and start hogging

Size — or location — doesn’t matter for foodies on the lookout for that next appetising destination. Punjabee Rasoi is a case in point. This 40-seater eatery, lying in Rajdanga’s Chakraborty Para, has become a hit with meat-lovers, thanks to its kebabs.

Bite into a few of their signature dishes –– Mutton Adrak Ke Punje (tender mutton ribs with a hint of ginger) or Murg Lasuni Kebab (juicy drumstick-like chicken pieces cooked with a secret spice mix) — to know what we mean.

“Their kebabs are to die for! I live on SN Banerjee Road but each time I am close to Gariahat, I drop by,” said Shelley Dores, a teacher who was enjoying her lunch.

Besides 15 types of kebabs that are served every day, the restaurant also rustles up some special numbers during weekends –– Murg Khusnawa, Chicken Onion Kebab and Whole Bhetki Tandoori Kebabs. Then there is Mutton Roganjosh, Murg Tandoori Butter Masala (on the bone) and Murg Tikka Butter Masala. Enjoy all this with rotis or Kabuli Naan.

“We make food with passion. When people tell us, ‘Dada, darun chhilo (it was awesome)!’, we feel satisfied. I stopped my catering service to concentrate on the restaurant,” said P.V. Raju, the proprietor of Punjabee Rasoi.

Punjabee Rasoi has been in business for over three years and Raju has done well, though Punjabi food is not the staple diet of this man from Kerala! So how did the cross-cultural food pollination happen?

“When I was young, we had a north Indian neighbour who was a fantastic cook. I would often drop into her kitchen.... And, of course, my wife is Punjabi!” laughed Raju.

When we reached the restaurant after much trouble (not so good location), we had apprehensions as to how good it will be. Small size. A bit slow service. But, the food! Ah! Outweihed every single shortcoming. I would like to specially praise the yellow dal butter fry. The preparations of chicken are popular in many places. But never have i tasted such dal. Awesome food. Wish the restaurant all the best fr the future.

Visited this place on a friend's recommendation.  Also this place was on my wish list for quite some time now. Nestled in a quiet neighborhood in Kasba, very close to Gitanjali Stadium you might not locate the place easily if you are not from South Calcutta. So the easiest driving direction would be to take the lane next to Gitanjali Stadium and proceed straight and then take the second left from there.

The two of us were lucky to find a table...reached there around 9:15 in the evening and the place was filled in no less than 20 minutes. Nothing much to write about the decor....its neat and simple and the restaurant is a work in progress. It's a 42 seater eatery at the moment and I was told that they are adding space on the first floor. 

Coming to the food....we ordered a plate of mutton adrak ke and a plate of chicken lasuni kebab. Since we were the two of us the manager said he will give two pieces (instead of three pieces which make a plate) and adjust the price. I thought that was very sweet of him. The mutton adrak ke was juicy and very nicely marinated and grilled and very soft. The chicken lasuni lebab was grilled to perfection. The kebabs comes with finely chopped onions and lemon slices which makes for a delightful garnishing.  The kebabs took about 10 minutes to arrive.

For main course we ordered mutton jhal farezi and dal makhani along with one cheese garlic nan and one kabuli naan. I must recommend both the cheese garlic nan and kabuli nan...both of which were extremely heavy. The cheese garlic nan was crispy and you would love the taste. The jhal farezi as the name suggests is slightly spicy gravy dish with nice soft pieces of mutton (not boneless) cooked with capsicum and onions. I thought the mutton was very good, nicely marinated and prepared. The dal makhani was pretty standard as compared to the other places. 

The pricing I thought was pretty reasonable and the quantity pretty good. Do make sure to pick up some cash from the nearest ATM as they do not take cards yet. And yes you get a hand written bill! A very good dining experience and I am surely going back a second time. One of the very good places which serves authentic north west frontier cuisine.

Location wise it may be a bit difficult for you to find it out, but even if you feel irritated while searching for this place, I can assure you that you will be extremely glad after having food there.
Best thing is take a parcel rather than sitting there as the sitting arrangements are a bit congested.
Mutton adrak ki and chiekcen lahsoni kabab are just awesome, so soft will melt inside the mouth, biryani is also very good. naan and kulcha and other gravy items are of equal taste.
I am a regular visitor of this place. Now it has become a bit expensive but they have not degraded the quality at all.
Staffs are good and the owner and his mistress themselves are very nice and co-operative.

So, after reading the excellent reviews here, my friends and I decided to come here to celebrate a birthday. We had reserved a table for 5, on a Saturday evening. When we arrived we realised the place was really tiny. There must have been just 5 or 6 tables that could seat only 2 or 4 people. The place was full. We were made to wait for half an hour and after that the table the staff kept on saying they would seat us in was given to a group that had just walked in. The staff was then extremely rude and didn’t give us any explaination. Another couple who was waiting with us was treated similarly and had stormed off after explaining to us that the horrible staff was clearly stoned. 
	Now, I believe the food there is excellent, but how can a restaurant possibly be so obnoxious as to make their patrons wait for so long and still not be able to deliver on the reservation. Had we come in without a reservation, I wouldn’t feel too bad but the attitude and general mannerism of the staff was ultimately insufferable. They kept us misguided and kept on promising that our table would be ready in 2 to 5 minutes, while still serving the people who occupied it their starters. 
	A restaurant that doesn’t respect its customers is possibly the worst type there is. If I could I would have given them a way worse review, maybe even a negative 5. They managed to ruin a special day, had no remorse for their intolerable attitude and made no attempt to rectify their faults. So, I would not be coming back here again and suggest others not to either.

Probably this is a thumb rule. If you are to put lot of effort to find a Restaurant then it must be good one  :) .. Punjabi Rasoi offers you one of the finest North- Indian delicacies in kolkata. Specially their kebabs. Mutton Adrak ke punje is one of their finest recipe. Generally, you wouldn't find that sort of mutton kebab in many places. In most of the places Mutton kebab's main ingredient is minced mutton but in this case this is different . 3 big pieces of mutton served with green chatni. Dal makhni is probably the best dal makhni i have had in my entire life. Biriyani is also very nice and so does the kabuli naan, ittle bit on the sweeter side but nice. we  also  ordered fish tikka butter masala. amount may disappoint you with only 2 pieces of fish but tested brilliant. Nothing much to talk about their ambiance , decent one.  Overall brilliant Gastronomical delight.

Punjabee Rasoi is located in a place where you won't just see it and say, "Aah! Let's try it out!" Youactually have to find the place on google maps and then go. The area is a little isolated. The ambience of the place is a big ZERO. There is hardly any place. Its small, and simple. Not very poshe or lavish BUT BUT BUT the food. 
The reason I gave it a 3.5 is the food! I LOVE the food. The Kali Dal, the tandoori Gobi and the sabzis are all delicious. It is cheap and totally worth every penny. Food is light and delicious. Your stomach will be full but your heart will still want more. I won't recommend you to take your girlfriend there on a date but if you want a simple lunch or a cheap place with excellent food then that's the place! 
It's in Kasba so people living close by can easily drop in for dinner/lunch. 
Apart from the food, service is FAST and the waiters are VERY helpful and thoughtful. They are well trained and a little talkative :P 

So all in all Food :4/5 and Ambience :0/5 Service :4/5

Went ther on sunday with a few friends,they lobed the food so much that they made other people also go there and try it out today... and today also i was blown away by the quality of the food they serve. The price , quality and quantity both are right!
This place brings you straight to the main thing..the food. There is no music or expensive decor abd the main focus is on food. The serving is a bit slow specially on weekends but once you get your food you wont be able to stop yourself



----- 28 Jan, 2014 -----

Ive been here around 6 times and the food was delicious all of these times. This place has some really good options for vegetarians also. The dal makhani which they serve isnt the kind u might get in the dhabas... you wont get the oil neither will ur stomach burn after youve had some. The food is really good although service might get a bit slow sometimes. Waiting on a busy day might get very irritating though. 5 stars for the food 4.5 stars for service

The zomator reviews speak very highly of this restaurant and so,I decided to try it out for my Sunday brunch.(no,they don’t have a separate brunch menu).
ADRAKH KI PANJE- look, I don’t really understand the zing of kebabs,what makes them good or superlatively so.however,this one definitely has a distinct charm of its own.the large pieces of mutton all spiced up and marinated makes for a veritable item.

Murg pahari kebab-remember what I just said now about kebabs? This is the best example of stereotype kebab where I don’t recognize the good,bad and ugly.it’s the same traditional preparation,albeit  styled like hariyali kebab

Chilman biryani- it’s vegetarian and I was curious to see how they make biryani a feast for the buds without adding flesh.yeah,they make it all right.the aroma,the commendable concoction of veggies  was praiseworthy

BABYCORN  MUSHROOM  MASALA- all I can say about this one Is “wow”.this was my pick of the day.i’m keeping this one a surprise,go try it and find out for yourself 

FISH TIKIA BUTTER MASALA-very nicely made,with the full punch of a butter masala curry.only,they gave very few pieces of fish.
It was a nice tandoor fiesta!

The food of this place is awesome.I went with my family n friend we were 7 people including kids.We waited for 1 hr for our no to come but  we did not regret eating the food.As we were vegetarian we ordered kebabs as potato.Potatoes were stuffed,the taste was excellent.then we ordered paneer tikka that was also good.For the main course Dal,corn mushroom,corn palak.Corn mushroom was mind blowing.corn palak was also equally good.garlic nana was full of flavour.The only drawback is the ambience.Its  a little clumsy.But if u really want good food than ignore the ambience.Service was very quick.And the main point is no additional tax.So it becomes  reasonable.

Punjabee Rasoi...got to read about it at Zomato itself. As already expected, locating it was bit difficult, however, the manager helped us to get there over phone. We were two in number, on a Sunday afternoon.
After reading the reviews in Zomato, expectations were already high, and must say that Punjabee Rasoi fulfilled it to the max.The ambience gives you a homely feel, though a bit congested (0.5 points deducted for the same). However, the hospitality of the staffs is really warm. 
We liked most Murg Lasuni Kebab, Kabuli Nun and Murg Jhal Farezi.The chicken served was soft, well cooked and really spicy, just as we like it. The chefs have really done a fabulous job in delivering this level of delicacy, that also at such a pocket friendly price. It is a nice place to visit with family and friends.
Got to come back soon.

One of the few places in Kolkata that serves top notch quality north Indian food!!
Located in some shady alley in the road adjoining KFC near Gitanjali stadium this place very difficult to locate but once you do and grab a bite of anything that you order you would no longer fret about it.They have a small but a cozy interior nothing but boast about.Everything from starters to the main course to the dessert is brilliant.Having visited this place a couple of times and having tried both veg and the non veg cuisine I have nothing to complain.

Must try:
Paneer Jhal Farezi and Kadhai Paneer
Chicken tikka butter masala.
Phirni

Punjabee rasoi a place i had great hopes from,so last saturday I and a few friends of mine decided to check out this place...on reaching this place we were shocked to see that it was a very small dingy place with hardly 4-5 tables.we decided to wait until we found out that a family which had come much later were served first for wich the reason given to us was very vague..so after waiting there for approximately an hour we lost patience and left...a total dissappinting saturday night...would never visit this for the favouritism and biasdness we faced there....

One simple word describes this place... "Aweeeeesomeeeee".... Went there for my 2nd anniversary with my wife and enjoyed the food thoroughly..... The staff is also very polite and helpful taking personal care for each and every group of people.The prices were quite reasonable for the quality they offer. The Kebabs are simply out of this world and their taste made us order a third one after we had two types of Kebabs and main course. 

We Had:

Chicken Lasuni Kebab
Mutton Adrak ke punje
Cheese Garlic Nan
Murg Jhal Frarezi

Trust me both of us were full to the brim but just could not resist another Kebab so we ordered 

Chicken Malai Kebab.

We just couldn't walk after that as we were so full but the taste still remains in our mouth and we would definitely keep going back to this place time and again.

The Only downside of this place I would say is the space as there is severe space crunch for a restaurant this good and the wait time might be a bit long if the tables are full as just like me nobody wants to miss out on anything they offer. 

Trust me its worth every word!!!

I got to know about this place around 2yrs bck from zomato. When i came bck to Kolkata, went there with my friends. Since then I hv visited the place over and over again. 
    The kebabs and bread items are just too good. Murg Lasuni Kebab is definitely leads the list. All the naan and roti item, especially the kabuli naan is worth mentioning. The gravy items are also prepared keeping the unique north indian essence. 
    The ambience is calm and quiet. Do not expect any lavish outlook and decorations of branded chain restaurants. The attendees and especially the owner is very cordial and interacts personally with the guests. To sum it up, if you are a foodie and love north indian food, this place is a must.

Visited couple of weeks ago with my wife. Since it was the first time we visited the restaurant, I found it a little difficult to locate it. A decent 5-7 mins walking from Rashbehari Connector if public transport is availed. Parking is available off the lanes. We need to wait a bit as it was a Saturday noon. Finally it was our turn, and by the time I discovered I am not carrying enough cash (oh yes, they don't accept card, at lease they did not used to when we  visited). Again needed to head back to Rashbehari Connector to fetch some cash from ATM. Once we entered, we found the place is little cramped. The capacity was more or less 30. Ordered Murg Lasuni Kabab as starter which came around in decent time. And it was delicious!! Since long I had not tested such soft, perfectly flavored kebabs. I wished I could test all type of kebabs on the menu!! The main course started with Masala Kulcha, Cheese Garlic Nun, and Murg Kadai. Both kulcha, and nun were fabulous, took no time to vanish off within mouth. Murg kadai was spiced up damn good, and I like it when they do that. Overall, a wonderful experience in terms of food quality. Looking forward to visit again soon (of course can't stay longer without checking out the rest of the Kebab items like Mutton Adrak Ke Panje :)). And the best part is it will not hurt your pocket much compared to some other available food joints/restaurants in its league.

It was difficult to locate this restaurant ...had to keep asking the localities .. thank heavens they knew...! Now I'll start by talking about the ambience of which I have nothing to boast of. Very clumsy sitting arrangement , very suffocating especially if you r sitting inside..  coming to the price... meal is extremely pricey . A very smal meal consisting of dal makhani , 1 roti , 1 nun and. Four small - medium sized chicken and pepsi costed us 550+  now the lasuni kabab is really something reminded me of the kababs which I had in chandigarh . Butter roti was also extremely delicious . Now coming to cheesy garlic nun it was absolutely nothing at all totally a waste .. over hyped ! The garlic was tasting bitter as it was  I think they had burnt it. Butter roti rather was delicious of which I am surprised nobody here spoke bout much ... dal makhani was nothing so great I am vouching so as many other places or rather even my mother makes it better.  Verdict ---- food is not bad , but as I said I feel its a lil over hyped not a value for money, i'd rather go for buffet at barbeque nation or funjabi tadka... :-)

I was reviewing Punjabi Rasoi for last few months but could actually taste them today. It was like - oops, why was I so late in visiting them ! Honestly speaking I could never imagine a Keralite speaking bengali and serving this level of punjabi delicacy. Their dishes are awesome, just 5 out of 5. We tried Lasooni Kebab and their signature dish of Mutton Adrak Ke Punje, both were fabulous. Though the tadoori chicken didn't touch my heart but again the taste & smoky aroma of the Dal Makhani has won the whole game. Masala Kulcha was worth trying too. It was worth travelling to Kasba from Bangur (~ 16 km) as it was a true treat to our gluttony !
People can complaint about their location and sitting capacity, but I would rather take this as a acid test for my taste buds ! It will in fact prove to you that how much you are eager to have good kebabs than trying the popular joints of AHD or Arsalan. If you are lost in the alleys of Rajdanga, aroma of their kebabs will rescue you. And if you are tired of waiting in the queue, the right hand side of their menu card will calm you. And when you feel the midas touch of their 'Atithi Devo Bhavah' culture while seeking feedback or sending you off; you must tell yourself that you would come real soon for the Mushroom Kebab next time. At least that would work for me !

If you're in Kasba, then this is the place for you! The menu is very limited and the place is a bit small. But when it comes to food these small things won't matter. It was excellent. The malai naan was out of this world and the chicken tikka butter masala was too good. Even though I am not a huge fan of vegetarian food I loved the mushroom kabab preparation. It was brilliant and that is one of the best vegetarian dishes I've ever tried. The garlic naan and the reshmi butter masala were very nice. Will definitely visit this place soon. :)
And I see people complaining about the location, but it wasn't that difficult to locate. It's right after Siemens and if you ask anyone there they would tell you about the place.

Only one unfortunate bit is the location. Really off the road. But that is where the negatives end. The food is quite brilliant. We were on a little budgetary restriction, so we did limit ourselves here, but have promised to come back. 

The garlic naan and the malai kulcha were magnificent. The kulcha had this light sweetness to it which I havent experienced often and definitely not at this price point. The garlic naan was equally impressive without the garlic being too overpowering at all. Soft and very slightly crusted on the top. Beautiful. The gravies were on another level altogether. We ordered the standard tikka kebab butter masala and the reshmi kebab butter masala. But here, the standard was something else. Beautifully flavoured, soft, succulent kebabs and none of those raw spice flavours in your mouth. Well rounded and tasty and there is nothing else you can ask for. My vegetarian friends opted for a mushroom-something kebab. Now, I do not look at vegetarian food with a lot of respect, but next time I come, I might actually order that. Was amazing. Mushrooms perhaps have never tasted better in a place serving food.

And the best part is that this place is so affordable. The prices on the menu is inclusive of taxes. Four of us paid 1245. Maybe we could have added 100 per head to get a few plates of starters, and then it would have been a pretty grand meal.

Value for money? Oh yes it is!

I really liked the food in this place. Though I havent yet tried their signature dishes, still i dont feel hasitated giving them 4 out of 5.  

I tried Jeera Rice with Mutton Keema which was just like the way it should be. Mutton was perfectly cooked with no overpowering masala in the curry. Another fact that made me happy is that, the menu card is quite reasonable and affordable too.

So I am definitely going for my next round and would suggest you foodies to try this place once .

Simply awesome food. Read about this restaurant in t2 and was intrigued by the glowing coverage. Its a little difficult to find, located in a byline behind the KFC on the Ruby connector. There is parking available for 2-3 cars out front. The restaurant has a dine-in facility as well as takeout. We did not try out the dine-in. The first time we went, we ordered the lahsuni kebabs and the adrak ke punje. As were carrying the food back home in the car, the smell was very distracting :). The kebabs are one of the best I have had, probably at the Kareem's level if not better. We have since gone back for the same multiple times.

Located in a lane nearby to Geetanjali stadium in Kasba but not very difficult to locate!! It is not a fine-dine restaurant but u are surely gonna come here for the addiction to the FOOD.. And the 2 signature kebabs which I am sure every1 drools over---- Mutton adrak ke panje and Murg lasuni kebab.. They are Brilliantly done!! My favourite list also consists of Kabuli Nan which is sweet but very yummy, Dal Makhani-- best in the world,Palak corn-- subtle flavour and very tasty, Chicken tandoori butter masala-- creamy gravy goes well with Rotis and Naans.. Havent tried the desserts,there aint too many either.. Surely will continue to go there for the food.. Kudos!!

normally i would have given the place a 3.5, but the it deserves 0.5 more because of its idiosyncysy in portions: if you want two kebabs, you get two, if you want 7, you get seven. in fact, the waiters, who are very well versed with the menu and will tell you exactly what will suit your taste, recommends the number of kebabs depending onthe no. of people on the table. the kebabs are succulent, especially the adrak ke panje. 
we ordered 2 type of kebabs and then just like anyone who has visited the place, we also ordered lasuni naan and some spicy chicken curry dish (the name of which escapes my memory, tough the taste still lingers). we wanted to order dal makhni but we were already too full. the surprise came when one of the waiters came in with a bowl of the dal and said complements of the kitchen! well! unexpected and a very nice marketing gesture! 
bowled over, quite literally!
even so, when we saw the bill, a meagre 600 with all that we had ordered along with the lime sodas and naans!
very nice, very filling and given its location, apt as the saying goes, some of the best things in life are a little harder to find.

One word for this Wonder in the food world........INSANE!!!! Its located in a place which has to be searched by people...and then also whenever i have been there i waited for atleast 30 min......now that's what i call popularity. Simple homly decor......but what makes this joint out of this world is the FOOD........The Adraki Gosht Ka panja is just.....OH MY GOD. Hot and fresh out of sigree that mystical taste of ginger and garlic and all the masala adorned on the leg of the lamb....is a treat for every human alive. 2nd Best Murg Lasooni Kebab......if a bird is to be cooked ...then this is the best way to do justice to it. By far The best Dal Makhani i ever Had in my whole life throughout India. Its Just freaking awsome. Price is moderate and if i start syaing about the other items it will be equivalent to the menu itself. In a nutshell...A HEAVENLY GASTRANOMICAL EXPERIENCE ONE CAN EVER EXPERIENCE.

last night was remarkably so wonderful. Family dinner in the best north indian joint of Calcutta. The food here is as usually superb. "Adrak ke panje" and "Murgh lasuni " is still lingering somewhere in my mouth. Followed by a light main course of "Matar methi malai" along with "Kabuli naan". Amazing it was till the last bite. Hoping to visit again soon.

Was floored by the reviews so being a foodie, I had to give this place a shot. Dropped in yesterday with my girl gang and I wasn't disappointed.

Ambiance: not as bad as some of the posts claim unless they've renovated recently. The room inside is quaint and nicely done up..so is the outside. decor is minimal but nice. They are painting the building right now, so looks bright and clean.

Service: was awesome! very rarely do you find a restaurant willing to customize serving size. We were a set of 2 veggies and 2 non-veggies..they customised each kebab plate to two pieces and priced it proportionately less giving us an opportunity to a) try more fare and b) not waste food! The servers were also well aware of the menu. The owner also came and met us, which leaves you with a nice feeling. The lil things that matter :)

Now the most important bit, Food: ordered the recommended dishes here mainly. The murgh lasuni kebab was awesome as reviewed a zillion times. The mutton adrak ke punje was a lil low on the adrak flavour but the meat was so juicy and succulent, one just can't complain. I'm not a big mutton fan but yesterday I enjoyed my mutton 'kobji dubiye'! We also had the bharwan aloo which was again brilliant. the flavours were nice. the masala papad, combined with boondi raita was magical.
For the main course, we ordered dal makhani (reminded me so much of my delhi days..was awesome!), veg do piazza (was probably the low point of the meal..tasted nice but not as good as the other stuff) and murgh tikka butter masala (chicken was soft and juicy..the gravy was decent). We ordered peas pulao (was perfect!), pudina paratha (have had better, very low on flavour), masala kulcha (good!), cheese garlic naan (awesome!) and tandoori roti (the usual).
We topped up the meal with some phirni (the only dessert they had on offer :( and it wasn't even all that great..less sweet which is good but no pista flavour! most probably stocked from utside, not an inhouse preparation.). We had also ordered fresh lime juice (have had better!).

Overall, had a greatttt time and at reasonable prices. Would suggest people stick to ordering loads of kebabs and only naan and dal makhani on the side. That's my plan for my next visit. Looking forward to trying the ajwaini fish tikka! :D

Visited the Punjabee Rasoi yesterday with wife for lunch, unfamiliar place as I stay in the extreme north. Chakraborty Para bustop lane besides the Gitanjali stadium ,than the first left again left takes you to this restaurant.Place is known to be Rajdanga. Bit confined space wise,no fine dining but good food is what you come here for . Partially empty at 1:00 PM , and the guests count increased within 30 minutes of time to fill the tables .

Mr Raju ,owner of the place came to us and asked if we are the first timers, than he recommended few of his best dishes ,i.e. Murg Lasuni Kebab, Adrak ke Panje and Dal Makhani etc. 

Now what we ordered  :

a. Murg Lasuni Kebab - Creamy ,soft n juicy tender Kebabs cooked in tandoor with hint of garlic 
b. Dal Makhani - Rich yummy buttery dish and you crave for more , this is a must when I come here 
c. Murg Tandoori butter masala or murgh makhani - Tandoori chicken in tomato, butter and indian herbs like kasuri methi,garam masala gravy
d. Cheese Garlic Naan - Awesome crisp lasuni naan toasted with grated cheese and butter
e. Tandoori Parantha - Crispy Lachha parantha made of Atta 

Punjabee cuisines are in fact prepared with liberal amounts of ghee/butter and rotis are mostly prepared with whole wheat .Also the main masala for gravys consists of garlic , ginger and tomato. Here you get the traditional values of Punjab neatly preserved in the cuisines .As Mr. Raju said they use pure butter(makhan) in preparing dishes which has butter in it like butter chicken,dal makhani etc , so richness is obvious .There was another complimentary from them which was Palak Corn ,again one finger licking vegetarian dish that could be a great companion for vegetarians . 

Must visit for people loving north indian/punjabee cuisines, relish good food .

Note: Punjabee Rasoi received the Best North Indian food (Stand Alone )from Times  in Kolkata for  the year 2013

This was my second outing and m not all disappointed.  The food quality is better than many other renowned restaurants in town.Do give it a try.
Lasuni kabab, palak corn, kabuli nan and mutton jhalfarezi 
are my favorites.
Thank you for such a lovely lunch.
Best wishes
Will b back soon!!!

Review 2.0 :P !

 Just when you think that the lasuni kebabs couldn't get any juicier, they actually do. Everytime I'm at this place I don't even need to see the menu ! Lasuni kebabs and Garlic Cheese nan is what I order and enjoy everytime. 

AMBIANCE : Nothing to brag about. Decent is the ideal word for it. Even with 30 seats,It's usually vacant, so you need not worry about bookings. The waiters are knowledgable enough. 

FOOD : North Indian is their forte. The menu is one of the shortest I've ever seen. But I'm guessing that almost every dish is a winner. Now back to lasuni kebabs. They are so juicy and tasty that I'm sure eating them is a sin ! It's my guilty pleasure. Added with the Garlic Cheese Nan it's irrisistible. One would think that eating kebab with a nan is usually quite dry ! But it's not the case here. You'll be done with them in no time at all. Sometimes food is the only deciding factor and in those times very few restaurants match upto this one. Even if you try one cannot exceed the 1000/- mark ! Yes it's that reasonable!! 

Cost for 2 : 650/- 

FINAL CONCLUSION : Get some as soon as possible. It's too good to be sitting here and reading the reviews !!! -





---- 10 May, 2013 ----- After reading various Reviews decided to check this place out ! 

PRO's : Prompt Service Mouth Watering Food Innovative Dishes Air Conditioned Portions are ample 
CON's : Horrible Location : The street leading to it is filled with Slums !! Quite a small space although tables are big enough Utensils are of Inferior quality ! Seems old steel plates ! 

Ambiance : Nothing Spectacular 

FINAL VERDICT : I ordered the Lasuni Kebab with the cheese Garlic Nan Followed by the Mutton Adrak Ke Punje. Prices are fine considering the portions. First of all the Lasuni Kebab melts in your mouth.It was so light and yet so tasty and coupled with the nan OMG !! Even the Adrak ke Punje was very juicy and soft.Although i prefer not to scrape meat from the Goat's Ribs, I couldn't help it. Overall it was a satisfying Ordeal. Would have loved if they had mocktails but alas ! Simple tasty food & worth inspite of the crappy location.

tucked away from the noise of the main road, this restaurant is all that a north indian can ask for. as deceiving as the exterior looks, the food is just the opposite. their lavish variety of kebabs offer one the true experience of experimenting with vivid flavors. by far thw best dal makhani iv had in the longest time. like my friend dining with me said, "its world class". punjabee rasoi have truly sheltered thee best culinary experts in town. the manager cum owner of the place is a cherry on top. upon our arrival, he was very generous and courteous and offered to have us try his specialities. we were blown away by the hospitality of the place. if anyone in kolkata is looking for the most 'pocket friendly' exquisite meal, this is the place. ill probably be hoing there more often..

People ask me why I go to restaurants in  desolate places that are so difficult to find, and I reply, that these are the places where you can get some of the best food you have tasted.  In between KFC at Kasba, and Gitanjali stadium lies a by-lane called Chakraborty Para (bus stop). Walking into the lane for about 100 metres, one sees another smaller by-lane leading to a water tank. At the end of this winding lane lies Punjabee Rasoi, a restaurant that does not seem like much from the outside, but then, one must never judge a book by its cover, should they?? 

Punjabee Rasoi was once an apartment, until the owners decided to turn the ground floor into a restaurant. While entering, you may get a glimpse of the inside of the kitchen, and trust me when I tell you, it IS clean. The restaurant itself is quite small and can seat around 12 people comfortably. For starters, the manager recommended the Mutton Adrak ke Punje Kabaab and  Murg Lasuni Kabaab. We ordered both, along with a plate of Tandoori Chicken (I was in the mood). The kababs were some of the best ones I have ever tasted. The mutton was soft and melt in your mouth, the chicken lasuni kabab had a hint of garlic, which was present in every bite, but not overpowering. And the chicken tandoori, well the picture will say it all. Tasty pieces of chicken, spiced impeccably, and roasted to perfection in a tandoor oven. For our main course we ordered Masala Kulcha, Tandoori Roti, Alu Paratha and Biryani. In most restaurants, these breads are stuffed minimally, and thus one gets traces of the filling in each bread, however this was not the case here. All the parathas were yummy and a treat in themselves. Though we also ordered Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Vegetable Jhal Farzi, we felt as if we didn’t need them at all. However, I must mention that the side dishes were great to taste as well, and I was very much satisfied with the ample quantity. In many restaurants, I have found the same flavor base in the gravies served for different dishes, that it almost appears that one is having the same gravy, but differently coloured. I was more than happy to find that here, each gravy, each dish, has its own unique identity, and is rich in flavor. The biryani was not great, if you compare it to Mughlai restaurants like Shiraz or Aminia, but then, this is not a Mughlai restaurant, is it?
Punjabee Rasoi’s food comes with a  warning for many other restaurants: If one can get such amazing authentic food at such cheap prices, why would customers go elsewhere??

PS- No VAT/Tax is charged in the bill. However for Home Delivery or for packing extra food, container charges are extra.

My visit to Punjabi Rasoi has always been pleasant. The first time I visited it was slightly difficult to locate, tucked away in a cosy corner in one of the bylanes of Kasba Ruby Connector.. Looks are really deceptive and one shouldn't get opiniated by the frugal exterior. First:- the restaurant and its service..its a small joint but pretty high up on service.. Weekends can get overcrowded though.. you can call and inquire and reserve also but you need to wait till tables are cleared. the staff& the owner is customer friendly and has nice disposition, always ready to assist. The restaurant is clean and pretty high on hygiene.. which is a good sign..Second Food:- I am not much into north indian cuisine but  I can vouch that this is one of the places where they serve the best kebabs. Adrak ke Punje(mutton kebabs), Lasuni Kebabs(chicken), Kali Dal  ,Yellow Da land Kabuli Naan are few of the stuffs to look out for! The best part is that their cooking medium never makes you feel heavy and stuffed. Iam yet to try the rest of the menu but till now whatever I have tried has been a delicious experience. A hearty meal for two will cost you aound 1000/- but its worth it. So if punjabi food is your weekness, this place is a must try!

Ahh Punjabee Rasoi... Another Foodie's Stop!!

Located in a tricky location behind kasba KFC, its one of the talk of the town. We went there a few days back to get our taste buds delighted. The exterior of the building didn't gave any appeal but once in you can actually get the feel of the northern India. We took a seat of two and started glancing in the menu card. Meanwhile the manger of the restaurant came and greeted us. Being new to the place we told him to suggest what is there specialty. He suggested to have Mutton Adrak ke panjee, murg lasuni kebab and Khusnawa kebab. For the first time in my life, the manger himself suggested that dont take all three of these as it would be more for you, instead he customized it one piece from each plate. Impressed we already were, with the hospitality skills.
The kebabs were really succulent and juicy, this was the finest mutton kebab i had ever tasted.... then we moved on to main course, we ordered Kabuli naan... special mention here for Kabuli Naan, it is undoubtedly the best naan you will ever have..... sprinkled with peanuts and sugar with a smell of fresh butter.... you will fall in love with it the moment it is served.... also the Tanddori gobi and palak corn will get special accolades from me.... Every bite of the food was worth praising!!..... Punjabee Rasoi is a clear winner for both the food and the focus they have for customers... Cheers!!

Taking the first left off the road that runs between Kasba’s KFC and Gitanjali Stadium, and walking further along you arrive at an unimpressive building, named Punjabee Rasoi.

Beware.

The exterior’s only a disguise. The dimly lit and comfortably furnished dining space scores high on ambience, food and service.

The prices on the menu are perhaps inclusive of the tax, if any, for they charge nothing extra. You can avail either regular or mineral drinking water. Consulting with the extremely helpful staff, we ordered the following (in no particular order):
(1) Chicken Tandoori: We ordered half of one plate which is equivalent to two medium-sized, tender pieces of chicken. While one piece contained adequate amounts of chicken, the other did not.
(2) Lasuni Kebab: A full plate offers four pieces and a half plate offers two, served with onion salad and green pudina chutney (second helpings of which we were served without hesitation). Each piece was delicious, succulent and abundantly laden with chicken.
(3) Kabuli Naan: To the naked eye, it seemed like Naan topped off with caramelised crushed nuts. Each plate contains six small halves. It is a specialty that was suggested to us to go with the Lasuni Kebab and by all accounts, it was an excellent combination. It might appeal more to those with a sweet tooth.
(4) Egg Biryani: Although, there are better biryani-makers out there, they do a very good job of it (often reminding me of the biryani that is made at home). It's safe to say they don't compromise on quantity. The rice was never oily and the aloo was of appreciable quality.
(5) Murg Tandoori Butter Masala: Containing two moderately sized pieces of chicken (with bone); the star of this dish is its gravy, which was provided in plenty. In spite of this, I’d still say that it was slightly overpriced.
(6) Laccha Paratha: I was expecting a tawa-fried paratha and got something that would probably be a delectable version of ‘Lachha Naan’, if someone ever attempted one.

To top it off all, we were served a small bowl of Palak Corn – complementary, which probably made it tastier! Food was served without a noticeable delay and service was the best of its kind. The meal cost us, a group of four, Rs. 925. 

Satiated? Check. 

p.s. The photographs are of pieces of Lasuni Kabab and Kabuli Naan, taken by a friend.

We went there as referred by one of my friends.At first we could not find the restro itself ! At last we found it and discovered as first as like a Take -away.At the First sight,we become confused whether to get in or not as ambience wise it was poor and the place of dine is really congested.Again we called up our friend as we couldn't decide to go or not.He told If we dont like the food over here he would treat us for a meal.FREE!We got in.As prescribed by him We have ordered one Mutton adrak ki Punje & Chicken Lasooni kabab with Kabuli NAAN.Lasooni kabab was excellent in taste.Mutton was very well marinated and soft! kabuli naan was the Naan covered with grinded peanuts,butter &grains of Sugar.I liked it but not that much as I am not fond of peanuts flavour and sweets.Then We had Mutton Zalfeeraji and Chicken tikka butter masala.Those two items also were good in taste and specially the mutton pieces are all Bone marrow pieces so I just loved it.Butter Naan was just like the cottonballs...soft ,soft and vanished from your mouth before you start chewing! Sweet Lime soda along with these was just a matchmaker. The food was NOT RICH at all but was RICH in tastes
Last to add-  we were only charged for the food;No VAT/Taxes was charged.Only thing we faced a problem that no card swipping m/c was there and after eating like a Pig we had to search for the ATM to do the payment.I deducted .5 because of that only!
Only thing to see how long they can maintain their tastes?

I have been a regular (with my family & relatives) at this Restaurant almost since its inception.... the food is exquisite & distinctly different from many other Restaurants in Kolkata serving similar cuisines. The "personal touch" of the people attending the guests, starting from the Owner, Raju, to the stewards is such that one feels compelled to come here again & again. This restaurant does not boast of a STAR decor but the whole ambience just catches on for the connoisseur of good food......a MUST-VISIT joint for North Indian cuisine in Kolkata..!!

I am currently studying out of town...and whenever I come here I make it a point to have food here. If one is not looking for an amazing ambience, this is a food lover's paradise. Everytime I try different kebabs,..and today had the chicken pahari kebab and the bharwan aloogilafi and they were simply outstanding!!!!

Along with that, the naans were very soft, loved the mushroom matar masala and the raita and fresh lime were excellent as usual.

Overall it has, as always, been a great experience, and it is one of my favourite places to eat in town.

I am very surprised with some of the negative comments. yes it's a small place but I am was not looking for fine dining when I went there... I was looking for great food. I am hitting this joint for the past few months and they just serve awesome food. have chicken lasooni kebab.. mutton adrak ke punje and Kabul naan..... the host is very nice. I know the waiters were a bit odd but that problem has been solved.
it's a delightful place for great food. ... if one is looking for great chairs.... great ambience then lots on this city to choose from..... not this one.

will giv it two more  points just because of its food,otherwise would have rated it 1.5
for starters we ordered mutton adrak k punje,chicken lasooni kebab,the waiters suggested us to have them with kabuli naan n we followed.both the kebabs were big sized soft n juicy,the chicken was good but the mutton preparation was excellent with the sweet kabuli naan.its a must have here!

next for the mains, we chose cheese garlic naan with mutton jhal frezi.the mutton tasted well,and the naan....was full of cheese..yumm! another favourite!

the quality of food here is excellent,if you are coming in odd numbers,not a problem here because they also serve the kebabs at per piece rate...that was quite helpful as we went there in group of 3.the service time is average to quick.no taxes are charged.

now coming to the cons,the price they charge is not at all cheap..the place is not at all accessibile,you need to get down at kasba kfc or cheenikum n ask the local people to reach here.its in the first floor , a flat with two small rooms,each with 4-5 tables and  uncomfortable chairs.the ac doesnot work properly.even a restaurant in the terrace of the flat with open air dining option would have been better for the price they charge.either they should reduce their rates,or improve their ambience if not the location,or serve dishes with huge quantities!!
for nearby people,it can better be a take away place if you really want some delicous kebabs and naans irrespective of their price!

Visited Punjabee Rasoi last night for dinner and my experience only underlined my personal opinion that this place serves some of the best kebabs in the city. Also please make sure to book on weekends as this place is usually packed and you have people waiting outside for tables (thankfully my past experiences made me book in advance). Though this place is not on the main road as one of my dinner guests remarked that you can smell the kebabs from the turn-off itself and your nose leads you to Punjabee Rasoi. We had decided to stick to kebabs and roti's along with a dal for dinner and ordered the Tandoori Chicken which was wonderful, the Adrak ke Punje which were excellent as usual. The two new kebabs we sampled were Murg Khushnawa Kebab which was very good, its a chicken breast with a stuffing which is then put in the tandoor and roasted and the Mutton Boti Kebab which was melt in your mouth delicious. We combined these with the Kali Dal Tadka (super yummy) and various breads like Masala Kulcha , Cheese Kali Mirch Kulcha and the Cheese Garlic Naan (my personal favourite) . The only request that we made to Raju the owner was to increase the variety of deserts so that we could have a bit more choice than just Firni. 
Unlike earlier they have a good range of vegetarian items, we sampled the Palak Corn (compliments of Raju) which it was really nice.
Highly recommended to all the kebab - lovers of Kolkata !



----- 11 Oct, 2012 -----

I went there for a friends birthday and was really surprised .... the place is a little hard to find but once you do its worth the find, for sure..... some of the best kebabs in Kolkata and a meat lover's paradise ..... their chicken Malai Kebab and Adrak Ke Panje were to die for .... melt in your mouth .... loved the Dal Tadka and the naans and roti's  ... we were about 15 of us and they took very good care .... however they have very limited veg items except the dal , channa and paneer so if you have veggies in the group its a good idea to call in advance and inform them .... Every kebab lover should pay them a visit for sure. When we went there they did not accept cards so in case you plan to go make sure to either check with them or carry cash.

This is one of those places where the menu is very limited,ambience is just about okay,more like a bistro,but whatever is there in the menu is just out of the world! Some unconventional kebabs like chicken lasuni kebab and mutton adrak k punje which have become kind of signature dishes there,are just heavenly! After these two starters,we ordered malai naan (another rarity) with chicken reshmi butter masala which tasted good. The menu can be elaborated in the dessert section,no other qualms! Difficult to search,but zomato map will guide you well!

A great place to have some tasty kababs! The restaurant is nor very roomy or well-decorated. It has limited seating options. The exterior is unimpressive but the inside is clean and clutter-free. The best part about this eatery is the food.

We tried Chicken Lassoni kabab and mutton adrak kabab, along with kabuli naan. Believe me it's a heavenly combination. The kababs were soft, juicy and delicious, and the sweetness of the kabuli naan went well with them.

For main course we had mutton biriyani. It was not the best biriyani I had, but it was light and tasty.

I would love if the seating arrangement are made better, also they need to introduce some variety of drinks and desserts in their menu.

The Panir Tikka was simply marvellous! The Bharwan Aloo Gilafi although well cooked was quite bland and I would have liked a lot more flavour and zing in it. The accompanying chutney was just the right accompaniment. My friends freaked out on the Murg Lasuni Kebab.

The quality of Paneer is what sets this place apart from others. We had Palak Paneer and the chunks were very soft and that made all the difference. The Makhani Daal was of top quality and so was the Tadka daal. The Methi Matar Malai gave just the right touch of contrasting taste that was needed. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was what some of my friends were raving about

The breads served here are excellent and are far above the level of breads in most Park Street restaurants. The Cheese Kaali Mirch Kulcha was simply amazing as was the Pudina Paratha. 

While the place looks ordinary and has been spruced up over the years - it is the homeliness which makes you enjoy the place even more and keeps it affordable I guess! The service is good and so are the portions. The best part is the personal attention of the owners. Eleven of us paid a bill of Rs 3000/-

I am a regular visitor and aim to remain one. It is places like this which make Calcutta a Foodie' delight - amazing food at even more amazing prices

Try Murgh Lasuni kebab with Kabuli Naan, and you will remember it for a very long time.

This place is close to my home, beside Rajdanga ( now Geetanjali Stadium ).
Simple and neat, this is not a very roomy restaurant. Heard a lot about this place from friends and relatives.

So, I paid a visit, on a cold December night, and had Kabuli Naan with Lasuni Kebab.
It tasted fabulous. 

Looks can be deceiving, and don't have any preconceptions about the quality of food served here just by looking at the decor.

Heard a lot about it from a relative. Thus decided to visit it one fine day. Though it is located a bit in the interior, the place is not difficult to locate & worth going to. Their signature dishes are Chicken Lasunae  Kebab, Mutton Adrakhi kebab, Kabuli Naan & Dal Makhani. After visiting the place once, we gave three consequetive visits taking different friends & relatives. The food is too delicious & it's reputation is growing by the day just by a word of mouth.

WHOLESOME MEAL @ PUNJABEE RASOI
3 out of 5

If you are looking for innovative but authentic Punjabi and Mughlai dishes, Punjabee Rasoi is the place to be. The location of this restaurant might put off certain people; the place is a little troublesome to find as it is located in a slummy neighbourhood (my reason for giving it a 3). Nevertheless, this popular establishment ranks high among many restaurants serving North Indian cuisine here. Their fare is not only innovative but delicious and mouthwatering as well. They offer comfortable and well arranged sitting arrangements, albeit in a small area.

This small establishment, located near Geetanjali Stadium, serves some of the best selections of kebabs in the city. Some of their popular and house kebab bestsellers are chicken lasooni kebab, mutton adrak ke panje, chicken khushnawa kebab and fish tikka. The kebabs are juicy and soft and the taste lingers on even after they have melted in the mouth. It is also a well known fact that they make some of the most lightest and non greasy biryani preparations. Their biryani always leave a light feeling in your stomach as they do not use dalda in their cooking at all (this is a HUGE plus if you understand how biryani is meant to be cooked and how much damage dalda does to our system). At the same time, the food does not lose its flavour even if you reheat it the next day. 

For vegetarians, their pulao items like paneer pulao and jeera pulao are also worth considering. Equally well prepared are their flatbreads like nans, kulchas, parathas and rotis. Among the many nans on offer it is their Kabuli nan and garlic cheese nan that have a loyal fan following. Other popular side dishes for consumption are mutton jhal frezi, aloo bharwan, corn palak, dal makhani, chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken tikka butter masala and egg tarka. 

The service is prompt and efficient, and the servers are well mannered and friendly.  The food portions are ample especially at the price that they charge.

excellent food quality.....:)
we ordered lahsuni kebab,garli cheese nun, kabuli nun, chicken biriyani, mutton jhal frezi, thumbs up.
lahsuni kebab is the best kebab i have ever tasted in my whole life...
garlic cheese nun is the best nun i have tasted in my whole life...
kabuli nun was a dissapointment...it was a bit too sweet...so if u r planning to have it, go for a super spicy side dish with it...
chicken biriyani...was very light...and subtle....and wid no dalda....absolutely healthy...
mutton jhal frezi is a good comibination wid rotis...but i felt it was a bit over priced...
our total bill was rs680 for 3 person.

For guys who rate a girl's quality over their beauty and love the delicacy and taste of cuisines more than the ambiance of a restaurant, Punjabee Rasoi is the place for you.
  Secluded from the rather noisy RB connector, the place is appeasing and the aroma is enough to usher you the gates of Punjabee Rasoi, in case you don't find it. The true tastes of Punjabee and Mughlai dishes have been recreated with innovation and cooked with perfect quantities of spices, love and affection. 
Must-try-dishes:
For Veggies:-
Aaloo bharwan
corn-palak
daal makhni

For Real eaters[ ;) ]
Lasooni kabab
khushnawa kabab
fish tikka
adrak k panje
reshmi butter masala

Visit the place once and I am sure, you'll find yourself recommending it to others just like me.

Had dinner today and liked it from the perspective of the food quality. Also it is not at all expensive however I would not suggest this if you are looking for good ambience.

The food is mouth watering I would reccomand all the foodies to try it out veg or non veg its simply outstanding especially the soft cheese garlic naan and the daal makhani is out of the world 
The adhraki mutton de panjay and the mutton mukhmali are the best and is served hot. 
The pahari chicken and the chicken lasuni kababs just melt in your mouth. 
For vegetarians the tandoori mushroom , aloo , gobi are just to die for and just amazing. 
If u looking for something amazing to eat you should go here

Well, I have heard about this place so much from so many friends that I fell for the bait today. Seeing the location, I was bemused that "It's a Times Food Award Holder". But looks may be deceptive, so I went inside. Being  a Veggie, I ordered a a Veggie Staple-"Paneer Tikka". To be honest, the dish didn't do justice to the hype & reputation of the place. I have had better & much better "Paneer Tikka" at several places. I was little down as I had come with very high expectations. But for Home parcel I ordered what they suggested - Dal Makhani, Palak Corn, Kabuli Nan and my choice of Cheese Kali Mirch Kulcha(since it sounded a little different). 

Not to be biased, the parcel was shared with 6 ppl & expected their comments. The discussion resulted as:
Dal Makhani - Top Class, I mean it will qualify easily in top 2 or 3, if not the best.
Palak Corn - A tasty dish, it rarely comes out as good as this, my daughter's favourite dish. She really liked it.
Kabuli Nan - Soft but little too sweet for my taste buds.
Cheese Kali Mirch Kulcha - Couldn't make out the difference, as it missed the flavour. I think I was served a normal kulcha by mistake.

But overall, I guess it is out and out a Non Veg Paradise.

This place had already made to the big league of authentic indian cuisine. This quaint little place serves arguably one of the best kebabs in this city. Try out their signature 'mutton adraki kebab" and "chicken lasooni kebab".
Especially i can vouch that the mutton prepared here is one of the best in Kolkata - succulent and juicy yet tender - just perfect.
This place also has separate dine-in area and is also equally famous for take-away and home delivery. Location can be a bit difficult - tucked beside the lane of Kasba Geetanjali stadium.
Definitely give it a try if one has a penchant for kebabs.
Have been there numerous times over the past few years - definitely always a 5-er!

Serves up the best Kababs in town (absolutely no two ways about it!). 

The signature "Adrak ke Panje" and "Lasooni Kababs" are truly out of this world! The chef bakes a mean "Kabuli Naan" as well. Surprising as it may sound (for a place like Kolkata), the vegetarian fare is outstanding and  absolutely deserves a try even if you have pledged your allegiance to the non vegetarian crusade. The "Cauliflower Kababs" simply melt in your mouth, and the "Corn Palak" is worth multiple visits!
That they do not serve alcohol is a dampener, but does not tilt the balance away from making a visit or ordering in..
Add the ever smiling Raju (who owns the joint) helping you out with customized orders making this cosy little joint an absolute winner.

Highly Recommended!

Went for dinner to Punjabee Rasoi﻿ tonight......tucked deep inside a residential locality of Kasba this restaurant might be a bit hard to locate for the first timers. But once you have done that hard job its time to try out Murg Lehsuni Kebab, Mutton Adrak ke Panje, Kabuli Naan, Kadhai Paneer and an array of mouth watering dishes. The kebabs were delicious , succulent and just perfectly cooked. The kind of melt-in-your-mouth experience you will be hardpressed to find in most of the restaurants. The Kabuli naan was equally an unique preparation. Soft , buttery and crunchy. This is a kind of restaurant which relies on the quality of food rather than show-off. Trust me and place your bets on this one. You will love to come back again and again.

Definitely the best place for kebabs and starters in Kolkata. I am a pure vegetarian and I called for bharwa aloo, it was simply outstanding. Ordered for Dal Makhni, PaneerButter Masala in the main course and my friends ordered for a Chicken Bharta Masala. The Paneer was the softest paneer Ive ever had, The Dal was at par with any five star Dal . My friend ended up eating the entire Chicken. The breads were extremely well prepared, soft and fluffy. The owner later came up to us and served each of us a spoon of corn palak, just for us to try out . I have never has better corn palak. In fact I generally do not order Corn Palak at a restaurant, however i regretted not ordering it. Punjabee Rasoi is definitely gonna be my regular joint. Superb Place !

Undoubtedly, the best North Indian food in Calcutta. One of the rare places that serve up equally delicious vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian food.The location may not feature as commonly on one's scheme of things, as say Park Street does, but it really isn't difficult to find and is easily accessible. More importantly, the impeccable quality of their food makes any travel to them, absolutely worth it! The kebabs(lasuni kebab, adrak ke panje, khushnuma kebab) come highly recommended as do the Indian breads( kabuli naan, parantha et al). The palak corn and the tandoori gobi are remarkably good.The meticulous attention to the quality of the food is also carried forward in their attention to the diner's specific palate. An excellent service tradition.

Unassuming place hidden away on the RB connector, but the food is stunning. The crispest, most succulent kebabs, served up instantly, are well worth coming for.
 Try the beginner's platter--it's the best way to get into the cuisine & they're very generous in allowing you to pick your kebabs according to number of heads, rather than number of plates. 
Only negative is that they don't take cards, but ATMs are handy nearby, so not too bad.

Yesterday was my maiden visit to Punjabee Rasoi and wow that was indeed a treat. Though the outlook of the place was not fav but the food was incomparably awesome. Started with Murg Lasuni Kebab and Mutton Adrak Ke Punje which were devilishly tasty .That was not all the Mutton Biriyani was also a delight. After long time had Biriyani which was not drenched in oil.

Even after this power packed lunch, the Firni was good enough for us to start over a competition amongst my teammates. I am sure they would share the same thought as mine. Will definitely come over again to taste these mouthwatering foods again and again.

This is an awesome joint for all kebab lovers, the mutton adraki punje and the chicken khusnawa kebab are to die for. The main course also has a couple of lip smacking delicacies like the Rogan josh and the Tandoori  chicken butter masala. This place is quite consistent with its good service and is worth every penny spent.

Been to this place atleast 4-5 times in the last 6 months after discovering it. That is something , coz the place is around 8 -9 km from my home!! The place is quite small, with a big crowd in the weekends, so it is best to opt for takeaway.
I just love their kabuli nan and corn palak.Also, I have developed a taste for their biryani, which is extremely light, non greasy, yet full of flavours.
The best part of their food is their cooking medium. They donot use dalda, hence the food is extremely light, and doesnt lose its flavour even after reheating on the next day.

The best and most scrumptious North Indian food in Kolkata. I go there at least once a week. Lip-smacking food for both Vegetarians and Non-Vegetarians.
For starters the bharva aloo that they serve in a foil and the tandoori gobi get you into the groove after which, the dal tadka, corn palak and Kabuli naan combo is incredible. 
You will leave this place a couple of Kgs heavier for sure.

I have been there many times...I go there especially for the fantastic Lasooni Kababs....they are simply mouthwatering. The FIsh Tikka will surely melt in your mouth,,,but the only thing is,,its located in an very odd place,,Let me help you..,you have to get in the left lane before Gitanjali Stadium and then you have to take the first left and go ahead and then right,,,,then you will find it. The Chicken Tikka Butter Masala is undoubtedly my fav. there. The Egg Tarka with Tawa Roti is another great one,.,,their food quality will surely bring a smile to your face. Ambience is simple. Please visit there,,,suggestion goes to all.

Please don't even think of dining-in here. They prefer take-aways and so do we. But the food is just amazing. The kebabs (Murg Lahsuni & Mutton Adrak Ke Punj) are addictive. The Biriyani is not too bad either. Service is pretty good, although the ambience & decor is not worth a mention. This is one eating joint who concentrates on the food instead of the tertiaries.

This place, though hidden from view, is a good find for kebabs and North Indian food. Their Chicken Lasuni Kebab, Mutton Adrak ke Punje, Dal Makhani and Kulchas are a must try. The kebabs are succulent and melt in the mouth, while the Dal Makhani is authentic punjabi, cooked in generous portions of ghee. The service is also very prompt, and the staff is polite. The interiors can be improved a bit, but when the food is good, that ceases to matter. A must try for all kebab lovers.

Its been 3 yrs since Punjabee Rasoi started in my neighborhood , & since den it is serving hygienic & great quality foods . Though it is a stone throws dist. from my home , I still never order a home delivery , bcoz I don't like to miss a chance to meet the owner Mr. Raju , whom I fondly call Raju Bhai . He is a very hospitable person . 
Their kebabs are all so yummy & the Chil-Maan Biryani is 1 of my favorites . Though the rates are a bit high , but the foods are worth the cost . They use the best quality ingredients available in the market & the foods are cooked in a v. clean &  hygienic environment . The kitchen is still as neat & tidy as it was , when it newly opened .

Its a bit difficult to locate & you wouldn't probably go there unless you have heard about it from someone who has been there already & once you have heard you would definitely go as the food is very good.

Location: It is downside, difficult to find, its behind KFC, you have to take left after crossing KFC & again left into the 2nd lane & then you might be able to find it.

Ambiance: It is ok & you might find it a bit crampy, so ambiance is not what you are going there for sure. Its a flat converted into a eatery; would be the right word for the place.

Food: Food is very good & no doubt about it. Enough options for Veg & non veg crowd. The food isint very expensive either. One should definitely try the tandoori paratha & the malai kulcha in rotis. Overall food is very good & there are no downsides over that.

Overall : Gets a 4 on 5 because ambience isint that great & staff is ok. Overall if you can live with the interior & can find the place, it is worth it.

whatever although the place is not too specious still not bad at all. decent interior calm nd quiet.
ok come to the main part the food. as recomanded by the waiter i tried chiken lasuni kebab which was jst mouth watering besides the muttn adrak ke punje was also good,soft nd delicious. dal makhani was good too as usual and the kabuli nan we tried was all full of nuts and other stuffz which was extremely delecious but a bit rich. 
price is a bit higher  but its really worthfull having a lunch or dinner over there if u look for real good kebab.

This place still amazes me even after 5 visits. Great Job guys. Retain the standard you've set for yourself. Be it with friends or family, its a nice place to have delicious food. First time, it was little hard to locate; so need some patience to steer around and reach his place. Once you find this place, you are sure to forget all effort with delicious food.

If you have a small place and really hammering your head on what you should do out of it, Punjabee Rasoi is the place to admire. In a small little place Raju and his people made a mesmerizing food joint. I would give 88800000.009 out of 10 to it's lasooni Kabab. Just simply amazing. Same is with the giger naan and other kakabs and daal. The only negative is the Biryani. But who cares .. when you have so many good things to eat, I think you should not waste your time on Biryani.

Visited this little joint after reading an article on it. This place with a seating capacity of around 30 people is definately a delight for the kebab lovers.
The owner (Mr. Raju) recommended Chicken Lasuni Kebab which was delicious. Next came Adrak k Panje- tender and juicy pieces of goat ribs marinated with perfect mix of spices well done in the tandoor. The silken textured Dal Makkhani went really well with the Kabuli Naan- sweet in taste, soft inside topped with sprinkling nuts.We also gave their Biriyani a try. It maintains the Kolkata tradition of a  potato along with pieces of well cooked mutton.
Service was fast and efficient. Will revisit shortly.

Tucked away in the corner this restaurant has no fancy signage, no frontage. You will actually have to look for it very hard. On word of caution before you decide visiting this place - your credit and debit cards are of no use here, they only accept cash :o(. 
Once you step in do not be disappointed by its not so appealing interior, once you have tasted the food here you will be proud of your discovery. Murgh Lahsuni Kebab and nun from this place rocks...
