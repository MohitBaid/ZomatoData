Average food quality. We had ordered two mutton dishes(Mutton kadai and Mutton Malai) which was very poor. The mutton pieces were so badly cooked, we could not even have a bit of it.

Good food served at an affordable price. The location of the reastaurant is an added advantage. The best item according to me is Corn Masala. The kebabs and tandoori items are really tasty.

Went for lunch. The chicken biriyani was ok and the quantity was sufficient for one. With butter roti and masala kulcha we had chicken butter masala which was great in taste and mutton keema which was too spicy.
The lime soda was served in clay cups (Matir Bhanr).

This eatery is right across the street where i have worked for years so i have eaten here multiple times. The food here is really good but there have been times where when we ordered bulk food, the kebabs and tandooris were rather raw. Coming to the last time i ate here - with my wife for the first time while we were on a vacation to India, we were really impressed. We were not that hungry but still wanted to sample a few of their items. Ordered reshami kebab for appetizer and on the recommendation of the server their azad hind special chicken with garlic and butter naan. The items were so very tasty. The quantity of food is very good for the price they charge. Their specialty chicken was a thick curry of shredded chicken with boiled eggs, raw hugely diced tomatoes topped with omelette and cheese. We loved the food here and were full by the time we finished it up. We washed it down with a glass of masala soda. The bill was Rs 750 minus tips.

Visited the place on the 31st night. The main thing I liked about this place is it's still open at 3.00 of midnight. 
Now comming to the food quality 
Mutton biriyani - It was not worthy at any cost . The biriyani they served was firstly nither hot nor even warm. That was the worst part that we couldn't enjoy the food at all. So if you go be sure they serve you hot .

Overall the ratings for me are
Food : 1/5
Decorations:2/5
Service :2/5

I went there with a lots of hope for good food. But I’ll recommend not to go there. I’ll write why.
First, the menu. It wasn’t properly sectioned and therefore had to search for things that we want and finally had to ask the waiter about it.
The food. We had Reshmi kebab which was unexpectedly dry and overcooked. The chicken didn’t seem to be very fresh also.
The ambiance. It was cozy but the temperature wasn’t right. We felt a little cold as we sat there. Throughout we ate, they behaved normal. But as we asked for the bill, the only question they had was if were going to pay by cash or card. And we kept sitting. After asking for it thrice someone came up and said we can’t accept card right now. After that thing I straight went to the counter and asked if it was no way feasible to pay via card or online. That guy was like, “Ask who served you.” Man, they don’t know any hospitality. And when I asked the guy who served us, he was like, “We don’t have the machine (EVM).” Whoa!
Very cool!
I’ll never visit Azad Hind Dhaba. Nothing I found to be good here.

Located just beside the Globsyn Building, Sector- v, Azad Hind Dhaba is pretty popular. I had visited them twice and it was just decent experience.
Today, went there for some quick bite and ordered chicken roll. The person sitting on the counter informed me that chicken roll is not available. After that, another customer ordered five chicken rolls and this time they tool the order without any problem. Observing this I was not satisfied. They just lied and refused to take my order as I was ordering only one roll. I have not expected this kind of behaviour.

Visited this place after a long time. Service time is normal. Food quality is satisfactory. Their Biryani ain't good. Masala kulcha is served hot and soft. Love their mutton rara. It's a spicy gravy with juicy mutton pieces. Portion is decent. Tried their kadhai chicken too, decent to taste, has 4 medium sized pieces of chicken has a tangy touch to it. The mutton liver fry we had ordered, ain't that great but works as a decent appetizers.

We ended up here on a Saturday night.
Seating was available right away.
The service was friendly but they got us the wrong order once and ended up taking quite a bit of time with some dishes.
The ambience was very nice.
The food is more expensive than its worth.
Its quite tasty but the quantity is not worth the price.
Dal makhani was ohkay.
Kashmiri dum aloo were ohkay.
Malai kofta was good.
Mushroom masala was not worth it.
Peas pulao was the best dish.
Aloo butter masala was yum.
Its worth visiting for sure if you are looking for north indian but they have got to increase their quantity for what they charge.

The food is good but could have been better when compared with the pricing. 
The avg pricing of rs 550 for two needs to changed. We ordered 3 naan,  chicken tikka butter masala and 2 fresh lime soda. And the bill was around Rs 700.
Moreover, a series of items where not available .....
The staff are polite and welcoming.
They let us sit for quiet long,  even after we had paid our bill post lunch and was waiting for a frnd of ours to reach and have her lunch there.

Once a decent eatery, deteriorating day by day.

Located opposite to the Technopolis, this restaurant is loosing it's sheen day by day.

Last visited on a friend's birthday and experience was pathetic. Ordered Chicken Tandoori Kebab, Masala Kulcha and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala.
The Tandoori Kebab was very dry. In Masala Kulcha, I could rarely sense masalas, rather it seemed like Aloo Kulcha. We informed this to the Manager, to which he reluctantly replied that the head chef cook had gone to his native place. The Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala too was improperly cooked and was rubbery.

Food - 1.5/5

This was my 1st visit at this particular outlet. Nothing much to say about the decor, it is quite decent. The behaviour of the staffs were not up to the mark but no complains regarding food. There were 3 of us, we ordered a chicken Biriyani which a decent. Chicken Kali Mirch (Extremely spicy & hot) extactly what you want when you are a bit down with cold. Tandoori Roti ( It almost became like papad within 2 mins of serving) later on we ordered for butter nun which was amazing. Overall the experience was decent and definitely worth a 2nd visit.

Last Saturday I ordered 2 kadhai chicken and 2 chicken butter masala. I had greater expectations of the taste because I had heard a lot of people talking about it. But it wasn't up to the mark. I love spicy food, kadhai chicken was very spicy but the spices couldn't make it much tasty. Rather the chicken butter masala was better made of minced chickens. The amount was good. Enough for 2. 

Overall it was good, actually ok but didn't satisfy me as I heard so much of azad hind dhaba

Very basic place with basic decor... Good that it has AC, which is a must in Kolkata..

Decent interiors. Good proportions of food. We were two people and 3 Butter Naans and one Shahi Paneer was enough to stop the stomach from rumbling. I would have given a rating of 4 had the lassi been better. Weirdly enough it has been better on other days, yet yesterday's lassi was barely average and no different from the ₹20 lassi you get anywhere(they charge ₹60 for the lassi). Just that the quantity was more.

Ambiance: 3/5
Food: 4/5
Lassi: 3/5
Staff behavior: 3/5. They appear confused all the time. Should learn how to be hospitable towards customers.

Quick date!

Well being a professional corporate dummy, it ain't easy for ya to make time for enormous date always. So when you find a good place to eat on your way you are succumbed to go for it. Like we did.

We went for a quick dinner date after office. As have limited time in our pocket, we ordered quick for mutton biryani, paneer mushroom with baby corn polao and boneless mutton chilly gravy. What I find pleasant was that pieces of mutton we're well boiled and too soft to eat which is hard to find in restaurants these days. And rest food we're good to refill your tummy. 
It's almost 700/- for two. So you can go for it if you and your pocket is in hurry.

Pathetic restaurant.Food is worst along with the service.Ordered biryani which was just scented rice and a piece of chicken without any raita or gravy.The chilly chicken was also not at all good and undercooked but they charge exorbitant pricing for the awfully cooked dishes.And last but not the least the service is just pathetic. They charge you service charges along side vat.But when we refused to provide tip for the poor service,the waiter behaved rudely.Clearly one of the worst restaurant.

We had ordered for home delivery from Azad Hind Dhaba Sector 5.
None of the dishes were tasty.
Chicken Bharta was stale. It was all wasted.
Kabuli Naan, Masala kulcha, etc. were not at all as it should be.
The quality of Azad Hind dhaba has degraded, I would rate it 1 out of 5 based on the quality of food.

Went here long ago when Zomato was not even launched ,, Early in 2012 and had a p;ate of biriyani with chaap along with raita , The service dated back at that time was really nice and cozy , And the food was dammn tasty at that point of time
                    

The second review is not for this joint but for the old AZAD HIND DHABA(located nearby the Millenium City, changed to Rang De Basnti Dhaba now) that joint really refresh the memories because of the tasty breakfast contaning Big Kachoris with Daal and dahi raita and Big Jalebis only a cost of 30 rs back in 2011 ,, That was really amazing and tasty

Visit if you are interested in regular kebabs and other mughlai dishes at very reasonable and persuasive prices. Quite accesible as it is located on the Salt Lake to New Town connector right across the road from Technopolis.
Service is quick and staff know their job well.
The preparations lean on the heavier side and portions are sozeable. Discretion is recommended while placing the order.

Took our order after half an hour and took another half an hour to tell us that the food we ordered was not available. In addition the place was hot and they did not even acknowledge it forget about doing anything to resolve it. Needless to say we came out without having a gram of food. I guess they are better off selling snacks items.

I am pretty sure this is the worst restaurant in the region and would give other despicable eateries a run for their money to bag the worst restaurant in the city award. All sarcasm put aside, nothing good was visible in the single time I visited the place. To put everything in context, lets start with the worthless service they have. They serve cold food, half cooked food, pre-cooked heated food (including kebabs) which can be used to kill people by throwing at them and finally they serve the salad not eaten by previous customers to others. I will give my instance. On ordering the reshmi kebab (which was as hard as a cricket ball possibly) they served the salad where the lime was half squeezed and had a few grains of biriyani rice. The minute we brought this in the waiter's attention, he was about to give some pathetic excuse when another group of hungry wayfarers pointed out the chicken dish had one half eaten piece of chicken. Poor chicken I say, being cooked and eaten twice after death. Jeez. Finally since hunger had us cornered pretty badly, we ordered a simple cicken bharta and roti. I am not exaggerating, but I wish I slapped my noisy neighbor with that roti and break his face so that he wont play loud music at 2 in the night. It would have done the trick. Oh forgot the chicken bharta. Not much complaints with that except it tasted pretty ordinary. Well, thanks to the Almighty for the edible bharta

Old School eatery with a bit history...This is a place which will remind you of the restaurants of 90's. 
I don't understand the reason for its low rating in zomato .. The service is dhaba style, warm and rustic.
Don't go expecting a fine dining experience... it's a Dhaba proper highway side dhaba hence the food taste and cooking is similar to it.
It's a no frills place which is reasonably priced and has big servings. With authentic north Indian cuisine.

Since the restaurant is close to my office I had ordered a non veg combo meal last week. I was happy with the items present in the combo. It had a portion of salad,raita,a veg item,a chana dish, dal makhani, chicken butter masala,butter naan, veg pulao and a jalebi. The combo costed me 175+taxes. Being happy I ordered the same combo again today but was extremely disappointed. The combo states dal makhani and all I got was a pool of yellow dal( I don't eat yellow dal), the chicken portion from 4 pieces came down to 3, they also didn't give any jalebi or any other sweet item with the combo this time even though it was mentioned in the menu. Order was on time and served hot but unfortunately didn't enjoy it half as much today.

A typical North Indian restaurant, specializing on the Paratha and Chicken dishes, Azad Hind Dhaba is just a minutes walk from College more, sector V. It's pretty obvious from their name, what cuisine they serve. We had their signature malai kebabs for starters and then Masala Kulcha accompanied by chicken butter masala. The food was really good so was the ambiance. The price was pocket friendly too.

Food ordered is quite decent. Ordered chicken biryani whose taste was quite good but still the rice seemed overcooked. Butter paneer masala was good in all respect. Chicken Rogan Josh didn't had that authentic taste of the Kashmiri Rogan Josh it seemed to have a confused taste of a mix of masala. Butter nan was good crunchy as I like it. Overall I think the service was decent but not upto the mark as expected.

The restaurant is just perfect for having a dinner in city. Well located in sector V. Their kebabs especially reshmi kebabs and malai kebabs are just mouth watering also tandoori chicken taste good. Its juicy, soft and spicy. Biryani is light and tasty. Chicken rolls are also very popular. Hygienic preparations, good service, moderate pricing.  Advantage you can eat at late night hours. They have couple of branches across the city. Ambiance is ok. Overall a good dhaba to try mughlai food.

Azad Hind Dhaba is my favourite dhaba of all time.  It is hardly a dhaba because it looks fancy, has air conditioning and is fabulous and  pocket friendly. My standard order is a plate of Butter Chicken to myself with Garlic Naan and Thumbs Up to wash it down. The Butter Chicken is super delicious and melty as is the Naan. I definitely recommend the place to Butter Chicken lovers!

It was disappointing to see brands getting devalued. The food was horrible. The restaurant decor seems to be filled with spider web all around n if u r lucky u will find cockroach too! Food is served on shabby plates. Service is delayed. We ordered for butter roti n chicken malai tikka butter masala. The quantity they served could only feed two where we were three. The gesture of the waiters were worst! They have an attitude like they r doing a sympathy on us by serving. Horrifying experience, hence would never recommend any one to visit. Such degradation of a brand was truly unexpected! Management should take some stern measures to improve the situation.

The first time I went in was maybe 10 min to 12 midnight. Turt me, at that odd hour no place can serve you any better food than this small air-conditioned dhaba, just opposite to Technopolis. The soft butter nun and chicken bharta really made my night, to say nothing of the delicious Malai Kebab. But let's admit it the service is really slow.

I was really happy with the meal so I decided upon going there for Lunch as well, coz I was staying in the vicinity for the next day. The service really disappointed me. I had higher expectations from the Biriyani but I was served cold Biriyani and the chicken was hard to tear. It was clear that they were serving from last night's left over although a staff denied upon being asked. The lights and AC were turned off as if I was in a closed restaurant. Well I understand, maybe their cream crowd starts pouring in from eveing but when the place mentions the open hours then they should be ready to serve equally to the morning guests as they do in case of the evening ones.

The restaurant was clean and service is okayish too. One thing that is weird is they don't serve Lassi??! I had to opt for the mango shake which was truly a treat to the tastebuds.

Decent restaurant in Sector 5. It is usually crowded on a weekday but since I visited it on a Sunday, it was relatively empty. Visited the place with 2 other colleagues (one of them was a vegetarian, hence the paneer tikka for starters !!!). Coming to food, it was achari paneer tikka for starters. It was good, 6 large pieces of soft paneer with a tangy marinade. Then we ordered kadhai murgh, kabuli naan, butter roti and sarson ka saag. The saag was really good. The chicken was decent too... but the size of chicken pieces were dismal. Loved the kabuli naan which had nuts on top it. All in all a good restaurant to have to quickly satiate your hunger pangs.

This place is always crowded specially in lunch time despite its over priced average tasted food.
It has a nice decor mainly in the upstairs.
Coming to foods all foods tasted standard, not finger licking. Service is very slow. Be aware if you ordering for home delivery.
Firstly they include huge taxes and secondly they mess with food portion.
Once we ordered mutton rogan josh with bone but they delivered boneless one and in stead of 4 pieces there were only 3 pieces of mutton and one tomato in every container. It was so sour that we hardly could taste any gravy.
Overall it's wise to avoid this place specially when you have so much options in sector V.

It's really shocking to see such low votes for Azad Hind.

This place is my favourite place for North Indian food. It's better than the few famous ones around.

What I normally order - 

Dum Aloo
Dal Makhani
Paneer Butter Masala
Kulcha
Garlic Naan
Masala ThumsUp

No complaints at all !

There are 2 sections. The upper one is better than the lower one.

Word of advice - Should work on the lower section.

Worst Restaurant I have ever seen. Very bad behaviour. No care of their costumers. No management. I personally suffered with the behaviour of their management. Once I visited the restaurant with my family of 4 persons. After waiting up to 30 minutes, they gave me a seat. But I requested another seat which was going to vacant after sometime as my little kid had slept by the time. But they did not provide me that seat where as it was given to two young boys. When I complained the same at their manager, he told me 'I can't do anything, also told me if your kid has slept then why do you come to restaurant? You should go to your home. Then I left the place without having dinner.

I did not understand where was my fault? Is it wrong to ask for a comfortable table when I require it. If that table was being given to any family then it would not hurt me. I was with my family, but that table given to two younger boys.

Worst worst worst behaviour

Quick lunch and to satisfy hunger we popped into the restaurant and the food turned to be amazing... we jumped straight to the main course ordered for rotis and naans followed by mutton kheema mutter (lamb mince with pea), chicken dopyaza & egg dopyaza, special dal fry... 
the food arrived on time...the ingredients wer fresh and the spices where not to strong... how ever the chicken was a bit under done.. apart from it the food was quite good..
Service is ok... restaurant was partially full.. mainly corporate clientele and teenagers... 
interiors is good but lighting is bit dark.. there is no music so it's kinda boring as well but the food compensates for all... also at the end we ordered for lassi... and the balance of sweetness and sourness was perfect..

Coming to the food, we had Garlic Nan, Butter Chicken and Chicken Do pyaza. The food is undoubtedly very good! Its delicious. But... the staff is too lazy. First of all, none of them bothered to give the menu card..we had to ask for it twice and then one of us had to go the reception to have one. The service was on the slower side. And then they did a mistake while returning the balance. The rating could have improved but the staffs aren't working how they should be.

It was nabami night that we visited this place. Plus points- The location was too good. Also we did not have to wait for too long to get a table. 
Minus points-I understand that it was the pujas and the pressure on the staffs were too high. But i believe that any restaurant should keep up their standard come what the situation may. We had ordered for masala kulcha,butter roti,egg bhurji,tarka,chicken reshmi butter masala,salads and fresh lime soda. The tastes of the food was way too ordinary. They were simply bland. We could not taste any spices or anything of the sort. Also the service was very late. 
The decor of the place was likeable though. 
The chefs need a thourough training i guess.

Convenient location for having food if your office is located in Technopolis. This place is never really crowded and they serve ordinary north Indian food. What I found best are the kebabs.
Seekh kebab, Chicken Reshmi kebab and Mutton tikka kebab.

The dhaba is quite good ..
 Food is also all right

 Not tooo good or delicious but to the extent as a dhaba its more tgan enough and at that price range.... though the dishes taste quite different.. so i ordered schezwan chicken but as we know ot os normally spicy..but it tasted sweetish ...so i was disappointed as i wanted some thing spicy...tikka masala is ok..... chilly chicken again also tastes different....
. And i also tried tandoori cicken but it wasnt properly cooked... it was veryy dry... not juicy which i like most... as far as ratings
Service : 3/5
Food:2/5
Ambience:2/5.

Well, 200* is always a special for anyone – be it Sachin in Cricket or be it Mohit on Zomato (Too much exaggeration …… I guess). On similar grounds, I wanted my 200th dine-in to be special also!

Walked a mile from my office to this lesser known outlet of Azad Hind Dhaba, which is conveniently based near Technopolis in Sector 5, Saltlake. Ambience is a mediocre and size of the place is big. Since I wanted to have something not heavy, I opted for a Veg Paneer roll for lunch (instead of the stereo-typed Dal Makhani and Naans)! The roll was served in 8-10 minutes and was 1 of the better ones I have seen till date – a 4.5/5 for presentation. Size also was great, so was the stuffing – lachcha onions, paneer cubes, boiled potato, carrot slices and chopped green chillies – hard to believe that all this for just 60 bucks! Roll was crisply fried, however, oil content was somewhat high, and nevertheless, the roll was great!

Prices are pretty reasonable and service is fine, I wish them all the best for their future endeavours!

I love this place. The ambience of this place is awesome. Food is awesome and service is also good. I feel the main thing is that the lead time they take is bit more than the other restaurants. Whenever I got to saltlake I surely eat in this place as I feel the food is very good of this restaurant. Last time we had Chicken Biriyani, Salad, Butter Nun, chicken Bharta and fresh lime soda. All the food were awesome and you can get a got taste of each dishes. I love this place . It's a must visit place for everyone.

Sorry for giving a worst review.Many reasons ahead :
1) It was a family dinner for us and being vegeterian its very difficult to decide something ,we decided and when we called the waiter he argued with us .
2)Water served was normal water ,i mean like directly from pond 😔
3)Waiter continuously insisted to order  this dish that dish and also promised to give refund if u dont like it which later he refused to provide ..😔
4)Then finally came the food 😖 which was again unexpectedly very bad 😭
5)The waiter didn't serve the food to us ..kept and went somewhere 😜
6)Pickles provided as complimentary 😂 that too like it was just before served to someone else 😔 
7)Lot more worse things happened .
Never never never to this restaurant .

Whilst deciding which place to go, a friend of mine strongly suggested this place. So we did. As for how it turned out, well it was a weekday dinner, and the place was half empty. This outlet felt more like a restaurant than a dhaba, but the food is pretty much AHD written all over it. Taste wise, everything was good and well done. We had skipped the starters, as I never like the starters at the AHD outlets. But the main course is always better. We had Garlic Naan, Rumali Roti for the breads, and Paneer do Piaza and Black dal. The Dal was thicker than I'd have liked, but it tasted good enough. But the paneer was just too good. IF you wanna try something here, I'd recommend the paneer. The service was however a bit slow, and I won't like to find out what would've happened had we came when the place was packed.
Overall, a value for money place, so long as you skip the starters.

Yet another AHD, placed just opposite to Technopolis in Sector V.
Had been there for dinner on a weekday.
They've got a nice spread of both vegetarian and non vegetarian items. I loved the Thai Soup and Butter Tandoori Chicken, other dishes were average. 
Interiors is done good, dhaba with a modern touch.
All in all, a good place with nice ambience, courteous staff and reasonably priced food and beverages.

They cheat people with the food that they give which are not at all fresh.. The only reason we are bound to visit this place is because it's opposite to our office.

Located opposite to indismart hotel in webel area of sector v, this is one more outlet of the entire chain of azad hind.
Good spacious seating area and a rural decor with modern chairs, quite a good fusion. Enough lighting, service was prompt but the servers looked dull and out of place.
Chicken tandoori and malai tikka kebab was yummy! Perfectly cooked which just came out on one pull of fork. Biryani aroma was very overpowering, spoiled my taste but rice, aloo and chicken cooked alright. Kebabs, chicken in gravy and naans are recommended.

So I was put up in a hotel.right across this place during my official visit to Kolkata... So this was the most accessible place for a late night dinner.
Looks very ethinic, with decor made of bamboos, pots and Rajasthani looking artifacts...
The service is slow but yet courteous...
The food definitely very average... We ordered for malai Kofta, daal makhni, and veg masala... With butter rotis and jeera rice... All very average.. nothing exceptional...
I sure had better options if it would have been a decent hour and patience left to go to one post a hectic day at work.
Definitely not again...
For the rest who had good food tonight....
@HAPPY BURPING !!!

Would have given this an even lower rating if not for the excellent roganjosh. The place was buzzing with bees, water was everywhere, and Ac was not working. The Roganjosh is a very hot and spicy dish which will make your eyes bleed and breathe fire. Coupled with the Naan it is an excellent food choice.

This review comes from someone who's tried out almost all the branches, multiple times. The thing with Azad Hind is they have good days and bad days, like most restaurants I guess, but the inconsistency is way too glaring to miss. For example, I had ordered Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Kadhai Paneer and Butter Naans on one instance and they were all good, gone back to order the same things next afternoon but the taste wasn't the same. 

On good days, their meat dishes, rotis, and parathas can be worth the price; nothing to write home about, though. Service can be slow on busy days. Overall, an average restaurant. There are better places that serve dhaba food in Kolkata.

Being a veggie ordered kadai panner, daal makhni, the kadai paner was too spicy, daal, bread's okay. It has just a manager, a waiter and a helper for 20 odd tables, so you can understand the experience, had to call 4-5 times for anything made us shout at the management for not responding even after ordering, even the glasses provided was full of dust like a glass used after a month. The place though has some good interiors but not so great food, with Raunak Dugar

This place close to my MTS office was like our regular thing during lunch..Due to lot of scheduled meetings mostly in afternoon we hardly used to have time for lunch & so this used to be our place for some quick chicken or egg roll..
We used to get these rolls quickly (which was made outside itself) & carry it along to office but when we used to  get inside for dine in it used to be very time taking and that's why we used to avoid..Tried their biryani, kebabs, sabji,etc & most of the items used to be oily on and spicy on a higher side..So another reason for avoiding this place for dine in..

Interior is ok types but not very clean..Although the time taken is little higher here but the staff is quite courteous..

Ambience =3/5
Food =2.5/5
Service = 2.5/5
Staff = 4/5

So, if you have time you can try paneer tikka & definitely their chicken anda roll..

Have tried almost all the chicken items & few veg kebabs too - tandoori aalo & Kashmiri Pulav are worth mentioning. Even the rolls( chicken/ egg chicken/cheese chicken) are delicious . My lonely Sunday nights end well only for the home deliveries from here😃😃

I'm rating it purely on the basis of it's ambience and nothing else. The food sucked. Biryani had more oil and less taste. Below average Kebab. Slow service. Not so courteous staff.

Azad hind close to college was a regular adda, that's where most of our quick lunch meets happened. The service to regulars was nice, though they would not as warm with others. Interiors are decent though the place has hygiene issues. Coming to food, it was high on oil and spice always but we had become accustomed to it. My picks were the peas pulao,bharta,paneer tikka and keema with naan. Not a resturant I would choose to go and dine though.

We go to these place whenever we feel like having anda tadka or tandoori chicken. Good for office crowd, it has a spacious sitting area. Service is prompt. Food is good but sometimes you just have to take it as law of average. Try the masala thums up if you have not tried it yet.

Location:If you're coming from Sector 5 and intend to get down at Technopolis bus stop,they'll drop you right infront of this restaraunt.
Decor:Well,unlike Rang de basanti,this place hasn't even made an effort to live upto the 'dhaba' part of the name,atleast decorwise.That said,the ambience is basic yet clean and air-conditioned.You could easily come in for a casual dinner here with friends or family.
Food:Have eaten here twice.Once for an elaborate lunch with biryani,butter naans and chicken tikka masala et al.All these dishes were just a notch above average but definitely palatable.On another occasion,my friend and I were extremely low on cash but didn't want to eat junk and this place came to our rescue.We got a plate of chicken kassa with some tandoori rotis and the experience wasn't good at all.
Verdict:Dhaba food should be finger-licking good at affordable prices.While this place takes care of the latter part rather well,I wouldn't vouch for the food as Haji Ali next door serves much better food at lesser prices.

Pathetic place. Pathetic service. Rude and ill mannered waiters and a very noisy place. This looks like a local theka. When we asked for another menu, the waiter replied "1 hi se kaam chalao". After they got us our bottle of pepsi, we realised that it was already open and used by someone else. After we raised objection, the waiter then replied " vo masala thums up k liye use hua tha. Bacha ko pata nai tha". He then replaced the bottle. While watching India vs Bangladesh, a waiter had stood right in front of me so i politely said "bhaiya zara side..dikh nai raha h" to which the waiter replied "dekhna kya h..chaukka hi toh mara h". After we were done with our dinner, my friend wanted some lemons and so he asked the waiter for it. This time, thankfully I saw the waiter, who went to a table where people had already eaten, took one of their used plate, placed lemons and brought it to us. That was the final thing. Being a cheap dhaba, i could endure mannerless waiters but this was the  last nail in the coffin. After this, we paid the bill and gave 10 bucks as tip (i was against it. I told my friend not to leave even 10 bucks because this place did not deserved even 10). Post this we went to our car where my friend told us that the waiter abused us when we were leaving. The words were " yeh lao woh lao aur tip khali 10 rs bho**** ka bhen****". I wanted to go back and hit the shit out of that guy but my friend drove and did not want to create a scene. 

At the end, we decided never to enter this outlet. U guys can decide for yourself. 

P.S. : some waiters were dressed as if they are truck drivers.

Very small outlet.Pathetic Service, very noisy restaurant. You will feel like you are sitting in a local beer bar. Asked for butter naan, one paneer item, one mushroom item and a chicken item(don't remember the name).All looked same, food quality is average. Asked for a green salad and they gave us pieces of onions not even sliced, cucumber and tomato that's it. When asked about it they repiled " Sir staff kam Hai isiliye aapko isise chalana hoga". We cant help. Barbeque area is outside the restaurant. There are other other North Indian restaurants or Dhaba which serves way better food than this. 

Not Recommended

It has been office small lunch out place for long. Initially (3 yrs back) food was not so good but now at least few dishes are good. Would definitely suggest to try the Azad hind special chicken (shredded chicken). Kadhai chicken/ Kadhai mutton is also good. Would prefer to have naan or kulcha over any rice dish here.

I wish I can rate them below 1. My maid couldn't come today, so I downloaded Zomato & thought of something good. Since my family prefers Indian food I choose Azad Hind Dhaba. Paid online & the food was within 30 mins. Hungrily I unpacked the good & the food quality was poor. (Pics attached)

I regret ordering from them. I'm never ordering or having food there.

Visited this place today as we were looking for a good north Indian cuisine near sector 5.. So went in there around 7p.m. and found it to be almost full. We were 3 so got our seats easily.
Then cme d worst part. After sitting for more dn 20 mins als no waiter came to attain us but rather they were busy watching India vs. Sri Lanka match on tv. We had to call them then they arrived to give d menu card and then took the order..
Service was ok within time.. The quality of food is i will say good, not bad.. But can always be better..
Ambience was quiet ok.. 
That's all folks untill next time.. :)

We have been going to this some place for quite some time now. We went yesterday hoping for some alfresco dining. But unfortunately they have removed outdoor seating, so we had to sit inside. Coming to the food, everything was well made. Special mention to crispy chilli mushroom which had a distinctive ginger taste which made it different and tasty. I would recommend rumali roti as they were soft and thin. My only complaint is that the cutlery wasn't that clean as it used to be.

Just after a sudden planning of dinner while searching a North Indian restaurant in medium price ... we found Azad hind dhaba and visited the sector 5 outlet near technopolis ...
We had Butter keema naan , Amritsari naan , kabuli naan , Makki di rooti with ghee, Butter naan and Chicken butter masala, Azand hind special chicken, Kadhai mutton and liver with keema ...
Among those Keema Naan was best ...
Food was normal tasty... kabul naan was just little bit dry type...
Decoration was something which can be praised ... the photos on the walls and the middle table which is closed from two side by wooden wall was nicely decorated...
Con is the place is not too spacious and food is good but not legendary ...

I just don't know why they call it a dhaba when they can't serve you good food that too for a higher pricing. I had my first meal from this restaurant when I visited Kolkata, but seriously it jus disappointed me. The Chicken Biryani lacks spices and was filled with so much of essence. Even the chicken tikka was not so pleasing but its chutney was really good. The renovated restaurant has a very good ambience especially the tractor setup which gives it a very desi look with an average service. The restaurant is mostly overcrowded for no reason.

The food for Azad Hind dhaba has changed over time. What happens to be an extremely good punjabi dhaba is now an average food joint in the city. I used to love their lassi, chicken tandoori or chicken bharta but the quality has dropped with time. I have also faced situations where the kebab served was nearly raw chicken and had to return the plate back but they were good enough to change it for me. The biryani is not good and just plenty of kewra water on the rice. The rolls are average. Sometimes I have faced rude behavior from their staff (Sector 5 joint which is now closed) - while serving food. Overall - not recommended until they change their model and upgrade their food.

Went today in the late afternoon. Was almost deserted. However, all the dishes were available on the menu. Started of with Chicken Tandoori which was very well prepared. For main course had Lachedaar nan, masala kulcha along with gobi masala, shahi paneer. The nan was really nice and the kulcha had a great stuffings. The gobi masala was superb. But the shahi paneer was a little to spicy for my liking unlike the creamy sweet taste which I prefer. Mutton Korma tasted good with the egg and potato as added attraction. Pricewise its very reasonable.

We have been here quite a lot of times since it is located  opposite to our office building in salt lake . But somehow never managed to give a review . Maybe this joint had never been able to capture our culinary spirits but then again that is the story of a lot if franchises these days . For people living in the vicinity especially for the it sector guys this will be a decent choice when all else fails . I will personally recommend to try only these dishes only if you somehow manage to end up dining here . The dishes are : - 

Starters :-
1. Afghani kabaab ( the best from here ) 
2. Malai chicken ( a popular )
3 . Tandoori chicken ( becoming good ) 

Main course : - 
1. Butter garlic nun
2 .Tandoori roti 
3. Mixed fried rice ( only decent rice dish )
4. Azad hind special chicken.
5. Kaali daal 
6. Liver curry .

Deserts :-
1. Tutty fruity.

If you select these items I can bet you would not be disappointed. I have attached the pics in the gallery section so you can find them under my name .

This place is just opposite to my work place, and the reason why I've been there a few times. I'll tell you this - I absolutely hate going to this place, and wouldn't want to go there unless I am out of options. This is one of those places where the staff carries the age old mentality, where they think it's their eternal right to be tipped by the customers, irrespective of the services provided. Since this is the only place in the vicinity, you would find it crowded. Worst part is, the staff is aware of that and it reflects in their behaviors. Food is average at best, so is the ambience. If you are in that vicinity, I'd suggest you to take a cab and go to sector V or city center, where you would find plenty of better restaurants.

We order chicken biryani normal as well as special. The only difference is the no of chicken pieces, no extra rice though. The food is terrible, you have to find chicken in the chicken. I was so hungry when I ordered it but after eating half plate , I did not feel like eating at all. I felt that I am abt to puke. It left a very bad taste in the mouth. Seriously disgusting taste. Even the roadside dhaba in sec V sells better biryani.

I tasted many of their veg n non veg items,but surely i would rate on veg items as paneer preperations,veg polao,palak paneer,mixed veg more than non veg items as different kind of kebabs or mutton do piaza n chicken tikkas. I never like their kebab items. Different kind of veg polaos r highly reccomeneded,try it once,u would love it.

We Got Down At Howrah And Thought Of Some Food Parcel Pick Up. Hence
Called Up AZAD HIND DHABA . The Guy Who Picked Up My Phone, Was Very
Rude From The Word Go.

Now.... He Denied To Take Order Over Phone [ We Dont Take Order By
Phone....You Have To Come & Wait]... I Dont Understand What That Think
Of Himself...Bill Gates Rupard Murdoch Or Someone Like That ? And This
Is How You Deal Your Customers? No Problem. You're Not The Only
Restaurant In The Proximity... Not Only I ll Never Go Back To AZAD
HIND, Also I'll Share My Experience In My Circle

Only 1 complain for all Azad hind outlets....u guys prepare food very oily n spicy. a medium spicy lover as me cant stand this all time. I tasted many of their veg n non veg items,but surely i would rate on veg items as paneer preperations,veg polao,palak paneer,mixed veg more than non veg items as different kind of kebabs or mutton do piaza n chicken tikkas. I never like their kebab items. Different kind of veg polaos r highly reccomeneded,try it once,u would love it.

Went today during the lunch time and all I took it back from is a horrible fooding experience. I had actually had the worst food ever today with every item I ordered not even coming close to my expectation. We ordered Assorted Kabab platter where it was supposed to be a mixture of Chicken Tikka, Reshmi and Hariyali kababs. However, in reality, all the kababs were just of different colors with no difference in tastes. Feeling sad, we ordered for Butter naan and Chicken kadhai to be on the safe side. 
However, we were being bowled out with such a bad Chicken Kadhai. The chicken was fully of colorful gravy with four moisture laden pieces of chicken, which after eating seemed like they were being washed after boiling and cooked again.
All in all, a complete waste of money and hence not recommended !

Friends, you feel sad when places which you had earlier loved falls in standard. This has what has happened to this place. Earlier the non beg here was simply yummy, not it is NOT. Earlier the service was pleasant now its NOT. And here i am comparing with my earlier visit about 8 m back. I went there with a friend as I had earlier highly recommend it to him. Tasting the food and the seeing the service i came out visibly depressed. Oh why why why!!!. Had ordered something I always had chicken tandoori butter masala and roomali roti. The chicken was not freshly prepared which was quite apparent, the roti was also not soft. Keep everything aside, the service ...in one word PATHETIC!. The waiters were busy watching TV , and was rude when asked for anything. I think i made my point clear. So if u plan to get depressed and feel disgusted only then visit this place.

Its one of the most famous dhabas in Kolkata. So it has to be crowded. A special mention to the watchman outside, he was really courteous. The staff was also very polite and well mannered. The food was like always delicious. We ordered Kali dal and Naan which was tasty. The only thing which disappointed  me was the cleanliness of the utensils (plates). Other than this, everything was perfect. The people working there are very hardworking, they managed the crowd very efficiently. Keep up the work !

Located at the epicentre of sector 5 I must say a total waste of opportunity by this restaurant to make it big. Worst food and service experienced here. The food is not a bit tasty and service is just like eating food in some place where no one cares. AC is leaking and you are all drenched with water. Should work on everything and I would suggest people who have no choice and have to eat food in hurry should only go this place.

The last time I went here it was at my best friends birthday lunch. Food was good. And we all know AHD is basically known for North Indian cuisine in particular. The service was okay. The restaurant is in a perfect place for working professionals in the Salt Lake Area. Loved the Kashmire Puloa which I still remember because that is one dish which is rarely found in restaurants here and if found not tasty. I also have gone here a few times with my ex-team mates. Good memories.

Yesterday went here for lunch ... location can't b more convenient for us just opposite2 our office in Technopolis. Had ordered Chicken Tandoori full plate which consisted of 2 leg pieces n 2 breast pieces. The tandoori chicken was soft n succulent but a bit salty due to their abundant use of chat masala. Even the fish tikka was similarly salty but Thank God it didn't hav d fishy smell but a subtle ajwain flavour. Big tip to others tell them to put less chat masala on the kababs. So starters gave us a good start. For main course we had ordered Kadai Chicken & Chicken Butter Masala (boneless) along with Masala Kulcha. Kadai Chicken was tangy and had 4 quite decent pieces. Now coming to the Chicken Butter Masala was actually shredded with lots of chicken shreds. I personally liked it more than the Kadai Chicken. I really liked the Masala kulcha it was like a tandoori roti stuffed with spicy mashed potato. Overall nice experience. U can giv it a try when u r tired of eating lunch from home.

Opposite to Indismart at Sector V, I have visited this outlet quite a few times. Mostly I go here for some quick dishes at a relatively cheap price, however, this place is slowly losing its charm, if it had any.
After getting a table, it took almost 20 mins for some waiter to take notice. We had to literally shout for help for someone to take notice and take the order. Also, we were given 4 glasses of water when we were five of us. Even after asking for it, no one seemed to bother. The staff here are a little laid back. We had ordered three biriyanis and chicken masala. Accompanying it, there was a plate of Mutton Rara and Kulchas.
I, for one, am a big big fan of biriyani and just love to have it anytime anywhere. What irked me the most was the presentation of the Biriyani. Normally everywhere we are served with Biriyani where it forms like a heap of a structure where the rice covers the chicken/mutton pieces. I have had biriyani here a couple of times before and had received it the same way. However, today it looked disjointed and prepared as if the chef did not want anyone to have that. It was clear that afer pouring the rice, a part of it was taken away and pieces of rice and mutton were dangling from the plate. The chicken masala was nothing special and at best can be called ordinary.
Mutton Rara was good and perhaps the only good thing today. To top this forgetful experience, there were flies all around which presented the most unhealthy and unhygienic situation.
I have been here before and can say that where is nothing overtly extraordinary to report, nor anything extreme to check. This place has its business running in full flow mainly because of its price and largely due to its prime location in sector V.
Needs a lot of improvement according to me, at least for the branch of sector V.

Azad Hind Dhaba has lost its charm in recent times. The food is at best average. Starters like Tandoori and Kebabs are overcooked and the pieces do not look fresh to me. Main course items like Biryani and side dishes are not that great as well when compared to other competitors in the same locality like Ali Baba and Jabbar Afghani. To top it off, the service is very slow as well. Evening snacks like samosas and radha ballabis can be tried out as these are good eats in azad hind dhaba.

I have seen this joint so many times while going or coming from the office but recently had a chance to visit.
Something I found at the very beginning, the place is very small to adjust that many seats which makes the place clumpsy. The service and quality of service is completely immatured.
We had a sweet corn soup which was kinda okay but the tandoori chicken was disappointing. Not sure why they put so much tandoori red color for all their tandoor/ kebab..it neither adds taste nor adds any value.
The maincourse was a sheer flopshow. The mixed noodles was although edible but both the side dishes were pathetic. The chilli fish was smelly and the garlic pepper chicken was too salty and on top of that they put almost a jacket of coating on each piece of chicken which made it like a lump of cornflour.
Definitely not recommended.

I would say food is decent nothing extra ordinary than other outlets of azad hind.. But the outlet is spacious.. The staffs are a little laid back.. But I really liked the chicken tadka here... Other food and dishes like chicken bharta , butter nan and reshmi or tikka masala and kebabs are decent in taste. But I will say needs a little improvement on their services.

Had dropped here for dinner with T after a hectic day of training at Sector V. Only one table was occupied when we reached the place. The interiors are good, with a traditional village setting. 

We ordered a Chicken Bharta, a Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala (half plate), Butter Naans and an onion salad. We were having major Chicken Bharta cravings that day & that was the main reason for us deciding to have dinner at Azad Hind. But the Chicken Bharta was nothing extraordinary. In fact, it was just average & not good enough to satiate our craving. The Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala, on the other hand, was delicious. The naans were soft and good.

Might visit again to try out some other dishes.

Located just opposite of Technopolis. Parking is available. 
Sittings arrangements are quite spreaded. Very pocket friendly.
Tastes, mind blowing. Truly authentic. One of the best north indian resturant I have ever been. Far better tastes and quality than any 5 stars. 
You gotta try their Kebabs. These are must try. Probably the BEST. I have never had such a mind blowing and perfect kebab ever in kolkata. A very nice experince visiting this outlet.

I was a regular customer at Azad Hind Dhaba , when i was in Kolkata. I found the food they serve a tad oily and specially, if i talk about chicken biriyanj, i used to eat a lot of that earlier but later my fondness for the same reduced due to the excessive ghee they use in that. But there are few good points as well to talk , I like the way they prepare the pulao/fried rice, be it peas/veg pulao. Some chicken items are also delicious. I really recommend them to improve the same else they cant flourish much.

Well, disclaimer goes... please never order soup in that restaurant! We ordered and that sucked big time.
Other than that chilly babycorn was a big hit & it kept on rising from there! Main course was also yummy. We went with the safe bets -- kadai chicken n paneer. Food was not very expensive and main course made us forget the tasteless soups!

Located just opposite to the Technopolis building. I am really fond of this place as the food is pretty decent to good and you don't have to break your pocket o have lunch here. The service is prompt & good. The place is big and ideal for budget team lunch. Try their butter garlic naan with mutton banjara or mutton keema. Kebabs are pretty good too, and in chicken you can try Chicken Kaali Mirch. It's my favorite dish in AHD as the sauce is just out of this world, a must try.

the food was tasty. the price was also reasonable but a very bad experience happened that completely ruined the 1st impression and i vowed that i wont come to this place ever again. My friend accidentally left her purse containing her debit card and cash on the chair. And when we came back to the place for the same they simply refused that any such item was found at the location where we were dining. We filed a police diary and miraculously the restaurant people phoned the next day stating that they have found the purse. When we retrieved the purse from them we noticed that the debit card was missing when asked about it the cashier simply said that they haven't found the card.

I give a zero rating for this restaurant. We have been given tomato soup with bread chunks fried in bad oil. I tasted so bad we cannot eat anything after that. When we complained about the same, the waiter said you won't get it again. The worse attitude i have ever encountered. Someone should do an inspection at this restaurant, i wonder what oil they use for cooking food. I will never go here again and suggest all of you the same.

However the ambience feels lighter & soothing the service is very slow & poor. Please look into that & the preparation of Biriyani needs an improvement..ate yesterday but that taste was missing. Work in it !!

This place is okay. The food is good and the prices are decent . The decor was also very good. However they lack efficient management and there are limited options for vegetarians. So there's scope for a lot of improvement.

After a long time I am going to write an review. I have been here for a lot of time because whenever I want some spicy food then I go to azaad hind. If you love Punjabi's veg food and you are near to sector 5 salt lake then you can try mushroom masala, palak paneer or any paneer dish because quality of paneer is good..ambience is neither very good nor very bad. If you luv non veg you must try Hussain special chicken its awesome. Tandoori roti is just like Afghani roti. Which also I like the most.

Pathetic service of  Azad Hind Dhaba at Naktala , The people out there don't care for the customer. Home delivery is even more Pathetic .... they fool around with the customer. Order not delivered after 2 hrs also and they even not have the min. courtesy to inform the customer about the delay.

Location is good..
But yes of you really wanna wait for a leap year to give your order then this place is yours..
Plus the attitude of the waiters make it worse.
My friend nearly had a fight for just asking "when will you take the order?"
N their reply was "dikhta nai h kaam kar raha hu apne jagah pe baitho "
So even if the taste of food is average you must avoid going here.
And i have visited this restaurant three times and watched same attitude and endless waiting .

Located just opposite to technopolis, sector V, salt lake, this restaurant specializes in north Indian, dhaba style food to be specific. We ordered mutton do pyaja, keema, chicken butter masala, chicken kadai, 3 flavour kebabs. The kebabs were quite good,and the chicken kadai is certainly a must have here. The ambience is not up to the mark, although the service is quite good. But, the mocktail tasted like any drink of  another roadside soda shop. Overall, rated 3/5.

Awesome place. We went there for a treat, ordered a plate and half chicken tandoori, garlic butter chicken, chicken tikka butter masala, butter roti. The tandoori was amazing, nicely done served along with the green chutney. The butter garlic chicken was white in color, and came as a shock. It tasted chinese-y, wouldn't recommend that. The tikka masala was good, so were he Rotis. For people with small appetite, one should do. We ended with ice creams, which were served with half a cherry. The place is economical, has a good ambiance, with a good enough service.

The location is good. But the food and service is pathetic. You need to shout at the waiters for their attention and get the food served. The rotis were hard as stones, and they refused to change them. The management of this restaurant is pathetic. Taste of the food is also nothing to boast of. I would suggest to avoid this place.

This is actually a nice place which is not managed properly. The food is good the interiors are good. The location is good, just the staff doesn't manage it properly. When I entered the restaurant was mostly empty but still the tables were not clean. Dishes were lying on tables. And even after the waiter cleaned the table it was not really clean. The food was good, service was good, waiters were well behaved but it could have been much better

Located opposite Technopolis, this place is mostly visited by people from nearby offices. Last time when we visited sometime back, food was good. So this time we wanted to have lunch and ended up at this place. 

It was a huge disappointment. It was a weekday lunch and the place was averagely crowded. The food was terrible in taste and so was the quantity of each dish that was served. For example the chicken tikka was tiny pieces of chicken which was bland in taste. The pudina chutney was served in a bowl which was broken. When we asked them to change it, they completely refused to and asked us to have it from that broken bowl. The waiters had an aweful behaviour throughout. We refused to tip them at all. They made comments while we were exiting this place. 

It was a terrible experience overall and I'd suggest others never to visit this place.

I have tried prawn noodles, egg biriyani, rumali roti, mushroom babycorn butter masala and varieties of soups n rolls. All seemed good. Though I don't eat chicken bt my friends liked the shanghai chicken that they had ordered. This restaurant calls for a visit at least once.

This was my first visit to the renowned well known Azad Hind Dhaba... The ambience not so attractive but its quite a crowdy and lively place... We settled down and ordered chicken rashmi kebabs and paneer tikka kababs.. The kebabs were served hot with a green dhania pudina chutney... As for the paneer kebabs i just loved them it was soft and the marinated spices could be felt in every bite, they were just delicious... but in case of the chicken reshmi kebabs they were not so soft and lack moisture... i expected the best from the kebabs but was a disappointment... Then we ordered mushroom hakka noodles... the noodle was just the best.. the mushrooms tasted good and the noodles was perfectly done with all the veggies.. i just loved the noodles.. overall the food is good hope the kebabs could be upto mark...

This outlet of the well renowned Azad Hind chain has opened recently and is keeping up to the mark. It's exactly opposite to Technopolis Sector V. The place is not very spacious but has great ambiance and is very well organized. It's clean and the service is is smooth. The food quality is quite similar to all the other outlets however, being new in the area it's impressive. You have both outdoor as well as indoor seating and they provide prompt deliveries in time.
*********†****†*********†**********
The quality of the place has now deteriorated over time is no longer having the charm of the brand. Sad to see how people turn a good brand down just because they feel that the brand would carry them on.. I'm sure that the people piling up now, are left with less options in the area.. A planned visit to this place is now a history.

I order 2 chicken biriyani and 1 murg kali mirch from food panda.

About food, food was testy. Biriyani taste was nice. But the biriyani chicken was burned. Murg Kali Mirch was awesome in taste. No doubt in that.

After paid to foodpanda Azand Hind Dhaba charges Rs.30/- extra for delivery (but it was written during the order that home-delivery is free). When I asked them why this extra they told me they will give some salad with this. Those are nothing but some slices of onion and lemon.

Been there twice. The first visit was very promising, they had good food which prompted us to visit the place for a second  time. But the second visit was just poor. We entered and sat for 20 to 30min. No one came to serve us, hell no one even gave us glasses and water!! The waiters turned a blind eye to our table, as if we weren't even present there. We obviously stormed out, and guess what, the manager was equally poor, he didn't even make any attempt to keep us there. If this is how you guys want to do business then so be it, bhut we are certainly not coming again, ever. Neither will we ever recommend this place.

Food: Some items are delicious while some are just tolerable. I love the amritsari daal makhan and hate the mushroom dishes. Paneer dishes are mediocre. The rumali rotis are well made and so are the kebabs. However, food is extremely oily here. Warning: DO NOT TRY THE CHINESE DISHES. They are not meant to be good in a Dhaba. I rate it 3/5.

Ambience: Pretty basic. Some interesting wall hangings. Have gone there in day time only so no idea about the lighting. It's clean and well maintained. Chairs are a bit uncomfortable though. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: They are just tooooooo slow. Irritatingly so. But in general staffs is well behaved. In peak hours you might feel ignored by the fast moving waiters. I rate it 2.5/5.

Price: Standard price. Maybe if they raise the quality of the food a bit then it would be more worth it.

Overall I give it 3/5.

The name has become too big for itself, located at the Globsyn building, this dhaba wholly serves for the appetite of many food lovers.

The hospitality is amazing, the care they take while serving food is remarkable. 
Coming to the food, it is really value for money, the tandoori, the kebabs all of those perfectly meets the taste buds, really a great place for a calm Indian lunch. Do visit soon, coz some things are only to be felt by ourselves.

By now the Azad Hind dhabas have made a name for themselves. They offer true north indian food and a good variety as well.  The menu is extensive.  The ambience and service are good but nothing out of the ordinary. The location is an advantage for people based at Sector 5 for work. 
Nice affordable option!

A huge brand name now in Kolkata. Certainly failed to live upto its name.
This new outlet at Sector 5 Salt Lake City is near Globsyn Business School. This also operates late night and as usual during durga puja it is always crowded. We had a 45min waiting time and finally got our seats. The place is noisy and bustling with people.  Cleanliness is an issue at this outlet. Washrooms and the floors are not clean. The AC vents leak and when you complain they just say all is fine during durga puja. Absolute crap attitude and service is damn slow.
Now coming to the food, tandoori chicken was good and decent. Malai Kebab was awesome. Chicken tikka masala/reshmi masala were not extraordinary and certainly overpriced.
Rotis are average.
I wish they pay more attention in making the food and ambience perfect.

We visited this place on this puja for dinner..  
and we didn't need to wait more than 20 minutes outside..

the "Chiken Malai Tikka Masala" is very tasty..  
must try the "Tanduri Aloo Paratha"..

service are satisfied, as you can  expect at a Dhaba..  

the Lassi is also very good. . .

Dhaba actually means that there will always be a single dishe of every item. If We think in that way, so its not a dhaba. Better to say it a resturant called as Dhaba. Anyway there are several ahd in salt lake. I also tasted the ahd in sector II also. However the sector five one is quite nicely decorated, and the quality is good. The kulcha is very tasty and it have to be mentioned that the food they surf that is hot and spicy. The two dishes we ordered that mutton keema and chicken tikka masala. Those were good in price. A 3.5 from my side. And a must try resturant. Not Dhaba...

I love North Indian cuisine. The intelligent use of spices in this cuisine make it really special. The "dhaba" in the name attracted me to this place.
The decor is decent. No complaints with the service either.
The food is average. We ordered Naan and Pander Butter Masala. It was regular. The Lassi was not good either. 
This Dhaba gets extra points for its location. You can finish work and grab a bite here.
All in all, a decent leave to eat if you cannot go to any better place.

I would request all my foodie friends to stay away from this place. This place is highly inconsistent and it is really very bad on its bad days. I have had food here nearly 4-5 times, so this is no coincident or my bad luck sort of thing. Their dishes like biriyanis are often simply tasteless and on some days their side dishes have so so much oil that you will feel sick. Also on one evening we six were there at this place to have six egg mutton rolls, we kept waiting inside the restro and after one hour when we complained we found they were all just chatting and cracking jokes with each other and our order was never told in the kitchen. We six were just furious and have never been to this place again. So please BOYCOTT this place before same such event happens to you or to your family. Why take so much pain and tension for such low quality food?

Must try thier kebabs nd kulchas. Biryanis are ok types nd are slightly overpriced.
Must be AVOIDED during festivals as they serve bad quality food during those times. Went to this place during the pujas and they served prawn fried rice with rotten smelly prawns. Never try mutton dishes unless u have a saw to cut ghe muttons. Once they even served a glass of water with dirty water. When asked the waiter to change it the waiter simply ignored. 
Only visit this joint if u find all the other SecV restaurants closed.

Nice decorative Punjabi restaurant with dhaba style. A lot of rush in salt lake sector 5 branch in the lunch time which obviously means you should not go there if you have to attend meetings even after an hour. Food is great but a little pocket burning deals. Although they have many staffs but still you have to keep patience as they seemed quite busy when I visited the place. They brought lunch for me and my friends after 40 restless minutes. Food quality is great and you will feel the Desi tadka. Paneer receipies are average but Non vegetarian have some awesome deals there.   They have other branches in sector 2 and technopolis also as far as I remember.

Nice decorative Punjabi restaurant with dhaba style. A lot of rush in salt lake sector 5 branch in the lunch time which obviously means you should not go there if you have to attend meetings even after an hour. Food is great but a little pocket burning deals. Although they have many staffs but still you have to keep patience as they seemed quite busy when I visited the place. They brought lunch for me and my friends after 40 restless minutes. Food quality is great and you will feel the Desi tadka. Paneer receipies are average but Non vegetarian have some awesome deals there.   They have other branches in sector 2 and technopolis also as far as I remember.

I had ordered for a chicken biryani takeaway. The preparation was delicious. The best part of having biryani is the potatoes.. yummm.. it was soft. The chicken was good too but a little more dash of spices would have been perfect.

One of the most disgusting places on earth. Government should ban these outlets for torturing people since the begining of time!! They count your cash with spit on their fingers..follows you till the washroom once you have ordered the starters, for the main course..finally would accept 50% of their food items are unavailable!! crap!!

I would recomend people not to visit this place. This is one of the unique places where the service staff is a bigger problem than the ambience. You'll have to call the atleast 5 times to take your order. And during the time of any sports event the waiters are least bothered to take your order while they are busy in watching the sports event. 
Talking about the food. These people don't know how to maintain quality. At times the food is quite good but usually its undercooked or not well marinated. Like most of the times the tandoori chicken and the kebebs are undercooked. And most of the times they dont prepare all yhe dishes in their menu. This is a place where you will be served food according to the cook's mood.
You will be disappointed if you come to this place,its better to try from jai hind dhaba

My fav place to order from in office. Simply love the masala kulcha, the chicken bharta, the paneer, almost all tandoori items.!! And oh, the biriyanis are nice too.. The size of their paranthas, whether its a kulcha, a tandoori roti or the lacha paranthas, are huge. So order carefully. Otherwise there are very few negatives for the place.

I love North-Indian cuisine and had been a regular to Azad Hind, although it was my very first visit to this particular outlet. Liked the way they had done their interiors, resembling a village in Punjab, with cart-wheels and lanterns.


The service is a bit slow but then I,personally, liked that laid-backness about the place, leaving me and my friend to philosophical insanity.


Our order was simple: Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Peas Pulao, Malai Kofta and Mutton Korma. With their limited desserts' menu, we didn't tread in that direction. The Reshmi Kebabs were just marginally okay, given they lacked the crisp and were a bit bland. My friend found them quite "fikaa". 5 mins after the dish was served, the guys remembered, thankfully, that it was meant to be eaten with some chutney and so they produced it. The salad, served with it, didn't seem fresh to me. The Peas Pulao was fine...nothing good or bad, specifically. The Malai Kofta was really good. Almost perfect. Mutton Korma was also quite good.


Given the bill came up to around 850 for the two of us, I felt it pinched the pocket, for their lack of a proper service and quality. Guys, it won't help being lazy-heads in the tough food market of Sector 5!

After many days all of us were free and planned a family night out..since the Sector-V Azad Hind Dhaba is close to our house we dropped by it..

The interiors of the place are good...the service is quite slow and bad..the vegetarians had limited options as out of the long list of snacks only two items were available..similarly fish lovers were restricted to only one item..out of the long list of items in menu card hardly anything was available..

Out of the given choice we ordered paneer tikka kabab, tandoori aloo, fish tandoori, chicken malai tikka kabab, chicken tangri and prawns for snacks..the paneer was hard..the tandoori aloo was average..fish was smelly and too salty..chicken malai kabab was soft but again too salty..chicken tangri was good..prawns were bad and salty..our complaints about excessive salt went unheard..

For the main course we ordered dal makhani, malai kofta and chana masala for the vegetarians and chicken bharta for the non vegetarians..dal, malai kofta were average but the chana masala wasn't cooked properly..the chicken bharta was good..all breads were good..we wanted biryani but that wasn't available..

Overall the place is below average..service quality is bad..waiters aren't prompt..items are just available in the menu card..food was salty..even the green chutney provided with snacks wasn't tasty..we didn't get sweet lime soda as the lemon was not available..salad without lemon and the most tragic part was the finger bowls without lemon..

I would not like to visit the place again..if you go by the impression of ballygunge Azad Hind Dhaba then the only thing you will find common between the two places is their name..

this is the most convinient restaurant from my office (just opposite technopolis), but sorry to say i almost try to avoid it most of the time. the inside ambience is soso. the waiters, it's very tough to reach to them. once you have taken seat, have to wait for minimum 20 minutes, call them 5-6 times, then it may be possible they would come to take your order. i have gone to multiple branches of azad hind, but dint find such service like the sec v one. even they take equal time just to prepare the bill.

now regarding food, in the tandoori chicken, looks like they provide red color to show it grilled. after having that our hand became red. in biriyani, they don't provide the proper rice and it becomes very dry, not at all tasty. their mutton roganjosh, chicken tikka masala with tandoori roti is better. even they don't prepare all the items in their menu card, like you will never find fish reshmi kabab/masala here. their in general kababs are quite dry.  even one day i tried fish butter masala and found the fish was not properly cooked inside. when i told them, they deducted that price from my billl. in chinese, i have tried chicken chowmein here. we had taken the home  delivery service in our office for dinner. it was so bad that me and my colleagues were not able to swallow it even. in dessert, almost you will find nothing here if you go after 2 pm. they tell that everything is finished, not sure how... so, as a whole i can never recommend this branch to anyone...

Got food packed from here . The food was pretty good. The order was tarka dal and a mix vegetable with masala kulcha. The packing was done neatly,spillproof and good.The portions were okay. The food tasted good. Liked the smokey flavour of mix veggies.
Te price is pretty reasonable.
But my favourite still will be azad hind dhaba off ballygunge with wonderful memories and even wonderful food.
However this place too was an overall very good experience.

Ambience: 3/5
Food : 3.5
Prices : 3.5/5
Service : 3.5/5

Location: Opposite Technopolis Building.  

This place has a simple yet soothing ambiance, with a good quality of fooding.  
Have been to this place a lot of times and one thing that only specific dishes taste great. 

Being to the point and talking about the North Indian fare, 

Recommended dishes: Dal Makhani, Malai Kofta, Shahi Paneer, Paneer Butter Masala, Garlic Naan, Butter Kabuli Naan, Masala Kulcha 

Keep safe distance: Paneer Mushroom Butter Masala, Kadhai Paneer, Lachhedar Naan, Roomali Roti, Butter Tandoori Roti (Average). 

-The problems and taste fluctuations in the safe distance points were taken a note of by the management, hoping it to be solved soon. 
Problems have been to a certain extent taken care of, but, fluctuations are yet to be perfected.  

The service was quick, lived upto the Dhaba name.  
Prices are pocket friendly.  

Overall a good experience. :-) 
(If you know what's to be ordered, else might prove to be deadly.)

I had been to the azad hind dhaba. It is very near to my office. I generally go there on the weekends if I have to go to office. You would never find this joint empty.

As soon as you reach one of the waiter will be coming to serve you. Menu card be provided. You have lots of items to choose from.

I generally take butter nun, chicken karhai, green salad and pepsi. The chicken is cooked exceptionally well. Sometimes it is on the spicy side.

Service is prompt. I would recommend you visit this place.

I have always found Azad Hind Dhaba outlets pretty average in terms of Food and Service. So when a friend planned a family dinner for both our families at this outlet (which I have never been to earlier), my expectations were strictly average. So as per my Score up/ Score down approach of reviewing restaurants, we would start this review with an expected rating of 3. We will review the restaurant on 5 parameters - Location and Ambience, Menu spread and Availability, Taste and Quality, Service and Value for Money. 0.5 points to be added to the expected rating for exceeding expectations in any of the parameters and to be deducted for falling below expectations.

Location and Ambience:
Located right opposite the Technopolis building on the New Town approach road, the restaurant can be easily found. There is no designated parking near the restaurant but they somehow fixed things for customers to park on the road in front of the restaurant. Not ideal but ok. The ambience is better than the other outlets. The lighting was soothing but sufficient and tables were well spaced. They can sit around 60 people in one go. There a "cabana" sort of arrangement in the centre with a square table for eight people and we were seated here. The ambience certainly exceeded my expectations and hence a Plus 0.5 here

Menu spread and Availability:
Menu spread was the standard North Indian fare with an additional Chinese section (which surprisingly has become a part of Dhaba menu nowadays). So, a 0.5 addition for the extra option of Chinese food would have been proper but the availability was poor. First up, we wanted to order Mutton Seekh kabab but were informed that same was not available. This hardly made sense for a restaurant serving North Indian food. Also, we had ordered for chicken lollypops for the children but were informed from the kitchen that same could not be served. Instead, they suggested some Shredded Chicken which was not a part of the standard menu. So, a minus 0.5 for availability cancels the plus 0.5 for the Menu spread.

Service:
A big Minus 0.5 . Firstly, they don't have enough people. In the middle of taking our order, the waiter suddenly took off to another table to pocket the tips before any of his colleagues. They some how got the food to the tables but there was no one around to serve - this was difficult as there were 3 children in the group. So, a Minus 0.5 for the service.

Taste and Quality:
For starters we ended up with Chicken Tandoori, Mutton Boti kebab and Shredded Chicken for the kids. The mutton boti kebab was good but the shredded chicken, which was not part of the standard menu, was quite delicious. The chicken tandoori seemed to have been coated with some pigment giving it a varnished red finish - not really upto the mark. For mains we had dal, chicken bharta and tandoori roti while the kids had hakka noodles and lemon chicken. The best part of the mains were the Rotis - white, soft and well baked. Rest of the food was strictly average.. The noodles tasted bland. The quality of the meat and veggies and raw material seemed ok. Over all the Food was average - but a minus 0.5 for the Chicken Tandoori and hakka noodles.

VFM :
The cost per person came to around Rs.300 including children which is ok as per the pricing of restaurants that can be compared. 

Over all rating, after the additions and subtractions, is coming to 2.5 - which is close to my subjective rating of 2.75

Of all the Azad Hind Dhaba outlets that I have been to, this has to be my least favorite. Although it is bang opposite to my office, I tend to avoid it mainly because the food here is unnecessarily spicy. The service is decent, and the fact that it is generally open till 1 AM is a huge plus, but for people who do not like ultra-spicy stuff, this is a place to avoid!

we visited here on 7 February let me tell you the  thing which disappointed was the service , the ac was not working or if working it was at its minimal position . We had ordered for tandori roti, paneer do pyaza the , chicken kali mirch ,butter chicken
the non veg part was descent but the onions of paneer was almost burnt .
I would personally recommend them to give a better service as it this the thing which counts more .

Let me put my experience in short and brief. We went there on Saturday 2 PM , not very much crowded. The place is quite clean except washroom. Just for a test we ordered Gobi Paratha , my remark : quite bad and tasteless.
The below is my rating about the rest of the food:
Butter Nan - Good
Chicken Biriyani - Average
AHD special boneless chicken -  Above average , appreciable.
Service -- Above average.

Rating is for the "AZAD HIND DHABA" opposite to the TECHNOPOLIS BUILDING. The over all experience was so bad that I wish I could have rate it below "1" . Waiters are unattentive. They dont know how to behave and treat there customers.

They didnt serve us after placing an order after half an hour of just a "Mutton Biriyani" during lunch time which we suoppose is a pre cooked dish and on asking, the waiters, came up with an aggresive argument that we didnt place an order.."HOLY SHITT" !!. How come these idiots expect business ??????

We left the restauarnt and moved out.

This miserable rating goes for their Hakka Noodles. My fervent request to them is that they should either arrange a Chinese cooking course for the cook who prepares Chinese cuisines, else appoint another chef who is proficient in it. Actually I always visit their Kasba outlet for Chicken Rolls. Yesterday purchased a take out from their sector - v outlet. Double Chicken Roll and my wife wanted to eat Noodles, so I hesitatingly ordered for the same. But at home, their inexperience was discovered. So this rating for that very Hakka Noodles, not their Mughlai dishes; please understand.

AZAd Hind dhaba is the worst dhaba in kolkata. Their Prices are very high. Quality is horrible and they even serve less quantity.
Once i went there with my frien Ram da and ordered for chicken bharta which was really disappointing and Butter naan which did not have butter at all. Finally Ram Da ordered for a glass of lassi which was so high price but it did not taste like lassi at all Their staffs are average and anmbience is good. They can easily improve their quality as they charge so high price for their dishes. It is located in Kestopur near the famous REEBOK showroom.

Its great to see azad hind come a long way.. their new outlet is quite nice... the interiers are a little loud ... but none the less.. clean... comfortable... and their service is very prompt. 

i usually hav a few favourites here... 

Keema Mutter ( one of the very fw ppl who hav it all the time ) 
Liver masala 
Egg Kassa
and Garlic naan 

their seekh kebabs are also nice and i like their fish tikka too 
what i like the most abt any azad hind outlet, is that very typical north indian smell... which no other indian food place has. 

value for money food... and very tasty.
