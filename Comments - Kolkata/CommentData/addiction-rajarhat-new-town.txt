Preferred starters are fish pepper salt, fish fingers and tandoori chicken. For main course, we had Cantonese mixed noodles with hot garlic chicken. Alcohol is served in this restaurant.

Worst food, I have ordered chicken tangriii masala, which was nothing but just a fried chicken with gravy. 

Worst taste, more of salty less of tasty

Regular visitor. Though food is ordinary but fairly good. Service is just fine. They have added drought beer. But the glass is not worth the rate. Overall ok.

Well I have visited this place only once and was a bit apprehensive about it, but frankly this was a wonderful surprise packed with loads of good food and drinks. A perfect place for a reunion, party or some quality time with friends or family. The food is good and the service is quite fast. I met one of my seniors from college here and though it was a Saturday evening the place was quite empty. It is a well spaced joint with very courteous staff who are quite friendly and frank with a very warm aura about them. Now coming to the food, the dry chili chicken was fairly good and well cooked. The kebabs were also soft with rich flavours. What disappointed me was the chicken 65 it was a bit too tangy, actually a much popular dish down south I guess it got a bit stereotyped and I could feel the excess amount of curry leaves with which it was garnished. The bar is well stocked and the prices are not exorbitant and they do have special offers sometimes. The only thing that I may want to change is the small smoking room because if the place gets too crowded and there are more number of people smoking, then it will be a problem for the staff. But overall with good food and ambiance the place gives you a warm positive welcome. What comes as a bonus is the warmth and the behaviour of the staff who are quite friendly, polite and very nice.

Went there for lunch on owshthomi with family. It is located in the Axis Mall of Rajarhat. The dishes we ordered were extremely good and perfect. The staffs were courteous and well-behaved. Had a great lunch and a great time over there. Overall the experience was good. Would love to visit again to try their other dishes from their menu. :)

Cheap drinks, good food and very good service is what makes this place our preferred hangout place after work. The waiters greet you well and remember your favourite drinks and starters which makes you feel very comfortable. Indian preparations are good, Chinese some items are good, some are ok. They have recently made some changes in renovating the place and it looks better than before. We have had some ofc parties here and never disappointed.

Ambience - 4.5/5
Service - 5/5
Food - 5/5
Drinks - 5/5

The quantity of the food is great. 2 people can easily share one item like Noodles or Fried Rice. We usually order Tandoori starters, they give 5 pieces. Chicken or fish Tikka is good, fish salt and paper is a must try.

Recommend - YES

One of the best North Indian food that I have eaten in Kolkata. Even the Chinese preprations are quite good. If you are looking for good food n drinks at budget rates in New Town area, this is the place to be.

Ambiance - Okiesh. We got sofa seating since it was a big group so it was comfortable. These sofas are quite big where you can chill out after a hectic day at work.

Food - Amazingggg. We were 9 people so a lot of dishses were ordered. These are a must try:

• Fish Salt and Pepper
• Mutton Bhuna
• Chicken Malai Tikka
• Fish Begum Bahar (Main)
• Chicken Lababdaar
• Daal Makhani
• Chillie Garlic Noodles

All the dishes come in very good portions and one dish will suffice 2 people, 2 girls for sure ;p

Service - Very good. The staff was very courteous and after food this was the second best things. Whatever points I wud have cut due to an average ambiance were made up well with good service

Overall a good place with offers value for money. All North Indians readers - Must Visit

Quite a familiar place for Newtown office people. I often visit with my colleagues on weekends to enjoy beer and some starter. Few items that we frequently order are really good like Crispy Chili Baby corn, Pepper Fish and Chicken Tandoori. We ordered a Chicken 65 last time but it was a disaster.

Ambiance is okay for office goers but not good for couple or Families. Service is really nice.

Visited this place sometime ago, A typical restro cum bar. They have an ample space for dinning. The food here was actually very good. We ate till our last breath. The most disappointing part was the staff. They are slow and irresponsible. Without any prior notice they just closed their kitchen. We had to talk to the people above in the hierarchy to get more food. That spoiled the mood completely. Coming on the cost then it will cost you around 1200 for two people. I would say, go visit this place for good food but be prepared for unforeseen circumstances.

It was a good experience to dine here with friends. Ambience is good with a casual approach. Live sports with beer was a good pastime. We had salt & pepper fish as starter and mixed Hakka chowmein with hot garlic chicken as main course. Food quality and quantity is moderately ok. Serving time was lengthy though. Price is reasonable for food but alcohol is costly as compare to the food joint quality.

Worst place. They announced 10% corporate discount. But when bill arrived,payed,checked after that no discount is given.Asked them to rectify. They just started giving too many way outs those you cannot bear with. Also worst behavior of the bloody Waiters, they just threatened us without accepting their fault. I called police. Police came, convinced them to return back our discount, they told that they did not convey any discount. Infact police man himself was demoralized and asked us to file a complaint so that they can take appropriate action against their cheating. I'll be filling a complaint tomorrow. Suggestion : don't go to this place to ruin your day!! Thanks.

We ordered Fish Salt and Pepper, Kali Mirch Murg Tikka and Crispy Chillie Babycorn and everything was delicious. The portions were@ also very good. For main course we had Fish Begum Bahar, palak paneer and Dal Makhani and everything was made in classic north indian style, something that's rare to find in Kolkata. Also took a Chillie Garlic noodle for parcel for home and it was also delicious. Couldn't finish then quantity by myself at lunch.

If they upscale the interior of the place, it can be a turn around story for this restaurant. They have every other quality of a good restaurant.

The closest place to Unitech if you want to catch a drink or two with friends, but quite overpriced. We had beer and rum with fish finger and chili chicken and the food was tasty although the quantity was less compared to the price they charged. The place is dimly lit but the sofas are quite cozy and if you visit with friends at a time when there's a good match on TV the ambience is quite good. The staff are well-behaved but usually clueless if you ask them for menu suggestions.

We had beer and rum with fish finger and chili chicken and the food was tasty although the quantity was less compared to the price they charged. The place is dimly lit but the sofas are quite cozy and if you visit with friends at a time when there's a good match on TV the ambience is quite good. The staff are well-behaved but usually clueless if you ask them for menu suggestions.

This is a nice bar in the vicinity of my office and situated at 4th floor of Axis mall. It's a cosy place with ordinary decor. The bar menu is quite ordinary with no cocktails. The food though is satisfactory level with good non veg starters on the menu. I personally liked the saute prawn with bell peppers.  Drums of heaven is also a good starter.

Excellent food. Must try - chilli mushroom,  mushroom Masala,  yellow daal and Gobhi peshwari. Their is a huge spread of delicious non vegetarian dishes as well... The service is very prompt and staff is very friendly. They can customize the food according to your taste which is the best thing about this place. All in all a very homely place with great food.

Affordable with decent ambience. Can easily call it the Opium of New Town.
Liquor is cheap and offers corporate discount.
Perfect for people posted around Infospace.

N.B. - Do not drive after drinking. Spread the message!!

On the auspicious day of Mahalaya me along my team visited Addiction.This bar cum restaurant is located at 4th floor of Axis mall,beside aheli. One of the pocket friendly restaurant in Saltlake. As we went there on Mahalaya, so the place was bit crowded but we got the table soon. We ordered saute peace, chicken salt and pepper, fish tikka in starter, butter nun, mutton rohan josh, dal makhani, yellow dal and mixed ved in main course. The service was bit slow. Starter was served quickly but the main dishes took long time to serve. Quantity is good enough, quality is ok. Mutton rohan josh disappointed me. Apart from that rest of the items are tasty.

visited the place last night.... at around 6pm....probably being a monday,  we were the only grp there.... pretty spacious and nicely tabled place.... not much of a decor or ambiance since they were not playing any music.... i had hoped for it since the name sounded like its a lounge.... btw,  its in the 4th floor of Axis Mall... rajarhat..... 
we ordered for our drinks and in came beers.... bacardi white rum and a large peg of black dog... in nice glasses,  big chunks of ice with complimentary peanuts and Indian savoury snacks.... waiters were courteous but i felt like they were working with a little under trained staffs since they looked a little low on confidence when asked about drinks or food.... we had ordered chilli paneer.... american corn.... chilli chicken along with the drinks....to our dismay they told us that they dont have french fries today.... cheap sales gimmick..... Nyways.... the food was average... the paneer was good and fresh and soft actually but the chicken was tough and cheewy..... it was excessively spicy... the american corn was good.... the pub has a inhouse smoking room... and clean toilet.... they gave us a 15% corporate disc on our bill.... overall an okaishh place since we could feel the kick of a lounge but more of a standard bar.....

It's a decent place for casual dining and drinking. Conveniently located at Axis Mall near to the near by IT hubs and office places. Food items are rightly priced and tastes good. Try chicken salt and pepper for starters, for main course you can try any of mutton dishes, they really cook it nice and tender. However very recently the place has gone some makeover in terms of offers on Drinks, happy hours, etc, and I was shocked to see that the food quantity served was reduced to almost half than what it was before. Prices of drinks have certain beers have sky rocketed which is unfortunate. I would request not to take way the nice quality and also the quantity of the foods in the name of certain happy hour offers.  The place was always in my frequent visited casual bars in the town but it has not started to disappoint me. Sadly had to lower my rating from 4 to 3 following this displeasure.

Well this restro bar is located on the 4th floor of axis mall on the back drop of novotel. Considering food quality its OK to pretty decent,  can try their  chicken salt and pepper once again . Drinks are like  decent to maybe a bit pricey. They have a small smoking room too!! Serving time sometimes exceeds your expectations. But then its good to have a couple of choices at the local malls.

Intro::

This is a bar cum restaurant located on the 4th floor of Axis Mall. This place is quite spacious and can accomodate good amount of people. Four of us went there during lunch time.

Food and drinks:

We ordered one big bottle of Budweiser beer, one large peg of Antiquity blue and one orange juice in drinks.
In starters we ordered one plate of fish pepper salt and mushroom salt & pepper.
The fish item was really mouth-watering as it had crispy small pieces of fried fishes served in right proportion of salt and pepper.
The mushroom was equally good.
In main course we ordered one plate of mixed noodles and one plate of hot and garlic chicken.
The mixed noodles had chicken,egg and prawn along with hakka noodles and vegetables.
The hot and garlic chicken had around 12-14 pcs of chicken and was really awesome in taste. It had a bit spicy gravy full of onions and capsicums.

Ambience and service::

The ambience is good with dimmed light inside the restaurant and tv's hanging on two opposite walls.
The service was good but could be better because at times they were responding very slowly.

Price::

All these cost us around 1700 Rs after getting 20% corporate and cash discount on food.

Overall::

A nice place to have drinks and starters with friends and colleagues without shelling out too much money.

Went with colleagues for a team lunch. Though the service was ordinary and took a long time to deliver the food, the food was actually good. Ordered fish pepper salt, malai kebab, golden fried prawn for starters. The fish was good, though nothing extraordinary. The prawns were fresh and good in size. The malai kebab was a delight. The pieces of the kebab were indeed huge and was covered generously with cheese. It was a heaven in the mouth experience. For mains we had butter naan, fish begum bahar, chicken makhani, Cantonese noodles and Thai red curry. All the items were yum and came in good portions. The varieties of dessert could have been more. But the tutty fruity was good.

The service could have been a lot more prompt. The items came so late that people pounced on the plates as soon as the food arrived, and did not let me click pictures.

@ Axis mall 4th floor this bar cum restaurant offers nice location, smart interior, variation in menu, cheap beers & all that you want to chill out with your gang near your house ( if you are in Newtown). I although went there with a large group of office colleagues at lunch hours so didn't try the beer part or chilling out thingies, in stead I had to carry my laptop & login there due to critical system issues when others were enjoying food 😭😞.
Coming to food, there's nothing special nor anything super bad, taste was okay, items were well portioned, service was fast & quick. Only the fried items were bit oily and French fries we ordered, were saggy but they changed it after telling so, no complaints! 
Billing was pocket friendly too, overall nice experience. Might visit again if I don't have to carry my laptop this time😃.

Addiction is primarily a bar and has their own set of environment associated to it.

Located at the Axis Mall Rajarhat on the 4th floor just on the right hand side when you get up to the floor by escalator.

As this is a bar the ambiance is dark and intense. You can enjoy it if you like drinking mostly and prefer to go in a group.

I still remember I had chilli Mutton here for the first time and definitely was sceptical but it tasted really very very good. Food is good one and quality is frsh too with a decent taste.

Service is quite nice and the people serving is very well behaved. Quite helpful as well. Good one :)

Conveniently located at Axis mall. This place serves decent food in the area. Visited multiple times & the food is generally not bad. Special mention for Chicken slat & pepper & fish banjara. Tried & tasted multiple times & this two dishes have less chances of dissappointing one. Though last time, Chilli prawn was terrible. We asked for dry chilli prawn and they served us with gravy & on insisting that this is definatley not dry they told us,this is how it is made here!! Dint like it at all.Prawn seemed stale & lots of chilli was put to hide it.

I had visited Addiction, on the 31st of Dec 2015, as I needed someplace nearby to hang out with my friends. The restaurant is well lit and quite spacious, can easily accommodate some 40-45 people. 
The staff is well mannered but the service is delayed. 
Coming down to the food talk, we had ordered Basa fish finger, served wiith french fries and mayonnaise. It was a baked fish finger and was finger licking good. Next in the line was Drums of Heaven and Tandoori Chicken. Drums of Heaven was served with a thick gravy , similar to what is served in Chinese Side Dishes. Both the items were succulent and delicious.
Would like to visit this place again in future to explore the other items served at this place. Happy Eating!!:-)

reaching they waited for few minutes for my other colleagues. Not only that the
food was good, served promptly and politely. The attendants were well dressed

Addiction has been my all time favorite for drinks and meal. 

Just came here and the entire restaurant was empty so asked if we could occupy the sofa. The guy (who seems new here) bluntly told me we cannot sit in the sofa as were just 2 people. I requested and he got really rude. 


I never expected this kind of rudeness from the staff. I have always had pleasant experience before.
 
Highly disappointed. 

Never coming back.

After writing over 130 reviews, this is the first time i am actually editing a previously written review and changing the rating from 4.5 to 1. On my last visit to Kolkata in November, i had been there with family for dinner and really had a good time.
Hence my wish of a repeat visit not only was a bitter disappointment, it would have been better had i paid someone to insult me all evening rather than being here.
We walked in to an almost empty restaurant, and went to the sofa sitting. Immediately we were surrounded by waiters saying we cant sit there as it is mandatory to make a bill of 2000 to sit on those. Must be the most stupid thing i have ever heard anywhere. So before siting we need to tell them we will eat worth 2k or we cant sit on the sofas. But this wasn't the most silly thing of the evening. Not going in details of all the other nonsense we endured till we got the food served. When our first starter was served, we asked for some mint chutney which we loved last time. "That is extra chargable" . By this time i had enough of the waiters rudeness. We called for the manager. Like a parrot he repeated the same. 
A wonderful place 3 months back has turned into a irritating joint because of the staff. Dont understand they dont want people to come or want to take out their months salary from every customer who accidentally comes in. Anyways won't repeat the mistake of going there again. Good luck till your shutter closes forever if you keep up this behavior.

It is located at the top of axis mall Rajarhaat. I am posting this review after my first visit to this bar cum restaurant. It has a very decent atmosphere; looks like a family restaurant rather than a bar. The waiters are very prompt and courteous. This place should be best for having drinks. Regarding food,it was a bit let down since I ordered the pan fried noodles (mixed) and found some unprepared (not fried properly) noodles in the dish. Taste wise, it was ok. The main advantage is price; they wont cost you a lot. 
Verdict : This should be your place for a hangout with friends. I belive they have the scope to improve the food in future.

Even though the name signifies it to be bar, we decided to try this place. They do serve decent stomach filling full meals too. The ambiance is just about decent. We always prefer taking their sofa seats. Service here is pretty good and prompt. We have always tried their Chinese cuisine which has definitely tasted good but nothing exceptional. Good place to hangout with friends for long hours. Only problem we faced here is the very loud music played in the background.
One must try their Chicken Russian salad. That is a permanent item in our order list :)

The restaurant is situated in axis mall top floor in rajarghat.
I entered the place with less expectations but it surprised me .

The staff is courteous and they try to deliver the food fast.

The place is noisy seeing lot of people noise so for sure nor a place where you can talk with friends in peace.

They have put a TV to show sports i think the size is small they can put a bigger one .. VU brand they can check on flipkart cheap and good .

I ordered dal tadka , roti and mushroom salt and pepper. The food taste was good . mushroom were really good.

Price wise its not a costly restaurant .. Around 600 for 2 people .

When it comes to New Town area near the DLF 1, the options for people to hang out over a few drinks or meal are less. Axis mall serves as a life saver to many looking for decent option in the locality. Addiction is one such joint located on the 4th floor of the Axis mall. The name itself signifies it to be a bar but they do have decent and well priced food on offer. The ambiance has nothing too special about it and I would say it t be slightly above average though the service and the quality served here is remarkable in its own rights. Addiction serves as a great option to the IT population working in the area as there are very few such places one can think of in this part of New Town. Overall, a nice place for a casual get together with friends over a few drinks followed by satisfying food.

It's a family restaurant. You will find proper families having dinner here. Seating arrangements are also of a typical food restaurant. Average ambience and decor. They have a small smoking room inside. The only interesting thing about the place is a mutton starter. It's chopped in small pieces, is spicy and delicious. Makes a perfect combo with a drink as well. Quantity of noodles per plate is a lot so it's better to ask the server what amount of food would be sufficient. OK place for a simple dinner time.

The most attractive bar cum restaurant in Axis mall, Addiction..with a not so large space provided, they have managed the accommodation in a very nice manner. Rates of food and drinks are standard, a non smoking bar, but a separate room with exhaust fan is inbuilt. Red pepper chicken, chicken thai pai and pepper fish were the most sumptuous food I have had over there. The waiters are very well mannered and service is quick enough. Probably this place is the last store inside the entire mall that remains open till midnight. A light music keeps on playing all along which is soothing. A very decent place to drop in with any kindnof companion you get - your wife, family, boozers anyone. Only area of improvement I find over this place is the interior decoration - When you say it's a bar cum restaurant, you have to set up a light and shade effect inside; may be a deemed blue or red light and something which creates hallucination, trust me you dont need so much of CFL or tube lights inside ...that's why Opium always gets preference by the boozers and foodies.Other than this, it's a real cool place.

I am a regular with friends at this place, especially Friday nights after work we all land here to kick off the wkend. For drinks and food, it has always lived upto our expectations however service on weekends is a tad slow. But if you are with friends for round(ssss) of drinks, does it really matter ;p :D 

Good collection in the bar, smoking hot starters, a sutta zone for chimneys like us and pretty reasonable prices sums it up for me...try their fish salt and pepper, its to die for or ask them to surprise you with any item in chicken / mutton and be sure you wont be disappointed..

1 of the worst experience I have had here. I went to axis mall for some shopping. After shopping me & my wife thought to have a few drinks & some food. The moment we entered, there was this waiter who tells us we are not allowed. The reason I m wearing "shorts", where as I was in a pair of 3-quarters. The waiter tells me the bar is only for family. I was with my wife & he tells me this. This guy then goes to the manager to take the permission, a few minutes later he comes back & tells us, manager will speak to us. We waited in the corner for next 10 minutes & there was no sign of manager. Then we went to him, he was busy on his job, no time for customer kinda attitude. I gave him a shout, then he realised that I was wanting to speak to him. He gets up & tells us, we are not permitted bcos this is for decent people. Wearing a 3-quarter makes you indecent I had come to know for the 1st time in life. I have been to many bars, but never had this experience. He again says that this is family restaurant, people may create nuisance. I was with my wife, still this shameless manager kept telling me, we may create nuisance. The reason is funny, "my 3-quarter". The ambience of the hotel, looks like a chalu bar with beer boxes at the side. Most importantly, there was no one outside who would tell u that you are not allowed. There is no rule board outside the main entrance which says about the dress code. It's just another bar & the shameless manager has no time to do things in the right way. Lot of IT professionals whose offices are in the vicinity visit this bar & there is good business, hence he can be shameless to me & my wife. I urge everyone to take a note of it. Thought about going to the court & sue, but as we are common man of this country, we have this chalta hay attitude. Thanks to zomato, at least I am able to share my experience with you all.

I came here for the first time and I didn't like the ambience at all. It was pretty much crowded and not at all spacious and the service they provided were really very poor. We had to wait for the next food to come. I had only starters didn't get the chance to try the main course, it might be good. But coming to starters apart from prawn and the fish dish I didn't like the other dishes. For a booze party with your friends it might be the place for you but if you are hungry and craving for good food this is not the place.

Located in Axis Mall and is very popular with the IT guys. Service is good the food is average. One thing that disappoints is that sometimes some of the drinks are not in stock and so u have to try one from their list which does not go down well. Although this point becomes redundant after you are three down!

This place will never disappoint you untill and unless you get a table to dine here. It is very close to my house and I never get bored of food they serve here. All you need is good booze with tasty snacks and a proper meal in the end. Well then this is the place to be for sure. "Chilled beer || smoking chiken tikka " what more you can ask for.

Tell them to serve their best dish or snack and let them suprize you. Belive me you will not get disappointed here.

We did home delivery last night, a small meal of chicken tikka and some naan. 

Firstly, the person on the phone was extremely courteous and very well spoken and was very apologetic that the wait may be 1 hour due to Friday night rush (understandable). 

Upon questioning, he also assured me that the food would not be cooked early and sit there waiting for delivery, so we placed he order.

It arrived 40 minutes later piping hot. Well done.

The meal itself was juicy and tasty and a generous portion of the sauce and the naan was light and fluffy. 

Couldn't find a reason not to give the process a 5.0.

Overall an excellent delivery option.

This is among my first few reviews on Zomato. Have visited this places 2-3 times so decided to finally share my views with others who like to enjoy food good and liquor at decent prices. If I am to review the place only on liquor prices and variety, I would rate it 5. As food is to be rated together, I am giving it a 4.5 (would have given 4.2 but there is no such option). The place is well decorated, dimly lit which is perfect for ambience if you are going in at late evenings for drinks n dinner with friends. The service is not excellent to say as most of the staff seems to be new but they are none the less courteous to do their best. 

 

I have tried their Indian as well as Chinese over different visits and both are good. Best it that they prepare them on your specification to be low, medium spicy/spicy. The bar is well stocked as I said earlier, it is one of the low priced option around new town area. They have tables for dining and very relaxing sofas to chill out with friends over drinks. However on the days they have rush, sofas are only available only for big groups. All in all a good place for wine and dine if you live in New Town or looking for a good food n drinks place when around this area.

I visit Kolkata frequently for business meetings and went to addiction for a team dinner after the place was recommended by the local team. 4 star for the location as it was a 10 mins drive from our office at Unitech. The ambience was ok but the extensive collection in their bar and the delicious food made up well for it. In past I have failed to find a restaurant in Kolkata which serves good north Indian food. We ordered lots of starters but Fish Salt and Pepper Stands out to be the best. I am not really a fish person but this dish made me change my mind ☺ Main course was also quite good. Overall I can say that for a big group of people when you need variety in alcohol and good food to go with it, this is the place for them.

Addiction on the 4th floor of Rajarhat AXIS Mall has steadily declined to an average Restaurant + Bar.

It started with a bang in the 2012s and used to serve fantastic north indian lunch and dinner.

It was a very popular hangout for office-goers at nearby UNITECH INFOSPACE.

Chicken Hoseini (The addiction version of Chicken Bharta), Garlic Naan , Mushroom Masala used be our favourites.

Sadly ,the quality has dipped, quite a lot.

I have been a weekly visitor here since a couple of months now and needless to say that its the service and ambiance that draws you here. Being in a close vicinity from the office is also an advantage.
Coming to the food - we never tried too many options but always moved around a few. Mutton Bhuna is something they make best. You can customize it as per your taste buds (we order it spicy and with less salt). Chicken salt and pepper is also something that they expertise on. The Murgh Achari Korma is good but a little high on salt (probably because the pickle has salt in it). French fries are cooked to perfection. 
Never tried the mains here but would definately love to.
So, if you are around Newtown and want to spend a leisurely Friday eve, this place is a must try.

I m not an avid internet user to review places / items etc, but came to review this restaurant because , this is the worst experience I have had ever in my life.

Coming to the point,
Any one of you who visits this restaurant kindly recheck your bill amount, they surge up the bills. 

Went to drink beer and have some snack, as we had some good amount of beer, we requested bill.
When the bill came it was stating 3 more beers, i requested the waiter, that you have not applied corporate discount and 3 more beers are added.
The bill came again, and it had discount but 3 beers that we did not consume was not excluded.
I requested waiter again .. AND THE WAITER STARTED SHOUTING " MAINE NAHI KIYA HAI JISNE KIYA HAI USE BOLIYE"

It was such a fuss, and the manager was sitting quietly, as if its a small matter, WAITER SHOUTING AT CUSTOMER.

Had arguments with Manager, last he rectified the bills, and excluded 2 beers and not 3. I did not want to get in this fuss more paid for extra beer and left.

I wont ever visit this place ever again. You can visit if you wish, do check and recheck your bills, as one of my friends also complained that they had been charged extra.

I believe, Owner doesn't sit in the restaurant, manager bulges up the bill and pockets extra amount.

If the owner of this restaurant happens to read this, take corrective action. Else its your business. Who Cares in India .

Its there on the 4th floor of axis mall, ambience is okay okay, not what you would be expecting as considering its a restrobar. Wenevr I go, I opt for the 4 Sofa Seats, you can relax there, chat and enjoii, which is much better than the rest of the tables available there... Considering the Alcohol rates: they are pretty normal. Food quality is good but the time taken to prepare the food is way too much even wen the restro is not so crowded. Chill Potato, Chilly Mushroom, chilly chicken and Babycorn is must try. Malai Kofta was not even close to what we were expecting. Rest everything was in order..its a normal place for hangout, small parties or wen we want to eat somewhere close to our flat without spending too much....

The paper fish, a starter is the best I ever had. Haka noodles are better than most of the so called Chinese restaurants. Also great for veg eating groups as the options are good enough too.

Even this place is well known as a Bar, but we visited last week for having our lunch. Ambience was average n more feel like a pub but clean and hygiene. We ordered Chicken Tandoori - which was soft and delicious , Panfried Noodles - well....it wasn't exact what we expect from Panfried but still tested good, Chicken Fried-rice - common, Garlic mushroom - was good and with fresh mushrooms. The average cost was 350- 400 per person. If you are around Newtown/ Sector V, you can avail this restaurant .

This is more of a bar than a restaurant, and hence the name. One thing I really like about this place is that they have quite a few sofas and center tables where you can relax, chat over, drink for each others health and end it with some lip smacking delicacies(or is it?). No, the food is not great, and the taste does not ring a bell anywhere. It is at the best average food. Not that anything was inedible, but nothing worth mentioning.

It's one of the worst restobar I have ever seen. The place is always empty. When we asked a waiter if they serve North Indian food he just walked away as  if I was speaking French/German. After 15 mins another waiter came, we asked Lassi, he said no then we asked cocktail, he said no. Atlast we walked away from there to some other restobar.

To be frank, I had not heard of this place before one of my office colleagues mentioned it to me. It came as an option while office mates were deciding for a birthday party nearby to our office compound at Ecospace. The review of the restaurant wasn't great, but there were no other decent option near about Ecospace or Unitech. And to ensure maximum attendance, the organisers were reluctant to go to city center or any other place which is far off. Thus it was decided to gather at Addiction for a weekday lunch. 

Restaurant located at top floor of Axis Mall but there are no windows to it - alas!! As was expected our group of 25 were the only people over there apart from a one or two other guests. The staffs seems very busy while I entered the place. Feels like they are not accustomed to serve such a number of people at one go. I had to shout literally to call one of them after 5 minutes of waiting. The order was taken in a rush and before we could blink, the waiter was gone again. Serving time was alright, starters were good. We ordered mushroom salt and pepper, chilli prawn, fish finger and chicken lollypop. All of them were good and recommended, especially the mushroom dish. On main course we ordered biryani, naan, chicken makhani and raita. Naan and chicken makhani were good, biryani was a let down (though now-a-days I find Alibaba to be the only joint which serves tasty biryani). The bill for us came around 16000 for a group of 25. 

Believe it or not, during our hour long meal duration, blackout occurred - twice. I had to switch on mobile flashlight in order to locate my glass of beer. It took more than a minute to switch on lights back to its original state in both the occassion. 

Overall, the food is good but the ambience and house staff is a let down. I will prefer not to go there for a meal but can always hit the place for a quick round of drinks.

Addiction located on the 3rd floor of Axis mall draws most of its diners from the nearby corporate offices. It is a common choice for office goers to sit down for a peg or two on a Friday night before heading home. The good thing is that the prices are a bit on the lower side and the food tasty enough. I would recommended the fish in mustard for first timers. I particularly didn't like the way the place was done up, sort of cramped and the tables placed very close to each other but if you are on a budget and on the lookout for a place which serves tasty food, then you can surely try Addiction.

Seeing rate of Aheli bengali veg thali, opted for friends reco addiction for Saturday dining.
Axis mall was coming alive with incoming increased customers,but we were early at restaurant hence could get seating easily. 
Options for veg were limited to choose from-started with manchow soup as tomato soup was not available. Accompanied by masala papad which was hard even asked fried one. 
Soup was appetising with crispy noodles. Topping of masala papad was not so exciting. Main course was veg kadai and roti+masala kulcha. Kadai was sufficient but with more oil and spice same was with kulcha. Pepper, Chilli flakes need to ne sorted out to reduce hotness. For residual veg ordered steam rice which was served late due to increased rush in restaurant. Rice was not worth mentioning anything special. 
Bill seems to be pocket friendly which was reason to visit addiction left us satisfied after dinner. 
Worth visiting if you are in Axis mall at dinner time!

2 months back: Over phone, we had checked the minimum delivery amount (which is Rs. 450/-) and if they deliver to DLF2. It was between 11:30 am and 12:00 pm that we had placed the order. Even though the store timing here reads that the store opens at 11 am, we were informed that the cook will be available by 12 o'clock so there will be a bit of delay, approx. 1 o'clock which we were fine with. However, the delay in delivery extended and finally it reached at 1:45 pm by which time we were feeling crazily hungry and bit worried as our schedule was in jeopardy. We still don't know why it took so long when the distance between the restaurant and the destination was not too much. The best thing about the service was the way the call attendant gave suggestions and idea about a particular dish. 

After going through all the reviews @ Zomato we zeroed in Chicken Tai Pai, Fish Begum Bahar, Kashmiri Polao, Naan, Chicken Lajawab. The taste of the food was ok. We found Chicken Tai Pai to be the best among what we ordered. It's a good option for food but not the one to make a foodie crave to choose this option again and again!

I visited the place with a group of my colleagues. 
The ambience:
We entered the place by around 1 PM. To my surprise, the tables were dirty and not clean. We had to stand there and wait for the staff to clean it up. Otherwise the ambience was average.
The service:
The service was good. The staff were helpful and cooperative.
The food:
We ordered Chicken tikka masala, chicken lababder, masala kulcha, vegetable pulav and gravy noodules. Both the chicken dishes were of standard cuisine and taste. They were fairly good but no innovation gone in there.
The pulav had lots of rose water in it. So not easily edible. 
The kulcha and roti were good.

Writing this review after dining at Addiction for 4-5 times. In the past we recommended this outlet to friends, but of late, it is becoming a bit boring. The bar area and the family dining area are not separate, which might be a problem if you are with family and not drinking. 
Food is worth the price, nothing great but good. 
Lack of innovative dishes is a problem.
A lot of items mentioned on the menu turn out to be unavailable, which is disappointing ...

Addiction (Axis Mall)
Date of Visit : 11/01/2014 (Dinner)

Must Try:
1. Chilly Chicken
2. Gobi Peswari
3. Chicken Labbadar (Off menu, chef special)
4. Chilly Garlic Chowmein

The 'Goods' : 
1. Great Food
2. Reasonably Priced
3. Good Quantity of Main Course

The 'Bads' :
1. Quantity is bad for starters
2. Service is average
3. Preparation time is bit lengthy 

Ambience : Average
Suggestions : The Tables are quite close to the bar which could pose a problem for people who don't drink

Final Word : Worth a visit

Went to this place with a contingent of office colleagues. The ambiance was just good with some sofas thrown around to infuse a sense of coziness. The bar was good, and to my surprise, the it was well stocked with variety of booze. It is not that in every bar you will find single malts in the likes of Laphroaig, Balvenie etc. And, the Johnny Walker labels as well.

We ordered some assortment of stuff. The starters were Kebabs and those were good. However, the Chinese dishes were kind of a dapper.  For those who frequents the restaurants in the China Town in Tyangra will find it hard to justify the thick coat of cornflower around the chicken pieces. You will expect it in a roadside joint, in your office canteen etc., but not in an upscale restaurant. Also, it is hard to justify the thick layer of oil floating over the chilli chicken. However, there will be takers for this as well as evident from the footfall.

Summarily, to me, it is a ok sort of place to visit and particularly when you just want to get high.

Update :- Skip the Chinese dishes at this place. I had visited it again few days back, and as usual, the Chinese was disastrous.

Yesterday I have been there to celebrate my anniversary with my boyfriend.  We ordered two smirnoffs with orange juice, American style sweet corn, tandoori roti, corn & chilli cheese kulcha paneer tikka butter masala & mutton rogan josh. I am starting with the drinks, it was good orange juice was really fresh. When it comes to food ir was all good kulchas were really soft & flavour full paneer was soft & the gravy was delicious. But the Mutton rogan josh failed to fulfil our expectations.  Though it was nice soft & tender but gravy didn't taste well. Otherwise service & staffs were really nice & attentive.  On the whole good experience & the value for food is also affordable.

I would actually rate this place 3.8 (the mobile app of zomato has only .5 incremental points) 

A good place to hangout after work on a friday.. I was visiting Kol over the weekend and was taken here by a friend.

I lover the food here....
Two things you must have here are..
1. Mutton bhunna (dry starter)
2. Cherry Pineapple &Cheese (dam gr8 and unique)

Service was also pretty decent (my frnd was a regular so did nt have problems)

Only thing they could work on woule be Decor its a bit drab...but ofcus if this is nt a big issue then definitely worth the money.

Addiction ( situated in Axis Mall Rajarhat) is one of the fine dining restaurants when it comes to quality & quantity of Food served..Ambience is pretty good - since it has a mixture of lounge , pub & dining area facility. They have gentle & polite staff who are helpful enough .. This place is descent if someone has to go out with office colleagues after a hectic schedule or small birthday party..It is very spacious & has a small smoking zone inside the area.  The food we ordered was really amazing - we had ordered Chicken Tai Pai , Crispy Chilli Baby Corn , Paneer Chand ka Tukra( though it was extremely sweetened)  with drinks . All of them tasted awesome, however one problem is they really do not have much options in Food or drinks.. when it comes to preparation of Cocktails , they drastically failed- since the Long Island Iced tea was horrible to taste.. However our mood softened when we were served dinner, again worth mentioning.. We did not have much options to order, so we had to take mix of Indian & Chinese Cuisines. Among the Chinese dishes Chicken Chilly garlic Fried rice , Chicken in Hun-an sauce spiced up the taste buds, but again the Cantonese noodles was pretty blank...In the Indian Cuisine section we ordered Indian Breads with Dal Makhani , Paneer Lababdar was again tantalizing & spicy .. Also worth mentioning is the Fish Begum Bahar & Kashmiri pulao which delighted us ..This place is definitely worth visiting atleast once.. And coming to the price it is descent & won't pinch the pocket much...

Addiction Is a pathetic Bar come restaurant in Newtown. They have all means to Fraud people. Firstly they will put all sorts of extra tax charges though they show cheap food and beverage charges on menu list. 
Firstly the customer service is poor, secondly none of the discount vouchers including club solitaire that they claim to give 15% discount on food and beverages apply. They fool people by showing " many conditions that may apply" to the discount coupons. So please be pretty sure of what they actually offer before you actually go there.

They fool people by cheap advertisements.

Addiction is really addictive. Recently visited with my office colleagues.In Axis mall this is the best bar and restaurant. The food is excellent. The Crispy Chilli Babycorn goes great with the drinks which are slightly more overpriced than Mehk e Punjab in the same floor. However, you really cannot compare Addiction with Mehk e Punjab. Addiction is way way better than Mehk considering ambience and also having a separate smoking zone. The place is very nice and waiters are good too. Waiting for my next visit.

This is definitely on of the best places to eat in Rajarhat and the best place in Axis mall and way better than Mahek-e-Punjaab and 47, South Tangra Road and even better than the Aaheli outlet here. 
The best thing about it is the Smoking Zone with a comfortable cushioned seat inside where you can sit and smoke after a few drinks....Bliss....
The next best thing is the ambiance which is I would say a bit classier out of the choices and the couches at the end are definitely way more comfortable. I just love their fish and chips....They are just awesome....I mean it with a layer of mustard marination and filled with fish this is a definite must try along with the Russian Salad. This is my normal menu when I sit down with a few drinks...I also liked the drums of heaven.
I just loved the fish begum bahar and the Kashmiri naan  also there was this Kashmiri Pulao or something which I liked....
At 135 for a B.P 60 ml and 160 for Antiquity Blue I think the bar is also pretty decent priced.
A must visit if you are at Axis Mall.

This restaurant is in Axis mall. Typically, not many people visits this place, hence getting a table is very easy even on the weekends and Friday evening hours. The place is clean, well decor-ed and helpful stuff make your experience pleasing.
Both indian and chinese cuisine were good. They prepare them based on your instruction of mild/medium spicy/spicy. I tried some chinese dishes (pan fried chinese noodles, chicken in hunan sauce) and they were well cooked and tasty. The amount per service was good enough for 2.
The bar is well stocked, the price is however on the higher side. They often run offers on popular brands, so you might try your luck.
There are separate sections with tables for dining and sofas for lounge kind of atmosphere. If you are visiting with your friends after a hectic day at office, relax on the comfy sofas while sipping your favorite drink and chatting with friends.
I rate this place 3.5 out of 5. If their liquor price is comparable to the direct competition (another bar-restaurant) across the floor, then the rating would be surely 4.

Great food, good ambience and reasonable price.The taste of the food makes you wanting for more. The support staff is very courteous and helpful. We have ordered a Tandoori Chicken (Full). The Chicken were really Good piece as well as tender. Then we ordered chicken Biriyani & chicken Lajawab. Lajawab as the name goes was superb! The only thing I found not much testier among the rest was the chicken piece in the biriyani though the size was good. Otherwise the Biriyani was also good. lastly we were served with a choice of Ice Cream I would have gladly given 5 stars. You can make out that it has been cooked by experienced hands. Overall, a good place to get adventurous with food & try out new recipes!

ADDICTIVE FOOD @ ADDICTION!
3 out of 5

The restaurant is located in Axis Mall Rajarhat New Town, and is therefore far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It can prove difficult for certain people to reach the place but it is a good option for a peaceful kind of dining. This place is worth all the trouble if you wish to avoid the crowd at the usual places. The place (without doing much) offers a unique and pleasant dining experience. The restaurant is spacious with comfortable sitting arrangements like luxurious white sofa and the more conventional table and chairs arrangement. 

Both their Chinese and North Indian fare is equally good. You can make out that it has been cooked by experienced hands. Some dishes are more popular than the others. For instance, their chicken tai pai tantalizes the taste buds with its tangy green sauce; similarly, their honey pepper chicken is a perfect combination of sweetness and spiciness. The same can be said for their North Indian meat items like fish begum bahar, chicken lajawab and chicken tangri kebab. The staples of both the cuisines - be it fried rice or pulao or biryani or Indian breads- are uniformly good. Their meat items are cooked to perfection. The meat portions are not only juicy and tender but served in generous amounts.

For those who love to drink, they have a well stocked bar. The service is prompt and efficient. The food tastes excellent and you can make out that they have an experienced chef. The prices are reasonable especially for the kind of food that you get here. The portions are ample and the quality is amazing. The food is so well made that you can't stop yourself from ordering a couple of extra dishes. 

Addiction is definitely one of the most happening and popular restaurant to have come up in the Axis Mall at Rajarhat New Town - the only tragedy is that it is too far to visit regularly.

A good place to 'lunch out' for office go'ers of the IT Sector - Sec V & Rajarhat, New Town. Good ambience and awesome food! Chicken Tai Pai, a heaped portion of small tender and juicy chicken pieces tossed in green tangy sauce was a refreshment to my taste buds. A sprinkle of lemon grass on the Thai rice gave it a nice flavour and aroma . The Honey Pepper Chicken, chunks of chicken in a sweet & spicy red gravy garnished with sesame seeds, is worth a try. Mind it, the chicken in chunks were as tender! Portions are real good, above average. Overall, a good place to get adventurous with food & try out new recipes!

The food is good, the bar is always well-stocked, and the service has always been helpful. The Hawaian Salad is worth trying out as well as the Chicken Tangri Kebab. A special shout out to the seating arrangement: different but cool!

Very nice food , great ambience. I tried mutton gilafi and chicken tangri kebab.. Both were awesome. Also the Hawaiian salad was delicious. In main course ,  both the mutton and chicken dishes had nice flavor.
