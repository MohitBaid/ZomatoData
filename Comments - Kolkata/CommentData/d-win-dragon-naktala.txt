We decided to have a relaxing time with our family on 31st night, and so we thought of ordering food from somewhere instead of cooking at home. I was browsing through the restaurants that deliver to my area on Swiggy when I suddenly came across this joint. I've never been to or ordered from D Win Dragon before, but I was pretty impressed with their wide menu and so decided to try this place out. 

Since I have not been to this restaurant, I am not going to rate the ambience or the staff. My rating is based purely on the food. 
What we ordered:
Veg Simple Fried Rice, Mixed Simple Fried Rice, Egg Asian Style Wok Tossed Noodles, Three Treasure Vegetable in Garlic Pepper Sauce, Grill Chicken Hot Basil, General Tao's Chicken, Fish in Butter Garlic Sauce. 

To start with, the quantity of food was abundant. 
Now coming to the taste and quality, the rice and noodles were well done. Nothing exceptional though.
The vegetable dish was good, with loads of broccoli, mushrooms and babycorn. The Grill Chicken Hot Basil was very very spicy, but the taste was good. General Tao's Chicken was also an okayish dish (extra points for 12 pieces of chicken!). The dish that really stood out for me was the Butter Garlic Fish. It was heavenly. The fish was soft and smooth, and it just melts in your mouth. I'm not too fond of white gravies, but I simply fell in love with this one! 

To top it off, what's cherry on the cake is the bill amount. We ordered so much food and yet the bill came to be only around ‚Çπ1200 (10% discount from Swiggy). 

Overall, a fantastic experience ordering from D Win Dragon. Even many of the big restaurants in the city tend to mess up their dishes on rush days such as the 31st. But such wasn't the case with this Chinese joint. A big thumbs up!

It's near nakatla dominos joint. A good place with good food in affordable price. Last night I had tom yum soup, pad thai noodles, chilli pork, ans fried rice.
All were good in taste and also in quantity..
Just a gentle reminder pls do request them to serve food with less spiecy..
We order pork mid spiecy.. which almost took our breath out.. apart from that I really appreciate their food quality.

If only good food is your basic need, this place will serve the purpose. Do not expect to have nice ambience,  you'll be disheartened. Pan fried momos were amazingly made,  a bit high in spiciness, though. Dry chilli paneer was good, but the quantity was not satisfying. We also ordered mee grob,  which was a combination of fried crispy noodles and crispy baby corn. But they made the dish with fried chow and not the noodles,  also the dish was very oily. The staffs were, however, very polite. The final amount to be paid was 500 bucks,  so very much pocket friendlyüòâ

Serves as one of my go to delivery joints. 
Stationed at naktala it delivers a pretty good chinese food. 
Well i often land up ordering chinese from this joint.
The most mentionable ones which i kinda like are:
Pan fried noodles, Pan Fried Chicken, Crispy Chicken , Hunan Fish. 
These are definitely recommended by me. 
The quantity can be improved a little bit.
The star performer for me is definetly the Pan fried noodles , you would love this from here. 
Though i have never really been to this joint in person also had a delivery optipn when i order from here. 
I would definitely recomend this place if you are looking for some good chinese options you can try this out.

I ordered simple egg fried rice and chilli chicken.
The fried rice was simple and pretty nice.
Now coming to the chilli chicken.
The 12 pieces were hard to find for counting. The pieces seemed to be made more of the outer coating than the chicken. The most delicious part- it was not spicy and tasted flat. I don't know who makes chilli chicken without spices.
Bad experience.

Bad as before delivery of the food they are marked as it delivered. After chatting with the customer care executive of Zomato I then called up this restaurant and they said that they have not yet ready with the order and they will leave in five minutes. I have to say for Zomato service delivery executive said that as I faced inconvenience with my order they will credit Rs.300 Zomato account but still not done and this is the second time that support executive has committed and it's not done what they have said. So suggest everyone not to use Zomato and you use Swiggy.

I have been ordering from this place for quite sometime. I have been ok with their food until yesterday. I ordered A combo meal. The items in the combo was ok but crispy babycorn. It had some foul smell and I doubt whether it was stale. I m not expecting some great taste but I request the restaurant to maintain the minimum standard of hygiene. I can compromise on the taste but not on food hygiene.

Welll...good place for some good food...but they need more improvement with their delicacies and food quality..but i have a objection over there..they charged extra for packaged drinking water over mrp...and according to supreme court section 36 of Legal Metrology Act clearly says anyone caught selling,distributing or delivering any pre-packaged commodity that does not conform to the declarations on the package shall be punished with fine up to Rs 25,000 for the first offence.It can increase to Rs 50,000 for second offence and subsequent offences can attract a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh or imprisonment for one year or both.

First time experience. And to be honest, I didn't expect it to be this good. 
Hunan Chicken and Mixed Shanghai Rice was very well made, with all the spices hitting at the right taste buds. 
The chef's special Chicken Dry was good but the seasoning should have been a little more pronounced. 
And last but not the least, the Complimentary Zomato treat - Honey Crispy Noodles with Peanut Crumbs was simply superb. A perfect end to a pretty good lunch.

If only your crispy chilli babycorn could be as crispy as your crispy chilli chicken. And the food quality has to be worked hard on. The amount is pretty fair, and your momos are losing their distinctiveness. See to it.

Looking to order a dinner through Zomato, I found this place. I liked the reviews and found this as a good option to order from the neighbourhood of Garia. The order was confirmed and arrived within 40 minutes through their delivery executive. The food was packed in containers as usual, and was hot.

Coming to the food, I ordered for chicken fried rice, chicken Singapore fried rice and chicken chilly garlic fried rice. The side dishes ordered were hot garlic chicken, and Hong Kong chicken. The quantity was decent but I really felt that the rice was a let down. It was having lack of right flavours, taste and the rice was hard boiled. The side dishes were however good in taste though the hot garlic chicken was on the sweeter side.

The pricing is much reasonable if you see the quantity. They added no taxes as well on delivery. The bill provided was a hand written one. 

Update: I was contacted by the team of win dragon and they requested to provide complimentary rice dishes owing to the bad experience I had earlier. I ordered for a chicken dish also alongside. This time the rice was better than before. But I still feel there is a lot of room of improvement for them. The chicken side dish had sliced pieces of chicken and was spicy hot. The most important thing, I loved the gesture of the management here who took the time to individually satisfy a client here. That's so rare these days. Great work.

Food quality: Bad, but to be truthful, it's okay-ish in terms of a small 'parar dokan' type of restaurant. To rate them only based on food quality, I would have rated them 2.5.

Food quantity: Really bad for the price they charge, especially looking at their competitors situated at golfgreen and garia. *Cough*hatari-chowman*Cough*

Management: The worst online representatives I have ever seen. They behave really unprofessionally towards guests who give them negative reviews. This is the sole reason I am rating this eatery one star. I really hope this isn't the same way they behave when customers visit their restaurant in person.

If anyone from the actual management department is reading this, then please make sure to give the responsibility of handling your zomato profile to someone else, or stick to some predetermined responses. Your management responses are truly disgusting.

As mentioned to be a fine dining restaurant, there was nothing I could relate to a fine dining restaurant. Even though they are confused with the dining segment, they are definitely not confused with the food. Ordered a veg momo which was decent but dry, then for main course had ordered chilli paneer and schezwan fried rice which were good and the quantity was good enough for 2 of us. 
Would define this place as more of an online delivery joint then a dine in restaurant.

There are restaurants where the food served is of such low standard that it makes you wonder what were the owners thinking when they decided to open a restaurant ? Because the main thing about any restaurant should be the food. Since they decided to invest so much, then why can't they find someone who actually knows something about the dishes that he/she is cooking. ? Just naming a dish pad thai does not make it a pad thai. Just throwing around some fancy names does not make the food eatable.

This is a nice and ¬†cozy Chinese restaurant. Having a nice decor this is a place ¬†which doesn't remain too crowded as I found home deliveries are more frequent from this place. I often visit this place and I have experimented with a lot of dishes. The dishes that I specially prefer in this restaurant are Hot Garlic chicken, ¬†chicken in black bean sauce and Lat Mat kai . Sea food fried rice ¬†and their pork dishes are also superb. Must add good quality with ¬†great quantity. The staffs are well behaved.

A rather dark ambience, which will give you a chinese restaurant feel. The wallpapers have been designed that way. Overall its okay nothing special you can comfortably sit and have your food. The menu has a variety of dishes chinese, thai etc. We ordered Chinese chopsuey, Hot garlic chicken and veg fried rice. The Chinese chicken chopsuey was good. I wish the gravy was a little thinner so that the fried noodles could have soaked it better. Vegetables were a little raw but not that noticeable to the mouth. Overall the quantity of dish was satisfying. The Fried rice was a let down cause the rice was a bit starchy and sticked to each other and they had added sweet corn which somehow didn't match with the fried rice. The Hot Garlic Chicken was absolutely delicious with 10 pcs chicken. And the chicken so tender, soft and juicy I don't know how did they managed to do it. The sauce was nice, hot and flavoursome and left a light tinge of sweetness at the end which I liked a lot. The total bill was 485/- incl. of all taxes. Which I think is very reasonable for two people. Again quantity is very satisfactory. Its worth a visit for a good chinese meal. Thumbs up.

The rating 5 is not for food but how they value customers. When i ordered thukpa online, the food i received was not upto the mark. After reading my review, i got a call that a fresh order will be delivered at my doorstep and they apologized for the previous food they sent which was way too spicy. Now thats enough for a customer to feel valuable. The food they sent second time was just good!!

Very disgraced to treat family from here. Everybody was shocked to see a restaurant like this exists. Bland food, over spiced food like Momo chutney cooked over raw fish.

Been there once and ordered food from here few times. It is a small,nearly unnoticeable place opposite to DoMino's outlet near Usha bus stop. The interiors are humble and not much attractive. The food on the other hand is value for money. The prices are easy on the pocket and service is quick. The quantity they serve in Rice and Noodles per plate, is pretty sufficient for two people. Good for home delivery.

We had ordered online through Zomato for a Sunday Lunch. Ordered Lat Mat Kai Chicken, Wok Tossed Hakka Noodles, Fish in Black Bean Sauce. Food was delivered within an hour. Packaging was OK & so was the quantity of food. Coming to taste, we liked the Noodles & Lat Mat Kai chicken. The fish preparation could have been better. The fish was too soft & was difficult to handle with the cutlery. Overall a good experience. Will order something else next time.

And the chicken item was unique as well as damnnnn spicy.it actually blew me away with its spice!! But the quality and quantity was more than satisfactory!  Giving my first 5star rating.

A real Asian cuisine, best thing it is the taste, it's like a fresh feel when you have some real good cooked food and you chew it good to have a long lasting taste and the price is minimal too. A 100% recommendaion for a must visit resturant in kolkata.

We ordered konjee crispy fried chicken(really tasty it was),d.w.d special mixed noodles(quite spicy),devils pork(i loved it,pork pieces were tender and the gravy was hot and spicy ). They served quickly and nicely.
At the end I would say "You dont need to be a Big place to be a Good place."

Located beside the Domino's inside a small lane D Win Dragon caters to a variety of Chinese, Tibetan and Thai cuisines.
A small yet cozy place can accommodate 15-20 people at a go.
Would definitely not rate it as a Fine Dining Restaurant, but, will definitely give a thumbs up if it is about the quality, quantity and price tag.
Their Momo and Thupka is pure love. 
Have dined in a dozen of times and have never been disappointed even a bit.

I was very happy with the quality of food they serve. The pork was pretty much one of those dishes which you would love to have over and over which was without any unnecessary fat. I loved the lamb too though that was too plain but it was tasty. I can't comment on their interiors as I ordered the food from swiggy and I would  love to have their food again.

The restaurant is located near Usha mor opposite to mio amore and can be spotted easily...it is a small joint and the interior is well decorated...it can accommodate maximum 20 people at once. Coming to the menu it consists of Chinese and Tibetan items starting from veg, chicken to lamb and pork. We ordered 2 wok tossed veg Hakka noodles and one veg Manchurian as the friend of mine who went there with me is a vegetarian. The noodles was prepared nicely along with the veggies without being too oily and the quantity was ample...we had a hard time finishing the noodles and the Manchurian gravy tasted good but the Manchurian balls were a little dry from inside.
The overall experience was good and it was also inexpensive. The ambience is clean and nice...a good place for enjoying Chinese and Tibetan cuisines at a reasonable price.

Although went inside with some apprehensions but came out pretty satisfied.  Ordered thupka and sweet corn soup along with shangai rice and fish in butter garlic.  The food came in ample quantities.  Although it was nothing exceptional in terms of taste,  the ambience, courteous staffs and the quantities of food served deserves a 4 star.

I have been visiting this place past a few months and I am really impressed by the food quality, quantity and ambiance of this restaurant. The people who serve the customers are very cordial. I have also ordered food for home-delivery and the service was really quick. I love the delicious Noodles they make and the aroma of the food is fresh. Looking forward to try more cuisines here. Although everything is amazing here still there is always room for improvement in any business. I hope to enjoy more meals here in the coming years. Best Wishes. Keep up the great work.

This is a small restaurant located beside Naktala Domino's. It is solely devoted at making chinese dishes. Food over here is justly price with respect to quality and quantity. Try out their momos, you will not be disappointed. Also their shredded chicken is extremely tasty. 
There is no as such ambience or good presentation of food. But their food is tasty. Try for a home-delivery. The rating is totally based on the quality of food.

This is one of our regular haunts after coming back from office or when we are too lazy to cook on holidays. We visit almost three to five times a month; that's a lot of frequency. That is probably due to the good quality of food. The staff and owner are very hospitable and they even accommodated us on a late night around 11:00 pm. We generally have whatever the staff suggest and have been experimenting lately with the different choices that are on offer. So far we have not been disappointed and hope we continue to enjoy this little jewel in Naktala

D-Win Dragon was referred to me by a cousin of mine who happened to have a quick bite here a while back. Decided to go for lunch here a few days back with specific intentions of trying out a pork and a lamb dish. Not many places in and around Garia - Naktala cater to complete meat cravings and D win Dragon is amongst the rare few who do. 
Location & Ambience - The place is very conveniently located and is easy to find. The ambience is not much but they have turned it into a decent spot for a small space. The seating arrangements are not worth mentioning and neither too comfortable. Minimal decor with dim lights and soft music in the background makes up for the glitches. Not a fancy dining experience, but nothing unworthy either. (Rating: 3.5/5)
Staff & Service - Very humble and decent staff. They are well-spoken, prompt and they definitely know their menu. All the dishes we tried was on their reference and it was a great experience overall. We were the only people at that time, so whether their efficiency staggers while handling more guests at once or not is something I'm not sure about. Hospitality is a key and they win at that. (Rating: 4/5)
Food - Coming to the main business, the food was delicious and our lunch at this quaint little restaurant was one of the best experience around this area. We took Mixed Meifoon, Double Fried Pork and Lamb in Hot Garlic Sauce along with Fresh Lime Soda to Wash it down with. Quantity was ample and more than sufficient for two people. Meifoon was nothing extraordinary and tasted decent. Lamb in hot garlic sauce was very good. The meat was soft and it was a good blend of taste. The double fried pork was a show stealer for me. One of the best pork dishes I've tried around this region in a long while. Succulent, juicy, not at all chewy and cooked to perfection. Highly recommended. The fresh lime soda was fizzy and proper. (Rating: 4.5/5)
Value for Money - Extremely easy on the pocket. D win dragon is one of those joints where you can come starving and walk out more than satisfied without shelling out much. Great value for money and delightfully excellent quality & quantity. Definitely a thumbs up from me! Must Try!! (4.5/5)

Had a horrible experience today after ordering via swiggy. I had ordered pad thai noodles & thai crispy chicken but instead they sent me some variety of friedrice instead of my pad thai. Cheats!! The mixed rice dish sent was also disastrous. Lacking in taste although the quantity was huge but whats the point if you cant provide quality.
Even their crispy thai chicken was horrible in the sense that they had overfried the chicken to the core that it was barely eatable. Wont recommend this place to anyone

 Interior is well decorated and the staff are friendly. Soup are very tasty. Try Lemon Coriander Thick Soup. 
Also main course has lots of variation specially meat section which you hardly get in any local restaurant nearby and it does taste really well.
Pricing is good compared to quantity.
Overall a nice eatery located just near to where I stay.

Very good food. Prompt home delivery. The mixed fried rice is extremely well cooked with sufficient amount of chicken egg prawn, the quantity is too much not at all possible by one person. Exactly 2 people can complete it..both quality and quantity is good. The hot garlic chicken, devils chicken both are good. Hot garlic is awesome. Very small 12 pieces of well marinated chicken cubes in a light gravy little spicy and awesome taste. I am a regular customer since both the price is pretty economic as well as the taste is awesome.

Had Schezwan veg noodles, chicken pan-fired lollipops, shredded garlic chicken.
The price of the items were reasonable enough and so was the quantity of food.
However the lollipop were a bit disappointing in terms of taste, had the crisp, the spicy taste but the chicken tasted to a very similar bengali sweet called 'malpowa'.
Ambiance was missing during the hot sultry afternoon, but of course friendly waiters and good service as well. Waiting to taste Kathmandu Momo.
¬†P.S. - Should focus on the entrance, should be tidy and smell nice, these were a bit downer.

To start with I always have my food home delivered as it's near my locality. So it's a win win situation for me. Few weeks back I visited this place. Please don't judge by it's appearance. The ambiance is quite dull. But what chilled up my mood is the food. I order pan fried momo and shredded spicy chicken.
It's the best momo I had after so many years. It was a bit spicy but I liked it. Spicy chicken is a bit expensive compared to the other restaurants nearby. And also the quantity was also pretty less. Service is excellent. It just needs to improve it's interior decor and ambiance. Otherwise I would recommend everyone to visit this place. 

Oh yes please do visit the washroom guys. ?

Service was quick, got my order within 25 mins. I never bothered to dine over there, since it is very near my 
house I usually order over phone to get my food delivered. Price is moderate, fried rice,  Chicken starters and sides cost around Rs 500. Good option for Kolkatan Chinese food if you are staying nearby.

This restaurant is situated near the Usha Bus stop. It is an oddly placed restaurant, a narrow staircase leading to the one storied dine-in. The ambiance, whatever it was targeted to be, to me feels gloomy. The food, however lifted my mood. The gravy chowmein was savory, and so was the pan fried chicken. And before I forget to mention, they have the funniest placed washroom I have ever seen.

This place is really good. The dine in place is small. It's basically a take away shop. But they make really good Chinese food. Try thier shredded chilli chicken it's really good, they give good quantity also. A pocket friendly restaurant. I like this place. Service is also good & the people who work there are also good. If you dine in there please don't use their loo it's a mess. Apart from that they are really good. Thumbs up ????

It was a almost a year back, I had it from my friends while having their momos, I had it in mind for a visit to the Place. I managed on this 1st Jan skipping my work, with a high hope of having a quiet belly full at DWD. The first shock was recived by their creepy staircase, which is filthy , smelly and would be ¬†difficult for aged ones or the person having HBP to climb. The interior was at least well -lit, but not well-maintained. The last nail in the coffin was the "Darjeeling Thukpa ".. which I can make far better in any day, in any circumstances. Last but not the least bothering was the Price, which easily can compete with Chinatown or even Park St. I felt like crushing while jumping ¬†down through the Glass ARCH in front of the Restro..

This place definitely satisfied my taste buds pretty well. I ordered chilly baby corn cus I was literally dying to eat chilly baby corn. 
This place is pretty close to my house, so it's a win win for me when it comes to home delivery. 
Precisely their home delivery service is pretty fast. 
Coming back to the food 
Chilly baby corn - not too oily , perfectly cooked (just the way I like it) well packed. Thumbs up !! oh also no extra charges for home delivery !

We came upon this joint pretty recently after my friend had heard from someone that they serve great momos, so we started ordering only momos from this place and ordered other chicken, pork, fish, lamb dishes from Hatari during our weekend get togethers. One day we decided to give the starters and the main course from this place a try and we were left spell bound. Over the course of 5-6 orders from this place since, we have tried out numerous dishes all tasting great be it chinese or thai, some of the special mentions being shanghai chicken, salt and pepper chicken, pan fried fish and of course the momos, specially the pan fried and tung tohn(fried thai dumplings). From the main course you just cannot do without the chow chow rice, and the steam rice with green or red curry, they are simply heavenly.

This has now become one of our regulars and will keep on experimenting with different items from their menu.

The worst Chinese food I ever had. After trying dishes from this restaurant somehow I felt either not to have Chinese Dishes ever in my life or not to try from this restaurant. I ordered for some non-veg dishes to be conveyed at home. There were fish and chicken appetisers. Both of them tasted identical. The fish dish was musty and we had to throw it in the bin. The Chicken dish was such insipid to taste that finally it also had the similar destiny. The bill was somewhat around 600/- and all went for waste. Till then it‚Äôs my curiosity that frequently haunts me about the genuine purpose of opening this joint. Is it for serving decent food or just for mugging people and making them dupe? I modestly request the proprietor to close this joint at the earliest. Also this is an appeal to all would be consumers not to visit or call (for deliveries) this restaurant ever. BE AWARE.

After hearing mixed reviews finally decided to check out the food on the occasion of Vishwakarma Puja..
FOOD(3.5/5)-„ÄãAs I was hearing only average reviews about food so decided to go safe, so I ordered CHICKEN PAN FRIED MOMO. Momo was not that special that I will go again..but no that bad..quite average! !
LOCATION & SERVICE-„Äã This restaurant is just beside DOMINO'S Naktala; near usha gate. My ordered was ready after 10 minutes and the staff attending was well behaved. 
So, food is average. . Not a must visit type!!
 P.S.-This review is based on take away as we don't have time for seat and eat!!

"The worst chinese food I have ever had"

To try out the food from varied restaurants, ordered the food to D Win Dragon, for home delivery on Saturday- Singapore noodles and Crispy chilly baby corn, as NO fish item was available. :(

The¬†preparation¬†of chilly baby corn was the terrible. The fried layer was not crisp at all and super hard to chew. It had no baby corn inside and not even tossed in¬†tomato¬†sauce (as instructed). The¬†Singapore¬†noodle was tasteless.
The food was so pathetic that I had to order the food from another¬†restaurant. The food was not at all worth a single penny.¬†

NOT¬†RECOMMENDED....Order at your own risk.

This place is extremely overpriced and not worth the penny spent. They promise authentic Tibetan food but all you get is bland and tasteless Chinese. 
I've tried their Chinese salad (crispy noodle salad) and I paired it with veg schezwan fried rice and mixed veg in chilli soy sauce. 
The fried rice was sticky and the side dish was too sweet for my taste. 
Coming to the Chinese salad it tasted a little off balance as well. During that time they didn't have a seating arrangement as they've now, hence I cannot comment on anything. 
Oh also.. That time they gave 10‚Çπ off for orders above 150

D Win Dragon is a very reasonable restaurant which is very popular in the locality. To start with, the ambience is just acceptable as a deep red colour doesnt suit all the time. The whole restaurant has 16-18 covers and most of its customers prefer home delivery. The food is average and all their starters are SWEET....yes! The price is very much affordable and one can have a filling meal within 500 rupees.

They prepare very good food. Their variety of dishes is very good. But after their dine in was made take away service has degraded. And prices are gone up a little bit. Otherwise a good place to have tibetan cuisine.

I have frequented this place a few no of times as its located near my place. Although the ambiance is ok, I haven't yet sat down there for a meal as I had always ordered take-outs. The food quality is good, real good and the staff is very friendly. From the outside it wont look like a place u wanna go, but trust me the food is nice and you will like it. it is located just opposite to dominos, so u can say it exists in the shadow of a big food chain, but it does pretty well to make a name for themselves. Their momo though on the pricey side if u compare it with street vendors, has excellent taste. I would recommend this place for everyone to have a visit just for the taste.

Food was good, bt the prices hs been tremendously increased. Given the location & type of cuisine prices should be re-looked, good if the owner reads this
