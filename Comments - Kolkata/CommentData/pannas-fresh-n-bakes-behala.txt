Panna has been ruling the Behala Trap Depot Area from decades with their oil mill, restaurants, and sweet shops. The latest addition to their business is the ‚ÄúPanna‚Äôs fresh N Bakes‚Äù bakery shop. And it has increased the competition in the area. I must agree, I was kind of fed of with the Monginis (Mio Amore) and Bake Club cakes with no variety. While introduction of Panna‚Äôs Bakery has completely changed the game.
                                                                ...

Recommended for a quick bite. The Chocolate pyramid is one of my favourites, it's a must try there. Chocolate cone is equally nice. Worth the bucks.

Rulling over brands..is what seems to be the main objective of this outlet from inception and they has been doing that in style. Took away cakes for couple of times and they are really eye catcher. Also we had pastries, which are delicious as well. I will love to see other chains of this entity in near future.

If you've been to Mio Amores, Sugarr and Spice or even Kathleens thrown around this city of joy (and food, maybe?) around every corner, Panna's no different. The only thing is, they just have one branch and if you're passing by Behala or like us, get tired and hungry and end up being around this place after a tiring day of puja outing, you'll have to be here. Every food, snacks, and cakes looked absolutely fresh. The buns were soft, and the chicken hotdog we had was real yum. If you're a vegan and still crave for cakes, no worries, eggless chocolate cake was a treat. All there were ready-made sandwiches as well, just made and served. The birthday or occasional cakes were really decorated and I absolutely loved the one shaped like Taj Mahal. Prices are reasonable as well. The only problem one might face, if you're planning to eat there, the place inside is really cramped and if it gets slightly crowdy, you'll have a hard time to even stand properly. If you take your food outside - please don't. Crowds and terrible smells from the fish markets around won't let you even taste your food. The staffs were good, and friendly. Pretty good place to have a quick snack.

If you are having cake-cravings this is the shop you need to visit. Far better than many other overrated ones. A nice chocolate cake with fillings of choco chips,coffee flavour and caremalized toffees is what you will get here at a price of Rs.270/- only. Even the smaller ones of Rs.30 or 40/- are equally mouth watering. Love this shop!

When we visited this Behala area during Durga pujo, after having sandesh from Panna sweets we decided to try out pastries here and got a few assorted ones packed to take home to consume later. It's a small shop, not too big but had a vast array of pastries, cakes, muffins and savoury items. The prices were reasonable too. But I really didn't like their stuff much, can't pinpoint exactly why, too creamy maybe! Chocolate taste not as good as in other places, could be! Don't really know, it wasn't bad perse but nothing to praise lavishly, not missing much. But I guess it's a good place for the locals to frequent for their cakes and baked items.

Highly satisfied with the pocket friendly items!

It seems behala tramdepo is ruled by panna . They have oil mill, restaurant, bakery and now they even have two sweet shops. Their sweets have always been the best compared to the competitors around. Now coming to this shop, I have tasted lots of pasteries, savouries and birthday cakes. Presentation and taste both are equally top notch. I wish the shop was larger to accommodate more people.

This shop is now one of my best cake shops. Through out behala perhaps this is the best one. Though I don't know much of behala's oli golis. However I visited here many times and took their veg sandwich, Chicken sandwich(they served it grilled), apple pie, rich chocolate pastry. Each n every item is just up to the taste.Chicken sandwich is one of the best items.. However they served it grilled.. Just Melt in my mouth .. So soft bread. I'll surely visit here for more items to taste üòã

A new addition to the Panna chain. Situated at behala tramdepot just beside Panna Oilmill. It has the best collection of cakes and pastries, be it mousse, muffin, fudge, brownie or birthday cakes. They also keep dark chocolates for sale. There are also other itmes like sandwich, wraps, pizza etc..but can't really say as I have not tasted them. I had their chocolate delight which was really good. Will pay a visit again to try out other items.

A good bakery in this area. Pocket friendly as well. Panna is a common name in Behala when it comes to restaurants and sweet shops. This bakery shop is an addition to it. I have tried their Black Forest cake, Mud Chocolate, Chicken Twist, and some chocolate pastries. All of them are good in quality and taste. I buy cakes and snacks from them pretty often. And would recommend the people of Behala to try out this bakery shop.

I ordered three cakes from here.. If you're looking for birthday cakes then this place provides some really tasty cakes with fresh cream.
6 pounds chocolate birthday cake: the cake was for my sister's birthday, I bought a 4 pound and a 2 pound cake and made it two tier at home, they also deliver fondant cakes but I dint opt out for that, so the decoration of making it two tier cake was done by me but the cake was really show stealer, everyone praised with smile.
1 pound pineapple cake: another awesome cake, with fresh pineapple slices and the cream and flavor, it's better to taste it than to hear it.
1 pound mango cake: the only cake that was not satisfying for me and my family. Unlike my past experiences, this cake was less decorative, the only thing above was mango slices which wasn't fresh and was actually disturbing the taste of the cake, not recommended this one atleast.
Overall, a great cake shop at behala if you really want to taste good cake.

Had tried pineapple pastry earlier which was amazing in taste. Today ,we got a chocolate birthday cake. The cake is small in size but enough to serve around 12 people. It was tasty. Cakes from other peer cake stores in Behala stand nowhere to the taste and quality of cake from Panna's bakery.The cake was soft,with crunchy nuts inside. Lookwise too, the cake was greatüòò
Totally satisfied. üëç
Looking forward to try all the items from this bakery!!

There is not a single dish that you won't love here.. Awesome cakes, muffins, mousse, dark chocolates, sandwich, pizza and the list goes on. Be it any occasion, this is where I head to as I know that they won't disappoint. It was my parent's anniversary and I ordered a picture cake.  The cake was superb and was delivered right on time..  My personal favourite is their pizza and I try not to miss it each time I visit their outlet.. And the cherry on the top is the extremely affordable price that too with such great taste.

Panna is trying to establish its monopoly over everything in Behala and 'Panna's Fresh and Bakes' is the newest entry in the confectionary market of Behala and it has the potential to give tough competition to the likes of 'Mio Amore' and 'The Sugarr & Spice'. 

This confectionary shop is located just beside Panna Oil Mill in Behala. I went here a few days ago. The shop is very small, but they have a huge variety of different sweet and savoury items. The savoury items were kept in trays or baskets in the shelves and they made sure that they were covered all the time by plastic. 

I went for one chicken envelope first. The chicken envelope was delicious and it had ample amount of delicious chicken in it. Up next, I went for the 'French Hotdog'. It was made up with boiled eggs amd chicken strips and had an excessive amount of green bell peppers. It was good but not great. Finally, I went for the 'Mud Chocolate'. The mud chocolate was yummy, gooey dollops of happiness. It was delectable. 

All in all, a good outlet and I will visit again.

The savoury items were kept in trays or baskets in the shelves and they made sure that they were covered all the time by plastic. 

I went for one chicken envelope first. The chicken envelope was delicious and it had ample amount of delicious chicken in it. Up next, I went for the 'French Hotdog'. It was made up with boiled eggs amd chicken strips and had an excessive amount of green bell peppers. It was good but not great. Finally, I went for the 'Mud Chocolate'. The mud chocolate was yummy, gooey dollops of happiness. It was delectable. 

All in all, a good outlet and I will visit again.

Its near behala tramdepot and offer a variety of pastries.I loved their chocolate mud which comes in a cute transparent cup.The chocolate cone was okay.The downside for me is that similar pastries are available at a lower price.

Located in behala tram depo. A cake shop with no sit in. But their cakes are unique, cheap and Oh so tasty. One of the best cakes I have tasted. They have different designs and different types of cakes everyday. And I love how their cakes are so affordable. Love it.

Located near Behala Tram Depot, just beside Panna oil mill - this is one of the bakery shop that serves fresh pastries at a reasonable rate. Would recommend to try out their black forest cake.

This place is a relatively new addition to the wide range of stores under the name of Panna in Tramdepot region of Behala. The erstwhile huge Panna Oil Mill has been bisected into two smaller shops, one being the Panna Oil Mill and the other being Panna's Fresh N Bakes. Hence, this place does not have the luxury of space and understandably, they do not have any seating arrangements and often gets a little overcrowded with the presence of only 6-7 customers. However, they have strategically used up whatever space is available to them. It is a small shop serving pastries, cakes, hotdogs, pizzas, croissants and a few other confectioneries. I have visited this place a couple of times. I have tried their Blueberry Pastry, Chocolate Pastry and Chocolate Cake. Both the pastries were exquisite and are a must-try for everyone. Although the price is reasonable, the quantity of each pastry is a bit too less. Increasing the price slightly with no compromise on quantity or quality is something I would like them to adhere to. Nevertheless, the pastries were superb. The Chocolate Cake I had was bought for my cousin's anniversary. The cake was very good too. It had a layer of chocolate chips and caramel nuts similar to the ones we find in Cakes or Kookie Jar cakes. This layer alters the taste of the cake to a great extent. This cake is recommended as well!
I have seen that they have a wide collection of cakes and would really love to try them out in the future. The absence of a Mio Amore or a Just Baked outlet in this area makes this the only standard bakery and confectionery store here. Hence, it attracts a fairly big crowd. The only competitor it has is a The Sugarr¬†and Spice store but this place serves much better food than the S&S outlet. This is a good initiative that they have taken to introduce a good bakery store in this area and hopefully, they will be able to raise their standards similar to that of Cakes or Kookie Jar someday. If you are in this part of Behala, do give this place a visit. You will not be disappointed.

This bakery was inaugurated last year. Located just beside panna oil mill at behala tram depot. I was quite fascinated by their beautifully decorated cake ideas. The cake designer himself used to greet us at the shop for the first few months. They bake beautiful padtries like chocolate, butterscotch, strawberry, blueberry, mango etc. Eggless cakes are also available. Their 1lb cakes range from 250 to 450 bucks depending upon flavour and special touches. Pastries cost from 20 to 40 bucks. They also bake pizzas, hotdogs, muffins, croissants.  The first cake they baked for me was a specially ordered 2lb pineapple cake for my om and dad's birthday. I was quite shocked by the perfection and mouthwatering taste. Later i bought several birthday cakes from them for different occasions. Their chocopie is a must have. Just 25rs. The base of their chocolate cakes contain chocochips and caramelised nuts. Wonderful. Better than Cakes , Bake my cake, French loaf and any other bakery considering the low price and astonishing taste and decorations.
