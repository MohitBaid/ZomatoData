Food is good and being a place nearby is a good place to hangout with friends... Been there for a couple of times but couldn't find anything other than a kingfisher beer in that category... Though will still suggest people to visit the place.. Staff is extremely friendly & service is prompt.... The hookah is best served in this place...

*Location: On the 5 th floor of diamond plaza mall, opposite to PVR cinema.

*Interior and ambience: Two sections. One for family bar, another for hookah. Nothing special about the interior decoration. Ambience in family restaurant and bar section is good.

*Food: Food quality is average. PAN FRIED CHILLI FISH- Though they used good quality sauces the fish was not good.
CHICKEN LAT MEI KAI: It could have been better. Somehow  the wow factor was lacking in the sauce.

KASTURI MURG: the gravy was rich with many spices and flavours. It tasted nice with perfectly made PLAIN NUN. But chicken pieces were mostly bony.

CHICKEN STEAK: Average.
* Service: slow service. Staffs are not well acquanted with the menu.
* Pocket pinch is high. Alcohol is too costly. Food is not at all pocket friendly.

Food quality is below the level..i have never experienced this kind of unprofessional service..they couldn't even remember what we've ordered...they took more than half an hour to to serve a screwdriver.
The most funny part is they dont have enough beer glasses to provide. ..no collection of regular whiskey
..i am a regular visitor of dimond plaza and it was my first visit to this place..i was disappointed very much...

The food is good but the price is extreme high. The service is extremely bad. First of all they are not coming to take the orders and when we were asked them to take orders they were just pulling each other that who will take the order. After that when we have finished our food and asked for bill they took 15minutes to give the bill and then three of them asked us one by one cash or card but no one is coming with the card swiping machine, they took at least 30 minutes to bring the card swiping machine. Overall the experience is not at all good as a first time visitor.

Located right inaide the mall, on the floor of the auditoriums, its easy to hop in here and get in to watch movies. The place cant be described as out of the world, but is just about right and strikes the right chords most of the times. We sat in the place where hookahs arent available. They have a space for hookahs as well. The staffs are courtaeous, but probably a little inexperienced. Looked a little puzzled accepting orders. The foods and drinks are fairly priced, and we could cash in on an offer on liqor. The mocktails are well prepared. The foods are also well prepared. The lamb they served needs a special mention here, as it stole the show. The fish florentine was not how it tastes in mocambo, but its good in its own way. The salads are also quite sumptuous. The good thing bout this place is that they use good quality materials to prepare the food. Be it the quality of the lamb or the fish. We concluded with baked rosogolla, which somehow let things a little down for me. Have had better. 
This place did almost everything right, but somehow, somewhere, the wow factor was missing.

11 to 11 is a perfect example of how a place can change from good to bad to worse. I have been here multiple times and found that the service and food keep deteriorating. So this is the final nail in the coffin and will be my last and final visit to this pathetic restaurant.
It seems like a completely messy place with no co-ordination between the staff, you order something they bring something else, they charge you twice for something then will argue that you had ordered ( how the hell they can say That if I didn't order and eat that item).
The food was absolutely tasteless and had to be prepared again. It seems they brought the order from some other restaurant.
The place is now becoming less family friendly and more of a bar.
Needless to say the prices are any way over charged as compared to the standard of the restaurant. Places like this will close soon if they are not able to take care of their customer and most importantly the regular customers.

We ordered chicken steak, Chinese chopsuey , Singaporean chicken rice noodles, basket chilly chicken, sizzling hot chocolate brownie with ice cream, virgin mojito, shahi tukda. Chopsuey was really tasteful.. The concept of basket chilly chicken was really innovative. It was a bit spicy which I actually liked.. Rice noodles was the best among all.. We hated the chicken steak... The brownie was a bit hard which was a disappointment among all the foods we had.. Virgin mojito was good.. Shahi tukda was also yummy... Overall the place is good and pocket friendly.. No complaints.... They must improve the cooking part of the brownie.. That's it

It's one of those places where it's a mixture of a lounge-pub-restaurant. So you can go there for anything you wish for.. I went there for dinner. And, it was a nice experience. The dal Makhani was tasty, diwani handi (fancy name for mix veg ) was lil sweet for my tastebuds but it was nice. Masala kulcha was fine and so was the tandoori roti. I felt that the kulcha I ordered the next time was a lil different in taste but all ok in the end. You can give it a try tooðŸ™‚

Today went there at lunch time to have continental food. The menu card lists some continental items but not with any description, which is most important for continental dishes. The service boy initially couldn't tell any description like what are the things will be coming with a particular dish. Later he went to the kitchen and tell somewhat descriptions. We ordered chicken stroganoff & chicken tetrazinni casserole. 

The restaurant was empty we being the only customer. We had to wait around 30min to get our food. And surprisingly both the dishes looked the same. On asking the service boy told one is with mushroom & other is not. Taste wise it was ok but if told this earlier we could've ordered another dish. At dessert we ordered Fried ice cream, it came quickly. Outside crust was not hot at all and not good at taste. When we're midway having the dish, found some small human hair firmly stuck with the outer fried crust. On complaining they were telling to replace, but we didn't want. So they didn't charge the amount in bill. 

Not at all a good experience.

Well I was pleasantly surprised to find such good food here. I walked in casually for a dinner with family and though there is loads of scope to improve the interiors , the food was brilliant. At par with calcuttas best restaurants. I hope they manage to maintain their quality and if possible , manage to make the interiors a lil more classy.

P.s. When I checked Zomato I found this place wasn't rated too high and ppl love the decor and don't quite like the food. I had an absolutely opposite experience .

We were the only customers..
The place was good enough 
And well furnished.
The staffs were very well behaved attentive and hospitable ,but the service was very slow.
Coming to food 
The taste could have been better,
But the  show stealer was the desert which was  magnificent to look and delectable to taste.
Overall the food ambience and the location all are good.
Since it is a newly opened restaurant hope there
 would be improvement with time.

We actually went to have lunch in Bhojohori Manna, which was too full so came here out of compulsion to have their Special Veg Naboborsho Thali. It consists of Aam pora shorbot, Basanti pulao, Jhuri aloo bhaja, Beguni, Aloo posto, Dhokar dalna, Potol er dorma, Cholar dal, Koraishutir kochuri, Chatni, Papad, Doi, Mishti. The thali costs around Rs.500, which was really reasonable. But food quality was not good at all. The Potol er dorma was actly just a curry without any filling inside, they dont even know what exactly is Potol er dorma and they are serving bengali cuisine. Dhokar dalna was too sweet. And what are we suppose to have the Jhuri aloo bhaja and Aloo posto with?? Because there was no white rice served. The Aamer chatni was too tangy. So overall quantity and looks were there but with absolutely Zero Quality. The restaurant shouldn't serve Bengali Cuisine just for the sake of it when they actually know nothing about it. Service though was really one of the good factors.

Today was Bengali new year. I went to Bhojohori Manna with my family members. Unfortunately, it was too crowded and waiting time was for more than 2 hours, hence we decided to go to 11 to 11 opposite Bhojohori manna. It was offering Non veg and Veg thali, which consists aam pana, 2 pcs luchi, dhokar dalna, pulao, mutton kosha, Chingri malaikari, chatni, rosogolla, dahi and paan.
Hence entered here and ordered 2 non veg thali and 1 veg thali. We had to wait in table for 40 mins. After that when food arrived, it was a big disappointment. There was no luchi, no dhokar dalna, no aam paana, no chingrir malaikari. Instead of dhokar dalna, they gave potoler torkari (which was not tasty at all). Food was cold and tasteless. But we were too hungry hence started eating. Other customers faced the same as well. After calling them (staff & manager) for a while they managed to give 1 luchi, watery thumbs up (instead of aam pana), they were unable to provide dhokar dalna, sweet card etc as per menu. Luchi was made of aata. They were unable to provide paan as well, as mentioned in menu. Most of the customers left after waiting as they ran out of food to serve. Now coming to the billing part. We complained to the manager and asked him to reduce the bill, as nothing were served as per menu.
Bill amount was 2079/- for 2 non veg and 1 veg thali. They gave us 10% discount and final bill was 1905/- . My overall experience was terrible.I will never go there again for sure.

This restaurant is a newly launched one and is situated just beside the PVR ticket counter on the fifth floor in Diamond Plaza Mall, Nagerbazar where The Village was situated earlier! 
We visited this restaurant after our movie show and the place was totally empty!  They have divided the restaurant in 3 sections of which one will be soon converted to a lounge which would serve Hookah! 
The ambience is good and its a well interiored restaurant, but hardly anyone is seen inside it! :p
Coming over to food- We ordered Paneer Tikka, Mixed Vegetables Curry, Masala Kulcha ; Butter Tandoori Roti and Hot Gulab Jamun with Vanilla Ice-cream.
Paneer tikka was well marinated and tasted perfect!
Mix veg and roties were also delicious.
Gulab Jamun with ice-cream won our hearts! It was really delicious!
They also serve complimentary Papad on every table which order's Indian food!

We would although like to point out, that they have mention Rs.200 as cost for two on Zomato but a meal for two, here, would nearly cost Rs.700! This must be updated for better customer services!  

P.S.- We are giving rating 4 just because the food here was tasty !

a brand new restaurant in 5th floor,diamond plaza near nager bazaar(beside pvr ticket counter).cosy sofas and chairs with a wonderful atmosphere and music..
delicious dishes along with more or less affordable price.i tried chinese starters only..the dish called lei kai chicken and was one of the finest ever,spicy and tangy...8 boneless chicken piece with salads cost 260 rupees(without tax and vat)
i find out biriyani and indian dishes quite costly.
they have two seperate counters..one for food restaurant one for hukkah bar... hukkah bar is still in progess...
