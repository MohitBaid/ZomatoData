Undoubtedly the best Bengali Cuisine in Kolkata. Really enjoyed the 31st lunch at Aheli. It was really much more they I expected. Now let me tell you how it was like : 

1. A superb ambience with great lighting and decoration.

2. Live musicians and singer singing old bengali songs made the environment more lively.

3. Waiters n Waitress all dressed up in traditional bengali dress , also helping us in choosing the proper combination of dishes.

4. The food. It was just too delicious. We had Palao Rajnandini and G.purer ( sorry forgot the name ) mangso. They both were just the best combination. The mutton was really soft , tasty n juicy. The polao was really simple n tasty. We loved the mutton so much that we ordered it twice. These should be a must try for whose who r willing to come here. The food was served in traditional "Kashar thala with kashar glass". 

In one word... total "Bangaliana". But the prices varied from the menu card which is uploaded in Zomato.I would request Zomato to upload the latest menu card for all of us. Give it a try guys.. you will simply love Aheli.

Went to Aaheli to try their Poush Parbon Special Menu with a group of friends. There was a plethora of items to indulge in. We had Muchmuche Kumro Phoop er Bora, Bahari bok phool er bora, Palong shim bhaja, Shim Shorsher Bahar, Bete Shaak Posto, Chingri Pyajkolir milmish and Mangsher ghooni. Each of these dishes tasted superb.
Then we tried your tastebuds on the special menu.
I had Kheer er Malpua which was excellent. I also had Notun gurer Rabdi, Notun gurer Chhanar Payesh, Kheer er patisapta followed by doodhpuli and roshbora. Personally I liked the rabdi, the most! There were many other items like Bhapa pithe, Notun gurer chom chom, Notun gurer rajbhog, notun gurer doi kalash and notun gurer payesh but I was too full to try them. Do visit this place and try this new menu. You'll surely gonna love it.

So many cuisines these days that there are a few significant restaurants that server original Bengali cuisine in Kolkata.  One such restaurant that is famous for it’s genuine Bengali cuisine, is the Aaheli @Peerless.

As the year comes to an end everyone wants to end in a positive vibe, & this positivity comes when you can connect with something adept. Aaheli at The Peerless Inn hosted team Panchphoron for  their new 'Poush Parbon' menu which truly adroit at bringing that positive vibes.

But, first thing first there was a separate 'Ala Carte' menu served alongside some breads, pickles, & most important the Phuchka stall, some of its glimpses are- Veg Polao, Noodles, Schezwan Fish,  Paneer Butter Masala, Masaledar Arvi, Bhindi Do Piaza, Potato Douphinoise, Chicken Roast, Whole Fish Roast, Chicken Chaap, Raita & many more. For sweettooth it offered Ginger & Honey Cakes, Chocolate Gateaux, Kiwi Lemington, Lemon Tart, Dahi Vada & Sweet Curd.

But the mystery unfolded when we shifted our gears towards the special menu, so hold your breathe as the mains goes like this-
Kumro Phuler Bora, Bahari Bok Phuler Bora, Seem Sorser Bahar, Bete Saak Posto, Chingri Piyazkolir Milmish, Palong Murgir Bhino Swaad, Mangsher Ghoogni.
Now, for my favourite section of that place the dessert section, which surprised us with every scoop, we digged into-
Kheerer Malpua, Notun Gurer Rabri, Notun Gurer Chanar Payesh, Kheerer Patishapta, Dhoodhpuli, Rossbora, Bhapa Pithe, Gurer Bhapa Sandesh, Gurer Rajbhog, Chom Chom, Notun Gurer Payesh, Mulor Payesh, Poush er Puli Pither Bahar. And oh boy, these were some mouthwatering seeets which overdosed me like ecstasy.
Overall, had a great time along with a mouth full of flavours to brag about.
Visit this place before 14th of Jan in order to avail this special menu & to experience authentic bengali at its level best.
P.S.: They have separate sections for Rolls & Dosas too. Incase you miss it, dont lose hope as the Festival will continue till the end of the month.

Enjoy this Poush Parbon at Aaheli,Peerless Inn from 17th December to 14th January where you will get authentic bengali sweets especially for this season and also authentic bengali dishes which many people living in Bengal haven't tasted yet.
These dishes would definitely win your heart and make you relish every bit of it.
Some of the dishes like Pathishapta which is all bengali's favorite and also Rossobora ,Puli pithe,Payesh,Sandesh,Rossogolla,Doi,Puli r payesh and many more.
These all are made using the new Gur which is the Nolen Gur of the season making it a great combination.
There are not only sweets but spicy vegetarian and non vegetarian food too.
Which will make your mouth water for more of it.

Thanks

If you think Bengali then it has to be Aaheli, because this is one of the best places in the city to serve traditional Bengali cuisine. Bengali traditional food doesn't only include fish, our culture and food habits roots down deeper than that. Desserts have been always the forte of the Bengali home makers to treat the family with scrumptious sweet treats, also the new season of harvest brings in the joy of various seasonal crops cooked seamlessly into perfection.
Modern times and busy schedules should not take away the glory of traditional Bengali food, with this concept Aaheli by Peerless inn brings in the "Poush parbon Utsav" celebrating Bengali traditional food.
Poush parbon Utsav menu includes kumro Phuler bora, bok phul and hingche shaak er Bora (these are traditional Bengali fritters made from flowers and leaves), apart from starter pack they have sheem sorshe posto, bete shaak posto, maangsher ghoogni, chingri piyaz kolir milmish (these are different sides for main course having vegetable and nonveg combination) which are so similar to what our mother/grandmothers used to cook for us. 
The assorted dessert platter is having pooli peethe, bhapa patishapta, Roshbora, doodh pooli, natun gurer rajbhog and ofcurse the very famous mishti doi with natun gur. 
All of these and more, peerless inn was a total surprise when it made us bengalis taste the long lost traditional dishes, a big hatsoff to the chef. Thank you

Been with family to this place. Had a Zomato table booking - but were made to sit in the adjoining Oceanic restaurant. Not a big deal though...since it was great food that we were looking forward to. The service was quick, the staff were extrenely polite, and the ambience seemed excellent. But the pain point was...the Food!. Let's see:

*) Gondhoraj Ghol - Very well done. Just the right mix of sweet and sour.
*) A chingri starter (can't remember the name) - Mostly good. Large 'golda'-s, fried to the right amount of crispiness. Nothing remarkable though.
*) Chingrir polao (took Maangshor polao in parcel) - Too sweet. That said, there were an abundance of small prawns (kucho chingri). My mother liked it, I was more of 'meh'.
*) Daab Chingrir Pelobota - The chingri-s were 'pelob' (soft) all right, but the taste left MUCH to be desired. The gravy was bland, there was no salt, and the prwans, while very large, were rather tasteless.
*) Borishali Eelish - Not bad, not great stuff. Fish portions (2) were big. Went for this since 'Dhumrogondhi Eelish' was not available.
*) Goalondo Purer Mangsho - Strangely enough, we were served 'Kosha Mangsho', and NOT THIS DISH by the waiter (no information about whether it was available or not). There were 6 pieces of mutton, and the gravy was well-prepared. The pieces were not soft though.
*) Jhinge Begun Eelish - An absolute disaster. Fish had no taste, and who gives 'garam masala' to a Hilsa curry...any type? Took as parcel.
*) Dhakai Mangsho - Not that good either. Gravy was dull, and once again...tough mutton pieces.

We were served complimentary fritters (papad) and chutney - which were both good.

Also, it was strange to see that a restaurant this reputed packed food in paper foils and not plastic containers. 

The final bill, if anyone is interested, was around 17500/-. Not worth the money...at all!

I had been to Aaheli restaurant today along with family members and relatives. The table was booked over telephone few days in advance for lunch at 1 PM. We were told after reaching there that all seats were full and we have to wait.The order was of course taken by them while we were waiting in a separate place. After several attempts and persuasion, table was made available at 2.30 PM and lunch was served at 3 PM. The number of staff required was less and it was totally mismanaged. The wait for food for prolonged time was unbearable at that time with family members including children. Ultimately the food was served which was having no taste at all.The quality of fish was bad as it appeared the same was preserved for long time before cooking. Even the time taken for billing was also too long.We could come out from the restaurant after payment with great relief at 4 PM. The unprofessionalism and mismanagement has spoiled our weekend and our money was drained for no good cause. I can therefore without any hesitation suggest not to go to this restaurant for avoiding harassment, embarrassment, punishment and spoiling hard earned money which is not worth. We are totally disgusted and completely unsatisfied. Nobody should go here by mistake. Believe me otherwise get ready for repentance.

Had there been an option of 0 star, I would have given that. Inspite of making reservations, I had to wait for over 2 hours. The service is utterly bad. One cannot expect such kind of hospitality from a restaurant which is charging such whooping prices. I would not have been so disappointed if at least the food had been good. The service is worthless, the food taste is horrible. Let alone the food, to bring a finger bowl the staff took over 15 minutes. I have really no idea how this restaurant is getting business. Do you guys have any value for money or at least moral ethics?? Shame on you! Worthless staff and hospitality I have ever seen in my life! My actual rating is negative or zero star!!!!

I along with my three guests visited your Restaurant on 3rd Dec, 2017. Your hospitality was beyond doubt. Quality was also very good. But, at the time of making payment I was surprised to note that you are still charging 18% GST in your bill, in addition to Service Tax, which is not at par with the Govt. instruction. It should be 5% which other AC restaurant is charging now. It made our entire lunch BITTER. This is very bad.

I've been to various restaurants but this is by far the best place to have traditional Bengali food. Yesterday me with my family came here for lunch on the eve of Bhaiduj. By the way, this is the fourth time we have come to this place.

I'll skip the items we had orders and write about our overall experience.

First of all we had to wait for longer duration to get our food served than it had been in our previous visits. This time the delay was of around half an hour, but unfortunately the wasn't upto the mark. 

The previous experience, which we had about this place has changed as the service was slow, food wasn't as good as it used to be and even a bowl rice was being served after 10 minutes. 

I'd request the respective management to look into this matter and take necessary actions to maintain the popularity of Aaheli.

Thank you..

I have been to this place on a lunch date with family during Durga puja. My expectations with this place was way more than what I experienced.
Food: Food was not that much great. Simple Bengali food can be made in much better way and much better presentation.
Ambience: The only thing great about this place is how it looks. 
Staff: Service can be improved as we were not attended properly as I had expectations.

Overall not up to the mark.

I went to this place for nabami lunch with my family. Overwhelmed to have good bengali food. We were suggested the buffet section of aheli restaurant. A long list of items decorated the buffet menu.
When we actually started having them, it was a shock. The fish bhetki was just tasteless. The prawn curry was too bland and complementing its fellow bhetki.
Only edible item in the menu was mutton.
Disappointed i tried my luck in the desert section. � again some tasteless sweets were waiting in the tray. I mean the cook of peerless inn should be fired at immediate notice. Sweets in small sweet shops do justice to their value.
And all this for an exaggerating value of rs 2019/- per pax. 
I was more astonished to see the break up
Food value + 18%gst +10%service charge.
I fail to understand where was the service part in a buffet self service set up.

For Bengali Food lovers from outside the city this is the ultimate place. Why I say outside the city is because the locals dont really visit it too often. Price points could be the primary reason. Be that as it may the visitors would really enjoy the awesome fooding experience.

My family and I visited Aaheli for a grand luncheon on Ashtami afternoon during this Durga Pujo.
Well, to begin with, the place is certainly grand being a part of the well-known Peerless Inn, in terms of interiors, space, decoration, couple of live music performances to entertain the guests, and very courteous waiters.
The ambiance was definitely Bengali, but it is difficult to please a Bengali with 'Bangali khabar' outside home. We went for their Pujo special buffet that burnt holes in my pocket, Rs. 2000 per head...
There were many items to choose from (luchi, cholar dal, alur dom, chingri chop, posto chop, chana, polao, vetki paturi, boti chingri, murgi, morich mangsho), and they were average to taste. I specially liked the chicken dish, chana and the dessert (mishti doi, nikhutir payesh).
It was a nice experience but the food could have been tastier going by the pocket pinch.

I was there with family on Saptami. Firstly the welcome was warm. We ordered the Ahelir Bhuribhoj Thali (non veg) for everyone. I loved the Fulkopir Torkari to begin with. The daal and the fish chop was good. But I hated the Ilish Macher Paturi and Pona Maacher Jhaal. Both the dishes were tasteless. Coming to the desserts, the Mishti Doi was yum. The chutney was chatpata and the Mishti at the end was very good. But I was disappointed to see no item on Posto on the thali as it is a significant dish for Bengalis. Also, the live Baul music was superb.

So the puja feels has already set in, and it was time to taste some lipsmacking bengali delicacies!
Thanx to Ms. Soumi Sarkar, for Inviting us over at Aaheli, and giving us a chance to experience the breath takingly beautiful, bangali shaje mora, Aaheli at Peerless Inn. Also a big thanx to Chef Hafizur Rahman and team, for arranging such a lovely array of bengali dishes!
It is sometimes difficult to impress a benga8ki by feeding them bengali delicacies but aaheli beats that! You have to taste their food, to know how much attention to detail and taste can go into cooking the perfect bangali khabar dishes :)
So the Puja special Thali comprised of
Luchi Begun Bhaja, Plain Steamed Rice alongside Moonger Dal & Papad Bhaja, Mochar Tarkari, Potol er Dorma, Bhetki Paturi, Sorshe Ilish, Kosha Mangsho, Mishti doi, Payesh, Gandhoraj Rajbhog.
Each and every dish was perfectly made! And you cant help but lick your fingers after tasting them!
The bengali decor, with the pradeep on table, and madur as table mat, and the servers wearing dhoti punjabi and saree will make everything like a bengali palace experience!
Also there were some delicious food to try from the ala carte like

Pur Bhora Bhetki - Bhetki fish roll crumbed and deep fry - 1055
Rui Macher Patishapta - Pancake Stuffed with Mashed Rohu and Spices - 555

Had a lunch here today with office mates. Traditional Bengali cuisine with super courteous waiter ( they looked like borkorta) in very prompt service. We ordered non veg thali for everyone. Food was good specially the Bhetki Paturi. But I missed Shukto which I think is a must in Bengali thali. Also I felt like rather than giving sweet rice in a bowl you could give little polao or payes. Overall experience is good but the price is way too high, I had same kind of food in very less prices in somewhere else. Last but not the least, I should mention the lady who was singing Tagore songs was awesome. Thanks to her and her musicians for creating such a beautiful ambiance.

This is a very elegantly decorated restaurant which serves authentic Bengali food. The staff is polite and friendly and serves you in traditional Bengali clothes. It's rather touristy but an excellent way to the get the Bengali experience.

I ordered the vegetarian thali and it was absolutely sumptuous. The portions were medium but the variety is so great that it is difficult to ingest all that food. It is pretty heavy too.

The thali came with a paneer subzi, some traditional vegetable preparations, dal, rice, pakoda, puri and roti, traditional bengali fried eggplant, rasgulla and kheer. 

The flavours were amazing and very authentic, spicy and aromatic. It was a complete sensual experience, being served in a traditional brass thali that was beautifully decorated.

I couldn't ask for more. It was too filling.

The place is certainly expensive with the bill amounting to Rs 3000 per person but the quality is worth it.

This is a wonderful place to take tourists or if you want a traditional Bengali food experience in a lovely setting.

For a true blue Bengali, having fish in their daily diet is almost as important as breathing in the air into your lungs. whatever be the occasion, the diet of a Bengali isn’t complete without a dose of a beautiful fish. God has been kind enough to have blessed Bengal with sources to satisfy this never-ending-hunger for fish, in the form of its amazing fish produce. Varieties of fish are available all over Bengal. Some fishes even pertain to only some particular regions of Bengal, but thanks to such a well-connected network of fish delivery, that we Bengalis get to enjoy fish from all over India and the world almost every day.

Aheli..This is a name that has become a part of my professional life for last four years.
Apart from a foodie and food blogger, by profession I work in a Radio Station as Advertisement Copy Writer.
And if you ask me to name a client that I understand the best, I'll take the name of this place, Aheli. As we all know understanding client is the next impossible and toughest job of the world, but I'm at my best for Aheli.

And for Aheli also it pleased me at it's best.

Ambience is great. Food is freaking expensive. 
First thing I am not eating in5star hotel that I will pay INR 1995 for a fish main course and 2000 odd for a thali. Pricing has been done without any thinking. Foreigners and high spender non Bengalis who want to try Bengali food and not think about the price will give it a try. Looking at the price, portion size are small. Service is good and the waiting staff are very courteous.

The ambience is pure "Bangaliana" with staffs dressed in "dhoti and panjabi". The live music just adds to the ambience. The food is delicious with all authentic dishes on offering. One of the must try is Pora amer sorbat. Must try! I only didn't like the rice as they were soaked in ghee which made it very heavy but then bengali food is all about spices and ghee..

Took it for 1 years ago. You can expect a brilliant service from them. Specialised in Bengali cuisine serves. Food quality is very good and tasteful. You have to previously book your table before going. Their decoration and communication is impressive. Cost is at high range. :)

Although it's located at new market area you rarely get to see any signs of this restaurant being present in middle of market hustle bustle. 
The ambiance was good there was some live bengali music. The food I would say is just not worth the money you pay. Everything on the menu seems to be highly priced even a normal chingri  malai curry costs more than 1000 bucks which barely had 5 small size prawns. The curry portion was very less compared to the rice quantity. 
We only had curry,  rice and  two peices of fried illish  (hilsa fish) the bill went upto 5000 rs which I feel is too much for this restaurant to pay for. They don't even offer boneless illish options. Overall the restaurant is just hyped and I don't think it's worth so much money.

Had a much-awaited,but very disappointing meal at Aaheli today.Their Amish Thali,was disappointing to say the least.The rice served was stone cold and the same red gravy was used for the Alur Dum,Kosha Murgi and dad's Doi Potol(of all things!)Besides,the potatoes were undercooked!Only the Bhetki Paturi was reasonably good.The Luchi and Bhaja were floating in oil.Big let-down and steeply priced!

Paid a visit on the occasion of my parent's anniversary! Ambience was perfectly suited for that perfect evening! The array of songs played in the background added to it! 
Coming to the food, we ordered bhuri bhoj for 3 and an added daab chingri and aam porar sharbat. Clearly we couldn't gauge the quantity! 2 should have been enough! Quality/Taste wise it was really good indeed! Only reason I am giving it 3/5 is for the overpricing! Clearly you should get tastier food if you are paying that much!
Good experience all over though! Great staff!!

Aaheli is a Bengali restaurant located at the 1st floor of The Peerless Inn hotel, Esplanade( Kolkata ).

Ambience - Bangaliana cool ambience with cosy sitting arrangements , staffs here are embellished in traditional Bengali saree and Dhoti-panjabi along with traditional bronze utensils. The ambience is very pleasant.

We Panchphoron team went on the eve of Durga Puja 2k17 Menu Launch which would be available from Sashthi to Dashami . 

1) Daab Chingri - A traditional Bengali preparation of prawns cooked in mustard and filled inside a coconut to get a combined flavor of mustard and coconut cream. It was lip smacking. The prawns were soft and the gravy was flavourful and yummy.

2)Fulkopir Ghonto-  It was yummy too.

3)Palong Koraisutir Bora- Made of spinach and green peas , it was crispy and yummy.

4)Dhumrogondhi Ilish- . Made in mustard oil with mustard paste, the whole hilsa pieces are slightly smoky and boneless too! It was mind blowing. A must try...!!

5)Bhetki Posto-  It was soft and very flavourful.

6)Pujo special non veg Thali - A complete non vegetarian Bengali  meal.

7)pujo special veg Thali - A complete vegetarian Bengali  meal.

8) Mishti .


Come here with your friends & family to relish Bengali menu of multifarious types on any special occasion or on any normal day and cherish.

Thanks to the management for their warm reception & hospitality.

Good is great but be prepared to wait for everything from your food to the final cheque. Also, this place is pretty steep and it pinches more because the service is really not up to what they are charging for. The Non-veg Thali is really recommended if you have lot of time at hand. with Sanghamitra Mazumdar

Aaheli serves pure bengali cuisine.  We went their for celebrated our most junior family member's birthday. This place was well decorated , staffs were well behaved.  I really like their ambience. We ordered ''Ahelir mohabhoj ''  type of thali which contains plain rice , luchi , dal , brinjle fry , Potoler dorma , Echorer dalna , polao , bhetki paturi , chingri malai curry , sorse ilish , mutton , chutney , papad ,curd , gulab jamun etc. Mutton , Bhetki paturi , pulao , sorse ilish & curd was awesome.  But chingri malai curry was not up to the mark. It was less salty.   This place is very  expensive . Food items were unnecessarily overpriced.

“Experience not worth your expenditure” 

Stepped in Aaheli with pleasure infused by Web images of Aaheli and that it is housed in Peeless Inn at Kolkata. But to my utter dismay, the Rajbhog Thali is no where near to zamindari experience one may expect. Food served was cold and order and sequence of service was dis organized along with staff response being unplanned to handle crowd. Not sure if this was service at any erstwhile fabled zamindari house, god should bless the poor souls from the wrath....

In short, invite only your foes to Aaheli to treat you on a thali there - ahimsa and action

Such horrible food, i think the reviews are definitely paid for or written by their own staff. 
Food - Dal was undercooked, prawns were stale and smelling, Kosha mangsho was undercooked, Paturi had no salt. And we paid 10,000/- for 4 THALI's 
So disgustingly unsatisfactory. 
So sad to see such bad food getting such high reviews.

Update from 10th August 2017:-

Well, the hilsa festival is back again in Aheli, Peerless Inn. Primarily, the items are offered on a a la carte basis, but there is a nice thali on offer here at 2275+Tax here. Luckily, the fish pieces are pretty good and fresh. Overall, recommended. 

From early 2017:-

                        Frankly, I am not someone who goes ga-ga over bengali food in fine dining restaurants. No, it’s not the problem of those outlets, let me be very clear. It’s the problem of my typical middle class mentality. Whenever, I see a fish dish being priced at a bomb, my bong mind starts the calculation- this fish would’ve cost me such amount and my mom / my son’s mom would’ve cooked it in that fashion and blah blah blah ……. The bottomline is though I’ve been a regular to those dingy pice hotels in the city (you might like to read my experience here), hardly, I visit these Bengali fine-dining restaurants. So, even if Aaheli has been operating quite well since the last few decades and probably is the first Bengali fine-dining restaurant in the city, I’ve never been there (and yes, it’s nothing to boast about). So, this time, when I was invited for the tasting session there, this was one visit I was actually looking forward to…

Peerless Inn itself is a landmark property in the central Kolkata, located just next to the iconic Oberoi Grand and the maidan, this tall structure stands tall. The entrance is on the adjacent lane (though one-way but the hotel-bound vehicles can go). Aaheli is situated on the first floor.

Somehow, this restaurant is always full and that’s a sign of good business. We found our table at Oceanic and the management made sure that the chef’s special thali at aheli is served to us there. Now, this was a special food festival conceptualized by the management keeping in mind the diversity of food from different districts in Bengal. It included different signature dishes from districts and served in the a la carte manner. We were served the specially curated thali with the festive items (not available in the menu) though.

In Aaheli, the food is served in the traditional kansa utensils, which are still used in bengal households and it somehow gives the feel of a true-blue bong feel. As in any fine-dining joint, the food is damn good and the somewhat laid-back service was just what is needed to take a break from this hustle and bustle of our daily life. Regarding the food, the items was cooked keeping in mind the home-styled cooking and was less on the spice quotient. Out of all that was served, I especially liked the Doi Enchor and mangsher Jhol …..

 
The food was good and it felt great to visit this oldest fine dining bengali restaurant in city. This festival is going on till 30th March 2017 at Aheli, Peerless Inn Kolkata and Axis Mall, New Town. The timings are 12-330 (for lunch) and 7-11 (over dinner).

Bon apetit

Went to Aaheli, Peerless Inn with my wife, her parents and my parents. We asked if they had a "basanti Pulao" as that's one of the true bengali rice delicacies. They said they don't make it. We asked if they could make a similar pulao, they said yes we can make one.

When they got it, we noticed that the rice was stale and was very sticky, because they had put a lot of "Ghee" in it, completely not acceptable, not to mention they charged a whopping Rs. 800 for that pulao.

Golda Chingri malai curry was just bland and didn't have any taste. Finally I got a bill of Rs. 10, 600 which according to the poor standard of the food served was definitely overpriced - NOT VALUE FOR MONEY AT ALL!!!

My recommendation would definitely be to avoid going there and spend big bucks for a really poor quality meal.

What a shame !

If you are in search of traditional Bengali cuisine, nothing can be better than Aaheli - The Peerless Inn. The outstandingly decorated restaurant is already in the good book of the foodies and I am not an exception to that at all. Quite naturally, I have been there for a couple of times but last weekend it was a party thrown by one of my friends in that place. I was completely happy in the thought of stepping into the food joint once again with my close buddies. 

Well, our meal was started with a refreshing traditional drink, Sugandhi Lebur Sarbot, prepared with aromatic lemon. Its divine taste freshened our mind and thereafter, we decided to have Polao Rajnandini along with mouth-watering side dishes that include Dal Raibahadur and Bhalo Laga Bhetki Patoori. The aroma of the rice was heavenly and the delicacy of the fish item is still attached to the tip of my tongue. Besides, the polao was cooked in zamidari style with dry fruits, green peas and cauliflower and all these ingredients offer a great piquancy altogether. On the other hand, the dish of fish offered a nice smell as patoori is steamed in the wrap of banana leaf. The flavor of mustard with which the fish was marinated simply enchanted our palate. I must not forget to mention the succulence offered by the Dal Raibahadur. 

I would like to recommend this place to all the food lovers as you can grab a sumptuous and great meal cost-effectively.

Lovers of authentic Bengali cuisine should never miss the chance of visiting Aaheli, a delightful place for the foodies, located in the Esplanade. The cozy ambiance of the restaurant along with the amazing behavior of the staff members made us feel at home. Cladded with traditional ware all the staffs of the place were very generous to us. 

The unique atmosphere of the outlet made us stick to their famous dishes, which consisted of Sugandhi Lebur Sarbot, dal raibahadur, bhalo laga bhetki patoori & polao rajnandini. The aromatic flavor of the Sarbot was simply mind-blowing. Polao Rajnandini, cooked in a unique way with a lot of dry fruits and cauliflower was truly a delight to our taste buds. Another mention worthy dish we tried was the Bhalo Laga Bhetki Patoori. Wrapped in banana leaf and marinated well with mustard, this particular dish of the outlet is a must try for everyone. All of our gang also tried their Dal Raibahadur, it was also grand in flavor. 

All in all, I had a great time in the restaurant along with their lip smacking dishes. The reunion of our group actually became fruitful due to our visit to this awesome place, where you can have the authentic flavors of some Bengali Cuisine in a unique way.

I was there during Oct'16. We opted for 1 Thali for myself and rest Ala-carte since we wanted to try some specific dishes during Durga Pujas. The service was good however, the food was not at all acceptable for the price they charge. Couldn't eat the mutton because it was not smelling fresh and had a awful odour, Hilda fish we ordered was not up to the mark (taste-wise); overall based on the food experience I will avoid "Aheli" and would recommend the same to others.

Durga Puja 2017 special Menu Launch -

​Aaheli is a pure Bengali restaurant situated inside the Peerless hotel at Dharmatala. It's motto is ' Bangaliana at its best ' .

Ambience has a corporate touch with a lavish decor and cosy sitting arrangements. Staffs here are cladded with traditional dress, be it red bordered saree or dhoti-panjabi. Plates are of kasha/bronze with a banana leaf inside with top class food.

Recently our PanchPhoron team visited Aaheli on the eve of Durga Puja 2k17 menu launch. The menu would be available from Sashthi to Dashami.

1) Daab Chingri- Daab chingri is a very traditional recipe. It is a preparation of prawn within a tender green coconut shell. It was very flavourful , creamy and delicious.

3)Palong Koraisutir Bora

4)Dhumrogondhi Ilish- Smokey and boneless Hilsa fish ,cooked with mustard paste  tasted mindblowibg. A thing cannot be miss...!!

5)Bhetki Posto- It was soft, flavourful and yummy. A must for fish lovers.

6)Pujo special veg and non veg Thali at reasonable rates with sufficient quantity.

7)Bengali Sweets.

Thanks to the management for their warm welcome and hospitality.

Went on the 27th of December 2016 and was dejected with the kind of service, attitude and food. I had heard so very much but all went down the drain. Fruit flies over the lime, asked for fresh lime and was served lime in a bowl which already had lime used by prior guest, I had to ask for fresh and got fresh lime without any apologies, very casual attitude..... I had order for a non veg Thali which came after 25 minutes, all food was cold and tasteless, prawn was dead cold and had no salt at all. Only puri was hot.

I told the server about the same and he was too casual as if it's normal and I was a fool to address the same. 

I asked for check and was given the same without any apologies and had to pay 2000 rupees for the above experience. I would not like to mention the staff name though but was very disheartening.

Thanks guys....

Aaheli - The Peerless Inn is a famous place in kolkata. This place servers one of the best quality authentic Bengali food. From sukto to Daab chingri, from fish fry to aalu bhaja, from chanar danla to kosha mangsho, from luchi to pulao, misti here is also good... But a little expensive... If you really want to celebrate some special occasion you must visit this place once..

Situated inside the Peerless Inn, this is a place for great authentic bengali food. 
Plate of fish fry is tasteful, typical Bengali vegetable preparations reminded me of home cooking. Enjoyed the food. Rabindra Sangeet being sung live and played during the meal was soothing. Tasted one sweet, Malpua, could have been better.
 Nonetheless, the ambience could be improved a little. Staffs are voluptuously courteous.

Very nice place to be for food that is close to heart. Many wud disagree though. The taste of a person varies from on to another so this place might please your pallet. But worth a visit. This is place is expensive but some what worth all the expense.

One of the best restaurant  in the city that serves authentic bengali cuisine and has been maintaining its brand name since years.  Visited this outlet  with a friend for lunch . The ambience portrays the traditional bengali theme as well as the same is reflected in the attire of the female staffs decked in white red border saree and males in dhoti and punjabi. To balance the theme food is served in the sparkling Kashar utensils  - a real nostalgic feeling. We ordered basamati rice, bhapa illish, chital muitha - the taste was just outstanding. Last but not the least great experience in terms of  hospitality too. Pocket pinch is a bit high.

I was quite impressed by the preservation of their retro Bengali culture through food,music,and the attire of the waiters. Nonetheless, the ambience could be improved a little.Staffs are voluptuously courteous.Regarding food, you can order the buffet and they have plenty of things. They aim for serving fresh and good food,which has a homemade feeling, people those who are missing their grandma's ancient recipes will definitely have fun here.Smartly recommending this place!

Went there for lunch on my birthday with my parents. The ambience was wonderful with live music going on. And on a sunday afternoon the place was not even crowded much. We had ordered two non veg and a veg thali because we wanted to taste all types of dishes served by them. Coming to food, quality was good, less spicy, the mutton kasha was like my mum makes at home, the bhetki maacher paturi was delicious but the polao was a bit under cooked. The staffs were very cortious and prompt. They even got me a cake to cut cause it was my birthday. Overall it was a good experience.

Went just few hours ago... Ambience is really nice.. Ordered aam porar shorbot, niramish thali as it is named Aahelir mahotsab, n daab chingri.. Come to the shorbot it was good. In the thali the veg items should be little more spicy.. There was a sweetish taste in all the items as my husband dnt like sweet in curry.. Last bt nt the least come to daab chingri. It was overpriced bt the taste was toooooooo good. I really loved it. I also liked the chutney n misti pulao.. Bt one thing to say all the dishes were too costly..

Well, I am not a fan of having Bengali dishes at a restaurant because I feel that they use too much oil and chilies which overpower the item. Aaheli however was different. The Channar Dalna (curried cottage cheese balls) was the best I've had till date. Spongy and smooth in texture, soaked perfectly in the gravy. The Gandharaj Bhekti was beautifully cooked fillets of Bhekti in a light cumin based gravy, infused in the flavor of Gandharaj (Citron). Best accompaniment for fine rice. The Surabhi Pulav was very aromatic, yet light on the palette. The Mutton Kassa was the hero of all the dishes. Not an ounce of excess oil, perfectly cooked meat in mild spices. It was par excellence. The only let down was the Seafood Patishapta. The filling tasted nice, however the covering had a disturbing taste, which subdued the taste of the filling. On unwrapping I found there there were dust if raw flour in the folds of the wrap. Please make sure this is not repeated.

I'd have given a sure 3 rating for the Seafood Patishapta incident, however the rest of the dishes did stand out. Hence a 4.

For years this has been one of my favorite Bengali Cuisine eateries! The ambiance is wonderfully quiet and soothing! The food is great! But Aaheli has dropped to my number two ranked Bengali Cuisine eateries simply due to its high tariffs ! It's just too costly-

Aaheli is the perfect definition of "বাঙালিয়ানা". Once u enter there, u can get the exact fragrance of traditional bengali culture and authentic Bengali food.

Location: It is located at the first floor of the Peerless Inn,esplanade.

About aaheli: when we entered there they treated us like VIP persn. There was a stage where 1lady was singing rabindra sangeet . It was a live music performance. And deco was exclusive. Lovely ambiance.All the female stuffs are dressed with saree and all the male stuffs with dhoti and punjabi. Service was good. Everything is decorated in the authentic way.

Food:They have all type of bengali dishes in der menucard.
We ordered aampora sherbet,Non-vegetarian thali which consist rice,polao,daal,sabji,luchi,begun vaja,posto bora,chutney,papad,rasgulla,dahi, and four nonveg item(u can choose it as per ur choice) mutton curry, sorshe ilish,chingri malai curry,bhetki paturi.
Now cm to the main point taste of food. As am belonging frm a Bengali family and my mom is a grt cook. So i hve been tasted mny types of bengali food frm my childhood. So i cant give more than 3 out of 5. Food quality was undoubtedly good enough bt none of those was dat much tasty. I thnk any bengali woman can cook bttr than them. here We had experienced luxurious food.

It was a grt experience of the dining with aaheli. Pocket pinch is a bit high evn i can say its expensive. But i'd recommend this is an one of the best Bengali restro. Not bad for one time experience.

Okay so "Aaheli", hospitality was perfect when we arrived. Although we had to wait for 30 mins for food, but it was worth coz when the food was offered the authentic typical Bengali thali, we were like "how could we eat all these", I specifically liked luchi begun bhaja, malai chingri, Hilsa bhapa and that yummy josha mangsho. Last but not the least we were offered two most cutest small pots containing mouries 😂

"Arrogant Aheli" will be the name I'll address this place after my visit to this place... If you are a student and want to taste their so - called authentic bangalee dishes with your pocket money then I suggest go for bhojohori manna or kasturi, they are way better than these arrogant pieces of shit... Here I tell you why I have such a bitter impression about this place...

Durga puja is the biggest festival of bangalees.. And being a bong you surely want to taste authentic dishes of bangalee food and you can hear the name of this place from your parents and even grandparents... I had a huge expectation about this place when I went there on nabami. When we arrived there we had a warm welcome from all the staffs, but the dark side was yet to reveal... One of their managers took us to the extension of aheli they have opened during this puja for their new puja special buffet menu. They didn't even ask for our choice and almost forced us to go for their puja special buffet. Even before we decide whether we have it or not they started serving food and welcome drink... As it was out of budget for us we had denied to avail that buffet... We went for the main section of Aaheli and after having the menucard we had noticed that one of their thalis (of around 680/-) was not in their menu, as we've seen it on their menucard in zomato we asked for it, and they said there is no such thalis available in Aaheli... (then it might be PC Sorcar who added it in their menucard on zomato)... As like everyone we had pre decided what thalis we're gonna take...
You'll be surprised to know that there were only two thalis were available, one was veg and another one was Aahelir Bhuribhoj (most probably, don't remember the name properly) worth rs around 1985... As none of us were vegetarian and since among the non veg thalis only aahelir bhuribhoj was available, it would hv been out of budget for us if we took two thalis... So, being helpless, we ordered one aahelir bhuribhoj, extra rice and one lebur sarbat...
As we've decided to share one thali since we didn't have any choice, almost all the staffs and the managers started whispering to one another and they were giving looks like we were beggers and having food without paying for it... One so-called manager came and ask one of the staffs why we are sharing one thali between us and the lady staff told it in a mocking way that two thalis were out of budget for us... We had to ask several times for a extra bowl and even for water...They ignored our calls, and affront us in every passive way.
Now coming to the food, yes, the food was good though but not something extraordinary.... you can get the same taste in bhojohori manna and kasturi and many other bangalee outlets... and yes, one of their "classy" characteristics is that they don't serve all the foods that is included in the thali, you have to ask for it like "thali te chatni chhilo na? Mishti chhilo na?", only then they will serve you, unless not..
Lastly, Though I dont have the bill with me to take a picture and upload it as a proof, you have to believe what I say... We had ordered "Lebur sorbot" but in the bill, they enlist it as "aam pora sorbot" which is costlier than lebur sorbot, we noticed it after leaving the restaurant... Yes, to those arrogant fellows, a matter of 100 rupees don't matter much, but to the students like us, it does matter...
I SHALL NEVER EVER VISIT THIS PLACE AND SHALL NEVER SUGGEST ANYONE TO VISIT HERE...
Finally, I have a little question to those arrogant men in "manager" uniform and to the staffs : What, being a part of Aaheli, you guyz start thinking of yourselves??? Owner of the restaurant??? An emperor of a large kingdom??? Any kind of Ministry personnel??? If none of this, then WHAT!???? My curiosity about your cause of SUCH arrogance is the reason of this question... We know what you are, but we want to know what do you think about yourself after wearing those black suits!

Lets start with the good, beautiful ambience, courteous staff, prompt service, sumptuous quantities and a general authentic bengali feel, Aaheli has all of this going for it! However,  sadly the food does not live up to the standard of exorbitant prices. Being an enormous foodie, spending high amounts on food is the last thing that bothers me, if the food is worth it. That is not something i can say about Aaheli. The mutton dish priced at 1 grand was undercooked and hard, and hardly satisfying. Lebur shorbot was but average, as was the daal. Bhetki paturi and rabri were the only items that somewhat lived upto our expectations. Given the hype about this place, had expected a much higher quality of food and was completely disappointed.

Today went to this place for having saptami lunch and to celebrate my bday too...Ordered two plates of Aahelir Bhuribhoj (Non-Veg). Honestly it was too much for 3 persons but overall it was very tasty. The thali comprises of four non-veg item (Mutton-3 medium size,Hilsha- 1 very large piece,1 Bhetki and 1 Big size Prawn) and three veg item (of which cauliflower was best) and Loochi, rice and fried rice was just ok and one Aam doi and 1 big size gulab jamun. The ambience is very good. The staff behaviour was very nice and the music was too good. Felt very nostalgic to see the sparkling@ Khashar utensils in the dining area. I would recommend this as one of the best bengali resturants in the city. Pocket pinch is bit high.
Aahelir Bhuribhoj- Rs. 1975 + Tax extra(30%)

​Aaheli’s name is synonymous with authentic Bengali food. Cooking food in the traditional way had always been their forte. With the commencement of Durga Puja, like all other restaurants, Aaheli, the Peerless Inn, has launched a special menu for all its customers. Going beyond authentic recipes, this year Aaheli had made an attempt to bring a twist in the traditional dishes. Let’s have a look on the entire menu.

I was in Kolkata and was staying in Peerless Inn. I visited this restaurant on 25/9/16 along with my friend. The brightness of lights, ambience and seating were very comfortable and it gave a relaxed feeling. 
The staff were courteous and friendly. Copper glasses (I think) were heavy than the water poured in them.
We ordered Bengali Veg thali as I was looking to taste Bengali food.
There were many items served, and all of them tasted good. Most of them were not spicy at all to my standards.
Overall it was a different taste and we enjoyed food along with the paan served. There was also live music but they were singing only Bengali songs, which I could not understand at all. I suggest, it will be good if they sing even Hindi songs for guests who cannot understand Bengali. 
 On the price front I felt the price is more on a higher side.

wow feeling guranteed ! A nice heavy lunch meal with some live music and well decked staff who usher you inside with a broad grin - thats aheli for you. The thali is gigantic , end to end gala. You dont feel heavy tucking in the best of delights - and people who stay out of bengal can just sit relax and savour the goodies.
Of all - one nice gondhoraj lebu took my heart away and stuck itself to Aheli s kitchen.

We visited the place on 14th April, 2016 to celebrate my hubby's birthday alone with bengali new year.. We tried the Raajbhoj and Bhuribhoj thali.. Food was good but most of the items were cold and didn't have that taste which we expected, even we complained about this also.. The waiter replied that it happened because of the rush.. But isn't it obvious that it would be crowded on such day.. Ambience was luxurious and the waiters were also well behaved.. I really hope that they do look after this as it's quite a famous restaurant in Kolkata..

I have been an ardent fan of Aaheli since childhood. Now a days,  many good bengali restaurants has come up in the city which offers good food.
During 90s,  when there were no such restaurant dedicated only to bengali dishes,  Aaheli was a cult and a must visit place for my family during durga puja and poila boisakh. My last visit was around 4 years backs and we had an option to choose from the vast range of Illish Maach that they were offering during that time. To me,  it was like 'barir moto khawar, kintu barir theke bhalo!'. I like the service that we get here with all waiters dressing up in the authrntic way.

One of the posh restaurant in Calcutta with a luxury decor. Every Durga puja I go there with my family for lunch, as my mom is a die hard fan of bengali cuisine. The stewards are dressed in traditional bengali attire and every time I find there is live rabindra sangeet going on. Go for thali, because you will get a wide range of dishes and I must say the food will always satisfy your taste bud. But a expensive one. Staffs are extremely cordial and the lovely ambiance will pull you up to come here again.

one of the most overpriced restaurant in kolkata i must say. seems they are using most of their funds and thought to decorate the interiors and staffs only, and have completely forgotten about the the food quality. we have ordered a mocha preparation which seemed to be stale and had a faint sour taste. other preparations were kinda okay type and nothing special. really disappointed.

Nothing to say about this 5star hotel which is located in esplanade just beside the grand hotel. Food preparation was good with the ambience perfect. They even had musicians playing rabindra sangeet ( as it was poila baishakh) .

Mahanayak’er Priyopod – A tribute to the Legend Uttam Kumar..!

The movie fraternity since long, here at Kolkata, has been dominated by one person and one person only. The Legendary Uttam Kumar. His iconic movies, his exemplary acting skills and his charming personality, has been few of those things, which has still kept his image alive in the heart and mind of every Bengali. Even in the days of modern cinema, probably every kid in all the households, sing his songs or maybe google his movies over YouTube. If Romanticsm had a name, it would be ‘Uttam Kumar’. Aaheli, the flagship restaurant of the very popular Peerless Inn, is proudly celebrating a food festival in memory of this great actor, where the dishes served, were personally liked by this late actor. Every single dish put up in the menu, happened to be very close to this actor, and this is why, the first day launch of this food festival saw the arrival of the family members of Late Shri Uttam Kumar, to kickstart this event.

The items range from very simple Mangher parota to the exotic Kanchkolar Kofta. Being a Bong, it is highly doubtful that one wouldn’t display his love for fish or meat. Likewise, relevant preparations, again very close to the heart of Uttam Kumar, which includes the likes of dishes made out of Prawn, Katla Maach and Chicken have been carefully prepared and included in the menu, to serve to the patrons. The items are very simple to taste, yet has a fine blend of flavor, aroma and ‘Bangaliana’, if I may say so. Not to mention, the pricing for most of them is quite low, as per the standards of this lavish restaurant. Since, this is a limited-period festival, make the most out of it, and reserve your tables today to have a taste of what the favorite actor of Bengali people used to like the most.

Following would be the list of the dishes up for grab:

Bagdar Malaicurry (A Prawn dish prepared with thick curry)

Chingri Paturi (Prawn marinated with mustard paste, wrapped in a Banana leaf & steamed)

Bhetkir Kantar Charchari (Chunk of Bhekti cooked in potato and eggplant)

Katla Mach-r Riyaz Jhal (Chunk of Katla cooked in thick cut onion and mustard gravy)

Kaju Murgi (chicken cooked in cashew gravy)

Riyaz Mangsho (chunk of mutton cooked in thick onion gravy)

Kancha Kolar Kofta (Green Banana dumpling stuffed with homemade cottage cheese and cooked in tomato onion gravy)

Mangsh-er Paratha (Stuffed paratha in minced mutton)

Kumkum ( small cottage cheese dumpling in rice pudding)

Bengali Cinema is an integral part of the Bengali Culture, & undoubtedly Uttam Kumar has been & still is, an integral part of the same. We’ve been always fascinated by the way he walked, the way he talked, the way he did everything. Similarly at some point of time the foodie in us might want to know what food items did he love most.
Well, the question has been answered! Aaheli, Peerless Inn is organizing a food festival celebrating the dishes the Mahanayak loved most. Cooked by the master chefs with the choicest ingredients, Aaheli proudly invites the movie lovers & foodies alike to celebrate the favorites of Uttam Kumar.
                                                                ...

This is one of the places where you end up spending way more money for the food you get. The main usp of the place is its location (inside the peerless inn), glamorous interior and great service. The servers wear traditional Bengali dresses (sari and dhoti Punjabi). We ordered mixed veg platter, plain rice, smoked hilsa and lassi. Food was just above average. Any Bengali mom can cook better Bengali dishes than them.

This is an amazing Bengali restaurant....they make the best out of even the most simple Bengali dishes. The service is outstanding and ambience is worth the price. The ala carte options are a little on the costlier side. The thali that they offer is very filling and you get a lot of options. 4.5 out of 5 overall ....very nice experience every time I walk in...!!!

When we were very young, Aaheli was the only place which served authentic Bengali cuisine and there were hardly other competitors. 
It was that time, when Zomato was hardly known by the people when I came here often with my parents. They generally had different platters of food which have different items in the list like Chingrir Malaikari, Kosha Mangsho, Eilish Bhapa, Bhetki Paturi etc. I also loved the Aam Pora Sherbet over there. Love this people. A legendary place to try Bengali food. Definitely recommended. Happy Dining! :)

One of places to have authentic bengali preparation in kolkata. It is part of luxury hotel chain so the interior, ambience and services are top notch. Foods are very good too. The chingri malaikari and rui macher patisapta are mouth watering. They do not serve alcohol though I have no idea why. The mocktails are average, nothing special to mention about. Rest of the food items which we tried, were very tasty and almost made to perfection. However, the down side is the price. It is freakingly costly. I went out with two of my clients who are british and the bill was above 7500. If I go on my own i will probably prefer oh calcutta.

Had dinner at Aaheli yesterday. The menu is extensive and if you don't know your Bengali food difficult best to choose one of the thaali's. We ordered two thaali's the aahelir Bhoj and the aahelir raj Bhoj. They were both delicious, there was a kind of Puri with fried brinjal, rice with dhall and 2 vegetables, mutton, chicken, prawn, steamed fish in banana leaf, ghee rice, sweet curd, another sweet. We were stuffed, the portion size it very large. The staff were helpful and efficient. The bill was a bit steep but if one takes in account the quality and quantity of the food  it was money well spent. They should definitely tone down the live music, too loud and disturbing.

After an insanely long time getting burnt in Kolkota's heat, we decided to get into the closest restaurant possible and ended up at Aaheli. This was a fine dining restaurant, and we were amazed at how beautiful the place looked. The ambience was top notch, and the staff were dressed in traditional wear. We weren't too hungry, so we just had some chawal and shuktoi, classic traditional food of Bengal. The flavours were amazing, and the food tasted really good. They also had a lot of buffet and platter options, that looked ravishing. If you're a tourist at Kolkata and want some authentic Bengali food, Aaheli at Pearless inn is the place to be.

The Peerless Inn is one of the good hotels to stay in when in Kolkata. Aaheli is one of the expensive Bengali cuisine restaurants which serve you good quality Bengali food, coupled with decent service and of course, wonderful ambiance. My only complaint is the lack of variety in the menu options. But worth a visit, if you are willing to pay.

The fragrant essence of this Bengali fine dining restaurant had caught me off guard the moment I'd entered it last Polia Boishakh to enjoy a srumptious, homey, Bengali meal for lunch, which I did. The interiors are done up beautifully in light classy shades exuding elegance, tastefully decked with picturesque wall paintings and a hug attractive vase with flowers in the middle of the spacious eatery. The staff were dressed in traditional Bengali attire for the occasion, and you can actually take photographs with them which they are gracious enough to click for you.
The food reminded me of grandma's homemade "ponchobyanjon" - the restaurant in fact applies a similar phrase to their style of cooking and cuisines - and the food does emanate a homely, Bengali feel. The place is away from home, yet not quite away. One feels one is having a family lunch in the comfort and luxury of home itself.
I'd gone their with family, and we'd begun our sumptuous lunch by sipping 'kochi daab er jal' (fresh tender coconut water) for starter, decorated with a lemon and cherry on top, followed by the main course of 'sugondhi gobindobhog' (steamed fragrant gobindobhog rice), 'bhalo laga bhetki paturi' (a type of Bengali-style bekti fish preparation of bekti marinated in mustard, wrapped in banana leaf and then steamed), 'piyaz postor bora' (deep fried poppy seeds and grated onion dumplings), 'jhuri aloo bhaja' (juliennes of potato deep-fried), 'sonali moong daal' (yellow lentil tempered with clarified butter), and 'swadey khasha murgi khasha' (chicken cooked in authentic Bengali traditional recipe) accompanied with "gorom" (hot) phulko loochi (deep-fried puffy bread).
The food served is not the money's worth in terms of amount, as the restaurant is quite expesnsive and helpings are limited. But if one is inclined to spend lavishly on traditional and authentic Bengali cuisine made in the style of home-cooked "Bangali ranna" amidst a plush setting and soothing aromatic ambiance, and also for the home-like feel of mother's delicious cooking in the kitchen, then one can pay a visit to Aaheli to relish "Bangaliana at its best."

Something was missing. Thats the feeling after the dinner at Aheli. The place is nice with thd amazing bengali ambiance. From the servers dressed in dhuti-punjabi to the live music where artists were singing retro Bengali songs like "Ekta gaan likho amar Jonno" and the authentic brass cutlery in the table and the pradeep on the table instead of the candle created a very high anticipation. But the variety in the menu was the first set back. The other famed bengali food hubs serves a bit more on variety. Price is exorbitent to be honest. Most of the non veg maincourse starts from 1000 and goes up till 2000 rupees. Their quantity is pretty large. Each disg is goid enough for 2-3 people. Going in a larger group may be beneficiary here. We ordered Radhaballavi and bhaja mashlar alurdom as starter. Both failed to impress me. In maincourse Chitol Muithya and Bhetki Paturi was just out of the world. Quantity was so huge... no place for desert. Aamporar sarbat was again a bit of failure as per tge expectation.

Overall a good experience. But considering the fine dining cost. Could have been better.

Too cute! The staff in traditional attire, the presentation of the food, the decor, the banana leaves and the bronze thalis. Talk about keeping it simple and earthy to the core. And the food is finger licking good. The garam bhaat with ghee and kasundi is the perfect wrap up to the thali. Lovely kasundi. Very very delicate flavours and not the punch that knocks you out.

Tried the Non-veg Bengali thaali. 4 non-veg dishes to go with lot of vegetarian food and mishthi.

The fish and mutton were amazing. Cannot say the same for the prawns.

The quantity of food could possibly feed 2 people.
It was sad that i could not finish the platter.

This is my favourite Bengali restaurant in Kolkata. Food is carefully prepared to ensure that there is very little or no scope of complains. There is a royal ambience with food being served in big bronze thaalis and banana leaves. Melodious rabindra sangeet and the smell of gondho lebu uplifts the mood even more. Food takes time to arrive but is surely worth the wait. Chingri maacher malai curry, alu jhinge posto, mochar ghonto, maacher paathuri are some of my favourite dishes. The abak jalpan is a must drink if you are not too fond of aam porar shondesh. This place is truly magnificent. Only downside is that it is crazily expensive and hence can be visited only once in a while.

This restaurant was in my wishlist for years, finally managed to visit it but had a mixed feeling. Ambiance was great, live bengali music playing, spacious  dining area but the service was lacking very much. only 3 waiters were there, though they were courteous but they were inattentive. Serving time was too slow, ordered the Rajbhoj thali but it came exactly after 40 mins, though the number of items were huge but all the items were cold except the paturi which was piping hot, if they were not freshly prepared then what was the reason for the delay who knows! Frankly speaking the food items were very ordinary, right from bati chocchori to alur dum to dal to mutton kosha and chingrir malai curry all the items were just average & very bland, only saving grace was the paturi. Took gondhoraj lebu sarbat extra but it was extremely poor. Overall i have to say that i have tasted far better bengali food in other restaurants like 6 BP, Oh calcutta, sare chuattor etc. Bill for 2 persons came a whooping rs-4640/- which is exorbitant for the quality of food they served and one has to go all the way to the adjacent restaurant oceanic where the card swiping machine is there to give pin number, such a three star restaurant which is charging skyhigh amount dont have a portable card swiping machine,which is ridiculous. From my experience here i realized one thing that this restaurant is exclusively patronized by mainly non-bengali and foreigners who dont have the slightest idea of how bengali food is like, otherwise proper bengali food lovers who eat good quality of bengali food in home and other good bengali restaurants wont love it that much. I came here just to experience this old 3 star restaurant but not coming back again, one advice to all the food lovers here that if you have loads of money to spend then you can come here and waste it on ordinary food(btw the exorbitantly priced thalis are the cheapest option here but if someone tries to order ala carte then the cost will be more) otherwise its not worth it, only the ambiance and age-old reputation is carrying this restaurant now.

After visiting Dakshineshwar Kali Temple had come here.
From the moment we entered, the aura made its presence felt. From the servers who were dressed in traditional Bangla attire(sarees n dhotis) to the copper plates n glasses n the paintings on the walls.
We ordered the Maha rajbhoj which had luchi, phulgobi, paturi Mach n the best mangsho(mutton) i have ever tasted in my life.. In sweet had awesome rajbhog n Misti doi... Servers were also v attentive. Was all exquisite n divine! Washrooms were also v clean n well maintained.
Bill came to around Rs 3600 for 2 which is on higher side but considering its fine dining, seemed worth n better other 5 star hotels.
Will definitely come here again on my next Kolkata visit to re-experience this divine food n service.

Visited this infamous place on 1st Jan which was one more reason to add to the overall experience part which compelled me to give 4.5 rating. Probably would have given 4 otherwise. The ambience was authentic, good old Bengali music in the background, Punjabi clad waiters and luchi to start with the "raj-bhoj" thali. Almost all items (veggies, the bhetki paturi, the gravy of chingri malaikari) were delicious. Curd was a lil smelly. But overall its certainly better than other Bengali restaurants in terms of quality. But I must say that pricing is not comparative with the experience. Lil costly. But good experience.

Amazing Bengali food. Till now I only had a taste of bengali cuisine from places like o'Calcutta, & found it overpowering & oily, but aaheli made me a fan of its food. 

Perfectly spiced, less oil.. heavenly food. Food so good that i happily ate the veg preparations. List of items to have : 

1. Sukto - veg - i could eat a killo of it 

2. Poshto - u dont miss this when u are having bengali food. ever. 

3. patudi - steamed fish in a leaf . simply made in mustard . heavenly!

4. Some k-mutton - i really dont remember the name, but my mouth is watering just thinking & writing about it. 

6. OFcourse all of this with the light , lovely luchi's..

7. End the meal with the beautiful Mishti doi , Rasmalai & Gud Rasagulla. 
Go with a big appetite.

Excellent food, fantastic service, superb taste, beautiful ambience... Truly authentic Bengali cuisine... Strongly recommend particularly if you want to explore experience or taste Bengali cuisine for first time.. We had a lemon sarbat, Aam panna & 3 different types of non veg thalis or set meals... It was overall great experience but total bill was 6300 which was quite high. For a Bengali family who understands the cuisine & taste well...paying this amount for 3 people's lunch ...for humble Bengali food specially in Kolkata was slightly impractical...

Had the Rajbhoj thali. The food was definitely not worth the price. The Paturi was insipid at best. The Luchis were cold and greasy. The mutton was oily. 
When I asked for a spoon for the mishti doi- I was given a spoon which was too large for the bowl. There was no dessert spoons in the restaurant and they had to rush to an adjacent restaurant to get it. It is apalling to think that a restaurant in a star facility does not have spoons.

I doubt if I will ever return.

This was my second visit to Aaheli. First time when I had visited the bill came up to around 5k for 2 people. After that visit, I sweared that I was not going to visit this restaurant ever again. 
So this time around I was kinda scared to pay a second visit. After a lot of coaxing from my friend, I decided to take the plunge. I ordered for a non veg thali. 
First of all, it is way too expensive when compared to the taste of the food. I feel there is nothing extraordinary in the food. I wont say its bad but not very good either. The gulab jamun which they served with the thali was hard and rubbery. Food was ok-ok in taste. 
Thankfully, this time the bill was 1750 in total. I suggest before visiting this restaurant ensure your wallet is full. 😜

We visited this restaurant to try out the Illish festival on a saturday evening. Had some crowd, ambience 5/5 as there was live bengali music sang by persons dressed in dhoti punjabi. Waiters too dressed in traditional, utensils of kansha(bell metal), nimbu salt and mango chutney was on table with a traditional lamp of kansha. Coming to food, disappointed with menu on chicken as there was only 1 dish priced at Rs 865. We ordered an illish thalli having 5items of illish, illish macher bora, illish paturi, daab chingri and aam pora sharbat. Well the main item of the festival had eggs in it, hence taste was really not upto mark. The taste was not outstanding even in chicken dish(small 6 pieces of chicken for that price was ostentatious in a 3 star restaurant). Daab chingri was a lil towards sweet.Rice was not charged separately and was included. Overall experience was dining was fine and great but food quality and quantity was disappointing. Its great to give a non-bengali a flavour of our culture but disappointing for a bengali as it is an extravagant affair for dining home special cuisine. Pocket hole - Rs 8000 for 5persons

I went there for dinner. Ordered "aahelir bhoj" ,a non-veg thali. Food was awesome. Every single item on the platter was too good, starting from the daal,the sabjia, chicken and specially the bhetki paturi was tremendously good. I like the Misti doi so much. It was so creamy and soft.
Now come to the ambience, that is too good. The decoration is so well planned,starting from the prodip,kancha lonka,noon, lebu at the centre of the table to the interior. Service is nice. No doubt, a costly place. For some dishes they charges extraordinarily, like for aloo posto or mochar ghonto they charge so much. Thalis are costly and amount is very less. For Bengalis who eat these items almost regularly at home,spending the money on eating those same in aaheli is not worthy. Price chart is really the worst part. My ratings are just on ambience, taste n decor.

During a one day stop over to Peerless Inn Kolkata, apart from staying in the comfort of Hotel.  Aaheli served our taste buds too. Being there with my wife n kid we enjoyed the lavish spread of buffet ranging from North Indian to South Indian to Continental Food. Loved the Dosa n Loochi along with bhaji n other authentic food. Lunch we had typical bengali fish with dal n Naan. Taste was so authentic.  Loved it. Cost on higher side. But being in heart of the City is pro.

There is nothing better than Bengali food for a pure BANGALI family in any part of the world. Our Food is an integral part of our Bengali life style. If you love Bengali cuisines you can try out Aaheli any day. But this is not the place for pocket friendly meal and if you want to eat and not to look to your pocket, this is the place for you. The place has an outstanding atmosphere. The décor of the place is amazing. Overall experience is OK. But we can get better Bengali food in other places in Kolkata also at an affordable price.

In the city of joy, a foody can never be disappointed ever no matter what kind of cuisine one is looking for. If you're looking for having authentic Bengali food the Royal way, no other place can beat Aaheli at the legendary Peerless Inn at Esplanade.

The ambiance is overwhelmingly gorgeous and takes over your senses in a good way. The food, the service, the quality and the experience is all taken care of in the best possible manner.

Prices might pinch a few but I wouldn't mind that when I'm in a place like this.

In starter topshe fry and panir patisapta are winners. Coming to their main course their speciality  daab chingri is just delicious.Their bhetki and mutton preparations are also too good...also love their dessert items. Highly recommended!

Excellent food....good hospitality and ambience. One of those very few places that serve bangali thali with 2 - 4 non veg options. The portions are very liberal, so is the price..... Not a value for money proposition, but a good place to indulge once in a while. A basic nonveg thali with 2 nonveg options will cost almost ₹ 2000/- with taxes.

We were put up in Peerless Inn Hotel during Business Trips and on two occasions that we stayed there, we ate at Aaheli Restaurant, an inhouse restaurant serving thali meals. 
Traditionally clad servers and an amazing ambience to boast of. 

On one of the two times I visited, I was having vegetarian meals (by choice) and was very reluctant to have vegeterian Bengali meals but went ahead since I had no choice and it was my best decision that day.

I never knew Bengali vegetables could be served so yummmmmmmy and would leave an ever lasting impression on me. Vegetables like Brinjal, Lady fingers' etc. tasted the best I have ever eaten. Ofcourse, without doubt the non veg thalis are a touch better serving Hilsa, Prawns, Fish fry and some mouth watering desserts too. 

Yes, only thing which may go against them is that its a tad bit expensive.

Situated very centrally on Chowringhee and close to The Grand this is a MUST place for anyone particularily first timers to savour some good Bengali food. The non veg items are really excellent especially the Hilsa(Illish),Jumbo prawns in Sarson and the malai curry Chingri. Really yum stuff and quite a helping too. The mutton is ok and better selection of raw material is needed as there tends to be too many boney pieces. The Luchisare nicely made and come nice and hot. For the veg fans you have a great choice of baingan bhaja,dal,dumaloo, seasonal veggies etc.However to enjoy Bengali food you have to be a fish/prawn lover aswell as like mustard oil as a cooking medium.The ambience is nice ,neatly decorated and tables well laid out. Service is attentive and food comes within 15 minutes of order. So do try it and if a bengali food lover you wont be disappointed. .Good food costs money so dont be too particular--just relax and enjoy and savour the tart flavours and aroma.

Had an awesome experience of Bengali cuisine....best was bhapela sandesh, which was served as wrapped in banana leaf not too sweet but made perfectly to soothe your sweet tooth. We also had mutton cooked in a curry of raw mango, bhetki fingers, pabda fish and a couple more dishes. The food was indeed great along with the live Bengali music....
Must try for all lovers of Bengali cuisine

Aaheli, as my daughter's name suggests, I was eager to visit this place. Also , there was a genuine wish to eat at a luxury dine hall. We were there at festive time, during the gala Durgapuja to have lunch with family and of course, with my daughter Aaheli.

We were welcomed in calm and comfy manner, with their people coming to gather us and guide us to their dining hall. They welcomed us with garlands and flowers, with nice and warm smile.

We were then taken care of by their service. Clad in traditional Dhuti and Panjabi they served food in earthen utensils. The menu comprised of Gobindobhog, Bhaat, Moong Daal, Begun Bhaja, Luchi, Aalur Dom, Mutton Curry, Chingrir Malaaikari, Baandhakopir Torkaari, Shorshe Ilish, Doi Ponaa, Paapad, Chutney, Dohi. It was a good, actually awesome to have all these at the same time with those splendid aroma and flavour to remember it for a prolonged span of time. The food quantity was h-u-g-e. Moreover, the waiters looked after us very well and we just observed the very best of services rendered. Not to forget the ambiance was well decorated with simple and soothing texture and style.

Altogether with great experience and enjoyable one.

We ordered additional ALU bhaja and it was good too. The chutney was made from aam shottor and was quite tasty. Loved the meal. Aaheli ranked #3 in my Kolkata food journey.

Been here before many times. Must say standard has gone for a downhill course. Sluggish service. Even when there were only 2 families including us were dining in the entire restaurant. Nolen gurer Rabri was disappointing. Hardly a whiff of nolen gur was there. Khirer Malpua also disappointed. You literally have to search for kheer stuffing inside. Dudh pooli, they say are served 4 nos per portion. When it was served we could see it did not have 4 in it.  Our waitor insisted that there was 4. So we emptied the bowl in a dish right in front him.  And voila ! 3 was all that was there. 
With so many new eateries popping up, if these guys don't bother with maintaining their once-upon-a-time high standards, it would be a shame

Okay...Probably for people who've not had Bengali food before

Aaheli is famous as it is a part of the prestigious Peerless Inn. The ambiance and the look of it is surely impressive and the posh feeling doesn't take too long to sink in. We went on Nabomi day with our whole family and had booked our table well in advance, so no problems there. To start with we were ready for the set menu experience and the 'Bhuri Bhoj' was something that we ordered for all of us.

Coming to the service, I would say the waiters looked good in dhuti-panjabi and their behavior too was pleasant. However the warmth was missing and it looked as if they were trying to finish of things somehow!

Now the food. Although I noticed that every item had pure ingredients used in them, say ghee, spices and even the vegetables were fresh, yet the taste could not really satisfy my taste buds. There was chicken, Mutton, prawns and Hilsa fish, what more can someone ask for in a Bengali meal, yet hardly anything was extraordinary. To say in short, the spread was huge, and the quality of food was good, but then the most important thing was tough to find, which is the taste.

Maybe be the chef was not so happy working during the Durga Puja time. Also my uncle who has spoken to the manager for quite a few times over phone to inquire about the hotel earlier to plan the visit, wanted to meet him to which the waiter said that he was very busy. I would not have expected an answer like this in the hospitality industry.

Probably, if you have not tasted these dishes before, you might end up loving it. But otherwise it is just an okay experience! And I don't think someone would like an okay experience when he/she pays that premium for having that festive lunch or dinner with family.

I loved the food and the waiters were very courteous. They are all dressed in typical bengali traditional outfit and help u with the order as well. Loved the experience but burnt a huge hole in my purse. Nonetheless good for an authentic experience. The food was yummy. Me and my friend ordered for rice, cholar dal, Aloo chadchadi, Kakra vada, macher paturi, some prawn dish (forgot the name of it) and aam panna n mishti doi. The food is served on brass utensils and i love the traditional feel. The prices might have been revised since i visited last.

Location: Very accessible area of Esplanade. 
Ambience: the best part of the Inn i believe. Entrance and the reception hall of the ground floor is grand and gives a posh feel.The people who serves wear typical bengali outfits. Often live bengali music is also played that makes the ambience even better.

Food: food is good. But there are places in kolkata where one can get better bengali food spending much less.

Price: no doubt its a bit overpriced place.

AHELI -PEERLESS IN, kolkata

I never visited Bengali cuisine Aheli although I have experience with other Bengali restaurants in the city. AHELI is my awesome experience. Food is really cheap a person can manage food @Rs 2,500 in Ala cart restaurant. They know Bengali love food, bengalee is also cautious about money, more food is bad for health, so they serve food in very economic quantity, so that guest can maintain good health and can save money by not placing further order. They take care to build up relationship, so they have arranged very closed sitting arrangement , so that one guest can touch the heart of other guest easily.Food serving is also very professional disciplined way, starter is served in between main course with simplicity and acknowledge they they missed the starter to place the order in the beginning, becaue they are confused whether Bengali are logical or illogical ,decoration of food is very simple to convey message Bengali is very simple, taste of food awesome, so that Guest can realize that they cook more testy food at their kitchen. they do not want to loose you, and you will get get enough time to dry your hand naturally after taking desert.

Dear Friends, had an extremely shocking experience at Aheli, Peerless Inn, Kolkata over a lunch on Saptami. Other than the ambience at the restaurant, I could not find anything that justifies the super-exorbitant price they charge. 4 adults and 1 child had a bill for Rs. 10K for a lunch, items were hopeless in terms of taste and quantity was also ridiculously low. The service staff were very insensitive. They set the table in 2 mins after we arrived but missed to provide a glass and a plate to the child, served water only after we called them and requested them to do so after waiting... Sorry Aheli Team, I did not see any value for my money at your outlet.

If you are looking for a great place to  taste Bengali Food, Aaheli is the place. Food of both east and west Bengal , vegetarian and non vegetarian is available here. The ambiance, dress code all give a complete Bengali experience.The Bengali thali is great besides La carte menu.The restaurant has revived many of the dishes of old Zamindari houses.

This is a review for two Aaheli locations - the one at Esplanade and the one in Durgapur (which is not listed here). In Durgapur Aaheli is the only higher end restaurant that serves Bengali food and I've had several pleasant meals there (though haven't been back in a couple of years). 

I had some memorable radhaballabhi-aloor torkari for brunch there a while ago - the kind that make you go - screw calorie counting - this bliss is worth countless hours of punishment at the gym! 

I ate several times at the Esplanade Aaheli too - I was a guest at the Peerless Inn so Aaheli was a default choice. They make a phenomenal maachher paturi - better than practically every other Bengali restaurant where I've sampled the dish. They also make a godawful, nasty jhinge-aloo posto which can get this Ghoti's blood boiling - I was practically raised on posto - ain't no one messin' with my comfort food! 

Overall - Aaheli is a lovely choice for Bengali food in Kolkata.

On a trip to kolkata, exploring Bengali cuisine is a must do. So the search landed us at Aaheli. Instead of hunting on the menu card, we quickly settled for the thali. And what a choice it turned out to be! The chicken and fish dishes demand a special mention. Though on the costly side at Rs.1500, nice ambience with good food deserves a try, for sure!

We tried it once here and what I understood is some restaurants run on their brand. We all know that aaheli is a bit costly and we tried 4 course non veg meals. Initially it was good some of the delicious items were not good like chitol muitthya... bad experience.. though they have compensated with black forest cake as desert but still somehow didn't like the food in this particular one... I tried aaheli at other places but they were really good.. may be my bad luck or there is something not right. .
Now ambience wise it's pretty good. Simply loved the place.. I am recommending  a 4 star as other foods were good but can't give 5 star..

'Purely Bengali' is the perfect term I would be using to describe this restaurant.
Located in the esplanade of Calcutta, this restaurant serves the finest of Bengali dishes. If you're thinking on a serious note to visit and eat at this place, the Bengali New Year's Day would be the ideal time. The menu is designed for somebody who can really gobble in a lot.
Starters would include the fish fry and Posto Bora- from the non-veg and veg sections respectively.
For the main course try the Pulao with Mutton Kosha. An alternate to this would be consuming the Mutton Kosha with Puffed Bread(poori).
For the fish section you must definitely have the Daab Chingri and the Chingri Macher Malai Curry.Two of my favourite dishes in this place.
End your platter by digging into the Baked Rosogolla.Or go for a Hot Gulab jamun and ice cream.
Would really appreciate the service of this restaurant along with the wide choices it provides from its menus.The ambience is pretty good and a lot too goes with the brand name.
If anybody would ask me to dine on the Bengali New Year's day then I would definitely go for Aaheli.

If you love ur food n money dont visit Aaheli . Food quality was extremely bad. I found out hair in mangso palao. One of my other companion found a stone in his dish. None of the food was delicious which we expected from a high class cuisine. Only thing which I would appreciate is service.

First and foremost, I don't stay in Calcutta and hence not very familiar with the local food scene. So I make it a point to stick to the tried and tested names when it comes to family dinners.

This time around, for Poila Boishakh, we decided to head over to Aaheli since this was supposedly one of the best places for Bengali fare.

Upon reaching at around 9:30PM, all 5 of us opted for the non vegetarian Noboborsher Bhuri Bhoj thali. Well when it was being served it looked pretty, but that image was soon crushed once we started having the food. The Topshe fry was miniscule and cold, the Illish/hilsa was reeking of preservatives and tasted quite stale, the mutton wasn't done well (if I am at an upscale restaurant and paying a premium amount for the food, I would expect the mutton to be fall-off-the-bone quality), the Bhetki Paturi was bland and wasn't well cooked. So effectively, all the non vegetarian items in a non vegetarian thali weren't upto the mark. Do you see the irony? (Will this qualify as a move to discourage meat eating by the vegetarian brigade?)

We finally ended up paying 11k for 5 thalis and 5 aam pora shorbots. I've never paid such an astronomical amount for a meal for 5. Even in premium restaurants in Mumbai/Delhi! Sounds crazy right? If food's bad, no level of service or ambiance can redeem it (and to think I paid 10% service charge for such bad food)

All in all, please do yourself a favour and avoid this place like the plague. It might've been a great place a decade ago, but if you love your food and money, AVOID!

Awesome bengali food. Just loved the food and the ambience. It was my first visit here as well as my first day in kolkata. I wanted to have authentic bengali food in a nice and decent restaurant and unfortunately the hotel, Swissotel where i was staying didn't had any bengali cuisine restaurant so i was suggested this restaurant by our chauffeur Mr Shanker and it turned out really good. Right from the ambience, not to forget live bengali music to the quality of the food and the friendly nature of the staff and especially the lady who was serving us helped us select the best.  If i  visit kolkata again  aaheli will be on my list of restaurants to visit.

After so much searching and hunting had a very very disappointing evning/dinner here.. they say its the best in Bengali but I still regret it this moment too.. 

After seeing a Menu which was a book of my Metric and Heavy values in it like a Thali - Veg is 1350 bugs with Tax , isn't it insane..?  , after I ordered I was expecting too much and finding big Thali with 10 different sweets and stuff all that dream went in vein this res just  SU**S ...  There was smell of Oil which was burning on the table , welcome was good but horrible serving ... My wife took Palav , they did not even served that to plate !!!!  

My order was Thali + Palav = 1500 , tax is 490 bucks again !!! S*** it is TAX + Service Tax + BULL SH** TAX... 
okie now coming back to the Menu there was Balekayi bajji ( banana bajji) which was a day old was about to rotten andother food was okie , RASHAGULLA was horrible compare to what u get on street in Kolkatta streets... rest all was ok to some extent and they wont provide Raita for the Palav like dosa without chutney in it... 

please dont visit this place , I have eaten in more expense hotels but at the end of the meal Burrrpp said it all , here i packed half of the thing and gave away in streets... Haaan forgot to tell you , they did not pack the left over as its "JUTA" it was so embrassing to pack our self after paying so much...

I was recommended about this place by my friend and I was surely not disappointed. It serves you authentic bengali food. There menu was in the ipad. They have got such huge menu and it was confusing to see the menu on ipad. One of dish i orfered was hilsa fish and it was a pleasure tasting it. Their waiters are dressed up nicely in traditional clothes and are very amiable. They even had live performance of lady singing bengali songs with her group which was like icing on top of cake. Though it is expensive but it really gives u a good bengali feel if u r tourist like me.

I came across Aaheli during the Durga Puja week. Located inside the grand Peerless Inn, the ambience with paintings adorning the walls is beautiful, with the live Bangla music and the traditional attire of the staff adding to the charm. Coming to the food, I tried the nonveg thali. All the items were good, but the bhetki paturi, daab chingri and shorshey ilish deserve special mention. People were polite and cooperative. The biggest (and the only) disappointment was the price, which seemed too exaggerated. Overall, the meal was a pleasant experience.

If your non-bengali friend is visiting you from abroad and you want to take him/her for an authentic experience of Bengali cuisine, then look no further. Right from the time you enter the place, you are greeted with men and women clad in traditional Bengali attire with a smile on their faces. I always get a good vibe whenever I visit the famed restaurant at Peerless Inn.
If you are somebody, who cannot decide on what to eat and what not, ask the waiters. They are usually knowledgeable and helpful too. Tell them your preferences for spices, veg/non-veg etc and they should be able to give you good suggestions. and if you have the stomach for it go for the Bhoj (Thalis). I would suggest you to go for a veg thali and then add the fish/mutton/chicken as per your preferences. the a-la-carte menu items come in good proportions. So consult with the other people in your team before you order anything. The paturis are recommended and so are the prawn items. Bengali sweets have a big range and that is the only area where I am disappointed with the Aaheli menu. The range of desserts is way too little for me considering how much emphasis Aaheli puts on giving you the best Bengali dining experience.

Aaheli- being part of a star hotel" peerless Inn" wins a lot of points in the decor, ambience & presentation section. The live bengali music, the staffs dressed in traditional attire & their helpfulness & the refreshing wet towel that they provide for refreshing yourself at the beginning- will impress you. The thali is a good choice if you are a  looking for a reasonable meal. Else, the dishes are very expensive. The noteworthy items are the kakra r bora, Mocha r chop & Rui Mach er Patisapta in the starter, In the main course their Bekti Paturi is really good in quality. The Gondoraj Bekti is basically chunks of fish in a Gondhoray lemon flavoured gravy item ( unlike a dry item as in "Oh Kolkata") to be eaten with plain rice- good , but could have been better! Their Chingri r Bati Chocchori is a surprise since the prawns are steamed & then put into the spicy gravy & not fried! The result - prawns are perfectly cooked & not an inch hard!! Since i love my food to be little spicy i went for this dish instead of Pata e mora Chingri as per their suggestion & thanked them for it. One piece of advice- their all a- la- carte dishes comes with good quantity- which is good for two people. Hence order accordingly. Like the Paturi comes with two fillets, the gondhoraj bekti with 4 pieces, the chingri with 6 big prawns. The " goalando mangsho also came with 6 pieces. Oh yes this was good & not great but the mutton pieces was very very soft ! Alas -  the balance of price & quality!

recently visited this place with friends, the good things- traditional attire of the ppl serving us, courteous behaiviour and prompt service, oh the ambiance is top class if you visit with family, well the dissappointing part was  the food served was atleast to my small know how 10 times overpriced for the given taste, we ordered for the raj-bhoj thali @ 1500 bucks / plate incl taxes., the only item worth eating was the mutton which was cooked to perfection and the vetki paturi....the downfall was the chingri malai curry  which was not even roadside standard,,,,,the bhindi-mustard was distasteful and the loochi(puri ) served was not of maida but atta which was awful.
overall it makes a blackhole out of your purse .....u will surely come out with a crying pocket and a whining tongue.....

Aaheli is a total dampner! We tried the Bhoj menu, which is basically an equivalent to a 'thali' on 16th Aug
1. The food was cold, no dish was even warm
2. There was no Dish other than Fish Paturi which was anything delightful, It was usual fare, Some times even usual fare can be really tasty , here it was not , it was very basic!
3. Me being a Bong I did not find any Dish that would make me feel like coming back, May be for non-Bongs and no offence this place would sound good, Because yes they do get to taste bongspread! But seriously for those who have grown up on Bong Food! Sad!
4. The cost for Such a Thali including Taxes etc would come up to 3.5k!!!
5. They served Bhindi masala and you call that a bong recipie, When they understood I I totally felt let down, they got me some mochar ghonto.!!

Just plain bad.. try something else... dont waste time, dont waste money!

For Authentic Bengali Cuisine served in typically Bengali tradition ..Aaheli is one place
where all you demands or hopes would be met quite aptly!
The moment you enter , you are greeted by men & women dressed in a typically Bengali attire 
as they do on any special occasion, specially during marriage!The typical brass utensils/crockery
is used for service.Even the water tumblers are huge glasses made of Kasha(Brass).
Banaleaf is used for covering the plate on which meals are served.One shoud try the Aam pora shorbot which is 
of course seasonal & very native to Bengal.A must for Prawn lovers is the Dab Chingri.Mutton Kasha, Parshey Mach
Bhaja, Topsey Mach Bhaja & Bhetki Macher Paturi is really awesome! If you love to have chutney, please dont  forget to have Kacha amer chutney!As far as desserts is concerned my choice is Rabdi
& Shor Bhaja and not to forget the Misti Doi.
You will be offered traditional Pan at the end of the meal, which too is very native to Bengal!
In short you get to have a feeling of having attended a Bengali Marraige Party , except for the Bill you end up paying with.Non-Veg & Veg Thalis is a good option with top ups from the ala carte menu!

Its situated inside the Peerless Hotel at the heart of Kolkata, Chowringhee. The ambience and the decor both are remarkable. All waitresses are clad in their traditional white red border sarees worn in the old style and all waiters in Kurta and dhoti. They had been very helpful & courteous throughout. I was really pleased by their hospitality & service! The ambiance was equally good, except that it was a little noisy.

Coming to the food; you may ask either for a Bhoj or individual dishes and share with your family or friends. Bhoj combines some typical Bengali dishes starting with Shukto and moong dal, to mutton or hilsa fish and ending with chutney, rajbhog and a misti pan.

The food is served on Bronze alloy plates called Kansa, covered with a banana leaf on top. The plates, interiors, waiters ,all of these add to the traditional Bengali heritage culture, which I believe might be more charming for a NON-Bengali citizen. So again, I was equally delighted by their food.

I have no regrets after coming here for the third time. I just hope they reduce their prices a little, considering their standards. Nevertheless, it has been a great experience and I again look forward to dine here soon!

If you are someone who enjoys Bengali cuisine Aaheli is a place you should pay a visit to .... good ambience and service is something this place has never failed to provide me along with good food. What I is the presentation of the dishes in ethnic utensils which just adds to the over-all experience. Special mention goes to the thali's which I personally enjoy because of the wide variety they offer your taste buds. Their prawn preparations especially their daab chingri and chingri malai curry are a delight.

I am so not impressed with this place. I have no clue why this place is so talked about. The biggest turnoff is their quantity. Well I am not asking them to make it overwhelming but it should atleast be decent. The quantity is so little that it is impossible to fill a single person's tummy by ordering 1 plate. By the time you fill your tummy you'l realize half your bank balace is already over. Seriously what a pity. The ambience is the only good thing as expected and as a result no complains regarding this aspect. 
The prices are very high but I would not have minded if the quantity would have been a little better. The dishes taste really bland, I expect something more. I mean c'mon I don't want hospital food which is unbelievably expensive. 
Anyway overall my experience was quite disappointing and I rate it 2.5. I would still suggest you to try this one and wait to see if you thought differently.

Last year, I along with my parents and brother visited Aaheli - The Peerless Inn for dinner during Bengali New Year's Season. Basically we visited there because it was my dad's official party for Bengali New Year. As we reached there and parked our car in the parking area, the ambience of the place simply amazed me. I went on gazing at the beautiful interior decoration of the lobby. Suddenly the warm and caring hospitality of one of the hotel staff distracted me as he guided us to Aaheli. It seemed that he knows us for long time.

As the gateway to Aaheli opened with a traditional Bengali welcome saying "Namaskar" in folded hands, we entered into a totally new world. Really it seemed like that. All the male staffs were dressed in typical Bengali fashion statement, Punjabi and dhoti with chappal (slippers). This dining hall is totally decorated in Bengali style, with Bengali hand fans made from palm tree leaves, lantern and teraccota designs. The dining table decoration also reflected a Bengali style. After we were comfortable in our seats, one of the waiters, dressed in Bengali attire, came to us and offered us four plates and glasses, all made from "Kasa", a common and costly golden colored metal alloy used to made utensils in traditional Bengal. I was awe-struck to see this. As we were not there for normal dining, we did not require the menu card to decide our menu though we had it in our table. The first item (the appetizer) that decorated my shining Kasa plate was Rui Macher Patisapta. Unlike conventional patisapta, this patisapta (a conventional Bengali dessert) was totally stuffed with Rohu fish fillings. It was followed by a bowl of Bengali Pulao and Parser Jhal, Chanar Dalna, Posto Chingri, Chingrir Malaikari, Bhetkir Paturi, Bhapa Ilish and Dab Chingri. Finally the main course came to an end with one bowl of white rice along with Kochi Pathar Jhol. In the desserts also, everywhere there is an authentic touch of Bengali culinary art. Chanar Payesh followed by Rasogolla, Chanar Sandesh and Rabri were all we had in desserts. It was one of the memorable dining experiences in my lifetime, not only for the superb and heavenly preparations but also for the hospitality and ambience.

Revisited Aheli after 3 yrs, I stopped going there after my experience on the eve of Puja where the were serving incomplete Thalis to visitors because of the crowd, but this time I visited their on a weekday for lunch, the staffs were less than before, they were taking a bit more time for delivery, but yes! The food, they were as good as always. But a turn off was the RAJBHOG they served, it seemed a little NOT SO FRESH for me.

I went to Aaheli for the first time in class V. I was mesmerized, not so much by the quality of food but by the splendor of ambiance and versatility of cuisines (so many Bengali cuisines in one shot... I am talking about the Thali). That was in 1998. In 2012, the experience was different. Splendor is still there, but the quality of food is at best average. At one-fourth price you can get much better Bengali cuisine in many places.
