A pretty decent place for daily foood consumption.
Nothing flashy or extra appealing ,yet the crowd and the excitement that comes in a local shop is pretty much whats makes this place ...a good one .
Try the food out there it tastes good .

In the menu it states that they serve Pongal.
But every single time I have ordered for it, they have claimed that it‚Äôs not there in the menu.
My point here is that why do you even put something in your menu when you don‚Äôt even serve it.
Stop fooling people first if you wanna good name in this restaurant race.

Though I am writing the review after few days of my visit, I thought it's important for me to write for well being of fellow foodies and hopefully it strikes the management.
The seating area was full of mosquitoes. Yes I write again full of mosquitoes. I felt as if I was seating on a road side stall. Even after informing the staff no action was taken. As it was late, I had no choice but to continue.
Coconut chatni was stale. Even after reporting the same no action was taken. We had to have our food with Sambhar only.
Instead of showcasing quality through installed televisions, please focus on hygenie and cleanliness. The place has detoriated big time from its previous glory. Hopefully management does something to improve its services..yeah probably they will also charge you for extra servings of sambhar and chatni.

I came here with my friends, trusting their judgment on what a good place for a South Indian meal would be.
I am not very familiar with South Indian food, so my opinion and my taste are probably not sophisticated enough for people who have tasted Idli and Samosa in South India and really know what they're are talking about. Anyway, I found the food here absolutely delicious. This place is run by people from Kerala who brought South Indian cooks here to Kolkata. I had a Masala Dosa which had a fantastic texture and flavour. The chutney was very tasty too. I then had some masala chai.

What I found most interesting about this restaurant is that they have a TV which shows the cooks working in the kitchen. So, while you are tasting your food, you can look at the screen and learn how they make it. I thought this was a nice touch and I am looking forward to my next meal at the arak Restaurant.

Not a hidden gem of an eatery and certainly does not quite rule the connoisseur circles as it's name suggest. Visually damp the navigation to the entrance is one hell of an experience. Ordered a mini Thali and Chole Bhatura. Taste and price are at opposite end of a happiness continuum. Only solace being the ice popsicles with some interesting flavours(ordered Oreo and Strawberry Cheesecake ones). Service is satisfactory. Interior is basic.

Whoever I visit Calcutta I make it a point to go here. Their food is always fresh and tasty. They have kept the consistency going and the interiors of the restaurant are spic and span much like restaurants in the south only this is located in the east. 
Their thali is fantastic if one is really hungry and if not then a dosa followed by their yum filter coffee is the way to go. 
On my ten best list in calcutta.

I have been visiting this place since childhood, one of the oldest South Indian restaurant in town. I had to write this review so that management should know that they changed the interiors added few item good items in their menu and they taste great.. But the kind of poor service I have received in my last few visits, it's time management should start thinking about it. Your old staff doesn't listen to what customer is actually asking for.. Your staff served me a Pudina  cheese masala dosa without masala and when I asked him about he said should I bring it separately..
I love this restaurant and their food.. But very disappointed with the service.. Way too bad..

Not a good experience. It's being a veg day for me when I am not supposed to have onion , garlic also, but was craving for a hot dosa and idli, so I  called up the restaurant and repeatedly confirmed if they can provide absolutely onion, garlic free platter to my location, they confirmed that they will surely do. It is a rainy day so got a late delivery but the delivery boy was really courteous and nice  but while eating I was shocked to find onion in the masala dosa and the sambar I was having. It had really been a spoiler for me and I had to leave the food midway. Really felt too bad about this. They are indeed poor in following instructions.

I am sure a lot of you living around Hazra have tried out this place. Located on Manoharpukur road, this place is old and totally worth it to stop if it is on your way. Technically Michelin 1 star. Dosas are in good variety,  and all the dishes are of good quality and taste. Tried the idli, vadas, and a few different paper and rava masala dosas. The best part is the generous  helpings of chutneys and sambar and their high quality. Go ahead!

I have been going to this place since childhood. Irrespective of whether we get seated in an AC section or Non AC Section, me and my family always prefer it because of the food quality.¬†
Fast Service, well priced, decent staffs is an add-on reason to visit it.

Kolkata's must visit place for south Indian.¬†

With movement in the generation, they have still maintained the way they serve the chutney and sambar and thats what make it different.¬†

lastly the coffee is no doubt the best.

Happy Childhood and Going on happiness now :D

My father had always praised the South Indian food here so my expectations were tremendously high. However, I was quite disappointed. The food wasn't that good. The dahi bara dish was served cold. The cutlery also wasn't that clean. This is something which should've been a norm for every hotel! Even Dad concluded that the place had lost its charm and had degraded from its usual quality.

If you want to eat really good crispy hot delicious vadas and dosas then this little joint ahead of the hazra Chowringee crossing is your best bet. The food is served within minutes of the order. One of the fastest services I've seen. They have renovated the place so the AC is chilled in this horrid heat. South Indian to pizzas and North Indian snacks, this place has it all. Not to forget the yummy south Indian coffee. It's a place worth going out of ur way for if you love this cuisine.

Raj Restaurant, erstwhile Hotel Homely Raj has fallen from its previous glory. I have been eating the South Indian food they serve since as long as I can possibly remember. 

I used to love the Cheese Onion Dosa, Onion Uttapam and Idlis they served coupled with special chutney and onion chutney. 

The idli is as great as ever, but the rest don't taste the same. Something feels amiss. Over the years I've shifted to masala dosa which is good but not great. 

And for someone who associated Raj with great all of his childhood - this is a sure shot let down by all means.

Hoped in here for breakfast, a visit after 6-7 years roughly. Previously there were separate AC and non-AC section's but they are now done away with it and its now fully AC. Tried a special mysore dosa for myself and trust me it was that heavy that it took me 45 mins to complete it and I didn't take my lunch after this. Taste wise ok, sambar and chutney was also decent nothing extraordinary, would have loved various varities of chutneys.

Tried their new offering popsicle, tried banana choclate from their menu and it was a let down, it was like homemade icecream and badly presented in a tea paper cup.

Though the service was fast and chutney fillings was made even before I called for, but this place needs to update itself and add new varities.
PS: Have also tried mushroom from here, from my colegue's takeway from this place, mushrooms from here is a big NO, we 7 people couldn't complete it and it went waste

Yet there is not much to say, as the place has maintained its standards rather well.
The dosas are really thin and very tasty.
The ambience requires a lot of uplifting. Prices are not so low because of the reputation it has built over the years. On weekends, this place can get crowded.

When the Rasam came over in a steel cup, and got served as an appetizer soup, it made me truly happy -- that's how Rasam should be sipped, before a meal, and very few places serve it like this in Calcutta. It tasted quite nice, so did the sambar.¬†

The Thali had four vegetable dishes, of which the cabbage porial, as by far my only favourite. It was just amply cooked to drive away the rawness, but not overcooked like our bNadha kopi torkari. The other vegetable items were a goey bhindi and a tomato chutney. The bhindi was like a botched avial, which I didn't like. And the tomato chutney was unlike any south indian chutney, if it was one to begin with, since it did not have toasted dals or peanuts. There was also was another curry, which was basically vegetable added into a more condensed sambar with more jaggery.

In desserts, there was a sagu payasam, which both Maa and I liked. The other mandatory items included papadam, curd and pickle. Both rice and puri were served.¬†

To cut the long story short, I can't say it is the best south indian thali I have had in the city, esp when it costs around 200 bucks. The vegetable dishes need to be looked into, for sure.

Went to the oldest and the most famous south indian cuisine restaurant in kolkata, Raj Hotel Restaurant now called 'Hotel Homely Raj'. Located in Hazra, this place has been famous for its authentic yummy dosa and sambhar for more than 50 years now .
.
The taste, the quality, the ambience nothing has changed in so many years( as per my mom), except the prices ofcourse. üòù
.
On a monday night we had to wait to get a place, that crowded it is always. üò¨
.
If you are in kolkata it is mandatory to have south indian at Raj Hotel you won't regret it! üòÜüòÑ .
I had Paper dosa and their coffee is a must must to have.

I visited this place quite a few number of times and has always been a favorite place of mine to have south indian dishes. I like the chat that they make.
My picks from this place are : masala doshas, dahi vada, chholey bhatura, papri chat, samosa chat and dhokla.

Think South Indian food and this place comes to mind immediately. I come to this place frequently for some sumptuous south Indian delicacies. The idlis and the vadas and the dosas are simply mind blowing. My personal favourite is the Cheese Masala Dosa and other variants of it like the Onion Tomato Cheese Masala Dosa. The butter milk, coffee and fruit juices they serve are also pretty good. Service is also very quick and efficient.

This here is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. The ambience and d√©cor might not be much to admire about, but the core quality lies in the food provided here. Went there with a group of friends for lunch. There is ample seating space with long tables.

This place serves one of the best South Indian food. The Idli is amazingly soft. Cheese Paper Dosa is my personal favourite.¬† The service was real quick. The prices are also very moderate.

By Far the best south indian food i have had till date!! Surprisingly in the Eastern part of the country :)¬†

This is one of the oldest running restaurants i am told as i was going Kolkata for Just 2nd time so didnt have much idea on it..¬†

The place has 80's - 90's look.. but the food is quite awesome.. dont go for ambiance or crowd or etc... this place is just for true food lover..¬†

We had Idli / Medu Vada both of which awesome in terms of taste and size.. quite amazing..¬†

Also i had Sada Dosa which was nice and crispy.. totally blown away by the quality and taste and the prices are also quite reasonable...¬†

Also had the famous dancing filter coffee .. its called dancing as it has foam over the coffee with bubbles .. :)

A must visit place if you happen to be in Kolkata...!!

Located in an alley near the Cambridge School, Raj Hotel is one of the old soldiers of South Indian food. Overall, it puts up a pretty good show, with the dosas being light, buttery, and full of whatever stuffing you choose. I love their cheese and getting any item that showcases this cheese is definitely worth it every time. Abundant refills of chutney and sambar. Service is pretty fast, though rush hour might lead to some mix ups in orders. What is very weird though is the veg pizzas they serve here. A lot of fancy names and toppings, but the pizza itself is very greasy, and almost biscuit hard with very less seasoning. The "oregano" that they give on the table is mostly a hell-fire mix of chilli flakes and chilli powder so that adds nothing special. I would suggest perhaps sticking to the basic and wonderfully cooked homestyle South Indian fare, unless one is feeling really adventurous. Prices are on the cheaper side and very very good for a student pocket.

We love the food here. However, we have noticed that the food quality and changed a bit. Some items are better and some are worse. A recommendation is to stick to the South Indian. The thalis are superb. If its available, we usually go for this. If not, the next best thing is the rawa onion masala dosa. By God that thing will fill you up.

Then there are the crown jewels of this place in my opinion - the special filter coffee and the paan. The perfect was to end a South Indian meal.

Ambiance: Nothing great. I could see half done walls with only Plaster done. AC is there. Casual crowd. 

FOOD: Not impressed by the sambhar. Ordered a Cheese Masala Dosa and a plate of Idly. Wanted to have juice that's there in their menu but they said none of the juices are available. Cheese Dosa was good. Idly was really soft and melt-in-mouth. Would like if they bring back the juices to give an awesome kick start to the day for breakfast lovers. Else, a must try for South Indian lovers .

Raj restaurant situated in Manohar Pukur Road near Hazra crossing is a very old restaurant. I've been here innumerable times but had stopped going there coz I felt that their standard had deteriorated. Recently a friend praised it so I decided to try it out again. Pleasantly surprised and happy...they were back to serving good quality food once more. The idlis, vadas and dosas were excellent. So too were the sambar and coconut chutney. Now they also have variety of chaats and pizzas on their menu. Chaats and pizzas are also excellent.Great that the place has bounced back to its old high standards. Keep it up. The service was quick and efficient. The place wad neat...we sat in the non ac section with the marble top tables which always makes me nostalgic.(typical of south indian joints in Kolkata).

Though they do serve good dosa and filter coffee. But their pizza  specially  napoli is too good. It is because of the pizza I give them 4 out of 5. A very unusual thing about the place is that they sell gunpowder ( essentially a spice mixture) . So those who are keen to make gunpowder dosa you can take it from here. The spice is good . Tried and tasted !

The Sambar and Chutney very important parts of the meal are both very nice as well. They also make some very good vegetarian Pizza's. I usually order the Margarita or the Al Fungi both of which are surprisingly nice.End your meal with their Special Coffee .

It is lyk amazing feeling to see this restaurant here. One of my puppy loves that I used to visit as a child from my nanibari. Though it has been years since I've visited, I still remember that lovely aroma and that balmy feel about this place. A true vintage restaurant. so original and grounded. I remember the friendly staff and happy face on my each visit to the place.

For me a beyond comparison place with one of the best South Indian food in the vicinity!

If your Hunger Pangs are craving for South Indian food, this is the place which will satisfy.  Had a South Indian thali here, which consisted of dal, Sambhar, rasam, curd, 1 Sabzi or Vegetable(changes daily), pickle papad, Rice & 4 Fried Poori's to begin with. Taste is authentic & they do no compromise in any thing. Service is good & quick. Reminds you of home food. Comfortable & not too heavy on your pocket. This place is a sure shot winner. What let me down was their filter coffee (not included in thali price) it was not the best filter coffee but wasn't good also.

Location : 

It's near Hazra crossing in the opposite lane of Basusree Cinema. Limited parking is there on the road and in the small lane beside the restaurant. 

Ambience : 

The place is divided into two section one is AC and other is Non AC. Interiors are most ordinary. Marble top tables and plastic chairs. You can't compare it with a fine dining restaurant. Since years the interiors are same. 

Food : 

This place is famous for South Indian food. They have other varieties also like Pizza, Garlic Bread, Chat items and few more. But they specialise into South Indian Food. 

Dosa, Idli, Vada, Utapam all items are very good out there. The taste is perfect. It's one of the top five South Indian restaurants of Kolkata. 

Try out their Garlic Bread and pizza also. It's really good. They serve South Indian thali also during Lunch time. 

Filter coffee is also very nice Overall food is very good and if you love South Indian food then you must go out there. 


Service : 

Service is very average compared to other restaurants but it's not an issue at all. Food comes fast and for refill also you have not to wait for long. Staffs are a bit old but they are serving there since many years. Hygiene is not a problem. 

Price : 

Prices are average but considering South Indian food it's a bit on higher side. In the past few years South Indian restaurants have raised their prices a lot. So can't help it as there are few good South Indian restaurants over here. 

Overall I enjoy having food there. I have gone there number of times and can go again and again also.

However I will tell you that it's reasonably priced and people can get comfort food

Very neat and clean restaurant , but I prefer Banana Leaf more. The food here is good too. But sometimes it becomes difficult to locate a waiter as they are mainly too busy going in and out of the kitchen.
Another problem is car parking. I often eat with the trepidation whether the car is ok. No parking place.
Nowadays they have started keeping pizzas also. I have tried that too, and believe me, they tasted as good as any of those in any authentic pizza outlets.

It's one of the old south indian eatery still running successfully . They food they provide consists of the authentic south indian flavors. Idli and vada are the best here and there so many other dishes worth trying. They keep serving you chutney and sambhar without any hesitation . Due to its quality you may find it crowded on weekends but it's totally worth the wait. I also recommend you not to have pizza here.

In short - Amazing south Indian and mouth watering North Indian chaat etc

Please go here for great food at awesome budget prices. The lemon rice, cheese uttapam and friend idli were all mouth wateringly YUM. the surprise was that a south indian specialty restaurant can give su ch awesome North indian snacks. the dahi puchka is too good.¬†

A must visit for sure.

Having lived in the Manoharpukur Road area for a good ten years of my childhood, I have been pretty much brought up on the dosas and uthappams and idlis of Hotel Homely Raj, as the 'hotel' is referred to. For years, the food that I had sampled were of the takeaway kind: my father would set off to the restaurant, milk can in hand for the sambhar, and return approximately an hour later with a large bag containing piping-hot paper-and-banana leaf packages, containing dosas, the crispiest vadas, the softest idlis and some amazing (dry) coconut chutney.

Almost two decades have passed since then, we have relocated to an area approximately ten km away, but the ritual of bringing home 'South Indian food', whenever we stop by Deshapriya Park/Rashbehari area, remains the same. As does the packaging. Dosas, idlis, uthappams, chutney wrapped neatly in banana leaves, then covered in pieces of (South Indian language) newspapers, and tied with the thinninsh jute string that we call 'shutri'.

Must bring-home items?¬†
Masala dosa for Ma (paper-thin dosas stuffed voluminously with a very tasty aloo filling: not too spicy, with just the right balance of tomato and onion, tamarind and mustard seeds and curry leaves. Very typically South Indian, very wholesome. One is enough for a semi-hungry person.) Possibly one of the most popular items on the menu, it is served/packed very quickly once you place your order.

Onion Uthappam for Baba and me (thick uthappams, slightly larger than a Small Pizza, steam-fried to perfection with a thick layer of (chopped and fried) onion and large chillies, which is really the hero of the uthappam, and lends the thick disc almost all of its flavour.) This takes a while to prepare, as frying an uthappam to perfection takes about twenty minutes on an iron griddle. Expect it to be packed after at least half an hour after placing your order.

Idlis and Vadas for the next day (Idlis need no introduction; the one at Raj are large, fluffy and always fresh. Dip it into their delectable, spicy sambhar and there's your manna from heaven. The vadas are fried, but surprisingly not as oily as you'd expect. They are these incredible thick hoops, that always make me wonder how they are shaped out of the rice-dal paste before they are fried. Idlis and vadas come at 2 pieces per plate, but you can ask for one idli and one vada in a plate, which is what we usually do :) )

Special mention: the thick, grainy, milky chutney that is packed so carefully in a banana leaf, that not even a droplet leaks out of it into the main bag.

Not too fond of the sambhar. Very tasty yes, but a bit too spicy for my tastebuds :(

I have visited the restaurant a couple of times. There are two kinds of seating areas: AC and nonAC. Not much difference in setaing arrangements though; they have that mess/canteen feel about them: tables often laid end to end with chairs around them, so that if you are visiting with a small group, then there's zero privacy. But who needs privacy when you get the kind of food served there? We usually order the same stuff that we take away, but I'd like to mention the courteous and energetic staff that have been serving customers for aeons now. They are always smiling, always happy to help, and keep filling your steel bowls with the milky chutney and sambhar every time you finish them. I have often found myself having had more bowlfuls of chutney than the actual food.¬†

Pizzas are decent here. Thickish crust, but innovative toppings. But I'm not the kind who would order a pizza at a Dosa place. And don't ever, ever miss the coffee. Strong, hot, fragrant filter coffee, SO much better than those almost-cold, overpriced cappuccinos served at your fancy coffee shop.

Raj Restaurant, I will keep returning as long as you keep making those uthappams :)

The service is quick and food is good. They serve unlimited sambhar and chatni. They also have a prompt take away. The place is good and do enjoy a Sunday brunch there. Their mixed uttapam is a must try

Raj (now re-christened "Homely Raj" is one of the original classic South Indian Restaurants of Calcutta with Jyothi Vihar (Harrington Street), Anand ( Chandni Chowk,  CR Ave), Prema Vilas (Lake Market) and Kamala Vilas (not Komala, next to Metro Cinema Chowringhee). In the good old days, when Cal used to be the home of Box-wallah companies - Corporate Honchos like A L Mudaliar would stay at @TheOberois Grand but go for breakfast or a meal to Raj. Today, the main patrons are the rich vegetarian business community (euphemism for Marwaris) but the gold standards haven't been diluted even in the least. Tho there is an AC Room - the old Dining Hall still retain the pristine marble topped tables and friendly waiters. Only the the recipes have been slightly modified to suit the new clientele (the sambhar is a bit too sour) and the prices become steep not just by Calcutta standards. Anyway, don't forget to order the special chutney and podi (gun-powder) - end it all with the special filter coffee which is a treat to the tongue, palate, eyes, nose and the soul. While walking out pick up a Bida Paan from the reception - as you savour the memories on the ride back to wherever you're headed. This Raj still rules in the old city of the Raj. Saravannah Bhavan and Dasaprakash please offer a bow.

Raj - A very famous and old South Indian Eatery!
======
Location and Intro:

Raj is famous for it's south indian thali which comprises of 'Rasam'. It is not much difficult to locate raj. If you are heading from rashbehari towards hazra, on the right side JD Park Metro, take a right into that lane and keep heading straight and after 3-4 minutes on the left side, you discover Raj. When you enter this place, it is more like a homely experience and is also famous as 'Hotel Homely Raj'. This place has two seating areas as far as i remember. However, the ambience of the place did not attract me much.¬†
======
Ordered a Thali meal:-

Rice with sambhar - It was good. Tastes much better with curd or raita.
Puri - It was a bit oily. However, it was decent.
Paysam - It was a good dessert to finish off.¬†
Suji ka halwa(sweet) - We ordered it extra as it was highly recommended by one of my friend. It was worth it.¬†
Mix Veg Sabji - It was made in coconut oil. It was quite different from usual.
Rasam - It was served to me in a glass. It was a bit tangy.¬†
Rasam Vada - It tasted really good. Served pretty hot. Different from the usual sambhar vada. #musttry
======
Pros:
1) Pure Veg Affair.
2) Ambience is homely.
3) Very Reasonably priced.¬†

Cons:
1) Service was slow.
2) Can maintain better hygiene.¬†
======
Meal for two: 230-330 approx
======
Summary:
Food quality 3.7/5
Food quantity 3.9/5
Hygiene 3.5/5
Taste 3.5/5
Ambience 3.3/5
Hospitality 3.4/5¬†
======
Conclusion: It looks really good from outside. However, inside they should bring more improvements. I would come back and try more dishes here. :)¬†
======
Note: Unbiased review based on my eating experience. :).

Recently, on my visit in August 2017, i had paper butter sada dosa and filter coffee. loved it. now they have even revamped the ambiance still maintaining the homely charm. :)

I have had much fond memories of this place..i was definitely expecting raj to be one of the restaurants under the recently opened south indian section of zomato..
Unlike Anand restaurant which is also a renowned south indian restaurant,raj was also visited a no.of times by me during childhood..the place is small and non-spacious but surely it does maintain the basic indian culture and the heritage of south India..
Definitely a must try..:)

Indeed it is HOMELY raj! 
One of the best south Indian restaurants in town. The softness of the idly and the crispness of their dosa is the X factor here. 
Taste of sambhar and  chutney is also authentic!
Amazingly the pizza here was not bad either! 
Only drawback was they were out of MASALA (dosa) at 7pm itself.

Apart from the Idli & Dosas, I love the Puri Sabji the place serves.. The Pizzas too are not too bad. This place is becoming my favourite "Saturday Dine-In".. I hope they keep up the good work!

This place is really great for vegetarians out there. The place serves really great South Indian cuisine which makes a great breakfast or lunch. This place was earlier called Homely Raj Restaurant and is an old establishment.

Talking of the food, the dosas, utthapams and idly are some of the must try items. They also make very good aam pannas. Apart from South Indian, they also make street foods such as chaats, dhokla, bhel-puri and other items. However not sure of their quality.

Ambiance is not really great to talk about. However they have improved much over time. They have two rooms, one with AC and another small room without AC. The room with AC is cleaner and well decorated white the other room is a bit cramped.

Pricing is really cheap as you would expect. Service is kind of mixed bag as they serve you some items very quickly while some take them ages. Packing is not bad, so you can takeaway some items if you want without leaking the chutneys.

So, overall a nice place to treat yourself, if you are looking for some South Indian style breakfast.

One of the most traditional south Indian restaurant one will come across ever in the city. It is never empty. Even in non peak hours you might to wait for a while. The food here is very good. And it is also quite renowned in the city. The place isn't very highly maintained but the service provided here is quite good. South Indian delegates are served food from here. The restaurant is one of the best the city has to offer, when it comes to south indian food. Do treat yourself at this place, it will definitely please your taste buds and also not trouble your pocket much.

Situated at monoharpukur road,this place offers some authentic south indian dishes that too at a very reasonable price.

Some of the best dishes they serve are-dhaniya masala dosa,paper masala dosa,dahi vada,mixed uttapam and lemon rice.I would suggest all the foodies out there to try all the varieties of dosa and uttapam available here and mark my words you wont be disappointed at all.

A drawback of the place I guess is it closes down early......so make it quick guys!

This South Indian restaurant was two building apart from my old home.. Was an almost regular place for the times we fancied that type of cuisine... Did make impeccable doses.. With an heavenly white coconut chutney... Bt these days the price has risen,  but the quality not quite..

Visited last evening.
medhu dosa - soft and thick
sambhar and chutney - disappointing
dahi vada - regular
Nice and clean. Prompt service. 
Not overwhelmed, but got quite a variety to offer so will visit again.

This is the name by which its well known amongst a large number of families.
This place is amongst the childhood memories I have regarding south Indian food. 
However, I have been to this place just once and the rest of the times it has always been a take away. 

Coming to the Fooding, 

- The dosas here are an absolute masterpiece. 
Made to choice... 
- The idlis and vadas are soft and crisp respectively. 
Both are served piping hot. 
- The sambar is one of the best I have come across, and the chutney, especially the special chutney is heavenly which is a usual for takeaways!
- The masala is flavorful and rightly tempered.
- The uttapams are thin and soft. The veggies on top are always fresh.
- The molgapodi is also correctly made.

Prices are moderate in nature. 

A must try for all the south Indian lovers out there. 

Great food, great memories! :-) 
The take aways are still on for random Sundays!

This is the place where we used to go through our lives... even before any other place opened up around town with a AC it was always RAJ for south Indian food... now a days there are many options in the area like Bhupendra Mansion and Banana Leaf and the likes of the same which have opened up... even garden Cafe has come to the area... so after ages me and my father went just for old times sake... i have to say compared to the Raj that i knew the place has gone down in the likes of Quality and taste.... for ambiance this place was never a place to visit.. but the food was just too good... but now after the last visit we were not as happy and wished we had gone to other places instead...

the idli was hard and not up to the mark and the samber lacked salt.. which the guy himself came and said that they have added to the batch... the chutney as usual is top of the line and the special chutney of Raj is still just the best... 

the Dosa (paper Butter Sada) was not crispy the way it was supposed to be and lack of butter was evident other wise it would have been crispy... the dosa mix which they use is still the great and the taste is really good... 

the coffee which we were served was a disaster and they had added way way too much sugar and we had to let that be...

i guess with the choice of adding so many international dishes they are soon forgetting their ground basics which is something everyone should concentrate on....

Nostalgia is the word which comes to my mind when it comes to this place. Use to go here for breakfast as a kid. You get good south indian food here. Being from bangalore i am used to the typical south indian breakfast but this place has a different taste all together. Agreed it has a bit of the north indian twang to it but the food is still worth the try. I loved the paper dosa here and the vadas but my all time favourite is the dancing coffee which you don't find anywhere else.

I'm pretty regular here ! Since it's the nearest to my school..
No I don't go here for the dosa , I go here for the extra cheesy pizza that they serve ! 
I absolutely love the pizza ! One of the best veg pizzas I ate . 
Plus it's a very homely place .. And it's not very expensive ! I highly recommend this place ... Be it the pizzas you eat or the Dosa !

OK! Is this a second listing of Raj or have i just forgotten to review the place right next to my childhood home ? 

Raj has been one of the most significant common factor in every Sunday of my childhood and till date i look up to it for the fantastic quality and the freshness. 

I just love their rawa dosa . The paper dosa is brilliant too . They make the best special chutney in the city . It is thick and coconuty and just perfect . The sambhar is superb too and the staff makes sure that your sambhar and chutney bowls are never empty . 

If you order the thali be prepared for a HUGE treat . simply adorable tamil food ammocpanied with heavenly rasam that is a treat in the winters. They also give curd chilies with the thali which adds that extra zing to the whole experience . 

They have now started sandwiches which are not too my liking and honestly a tad bit over priced too . The pizza is generous and tasty especially the funghi pizza. 

One must not miss the curd rice during the summer, and the wadas are really crisp and delicious  too. They have a goof range of fresh juices and dancing coffee that makes it a perfect brunch place .

The finale of the trip is the Paan .... they also have this sweet supari in pink packets that is simply delicious and a perfect mildly sweet mouth freshener. 

Raj is nothing short of a landmark !

This is the place that I visit when I want to have a good south Indian food. This place serves the best Butter Masala Dosa in town. The chutney they serve with IdlyDosa is simply awesome. I generally come here with my family for a sunday brunch and end up ordering the same thing always 
- Idli and Vada
- Butter masala Dosa
- Butter Paper Plain Dosa
- Uttapam
- Special Coffee : this thing is awesome. It is layered and it mixes when you add sugar to it. I call it dancing coffee!!
Quality of food is awesome and is not exorbitantly priced. 
Coming back to the restaurant, they have an AC section and a non AC one. The food quality doesn't change but I guess the price does (I am not too sure about that)
Service is prompt and friendly. A good place to have the Idlies and Dosas on a sunday :)

Raj is one of the top notch South Indian food joints here, in the city of joy. 
Located at Rashbehari near Jatin Das Metro, this place is a paradise if you are dosa lover, like me. 

I instantly ordered Masala Dosa, in a moments notice the waiter served the fare. The aroma that followed almost initiated a frenzy and i couldnt stop admiring the smell for the first few minutes. It had the perfect crisp and the soury taste that you have in dosas down south. The masala deserves a special mention, as it perfectly compliments the dosa. The sambhar was thick and a bit bland, but the chutney made up for it with its sharp coconut flavour!

Finally, I topped it up with a glass of lassi, it was thick and fresh and chilled...just the way I like it. The cherry on top, I would say.
The prices are on the higher side, one can feel but its absolutely worth it, you look for such warm places serving such amazing food. Hence, i make it a point to visit it as often as I can.

Best  Chutney at any South Indian restaurant. Love the food , the place is about average , but that's all you get at South Indian restaurants. The staff is good and quick. ! Lip smacking dosas and chutney. Now recently they have started off with Italian. Have tried pizza and all those are good as well.

Raj restaurant was started by Shri Raja Subramanian long back and now it has two branches in Singapore and two in Kolkata. The one we are talking about is located in one of the bye lanes near Hazra more. The place is clean and peaceful. The staff are polite and prompt. Rates are on lines of jyoti vihar and anand. 

The chutney, sambhar and the special chutney are very good. The idly is just awesome. I personally do not like the masala of the dosas served here. I would prefer the masala of anand or a jyoti vihar or madras restaurant. But the plain butter dosa makes up for it being so crisp and well baked. I do not find the malkapuri served here so good. The vadas are really nice and crisp but you should just confirm before ordering if ther are serving fresh vadas or just warming the already made ones and serving which happens during day hours.

Pros:
1) Clean and peaceful place
2) Idly is just too good
3) dosas are well made 

Cons:
1) I do not prefer the masala of dosa here
2) Malkapuri is not that good

I would not travel specifically to eat here but if i am around and hungry, i would not mind this place!!!!

Situated near Uttam mancha on the ground floor of the hotel Homely Raj,this place has been serving quality South Indian food for decades.The quality of the food here is excellent.I am not a big fan of South Indian food myself.But one just cannot say the quality of food served is not good.
They serve authentic tasty food.The dosas are nice and crisp.The idlis are really soft.The chutneys and sambars are all really well made.There are numerous varieties of items specially dosas available in the menu giving ample opportunity to experiment if one feels like it.They also offer some other non South Indian items like chola batura,pizza etc.I quite like their chola batura.But it is the South Indian food that gives this place its charm.
The service is excellent.The prices are quite reasonable.The ambience is okay but it is one area where the place can improve.Overall if you are a lover of South Indian food then this place is surely worth a try.

Raj restaurant is located inside the Hotel Homely Raj (1965), adjacent to the popular theatre "Uttam Mancha" in a quiet by-lane off S.P Mukherjee Road. A must visit for all those who swear by pure South Indian food rather than it‚Äôs spiced up "Bengali" version.  

Situated in a place very near to the main road, yet so far away from the city's noise and pollution, this olden place offers a very homely atmosphere indeed. When you enter the AC section, you'll be greeted with a simple decor and clean surroundings, teamed with some very polite servers (I've heard they're all especially hand-picked and trained which clearly shows from the start till the end!).

The menu is quite extensive, but being here for breakfast, we ordered a simple masala dosa.
Steel bowls were promptly filled with piping hot sambar and coconut chutney, which was followed by the alluring smell of freshly baked dosa making an entrance from the kitchen. The huge roll of adequately crisp South Indian pancake, made with a slightly sour batter felt complete with the enormous heap of sweet filling (with mashed potato and vegetables) tucked inside. While the traditional sambar was too thick and bland, the coconut chutney was a smooth and perfect blend of subtle flavours.
Finally, a cup of their distinctive dancing coffee or a glass of lassi is the perfect choice to wash down your meal with. 
As for the prices, they are slightly on the higher side if compared to other renowned South Indian food joints, but that again is just my personal view. 

Overall, their home cooked food and warm service makes way for a real nice experience.  :)

Great Food! Best Dosa in Calcutta, (even better than Anand or S/India club) whether it's traditional or fusion that you desire. They use fresh ingredients, and combine them in a flavorful way. Food never cold. Chutney never rancid like Banana Leaf. Fantastic value for money. Eaten there many times, and never been unsatisfied. Friendly service in a homely atmosphere are a plus. Don't expect the decor of the Taj Bengal but if you enjoy a scrumptious culinary experience, this is not to be missed!

Homely Raj is the place I would rush to when I am in dire need of a pizza/dosa fix. They serve both. Both are quite tasty. The Pizza is what I would want after a long, exhausting day, and the quantity of toppings and cheese is something to write home about - and for me, it is something I would split, alongside a masala Uttapam, followed by a cup of hot, strong filter coffee. And yes, a plate of idli for me please. They are so soft. 

And oh. Okay, I am a Rasam lover with my Idli, and this place gives me what I want most of the times. What I also adore is the value-for-money meals they have. I have had lunch here and have had to be carted away (after nearly fainting from the food I consumed). 

They also serve these huge tomato and cheese sandwiches, which are incredibly satisfying, and makes a mean Hummus with pita bread, which is slowly becoming my pet obsession.

The food is hot, tasty, and the service is brisk and smart. The guy who is my regular waiter loves me enough to get me a rose milk even when they are supposedly out of rose syrup. And okay, I love the way they make the Horlicks here. Yes, you heard me right.

This is a place I have been going to for South Indian food at Calcutta for over 2 decades now.
It is a small little restaurant on the ground floor of a south Indian business hotel in south Calcutta.  

From the taste of the food it is difficult to figure out if you are in south India or in Calcutta.
The difficult part is selection at raj their list of dosas just goes on and on and on... 
Typically I wouldn't miss an opportunity to have their meals during lunch but this time round I went only for the Dosa. Here is my pick from their menu:
Meals: is definitely the first option - this is a typical Tamil meal and a gala affair, it covers all courses and leaves you completely satisfied.
IDLI and VADA - I love their IDLI soft, with the right texture and unlike other south indian joint in the northern or eastern part of the country it is not over fermented. Vada is BIG and good to taste. 
Dosas:
1. Masala / Paper Masala Dosa: not much of a difference between the two since they make really thin and crisp Dosas, The only difference is Paper Masala Dosa has a lot of oil. 
2. SPL Medhu Dosa: This is a really heavy dosa but if you love spicy dosas you will love this one it is well coated with podi and ghee also the masala is applied as a layer uniformly on the whole dosa. This is served folded like a pita break with stuffing.
3. Rava Dosa: My all time favourite dosa comes in various variants (Masala, onion, etc.) crisp as expected and roasted brown.
Coffee: 
A Prime attraction - they serve dancing coffee, the concoction in the bottom of the glass and the milk in the top - they don't mix it and when served it looks like the milk is dancing in the glass. 

Overall amazing place - service rocks - the waiters have grown old serving at the same place for years but speed and customer service still remains a priority. 

Only one recommendation is do not order the SPL chutney here it is a waste of money since their regular chutney is very thick. 

and yes before I forget authentic chutney and Sambar that tastes home made not like the sweet and sour water u normally get at a darshini.

I would keep going back whenever I am at Calcutta!

I was visiting a someone in the area and over cups of coffee at their office, they offered some dosas from Raj (situated just across). I remembered reading on Zomato about how surprisingly good their pizzas were, and I suggested they try a pizza instead. Intrigued, they ordered one. Told the office bearer to get a pizza. 

He was back pretty soon with a box, which, when opened, gave off an aroma of utthapam. it was a largish (about 12" thin crust pizza). Did not look bad at all (with tomato, capsicum and onion) and we bit into it. Tasted rather good, though a tad oily. No unnecessary spice with it. We just sprinkled a powder that seemed to be a mix of some oregano and chilli flakes (may just have been chilli too). The crust was crusty, and all in all surprisingly good. I will not be able to guess which one it was from their menu, but I would very much like to try them again.

I just hope they go a bit easy on the oil. Someone commented it must have been fried on the pan :) Guys... do give it a try. Lighter and much cheaper than its brethren from the big pizza chains.

A visit on 15 April for Poila Baisakh was very pleasant. We all had a mix of alu puris, vadas (nice, hot and crisp), the South Indian Thali (with some awesomeness, especially in the dessert), and a pizza. The pizza was great (though a little soft). Well worth the money as always. The coffee was dutifully strong. The service... excellent. Genuinely pleasant. Keep it up.

You don't have to be South Indian to appreciate the real taste of South India Food. The aroma of the saambar fills the Rash Behari Avenue. I believe this is one such place I visited first when I was in the class nursery. Typical taste of what one expects. 
You speak of the delicacies, here they are the long long long family Dosa, The Curd Rice and no wonders the always Rasam. One place to go with family and have an original ethnic taste.
