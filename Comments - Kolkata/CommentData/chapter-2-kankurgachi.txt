Don't go for this. The food quality is not good, and the other thing is the behaviour of some staffs are not expected. Don't go for the buffet.

I chose this place for a 31st get together with my friends & i must say, i loved the ambience and the food. The candle light decor in the evening was bang on. And absolutely the live music.. That was great considering the guy was singing COLDPLAY songs. Duh.. Obviously the best.. 😉
1)chicken steak with mushroom sauce
2)roast chicken

Limited items in the buffet menu but all of them r too delicious, tasty and fresh and cooked up to perfection. Beer battered fish and drums of heaven were the best of the lot. Staffs are too good and well mannered. Live music, cool vibe with a retro feel and yummy foods. What more can one ask for!!!

Got bored of haka and decided to give this place a shot..

Ambience and Decor: music themed, this place is nicely decorated with comfortable seating. Hosts live performances.

Food: This is where the disappointment starts. The drumsticks and fish batter fry were just ok. The paneer starter was simply pathetic with uneven cubes and dry as a desert. The mains were just about ok. Nothing to praise about. And yeah they had prawns in their menu. The chicken was soft but bland. The chinese fish was ok. The darshan was good. Had plenty of it to fill my tummy.
The welcome drink was pathetic again.

Overall: You can skip this chapter for sure if you are looking for buffet and visit the place beside. ;)

The ambience is their key.
A complete retro feel with all that decor and the live music is just out of the world.
The staffs are very courteous. And the buffet was great as well. The price for the buffet is very much affordable and is a value for your money. Weekend buffets cost more than the weekdays though.
They have a good choice of starters and main course but the dessert section could have been better. 
Overall I enjoyed eating with all my favourite country songs being sang live.  The half point that I have deducted is due to it's location. It has only one branch and that is quite far. 
You can give it a try , definitely.

"I found a COCKROACH in my food"
It's been on my wishlist for quite long but I had the most disappointed visit although the staff was very courteous and efficient. The live show concept is spot on (the singer was extremely good) , ambience was good. The food was low on quality and less variety was served. Most of all I found a ""COCKROACH"" in my crouquette that really turned me off . I don't expect a place like this to have such level of unhygienic maintenance. I am never repeating this place ever again. I have posted the pictures . Do check. I saw the waiter roaming around with a electric badminton thing used to kill mosquitoes. I simple failed to understand what was wrong.

Chapter 2 offers retro dining experience.. Located at the 4th floor of Mani Square mall, this resturant shares space with other budget friendly as well as reputed restaurants like haka, flame and grill, hoppipola and Machan. Both buffet and a la carte were available. We opted for the buffet option. The starters were served in the table.. They taste nothing extraordinary.. Main course too had nothing extraordinary in its list, but few of them tasted quite good.. The dessert section did not satisfy me at all.. In a nutshell the food served did not have much variety to show.. The staffs and manager himself was courteous enough.. The service was prompt and good.. Price was reasonable.

If you are looking for buffet within pocket pinch, this is the place to come for. The staff is extreme polite, good hospitality. The buffet spread changes everyday,  we had a whole lot of varieties. The menu had Chinese dishes as well as Mughlai dishes,  starting with a spread of salads, soups and a lot of items. You will also have veg items. The wantons we're great and the chicken dishes we're really good. We had 23 dishes in total.

Visited on the 25th dec with my family and friends but was highly disappointed firstly with the cheap and horrible quality of food and to make matters worse was your disgusting LIVE MUSIC YOUR BAND. What is wrong with the owner and management I've heard much better live Bands there Barefoot and Orchids the guys from Barbeque nation both bands were awesome that's what I call good bands who really make your visit worth while and make you visit again. Not these present bunch of jokers I had requested a simple song Red Red Wine by UB40 the band was lost and they told me that they regular female had not come and they had another girl singing which was really none of mine concern all i wanted to hear was my song It really made no sense to me as my request was a male song. And sorry to say the band was a disaster and spoilt our xmas meal . Must say you guys are killing such a beautiful restaurant WAKE UP OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT BEFORE YOU HAVE TO CLOSE SHOP AS THE ROADSIDE FOOD IS MUCH BETTER THAN YOUR RESTAURANT.

In one word - don't go. Its a sham as far as food and service are concerned.

FOOD : we had buffet - poor spread, poor preparation. Additionally, their adverts very smartly, led us to believe that a special christmas menu was on offer  at the buffet, so we booked and went. But this was not the case - Christmas dishes were available only a la carte. Additionally, the buffet items were cold, even the standard lamps under the containers were not provided for. The only dish we liked was the prawn curry.
SERVICE : Poor at first, V Poor when it filled up.

DECOR : 5 on 5 accompanied with a live performance.

OVERALL Rating : 1 on 5 or maybe 2 on 10 at best.

Food on the plate: very good cuisine and taste from continental point of view. But very regular items on the buffet and not anything special about it. 4.0/5

Decorations: the restaurant is nicely decorated but could have been better. Only a little side part is left to access the bar counter and most of the space is covered by a vintage car, which looks good but it's placement is little bit on the wierd side. 3.5/5

Ambience: If you have the taste of retro English songs then this is the place for you. P.s  Don't expect a MD Rafi , kishore Kumar song. Sound is good. 4.5/5

Cost: cost is bit on the higher side, but it can be justified. Having a restaurant in one of the nicest places of Kolkata Mani square  is a wealthy affair. 4/5

Visited for a corporate team lunch today. Initially we have planned for some other restaurant nearby but due to short of time and seeing the other restaurant crowded, we thought of giving it a try.

The environment and the fantasizing decor is good enough but the original thing on which the restaurant should concentrate more upon i.e the food and service , is not up-to the mark.

The Starters consists of 4 items. 1 Veg Soup , 1 Chicken Soup, 1 Veg Pakoda, Fish butter fry and Pepper Chicken wings with a complimentary drink. They provided the Chicken Soup and the Fish Butter Fry and after that it took around half an hour to serve the starters again, because some "internal problem" happened according to them. 

So as we are hungry and could not wait for any more after 20 min we started the main course. After that when we are on mid way with the main course they brought the starters that was left, that was pepper chicken wings, whose quality is not so good. 

Coming to the Main Course, there were Rice, Pulao, Chili Fish, Prawn, Macaroni and 2 types of noodles, which is of no use. Instead they should have made 2 types of veg items. There was less or rather no Veg options / side dish for the vegetarian team members, they had prepared only Chili Paneer and nothing else. The Non-Veg items was okay but not of great taste which should be good according to the buffet price.

The Dessert section looked pretty much okay than rest of the things. It consisted of one type of normal cake, pudding, fresh fruits, mousse and ice cream.

Overall it was not a good experience according to the expectation

Wide range of collections of foods and few new times as well. Had buffet during puja.. That was not so great which usually happens across many restaurants.. At least there should be a complimentary welcome drink for the buffets. Otherwise it's OK. Looking forward to taste the a-la-carte menus.

The kingfisher beer I liked the most .The live music was another wonder . Thumbs up to this restaurant. I would like to visit there once again .

This place serves you all if you go for a buffet on a budget which we had done exactly somedays back. It offers live music, descent ambiance of that of a bar and some descent main course on a tight budget which is easily noticed given the dummy starters that don't sizzle at all. Main course included pasta, some chicken something, rice ,etc. Deserts ended with strawberry/vanilla ice cream and some chocolate mousse.

Situated at the top floor of Mani Square amongst legendary restaurants like Flame n Grill and pocket friendly like Haka.. but this one actually lagging behind them.. quite a step I would say.. 
1. Food : We opted for lunch buffet on a weekday for 4 people @ Rs. 499 + GST= Rs. 524 each. Buffet spread is limited and contains

A. Starters : 
* Chicken Sweet corn soup - Too clear and no thickness.. Almost tastes like hot water having chicken and corn.. hence we dare not to try the veg soup
* Drums of Heaven - Tastes good but chicken was undercooked.
* A fish starter : Almost like fish batter fry... Tastes awesome and quality of fish was excellent.. kudos to them.. 
But sadly that's it for starters.. 😥

B. Main Course : The spread is good... Contains 
* Egg Fried Rice - Tastes nice
* Chicken Hakka Noodles - Tastes Average
* Macaroni and Paste - not interested
* Chicken Maincourse - Nicely cooked chicken in thick n spicy gravy.
* Prawn Maincourse - Thums up for that dish.. Gravy tastes really good and also the prawn.
* Fish Maincourse - Tastes nice.

C. Dessert : I'll be happy if they remove the dessert from the buffet... ' Disastrous Desert'.... nothing in it... Custard..Low graded Darshaan... Fruit cake(not even chocolate)... 3 types of Ice Cream... Vanila... Chocolate... Strawberry.. Chocolate sauce was there.. but no Choco Chips , no Other kind of sauce nor crushed nuts.. 

2. Decor and Ambience : Nicely decorated Restaurant based on Music Theme. Provision was there for live music performance and also song request as per ur choice.. but buffet space is scarce , sometimes got overcrowded and have to wait in a cue.

3. Service : Very poor service... Staffs are slow and not completely aware of the activities that have been going on.. The manager told us that starters were to be served in the table.. but after one round they didn't serve voluntarily .. so we have to go to the buffet place and serve ourselves. Complete inefficiency and mismanagement.

Finally the fish starter and the main course saved the day... otherwise I'll give them "2"

I had heard some good thing about this place & what I saw was also good , atleast in term of good quality. ..
In term of ambiance & decoration , they have done good job as the theme is based on resto style 😀 ( into the 80's) ..
The most important part is they serve you best buffet items with reasonable price 😊😊😀 ... 
All together it was a great day out there  ....
Hope to visit this place again sooner than later 😀😀 ...

I loved the place.... Went there to celebrate my birthday. The staffs were extremely friendly and cooperative. The food is also pretty good.. It is light and suitable for people like me who can't tolerate very spicy dishes. However I feel that they can include a few more items in the dessert. But compared to the price they charge, I definitely feel this place deserves a visit. The retro ambience is really cool and is good enough to get some instagram worthy pictures.

May be they have a retro theme, but their presence is pathetic. You can't even feel their atmosphere. The staffs are not cooperative. They don't even know what is available or not. A simple dish served at least 30-40 mins later. The food quality is average. Didn't understand what's the point of too much high price tags. They need to improve a lot, if they want to continue their business.

I have tried their Chinese cuisine. (Very basic ones which didn't taste well)
The food is average given the price. (I wouldn't want to revisit.)
The ambience is okayish. Nothing great about the live music (I didn't like it one bit). Retro theme works fine. But they really need to work on their staffs(their knowledge about the menu), music and food items. The staffs couldn't even help us with what to order.

I am a great lover of food . After me and my friends visited Oudh 1590 and Chowman , we decided to visit Chapter 2 , owned by Mr Debaditya Chaudhury .

• Coming to the decor . The gate was made of wood likely. The royal Enfield bike inside was a stunner! The restaurant was perfectly decorated . The chairs were soft and gave us a cosy feeling . The glass screen was amazing and we can view Salt Lake Stadium easily .  The big watch was a beauty . 

• The behaviour of the staffs were courteous .As for the manager Mr . Indranil, he was very good and verbally he was very nice.  The other staffs loved him and we're ready to work full heartedly . The other staffs were also good.

•  Food is nice . I loved the chicken spaghetti and my Heineken beer . 

•The new karaoke band was just great . It gave me goosebumps . They sang Shape of You , my fave . 

After all it was well visit. Just keep it up Chapter 2!

Visited this place on Friday the 8th my 5 visit after a break of 2 months. Must say this place is dying the quality of food that is served is just horrible and the staffs are not at all discipline. Firstly they don't speak English which is a shame even in the smallest joints the waiters speak in English. The service is like a slow boat to China you literally have to wait for your food or even your bill.
Its real sad that the owners have spent a fortune in the place but the main purpose is not being taken care of Good food and service snd the staffs done hestitate to get rude to you importance is only given to big groups .
My luck came across a kitchen staff who is nomore with the company He told me that the entire restaurant and staffs are controlled by Mr.Indranil the main man of the owner. And that he is nothing but a bully and he was the reason for him leaving noone in the restaurant likes him. And that he is the main cause of all the problems thats why the staffs work half heartedly. He also said the owner has other restaurant but no complaints and the food quality n service is just top notch so why is this place suffering.
I personally think this Indranil should be transfered to some other outlet and then you will see a big change in quality of food and service.
Lastly must comment on the only attraction your live band it just SUCKS a bunch of amateurs that's the best you can offer your guest ? I remember people dancing to the previous band and even going up and singing with them.
Change Mr Indranil you will do better business all you need is a well efficient manager which I think you already have Mr Santanu a well experienced gentleman who knows his job inside out but I personally think he is also being controlled by that goon.

One of the best places to have a buffet in Kolkata often rivalled by haka just opposite it.
The service and the ambience was good . The staff were courteous.
Coming to the food the buffet spread was pretty good. The chicken lollipop and burn garlic friend rice was good. The soup was pretty decent. The butter noodles were delicious. The pasta was good. Desserts had darsan , cake slices and mousse which were decent too.
Definitely a must visit for all quality buffet lovers.

Great place for good food and awesome music, especially on the weekend. It feels wonderful hearing to old classics being performed live by the band V5. The young lady singing main vocals made our day. The service staff are helpful, when choosing from the menu. Special mention goes to Debashish Bose, who helped us choose some fine dishes.

Chapter 2 offers retro dining. Situated at the top floor of Mani Square Mall they offer both Buffet and A-la-carte. I went there a few days back on my friend's birthday and we opted for the buffet option. The decor has been done so beautifully and a touch of class and Elegance can be found at every corner. For the starters there were Two types of soup,Chicken wings, Dry Chilly Fish,Corn Croquettes and Cheese Fried Potato. We loved the Dry Chilly Fish amongst them the most. For the main course there were Kashmiri Pulao,Murgh Irani,Burnt Garlic Friend Rice,Prawn Newberg,Chilli Garlic noodles,mixed halka Noodles,Mac and cheese and a chinese fish gravy item. Everything was good. Just I would be happier if it was a bit more hot. For deserts there were Plum Cake, Chocolate Mousse,Fruit custard,three types of ice cream,gulab jamun,darshan. They were good as well. Service is good and the staffs are effecient and friendly. Price is very reasonable.

Chapter 2 is one of the finest restaurants I have ever seen . My my last visit to chapter 2 was awesome one. Live karaoke band was amazing. The Ambience and the decor was very good the food was awesome and the stuffs we're courteous. There was a guy named Indranil who was very gentle and generous. Mr Shantanu was also very good. The ala - carte  and the buffet both were good. They have 21 main courses  in the Buffet .  drinks were awesome. You will not be disappointed if you come here but you will be if you go to  machan or hoppi Pola.

Chapter 2 is the last place I would recommend anyone to visit and I have pretty good reasons.
1.) Food quality is pathetic especially the Chinese 
2) If you go for buffet it's like going for treasure hunt you won't know where to start the food table is so disorganised.
3) There was this staff behind the buffet table his name was Indranil he is useless and of no help whatsoever infact he was extremely rude. I think you need proper decent well mannered staffs. 
4) Waiting for the bill is like waiting for snow to fall the service is so bad. And must say this Indranil only gives special attention to big groups the rest of the guest are treated as if we were eating free.
5.) The ambience decor and your Manager Mr.Santanu they need a thumbs up. 
6) The most disappointing thing was your live music your band which is supposed to be the main attraction of not only the restaurant but also the Mall. Such a shame the owner I heard is a renowned musician himself how could he have such a horrible  band or is he also of the same standard ? 
Im very disappointed and will never visit again.

Okay..Worst Buffet Ever !
I'll provide you reasons for my harsh conclusion -
1. It is awfully arranged..so you don't find the difference between where the starters end or the main course section begins (because they dont serve you the starters at the table and they also don't have the skill to divide the sections for the 3 courses)
2. The taste - Way below average. Some of the dishes were stale and most were pretty 'Road Side Rugged Cooked Dishes'
3. The space is small so you literally have to fight for your food to land on your plate.
4. Don't go for it's 'cheap' price tag because Haka serves you better at a cheaper rate.

Suggestion - Try any of the buffet zones on the same floor of Chapter 2. You won't be remotely as disappointed as you will be if you step here.

This place is renowned for offering one of the best low budget buffets in the city. The retro theme and live music are add-ons to the vintage feel of this restaurant.  Their buffet spans mainly Chinese and continental dishes, that taste okayish. However,they could make do with a welcome drink  and more choices in the dessert section.

Visited the place last Friday was really disappointed on seeing a bunch of young guys on stage and a girl who looked far from a singer she had on school pt shoes. They played everything but music the worse band I've ever heard. Sad the owner who I heard is a musician himself how could he have a band like that . People make changes for the better not for the worse. Your restaurant had become my regular hang but I don't think I will visiting it again till something is done about band as food is full and plenty in the mall. By the way food is also sub standard you get better Chinese on the road .

AMBIENCE-4/5
FOOD(Quality)-2.5/5 (Buffet)
FOOD(Quantity)- 5/5 (Buffet)
SERVICE- 4/5
VALUE FOR MONEY- Yes. (For the buffets)
RECOMMENDED- Yes.
The place is situated on the 4th floor of Mani Square along with other eateries such as - Haka, Machaan, Flame & Grill etc. Went there along with a friend for their lunch buffet on a weekday. We were a bit late(reached there at about 1:15 p.m.), but had no trouble getting seats. The place gives a very nice refined retro feel. But it might seem a little congested even when it is not entirely full, though the area is quite big. The best thing about the place was probably their bar, it looks magnificent. Now coming to the food:-
⚫️Soups- There was one veg which I did not try and one cream of chicken soup which was simply amazing. It was simple, creamy, flavourful and delicious. A treat to the taste buds.
⚫️Salads- There were two cold salads. One was chicken coleslaw salad which was non-veg which was average, and the veg one was probably Russian salad(I don't remember) which was creamy and amazing, really yumm!! And there was cucumber.
⚫️Starters- There was one vegetable something made with baby corn, beans etc and it was disgusting. Then there was one batter fried fish item which was really nice and delicious. I had like 4-5 of those. But some pieces were not done properly and the batter was uncooked and moist in some places in a few pieces. Next up there was chicken stroganoff and I personally disliked it like hell. It had this smell of some weird spice which put me off. The dry chilli chicken was tasty but nothing extraordinary. I liked the veg wontons too. They were crispy and tasty(probably the one veg dish that was decent).
⚫️Main course- The veg pilaf tasted disgusting. It had the same weird spice smell as the stroganoff. The egg chicken fried rice was not good either. The noodles were bland, dry and tasteless. The pasta was good. The prawn side dish was okayish. Its gravy tasted a lot like that of the pasta. We did not try the chicken side dish as we were already full. I don't remember if there was anything else.
⚫️Dessert- We had dessert twice. Once after the starters and then again in the end. There were slices of watermelon, darsaan (which I liked), slices of cakes (which were quite hard), some creamy mousse (not that good), fruit custard (average) and three types of ice-creams which we had to ask for as they were not there. Being a chocolate lover, I liked the vanilla ice-cream better.
The staff are attentive, well behaved and cordial. The manager himself asks everyone if they enjoyed. He even clicked a picture for us 😊.
Overall, nice place to be though I really wish they improve their main course dishes. The buffet is great, some items are really good plus the prices too are appreciable. But the veg items are pathetic (well, most of them).
They have increased the buffet prices since after 22.11.2017 as on that day we had the lunch buffet for 399+taxes which is now 499+taxes. They have 5% GST and no extra service charge or anything.
If you try the buffet, do not keep much expectations from the main course. Still, the place deserves credit for such a widespread buffet at such affordable rates. I do hope they improve. 😊

This is really a nice restaurant with live music option. The ambience is full of joy and cheerfulness. This is a retro themed restaurant. The decor is appropriate according to the theme. I opted for buffet. The quantity is sufficient but the taste is not really good as I expected. They do not have any gravy option for chicken. Less to no option for veg main course. But if you focus on the decor and all, good place to check in.

Went to this place earlier this month with friends. It was a Friday night and live music was being played at the restaurant. To be honest I quite liked the ambiance and the concept. We had opted for the buffet so had quite a few items to try from. Everything tasted good, but the highlight of the evening was the Fish Butter Fry from the starters. Even the prawn preparation from the main course was great. There was an option to request a song also and I did. However, my song was never player or performed :( Over all the experience was good. Definitely try this out once.

Despite being located on the top floor of the mani square mall it is quite easy to find as it can clearly be seen from the food court itself.

A pocket friendly restaurant with the taste of the food surpassing their price. Seems like a real joyful  place with its nice seats and awesome decor. 

From the moment u enter the restu , u will get e feel that they have taken their decoration very very seriously. On entering u will notice a nice little stage for band performances.

Coming to the food, they have both A la carte and buffet. We opted for A la carte will was real classy in taste as well as quantity. The service person were courteous too. Planning to visit again for their buffet.

Last week I was there for lunch on a friend's birthday party. If you are expecting to have a chicken or mutton curry on your dish for the buffet then definitely this is not the place. they just serves Chinese type of foods and if you like this type then yes will like the place. In our friend circle, one was vegetarian and she said me to mention that if you are a vegetarian then definitely this not the right place for you. and there was no music live at that time of lunch what we actually expect from a retro food place.  The food quality they serve is not to that mark but yes it was good especially the salads was good.

Located at the top floor of Mani Square Mall.This place was previously known a square 405.As the buffet bill had this name on it.
We reached sharp at 12.30pm only to find it closed.On enquiring we were asked to wait till 1pm.
We were a group of five people and went for the weekday lunch buffet.priced at 419rs.so our bill came to 2095rs only.
On entering the place you get a very retro dining kind of feeling.The bar section in front had this very big clock and the bottles adorning the wall....the lighting perfectly done for taking some great photographs and selfies!
We were offered the table nearest to the buffet.
First warning.please do not expect too much from the buffet because at this price point you actually cannot expect much.
So the buffet consisted of
4types of salads(chicken salad, Russian salad etc).
Nonveg starters (chicken wings,dry chilli chicken, chicken wantons etc.),
2types of soups
Mains(cheese pasta,chicken chowmein,egg chicken fried rice, chicken stroganoff,prawn in some white sauce,wok tossed vegetables,and some veg dishes which we didn't try)
Desserts (chocolate mousse,darsaan,3types of ice cream, custard,cake)
Now the cream of chicken soup was a total winner.we took two servings of it.So was the dry chilli chicken.the mains were good.
Except for the chicken stroganoff.i have no complains for any of the dishes.
One of us ordered The Long island iced tea priced at 425rs
Now the service.It was very prompt and friendly.Every item was served to us at the table.Even the manager himself came in to ask how the food was.
The decor was just awesome.
HappyEating!

Situated in Mani Square, this restaurant has a great ambience, a wonderful view and lip-smacking food. We went for ala-carte. The waiter was decent and helpful. We ordered devilled crab, grilled bhetki and prawn steak, chicken stroganoff , fresh lime soda and  blue berry blush. The crab was cooked perfectly. The taste was unique and different from the usual version, a bit on the spicier side. The steak was too good. The bhetki fillets were fresh and grilled to perfection. So were the prawns. The quantity though is for one person only. The stroganoff was delicious with delicately balanced flavours and ample quantity for one. The mocktail was true to its name. We will visit again to try the other items.

Came here to check out the very budget friendly buffet option. 
The best item would hands down be the mac n cheese. The rest of the foods were a little dull. The dessert was good though, nothing extraordinary but good enough.
But the very fact that they're providing a buffer in such a low cost earns them a +5. 
Retro styled interiors, with a band setup, the restaurant is indeed a lovely place to hang out at!

Chapter 2 was in my wishlist for long but somehow couldn't manage to go there...today atlast went there with my hubby for lunch before a movie date and I must proud of my decision as chapter 2 served a mouth watering lunch before us...we ordered chicken in bar b q sauce(which was not there in menu but recommended by the staff) and chicken tetrazini as main course...both the dishes were yummy and the portions were adequate for two...I was only disappointed with their fresh lime soda preparation..both the salty lime soda and sweet lima soda were too salty and sweet in test..when we told the staff about this they give us soda to adjust the taste which was a good gesture (though taste needs to be improved)...over all it was a good experience to have retro lunch with my loved ones

Chapter 2 really need to work on your Chinese food its pathetic I think the man selling on the road outside the mall makes better. Ambiance is great but i didn't like the rude behavior of one of the staffs Indranil you should seriously look into it or soon you will be having an empty restaurant. The buffet was average could be better but the Band is just awesome took us down memory lane with all the old retro and they even did songs like Despacito and shape of you for the young crowd just fantastic. Please keep up your standards.

Chapter 2 one of the most happening places for people like me music lover and a foodie visited it twice in the month of October and my last visit was on 10th November. Ambiance is mind blowing food is average service is not all that good but must compliment the band as they were just fantastic they played a birthday song which was really touching and played ever song we requested. Must say great idea to have such a seasoned and versatile band very obliging guys the main attraction of your restaurant.  Retro Theme with Retro music a must visit for every family.

Nice place..  Good buffet.. Starters are good.. Even main course is good only except the prawn & the chicken dish..  Chicken had a smell which reminded me of savlon.. Prawn certainly could have tested better.. Finally the desert was good though vanilla ice cream was not available.. Darsan was crispy.. Overall it was good fun.. I will do an injustice if I do not mention about the live Music.. With 'Last Christmas'  & 'Every Night' the singer made our evening.. I can easily let go those 2dishes..

Me and my team went there for a lunch. What we had was really appreciable. Great food with very good environment. Price is very much pocket friendly 399+5% GST. Food quality was really good. Variety of menu was there. Plenty of starters & main course with awesome deserts. Loved the place.

But only recommendation will be - if starters can be served at the table at the beginning then it will be much helpful.

And, rates of drinks are too high. If it can be cut off a bit then people will enjoy more.

As soon as u enter chapter 2 , ul have the feeling as if u have time travelled some decades earlier. Their arrangement for live music show is very good. Coming to the food part , there were many items present for the buffet. Starting form the soup to dessert everything was good. The fish and chicken items especially the fish batter fry was extremely good. For the main course their egg fried rice was best.  The dessert was good too. Fruit custard , strawberry pudding  was very tasty.

Ambiance wise great, however a little bit congested. Very small place to walk. Live music is the only benefit of this place. It can make your day as the song offerings are quite recent and retro feeling goes with the wind. Everything is great until you come to food. Vegans, for you this place is a strictly no-no. Only salads (that too in very limited varieties), starters are okeish. For non-veg there are 2-3 good options in starters and you have to savor your appetite with that only. Maincourse, again something gone wrong on earth. Very basic food, with no touch of excellence. Taste is something gone for a long vacation. Coming to deserts again mainstream with a struggling attitude trying to be average. Did I forget to mention the soup was good ? Never mind . Beginner's luck in my case I guess.

It's in mani square mall. Top floor. Opposite hoppipola. Locating it is easy. Not just because you know the mall..Even when you are inside you could hear the music playing from the floor beneath. And thats not just a music system..It's a live performance. Yes. That awesome..With old english songs and a few new ones its does wilfully ignite the party scene of the 70s and 80s park street with blue fox and mocambo doling out gala time in music. 
And then you order or hit the buffet. The buffet spread is not exciting save the starters. But when you go a la carte you find yourself downing in the bbq sauce of the chicken .. or amazing wine that smothers the duck(in the christmas week.) ..Or the tenderness of the steak. With cocktails and regulars to gulp your plateful with and great live music to make you groove ..You are expected to have an awesome feel. And i missed out quite intentionally on the half car decor which is on you to go and find out. 
I so expected it to be..But sadly its not friendly on the pocket. Well seldom good things come cheap.

If you wanna try out low priced buffet, then this is the place for you. The fish batter was lip smacking and the creamy chicken soup was also very good. I liked the coleslaw chicken salad as well. As for the desserts, there were ice creams, custards and chocolate mousse. I liked the mousse the most. The ambience was great and the staff were also polite. I would say, it was a good experience overall.

Tried Their 499 buffet Dinner once though they serve a lot of different dishes but non off them tasted outstanding except the chicken wings but at that point of price one should not expect something amazing so it was an okiesh experience for me...

We had come here based on a good word of mouth. On a Saturday night it was, and all they had then was a buffet. Frankly, we were not in a mood to eat so much but since that was all they had and the motivation based on the word of mouth was high, we dared it. Unfortunately, it didn't work out for us, the food was cold and very uninspiring. There was something very shabby about the presentation. Perhaps they are better with their a la cart menu. Another thing about this place ..... There aren't enough places with live music and I miss those days when we had more such places, places bold enough to have live music. Chapter 2 does and a pretty good one, the atmosphere of a restaurant simply transforms with the right kind of music. So, if you are at Manu square mall, you could try this place for yourself after a movie.

Went for a buffet lunch on Sunday afternoon. Situated on the top floor of Mani Square beside Haka. The buffet cost was Rs499+ tax. And we ordered fresh lime soda with this which costs Rs 100+tax. It was mainly a Chinese buffet. Food was above average and in their menu there were few types of soup, dry chili chicken, chicken wings, prawn, fish, pasta, noodles, fried rice and few types of salads. For the desert they had darshan, vanilla ice cream, Browney, custard etc. The service was good and there were live music as well. But the music was so loud, it was really creating some problem as we couldn't even talk. 
Overall average experience. There are many other places which serve better buffet spread considering the cost.

Finally had the opportunity to visit this restaurant yesterday. This place certainly has a retro thing going and it's classy to say the least. The restaurant is spacious and is very well decorated. On the walls were hanging figures of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe. The ceiling is also very nicely decorated. Chapter 2 also has a small stage where live music was being played. So the vibes we're at it's peak all throughout our lunch.

We went for the lunch buffet which was supposed to start at 12:30, so we were there before time but sadly the restaurant operations started almost 15 mins later. So maybe the punctuality aspect can be managed better. The lunch started with creamy chicken soup wish I thought was wonderful. I am not a big fan of soups yet I really enjoyed the thick creamy texture of the soup. In starters the dishes I enjoyed the most were the batter fish fry, dry chilli chicken and wantons. Of these three the batter fish fry was the best hands down. Special mention : the wantons were not of their usual shapes. There were 3 variants of pastas which to be honest was okayish.
In main course there were veg fried rice, egg-chicken noodles, chicken fried rice, prawns , chilli chicken and another chicken dish. I must say that the prawn dish just stole all the limelight. It was oozing with flavours and was marvellously cooked. The noodles too were really good. The rice too was great. But I thought it needed a gravy based dish to go with it.
Coming to dessert there was fruit custard, chocolate mousse, vanilla, strawberry and chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce, and darsaan. The dessert were really nice . However, the ice cream was not properly refrigerated, hence they were melting very fast. The staff did take responsibility for it but it was not the best of scenarios for dessert lovers.
The service was really good however being a full house, the servers had their hands full. Though all that rush was handled very nicely. So bonus points for that. Overall a good experience with this restaurant.

Today was my 29th birthday ( as same as Virat Kohli ) .  We were in Chapter 2 to celebrate this day. The restaurant is nicely decorated. It has cosy couches and comfortable chairs. There was a stage where live music was going to be held. As soon as we came inside ,  the staffs greeted me and told me to take a seat. They served us cake and streamers . The food was excellent. The staffs were the besties with thier courteousness .The live music, decor and ambiance was the icing on the cake. I would like to visit there again.

An evening well spent. The ambiance was mesmerizing. The decor is elegant, offers you a feel of old Park Street with a musical symphony. Staffs are genial and well mannered too.

We had the dinner buffet and the recipes were not exactly finger-licking, but palatable and worth the bucks you are going to spend. 

An awesome experience overall. Will be visiting again.

Today, my mother and I went to Chapter 2. It is located in the 4th floor of Mani Square. Accompanied by Hoppipola, Machaan, Haka, Flame & Grill and other restaurants, it first catches the eyes of a passer-by because of its magnificent decoration and ambience, that allures him to enter. We went for the lunch buffet. We were given a warm welcome by a waiter. After some rest, we were served the starters. They included creamy chicken soup, dry chilli chicken, vegetable wontons and beer batter fish (fish orly). They were all very good. Now coming to the main course there were different types of salads such as Russian salad, chicken salad and cucumber salad. All were lip-smacking. There were egg chicken fried rice, chicken noodles, veg au gratin, Prawn Newburg, chicken stroganoff, fish in garlic sauce and Pasta in white sauce. All were cooked to perfection. I was disappointed at the prawns. Although the dish was tasty, the prawns were not fully cooked and should have been softer to taste better. Coming to the dessert section, there were darsaan, fruit custard, plum cake, Baked Alaska, three types of ice creams and cut pieces of watermelon. The waiters were extremely courteous and discoursed with us like we were friends. One of them also narrated about the history of the restaurant's theme. Overall, it was a superb experience to be at Chapter 2. It costed Rs. 950 for 2. I would like to be there again in the near future.

This place, known for its retro themed deco, will surely attract people. It is usually busy, most tables remained occupied on weekday afternoons as well. Having heard a lot about this place for its buffet, we decided to order the dishes a la carte instead.

We had ordered lamb peppered steak, and grilled chicken. They were disappointing, had nothing special in it to offer.  The only good thing seemed to be its dessert. We had ordered baked alaska. It was a unique tasting one.

The service was average. Having assumed that most people came for buffet, they took a pretty long time to bring the menu. They seemed reluctant when we made gestures to them, for taking our order. It was a very average experience at the place.

Situated on the top floor of Mani Square, this place was in my wishlist. Visited there twice, once for buffet and another for casual dining. So the points are:
FOOD- On the first day we had Chicken Tetrazzini,  Chicken Stroganoff and Chicken Steak. The food quality was too good but quantity did not satisfy us. On the second day we went for the buffet. That day the foods tasted not so great. The Russian salad and the Pasta in white sauce were good among the items,  desserts were ordinary. Keeping the price of buffet in mind, we were nearly satisfied.

SERVICE- We are very much disappointed by the service. On the first day we ordered for gerlic bread. After half an hour one of them came and told us about the unavailability of the item and we  canceled the order for gerlic bread. But after 15-20 mins they showed up with the gerlic breads. Then they asked me to take it although our dining was about to finish. So we refused to take that. 
On the second day none was coming for the order and after calling  several times one of them came. He was not  listening properly. Even for water we have to ask for 4-5 times! That guy told us that the starter will be served by them and he did the same. After that when we asked for repeatation of some items in starters, another guy came and informed in buffet they will not serve anything and it's entirely self service. We didn't understand how the waiters are not aware about the rules of the restaurant! 
The good thing is the glass of water they served was full of dirt and after informing they changed it and served free welcome drinks for us.

AMBIANCE- It's is quite good. The retro look is beautiful. There was live music.

Chapter 2 throws us back to the retro days of Park Street. Many of us in this generation might not have gone through that era but Chapter 2 rekindles those days with their generous effort. Live music on the ramp, servers wearing bobby print style dress of 70's with golf cap will remind you many 70's classics Bollywood movies.
Restaurant is always full and busy so expect to wait if you are reaching without any reservation. We ordered for Beckti Lemon Grilled and Prawn Risotto. The fish was fresh and rightly grilled with hint of lemon to infuse freshness, served with perfectly cooked butter garlic rice and sautee vegetables. Risotto was mind blowing, perfectly cooked with garlic and prawn leaving it with a buttery texture. 
In desserts we ordered Baked Alaska and Cheese Cake. I had high hopes about Baked Alaska but the Cheese Cake turned out to be the winner. The cake has topping of fresh cheese just melts in your mouth and leaving a sweet memory. Service is tad slow but servers are extremely professional, courteous and patient.

Have already visited this place a fair number of times, and this is my first review. Located at the top floor of the Mani square mall, this gives quite a competition to the pubs and restaurants surrounding it. Buffet at only 399 on weekdays, it's a massive attraction with the hakas just round the corner. The ambience is better than most places I have been too at Kolkata, and the service is decent too. However , if you are there for drinks or food other than buffet, it might cost you a fair amount of money!

This place was in my wish list for a long time but finally got to pay a visit a few months back. It was the occasion of good friday as well as Dr. B. R. Ambedkar’s birthday so inspite of being a weekday the  buffet price went up to 499+ taxes.  Nevertheless, we had a prior booking and it was mentioned clearly during the booking that we want a corner peaceful place to seat but they had reserved a place which was on the middle of the row. But they were kind enough to change it when we requested them for another place.

Now coming to the food, there were about 21-22 dishes. So ok guys this restaurant doesn’t offer 21 “course” meal.  No restaurant in kolkata as well as India offers 21 course meal. There are 21 dishes which are food items but are not separate courses.

The place is well decorated and pretty big. There is a place where they play live music but unfortunately there was no performance on my visit during lunch. The ceiling had amazing lamp work and the bar counter on one side looked pretty classy with the figures on the wall. It was really very appealing. 
Now to begin with there were 4 types of salad –  Vegetable Coleslaw , Russian Salad, kimchi and something else as well. I tried none of them so can’t comment on that but my fellow foodie tried the russian salad and he loved it. 
Then there were 2 kinds of soups- one veg and one non- veg.  The non- veg soup was Chicken spinach soup and the veg soup was Hot & Sour soup. We tried the non-veg soup. It didn’t look good to be honest and there were particles in it and it lacked spinach. But it tasted real good. It was packed with a lot of nice flavours so thumbs up to the soup.

Coming to the starters there was Kung Pao Veg, Chicken Manchurian Dry, Batter fried fish and Chicken wanton fried.

Kung Pao veg was ok-ish. The Chicken Manchurian Dry was amazing. It had all the right flavours and the chicken balls were melt in the mouth. The Batter coated fried fish was also good. The quality of the fish was superior and the flavours were good as well. Now coming to the Chicken wanton fried, the filling tasted good but it lacked the shape of an wanton. The filling was kind of put inside a rolled up wanton which wad twisted at the end. It was ok-ish.

Now coming to the main course, there were so many options like way too many both veg and non-veg. There were Chilli Schezwan Prawns, a Chicken dish with green gravy, Paprika Chicken, Egg Chicken Noodles, Egg Chicken fried rice, Macaroni in cheesy white sauce, Tomato Basil spaghetti, Herbs &  Butter rice. 

The prawns were of very good quality but me being a fan of Maa er hather chingri malaikari doesn’t enjoy prawns in any chinese sauce based gravy. So this dish was not quite appeal to me. 

The chicken with the green gravy tasted amazing and it went really well with both the herbs and butter rice and the egg chicken fried rice. The gravy had flavours of corriander and lemon and it was a bit tangy. It was really really good.

Now coming to the Paprika Chicken, the dish looked amazing. But I didn’t quite like the favour because the gravy tasted too much of tomatoes.

The cheesy white sauce pasta was the best. It was flavoursome and had the perfect balance of everything. It had all the right flavours for a pasta lover to enjoy.

The tomato basil spaghetti was good if not great. It was packed with flavours of tomato and the basil just enhanced that flavour.

The herm and butter rice was a disaster. It didn’t have any flavour of butter nor did it have any flavour of herbs. The herbs tasted burnt and it was very bad.

The desserts comprised of a mango pudding, mousse, darshaan and choices of ice cream with chocolate  sauce. 
I tried the mousse. As I am not a big fan of mousses, so it was kind of ok to me. The darshaan was good. And the most appreciable part is the way they were serving the ice creams. There were this cute little bowls to hold a scoop or two of ice creams and it not only looked good but also made the eating process easier.

So overall the food was good but nothing special.

Now coming to service, the stewards were very polite and well behaved. But there is a lack on the part of management. The place is pretty big but it lacks the number of stewards and other staffs needed to manage the entire place. As a result of which the service seemed slow even though there was no fault of the steward because they were trying really very hard to manage everything and everyone’s table. It took them years to take the soup bowl, then the starter plate and the main course plates.

Another thing which I didn’t like was the unavailability of a soup bowl liner and a starter plate. We had to take the starters on a big main course plate. Though we took another for taking the main course but unavailability of a starter plate is not expected from a place like Chapter 2.

I would like to come back to the place to try out some preparations from their À la carte menu but would not try the buffet again. ☺️

We went there on friday . It was a nice experience. I had a nice and a cheaper meal than I had in food court in my previous visits or in hakka or hoppipola. The staffs were courteous and kind. The buffet had a lot of varieties. There were many delicacies like chicken stroganoff, prawn in hot garlic sauce etc. The drinks were truly great. The live performance was the icing on the cake. I would like to visit there again and again.

Visited Chapter 2 today for a family lunch over their 21-course buffet. The decor is nice and gives the place a retro feel. A live music stage is icing on the cake, wherein you can listen to retro English numbers and you can even request for your fav songs. Coming to the food, the buffet had 3 types of salads, boiled vegetables, fried wantons, beer batter fried fish and dry chilli chicken. The main course had pasta, noodles, fried rice along with prawn, fish and chicken preparations as side dishes. The desert section had fruit custard, chocolate brownie, mousse, watermelon and ice cream (4 variants). Food was overall nice but the pasta and the beer batter fried fish were excellent and deserve special mention. The staff were very courteous and friendly. Overall a very satisfying experience.

•Food is delicious.
•Non veg buffet is available at a very affordable price.
•Easy to locate (top floor of Mani square).
Lows:
•A la carte is a little overpriced.

Located on the top floor of Mani square , this place will leave you awestruck by its catchy decor . This retro themed restaurant with a music arena , polka dotted walls with good music will fill you with all positive vibes. The waiters are also dressed like the 90's. So we decided to have buffet there which was really a mistake.
The starters were not bad , infact I liked the chicken preparation pretty much. The main course was horrible. The food was very cold , the fish was extremely sweet , the prawn was under cooked. The chicken stroganoff was again very bland and the mac and cheese as well. Next we opted for the desserts which were again good except for the brownie which was very hard.
Again I was extremely dissapointed with their stuff's behaviour who actually gave us the bill before we finished the food at 3:15 p.m. when the buffet was till 3:30 p.m. The overall bill was 942 inclusive of tax for 2 which is really cheap for a buffet. But hated their hospitality and food , never going to show up again.

A quick visit after movie..it was 10:15p.m and we tried Chapter2. Nice ambience. We ordered Chicken Grilled, Chicken Tettrazini and Creame Chicken Soup as suggested by the front server. Chicken Soup was very delicious so do the Chicken Tettrazini but the girlled chicken were not good at all. Chicken were not fresh and must be an old frozen chicken they cooked. They also didn't have the beer. The Front server and the supervisor or manager, were very polite and were taking care of the service really well. 
But if they dont want to serve alcohol/beer after say 10pm or something, they should mention that in front of the entry. "No Alcohol will be served after 10PM because we have to wrap up and go home quickly"

Food - We ordered for cream of chicken soup, cream of crabmeat soup, prawn cocktail, chicken hawaiian salad, chicken tetrazinni, grilled fish and prawn steak, pork chops and caramel custard.
Mention worthy are the steak and the soups. But all the items were truly delicious.

Ambience - It’s a very cool place with very nice decor. The entrance, sitting area, buffet area and the top floor. All are well decorated. There’s a separate place for live music. We heard Mr. Carlton Perrera performing.

Service - Good service.

Rate - Goes with the excellent food!

In one word. Excellent. The place's decoration will blow your mind and they have really pulled off their retro theme both with their attire as well as music. We tried a few dishes. The pork ribs deserves special mention as it was out of this world. The gypsy beef roast was okayish, probably you should go with the tenderloin steak. The lemon grilled beckti is A+. Special mention goes to all the staffs and definitely Mr. Carlton(If I got his name right) for singing some of my favourite songs from the 60s and the 70s.

Heard about this place quite a few times so wanted to visit . Finally visited last Sunday night ambience was good ,live band played not much crowded though. We asked for suggestions on what to order from the F&B guy. We went for Ala carte soup he suggested cream of chicken which is the winner of all the 3 dishes that we ordered. Then we had the grilled chicken but chicken seemed dry & frozen.Another good dish was the Chicken Tetrazzini.Quantity wise taste wise we were full.But although they had beer on the menu but wasn't serving or may be didn't have it in the stock that night which is thumb's down. otherwise good place , would like to visit again.

Few of the staff members were actually confused with what to serve or not ..this needs to be improved ... Overall it was good ..you can give it a try ...

A great time spent here today on a friends bday treat .
We opted for the buffet section .
The foods were quite tasty and good according to price . I specifically liked the chicken cream soup and the chicken wings and the custard .
They didn't had any beer , gin , brandy stock . Don't know why . We ordered for the old monk rum & ultra . The deserts were good my friends told me they loved the icecream . The bar design is the best bar decor I ever seen.
So if you want a good buffet in cheap rate u should visit here .

This was on my bucket list for a long time. So at last reached there with family for a weekday lunch. Though it was a weekday the place was getting a steady footfall.. First lets talk about the ambiance.. It had a retro feel.. With waiters dressed in polka dot shirts... Marilyn monroe and Elvis prisley on the walls, a cadillac as a bar counter and colourful chairs.. Now for the food.. The buffet is really cheap.. Rs399. But usually buffets provide very ordinary fare... So decided to go a la carte. We placed our orders and sat down to wait. It was a long wait. And the juniormost member got tired of it and went for the buffet.. According to him and what we saw the food was very tasty. He hated his tiny chocolate cake(dry could not swallow) and loved the pudding. Now to the a la carte.. Starters.. Devilled crab and prawn cocktail. Liked both but had tasted better stuff elsewhere. Then arrived our mains.. Lamb chops... Delicious, irish lamb stew.. A thick lamb gravy dark in hue.. Again a winner but not the accompanying rice..another dish we had ordered on the waiter's insistence beckti newburg.. A cheesy dish but yummy. The mocktails.. Berry berry blush and mojito were fine.

I even saw the manager shouting at a kid asking him to sit properly, he was very rude. Staff should learn to behave with the customers properly

After Mughlai and Chinese delicacies the same group came up with Continental platters. Yesterday We had a birthday party there with family/friends. The ambience, the decor is ideal for family get together, the live music mainly the rock-n-roll of the 60's-70's went well with the ambience. Coming to the food, buffet had a reasonable number of items. The quality of food was good with exception of fish item and noodles. Chicken wings as the starter was really good. The deserts had very limited items out of which "Fruits Custard" was good. The staffs are very welcoming and courteous so the overall experience was good. Will recommend.

We went there to celebrate bijaya Sammi land. We choose weekdays buffet launch. The Russian salad and chicken salad were so good. Both are prepared with mayonnaise. Then come the chicken cream soup. The soup was so tasty and I think it was the best dish. Then come the starter which were fish and chicken wings. Both were nice and juicy. Now come to the main course. Egg Chowmin and prawn preparation were more than OK type. The fish preparation also ok type but I was disappointed with the chicken preparation. Also egg fried rice so dal type. Nothing to say. In the desert section they serve pudding, brownie, ice cream, darshan with chocolate sauce, water melon and chocolate moose. Brownie and darshan were so good, rest were ok. 
We spent very good times at there. From 1.30 to 4 pm. One thing I did not like it, that is when I just eat ice cream, they put the bill and after 5 minutes they came with card punching machine. They could not wait until I finish my lunch. The time was 3.45 pm. It look like pay now and leave plz. They should change that kind of behavior with the customer. For that kind of behavior, I never want to go there in near future. We are the customer, not beggars.

Place is good. We opted a lunch buffet, which is @399+tax. The rate is cheaper, compare to other buffet corner in Kolkata. The food was based on continental & Chinese types. 
There were 2 types of soups, veg & non veg
3 types of starter, 1 veg & 2 non veg
2 types of rice
1 types of noodles & 1 types of pasta
2 types of gravy item, including chicken & veg
3 types of desert
Including ice cream
Overall ambiance, food was good but not too much attractive, ..
Starter was too simple , specially non veg starter & also desert section.
Overall restaurant is average. They provide one compulsory drink, which is good. 
From the sight of price, the restaurant is good.

One of the gems in Kolkata that serves lovely continental food amidst an equally lovely ambiance.... we had prawns on toast (my fav at this place), prawn cocktail, pork chop, tenderloin steak, grilled fish in lemon butter sauce and rissoto- all of it were just perfect. The tenderloin cooked to perfection, the pork chop with just the right amount of fat and succulent, the fish just melts in your mouth. I ended it with caramel pudding and i am already yearning to go there again. But this time i would go there for dinner in a weekend so that i dont miss out on the live music. Their mojito also deserves a special mention. On my request they made it with soda instead of sprite and it was absolutely refreshing!!

A much awaited place. So we stepped there in at saptami eve. The manager told us to wait at the top section. There were so much people waiting to dine in. But we noticed some management issues. Some people came after us and others but got the seats as told by the manager. Still we hoped for the best and kept on waiting. After waiting for more than 30 mins, they called us. Another thing, Actually we planned to have a la carte. Even the menu was also there. But nobody dined in as a la carte. Everyone was trying buffet. Don't have crystal clear idea about that maybe for festival issues there was buffet only. Doesn't mattered too much, but at least they should give an update on Zomato for this. And we even tried to call them before one day but the line was crap.😂
Okay now come to foods. There are lots of options. From bell paper salad, fish tikka, prawn in sauce, mutton curry and railway chicken curry, egg noodles and fried rice and lots on mains. Pasta macaronis in white sauce were there too. Every items are so so. Only the mutton curry seemed best for me. But no item had Such uniqueness. The desserts were too much fab. We liked the mango pudding 🍮 and vanilla pudding with chocolate sauce on it.
The Main usp was the live performance. It was such a nice experience to listen retro tracks while dining ❤. But the foods could be better. The place disappointed us as the expectations were too much high from this place. This was the last restaurant of Mr. Debaditya Chaudhary which was on our wish list for a while. His place never dissatisfied us, expect this😞 even the prices are on higher side comparing to foods.😒
Thumbs up only for the subtle decor, the live performance and desserts.

We went there on Muharram...so unfortunately the bar was closed..and now I feel more proud to write this review as I come to know that this place is owned by one of my school friends from South Point..we ordered
STARTERS: Prawns Cocktail
MAIN COURSE: Gypsy Beef Roast
DESERTS: Pannacotta

All the food had nice taste..specially the Prawns Cocktail was yummy. The beef roast was also nicely cooked. The Pannacotta yummy..but since the place is not large the music sometimes is too loud..overall nice experience..would love to explore their other items next time..

Sometime back me along with my partner visited the place. We opted for the lunch buffet and were really excited to taste the 21 delicacies. The starters weren't served on the table, so we served ourselves. The salads were amazing. Then came the starters - chicken in  garlic sauce, prawn and steamed fish. The texture of the food was good but the chicken was a a bit more salted. The main course looked impressive but the taste was highly disappointing. The rice was over cooked and spaghetti was less cooked. The pasta was good in taste but the white sauce tasted like flour gravy. The worst drawback was the service of the staff. There wasn't proper service of water neither was there any complimentary drink. The freshlime that we ordered was average in taste. The staff had to be called repeatedly to clear the plates and there was shortage of ice-cream. The only good thing was the ambience of the place. @

Thats as much as i can provide to chapter 2 for my experience. We had visited on sosthi eve of durga puja. As usual there was not much crowd at the beginning and the ambience was well anticipated but their food is a miss i would say. We ordered a bhetki dish and pork chops. Unfortunate to say but both were a dissapointment to us. Pork dish had hardly any meat on it amd the bhetki dish waw full of cheese. Only the live music was somewhat of a saviour and we got seats immediately that part. Another point to mention was their order taking time. We literaly waited for close to 20-25mins just for someone to place order, let alone the time taken for them to be delivered. Thats all from Chapter 2

This had been on my bucket-list for a long long time. It was finally on dashami that I decided to visit to the place and settled in on the mouth watering buffet on offer @699 + Tax. 
Decor: 4/5
Ambiance: The band was playing English classics. Great stuff. 5/5
Staff: Friendly, greeted us well and recommended the buffet over the a-la-carte. 4/5
Food: The buffet was tremendous VFM. Here are some honorable mentions: 
1. Mac n cheese: Very cheesy and good to taste. Perfect mild flavour of the garlic in the sauce. 
2. Veg au gratin: Lots of veggies in a white sauce, had ample cheese. 
3. Portuguese prawn: One of the favorites. The sauce had a little coconut flavour(very Goan-ese) with a rich in garlic, had mushrooms and a hint of the tomato. 
4. Pan fried fish: Not very great. Had a decent taste. 
5. Barbecue chicken wings: cooked decently well. 
6. English mutton curry: the best of the lot. The BEST. Never had such soft succulent mutton everrrr. It was so tender and easily chewable. It was not too spicy, very good to taste. Tremendous stuff. 
7. Moose, custard: Okayish. Noting to write home about.

Liked the place very much. Will definitely visit again.

I went there with my friends to have our grand Durga Puja lunch on Navami. I have heard a lot of good things about this place previously, so the desire to come here was always there. However, when we left the place, we were thoroughly disappointed.
We initially went in to have a la carte, but came to know that they are only serving buffet during the festive season . The items on the buffet menu looked fine but as far as taste is concerned, they were average to say the least. There was nothing delicious about any of the preparation. The mutton dish was undercooked and it almost tasted like raw meat. The starters and desserts were anything but great. Only the chicken preparation was worth repeating. Given the quality of the food, the buffet is surely overpriced.It may be the case that the quality has deteriorated because of the rush that goes on during the Puja season. The people who were serving also looked to be in hurry of getting done with the current lot of people who were eating so that the people waiting can get in. I sincerely hope the restaurant looks into taking their food and service quality a notch higher. I would like to give it another shot afterwards at some point of time, and I wish that experience will be the opposite of what I have had during my first visit.

Not at all recommendable if you are a foodie. Other then the music nothing was good. Food was cold and not worth of the cost. Very less number of starters. Most important is if you are going with a group then only plan for chapter 2, otherwise you would not be served with water till end. Staff were not able to manage the rush. Not a single item was tasty. Full money waste. Will Never visit again.

I have just finished my MahaNabami lunch in chapter 2 . Excellent decor set the mood for the retro dining . And oh boy the food was nice . The  spaghetti with balls were delicious . THE LIVE MUSIC WAS THE MAIN ATTRACTION OF CHAPTER 2. THE ENGLISH SONGS WERE AWESOME . With one pint of beer it was comparatively cheap @725  . One should visit there once .

Just finished a fantastic Nobomi buffet lunch here. Very reasonable too @ 850 per person. A mix of conti & Anglo dishes & all items are equally good. Anglo style liver fry, prawn, mutton vindaloo, Anglo Indian polao & veg gratin were really special. Overall a fresh taste among countless below average festive feasts. This Chapter is a five starrer all the way. Keep it up. Will be back soon.

Very less number of starters. Only good thing was live music. We just spoiled our Navami lunch. Repenting on our decision of choosing this restaurant. 

Not recommended for people who value money.

Went there on Saptami for Lunch Buffet, waited around 15mins which wasn't too much obviously. Their menu seemed to be fine but too less of starters. After entering the first thing which struck me was the place was smelling fish, the ac's weren't working properly. Coming to the food, they had a chicken and a fish starter, all the fish peices were broken and the chicken was too salty. For main course they had prawns which were good enough. Fish was fine. Mutton vindaloo wasn't up to the mark, the pieces of mutton weren't fine. Chicken railway curry had too much flavor of rosemary killing all the tastes. The noodles they had was tasteless so as the rice. There was a tofu preparation which actually was paneer so a great scam. For desserts they had brownies which were harder than marble i suppose? Pannacotta tasted like elaichi kheer. Fruit custard was so so.
I would definitely not visit this place again. I wouldn't never want to spend 850 bucks for this kind of a below standard buffet. So instead of going here go for Haka, Machaan, Flame and grill of Mio Amore but surely not this.

Great thing that attracts people to this place is its food quality and its ambience. Foods and Drinks are no too costly in this place. It's quite affordable for a layman like us. Buffets have many different preferences like desserts, starters, main course, side dish.

I'm a music lover a regular at Trincas and Someplace Else when i noticed your band from outside the restaurant as we were planning to visit Flame and Grill we decided to check out your restaurant and boy oh boy it was really worth it. Your price is moderate the food is good not excellent but what blew me away was the live band i still cant believe it they played such lovely retro music i tried to trick them by giving them a Pink Floyd request and they even played that such a versatile band just amazing. I have informed all my friends and family about chapter 2 so we will be visiting it more often now. And what amused me the most is the band even sang an anniversary song for a couple which i think is really sweet. I highly recommend this wonderful hang out place for friends and family.

A quick visit after movie..it was 10:45 p.m. and all of the eateries were not taking new orders and we took a chance for Chapter2.Beatuful ambience and decor will mesmerize you instantly.But they were also not taking orders as kitchen closes at 10:30 p.m.As we were preparing to head out Mr Suresh asked as to wait and with in 2 minutes he assured us that we will be served,only grilled items won't be available.We ordered Chicken Paprika, Chicken Stoganoff and Beckti Meuniere as suggested by him. We were served with complimentary Cream of chicken soup and then came the main course. Each and every item was very delicious. Thanks C2,we will definitely visit again.

This place is located on the 4th Floor of Mani Square, right next to Hoppipola and Haka. The place has a awesome ambiance, with live music playing soft rock / romantic numbers , and when the live performance is paused , you get to hear an equally good set of music tracks that don't eat into your conversation, but give you that good feeling that you came here for in the first place ! The staff here are extremely attentive and courteous, and the service is fairly quick . The food here is amazing! The buffet seems to be the more popular choice for the family crowd, but their a la carte menu is always ready to be cooked to perfection, so do give it a try ! The meat lasagna they make tastes absolutely heavenly, and has thick layers of well cooked lamb under a generous dose of cheese , served with 2slices of garlic bread. The pork vindaloo here is amazing as well, with pieces of pork cooked in a thick spicy gravy of onions and garlic , and served with a portion of jeera rice on the side. The grilled chicken has mashed potato on the side , and tastes great too! The chicken steak in mushroom sauce tastes amazing, and has caramelised onions, mashed potatoes, and boiled vegetables on the side. The roast mutton with mint jelly has a hint of sweetness , and the mutton steak is well cooked and worth a try . The pork ribs here taste great , though the pork has enough fat so it's difficult to handle with fork and knife! They make decent cocktails , with enough punch in a glass of old fashioned, and mint overtures in their deep sea. The place is a must visit , if fine dining is your thing , and good music makes food that much tastier for you!

I'm a regular guest at barbeque nation salt lake but on hearing that your restaurant had a live band so we decided to visit on Friday the 8th Sept
it was really worth it . The ambience is mind blowing the female crooner was brilliant and the music just awesome. But I think your Chinese food needs to be improved. Over all experience was really good.

Went there to have a first experience and it was not half bad. The theme is retro as the name suggests and decor and ambience is pretty cool and appealing. 

There was live music when we went and the occasion was durga puja so it had a nice tune to it ✌️

Food was quite good. We had buffet and it didn't dissapoint much but at the same time it was neither too extraordinary. The buffet menu had chinese and continental mixed although i favoured chinese more and more of it. There were 3 kinds of pasta/spaghetti of which one I had and it was good. Chinese was pretty usual and tasty just like any dedicated chinese restaurant. They had 4 kinds of starters of which a chicken dish was particularly a treat to me. In desserts they had two flavours of ice cream alongwith a souffle. 

Overall it was a good experience. It was pocket friendly to some extent given the kind of food we had. Its a good place for lunch or dinner.

Such a great ambience I got to see here at this place today. yes but i would have loved this if the place wasn't so clumsy..

Chapter 2 got 3/5 as per my review.

Food: 2/5 the food was awful (considering the buffet only). The wanton chicken fry,chicken wings and the shrimp curry were the worst of the lot. In the desert section the cake I tasted couldn't be wprse than this. The chocolate syrup topping was liquid as water. Rollick ice creams they serve which is again a negativ mark for them.
Waht I liked was white sauce chkn. Chkn soup. The sea fish dish and the flavoured mousse.

Ambience 3.5/5 I couldn't give more because the place wasn't spacious enough to have a musical ambience.

Staff were wearing some pop kinda attire.english songs were all around while they didn't understand english.theu rather preferred to communicate in bengali only. They were well mannered though..@

Anyway a good experience to have..

A retro style restaurant that offers great continetal dishes.
The ambience is very lively with all the good live music and stuff.
They also have a buffet spread but we tired the ala carte rather that day
We had Chicken Ala Kiev, Chicken steak in peper sauce, Mutton lasagna and Pork Ribs.
Loved the lasagna It was the best among the four.
The Ala kiev was good but the butter content inside was little, It could have used some more butter.
The steak and the ribs were delicious but not on of the best ribs or steak l had.
So Ill suggest you to try the lasagna for sure the other items could have been better.
The dessert was pretty yummy!! Brownie with ice cream! 😁😁

This place has an outstanding ambience, the live music was the best part out of the entire setting. Moreover the staffs were extremely courteous and friendly! But the food could have been better, starters tasted better than the main course to be precise. I loved one prawn item in particular. The buffet is definitely recommended but I hope they experiment more with the menu and try and improve the taste. The buffet price is pretty reasonable, we went for the weekday dinner buffet and the bill was 1178 rs for two.

It was an unplanned dinner we were planning to go to Hakka but after checking the menu which was listed outside, we dropped the plan and then one of the staff of Chapter 2 invited us and explained about the buffet. So I thought of giving a shot and believe me I made the right decision. It was fabulous experience. I mean come on who serves delicious food with live music in such an affordable price. I loved it! Everything was perfect, the decore, ambience, staffs,food n live music. Food needs more variety that's all! Recommended

This restaurant has been on my bucket list since a very long time. Finally we made it and we loved our experience there. It is a beautifully decorated restaurant with a nice vintage vibe going on. There's a stage for live performances. The interiors are done up well and the ambience is awesome. Service is good. The staff is cordial and welcoming. We tried their weekday buffet lunch which cost us 471 AI. The dishes served in the buffet were 2 soups(veg and non veg), assorted salads(veg and non veg), dry chilli chicken, fish butter fry, chicken wontons and crispy okra for starters, 2 types of pasta, one chicken, one fish and one prawn gravy, veg gravy, 2 types of rice and 1 noodles for main course and strawberry mousse, pudding, pastry and ice creams for desserts. The quality and taste of the dishes are really good and the prices are a steal deal. Overall, highly recommended.

We went for this overhyped restaurant because we didnt find a seat in Hoppypola and also wanted to try the food at a reasonable buffet price of 590. To our great dissapointment the food was as bland as the worn up band people of the restaurant(they have an inhouse band which noone seems to listen to). The starters were cold. The wanton had no meat in it,only good amount of maida. The pasta literally tasted of maida. Dessert was so so. Some of the staff behaviour also sucked. The AC was so low that we were literally sweating. Never plan to go there again.

We normally visit Barbeque Nation salt lake  for its main attraction live band but this time we decided to visit chapter 2 as the guys who use to play there were performing at chapter 2. It was a reunion with all my old school friends on the 3rd Sep . Must say the food service and staffs are excellent and to add to it all the live band which was the main reason for our visit. The Band was just superb they had us on our feet we danced like crazy the singer sang all our request. We went up and spoke to the band and thanked them when we were done must say very decent and humble musicians. A must visit for every family i strongly recommend.

As soon as you enter this place you are surrounded with bright lights, colorful seats and amazing live music! The steaks here are superb! We tried the Grilled Bhetki & Prawn Steak and the classic Pork Chop. The Pork Chop is a must try for all pork lovers. The Bhetki grill has a pungent flavour of lemon but tastes great. The mashed potato and the stir fried veggies serves as a great combination with these dishes.
Just hop in, grab a great seat and enjoy the food with the great live music. And what's more fun is that it's pocket friendly!

This restaurant is a sister unit of Oudh 1590. We went there with a group of friends. We opted for the buffet lunch. The ambience was good with music playing and courteous staff. In starters, there were a few veg and non veg items. In salad, there were quite a few options. The main course was okayish. The desserts were yummy. Overall it was a good experience. I would definitely recommend this place as a hang out with friends and filling meal at a reasonable price.

There were many delicacies like chicken stroganoff , prawn in hot garlic sauce etc. The drinks were truly great.  The live music was the icing on the cake. I would surely like to visit there again.☺

Why do we visit a restaurant? For food, for get together. I go for the feel-good factor. The manager of this restaurant, Santanu Bhattacharya, took care of that.
We went there in a group and were treated like queens. The staff were at their toes for us. And the buffet lunch, we relished every morsel.
Heavenly feelings like this doesn't come very often. I highly recommend others to join here.
Looking forward to the Anglo Indian spread they are planning during Pujas.
Price moderate. Parking no problem.

I visited this place yesterday and first thing that attracts me was the interior. This place has been given a retro look with live band. Now about food, we choose buffet. Food is tasty specially non veg items.For vegetarians this is not the right place cos they have very few item in buffet. Starter 4/5, Main course 3.5/5 cos rice was not cooked properly .
Will definitely recommend friends to visit but only non-vegetarians.

It's one of the cheapest and best buffet places in the city, located in Mani square mall opposite Haka, it has a retro environment. I loved the ambience. Coming to the food, I would say it's awesome, starting from salads to the desserts. I loved their chicken cream soup and one of their chicken starters (whose name I've forgotten). There were 4 more starters. All of them  was very very good. The main course comprised of 2 types of fried rice, chicken noodles, 2 types of pasta. Side dishes comprised of fish, prawn, chicken. Among desserts it had the typical darshan, mousse, custard, pastry, 3 types of ice cream.
I loved this place and would recommend it to anyone.
The staffs were also very cooperative and I would definitely visit Chapter 2 again 👍

An amazing combination of beautiful ambience, appetizing cuisines and good service. The live band performance adds an extra flavour to the mood.I won't say it's a pocket friendly restaurant but some of the dishes are worth the expenses. If you're a food fanatic and looking for a good place to give your taste buds a treat, I'd suggest you try -
1.Irish lamb stew
2. Chicken Carbonara
3. mushroom risotto
4. Spaghetti Bolognese
5. Baked alaska of this restaurant.
Happy food! ☺

A special day requires special celebration. And in my opinion, this day when we became  Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP)s deserves to be cherished with a special treat for us! 😋 That's how we landed in Mani Square's Chapter 2.
The location is great, the food was great, the stuffs were very courteous. We were enquired throughout our dining session how was the food, whether we liked it, are we comfortable with the restaurant environment and the list goes on. All the stuffs were very careful hosts and eager to help.
This was an afternoon when finally we got a break from our busy schedules and could literally "relax"! Above all, the music! Ronan Keating singing "It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.." when tasty chicken wantons are getting crusted in my mouth with a sexy crunch... and the tasty egg chicken fried rice makes a beautiful combo with the prawn curry. The main courses were not upto the mark of the starters and deserts, but it was good nonetheless.
And when we checked the bill, were utterly shocked... all those mouth melting fruit custards and ice creams and Darsuns and chicken and fish and so on at just Rs. 1199/-!
Great, isn't it? Tons of hanks to Chapter 2, for making such a nice memory for us, to cherish for the days to come! 😊

So finally visited the place after keeping it bookmarked over a long period. Contrary to my expectations, the place wasn't big enough. At most 15 families/groups can fit in at one time. Placed opposite Haka in the Mani Square Mall, the place has been given a retro look.

Visited on a Sunday Afternoon and tried their weekend buffet lunch. It was okayish. Lacked the wow factor. Biggest Turn Off was the loud live music that was being played by an artist. It was very loud considering the size of the place which rendered it difficult to strike a conversation with person on the other side of the table.

Coming to the food:

1. Salads - Nothing out of the ordinary. 2/5
2. Veg soup - Did not try.
3. Cream of Chicken Soup - Good to taste. 4/5
4. Crispy fried Vegetables - Fried to perfection. 4/5
5. Dry Chilli Chicken - Spicy but had turnde cold. 3/5
6. Fried Chicken Wantons - The filling tasted good, but the fried crust had an oily smell. 3/5
7. Fried Fish - Juicy but bland. 3/5
8. Penne Pasta - Perfection achieved in this case. 5/5
9. Chicken Stroganoff - Worst of the all according to me. Tasted so odd. 1/5
10. Chilli Fish - Again did not entice my palate. 2.5/5
11. A Prawn Preparation - Did not try.
12. Few Veg Preparation - Did not Try
13. Egg Fried rice - Not Bad. 4/5
14. Chicken Noodles - What was that!! 1/5
15. Darsan - Did not try
16. Fruit Custard - No fruits found. Was basically a strawberry mousse. 3/5
17. Small Cake - Dry & Rusty. 2.5/5
18. Ice Cream - Saving Grace (Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry) 5/5

They have a happy hour package for the weekdays between 4-7 pm where a few slected drinks are served @ Rs. 69. So might try it out along with their ala carte menu, if happen to be at the "right place at the right time". 

Overall, based on my first visit: NOT SATISFIED.

Well after a long wait in the Mani Square ( after shopping) we have decided to try Chapter 2 , Heard from few of mu friends.
The atmosphere was very soothing , with live band ( english songs with bass guitar) and the ambience was nice. The waiter are very decorated and explained properly about the dish we had to order. Initailly we ordered Mojito and virgin mary. 

Next after sometimes, we went for 
1. Irish lamb stew
2. Grilled Beckti and prawn steak.

Irish lamb was heavy and enough for 2 people. Grilled Beckti was nice too but don't expect too much prawn.

The serving and decoration was nice too. But the cost is on very higher side and had to sell out 1600 bugs for 4 items but at the same time this was been compensated by nice music and ambience.

I visited chapter 2 yesterday . It was a nice experience. I had a nice and a cheaper meal than I had in food court in my previous visits. 

▪ The restaurant is nicely decorated .It has cosy couches and comfortable chairs.  There was a  stage where live music was going on . Though it is a small place. It is beautifully decorated .
▪The starter was amazing . I also ordered the spaggheti in main course  . It was delicious. Lastly I ordered 4 bottles  Beer .
▪It was very cheap. I did have a nice evening . I will visit this restaurant again.

I have heard about Chapter 2 for a long time & so had the moment today to give it a try !!
Chapter 2 offers you a retro dining ambience with Continental & Chinese spread .. With Good food, comes good music .. I believe it's the USP of this restaurant where they satisfy your taste buds with some savory continental foods & relive your spirit by some fantastic retro music !!

Chapter 2 offers you both buffet & alacart spread to choose from. We decided to take continental buffet.

Chapter 2 provides live music everyday except on Monday ..
On food, the bear battered bhetki fish won my heart .. It was crunchy & melted in mouth like anything.
Salad spread was good, with the option of having different varieties of pasta ...
The chicken salad was succulent & yummy.
Desserts are quite good with Chocolate Mousse being the winner here..

Its worth a visit here !!

I was really excited to have a lunch buffet here.But there were limited dishes in the buffet.Except of one or two dishes nothing tasted good.The cream soup at the beginning was really good.Salads were average and in appetizers dry chicken was really delicious which I liked.The other dishes in the starter was not as good as the chicken.There were few dishes in the main course in which the prawn dish was delicious and rest were below average.There noodles and rice both in the main course.The pasta in white sauce was still better than the pasta in red sauce.There were 3 flavours of ice-cream and that too without chocolate sauce in the desert.
The ambience was good with live band singing classics english songs in front of you.You can hardly communicate with each other at that time because the sound is too high.
Overall it was not as I expected.

Went for the buffet. Since it was the weekend the price was 580 inclusive of taxes. 
Platter- 
3 salads- one in kimchi sauce, a chicken Waldorf salad and a one more veg salad!
A schezwan chicken soup and a mixed veg soup- pretty good!
Starters- Kung pao veg, dry chilli chicken, chicken wantons and chicken wings. 
The chicken wantons were a sorry excuse and the wings kind off smelled for being refrigerated for quite some time. Nevertheless, satisfactory!
Mains- Prawn in chef's choice of sauce, chicken paprika, herb rice, non veg noodles and rice. A dash of continental added with Mac and cheese and spaghetti in red sauce. Sweet!
Desserts- fruit custard, vanilla mousse, darshaan along with chocolate sauce and a two in one ice cream. Yum!
Pretty good spread. Was bursting from the seams after gobbling down all these. 
Ambience- pretty good with Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe adorning the walls. The wallpaper consists of vintage formula1 cars dotted all over which was pretty impressive, and me being a Motorsport fan will add that extra +0.5
Waiters were efficient and ever smiling!
Verdict- Vfm? Totally.

Went there with a friend. Opted for buffet lunch and in a-la-carte, ordered roasted mutton with mint jelly. First coming to the looks of the resturant, it exuded the atomosphere of retro Hollywood era which was really awesome. Then the items on buffet were few but all of them were delicious and finger-licking. It included butter rice, fried rice, chowmein, fish pakora, soup and prawn with darshan icecream and fruits. Although I was not satisfied with the ala carte but my friend seemed to enjoy it very much. The price was comparatively cheap and the service was good.

Went there at 9.30 last friday. Staff were courteous. Ambience top notch but lacks privacy because the seating arrangement is clustered. Food quality quite good but not too much variety. The steaks were good but the prawn cocktail did not match my expectations. The prawn was quite stale and nothing unique about the taste. Overall a good experience since the crowd was not too much and the live music was enjoyable.

Foodgasm in the musical cocoon

Ambience: Located at the top floor of Mani square mall, this restaurant uses Retro music as its theme. The theme is very well maintained with the lights containing disco images, the waiters wearing polka dot shirt with beanie caps, a live music performance stage at a side with a whirling disco light above it and not to forget the iconic images of Elvis Priestley and Merilyn Monroe embossed on a wall. The Bar counter looks like a car from the 70s era while the drinks are kept in barrels with 1970 as the manufacturing date etched on them. The Chairs are all blue and yellow in colour and effortlessly matches with the setting. The music that was playing during our visit was some soft rock from the 70s, which later changed to jazz and while we were having desserts they were playing Denver. Music choice is also very satisfying. 

Food: We decided to have a lunch buffet. The buffet had 4 types of salad including Chicken ceasar salad, Russian salad, fruit salad and pasta salad. Two types of soup viz the chicken clear soup and the corn clear soup was present. Starters had well-cooked variety chicken (of 2 types), fish butter fry, chicken woking, paneer kofta etc. Main course had polao, noodles along with chicken stroganoff, a prawn dish, another chicken dish and some paneer dish. We had the stroganoff and the prawn along with the noodles. Desserts were more pleasant with mango pudding, cake, ice cream with chocolate sauce, darshan with ice cream and sweet. THE FOOD QUALITY WAS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. I have rarely come across such tasty food in a buffet menu. We went on a weekend and the buffet was 499/-. The food that they served against this money was really really good. 

Service: The staffs are very helpful. They keep a keen eye on all the tables. The buffet ends at 4pm. We visited around 2:30pm and as usual lost track of time while chatting and eating. But the staffs continued serving us our food even after the buffet hours were over and even though the buffet is actually self-service in nature. Cash and card are readily accepted. 

Overall: Wonderful place with good food, music and wine; can visit again and again. Definitely recommended.

Located in the 4th floor of Mani square mall. It's a good​ place for dining out. marvellous decorations and live music makes this place different from others. It has a cheap buffet price and it owns almost 22 items. The salads are of different tastes and each of them is a must try. Soup was not that much good. The best starter part was Dry chilly chicken. There is a part for the vegetarians too. Apart from this, in the main course, noodles ,pasta, rice and several chicken , prawn and fish items were there. All were not so good, but the spaghetti and prawn were awesome. But i hate their rice. In the dessert part there were three flavours of ice cream, darshan and mousse. Overall it's a okayish buffet place without making a big hole in your​ pocket :)

We went there for a huge departmental gathering of our college, we were around 45 people. So, we booked in advance. The ambience is really top notch, they have incorporated a retro theme and I personally liked it. Coming to the food, we were there for a buffet lunch on a weekday, there were several items, all the items tasted ordinary to good, I didn't have any extraordinary dish which stands out, but overall the quality and the taste of the food was satisfying for me. Being a dessert lover, I was bit disappointed because they only serve mousse and an orange pudding, I don't have any complain regarding it but I wish there could be more dessert options like the starters and the main course. They also serve ice cream.
The food compared to the pricing and considering the ambience, I will give it a thumbs up. One positive aspect is they serve prawn, so prawn lovers can rejoice.

Went to enjoy the weekday buffet. Situated on the fourth floor of the mall, gives an amazing view of the city. Staffs are courteous. Now coming to food. Its a good value for money. Its a 5 course meal of Salad,Starters, Staples,Main course and Dessert. They serve 4 salads, 2 soups (1 veg 1 non veg), 4 starters ( 3 non veg 1 veg), 4 Staples, 2 Main courses, 2 side dish, 4 desserts. Starters are dainty. Especially the dry chilly chicken and chicken fried wanton. Main course in comparison is okay. In desserts, the plum cake steals the show. They serve 3 flavours of ice cream with darshan n chocolate sauce, plum cake,flavoured mousse and fruit custard. If you are near or in Mani Square dont miss out this buffet. Positively do visit.

Went there for the weekday buffet. Awesome ambience, decor and friendly staff. I was very much impressed with the perfect retro dining atmosphere they have created. They have their live band only in the evening. Now coming to the main thing which is food, they have a spread of around 23 items (I have provided the pic of the buffet menu list) which is simply amazing considering the cost. I am a hard core non vegetarian. So started with their Spanish chicken soup and Chicken wanton which is good.Pepper chicken wings were simply amazing with the perfect mix of spices to satisfy your tastebuds and the perfect appetizer.
There were quite a few salads each unique in taste but quite different from each other. All the salads are a must try.
Now coming to the main course chilli chicken dry and chicken bhindaloo were average and didn't taste that good while comparing with other items. A big thumbs up for chilli fish and hot garlic prawns which were simply amazing. Nothing special to mention about the rice and noodles. But herb butter rice is something which I liked a lot.
Finally in the desserts counter flavoured mouse is too good. Darshan is common in any Chinese menu and I didn't try it. Again custard is also good. There were just two flavours for ice cream and they serve Cream Bell ice cream which is a bit disappointing.

Considering the price and comparing other options available at Rs.471 A.I. I will definitely give a five star. But taking the price range out of the equation I will give it 4 stars.

When we walked into this outlet on a Saturday evening with people buzzing outside its neighbours we were quite taken aback at the empty tables here. We ordered pepper garlic chicken wings, fish finger with fries along with blueberry blush, virgin Mary and a pint of Tuborg. The starters were very good and except the blueberry, which was too sweet, we had no reasons why this place didn't get more footfall. However by the time we moved to the dessert section (Brownie with ice cream and cheesecake) , the question answered itself- it was the service! The wait time is enormously large. Even for a glass of water or the cheque, we had to wait for what seemed like forever. Also they had set up the stage for a live band performance but although the band members were present there, it did not start even at 7:15 so we grew tired of waiting and left. What could have been an awesome evening was somewhat left unsavoury due to this casual laziness. Also, the prices are a tad too high. For 2 starters, 2 desserts and 3 drinks (only 1 of them was alcoholic) the total bill was ₹2100.

I had my team dinner at this place last weekend.

Ambiance: Well, I found this place really charming. The theme is music. One guy performs with his little orchestra crew which was nice, Other then that, the bar was very classy. Nicely arranged, great sitting and spacious.

Staff & Services: The staff was responsive and helpful. Services were slow. 

Food: We had buffet. For starters they have soup which i found rather peppery. Coming on to the main course , they had a very very limited stock of dishes, say 2 out of 10. That too wasn't that great. I ordered baby corn and chill panner besides the regular menu. They too average in taste. They had a lot of options in non veg though. But again, food was just good enough to feed our bally. Ice-cream at the end were the best part for the dinner. :p

Drinks: Now comes the exciting part. Their happy hours are just amazing. Just order your drinks from the menu @69. If you want to taste some good drinks then go visit this place between 4-7. Their bar looks exciting. Prices are a little high in regular hours. But they had a really good stock of the drinks.

Cost: If you are planning for buffet then you know the prices. Otherwise, it will cost your pocket a little. It will take around 1500-1600 bucks for two people.

Overall Experience: I don't like the food at all. The ambiance and the live music were the only thing I stayed there that long. If you want to try a new theme restaurant then visit this place otherwise not recommended,

The first thing about the place which got my attention was the amazing retro decor. 
We were a huge group and we had the buffet. There were 2 kinds of salads. Among starters, the chicken wings were the best. Very tasty. The fish and prawn preparations were good, too. 
The white sauce pasta was very cheesy and very delicious. 
Only one negative point. The manager was asking everyone to hurry up, while they were standing in the line, which was kind of irritating.

Worst service possible worst food possible. Trust me save your self from this loud karaoke in the name of live performance + bad really bad service+ garbage in the name of food.
A: one of the staff just stood there after handing us the bill when we dint even finish our food. When i asked is there such an urgency. He replied yes. We dint even finish.
B: Food (buffet) no point in talking about the lame soups and salads.
1: you will get 2 poorly done starter.
2: rice and noodles that are ridiculous.
3: Sides that you can't even have without water its soo spiced up. Not tasty and spicy just hot spices.
4: very very poor quality dessert. And when you ruin some ones dessert. Thats it...

The restaurant is located in the 4th floor of Mani Square Mall just opposite to Haka. We had the 21 items Buffet Lunch costing ₹470/-(including GST)
The ambience is pretty good with a classic retro feel around it. The food was average which is acceptable at this price point ( you're paying almost half of what you pay at Barbeque Nation or Flame and Grill ). It is a great place for foodies who like chinese and continental food. My special favourites out of the long menu were :
1. Russian Salad (out of 4 salads)
2. Chicken Soup
3. Chicken Wanton Fry ( had almost 20 of them :p advice: add the red sweet and spicy sauce kept in front of it )
4. Indian Chicken
5. Macaroni and cheese
6. Darshan ( i was about to empty their bowl on my plate )

Overall it is a good place for a low budget buffet lunch.

Situated at the top floor of Mani Square Mall just beside Haka. It is one of the better buffet places in kolkata. The spread was extensive with soups,  2 non-veg starters and a lot of options in main courses. The dessert was a bit disappointment though as it had only mango mousse which wasn't good and darshaan and ice cream. It would have been great if there was something in chocolate. Overall a goof place to have chinese buffet given the price.

The 4th floor of Mani Square mall is saturated with restaurants. Chapter 2 is on the same location as two previous restaurants (one of them served a lovely Paan shot after meals but I've forgotten it's name). This restaurant is very expensive compared to others on the same floor. But their buffet is relatively cheaper and offer more variety. The food is fine and the service courteous (they are good with handling kids compared to some grumpy responses that we've experienced). The eye-catching thing is their decor and they play some of the best music you could hear while having drinks or food in this city. I haven't experienced the live performances yet, my comment is solely based on the music they play in their sound system. I want to try out items from the extremely expensive menu and hope to review my rating.

Lovely, classy interiors. Soft lights, seats done in pastels; this very pretty place is located just beside the Haka or Hoppipola outlet in Mani Square.
The buffet is nothing extraordinary. We liked the starters, which was awesome. And I loved the macaroni and cheese!
Rest of the options in the buffet was pretty average, be it the fried rice or noodles or the chicken side dishes. I wish more Italian options were included in the buffet. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Overall, I found nothing special about the place save the decor and the Mac n cheese!

This place is located on the 4th floor of Mani Square Mall. We had opted for the weekday lunch buffet which was for 399+18% GST. The Ambience is top-notch with retro music lightening up the mood. Live music is available after the sun goes down with the exception of Sunday. On Sundays, you will get live music even during the lunch buffet period. The food here is so-so. They have named their buffet 21-course buffet since it consists of 21+ items. However, none of the items were out of the world. There is no mocktail included on the buffet menu and hence, you have to order it separately. The food can be improved by a big margin, I think the management should look into this. We had much higher expectations from this place. I hope that the food doesn't disappoint me on my next visit.

A very beautifully decorated restaurant from the owners of Chowman & Oudh. Gives the retro Calcutta feel. Every evening from 7.30 onwards you can enjoy live english music. There is a happy hour from 4pm to 7pm. They also serve a 22 course buffet lunch @ Rs.471/- only inclusive of taxes. Most of the foods are good in taste barring a few. They have a jovial Barman who produces some wonderful cocktails & mocktails.

Tried the buffet. Nice salads, tasty Spanish soup, and decent main course and appetizers as well. The mac n cheese as somewhat bland, as were the Chinese prawn and fish dishes.

The noodles and rice were both quite good though, but the Chilly Chicken and Chicken wings steal the show. Crisp, flavourful and plain tasty!

For the price I would highly recommend it to anyone who's super hungry and doesn't want Chinese from the Haka next door.

I have had a few excellent dining experiences in a while.Today i visited to CHAPTER 2 with two of my friends for celebrating farewell party.It is located in Mani Sq,4th floor beside Haka.
The ambience is very colorful and the entrance is attractive with a man playing music while seating on a bench.
Just when you enter inside the resturant you can sense the Retro feel(A man standing with his bike) that they have incorporated with the décor with live music.I love the decoration with full of musical instruments.The figure of Marilyn Monroe is another attraction as well.
Food is sumptuous and tasty.
We opted for 21 course buffet which was 470(inclusive GST tax).
Let me tell you the menu first.
There was 1 veg and 1 non veg Soup:-
•1) VEG HOT & SOUR SOUP
•2) SPANISH CHICKEN SOUP
The soup was good and refreshing.

There were 4 Salads:-
•3) COLESLAW CHICKEN SALAD
•4) KIMCHI SALAD
•5) DAIKON SALAD
•6) RUSSIAN SALAD
Kimchi salad wad really good but a bit spicy.Every salads are marvellous and quite different in taste from each other.

In Starters there was-
•7)PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS
•8) CHICKEN WANTON FRY
•9) CHICKEN MANCHURIAN
•10) KUNG PAO VEG(PEANUT)
All were good and pretty filling.

In Staples there was:-
•11) EGG CHICKEN FRIED RICE
•12) HERB BUTTER RICE
•13) EGG CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES
•14) SPAGHETTI IN TOMATO SAUCE
The spaghetti in tomato sauce was pretty average.
Butter rice was not so good.

In Main Course there was:-
•15) CHICKEN VINDALOO
•16) FISH WITH CHILLY SAUCE
•17) HOT GARLIC PRAWN
•18) MACARONI IN CHEESE SAUCE
The prawn was exceptionally good and i could not able to restrict myself from having it.
The amazingly prepared dish was the
Macaroni and cheese.It was simple yet beautiful.

For desers they had-
•19) CHOICE OF ICE CREAM (VANILLA/CHOCOLATE/ STRAWBERRY WITH CHOCOLATE SAUCE)
•20) DAARSHAN
•21) FRUIT CUSTARD
•22) FLAVOURED MOUSSE

Strawberry Mousse just excellent in taste.
Overall it was really a good experience and they are providing a really good spread compared to their competitors.
A special mention about their 69 menu which starts from 4pm and lasts upto 7pm.
I will definitely visit again as it is budget friendly and i feel in love with the place.
Just have a look in my photos for better understanding.

I have had a few excellent dining experiences in a while. Last Sunday, the visit to Chapter 2 with my cousins was one of them. Located at Mani Square, next to Hoppipola, this place claims to serve Kolkata Continental, that was popular from the sixties to the eighties when the fine dining restaurant joints were located only at Park Street, much unlike today's scenario. 
The entrance of the restaurant is really attractive with a man playing music while sitting on a bench. Inside the restaurant, the ambience is very colourful. I loved how all the musical instruments were used for decoration. The figurine of Marilyn Monroe is another attraction as well. There's a live music session. We listened Mr Carlton Perrera playing on the piano. A separate sitting area is isolated for bigger dining groups of about twenty five or for private dining purposes. 
Next coming to service, it was good throughout. The man who were helping us, most probably his name is Subir or so, served us, assisted us always by wearing a smile. There was another person in the staff group, fat by structure who misbehaved with us and verbally abused our kid for no reason. When complained, he wasn't even apologetic until the management bashed him to apologise to us. Management was right on their part but this man was just incorrigible! 
Now, the FOOD! 
Cream of Chicken Soup
Cream of Crabmeat Soup
These are the soups which we had taken. I liked the chicken better but many in the group liked the crabmeat more. 
Prawn Cocktail - Prawns in the house special cocktail sauce was very much similar to the ones from Peter Cat or Mocambo. But how it is served in Park Street is plain and simple, no pansy affair. This one contained cabbage leaves at the base, more canbage leaves on top made the whole thing a little messy. The taste of the cocktail sauce and the prawns were good otherwise. 
Chicken Hawaiian Salad - Chicken and pineapple, a beautiful combination like this can never go wrong. Loved this, very refreshing it was. 
Chicken Tetrazzini - Although they called this Tetrazzini, it was more like Carbonara because it wasn't baked and served in a baking dish, rather in a plain simple plate. The taste was good otherwise. 
Grilled Fish and Prawn Steak - Contained prawns and bhetki, served with veggies and mashed potato in a white sauce, this was the best one from the main course. The veggies tasted nice and loved every bit of this dish. 
Pork Chops - Their staff suggested us to try this. But didn't like it much. The barbecue sauce, which they said would be used was overtly sweet with a very weird pungent smell. The pork contained excessive fat and the meat fat balance was not perfect. Didn't like it much. The veggies and the mashed potato saved us! 
Caramel Custard - This one was good. Made in shaped moulds, freshly chopped watermelons added a new taste to it. Never had caramel custard like this before. Liked it. 
The experience at Chapter 2 was overall good, except for a few glitches. The staff who attended us mainly was courteous but what I noticed down the line they all are slightly or majorly snobbish about the fact they serve 'continental' food. There are thousands of joints serving the same thing today, it's not Park Street from sixties, they need to realise that. 
If you ask, if this place is recommended to visit or not, I would say you can to try out some particular good dishes, but also for the lovely ambience and Carlton Perrera's live performance. I may come back again if there's a situation like that, else I am pretty skeptical about a repeat visit over here. Happy Dining! :)

I would highly recommend this eatery in Mani Square Mall. Continental and Chinese food lovers will have plenty of reasons to rejoice at this place.
The first time I went, I had Fish Florentine, which can easily serve two. The fish was very fresh and tasty, and the indulgent amount of cheese satiated my taste buds. The mocktails are interesting and I would recommend the Watermelon Basil Crush and ghe Ginger Ale. The dry chicken starters are good too.
The next time, I went for the dunner buffet. Its really value for money at just 499/-. There are many varieties of Chinese and Continental dishes in the buffet. Special mention to the Mac n Cheese which is just awesome. Also, the taste and aroma og their Chowmin and Fried Rice can be compared to any restaurant in China Town, Tangra. The garlic fish main course was great too. It was a satisfying meal.

The restaurant also has good collection of alcohol and desserts for the interested.

The decor is very nice and live band music is available occasionally.

Be it buffet or ala carte, you can try this place.

The spaghetti was okay excluding the sauce.Apart from the spaghetti, the caramel custard was a good thing. one thing which the restaurant lacked was the service.

This is my first time visit in Chapter 2. The overall decoration and ambience is good..but the thing(food) which matters is not up to the mark. This is a self service restaurant right from the beginning of the buffet..There were two soups followed by two non veg starters one is dry chili chicken and the other is beer batter fry..some pieces of chili chicken is hard...you will not expect that type of quality from a good restaurant.. batter fry was good...in the main course fried rice is just bland and so as butter rice.. Garlic prawn was tasteless..There were pasta and spagheti also.. in the desert there was nothing special.just 2 to 3 types of ice cream..food custard.. 
                         Actually there tried to serve variety of dishes...but they have to work on the the food quality to make the dishes more tasty otherwise it will go down day by day...Very average experience...dont want to visit again...Thanks.

Went today with my friends order for a few drinks and dry chilli chicken and wonton in starters! It was ok! Then came the horror! Ordered spaghetti and meat balls!! WORST!! Full of whole black peppers, like every bite had 2 3 peppers which really spoilt the taste! Not happy!

Went there for a friend's birthday.
This place is located just beside Haka at Mani Square. Just when you enter the restaurant you can sense that retro feel that they have incorporated with the décor with live music ( kind of an icing on the cake).
We went there on a Sunday and opted for the buffet menu.
All the starters were delicious having Spanish chicken soup, chicken salad, dry chilli chicken, chicken lollipops, chicken wantons and some other chicken items as well.
For the main course they had prawn which was one of the best. They had chilli fish and pasta and a veg haka noodles and some other items too.
For the desert they had mango pudding, vanilla mousse(again a bang on) but they only had one ice cream flavour which was strawberry. That was a disappointment.
Two of the other cons: The buffet containers were empty most of the time and they took a long time to refill them. Another one was that the waiters were a bit inattentive.
Other than that this place is a must visit for everyone.

Went for a team dinner party. Lovely ambiance. The menu was minimalistic but good enough.Special mention for the fish item in starters and the chicken wantons. The beer battered fry wasnt that great though. Also loved the coriander chicken soup and the prawn in the main course.They also had herb riCe, a paprika chicken,mixed rice & noddles.The desert had  a mousse,darshan,ice creams and fruit custard. Loved the fruit custard. The live music was great fun as well. Would love to go back!!

After reading many reviews we finally made it. The good thing is we got what we expected. Thanks to the reviews. Its a self service buffet. You can find 5 types of salads , 1 veg 3 non veg starters, macaroni spaghetti noodles fried rice, chicken fish prawns in main course. pudding strawberry mousse ice cream s in dessert. Small varieties for dessert and starter. But you wouldn't complain when you get soo many items in this budget. Taste of foods are average to good. Now the ambiance - music make you feel relax.

Yesterday I was visited at here.
First, the location is easy to locate.
Second,the ambience was soo good.
Third and finally the food. I prefer Buffet. There was many items in buffet. 5 types of salad,2 types of soups,4 types of staters including fish,chicken, baby corn. In the main course there were 2 types of rice,spaghetti, chowmin,2 types of chicken, pasta and prawn which was too good among all. In desert there were custerd,Strwberry cake,1type of sweet name which I forgot and finally 3 types of ice cream.
All items were delicious Specially prawn rests were also good.
Price is almost same as mention here.

When Chapter 2 opened in Mani Square, I thought that SaltLake/Kankurganchi area at last got a proper continental place, best of which still are near Park Street or South Kolkata area. However, the steaks and sizzlers served here are just about ordinary and compared to the prices, they were just not worth it.

I had tried the French Onion Soup as starter, which was quite nice and infact the best dish of the day. The rest - Pork Chop was very fatty and with that the meat being quite tough, spoiled the dish for me.
Next was the Lamb Goulash which was served with buttered rice. I have tried Goulash in Europe and though the dish isnt spicy, its supposed to be beautifully flavoured with warm spices. This one which Chapter 2 served, was however very very bland! - more like an indian mutton gravy minus all the spices :(

The interiors are done up nicely - though I would like the msic to be a bit toned down, so that people can converse at least!

For food, babycorn. chicken manchurian, mac and cheese and fish fry tasted the best. Chilly prawn had too too much of chilly to taste, it killed the whole palette. Herb rice was the worst of the lot. Evrythng else taste good.

So it was a pleasant outing at chapter 2, the place have a retro look that is really cool and gives a very good ambiance and feel to the place the decoration is will obviously make you visit there every time. 
So it's 4.5/5 for interior decoration and theme
Now coming to food the food was good we had chicken steak which was tasty but our lamb steak was over cooked and was hard... They make a very good cocktails and it's a nice place to have drinks. 
It's 3.5/5 for food
Now coming to service. These place is filled with unprofessional waiters and staff the worst part about this place is the service you will see annoying waiters roaming around you and providing a very slow service. 
It's 1.5/5 for service.

If only decorations made you happy.. Sadly, for a foodie, that's a secondary thing. Have been to other places serving buffet and this place falls way short than others in terms of number of items or taste. To be honest, if my count is not wrong, the starters and main course included the numbers would be around 12-14. And you can reduce the number by more than half if you are a vegetarian. And sadly, some items went missing during this time, so may be I counted wrong. I suppose this was not the ideal scenario at other times but it wasn't for me. Hope it would be better the next time, if it does happen next time. And yes, no complimentary drinks. So, probably no.

So you are not just gonna enjoy the food, but the complementary entertainment is a full on!
Absolutely delightful ambience out there and the buffet is just worth it! For non-veg buffet, the chicken soup, the chicken wangton fry, chicken manchurian, chicken paprika, noodles, some prawn dish was amazing! And so many items to go and for desserts you get to choose different flavours of ice creams, puddings, custard, strawberry moose,  all that just 399+tax in lunch or 499+tax in dinner!! There was the gentleman who performed so brilliantly and he would love to sing any song you request, it added a charm in the ambience! I am sure that all of you will enjoy the food and the wonderful music .. Go ahead people and you will certainly enjoy!

This is my second time at this place, the food and ambiance being still as good, got a whiff of low professionalism from the staff.
 We were wrongly charged for our order. Will use the word "wrongly" since the waiter could not explain A scheme to us properly. As per the manager/in-charge he had joined back just this morning after his mother's death (he even removed the cap from the waiters head to show us its shaven...whyyyyy..). And hence was not aware of a particular scheme. However "he will pay from his pocket since it was his fault".
Wow.....!!
But why would he pay from his pocket if the fault was of the management for not briefing the staff well enough.. ? 
And why would all these be told to the customer. Why would the customer want to know from whose pocket the refund is coming.
Extremely unprofessional attitude. Not expected from a high end and renowned restaurant

Located in fourth floor of Mani square mall.. Had a buffet lunch this wednesday ! Must say they had a lot of variety of foods ! Let's start with the menu.. They had two soups one veg and another one non veg ! Soup was quite good ! 6-7 kinds of salad was there which was not that bad.. Starters had chicken fried wantons which was really bad.. chicken lollipop,pepper chicken and chilly fish all of them were really good which kind of made up for the chicken wantons! In main course they had fish , prawn and chicken .. All of them were really good.. Egg fried rice , egg chowmin and veg fried rice all of them were nice.. One thing that really dissapointed me were the deserts.. I really didn't like any of them, except for the ice cream which was good.. A special mention to the white sauce pasta which was simply awesome .. It simply melted in my mouth and the  taste was amazing ... 
Good ambience , good staff and its also quite spacious out there.. Loved it .. Would love to visit it again..

Went here to celebrate my friend's birthday.
This place was on my bucket list for a really long time and finally I managed to grav a bite.
We opted for the 21 course buffet which was 481 AI.
Let me tell you the menu first:
There was 1 veg and 1 non veg soup. 
The soup was good. Refreshing
There were 4 salads out of which the kimchi was really good but a bit spicy.
In starters there was chicken friend wanton, chicken wings, pepper chicken and chilly fish. The starters were good and pretty filling.
For main course there was prawn, chicken and fish.
The prawn was exceptionally good and I couldn't help myself but declare it the star of the buffet. The chicken was the worst of the lot. There was egg fried rice, egg noodles and herb friend rice. 
Another amazingly prepared dish was the macaroni and cheese. It was simple yet beauiful.
The spaghetti in tomato sauce was pretty average.
For desserts they had a orange custard which spoiled my entire taste as it had too much of orange in it, then there was the strawberry mousse which was good but a bit too sweet. Also, they had darshan.
Apart from this they had chocolate, strawberry and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.
The ambience was amazing. They had the perfect music to set the mood and the waiters were really nice and nimble on their toes.
Overall it was a really good experience and they are providing a really good spread compared to their competitors.
A special mention about their 69 menu which starts from 4 and ends at 7.
They have a special list for it and it also includes starters at 69+taxes.
Will I go again- Yeah I will cause it is budget friendly and turns out I fell in love with the place.

Located beside Haka and Hopipola on the top floor of Mani square mall......Before visiting this place, I had got mixed reviews from my friends. But the place literally made me skip a heart beat as soon as I stepped in. Great place. Its all about the American theme. Elvis n Monroe on the wall. Country songs been playing on the  Box. And yes they also have a live band platform. I have tried the Ala carte n the buffet both. Coming to the food, the buffet menu consists of continental dishes which are delicious but not very appealing. The main course was also okay and the dessert menu was limited.All over its very pleasant to spending time here.

They have set up a nice decor.
I did not find many choices in the desserts section. Main course chicken was bland. Although the prawns were good. There are plenty of starters and salad.
Would like to visit this place with live music someday.

The ambience of Chapter 2 - Retro dining is what attracts you to this restaurant. The food is delicious and the decor, live music and the excellent service adds to it. They have both buffet and a la carte. A la carte consists of soups and continental cuisine. They had Chinese cuisine in the buffet. We tried chicken carbonara and chicken paprika. I would say chicken carbonara was wonderful but the paprika was average. Wish to visit again and try the buffet. Definitely worth visiting multiple times. A great place to hang out.

Environment: preety good

Description: went to meet a few friends and decided to visit this place to have continental dishes. Though they do offer chinese buffet in a very pocket friendly price, we didn't go for it. Chicken carbonara is basically spaghetti in white sauce, it was very tasty. Chicken paprika was also good. Specially i liked the buttery rice of it. A good location to hang out with friends.

Wanted to try some place new and landed here with friends.

Ratings 5/5
Lot of reasons are there.
Ambience, went for lunch so no live music i thought I missed a big part, but blues and jazz music in the background set the mood, great music to enjoy food.
We had a buffet and it was one of the best buffet i had till date.
Salads to icecream everything was so damn delicious, dry munchurian, cheese macaroni, moose were the star of the meal. Rest were good too, the praws, chicken wings, spaghetti, both the rices, icecream (chocolate, Strawberry and mango) custard. A perfect lunch.
Complementary cold drinks was a surprise but was needed.

Hopefully visiting again soon. 😊
A must visit to enjoy music and quality food. 
Rs600 for this experience and buffet was a real bargain.

Located inside Mani Square Mall, this was the only restaurant there that was yet to be tried out by us, and the experience was disappointing.

Went with my husband and a friend. Husband went for the 499 plus taxes buffet, which was not particularly worth it. There was a large no of options in pen and paper, but everything tasted too similar to each other. I opted for the classic spaghetti with meatballs and my friend opted for meat lasagna. Food was decent, but in my opinion spag-balls should not be so sweet. I could not finish my plate.

The watermelon daiquiri was really good, and so was the LIIT, as a kind of redeeming factor. The desert provided in the buffet though was very much below expectations. There was darsan in the menu, but no vanilla ice cream option - only mango, chocolate and another flavor that looked like strawberry, but was more like bubblegum. How can you offer darsan without vanilla ice cream? The strawberry and mango custard was too synthetic, and it was surely not value for money.

Also, some of the staff have attitude problems. It was getting very stuffy inside, so we requested one of the staff to decrease the temperature. He, with a very square face, told us that the temperature is "absolutely fine". It is only when I said, "But it is a fact that I am feeling hot, and if you don't agree with me, I'd like to see your manager" that he arranged to turn up the AC fan speed or something. In a mall, where there is plenty of culinary options available, it is difficult to accept this kind of customer service. 

This was, I hope, a one off incident, and I will not hold this against them. However, they will have to concentrate on improving food taste if they need to sustain. The decor and ambience is perfect, and very spot on to the theme, and they even have a live music set up, so it would be a shame if they do not buck up on the other areas.

Had visited the place with immense expectations but was a bit disappointed. There was no live music (the main attraction) on that day (I don't know why), few items were delicious and few were average. I mean there are lot of places in Kolkata were the food is tastier at equivalent price. The prawn, chicken wanton, fried rice, fish fry and brownie was awesome.

Overall a Good Place....There are 3 different types of buffet menu on rotational basis ..with any 1 being served on a particular day. The waiters were courteous but need to know more about food in the menu. The manager, Mr. Santanu, visited every table seeking feedback on food. No live music on weekdays but music played through system was American classics, true to retro dining theme.
Menu:
4 Salads
1Veg Soup + 1 Non Veg Soup(Spanish soup)
Starters:-
Chicken manchurian
Veg **** (something like Pakora)
Haka Noodle
Butter Rice
cheese sphragetti
Chicken wings
Fish dish
Prawn dish
Brownie
Tootie Frootie
mousse
Darsaan
Ice cream

Weekday Price for lunch was Rs.399+18% GST i.e Rs.471/- (A.I)
Overall a Good experience with nice ambiance.

Mixed bag place with pros and cons ruling out each other. The live music is really nice (singers are talented and choice of songs good) but it's so very loud with acoustics of a Trincas in a  room 1/4 its size. Results in humming eardrum and virtually impossible to have any conversation.
Food preparation is good, with the cream of chicken soup being tasty but half the food/drinks on the menu being absent. It's a pub with Old Monk rum unavailable, Baked Alaska in deserts unavailable. The unavailability is communicated after much prodding.
Tab for 2 with minimal alcohol came to c.1500.

Chapter 2 was there on my wishlist for a long period of time but I am not that satisfied with the service and the food quality although it is pocket friendly.. Starting with the decor.. 5/5 for the decor.. Loved it.. Starters 4/5..fish and chicken wings were amazing.. Soup was such a disappointment.. Main course would be a 2/5 for me..chicken items were not upto the mark.. Although prawn,, fish and noodles were good.. The desserts.. 3/5..not much variety..Lastly the manager not for once came to acknowledge us.. So chapter 2 a 3/5 for the decor and few items that i have listed!!!! With

Before visiting this place, I had got mixed reviews from my friends. But the place literally made me skip a heart beat as soon as I stepped in. The decor is ahhmazing with a touch of retro look. They serve 21 courses for the lunch buffet and I really loved all the non veg items, though I think they can increase the number of choices for desserts, but I would still say I absolutely loved the experience. If you don't wish to go for buffet, they also have the option of a la carte. I went for buffet and I would say it's absolutely worth the money I spent.

Recently visited chapter 2 for  a lunch buffet worth  499 including taxes each..  Located beside Haka and Hopipola on the  top floor of Mani square mall..  Decoration is fabulous and unique..  Ambiance  is  good..  

They  don't serve starters on the table.. So  we started  with  soup..  Spanish chicken soup was good..  Salads were fresh and tasty..  Loved  Russian and chicken salad  among  the  4 options.. Starters  included 4items..  Veg, fish, chchicken and  chicken  wanton..  Chicken wanton was  good,  fish was different, Chicken pieces were rough and not up to the mark.. Here  I must say that this place is not for authentic Chinese or Moghlai food lovers.  In main  course  there  were  spaghetti in tomato sauce,  noodles, egg chicken fried rice, herb butter rice, chilli prawn, fish item and  chicken item.  Prawn was best among them.  Fish was  good  but  chicken was okayish.  In desert there were brownie, mousse, darshan,  ice creams..  

Service was not satisfactory..  
Overall  nice experience.

A very charming place with good food, and live music which accentuates the retro dining experience.
They manage buffet for dinner as well, for large parties, and an ideal dinner out for corporate dinners / team outings (capacity circa 50 at best). All in all it is definitely worth another visit,

Situated at the top floor of Mani squre mall.....it is well decorated music theme based restaurant.....nice music is always playing .....the music gives a character to this restaurant....the replica's of Elvis Presley and Marlin Monroe just add some more notch to it.....

We opted for buffet lunch...there were salads ,soup,starters,main course and desert.....

In salads there were four to five options...like kimchi salad,russian salad,chicken salad etc...

Two types of soups one veg and one non veg...

In starters four options were their dry chicken Manchurian,chicken fried wanton,fish item and veg kung Pao.....all items were tasted good....among them the fish and the wanton was very good...

Now comming to main course....there were egg chicken fried rice,egg chicken noodles,spagheti,veg buttered fried rice,chilli prawn,fish item,chicken item and macaroni pasta....

In the desert section there were assorted mouse,darshan, browny and ice cream.....

This place is situated at the top floor of Manisquare mall. The restaurant is nicely decorated as you can see in the pictures itself. Went there few weeks ago with my friends for the lunch buffet which is extremely cheap. There were too many items in the buffet but none of them was upto the mark. There were lots of salads among them I liked the chicken ceaser salad ,the starters were okayish nothing great, the main course had fried rice,pastas, chicken, prawns etc but the food quality were not up to the mark . The desserts were nothing great too it consisted of ice creams , custard, and darshan. I didn't like the food at all. And yes we also got a complimentary drink with it.

After finishing drinks we have given order for pepper chicken wings and chicken strogan off... Both the dishes were very good in taste and also quite heavy..

Above all courteous staff with quick delivery makes a customer happy..so it was a nice experience..

At times you question your judgment on which you had total confidence. After visiting Chapter 2 yesterday, I cant get over the fact like WHY??WHY??? WHY??? and whoever has rated this horrible place more than 3 and I am left confused whether I went to the same place Chapter 2 at Mani Square!!!!
   The only good part about it was the singer and that's pretty much about it.  The place was way too clumsy and small. The decor is okay type. The waiters are so unprofessional and no show of enthusiasm to work.  And the worse part was the food. we were 4 of us, two us opted for buffet and rest of us opted for a la carte.
The options on buffet was handful and out of which only few were left to be served. Options were so limited from starters to desserts. The quality for both buffet and a la carte was disgraceful and it's overly priced for the food they offer.
   They need a major management change and check on their food.... Or May be they should shut it down...!!!!! (Yes, I am really upset and angry with my experience) .

It was totally unplanned. Me and my friend were coming back from work and were starving and suddenly the name of chapter 2 came up in mind and we took a turn towards mani square. First of all a nice and warm welcome and a classic decor which will win your heart. So basically its a 21 course buffet basically main focus on chinese and maximum foods were non veg. We both ordered a lime soda extra which costed us 200 more on the bill.
Coming to food. Food is quite good. Lightly cooked. But they had a lot of cornflour content. Prawns, fish, chicken all of them were coated in cornflour but the coating was too much. Gravy items were really good not much oily or spicy. Chowmein was okayish could have beem better. Fried rice was pretty amazing, very nicely cooked. What i loved the most was salads. Not too many options in desserts so if you are a dessert person its not the best place for you. But yes definitely worth a visit. Price is quite low. On saturday and sunday price is high than weekdays. Prices are mentioned on zomato. So for two people with 2 fresh lime soda was 1415/- all inclusive. Must visit for adding a place to your buffet listing.

Overall, a good place to have continental food in and around Salt Lake neighborhood.

It read quite good reviews about this place so i decided to go for a family lunch there this sunday..
But unfortunetly i didnt like the place at all...
First of all there were no good starter... I mean they say its 21 item buffet but most of them were salads that too didnot taste good... Salads and starters were big dissappointment.... Even frankly speaking there were no proper starters if i compare to other buffets in the same floor of mani square...
The only thing i liked was pasta with white sauce and spegetti...
Now coming to the main course it was okish... But yet not much to tell...we ordered lime soda which again was a big dissapointment... In desert there were few options.. and by few i meant only 2... No ice cream...
Over all i didnt like the buffet at all...
The staffs were good..
Music was good
Manager was humble
Ambience was good

Over all

Food:2/5
Ambience:4/5

Very good place for dining with live music. Food was average. They should bring some more variety in dessert. Starters were good except the wonton chicken fry. I did not liked their main course items. Their staffs were very good at their service. Very well decorated place. Only they should look into their menu. Hope to visit this place again.

Note-Buffet is only Chinese. For dessert they had- ice-cream, darshan etc. 
We also ordered Cosmopolitan... it was refreshing!

Weekend buffet costs around 600 INR per head (just for info!!)

Ambiance is quite soothing with soft music playing in the background, service is definitely very pleasing with cordial behavior.

Coming to the food, the buffet menu consists of continental dishes which are delicious but not very appealing. The main course was also okay and the dessert menu was limited.
But for a first timer, it was surely an interesting visit.

The ambience of this place is nice. But when it comes to buffet menu, it is very limited. One should at least consider some fresh lime soda or cold drinks as complimentary. The number of items also very very limited, with not every item very tasty. May be they should consider raising the buffet price a little and enhance on the menu.

Chapter 2 -It was a random pick for our long awaited dinner plan. We hopped it to be kind of regular, over-budget, fully crowded restaurant with generic food quality and preparations. As we entered we felt it was completely fine dine and peaceful. No loud music no noise inside door. We order our pre-planned food with hell of questions regarding it's taste . But we were surprised thoroughly. Foods were undoubtedly remarkable in taste and live performance was amazingly soothing and musical . Entire atmosphere was like a 70's retro bar with its ambience, decor,and  look & feel. Last but not the least the guy who was constantly singing and asking for our request of song, was the cherry on the cake . Loved it .

The first thing you'll notice when you enter this restaurant is how different their decor is and to me, it appealed really well. We ordered,
Drinks -
1. Long Island Iced Tea
2. Jagger Bomb
3. Planters Punch

The most disappointing part while ordering drinks was they had NO BEER. I was having dinner on a Saturday night, one of the busiest night of the week and yet they were under-prepared. It kinda ruining the mood right at the start. The drinks we then ordered were good.

For food, we went with,
1. Ham Steak
2. Gypsey Beef Roast
3. Spaghetti with Meat Balls
4. Pepper Chicken Wings

The Ham Steak was really good and the best dish of the night. Spaghetti with meatballs was also good and I liked the taste very much. Beef Roast was good in taste but the meat was a bit on the tougher side. Really had to chew a lot. The quantity of the dishes was perfect for one person. The Pepper Chicken Wings never made it to our table. I don't know what happened but somehow they lost the order and it was supposed to be the starter. Since we were really full from the dishes, we didn't ask them about the wings anymore. It was also not included in the bill. This really shouldn't happen. 

So overall, the place is really nice in decor and the live band but their service really sucks. From the unavailability of beer to entirely losing the starters order, it was just messing with our dinner plans and a bit of a mood killer.

At Chapter 2 the ambiance is very good. Food are really very tasty. Cocktails and Mocktails they served were absolutly amazing. Live Music concept has been fused beautifully. Debasis, the attendant is very gentle, humble and the items he suggested for dinner was fantastic. Moreover, at the time of closing of the restaurant, when they came to know that it was my husband's birthday, another surprise they have presented, which touched our heart. Will surely make many more visits.

I have been here twice and there was a startling difference between the service both times.
Once I went for an la carte and second time buffet. Obviously, I was specially treated only for a la carte!! Their portions are very small compared to the price and the taste is just above ok.
The second time when I went to try out the buffet I was treated like a nobody as if I was there to have a free lunch. They couldn't even arrange a comfortable place to sit as well. If a restaurant is not ready to give their best service for something they have advertised so much then there is no need to promote such things. Highly dissapointed by such behaviour !! I will never ever recommend only for its service amd worthless food !!

Although I was sceptic to try out food over at Chapter 2, still went there due to the coaxing of my best friend. The moment you enter through the door, you are greeted by a statue of a man an a bike; a good selfie zone I would say. The decor is not that impressive and seemed a bit wannabe ; the mannequins of a poorly done Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe could not salvage the decor. Coming to the food, we ordered a chicken tetrazzini and a sheperds pie. The tetrazzini was very bland and left a bad taste. The sheperds pie was horrible to say the least. It was smelly and i almost gagged. I had one spoon and had to request the server to change it. The staff was co-operative and readily agreed to change the food. By that time however, the mood was already spoilt and I did not take the risk to order another main course. Instead I ordered the pepper chicken wings fearing the worst which however turned out to be good. Next my best friend ordered a Tiramisu. Previously I had this notion, that no restaurant can goof up a dessert item. And how wrong I was! The upper layer was coarse and frothy instead of the usual soft creamy layer. The middle part was bearable but the next layer was a very bitter watery cake layer. We just could not finish it. Moreover, there was a live band playing who were so loud, it was even difficult to talk. Both of us started having an headache and we literally ran out of the place after paying the bill. The experience was disappointing.

Located inside the Mani Square mall, this restaurant tries to recreate the look and vibe of some Park Street eateries from an era gone by. So much so, that the owners sought the help of top Bollywood art directors and fashion designers to create the retro look of this place. I wish that they had spent as much time and energy finding some good chefs, because even though the décor of this place is nice and the service courteous, the one big let down is the one thing that matters most, the food.

I tried the pork spare ribs. The meat was tough, chewy, flavourless. The only thing I could taste was the sour sauce which overpowered everything. The boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes tasted really bland. There is nothing to write home about the tiramisu either.

I will never know what food tasted like in the Park street eateries in the 1960s, but for a younger generation which is well travelled and much more worldly wise, the food here is not nearly good enough.

Biggest allegation... The A/C was as god as off..... It was hot in there.... We told da attendants to chill it up a lil, but to no avail... Went there on a Sunday.. Had buffet... The food was good but not great.... I mean, it did serve 21 dishes but da variability ws less... The chicken manchurians were way too much spicy.... The other were okay. The desserts were really good. There was mango pudding, strawberry mousse, ice cream & Darshan. It's the most enjoyable part of da treat. Newaz, it ws a good experience bt i wnt visit dat place by choice.

Not a pocket friendly restaurant but taste wise, decor wise, staff wise, it is worth it. Loved their chicken wings. Quality is good and most importantly the theme, just amazing. I wanted to enjoy their lives band but sadly I went for lunch and they play in the evenings. Better luck next time.
Must visit 😍

Rubbish restaurant. 
Horrible food , no varieties ...disgusting experience. Each and every food tasted dreadful 
It was so badly prepared and cold. Staff's behaviour was also not up to the mark. It comes nowhere compared to haka and barbeque nation. Shame on you guys . My money was wasted.

A retro themed fine dining experience .we had cream of chicken soup, prawn mocktail, beef steak and shephards pie...all the items are equally tasty .the music was quite loud making the fine dining less charming as we had to raise our voices as if we were shouting .

Hunger led us to chapter 2 ... although we checked the menu and found a list of very popular retro continental food we decided to go for the buffet which was certainly value for money but average on flavour. Have to go back for the main course some time because bring a foodie I had to peep at the food going to the other table and I remain tempted

When your wife and mom tells you not to do something, just listen to the women who matter  in your life. I learnt it the hard way during today's Sunday Lunch at this place called Chapter 2 at Mani Square. To start with, they were not able to cater to most of the dishes we thought of ordering, so we went for the buffet which was like 'amader local chineese resturenter spread'.
Then came in the drinks with the Prawn Cocktail (which was a mash up of mayo and stinking prawns). The LIIT which I ordered (because they did not have beer-like no beer) was anything but the beautiful drink, on my complain they just added more variants of alcohol and cola to get the desired colour (which eventually became rum and cola). My wife found alien items in her share of food from the buffet, 'kakor to be precise' (can't help if they are sourcing their items from the local ration shop- wait..they also sell clean stuff these days). Stuffing the most ordinary buffet with my family, I headed for the ice cream and the bit around that, on my return, I saw a small little cockroach on my plate (ohh, it was so cute) and my wife spotted his brother (slightly larger in size) on the floor. When I turned my look to the floor it seemed like it had not seen the broom in the past few days. To add to it all, the staff did not even bother to offer a discount, it was business as usual for them( dada apni ke, amader malik o eei kheye boro hocchey)
My suggestion to the lovely people of Kolkata, who surely love their food and dining, please do not make the mistake of coming to this 'Shit Hole' (The music is the only nice thing over here)! PLACE NOT TO GO : Chapter 2 at Mani Square!

I used to be a regular at Chapter 2. It started out in place of Navin Pai's 405.

In fact the first year or so, I'd go quite regularly. The staff were polite, the decor was pretty awesome and Carlton played some great music. I would never have the buffet. My family always ordered a la carte. The food was decent and there weren't too many places serving Devil Crab and other dishes one would generally find at a Mocambo. However all of that changed recently. I noticed that the ratings had been going down. I still decided to take my family, including my parents, for my sons birthday lunch. For some odd reason I decided to take the buffet, while the rest of my family members ordered varying items. My mother ordered pork chops. This wasn't the first birthday occasion I had come here to celebrate and  'surprise' complimentary cake was offered from the restaurant. 

From there on everything went downhill.

-The buffet was cold and i immediately realised it was a mistake. 
-The prawns come from Metro Cash and Carry. They are not fresh. Frozen prawns are generally soft and watery and lack texture. 
-The Devil Crab  was't really crab, but comes from Metro Cash and Carry's Frozen Seafood packets. 
-My mothers pork chop was stale and was smelling rotten at the bone. It was chewy and inedible. A profusely apologetic Manager came to change the dish. Her dish came back after 45 mins by then we had all finished and were waiting to go. Incidentally this dish had to be carried home. My mother called me during dinner saying the second piece was stale too.
- The complimentary cake was more cream than cake. I wouldn't be complaining about free cake if it was free! I was charged Rs400 + taxes for the complimentary cake which was the size of a muffin camouflaged in inedible strawberry cream. The manager was no where to be seen and I told the waiter if they were going to charge me for the cake, firstly I should have been informed and secondly I should have had a choice of cake.

I spoke to the Manager in the evening. I have always shared a good rapport with the staff.  However the  incident has ensured I will never be going back to Chapter 2. There really is no excuse for this kind of food.

When u think retro, u think colours and patterns,  and Ur not disappointed when u walk in. Leaving the ambience aside, the food is okay. We ordered chicken Hawaiian salad and a sea food salad, eggs Benedict, mushroom and corn on toast and cheese balls. The quantity was good, the prices were okay, the taste was average. The chicken could've been smoked... The sea food could have a better vinaigrette.... The eggs were more like poached eggs... The cheese balls were too dry. On top of it they had a live band which was quite good, but too loud.. Definitely not music to the ears. It could've been better, but the whole experience just lacked something. 
To top it all, the server seemed all too keen to clear our plates, even before we were done with our food. Ah well, it was probably just a bad day for them all.
I'll give this place another try later on and hopefully they won't disappoint me.

The decor is fantastic and the music is fabulous. Other than Elvis and Monroe, I liked the rusty bike at the entrance. 
We were dead-hungry when we reached this place and jumped right onto the main course.

You have to try the Devilled Crab out here... just mouth watering. We also had fish fry and grilled bhetki n prawn steak. Overall i enjoyed the food, music and service. Would recommend anyone.

Finally I ticked it off from my bookmark list. Went there for lunch seeing the attractive buffet offer. And it turned out to be a fine dining experience. 
It has a near perfect retro themd ambience which I presume surely gets better at night with the live music playing. The walls are beautifully decorated and the big grand father clock in the background of the bar simply adds to the beauty.
It offers a 21 course buffet menu . Items are predominantly of chinese recipe. Among the starters the chicken legs were really good. Another really tasty was the chicken salad. In the main course the fish was good. One thing that really disappointed me was there was no ice cream in the dessert section and the choices of desserts were very limited.
Most importantly this whole lunch cost us only RS962 for two persons i.e RS481 per head. Thats a  really  cheap deal. 
Otherwise the food was good but also nothing extraordinary.
So my opinion- just pay this place. You surely won't repent.

We went for a buffet lunch on Sunday. The ambience was quite good with live music. However, other than the ambience, nothing was good. 
We have been to many buffets in town but trust us, this was an utter dismay. Be it the food quality or the number of dishes served, the food sucked. Nothing was up to the mark. From starters to main course to desserts, either the food was semi-cooked or over-cooked. 
In short our Rs. 1415 went in vain!!!

It was a Monday and very less crowdy. Waiters were few and may be less pupil in the kitchen also which made us waiting for our dinner for a long time. Apart from timely service nothing was there to complaint about. We had Mutton cutlet, Egg Benedict, Devilled crab, Grilled Prawns, Chicken Tetrazinni, Chicken Steak, Virgin Mojito, Fresh lime soda. Apart from devil crab we just loved all the items ordered. It was really an authentic continental dinner for us. Being a mocambo fan really cant compare with them but cant complain either..

How about eating as much as you can in just rupees 399 and too good food!? Just try Chapter 2 once and have the buffet situated inside Mani Square Mall and I promise you, you will thank me later! ;-)
The buffet is consisted of 21 Dishes, and you can eat as much as you can! Mainly Chinese, and some continental dishes!

3. Decoration - Beautiful! Colourful Seating arrangements! Live musicat night! City View from glasses will make you day with your loved ones! They are playing 80's and 90's top english hitlist! John Denever, Elvis Parsley, Frank Sinatra will be there constantly with you! 
4. Staff behaviour - They will escort you from the outside door to you seat! They will serve you your every single requests promptly!
5. Pocket Pinch - 399/- plus Tax, Monday to Friday! Go, eat as much as you can!

Buffet Menu (Mostly):
1. Daikon Salad
2. Chicken Ceasar Salad
3. Pure Veg Cheese Salad
4. Chicken Spinach Soup

I visited Chapter 2 yesterday . It is located in Mani Square Mall. When I entered, the staffs welcomed us and told us to take a seat . The seating arrangement includes cosy couches and comfortable chairs. .I saw that the place is small but beautifully decorated . The staffs were courteous and kind. Thier behaviour was good . Live music was the icing on the cake. I ordered meat lasagne, chicken tetrazinni and caramel custard. At last It was very cheap. I would like to visit there again and again.

The food was healthy,heavy and mouthwatering..I ate a vegetarian dish as I am a VEGAN,,it was called asparagus mushroom risotto.At first it looked that the quantity is too less but I was in for a surprise as the dish in which it was served had a caved in shape which cannot be really made out when the food is served almost up to the brim.
Also the place had a live band performing English classics.
So all in all it was a good outing.

This has been on my wish list for quite some time now. Ticked it off with a lovely Sunday dinner last week. Chapter 2 has got a very quirky, fun yet a suave decor! With Marilyn Monroe all the wall, colourful chairs and some great music it hits all the right chords. Coming to the food we started with the pepper chicken wings, 8 pieces a dish, I found it a good value for money and being a chicken wings maniac I really liked it though I feel it had more of a honey and pepper feel to it. But the real deal was their Egg Benedict. With a lovely layer of ham, cheese, toast and poached egg this dish tasted like heaven. A must have no doubt. In the drinks the virgin mojito tasted just fine but my virgin mary had a tad bit high chilly flakes for my liking. Ended the meal with a sweet caramel custard which was quite smaller wrt the price. The music was lovely with the band doing what they do the best, hitting every possible romantic English singles from the 80s and 90s. The service is warm and efficient though I had to ask for the bill thrice to three different guys. All in all Chapter 2 is quite a good option for a lovely time and good food whenever you are at Mani square the next time!

Live music is awesome, singer sings really well. Big thumbs up to him.
Coming to their food quality i would not suggest people to waste their money on this buffet atleast. The reason is, they do have good no.of menu but their quantity sucks 😑. i have been to many buffet and its really rare to see that u can't take ur food of ur own. And wen they serve they really give tiny amount of food.
Foods are good! 
Quantity sucks!
Dessert - only ice cream n mousse. So a thumbs down.
Paying 617 approx and eating half is not a next visit for me.

Good food.
Outstanding ambience. 
Very courteous staff.
Chapter2 has got a really attractive à la carte menu...but when it comes to buffet, I expected a little more variety. They call it a 21 course meal...well, it is, if you count in the pickles and other silly add ons. I personally felt that Haka (which is right next to Chapter2) provides a better quality buffet since the menu is too similar to be distinguished. 
The buffet quality and variety is ordinary to be precise.
When it comes to their à la carte, they've got some real eye-catching names in the menu. But if you are a pro foodie and you actually know what certain odd dishes taste like, you might feel a little awkward since they tend to shift from what the taste should actually be; not that they taste bad. But a lamb steak or lasagne or say irish stew might not taste like the one you've earlier had. ;-)
Overall thumbs up for the retro theme and the courteousness of the staff.

About the food both quality and quantity is their plus point..tried prawn cocktail, sea food soup, meat lasagna, chicken steak ..each and every dish was more than perfect..only chicken stroganoff could have been a bit better..service here is very good..I already visited this restaurant thrice and hope to visit agn!!

She took a blue berry blush and since corona wasn't available went with Forster..    Over all the food was excellent . The staff were courteous and the service was good..  Will surely visit again..

I mainly liked the chicken dishes, whereas the fish and prawn are also a worth try. Besides the side dishes I have not found the main couse well. There was variety in main course but it tastes really avg. The service is good and overall if you are not interested in the main course too much,  then I would really recommend this buffet menu.

Checked out this fairly new place at Mani Square. Impressive decor that harks back to the 70s. The menu card nicely summarises the vision of this place- to re recreate the swinging 60s era that Park Street witnessed. The decor and the menu is quintessentially park Street, what with the dimmed lights and the 'continental' options. The live music takes the cake, with some familiar faces from Trincas and other live music places from park Street headlining it.

We had pork chops and grilled prawns with Long Iceland Iced Teas. Decent food, with the familiar assurance of quality. Good crowd and a really good location.

Overall- impressed by the place and would definitely visit again.

An average rating because I am not a big fan of continental or sea food and this place didn't do much to change that. The fish fry was below average and so was the chicken fry. Mocktails were awesome but the other food items were not commendable. Having said all this, there were no complaints about the service and ambience. British food lovers can pay a visit.

Went there on valentine afternoon. The ambience is really good, live music and all. The staffs were also good. Coming to the food, we opted for the buffet. The food was average, we expected a lot more but the desserts were good.
Would like to try once again and this time, will try your recommended dishes.

We visited this restaurant on Saraswati puja and it was jam-packed.
The decor is quite vibrant and it takes one to an old American world. Staffs are courteous.
Food was good.But we had higher expectations.
We opted for the buffet lunch.There were 21 items - 5 types of salad,some starters, noodles, pasta, some side dishes of chicken and prawn and three desserts.
Chicken salad was great.Potato wedges were crispy.
Fried cauliflower,Pepper fried chicken wings,Chicken soup and Pan-fried fish  were not bad.
Cheese pasta, Egg chicken fried rice, Irish chicken stew  and Kung Pao prawn rice were delicious.
But the desserts did disappoint us. Strawberry mousse and Caramel custard were extremely sweet.  Darsaan with ice-cream was average. They could have served ice creams of better quality.

This is the place where you'll walk in and get hit by an exclamation into your mind, 'Oh so beautiful!' It's a retro theme based restaurant with some phenomenal decor and a wonderful ambiance. The seating arrangements were extremely relaxing too.
Since we were almost full and needed a much much beer break, we visited to this place and ordered two bottles of kingfisher ultra(though it wasn't our choice but had to take it due to their lack of varieties in choices). And as a side dish we ordered for cheese balls which were indeed really delicious.
I found this place to be a little extravagant.

Located in mani square...the place has made a name for itself owing to its ambience specially the live music. Some soulful music coupled with retro theme makes it a lovely place to go to but service and food needs lot of improvement.
Service: ok. Waiter was not too friendly and also pretended to hear what we were saying but actually he wasnt. Had a blank foolish smile on his face.

Food:# English fish finger: just about ok.
#Cream of mushroom soup: loved the bowl but the soup lacked cream and also there was no salt in it. Bland.
#chicken steak mushroom sauce- was it the mushroom sauce??? Not at all. Bad experience.

The worst thing i liked was the tabasco sauce kept. It was filled with water. Better shouldnt have served that.

Visited the place today with a friend of mine. Truly speakin, we didnt have any such plans to eat a buffet here but somehow we git dragged in by own. Maybe the urge to try a new place. The buffet menu was well spread. There was a variety of options including chicken, egg, fish. Even the veg menu too was really delicious. The menu was a merge of oriental and continental. The best part of it was the pan fried fish and the dessert and the ambience. The main course side dish is a thing they need to work on a little. In a nut shell, its a place one should try once.

Visited here on a Sunday evening ! Well, firstly we faced a full house bump which I heard is bit obvious in this place as the live stage takes a major part of making it an attractive junction on weekends.
After couple of minutes we got a seat & found that some good english play is going on & even the owner is watching the show as well.
We found the ambience good except few  family with kids are feeling extreme conscious as some sound might interrupt the ambience !  
We ordered Irish Lamb Stew & Chicken Tetrazzini to finish our quick dinner !
The food is very good & very close to the authentic taste of Irish stew.
We have concluded our meal with Baked Alaska which is again very good but I will not call it the best in the town.
I will surely recommend this place to friends & family. Well, for a detailed review, I need to travel back to this place again ! 
In my first view : Continental stuffs are very good here.

Food was very bad , took buffet.
None of the recipes were yum at all.
Only pudding was good.
Staffs' behaviour was not comfortable at all, not welcoming and no way friendly.
Paneer chili had 1 centimetre  paneer and 4 cm of flour coating ! I mean seriously? Even same with prawns , prawns were micromini in size and flour coats were like 4 cm making it look like big prawns! Fried rice tasted like roadside ₹40 plates' !
Too bad !
Lunch buffet was ₹485 and so bad!
Whereas Haka's food is 10000 times better in ₹430 (YES I'm comparing !) 
Waste of money !
Drinks are overpriced!
One drink is almost equal price to its total Buffet price !

You walk into this place and it immediately makes you feel good. The decor is really nice - with Marilyn Monroe and MJ taking to a world of retro Hollywood and music. 
The food however could be much better. We ordered cocktail pork sausages, chicken a la kiev, and a beef steak. 
The sausages were nice, with a smoky flavour. They had a nice char on them and were tossed in a nice sauce with peppers and onion. 
The chicken was crumbed real well. It was loaded with molten butter inside. But the stuffing inside the chicken was herby and quite bitter. Did not like that part. 
Coming to the steak, we had asked for medium rare but it was way overcooked and really tough to cut and eat. The mushroom sauce served with it was nice but ultimately it wasn't a very nice dish. 

The staff here were really nice to us. Service was nice and that made us happy. If the food was better, it would have been an amazing experience.

I went to this restaurant with a group of 16 people. The decor with a theme of retro dining was nice with nice use of colours. We availed the buffet. The soup at the beginning was refreshing,followed by a nice fish starter. However I was disappointed at having found bones in the chicken starter, with less fibre and more bones on the plate. The mains were average. And the desserts were a letdown for me apart from the mousse. The custard lacked flavour with the fruit used being more watery and less tasty. The ice cream s were frozen a bit much. Although overall the buffet was well spread and the service was prompt and good. We enjoyed much.

Located on the 4th floor of Mani Square mall...this eatery is based on the theme of retro dining. The ambience, decorations and food items available have been planned in accordance with the theme. The seating arrangements involve cosy couches and comfortable chairs. They have the bar at the back with a vintage car replica display in front. There is also a "Live music set up" near the entrance. We went for a late lunch and hence was greeted with the irritating "sound check" part of the upcoming evening show.
We ordered 3 items from the main course menu. "Roast duck in orange sauce" really disappointed us. Although they claimed that their preparation style was above reproach...we found the item to be undercooked and it failed to stimulate our taste buds. "Bar-B-Q pork ribs" was palatable, whereas "Beckti lemon grilled" was really soft and delicious. Among desserts, "Baked Alaska" was unavailable. So we opted for "Caramel Custard" which dint really live upto our expectations.
Their buffet option is definitely cheap, but their A-la-carte menu for sure isnt. Those 4 items for 2 people cost us nearly Rs 1900.
Service is bit slow, although the servers are courteous enough to the foodies.

This is by no means a comprehensive review and one may expect further updates at this space.

So yesternight three of us just hit upon this place. The ambience is quite resto-puby incidentally playing live music. The singer dished out lounge versions of ray orbision, billy joel and the likes.

The seating arrangement was extremely relaxing but could have used some sort of imagination. Now for the food:

We had gone for cream of tomato soup (extremely sweet, please warn them before hand about your sweetness factor!), the French onion soup (this is usually clear and thin. However, in this instance it was thick, creamy and once again had ample dose of salt and sugar, not meeting the standard style). The soup that floored us was the cream of crab meat soup where everything was perfect and delicious.

Since we were almost full, we could order cheese balls (they were really tasty). The chicken wings unfortunately deep-fried with a spicy ketchup enrapping the entire dish.

Would love to visit again to pass a final verdict.

I visited Chapter 2 yesterday for the lunch buffet. It was exciting. Combination of buffet was continental and Chinese. There are 4 types of salads. 4 types of starter . And the main course was different from the normal buffet. It was very tasty. And the dessert was very nice. The light music was there combining with the ambience. I would like to visit there again and again.

They will surely give you a 21 course buffet as they claim and that too at a very low price. But, the food really sucks. Serving dry chilli chicken in starter that too with bones- you guys are way far behind- who does that nowadays in a market of such competition. The soup was just horrible. Fishes were uncooked, chicken in starter had bones....you have to wait very long for starters....they are not ready. The chowmein was good along with rices. Main course prawn was ok but chicken was just horrible. Deserts were just really bad. They will serve you cream bell ice creams that too of very inferior quality. What more overall an horrible experience. Ambience was d only positive r part I guess.

Had the 21 course lunch buffet. The soups and salads were good. The chicken dishes (five spice and vindaloo) very quite average and the meat was not tender. The Chilli fish was soft, but was not something to rave about. The Honey Chilli prawn dish was good. The Egg Fried Rice and Noodles were disappointing; a much better taste or finesse is expected from a restaurant such as this. The desserts were decent.
The premise is attractive (21-22 dishes at Rs. 481 only) but, one can get better tasting dishes at the same or lesser rate.

Went for a casual dinner with colleagues. The ambience is quite mesmerizing. Especially the theme of a music band gives that retro touch. A beautiful series of beverages along the counter. Coming to the food, we tried the pork chops- quite tasty though a little on sweeter side. Lamb pepper steak turned out to be awesome. For desserts, the cheesecake was okayish. Baked alaska that we had, i think the outer surface got burnt tad past normal. The only negative point is the service. Very slow, quite annoying sometimes. Otherwise a good joint to have some sips and dips.

Not one to criticize food too often, this place has let me down in serious ways. The food - lamb steak was undercooked, chewy, smelly. The veggies were raw. The chicken steak was bland, undercooked with raw undercooked veggies. The bhekti prawn steak was excess in cheese. The chicken wings could have been softer, the only good thing was the corn cheese ball. The service - slow and lazy, unwilling to come to the table and serve. Really disappointed.

Newly opened restaurant in Mani Square Mall is a place to be for tasty continental fare. We had special festive feast of Bar-B-Q pork ribs and Turkey in red wine sauce. Meat of both the dishes were tender and cooked well. Bar-B-Q pork ribs reminded us of bar b q pork ribs we had in Canada. A pint of beer went well with these dishes. Beer at Rs 200 a bottle is on high side but the food price is at par with fine dining joints. Since it was a weekend there was live music which seemed bit loud compared to the space available. Ambiance and inside decor is eye catching with a pink convertible car (cut in half!) placed at the bar counter!

I had known chapter 2 for its very affordable 21 or 22 (pardon the count) course buffet @399/- but when i visited it yesterday I found out that they have ala carte dishes as well and a variety of them, primarily continental...the restaurant is located at the mani square mall and is themed on the retro american, based on presley and monroe..the ambienece is as lively as it can get..once u enter the restaurant you would forget for the time being that you are in the 21st century, such is the perfection of the theme..the seating area is quite large and mainly comprised of couches and tables, with a vintage car seating zone adjacent to the bar area..they host live music shows and we had a lady singing english numbers to the crowd there with her band, which was a treat to the ears and added to the ambience..the decor comprises of wall statues of monroe and presley, disco ball hanging from the ceiling and a lot of stuff that enhances their theme..the staffs are also dressed as per the theme and they are extremely courteous and attended us the best we could have expected..for food we had ordered 1)devilled egg @something around 280-290 - 2 large egg devils stuffed with mutton keema and served with french fries and a mayo dip; tasted pretty good, but would have liked it hotter..2)chicken cordon bleu @370-380 - chicken with a fried crust wrapped with ham and cheese within and served with mashed potatoes and boiled vegetables ; this tasted extremely delicious and made our visit to the chapter 2 worth it....the restaurant is expensive and you need to have a budget of atleast 1000 rs for 2 (without drinks)..had an amazing experience though..will surely visit again and would recommend it to the continental lovers...

Prices aren't ridiculous either. What's not to love? I've been there twice now after I've discovered it. Latest visit was on new year's eve. I've tasted their chicken and lamb steak, chicken tetrazini, lasagne, one more chicken dish I don't remember the name. Also, I'm a bit picky about my cocktails but I absolutely loved the cosmopolitan there! I'd definitely be going back! Haven't tried the buffet though.

I went for lunch with my husband for new year's and it did not go as per expectations. We reached a little early so the restautant was not yet full. We ordered the deviled crab for starters and by the time it arrived, the restaurant was full to its capacity. We called the server to clarify a few things regarding the main course items, but he could not answer and had to go fetch his colleague. His colleague finaly answered our query and I ordered the chicken steak mushroom sauce while my husband ordered the gypsy beef roast. It went downhill from there. After a lot of waiting two other servers made a round of our table asking whether we had placed our order or not. They had not conveyed the orders to the kitchen and messed it up. From a restaurant which is quite highly rated, we expect the main course orders to be brought to the table together. They served the beef only so we had to wait till they served my order. So while my husband's food was on the table, my food was not. Similar incident happened at the table beside ours. The four occupants were served their mains separately. So while one person was eating the others had to sit and watch. 

When I finally was served, it was not what I had asked for. The server took it back. A while later he brought my order. The chicken was to be served with polenta, but they had served it with mashed potato. When we brought this to the server's attention he argued with me saying it is polenta and then went on to say that Ma'am polenta is "Italian Sooji". Come on! We know what polenta is. If you dont have it, say you dont have it. We can take that! Just dont try to pass off mashed potatoes as polenta assuming that the customer will not know. I did not create a scene and we were already late. 

Overall, the food was average and the service, truly pathetic. Definitely not enough to ever take me back there again!

Also food wasnt that yum.Now looking at the price its cheaper than other buffets hence you can ignore the above drawback and surely visit the place.

A decent fine dine in North. Live music in front and bar at the back. Overall sitting area with moderatly good leg space. Courteous staff and sophisticated decor. We took prawn risotto.. chicken cordon bleu and devilled crab.. and those were reasonably good. Single portion can be shared by two. If you have been in Mocambo earlier you might get confused with the menu card of Chapter 2. 90% similar. However tastewise they are not similar so please keep your mind open to accept the difference. Their menu also contains chicken ala keiv.. baked alaska.. bhekti muniere and more, any mocambo visitor would know about these names. Buffet is from monday to friday is also decent with its average but delicious range of spread. Since they have taken up common names from a renowned restaurant they need to really work on them to be at par. Otherwise this place can always be an option for sudden eat out plans.

A Nice new place to try. Though we had the option for buffet lunch , we went for Ala Carte and was pleasantly surprised to see the quality of food . The Pork Chops and Beef steak was quite impressive. There is a wide variety of option available, specially in the western cuisines. The Dessert , specifically the Strawberry cheese cake and the Teramessue was really amazing. Will wait eagerly to try the remaining western menu during my next visit.  Drinks menu can be improved upon. Most of the wine and Beer collection mentioned in the menu is not available.  The place is also slightly cramped for space.

Got food home delivered last night. Had called the restaurant before ordering as to ask for any recommendations or must haves. The person on the phone wasn't interested in talking or giving his recommendations which was not a good sign. But I still went ahead and ordered prawns on toast, fish and chips, devilled crabs and chicken steak. Was very  impressed with prawns and fish items. The portions were generous and tasty. Even the packing was very good. Must say one the best continental foods available in this side of the city. Finally something that matches to the level of park street restaurant. Kudos to the chef. Managerial staff can improve.

A continental fare at one of the busier malls on a busy Saturday left us satisfied and content . Chapter 2 has made quite a name with their number of signature continental dishes and cheap buffet spread . Greeted by a courteous owner we were duly seated and thus began a very nice foodie affair in a cold Saturday afternoon . We were interested in their signature items , especially the 3 items that are mentioned in their Zomato page . And therefore , this review closely looks at those items and wether they are good enough to be worth your time and money .

° Food :- innovative continental items have the habit to pull foodie enthusiasts from everywhere. I have been monitoring their Zomato page for a long time and thus when the opportunity came to grab a lunch i simply did not hesitate to order those items . Below are the ones i am talking about :- 

1. Ham steak ( 5 / 5 ) :- Touted by many as their best , u simply cannot afford to miss this item . Probably the best ham steak in town . This is a generous slice of ham expertly grilled over pan and served with an egg poach on top and accompanied with mashed potatoes and sauted onions . Every slice of the ham with the egg and onion seemed like heaven to us and we relished every mouthful of it.  A highly recommended dish and please try it at least once . Pork lovers , this is a must for you .

2. Gypsy beef roast ( 4 / 5 ) :- Secondly a fabulous beef dish . Beef lovers will enjoy some innovation as this time they will be served sliced beef pieces which are smoked and grilled properly . The smoky burnt flavor which I felt in the beef pieces were unique and I loved it . Of course the meat was tender and was perfect with the BBQ sauce . A slight issue was in the quantity of veggies but that was not the serious . The meat really won us over . Very much recommended .

3. Irish lamb stew ( 4 / 5 ) :- Last but not the least and super lamb broth served burning hot with a generous portion of herb  rice. Some lamb stew are white but this one is dark in color largely due to the broth used which due to the ingredients . There are a lot of lamb pieces and the meat is tender . The broth was a slightly overpowered with pepper and mushroom to our liking.  It went great with the rice which was once again awesome . Every mouthful seemed heavenly . Very much a recommended dish .

The dishes are mentioned in the order in which they were served . These 3 dishes are enough for 2 people who have a big appetite .

--------------------------------------------

° Verdict :- Well , for the kind of experience I just mentioned , it's a must must try . All the items mentioned above are fabulous continental fare and we were glad we choose that over the Chinese buffet spread which contains items that are nothing new to the plate . The staff was highly generous and service time was less . It was a fine experience and one to saviour . Following are the main points :- 

1. Best ham steak in town .
2. More than decent continental fare 
3. Meat lovers paradise.
4. Classy ambience and proper service .

Go ahead and have a meal , and if you are a meat  lover you are in for a treat .

It would have been better if the food would have been as good as the decor and ambience of the restaurant , but unfortunately its not . The buffet menu was all mixed up and the quality was not at all good . Even the 2.0 which it gets from me is just for its service as not even the ending dessert was good and I could have easily got way better meal in some other restaurant at this price .

The food and ambience here is amazing, complete with the car bar i.e. a bar on the cadillac. There are also live bands playing on certain days. Me and my family came here for lunch on Christmas and had beef steak, grilled fish in lemon butter sauce, fish florentine and baby back ribs. The food was delicious especially the fish florentine, which was probably the best I have had in a while. The desserts were great too but I didn't like the consistency of the cheesecake, because I like a bit of a jello-ey consistency on mine. Overall a great experience, if you are willing to go a little off route from the main city.

Visited this place last night and was quite impressed with the setup. It was my 3rd visit with the last two being not so fond. Though like earlier times yesterday  I had a good time. The food we ordered was Irish Lamb Stew and Ham Steak. Both of them tasted superb, especially the Irish Lamb Stew, it was delicious and very well cooked. Even had liquor on our table, a Bailey's Irish Cream and a Kahlua but was disappointed with the drink as it was heavily diluted with ice chunks. Moreover had a better experience with food from last time and will again think of visiting the place. Yeah, live music was good according to standards and they do take song request. I just paid a tribute to George Michael by requesting Last Christmas and the singer pulled it off nicely.

Good place to spend some quality time with friends and family. Food is good. Live music adds an extra flavour to the ambience. But the service is not as good as expected. But I would say apart from the service it's a good place to give it a try.

I personally did not like the food. It's located right in front on HAKA, Mani square and you won't see the crowd in front of Chapter 2 which quite explains why this restro bar despite offering LIVE music is quite over rated.
Also, I was unhappy with the staff behavior.

Chapter 2 is recognizable from far, with its tacky red shades to a rodeo sign. At the entry there was Romeo with a Royal Enfield (why? Running way with Juliet this time?) And outside was a “McDonald” ripped old man sitting on a bench. The place was crowded and this made the staff so frantic that one of the members broke a glass. Not only this, when we asked the recommendations, they would just runaway as if I was speaking in Latin (Western Theme huh?)

 The décor was good and rustic. There was a arrangements for a band to perform however, they weren’t actually doing so.

The mall was full of posters that read “21 course buffets” but on checked out the spread, I contemplated to have fallen for the marketing stunt for fickle minded people. The buffet consisted of not more than 21 dishes to choose from. Disappointed already, we decided to go for a la carte. The menu consisted of basic and rare vegetarian dishes, or let’s says the place is a non vegetarian’s paradise. We ordered a chicken carbonara, which was satisfactory not great. Next, we tried the vegetable lasagne. Being a lasagne lover I was so disappointed I wanted to rename the dish on the menu to undercooked vegetables with cheese. Anyone who is looking for vegetarian is advised not to enter or if they do so with caution. 

Overall my experience was not great.

Gist : A must have medium length buffet @481 (tax included). Great decor & music.

I visited this place on 23.12.16 at 12.30PM. Very spacious place with good ambience, more than 40 people can seat but washroom is for single person only. Enjoyed the background songs but miss the live action. The buffet menu having 18 items in total but each tasted good. Both veg & non veg items are available in buffet but I tried only non veg. Mushroom creme soup, fish butter fry & desserts were outstnding. Service is good but there is room for improvement. Will visit again with friends.

We visited  this place recently on a weekday for the lunch buffet.
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Wasn't much crowded, good decor, live performance will make it 5/5, but unfortunately there was no performance going on, at that time.

Food : 3.5/5
Quality was good, taste is okayish. Options: Many for starter, limited for main course and extremely limited for the deserts. Being a Desert lover it was disappointing to see that they only had 3 desert dishes , that didn't even include ice-cream.

Some of the dishes that needs a special mention are the crispy fried prawn with seasoned Mayonnaise and the Irish chicken stew. They were exceptionally
 good.

Staff: 5/5
Extremely courteous and well behaved.

Will visit again to try their a la carte menu.

What could have been a 4+ exp ,sadly ended up as a 2.5!
Went for lunch on a sat afternoon

Ambience was good and so was the menu and wine list.
Ordered Mulgatani and cream of asparagus soup,both of which were excellent and made us look forward to the main course.

Bhetki florentine was delicious snd do was the spare pork ribs.
However everything went down the drain with the Hungarian Lamb goulash....the lamb was half cooked and super fibrous...we called the waiter and informed him of the same....the waiter called the manager ,who called the chef...and all three ganged up to try to explain to us that lamb is like this....blah..blah...we grill and pan fry...
We had .a show to catch...so we wanted to finish and leave.so we did not want another round of the same dish..they argues for almost 5 min or so ..then the waiter let it slip that they cannot cancel the order....now this was amazing becoz we never mentioned it...on saying that we dont want a refund ...there was a Stunned silencd followed by the manager trying to coax us into the desert anc thd chef continujng with his monologue ...had to rudely ask him to stop and leave us alone and give us the bill....the bill arrived after 15min without the goulash listed.
So if u were going to take it out ..why the fuss!

Management please take note of your poor service. None of the ppl from ur waiter to chef or manager is fit to work in hospitality

An evening well spent. Amazing live music (barefoot) , great ambience, lovely food. Fish fingers as accompaniment to the beer is great. Fish is fresh and flaky.
I tried the stuffed fillet o beef- soft and succulent though there should have been more on the plate.
The duck with orange sauce was a disaster; the duck was lean and stringy, and again 1 leg cud not a man's appetite satiate. 
The ham steak was delicious, delicious, delicious. 
Chicken Kiev - nothing to write home about.

Chapter 2  wonderfully recreated the 70's era with its decor and music.  Nice ambience and staff is warm and hospitable. I loved the live music. 
But food was not up to par. 
We ordered
1. Spanish Sea Food Salad - taste was bland with little trace of seafood. Really disappointing.
2. Cream of Chicken Chicken Soup - tasted good.
3. Devilled Crab - it seemed to be canned crab meat rather than freshly extracted. Tasteless. 
     Mashed potato and boiled veggies couldn't save it either.
4. Grilled Beckti and Prawn Steak - Satisfactory.
5. Chicken Stroganoff - The chicken gravy tasted exactly like Cream of Chicken Soup just with bigger        bits of chicken served with buttered rice.
6. Blue Lagoon - the drink was nice.

If the food was tastier, it could have been a nice place to hangout with friends.

Great ambience, quality of food was standard. We ordered our food at 6.30pm and they served it at 7:35pm. Almost over an hour we have to wait, even the drinks that we ordered were served after the food. Other than that it was a moderate experience for us.

This is my first visit to Chapter 2. The ambience is very classy. Constant light music with soft light. There is also arrangement for live music. 
The cocktails we ordered were very good with sufficient ingredients. Along with cocktail we ordered chicken tetrazini and nachos with tobasco sauce. 
According to me and my friend the price of the cocktails are to an extent acceptable but...the price of food items are too costly. They charged 345/- for a plate of nachos with tobasco sauce...which seems to be a quite costly.

Needs improvement while cooking the duck. It was undercooked. I know how a roasted duck feel and taste. In the lamb chops there were more bones and less meat. Proper portions are required to be selected while serving. All the sauces accompanying the dishes were good. Lastly, the beef fillet was well prepared and deserve a mention.

I would like to rate this restaurant for several reasons. 

Ambiance : Nice pop style live music with a soothing decor.  4.5/5

Staff : Really helpful staffs. They are always ready to help you in choosing your stuff.  4.5/5

Food Quality : We went for a dinner with an a la carte menu. Pepper Chicken wings were juicy but bit sweet as well because of BBQ sauce. Beef Roast was nice, though lamb steak was not at all good. Lamb was really overcooked. In dessert, they have a great variety, but unfortunately nothing was available. It was a disappointment. Overall taste wise food was okay, but yes., if you consider their price, it was really overpriced. Price of alcohol is towards higher side as well. Though this restaurant servers some variety of beefs and steaks which are nice to have. 3.5/5

Price : Too much overpriced. 2/5

A note to management : Guys, if you are showing something in your menu, please make it available. People like me, chose your restaurant to taste some of those cuisines. I m disappointed after all.

After going through several appraising reviews about this restaurant, finally I decided to hit it. I would say it did not match up to the hype, but the visit was worth it..! The only turn-off was the extremely delayed service. It was a long 40 minutes for us. We saw two other families leave in dismay for the same reason.
We ordered 4 items:
Bekti Florentine -> 4 soft and succulent pieces in a thick cheesy gravy. This was the best!
Tenderloin Steak -> Well cooked beef, with mashed potato and grilled vegetables. Commendable but not the best I had.
Roasted Chicken -> 2 large chicken legs, with mushroom, mashed potato and vegetables. Tasty and sufficient for two.
Caramel Custard -> The best custard ever! A great dessert to end with!

The waiters were courteous and the resturant is modelled in the fashion of America in the 70s. Models and wall-art were replete with depictions of Marilyn Monroe, Jazz, American muscle cars, etc. with similar background music to add to the ambience. Cost is a bit on the higher side, Rs. 1700 for two.

Will visit again.

The dessert options are quite limited and the Brownie was hard (like very hard).. Service was good and so was the ambience.. But a lot of improvement is needed as far as food is concerned..

Loved the ambience. The live in performance was very welcoming.. They will sing to your request & also gets you nostalgic with their old songs..  Had gone for a buffet but much to our disappointment. Food was cold & stale. Stroganoff was extremely salty. Other dishes were average.. prices are not a big hit on the pocket.. 
Additional point for the staff. Hospitality was more warm than the food. 
If not for the food; might visit again for live music, ambience & nostalgia.

The menu is pretty reminiscent of the by gone era , when Skyroom and Blue Fox were  at their peak.  The name itself  hints at a revamping of the dishes popular in that era as well. The decor is  intriguing and the service was pretty prompt, although they did not have   all the beers in stock. We ordered a Chicken a la Kiev and a Stroganoff . The former was served with a balsamic reduction and although it did not ooze butter when pierced , it was  scrumptious.  The stroganoff, in comparison, was  blander than it normally is. Still pretty delectable.  All in all a  worthy addition to the Calcutta food scene.

Would advise everyone to be careful.

Went for the lunch buffet . Well, Chapter 2  is a sister unit Oudh , I came to know about this place from there only. 
The price of the buffet is surprisingly cheap. 
Faced a very courteous and helpful staffs out there who are ready to assist and help in every step. 
Though its a buffet spread, we got our plates and food delivered to our tables by the staffs with a smiling face. 
The decor is a winner, and the music just adds feather to the cap. 
Coming to the food, its tasty !! 
The pan fried fish is a winner. 
Chicken is not that much wow ! 
The chicken salad is a wow item too. 
They should try to exclude the  vegetable salad out from there. 
In the main course,  the curries of prawn and chicken are good. The rice could have been better.
In the dessert section,  custard is not upto the mark. 
..
Overall, I feel this is a nice place to visit considering the price and quality of foods. 
Main course should be updated, but again looking at the price tag I feel its OK !! 
Way to go !

We celebrated my birthday here...though there was nothing special done for that nevertheless we loved the food, ambience and most of all the live music...my sons were especially happy with the music having grown up in the post park street experiences era...we had egg devil and prawn on toast for starters...the prawn on toast was just amazing and we need to go back for more...gypsy beef roast, ham steak, irish beef stew and pork chop made up the main course...the winner was undoubtedly the pork chop but we enjoyed all the items...must mention the portions...they were more than adequate and we were not able to finish the whole thing...baked alaska was not available in the dessert section which was disappointing but the brownie and apple pie both served with icecream brought a very satisfying meal to its desired end...Chapter 2 is definitely a place to visit and revisit especially for people like us who have grown up on Park Street fare

To be very honest, I liked this place. I liked the decor, the ambience, the feel, the music, the people and most importantly the food. This place is near to my home and quiet easily accessible. The cuisine is basically continental and they do somewhat justice to the ingredients. The buffet is really nice and enjoyable if you are pairing the food with the poison of your choice. The live music is a big thumbs up for me. The food is decently price. I see myself as a regular diner of this place. (I have already visited twice, though I am trying to maintain a strict diet, Shhhh!)

One of the best places I have been to. The 21 course buffer is amazing. Special mention to the chicken soup and beer batter fish. The beer batter fish just simply melted in our mouth. Only downside was that there was ice chips in the ice cream. The décor was awesome. The vintage car added a classy look. The staff were good too.

On my recommendation based on purely on the reviews, visited here with friends and families. 

All are fine except food.When your main attraction goes wrong whatever you tried in decor,ambiance and service all goes in vain.

in one word it was inedible. 
we have ordered Prawn cocktail, Devilled crab in starter. Lamb pepper steak,Chicken Roast,Juicy Pork spare ribs in main course. 
Almost all items we tried before in different joints and experience was awesome.

But here in starter overdose of mayonnaise or smashed potato, they tried on presentation only,you can't cut pork/lamb with your knife too stiff it was.

Even how chicken can be so hard that still beyond my believe.We have to left the place with 60% leftover in plate.

It was just  worst quality we all have tried in recent times,

Well after reading lots of good reviews we finally stepped into chapter2. Honestly I was floored by the interiors- everything from the floors and the ceiling to the live music and the dress code of the staffs had a very retro feel to it. This came in as a breath of fresh air among wanna be theme Restuarants flocking the market.. I opted for a buffet whereas my hub opted for the menu. I was really pleased with the cream of mushroom soup. The salads were decent. The starters were good, however the main course was exceptional ! The Irish chicken stew was the best that I've had at kol. The consistency was up to perfection. The Mexican rice had the perfect balance of sweet, tang, and hotness. The mousse for the dessert was melt in your mouth without any residue of the cream that you get served at the local joints. I had only one content with the chicken supreme for starters as it was a bit over fried making it chewy and the quality of the fish for the buffet was a major turn down for me. The fish was stale and a bit smelly.. we spoke to the manager and he told us the king fish was fresh however it did not seem like it. However, my hub ordered for a baked fish dish- where this fish was very good. He had also ordered for a pasta in white sauce, where I think the cheese portion was stingily used giving the dish a more four taste than the melt  in the mouth taste..I think that is the area where the Restuarant has scope of improvement, however, the rest of the effort is as well done as a good raw/medium beef stake sizzler!

Was hobbling around Mani Square searching for a decent place to lunch other than the food court and a couple of restaurants. Ended up at Chapter 2.

Gave me a feel of NOT being in India for a bit. (Which is a positive comment. :)) It's a decent sized place, soothing lighting and ambience. Yes. Courteous enough staff. Was really excited to see a stage. Wonder if they have started with music gigs.

Had ordered for Corn Cheese Balls and Macaroni Cheese Casserole and a couple of whiskeys. The quality and the quantity was very good. Didn't expect to be full half way through the Macaroni. :)

Would I visit again ? Definitely. Felt peaceful. And a good menu design. :)

Nice place. Exceptionally good ambience. Staff is very friendly. Tried the buffet. Wide variety of food. Quality of food is quite good. The food itself was good. However the fish was a little over cooked. The music set up adds a nice touch to it. All-in-all a good place to go to. A pocket friendly experience !!

As I walked in, I quite liked the decor, spacious arrangement and off course, live music but everything fell flat as they could not serve half of the things that we had ordered or wanted to order. They had only stocked up the high price items on the menu card and that's what we were asked to go with. Not good customer service at all! Very sad 😢

This place is just  the perfect one if you really think that the main cycle of life should be FOOD DRINKS MUSIC REPEAT.  When you are greeted with John Denver numbers, the stay ought to be very good. The live music is also a marvellous project. Now coming back to the food, lip smacking is what comes into my mind right now. Their drinks menu is a delight but their beer stock was a bit let down for me. We had opted for the A-La-Carte. Their buffet menu was huge but we experimented with the A-La-Carte. We ordered a Lamb Pepper Steak and a Devilled Crab. It was just what we were craving for. We chose Baked Alaska to finish our lunch, justice was done to our lunch. All is well that ends well and the desert made sure we have that feeling. Overall a must visit for everyone.

I've been here for twice and each of the time they've left me amazed. The first time I visited this place; the interior, ambience and the music they were playing, were enough to steal my heart.
Coming to the food; just at the first look you'll fall for your dish, they spend some good time in presentation making the food look yummilicious. 
I've only had ham steak and a la kiev here. Though, the a la kiev had failed a bit to impress me but the ham steak had stolen the show.<3
I strongly strongly recommend you this place.

The buffet is really nice and tasty. The menu is different from what we are usually served in Buffets and it is new. Not very heavy yet tasty. Though choice of desserts is very less but the main course Is good. There are not many options in starters but overall it is good and worthy. 
Other than the buffet if a la carte is considered the price is a little more compared to quality. 
The live music makes the ambience enjoyable though it is not available during the buffet hours. 
The decor is also good and overall a good place.

In one word : Amazing. The retro feel, the superb ambience, great hospitality and above all the top knotch food sums it all. Their buffet menu is enormous and it's a long journey consisting of a variety of starters and maincourse. The deserts are good too. It was a 21 item buffet. The food quality and taste is what attracted me and I rate this place higher than most of the buffets in town. Loved it. Looking forward to visit more in future.

This place is exactly where square 404 used to be. I had tried that earlier but was not that impressed. Revamped and renamed Chapter 2 has that retro feel. Its bar counter will have your attention straight up. 
Anyway, me and 3 of my friends went there for a lunch. One friend of mine, being vegetarian, ordered the Vegetable Lasagne. It was creamy and delicious. Rest of us ordered a Chicken Strogannof, Lamb Goulash and Pork Chops. Chicken strogannof was pretty standard. Lamb Goulash was very good though. Nice sweet and spicy sauce, each served with sauteed veggies and herb rice. 
Pork Chops was a total disappointment. Wasn't cooked well. Didn't taste good. 
Service was satisfactory. More or less, good experience.

One of the best places to enjoy Continental food. We went there for lunch for a buffet with 21 items. They were so awesome. The service is also too good. The waiter recommended me to have icecream and brought one more for me. The Chicken Caesar salad, Cream of tomato soup, Grilled fish, buttered rice and Garlic prawn were fabulous. The dessert was also too good. The ambience is also too good. I missed the baked Alaska this time

Was very excited to see the menu as it was our kind of food. Went with my wife and daughter. Half the beers were not available. Food served is absolutely deviation from the menu description. Caesar's salad was gluggy attempt with very little chicken. Only Iceburg. Was expecting assorted greens. Caesar's dressing was like thick mayonnaise. No Croutons. My grilled prawns were miniscule in portion size. No staples as mentioned in the menu. Lemon butter sauce had a lot of sugar. My daughter's chicken steak did not have creamy mushroom sauce but a thick, dark, readymade BBQ sauce. My wife's fish and chips was very thickly crumbed and tartare sauce was pathetic. French fries had soaked fat. This is sheer cheating when you do not serve what you have written. Pathetic attempt. These people require serious rethinking and professional help. You cannot cheat people like this. All there for about 1200 bucks plus per head. Entire effort and excitement went down the drain. Would never visit for sure. After returning after 12 years in Kolkata, I seriously want to know who are these people and what do the aspire when they open a restaurant? My Calcutta was never like this.

Starters are Good. Main Course dishes are pretty bad.

Service is very poor, no one was there nearby for attending. No one gave us the Menu Card.

The staffs should help us letting know about the dishes.

We got confused by the names and ended up ordering Prawn Risotto, which was really bad and a waste of money.

The ambiance is OK.

Here are the ratings of the dishes we tried,

Starters:

=======

CHICKEN MINI BREAST CUTLET : 4 / 5

DEVILLED EGG : 4 / 5

HAM STEAK : 3 / 5

Main Course:

============

PRAWN RISOTTO : 1/5

(Just had the prawns, the white gravy was really really bad, wasted)

SPAGHETTI WITH MEAT BALLS : 2.5/5

(Meat Balls were tasty, but spaghetti was not cooked properly and was like chewing gum)

GYPSY BEEF ROAST : 2.5/5

(Not roasted properly)

Chapter 2..a total retro mood restaurant ...with a huge retro car, a bike , the staff dressed in retro attire...thumbs up to its ambiance
Service is good
Price is reasonable enough if their buffet is considered 
Food taste needs to improve ...we opted for the lunch buffet..the chicken soup, Irish chicken stew n brownie was really made nicely...the other dishes were ok...the hakka noodles was too dry, chicken stroganoff too sweet, dessert spread not interesting at all...

A 3.5 does justice...not more than that...
Overall a good try..

We had taken their 4course meal which consisted of:
1) House Special Mocktail
2) Any 2 Starters- 2 veg or 1 veg 1 nonveg
3) Main course
4) Desert
In starters we ordered for English Fish Fingers,  Barbeque Chicken Wings, Corn Cheese Balls and Nachos topped with bean and served with tomato salsa. There was another side that was spicy mayonnaise. 
In main course we had Irish Lamb Stew and Lamb Goulash. 
In deserts we ordered for Caramel Custard and Brownie with icecream. 
Food was very average. Did not like the Mocktail that was served. The starters were really good except for the Barbeque Chicken Wings. The main course was really bad. Specially because everything had those Italian flavour and had italian seasonings too. That was bad. The rice served with it was very ordinary. 
Coming to the dersert the brownie was really good but on the other had the Custard was really bad and the presentation wasn't really appealing. 
Service was good but food quality requires much improvement. 
The interior is also beautiful.

Was interested in this place as I found amazing reviews .. but I am sorry to admit the place was nowhere close to the reviews written here . The place will no doubt catch ur attention once you enter giving you a retro feel .. and the live music station. But the food was pathetic and so was the service. The waiting staff was uncooperative and it was extremely hot inside. On complaining they came up with the response that they use the mall air conditioning rather than sorting the matter.

Chapter 2 is quite an impressive restaurant to dine. The interior is good & food is alright according to my taste. As I have been residing in England for quite sometime, hence, the interesting bit for me was to try Chapter 2's English Fish Fry or English Fish & Chips. It is proper traditional English food & here is a bit spicy & the fish was ok as it was my first try. However, I am rating 4 mainly because of the service. Well trained staff, amicable. Keep it up. Will visit again. Thanks for the service.

This place can be rightly termed as the Someplace Else of North Kolkata.
The perfect ambience put up in a much bigger style,more widespread in terms of menu and bar space,and of course well spaced seating arrangement.

Not only that this place has got a brilliant selfie point.A rider and the front engine of a Royal Enfield is what is displayed.

Coming to food we had opted for the 699 buffet where starters were Russian Salad,Nachos,Sea Food Salad.
Moving on to vegetarian dishes there were Crispy Fried Potatoes and the non-veg dishes involved Fried Prawn,Fried Chicken.
Main course had rice and noodles and the deserts had ice-cream(of choice), strawberry mousse and cakes.

We opted for a Bacardi Mojito and a Long Island Ice Tea.
Both the drinks were really good and well prepared.

If I come back to this place again it is for the music and the Cocktails served.
Service was superb and fast and waiters were very friendly.
Management deserves a 5/5.

But it would have better to have some prime dishes and starters.there should try to make veg and non veg buffet menu separated to increase the varieties..main course only had garlic prawn and fried rice as there main items..

Happened to visit this restaurant randomly on a sunday on my birthday for lunch.. i was amazed with the decor and the table was mostly filled with family and friend groups.
The staffs were well mannered and helped detailing the items mentioned on the menu card.
I ordered 2 items which were Asparagus and mushroom risotto and the other one was Chicken steak mushroom sauce.. the quantity was quite alot and we had to pack half of the food.
Their food quality was very nice .. the chicken was well cooked, it was juicy and had awesome flavours.
On the other hand risotto was yummy and the flavour was too good. I had great experience.
Cost for 2 people will be approximately arnd 1000.. this place is value for money.. one of the beautiful kolkata's retro restaurant.

So we decided to go chapter 2 .. the most thing that extremely pleased me was the ambience i would give a 11 out of 10 for ambience..i mean what a classic and retro felling i had.. also to mention about the food the continental were really good but the starter could have been better.. in the main course rice and chow were not that much good but Chinese chicken were good.. the desert was good but not to the mark .. i have added 0.5 for the ambience otherwise its a good place to hang around

Well Oudh 1590 is a brand now for serving excellent biryani's in Kolkata, Chapter 2 is their newest member of their company. 2 days back I came to know that they are offering buffet lunch which is 21 course meal for 399+ tax (481 All inclusive). I decided to try their offerings. 
Finally I was there at yesterday 3:30 pm and opted for the buffet. 
It was quite a disappointment that the meal was too limited, lack of non veg starter, cold food and service was a big let down. 
●From soups and salad I liked the soup, salad was dry, no chicken at all.
●Chilli shrimp was cold and very average. 
●Butter rice and egg chicken fried rice was also cold and hard rice grains were there.
●On the Chicken gravy item there was no chicken we asked twice to fulfill the bowl for the chicken.
●Before having dessert they came to us and asked they are closing buffet so if we need any dessert or otherwise they will closed the dessert section. After agreed for a dessert they served little amount of ice cream, 1 tea spoon of fruit custard,some darsans on a plate. It was a bad gesture from them.
●Before completion of our food they presented the bill. I don't know why they behave like this. Is this from a management process or simply staffs mentality..

With all the mixed reviews, I was spectical of visiting the place. But finally thought of giving it a try. Went on a Sunday afternoon, immediately got a table as there were not many people. Decor is pretty nice with the bike at the entrance, the graphiti on the walls and specially the bar counter with the Cadillac and the tower clock. Live music was also going on.
For the starters I ordered the Corn cheese balls and Devilled Crab. The crab was very tasty, the cheese balls were ok but too much oily for my liking. I decided not to order the steaks as in lot of reviews people said they were not properly cooked. Hence I ordered Chicken Cordon bleu, pork vindaloo and Bekti Florentine. Fish was nice served with garlic bread toast, chicken was also good and stuffed with cheese instead of butter. The pork had a tangy flavour but the pieces were a bit chewy. For dessert we ordered baked alaska, a nice combination of cake, icecream and fresh cream meringue.
The staff was very courteous but the service was very slow and mismanaged. Overall the food was average but the prices were on the higher side, definitely calls for atleast one visit. But there quality and service must be improved.Arundhuti Dutt

This current place used to be another restaurant. If i am not mistaken, it uses to be Square 405 or something. The only new thing added to this place is the statue outside the door, the statue of a bike and then some wall coverings. They also included live band though it wasn't there when we went cause it was monday. Rest, including the table layout was very much similar to the previous restaurant. The staffs were very polite and very well mannered so i liked that. Coming back to the food, we ordered fresh lime soda, english fish fingers, chicken steak and tenderloin steak with mushroom and rosemary sauce. The fish finger was pretty good but i am not happy with the steak at all. I could not taste the mushroom sauce at all. Too less sauce as well. The steak is not properly shaped. Its all loose. I ordered for a medium rare and because of the shape of the steak, it kinda made it look weird. Coming to the desserts, we ordered cheesecake and vanilla ice cream with brownie. I felt the cheesecake was a bit too sweet. The other one was fine. This place is a big NO ( according to me ) when it comes to steak. I am not sure about the other dishes, i hope its good but do not come here if you wanna eat steak. Though the quantity they serve is filling but that alone is not good enough.

Brilliant place.... It takes you back to the old times as KOLKATA.... How park street was in the 80's..... I love this place....Food menu is totally bang-on, it matches the ambience and the time it's framed at. 
I wanna come here time and again.

Finally got a chance to tick this one off the list. Didn't have enough time to explore the menu much, so we just ordered our favourites. 

Cleanliness : 3.5 
Utensils and and the table we first sat in wasn't very clean, so that affected the impression. 

Decor and ambiance : 4 
They did not cut corners in the decor. Every bit of decor looked very good. 

Service : 2.5 
We had to wait roughly 20 min at least before the food arrived. And there weren't that many customers at the time. So they have some room of improvement there. 

Staff : 2.5
While they were courteous, they could improve in being attentive and overall service. 

Live performance : 3.5 
Yes its a little loud for my ears, others might agree, but the singer's voice is sort of soothing and he is a bit underappreciated. People started clapping at end of songs he started playing requests. 

Food : 4 
The chicken tetrazini and chicken stroganoff were really good. I'm at loss of words, one will have to taste for themselves to understand how good it was. When they serve, the quantity doesn't look that much but they both are fulfilling dishes. 
The tiramisu was also amazing. Being the most expensive of the desserts (210/-). It was served in a martini glass. The quantity should be more, and not saying that just because of its amazing taste. Near the bottom it was a little salty which just made us to want to order another. 
But we had somewhere else to be so this first visit was limited. Will be revisiting to explore the menu further.

We, a group of 5 and 2 kids, were looking for a place to relax and have lunch at the Manisquare mall, and decided to enquire whether Chapter 2 had space. There was a young man singing English songs and he had good voice. We requested the manager to turn the volume low as it would disturb my 3 month old kid, and he promptly opened the private lounge for us. The lounge was great with sofas and enough space for the elder kid to run about, and the younger one go to sleep on one of the sofas. Highly appreciated their gesture of opening up the lounge ( I understand they didn't want to lose 5 customers ;) ).

We ordered chicken wings and fish fingers. The chicken wings were coated with thick sauce and was quite tasty. The fish fingers seemed to have been marinated in some alcoholic beverage, but it tasted good. Fish fingers were accompanied by French fries and tartar sauce. For the mains we ordered Irish lamb stew, chicken steak, lamb goulash, meat lasagna and shepherd's pie. The portions were quite good. The food was quite good. I felt they had used some kind of Indian spices in the dishes. However, I thought the stew was a little too sweet. I loved the goulash though. For dessert, we had one cheesecake shared amongst us. 

The interiors have been created in a retro theme, you are greeted with a half motorcycle at the gate, and inside there is a half car. Overall a good experience.

Attracted by the advertisement 21 course buffet at 399, decided to go there with 6 of my friends. We were very late but the stuff members told us that it wouldn't be a problem. The decor and the ambience is very attractive but our experience with the food was not good at all! 1st of all, all the items of the buffet menu were not present. All the items were cold except the TASTELESS soup and the ICE CREAM! Yes it was just cream not ice cream! Overall experience is very unsatisfactory!

Today after movie me and my friend went for a lunch buffet in chapter2.as we entered we saw a giant bike with a man.after that when we entered there completely it was a complete retro style arrangement.one side they have a arrangements for live music(for night only).there was a decor of a vintage car in front of bar completes the retro look.now for food,many of the items are average,but veg cannelloni, chicken soup and sweet chili prawn are too good.there is no French fries.instead of they are having green potato,it doesn't have a good taste.salads r ok.in chicken stroganoff,the chicken is bit hard.in veg Hakka noodles there was a smell of burnt garlic and he noodles is too dry and cold.desserts are average.overall experience is good.price is including tax per person is 480.in 480 the buffet is quite reasonable.but the staffs need to be more courteous and professional.only one person we have met there,Mr.Indranil Bhatyacharya,who have led all the customers in the restaurant was taking care of all of them,their need and quality of food.he gave us the information that in Puja they will open a new buffet menu for Puja special.hoping to see u soon Chapter2.😃

A pretty average ambience, food and live music. Just trying to be a wannabe live music  restaurant won't make u one. 
The food was very average. Order nachos which was like a international Papri chaat. Noodles was very average too. All in all not worth ₹ 1500. 
For vegetarians it's a BIG NO. Options are too limited. For NVs may be a try once. But disappointing.

Why I loved the place:
1. The ambience was very bright, colorful and complemented the theme of culinary offered.
2. The taste and quality of food was very good, especially fish and risotto items.
3. The service provided was nice.

What can be improved:
1. Knowledge of items served should be known by all the staff concerned and this should be encouraged and implemented by the management.

I was wondering why everyone was talking about the AMBIANCE so much, it truly is a sight for sore eyes! The interior decoration is beautiful, the lighting is just perfect and the soft music playing in the background adds up to all this. 
The SERVICE was splendid, the people there were extremely courteous!
Coming down to the FOOD, we took the Chicken Tetrazzini, the Ham Steak and the Beckti Florentine, I can personally vouch for the Florentine and the Steak, comparatively the tetrazzini was ok, I've had better. Frankly it tasted a little bland.

Went there today at noon and had the 21 course buffet spread.the ambiance is very lively yet has a vinage feel.a vintage car model parked in front of the bar and there are comfortable coloured chairs to sit on.at the entrance there is a miniature of a man standing with a bike.
Now coming to the food what they serve for rs 481 (per head inclusive of taxes) is a lucrative deal.4 types of salads(1 egg,2 veg,1 chicken),2 types of soups(cream of asparagus,chicken lemon coriander soup),6 types of starters(garlic bread,sauted veggies,veg chop like something ,oven baked potatoes,panfried fish,panfried chicken),in the mains there were hakka chowmein,burnt garlic fried rice,babycorn florentine,chilli honey prawn,another veg dish,for desserts the options were limited...just had 3 items (darsaan,chocolate mousse,fruit custard).darsaan was okayish buth the other two were just simply wow...both tasted awesome.not that all the dishes served were something extraordinary or extremely delicious but they were pretty decent.the chcken soup,chilli honey prawn, babycorn florentineband the desserts deserve special mention...had a wonderful experience...will definitely go back and try out their ala carte menu.

From the owners of Chowman and Oudh which have successfully wooed customers comes yet another another promising restaurant which caters to our continental taste buds along with a well maintained bar and a live band performance. 

Located on the fourth floor of Mani square, the first thing which caught my attention was the ambience and the theme of this restaurant, they have fairly managed to create a retro style ambience and this being complimented by the live band performance, you are bound to have a good time.  

Now coming to the food, often the case is that when you try to become a perfectionist, you end up compromising on the most important part which in this case was the food and the service. We had ordered a chicken tetrazzini and a spaghetti carbonara and the carbonara was a disappointment as it was lacking in taste and was overly cheesy though the tetrazzini was good with generous portions of chicken. The service too was on the slower side as they took quite some time in serving the dishes! 
 
This place is definitely worth the visit and they have a good variety in their menu with some lip-smacking delicacies which i look forward to try @in my next visit.

We went there a few days back and it was great fun there. This is located inside the Mani Square Mall, 4th floor.

To start with the decor is of the old golden era highlighted with huge cut-outs of Monroe and Presley. There is a car placed near the bar and you'll surely fall in love with everything else. Live song is a great addition where you can request for songs of your own choice. The service people were great.

We ordered Grilled Cocktail Sausage and Spanish Sea Food Salad in starters. The starters were not that great, at least for us. But the best was yet to come: Beckti Florentine. This is insanely tasty and I would recommend all to have this dish. We also had Lamb Pepper Steak which was delicious too but the Florentine was fabulous.

Surely going there again, just for the decor and Beckti Florentine, if not for anything else.

Ah well...got to know about this place from a food column..ambience was interesting..comfortable seating..with a music staion..the bar looked amazing indeed..old school music in the background will lift ur mood....
The staff was extremely well mannered..they greeted us and they know their job well...
Now coming to food..21 course menu..we availed the buffet spread..
The salad section was interesting...egg potato salad good indeed..the chicken caesar salad was a tad bit bland..the kimchi was bang on..
The chicken lemon coriander soup..amazingly delicious..i was so much in love with this..that i even took the soup at the end of my main course..the cream of asparagus soup was also good indeed..
The french fries were crisp and spot on..the veg croquette was amazing..crispy coat..flavoursome inside...
The flavours had a roller coaster ride in the mains...
The babycorn florentine was flavoursome..a bit acidic though..the veg carroline was delicious..the sphagetti in tomato sauce a tad bit tangy..
The egg chicken noodles a bit oil soaked...the burnt garlic fried rice was nice..
The pan fried fish was above average..and the kung pao chicken..a bit bland..cashew and all were good..but still couldnt find the right flavours..
The chilli honey prawn was satisfactory.
I was desperately searching for a gravy side of chicken...but unfortunately it wasnt there..
The mayonnaise was extremely tasty..i took it time and again with salads..sides..mains..
The dessert section was a bit disappointing with limited options..the darsaan was average. .the choco walnut brownie was the saviour..the vanilla only choice in ice cream was not impressive..
So in a nutshell..962 for two including taxes..good experience..

This was my second visit to this place. Honestly I was disappointed by the buffet. They had advertised "21 course" lunch buffet. But by that they included 5 dffererent salads as 5 courses! In chicken Stroganoff, which is always served with butter rice, the rice and the chicken were treated as separate courses. The most disappointing was the dessert, where one item was just Oreo biscuit!
Had this been my first visit I would have given it a far lower rating

Was here recently with a friend and must say that the first impression of the place was extremely positive. The retro ambience was something we had never experienced before and the food was also something of a gastronomic delight. However, the management needs to think more about improving the quality of service, especially the behavior of the staff. They came up with a wrong bill on our drinks and were confident about arguing that we were the ones who had placed a wrong order. When the card payment machine did not take a transaction on three attempts, my card was labelled off as faulty. One the staff even made a dummy transaction with his own card to prove himself correct. Only after I insisted that I wanted them to try it once more did they agree but not before they had asked me to perform the transaction on my own.

If this is the kind of rude behavior they are going to show towards the customers, I won't be surprised if the place starts losing its charm. However if you are willing to put up with this kind of shit in exchange for some lip-smacking food, do give it a try!

I would probably have never visited this restaurant had it not been for a treat. Wonderfully decorated and having an Americana flavor in almost everything, this is surely is a reminder of a beautiful, forgotten world. I had ordered prawn cocktail, grilled chicken and LIIT. Prawn cocktail was somewhere between the classic Mocambo one and the regular hungry tide one. Not the best, but if you are a fan of this dish, then you may have it. Grilled chicken was extremely filling and even a foodie like me didn't have space in his stomach for baked Alaska. The quality was also fantastic. The LIIT was pretty well-made (or I would've asked how could they consider themselves as an Americana themed restaurant). Overall, it was a nice experience. However, someone was performing on the night we went. So, it was a bit loud and I really didn't like it as we could hardly converse at times. The man had a really good baritone though.

After a long time I thought I got hold of a restaurant which makes decent continental food offered on a buffet.Though would say my joy was short lived.The spread as well as the taste of food  was good except a few things which I feel are must haves and need to improve big time. They are way behind on the customer centricity bit which was poor and the waiters were more around gathering up for getting tips before people left  rather than attending to the customers having food.They are yet to evolve in a few things which though costs a meager nothing but should be there if serving a continental spread.They serve hot buns but don't have butter to accompany it,they serve vanilla ice cream with brownie and wouldn't give chocolate sauce even though they have it.Even though I requested for both of these they would say its not a part of the spread.When asked for they have one stereo type answer probabaly taught by the management- "We will pass on the feedback to the Management ".This is the exact same reply I got from both the waiters/attendants,one of who's name I enquired as Satyajit Patra. Disappointed by the service and not the food.

Retro dining re-defined. A perfect place to hang-out with buddies on a lazy weekend afternoon. Authentic Bistro , Stew , Salads , Soup makes you go ga-ga over "Conti" food. Superb ambience , great food , wide view of the bar , a sliced Cadillac adds to the timeless appeal of the period decor.  I liked it very much and will surely comeback.

Me and my girlfriend visited this place today. The ambience was simply brilliant. But speaking for the food quality it was not up to the mark. There was lots of options available in the buffet section though many of them  were uneatable. But still few dishes were really good. Specially the chicken coriander soup was awesome. Anyways its my first time and i will be looking forward to visit this place again. If you are looking for a buffet with many options and in a tight budget this is one of the right places to hang out.

A wonderful place to go out and dine in with your friends and beloved ones! The decor and ambiance are just so mesmerizing! 10 on 10 for that. Coming to the service, again I found it to be very warm and welcoming. Those people came and asked us every time we finished up eating whatever we ordered, about the taste, if we actually liked it or not. Then comes food, we ordered a Deviled Crab to start with and then a Ham Steak. For the drinks, it was a Virgin Mary and a glass of Shiraz by Four Seasons. We ended it up with Tiramisu finally. The star of the day was definitely Deviled Crab! That was just so awesomely done, absolutely mind blowing! The steak was fine, but definitely I've had better quality of ham before. My friend had the Virgin Mary and he liked it, and for the wine, Four Seasons lived up to my expectations again. The Tiramisu was again awesome, I loved it! However, my friend did not like it much and gave it off to me to finish. Pocket pinch is on the higher side definitely. Still, I would definitely turn up in future for tasting other dishes they have on their menu because of the great experience!

This place was a much intended pick after hearing all the praises about its retro decor, complimented by the food. 
We opted for the buffet spread that they have included recently. It was a spread of 18 different dishes with a complimentary glass of wine. Sumptuous as it sounds, the experience however, was not really satisfactory. 
In any buffet, the show stealers are mainly the starters, which here, comprised of a few salads, French fries and nachos, a single kind of soup along with bread rolls and garlic bread. The nachos happened to be bland, cold and weren't crispy at all, however on a request, they served a fresh batch soon. 
The mains included of crispy, chilli shrimps, which were pleasant, noodles, fried rice, butter rice and a single chicken preparation, chilli tofu (disaster) and veg lasagne, which didn't retain its conventional taste.
The dessert section was rather disappointing and with a meagre inclusion of darshan, fruit custard, chocolate mousse and vanilla ice cream, that too without the chocolate sauce. 
Not very satisfied with the spread, we decided to try their signature beef steak, I wouldn't say it was a major disappointment, but I have tried better steaks elsewhere. 
And if we must talk about the decor, it is going to be a pleasant experience, more if you choose to go in the evening. They must, however, really work on their buffet spread as the city has finer options at the pice of Rs 500 or a little more.

Went to CHAPTER 2 last evening (Thursday, Aug 18,2016) without any great expectations. Turned out quite okay. The decor was superb and was a nod to the swinging sixties. If the lighting was a bit muted, I would have liked it even better. The music was a mix of yesteryear pop hits. I requested a few numbers and Mr. Carlton ( if I got the name incorrectly, please excuse!) got them spot on. It was a one-man band,  and I really enjoyed his rendition of "I Saw Her Standing There" and "Man Smart, Woman Smarter". Kudos to him. Well, if you are used to listening to Led Zeppelin or Deep Purple as staple, then this will disappoint you; but this place is not geared for rock fans. Or if you you are vintage enough to remember Pam Crain, it will disappoint you too. But the trick is to keep your expectations low, and the place would grow on you. Even the waiters' dress of polka-dotted shirts were in keeping with the retro effect.  Very good touch. 
Well coming to the f&b: the Screwdriver was okay, but a bit watery. The Planter's Punch ordered by my wife did not live up to her expectations. Ordered Devilled Eggs. That was one sumptuous and brilliant platter.  We had space only  for the 'prawn on toast' which was also quite good. The service was faultless.  So the score was 5 for decor and music, 4 for f&b. One last question though : what is a Mutton Breast cutlet?...Is it the Anglo-Bengali-fication of the Braised Cutlet?..however, the goof-up, deliberate or otherwise, made me smile!

Today was the 2nd time I went to chapter 2.....
1st time was my frnds bday treat where we went for the combo 5 course meal.....apart from the main course chicken carbonara which was mediocre the rest of the starter chicken bar-b-q wings....english fish finger..... cheese balls.....nachos and mushroom cocktail was very tasty......even the desert was gud....be it moose or fudge brownie with ice cream or caramel pudding..... Both the soup were great too.

today with the happy previous exp we went for the newly opened lunch buffet....the experience was just disastrous....
Salads: okay......cold chicken salad was a saviour along with the mayo dip
Soup: both tasty
Starter:
dinner roll...
garlic bread...
French fries
Mushroom corn cheese on toast was gud ..........
.fish pepper was gud.....
Not at all happy with the starter
Last time the starter was the highlight
This time starter was 2 things
Fish and corn cheese mushroom toast 
It was  disheartening. 

Main course:
Prawn Kung pao : thumbs down
Chowmin : worst
Fried rice : normal
Chicken Tetrazzini: gosh .....nobody of us 6 could eat it... Extra salty
Spegeti in red sauce : same as above....
Baby corn : only gud thing
No chicken side dish
The shock came to us when we saw desert
1. Chocolate biscuit with whipped cream and a tulsi leave ( I have no idea how can this be a desert option)
2. Fruit custard
3. Darsan with vanilla ice cream
There wasn't any other option of ice cream
And it had complementary red wine

I feel very less thought was given to the menu
21 course menu and I feel there was nothing to look forward too
They could have alteast give brownie or a type of cake in desert....and what was that biscuit with tulsi and cream as desert ? I have no idea..
No lasagne not even a veg one
No English fish fry
No mushroom cocktai
No chicken bar-b-q wings
I feel they could have chosen a normal drink instead of flashy red wine and alteast give any of the above mentioned item....
For me I am.never going to that place again !!!!!!

All the pics uploaded was from the 1st day and not one of the items were there today.

There were  3 times of salads , both veg n nonveg options!  
Ambience is  CLASSICAL ENGLISH STYLE... Marilyn Monroe n the bar with colourful bottles.. classic car model.. n live band availability --- I totally loved it.

Good ambiance, although visited during the day, so no live music. Tried the the chicken  stroganoff, Irish beef stew and the house recommended cheese cake.  The main course were served with her bed butter rice. Pretty good portions. Chicken stroganoff was well done with nice creamy texture. The amount of cheese was perfect without being too overpowering. Irish beef stew was great. Had a tangy flavor to it. Although not knowing it contains rosemary was a let down for me (not too fond of that particular herb). The beef was nicely done and not stiff at all. 
The cheese cake is why I take away some points. Although it had a decent base and the cheese cake was also almost there, but the fact that it was flat (around an inch maybe) and the Base was almost 30-40 percent of the total width, the taste was more from the base instead of the cake. They need to get the composition right. 
Having said that I quite liked what I had and hence the 4 stars. Will surely come back to try out the pork dishes.

A great bar, 
A superb decorated small place, that's exactly how I would define my first impression about this place. 
Even though they have 18 items in their buffet ( we went there on a weekday), still I will suggest go for a la carte menu. Because the buffet doesn't stick to one cuisine. About our experience, well groomed staff and extremely satisfying service. The waiter himself volunteers to ask you,your feedback about the food  three times during the meal. We had ordered chicken steak. Which was extremely good. Moist two pieces of chicken coated with mushroom sauce, accompanied with caramlised onions. Mash potato was below the chicken hence it didnt have the taste as we wanted, since it was coated with the  sauce. 
The vegetables were crunchy. All in all. The good food was great.
We were told that, live band plays in the evening, which we couldn't hear but over all experience is great. And we shall definitely come back here ;)

I went there today for lunch buffet. It was an eighteen course meal. They also give you a complementary glass of red wine (four seasons). But did I like it? No, the wine was not good! The salads and the starters were good but the main course was not satisfactory. The spaghetti, the chicken preparations, the noodles were not upto the mark! The desserts were good. We had custard, chocolate shot and vanilla ice cream. What did I like the most? The asparagus soup, the veg cannoli, the vegetable cutlet and the desserts! Would I go again? No! But would it is very pocket friendly if you are remarkably hungry which I was (Rs399+Rs80 tax)! Overall it was an okayish experience.

A newspaper article on this restaurant  lead me to this joint.As u enter the place u will be impressed by the decor and ambience. Alas , the first impression didn't persist till dessert.We started with a breezer and a moctail. Our 1st order was prawn coctail.We were served a martini glass full of coctail sauce.We thought may be the prawns went for a dive in the sauce.After much hunting with a fork.We were able to fish out few 3-4 tiny pieces of prawn and few egg slice.As far as my previous experience with this dish go,Prawn coctail usually comes with intact prawns and no eggs.Next we ordered Chicken ala keiv and Pork vindaloo.Ala keiv was okaish but vindaloo was a disaster with two pieces of porkmeat and 5 pieces of pork fat, it was so sour that we couldnot finish it off.If we had n't ordered the entire menu before hand we would have left the place then and there.So, we waited for Baked alaska with apprehension and it was a disaster too.There was not a shred of sponge cake in it.No externational caramelization.We were served an overfrozen fruits with ice cream.All these trash cost us 2000 bugs.I never has such horrible experience in any restaurant in Kolkata.No doubt they were sparsely populated while the other places were overflowing with customers on a busy weekend

I'm giving ratings only for the ambience and decor of the place. It is really charming. The staff was helpful. There was also live band performance which beautifully went with the theme of the restaurant. But we were disappointed with the food. We had ordered Chicken steak with mushroom sauce. They took some time to serve this.Then we literally had to fight with the Chicken. It was really hard and stiff to cut, not soft and juicy at all.We didn't dare to order any other dishes from the menu.

Ambience: The retro ambience is getting trendy these days. All though I was expecting more detailed theme from it. The bar section was attractively decorated and the center clock piece gave the section its retro look. All in all, I would score the interior design and overall ambience a 6/10.

Food: We chose their lunch buffet. The items were mostly continental or european. Although I missed some items I wanted to try from their A la carte menu because of the buffet menu, I still loved the items. We had irish lamb stew and lamb goulash. The stew was light and definitely offbeat. The lamb goulash was my order, I loved it. Definitely something to try out if you go to Chapter 2. The chicken cordon bleu was another gem. The rissotto, the cheese balls ...they werent made casually, you can tell that much at the least.... The chicken stroganoff was comparitively a little less of a competition ( I 've had better chicken stroganoff) they need to work on the mushroom cocktail. If you are a mayo person you might enjoy the taste. The mushrooms were simply dipped in a goblet full of mayo. That was slightly nauseating for me because there was too much mayo. The Desserts were alright. The caramel custard was so so. The brownie with vanilla ice cream was better in texture, taste and amount.

I just couldn't get enough of their items so I ordered their Chateaubriand Tenderloin Steak which as their menu rightfully states, these are classic center cut beef fillet marinated in red wine. We packed it for takeaway order.

Overall: They need to work on the ambience. The also need to include the some spicey items in their buffet along with the bland ones to make a balance because too much of the bland items can make the platter slightly nauseating for many who arent accustomed to the creamy texture. The Items were individually tastey and should definitely be visited....but do try out the al la carte menu if possible because that's where you'll find the real hidden gems of this establishment.

At last found a treasured Book long lost and forgotten and guess what it contains a newly written Chapter as well.. Retro Dining at at the top floor of Mani Square which earlier used to be Square 405.. This place indeed aims to recreate a bygone era of kolkata with all its grandeurs, rock and roll music, some redfined drinks and offcourse Anglo-Indian cuisine which defines the history and culture of this city..
Coming to the ambiance, well they have taken all the pains in detailings, from the Cadillac to the vintage clock, marilyn monroe and elvis on the wall, the orchestra right at the entrance , you will feel like seating in Trincas or Skyroom in the 60s.. However one major flaw was that inspite of such detailing in decor, the seatings and the cutleries don't really match with the retro theme.. Service was just to the point of being average, it was slow, the servers were inexperienced to suggest any dish and even dropped a spoon while serving.. They have a Buffet going on at quite a cheap rate, but since we wanted to taste their signature dishes, so settled for a-la-carte instead..We sampled:
Cold Chicken Salad: It lacked the seasoning needed, apart from that dish was fresh and wholesome..
Prawn on Toast: Something you won't find in every other fine dining joint, an old-favourite.. was surprised to find that they have prepared it with high expertise..loved the crunchiness of the crust as well as the creaminess of the centre..prawns served were also decent in size..loved it totally..
Roast Mutton with Mint Jelly: Honestly, I was a bit scpetic about the softness of the mutton to be served, but once the dish arrived in no time it was savoured with extreme satisfaction.. loved the smokiness of the mutton, the sauted veggies nicely complement the dish and the sweetness of the mint jelly topped the dish to give it a complete flavour.. Passionately Recommended..
Though, I felt a bit sad that owing to the competitions and demands, even a niche joint like Chapter2 is forced to serve a commonplace Buffet, hurting the uniqueness of this place..rest get a taste of old world Park Street in the northern part of the City and savour some of the most amazing and not-so-common dishes.. Our total cheque was Rs.1247/- (all incl.) for 2 people..
Food: 4.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5

I have not heard about this place before going there. Four of us met at Mani Square and then decided to go to this place. I just checked zomato before going here and found that it has 3.7 rating so we decided to dine at this place. This is a retro dining restaurant which attracted us all the more.

Food and drinks:

In drinks we ordered the following:

√ 2 Singapore Sling

√ 1 Long Island Iced Tea

√ 1 Sweet Lime Soda

√ 1 Mojito

√ 1 Red Wine by glass

Singapore sling was a disaster but the Long island iced tea was perfect.

One suggestion for them: Please mention the base drink in your menu card for cocktails so that it becomes easier for us to choose because we are not aware of all the cocktails enlisted in the menu.

In starters we ordered the following:

√ 1 English fish fingers

√ 1 Devilled Crab

Fish fingers were awesome and this was one of the best fish fingers I had till date. Each and every pieces of it were crispy and tasted awesome.

The devilled crab preparation was also fantastic and I personally found it better than the Mocambo one. This was served with two crab shells which had crab meat and both the crab shells were served with mashed potato and vegetables.

In the main course we ordered the following:

√ 1 Chicken Paprika

√ 1 Chicken Carbonara

√ 1 Chicken Lasagne

Chicken paprika had few solid pieces of chicken tossed in red sauce and paprika spices. This was served with rice. It was really good.

Both the chicken lasagne and carbonara were extremely delicious and mouth-watering.

Ambience:

This place gives you a typical retro feeling with live music being played throughout and the walls/ceiling being retro themed.

Service:

Their service and hospitality is really worth mentioning. They even came to us and asked about the food and whether we liked it or not.

Overall:

A fantastic place to dine at with good food, live music being played around and hospitable service.

Chapter 2, a new addition in my favorite list. Friendship day have been celebrated there with  my favorite people. The place gives a retro look,big time. That giant motor bike with a man looks cool in front of the entrance. Place looked too good. Coming down to food we ordered 5 carlsvarg, as they didn't have Budweiser available which is obviously a let down. However we went for carlsbarg and one orange juice. To our shock they provided canned juice not  fresh too bad. Still this rating is only cause of food,which i fell in love with. We started with Chicken a-la-keiv, Prawn thermidor, spaghetti in tomato sauce and grilled chicken. 
Apart from grilled chicken everything tasted beyond awesome. For chicken a-la-keiv the crust was amazing, right amount of blending for spices. I've had  pastas in so many places but this spaghetti was the best so far. And the show stopper was of course the prawn simply loved it. Grilled chicken wasn't very nice. Didn't really go very well with everything we previously had.
On a whole very good experience. Somewhere felt the staffs weren't enough courteous. We didn't ask for the bill, still they placed it. We were hoping for desert. For next time I'd expect better professionalism from the staff.

WoW..!! A splendid new addition to the city's restaurant scene..!! It is on point rather exceeding in its decor with all those vintage bike & car along with marilyn monroe & Elvis presley and the ambience (oh what an ambience!) that would make you come back here again and again. Now lets come to the food...well two words define them LIPSMACKING and VARIETY,well who would have imagined a lasagna along with kimchi in the same buffet spread..!! Another thing that I liked a lot is,here they have a different buffet menu for each day which is so unlike the leading buffet restaurants of the city. 

We went here on a fine Wednesday and the spread included---
Red Wine/Fresh lime soda was offered to us
Potato-egg salad
Caesar Salad
Kimchi 
Garlic Bread
Bread Rolls which looked like Challah bread
Tomato Soup
Chicken Noodle soup
French Fries
Nachos with Tomato Salsa
Chicken Drumstick
Veg. Lasagna 
Butter Rice
Egg-Chicken Fried Rice
Chicken Noodles
Fish in garlic butter sauce
Prawn Chilly
Darsaan
Brownies
Ice cream

Heaven it is..!!! But personally  I would prefer a bit more on the dessert section and a chocolate sauce along with the brownies for sure (0.5 deducted for that,Sorry but I had to).Putting that apart,this place definitely deserves a visit. So when you just want to relax and have a great time....do come here I am sure you won't be dissappointed. Chapter 2 Keep up the good work guys..Cheers..!!

Apart from ambience & music, nothing satisfactory. Service is quite slow and unorganised. Staff are not trained properly. Tried Crab Meat Soup - good, Chicken mimi breast cutlet- over fried, prawn cocktail- very disheartening,  Bhetki lemon grill- very dry, Lamb pepper steak- ok, Caramel custard- problem with texture. Hope it improves.

The only place in my dine-line where I visited twice! First time, it was mesmerising, such great ambience, such great music, amazing decorations, great retro vibe, servers were courteous! 5/5
Then came the food, I had a crave for an amazing steak for as long as I can remember, I could care less if it's a well done or medium rare! I just wanted to have a delicious steak, so when my order of ham steak came I was blown away! The presentation was amazing! It looked like a dish from a 5 star restaurant! Now I never had steak so I can't tell if it could have been better or not but it was very delicious! I also had watermelon daiquiri, and again presentation was awesome! It was 4.5/5 experience. I just couldn't wait to come again!
However when I did it was a total let down! The second time i went to try out other stuffs on the menu! I ordered lamb chop and my sister ordered shepherd's pie! My chops were very rubbery, the there were some wonderful flavours but the meat was really bad! Shepherd's pie too was an okay dish (it had lamb too). We also had fish fingers, which were nothing special! But presentation wise again they rocked, but the food....Chapter 2, I know you guys can do much better than this, you guys have such potential, I fell in love with your place when I first visited, but today the food made me very very sad.

Located in a corner on the top floor of Mani Square mall, it can easily miss a casual glance. The interiors are brightly lit and themed as retro pubs (saw them only in movies,so can't compare). Went there on a Sunday night when the in-house band was belting out beatles and oasis. A bit overpriced liquor keeping the cost of decor at par. Food was pretty good, though the menu didn't have nothing special to offer. Music and 'proper' company will make your visit worthy!
Liked the manager stepping for a 'Jamaica Farewell' treat

Headed down to the place on Sunday for lunch. A quick summary, satisfactory food, not very impressive, slow service and good ambience. 

Food & Beverage: To begin with, the drinks menu served as of date included only one domestic beer (Kingfisher Ultra) which too was unavailable. We settled for Carlsberg. For starters we wanted to go for the 'Corn Mushroom Tomato Tart', but that too was unavailable. Considering it was the second consecutive item on the menu that was unavailable, it proved to be a tad bit turning off. Chose 'Corn and Mushroom on Toast instead, which was well prepared and no complaints on the note. 
For mains we ordered: 1) Grilled Beckti and Prawn Steak. Although the portion of this main in specific was extremely small, the dish made up for it in taste. Quality of the sea food tasted fresh. 
2) Asparagus & Mushroom Risotto. Extremely large and sufficient portion. The dish didn't fall short on any note.
3) Chicken Steak Mushroom Sauce: Extremely disappointing dish. The quantity was large but the chicken was extremely dry and fibrous. The description mentioned 'topped with creamy mushroom sauce', however there was no sight of the same, nor was any mushroom sauce served on the side as opposed to other restaurants in the city serving continental food. The mashed potatoes served were too grainy to even eat. 

Ambience: The unique selling point of the venue is 'Retro Dining' and the interiors corroborate the same. The place has the provision for live bands. On our visit, a gentleman was at the mic who was also interactive enough to take requests from fellow diners.    

Service: Although the staff is friendly and courteous, the restaurant seemed to be extremely understaffed. Service was extremely slow and waiters were scarce, so much so that the table adjacent to ours was struggling to summon a member of staff. 

Overall, not a very pleasant experience with respect to food. The venue definitely needs to up their game on the front. Hope the review motivates the management to work towards the same. 
Cheers!

I visited here twice, and both visits were on two consequetive saturday afternoons. This is the newest addition to the array of restaurants in mani square and my experience here both the times had been fabulous. The theme of this place is retro and their decor speaks largely of it.The place is spacious with an amazing ambience which is young yet vintage at the same time. The staff  here were very polite and welcoming in nature. Jumping straight to their  food, the first time we went in a group of three and being unsure about the quantity we ordered for 3 of their speciality dishes, those being gypsy beef roast, ham steak and irish lamb stew. The second time we went our order comprised of  a chicken stroganoff, a mutton caserole and mutton roast in mint jelly. The gypsy beef roast and the ham steak was my favourite amongst all the dishes. The ham steak ( the dish i ordered) was cooked beautifully. It was cooked medium rare wrapped in an omlette along with veggies and mashed potatoes and it was the perfect dish. My friend ordered gypsy beef roast and i loved the barbequed flavoured sauce it was tossed in. He and I enjoyed the dish but my other friend didnt seem to enjoy it much and she found the beef to be a little chewy. Another gem was the irish lam stew. Honestly i have never tasted a dish so light and delicious at the same time. It was an ensemble dish wih parsley butter rice and the lamb stew and the flavours in it were amazing. The lamb was so soft that it melted inside the mouth within minutes. My friend who ordered this was superhappy with her choice. For my visit here the next time i went with the safe choice of chicken stroganoff and it did not disappoint me. The chicken were portioned into little pieces and cooked beautifully in the sauce. It was extremely soft and yum and went great with the rice which was served along with it. One of my friend ordered roast mutton with mint jelly. Though he liked the dish, i dont particularly enjoy the flavours of mutton and mint ( but this is comepletely my personal aversion). Also i found the mutton to be very chewy which was disappointing. The mutton caserole was however amazing. It had ample minced lamb and and mutton pieces with cheese and it was baked to utter perfection. But the star was the cheesecake we had here. I have never tasted a cheesecake so delicious in my life. It was soft and fluffy and one bite of it felt like total bliss inside the mouth and literally gives you a taste of heaven. This will be a must order from my side for all the future visits.The The only glitch of this place is their service. They take forever to serve the order and it becomes a tad bit annoying, when you are hungry. Nevertheless, this is a new place and has ample room for improving their service time. But their food served is of top notch( also the presentation of the dishes)and i would highly recommend it to all foodies out there. I myself cant wait to go back and try some of their other enticing items.

We asked for spaghetti with tomato sauce but it was not available so we had to settle for vegetable spaghetti instead. For dessert we didn't have anything since we wanted to have Baked Alaska which  was  not available either.

The decor takes your breath away. The plus point has to be the vintage car in front of the bar and the old clock so remniscent of the 50s. It has a nice vive going on. Tables are well spaced so you don't actually spend half the time overhearing other peoples conversation. We ordered a mushroom cocktail which was tangy and sweet just in right amounts. The lasagna was excellent with right proportions of all the ingredients., the cocktails were good. Nothing out of ordinary. But the place will give you a feel good vibe. Definitely worth visiting. Ll be down there again.

This is one of the most interesting places I have been to around Salt Lake area. The interior setup and the theme was amazing. The bar shelve left me awestruck. The entire place looked wonderful. And the retro music that they played stretching from rock to country was in keeping with the setup. The menu was well prepared. The chicken wings were as good as it can be.. the lasagna tasted good, however the steak wasn't up to the mark. But considering all three of them, the food was good enough. I will say this is one out of the box kind of restaurant that I had tried and was delighted to do so. I will recommend this place to people going with families or friend circles or even casual hangouts, because this place has much to present.

Went for out office party

Ordered beer first. They serve with cheese bites which is exciting

Mocktails were good. Fruit punch and blue berry were really good


Coming to starters. They rocked it. Be it nachos with tomato salsa or the devilled crab or the prawn cutlets,everything was innovative and perfect

The main courses were disasters
Salty, burnt and they used substabdard material to serve
Ham steak was disgusting. Dont know if that was even ham. Beef roast was salty.
Lamb chops were all rubbery and hard

Chicken a la kiev was the standout of them all

Service is a tad slow and the waiters are not that well versed

Music is good on fridays as well
Overall, a one time visit is perfect

I have been hearing praises about this place ever since it opened up on the fourth floor of Mani Square Mall, and this afternoon finally decided to pay a visit. The place becomes alive with live music in the evenings, but our lunch over there was an equally enjoyable experience! A retro-themed ambience with pop icons and legends like Elvis and Marilyn Monro statues, a huge grandfather clock adorning the wall and a model of a bentley in front of the bar with blue and yellow chairs dotting the place makes for really classic decor! They provide a continental non veg five course lunch at Rs.350 and one of us opted for that- among the varied choices, we had cream of chicken soup, corn cheese balls, english fish fingers, lamb goulash and caramel custard! Though the portions were a bit less, the presentation and taste of each one of them was impeccable. Also, we had pineapple crush, Long Island Iced tea and Cosmopolitan along with starters like grilled cocktail sausages and pepper chicken wings, which were quite the crowd-pleaser! Our main course consisted of mutton casserole and chicken carbonara- the carbonara pasta was all delicious and creamy and the casserole tasted a lot like meat lasagna, but we were not complaining as we thoroughly enjoyed the mouth-watering combination of the meat and cheesy flavours! We ended our meal with chocolate brownie and vanilla ice cream! The service is very prompt and the staff very helpful. Really looking forward to visit again during evening hours!

Ambience
This eatery is one of the most stylishly designed places we have ever been to! Adorned with antiques and musical instruments with whacky lights, the décor is sure to take your breath away.

Service
The staff is extremely polite and friendly and well equipped with the information regarding the dishes listed on the menu card.

Appetizer
We opted for Devilled Crab which in one word was a beauty.!! The shell was smoked and the crab meat was cooked to perfection and blended delightfully with cheese. The dish was served in an extremely palatable manner and additionally a sauce had been given which was a pleasant surprise to the taste buds. The flavours had been beautifully added to the meat, making it a venture worth the effort.
We strongly recommend this dish!

Cocktail
Piña colada was our pick. The base was white rum, and the presentation was top notch. You might like to try this one.
(4/5)

Mocktail
Mexican Sunrise managed to catch our eye on the menu card, and so we ordered for it. It was a very refreshing drink, and good enough to wash down the meat we savoured.

Main course
We ordered for chicken roast, which took our heart away! Exotic flavours, succulent meat, and appropriate garnishing were the highlights of this dish.

Went there for a Saturday lunch. We ordered Chicken Stroganoff (thick creamy curry of chicken with mushrooms and vegetables, served with rice. It was good but not so great) and Grilled Beckti and prawn steak (this was fingerlicking tasty, served with boiled vegetables).
The quantity is not sufficient for lunch, except for those on strict diet and consume food calculating on gram unit :P
Ambience is good, service too.

Do not come here if you have any taste. Meats including pork, beef were dry. Gravies were terrible.  Seafood overcooked. Do not come here. Horrible.

Well want to outlay least amount word on this as possible. Trash dinner, have least to offer on the name of luxury retro dinning. Only the live Orchestra that too comprised of solo singer singing pop all day long I guess. The service is pathetic. And to top it all we had a strand of hair in our meal. Had a worthless experience. If you still consider this place, try take a mediclaim first.

Its situated in top floor of Mani square. Divine metro style place with good looking ambiance. I love the theme. I have gone for their 5 course lunch meal. Its good & pocket friendly. .. They served a mocktail complimentary on first which was pathetic. Afterwards the other dishes are fine in texture and eye appiling.Taste wise its acceptable.It can be better. Staffs need to be more trained.

Me and my friends visited this place last week without any prior planning. We have tried all the restaurants in mani square apart from this so wanted to give it a go. It was Saturday afternoon and the place was moderately filled up and they gave us the option of sitting anywhere we wanted though we were a group of 3 still they did not limit our options (definitely a good gesture on their part). The bar area had a cool vintage appeal to it and i am sure it looks much better in evening. we took some time in ordering and i think that was a mistake as they really took long to serve their food.  We were unsure about their quantity but still went for 3 main course for each one of us deciding to order more if we are not full. my friends ordered ham steak, gypsy beef roast and i was in the mood for having some stew so i chose the irish lamb stew which was their specialty also one fresh lime soda. Then our patience were put to taste as they took really long to serve the food but our hopes were really high as we were watching the food served on our neighboring tables and by the look of it we knew they were really good.At last our food came and the quantity served was so satisfactory and not only that but the presentation of the food was also great. 

#The ham steak had their house special pepper sauce which was really tasty and the steak was cooked really well and it was very soft. Overall a good dish. 
#The Gypsy beef roast was not as per my liking also presentation wise it was the least impressive one. The meat was chewy though the barbecue sauce gave a nice touch to it but the dish was quite monotonous. 
#i absolutely loved the Irish lamb stew which was served with rice. the dish was so refreshing and the balance of that thick broth was perfect as it was not very heavy on the stomach nor very light. The lamb pieces were soft but nevertheless the broth was the hero of the dish and the rice served along with it brought the dish to another level. it can rightly be said to be their special dish. Recommended
I was very happy with the main course and though i was very full but still i wanted to try out their special dessert i.e. the cheesecake. The dessert looked amazing and let me tell you it was one of the best cheesecake i have had. It was so perfect, so satisfying that inspite of me being full to the brink i could have finished it alone. The base was also amazingly good and oh my god am salivating writing about it and i would definitely go back for this dessert itself. Definitely Recommended
Maybe i would have rated the place a bit less but this dessert just won my heart and i would recommend it to others. the staffs are well behaved last but not the least the fresh lime soda was also well prepared. our bill amount was approximately 1700 and only a tax of 200 was included which according to me was less when compared to other places.

I visited this place with a friend a few days earlier. The first thing that you really notice about the place is the decor. It is simply amazing! Most of the points can be given for that alone. They do have an interesting menu. We had egg benedict, chicken steak and schnitzel. The egg benedict was good. But I was not impressed by either the schnitzel or the steak. The food was a bit too salty for my taste. The staffs were really courteous though. Well if variety is your spice of life, then this place can be given a chance.

Went on a family dinner.Great ambience with live music.Just as you browse through the Menu card ,you will get to read how the place is trying to imitate or "mimic" the night life experience of Park Street, Kolkata, in its 60's,70' and '80s and rightfully does it live up to that expectation.Food ofcoarse ,alas ,speaks a different story. Ordered a Shepherd's Pie which was nowhere close to a pie (😷). Mince meat(read Mutton Keema) topped with (not even generous amount) mashed potato at the centre. My aunt ordered a lasagna and guess what they used the same minced meat mixture for stuffing...single layer of cheese,2-3 pasta sheets and that's it , you are done....really??
I mean with that ambience u can surely do much better,come-on. The only dish which came out as a hero was the bhetki fish in lemon sauce.
A-la-carte really are mostly disappointing .Heard a different story about the lunch spread though. Can try that out too on my next visit. 
But if someone likes to drink,relax and listen to good music ,then this is the place to go. You never know their starters might surprise you, albeit in a good way 😉

Unplanned visit to this resturant. Ordered a minestrone soup, nice flavour of the basil leaves, but a bit excess of the basil which was corrected by adding some sugar I guess. The soup was very sweet and did not quite enjoy it. Tried the grilled chicken steak....chicken steak??? Well it was well done with some mushroom sauce which kept it nice and moist. Also tried the fish and prawn steak.... Again fish and prawn steaks?? Well it was well done again, wish the quality of the prawns and the fish were better. I mean mayb tiger prawns and a bhedki....that would really enhance the taste. The highlight was some live music by this one man band which was quite impressive playing some retro numbers. Overall a good place but a huge scope for improvements. Some improvement in the raw material would take them a step higher on the ratings. Can try.

My first visit here was last week and I've had food in various places nearby but not as bad as this was. The interior is good, the sitting arrangement is nice the decor is retro, everything seemed to be fine till the food came up. We had a buffet lunch and to be very frank not one of them tasted upto the mark. The chicken tasted nice, The soups were disastrous, pasta was even worse and the Nachos with chees or what ever that was, a blunder. Never expected such quality food from a place that looks as good as this. Really hope to have better food on the next visit.

The food is better than average but not the best so deducted 0.5. A good place to hangout with friends where pocket pinch wont be high !!


My second visit on 11th December...with school friends.. another promising live performance and delicious food. We always spend quality time her. Love the place.

A New Restaurant in my locality! Chapter 2 had just opened a couple of months back and was ideal for a Lunch out when my sisters came to visit! 

Pleasantly surprised at the Interiors and Retro Decor with the brightly colored chairs and during the day, the almost entirely naturally lit dining area. I admit Elvis & Marilynn could have been done without but they added to the fun element; 

Food was disappointing though they had a decent Menu;  a nice Cream of Chicken Soup with an assortment of Starters, Vegetarian & Non- Vegetarian. A Mushroom Cocktail - quite awesome & the Herb Crusted Chicken was good, as were the Fish Fingers; the beverage that came with these, however, was dreadful - synthetically flavored without a hint of fruit and sickly sweet to boot; 

 Chicken Carbonara was dry and lifeless & the Chicken Stroganoff was just about alright. Even their Desserts were very mediocre. 

I have to comment on how reasonable this place was - we were served an enormous amount of food at very good prices. 

What was great was the extremely pleasant members of the staff;  
And oh yes, they have Live Music in the evenings; we missed that but were playing Kristofferson - I'd go back for that, if not for the pasta!

My advice to the Owners - You have a good set of people working for you; TRAIN them to excel; Train them to present the food beautifully; Teach them the finesse that is integral to a really great food place. This could become a truly WONDERFUL Restaurant.

One of the few newly opened retro themed restaurants in Kolkata,Chapter 2,reminds you of the old charm of the erstwhile Kolkata.It once used to be the hub of a glittery nightlife,starting from the British era till the late 70s.This was a period. when Calcutta could boast of not only it’s rich heritage,but also it’s glamorous nightlife,which for most cities,was undiscovered.One of the most popular places in Calcutta,Park Street,had some of it’s iconic restaurants of that time

If possible I would have given 6 stars. The decor is just wonderful as is the ambience.  Both go perfectly well with the theme of the restaurant. As for the food, we had the five course combo meal. The food was just immensely good. Consistent, smooth, tasty and uniquely served. The price is also pretty affordable even for students. The staff are very well mannered, and the head waiter visited each n every table many times to personally ask feedback about the food. Portions are nice. Allover it's a wonderful experience, a must visit for all food lovers.

The ambience of the place and the interiors are really good and vibrant. The service is pretty good and smooth. We had ordered the Non-veg combo meal. The mocktail wasn't good at all. The spanish clear soup was good. The nachos and BBQ wings for starters were good. Go for these two only. The cheese balls aren't as good. Then we had Irish lamb stew,Lamb goulash,and Chicken strangonaf. All of them were really tasty. And for desserts the brownie wasn't available and out of the custard & the mousse I loved the mousse. The quantities are less but for a 5 course meal at 350 it's absolutely worth it. The food is average.

But when u entered into the restaurant ur worst time started, the staffs are pathetic , they don't even know the proper hospitality. And the manager don't even know how to manage customer. We have ordered beer and chilli bhetki prawn steak. We have completed our beer long ago , after 1.30 hrs later they delivered the food . I would never suggest anyone to visit here. ... atleast they should bring trained manager and staff here

This place is located on the 4th floor of mani square. And this place was on my wishlist for a long time and father's day had to be the day where I visit this place. To start of, decor is wonderful and soothing music in the background overall the ambience is impeccable and the staff and manager was very welcoming and friendly 😇 But the main thing was food and it did not disappoint me one bit. The food was gorgeous and delicious. And the price was modest. This is one restaurant which will probably be my new favourite restaurant. Can't wait to visit again ❤ Till then staying hungry 😋

The USP though is the live music playing at the restaurant which is delightful and exciting for music enthusiasts... Though they play only retro themes and music it feels good to transport through the different ages of music... Delicious food+ soothing retro ambience+great live music+ great service = a great dining experience.. And a must visit!

Chapter2 ,a continental delight in mani-sqaure 4th floor. Went on a lunch and found the decor themed on old world charm ;retro. Elvis and Marilyn Monroe figurine embossed in wall,there is a separate section for live music(probably didn't started); bar counter always neatly decked in vintage car style,colourful cushioned chairs ,sofas makes it a very unique and wonderful decor.
We ordered chicken Hawaiian salad,grilled lemon beckti & grilled prawn. Salad was good and tasty with some fruit wrapped in , the grilled item was prepared well with some salads and small portion of buttered rice & it can feel 1 or 2 person. I must say the food quality was good. Service wise they are very eager it seems and does up to the mark , but one cause of concern is the time between your order and getting the food on table. Expect not less than 35-40 minutes waiting for your food when there was no such rush. Of course the food quality makes up but this has to come down considerably. otherwise cheers for a good continental delight.

Had dinner in Chapter 2 yesterday,  lovely experience with so good food,  surely a good competition to old playerss like Mokambo Peter Cat, if not good in some cases, Prawn on Toast is just heaven on earth, steaks are also good, they have some retro dishes which are hard to find in Kolkata. Ambience goes with the menu, but the live music is sometime loud enough to destruct your experience,  may be they should select some soft rock and country blues, however a must go for the people who love continental and Anglo Indian dishes, will visit again to explore the menu.

Here's continuing my review after 2nd visit. Quality of food has come down but crowd has increased. While some attendants are extremely helpful others sly off with a smirk. Music was ok today. So from 4.5 to 3.5.

Date of review 06-06-2016. I went to this place 3 days ago for a surprised lunch after movie at cinemax.

Ambience: The ambience is good with decoration in retro style. Nice and spacious. The front bar counter is attractive. It also had space for orchestra (which was not working when i was there).
Overall rating for ambience 8/10 .

Food : I went for a combo offer serving continental 5 coure lunch (picture of which is availble in menu section). It contained 1 soup, 1 mocktail, 2 starters, 1 main course and a dessert. Overall taste of food was good and something different to taste. It was worth having a lunch at this place. Quality of the food was good whereas quantity was something which dissapointed me a bit. It was just enough for a single stomact but I guess it was beacuse of the combo offer. They must be serving well for a la carte.
The service was a bit messy in the beginning due to some confusion amongst the waiters but was smooth later on. The staff was co-operative and service was prompt.

 Overall for the total experience it was worth going. Had a nice lunch.
Overall rating : 8.5/10.

We visited this place for a lunch on weekend. Surprising the place were almost empty. The interior is very impressive and totally goes with the theme of the restaurant. The staffs are very courteous. They serve continental only. We ordered two main courses, one is prawn and another is ham. Both the item were very well cooked. Specially the ham was very tender and soft. I liked the meshed potate also. It was different from what we get in other restaurants. Veggies were fresh. Alcohols are little over priced. And they do have a set up for live music.

I grew up hearing my parents talk about Park Street in its heydays in the 1950's,60's and 70's .... about Pam Crain and Usha Uthup .... Firpos , Bluefox, Skyroom , Trincas and Mocambo. Thankfully I am old enough to have eaten in all of them back in the 70's since I come from a family of foodies. I was quite intrigued when I hear about Chapter 2 from a friend and was told that it was influenced and inspired by the Park Street Restaurants  .When I finally visited I fell in love with the ambiance and vibe as soon as I entered .... the decor is retro and amazing and I was totally tripped out on their Bar section. We had been invited for a private event so I could not take too many pictures of the food but we really enjoyed the Ham,Bacon and Potato Salad , Prawn on Toast , English Fish Fry , BBQ Chicken Wings , Pork Spare Ribs Caesar Salad , Corn Cheese Balls and Chocolate Mousse. I absolutely loved the Ham,Bacon and Potato Salad , Chicken Wings and Prawn on Toast. They have a comprehensive menu and I can't wait to go back and explore more. A live band plays on the weekends and they were really good so if your looking for a great place to chill , eat and drink look no further than Chapter 2.

After reading the reviews and hearing lots of good things about the place we decided to give it a go on a Friday lunch. The place has nice peppy interior - boosts a feel good factor ! For a weekday lunch - the place had managed to pull decent crowd. Elbow space is just about okay. The waiters were polite but a little over helpful. We ordered for prawn on toast , deviled crab and fish newburg, accompanied with fresh lime soda. We wanted to have roasted duck which they say they ran out of stock. Also, there was only brownie available for desert which we decided to ditch. The service time was tolerable - as opposed to the feedbacks and our own apprehension. The crab dish was superb! A must have at the place as I had heard the recommendations. fish was good and serving portion was quite generous. the prawn on toast however was a bit let down though - the bread was a bit chewy and the batter tasted little more tangy than I would have liked. Overall pocket pinch was 1500 for two people - feels a bit on the edge for the quality of the food.

The place gives a retro feeling like it's mentioned in it's name! There is a live singer throughout who played the Birthday song for my friend since it was her birthday and we had to celebrate it there. The decor is cool! A soothing feel what I experienced after entering the place. The food was also good! We had ordered preparations of chicken, lamp, pork and beef and all were satisfying!

Great experience since we entered the place. The food was worth the wait. Had macaroni and lasagne, with the creamiest cheese. Definitely worth coming back to.

Last Wednesday we thought of having Continental food, CHICKEN TETRAZINI being my favourite. Keeping in mind of the time, late evening we did not wanted to visit One step Up, hence we visited this Restaurant. The Ambience.... AMAZING!!!! But, the food... OMG, where did I land up to!!! It was an absolute failure. The Chicken Tetrazini had vry less of cheese. It actually did not taste as I wanted to please my taste bud with. I guess, I will not refer any of my friend or family member to visit this place any more.

Calcutta, (yes, that’s the name I prefer) was the hub of glittery nightlife from the 1940s till the 1970s, when the city would party all night long at Park Street, while most other cities would still be mostly unaware of the eclectic mix that good food and good music can be. But today, most of those places, which used to be the hotspots of those glorious yesteryears, like the Blue Fox or the Sky Room, have either closed down, or like the Trincas, have come to be only a shadow of what they were.
                                                                ...

I had lunch on 30th April with my daughter. The decor is really good. However, they took ridiculously long time to serve the food and quality of food was substandard. Poor quality continental food.

Chapter2, a new restaurant opened in the place of the most horrible restaurant Square 405.

The restaurant was empty and we saw some groups went in n walked out immediately! But still we decided to give it a try!

We planned to take the combo meal of Rs420 (non veg). It's not a buffet! They will serve on the table and the items were limited to one plate to each person!
You have to choose one soup, two starters, one main course per person!

There was no other customer in the restaurant but they served after 40-50mins! waiters seemed so busy, doing nothing huh!!

The tradegy started when they served the starters. We were told in the reception that we'll get, one soup each person, two non veg starters each person ! But they never told that one person wil get one non-veg n one veg starter! We took non-veg meal but we can't choose all from non veg menus! We hav to take veg!

Why should I pay for veg??
Why will I not be able to choose items from non-veg- menu when I opted for non veg meal???

They served one non veg starter n one veg! When we complained the waiter rudely asked us to leave if we don't take veg!

Had a horrible experience!
They just have a good ambience n nothing else!

We walked out of the restaurant!
Such a cheat!!

This was a much awaited dinner and we were looking for a new place. Read a few reviews about Chapter 2 and went to Chapter 2. Decor was good enough and the welcoming also, so 2 rating. Rest is history. In total we ordered three dishes but the time they took to serve them was humongous and it was not even half occupied at that moment. Literally we could have gone to another restaurant and could have eaten something and come back. Food was also not that satisfying neither in terms of taste or in terms of quantity. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to any one. They need to understand time is of essence.

After seeing the rave reviews on Zomato, i pursued my friends to visit this place. it is situated on the 4th floor of mani square, in the area which saw previous two restaurants failing miserably (the previous one was square405). it welcomed with a bike in the entry area. the decor was in line with the retro theme. the restaurant was not that big. the staffs are very courteous. there is a music pad where i suppose live music happens but it did not tge day we visited. coming to menu, it serves continental food. we ordered chicken steak in mushroom sauce, Kolkata betcki in lemon sauce and juicy pork ribs. the steak amd the rib came with mashed potato and vegetables. the food presentation was ordinary as well as tge taste. the portions areless compared to the price. the pork was not at all tender and the fat was not good as well. o ly the fish was a saving grace but comes ib a very tiny quantity. the real killer is the time taken to serve. it was 45 minutes after which i had to ask whether they forgot our order or not. even they took 15 mins to give bill. overall a bad experience and will give it a miss in the future.

It's a good place to be.  Service wise alright. Live band - well since the place is very small so the singers singing loudly is a discomfort. Roasted chicken had no taste at all so kindly have a check. A one time visit is fine.

Great food, good portions, extremely affordable, electrifying music & quirky ambience. Chapter 2 comes as a breath of fresh air to the conservative Kolkata soil. Live music adds to the charm of this place where the makers have taken small details into account. The chicken liver pate is to die for. Next time will try the desserts...a must visit for foodies! Check out the quirky & informative menu card.

We went there to have dinner on a sunday night.The ambience was electrifying with live performance by a band playing retro songs.Coming to the food,the assortments are continental.We had chicken paprika,vegetable au gratin, and tiramisu.The tiramisu was tasty but i must say at 225 it was quite overpriced.

"Monica.. Oh my darling"- We all remember this famous song from the movie Junglee by Shammi Kapoor or May be "Piya tu ab toh aaja" from Caravan or some names from Hollywood to mention like The very popular Godfather series... Or may be a bit recent ones like Once upon a time in Mumbai or Gunday .. They all have one thing in common and no points for guessing ..Yes!! It's the RETRO theme which is the common part between all of them.

To enjoy and relive the retro dining experience you have to come down to the newest culinary destination of Kolkata i.e. CHAPTER2.

USP:
-> Ambiance
-> Food speciality of Anglo Indian cuisine
-> Live music performance
-> Marvellous Decor
-> Reviving the memories from the old city of joy

**Location**
Located at the Mani square Mall's top floor this place is very easy to locate.

**Ambiance & Decor**
The name and the look n feel from outside will give you a hint some hint about the ambiance but the moment you enter the place the decor will just blow you away with their signature retro styling and the grand film like set design. Having said that I would mention National Award winner art director Mr. Nitish Roy was given the responsibility for designing the place with his master touch.. WOW, now that's what I call a master move.. Brilliant :)

**Food**
With great atmosphere comes a great responsibility to serve some lip smacking dishes which can be take the level to remarkable. And indeed they fulfill this scene too. I had tried quite a number of their signature dishes as a part of the food tasting event and would like to mention and refer them as well.

Soups:
Tomato basil soup: Tomato soup with Basil fragrance was making a perfect mix.

Seafood chowder soup: A rich creamy soup with seafoods

Mocktails:
Very refreshing and presented well..the layers were very prominent and eye catching.

Kiwi blast
Mexican sunrise
Cranberry cooler

Appetizers:
Prawn on Toast: A MUST TRY here... Try this to know it.. That's their signature dish is all I can say.

Chicken liver patte: Chicken liver paste on the pattern bread with Mayo dip .. Nicely done.

Mains:
Devilled Crab: Though it is a signature dish from one of the famous restaurant in the city but this is quite tasty here as well made and presented in their style.

Pork vindaloos:
Pork lovers must not miss this dish at all. Rich pork curry with herbed rice added it was giving my taste buds a yummilicious journey.

Irish Lamb stew:
Soft lamb stew with very simple rice accompanying with it is surely you will love to have.

English fish fry:
Very well made fresh fish fry rather I can say the fish n chips to be very specific.

Bhetki lemon grilled:
Thick pure bhetki fish fillets cooked in lemon butter sauce served with mashed potatoes and veggies added to it is a perfect one for fish lovers of the city.

Desserts:
Cheese cake
Very well presented and very simple yet an exotic one to conclude your meal. Recommended...

**Experience**
It was all together an awesome experience here. The people serving you are very well trained and extremely polite which I liked the most. With the warm hospitality they are well dressed too. Keeping the theme on mind their costume has been designer too. Designed by non other than very popular designer Agnimitra Paul which adds glamour to its class for sure.
In the end I would like to thank

Located at the top floor of Mani Square just beside Shack Lounge, this newly opened Retro Pub just made our day! We went on a scorching Sunday afternoon to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and I was bit nervous of how it would turn out to be, mainly because it was my idea of visiting the place. But I was elated as Chapter 2 totally lived up to our expectations. The place only serves Continental Food and trust me it serves you the authentic continental taste. We started with 'Devilled Crab' which turned out to be delicious. Later we ordered 'Tenderlion', which is actually a steak made out of buffalo meat. It was also equally good. Didn't seem we were sitting in Kolkata.
The place gets bonus marks because of the ambience which is really classy and well decorated. Although, the AC was malfunctioning a bit. Nevertheless, I felt the place requires to hire the waiters with more care. The staffs are not much acquainted with the dishes and thus cannot help you choosing the right one. So u have to decide that all by yourself. Thank god we got lucky!
The place might appear bit expensive as our bill was almost touching 1 K with just one starter and another main course. But it is completely worthy I felt as the food will utterly captivate you.
Highly recommended place. Please pay a visit.

Last Friday we thought of going to some place and booze and we ended up at this place. From outside this restaurant looked quite interesting. The ambience as well was great , but the live music thing was quite irritating. After having a long day at work , so much of loud music is pain to the ears. But the hospitality and interiors were was great. The quality of food was good as well. We had ordered for the below items :

• Corn & Cheese Ball - The plating was really good. Cheese was oozing out of the cheese balls and it tasted good as well.
• Ham Bacon Potato Salad - It was a cold salad with lots of bacon in it. Tasted really good . It had perfect flavours.
• Singapore Sling - It was a brandy based drink. It was presented really well. 
• Caipiroska - This drink was made strong. 

Overall experience wasn't that pleasant though, the music was very loud . It was a retro ambience but they couldn't present it that well.

Chapter 2 is the place to be if you are in search of continental food. Great ambience, good music and lip smacking food altogether deserves many more visits in future. The whole retro look of the place and music will transcend you in the 1960s 1970s. The food (lamb pepper steak and chicken roast) were very good but I loved the caramel custard. Hopefully the management will keep up the jovial reception and high standards of the restaurant in the days to come. Will surely go back to experience their food with the live band!!

Well.. i am writing after a long day.. we just planned suddenly to go there.. for my belated budday celebration on a tuesday.. though at the first.. i had no such expectations... but as soon as i entered in to the resturant... i got a jaw drop.. i mean.. seriously?!.. am i in kolkata?! Or in a irish pub... 
Starting with interior.. the bar counter was in a fashion of a vintage car.. the ceiling is studded with embroidered drums... there is a live band counter also
staffs are pretty good in behavior... and there uniform is cool... white polka doted black shirt.. was having a vintage feeling.
Now the food... we ordered for the combo meal... and we 4 frnz went.. so we ordered all dishes present over that menu.. plz go through the menu.. but what m going to describe is the food...
We started with a mocktail.. it was an orange kiwi punch... tastes really nice... in soup.. we ordered for cream of seafood soup.. trust me... i have never tasted such a delicious soup.. i was feeling like.. plz gimmi more.. 
Then in starter.. i loved liver patte... it was kind a new and unique to me... in veg starter i loved mushroom cocktail.. the way of presentation was awesome.. it was a mixture of mushroom cabbage and meyo... i loved cheese balls also, the nachos was unique... then we had some other non veg starters also... but i forgot the names.. all were so MOUTH WATERING... but one thing was really bad that's 'AMOUNT WAS REALLY INADEQUATE'... now the time for main course.. same problem amount is inadequate... but tastes are awesome... the lamb was really oh so good in taste... and the pasta was also good in taste... in desert we had.. caramel custard, choco mousse, brownie with vanilla ice cream...
Over all its a pocket frndly.. a must go place with frnz... in ala carte... the price bit hiked.. but amount is ok... but in combo amount is really inadequate... 
So i vl suggest to the resturant.. plz increase your amount of food!!!

I had no idea that a restaurant's service can be soooo horrible. A fancy restaurant, excellent decor, great ambience, good food but horrendous service. The waiters are not only rude but are clueless. You order something and they service you something else. When you ask them to change the dish or drink that is served they show you attitude! You want to know anything about any dish they stand with blank faces, none of them have any idea what they are serving. They don't even offer you a glass of water after you have seated yourself ... it's you who have to ask for it, (rather request)! If there is a shortage of plates or cutlery in your table they don't even notice it until you point it out to them. I was served starters but had no plates to eat on! When asked for the same, it seemed I had committed a crime in asking for the same! If you are going in a big group, make sure you have 2 to 3 hours buffer time in your hand -- they are extremely lazy in serving. A tip to the owner -- please train your staff, otherwise all the decor and the good food are going for waste. To sum it up, if you want to screw up your day -- this is the best place to visit.

The air conditioner in this place is really malfunctioning. In this heat i was sweating, also i found this place a little unhygienic and reasons i cannot not disclose. The quality of food is good and offers continental dishes. I tried their 5 course gourmet lunch which includes a mocktail, soup, 2 starters, main course and dessert. Mocktail was horrible, starter and main course was good. These people need to be more hygienic its a request.

Believe me guys I had a strong desire for living the retro life... it's one of my nostalgia... I always wanted to see how does it actually feels... there styles, dressing, fooding etc all fascinates me very strongly... 

And guess what after arriving here... that got full filled and not only got full filled I just lived it... A perfect ambience... the gr8 clock above the bar counter... the red car at it's front... the lighting arrangements on the drums on the ceiling... beautiful mural works and pictures on the walls... live band section... Private dinning space... Also the table matt's will take you to the past... These are actually clicks of newspapers of yesteryear which highlights historical events... what a work presented by "Mr. Nitish Roy"... Again the Staffs are also dressed like retro peoples... Hummm there costumes are designed by " Agnimitra Pal"...

So, I definitely need to thank the "Chaudhury Brothers" from the bottom of my heart for recreating the moments of late 60tis and 70tis through there exceptionally great approach as "Chapter 2 - The Retro dinning"... yes after the success of Chowman and Oudh 1590... they again taken a huge step towards another milestone... The Calcutta food lovers will remain thankful to them for sure... Our elders who misses the ambience of legendary "Skyroom" or "Blue Fox" can definitely give it a try... And for our generation you can co relate the ambience with our favorite Bollywood film " Once upon a time in Mumbai"...

Now about the food they said... these one is not Continental it's Anglo Indian... whatever we tried a long menu here... There menu was also very unique one... Starting with the...

#Soups#
♡ Tomato basil soup»»» Awesome... very tasty...
♡ Seafood chowder»»» Excellent... good consistent gravy with good quantity of shrimps, prawns and crab meat on it... A must try here...

#Starters#
♡ Prawn on toast»»» Insane... Just try it... it needs no exception...
★ Chicken liver pate'»»» Very good... A new dish... good for a change...
♡ English fish fry»»» Awesome... the crust was thin and the fish was fresh...
♡ Deviled crab»»» Excellent presentation... came in inside the crab shell... Although my friends found it bit salty... but it was good for my taste buds...
★ Pork vindaloo»»» Very good one... came with buttered rice... but the pork was bit stiff...
♡ Irish lamb stew»»» Another delicacy... came with vegetables and rice... tasted out of the world...
♡ Beckti lemon grilled»»» Awesome one... presented with sauteed veggies and mash potato... Again it was a hit... the lemon sauce was tangy and the fresh beckti was grilled in perfection...

#Mocktails#
♡ Mexican Sunrise»»» Excellent one very refreshing... A must try...

Loved this place like anything! The retro themed restaurant scores best not only for the classy ambiance, but also for the tastiest continental in North Kolkata. With waiters dressed in retro theme; Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley statues on wall; classic car cut out; beer barrels; band; this place has an awesome feel to it. Alcohol menu has lot of varieties of cocktails too.

Chapter 2 is a new retaurant which came up in Mani Square. It is a pretty good retro dining themed restaurant. 

I ordered Cosmopolitan, which is very well made. 
Eggs benedict was superb. Perfect eggs. 
The ham steak with polenta was superb. The fried egg on top was superb and runny. 
I loved the place. Worth visiting!

At 4:30 all restaurant was denying to serve lunch at Mani square mall. Then kind of we were bound to take a luck at chapter2. They serves English food only. Suppose you wish to be in foreign for 2 hour... :-P
We had chicken chipolota and chicken roast. The items are too much over priced. But ambiance and stuffs are good. You can taste for one time.

It's a new restaurant at mani square with a retro theme. The décor is commendable :) . they have Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe on the wall :D there is a stage for live performances which are held during dinner hours. The bar is done up beautifully and the giant clock hanging in the middle is quite exquisite. the staff were dressed in polka dots and skull caps.Very retro indeed! We decided to try the Continental combo meal,the vegetarian variety. Prior warning, if u plan on eating the same,don't bother eating anything beforehand, it will be quite difficult to finish up the food then, as I learned first hand day before yesterday :D The waiters and captain were courteous and patient and did not say anything to us as we continued to eat for around 2-2.5 hours!!!
Now coming to the food:-
Had the cream of tomato and cream of mushroom soup... Verh creamy and flavourful. The tomato soup had tangyness in it and the mushroom soup came with enough mushrooms. Had all the four veg starters as two of us shared amongst ourselves. The portions of the starters are quite enough for one person, as is intended in a combo meal. The cheese balls and mushroom cocktail were quite good. We ordered babycorn Florentine and veg cannelloni for main course. I did not have much of the Florentine as I was busy trying to finish off the cannelloni I had ordered. It's basically cottage cheese and sautéed veggies wapped in cannelloni pasta and cooked with a delightful red sauce. I am a non vegetarian, but this dish was excellent! Filled with flavours and extremely filling! So so tasty... :) took me a long time to finish it.. Now finally the desserts! My friend had the hot fudge brownie which came with vanilla ice cream on the side and was quite delicious. I chose the chocolate mousse. It was pure bliss in my mouth... Light,airy,fluffy,smooth,with the right amount of sweetness,all in my mouth at the same time... The quantity of the mousse was generous too...
I am definitely coming back here... Especially to try the non veg variant of the continental combo meal.. And m gonna have the chocolate mousse again... :D

Went for dinner after office not expecting much. The interior & decor are really eye catching and look lovely, sadly it stops there. We ordered for a Virgin Mojito, Mini chicken breasts, chicken steak mushroom sauce, fish florentine & chicken Bolognese. The virgin Mojito tasted like have raw lemon juice & ice..the mini chicken breast were fine but nothing much to write about.
 
The chicken steak was cooked to perfection but the mushroom sauce was a total let down. Fish florentine was a saving grace but not the way it should have been, & lastly the Chicken Bolognese was just tasteless...it was all texture, no taste.

A very disappointing dinner which was saved my the amazing company & conversation.

A must try for all the food lovers. Went for lunch with family and the place looks excellent,, bringing out the feel of retro diner. We tried out the combo meal which was excellent. Its a 5 course meal only for RS 350/from mocktails to soup to the main course. My personal favourite and the must try ones are BBQ chicken wings, lamb goulash, chicken liver pate,  and the best one was cream of seafood soup. The cocktail served to us was very refreshing . couldn't try the steak and pork chops as we were already full.  Next time will try the pork vindaloo, prawn Newburg and pork chops. Overall a nice experience.

Visited on Saturday evening. Loved the décor. They had live band playing and the music was pretty good. Coming to the food we ordered Cream of chicken soup- excellent, English fish finger- best ever had, prawn cocktail-too good, pepper lamb steak- juicy, tender and yummy, asparagus risotto-loved it, best of all- baked cheesecake. Tried kiwi blast which was really good and tried their new Smirnoff cocktails - extraordinary good. Shall visit again to try the Irish lamb stew, lamb ghoulash and devilled crabs.

Situated on the 4th floor on Mani Square,Chapter 2 is really one of a kind. I along with a bunch of foodies were invited here for dinner. I had done my research and boy oh boy was I dumbfounded! All the negative reviews do not match to what we experienced. It was a Wednesday night and 8 pm the restaurant was full so it does indicate that they are doing something correctly.

Coming to the restaurant. A big bench is there at the restaurant with a statue of a person playing the accordion. This instantly gives you the feel of a different era. The transparent wall shows the chapter 2 board and the backdrop of the music instruments kept inside. Once entering it immediately takes you to 1940 50's time. A big bike is kept where we all happily posed. The interiors are done keeping in mind the retro look that the restaurant wanted to provide. A huge Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley installation are done up on the wall. The lights on the ceiling are made to look like drums. There is a live band from Friday to Sunday. But not to fret if you go on any other day as there is equally good music playing through out the rest of the week. Such soothing beautiful music. The mood is set instantly. Even the music request slips are made in the shape and look of the cassette,which at one point we all ( by all I mean till 90's kids) used to buy like crazy. Everything is well thought and designed. Even the servers are dressed to look the part. 
The bar has a huge red Cadillac installed in the front and the back has a huge clock surrounded with any type of alcohol one could think of. This showcases how park street and 
Chowringhee was during the 1940 to late 80s time and hence the name chapter 2. 

Now finally coming to the food. This is one of those places where I couldn't find any fault with the food and this happens rarely. 
We started with kiwi blast. A refreshing mocktail with the right amount of ingredients. The person making them knows his way and it showed in all the mocktails. Then came the Mexican surprise. Very light and tasted a lot like our good old squash with a twist of course. Then came the berry frappe. AMAZING. Thick and creamy mocktail with perfect balance. At last there was the cranberry cooler to cool things down, not for the ones who love their drinks to be loaded with sugar. 

Coming to the appetizer/starters
Tomato basil soup. I always have been a fan of tomato soup but this was just in a different level altogether. Loaded with garlic pieces, well seasoned with crushed black pepper,light in the tummy. 
Seafood chowder. This was a creamy soup with squid,crab meat and prawns. Every spoon gives one seafood or the other so you know that they don't give less quantity. 
Then came the prawn on toast. Crispy toasted bread with a big prawn topped with sesame seed. Amazing taste. I will soon run out of adjectives to describe their food but trust me on this that they make drool worthy dishes. 
The second one was chicken liver on toast and I was quite apprehensive about this dish because it was chicken liver and I thought it would taste weird but the chef proved me wrong. I finished it in 2 bites and went on raving about it while rest of them took their own sweet time to finish. The last entree was the the devilled crab. A medium sized crab halved and cleared from inside with stuffing of crab meat and baked with cheese. This was the only dish which had an slight imbalance in the seasoning. The salt was on the higher side and our guess was that maybe because of the cheese it got more salty. 

Coming to the mains. English fish fry with chips. A take and twist of the English fish and chips and our Bengali fish fry. Fresh bhetki fillet coated and crumbed and deep fried to perfection. To those who have rated this dish poorly I suggest a quick visit to the dentist. 
The fries had gone a bit soft thanks to our time consuming photo shoot of the dish but it was well seasoned and cooked well. 
Then came plain rice and lamb stew. It was completely like home cooked stew with chunky vegetables and minced meat. My only suggestion for this dish would be that if big meat pieces could be used instead of the minced ones as the spoon picks up more veges than the meat. Again the seasoning was perfect. This shows that the chef/s taste the food before they send out. Gordon Ramsay would be proud. :-) 
The herbed rice with pork vindaloo followed. This was the first time I tried pork vindaloo. Tangy and spicy. Looked exactly like the ones shown on the cookery shows. The tangyness comes from the vinegar and the mixed spices give it the heat and in the last on gets a fennel taste which takes the dish to a whole new level.
As the saying goes that save the best comes at the last well true to the saying,the best was served at last. Bhetki fillet with lemon butter sauce. YUM. Soft,melt in your mouth bhetki pieces grilled to perfection with a lemon butter reduction on top. The lemon did not overpower the butter and neither was the butter used too much to make it a thick sauce. A perfect balance. Hats off the chef. 

At last after stuffing myself I had to keep space for dessert and thank god that there was only a single type of dessert and not a variety as I wouldn't have been able to give justice to all of them by consuming them since my tummy had already grown 2 3 inches already. But what a grand dessert it was. 
A perfectly baked cheesecake drizzled with chocolate sauce. 
Amazingly good food with equally good music playing. Thank you Rusha and Shiladitya for being such awesome hosts. Keep up the good work. 
P.S. sorry to have used perfect so many times but I couldn't think of any other word to describe the dishes.

The city of joy is all surrounded and flooded with restos. Very good dining, awesome foods, multi cuisines, mouth watering desserts, refreshing mocktails. This is we all get when we step outside for a lunch or dinner or hangouts. How often you find a fine diner with retro. Chapter 2 at the Mani Square Mall top floor on the food court is a new addition in the industry which is surely gonna bring change in the dining experience of those hungry people stepping in this place.
Been late to the venue for  what is called a fabulous dinner. The Name itself kept some sort of mystery until i went in this place. 
From the main door u get to see a guy standing with the bike with the headlights on. After you walk inside u get to see the live band equipments which basically is played on Fri-Sun so we missed it. But in the alternative they were playing some English rocking songs. Seemed a very fascinating place to me. Sitting was perfect and service somehow needs to be improved. They have got quite a huge bar and a huge candid car in front with a BIG clock.

SO coming to the main section which is food. First of all i want to know that why people so eagerly gave this place a rating of 1? After what i had here i don't think i can even trust on those stupid ratings.
I was a bit late so started with the only starter left 

Devilled Crab - A huge giant crab been crushed from the center which is such a difficult task sometimes. Stuffed with good amount of flavors with i guess cheese stuffind on the top. The very dish impressed me truly, from the taste to preparation all were just done well.

Quickly turned our ways to the Main course:

Bhetki Lemon Grilled - This is how a looked simple quite dish makes huge noise inside your mouth. Came in the plate with couple of veggies with flavor of lime on the top seriously meant business on the table.

Irish Lamb Stew - Came on the table with quite a decoration on the plate. One bowl of rice and bowl full of stewed lamb in it with good amount of gravy. It was very light in taste with veggie, won't say the best but yet satisfied with the try.

Mocktails were even not behind to surprise us.

Mexican Sunrise - Indeed the color resembled Sunshine. Just like how the sunshine looks beautiful the drink was even better. Very refreshing on the first hand and was a perfect thirst cooler. Tangy as well as very consistent.

Blueberry Frappe - AAH! this was just marvelous i would say. I guess my expression says half about the drink. Thick creamy and delicious is the perfect word for this. 

Finally finishing it with a outstanding dessert.

Cheese cake - Bang on the cheese cake seriously made everyone happy on the last stage with the taste. Presentation was very good so the thickness and the crust of the same was soft.

From the place to the welcome and till the exit everything was well managed and was perfectly under control of Rusha, so congratulations to her for bringing us together for such a great event and making the evening so pleasant.

Again talking about the place and the food which is really impressing and for those who loves their food with some live band or who loves their evening to be spent with some pegs of wine with soft music, they can simply land here.

I wish Chapter 2 a very good luck and wish they come up with more those chapters in the coming future.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience  to this place.

Chanced upon chapter 2 today.
Have to say very nice ambience. I was sold the moment is saw the royal Enfield headlights.
We went straight for the chicken cordon bleu. It was awesome. Would definitely recommend it. You can also try the bhetki and prawn steak. Best fish steak I have had. Hands down.
Cocktails are okayish though. 
The staff is very polite and well mannered. There was some issue with the pork chops I ordered, they replaced it and even offered to not consider it in the bill.
Must try this joint if you are around Mani sq. And fair warning before ordering pork, find out if it is fatty.
Would revisit for sure.
P.S : they have a mean lunch buffet in weekdays. Have to try.

stylish..delectable..and ofcourse with the continental touch..Chapter 2 will hook you with the wide range of platter..drinks..and the ambience..quite spacious..the attendants are prompt and got a fancy outfit..even though we got kinda late service but that was covered up by their honest acceptance for the delay..we tried upon chicken tetrazzini and daiquiri which was pretty good.

Verdict - go for a relaxing dinner and don't miss out ur selfie with the dug dug bike at the entrance.

I had recently been there. The decor is very nice. But the food is average.Nowhere near the continental quality of Mocambo and all. Quantity is also less vis-a-vis the price. Service is awfully bad. Staff is courteous but very much confused and making repeatrd mistakes in taking order or making the bill. One of my attractions which has I heard was live music, but I found its only on weekends which is another disappointing factor. Not worth at all.

An unique take on the retro theme, makes this restaurant worth of your time. The place has a vintage cadillac and bullet with technicolour dashes all around. Food is terrific. And if you are a steak lover, well lets just say, you're in good hands. We had a steak dinner with a seafood chowder soup and the taste was just wow !! Looking forward to more good times with this one..

P.S - on weekends they have live band!! Go for it !!

We decided to try this new place on the top floor of Mani Square, just besides Haka.
We wanted to try out Continental cuisine, hence we walked inside! At the entrance,one cant miss the bike with it headlight on....liked the concept...as it was something new!As we took our seat, we could hear the band  play some English numbers live !
The ambiance was good.The Grilled Fish (Betki) & prawns were good , even though I would have loved bigger size prawns!Cocktail was pretty good , specially  Vodka with melon juice!Dining here is a little expensive though!

The most pathetic restaurant I've ever been and experienced. Service is out of your mind, they simply don't know what is that. Food ... wow what should I say...!!! Please don't waste your money. Believe me anyone can cook better than that. We've ordered for 2 Heineken and 1 Paper chicken wings as starter, that is also suggested by their service boy after asking for their signature dish. There was only bone and if u can find something out of that bone, u can't eat that. Price is just too much without any meaning. It's just a waste of everything. 
Simply the WORST.

Pathetic....pathetic........simply pathetic......although the food seems to be edible
...their service is worse that you can imagine or what I am writing. From asking for plates and water to ordering drinks and food or clearance, everything had to be requested from our end as the waiters were never around...in fact they  never looked towards our table where we were seated ( 7 of us ). To add on the waiters have lots of attitude but zero dedication or inclination towards their work.

Pretty disappointing. At least they shouldn't touted themselves as continental restaurant. If you serve a lasagna in a bowl immersed in a white sauce and chicken stroganoff is again in the same white sauce based grave then..... unfortunate. You can fool some people this way not all.

Visited on a lazy, scorching kolkata dupur. 
The decor would reflect purono parkstreet skyroom. But, thats it. 
Prawn cocktail wont make you remember those days, neither would the steaks nor would the behavior of the staffs. 
And coming to staffs. Probably the worst employees one can have. Lethargic, gossipy, typical bangali lyath. Bad combos. 
Pocket friendly neither. 
3 just for the good time I had with awesome company.

Been there last week, one word review...."pathetic". Will never visit again nor recommend anyone to do so. They boast of being a continental restaurant and can't even properly take an order for a steak, let alone make it properly. It was a soggy mess. Even the chicken wings starter was full of sauce. The staffs were clueless. They really need to get their priorities right. When I asked whether the chef was trained or not, I got the reply "ektu (a bit)", which made me think whether he/she left half way or failed.

The restaurant has been decorated properly but they have completely messed up the real thing....FOOD.

This is a fairly new place by the owners of Oudh 1590 and Chowman, located on the 4th floor of Mani Square Mall, naturally since I am huge Oudh 1590 fan ( can't say the same thing about their innumerable Chowman outlets including the one in Calcutta club ) was rather excited to visit this place, the decor is quite funky and honestly all good things end there. 
Staff though earnest in their approach is utterly clueless. We were there for about one and a half hours, no one bothered to pour us even a glass of water or even ask whether we would like to order water. Nevertheless we ordered for prawn cocktail, an English fish fry and two cocktails called soda Sikanji with Smirnoff and another watermelon Smirnoff. Both the prawn cocktail and English fish fry were horrible, especially after having the prawn cocktails offered at Park Street joints this one seemed like a joke, English Fish fry though good in portion size was utterly tasteless and not seasoned properly. 
No one asked us whether we liked the food or even whether we need anything else or asked for any feedback ! Honestly we were pretty exasperated with the place and the attitude of the staff members so didn't even bother to complain. Honestly I did not even try to finish the "English Fish Fry", which was not English from any angle. 
Staff, some were busy staring at the roof behind the bar counter and the others just kept roaming around here and there. Don't know why don't they train their people before opening a restaurant? Though we went on a Sunday it was not crowded but still their staff members were extremely casual, careless and had an attitude - that" we couldn't care less"
After about an hour I asked someone for a glass of water, then he realised that water wasn't even served at our table in the first place. 
The soda sikanjj had no sweet flavour at all and mixed with vodka it tasted like salt water with vodka. Horrible. Funny thing no one even asked us whether we wanted any desserts! 
For all these, our bill was 1586 bucks. In fact I am rather scared for Calcutta Club, if they start serving chapter 2 food there as well like their other two joints Oudh and Chowman, I just might have to cancel my membership. 
Long live Park Street! This is an utter disappointment.

We went in here on Nobobarsha as Haka had a long line and we were hungry. Though it's a new place, the food was a pleasant surprise. I ordered Mutton Breast Cutlet for entreé and Spagetti with Meatballs for main course. The Cutlet was a delight- well cooked and juicy. Recommended for first timers. The main course was good too although the quantity is a bit less for the price. It will only just fill one.
My only complaint was that they made us wait for a long time for the food (almost 30mins) even though the place was relatively empty. If they look into that, it would be all good. I'll definitely visit again soon.

We were 4 friends went there for a dine out on saturday night.Live music,good ambience is what attract us but after we had some drinks n starters at around 10:45 pm they turned off their ac which lead us to suffocate, sweat like hell.Upon complaining the waiter first kept on lying that the AC is on then when we asked 2-3 times they admit that they hav turned off AC.One of their staff came n told us it was turned off by mall authority then we cancle our maincourse n we decided not to pay any bill because they should hav informed that AC will be off by 11 ,there is no board in restro or any information on any sites abt this. The restro is full of unprofessional n arrogant staffs ,dont care about customer service. They were like we need our money plz pay n go.They didnt even bother to make some other alternatives n highlight of the story is when we told them you should hav close by 11 why opening till 11:30 as per zomato if this is the case you are letting your customer to suffocate then they said our closing time is 11 we dont hav anything to do with Zomato n what info they provide.At last we paid out bills n walk out of that shitty place.

Timings written is till 1130 pm, but ac stops at 1045. You will be all in sweat to consume any thing. And if u ask the staff about it they will say other are eating only you have problem. This is the level of experience you will have in here... One point only for good live music. Their in house music is shitty. Ruined my evening.

Visited on 14.04.2016, which is located at 4th floor of Mani Square. They have a live performance of orchestra 

performs on every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night. The ambience is consist of a vintage car(Bar counter), retro 

look dress of staffs, wall decor (Model of drum set and singers) and roof decor. Staffs are very friendly and behave 

very well. Now come to the most important part - Food. It's a pure continental restaurant with lots of option of 

chicken, ham, beef and pork. The cost for two people will take approx Rs.1500 (without tax & drinks) . There are 

lots of option for scotch, whiskey, beer, vodka, cocktail and mocktail. Food quantity and quality both are very 

nice. I ordered Beer(Heineken), Peeper Chicken Wings , Pork Vindaloo, Grilled Chicken and Brownie with Vanilla Ice 

Cream as a dessert. I prefer Tiramisu as a dessert, unfortunately, they don't have that item on the mentioned date.

Overall experience is nice and good. The owner of the restaurant is Mr. Debaditya Chaudhury (The owner of Chowman 

and co-owner of Oudh 1590).

Great ambience. The old school music and colorful decor provides a wonderfully versatile ambience. The food is good too, I ordered an English Fish Fingers, Grilled Beckti and Prawn, and Pork Chops. The quality of the protein was great.  Though the mashed potato sides were over buttered and had little salt. The cocktails were brilliant - moderately priced and tastes good. The Margarita was my favourite. I enjoyed the Cocktails and Entrée more than the Main course. The overall experience was great though,thanks to the friendly staff.

Been to this place yesterday, which is located at the topmost floor in Mani Square. With glass wall on one side which overlooks the Mall on the inside, one can easily view the orchestra and live band from outside, which the restaurant boasts of.
*AMBIENCE*
The management has setup a live band, retro decor on the wall, a vintage car and staff with shirts with retro look to bring in the feel of Retro dining. The eatery has a seating capacity of around 40 people.
*FOOD*
Delving into the food talk, we had ordered a Virgin Mojito, Ham Bacon Potato Salad, Pork Chop and Pork Vindaloo. All the items were cooked well, except the rice which was served alongwith the Pork Vindaloo. It was supposed to be buttered Basmati Rice, but somehow I found the Rice to be flavorless. The Pork Chop, Vindaloo and Salad tasted delicious.
We were utterly dissappointed with the dessert section. We tried ordering Baked Alaska and Tiramisu, neither of which was present. We were told that for that day, the only dessert that they could serve was Brownie with Ice Cream, which we didnt feel like having.
*SERVICE*
This is a very important aspect, which needs to be noticed while reviewing any restaurant. The staff were less in number and seemingly, they need to be trained better. We had to call out some 3-4 times, before we could get someone who would take down our order. Secondly, we had to literally ask them to serve our food in the dishes, which was initially being served in the container itself. That was very dissappointing to notice.
Although, this place just came up a month back, but the management really needs to pull up their socks and train the staff well.

Ok, so took some time out and headed for a dinner date to this newly opened place, which promises the lost cuisine of the Continent. For one, live music is mediocre and too loud for a quiet dinner. The food is ordinary and the chef appears to have been trained to disguise flavours in sauces. Management has to decide whether they wanna cater to walk-in casual diners or those who would like to revisit for the taste they promise. Service is of a bullock cast pace and the management (owners of the Chow Man and Oudh 1590 chains) have to engage professionals to advice them on how to graduate from a mediocre to a popular place.

Location: Top Floor Mani Square Mall

Ambience and Decor: They have really worked hard to put together a retro decor and have excelled in it, the bar looks essentially like an old American one whereas the car and bike paintings on the wall (vinateg cars and bieks) only add to the appeal.....add to that Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley miniatures (monroe gone horribly wrong)....
The seats are comfortable and the tables are big.

Menu: All continental menu

Food and Quality: The food here is a bit of a concern, they might boast of a some exotic continental items but come to the taste and u know u have better places to look to. We tried Egg benedict, something which can be easily made at home widout much effort and still it wnt make a great dish, chicken paprika which seemed to be gud along with a decent chicken carbonara but the prawn munierre tasted too lemonish, even for a dish based on lemon, it struck the tongue way too much.

Service: courteous staff and decent service time

Pocket pinch: okayish, quality wise a bit high else fine

The newest eating place in Amani Square. The decor is of top notch quality. Live music creates a nice ambience.
Coming to the food, disappointing! They served the starter way after the main course! Staff behavior was extremely curt n rude. We had ordered for a beef steak where they didn't even allow us to choose the sauce we would want! The beef was rubbery n dry.
The stroganoff was okay ish, quantity good!
Please do improve on the staff attitude, another set of customer was facing the same issue it seemed!

Went to chapter 2, mani square today. The décor is good and ambience is okay. The staff is undertrained.
Coming to the food, we had ordered english fish fingers for starter followed by chicken carbonara and beckti lemon grilled and ended with brownie and vanilla ice cream for dessert. The food was okay. We didn't have much choice for dessert because they only had caramel custard and brownie with ice cream available.
Overall they have failed to recreate the park street food and feel.

Chapter 2 is a perfect place to wine dine and make merry. The decor and the ambiance is brilliant - lively and very retro - and the staff is warm and welcoming. Food is really good - brings back memories of dining at some of the iconic restaurants of Park Street in the 90s like Sky Room and Blue Fox. We ordered Irish Lamb Stew, Chicken Ala Kiev, Gypsy Beef Steak and Pork Vindaloo - must say all the four dishes were equally delicious. Overall, I would say a very good experience :)

Went for a meal at the restaurant . 

Positives first , the place is well done and the bar looks grand . The bar prices are also competitive and the dishes even though on a bit of a higher side is ok as others in the vicinity don't offer such food. 

Cons: the food is not authentic . It's saucy and kechupy which is suited for Indian palates .

The founder of this place Debaditya is a dude and a bro.And a vanishing breed.A Bengali Entepreneur.

Without any regional or linguistic chauvinism I still salute this breed.

Chapter two,according to him tries to revive the legend that was Skyroom,the restaurant in Park Street,now gone like many other erstwhile Calcutta institutions.It counted Satyajit Ray,Amitabh Bachhan,Uttam Kumar as regulars.

This place succeeds in evoking the atmosphere with the sculptures,the statues,the red leather seating,the lighting and above all the podium for the live band,with the omnipotent drums kit.Awesome.

Since we were in a group we practically tasted the entire gamut of the menu.

Chicken starter.   4/5

Prawn cocktail.  2.5/5

Chateaubriand steak 4/5

Pork vindaloo 4.5/5

Fish orly and meunière  4/5

Mocktails  4/5

Desserts 3.5/5

My comeback number was the pork vindaloo and I cannot think of any other place in Kolkata other than my very own The Royal Bengal Tiger Cafe which boasts of so many Calcutta favourites in the menu.

A chapter worth bookmarking and visiting often.

WHEN FOOD IS LINKED TO WRITING, IT IS CHAPTER 2 !!!

It has always been on my wishlist, to try out new food-joints and for pre-Holi dinner, visiting Chapter 2, that has replaced Square 405, has not been an exception. My visuals got absolutely stuck to the rock-n-roll / roadie type decors and the Anglo-ambiance of the inside. And my gustatory was simply spellbound with the French / Italian / American combination food that we had ordered - Grilled Beckti in Lemon Sauce as starter and then Chicken Cordon Bliue for myself, Chicken Stroganoff for my little daughter and Chicken Steak in Mushroom Sauce for him.

Now coming to the funny part ... I guess we had a Holi-Luck that made the boy bring a wrong dish that we hadn't ordered - Chicken Ala-kiev instead of Steak which is why, there was a little mess but they quickly redressed it by bringing in the right dish and making the wrong one, complimentary !

The result was, we were full, too full and filled up ... and therefore, this colourful dinner served as a gastronomic preclude to the festival of colours. 

My suggestion ---- The service needs a lit bit of perfection, if not the food because the chef, who is always the heart of any restaurant, in this case, has won our hearts !!!

Great ambience and AMAZING food. Couldn't ask for more. The band plays on weekends their vegetarian cuisine is remarkably good and their tastes are very original. I'm definitely coming back here again.

Went to the recently opened "retro dining " joint viz. Chapter 2, from the management of Oudh restaurants. Food was so so. An failed attempt to recreate Trincas etc.of by gone era of Park Street hangouts. Crooner screeches to drown you to the average tasting food.  Expensive, you don't get the worth of your penny.  Staffs will make you stand outside even when then interior is almost vacant on various pretexts. I thought since the new restaurant was from the house of Oudh, it would provide some quality and tasty food, which, unfortunately was not the case.

Amazing place !
We ordered Pinna colada and Blue lagoon. It had such a smooth texture and the taste was brilliant
Then we went for Grilled cocktail sausage,  English Fish Finger, Bhetki Grillled in Lemon Sauce and Deviled Crab and Chicken Ala Keiv. 
Fish finger was so tasty that we ended up ordering again. It was finger licking good!
Bhetki was nice but the fish was a bit chewy! I guess not fresh enough
Deviled crab had a very smooth texture. Correct mixture of flavours. I loved it
All in all its a gd place

The best continental food i had in kolkata. The ambience and decor is really amazing. The cadillac bar is a brialliant innovative idea. Grilled Beckti & the prawn steak is a must try for all.

Great ambiance, well thought out decor, rocking music of the 70's and outstanding continental fine dining experience. That is Chapter 2. Will visit again.

Mani Square has always been a safe bet for me, when I'm not feeling too adventurous. Often, these bets result in absolute gems. Mio Amore and 4o5 were among those I'd like to mention. Recently, and quite obviously, Chapter 2 caught my eye. This is probably the first restaurant I've tried out without having consulted my trusty little app first.

The best quality this restaurant exhibits, is its decor. The place is very well furnished and incredibly spacious. I'm a sucker for the retro theme anyway, which does add to restaurant's charm. They have one of the best bars around -- looks absolutely fantastic, serves most things. They also have a stage, which would mean that they do accommodate live bands. For decor, this restaurant would rank among the best I've seen.

Coming to the service, this is where I feel the restaurant is a bit of a let down. The waiters are polite and friendly, but they aren't the most efficient. Apologising for delays, they also managed to turn off the lights and leave while we were having our main course. If you don't offer the best hospitality, you don't pull in the most customers.

The most important aspect of a restaurant will always be the food, for obvious reasons. Chapter 2 seemed to be a sight for sore eyes, but things have a way of biting you in the bum. Their finely made menu, which have a couple of typos, serve up the standard meats and fish. I'll be frank -- the salads were a little too salty, and so was the crab. The Chateaubriand and the beef stew were average, the Schnitzel was decent and the Bhetki was bordering on good. Overall, very underwhelming. The problem creeps up when you promise so much with decor and fail to deliver with food. The classy interior does not make up for the classless use of too much salt in the salad. Adding salt to bacon is like adding oil to fire.

Their drinks were alright -- they seem to be a little stingy with their alcohol. Can't blame them. I'll be waiting for Chapter 3. It's all the more disappointing when a restaurant serving beef opens up near your house and it isn't brilliant enough to frequent. 

Average food. Decent experience.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Went for dinner last night and had such a bad experience, right from the time we entered there was no one to take you to a table, the waiters had to be called they didn't come to assist at all. The prawns on toast were abs tasteless. We were four adults,they took the order for four main dishes served three and forgot the fourth order. And they had the audacity to charge for it. By 10.45pm they keep switching off the overhead lights oblivious of whether there are diners or not. The food well less said the better!

The names bit offish but after reading the review at t2 telegraph we had gone there and find that the previously where cafe 360 and the five rivers  was its now chapter two
The live band at restora was the thing in south kolkata...here in north side they are the first one offering.
It was full
Ambiance is more than good.
Menu is fab
Taste wasnt that good...loads of room for improvement.
Service was decent.
Prices are the best.
Music is the main attraction and they have nailed it.
Please go after few months let them mature a bit.

Classic Continental Experience at this newly opened Retro Dining Restaurant! New in the block & oh so amazing food.
This place plays retro music at the background and will host live band performances as they have a stage area. The bar is beautiful and also has a half car located right by the bar. 
Coming to the food, their dishes tastes amazing. All the items were so tender and juicy. Right amount of taste. The portions are just right for two people. 
Service is really good. The stewards keep a check be that with the food or with the drinks. Their bartender served good cocktails as well. 
Looking forward to more such good dinner experiences and hope they maintain this amazing food quality. 
Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 4/5

The concept of Chapter 2 has tried to bring a revolution in dining in kolkata.
A little bit of glitz and unique decor thrown in chapter2.....where people go to unwind and have fun with their friend and acquintances.
Food is as awesome and different as they have already presented earlier in CHOWMAN & OUDH 1590.
all the very best.....
