It was great to have our lunch at aami bangali. Nice place and really good food. I don't know why this place is so empty. Me wid 2 of my friends went and have basanti pulau & chicken bhuna combo. The flavour and so as the taste was awesome. Would be my next destination in near future and highly recommended

Ordered lunch today. Muger dal, aalu bhaja , shukto, mutton kosha, egg curry.
All were really good to taste and quantity of 1 portion is sufficient for 2-3 people. Thank u so much for the lunch.

I stay in Bangalore and crave good bengali food. This time while in Kolkata, I made a resolution of trying out all the good bengali restaurants for have good Bengali food. My sister-in-law ordered for food for us from this restaurant. The order was Chingri Sorshe, Vetki machher paturi and Mutton Kosha. 
Food was delivered to us in-time (in Behala). It was really delicious food. Normally I don't like Vetki machher Paturi, because in most places there's a lingering smell in Paturi (since it is not fried). But this paturi was really good. It was made by using Vetki Fillet and was delicious. Chingi Posto (or so) was yummy. And after long I had the perfect tasting Mutton Kosha. Normally either it is too spicy or with too much gravy. This had the perfect blend. Overall very good experience.
I plan to visit their Behala Outlet soon.

Generally I avoid going to this restaurant, unless I run out of option or time. The ambiance is bad, service is poor and hospitality- worst!! Make a note of it - go there and ask for thali..either they will say it is not available right now or it will take lot of time and force you to take ala-carte. Utter unprofessional owner and service. Consider this as last option.

Recently my father bought two items(Paneer and Chicken, can't name them because my Dad didn't remember the names) from them for dinner. Thus I have no idea about the ambience. Since this place was there in my wishlist I thought of not posting a review after just having their food at home. Instead I thought of visiting and then post the final review. But after having their food, I changed my mind and clicked pictures of those boxes containing half the food. The Paneer item was too sweet and contained too much Ginger and was horrible in taste. The Chicken item contained dead ants in it and it neither tasted like chicken nor like mutton. I am in doubt about what it actually was. We planned to have outside food but couldn't eat these items and finally had homemade Alu Posto. I will never visit or order food from them again and would not recommend anyone to try them out.

Food quality was terrible. They gave a small Rohu type of fish instead of an ILLISH fish for Rs 456 which is totally cheating a customer (the size was way small as compared to a normal illish) The order was also delivered late. Hence I recommend not to purchase anything from this restaurant as it only aims at money making instead of customer satisfaction.

ordered food from here unfortunately 
first there was a huge delay in delivery 🚚 took them almost two hours  to deliver the food to my place which is only 2km away from the restaurant *sigh* (so very unprofessional) 
about the food now: 
I'd ordered fine steamed rice, katla kalia and mutton kosha. 
So the rice was totally substandard (had a hard time eating it) ;
the fish kalia was good and the mutton was okayish. 

In my honest opinion steer clear of this restaurant when thinking of ordering online. 

Cheerio. 👋 👋  ==[Rita]==

Bitter experience 

Behala outlet is located 10 mnts walking distance from my house. I was ordered plain bhat,dal,aloo bhaja and sukto. They deliver dis after 1.30 hours and  has mistake in the order. Have order one item in the  quantity they served one quantity and have charged 12 container to make up the Bill with that food item.
A worst ever experience.

Had a craving for Bengali style lunch!!!! So started searching for restaurants to deliver to my home....Found aami bangali as it was only available to deliver to my location......Never had I eaten any dish here.....I ordered a mutton thali and bhuna chicken.....mutton thali was good all over....contents were rice , dal, aloo jhinge posto , mutton curry , crispy jhuri Bhaja , and to top it all at the end - mango chutney.......There were 2 pcs of well cooked mutton and the dal and aloo jhinge posto were authentic in taste ......the chutney could have been much much better ......all over the thali was enough for 1 person and good in taste .....

We found this place couple of months back on Zomato! Since then we have been ordering from them for Home delivery and we are pleased with the quality of food served.
We are regulars for the Thalis. A Thali contains Dal (Usually Moong Dal with Peas), Jhuri Aloo Bhaja, Aloo Jhinge Posto/Phulkopi Aloo'r torkari, Main Side dish as per choice of thali i.e. Chicken/Fish/Egg and Pineapple Chutney. They pack it all in a neat box and the proportions are enough to have a hearty Homely Lunch. Thumbs Up for the Dal, it has always been awesome till date.
We have also tried Chicken Dak Bungalow, Dhakai Morog Pulao, Chicken Kosha, Chitol Muitha, Bhetki Paturi amongst others and they are pretty good in taste.
Except for few glitches in taste and quality, which I have mentioned to them over a call, I find this place an absolute go-to ordering destination, when I am dead tired or mad hungry.

Have had lunch twice in the restaurant. It's a small and cozy place. Staff were courteous and helpful. Food was quite good, my favourites till now are; kochupata chingri, chicken dakbunglow, bhetki paturi and chanar dalna. It's located 5 mins from my home so that's an additional thumbs up from me. I went there with a group of 10-12 people the 2nd time and everyone was quite satisfied with the food and the hospitality.
Something which I liked about the people working there was that they were open to constructive criticism or feedback, I gave them a few, and they seemed to be really taking it in. So hope the feedback is put into action. Looking forward to trying new things from the menu.

I have ordered for fish fry, chicken bhuna and their signature dish Kochupata chingri. Everybody loved the food very much. Quantity was good. Chicken pieces are big in size. One piece is good for one person. They have maintained the quality as well. Keep up the good work. 👍

This place is a newbie with many new outlets in the city but they haven't gained much attention for the below average standard of the food they serve. I have to their Santoshpur outlet earlier. 
Few months back, I was at a relative's place and we were ordering food online. Had to go for this as the options weren't many. Bhetki Paturi, Chital Muitthya and Kasha Mangsho. Packaging was okayish. Food was okayish or worse. Not recommended at all.

The joint is small but cosy. Ambience is good. People r polite. 
Food.. Inconsistant. Bad quality. 
This is the second day we had food from here. The first day was via swiggy. The fish fry was not of vetki. It was anything but vetki. The chicken dakbunglow was good. The basanti polao was ok but the the rice used was not pulao rice. The dhakai murg pulao was too greasy. 
Today,  the fish fry was horrible. 
The chicken dakbunglow surprisingly tasted like the gravy of crab masala. The gravy was thick, n nowhere did it feel or taste like dakbunglow. 
The pineapple chutney was strange. The juice was fighting with the?? grated pineapple. 
The biggest problem with some brands is the lack of consistency. N i fail to understand, why should be there any lack of consistency... 
Really disheartened.

Bitter experience!!

This place is located 5mins from my house yet they took around 55 mins to deliver. Ordered fish fry exactly around 8.30. Delivery time given by the staff/management was 9. Cold fries reach my home at 9.40. I resend that. They fry the same once again and it comes after 15mins.

Didn't have any other item but the fries were nothing special. Less fish and thick crumbs.

Don't have any intentions to visit/order again. A big no for me.

@Management: Just an advice. Try to be a little more professional otherwise the place would remain empty as its now.

And for the last bit to the desert it's also too good 👏 👏 👏 If you are hunting for good food, it's a must visit place if u want to give ur taste bud's a treat...😉 at the same time  it's very pocket frndly.....😊 👍

Another bengali cuisine restaurant.This is located just near Behala Tram depot james long crossing...with high hopes i ordered for home delivery on the very day it opened..i ordered a Fish thali and basanti pulao with chicken kasa..but the food was huge disappointment..chicken pieces were very small..and even the quantity was not sufficient enough to feed one person.and the food quality was also not good..
