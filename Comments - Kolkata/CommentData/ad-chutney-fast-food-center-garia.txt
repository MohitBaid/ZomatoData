This really is the go to place for the students of Netaji Subhash Engineering College as other food stalls are very irregular in terms of durability. The canteen too has not been a constant for this college which happens to have a huge student strength. So it's really unfortunate.
Coming back to AD Chutney, it's a small fast food center, which is a hit and miss with food. If you are very hygienic then please​ avoid coming here. more than anything the flies will give you a nightmare.

Inspite of that there are a few good things about this place. They serve some combo meals which come at very cheap rates. Quantity wise the combos are nice and are not too bad in terms of taste.
The Rolls they serve are good. I'd recommend trying their chicken rolls. Chicken Chowmein that they serve is quite nice too.
Mutton biryani is also a pleasant surprise. The mutton is very nicely cooked. It's moist from inside and is quite tasty. Sadly that doesn't hold true for the Chicken counterpart as the chicken preparation is not as good.
Coming to the momos, well they probably are the best items to go for while you are here. The momos are cooked well, they are tasty and the sauce the prepare is also very nice. Pan fried momo is the best dish that I've tried from this eatery although the fried and the normal steamed variety are not far behind in terms of taste.
The place is very pocket friendly as it's directed to the student demographic. For two, the cost can be anywhere around 200-300 bucks.

One serious problem with this place is there is no table where you can put your plates down when the food arrives. Nor are the seat numbers are high. There is no basin where you can wash your hands. Plus the absence of fans makes it a very difficult experience for the customers who want to enjoy their food.
This place needs quite a few changes . The authority should take proper action to solve these problems.

This is the go-to place for all the students of the neighbouring college, Netaji Subhash Engineering College. This is a small fast food center yet the only food joint in this area serving so-so food when taste, quality and hygiene is taken into consideration. I have tried a number of items from this place and a few have really impressed me.

The must-try dishes: The Momos here are really good. All the three types are amazing. The momos, the sauce, the soup everything is delicious. Steamed, Fried and Pan-Fried Momos are highly recommended. The Rolls they make are delectable too. They put an amazing potato mixture in the Egg Rolls and Veg Rolls, which is superb. They are generous with the amount of filling they give.

The so-so dishes: The Noodles here are tasty. They are once again very generous with the quantity and hence, a half-plate noodle is enough for 1 person. I have not tried the Gravy Noodles but the Hakka Noodles are all tasty. Biriyani has been a recent addition to their menu and the Mutton Biriyani is good. You can go for these dishes too! You won't be disappointed.

The not-so-good dishes: The Combos they have never impressed me. They have a few Chinese Combos and none are upto the mark. Maybe the taste of the items or the combination of the combo is what I have never liked.

This place is extremely pocket-friendly and the cost for two would approximately be 250 at maximum. This place has benches for customers to sit and have their food but no tables are being provided which is a slight drawback when heavy food items like Biriyani is considered. They have started selling Kebabs too in recent times although, I have never tried them.
