I'm a regular at Zomato.
ordered from this restaurant , bloody unprofessionals, no body picked up the phone, instead food was delivered from Don Giovannis and they delivered the worst pizza of my life.
big thumbs down to Zomato, Don Giovannis and Kung Pao... all

Order Mixed Chilli Garlic Halka Noodles, Gravy Chilly Chicken and chicken Sweet Corn Soup. The delivery was just on time. I would like to clear out that the food was not delivered from kung pao but don giovanis instead. Have been ordering from don giovannis for late night cravings. Never tried their chinese though, usually order italian or continental. That doest really matter but i thought it might be important to point out. Starting with the soup, it was mediocre, sweet corn soup should be a bit sweet but there was no sweetness in the soup, that ultimately boils down to personal preference. The chilly garlic noodles was good.l, quantity of prawns and chicken was impressive, wanted spicy noodles and kungpao did not disappoint in that field. The chilly chicken was also pretty good, it had about 10 medium pieces. The quantity was good enough for two people with a medium appetite. The bill was for about 780 which was a bit high. I had no complaints with the food whatsoever but the food/quality to price ratio was not sublime. There a few equally good joints to order Chinese from on a slightly lower budget. 

Ps. not a critic review. Just a regular consumer.

Happy Eating;)

Pathetic experience. Yesterday visited this place with family(10 people). First and last time we have tried this place. Very poor services. Staffs are worthless. I don't know how old this place, but its sure that they have no prior experience of how to serve people. we ordered two types of soup(chicken clear and hot and sour) and barbecue chicken first. What they did, they first served the chicken item and hot and sour soup (for 4 people) and after we 4 people finished our soup and they taken away our dishes and bowl, and we showed our impatience then they served for our rest 6 members with chicken clear soup , without any dish below the bowl. and replied that they don't have sufficient dishes to serve now!!!!! 
We kept our order more simple this time and ordered fried rice, chili chicken for all and one schezwan chicken. One thing food quality was good but quantity was too less(as we have different experience with Hatari or China Town(Big Boss etc. )usually when we thing for Chinese lunch or dinner). 
Hight of tolerance came at the end when we ordered cold drinks and it came in glasses with lipstick mark and dried food remaining marks. Me and my husband felt shame for taking our family and guest there. Further we will think several times before choosing a new place for food.

This outlet of Kung Pao is better known/actually named as Don Giovanni's. We went there on a Saturday night to have dinner. The decor is pretty much impressive with cool wall hangings and all. The place was clean too.

We ordered Lemon Coriander Chicken Soup as an appetizer. Then we ordered Latme Ki Chicken as starter. Then we placed our order for Bang Bang Chicken and Burnt Garlic Fried Rice which had corn and mushroom alongwith other vegetables. We finished our dinner with Pepsi and vanilla icecream with chocolate sauce. It was a good experience.

I really loved the food. Though the prices are a bit on the higher side, considering the location it is not much! Moreover, we had a food coupon which made the meal cost real cheap.

I really do not understand why this is such an underrated restaurant. They have really decorated the place well, their food is good, and staffs are also friendly. And, their washroom, though being small, was clean.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Been to this place on friday night with office team. Rating is 3.5 because of the service from the staff. The service is slow and even the staff dont have proper coordination. The food quality is good. We had hakka noodles, fried rice, hunan chicken, chicken sweet corn soup, drums of heaven, hot garlic chicken, bang bang chicken, crispy chilli babycorn, chilli chicken, veg manchurian, chili garlic fried rice, desserts, etc. All the dishes were good but the service has dissappointed me. Last order till 3.30am so you get to have good food till late night and thats another good thing here.

Kung pao is situated bang opposite to bypass dhaba on EM bypass. I have visited the place after reading a good review from a trusted source, and then I saw the ratings on Zomato after finishing the meal here. Why is it rated so low on Zomato, I have no clue simply. It is also mentioned that the place has no seating, while it has. The décor is wonderfully done, with the concept and theme of Godfather movies. One thing to be mentioned is that this place is also named as Don Giovanni's but both are the same.
I went along with three friends on a weekday afternoon for lunçh and the place was empty. Chairs and sofas are there for a comfortable seating. We ordered for 3 bowls of veg corn fried rice, exotic veg from the gravy part alongwith shredded garlic chicken. Wait, I am never a veg person but had to manage this day as two of the other people were. Never mind, the food was absolutely great in taste. I liked the rice much, and all the quantities were sufficient enough. 
The pricing is in a medium range and the food justifies the same. So will be hoping to come back to try some other dishes as well. Recommended.

It was a family dinner, we choose Bypass dhaba but because of the huge crowd we had to cross the other side of the road and went for this one.
Nd trust me, it was a wise move.
Starting from entering the restaurant and till the food was served, I had no complaints.
The only complaint which I had in my mind is "Why did they not open a outlet in the extreme north ? ,"
I hope by this you can understand how my amazingly tasty the food was. The environment was cozy and staffs always had a smile on face. The food had the quality , uniqueness and quantity.
I had already added it in my list. 
14 pple cannot say the same thing , " Lo karlo baat ishe kehetey hain dish ".

Situated right beside The Bypass Dhaba. Nice ambience with polite staff. 
1. Lemon pepper vegetable soup- Something different, but expected it to be a clear soup instead of cornflour soup.
2. American corn pepper salt- crispy and fried accurately.
3. Mix vegetable hot garlic - This dish contained a lot of vegetables I didn't really know off, yet the food was spicy and tasty.
4. Veg Manchurian- This was extremely spicy and had too much of red chilli flakes in it.
5. Pan fried noodles- Didn't like the taste of it. It smelt burnt too.
6. Burnt ginger fried rice - Expected this to be a little different, but it tasted like normal boiled rice.
The overall experience was good, service was appreciated. The best thing about Kung Pao is that they deliver to every place in Kolkata. Prices are steep but affordable at times. Rupsa Kumar

Always love the food at Kung Pao which live up to the standards of Don Giovanni. Great food and a nice peaceful ambiance which is surprising since it's just off E.M Bypass. Service was great and the gave us the food very quickly even though the place was busy. 
One of the best for classic Calcutta Chinese especially with their chili chicken and Hakka chow. And the quality of the lamb and the fish was also very good and very fresh. 
You should stop by here on the way to Salt lake if you want great Chinese food at a good price.

First visit was not very disappointing.. We ordered a plate of chicken dimsums, and chili chicken for starters. The dimsums were good, but they serve 5 pieces which to my mind is an odd number to serve even if 2 people were to order, but the taste was good. The chili chicken was bit disappointing as they literally fried the chicken in soy sauce. When I gave them a feedback, they countered me by saying that it was add a Smoky flavor. Sounds ridiculous.. But accepted. Next when we ordered the mail course of 2 chicken noodles, 1 fried rice, 1 Kung Pao chicken (supposedly their signature dish) and 1 fish.. Again the problem was excessive use of soy sauce. My request to the management would be that plz understand, Chinese doesn't mean food dipped in soy sauce.

This was my 2nd visit to the restaurant. We had called for a take away order. We ordered Nasi Goreng the Indonesian styled fried rice and The Bang Bang Chicken.... I will have to say that the food was just awesome.... Especially the Nasi Goreng mixed version is to definitely try for.... The Bang bang Chicken was a similar preparation to Chilly Chicken but the black beaned sauce was what made it really stand out.... Restaurant ambience is pretty decent. Quality and the quantity of food make it a really budget friendly restaurant.

Last Saturday, I opted for trying a few dishes from this outlet for delayed lunch. As it is a reputed chain, the expectations were a bit high. As it is for two heads , I chose three items to take away. The guys were cordial enough to impress. However, the dishes were not upto the desirable mark. The mixed fried rice was tad bland. You must be a sleuth to trace out chicken cubes in it. Some of the shrimps were  not properly deveined. Only fried egg  pieces dominated. The Kung Pao special Fried Rice was a big letdown. Full of red chilly , it is unpalatably hot. Here again , chicken  had rare appearance. Devil's Chicken salvaged reputation of the Restaurant, to some extent. However, it is  not of high standard.
   Overall, the taste of the food , as experienced by me, doesn't match the quite high prices u pay.

It was 30th December 2016 that I ,with my mother and her friends went for dinner at Kung Pao.It is located at very convenient location just at the ending of MAA flyover towards chingrihata and near Bypass Dhaba.T he interiors were minimal but soothing to the eyes.The person who took our order appeared to be very courteous and was really trying to build a long term engagement with its customers.He was very co-operative and took every initiative to explain us the dishes given in the menu card.We ordered Veg Fried Rice Veg Manchurian,Egg wrapped fried rice,Mixed Fried Rice,Kung pao chicken,Taichen Chicken.The fried rice was excellent in taste and was light,however the egg wrapped fried rice did not meet our expectations and it was simply a veg fried wrapped in an omelette.The Kung Pao speciality chicken had an awe sum taste.We were disappointed by the Taichen Chicken as it was very sweet and spicy,something we didn't like.Veg Manchurian was average,nothing  worth mentioning.The service was quick and prompt.The overall experience was good and I would really recommend it to my friends and peers.

3. Blue lagoon~ Extremely sweet...

This place offers decent chinese food but a bit overpriced. I have tried their lamb which is fine, but chicken dishes failed to impress me. The main course is above average.  I loved the nasi goreng rice which is basically indonesian. As the name of the outlet suggested I ordered Kung pao chicken which failed to impress me. I liked the Yaki Soba noodels though. Moreover a place where you can get something different from the regular asian food we have in this locality.

শেষ পাতে নেওয়া হয়েছিল steamed rice with thai green cury with chicken ….. তা পেট ভরে যাওয়ায় মালটা বাড়িতেই গেছিলো বেশি।  খাসা খেতে হালকা স্বাদের ওপর আর বেশ হৃষ্টপুষ্ট মাপে। চেখে দেখতেই পারেন।

ওহো , রাত পোহালে যেমন সকালের জাগরণ দরকার, এনাদের darsan with ice-cream নেবেন। একটু গোলমরিচের ঝালের মোহ জাগিয়ে সে চলে যাবে- শেষ আনন্দের মতন।

সব মিলিয়ে দাম দিয়েই বা কটা আর ভালো জিনিস পাওয়া যায় ? ঢুকে পড়ুন।

A newbie in the town offering chinese and thai foods. Food quality was really good along with the service. Ambience was also quite good to have a nice family dining. A must visit for thai food lovers to pamper your taste buds.

Visited this place on dhoshmi with my best friend....the ambinance was good.That place is bigger than it looks. We had ordered Chinese and it was good but the manchaow soup was a bit disappointing though.
Overall had a great experience,enjoyed a great company and had lots of food.
P.S. Chinese food needs a bit improvement.

Visited Kung Pao for the first time this evening with 3 family members. Ambience and service are average. We liked Talumein soup and Chinese Chopsuey. Kung Pao chicken was very good. But Burmese Khao Swey (fish) was a disappointment - this dish is also overpriced at Rs 500+. 

I gave my credit card for payment but they brought it back after a few minutes and said that the card machine was not working and we needed to pay cash.

We went there on the day of Nabami. The best part is that they could accommodate us within 5 minutes. But then we have wait for more then 10 minutes for getting the table clean. The service wad miserable. They wanted to feed us steamed rice and chilly fish to minimise their efforts. Only when we were about to walk out they agreed to serve us Thai food. The food per se were good. The Tom Yam soup was flavourful and wholesome. They suggested that wr have minced chicken with hot basil as start. They dish is delicious but can never pass as a starter. The jhad thai and nasi goreng were fine. Green curry prawn was a little too sweet. They did not have any dessert. They could not accept cards. I would recommend to pack food from here but to never dine here. If they have to improve this place they need train their staff.

On Nabami(yesterday) me, my wife and my friends with their family went for dinner in Kung Pao. We are amazed to see some empty seats available in the pick hours at 10pm night,wherein all the resultants were having tough time to manage long waiting queue outside the restaurants. We ordered mixed fried rice and bang bang chicken two plates for 4 people. But when the food came we supprised to see that they surved two plates of fried rice in one small bowl. Same with the chicken dish as well. The food quality was horrible. The quantity is so less, that we had to have something at home in dinner. When we complained that, why have they served in one bowl as we are two family. They just ignored as they dont bother.
My rating is 0. I will not recommend anyone to visit that place if you dont want your dining experience to go worst..

This is one more outlet of the kung pao restaurants recently opened in Calcutta. When we came in the restaurant one cute pug was sitting for our welcome. The interior was nice having small laughing Buddha statues hanged on the walls indicating it to be a traditional Chinese restaurant. There were some people waiting for the tables. The restaurant was house full. We decided to start the dinner by ordering an appetiser such as a soup. As you all know The Manchow soup is the signature of a Chinese restaurant. So we ordered it. While it was in order, our server kept 2 glasses and went. Even after half an hour our glasses were unfilled. We had to request the server to pour water in the glass.
After that the soup came, we were exited and thought it would be tasty. But when I tasted it was lame and was not up to the mark.
We also ordered chicken in wine sauce and Cantonese noodles. When it was served the server mixed the noodles and the chicken. Thankfully the noodles was tasty with a juicy flavor. But then we ate the chicken and that was baddest. A foul smell of wine was coming through it and I thought that they just half cooked the chicken ...poured the chicken stew in a bowl and poured wine in it. It was totally taste less . Somehow we managed to finish it up. The bad part was both the wine sauce ( which was not a sauce) and the noodles got mixed up as the server did so, the noodles to on started to taste bad.
But I think they could have served us better.
Wish to have better food next time.

Well what could be more amazing that we managed to get a place to eat during Durga Puja and that too the food was better than what a lot of restaurants would offer during normal days, so a big high five to this place

It's a great place to eat & surely prefer the Burmese food.... One of its kind!! Must also try the special chilly chicken & Thai chilly eggs.... Super ambience!! It's not that far too & a small drive away from Ballygunge!! 
Service too is good & the service people are very cordial ✔️

Ever since its inception this restaurant caught my attention everyday on my way to office. Finally last Sunday while it rained heavily we two friends along with our kids decided to visit Kung Pao after a fun filled session in Nicco Park.

The staffs welcomed us with a smile. There was no extravaganza in the ambience yet it was elegant and cosy. We ordered Cantonese style pan friend chicken noodles, Fish in chilly oyster sauce with broccoli and mushroom, Hakka Chicken noodles and lastly Honey chicken. All the items were cooked with care and expertise. We started with Cantonese noodles which contained a slightly spicy sauce and it tasted delicious along with the crispy noodles. The fresh and soft fish chunks were cooked perfectly in the chilly oyster gravy. The Hakka noodles was decent enough but not extraordinary. Honey chicken was sweet as it should be and the chicken pieces were quite soft unlike many other restaurants.
The service was prompt and the staffs were extremely courteous. Overall its a complete package of awesome food, commendable service and soothing ambience.

Kung Pao the brain child of the owners of Don Giovanni's is a new kid on the block. Having opened 3outlets in the city, the brand is currently on an expansion spree. This particular outlet is located adjacent to the bypass dhaba. 
I visited it a week back and found the place to be cosy and warm. 
The staff was extremely welcoming and inviting.
We were seated in one of the bigger tables.
The overall place is dimly lit with black furniture and tangerine walls. Few paintings and lights dominate the decor. An interesting rope installation separates the seating area from the billing desk.

My order was veg steam momos which came piping hot with a fiery hot sauce- just as I like it. 
For mains there was schezwan fried rice along with Paneer chilli. 
Both the dishes were made really well and the portion was a lot for two. 
The rice gets a special mention as I really liked the schezwan preparation. We also ordered a soft drink to help with the otherwise spicy meal.

Pricing is just like Don Giovanni's and is reasonable in terms of the quality of food and ambiance.

Best wishes to Mr. Singh for his upcoming new outlets and I hope that the chain flourishes in no time!
