Had ordered shawarma salad with pita and humus. It was served hot. Pita was soft. Salad contained way more capsicum and onion than pieces of chicken. Other than that, it was really good to taste.

Ordered the chicken shawarma which tasted pretty much average. The delivery time is not much and the presentation is also very basic. I don't think I'll give it a second try.

Located in the food court of Forum Mall,this place is most likely the pioneer of Lebanese food in Calcutta.

I have tried out their Chicken Shawarma Roll,Shawarma Salad and Sandwich back when  attended coaching classes nearby.

The items can be considered overpriced for the portions served and their sister branch at Spencer's, South City Mall is way better in all aspects.
