A good place to satisfy your gluttony for typical bangali fried foodstuffs like moghlai paratha, fish fry, cutlets, kabiraji etc. The huge moghlai paratha does need a special mention since it is as much tasty as it looks. The other fried chops are too delicious too.

Visited this place on 29.08.2017 at evening hours for some snack time. We ordered one egg and one chicken roll. Service was fast but the rolls were not tasty.

This has been a childhood favourite and still continues to be one.... their moghlai paratha is my favourite. Cutlets and fries are good too and come in decent prices.

Reading good reviews of this place regarding Mughlai paratha, I tried it, but didn't like it at all. I get a better egg parantha at my office, way more delicious than this.
My sister liked the Fish Fry though.

Small joint at beleghata. Tell me someone who stays in beleghata doesn't knows it. Initially it was just a "telebhaja" shop but now it has been serving wide range. But still now I find the chops way better. I think whenever you stumble upon this give it a shot with their famous fish fry butter chicken fry . Both are just delicious. Great for nibble bits !

This place proves how nostalgic things can be in someone's life. It's a very ordinary place in North Kolkata but serves one the tastiest food. Fish fry, Veg cutlet, Egg Devil name it and you will get it here. The finger food that is dear to a Kolkatan's heart is found here. The place is difficult to spot but well known to the locals.

Its hard to find someone living in Beleghata but never been to Satyanarayan. I don't even remember when I first visited here. Not a single brick has changed since then. Fish fingure, fish fry, all sorts of chops, kobirajis and cutlets are among their specialties. Price is still very pocket friendly.

A popular option for snacks at Belaghata, this place is famous for Fries, Cutlets and other fast food options. Had tried the noodles here. Was quite good. Their Chinese too apparently seems to have a lot of buzz recently.

Satyanarayan is a street side joint, situated beside the Beliaghata Allahabad Bank bus stop. They excell in fried food such as cutlets, chops, fish finger, egg devil and the quintessentially famous moghlai paratha.
Recently, they have opened a Chinese outlet too, adjacent to the previous one. Chowmien, momos, soup are all quite tasty, but a word of caution - they use MSG generously. So I always specify not to add any MSG in my food in particular.
This outlet is famous for a quick evening bite, with minimal pocket-pinch, among localites and passers-by.

This eatery has always been famous for its quintessential North Indian and Moghlai dishes, but lately its Chinese branch (just next to it!) is also fairing well. Their varied kinds of momo are pretty delicious and pocket-friendly. The other dishes too are quite tasty. It's a good try! Worth the money, probably.

This place is famous for fish fry, cutlet and kabiraji. I tried their fish fry, fish finger, egg chop, chicken cutlet. All have their own good taste. Recently their chinese outlet is also coming up.

I live near this place and I use to be quite often to this place. It was first known for snacks like fish fries and all kind of fried snacks.  I love the fish fry. It is worth the price. I also tried the kabiraji. It was average as it was too oily. It had pure fish and less coating. Now they also make fast foods. Chowmin is nice and the quantity was good. One can try this place for evening snacks. I am sure one will not regret it. I deducted a point for the ambience. The sitting area is not at all nice. It is rather dirty. It is an old place so they have that traditional factor in their food.

It really isn't good at all,I would ask you to never try it. The food isn't good, so isn't the quality. It tastes normal, less than normal actually. Do not eat here.

Remember those old cabins.. This place is a piece of my childhood..we didn't have ccd or baristas den. We had satyanarayan and its mughlai paratha ,fish fry,kabiraji,devil and vegetable chob. Coming to the cons its dirty , not quite sit and enjoy with stained steel plates... The condition of the kitchen will not meet the standards of hygene freaks.. But for a petuk like me all this vanishes when I see the moghlai paratha in front of me.. Al though quality has detorieted over time but still it's the best mughlai paratha in town. Fish finger vegetable chop are also a must try.. U will always find a huge crowd in front of the tiny shop around 6 pm. And that says enough about the quality of the food this shop serves

as an old customer I got into this place yesterday to try chicken kobiraji..but sorry to say that their food quality is not upto the mark that it used to be any more..the coating covering the cutlet was so much oily that it seemed to taste like a piece of cloth drenched in oil !so much oil should have been strained out...the main cutlet was lacking salt..and it hardly contained any chicken..I am also suspicious about the hygiene they maintain regarding the cooking oil and other materials as our family suffered from some ailment immediately after consuming their food..I request the restaurant authority to look into the matter..our family visit this place very often and used to be one of the loyal customers of them..-but everybody knows that customer loyalty can get damaged by an unfavourable experience..

A regular customer, as it's quite close to my place, I enjoy their mutton cutlet and fish fry. There is also the Chinese outlet under the same named shop, just beside it! Their chicken momos are pretty good and sumptuous. The price is very pocket-friendly, hence you can indulge in some real junk food, anytime!
It's best if the food is parceled. :)

Just beside my house a good fast food center they are famous in our locality for their awesome moghlai parathas they r just fab. But best enjoyed at home not there cause the place where the seating are arranged stinks and also always full of smoke as they us traditional Chula. Else every food is superb.

I had intense craving for fried junk food...  and after reading the reviews, i had to try the devil's egg and the moghlai paratha... and i did just that..
 The devil's egg was too good ... awesome combination with kasundi... the moghlai paratha... well bit too crisp for my taste... good none the less... its good for takeaway... cheap ....come here for the regular snacks

Its located near my college & house.So I eat here a lot.I was a regular customer when I was in college.
Believe me,if there is any place that serves the yummiest Tele vaja(fried food) in very low price,its Satyanarayan! 
In college times,me & my frnds used to buy fish fingers & various chops,devils from here & ate them on the way to home.
Every item is so so tasty! The cutlets,moghlai paratha... just wow! 
Do try!

I remember, when I was in class 10. My mother asked me that what i would love to have if I can get good scores in boards. I asked her to buy me every single item of Satyanarayan. Though I did not get that reward, now that's a different story.

They are one of the best in Calcutta. And I seriously meant it. Cheap, Delicious, Fresh, Decent Service, Value for Money and the most important part - the flavor of North Calcutta. Televaja is evergreen. Burp!

In the foodie friend circle, a friend read my reviews on some of the places serving chops and cutlets and asked me if i would like to be corrected and that too in half the price . I was like " your kidding me right ??!!??". And she just blew it off in a laughter and i got a diwali gift in advance . A hamper made with Egg Devils and Fish fingers, believe me i was speechless. 

The fish fingers, in spite of the modest packing was still crisp and super delicious , gingery , spicy, delicious .... and those egg devils i cant explain were one of the best i have eaten . Not the best, but sill very very close . and remarkably pocket friendly i was told. 

Next evening i got what i call an itch in my palette, and i went down and hunted this place. and what came in my hands were as follows: 

Duck Egg Moghlai Paratha : Okie , i am not a huge fan of moghlais, but duck egg is my poison. and this moghlai was addictive. The flavors were brilliant and they were served with this real simple aloo. i cant explain how good it was 

Mutton breast cutlet : The best i thought were made by diskhusha but this was like VOILA !.. The onions in them gave taht hint of sweetness. it pressed the right buttons and i was swooning   with joy 

The vegetable chop : well what should i say THE vegetable chop . Should i call it chop of the moment. i couldn't get enough of them . simply awesome 

Fish fry : Thick fillet of fish and just the right amount of spices, and not even slight fishy odor. the fish was soft and flaky as well, absolutely fresh. loved it .  

The fish finger was given another shot when piping hot it tasted even better and did the egg devil . 

The place is a old shop, near divine nursing home, the walls have blackened with oil fumes, but do i care NOPE ! The taste and freshness of the food was fantastic . The man on the counter was very sweet and explained things to me as i was a novice to many items he had . 

I have a new addiction ! and will have to push my workout more to accommodate this once in a while ...

As this place is behind my house, I have eaten here a lot of times. Although many claim that this place is good for kabiraji and fry, my personal favorite is definitely the Moglai paratha. if you are a fan, then either come here for a sit-down or takeaway the Moglai Paratha and the Egg Devil. Total value for money. However, if you are one of those who want a fancy ambiance to go with it, beware! this place has no such thing. In fact, you would be given a long bench to sit on while you wait for your order to be ready. However, service is very fast, so don't be worried about being late.
