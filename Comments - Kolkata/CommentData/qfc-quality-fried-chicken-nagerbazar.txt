Fried chicken at its best. I have burnt my tongue n mouth quite a few times here really its so tasty n served hot. Though the size has been reduced as compared to the initial times still its very cheap n a worthy kfc substitute. If you want good fried chicken n are not looking for comfortable seating this is the place. Burgers are also very good

Ordered 2 plates of Hot Crispy Strip, the service is good but very slow they took around 20 mins to serve a plate of the hot crispy strip.
There are no such sitting arrangements and the ambience is not good enough, but the quality and prices are very attractive.
The hot crispy strip contains solid chicken and it only cost 45 for 3 pieces which are quite big in size.
The other dishes are also economical.
Hope, I will go there within some weeks again.

Ordered for a Bestseller combo from QFC.
Cheaper alternate to KFC.
The combo came with a Chicken Burger, French Fries, A fried leg piece and cold drinks.
The burger was good, the french fries were nice too. They were very much deep fried. The leg piece was repulsive honestly.

The Kolkata's KFC. 
They have almost everything in their menu as KFC. 
Tastes almost the same if not similar but 
Tried the wings and fried chicken. 
It's a lot cheaper.
Didn't miss KFC at all.
Wish it was near my place.

KFC like fried chicken at really affordable rates and bigger quantity is what you get here. The menu offers Chicken Pakora, Chicken Lollipop, Crispy Chicken Leg and Breast, Burgers etc all in KFC style.
A must try place for everyone but be prepared to wait as there is always a queue outside this joint.

The food here is too tasty and reasonable. If you want to have KFC type food at a much reasonable price and above all without tax then I will strongly recommend this place to everyone.

Have tried popcorns, crispy chicken fry and fish fingers. Really pretty close to the original KFC. The quantity is also good in comparison to the price. They really have put KFC into challenge. Having said that, the fish fingers are not so good. The quality of fish need to be better.

Tried their wings, burger and popcorn chicken. Must say they're a very close dupe for KFC. Really crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside, and i was really impressed with the quantity as well. However their burgers are a bit dissapointing, it lacked mayo, and more importantly - chicken.
If you're interested to try something, go for the combos.

Following the opening of kfc outlets in kolkata, many food outlets sprang up across kolkata like ifc, dfc, qfc etc which offer same food items but at affordable and cheap prices and without the gst and with a little compromise in quality. QFC is one such outlet. The place remains always crowded and u have to wait for almost 30 min before getting what you ordered. Hot crispy chest and hot crispy leg are two food items one should try here. Chicken popcorn didn't appealed to me much. Another good thing about them is they accept paytm.

This place is located near Nagerbazar, at the joint of Gorakkhabasi road. You have to give order and make payment first, they will give you the bill and a number on it. Upon waiting for some time they will call and serve your order. Quality and quantity wise chicken popcorn and crispy leg pieces were really good at reasonable price.
