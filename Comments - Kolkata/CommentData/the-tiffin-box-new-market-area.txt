Nothing Much to talk about this place.
Basically Yesterday I was going for puja shopping in Esplanade area and after completed my shopping, i decided to eat rolls here .. so, ordered a chicken roll. it was nice but not that much good ( Very Thin Paratha)
Ambiance was typical roadside shop..
For puja season there was a small queue.
For quick bite it is a decent place

Located just opposite to esplanade sreeleathers.. Street food is d only option when u r tired aftr completion of puja shopping nd u don't have dat much time in ur hand to go for any restro.  So i visited dis place nd ate chicken noodles bcz it takes few mins.  It was good..  Nd tried pista kulfi.  It was too good.

Heard a lot about this place. Hence, thought to give it a try. Firstly the place is bit congested, a bit(actually very bad) low on hygiene. We ordered Two Mixed Chowmeins and Two plate chilli chicken. The chilli chicken served was totally cold and the how tasted bad. In all this place needs a check on their quality cause despite all this they are liked by most people visiting the place.

Located just opposite to Sreeleathers of New Market area. This is a little-bigger-than-small kiosk that is always buzzing with people taking break from shopping in the area. 
I've been here a couple of times and their food both in quality and quantity has gone worse over the time. Out of the entire lot the best picks would be mutton and chicken roll, masala dosa , mixed noodles and chicken rice.

I can't forget the kulfi faluda here.Twice a day made me happy and energetic to explore more of the city.The big chicken roll was enough to munch up my hunger.But ,I would rate it's kulfi faluda more than any other items as I loved the gesture of one uncle ji who used to instruct his fellow to put in some more and more faluda on my kulfi as I pay him the money.

Street food served with a twist!Tried their kesariya kulfi with falooda on a hot scorching summer afternoon!The kulfi is less sweet and creamy!

It's a perfect place to satisfy your taste buds with some Momo's and rolls ..
Went for the first time with my friends yesterday and ordered chicken fried momo and steam Momo's and chicken roll. 
The fried momo was a bit oily but delicious..Serves 6 in a plate and the size and stuffing is ok..so was for the steam one.Chicken roll was really the best to taste in the platter..the place looks a bit shabby as it's on the road but as per food is concerned i will definitely count on it.as it's fast ..Food is very tasty...And it's reasonable.So would definitely make another visit to the place again.

The Tiffin Box is located opposite to Shreeleathers. A much popular food junction selling varity of food. This store remains crowded almost everytime of the day. I had their chicken roll and also their Chowmine on another visit. Food is okay type. Can't say good. But it was okay.
Prices are as per street food.

It is a roadside food joint. The food is tasty. We took egg chicken roll: it was larger than the regular size, and had loads of chicken pieces inside it; and kulfi: which was watery and not so good.
We were lucky to get seats there because in a few minutes after we seated ourselves, the place became full and people started to sit on the chairs placed in rows on the pavement.

With pocket friendly food and a wide options this place is always abuzz with people.... d  street food joint offers happy bite for those looking for a lighter spend on d go.

Cumin to the quality it's plain average but then can come as a saving dose when hunger pangs puts u off after all d shopping....

The Tiffin Box is opposite of Shreeleathers. This place remains crowded most of the time and you will need to wait in que to get your food.
I found the food to be poor in Quality. Rolls are horribly bad. I tried their Mughlai Paratha I couldn't have more then half of it.
Chowmine looks white, very oily and is tasteless. Hardly you will find a few Chicken pieces on it.

The place is dirty with dogs roaming around and scattered food lying here and there.

A roadside eatery, very popular and very old in new market! This is developing since i last saw it, been upgrading itself. For Rolls, noodles and proper taste of kolkata fast food you really need to visit the place. This is the best option for grabbing a quick chicken roll, although its almost crowded maximum of the time. One more suggestion don't be picky about hygiene when you come to this place, just dig in.

Situated near new market. Old aged restaurant flourishing day by day. Serves Chinese, mughlai and sound indian snacks. very impressed with hospitality and ambience. Service was quick and presentation was ok. Friendly managers and friendly staff. Well maintained sitting arrangement. Prices were reasonable and pocket friendly. I tried their veg momos which were very Delicious, soft and properly filled with veggies. and I tried veg chowmin with gravy which was also very tasty, spicy and true desi Chinese tastes. Their south indian snacks were also good. Liked it completely. Must try place. Recommended to all.

This is a over crowded road side joint just opposite to Shree leather's.... There have some benches & chairs for the people who want to have their meal.... Very unhygienic & untidy place.... I tried their chicken egg chowmin, taste wise it was good.... Quantity wise it was sufficient for one person.... Staff behavior was average....  Pricing was ok....

This is a roadside eatery with a myriad of choices to offer. There is no sitting area as such but a few benches are arranged for so that people can sit and eat. This had been one of my regulars during college days. Now I haven't been there for long. Their rolls and chowmins are quite tasty.

This place is located just opposite to Sreeleather outlet and is decent for quick bite.
There is seating arrangement (benches and chairs) for 12-15 people in front and most of the time this joint remains crowded.
As a typical roadside fast food centre, they serve noodles, rice, rolls, mughlai parathas at a reasonable price. I had tried their noodles and rolls and both the items tasted just average. They don't maintain proper hygiene too. 
Their service is quick and overall it is a decent enough place to avail fast food. If one is around New market and looking for a place to have some quick bites, can avail The Tiffin Box.

This is a roadside food joint. You will be finding only chairs and Benches here. The food tastes very good considering its price. Affordable food for all shopping lovers who come to esplanade. They can stop here for a 5-10 mins to grab a snack. We had egg chicken chowmein and chicken momo. Both were equally delicious. Also biryani, chicken pakoda and kababs are also available. Would really like to taste the Biriyani next time.

This place is quite underrate (literally in terms of number of reviews :-P). It's a tiny place with no proper tables but just benches to sit. It's a roadside joint and the food here is really quite impressive. The Chinese flavours are more Indian - oriented but they have a really nice taste. The rice and noodles are quite filling. Even the momos are very tasted. I specially love the soup with the momos. 
The Chilli Chicken they serve is very tasty in its own distinct way. And the quantity is huge for the price. 
The Chicken Roll is also delicious. I love the naan as its crispy and tasty. 
So I believe this is a nice place to have exceptionally cheap yet good food. I have given it a 4 because the flavours are there and I believe, even though this joint does not appeal much when compared to the other fine dining restaurants, the food is great for the standard they have established. And as a roadside joint, it definitely deserves nothing less than a 4!

Basically it is a road side dhaba located centrally in the new market area opposite to sreeleathers. An absolute delight for quick titbits .
We ordered a perfectly cooked steamed momos which was absolute juicy and filled with chicken. We had egg chicken roll and a double chicken roll which actually made us full.
Next time I would surely try out their biriyani because the people those were having it in a relished manner  made my mouth watered. But I was too full that day .
So we tried a soda sikanji , a kulfi and a green mango sarbat. All were quite good.

In Feb 2016 I tried this Outlet In New Market Area, I loved the place, its a Road side Joint.
But their Quantity of Chowmin & Fried rice, More than enough for me.
Egg-Chicken Fried rice & 85 rs.
Mixed chowmin: chicken+egg+mutton = pocket friendly.
I did not have to wait long, they cook & serve REAL FAST
