Everyone needs a reliable local food joint that can whip up some commendable dishes to suit the financial restrictions and yet enjoy a good mouthful over some weekend adda session. Lately I've dialed down on ordering from this place but when there was nothing satisfying to eat this evening and I was tired to cook something, my brother brought a plate of Pan Fried Chicken Momo so that I could wait till dinner.

The dish was a tad salty for my palette but the momos had sumptuous and tasty fillings and the pan sauce had a punch regarding its heat. The saltiness came from the disregard in the excessive usage of soy sauce and the bellpeppers could have done with a bit more crunch. All in all, it was an average platter which served its purpose of calming the wolves when needed.

I am happily surprised to find this restaurant on zomato. This one's just opposite to my house and my go to fast food joint. Have tried almost everything of this place eg: Ch Biryani, Tikka, Roll, Dry Chilly Chicken, Fried Rice, Chowmein, Fish Fry, Chicken Kassa, Momo's, Laccha Paratha,etc. Pretty decent taste wise, food portions are good for a heavy meal, and very light on pocket.
The bad is the unhygienic conditions the food is prepared and for pure vegans you can give this place a miss.
Thumbs Up for the owner who caters to me even until 11pm in the night or late afternoons when they are resting. The staff is very courteous. You always need such a backup place for unavoidable "food" circumstances.

Going out for a dinner with family or friends in china town. Then this will be a pretty good option. Well delicious food, good quality, friendly environment with good service even during the festival they provide good service. One thing worth mentioning dishes including prawn are very much over priced.  No doubt prawns are tasty and good quality but it really pinches the pocket. Overall good Chinese to go with a family dinner.

A good joint for Chinese food located at silpara. Well they offer good noodles and momos. The only concern is their roll which is so-so. Well as a joint it's a good one and it provides best Chinese food at silpara locality.

If you are in Silpara & want a roll, get here. This is the only roll center which used lachha paratha in their rolls.They also sell kebabs & tandooris. Of course there isn't any seating arrangement. Their biriyani is good for a road side shop,better try the newly opened azad hind dhaba for a more mughlai dish. However they also sell momos, taste of which am not sure of.
