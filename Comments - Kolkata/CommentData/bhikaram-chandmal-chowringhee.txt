We went to this place to give it a try, instead of going to the regular Haldiram near it.And believe me, that was a big mistake !! 
The upstairs seating is decent, so is the cleanliness.But the waiters are not very clean in doing things, and dressed very shoddily,though their behaviour is good. The prices are also pretty cheap but then came the food & everything went downhill from there.

Papri Chat - Was absolutely bland.Lacked the very essence of a Papri chat with hardly any papri in it.There was also a hair-strand in the dish !!!! One of the worst dishes I've had in a while(1.5/5)

Chinese Bhel - Another terribly made dish.Was almost nauseatic to say the least(1/5)

Corn Cheese Pizza - Was just about eatable.For the price, 4 slices were somewhat okay but the taste was yet again too bland & weird(2/5)

In short, the place is extremely bad in terms of taste of the food.Spend Rs.40-50 extra & eat at Haldiram.Atleast it would be worth it !! Or preferably go to Wow Momo located beside it !!
After returning home, my friend as well as I felt very vomitish !! Will never ever go back to this forgettable place.My suggestion would be to avoid it at all cost. Extremely disappointing food.

Very nicely made outlet and extra marks for cleaniess and hygiene.Staff is nice and cooperative. The best thing about the place is the timing, it opens as early as 9am for breakfast meets. But food taste is where it needs to work on to be a hit in this area close to haldirams. Chaats are recommend here, sandwich had less fillings as per my likings and less cheese too. The vada paw here was too spicy to eat and I couldn't eat after 2 bites and galloping a full bottle of water.

An awesome place for vegetarians. You can have light snacks like Raj Kachori, white sauce and red sauce pasta. There are quite a number of shakes available. You can try cheese dosa here.
Pocket friendly and easy to go !

A new outlet has been opened in chowringhee near exide more. Tried their vada pav. It was good and tasty. It can be a good competitor of haldiram. Cost is also lower than haldiram.
