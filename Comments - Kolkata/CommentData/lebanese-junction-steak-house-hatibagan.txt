Tried their shawarma salad. It sure lived upto my expectations in terms of taste. The price is also quite reasonable. Considering how few Lebanese restaurants are there in Kolkata (especially North Kolkata 😫), this place would be a good choice!

Located in Hatibagan. One of the best places for shawarma and salads. Food is good. A bit high on price though. Both quality and quantity are good.

Very poor experience... today I  went for a lunch with my two friends and ordered a chicken sizzler, one strongoff chicken and one chicken shawarma salad... strongoff was totally blunt in taste...even it was saltless...when we told them they returned it and give back by mixing pepper only... sizzler was disaster ...but the shawarma salad and pita bread was good...
Service very slow...
Disappointment 😥😥😥

Had fish and chips, Lebanese Shish Tawook with pita bread. Good food with decent taste. Fish and chips can be better. They mostly use frozen fish so the test is drab. Overall good junction to enjoy.

Located just beside the hallowed Star Theatre,this place has got a very limited seating capacity.It mainly serves as a take away joint.The service is quite fast and one would love to come back again for their array of lip smacking delicacies. I love their Kebabs,Shawarma rolls the grilled chicken.

I have never dined in here but I order mostly on zomato. First day i tried the chicken shawarma wrap and second the grilled chicken(half). The shell of the shawarma was so soft and the fillings were so tasty. Even the grilled chicken was well cooked. The quantity of the half plate was more than sufficient. Its definitely worth a try

My go to place for healthy food. Amidst old buildings of North Kolkata, this food joint makes their dishes in olive oil and doesn't make it too spicy or too sweet for anyone. Their dishes have a balanced flavour for our tongues. My favourite dish here have been and will be always the Chicken Shawarma Salad, yes Shawarma can have better options in other places but this place cooks their food with dedication and on point service.
Would definitely recommend people to visit once, the rest you'll understand.

I am not very much fond of steak & sizzler. I went there because of turkey . 
Trust me turkey wasnt that good food to have , mutton is far better than this.
Anyway we took turkey , per plate costs 400 .
Turkey meat is hard nd stiff .
Then we took chilly pork , pork was awesome spicy 
I loved pork there.
Pocket friendly 
Satisfied

Lebanese Junction is strategically located right at the Hatibagan crossing near Star Theatre and I am glad it exists. It is a local favorite for all the right reasons, serving some lip smacking steaks and lebanese dishes. I had visited this place on Monday for lunch and although it was my first time there, the friendly staff and the chilled ambiance comforted me alot. I tried quite a few of their signature dishes and was extremely satisfied with both the quality and quantity. Here's what I ordered:
1.Crispy fried calamari with wasabi dip
- Super crispy and super yum squids tasted stupendous with that Oh-So-Amazing Wasabi dip.

2.Chicken cordon bleau
-The superhit trio= Chicken-Ham-cheese all at one go..what more do You need?

3.Spicy mutton meat balls- Mouthwatering meatballs cooked in a spicy red gravy and topped with the right amount of cheese. Delicious!

4.Chicken mont blanc 
- Succulent pieces of chicken served with herbed rice and sauteed veggies, this is a crackling dish and quite filling.

5.Ham steak
- All Ham lovers! Unite! And do try this one to know why I am recommending this dish so strongly. Served with mashed potato, sauteed veggies and a poached Sunny Side Up on top. Super  Yum.

6.Chicken penne aglio olio
- Perfectly cooked pasta with whole lot of bell peppers and exotic veggies, has a creamy texture because of that cheese and is definitely going to make you smile a lot more after you are done eating.

7.Grilled chicken
- Healthy eating gets a little better with this one with perfectly grilled chicken being served with a curd dip and pickled onion.

8.Roasted turkey with plum sauce
- the HIGHLIGHT of the festive season. Turkey being the most expensive meat and rightfully so for the high protein and nutrient content was flamed and roasted to give the perfect roasted flavor. Priced at a very affordable rate (Rs 400), this is a MUST TRY this winter season. It was my first Turkey of the season and I was just too happy to demolish the entire plate and licked off that plum sauce shamelessly. it was THAT yumm.

9.Caramel custard 
- Desserts as they is Stressed spelled backwards. True because you have something called Caramel Custard on planet earth and Lebanese Junction did a fab job making it. 

10.Brownie with chocolate sauce- Last but never the least, I fell in love with this brownie, so much so that I couldn't help but parcel a 2nd one for home. It was chocolaty, it was crunchy and it was gooey, it was mouthwatering. You just cannot miss this one.

Perfect place to satiate your Steaks and Lebanese Cravings if you are in and around this area. And even if you are far, you must give this place a try because you would definitely not like to miss out on this one.

First of all Thanks to the owner of "Labenese junction' for inviting us and giving us the opportunity of having mouth watering dishes , and a special thanks goes to Tanamy basak for leading us.

🔍location - This place is very easy to find, its located just beside the hatibagan crossing.

👆Brief - Lebanese junction is the first restaurant which brought the Lebanese cuisine in kolkata. Being a foodie its like a heavenly opportunity to taste different flavours from all over the world.
It was my first visit, and i must say im coming over here again nd again.

💒Ambience - It was a nice place to come and have gala time with family or friends. Outdoor seating is available and the inside has the capacity of 30 to 35 people.

👤 Staff - staff are friendly and cordial.

😋Things tried -

🍴Spicy Mutton Meatballs - with the distinct layer of flavour and spices it has mouth watering succulence, this meatball is a must try dish with all heart!

🍴Calamari - Calamari is probably one of the most popular appetizers at restaurants. And here it was fresh, crunchy nd crispy. And the dip was wasabi with sawarma sauce which carries completely a different flavour and goes superb with calamari.

🍴Chicken Mont Blanc-it was basically a grilled chicken, with sauce nd served with fresh veggies and rice. The taste of rice enhanced with butter and herbs. It was a plate of blessing, all the health conscious foodies, a big hands up for this.

🍴Chicken Cordon Bleu - I can say only one thing about this dish - Where the chicken and cheese are like gifts, and the wrapper is ham, nd that's deeply fried in the oil of love! It was mouth smashing, with surprising flavour, it was served with some fresh veggies.

🍴Chicken Stroganoff with Penne - It was a twist of classic pasta dish, with white sauce, olive oil, chicken and veggies.

🍴Roasted Turkey - The first time i tasted Turkey, Without careful preparation, cooked turkey is usually considered to end up less moist than other poultry meats such as chicken or duck. But it was really juicy nd the plum oil was there to enhance the flavour of turkey. Turkey contains more protein per ounce than other meats so it has a great health benefits too.

🍴Ham steak - The Steak meat was very juicy and tender. It tasted heavenly, it was served along with some fresh vegetables, smashed potato, and a juicy omelet .

🍴Grilled Chicken - grilled chicken was actually bot a normal days grilled chicken.. I must say it was something different than that. The meat was not at all hard of out of flavours. It was perfectly combined with all the spices nd with a special "Lebanese junction" flavour.

🍴Caramel Custard - i always crave for the desert part, wherever i go. And here, the Caramel custard was awesome.

🍴Brownie - And then the dark chocolate Brownie 😍. I must say, it was the best Brownie ever i had in! my life. Don't go with my words,just go and try once.

💰Purse check - It was definitely a pocket friendly restaurant. The main thing i would love to mention is no need to wait till Christmas for a turkey feast, gift yourself an immense satisfaction with turkey just on ₹400.

☺️Overall - Would like to visit this place again. One of the best restaurant of North kolkata! A big thumps up for the owner to introduce the Lebanese flavour here in kolkata! ❤️ Lebanese junction

Located just beside the star theatre in hatibagan,this place serves an array of lip smacking lebanese cuisine.
Lebanese cuisine is a part of levantine cuisine that was a delicacy of Romans.
And lebanese junction being the first steak house in North Calcutta has lived upto the expectations of people.
Lebanese dishes are all about colours,flavours and textures.So let's explore the yummilicious lebanese cuisine.
MENU:-
1.Crispy fried calamari with wasabi dip-Juicy squid  coated in a spicy batter and dip fried till done.This was just awesome and the wasabi dip was totally out of the world.Priced at Rs 270 ,this is a must have dish for sea food lovers.
2.Chicken cordon bleau-Chicken topped with lots of cheese is a combination made in heaven.The chicken pieces  wrapped in ham then deep fried and generously topped with cheese will make you crave for it.
3.Spicy mutton meat balls-Served in a white ceramic dish,this dish was totally melt in mouth.Round shaped meat balls cooked in a red coloured spicy gravy and topped with grated cheese,this proved to be a absolute delight to the taste buds.
4.Chicken mont blanc-Chicken cooked in a flavourful sauce ,herbed rice and sauteed vegetables served atop a wooden dish.This one was mind blowing. The chicken was tender and juicy and the herbed rice perfectly complimented the chicken.
5.Ham steak-This dish arrived with 3 other elements i.e mashed potato,poached egg and sauteed veggies.
The ham steak was cooked in a delicious sauce and tasted yum.
6.Chicken penne aglio olio-Penne pasta cooked with red ,green and yellow bell peppers and shredded chicken topped with cheese and exotic herbs.Perfectly cooked and tasted awesome.
7.Grilled chicken-A very healthy option for people  who want eat yummy food and not put on weight. The chicken was grilled to perfection and was ultra soft and was served with curd dip and pickled onion.
8.Roasted turkey with plum sauce-This was their Christmas special dish. Priced at just Rs 400,this is a must have dish. The turkey was uniformly cooked and the flavours perfectly complimented the dish.
It was served with french fries and sauteed vegetables.
9.Caramel custard-No meal is complete without deserrt and so we were served this delicious looking caramel custard. It was perfectly done neither too sweet nor too bland. The soft and creamy texture made me its fan.More than happy with this dish.
10.Brownie with chocolate sauce-Now comes the dish which is my all time favourite and no matter what i will always have a corner left to indulge in this sinful looking brownie. The brownie was totally melt in mouth and was topped with hot chocolate sauce. A must must have dish.

Service was quick and the staff was very helpful.
Decor was minimal but very attractive.A must visit place in kolkata.Will surely visit again to try their other delicacies.

Located amidst the hustling bustling street of Hatibagan, the Lebanese junction is a hidden gem that you need to explore once if you are in the city.The delicious food speaks for itself and is quite popular for home delivery among local residents.Looking at christmas menu ,I could not help but head over to sample the christmas turkey with plum sauce.Their service just makes you feel at home and so i did not or more precisely could not stop at just the Turkey.

On my plate
🍁Crispy fried Calamari with wasabi sauce--I am not a seafood lover but I could not help myself from nibbling on these crispy fried beauties.The sauce served alongside was the cherry on the cake.The pungent taste of the wasabi beautifully subdued by the creamy sauce.
🍁Spicy meatballs--Piquant,peppery and hot is exactly the words that describe this dish.None the less ,the flavours will surprise you in every bite
🍁Chicken Cordon Bleu--Chicken and cheese gets better when wrapped in ham and deep fried.Topped with a generous serving of creamy cheese sauce get ready to get your minds blown
🍁Chicken Mont Blanc--Grilled Chicken topped with a delicious sauce served with veggies and a portion of fragrant rice.The rice has been tossed in butter with fresh herbs.A spoonful of goodness in literal.terms
🍁Ham Steak--The sauce topping on the soft ham steak was absolute delish.The sunny side up sat pretty on top though i felt the mash could use a bit more cream cheese.I mean who can complain for more cheese
🍁Grilled chicken--Perfect for the meat lovers and diet conscious people who prefer their meat char grilled and served with a yoghurt dip.Simple healthy meal
🍁Roasted turkey with plum sauce--Finally the star of the evening lived up to its expectations.The plum sauce was a delight ,not too sweet neither too soury,it gives the otherwise bland meat a tasty makeover.Though it is a humble request to all to understand that turkey has a blatant otherwise.The sauce gives it a structure and signature taste that needs time to aquire.
🍁Caramel Custard--Though an ardent chocolate lover,the custard jiggled its way through my heart.The   flavour is well balanced and set perfectly.I am very particular when it comes to caramel sauce because a burnt flavour ruins a perfect dish but this one was just top notch
🍁Brownie with hot chocolate sauce--Personal recommendation for all chocolate lovers,abolutely gooey ,soft ,melt in your mouth brownie with a warm chocolate sauce poured all over.

A meal so heat warming and overwhelming that it creates an everlasting and vivid memory.Well in literal terms,I took a piece of this place in the shape of a brownie.Kudos to team Lebanese junction for their commendable service.

Lebanese Junction was first to introduce Lebanese cuisine in Kolkata. They are quite serious in maintaining the Lebanese authenticity in the hearts of all bengalis. The Location is very easy, just beside Hatibagan crossing which is the busiest shopping hub of North Kolkata. It is a take-away joint as well as casual dining. The decors in the dining area depits the different cultures around the globe. Coming to the food, we had;
🎆 Crispy fried Calamari with Wasabi dip- A heavenly dish for all sea-food lovers and the wasabi dip was breath-taking. Crispy , well seasoned and the squid inside was juicy. 
🎆 Spicy mutton meatballs- Perfect balance of spice mixed with mutton and coated with sauce. A great dish for spicy food lovers. 
🎆 Chicken Cordon Blue- Chicken wrapped with ham, well breaded and deep fried to create this masterpiece. The white gravy on top and the buttery mashed potato was the perfect match. 
🎆 Chicken Mont Blanc- well seared chicken steak was soft and melted in the mouth. 
🎆 Chicken Penne Aglio Olio- Italian pasta with Lebanese twist are to die for.
🎆 Grilled Chicken- This is the best seller and it is worth every penny. The skin is kept which provide the crispness and flavour to the chicken.
🎆 Roasted Turkey with plum sauce- The last but not the least, the show-stopper. The sauce and the turkey was a hit duo. This is the most recommended dish if anything you try at all. 
🎆 Caramel Custard- The Not too sweet pudding brought back my childhood. 
🎆 Brownie with Chocolate sauce- Hot melting brownie and chocolate was the perfect ending to this perfect food story! 

The food was delicious and served fresh. The quality as well as the quantity is at par with the price. Their service was also very good. Going back there again in some time.

Situated just beside the Star Theatre at Hatibagan is a star in Lebanese cuisine. Went there few days back with my group and what a extraordinary delicacies they have to offer us!
Although the ambience is nothing fancy but its clean and hygienic. There is a long sitting arrangement just as you enter the building, you can choose to sit there or inside. It got a capacity of around 50people inside.
Coming to the dishes.. its full on Christmas vibe with good food that will not pinch your pocket.
1)Calamari - Decent sized Squid rings fried in a tasty spicy batter served with a thick dip to go with it.
2)Bacon Wrapped Prawn - My favourite of the lot. The prawns retains their sweet natural taste while the bacon is properly cooked, juicy and spicy.. Each bite just blows in bits of awesomeness in your mouth. Portion is proper to serve 3person
3)Fish Finger - Tasty fish fingers.. properly crisp on outside and soft inside. This fish fingers are just 'fishier' or lets just say bigger than standard size.
4)Chelo Kebab Platter - Well I am completely in peace with this chelos, better than many other legendary chelo platters I have tasted in reputed restaurants. The portion is just right and fulfilling. Served with mildly fragrant rice to perfectly accompany it.
5)Chicken Cordon Bleu - This is one of the chicken dish that you will love coming back for . Perfect portion of cheese, chicken and bread to compliment each other yet not exaggerate.
6)Pot Roast Mutton - Pieces of mutton in tasty gravy along with exotic vegetables and hint of dilli in the fragrant rice makes this dish a star attraction. This dish is on the spicy side and hence perfect for winters and monsoon or if you simply love it spicy.
7)Pork Chop - A big juicy pork steak perfectly cooked to retain the mushy feel. You will fall in love with its creamy texture.
8)Chicken Ala Kiev - Well the Ala kiev here has to be bigger than the rest... Its nothing fancy, just old fashioned ala kiev but cooked perfectly to have a burst of yummy butter when cut.
9)Mojito- A tangy drink to digest all the yummy awesomeness served by this restaurant
10)Brownie & Custard - Both have perfect consistency, specially the custard couldn't have been better. Proper portion to satiate your sweet tooth.
I am surely recommending this restaurant for porktastic dishes and yummy awesomeness.

Been here many times.. The chicken shawarma wrap from here is my all time favourite.. The chicken shawarma salad is also great.. Ordered chicken Mont blanc and chicken rice balls today.. The chicken rice balls was quiet good.. And I guess the chicken Mont blanc lacked a little bit of cream and butter.. Nonetheless it was good.. So overall I really like the place.. 😃

"Lebanese junction - Steak House" - a much needed steak house in North Kolkata. This neatly done restaurant is located in Hatibagan area near Star Theatre hall and is very easy to locate. The wait for quality steaks and continental joint in North Kolkata is over now. This place might not be highly decorated but they serve lip smacking dishes. Some of the must mention names are : Calamari (crispy batter fried squid), Bacon wrapped prawn, Fish Finger in starter , from main course - chicken cordon bleu, Chicken a-la kiev, pot roast mutton (diced mutton cooked with vegetables and served with rice) , Pork chop , Chelo Kebab ( yes one should definitely try their Chelo kebab ) the kebabs are different in taste which makes the dish special. Pineapple sauce used in cooking the pork chop makes it really different and amazingly tasty. Wash the foods down with some refreshing mocktails. Coming to the dessert - a must must try is their brownie which is soft and just perfect (extra brownie points for that brownie) and also caramel custard ( my another personal favourite). There were many more mouth watering item names on menu but there's hardly any space left in stomach. One visit is not enough so visiting again soon. Kunal Chowdhury Kaustov Bhattacharya

An old place with a new look and ofcourse a new taste. Siituated in hatibagan , this place is not hard to spot . The best part is , its now also a steak house.
The place is divided in two segments , while entering you will see the NON AC section while there is an AC chamber further in.
This place is neat and clean with a proper ambience where you can dine with your friends and family.

On Dec , I went here with my friends and fellow foodies to try out some newly introduced dishes.
Each dish has its own uniqueness and is sure to leave a mark on your taste buds.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
CALAMARI : Fried squid in perfect size with a dip , a perfect start to the munching journey.

BECON WRAP PRAWN: tender juicy prawn wrapped inside  a becon covering . Served along with a       sweet mouth watering sauce.

FISH FINGER: The fish finger is something we all know and have had but with a dip and as perfectly done here with even texture and a tender inside with a crispy crunch outside , you will be craving for more.

CHELO KABAB: A platter full of kababs seasoned along with some arabian spices and a well cooked, flavoured rice .

CHICKEN CORDON BLEU: Chicken wrapped inside a baked bread covering with cheese . A dish that pleases your eyes and your tummy.

POT ROAST MUTTON: Diced mutton pieces with a blend of vegetables and a lightly flavoured rice .

PORK CHOP: A platter of finely cooked pork with a exquisite marination of spices and sauce .

MOJITO: A glass of this tangy tasting buddy to go with all your main course . Take a bite and make a sip ,Total bliss.

CHICKEN ALA KIEV : Chicken fillet thats pounded and rolled around butter and covered with eggs and bread crums and baked. Cut it open and enjoy the hot steamy delight.

BROWNIE  & CUSTARD : To end the jouney we all need to please our sweet tooth . So dig in your spoon on each of these and enjoy the sweetness.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
On an overall experience, this place gives you exactly what you want . GREAT FOOD. It may not have a great grand hall for seating , It may not have fancy lighting for your selfies . But it does have a superb menu thats complemented by equaly competent preparation. So grab some buddies and visit and enjoy your meal .

Lebanese junction is situated at hatibagan junction, just beside star theatre. This restaurant is known for it's steaks and Lebanese food.
I decided to pay this restaurant a visit yesterday. The restaurant's front end has a bar like seating arrangement. And inside is the dining area which is separated from the front part by a wooden wall.

This restaurant had a wide range of menu to choose from (One thing I would like to mention at the very beginning is that this restaurant, inspire of it's appearance, is quite expensive). I ordered a lasagna and chello kebab.

The food, on the plate looked quite tasty but unfortunately was way off in the taste department. The chello kebabs were chewy. Not what you'd expect from a star dish. The fish sticks served in the chello kebab platter was nice but then again the normal 2 kebab pieces were just average. I was a bit dissatisfied with the dish.
Lasagna, again was looking very nice on the plate but it also fell short in taste department. I did not like the crust of the lasagna at all. However the meat filling was cooked to perfection yet somehow it fell short for me.
At the very end I ordered a glass of Sprite which roughly contained about 300 ml of Sprite but cost me 40 bucks.

Overall I would not say this is a bad restaurant because it fell short on two dishes. I would like to taste few more dishes before passing that judgement. But yes I wouldn't recommend these 2 dishes to anyone. Try something else. There are a lot of options to choose from.
I would love to come back here to try different items.

This place recently changed to Lebanese Steak House, located just beside Star at Hatibagan.

This restaurant has two parts in it, an AC cabin inside & the outer cabin where you can see hanging chicken on the grill machine when enjoying the same. There isn’t too much eye catching decorations inside but everything is neat & clean and managed too. Light colour of wall & posters and frames with quotes on it is the only point of interest inside.

Chicken hanging on the grill machine is what catches the eye over here from outside. Following their new menu we selected the following…

Non-Veg Items :
--------------------
Crispy Fried Calamari (4/5) :
--------------------------------
Crispy coated shrimps served with wasabi dipping sauce. The main twist was the taste & richness of mustard sauce in this dip making those crispy fries enjoyable.

Spicy Chilli Pork (4/5) :
--------------------------
This pork dish was completely different than what I'm habituated with from other places. Sliced pork pieces were well cooked & coated with honey, therefore it tasted sweet at first & thereafter it was extremely extremely hot.

Meat Lasagne (3.5/5) :
---------------------------
A full fledged dish made out of minced Mutton with layer of Lasagna sheets on top, baked with cottage cheese and herbs. This dish looked very delicious while top layer tasted cheesy and inside mutton was hot & spicy.

Chicken Mont Blanc (3.5/5) :
-------------------------------
Another premium chicken dish, this time served with steamed rice and boiled vegetables. Spicy 

Pork Chops (3.5/5) :
-----------------------
 A dish full of pork fat & meat ribs, served with boiled vegetables, mashed potato and ring onions. This dish is loveable for meat fat lovers. Meat was very spicy and juicy but could’ve been little more cooked.

Chicken Tetrazzini (4/5) :
---------------------------
A white sauce spaghetti pasta based dish with shredded chicken, lots of cheese and sliced veggies that just melted in mouth with flavours of herbs felt really good.

Veg Items :
---------------
Cheese Garlic Bread (3/5) :
-----------------------------
Crunchy grilled bread with a layer of cheese and seasonings on it.

Macaroni in Mixed Sauce (4.25/5) :
-------------------------------------
Well this pasta tasted much better then any non veg pasta over here. Macaroni was well mixed with spices & it was so cheesy to taste.

Veg Steak (3/5) :
-------------------
A Veg patty served in Steak style, well there’s nothing better someone can do for vegetarians.

Desserts :
----------------
Brownie with Chocolate Sauce (4/5) :
---------------------------------------
Expected it to taste different as its their in-house preparation & it really was different. A delight for Chocolate lovers, basically hot chocolate melts everyone’s heart.

Caramel Custard (3.5/5) :
---------------------------
This dish looked damm delicious. Custard was an island with a cherry on it surrounded by sweet honey flavoured liquid.

Pricing :
-----------
This figure has been kept from average to little bit expensive.

Conclusion :
---------------
If you are bored with same Chinese & North Indian restaurant foods & want to try something different, then just to give your taste buds a pleasant surprise you can visit Lebanese Junction for their different style of Steak dishes. Recent changes to this place came up with so much improvements that is a must try in my recommendation.

Time to rejoice, all the North Calcuttans!
Your meat cravings will not go unheard of, as the Lebanese junction has packed a power punch of what a meat lover would call paradise. Located just around the Hatibagan Crossing, right next to the famous Star Theatre, this steak house is the ultimate destination for the meat lovers. Keeping in mind the old Calcutta feel, they've stuck to the roots and brought a homely feel to the place, where one can gorge on some of the best Italian dishes and yet feel at ease with the tranquility. They offer good vegetarian options, provide quality food and the portion sizes will fill you up in no time. On my recent visit here, I was truly satisfied to my heart's content as I indulged into a meaty affair of the highest kind! Me and my fellow foodies tried few items from the New Menu introduced recently :

IN STARTERS ---
• Crispy Fried Calamari >> Being a seafood lover myself, I'm quite often heartbroken to find a lack of places that serve calamari. I was so happy to find this on their menu! It was fried just right, and served along with a mustard-mayo dip. (3.5/5)

• Spicy Pork >> A fiery stir fried pork starter, with loads of veggies and herbs, the pork was well cooked and the herbs accompanied the overall taste nicely. This will appeal to the taste buds of those who can tolerate real spicy food, it's not for the faint hearted! (4/5)

FOR THE MAINS ---
• Meat Lasagna >> Best pick of the meal, this is a dish you'll cherish for the longest time! This has a filling of spicy minced meat layered between lasagna sheets and topped with lots of cheese, which is then baked and served as it is. The serving size is more than enough for even 2 people. (5/5)

• Veg Macaroni >> This particular item was so well made that the meat lovers ordered this on repeat too! A mild and spicy Macaroni prepared in a white sauce base, this was really enjoyable. (4/5)

• Chicken Tetrazzini >> A mix of white sauce and loads of butter & cheese, shredded chicken and ample amounts of herbs, this literally melted in my mouth. After an array of spicy foods, this was a relief to our taste buds. (5/5)

• Pork Chop >> Although not an authentic version of a pork chop, this contained two humble portions of pork with a layer of BBQ sauce on the top, alongside mashed potato, stir fried vegetables and caramelized onions. (3.5/5)

• Chicken Mont Blanc >> I was simply blown away by the taste of this one! Basically it is Chicken steak fried and then sautéed in pepper sauce. The steak was quite juicy while the outer crust being crisp and crunchy. Served with herbed rice and boiled vegetables, this one worked like a palate pleaser. (5/5)

• Veg Steak >> While I didn't taste this, I can only comment on the portion size, which is enough for two to share. This came with a side of mashed potatoes, stir fried veggies and had a topping of BBQ sauce.

Apart from such sumptuous two course spreads, they provide few evergreen desserts to satisfy the sweet tooth :
• Brownie in hot chocolate sauce >> Soft and warm Brownie, freshly baked, served with generous amount of chocolate sauce. This was heavenly. (4.5/5)

• Caramel Custard >> With the nutty flavour of caramel, this was supple and quite good to taste. (3.5/5)

Overall, my experience was pretty satisfactory with not just the food, but the warm hospitality and prompt service. So, head to this Steak House at the earliest, you'll be delighted, for sure!

A pretty bold step to open a restaurant in a place which is the oldest part of city and most reluctant to embrace changes. A Continental food joint also serving good quality steaks. Recently furnished with simple minimalist seating arrangements. We have heard a lot about this place and finally decided to go for a visit. Situated just at Hatibagan crossing, missing this out I tough job.
Our broad platter included...

1.Crispy Fried Calamari,served with wasabi Dip. 
The wasabi dip being cooked in mustard oil gives a tangy twist to taste buds and maybe inconvenience for few so I would suggest to skip that. The fries were so crispy and soft inside.
2.Spicy Chilly pork.
Sliced Pork Meat Sauted in Spicy Chilly Sauce. It can't get more spicier than this. Tender cooked pork pieces that just melt away when you take a bite.
3.Chicken Mont Blanc
Served with Herb Rice & Boiled English Veggies and mashed potatoes. Definitely a must try for all. Visually appealing and marvellously tasty.
4.Pork Chops.Served with Mashed Seasoned Potato And sauteed Onions,the Pork Chops Grilled with red sauce.
5.Meat Lasagna.An Italian Delight.Oven Baked with Minced Mutton Layered With Lasagna Sheets and lots of Herbed Cottage Cheese.
6.Veg Macaroni,Served with Red Creamy Sauce & Cheese.
7.Chicken Tetrazzini.Italian Delight.Shredded Chicken Baked with sauted Pasta,Cottage Cheese and Herbs.
8.Brownie With Hot Chocolate Sauce.A delightful Dessert,its their In-House production.
9.Caramel Custard.Cherry On The Cake.
Their service is applaudable.

Well, in a country obsessed with numbers, the average vegetarian guy will not be convinced to visit a place offering only a handful of veg dishes. But, what we generally tend to forget is that it is QUALITY that matters the most and not QUANTITY!

The place is easily accessible, just a couple of buildings away from the Hatibagan Star Theatre. From outside, the place appears seemingly unimpressive, but your perception does change once you enter and occupy a seat at their coveted dining area!

The walls are decor with a few sports and other celebrities and the furniture seems ceramic, seating strength comes to 20-odd guests! Ambience is fine, though not great!

The below items were gorged upon :-

(i)	Cheese Garlic bread – A nice kick start to an even better impending meal, loads of cheese atop 4 slices of garlic bread!

(ii)	Macaroni in mixed sauce – It simply appears as if the chef is a PhD in macaroni baking, each and every macaroni piece was perfectly covered in an unbelievably tasty mixed sauce combination and topped with lots of herbs.

(iii)	Veg steak – A complete meal in itself, a huge veg patty topped with sauces and served with sautéed vegetables and lachcha onions, mind it that this one cannot be eaten all alone by a single foodie! Hence, share and collaborate!

(iv)	Caramel custard – The syrup deserves a special mention, and the custard a better, notwithstanding the cherry topping!

(v)	Brownie with chocolate sauce – Breaking away from the conventional, they served the warm brownie topped with lots of chocolate sauce, but devoid of any vanilla scoop accompaniments. Needless to say, it still tasted awesome.

(vi)	Sprite

Overall, an excellent experience in a city where Lebanese cuisine is pretty much a rare species! Prices are pretty reasonable considering an experience of this calibre and service pretty friendly, do walk-in to experience something different!

Lebanese Delights at Lebanese Junction-Steak House:
Lebanese cuisine is Leventine cuisine. It includes an whole grains, fruits, vegetables, starches, fresh fish and seafood; animal fats are consumed sparingly. Poultry is eaten more often than red meat. When red meat is eaten it is usually lamb on the coast, and goat meat in the mountain regions. It also includes copious amounts of garlic and olive oil, often seasoned by lemon juice. Also, there is a large amount of chickpeas in their diet.Olive oil, herbs, garlic and lemon are typical flavors found in the Lebanese diet.
I have an invitation with my fellow foodies at Lebanese Junction-Steak House for a food testing session which is located at various places at Kolkata like- 110, Aurobindo Sarani Rd, Yogi Para, Darjipara, Machuabazar, Kolkata, West Bengal 700006.We invited at 110,Aurobindo Sarani Rd beside Star Theater,Hatibagan.We all welcomed here with great hospitality.The ambiance is perfect for hangout with friends and family.They have a quite well sitting arrangements.
I never tasted Lebanese foods before this event.It was a great experience to taste such a good cuisine.The dishes we tried there-

Appetizer-An appetizer or starter is a small dish served before a meal. Some are served cold, others hot.Appetizers may be served at the dinner table as a part of the meal, or they may be served before sitting.We started with very old and famous starter-

Fish Finger-Fish fingers or fish sticks, are a processed food made using a whitefish, such as cod, haddock or Pollock, which has been battered or breaded. They are commonly available in the frozen food section of supermarkets.It is a crunchy batter fried fish fillet made creation an absolutely soft portion of fish fillets are coated and deep fried in oil,brownish in color.It was served with a bowl of mayoneise.This is a definitely must try item.
After the appetizer we tried the new dishes of this food joint.They are-

Calamari-A thin and soft layer of batter which is fried and good in taste.Calamaries are served with a bowl of creamy wasabi dip which is a taste like masterd.

Spicy Meat Balls-The minced chicken was marinated with spices.The dough was shallow fried in the oil.It was a soft,spicy,creamy layer all over it.This is one of the must dish to try.
Cheese Balls-Cheese itself a taste enhancer of any kind of dish.So,it's obvious that this is a tasty dish to try.

After tried these starters we focused on main course:We had various types of dishes made of chicken,pork and fish.We had smocking sizzlers too.

Pork Ribs-Pork ribs are a cut of pork popular in North American and Asian cuisines. The rib cage of a domestic pig, meat and bones together, is cut into usable pieces, prepared by smoking, grilling, or baking.Pork ribs are prepared with chefs special sauce which was incredible in taste.It served with french fries,sauteed onions along with sauteed fresh vegetables.
Pork Chops-A pork chop, like other meat chops, is a loin cut taken perpendicularly to the spine of the pig and usually containing a rib or part of a vertebra. This loin meat is then cut down into pork chops and their variations.The honey and barbicue sauce glazed pieces of juicy ribs are cooked perfectly.One can easyly separate the meat portion from the bones.It served with sauteed vegetables and french fries.The layer of barbecue sauce is perfect combination of it.
Chicken Mont Blanc-The skinless and boneless pieces of chicken sauteed perfectly in white wine along with  utter, onion, green pepper, bay leaf, flour, salt, pepper, white wine, and quartered tomatoes and mushrooms.This semi dry preparation is tender and juicy.Served with rice and sauteed vegetables.
Prawn New Burg-The classic dish Prawn Newburg (or lobster a la Newburg) was made famous in 1876 by Delmonico's New York City restaurant. Chef Charles Ranhofer got the recipe from Ben Wenberg, a West Indies sea captain, so it was first named lobster a la Wenberg.This is a classic recipe where the prawns are put over the flavorful rice.
Sizzlers-The origin of the sizzler probably goes back the teppanyaki-sizzled dishes of Japan. From there it moved to the US after World War II, and became popular in the 1950s. Sizzler steaks are generally prepared using high-heat to sear the outside and leaving the inside moist. Once plated, the steak lets off a dramatic hiss of steam, which is its great appeal.It served on a metal plate kept on a wooden base.

We tried two signature sizzlers of the restaurants.One is the chicken and the other one is with fish.

Chicken Sizzler-Chicken sizzler is a hot dinner party recipe, here the boneless chicken is marinated in spices and soy sauce, cooked on a proper flame and served on a hot sizzling plate.The smocked hot chicken pieces are put over the bed of cabbage leaves with rice,sauteed vegetables along with a portion of omelet covered the pieces of chickens.Tastes delicious.
Grilled fish sizzler-The fillets of vetki fish cooked perfectly.It has layer of creamy cheese.Served with french fries and sauteed vegetables.
My first experience to taste Lebanese cuisine was great.One must try this cuisine.Every dish was so good in taste.A perfect mouth watering and tummy satisfying experience.I would like to thank Prasun Da for inviting us and giving such an opportunity.Thank you Rajdeep Bhattacharjee and Panchphoron for this amazing evening.

Whenever I hear the word Lebanese food, there’s one image that has been stuck to my mind always, and that’s of a huge rotisserie stacked with chicken pieces that are being horizontally stacked and slow cooked inside a heat chamber. There’s roast and then there’s Lebanese roast. Both are quite different from each other, in spite of the name being same. The latter one uses dried spices and is slowly cooked and char-grilled to perfection. So when I heard that Panch Phoron has been invited to a Lebanese food tasting event, I was over the moon. North Calcutta has always been famous for the hidden gems where food is concerned, but of late it is starting to mirror the revolution of its southern counterpart. This sudden boom can be attributed to people’s desire to eat out and post pictures on the internet. Eating out has definitely become the new “let’s go out”.

Not satisfied by rating this place 5/5 because if I could, I would have rated this place 10/5. I wonder how could such a lovely restaurant had remained unnoticed by many! 

When I had first stepped in, even I wondered whether I wanted to have my lunch here, as I could see only a snack corner but then the waiter led us inside.

1) Ambience:  We don't go to restaurants as an art critic. So I don't find the reason for extravagant decorations and all. The place should be clean with air conditioning. That's all we need! So I found the room to be pretty cosy and comfortable. Absolutely perfect.

2) Service:  Not only the waiter, even the manager checked from time to time whether we were satisfied with the quality and quantity. They were extremely cordial from the beginning to the end.

3) Coming to the food we had:
a) Chicken shawarma wrap: Shredded chicken with generous fillings and a whole lot of mayonnaise- all wrapped up in a warm, succulent pita bread. 
b) Chicken steak: The best one I ever had, with all the onion dressings and mashed potato cooked in butter! Normally the potatoes in steaks taste pretty blanch, but I fell in love with the mashed potatoes. Handsome piece of chicken coated with a spicy sauce, served with poached egg, veggies, potatoes and onions. Must try for all.
c) Hot chocolate walnut brownie:  The chef spared no expenses to load the brownie with whole walnuts, and served with chocolate sauce. The moist and warm brownie is sure to amuse even the biggest dessert-hater.
d) Caramel custard: Had heard about this dish from a friend of mine who said this was bliss.... And he didn't lie! Oh even as I write this, I can see the caramel layer slowly melting, revealing the cherry inside.

Hoping to visit this place really soon, for they have added sizzlers, pork chops and many other items as well.  This place has made me a huge fan of Lebanese Junction. Why didn't I visit this place even earlier?

On nabami during Puja after pandel hopping we tried this restaurant. We were really hungry then but all the tables were already booked obvious situation during Puja. Though they tried as early as possible to confirm our tables. Swarms rolls can be ordered outside bt we need to sit to have our late lunch at 4 PM. After getting tables we ordered chicken biriani, Irani fish tikka and California fish steak. Biriani was good and fish tikka was mouth melting and awesome in taste. California fish steak was a continental items with boiled vegies, grilled bhetki with gravy and zeera rice. It's a full meal for single person. Due to crowd during Puja might be the staffs were not so attentive. The ambiance was not so decorative and number of table was less. Overall quality and quantity were perfect.

Lebanese & Continental both of them my favorite food joint. what do we know about Lebanese food well, it includes an abundance of whole grain, fruit, vegetables, starches, fresh fish, and seafood. animal fats are consumed sparingly along with the tender meaty portion. it also includes copious amounts of garlic and olive oil. Lebanese cuisine is all about ancient one and part of the Levantine cuisine. most of the foods are grilled, baked or sauteed in olive oil, butter and sometimes in cream. herbs and spices are used frequently and in large quantities.

Tried this hub in puja fest.with friends.Situated at hatibagan more, a small junction.having two parts one is snacks bar and another sit and dine area.The ambience would be minimal.so a 2 out of 5.coming to the service.its a self-service in the snacks area, also they accept only cash which is a bit problem some time.so another 2 out of 5.coming to the foods, so as we were focussing on snacks so we went for their Mutton kabab wraps.it was good, nothing special to mention.it was like all the other swarma we eat.so a 3 out of 5.so over all a nice place would like to try their other seat & dine menu.hoping to visit soon.

Service is okay !
We ordered calcutta chicken biriyani and chicken sawarma wrap...If you are a Biriyani lover, then sorry to say that this place is not for you. But quantity was good, though rice of biriyani was not even properly done.
But the chicken sawarma wrap was literally good . My all time favourite! One can try this . As per my opinion It's the best of all here. 😊

Well, after going through the reviews I thought to try this steak house out on navami. I won't talk about the decor and beautification of this joint since there's not much to talk about. Also I dropped in to take my parcel away. Since they've extended their menu, there's quite much offering to lay your hands on now. I ordered prawn fritters and macaroni in mixed sauce, only in vain as both of those items were unavailable due to the festive rush. Hence I chose chicken rice balls and chicken steak.
Back at home I got started, took the first bite of a chicken rice ball, and to my disgust, a thin hair popped out. That would've closed the deal right there but the taste made it up for the detestable start off, though not much succulent but when gone along with veggies and creamy cheese sauce, it felt pretty palatable. Then comes the chicken steak topped with a poach, again to my disappointment, it had a little piece of bone. The taste was upto the mark but not remarkable.
Conclusion: I'm yet to try other continental dishes, but I'd request the management to take care of the hygiene first.

We had worst experience ever, horrible management. Very bad behaviour by the owner. Too small space, and the owner would force several families (more than 2) to sit in a table of four, inspite of available tables. Probably she forces the customers according to her will. We couldn't also leave since that we had to pay for the food even before entering the dining space. Overall it was a humiliating and uncomfortable experience.

Went to eat biriyani today at this junction,turned out to be a pathetic experience.this place once cooked  the olive oil biriyani which was quite unique and good.
This time both the chicken and biriyani rice smelt bad and hard. It was the usual road side taste and for 160 bucks its a total disappointment.

On complaining the owner of the quality degradation ,he went furious.told that they have stopped the olive oil recipe 7months back.

Such rude and adamant behaviour plus the food quality and hygiene if not improved will surely doom this place.

I am here right now with my sister. It is pujo time okay so when I was told waiting is 10-15 minutes I agreed and accepted that it would be 20. After 15 minutes Iam asked whether I would share. I say no.

After 40 minures of waiting (instead of the supposed 15) I am given an table...ona sharing basis. When I tell the manager that I had wanted private he starts arguing that he has already mentioned it wasn't possible in rush time! And when I say his employee knows I wanted private he denies it!!!
APPALLING BEHAVIOUR.
I haven't even tasted the food but I take objection to being spoken like that.

I was certainly not pleased with this Steak House!
We dropped in for lunch one fine afternoon, during the Durga Pujas. The menu was revised, shortened and Biryani was added to cope with the demands of customers during this festival..!
Yet I kept my hopes high and was eager for some tasty food.
Unfortunately most of the dishes that we ordered were quite below my expectation. The chicken kebabs in Chelow kebab were stiff and hardened. The mutton sheek kebabs were burnt black. Meat balls and fish steak were appalling. Only the grilled chicken was up to the mark.
Even though I was carrying water bottles, they forbade me to use them, and coerced me into buying mineral water from their stock! Ridiculous...!

We went today (Maha Sashti) and it was a bad experience. The menu was limited due to Durga Puja festival. We ordered Calcutta Mutton Biriyani, California Fish Steak and Chello Kabab. The chicken was hard, rice was smelling and undercooked. The fish steak sauce didn’t seem to have any flavor. The Biriyani was the only face saver with standard taste nothing extraordinary.

Went to this very weird place that we accidentally landed ..it's says "self service" which I understand that the management want to save money and not  hire any service staff... but if so then u really need to make sure the food has to be good! But was highly disappointed.... we ordered a biryani and sewarma salad .. salad was ok but the biryani was pathetic ... biryani was the worst I have ever had.. chicken was really really bad..now comes the worst part of our experience.. we found a hair in the biryani .. it was really disgusting and what's not the end ... I showed the staff that foreign object in my biryani and he was like " it's ok.. it can happen ... everybody is wearing a hair net.."ironically he was not wearing one!! He got me a fresh portion but by then our appetite was already dead ! And yes one more thing they don't have glasses for drinking water as well ... the have those really unhygienic  use and throw plastic glasses ! I still wonder what was the planning they had in mind before they started of with this concept !

Though the day started off with a gloomy weather and copious rains, the visit to Lebanese Junction Steak House uplifted our sulky tenor when we were presented with a multifariousness of dishes.  The cosy ambience made us feel warm and the satisfaction to our hunger commenced soon with the new range of dishes introduced by the restuarant. Now, coming to the central point of naming the dishes we tasted.

Tried the chicken steak and Shwarma. The Lebanese items are delicious. But the continental food is average. Also the decor is not up to the mark. The behaviour of staff is very friendly .

Lebanese considered to be one of the healthiest cuisine in the world. Lebanese food is distinguished by It's Simple appearance and get Complex process, freshness of ingredients. This is what Lebanese Junction is all about but this Lebanese junction Hatiagan has merged up with new section Steakhouse. Lebanese Junction has started its journey 3 years before of a while now. This place is adjacent to the Star Theatre Hatibagan. This place was famous for its Shawarma and now it has launched its new menu which is containing Continental cuisine.

As you entered the place you will see the outer section of this junction with tall sitting tools for 5 to 6 people behind which is a sliding door leading you to the inner section of the restaurant once you go beyond the door you will find yourself seated in a pretty well air conditioner. This section has capacity of 20 to 25 people. Its wall has frame with the picture of Band, sports Mens and few quotes. The interior of this section is pretty simple and sober to keep the focus of the venture for a gastronomical experience.

Menu which we ate :-

✓French Fries :- this is just traditional french fries served with Chilli flakes and oregano on top and ketchup. Just like normal price nothing extraordinary but the portion of quantity is really good.

✓Cheese Garlic Bread :- 4 pieces of bread baked with lots of cheese and Herbs seasoning on the top which makes it soft from the inside and crispy from the outside, overall taste was average.

✓Onion Fitters* :- It is one of the best Onion fitters I ever had. Crispy fried onion rings were served with a Mayo dip. It was so crispy and tasty that wasn't make you feel like you are eating an onion and tip was also tasty which was mix with some Herbs and spices.

✓Fish & Chips*** :- 2 well sized pieces of fried fish was served with french fries and tips which was crispy from outside and juicy from inside. It was so tasty that I can't explain it in words so just go and grab it.

✓Macaroni in Mixed Sauce :- macroni which was mixed in white and red sauce which was served with cheese and Herbs on the tops.

✓Chelow Kebab*** :- This place serves one of the best Chole Kabab in Kolkata ( Calcutta ). It's served in the traditional way, rice was putted in the middle of the plate and half cooked egg was placed over the rice and the sides of the plate was filled with chicken and mutton kebabs.

✓Prawn New Burg*** :- This is one of my favorite. The prawn was very nicely cooked and caramelized, I could taste the creaminess of the upper part of the prawn. This was served with aromatic rice which was mixed cooked with some Herbs and lemon zest and in between which prawn was place and filled with tasty caramelized.

✓Chicken Stroganoff* :- Rarely have pain so impressed with a dish, that I wanted to it up again. The aromatic rice, herbs on the top served with well cooked chicken and Capsicum. Love the presentation and quantity presented.

✓Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce** :- This is something special all in the menu of Steak House. Those juicy fried fish and Sauce on the top served with smashed potato and assorted veggies was so yummy and the Aroma of sauce is perfect to satisfy your hunger.

✓Caramel Custard** :- I don't prefer custard items very much but this this makes me to fall in love for it. Soft touch just like Jelly of custard with sweet Saraf and Cherry on the top is something that really makes your day. Orange colour rating at the top part with red coloured Cherry in its center and slowly the white texture will surely Catch your eyes. It is one of the lovely presentation in the menu.

✓Brownie with Chocolate Sauce** :- one of my favourite dessert. The brownie had a hard outer crust which is film with his illness and the hot Chocolate Sauce over it was just lips smashing.

So this puja makes you healthy wealthy and wise by visiting this place and makes it more memorable as the North Kolkata has its first Steak House. So go grab your seats before it gets filled. Because this place make "Our Finger's Licking Good".

Thank you

North Kolkata maanei Chop-muri r adda, North Kolkata maanei Old Tradition and bucketful of Unparalleled Heritage. Well I think this thinking is too much old stream, especially when North Kolkata is getting his first Steak House with Lebanese Junction. Few years ago, the journey was of Lebanese Cuisine was started by help of Lebanese Junction but now the time has come when you don’t have to go to south Kolkata for authentic Continental cuisine. Welcome to Lebanese Junction – Steak House!

Located just next to Star Theatre @ Hatibagan Crossing. Very prime location, so not a hard thing to find it out. The Non AC part belongs to the old Lebanese Junction and the new AC decorative part belongs to the much waited Steak House. Both the Restaurant shares the same landmark.

The restaurant was well maintained, few inspirational poster were hanging from wall. With sitting capacity of max 24 persons at a time, the restaurant give you extra legroom for your relaxation.

Now come to the food. I visited this restaurant for the several times and these are some of their dishes I tried here –

- Cheese garlic bread – Four pieces of bread baked with lots of cheese in both side and herbs seasoning on top. Crispy nature from outside but soft from Inside. Good as a starter.

- French Fries - Traditional french fries served with chilli flakes and oregano seasoning on top. Nothing extraordinary but love the portion of quantity.

- Onion Fritters – Crispy fried onion rings were served with a finger licking mayo dip. One of the best fried onion rings I’ve ever tried.

- Fish n Chips – Two pieces of well fried fish fillet was served with French fries and dip. Awesome in one word. The outer crust was little bit crunchy in taste but the fish was really heavenly. It melts down in your mouth automatically. That is the real beauty about this dish. Super recommended from me.

- Chelow Kebab – One of the best Chelow I’ve ever had. Presented in the traditional way but tastes really good. Perfect item as your main course.

- Macaroni in Mixed Sauce – Cheesy macaroni was cooked with lots of butter, mixed sauce. Buttery touch from top and herb seasoning adds some real flavor which really finger licking.

- Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce – This is something Steak House special. Portion of fish well grilled and sauce on top served with Mashed potato and assorted veggies. Love the presentation and the taste.

- Prawn New Burg – Prawn in always every Bongs’ crush unless you have allergy. :P The texture of the dish is really eye catching. Bowl shaped rice with cooked prawn were served with with lots of cream and butter. Must try item here.

- Chicken Stroganoff – Another surprise to us. Portion of well steamed rice were served with Chicken preparation. The rice had a special aroma which will attract you easily and the chicken preparation was too much perfect. Cooked with lots of capsicums but tastes awesome. Another main course item to die for.

- Calamari - A mediterranean cuisine, where batter coated squids are deep fried. Served with mayonnaise dip. Love the flavor and the shape.

- Bacon Wrapped Prawn - Meaty flavor of bacon combined with the succulent taste of cooked shrimp. The prawn was too soft and juicy from inside. Overall a must try item here.

- Fish Finger - Traditional fish finger made of Basa fish. Crunchy from outside but smooth and tender from inside. Served with mayonnaise dip.

- Chicken Cordon Blu - Chicken wrapped with thick crust of bread crumble and egg. The chicken inside was full of cheese. The item was served with french fries and assorted veggies.

- Pot Roast Mutton - Super fine rice served with Spicy gravy made of mutton and other veggies and herbs. One of the heavenly item for all mutton cuisine lover who want to try some different mutton delicacies.

- Lemon Mojito - Traditional all time favorite mojito with lemon punch.

- Chicken Ala Kiev - Old favorite Russian cuisine, where chicken fillet pounded and rolled around cold butter, then coated with eggs and bread crumbs and finally fried. Served with mashed potato and assorted veggies.

- Pork Chop - Rib of pork with meat attached with it served with mashed potato, fried onion and assorted veggies. One of the must try item here for all pork rib lovers.

- Brownie with Chocolate Sauce – This is what an ending should be! The brownie had a hard outer crust but the surprise it, when you have it in your mouth. You get the warmth touch from inside, which make this dish so special. Just fall in love with it.

- Caramel Custard – I’m a die-hard fan of any Custard item, but this dish makes me again fall in love. Soft touch of custard with sweet syrup and cherry in top is something that really makes your day. Orange coloration at the top part but slowly the white texture will surely catch your eyes. Super recommendation from my side.

Every time it became an awesome dining experiences from my side and will definitely visit this restaurant again and again.

Lebanese Junction has come up with its very own steak house this time with a brand new menu offering a wide variety of lip smacking options.
To begin with, the decor was simple but attractive with all the different pictures which gave definition to the place..
Coming to the food, we were more than happy with what we had.. For starters, we had Cheese Garlic Bread, French Fries, Onion Fritters and Fish n Chips. Main Course consisted of Macaroni in Mixed Sauce, Chicken Stroganoff, Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce, Chelow Kebab and Prawn New Burg.. I have to say that the seafood here is amazing, very fresh and beautifully prepared. For desserts, we had Broenie with Chocolate Sauce and Caramel Custard.. Everything was excellent!
This was just a glimpse of what they have to offer.. There is a lot more on their menu and I will surely head back there to try those out..

North Kolkata has always been the flag bearer of heritage and traditions. People from North Kolkata held on to it's tradition and culture when everything else got blown away by the wave of modernization. Maybe that's why, it took so long for them to have their own Steakhouse and their own continental place. But you know the saying. Better late than never. Luckily Lebanese Junction-Steakhouse decided to gift them that. All those North people who had to head to south for something continental, those days over for you. You can have your Steaks and Stroganoffs right at your doorstep. You have some wonderful dishes waiting for you.
Here are some of the things we tasted..

*Cheese Garlic Bread- The thick layer of cheese of the bread along with the slight crunchiness of the bread itself was a delight to our taste buds.

*Onion fritters- The outside layer was crunchy but the filling was really moist. A fine starter for the vegetarians.

*Fish and Chips- This was the best fish and chips I have tasted in a while. The stuffing was so soft and so delicious. It's taste worked really well with that of the mayo.

*Macaroni in Mixed sauce- This creamy pasta tasted surprising wonderful to me and that's saying something because I am not really a fan of pasta. But this dish did impress me.

*Chelow Kabab- Since it was my first Chelow, I won't be able to comment on it's originality but what I tasted though left me speechless. The seekh really captured the aroma and essence of the spices. The kabab was soft and moist. It had a hint of a saag flavour which really tripped me for a second since that was very unusual and unique. Highly recommended from my end.

*Prawn New Burg- This was one of my favourites. The prawn was very nicely caramelized. I could taste the creaminess of the upper part of the prawn. And the rice was the sauce tasted simply amazing.

*Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce- This was accompanied by French fries, mashed potatoes and sautéed veggies. I felt the fish was slightly salty. But the sauce did well to cover it up. But it was cooked nicely. Soft and moist. Even the mashed potatoes tasted heavenly. It's a must-order dish anyday.

*Chicken Stroganoff- Another highly recommended dish. Rarely have I been so impressed with a dish, that I wanted to eat up even the last smudge of the plate. The chicken was just wonderful. It was so beautifully cooked. Even the rice tasted delicious too.

*Caramel Custard- This sinful dessert had all of us just blown away. We were literally fighting to get a taste of it. The custard was so soft and smooth.

*Brownie in Chocolate sauce- This dessert really had all of us salivating over it. The brownie was a bit hard to cut, but the taste of it more than made up for it. The nuts added the right amount of crunch to it. It's a must-order dish. You have to order it to know how great it was.

A big thank you to

I ordered food from here last night. I have been a regular and their shawarma is quite good. However, out of the recent menu, I was disappointed on two things. The Chicken Ala Kiev was fabulous but their Chicken steak was nothing but pieces of chicken loosely bundled together. The texture was consistent and the taste was good. Coming to their Cheese Garlic Bread which costs a whopping 120 bucks, It was nothing but sheer disappointment.

Delectable and delicious, Lebanese junction and it's food has all the qualities a gastronomic seeks for!

From the delicious and juicy shawarma wraps to the delicate cheese garlic breads,this restaurant is a hit among people of all age groups.

I'll rate the Shawarma Roll 4.6/5

The unpredictability of flavours of the spicy mutton meat ball adds to the thrill of the gastronomical ven.

I'll rate the Spicy mutton meat balls 5/5

The chicken steak though was the show stopper as the irresistibly moist and flavorful meat,absorbing the juices,giving it that delectable taste which every steak lover craves for.
Stupendous flavours and the smell which still linger in my dreams.

I'll rate the Chicken Steak 4.8/5

The spaghetti with meat balls added that twist of taste to the food journey.
What was the "twist"?
The ceremony of flavours which the red sauce created with the meat balls and the spaghetti itself.

I'll rate the Spaghetti 4/5

Finally,it was time for the melt in mouth caramel custard and the chocolate brownie.

Dessert scenario of lebanese junction is joyous and is the celebration of our sweet tooth cravings.

The chocolate,considered to be the most sinful and delicate flavour which is known for the everlasting imprints in every tongue, leaves every taste bud craving for more. 

I'll rate the caramel custard 4.8/5 and the Choco Brownie 4.2/5

Great menu,even tastier food and amiable hospitality is what makes lebanese junction so special.

Special thanks to Tanmoy Basak for inviting us and my heart and "stomach" goes to Prasun Saha for the amazing hospitality.

We started the day with Lebanese Junction's old menu that is #Shawarma and then followed by the new dishes added to the menu which actually defines the place 'Lebanese Junction' A junction where you stop by to give a treat to your tastebuds which included :
******New Menu*****
● Cheese Garlic Bread(3.5/5) - The garlic bread is served with melted cheese toppings.
● Spicy Mutton Meat Balls(5/5) - The name of the dish says it all.. Ahh !! The crunchiness of the outer covering, The softness of the mutton inside and The Hot spicy flavour is LAJAWAB.
● Chicken Rice Balls(3.5/5) - Fried crispy layer covering the blended rice with a mixture of small pieces of chicken.
● Chicken Steak(5/5) - A must try for everyone. The steak was beautifully prepared with care. Other resturants serves steak with choped bolied potatoes but here they serve it with smashed potato with baby corn and other vegies.. I cant get over this. ❤
● Spaghetti With Meat Balls (3.5/5) - Though i am not big fan of Spaghetti but I seriously liked the dish.. The small meat balls with cheesy spaghetti is a perfect combination.
● Pot Roasted Mutton (4.5/5) - The mutton was too soft to handle with care.. The rice along with roasted mutton was delicious.
● Brownie (5/5) - Brownie 😍 is pure love.The showstopper of the day.. Highly recommended for everyone. My favourite.
● Caramel Custard (5/5) - Highly recommended. A perfect dessert to end the day..

*****Old Menu*****
● Shawarma (4/5) - Well prepared. It was soft and yummy.. Inside the Pita bread, the chopped chicken and the hot mayo was beautifully mixed.
Atlast North Kolkata now have a resturant where Shawarma is served :).

A big thankyou to

It was basically a food tasting session for the launch of the new menu of the outlet. I could not have been more thrilled than this. It was like a plethora of dishes. The Chicken Shawarma, Chicken Steak, Spicy Mutton meat balls, Pot Roasted Mutton and the brownie were my favourites. Among others were Cheese Garlic Bread, Chicken Rice Balls, Spaghetti with meat balls and Caramel Custard which were no less in competition than the others. It was a wonderful experience and I was delighted to have such a varied taste of continental dishes. This restaurant is amazing and I would suggest all the foodies out there to visit this place once. I am sure there would be no disappointment and you will be left wanting for more.

Located just near to the famous Star Theatre at Hatibagan Crossing. First I come to the qualityof the food which is really commendable. Quality of the meat is upto the mark. When it comes to taste matter I found it worthy enough.
Thumbs up to Chicken Shawarma wrap which is juicy enough with extra loaded mayonnaise in it. Chicken Steak and Pot Roasted Mutton with rice are the items which is the new on the list and trust me its really worthy. The items are buttery enough as you take a bite it melts like anything. Mutton Meatballs and Chicken Rice balls are good but needs extra touch in it. 
Chocolate Brownie is a must try at this outlet, the best in the menu. Caramel Custard is good too.

Well, the first thing i would like to tell the readers is, lebanese junction-steak house, have rejigged their whole menu, and have introduced continental dishes along side the prevailing lebanese menu. And which is something to cheer about for the people of north kolkata :)

The sitting area has been increased, which was a complaint made by a lot of reviewers earlier, and the management has listened to the voice of the reviewers :D And there is a 30 people sitting arrangement now, with a simply decorated squeaky clean place.

Now coming to the food. I was invited on a foodbloggers meet by Mr. Tanmoy Basak

It's a small place, just beside star theatre, Hatibagan. The ambiance can be described as average. The food was also pretty ordinary, I had higher expectations. We started off with the grilled chicken, which felt a little dry to be honest, they should have brined the chicken more, if they did at all. From there we moved to the fish irani tikka, which was decent but could have been better. Then we ordered the shawarma wrap, which was comparatively better. Finally, we tried out the spaghetti with meatballs, which was a complete disappointment. If you want a shawarma, you can grab a bite, but I would not recommend any of the other items I mentioned.

Steak House has spun out of Lebanese Junction Hatibagan. Lebanese Junction has been around of a while now(3 years to be precise). This place is adjacent to Star Theatre Hatibagan. This place is famous for its Shawarama and has now it has launched its new continental menu.

 

On entering the place it will give you the impression of a place for grabbing a Shawarama Wrap with tall sitting stools for 5-6 people behind which is a sliding door leading you to the another section of the Restaurant. Once you go beyond the door you will find yourself seated in a pretty well-lit Air Conditioned area with a sitting arrangement for 16-20 people. We sat in this room, it had framed posters of bands on one wall, framed posters of sportsmen on the other and a very simply done brick style painted wall inbetween the two. The interior of this section is kept pretty simple and not much change has been done to this section to keep the whole focus of the venture for a gastronomical experience.

The sitting area has been increased, which was a complaint made by a lot of reviewers earlier, and the management has listened to the voice of the reviewers :D And there is a 30 people sitting arrangement now, with a simply decorated squeaky clean place.

Now coming to the food. I was invited on a foodbloggers meet by Mr. Tanmoy Basak

It's a small place, just beside star theatre, Hatibagan. The ambiance can be described as average. The food was also pretty ordinary, I had higher expectations. We started off with the grilled chicken, which felt a little dry to be honest, they should have brined the chicken more, if they did at all. From there we moved to the fish irani tikka, which was decent but could have been better. Then we ordered the shawarma wrap, which was comparatively better. Finally, we tried out the spaghetti with meatballs, which was a complete disappointment. If you want a shawarma, you can grab a bite, but I would not recommend any of the other items I mentioned.

Steak House has spun out of Lebanese Junction Hatibagan. Lebanese Junction has been around of a while now(3 years to be precise). This place is adjacent to Star Theatre Hatibagan. This place is famous for its Shawarama and has now it has launched its new continental menu.

 

On entering the place it will give you the impression of a place for grabbing a Shawarama Wrap with tall sitting stools for 5-6 people behind which is a sliding door leading you to the another section of the Restaurant. Once you go beyond the door you will find yourself seated in a pretty well-lit Air Conditioned area with a sitting arrangement for 16-20 people. We sat in this room, it had framed posters of bands on one wall, framed posters of sportsmen on the other and a very simply done brick style painted wall inbetween the two. The interior of this section is kept pretty simple and not much change has been done to this section to keep the whole focus of the venture for a gastronomical experience.

a small joint near star theatre.we chose ac seating interior and the ambience is totally dull. in food we ordered chicken rice balls in starter and that lacks flavours totally.the main course of a swarma wrap was still decent enough.their regular water is not even filtered and the salt cellar wasn't working well and they gave excuse for that.the prices are tax inclusive in menu but still quite high considering the venue and quality of food.

After I and my best friend was tired shopping on the streets of hatibagan we decided to grab some shwarma wrap in  Lebanese junction. Now we have previously been here during our presidency days for a quick bite..but this time they informed us about the new steak joint that was right inside. So the name of steak made us crave for some real meat and we entered. The ambiance and decor is basic and clean . coming to the food, we ordered a chicken steak and our old friend shwarma wrap. The wrap.was as usual good and well filled. But the steak was in expectedly amazing. They have presented it exactly like the ones we get in the steak factory. A healthy piece of grilled chicken breast came wrapped in a beautiful wine and mushroom sauce. The plate had boiled tossed veggies, French fries and an sunny side up egg. Ybe chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked but not over cooked. The french fries were undoubtedly the best among what I have previously tasted. The steak was really good. We paid four hundred something for a steak and a wrap. Overall good.

Have been to this only for takeaways but planning to visit it very soon as they have expanded there seating arrangements. You get the sumptuous flavors of middle east at an affordable price. The biryani smells exquisite and the kebabs are as tender as they should be.

My wrap contained too much hummus and less chicken for my liking. Also they make you wait more than an hour if you come later in the night time.

This Lebanese joint is located just beside Star Theatre in Hatibagan. Famous for their Lebanese items, this place just launched their continental menu.

Started with the Fish Irani Tikka which was a very well prepared fish item. There was no fishy smell whatsoever!
Also had their Shawarma Salad, for a taste of their Lebanese items among all the continental stuff, which tasted really good.
Not being a fan of big pieces of meat, the Grilled Chicken wasn't something I could favour.
The Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce was a lovely preparation. However, there is scope for improvement.
Prawn New Burg was was one of the best items of that day. This prawn dish was a creamy sauce based concoction served in a ring of steamed rice and tasted just too good!
All of this accompanied with Iced Tea and Virgin Mojito. The Virgin Mojito was perfectly made with apt amount of fizz and flavour.

Brownie with Chocolate Sauce and Caramel custard to end on a sweet note.
The Brownie was incredible even without any vanilla ice cream. I haven't had a brownie this yummy in quite a long time.

Overall, a great experience. Definitely dropping by with my family next time!
Good luck to the entire team!

This was another event hosted by @Foodzpah. We went over there at around 7 in the evening and after a bit chit-chats, we placed the orders.
The restaurant is located just on the hatibagan crossing beside the star theatre. There is a place to sit outside and then there is a section with proper tables and chairs(with AC). The owner of the place - Prasun visited us and asked for the quality of food and he is a genuinelly nice person.
In appetizers we had iced tea and virgin mojito. The iced tea was not that good but the mojito was kickass. In starters we had prawn fitters, fish irani tikka, mutton meat balls and grilled chicken. All the starters were so very lipsmacking, cooked in very less oil and the presentation was again a winner. Before the maincourse was serves, we were asked to try the shawarma salad - this was also very nice - prepared with right amount of veggies and mayo sauce. In main course we had Grilled fish steak in butter and lemon sauce, pot roast mutton and prawn new burg. The last two items are basically rice preparations served with mutton gravy and prawn in white sauce respectively. All the main course items were again very sumptuous.
Overall a nice experience and specially its definitely recommended in north kolkata area where continental and lebanese food joints are very less in numbers.

Weekdays are always boring but tonight it wasn't and I owe this junction for the same ^_^
Probably my first dinner scene @North Calcutta and I do not regret!
This place is easy to locate (very close to the renowned Star theatre)and a perfect adda joint for teens.
There are enough reasons to like this place and ambiance is one of them.
One just can't forget the red brick wall against which endless groufies could be clicked 😉
We inaugurated our dinner scene with coolers like Iced tea n Mojitos.
I found mojito more refreshing than the iced tea. 
Prawn fritters are to die for...deep fried and soft they were👌
Mutton meat balls were succulent and yummy as well.
We were elated with the shwarma salad served with humus. Healthy, creamy and filling of course!!
Well the best is yet to be reviewed 👇
Prawn served with herb rice was ravishing..the taste is simply unforgettable. Creamy n yummy as well! 
It tasted way better than it looked..there lies the essence of simplicity I surmise!❤
Grilled chicken came as a surprise to us! Soft..juicy..and delicious!!
One plate is more than enough for two! Pocket friendly as well. So what are you waiting for??
Pot roast mutton was an unique dish I must say. Have never tasted something like this before. Mutton lovers must be real happy with this platter!
You must be dreaming about the desserts now ;)
Well how could we leave the place without trying their famous dessert items!
I don't know if Brownie was good or the Caramel custard just tasted better.
Wish it never ended. Brownie was just so perfect. ❤ Chocoaddicts do not even dare skip this item.
Caramel was a level up in this case! Heavenly in one word 👌

Lebanese Junction in Haatibagan, has recently introduced their extended steak menu and 7 of us were invited over by Mr.Prasun Saha for a food tasting session.

The ambience is simple with an air conditioned room, comfortable seating arrangement of about 16-20 people at a time.

Coming to what we ate and how we felt about the food:-

1) Chicken Rice Balls @Rs.180 (4.25/5) : Imagine cheesy buttery risotto being dipped into egg wash then crumb coated and deep fried to perfection - what a bliss! The outer coating was crispy and crunchy while the inner portion was moist and gooey. It might be a bit dry for some but the harissa mayo served with it comes handy enough to dip and dunk before popping these round beauties into your mouth.

2) Minced Mutton Steak @Rs.380 (4.75/5) : This was a clear winner, without a doubt! What amazing punch of flavours. Oh yum! The mutton steak was shaped like a thick juicy patty and topped with a garlicky sweet-salty-spicy sauce, astounding enough to activate all the 5 taste buds of a person. The sauce lusciously merged with the juices of the meat and every spoonful was nothing short of a dazzling concoction of various aromas! What a beauty.😍 The mutton steak was accompanied by a portion of flawless french fries and a side of butter sauted fresh boiled vegetables! Lipsmacking, to say the least!

3) Fish and Chips @Rs.250.00 (4.5/5) : A thick fillet of flaky fresh basa batter fried to perfection, served with a portion of impeccably crunchy french fries. The tartar sauce served with this adrenaline- incrasing dish, is another excellent element of the dish which further lifts up the flavours to another level, altogether. The tartar sauce here is served with a twist - tastes a lot like tzatziki and I can literally gobble up bowlfulls of this dip, it's that good.😍😁

4) Chicken Ala Kiev @Rs.320.00 (4.35/5) : The First runner up, unquestionably. Chicken Ala Kiev is usually prepared by encasing a thick slab of rock-hard frozen butter inside well beaten and bruised chicken breast fillet and then seasoned with salt and pepper. The rolled chicken is then dipped in eggs and crumb fried to magnificence. When you cut into the golden fried stunner, the frozen butter now melter, oozes out with utmost opulence. Such a sensational dish. The kieve comes with a portion of buttery mashed potatoes (4/5) and sauted vegetable. 😌💙

5) California Fish Steak @Rs.320.00 (3.5/5) : A large bulky portion of batter fried basa topped with a sweet-salty-spicy sauce! The sauce was rustic with lots of garlic. The punch of pungency from garlic was indeed amazing! I would have preffered the fish to be more firm and a bit more fried, though. A little more seasoning of white pepper and salt to the fish alone, would elevate the dish to a new level of deliciousness. 😋 California Steak was accompanied by a portion of herbed rice and sauted vegetable. 😊

6) Chelow Kebab @Rs.350.00 (3.85/5) : Chelow Kebab has it's roots in Iran and happens to be it's National dish. It comprised of a portion of herbed rice with generous amount of butter encompassed by 2 pieces of cylindrical mutton seekh kebabs, 6 chunks of spicy chicken tikka kebabs, sunny side up and salad. The chicken tikka kebabs were really soft and juicy whereas the mutton seekh kebabs needed some improvisation in terms of dryness but the flavours of the mutton seekh were better than the chicken kebabs. Over all, it was a pretty good dish with neat flavours. 😄

7) Chocolate brownie with chocolate sauce @Rs.140.00 (4.35/5) : A slab of ooey-gooey, chocolate brownie with walnuts topped with a rich mouth watering hot chocolate sauce. Really pretty good.💙😍 A must try for everyone.

8) Caramel Pudding/Custare @Rs.130.00 (4/5) : The caramel pudding was all wobbly and soft with a perfect slightly burnt beautiful caramel. It wasn't overtly sweet but sweet enough to satisfy your sweet tooth in the hour of need. A very well made caramel pudding indeed. 🙈

The food was beautifully presented and everything was top notch from the service to the taste and freshness of the ingredients!

●FINAL CONCLUSIONS
☆Food - 4/5.
☆Service - 4/5 (Super fast!)
☆Staff Behaviour - 4.25/5.

A very splendid experience with
Thank you

Good news for North Calcuttans, Lebanese Junction has now introduced their new Steak menu, which means happiness is now double as because one great place is serving two different cuisines. We, our group of 7, visited this place on the launch event of their new steak menu and our experience was overwhelmingly expressive. Mr Prasun saha, the owner of this place, welcomed us with his pleasant reception.

This place is divided over two sections - outer section with 5-6 desk sitting availability and inner section, the dining place with 25-30 people sitting availability. Ambience is pleasing, interiors are done well matching the aura of the place.

Now, the actual part of the review, food. We were introduced to 8 dishes ranging from starters to entree till desserts. In starters we were served Chicken Rice Balls and, Fish and Chips; followed by main course menu which included Chelo Kebab, California Fish Steak, Minced Mutton Steak and Chicken Ala Kiev ; finally the sweetest part, the dessert which included Caramel Custard and Brownie with Chocolate Sauce.

Chicken Rice Balls - 6 deep fried balls with crusty outer part. Perfect texture from outside, one can feel the crunchiness after the first bite. The filling was perfect combination of chicken and rice, very moist indeed. The harissa dip complimented the dish pretty well.

Fish and Chips - 2 fish fillets of basa with crisp coating outside. The portion of fish was sufficient enough, cooked perfectly. The feeling of the fish just melting in your mouth, gives this dish a recommendable note. The accompanied fries were just crispy and tasty as we expect french fries to be. The tartar sauce will just win your heart, leaving you craving for more.

Chelo Kebab - This dish, favourite for every person in Calcutta, stands out to best here also. 6 pieces of tikka kebab, 2 seekh kebab, one poached egg accompanied with herb rice and dollop of butter on top of it, and salads. The kebabs, the star allurer of the platter, was grilled to perfection and made the dish worth. Absolute recommendation from my end.

California Fish Steak - A large piece of basa fish with a spicy sauce on top. The sauce will give you a tongue tickling experience, this platter also included herbed rice and sauted vegetables. The fish was done to perfection. Fish lovers must give this dish a try.

Minced Mutton Steak - The show stopper of all the entree dishes. A big chunk of minced mutton, topped with spicy sauce will leave you awestruck, served with french fries and sauted vegetables. A big yes for this dish guys.

Chicken Ala Kiev - My favourite among all. A thick chicken fillet rolled over butter, coated finely with breadcrumbs and fried finely, presented on a bed of mashed potatoes and sauted vegetables. The butter just oozed out once the kiev was cut open, that is the main component of this dish, the butter oozing out makes the dish perfect. The combination of mashed potatoes, chicken and butter, takes the dish to another level of awesomeness. Recommended again.

Caramel Custard - Sweet treat for the sweet lovers. Caramalised perfectly, the custard tasted heavenly topped with cherry. The sweetness level was appropriate, thickness was perfect. A must try dessert at this place.
Brownie with Chocolate Sauce - My personal favourite again in dessert section. Hot soft brownie with the perfectly done chocolate sauce. Only thing one will say after having this is 'we want more'. In most of the places the brownies are mostly not so moist, but here it was extremely moist and delicious. Very much recommended.

I would again visit this place sooner. Apart from food which is indeed excellent here, the ambience, service, presentation, cleanliness, everything deserves a must go points.

Thank you

Lebanese Junction – Steak house, the new addition to the already running Lebanese Junction beside Star Theatre at Hatibagan is a treat for the North Calcuttans, especially when the much-awaited Durga puja is just around the corner.

This newly extended part has a decent and humble sitting arrangement that can accommodate 30 plus people, unlike the previous establishment. Lebanese Junction – Steak House has opened its door for the Continental lovers, providing a variety of continental dishes at an extremely affordable price.

Mr Prasun Saha, the owner of the restaurant was generous enough to invite us, a group of food bloggers, on the occasion of launching this new section of the restaurant. Hearty thanks to Mr Tanmay Basak for arranging the bloggers’ meet. We were thoroughly engaged in conversation by Mr Saha, telling us all about the establishment and in meanwhile he ordered 7-8 dishes especially for us. 

1. Chicken Rice Balls

Made with mashed boiled rice and steamed chicken, it tasted light on the palate. The tartar sauce was a yum accompaniment with it.

180/- for 6 decent sized balls. (4/5)

2. Fish & Chips

This English Classic was a treat to the taste bud. Soft and Juicy Basa fish in a light batter along with some crunchy fries did not disappoint at all.

250/- for 2 broad strips of basa fish along with fries. (4/5)

3. Chelo Kebab

This was as good as a Chelo kebab should be! Soft and tender minced meat spiced to the right amount made the Sheekh kebab melt-in-your mouth. The Basmati rice was done to perfection. Well, the chicken tikkas were a bit on the down side as I felt them to be slightly drying.

350/-   (3.75/5)

4. California Fish Steak

A soft and juicy fish steak served with a rice peppery gravy/sauce accompanied by a bed of basmati rice and steamed & lightly tossed veggies.

320/-   (4/5)

5. Minced Mutton Steak

This was a mutton lover’s delight! But even not being a mutton lover, I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it. As it was prepared with minced meat, the marination could seep into the patty really well, making it drooling on our taste buds. Highly recommended for my fellow foodies.

380/-   (4.5/5)

6. Chicken A La Kiev

And here comes the show-stealer! Unapologetically sinful yet something to die for. I can bet no one will be satisfied with a single plate of this fabulous preparation. one would either order a second helping or definitely plan the next hang-out here.

320/-  (5/5)

7. Caramel Custard  and  Brownie with Chocolate sauce

The Caramel Custard was exactly as it should have been; tender and light on the palate.

130/-  (4.5/5)

The Walnut brownie with hot chocolate sauce was the show-stopper. Needless to say that it left us craving for more and more with every bite. Highly recommended.

140/-    (5/5)

 

Now, to sum up, the overall journey, in brief, is as follows:

Food : 4.5 / 5

Service: 4.5/5

Cleanliness: 5/5

Ambience: 4/5

Counting days and occasion to turn up here real soon along with friends and family this time!

Location of the place is great and the outlet is very easy to spot . 
Many of the items on the menu card are not available . 
Ordered chicken swarama wrap . Well , first of all it looked noway similar to the one presented on the menu card . Presentation of the food is very average . 
Coming to taste , it tasted ok , nothing great about it . Contains lots and lots of mayonnaise . 
Place is clean and tidy . 
And most importantly , Self service .

Lebanese junction is a renowned place in the whole of hatibagan area for providing lebanese delicacies. Operating a restaurant in north kolkata is itself a very challenging prospect due to the fact that locals over there prefer their local street food stalls due to the minimal pricing on the offer let alone trying out lebanese delicacies. But the owner of the outlet Mr. Prasun Saha has done a fantastic job in running and continuing this outlet amidst all the difficulties. So today we visited lebanese junction on the eve of their release of new continental menu along with their lebanese menu.

This outlet is located exactly at hatibagan more just beside star theatre opposite of leather world. The place has two sections i.e. outer section which has bench desks for 5-6 people while the inside room is for dining which has a capacity of about 20-25 covers. The decor has been kept simple. They have put up frames of quirky phrases,music bands like beatles,metallica,lamb of god etc, sports icons etc.

Anyways we were offered the following dishes from their new continental menu:-

1. Chicken rice balls - 6 fried crusty ball like chops were served which had the stuffing of minced chicken and mashed rice. The dish was served with harissa dip. The stuffing tasted great and was moist from the inside. The harissa dip offered an unique texture with the dish.

2. Fish n Chips - 2 Large piece of basa fillet with crispy outer skin served with french fries and tartare sauce. They use indian basa instead of vietnamese basa!! The dish was cooked to perfection with generous amount of basa being provided in each fillet. The fish had no stink which was indicative of its freshness. The tartare sauce simply won our hearts along with the fries. The french fries were super crispy and that's how fries should be in my opinion. Recommended dish!!

3. Chelo kebab - Chelo kebab is a fan favourite amongst calcuttans from the lebanese cuisine. The chelo platter consisted of herb rice with a dollop of butter on top along with 6pcs of tikka kebab,2 large mutton seekh kebabs, 1 poached egg, tomatoes & cucumbers. The dish overall was good in taste with tender tikka kebabs,flavoured herb butter rice and the spicy mutton seekh kebabs.

4. California fish steak - Large chunk of basa with spicy in house special sauce served along with herb rice and sauteed vegetables. The fish again stole the show. The sauce as well was pleasant to eat along with the vegetables.

5. Minced mutton steak - This dish stole the show amongst the main course dishes. Large fat minced mutton steak covered in house special devil sauce along with french fries and sauteed vegetables. The steak was too delicious which made our tastebuds dance. The sauce complimented the steak too well. Recommended dish none the less!!

6. Chicken Ala Kiev - A big chunk of crusty butter infused chicken ala kiev served on a bed of mashed potato and vegetables. This dish as well stole the show in the main course. The butter just oozed out once the ala kiev was cut open. The chicken portion was very generous and the outer layer was fried to perfection maintaining the perfect crispness in every bite. The mashed potato was very well made as well. A dish full of flavours and will leave your tastebuds satisfied. Recommended dish!!

7. Brownie in chocolate sauce - A large chunk of hot brownie was served with chocolate sauce. Marvellous the only word which came out of our mouths. The brownie was very moist and really left us craving for more. Recommended.

8. Caramel Custard - Soft delicate custard served with sweet syrup. The custard here is one of the best custard i have tasted anywhere. Perfect texture of the custard keeping the flavours of the caramel intact. Every spoonful of the custard really made our tastebuds happy. Recommended.

All the dishes were cooked to perfection. I wish Mr.Prasun Saha all the very best for this new venture and wish him all the success. He was indeed a great host for today's session. Also a special mention to Tanmoy Basak for inviting us for today's session.

We had Chicken Shawarma Salad coz it looked very appetising as well as quite affordable. The salad was very refreshing, healthy and surprisingly tasty! It went great with the pita bread they provided which is just an improvisation of (or Lebanese word for) chapati, made of white flour (maida). It was unbelievably soft. Service was fast and although they lacked ac, the seating was uncomfortable and the location was very good and convenient. Hence overall, that place is a must visit and I will surely go there again (and again!). :)

Located at the heart of Hatibagan this place remains to be a hit. Been here twice and had ordered the chicken shawarma wrap, chicken shawarma salad and hummus with pita bread. All the three dishes are loaded with chicken and ample amount of mayonnaise and cream. The chutney that comes with the wrap is spicy and helps balancing the sweetness of the bread.

Last year I visited, the manager ( a bald man perhaps in his 30s ) was very unprofessional, has no idea about how to talk to customers. I'm not sure what is the protocol but we had ordered a takeaway first but later decided to have the food there itself, (and informed the staff about the same before they packed anything) as they took over 45 minutes to serve our order. in spite of this, the packaging charge was not refunded. I saw that they even had a closed dining area but neglected to inform us about the same, we just kept waiting outside even when the area was almost empty thinking it was booked for a private party ( it wasn't, we saw other customers going in as we were leaving). Unless the management changes, I have no intention of going there ever again.

It is more than enough for 1 person. Will like to try other dishes again.

So fiery it is BUT NOT THE FOOD. INSTEAD THE TEMPER OF THE OWNER.
To his convenience he has silently ommited the onion salad from the swarma plate . When confronted he surely had a wonderful lie and that was that people waste the salad . Wow so this guy saves his costing by selling morality instead of the food that I baught with my money. Some legend I must say.
So after exchange of words I got to see his temper as well. Onions nahi mila to kya hai, gussa aur morality to mila. So people hurry up and get your share .

The Chicken Shawarma was average compared to Shawarma Nation's wrap. Possiblly not the best wrap. On the other hand the grilled chicken was amazing. It was so juicy and palatable. Worth a try. Will surely visit again for their grilled chicken. Cheers. :)

Chicken pieces are chunky, soft and very well cooked. The high quantity  of mayonnaise just made it awesome. Small place but those who like to experiment with different taste must visit this place.

জাওয়ানে জাজ - প্রায় আগের মত করেই বানানো । খালি মুরগির ডানা টা । পার্সলে পাতা , মেয়নিস দিয়ে সাজানো । স্টারটার হিসেবে নিখুঁত বাছাই হয়ে ওঠার যোগ্যতা সম্পন্ন । 

মাটন চেলো কাবাব - পারস্যের ইয়েলো রাইস আর রাইতা দিয়ে সাজিয়ে খাবার জিনিস । ঐতিহ্য আর স্বাদ , একসাথে জিভের সামনে । মশলাখেকোদের ভালো লাগতে বাধ্য । 

লেবানন কে কাবাব - সেরা রান্না । বর্ণনার ভাষা নেই । কাবাব প্রেমিদের ভ্যালেন্টাইন হয়ে উঠবে । 

লেবানিস সিস টাউক - মুরগির গ্রিল । কেবল সাদা মাংসটা ব্যবহার হয় । খেতে ভালো । 

এছাড়াও হুমুস নাসিব অ্যান্ড পিতা ব্রেড আর চিকেন স্বরমা স্যালাড উল্লেখ্য , এরা মুখশুদ্ধির পদ হিসেবেই বিবেচ্য বলে মনে করি । 

এখানের একটা বড় সমস্যা হল জায়গার অভাব । একবারে ১৫ জনের বেশি ধরবেও না । বাথরুম ভি নেহি হ্যায় !! কিন্তু স্রেফ খাবারের মান , কম দাম আর সার্ভিসের জন্য ৪/৫ দিলাম । সবজি , মাংস , স্যালাড , মশলা সবে মিলে একটা আস্ত প্যাকেজ । লেবাননের রান্নাকে খানিক ভারতীয়করন করে মুল ধারাটির উৎকর্ষতা বুঝিয়ে দেবার জন্য ধন্যবাদ ।

Yeah!!!....When you want Lebanese food, the ideal one.... you have one answer from me....The Lebanese Junction...Situated at a very approachable location viz. Hatibagan crossing just beside Star Theatre, this food outlet offers you Lebanese in pocket-friendly price tags. Their ever-smiling staff caters you cordially.
I ate Kay Kabab and Hummus with Pita as per recommendation from staff as I was not eager to have Shawarma wrap. I didn't eat Lebanese ever before, but believe me, it wouldn't taste better than here. They have tried not to make the food to become an Indo-lebanese fusion by making the dish spicy and oily. They are conscious enough to give it an authentic flavour, so that your Lebanese love continues. It is easy on your tongue.
The sitting space is a bit smaller because after evening the restaurant fills with customers. I can say, a visit is a must as our city doesn't have enough Lebanese outlet 👍👍👍

Lebanese junction is located at Hatibagan near star theatre which serves Lebanese cuisine at an affordable price.

I was invited from PanchPhoron group as a part of food tasting .

Ambience is nice with small sitting arrangenents.

Staffs are cordial.

Service is quick.

We were served the following-
Chicken shawarma wrap, grilled chicken, mutton chelo, Lebanon Kay kebab, chicken shawarma salad, Hummus pita, Lebanese shish tawook , biriyani and Jwwaneh Djaj.

Chicken shawarma wrap was awesome, tasty with generous fillings and yummy.
Grilled chicken and mutton chelo were nice, Soft and juicy.
Lebanon Kay kebab was also soft , succulent and nice.
Chicken shawarma salad, hummus pita, Lebanese shish tawook and jwwaneh Djaj were nice too.
Their biriyani is just awesome, cooked with olive oil has an excellent taste , aromatic  and is absolutely healthy.

One thing I found that they cook their preparations without using much oil, which is a good thing for health conscious people.

Biriyani and chicken shawarma wrap and salad are highly recommended.

Thank you PanchPhoron for inviting me . It was an absolute pleasure of tasting Lebanese cuisine at its best.

Thanks the Chef behind the screen.

Good Food
There is this nice and decent place called Lebanese Junction located at Hatibagan CROSSING. The food is awesome and priced quite reasonable. The restaurant is not so pretty big and has a simple ambiance. I think this is the first Lebanese Restaurant though I am not too sure about any other in town. The hummus is quite authentic so is the shwarma. As we know Bangaloreans love experimenting with new cuisine, I hope they will surely give a boost to this restaurant too. I wish the restaurant a great success.
They Have introduced Steak Menu recently. 
First Steak House in this area. 

Have a Visit ! It is definitely recommended !

Dropped in with my friend here a few days ago. Located right next to star theatre, this food promises to serve authentic Lebanese food. We ordered chicken shawarma salad. The salad was decent and the pita bread wasn't dry and chewy. But i felt the prices was a bit high in respect to the quantity served.

As per Restaurant and zomato restaurant closes at 10:30pm, I went there at 9:45 restaurant was already closed and the workers were washing there equipment I went inside to enquiry they say restaurant is closed at 9:30 pm, kindly visit this restaurant after checking if they are open and food is available or not. DO NOT GO BY Restaurant or Zomato timings you might not find any thing.

Having tried lebanese at various places in and out India, this is one of the worst experience. The sawarma lacks the juicyness that it should have. The pricing is also high and the hilarious part is how the staff attends the customer. They either dont know what's in their menu or what's cooking in their kitchen. They have separate A/C seating arrangement and quite funnily they say they will only switch on the A/C if your bill is of certain amount. Poor on service and bad food quality, I am going back for sure.
I dont recommend this place to anyone too.

The chicken breast used on the shawrma was too hard and rough..
Don't know how old was the was which they used..
Don't think they bring new chicken every day and guess they served us a day or 2days old chicken..

We visited this joint last thursday. The joint is situated right beside Star Theatre at Hatibagan which is easily accessible from any direction. The outlet is quite good with minimalistic decor and simple sitting arrangement 
We have ordered Chicken Shawarma wrap, which we got just 5 mins of waiting. Man!!! The food was just awesome. The Chicken was righthly cooked and the whole product was 10% oil & 90% taste. 🙌 
The cons are, non-ac seating arrangement. Fix the stools guys. Only 2 stools has the pin, all the others were just like up & down 😂😂😂 
Will give it 5 star after the stool fixation & renovated wall decoration. Give something new, like Lebanese theme in the decoration. 
Must visit for pocket friendly low oil awesome food. 
Peace out ✌

Tried during the Puja's, craving for some food but that had to be awesome at an relatively unknown place. Saw shawarma on offer and I went on board. Boy that was a good choice. 
A self service counter with the basic amenities in touching distance, (drinking water available from mineral water tank, nice napkin holders that hold the regular stuff......) I was pretty happy to find everything at its place, nice and clean and organized. Top marks for you sir!!! 
Then came the moment of truth the shawarma 😋
And I loved it. Better than the one available at Forum and way better than I had tried else where. Chicken was slicked and diced in the right proportion, sauce was not too less or more,and the wrap was yummy smooth and soft. I loved it...... 
Looking forward to visit this place again..... Thank You 🙂

I love the chicken swarma wrap as obvious, but the notable stand outs are 
Chicken swarma salad, mutton chello kebab,  both chicken and mutton Arabian biriyani. 
Didn't try out the fish items ever, so can't help on those. 
A good place to have a healthy yet heavy meal.

এই রিভিউ পড়ার আগে সবাই একটা কথা মাথায় রাখবেন।
      "SELF SERVICE"
অনেকদিন পর লেবানিজ খাবার খাওয়ার লোভে নবমীর দুপুরে হাতিবাগানের এই ফুড জয়েন্ট এ ঢুকেছিলাম। এই রেস্তোরায় ঢুকে প্রথমেই লক্ষ্য করবেন যে দেয়ালে লেখা আছে উপরিউক্ত দুটি শব্দ।
এছাড়া দেয়ালের গায়ে সাঁটানো টেবিল(যেমন ভাতের হোটেলে থাকে)
বেমানান চেয়ার(যেমন বারে থাকে)। 
আমি ভেতরে ঢোকা মাত্রই কাউন্টারে যেতে হলো খাবার অর্ডার দেওয়ার জন্য। অর্ডার দিয়ে ফিরছি চেয়ারে,ডাক পড়লো..'দাদা,পেমেন্ট করুন'
ঠিক আছে,পেমেন্ট করে দিলাম।
একটা রিসিট নিয়ে বসে আছি।
মিনিট পনেরো পর ডাক পড়লো 'খাবার নিয়ে যান'
গেলাম,একটা swarna wrap আমার জন্য তৈরি হয়ে অপেক্ষমান।
দেখি অত্যন্ত ছোট শোলার প্লেটে খাবার পরিবেশিত হয়েছে।
একটু বড় প্লেট দিতে বললাম।
তারপর ক্রমান্বয়ে চাটনি,স্যালাড প্রভৃতি দিতে বলতে হলো।
Self service শব্দ দুটির আক্ষরিক প্রয়োগ দেখলাম।
এবার খাবার পালা।
Swarma wrap এর উপরে চমৎকার স্বাদ।মাংসে-স্যালাডে-মেয়োনিজে ভরপুর।কিন্তু wrap এর ভেতরে শুধু মাংস আর স্যালাড।
পেট ভরলেও  মন ভরলো না।
কে জানে পরের বার রান্না টাও SELF SERVICE দিতে হয় কিনা!!😄

Royal lebanese first started in hatibagan area and was a hit but their quality has degraded with time which gives lebanese junction a plus point. I hope they continue to maintain their quality.

Lebanese Junction at Hatibagan is the nearest outlet from my place where I can satisfy my sudden Shawarma cravings. So this Saturday having nothing else to do I came here to have my classic Chicken Shawarma Wrap. It was delicious as it should be. Will come back again to dig on some of their other offerings.

Located in Hatibagan crossing near Star theatre.
FOOD: chicken swarma roll, though quite filling tasted good.
Olive oil made biriyani was not up to the mark.

Ambience: Basic sitting arrangement is uncomfortable. They have AC section also but most of the times it remained closed.
Staffs: They are prompt in service. But not knowledgeable about the dishes. They can't give you much information about the dishes which is disappointing for this type of joints serving exotic foods.
Conclusion: you may give it a try to give your taste bud a new experience but don't expect much ambience or fine dining.

The poster boy of this food joint is Chicken Shawarma wrap. It is awesome. I will have it again. We also had Mutton Chello kebab and Chicken Arabian biriyani. Kebab was good. But the biriyani was a disaster. It was very dry. I did not like the taste also.  I had to swallow it with water.  Space is very little. But I guess it is  enough for this type of concept. 
It  deserves a visit .

I hardly wrote any review on Zomato, but my experience with Lebanese Junction (LJ) forced me to.
In one word it's pathetic.
The Shawarma wrap ordered had hardly any meat and was full with mayonnaise only. Also it was sweet in taste (unexpected sweetness).
That made me sick after wards.
They were not willing to give me the bill and were making excuses.
Finally on a piece of paper they provided the receipt with LJ stamp.

Nice place to grab some tasty and healthy food, situated at 4 point crossing, Hatibagan. Near Star theatre. I am not a big fan of leabanese foods but after trying this spot , I have to think twice about that. 😋
Food is nice , dine in place is ok. 
Talking about food, food is nice as I said before. Less oils, healthy food. A perfect spot for health conscious people. 
From me its a thumbs up.. 👍👍👍

Food was good no doubt.. awesome flavor , chicken tastes good.
would surely like to visit once again.. I wished the inside restaurant would be open at day time too. It was hot outside for the smoke and fire. Otherwise the food was good.

Have eaten here a few times, the only pro being its location and fast service.
Have tried shawarna wrap, shawarna salad. Chello kabab, humus nashib with pita bread. Average quality food. Salad was good. Chello kabab worse with kababs very dry. Quantity is enough and quality often not upto mark.
Management is rude, specially as it is self service and has hardly any sitting place. There is an AC interior sitting which is mostly closed. Card payment is only accepted for higher amounts.
The item which sells the most is the shawarna wrap which people buy and walk away eating like a roll. 
A proper sit up meal is difficult. Staff are mostly clueless and do not even offer a napkin.

I've been frequenting this place for quite some time now. 
The place has amazing shawarma wraps overflowing with yummy chicken pieces drenched in tartar sauce and sprinkled with tobasco sauce. I've tried shawarma wraps from a few outlets over the city but this remains my favourite. 
Their biryani is cooked in olive oil..it has a refreshing taste not quite similar to the taste of biriyani we're accustomed to but it's good. 

Paid parking available in front or a little away from the shop.
Drop in here for a quick bite admist your busy shopping schedule at hatibagan! You won't be disappointed.

Located near Star Theatre , visiting this place is a must after watching movie and some shopping. The wrapped swarmas , mutton biriyani cooked in olive oil are my most favourite although i did not like the chelo kabab much.

I came here long ago. Sorry for late review.  I ordered chicken shawarma,  and grilled chicken. Shawarma was okay but the grilled chicken was a waterfall. We stuck a fork in it and water started oozing unlike any other place. The manager needs a special mention for his bad behavior. We asked him whether he accepts card and his answer was " I you want to pay by card then order above 300 else move out". It was quiet surprising as we never experienced this behavior, totally worth 2.

A average place. Non spicy food.. And they claim that they use only olive oil. Anyways.. Single visit is OK.. But not for a get together.. Sitting arrangements are not up to the mark(they don't add taxes though) but service is quick.. Place for those who want to try something different. Reasonable pricing.

This place is very near to my place. I was very excited about this because I love leanest food.
Their shawarma wrap is really good . However you can easily give the other stuff a miss specially the shawarma salad.
They also have an inside air conditioned seating arrangement if you like.

I had visited this restaurent on yesterday for the first time. I went their with one of my friends who is a regular cystomer of  Lebanese Junction. It was really awesome experience. I tested shawarma chicken role. It is something that is superb tasty but a healthy snack. Less oil, and healthy ingredients is just perfect for anyone. They prepared it in a healthy and hygienic way. I have never tasted a role as healthy as it was. I will definitely recommend it to have it atleast once, specially people who are extremely figure.. I found it healthy snack item.  I wish it would be nearby my home. I would love to have it everyday. Something negetive about the restaurant is it is a small area. Hence Group hangout is little tough. But the size of the restaurant does not compromise the quality of the food. This is a perfect destination where you can get healthy as well as tasty food at a reasonable price.

Never knew that non veg food outside home could be so tasty yet healthy.
The chicken shawarma wraps and salads are a must try.
Don't be fooled, the quantity is enough to fill your tummy. Head to this place if you're tired of the same old chicken dishes.
PS: the chelo kabab here may disappoint experienced foodies.

Locate beside star theatre. Tried their chicken shawarma wrap. Liked it. I went there around 3-30pm. So the place was empty in terms of customers. Service was pretty quick. Pita bread was soft, delicate. Mayonise portion was fresh mixed with herbs, nd veggies. 1/4 portion is filled with deep mayo nd the remaining portion was heavenly with succulent pieces of meat.  Now my negative review is about two points.... 1-location of fans is wrong..... 2-child Labour (not expected )

First the pros -

1. Excellent location. Bang on Hatibagan crossing, beside Star Theatre.
2. As far as cuisine is concerned, a welcome change in this area.
3. Chicken Shwarma Salad tasted good and the quantity was good too.
4. Service was fast.

And the cons -

1. The pita bread though very filling doesn't taste good.
2. The biryani was bad. Too salty and complete waste of money.
3. The chello kebab was equally bad and overpriced. The chicken kebabs were hard, tasteless and full of binders only. There were hardly any chicken in it. And the amount of rice was only a handful. Please check attached image to see the amount of rice.
4. They have a separate AC section, but whenever I went there, found it closed. Don't know why they are not opening the proper sit down AC section, when they already have the space.
5. Stuffs are not well trained. When asked about some of the items they were clueless.

In all, they need to improve a lot. Hope the management wake up soon.

This place was meant for grabbing a quick shawarma wrap on the go. However one day I decided to step in with a couple of friends and the experience was delicious. Very ordinary decor and a self serviced food joint.

We had ordered a shawarma salad which was nice, as expected. Then we went ahead and tried chello kebab, mutton biryani, shish tawook and half of a grilled chicken. Shish tawook was interesting and the assortments of pita bread and hummus were nice. The chicken chelo kebab was good, nothing extraordinary. The grilled chicken was soft and tasty. The Arabian biryani was something very different and aromatic. Did not expect that I'd have chelo kebabs and biryani in a Lebanese food joint, however the experience was worth it.

Well I really liked their shawarma roll. It was better than royal Lebanese, till today . 
I order for shawarma salad, the chicken was not fresh. I visited for lunch, it was completely deserted, there was no one in the counter and the staffs looker dull too. I mean no one will feel welcomed in that ambience. 
The chicken in the salad was not fresh. Felt like it was from overnight or maybe a day or two old. 
I probably won't be visiting again.

My father's friend brought a takeaway of grilled chicken from here.the pirces are decent in size. The colour is a bit pale and looks weird. The side dip is made of yoghurt and carrots slices. Would have preferred a green coriander chutney as well. The chicken was soft so but a bit dry. 
I have tried the shawarmas here previously. They were just okay. Could be better.
Wishing them success.

The shish tawook is nice too... Only let down is da crunch of space n non ac restaurant. On one occasion, we were a group of 3 and on da hot n humid day,asked for ac arrangements, they said it would cost us 300 bucks extra... Just improve on dese areas, otherwise its perfectly fine.

Review: I had tried shawarma from other authentic Labenese restaurants (not in Kolkata).
Certainly this place offers a while new type of food to Kolkata but it failed to please me as the dressing was a bit sweet (considering Kolkata's sweet tooth) whereas the original offers pickled mango with chili flavor.

The chicken shawarma wrap is a delight to the taste buds. Thats my dinner spot before going for my night shift. A heavy food with great quality and real fast service. Took the roast chicken for a house party. It was like a cherry on the cake. Ambience - Ain't that classy. Situated on a busy crowded road. Overall a good place. If you just concentrate on the plate and forget the world then there's no chance of regret. Thumbs up!!

First time ever tried out Lebanese cuisine. It was a nice experience, nothing mind blowing. But it wasn't bad either. Obviously, i was sceptical. Had sheesh tawook and the chicken shawarma salad. Liked the salad immensely, the veggies were nice and crunchy and the dressing was delicious too. But the tawook was a big let down. Didn't like the taste, it was all one- note. However, would definitely try out the other dishes they have to offer, next time.

Read a lot of reviews and decided its high time to go check out the Joint . I was a little sceptical at first as the joint was almost empty but then decided to go ahead and order the chicken shawarma roll . They took there time and gave us the roll after 30/min but boy it was worth it. Loved every bite of it from the start to the end. Enjoyed it thoroughly.

Has been one of the least enjoyable places to eat. Located near Star theatre near hatibagan, the only positive i could find about this place was its location. The chicken shawarma salad was a major flop. Other than a generous portion with a good amount of chicken in the salad, there were hardly any positives. Chicken was way overcooked, veggies were underdone and the flavour was quite bland. Coming to the ambience, it certainly needs to be upgraded. Overall, it was not up to my expectations.

I hope they had 0 star rating..anyways giving 1 star under compulsion..I visited on poila baisakh...I had a horrible experience..the chicken was for 1 single swarma wrap but he ordered the other person to make 2 wraps out of it..very substandard quality..& I need to specifically mention the behaviour rather the attitude of the person in the cooking area..I don't know his name but with dark complexion..this was my first visit& surely my last...

Very strategically located, what attracted me to this place was the fact that it serves healthy food. Much to my disappointment, the food was far from healthy and seemed stale. The shawarma wrap was the only saving grace.

Their shawarma was very bad tasting, a smelly and a messy roll. It kept on falling into pieces and the sauce just got smeared haphazardly all over my hand. Somehow I felt it had gone stale. Never wanna try any of their items.

After a sweaty shopping day, one would look for something simple..less oily but delicious and here walks in "Lebanese Junction". It is a small eatery and food is good. I found the wrap little too thin. The filling was good. I missed the salad with it. 

We ordered Chicken Shawarma Wrap and Lebanon Kay Kabab. As mentioned earlier that wrap was thin. The kay kabab could had been better. The flesh was little dry. It could had been better. 

However, it is a good place and available at a reasonable price.

I DON'T KNOW Y THIS FAMOUS FOOD JUNCTION DOESN'T BROADEN THEIR TINY, LITTLE SPACE AS I KNOW THEY HAVE A SPACIOUS ROOM INSIDE!!!! 

* Location : Just beside famous age old Star theater its located on hatibagan mor.

* Ambience : As I said in the caps letter, its very uncomfortable to sit on those high and very small chairs. I ve seen many times aged people only avoid this food junction for its uncomfortable sitting arrangements. Very few people can sit though ( may be 15). They have a room inside,but no one knows why the management doesn't arrange sitting there. So, its always uncomfortable to eat those yummy Lebanese food standing in the food corner. (rating 3 on 10)

* Food : 1. As everyone knows CHICKEN SHWARMA WRAP is very famous among bengalis,so its worth mentioned 1st. very juicy, yummy, filling was quite mouthful. It was very good. (rating 10 on 10)
2. The taste of MUTTON CHELLO KEBAB didn't suit me. As we are used to the taste of chello kebab,it was totally different. They put on some biriyani rice with mutton kebabs and the taste of rice was worst. (rating 4 on 10)
3. CHICKEN KEBABS were worth eating and the special thing I noticed that they serve it with pitta bread. I ve no complain with this item. (rating 8 on 10)
4. I specifically ordered a new item I had never tried.....HUMUS NASHIB AND PITTA BREAD. I didn't know what was humus nashib and now I ve become a fan of it ( THOUGH MANY ORDERS IT WITHOUT KNOWING ITS TASTE AND DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL) (rating 8 on 10)

* Price : price is moderate. The area being situated at the heart of N. Kolkata, you can never promote business if your price gets higher. But m not sure if all food items are worth pricing.

* Management : As I said earlier, management should look into the uncomfortable sitting arrangement of older people and children. Sometimes they are rude also in a rush hr, pack of people standing in front of the counter for the food cz of unavailable sit, is an irritating sight to me.

* Recomended : Only the famous Chicken Shwarma wrap.

All of these really good eateries popped up in hatibagan as soon as i graduated from college, sadly :(
Been to this place quite a no of times now and i must say i love the taste! Their AC seating area is quite nice, staff is friendly and service is fast. I have an implicit craving for their Chicken Iranian Biriyani and especially for their preeminent Shawarma Wrap! The Shawarma Wrap,albeit huge, is extremely filling with all that yum mayo sauce! Overall, i like this place and would return for more!

Located near star theater in Hatibagan. Lebanese junction serves really good Lebanese food. The Menu doesn't contain many items. Sitting arrangement was nice. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Wrap. It was perfect in taste. It contains lots of Chicken and other veggies.

its the only shawarma destination I have come across in north kolkata but it does lack the punch of the shawarma rolls as we know it
It serves in less time and is efficient but the taste of the sauces and the chicken can be improved upon

Go for the mutton kabab shawarma wrap. Very meaty inside the pita bread wrap with the humus (sauce). Other items are also good and are cooked with almost no oil which is helpful for diet conscious people. And quite pocket friendly. Hope they reduce the prices so people like me can have multiple things there.

Just the few steps away from the age old landmark Star Theatre is the Lebanese Junction.
A medium shack ,that has a little 'sit around and chitchat' side, this is basically a take away centre. This joint has a limited yet famously known Lebanese tasties to offer that too at a pocket friendly price. 
Few days ago me and a friend visited this long-time-ago listed venue to try the Lebanese sauces and kebabs. We ordered for Lebanon Kay Kebab and Chicken Shawarma Wrap. The kebab comes with pita bread and a yogurt based dip. The chicken of the kebabs was tender and tasteful and the simple pita breads complimented the lightly spiced kebabs. The next is the wrap. The filling was tasty and heavy but a bit more sauce was used than should be normal. But the wrap tasted good. One wrap is filling for one.
The staffs were a bit lazy yet served the food quick.
A good place to satisfy light hunger within one's budget.

This is situated at hatibagan, more precisely near star theater. Tiny joint with few chairs but well known for their shawarmas at that area . i went there yesterday with few of my friends and ended up liking the food here. We ordered chicken shawarma salad and Lebanese chicken biriyani dish. Both were awesome, specially the shawarma salad which usually comes with pita bread and one plate is enough for two for 140bucks. Biriyani had aloo (boiled potato) and a generous piece of chicken with bone as it should be . quantity wise and quality wise good food without pinching a hole in your pocket. @Debalina

P. S. On my next visit i will like to have their chello kebab platter

During my wedding shopping me and my fiancee went there just to satisfy our hunger came from mind. So we tried chicken shawrma wrap and chicken chello kabab. Honestly speaking I fall in love with shwarma wrap. The filling is so perfect, so juicy. But compared to shwarma wrap, chello kabab was not up to the mark. But I am impressed with them and want to go there again and try other yummy dishes.

**Location = Hatibagan, just beside Star Theatre.

**Brief = Went there today with some friends after a movie at Star.

**Ambiance = They have inside seating capacity of around 20 people(many does not know about it). On the outside 5-6 chairs are available. The staff were helpful and cooperative.

**Things Tried = Chicken Shawarma Wraps,Grilled Chicken(Half),Chicken Biriyani,Paneer Shwarma Wrap.

The biriyani was light and made with really low oil content,the chicken piece was good and not too dry. 
Chicken shwarma was great, I have had tried it before and tasted okay today also.The filling inside was juicy and not dry to our liking.

The grilled chicken was fabulous.

But the Paneer Shwarma was not upto the mark. The paneer pieces were chewy and we did not like it.

**Recommended = Grilled Chicken,Chicken Shawarma, Chicken Biriyani.

**Purse Check = We spent Rs.830/- total. iwould say Rs.300/- for 2 people would be good.

**Overall = Definitely would go back for more. Cheers.

Went there yesterday to fulfill my sudden extreme craving for shawarma rolls!! The menu card had a number of dishes including kebabs along with the Lebanese items. Well I ordered for a chicken shawarma wrap. And I simply loved it. Big sized roll with the overflowing fillings was delicious and one of the best I've ever had. Undoubtedly, Prices are apt for what they serve. My only request is to make the sitting arrangement a li'l bit less complicated with stable chairs! Otherwise this place is a perfect Lebanese food joint.

Situated close to the star theatre this shop is pretty small but not to an extent where you will feel uncomfortable. It has some nice chairs and a long stretch of an extension from the wall serving as a table. The food I'd say is good,i liked the chicken wings and the sauce but shawarma was not up to the mark,although not bad.
Its easy on the pockets so you might just drop by to grab a bite.

Now-a-days,Kolkatan's palate is getting adapted to world cuisine.Amongst that,Lebanese cuisine is quite famous for it's taste.Lebanese cuisine is a boon for health conscious people,as it is mainly prepared in olive-oil and light on stomach.

Lebanese junction is one of the restros,catering this delicacy to the people of north-kolkata.

LOCATION:-Situated conveniently at the four point crossing of Hatibagan junction.For those who are new to this place,this is situated in the same footpath of 'STAR THEATRE'(in the same line).

AMBIANCE:-Been to this place in the evening of Bijayadashami ,this year.Being anewly opened place,this was quite empty at 6 pm in the evening.This restaurant has two sections,one ac and other is non-ac.As we were in amood for light snacking,we opted for non-ac section.The place seemed to clean.Seating capacity 15-17 people at a time.It housed stools and high chairs in vibrant colurs.

SERVICE:-First of all,non ac section is a self service section.But the cooks were a bit laidback at that moment.So serving time is a bit more in comparison to other lebanese restros.

FOOD:-We ordered for
'Lebanese shish tauk'/chicken kebab less spicy.It was served piping hot,bt the chicken chunks felt a bit chewy.But the pieces were coated lightly with spices and crushed black pepper,with right amount of hotness.There were 5 boneless pieces of chicken,served with pita bread and hummus.A wholesome meal for one person,but me and my friend was quite full after lunch,so we happily shared a plate.

VALUE FOR MONEY:-It was avalue for money place.The plate of shish tauk is priced at 150/-.A student friendly place.

Con:-the cooking area is not properly covered,sometimes itz not possible to withstand the smell while meat is cooked.
Apart from this,it is a place one can surely visit for lebanese cuisine.

The place is easily accesible being on the ever popular Hatibagan Junction. The place adds a fresh flavour as it differs from the regular eateries that are available there. The place has grilled and char grilled chicken and fish items.  

The Shwarmas are a must have. The grilled chicken tandoori and the fish tikka s are a delight.... 
They have pretty decent pita bread and the humus is better than you would expect.

The location is just opposite to Leatherworld . Tried out three dishes over here:-

1. Chicken Shawarma Wrap (2/5) - This was an okay for me, as am not much of a Tartar sauce fan. The chicken was the only thing that I loved about the dish.

2. Mutton Kebab wrap (2/5) - This one is almost same as the Chicken Shawarma Wrap. The mutton is minced a bit like keema, and added to the pita bread with some onions and tartar sauce.

3. Grilled Chicken - Full(5/5) - Yep, you saw that right. This is one of the best grilled chicken cooked over here(Shyambazar to Hedua stretch). Look closely and you will see that the chicken is cooked with the skin, which makes the dish a lot more tastier. The meat throughout is tender and juicy as well. The quantity is more than enough for three to four people as an evening snack.Highly recommended.

Me and my sister suddenly decided to go to lebabese junction to try something different from the regular indian and chinese. We ordered Chicken Shawarma Salad and a Mutton Kebab Wrap. The total bill came out to be arround Rs.290 which is quite pocket friendly. One has to serve herself/himself. The Shawarma Salad was a wholesome, complete, healthy delecacy which serves two well enough. The Kebab wrap, on the other hand was not upto the mark. The Kebab used wa@s much harder than it should be. Nd otherwise it consisted of a huge gulp of mayonese and lots of onions would make u repulse(untill u enjoy giving out bad breathe to others and irritate them)! Suggestons would be to use less onions and other vegetables as well. Otherwise you would enjoy coming here for once atleast if not regularly. Do the small improvement to get the whole rating. Now i rate it 4.

Situated at the crossing of hatibagan. They are having two types of seattting arrangement. You can seat on the outside seating arrangement or can choose ac dine in. Ordered chicken swarma wrap, paneer swarma with vegetables, chelo kebab and mutton biriyani. Though the food quantity was good not the quality. Royal lebanese is much better than this junction. Don't try their biriyani and chelo kebab.

Suddenly we see loads of Lebanese food joints all over the city n the only thing they copied properly was how to make a good shawarma. This is another such place. Other than that rest of the items are pretty poor in quality,specially the chicken wings. Better try out golbarir mangsho if you are hungry n around hatibagan at the same time.

The Shawarma is really awesome here and one is enough to keep ur stomach filled up for quite sometime. However, the owner suggested us to try the Grilled chicken which was really a bad choice.  The chicken was too big, stiff and not cooked fully. Only the outer skin had the flavour and the rest of it simply tasted like boiled chicken. Its a strict no no for all.

This one is located beside Star Theatre. There's a seating area facing the street, and AC accommodations, though I haven't availed that because I was getting take away. I ordered four chicken shawarma rolls and Iranian Chello kabab. The billing for my family of four came to ₹550 , which is pretty much reasonable.

The Shawarma wraps were perfect. For the last two Lebanese restaurants I visited, something seemed like it was missing, and it was the amount of spice added to the wrap. 

The kabab should've come in a bigger size, but they tasting juicy and wonderful. Not at all dry.  

We asked about home delivery and they said that it was chargeable and above ₹900-1000 it was free, which seemed like a bit much because we'd hardly rack up a bill that high for four people, and when the same bill we ordered was coming for free from another competition a stone's throw away.

Overall great experience, ambience is great while we were waiting for the food. Going to go there next time to try the seating area when possible.

The store is the situated at a very busy junction namely hatibagan more. It boasts itself due to its healthy preparations and in many of the preparations they have written that they use olive oil's for cooking. Lets talk about the ambience of the restaurant. It is good for a quick grab midst of shopping, but not good for a dedicated dinner. However, we did not try any Lebanese foods which must be good. We tried mutton biriyani and chello kebab, which turns out to be extremely bad. The ac seating area inside the restaurant is also looks deserted. Overall it may be good for some snacks or a quick bite bot not at all recommended for a full dinner and also don't even try there mughlai cuisine.

I live in Bangalore so whenever in Kolkata, I indulge in all varieties of food. Last evening, walked down to this place and tried the Chicken Shawarma wrap. Unfortunately, couldn't see the making of it. The appearance was alright however, the chutney was runny and tarnished the aesthetics. There were capsicum pieces in the wrap which didn't go very well with rest of the mix. The sauce was creamy and captivating. The wrap was cold though, and I thought it should have been freshly baked and hot. The taste of chutney was not in sync with rest of the goods. Overall, a good experience here

Really great food n extremely pocket friendly for a group outing. I've been here a couple of times n ordered quite a variety of food n I'd say I loved it. Not only the swarma wrap, the swarma salad is also quite filling, served in a greasy vinigerette n ample amount of pita bread. The chicken wings together with the dip can beat a dish of dry fried chicken anyday. And the grilled chicken, served whole or half, is tender and meaty, full of spices. Such good amount of good quality non veg for such a price is really hard to find these days. So I'd say it's a pretty great place to try out.

I think it was a pretty nice experience visiting this petit restaurant. It was my second visit and I was again happy with the quality of food. Every one must try the shawarma salad. Just yummy! I plan to visit it more often though its pretty far from my place.

Spoiler Alert !!!! 
We ordered mutton biriyani and chicken grill. Chicken grill was not cooked properly and we had to send it back to grill again, they fried and send it back. 
I don't call that biriyani, cooked in olive oil is just a fad. Who eats biriyani as an healthy food? Scores 1/10 on taste. Extremely disappointing considering Aminia and arselan in the vicinity. Strictly not recommended.

Lebanese Junction has always been one of my favourite food joints... Great service, delicious food and amazingly cheap rates. The shawarma salad is simply awesome, served with lots of chicken chunks and fresh veggies. The seating arrangement could have been a lil better... But all over it's a must visit.

Latest Lebanese outlet in this area. Newly opened food joint.  The location of this outlet might just help them in their business. Prices are comparatively cheaper.  Hope they maintain the quality.  Food served was good.  People running  the joint are very good and polite.  This joint is surely going to win hearts by the Lebanese food.

Although this restaurant specializes in Lebanese cuisine we opted for the whole grilled chicken full & pita breads.
We opted for takeaway (350) so can't comment about dine-in (410). Well the chicken weighs about 1.1-1.2 kg, so quantity is ample. They cut it in 8 large pcs. So its value for money compared to many chains offering of the same thing in so called 'baskets'. It was juicy & not at all spicy. However the raita they provide as a condiment is a total disaster. I'd rather prefer tomato ketchup. & the pita bread was not up to the mark. However the chicken is definitely value for money. The owner is courteous. Will visit again.

This is a small Lebanese outlet just beside star theatre. It was an unplanned visit after college hours when my friend was craving for Lebanese and this was the nearest Lebanese eatery. 

The seating space is very small. We ordered chicken shawarma wrap. It is priced at 100 bucks which is quite pocket friendly. The size was good enough and it was very tasty. The mayonese was added in a good amount and there were also good portions of veggies and chicken. It can easily suffice the hunger of one person. I would also try other items from their menu next time

This one is right on the hatibagan crossing...quite a spacious joint for some lebanese delight. The sawarma wraps and kebabs are good, healthy and not so expensive. Try this place and you will not be disappointed at all.
editing my previous review because today  the food that i had from here is not worth a previous good rating. the sawarma chicken wraps that were delivered were cold and the Lebanese shiah tawook was hard and cheewy. not at all satisfied with the food this time.

The shawarma salad was good with a mix of tango amd spicy taste. A bit more chicken would have been appriciated. The pita bread was soft, overall a nice combination. 
The grilled chicken was not actually grilled, but fried. A better taste was expected, the sauce was minty and good. 
The place is very convenient to reach. Ambience is nice.

umm being well accustomed with Lebanese food, the taste was not a surprise.
we ordered chicken wings, swarma salad, and a grilled chicken ( half) !! and man, what a feast it was! we were too full to move! the quality of chicken is very satisfactory, loved the vegetables in the salad just the perfect amount, the breads were soft, grilled chicken was minimum greasy!!  though the place has space crunch, the sitting arrangement is not satisfactory, and on hot humid days its just awefull with the inner ac section under maintenance, though the food did justice!! love it!

I was an avid fan of this Lebanese joint since its inception. I had even introduced many of my friends to the delightful experience this restaurant used to provide. However since the past six months the food quality has steadily declined.The kebabs have been turning drier by each passing day. The shwarmas were loosing their charm. Today I had the worst ever food experience at this place.I ordered a falafel wrap and what I was handed over from the counter was nothing like a falafel. When I gave my first bite I realized what I was having was a veg roll with onions and cucumber and some veg "pur" from my "para" shop except for the fact that I paid a handsome ₹110 for this so called exotic Lebanese food!
Seriously guys, do something. I don't want to loose a favourite.

This Lebanese junction has nothing good to serve people ... seating arrangement is horrible very less seats are provided outside.. if its full u either have to pack u foods or have to stand holding chairs for your turn and they charge extra for AC dining...
Swarma roll is not what u get in other Lebanese junction its of poor quality ... chicken salad is not fresh had twice and got same bad quality.. tandoori is never cooked properly..
Behaviour of the owner (I guess the person who handles the cash) is very rude. If u seat for lil long with foods with friends he makes sure to drive u out ... ridiculous!!
Quality of food needed tobe improve more and so as the owners behaviour towards customer.

Grabbing a bite after a show at Star Theatre is kind of a custom for me, and this place located just beside it has been its beneficiary. On enquiring, they disclosed that Humus Nashib & Pita Bread and Chicken Shawarma Wrap were their speciality. Settling for the Shawarma Wrap, I found it very dull, to be bluntly honest I have had better. The core demanded better seasoning and cooking, plus the pita bread seemed dry. They need to get their act together if they wish to construct a reputation in the growing Lebanese Cuisine market.

My experience in this outlet is horrible and annoying!! Located just at the Haatibagan crossing this Lebanese joint I thought would be an instant hit. But thanks to the bunch of lazy people working there who literally makes the customer's life difficult. 

It was a Sunday afternoon, I went out with a friend and God knows why I zeroed on this outlet. We decided to order Shawarma Wrap and Shish Tawook. They said Shish Tawook is not available. The Shish Tawook or Lebanese kebabs happens to be a signature Lebanese dish, whose unavailability left us surprised. Then we ordered two Shawarma Wraps. The cashier was plain arrogant and uncourteous. 

After 20 mins wait the wraps arrived. Presentation wise its very plain. We had a hard time to search the chicken pieces in the mayonnaise pool inside the wrap. Frankly speaking I had better Shawarma Wraps at Royal Lebanese. 
 
The Cons:
Small place, lethargic service, arrogant cashier, absolutely no ambiance as such, extra charge for AC sitting (left me speechless actually) and 'nothing to talk about' food. 

The Pros:
There's no pros. There's only cons. Sigh I can't rate them less than 1.  

Possibility of future visit : A strict NO.

Well this outlet is located just in the corner of the hatibagan crossing beside star theatre. When their is less seats available to seat in the outlet outside area ,they have charged you to seat in ac room. And they will only allow to enter in the ac area once you pay the bill first. Another drawback they didn't accept cards with billing amount lesser than ₹300 and if you provide credit card they will ask to charge for additional 2% despite of the billing amount. Common. Are you guys opening your restaurant in the Kolkata or in some village or rural area???????

Now if you come to the food, there is nothing to enjoy also. we had ordered Chicken tandoori in Lebanese style & chicken Shwarma  roll. 

Chicken Sharma roll were just ordinary & I had better Shwarma  roll earlier in Kolkata. 

Chicken tandoori is a disaster they had served that day. The chicken was of poor quality & not at all well cooked. It tastes like boiled chicken without any masala into it. Even the skin of the chicken were not removed & the blood were visible near the bones of the chicken. We hadn't eat it & complained but got reply from them its absolutely fine & they are serving it like this. I have decided not to visit this outlet for a single time in the near future. 

YOU SHOULD BETTER AVOID TO ORDER CHICKEN TANDOORI IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO VISIT THIS OUTLET SOON.

I also tried the shawarma wrap and it tastes on par with that of royal lebanese. Long story short, you can definitely come here if u plan to go for some shopping in Hatibagan and have an apetite for lebanese.

We wanted to try some Shawarma and  thought we were at the right place. Ordered a salad for takeaway. Then started the wait. We were almost kept waiting for 30 mins. It was odd that other customers coming after us managed to get theirs! It took 30 more minutes to finally reach home and open the pack. They had given breads which was a kind of new. At the same time I was surprised by the sad amount of chicken in it. It wasn't expected at such a price and wait.

I had called in to place an order from my place which is 15 mins walk from this place.  They first told me that the order needs to be at least rs. 500 and that the delivery will be costing me rs. 100 even if its above rs. 500. I told the person on the phone that how can someone tell me a maximum order and also charge a delivery. Moreover the to come to my place, it will be costing him not more than rs. 10 in an auto. The person did not have any answer and kept on saying that it is their rule. I also told him that this way they are robbing customers but it fell on deaf ears.

A lot of Middle Eastern food joints have been popping up in Kolkata in the recent past. Lebanese Junction is located just at the Hatibagan crossing, a nice busy spot for attracting customers. The first thing that catches your eye is the big chunk of meat roasting at the window. I had visited the place with a couple of friends a while ago. It offers non AC as well as AC dining, the latter costing a bit more. The heat being intolerable, we didn't mind the extra bucks. The lack of any decor in the dining space is eye-catching in a way. With the plastic chairs surrounding plastic tables, it reminded us of a college canteen kind of setting.
Coming to the food itself., the spiced chicken wings we had for starters was packed full of flavour, with garlic and oregano, but it was disappointingly overcooked. The accompanying garlic dip, however, was delicious and made us go back again and again for more. 

The Shawarma salad was easily the best dish we had. With pieces of grilled chicken, loads of veggies and a tangy creamy dressing to bring it together, it tasted delicious with the soft pita breads. Would have liked the pita bread to have had their stereotypical pocket to stuff the salad into, but we really didn't care.

Finally we had the Iranian Chelo Kabab. The dish was absolutely delicious, but the spices in the kababs made it a bit overwhelming and the amount of rice on the dish was far less compared to the kababs. 

Overall, I liked the place. The service is prompt and the pricing is decent. The Shawarma salad will make me go back for a second time, I am sure.

This is a small outlet... easy to locate as it's in the junction of hatibagan. 
Not much of ambience, 
The guys are little slow in their service, 
The shwarma wrap is good enough for two ppl.
Clenliness is average.

A good place to have your fill of Lebanese cuisine. I usually have the shawarma. I have been here many a time. The shawarma is better than anywhere else in the city. The chelo kebab however could have been better. But still it does justice. The service is quick, amount is generous in that price. There should be more sitting arrangements. If you are a chicken or meat lover, visit the place
                    
The place now has even more to offer than before after the revamp. Tried minced mutton steak, which was decent. The meatball tasted exactly the same however, only shaped differently.

I had here Sawarma and Wrap. I should admit that both were too tasty. Specially that Sawarma. I crave for sawarma always, so this is the right place for me. The place is small but very clean. Service and behavior of the staffs are very good. Who like some spicy and Lebanese food, he/she should visit this place, at least for once.

I went yester day and orderd chello kabab .

And after some time they gave me a dish .

Where five pieces of chello kabab were their , but no egg , i asked them why there is no egg ? They said in authentic iranian chello kabab there is no egg , what you ate is not iranian version and that was indian version . I started to eat believe me there were no egg no butter no nothing only rice and five kababs . The rice was burnt out .

   It costs 220rs . That hurts . I have had chello kabab before but  those were not like this one . Waste of money . 

  I do not want to go their  any more .

The Quality of food is good.

But the overall experience depends on the ambiance, Behavior of staffs, the quality of communication form the host. All of the above is missing in this restaurant.

The rate chart is also confusing and different for AC/ NON AC.. and the owner gets irritated if you ask about the details of the menu.

The proprietor did not do justice to the place. The location is super in north kolkata.. the land area is more than sufficient to make run a full fledged dine in restaurant. The joint is like any other snacks corner in the city.. ill decorated!!  They have tables chairs a.c. wash basin then why not a minimalistic decoration!?  They charge extra for a.c.  dining in this century!  Lol. And wiith that extra amount of money you will be given 'pure a.c.' on entering the misfitting slider door, and removing a transparent sheet of plastic used as a curtain.. you will get to see the plastic chairs are dumped one over the other.. arrange yourself.. N yes,  did i forget to mention?  They dont allow you to get in the a.c room till you order and pay the money outside. Huh!  This place is still running in a metropolitan.. strange!

The food however,  i felt was on the better side, comparable to the other famed lebanese street joints. We had shawarma salad with extra pita and extra tartar sauce. Though the a.c.  menu it was so overpriced, thankfully tasted well. The servers serve you the food over the counter.. which is a small window like slit in the wall with a sliding shutter. The pitas are really heavy here. 
N they even have a cc footage set up..  which most of the staff keep on gazing for their timepass.. so weirdly!

my tryst with Lebanese food and o boy ........i loved it!
its minimalist design and instant service is just adorable!
The menu is well a "card "( literally )and not an "encyclopaedia"( thankfully)
With limited options but good food at a really affordable price!
The shawarma was lovely . So was the humus with pita bread.
I was eying the  Iranian chello kebab that a lady was getting packed ....and finally giving way to my gastronomic desires even i ordered for one...and it was beautiful
The main problems are two.
1. the sitting capacity is really less , so at times if u come with ur friends u may have to wait or get the food packed.
2. There's a certain monotony in the taste. It's like "u taste one u taste all"
Good for trying a different flavour....!!!!

A very casual Lebanese joint. Cooped up in hatibagan, contrary to many joints, this one served some healthy Lebanese. Their food is cooked in olive oil. Rejoice!

Ambiance:
Nothing great to talk about really. A very casual place which isn't air conditioned. They have a bar counter-ish seating.

Food:
Their shawarmas are super delicious. I do not like shawarmas, but this one I did. It had just the right amount of chicken and mayo. Very palatable and filling. The chello kebabs are tasty. 6 seekh kebabs are served with a portion of biryani rice.

All in all deliciously light food is served.

Service:
The staff is polite and well-mannered. Service is quick! And the food doesn't pinch your pockets.

My dad, always delightful to serve me something cool and trending, brought home a plate of chicken arabian biryani and grilled chicken, on my last visit to home. He was so full of radiance and joy, that I thought he discovered something. Nevertheless, the food was amazing, must say, and biryani was quite nice. It was quite a good change of the taste buds. The cost is not at all pocket friendly and is nice once or twice in a month. Located almost around the corner, there is no parking place, which makes it not so good hangout place. It is a good place to have a quick snack, not to chit chat and have food. Overall good food.

The best thing about this lebanese joint is that they indulge in true lebanese style cooking methods, which is impressive.Coming to the food, the chicken shawarma wrap is a delight, although a bit spicy going by the lebanese standards.The Iranian chello kebabs were not so bad, the chicken pieces being well-cooked and good in proportion.But what seemed to be the downside of this dish was it's excessive dryness.Another issue with this place seems to be the non-availability of any drinks.Going by the standard of their spicy flavors, they ought to keep a drinks section at hand, otherwise the entire experience of eating out becomes a pain, especially during the summer months.The seating area should definitely be upgraded.Overall, a nice little lebanese joint in the neighborhood that offers it's customers their money's worth.

Good location. . .  At the main crossing of Hatibagan, you can find out easily. .

Good food. .  and healthy as well. . . because they cook only in olive oil, so that it takes care of your diet also . . .

and . . .

Cost like pocket friendly . . . not so cheap, but according to the foods price are standard. . .

that's all . . .  nothing much to say . . .
one suggestion. . . 
you should give a try to  the - "Arabian Biriyani" & "Lebanan Kay Kebab" . . .

Previously when it came to Hatibagan, the only food joints we could think of, were the- Pizza Hut, KFC and Some old-legendary cabin restaurants. Lebanese Junction happened to be discovered in an abrupt way, as we were a total dilettante to Lebanese eatery.
The ambiance was very neighborly. Till now we had
Schwarma wraps multiple times- which is a must have if you want to treat your taste-buds. The Chicken Wings with the taratur sauce is like heaven inside your mouth. We had Biryanis there and many more, but somehow I felt the Tawook Kebab there, a bit tasteless, or a bit unfamiliar to my taste-buds. I think, the way the outlet is gaining popularity they need an immediate increase in the number of chairs.
The price is reasonable. 
One thing I'd like to add at the end- they should have an arrangement for soft-drinks or beverages. i guess it may offer a great combination with the type of food they serve there.

I went today with couple of friends. It was pre planned to have swarma wrap!
The hotel is kind of street shop,no ac.
So was disappointed at very first!
We ordered,it didn't take much time,but I must say,this is not the exact swarma,it's a very very simplified version.
So not happy,I wouldn't recommend others to go,but swarma @ 100 bucks,that may be the only reason to go there !

Well, I was aware of the restaurant but didnot get a chance to visit it. Space seemed quite small but intelligently managed. I ordered the Chicken Biriyani which was said to be cooked with olive oil. The oil definitely altered the taste of the biriyani but prevented it from sticking when cold as in case of dalda. I loved the taste, the smell was also unsusual. I enjoyed the food. Thumbs up, going again today.

During my stay in Europe, Durum or Doner Kebab was one of our favourite choices which you can find anywhere around Europe but it was missing here in Kolkata. Then suddenly from last year, we found few Kebab Corners around. We tried few and yesterday we went Lebanese Junction which according to me d'best one around north/central Kolkata. We oredered chicken shawarma wrap nd shawarma salad. You can almost feel the actual Lebanese flavors but some extra white sauce you also see. But overall good.
Only concern I found about the restaurant - place was bit suffocating as no separation between d'kitchen nd restaurant place so you feel d'spice before you have it. And one think I really didn't like was - there was a separate place with some round tables where peacefully you can have your food ( even non-ac) but you have to place order for at least 300. For 2 people, it's difficult to place order of 300 or more and no clod drinks or package drinking waters available.
Other than this overall bit impressive and a place to revisit.

Some delightful way to satisfy yourself by offering a Lebanese dish to yourself. 
Like it or not but the food of the place is quite outstanding. 
The place is clean.
Quite specious.
The amount of the food is good. 
Sometimes its hard to take a step inside cause at the pick hour you have to be in the waiting list. 
You know we live to eat and if this kind of delicious food is served to you it be quite precious for you to accept.
To all the people in the North, do visit this place and eat of course.
What else shall I say to a delicious food Junction..

Went to this restaurant with my partner couple of days ago. The restaurant is located at the crossing of Hatibagan and beside the Star theatre. We ordered Full chicken roast without oil and we were amazed to see the quantity of the dish as they served the whole chicken. In spit of the enormous size, the chicken was perfectly cooked and was very juicy. They served the roasted chicken with some white sauce which was also testy. You can also bring cold beverages from outside which is good. Overall it's a nice experience and if you want to try good food without oil then this place Is a must go.

Kolkata is being flooded with Lebanese joints off late with most being pretty disappointing and LJ is no exception to that.

Located at hatibagan crossing, the restaurant is huge and easy to locate. The inside is pretty spacious, clean and well lit which is appreciable. The service is fast and staff try to be warm.

Howevr food is what is most important and this place does not cut ice in this aspect. I tried the falafal wrap and it was literally tasteless. The quality of ingredients is good but falafal itself was bad and bland. The wrap was overloaded with mayo like most of the new joints and I missed hummus. The size of wrap is huge, but what's the point of it without the taste !!!

Well,when it comes to 'lebanese' cuisine,its always me ahead of everyone sticking my foot,tongue everything out first! Be it go lebanese,royal lebanese,shawarma nation,each and every spot has been on my good books. So today..suddenly noticed this place on the right hand side while travelling in the tram towards shyambazar. Immedietly decided to drop in. This place is a small eatery with very few chairs placed in a single row adjacent to a big table. The kitchen is visible from outside and you can see people cutting out big chunks of meat for preparing the dishes. Well today being a sunday and lebanese junction being the only lebanese food joint in the area,it was really crowded and due to its narrow area it was difficult for people to even wait inside. We placed our order....1 shawarma salad,took the bill and decided to wait outside. This place is a non air-conditioned joint but the ceiling fans were doing just fine. When the place got a little empty we went inside. We managed 2 seats for ourselves....got comfortably seated. We noticed a sliding door,inside there were big round tables with 4-5chairs each. We saw the manager forbid 1 couple to sit there inside because for sitting there one needed to order for rs 300 or above. This thing seemed a little absurd to me...without preparing special places for greater billings,they could have just expanded the area and could have made the same arrangements for everyone. This is the only reason why i deducted 1 mark from here.
We were provided a bill number and were called when our order was ready. Its a self service joint. We received our order of a large plate of shawarma salad with 6 pita breads. The shawarma has always been my choice in any lebanese restaurant. It was perfectly made with the right amount of mayonnaise and stuff and utterly large delicious chunks of chicken meat. I savoured my each and every bite of the shawarma which was perfectly matched with the pita bread. 1 plate filled up both of us.
Overall,i liked lebanese junction a lot...small place with excellent food,clean environment. Eager to visit again for the chelo kebabs!:-)

But grilled chicken was horrible, it was way over cooked - burnt.

This is the 3rd Lebanese joint I've visited in a month. Much better than Ma.Ma Lebanese. I went there at 12:30 pm and stayed there for an hour. Most other people get takeaway but I chose to dine-in as I was really hungry. 
The service was quick enough, they prepared the two chicken shawarma wraps and chicken shawarma salad in just 10-12 minutes. The other places I've been to take a little longer. 
The quality and quantity was appreciable. I loved the wraps here better, much better than Ma.Ma's. 
If I wasn't so hungry, just one wrap would've been enough to fill me up. 
Their pita breads could be a little softer. Loved the salad. They put more sauce in the wraps as compared to the salad. But everything was fresh and fine. 
Would definitely visit again and recommend it to anyone who loves shawarma.

We went to shyambazar today to go to mitra cafe but it being closed(zomato's wrong information about its timing :() we took a tram to hatibagan and there it was! Lebanese junction..being afternoon(around 3), it was almost empty. Sitting arrangement is actually not very good(read:comfortable),I liked their  basin btw.. its nice :)After having shawarma at ma.ma's I have fallen in love with it. So the 1st thing we ordered was chicken shawarma wrap. It was good but still not as good as that of ma.ma's.. The mayo was garlic flavoured and I am not very fond of garlic so the very 1st bite put me a bit off. But the wrap was good. Sufficient amount of chicken earned it extra points! Next we went for chicken arabian biriyani which I didnot like at all. It was dry and like any biriyani available anywhere else. Amount was more than enough for 2 people after we had had the wrap. Service was fast in both the cases. They can definitely improve their plates and cutlery and decor too. A plain white plate just doesn't go with Lebanese junction's image where even the cooks and their helpers are wearing bright yellow clothes!

This food joint attracts me every time I pass by it. The items are unique and quite cheap and great for snacking on. And most importantly this diner fills the gap between street food counters and proper, sophisticated restaurants. It is costlier than the street food joints but cheaper than Bar-B-Q or Trincas. So it attratcs a lot of people (especially students) who avoid eating at street food stalls but at the same time don't want to spend a lot.

Shawarma (the minced chicken) wrap is JAYYID JIDDAN (simply awesome). Whenever you head off to SHOPPING and feel the RATATOUILLE crying inside your stomach go and get a BIG BITE of the LEBANON SPECIAL PITA WRAP (shawarma). And you would feel all ARABIC.

I like the ambience there and the food as well. Till now I have tasted 3 items from the menu, viz Chicken Shawarma Wrap, Iranian Chelo Kebab and Chicken Wings.  Wraps here are awesome to taste. The Iranian dish though looked smaller in quantity compared to the price, yet when I finally finished it, I realised it was more than enough. Chicken Wings were fine too, not like those of Kfc ones, but definitely tastes good. It has an unique name (Jawaneh Djaj).  :D I specially liked the dip that came with the wings. Would like to visit again n again.

One of the pros of this place is definitely its location. It is situated just at the four point crossing of hatibagan opposite to leather world and beside star theatre. The well lit place and the bright signboard are bound to catch ur attention if you pass through hatibagan. I have been to this place quite a number of times and my reaction concerning their food is a mixed one. There is nothing worth mentioning the decor of lebanese junction in particular. It's a neat n clean place with simple high chairs and a long strech of table for dining. There is however another additional area particularly set for dining inside the restaurant,however I have seen it closed most of the time. Being a lebanese food joint,the food review must start with the signature lebanese dish. The 'shawarma' - both roll and salad served here are really yummy and juicy. On one occasion I had the shawarma after 3hours and to my surprise I found that the food didn't lack any taste and it did not turn soggy and bland. Thumbs up to the joint for serving such good standard of food. The shawarma salad is served with 8 pieces of pita bread and can be easily shared by two people. It is almost impossible for a single person to finish the dish all by themself at one go. The dish is quite tasty though I feel they have overdone it a little by adding more veggies and more mayonaisse than required. My other favourite dish of this restaurant is their grilled chicken. This is a must order dish from my side whenever I visit this place. The chickens are grilled perfectly on the outside ,tender n moist on the inside. However during my last visit with my friends we decided on trying something different. Though I stuck to my good old shawarma roll my friends tried the iranian chelo kabab and the lebanese shish tawook. I had a taste of both the dishes and the lebanese tawook was a delight. It had chunks of chicken marinated with oregano which was grilled to optimum and was delightfully delicious. The humus and pita bread served along with it complimented the dish perfectly. We enjoyed this dish thouroughly. However the iranian chelo kabab was a big let down. Both the rice and the chicken(shaped in satay way) were extremely dry and we disliked this dish immediately. Both my friends had to order additional raita to gulp it down. The dish was bland and we regretted our decision of ordeing it big time. However the place can't be judged just because of a single dish and there's no denying the fact that the other dishes I have tried here had always been tasty and yummy.The place is extremely pocket friendly and economic compared to the food served. Some food are very well prepared and tastes yummilaceous and others need to be imrpovised on. But this place is a must visit for shawarma lovers,and being an ardent one,I love visiting this place again and again.

I have had better Shawarma wraps. What I liked about the place is the service. It was fast. Seating is limited but at odd hours it's more than enough. Also, I forgot my phone there. When I returned to get it 15 minutes later, I found it at the counter. Gotta give them some credit for that.

One of the best Lebanese joints that I have eaten at and you cannot miss out on this one. Located just beside Star Theatre, it attracts your attention even if you are just passing by. The food is very good and easy on the pocket as well. The Chicken Shawarma Roll I had here was delicious and had a generous filling of fresh vegetables, chicken chunks and mayonnaise. I would certainly recommend Lebanese Junction as a great place to try out Lebanese cuisine.

A great place to go and eat if u are a shawarma lover. The service is fast. DO try the shawarma wrap,grilled chicken and the chicken wings....they are just lip-smacking. 
The only two things are there is no soft drinks available vch becomes a necessity sometimes...TRUST Me...and also the sitting arrangement cud hv been a lil better.
BUT overall if u go for the food ...its a great place to hang out wth ur frnds.
And the TARTAR sauce is just to DIE FOR !!!!!! :) :)

Ok, the review is totally based on the food. Its not a fine dining  restaurant. It can be just considered a roll counter with a few seating arrangements.I just have been there a couple of times, so haven't had the chance of tasting all the food. I had the chicken schawarma wrap,which was just mindbogglingly good. The pita bread was soft and fresh,and the chicken from the rotisserie is nonparallel. The chicken was tender and juicy, and nicely cooked. It's definitely not for the health conscious as the wrap is filled with lots and lots of mayo. On a separate occasion, i had the biryani and the grilled chicken. One thing I would like to add is that the guy there was really friendly and nice. He recognized me from my earlier visit, and he kind of insisted on me taking the grilled chicken.And i was really happy i listened to him. Its one of the best grilled chicken i ever had. Well the biryani was nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely a tad different from the biryani we are used to at kolkata. Maybe its beause of the olive oil that they say the biryani is cooked with.But the portion is quite good.

I had come here for a friend's birthday treat, and this place is actually pretty damn good. The seating arrangements, honestly are a problem for large groups to come in with all the round tables and everything and there's always a bit of the noise from outside coming in, but the food sort of makes up for all that.
The shawarma here is amazing to say the very least, and I've been to too many Lebanese joints to say otherwise. The grilled chicken was a bit undercooked to be honest on one side, but it didn't spoil the overall flavour.
We had a bit of the falafel sandwich from our veg-friends, and it tasted good as well.

Give this a try if you're in the mood for something Beirut-y.

This place is located exactly at hatibagan crossing and is an open eatery resembling a sophisticated roll stall ! The first thing that catches one's attention is the famous shawarma chicken rotisserie that is totally inviting !! Walking in , the revolving seats are accompanied by a cute little basin and napkins for use. The interiors are neat looking and perfect for an adda for two . But the space is not adequate for a large group to sit and enjoy their food . Speaking of food , the chicken shawarma wrap is heavenly ! So grab your shawarma wrap and adda on ! ;)

Went there for some evening snacks after a good review from one of my friends. 
However, bad place to dine at is my current opinion. 
First we talk of the ambiance. It was just decent with more stress given on the take aways. A couple of chairs were available for diners and were allowed into the main dining area if, and only if, the bill amount was above rs.300/-. We mad esure the bill amt was above 300/- but were disappointed when we went inside. It had shabby plastic furniture with no water, since it was a self help joint. Had to go out to get even a glass of water.
Coming to the service. Service is self help kind cos apparently they are busy doing nothing and thus cant serve you. Also the order took 30mins to be prepared though the order included biriyani. Also no help provided to choose from the menu even though the food items were weirdly named. Also, the bill is to be paid upfront but they wont accept cards if the bill amt is less than 300/-.
Coming to the most important thing ie the food. Had heard of good mutton biriyani being served and hence had visited the spot. But it was bad with just some basic rice with a piece of half cooked mutton. We had to leave it half eaten. The ither item ordered was chello kabab. Believe me, its the worst you can have. 
I'd prefer being hungry than eating at such a place.

Ambience- a moderate joint to sit and eat. Nothing extraordinary.
Food- we ordered 2 swarma wraps and a pita bread with humus. The swarma wrap was yummy. Pita bread was soft Full of mayo veggies and chunks of chicken. I liked the green chutney that they serve with it. Humus was a bit dry fr me. Bt i liked it.
Service- was quick and and people were well behaved.
Pocket pinch- we paid 310 for the order.
Surely in my revisiting list..

This junction is located at the Hatibagan Junction just beside Star Theater….We were very hungry after watching a cinema and had gone for eating here…

The décor of the junction is great…The red high stool looks great..The hygiene of this place is great…

We had ordered Shawarma Wraps and Iranian Chello Kabab…

The wraps  were well made..but the chicken were a bit stale..but the vegetables and the mayo made up…

The chello kabab was well made though the kabab was very aromatic and spicy…The rice was perfect in taste..

Overall the junction is junction is a good place of Lebanese food lovers…The price is very competitive…the junction is very hard to miss with its bright colours and lights…

A small cozy haven for lebanese food. Ambience wise it is best for college groups and small groups who want to enjoy good and tasty food at a reasonable rate.

The staff seems to be helpful, although nothing much to help with as it is a self service joint. 

Coming to the food. It is very tasty and healthy as oil used is minimum. Must try Chicken Shawarma, Grilled Chicken and Arabian Biriyani.

In short, give it a shot. You will like it.

I went back to the joint and tried Koresh Te Leham (Mutton) with Pita bread. All bongs are hereby requested to give it a shot. It is a definite throwback to our good old Mutton Curry Sundays with a very soft and tasty twist. Also had the Shwarma Salad and must say is a delight for all White Sauce lovers !!!!. In short, food rocks here !!!!!!!!!!!!

If one is in hatibagan one can never overlook this place as it is a very brightly lit place. Tried their food a few days back and in short really liked it. All of our friends had a small party and decided to eat Lebanese cuisine. So we ordered 6 chicken shawarma wrap and 1 plate full grilled chicken. I was quite impressed with the wrap as it had ample amount of sauce, veggies, chicken and i ate my wrap after a long time but even then i enjoyed it because i found that the wrap was neither soggy nor dry. The grilled chicken was equally juicy and tasty and not at all dry. All of us ate like hooligans and within few seconds the chicken was in our stomach. I think this joint is doing a great job and it would be nice if they started home delivery. One of my friend tried this cuisine for the first time and she really loved it. Our overall bill was Rs. 900.

I always wanted to try out Lebanese food so me and my folks gave a shot at Lebanese Junction. The eatery is not very big but it doesn't matter as the quality of their food was excellent. Also their service was excellent, the staff members were friendly and co-operative and the eatery itself was clean and well maintained. We tried their Chicken Shawarma Salad, Fish Irani Tikka and Grilled chicken and all three of them were excellent. It is definitely worth to visit this eatery again and again.

Note : The eatery runs on the system of self service. You place the order and get the bill. According to the bill number, you'll be called and you will have to take your food and serve it among yourselves.

1.Ambience: Well depends on your preference , if your priority is mainly food, then go ahead .
2.Food:Aah!!! At last the interesting part.. We went there on the 25th evening to pick up food on our way home. We ordered altime Lebanese favorite-Chicken Shawarma Wraps..they were perrrrrfect.. With the succulent and juicy chicken pieces swimming in generous Mayo !!!!
The next item in our order list was the sheesh tawook.. Juicy and flavoured Lebanese kebabs and they lived up to the expectation.
We plan to order the next items the next time we visit .. And mind you we sure are going to visit it as this eatery has struck all the right chords as far satisfying the taste buds are concerned.
3.Service: The service was very prompt and the staff were extremely courteous and well mannered.

Overall this is a wonderful eatery serving excellent food!!!

Gave a visit after a big hype within my group. Had bookmarked this place for a few weeks, and had planned to visit this one as soon as i arrive at Calcutta. And today, this finally goes of my "To Visit:" list.

Coming back to the eatery, small, very clean and tidy place. It has got a bar kinda feel with a long slab placed at a height and a few bar-stools (stools of relatively greater height) are there for convenience. The type of service is self service. Price is pocket friendly for grabbing a quick bite. Being located beside the famous Star Theater, has its own advantages :)

I had ordered Chicken Shawarma Wrap, which was awesome. The taratur sauce did the magic, making it a fantasy for every foodie. And, I had also ordered, Grilled Chicken, which is one of its kind :)
Both are prepared by baking the chicken as shown in the picture, making it harmless.

In short, do give this a try for authentic Lebanese food. You won't be disappointed.

Though I ordered too many items and thus it effected my pocket too but that's 100% healthy...steamed, roasted and olive oil only. Lebanese Junction is really a something that u can enjoy with or without friends but it can't quantised my foodie brain.

Lebanese junction is an awesome food joint and hands down, one of the best in kolkata. The items you would want to taste from their vast collection will be the chicken wrap, biryani, and the chicken kebab. All of them are awesome.

The quality of the food is good. Portions served, ok. The interior is clean and nice. Located at hatibagan four point crossing. But the only negative point is their serving time. They take quite some time to serve after the order has been placed especially for the shawarma wrap, which is in high demand. Otherwise a good Lebanese joint. And pocket friendly too.

Have been here multiple times. This place is a bit noisy but the behaviors of the staffs are way better than expected. Tried almost every item. Simply love this little lovely junction. But one thing I've noticed that food taste changes from time to time & sometimes pita bread was full of loose flour. One more thing, they should start selling cold drinks again. Miss them while having Lebanese.

I am a foodie. I also suffer from high blood pressure and high triglyceride and bad cholesterol levels. That restricts my food choice quite a bit. A Kolkatan speciality like chicken roll is a strict no-no to me. So the chicken shawarma wrap of Lebanese Junction came as a delicious surprise when I first tasted it a couple of weeks ago. At the risk of sounding like a TV ad, I must say the thing is both healthy and tasty. Even after consuming a couple of them at a go, neither my heart nor my stomach made a complaint, and that is saying quite a lot. 

The eatery is very conveniently located - right at the Hatibagan crossing. It has two sections. You can grab a quick bite at the outer section which has stools to sit on. If your order amount is over INR 300, you are allowed to sit in the inner section which is cool and quiet. I hate crowds and found the interior secluded and peaceful. 

The service is swift and courteous. Mr Prasun, who owns the joint and manages the cash counter, has a genuinely warm smile and is very attentive to the customers' needs and wishes. This is very important since much of the pleasure of eating out stems not so much from the richness of the ambience as from the restaurant people's ability to make you feel at home and welcome. 

So after my highly satisfying exploratory foray I visited the place with my family last week. Apart from the wrap, we ordered chicken biriyani and chicken curry. Without being oily at all both the dishes were delicious. My wife found their curry perfect for stimulating a jaded palate. 

In a nutshell, the food there is both gastronomically pleasing and heart healthy. It is the perfect destination for not-so-young people like me who enjoy their food but must shun oil and spice because of heart disease.

Well.. I dnt visit places near hatibagan quite often.. But wen i saw lebanese.. Cudn stay out of the way.. Had to try it.. Well to be very honest.. The persons who were serving and the owner himself are jolly persons with a mannerly etiquette... So they get more stars for that than their food.. Wen u make shawarmas.. U hav to keep in mind u cant make it extra creamy.. Nor extra dry.. It just needs to be perfect.. So the shawarma was good.. But not upto the mark. And chelo kebab.. Gaaawd! I juz spitted it out.. The rice was cooked well with a nice scent but the kebabs were hard nd salty.. Well u need to prepare the masala with rght amt of spices.. U cant juz pore anything.. So for me its a 3.5... Buckle up guys.. U will do good!

Location:  Just beside Star Theatre, easy to locate.

Decor: Simple and neat, Ambiance: pretty decent, Staffs: Well behaved, polite and attentive.

Our order was:

-	Chicken Shawarma wrap: came with a good filling, well charred chicken, usage of fresh vegetable and sauce, pita bread was too dry though.

-	Grilled chicken: pretty decent, meat could’ve been more tender.

-	Chicken Shawarma salad: decently prepared but again served it with dry pita breads.

Its a very average restro for your instant hunger burst. The shawarma rolls and the chicken platters are decent enough for any non-vegetarian. The price of the food is pretty reasonable and the service is okayish.

A small restaurant with very little space. In compare to other lebanese restaurants of south calcutta, I would say this one is average. It is however healthy and  very pocket friendly.

This food joint has long been a bookmark on my food map.. Today i chanced upon to pay a visit there with my friend... Being located at a live-wire hub of hatibagan that too beside the iconic star theater can be nothing less than a gem of a strategy.... Well the decor of the kitchen gives you a feel of a branded outlet... Since i have had a chance at Lebanese food only once before that too not in India ironically though ,i deem it would be better if i don't go into the intricacies of the food.. We took chicken shawarma wrap which was quite good by its standard... Then we decided to taste something different and went for some chicken wings .. And so hell it was.... I mean literally... Our world that's been so good so far had suddenly come crashing down :/... Don't take it please... They also didn't have any tomato ketchup or anything for that matter to make up for the gaffe.. The seats for a quick munch could have been more than a few handful.. Though there is an inside hall for those typical family dinner affairs there isn't provision of an ac.. Still being one of the very few lebanese outlets to have sprung up in this part of ' calcutta ' i would say this is definitely a place to check out for if you are sport for a change ☺

It is one of those eateries that has been in my wishlist for quite some time. I walked past it almost daily, pictured myself there waiting for the food and moved on with an eagerness in my heart. Finally went to this place last Saturday with a good friend who's a connoisseur of good food.

I'll jump right into the positives first. Lebanese Junction is located right at the Hatibagan crossing. If you know where Star Theatre is, there's no way you can miss this place. It remains crowded most of the time, so you may have to wait outside for a while. They have a bigger seating area which is under construction. The guy at the cash counter assured that they are installing air conditioners and it will be ready within 2 – 3 weeks.

We ordered for Chicken Shawarma Wraps and Lebanese Shish Tawook Kebab. You have to pay the amount first, they will handover a token to the Chef and ask you to take a seat till they call the number allotted to you. The wait for 10 minutes seemed longer as the aroma of roasted meat and spices doubled our hunger. Before I proceed to the quality of food they serve, I must say that they should consider making the seating arrangement more comfortable. Teenagers and young people can manage with the long bar stools but they become challenging for senior citizens and women in saris.

The guy at the cash counter had a next-door-neighbour attitude. The type which is perfect for the customer service tasks. Smiles matter to me. And this guy was distributing smiles generously. So full marks to him!
The Shawarma Wraps were delicious and just the right size. Stuffed with chicken, shredded vegetables and tasty sauce rolled up in soft and fresh pitas. If you are very hungry, you can have two shawarmas back to back. The Shish Tawook Kebab was equally delicious if not more. The meat was marinated, skewered and grilled perfectly. And the Kebabs left a wonderful taste in our mouths. There's no way we can resist the attraction of visiting this place again.

Now comes the negative part. The cash counter guy certainly has a weakness for loud Punjabi Bhangras and Indie pop hits. But he failed to realize that not all the customers have the same affection for these genres. It felt like someone is forcing us to hear what we don't enjoy. Even if you can ignore the uncomfortable bar stools, loud Honey Singh trash and choose to focus more on your food; what you can't ignore is that seeing a little boy cleaning up the dishes and doing other stuff around. They have CHILD LABOUR here! Seriously guys? You are selling international cuisine with a feudal mentality? That's outright illegal and inhuman!

P.S. The next time we visit this place, we wish to see an improved version minus all the errors. :)

This is the first time I tasted Lebanese! Although it has a single lane of arrangement of chairs but very soon it will open another room on its backside which is still getting renovated! Since we were in a group of 5 we were allowed in that room.
The place was very neat and clean.The food was superfast and the waiters were very courteous.
The food we ordered were: Jumbo grilled chicken, shawarma rolls and shawarma salad.
The grilled chicken was really good but I wished it was a bit softer.The raita and the chutney that came along with it was really tasty.The pita bread was nice and soft.The shawarma salad is the best thing it had to serve.Vggies were fresh and so was the olives.It was finger licking good. 
If you are in a mood of snacking ,this place is a good option to look out for!

"Me too lebanese food point" This is the only lebanese food point in northern part of the city. It does not offer any thing new in the menu. Moreover the famous falafel has been deleted. I expected there will be some new innovations as per the authentic food of middle east like pickled cucumber or the tahini, but its does not pay heed to that at all. The worst part of the joint in the seating area there is too much of road noise, I cud feel I was seated in the road instead. and there is NO AIR CONDITIONING. Food quality was just about ok, as the chicken was tasting pretty dull. Prices given the ambiance and location is on the higher side.

Apart from the ambience, lack of space & the biriyani every other food is very good. I hope they improve the 1st two though I don't expect to improve the quality of the biriyani( as very few people will even think of trying while there is an arsalan outlet just few strides away).

Tried this joint twice.me n my partner had one chicken shwarma wrap and one shwarma salad.believe me we had a lot of trouble finishing these dishes by ourselves.and that too just for the pocket pinch of rs 200.now coming to the quality.well the biggest plus point is the food is very healthy as it is prepared in olive oil.and the taste is superb.specially the roll with a lot of mayonnaise.loved it.surely will come again.

Well,since this place is in hatibagan i had to try it out. The place has sparse seating arrangements on high stools.
I tried the shwarma wrap. The filling was good,but the pita bread was doughy and smattered with loose maida or whatever they use. I really did not like the pita.
Dunno if it was a one-off event,but it sure as hell killed my appetite.

I with three of my friends had our lunch on this nabami. A nice joint at hatibagan opposite leather world. It has non air-conditioned seats and an open kitchen in the front. They offer self help service. We ordered shawarma rolls. They are awesome and one of the best i have ever had. Ambiance is good and ideal for hang outs with friends. Service is good. Poclet friendly. I would love to have other lebanese dishes here.

i have noticed this outlet a couple of tym while passing through hatibagan though havn't attempd to take a look..
it was the nabomi crwd during durga puja which caused the visit to there..we were soo hungry n everywhere else were full of too much crowd & then suddenly d idea strickd to my mind to taste d yummy shwarma chicken..
we were 4 members & had ordered chicken shwarma wrap which was just yummy,healthy, light n it was finger lickin good. so 5/5
the biriyani was dry n it dsn't have any potato in d plate so its a huge disaappointmnt for typical kolkatan biriyani lovers as well as potato lovers & d taste was also average.. so 2.5/5
kebab was average in taste.
so overall experience was so-so. except d shwarma wrap..

Well well. I finally encounter lebanese junction. The Bhattcharj shoe house existed here prior this shop chanced. For a couple of days I saw this place vacant and suddenly i heard news . Yet another lebanese joint has come up in hatibagan, just beside star. I thought "wow hatibagan, you are doing great for yourself". Finally,  a day when I had a show at star, and I was hungry, I almost broke into this food joint when they had just opened. What striked me is the fact that every where it was written "100% oil free, 100% healthy" . For people who understand the value of food, and how that particular cuisine is made, this is quite disturbing to the eye. However, on entering , I saw a few people asking how lebanese food is prepared and the owner was elucidating them about it. Well the first thing that I wanted was kebabs. Iranian kebab or shish tawook. But it wasn't available as the owner said that it would eventually start off the successive week. So I asked him ,  what do they serve the best out there. He suggested me humus nashib and pita bread. Honestly speaking,  I have had better nashib at royal lebanese.  The vegetables I felt was a bit undercooked.  Should have been tossed more in the olive oil. the mayonnaise was however good. The pita bread was too dry. But nevee mind , it was above average. They courteously did ask me whether I liked the food and ask me to rate it out of 5. And I rated the same as I have rated in my review and suggested them to join zomato. Its a good attempt,  but I would rather choose royal lebanese or turkus over this. So pull up your socks guys.

I tried the shawarma salad, grilled jumbo chicken and iranian chello kebab..... just fabulous. The chello was too good with rice... i really like that. They have also some tasty different kinds of dips.  I think its far better than any other lebanese  outlets in kolkata... next time i want to try the other kebabs... overall its  very good........

A year ago,Hatibagan was not everyone's choice to dine-out.But over the past year,a million restaurants have opened in this locality because of the reason that this locality is the best when it comes to shopping for occasions with a rather small budget and Go lebanese celebrates exactly the same thing-tasty food at a rather small pocket pinch.

This lebanese joint has hardly experienced two weeks but since its inception it has enjoyed the luxury of a line of customers.So,I went there on the day of their opening and took a parcel of a Grilled chicken(half).What prompted me to take this item was the fact that they cooked the chicken with skin in an electric grill,something very rare in Kolkata.The chicken was cooked perfectly and the skin added a fair amount of crisp to create a tantalizing paradox.The down side was the lack of any sauces or garnishes.A 4/5 experience.
The very next day I decide to try their Shawarma salad.The chicken was again nicely cooked and had a large amount of taratur sauce and crisp fresh veggies.The pita bread that accompanied it was warm and soft.A rather healthy snack option when compared to the roadside rolls or chow mein.This has been my best experience insofar.A 4.5/5 experience for me.
Today,after a good 11 days,I visited this place and gave a tried their Kay Kababs.They just seem to give a lot of care to their chicken as again it was perfectly cooked,juicy and soft.The taste of this kabab was not so impressive.The flavour  was dominated by packeted ginger-garlic and their was hardly any other flavour to be found.I doubt that even if there were other flavours in it,the ginger-garlic would have made it hard for me recognize it.Salads.garnishes,sauces and dips were again found wanting.This has been by worst experience and is worth 2/5 that too only for the chicken.
To sum it up, my experience at Go Lebanese has had one very big high and one very big low.The friendly staff and quick service is worth praise and I'm waiting to try their other kababs which I  hope are not as bad this one.

A good 4/5.

This joint is very new ( counting today, only 12 days old, to be precise ), yet it's showing signs that it's here for a long run. I have paid a visit today evening. It's a bit crowded, but the food is worth waiting for. I tried Lebanese Kay kebab there and Shawarma salad as a take home. The kebab was juicy and tasty, a bit different in flavour. I missed to add the Add on dips at the end of the menue. The shawarma salad was accompanied with pita bread. It was a standard shawarma salad, healthy, tasty and juicy, as a shawarma salad should be. Pita bread was also very soft and tasty. Overall a good experience. I am planning for another visit with my friends.

Went to this lebanese joint situated just beside Star Theatre, just two days after it opened to have Lebanese Kebabs but they didn't started making kebabs and said they will starting the kebab section by this week. So had to settle for Shawarma Wrap and Grilled Chicken(Jumbo). The wrap was good with lots of season chicken breasts marinated and cookied on rottissierie and sliced and also had taratur sauce in it. Now coming to the Grilled Chicken I was not specially charmed with the taste and there was a peculiar smell coming out of it. So overall my experience at Lebanese Junction was so-so and I am planning to give a try to the kebabs.
