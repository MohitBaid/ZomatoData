Got home delivered Chicken Ramen. 
With chicken sauted toppings and black pepper sauce. 
It was too good. Specially the chicken toppings. 
Basically you should try it. 
Satisfied with the taste.

A birthday treat went well here. Really good food. The noodles had an unusual sweet sauce- which was uncommon-, the usual chilli sauce and vinegar with cut chilis that are mostly served everywhere. The noodles had chopped mushrooms, broccoli and many more surprising items which added more flavour to the food.

A wondeful place to be💖it's not that expensive yet it's so refreshing.... they have 2 options for the soup stock & i had ordered the Japanese one... I loved it ...it's simple like how Japanese people are. .buttery too.. the bok choi was perfectly blanched😊though the chicken balls were a bit spicy for me 😅it went with the entire meal😊...

Small and Cute restaurant located at Ballygunge place. It was very difficult to find because the map was wrong. Coming to the food it was Good!! We had chicken sui Mai, ramen, nasi goreng and wok of life. All its were tasty and the quantity was pretty good. The owner was very friendly and suggested us his best items. I would have liked to give more stars if there was a decent washroom. It is easy on the pocket for college students like us.
P.s. chicken sui Mai is a must try!

A little Asian visit in the midst of Kolkata. Decked by thoughtful quotes this place stands welcoming their customers just beside 6 ballygunge place. The ramen sisters and the narsi goreng brothers seem to play here all day. I got acquainted with them over a plate of ramen noodles. Overwhelmed by their warmth and hospitality I took one of them home. The narsi goreng with all its flavours enchanted the dwellers of my home. So if you happen to meet them don't forget to congratulate them with the choicest delicacies. After all you have got the best complimentary Thai dessert in town.

Have had food home delivered. As they only do delivery. 
Love the dumplings thoroughly. 
They were one the very first to have the cute Chinese packaging start in the city and people loved it. 
Portion size is very decent. 
True to the ingredients they use.  
Good place to order from.

I ordered chicken teriyaki with steamed rice and sauteed vegetables along with dimsums. The teriyaki was the worst I've ever had with too much of soya sauce and a burnt smell. It was salty and not tasty at all. For a place with such a high end price I expected much better quality. The rice was gritty and tasted awful along with some boiled leaves. They claim this meal serves 2 but it doesnt even serve one. The dimsums were okay but the rest was not worth it. I spent 641 for just these two items but it was horrible.

Refreshing menu. It is not the typical chinese that most of the joints serve. It is south east asian cuisine in true sense. Ramen bowl, nasi/mei goreng, mandarin tacos, wok style noodles, prawn sui mai are the items I have tasted. All of them were above the average dishes, especially the prawn sui mai.It does have a small area for dining but I prefer take away from there.

This is a famous outlet, available for takeaway. as the name implies, the packaging is done in a nice box, with tiny containers for sauces etc.
I tried their Chicken Sui Mai which is served with vinegar sauce. Their food is always fresh. The size of the Sui Mai was tiny. It is basically a chinese dish which resembles small momo-like things with chicken fillings. I felt that 5 pcs at Rs. 150 (incl GST) was too overpriced.
Why would I eat here again? Because they offer huge variety of Asian dishes.
Why not? The price could be a little more reasonable.

Eat out of the box packaging is nice but no chopsticks or cutlery is given along with the boxes, so kind of fails the concept. Ordered kung pao chicken which did not have a single peanut, but had cashew nuts instead, tasted like roadside chili chicken. I ordered jasmine rice on the side but they made a weird excuse about the bill not including the price and gave "complimentary" basmati rice. I checked my bill later and it included a single portion of jasmine rice. Just admitting that they were out of jasmine rice would have been better. Only good things are the large portion size and the packaging. Otherwise pretty average.

First off, I'd like to mention that this is now my second time to India, and my first time to Kolkata. I am 26 years old and I'm from Canada. I actually stumbled upon this restaurant one afternoon when the rains were so heavy and I was just looking for a bottle of water. The chef insisted I come in a get some coverage from the rain and offered me some water. I'm so happy I decided to come in. 

I have traveled to many places in India, and I've eaten at many restaurants. I've been to places such as leh, Ladakh (Jammu), Dharamsala, Agra, Manali, Goa, Delhi, and some others as well. This by far has been one my best dining experiences as a whole. I've eaten there already a handful of times, and I plan on still going back. Either the Chef himself, or the amazing waiter are always there to tend to my every need.  Whether I'm looking to get an understand about a dish, or asking for certain spices /condiments, or even to just chat, they are always keen to make sure I'm doing well and enjoying my food. I've got 11 years on the service/food industry in Canada, and this is one place that I very highly recommend. The dishes are absolutely amazing, and they will speak for themselves. Have just one dish, and you will know exactly what I mean. They are made with fresh ingredients every time! Even the garnish is on point! I'm so happy I've found this place,  and it's worth a trip into ballygang just to eat there! Keep up the great work Asia in box!!!!

Last weekend we had visited this place for dinner with my family the location is near to 6 Ballygunge place this place is well located with ample car parking. if one would want some good essence food please try this place. 

Now coming to the food

The foods are different from others places .Asian in box is certainly one of those neighborhood restaurant amazing food some of the best I have ever experienced some of the sauces. I do wish them all the best in their endeavours and we hope they keep serving us the same way in the years to come.. wish you all the best 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦😀
