It is near bowbazar crossing; Chinese street food corner. Provides delicacies at a cheap price. No such seating available. The food are real good preferably the varieties of chicken prep. Perfect for an evening snack.

Common place for having fast foods while u r in bowbazaar more... Fast food out here are nothing so special ... There are pretty good options nearby... I love the momos out here but i feel price to be a bit high as per quantity and quality... there are no options for momos nearby... Except this place

Triasha Fast Food is located one corner of Bowbazar crossing just opposite of Tanishq Jewellery. I have been to this place once to twice and haven't found any thing much interesting.
There is hardly any place to seat, moreover due to its location it becomes difficult to have to food while standing in that busy footpath.
The food quality isn't good yet and in that price. They just taste little better then and footpath shops. The egg Chowmine is marked at Rs.70 for a full plate, is not at all Worthy and same for the other dishes.
There are much better places nearby offering good food at cheaper rate. Not much recommend.

Located near Goenka College. Went for Chicken Roll it was stale and not hygienic at all. Ate half the roll and then threw it in the bin. Staff are dumb and clumsy. It is pocket friendly thats it. No dine-in so best for takeaway.

How could this go unrated when I'm a Goenkan ? Located just near to my college (Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration)
It doesn't have any seating arrangement. Thus the customers have to sit on a space under the tree :P 
Food items are readily available and good. Staffs are okay. 
Fast food and pocket friendly - Perfect Combination. :)

Its the second branch of Triasha located near to Bow Bazaar, shuttled just in a corner of the crossing. Just like the Amherst Street branch its just the food counter with no dining but you can sit on the road in front of the restaurant to have their foods.

Decorations : Its just a food counter, so no dining, no decorations to discuss, just the street food counter experience that you will get. But the part of discuss is hygiene level over here. The roadside kitchen is not too small but spaces weren't utilized well that is seen. Their kitchen seems to be very dirty & not at all maintained so hygiene becomes a huge question over here.

Staffs & Management : From a street food counter its hard to expect profession cook & staffs, even they weren't. But they behave politely with customers & serves fast.

Foods : As I was pretty much satisfied with the quality of Triasha Amherst Street brach so I was expecting the same quality from here too. So I ordered what most people prefer to order as street food...

Egg Noodles : Very thick noodles with equal soft & nicely cooked. Mixed with lot of vegetables & lite spices. Egg was nicely crispy fried into golden brown that felt nice. Sauces used were pathetic. Bit on the oilier side. Overall very average taste & not at all impressive.

Egg Fried Rice : It was dam hot with lots of green chillies in it. Rice was of low quality. Not very well cooked but there was lots of vegetables nicely diced in it. A bit oily but that also doesn't smelt good. Somehow egg was nicely crispy golden fried that felt good in mouth but sauces used were pathetic. The taste wasn't good enough to impress me.

Pricing : Pricing is average, but comparatively higher than other street restaurants in the same area. On the other hand their full plates offer more quantity than other restaurants of the same place.

Conclusion : If you are thinking of street food being in Bow Bazaar then its an option to take. Somehow with not so good food quality searching for better restaurant will be recommend than get stuck to this.

Triasha - Roadside Food Stall near Goenka College

=====

Location + Intro:It is located very near to Goenka College (My old college). I had been to this place yesterday with one of my office colleague. He was very much boasting about this place and somehow as it is a food place, i couldn't miss on trying it out. :P It took us sometime to reach this place. The place looks nothing very extraordinary. It is a just a road side food shop with 3-4 people sitting arrangement. The hygiene of this place is not really good at all. No maintenance too.

=====

Food Ordered:

He ordered for both of us. I was like okay lets go by someones else's recommendation this time. What we ate:-

1) Drums of Heaven - 8 pieces costing near about 130 bucks. Tasted really good. Nicely coated pieces of chicken and tossed in green chillies, garlic, bell peppers and onions.

2) Tandoori Chicken - Two pieces of Tandoori chicken costing 100 bucks. Really cheap aint it? I loved the chicken. The kashmiri mirch and red color was used to give it that red color. Nicely coated in masalas. The chicken was crispy on the out due to grill and tender on the inside. I sprinkled lemon on it and had it with fresh cut onion rings. Mouth melting is the word for this. #musttry.

3) Mixed Chowmien - The chowmien here is not the thin chowmien but the thick and soft one. It was melting in the mouth. The other addons were chicken, egg and small prawns. It was too oily but tasted good.

I had heard a lot about their rolls and shall come in the future to try it. :-)

=====

Meal for two: 180-350 approximately

=====

Pros:

1) Location is really good.

2) Have rolls for daily office goers and also special chicken gravy items for takeaways as well. Heard about their biriyani's too. Shall try soon.

3) Prices are very reasonable.

4) Somehow using their space, they tried to manage for the seating arrangements. Though not really proper.

Cons:

1) Hygiene is an issue here. They can take care of a few things though to maintain it.

=====

Expert Suggestions:

1) Maintain your hygiene.

=====

Summary:

Food Quality 3.5/5

Food Quantity 3.7/5

Taste 3.6/5

Hygiene 2.0/5

Ambience 2.0/5

Value for money 3.3/5

=====

Conclusion: I would rather do a take away than eat here or munch up a roll. Food is not bad here though. However, indo-chinese food tastes best when served hot. :)

=====

Note: Unbiased review based on my visiting experience. Pictures have been attached.

OFFICE PARTY!!!!!!!!!!
So it was a office party so no big things to grab. This time it was Chicken fried rice. From the last time the rice was not upto the mark... Chicken was tasting like it is boiled. but that dosent mean they provide bad food.. it happens sometimes.

It serves with its role a extra extra layer of "dalda"....at least for one months' requirement can be achieved by one single role' try this if you have someone who eat anything and in large quantity....one roll can make his appetite blocked for 12 hrs at least....!!!????
