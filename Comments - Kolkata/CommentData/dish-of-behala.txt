This is a small eating joint. Have ordered food a lot of times from here. Their chow good in taste as their quantity is always very good. Only problem is their seating arrangement.

Ordered schezuan chowmin and American chopsuey. They served normal chowmin. Both the dishes. When charged, they said nothing in their defense. Waste of money. 
And the Biriyani combo is ok and cheap, but the taste of the biriyani was horrible. Too rich with spices and smelly af. The chicken was also too rich. 
Anyway, there are many good restaurants near that place, so keep this place as the last option.

Honestly speaking,its one of the best,given the price. I had rolls and chows several times from this place and its worth every bit of the buck you pay. The place is a roll counter type of place but the food is decent enough . Try the dry chilly chicken here. I loved it

This place is situated near to my coaching classes so had visited there quite a few times. This is take away counter which provides rolls and chinese cuisines. Now coming to the food I recently tasted their egg roll which was quite good but a few months back I tasted their veg chow which was awesome. The only negativity is their seating arrangement.

Just a normal roll counter or fast food centre what ever you may call. They offer good rolls and average or moderate quality of noodles. Though the biryani they offer is pretty average. They don't have sitting arrangements except from some chairs outside. Located at the crossing of sakherbazar, behala!

Value for Money! We used to visit this place everyday while returning from college. Their rolls are very heavy and good in taste. I liked their Mughlai paratha and chowmein as well.

More of a roll center than a eating joint.
Located just next to sakher bazar crossing.
Makes decent rolls & chowmein though, and they make the rolls with lachha parota which i like.
Also the biriyani is quite good for the money.

This is a small takeaway at behala Sakherbazar crossing which is here for around a couple of years now. Have ordered food a lot of times from here and i love them. I love their fish pakora, chilli fish, Dish of special chicken. Their lunch and dinner special combos are also a good one as their quantity is always very good. You can even check on their biriyani as its not too oily. 
Don't plan to have your food there as they don't provide much of sitting arrangements and just have a couple of chairs on the foot path which is again a busy road so it will be very irritating and tough.
Over all a good take away.
