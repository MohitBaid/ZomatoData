A shitty place to visit..  No proper place to sit and if u end up taking a parcel home the panner sabji will hardly have a couple of panner...  Perhaps the last parcel... Hard times..

They cook in a very unhygienic place. Also I had ordered Veg Manchurian and they gave a Paneer Chilly instead. Plus the Chowmein wasn't available so I had to take up fried rice which was burnt and had a bad taste.

I visited this place once with some of my friends and tried their butter naan, paneer paratha, peas paneer pulao, jeera rice, paneer butter masala, paneer kofta, makhni dal, reshmi paneer tandoori, chana masala and kadai paneer. The grevy for paneer butter masala and kadai paneer tasted all most the same, rest were good. To me the winning dish was paneer kofta, dal makhni and pulao, missed panner in paneer paratha. Alu paratha was nice. Overall a good experience. Stuffs need to be a little more well behaved while communicating.

For quick bites this place is good.Poor ambience or in fact no ambience you have to eat while standing in a way which leads to other shop.Veg roll amd paneer roll are good.Loacted near Howrah Ac Market.

When i am at a new place then i surely look around and explore new food hubs and this is what i was doing there. Went to this place yesterday with a cousin. Located at Dobson road new Howrah Ac market. I am not a veg food lover but when something is too good to be ignored then it will surely be going down to my mouth. They deal with some quality and vareity of food items as thali and take aways.
Took a review from the manager itself about the place which said this place to start with only Veg thali food and snacks. Now they have expanded their business and bought the beside properties as well where they offer you  Sandwiches as well as variety of shakes and drinks. Small sitting area containing three tables, the place is very dirty and not managed properly. 
Tried couple of dishes here for a quick survey.

1. Baby Corn Roll - This was very well made. The paratha was not oily and soft, missed the crunchness thou. The babycorn in the middle were somewhere less spicy as i expected.

2. Veg chow - This was a good one. Looked very appealing on the front. Contained good amount of vegetable and looked very spicy. 

The experience was quite good here, all the staff were quite freindly.

NOTE: This review is based on my perosnal visit and experience to this place.
