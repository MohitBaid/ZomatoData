A pure vegetarian restaurant near Howrah Station, that offers fabulous pure veg Thali at Rs 90/- only.
The veg Thali included three pic roti, around 200 GM rice , a very tasty Dal, Matar Paneer, Alu Gobi ka sabzi, Parwal alu ka sabzi and a pice of roasted Papadam. All served in canteen style thalis.
On holi evening when most catering outlets were closed in and around this location, this restraunt fetched some good food that was really tasty even when there was a rush.
The menu is vast and even includes some vegetarian kolkata style chinese dished.Special Hakka Noodles was  sweet in taste and had small cubes of paneer in it.
 They also have an air conditioned section on the top floor where large groups can seat and enjoy there meal.It is better to opt for the Indian dishes, they are just mouth wateringly tasty.Do not expect much panash in service, but then do serve the food fast, if ordered properly.Exhotick items on the menu would take considerable amount of time.If one is in the area to board a train or for official purpose and wants to avoid railway food, this is the place to be.

I had once tried their famous kulfi faluda and it was really good. The prices are moderate and the place is clean.  So definitely worth a visit. :-)

Very ordinary veg restaurant located opposite of the howrah bus stand. I and my mother visited this place a year ago and ordered Thali and shahi paneer. It was above the expectation. Staffs are gentle and polite. In a Thali there were rice,dal,4 large roties, 2 types of sabji and it cost only 80 INR at that time.
