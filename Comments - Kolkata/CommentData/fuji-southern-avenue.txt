Just had a unplanned impromptu dinner with my classmate Ronita from school days between a maddening schedule. Also it happened to be mine birthday as well. We just planned to meet up for coffee but ended up directly at a Japanese restaurant near our homes as we felt too lazy and stressed out to discover anything new. Ended up in Fuji on nearby Lansdowne and as usual their food was good. I has earlier visited their CP outlet on New Delhi. Had Mushroom Sushi, Tori Tempura, Tori Yakimeshi, Tori Nanban Tarutaru and soft drinks. Food was great as usual, not too pricey and right in quantity. It was surprisingly pocket friendly despite being the only fully Japanese flag bearer resto in the city.  Ambiance was okay. We opted for Japanese style seating. #fujikolkata #japanesefinedine #kolkata  #mumbaikar  #unplannedmeetsarebest #indianfood #gourmetdininginkolkata #travel #tourism #foodie #japanesetrstaurantinkolkata #japanesefoodinkolkata #india #incredibleindia #cosmopolitankolkata #southkolkata #proudsouthkolkatans #cityofjoy #japanesedininginkolkata #gourmetjapanese #sushilover #mushroomsushi #toritempura #toriyakimeshi #torinanbantarutaru

Birthday bash at Fuji 

Items ordered.. Salmon and tuna roll (sake maki md tekka maki respectively... Nd Yakitori Moriwase(assorted japanese skewers)

The sake maki and tekka maki... Just superb... The wasabi, pickled ginger nd soy sauce perfected the marriage.. Really good quality raw materials used and each and every item perfect to the core.. Had such awesome sushi after a really long time

Coming to the assorted skewers.. The offering included grilled chicken, grilled chicken nd leek, ham nd tomato, minced chicken nd prawn

I liked the grilled chicken most as im not a fan of assorted vegetables with meat, however i didnt like the prawn one as it came with the shell..maybe to my palate deshelled would have appealed more.. Also ham and tomato isnt a marriage made in heaven.. Biting into the crispy ham was nice..but the tomato juice oozing out and lessening the crisp..not a hapoy experience

However since we went on my birthday.. They gave me ice cream on the house which was a very sweet gesture.. And i welcomed it with an open heart and a gleeful soul.. Thank you Fuji

Having previously had a less than pleasant experience at another Japanese restaurant, we had some apprehension regarding our lunch plan here. But I think this time it's safe to say we managed to order the right things.
We were perhaps the first customers of the day at 1 o' clock on a Monday afternoon. Turns out the reservation wasn't necessary.
Anyway coming to the food, we ordered the Green eyed monster mocktail, Yakitori Moriawase, Ebi (prawn) Tempura and Kaisen Yakisoba.
The lady who took our orders offered to mix up the Yakitori with prawn and ham instead of 5 skewers of grilled chicken only; to which we agreed.
The green eyed monster tasted as interesting as it sounds. The Yakitori and Tempura were satisfying and the seafood noodles with its Japanese sauces was light and flavourful.
Special thanks to the lady who took our orders and provided our food (unfortunately we never caught her name) she was very helpful and in general a delight. +1 for her! Domo arigatou! 
Also, special mention of the Japanese music they play. Didn't understand a word but it felt really apt.

Fuji, which is one of the fine dining Japanese Restaurants in the city. Its not very big but the decor and interior is done in a very nice way. Me n my friend ordered Maki Mono Sushi -  TEKKA MAKI and noodles - SOMEN CHAMPURU.The taste of the Sushi was too good but it would be better if they increase its size a bit.

Amezing decor is the definitely a good advantage for this outlet. Food is amazingly prepared and garnished. We had few nice sushi platter named "goa maki" , "jonigiri 7 ken" and portion of pork noodles named "buta yakisoba" Sushi is absolutely fantastic. 5 out of 5. But didn't enjoyed the noodles. Its was not bad though. May be for noodles I would have definitely given 5 rating. Server could have suggested us for better main course. Though sushi were nicely suggested.
Definitely visit again.
Cheers....!!!!

Firstly, I have always called for hole delivery from this place and never visited it. The reason being that this place looks horrible from outside. It gives the vibe of some cheap bar and in the night, with those red lights and the disgusting sign board saying 'BAR' I really wouldn't be surprised if someone mistook it for a pick up joint or brothel.

Coming to the food, it's absolutely fantastic. I have tried the Cheese Maki, Avocado Maki, Spicy Mushroom Maki, Vegetable Maki and the Asparagus Maki. The only fault in all this was the sauce in the Spicy Mushroom Maki was a bit too spicy. Rest of the food fantastic, top notch. Can't complain there. 

Where this restaurant loses out on is its exterior decor. If it doesn't fix that then it will lose a lot of customers and a lot of people will miss some great good. My rating would have been better had the decor not been HORRIBLE.

Prawn Tempura and chicken Ramen bowl
Visited in july with a friend. Service was really good. So was the food. But I think it's a little expensive specially the tempura. We got 5 pieces for 700 bucks. Maybe it was satisfying if the quantity was more. Other than that. Overall, the place and the food was beautiful.  👌

Have been wanting to try out this place for so long. The decor is good. There were Japanese pop songs, some being anime opening/ending, playing. The tableware was cool....except the cup for sake. It was one of those cups you'd pick up from a souvenir shop. Also the waitress wasn't all that good. She was rude and she messed up our order. Luckily the food covered up for it.

We ordered-

Spicy Shake Kawa- This is basically salmon SKIN (and the skin alone) coated in batter, deep fried and then tossed in sauce with strips of onion and bell pepper. It actually tasted good, if you don't mind the peculiar fatty taste of fish skin (But it's salmon skin...and it's rich in omega 3 fatty acid, which is so good for you!!!! :P). Oh!! And it's really crispy too :D

Ika Nigiri Sushi- Slice of raw squid resting on a log of sweet sticky rice with a tiny amount of wasabi already smeared on the rice. It's served with a bit more wasabi and pickled ginger on the side. Pour out some soy sauce into the small dish. You may dissolve a tiny amount of wasabi (you only need the tiniest amount.....) in it if you like. Then dip the sushi and have it. You can also put the ginger slice on it. It was good and there was no yucky smell.

Chicken Miso Ramen- The ramen is quite a comfort food. The broth was light with subtle flavour. There were shreds of cooked chicken, sweet corn, green onion, moyashi bean sprout (so crunchy), wakame seaweed, sesame seeds, noodles and a slice of egg. I say slice of egg because it wasn't the conventional boiled egg (see pic). The taste was nice but the texture wasn't. The fancy egg might've been taken out from the fridge and heated up in the microwave......that's the kind of texture it had. Apart from the egg, I loved the miso ramen.

One of my favourite place to unwind,  a beautiful Japanese theme restaurant which now has a Bar added with it. This place is perfect for a quite date, for a self rejuvenation time or official meet, and of course if you are a die hard Japanese cuisine lover. For me the causes are all of the above. Fuji makes authentic lip-smacking Japanese cuisine at a very reasonable rate and the lowest in the city. I keep visiting this place for Makimono Moriawase platter. My favourite. The waiters are very warm and helpful, specially with my attempts to eat with chopsticks. The service is pretty fast. The decoration will make you feel as if you are in Japan, the small cabins with Shoji doors gives a warm hint to the ambience. I am basically allergic to seafood if not prepared right, but I never had an issue with the food prepared here, hence they make food very hygienically. I aim to visit several time till I had each and every item on the menu and more :)

Very conveniently located at Southern Avenue this is one of the very few joints in Kolkata predominantly serving Japanese cuisines. The ambience is soothing with the option of sitting in chairs or in mattresses. The service is prompt and the staffs are very co operative in selecting the individual items as per the requirement and always make sure to take care of their guests in every possible ways.

Coming to food they are really wonderful as they come with great taste and correct texture. We tried their appetizers, sushis and main dishes which are delectable and can't remember the names as they are all in Japanese terms. Price is on a bit higher side but still justified compared to the overall dining experience as provided by them .

A round of applause for the patrons and quiet recommended for other foodies.

Japanese Cuisine is one of the most traditional and culturally diverse to say the least. Yet, we barely know just as much as we read in books or the internet. I would like to take this oportunity to thank Atreya Paul for educating us a little about this ancient culture that we know very less of. I was elated to be a part of the Blogger's Meet hosted at FUJI, Kolkata - the standalone japanese restaurant in the city and learn about the japanese culture and their staple ramen which is a very humble and sustainable dish.

We were served the following ::

• Zaru Soba
 which is Traditional wheat noodles served in soy bean soup.  This is cold ramen and is eaten with only soy sauce.

• Chicken Shoyu Ramen
 which is Ramen Noodles cooked in soya base stock served with chicken, vegetables and boiled egg. The broth was nice and light, the chicken pieces were shredded and the ramen was finely cooked.

• Butakakoni Miso Ramen
 which is Ramen noodles cooked in miso base stock served with cooked pork, vegetables and boiled egg. It was pretty much as good as the chicken version, if not any better.

• Tanuki Udon
 is Hot buckwheat served in soy bean soup and topped with bits of fried tempura batter. This had a lovely crunchy feel to it due to the tempura batter, the ramen was cooked to perfection as usual. An absolute delight.

• Soumen Champuru
 which is Pan sauteed thin wheat noodles with chicken and assorted vegetables in Japanese sauces which was nice and quite palatable.

• Tori Yakisoba
 which is Pan sauteed noodles with chicken and assorted vegetables in Japanese sauces which is quite suited for the Indian palate.

Knowledge of food and culture is something that you cannot put an end to so keep learning and keep growing. That being said, Fuji is also known for the sushi, tempura, teriyaki and maki which is equally just as good. I love this restaurant's authenticity and definitely recommend everyone to give this a try especially now that the winter is setting in!

It was finally time for a #Japanesefoodexpedition today afternoon at #FUJI - a beautiful restaurant cum bar tucked away at Sarat Bose Road.. Enjoyed amazing noodle delicacies from Japan (perfect to go with the coming winters) following the authentic Japanese tradition of having food bare foot in those traditional low lying seats.. Relished on #ZARUSOBA, #CHICKENSHOYURAMEN, #BUTAKAKUNIMISORAMEN, #TANUKIUDON, #SOUMENCHAMPURU (with seafood) & #TORIYAKISOBA..

The lunch was fulfilling and a memorable one.. Can't wait to head back to this Japanese den yet again sometime soon.. What about you??

Sushi was served with spicy green sauce which  enhances the taste thousand time. We also ordered ramen.. it was perfect in taste... and we also orderd some other dishes.. actually i can not recall the name of all dishes as it was named in a traditional japanese way.. but overall, the place will perfectly satisfy the taste buds of all japanese cusine lovers...

Have been looking forward to visiting this place for a long time. Finally made it last Sunday for dinner. It is situated inside an old building, I guess on the 3rd or 4th floor. The place is spacious, well lit and tastefully decorated with Japanese influence. 
Coming to the food, we ordered Grilled Pork with Ginger Sauce, Butakakuni Miso Ramen, Octopus Sushi and Prawn Sashimi.

Some times you need a moment of silence after tasting insanely good food. We had several of such moments at Fuji. It was my first time trying sashimi and boy, I was blown! The prawns perfectly cured and with a bit of soy sauce, it was super delicious. The octopus sushi takes time to grow on you due to the texture of the protein. But it's worth it. The sticky rice has the right amount of flavour allowing the protein to take centre-stage. The pork appetizer was light and delicious with the sweetness of soy sauce and meatiness of pork singing through.

But it was the Miso Ramen that nailed it. It was the absolute best soupy noodles I have ever had. There was complete silence at the table once we tasted this heavenly dish.Fuji has impressed me beyond expectations. Definitely the best Japanese place in the city. I am definitely going back again.

Went to this Japanese restaurant last week. The ambiance was beautiful. The staffs were very courteous and helpful. As we were trying out Japanese cuisine for the first time, we were unfamiliar with most of the dishes and it's names. The waiter took a good time explaining us all the items and helping us to decide our order. 😊 We ordered Yakitori Moriawase Skewers which were mouth watering delicious. We decided to try the sushi platter (Non-veg Makimono Moriawase). It contained 7 kinds of raw fishes with rice and took a hell lot of determination to eat that. 😋 I won't comment anything about the sushi as I tasted it for the first time and hence can't say if it can taste any better. The overall experience was nice.

Went for a late lunch on a weekday,the restaurant was empty,we were served very quickly.The servers were extremely polite,and the ambience is very easy on the eyes.
We ordered a chicken teriyaki sushi roll,tako sashimi,california rolls,chicken miso ramen soup and prawn tempura.
I am not a big fan of traditional raw fish sushi so tako was the least favourite dish for me. 
But everything apart from that was delectable. Will definitely visit again for the ramen,it was very flavourful. Chicken teriyaki and prawn tempura tasted very nice too. 
The place is expensive,but the food is authentic and tasty. Definitely recommended.

Was very excited to try the food here.  Especially the sushi.  

The gyozas were the only thing that saved the day. 
The salmon for my sushi did not taste very good.  
Had a bitter strange taste to it.  
The miso soup had a similar bitter taste.  I do not know if similar ingredients were used for both.  

I am huge sushi fan and I was utterly sad.  :(

None the less.  The gyoza was great.  
And hopefully the next visit will be better.  :)

A great place for sushi. We ordered the seabass and the mackerel sushi. Both tasted very fresh as it should. The yakitori was nice and the teriyaki sauce was a little sweet. The ramen had a flavorful broth but needed some spice. The pricings were not on the reasonable side to be true, but definitely worth it for the food. The ambience of the restaurant was quaint and they even had a live kitchen by which you could see the chefs at work preparing your meal. A great place to go if you want to taste good Japanese food.

A good  place for Japanese cuisine enthusiasts. Ordered Maki Sushi platter, Seabass Sashimi,  Pork and Egg Rice, paired with Chenin Blanc and Maitai Cocktail and Wasabi icecream as dessert. The Sushi was  great, specialy with the strong wasabi. Chenin Blanc was not a good pairable wine though, may be some Sake or atleast Riesling would be better. I usually dont like Sashimi so this case was not an exception, still I think it was worth as experience. The pork-rice was fragrant, specially with a spice smell of cloves and cinnamon.  The wasabi icecream had a strange taste, I don't think the sweet taste of vanila matches with the strong aftertaste of wasabi. Overall, the service was quick, the staff- courtious  and the food was delicious. The ambience was a little dull but that can be overlooked compared to their standard of food.

Ordered: Sushi platter,seabass sashimi,pork and egg rice, Chenin Blanc,maitai,wasabi icecream.

So I finally tried out some sushi! I loved the seabass sashimi more,though.It was succulent,tasty.I dipped the sushi in the sauce and wasabi for too long, my eyes teared up! It's like attempting to eat raw sarso concentrate.
Noticed a lot of textures, presentation was quite pretty. However,one needs to have a big bite-size,which I don't and it was a little troublesome for me to have each sushi.
They provide you with fork and chopsticks but you're technically not supposed to stick fork into sushi so yeah,good luck with them chopsticks.
My friends love sushi,I tried it here,I didn't.Maybe,I'll give it another go someplace else.
The rice was sweet,tasted good.

Chenin Blanc had a wonderful smell.I don't understand why people hate Sula.I'm no connoisseur but it tasted quite nice to me.
Maitai was really tasty too for a summer afternoon and I couldn't finish even half the tall glass in which it was served.Wasabi icecream had the flavour of wasabi and taste of a Vanilla icecream,two scoops in one plate,quite lovely.

They serve sushi,but don't serve sake.THAT WAS WRONG.Chenin Blanc cannot do sake's work.

3.6/5

Ambience: there's a tiny place for lounging,with two tables which,would fit 5-8 people each.The whole place was quite small but neat.There was a pretty lady at the counter in a pink kimono,with a Korean accent.
A yellowish golden light was there inside,some light music was there.
3.5/5

Service: quick,the waiter who attended to our table was well-behaved, however he referred to sticky rice as "fena bhaat"(rice in starch water),that was funny.I had to raise my voice for his attention though, every time I wanted something,that was bit of a bummer, especially for a place,that small.
3.5/5

Will revisit maybe,only for the quirky icecream and the sashimi.

A place for people who love Japanese culture. I'm not yet a big fan of Japanese food, but yes this place has managed to change my decision.
             Comfortable seatings with two traditional Japanese seatings. The lady who takes orders and serves is dressed exactly like a Japanese citizen. You get a total different ambience.
               For food we had Buta Ramen and the maki sushi platter. Both were amazing. Best Sushi I've tasted in Kolkata undoubtedly. The Ramen was so much in quantity and so filling.
               The price might seem a bit too much for certain items but to me it seemed worth every bit. 
                Definitely will recommend this place and surely coming back.

After 5 visits, I finally write my review about this amazing Japanese themed restaurant. It's only because of Fuji's that I started loving sushi, and Goa Maki Taa has become like a drug whenever I eat out over here. Occassionally, we order other items such as Dimsums and chowmein along with beer, but the sushi is the real winner for me. A special mention for the soy sauce that is totally out of this world as it goes hand in hand with the sushi. Hopefully, in the next visit, I'll try my level best to try something new. (Fingers crossed)

They serve the most authenticate japanese food in kolkata. Tried nigri sushi - squid nd prawn which was awesome with the wasabee sauce both spicy and tangy. I tried japanese for the first time and thanks to my elder sister who loves japanese cuisine, was a different kind of experience all together. Rest of my family ordered for Chinese since they were scared of trying japanese food. Their Chinese was were also good. Pan fried chilli fish , mixed fried rice and hot garlic chicken were all good but tasted a little flat to me after trying their wasabee sauce. Food is expensive and service is top notch. The person had all the knowledge about japanese cuisine which made us choose our japanese starters nd main course. Will visit once again if possible with only my sister to try more of their japanese delicacies.

Disappointing experience. I ordered the Kaisen (Fish) Mushimono. Barely two tiny pieces of fish and lots of vegetables. This is not how it is supposed to be . I had the same dish at Fuji, Delhi and it had lots of fish and cabbage (no other veggies). It appears management is trying to scrimp on the fish to increase their profitability.

The same was the case with the 3 variety Sashimi we ordered. Extremely tiny cuts of fish.

One is paying well for the japanese meal and expect to be served correct portions.

Management is scrimping on portions. Avoid the place.

I was taken to this place as a reward for doing a rather impossible work for a friend. Located in Southern Avenue, the interior is impressive and gives you the traditional Japanese feel. However, that's the only good thing about this place.
We ordered a Virgin Mojito (which was satisfactory) and a Yakitori Moriawase to begin with. The latter is a platter consisting of skewers of Chicken and prawn. It was good, and frankly the reason why I've decided to give this place 2 points instead of 1.

We next went for the Maguro Nigiri (Tuna Shushi). Perhaps we do not posses the taste buds required to appreciate such 'delicacies'. Perhaps it was really a bad, bad dish. The blandness was maddening even for a sushi. The accompanying wasabee was caustic and horrible. The price was outrageous.

To add to the misery, the staff was painfully slow. We had ordered a strawberry milkshake just to make the night better, and they did not serve it even fifteen minutes after we placed the order. However the worst part was yet to come. They experienced issues with accepting payment via card, and that made them force us to leave our plates, walk down to the other side of the road and stand for half an hour in a queue to withdraw money, along with 5 other customers. On top of that, they blatantly refused to take any more order from us (including the pre-ordered milkshake). 

It is said that hardship brings out the true nature of a person. In this case, it was a restaurant joint claiming to be hospitable and efficient. Instead of correcting their problems or volunteering to send one staff to the queue, they became too desperate and practically forces their diners out on the streets to get the money they owed, and refused to serve after that.
So much for a joint serving crappy food in the name of 'authentic Japanese cuisine' and not caring one bit about customer service or relations.
I look forward to discovering actual nice restaurants serving authentic Japanese cuisine so that I can change my view about Sushis and Moriawase. I'm sure there are restaurants out there who would do justice and live up to the expectations

Their veg makimono goriawase (mixed veg sushi platter) is quite nice.
 Do not try the veg. Japanese pancakes. The tofu-teriyaki is okay.
 I haven't been to the place juat ordered the food home, so i can't speak about the ambience. But honestly guys, why isn't there any dessert?

All around the world, indulging in Japanese food can be an expensive affair. The same is true in Kolkata where traditionally this cuisine has mostly been confined to 5* hotels, since most ingredients aren’t readily available in this part of India and cost of bulk import is often prohibitive. Adding to that, ‘freshness of ingredients’ is a key factor in Japanese cuisine and this factor alone can push up the cost manifold. Therefore, it is heart-warming to see smaller standalone restaurants coming up to give the people of Kolkata a taste of food from the island nation at reasonable prices. And again, it is Southern Avenue, which shines bright in doing so.

Location and parking:

Fuji is located on the 3rd floor of a building on Sarat Bose Road, which has an Airtel store and an IDBI bank on the ground floor .Google maps fumbles to pin point the location and the absence of any big signboard declaring the name ‘Fuji’ adds to the confusion. A note to the management on this-they should provide a clear signage. Parking is free on the adjoining lanes. 

Ambiance:

The small lift takes you to the Japanese themed restaurant on the 3rd floor. Besides the normal chairs and tables, there is also a Japanese Seiza styled seating area with chabudai tables at one end. The shoji panels on the walls, the tatami floor mats and the zabuton cushions complete the Japanese look.

Food: 

We went in for lunch and ordered the following-

Chicken Wonton Soup:
Wontons in a traditional clear broth. The wantons were thin-skinned, silky and flavourful .Note to readers- if you like your soup broth to have robust flavours, this is not the one to order. Note to the chef- please add an option of Pork to the choice of wonton filling. 

Mixed Yakitori Moriawase platter of 5 skewers in Teriyaki style- It contained one each of prawn, bacon, minced meat and two of chicken skewers. Each one was flavourful. Special mention to the bacon skewer, as bacon is always tricky to do up correctly. But to their credit, the bacon was crispy and juicy without being too chewy.

Kolkata Maki- Prawn Tempura inside maki rolls served with wasabi and gari(pickled ginger).They serve the soy sauce in beautiful little ceramic pots. The sushi rice was packed well and ensured that there wasn’t any disintegration while picking up the maki pieces by the beautiful chopsticks they provide. The combination tasted good. However I would have liked if they sliced their gari a tad thinner.

Salmon nigiri- 2 pieces of raw salmon cut and presented beautifully over balled rice at the correct temperature .The colour, texture and taste of the fish was good. I could not detect any unwanted smell at all.

Kaisen Yakisoba- Pan sautéed noodles with seafood and vegetables. The veggies were crunchy and flavourful. There was a good quantity of seafoods like prawn,octopus,etc in it. However,a larger portion size overall would have been appreciated. 

Service: We were waited upon by a gracious Nepalese lady wearing a traditional kimono. She was very helpful in explaining the dishes and helping us in the ordering process.

Billing: Rs 1200 for two, as stated in Zomato, is being too optimistic. IMO, for 2 persons with medium appetite, one should keep a budget of about Rs.2500 (without any drinks).

They also have a well-maintained clean washroom.

Will be back in future to try out their Sashimis and other mains.

Fuji is located at Sarat Bose road. I'd been visited with my friends for tasting Japanese Food. Ambiance is good and it was also decorated by Japanese style. Here we ordered Mocktails like 1. Virgin Mojito 2. Cinderella. Both Mocktails are Good.& Some Alcoholic drinks like Beer and Whiskey.Then we ordered Stater like 1. One Skewer Prawn & 4 Skewer Chicken. 2.Chicken pan fried Gyoza 3. Tori karrage 4. Spicy Shake Kawa. All stater are delicious and Mouth watering. Then we ordered Main Course like 1. Yasai Kakiage Soba (it was noodles item)2. Tori Yakimeshi (it was Japanese Fried Rice) 3.Tori Teriyaki. 9All main course are average taste. Overall experience was Good and price was little expensive.

Homely ambience. Very friendly and polite staff. Went to try the sushis. Ordered the non- veg makimono sushi platter. Two out of the three varieties of sushi on the platter were disappointing. Atleast to a sushi fan like me.  The onion tempuras have room for improvement too. Not complaining about this place but not going back either. The search for good sushis in Kolkata continues.

Fuji - sigh. What do I even say about this place? It's such a beautiful restaurant, and its visual appeal is only second to the food served there. I come back here time and time again to take off my shoes and sit in the shaded nook in the middle of the restaurant. I appreciate the amout of effort they put into the ambiance, especially at the price points it comes at! The sushi is quite possibly the best in the city, though the quantity seems less than other sushi places. The soy is low-sodium, and the wasabi nice and tart. The pickled ginger is a little overwhelming though, probably because they don't use baby ginger for it. 
Come here for a non-fussy take on Japanese cuisine. However, I'm disappointed in their sashimi. I tried the tuna sashimi I think, and it was tough and rubbery and chewy.

Visited the place for Sunday lunch on 18.6.17. Since we reached early the restaurant was empty. Ambiance and decor has a Japanese touch though not a big restaurant. Eating area was bit hot as the central AC wasn't working except for a split AC. Discomfort notwithstanding we ordered 2 appetizers - Salmon fry Taru taru & Buta Negima Yakitori ( grilled pork in sauce served n skewers ). Salmon fry was crispy but wished a little more salmon to be in it. Grilled pork was soft and succulent and tasted great, so repeated this order. In main course ordered Non veg Makimono Moriawase sushi platter & Tori Ykisoba ( pan fried wheat noodles with chicken n vegetables). Sushi was awesome and the noodles were good too. In beverages ordered pineapple blossom. For two total billing was Rs 3660 which is pricey. But then Japanese cuisine is supposed to be expensive so was prepared!

It was a different experience with different type of food having for the first time. Beautiful ambience , felt like coming to  Japanese village. Staffs are also dressed in Japanese clothes. Now coming to the food  we ordered teka maki and prawn nigri sushi and one mocktail cindrella.  Mocktail was excellent. I have sushi for the first time and experience was not overwhelming. Nigri sushi was fine. But teka maki was very disappointing. Those who like Japanese food definitely visit here.

This is the only authentic Japanese restaurant in Kolkata. Being a Japanese food lover, I absolutely love this place! The food is very good as well as the ambience and over all setting. From wide range of sushis, to ramen, and mouth-watering appetizers, there's always new things to try. Their Buta Kakuni Miso and Soyu ramen, Ebi Tempura and Yaki Soba are just perfect! One should try the Green tea ice cream for the dessert. It's really good. It takes a bit time for the food to arrive, but overall, Fuji is always a pleasant experience.

The place is very cozy and nice. But honestly, Japanese food didn't go well with me. Also, the food here is pretty overpriced. I probably won't try Japanese ever again, as I didn't like the raw fishes used in traditional Japanese dishes. Then again, its not the restaurant's fault, that's just how the dishes are. Their happy hours offer is great. I had a Mai Tai cocktail which was well made as well. Overall, the restaurant would be a great experience for someone who loves Japanese food, but alas that person isnt me.

This used to be one of our favourite places and was utterly disappointed at how it has deteriorated! It has turned into quite a Bangali Japanese joint. We ordered Nigiris and what we got was fish on top of a 'graash of bhaat'. Literally. Average quality of fish on a lump of loose medium grain rice. We went on to order Pork and Veggies, Sticky rice and Chicken Teriyaki. The pork and vegetables (I forget the name) was a stir fry with cabbage, capsicum and carrot. Only the chowmein was missing! The sticky rice was, well, just rice and the teriyaki was a cutlet doused with some bad sweet sauce. I understand a bad day but this is unbelievable. Hope the management takes note (I doubt it from the nonchalance of the staff we witnessed), and does something about it. Bad experience.

In the southern part of the city there is this one Japanese restaurant.  Fuji is conveniently located in the southern Avenue and sarat Bose road crossing. The Prawn Tempura and the Sushi are what according to me makes the place stand out.  The service is however sluggish to say the least.  This place has cozy corners which look cute .

A slice of Japan, amidst the din and bustle of 'city of joy'...

Perhaps that's the way to define "Fuji", the small yet humble japanese restaurant at 'Sarat Bose Road' where one can get to taste some authentic japanese cuisine... be it with friends or family!!

Even, the place is perfectly suitable for couples as well, so as to spend some quality time, over some delectable dishes, amidst the peaceful ambience they have!!

Happy Eating 😊

Visited the place for a second time and not happy at all. The initial pork stir fry: Buta Itai Isame, was something I could have made at home. Buta Negima Yakitori: grilled boneless pork and leak on skewers was yummy. Kushiage Moriawase: crumb fried assorted skewers, was also quite good. By this time we were so full that we skipped the sushi etc and jumped into main dishes. 
The shio ramen was rather disappointing. Ramen is supposed to have the fattiest pork possible. Unfortunately as in almost every place in Kolkata, the pork in this ramen too was lean. I just dont get it. Are they too concerned about our cholesterol? If I am eating pork I am not really concerned about the fat content am I? crazy! Also the soft egg that is added to ramen is one of the most meticulously prepared boiled eggs worldwide, with multiple marinations etc. Here, it was just a simple boiled egg. The noodles were good but the broth didnt taste anything special. 
The Tori Yakimeshi was good. Stir fried steamed rice mixed with vegetables, chicken and egg. Overall, I dont think I will visit again. Didn't get the special taste that I get from Japanese food world over.

I could not wait to write this one. I am a MASSIVE admirer of Japanese cuisine. The day I knew about Fuji's existence I just had to go. And it was worth the effort! To try as much as possible, we started with two maki rolls: the salmon and the chicken teriyaki. Both fantastic! The rice was properly cooked and rolled which is where most places go wrong. The next course was the Okonomiyaki with chicken. The pancakes were simply perfection. Fuji happens to have miso ramen which incidentally is my favorite kind so I just had to have that. The broth was minimal and bursting with flavor and the pork was beautifully seasoned. We ended the meal with the wasabi ice cream, which was a new experience for me. Amazing job Fuji! Very impressed!

Everything was tasting as if 3-4days old stuff has been served. The okinuyaki used to be so good but this time it was like a stuffed paratha was served without salt and any seasoning. The staff was definitely courteous nd behaved nicely. I would just like to say whatever reputation u hv,dnt waste it by serving such low graded food.

Coming to the food, we ordered goa maki sushi which was good,but i hv had better. We also tried non veg skewers called yakitori moriawase.this dish comes with five skewers of chicken, bacon, minced meat balls etc. each skewer has a unique taste and the meat succulent.For main course we had ramen which is kind of a soupy noodles. The quantity is substantial and the taste very balanced. We also had watermelon ice tea which was very refreshing. We topped the meal off with wasabi ice cream. I was apprehensive abt it at first but i m glad to have tried it. The heat and flavor of wasabi combined with the coldness is an exceptional mix.its a must try. I am also very satisfied with their service.overall its a must visit place

Calcutta is rich in Asian cuisine, primilarily Chinese. Apart from the numerous Chinese restaurants in every corner of the city, Calcutta also boasts of Japanese. There are only a handful of restaurants that serve Japanese cuisine but when it comes to authentic Japanese, the only name that comes up is Fuji. Fuji was long in my wishlist and finally my visit happened to this place by an invitation for bloggers meet. We generally have the assumption of limiting Japanese cuisine to sushis and raw fish only. Fuji is one such place where you’ll actually be startled to find such a huge variation in Japanese food. Besides, ‘Fuji’ has two meanings – Fuji is the name of a famous Japanese flower which is called Wisteria. It is considered auspicious and is traditionally used during celebrations such as wedding, birth of a child, and also during various festivals. Secondly, Mt. Fuji is a symbol of Japan and whenever, we see or hear about Japan, we come across Mt. Fuji and that is one of our objectives, which is to become a symbol of Japan and Japanese food.

Anyone who knows me knows that I live to eat, and that Oriental food is my weakness. But, inexperienced as I am in the department of food, my Oriental experiences have so far been limited Chinese and Thai food only. And, I’m pretty sure I’m yet to discover most of the wonders of these two cuisines. For some reason, I have always been a little scared of Japanese food. I have let myself nurse the stereotype that Japanese food means Sushi, which again means raw food; I have done nothing to change grow out of this. But recently, I had the opportunity to visit a restaurant in Kolkata that not only introduced me to the other sides of Japanese food, but also to the goodness of sushi! The authentic Japanese food at Fuji opened a whole new door to Oriental cuisine.

Wanted to taste sushi and other japanese dishes so opted this one and was throughly disappointed.
First about the price. It says 1200 for 2 but beware thats nowhere near truth. Maybe the figure should be reversed ie 2100 might have been more like it. Pricey stuff which does not justify the quantity. Tried their nugiri sushi (octopus and prawn), never gonna do that again. It was like some tiny donation served on a plate. Next was Gohan(sticky rice) and again the quantity was so small. Only thing that tasted good was Tori Tsukune Yakitori.
Decor and service was nice. The place is small but inside the arrangement is not cramped. Clean place with arrangements present to eat like japanese people, take off your shoes and sit on comfy cushion.

Coming to the food, they serve authentic Japanese food. I never had better Japanese food anywhere in this city! 
I eat a lot of Japanese food, thanks to my brother who works in the Japanese consulate, and this place really impressed me.
Plus we got a complimentary Matcha green tea, so all the more happy! :)

Welcome to Fuji, which is one of the fine dining Japanese restaurants in the city! Thankgod for Fuji, otherwise I wouldn't have had the chance to taste Japanese cuisine.

Located very close to my house, Fuji is one of the crowd pullers of South Calcutta. Sarat Bose Road has very few A grade fine dining restaurants, and Fuji is on of them. It is located near Deshopriyo Park on the 3rd floor of a building which has a grand BAR board lit up in neon lights!

Fuji is not very big, but the way they've put the space to use is commendable. The décor and interior is done up in a way which exudes the authentic Japanese vibes. There is a section which is slightly elevated and has mats for sitting - oh how I loved it!

I was so thrilled to be invited at a food tasting session here, considering I had never tried Japanese food before. I was excited, apprehensive, thrilled - everything at once. So without much ado, let's start talking about the food.

MOCKTAILS :

We were served 3 kinds of mocktails and Jasmine Tea which is is an authentic Japanese tea. The first mocktail to arrive was the Green Eyed Monster which tasted perfect. It had green apple syrup which I absolutely loved. Next came the Watermelon Iced tea. This was a nice twist to your regular lemon/peach iced tea. I liked this one too. Pink Heaven was next which was loaded with Strawberry Crush, pineapple juice and vanilla ice cream. Who doesn't love this, right? Last was the Ocha by the Pot which was flavoured Jasmine Tea served in a pot. It had a mild flavour and soothed my senses.

STARTERS :

• Momo Soup - This rich, flavourful soup had a momo in it, much to my delight! The momo tasted heavenly with its overabundant stuffing and silky skin. Honestly, if you're a soup lover, this one's for you.

• Kolkata Maki - Now came the showstopper of the evening, the Maki Mono Sushis. Honestly I was more than excited and nervous to try out Sushis. And the first to be served was the Kolkata Maki which had prawns rolled into the sticky rice layer. Dip it in wasabi, and dab a bit of ginger and you're done! Amazing, simply amazing! I never thought I would love sushi so much.

• Delhi Maki - The next Maki Mono Sushi was this one which had teriyaki chicken rolled into the sticky rice layer and was served with soya sauce. This tasted equally brilliant, but being a biased lover of prawns, I loved the Kolkata Maki more.

• Prawn Moriawase - This was the Tempura Platter which had prawns, onions and asparagus. I loved the first two. The asparagus tempura just didn't suit my taste buds. The onion tempura was amazing which was like the Japanese version of peyaji, and do I need to say anything about the prawn? Heavenly ofcourse.

MAIN COURSE :

We were served Mixed Yakisoba with Spicy Teriyaki Salmon. The Yakisoba was mixed noodles which had an abundance of meat and veggies and was served to us in traditional Japanese bowls. The Teriyaki Salmon tasted out of this world, literally. It was spicy, saucy, succulent, and everything that you ever wish for. The fish was fresh and juicy. Amazing really!

DESSERT :

The Wasabi Ice-cream was our dreams dessert. It looked amazing and tasted brilliant. Not a fan of wasabi for it extra zing, but never imagined it to be infused in an ice cream. That part really shook me. It'll take time for you to get accustomed to the taste, but once it's done it'll taste fabulous. Word of caution - Don't gulp in too much. Your nostrils will burn. Slow and steady is the way to devour this dessert.

This was our elaborate evening at Fuji, with good food and good company. The experience was fantastic and I'm looking forward to visit it again. The staff is friendly and warm and the way you're greeted by them will make your dining experience better. Honestly, I'll be back at Fuji to try all their Maki Mono Sushis. Never imagined I'd fall in love with Japanese cuisine.
Thank you Fuji. All my love!

Kolkatans are surely fond of experimenting with food. They try out various cuisines, various restaurants, various ingredients while cooking and new recipes from cook books, social media or television while preparing food at home. This fondness has found new wings over the last five years when the food scenario in Kolkata has changed drastically. Bengalis are now fond of Shawarma rolls as much as they love their beloved Chicken kathi rolls! Chicken nuggets have shared the love with Mangsho-r chop and LN2 ice creams have successfully made us drool the same way we drooled for Kulfis! And this acceptance has been widely applauded by the food entrepreneurs and restaurateurs. There has been enough encouragement to carry on and to open up more out-of-the-box eateries presenting amazing recipes, food ideas, food preparation techniques, and cuisines from around the world. However, I must admit the Japanese big daddy of the town ‘Fuji’ is definitely one of the pioneers to lead this food revolution in the city of joy! In fact three years back I was so moved after trying out the food at Fuji, that I decided to take up food blogging more seriously and I realized a wind of change is coming and this is surely going to amend the food scenes in the city, and I must say I was not incorrect. So, how did Fuji inspire me and made me serious about everything revolving ‘round food?

Fuji is located in a bylane on Sarat Bose Road. The decor is very authentic Japanese. Coming to the food we ordered the steamed chicken Gyoza, wonton soup and two sushis- the shake maki and the tuna roll. Really loved the Shake Maki. 

Sushi according to me is an acquired taste. So do give it a go if you want to try something new 🙂

Full disclosure! 
Not a sushi connoisseur. 
Regardless, thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Fuji. 
The restaurant is a little difficult to locate but it definitely is worth the search. 
To begin with what we ordered, 

1. Non veg Makimono Moriawase (Nonveg Maki sushi platter): The quantity of the different kinds of sushi was quite sufficient. We were two people but a third person could easily have shared this. The sushi was served with wasabi and ginger. The ingredients all tasted fresh and came together wonderfully. 

2. Sea food okonomiyaki: this is a Japanese pancake made of noodles and cabbage with seafood. The portions here are quite large. This dish could be eaten as a main course or even an appetizer with your drinks. 

3. Butakakuni miso ramen noodles: Japan and ramen are synonymous. This sumptuous bowl of piping hot noodles is the definition of comfort food. The broth was perfectly seasoned and so so delicious. 
We also ordered their lemon, watermelon and green apple iced teas, in all honesty you could totally give them a pass. 

To talk of the service here, they are very helpful, and very polite and professional. The waitresses will help you decide on what to order if you're confused. 

The ambience of the place is also peaceful. 
You could choose to sit on the tables or also at the traditional Japanese seating arrangements. 

You should definitely give this place a try for an authentic Japanese dining experience.

Don't know enough about Japanese food to comment on the authenticity, but it tasted good and was beautifully presented. Service was courteous and helpful. We had edumame and a sashimi platter, with hot sake and sochu, oh and wasabi ice cream and green tea ice cream.

My husband being a crazy fan of sushi, we ended up landing here for some good Japanese as recommended by friends earlier. Ambience was good with courteous staff. We had a Sushi platter and tempura fried veggies with seafood. The preparations were really good and did justice to the cuisine. Looking forward to visit again.

Often when we eat at a restaurant we never observe the kitchen. With the lovely dishes served infront of us we never think were it came from. The food delivered to me here looked good but the staff member was unlucky because I was sitting just outside their kitchen window. At first I was served my mojito which was terrible. Then, I was gazing outside the kitchen as I was dinning alone and too some extent curious with what's going on. I saw my Yakitori meat was stacked and the meat was put inside of the microwave oven. Then, I saw my Tempura which eventually had a strand of hair which the cooks stopped and that particular piece of prawn was touched by 3 cooks. The teriyaki was terrible, this not a proper teriyaki, rather this was inedible.

Extremely wanna be place. Very weird service crew. The women came and asked me at the end "You want Ice Cream" in a very sarcastic tone, first of she pronunced Mojito as Mogi-Toh and not Mohi-toh, then the cooks are always playing with themselves serves are talking loudly.

Kolkata still needs the taste of authentic Japanese food.

This is the 3rd time I tried Japanese food and the third such restaurant.
This turned out to be a fine dining in the truest sense.

To go with what we ordered:

Chicken wanton soup : its a clear soup with wantons which look like silk gowns. Have it in your mouth and feel the taste and smooth texture of the wantons. The taste is so exotic and wonderful.

Goa maki: these were served with ginger and wasabi. These melted in the mouth and the various flavours mix in your mouth and give you the wonderful experience the distinct flavours mixing up.

Teriyaki chicken: my outlook for teriyaki changed today. The chicken strips were fried in a matter which if you eat just like that wound taste very bland but the moment you dip them in the steaming teriyaki sauce, the sauce gets soaked in and on having it, it's magic.

Yaki udon : it was a bowl of wheat noodles served with vegies, mushroom and chicken. The quantity was huge. Its the main course. The taste was great.

The ambience of this place was serene. The waitress is the charm. She will serve your dishes with utter gentleness and care, that you will get the feeling that it is food and it is something respectful being presented. Even while taking away your used plates and bowls on a tray, she will arrange them gently without any clanging noise.
Japanese food is eaten slowly and not in a hurry. No one told me this but I was made to feel it by her and I actually happened to experience the food solely concentrating on the food without talking much. She helped us learn the art of eating with the chopsticks.
The chefs are Japanese and you can see them creating magic in their kitchen through the glass panes. The waitress is also Japanese and greets you with Japanese pleasantries but converses in English and Hindi.
I thank you Fuji for making us experience Japanese cuisine so exquisitely prepared and served, and the wonderful Japanese culture through food.

We visited Fuji on Valentine's day and being a big fan of Japanese cuisine, we just had to go there. We arrived there around 7pm on 14th of February and we were probably the first customers there. We were given a seat in the VIP room which had a touch of the Japanese culture. As it is the whole restaurant itself had a touch of Nipon, starting from the how it looked like from outside with the kitchen where you can see the chefs, the waitress wearing japanese kimono to greet us and also, the furnitures are low-seating, one of the key aspects of the Japanese culture. We were made to open our shoes before we enter the VIP room. To be honest, we thought Fuji might be having a Valentine's day special but the manager didn't inform us about it at all. Also it was a bit difficult to communicate with the manager as he was not that strong in English but nevertheless, he was really helpful and we gave him a big tip at the end. 

We ordered a lot of food items, including ocha tea and Wasabi ice cream. We personally did not like the Wasabi ice cream at all. But we loved the taste of tendon. Sushi and sashimi tasted great.

Would love to come back here again!

AAAAHHH SUSHI!!
This place will really give you a Japanese feel, and even more delicious Japanese food.
Make sure to sit inside, instead of the normal dining tables, if they so permit. 
Service is A1. All sushi dishes are very well made and will definitely live up to the expectations you have when they reach your table, once they reach your palate. 
RAMEN is the other dish I would strongly recommend. It's typical Japanese food and it is absolutely yummy. A bowl of hot noodles with soup and sprouts, egg, and sweet corn. Try it! 
If you're near lake stadium or deshapriya park, make it a point to visit this place. 
The only drawback, is that it'll be a hard pinch in your pocket if you choose to dine here. But believe me, it is totally worth it!

Mount Fuji. Now don't deny you didn't think about it when this name pops up in restaurants' list.
While on the contrary, this joint is so inconspicuous to locate, that it might serve as an antonym to the figurative image of its name.
However this is probably the only place serving authentic Japanese cuisine exclusively. Veiled behind shops and bank, a stairway leads you to little Fuji. As you step in, it completely separates you from the outside hustle with its mellow ambience.
Tatami mats on floor, the low key walls accompanied with a bar with paper umbrellas and jingling bottles exudes an ameliorate Japanese vibes. Not to forget the Kimono worn ladies serving you humbly, and classic low seating arrangements contributing to the very aesthetics of a Japanese eatery.

Now to begin the tale of chow; let's list it.
Shime Shiba Sashimi: This dish isn't your forte unless you really have a versatile and adaptive palate. Raw vinegared mackerel cut into pretty diagonals, served with soy, wasabi and vegetables is surely vibrant to look at. The strong meaty bites can remind you of the flavour of raw Ilish, which I've never had. However the taste can be modified slightly on the positive side by dressing it with lemon and dipping it in soy stirred with Wasabi. You either like it or you don't, to be honest. I have had mixed feelings being a first timer.
Tori Teriyaki: Teriyaki and Yakitori are two categories of dishes that you can rely on blindfolded. You know they will taste good no matter what and is always a savior of taste buds. Unskinned chicken grilled to perfection and glazed with Teriyaki sauce and served with complementing mashed potatoes looks as scrumptious as it tastes. Show stealer as always!
Yaki Udon: Trying out Udon and how it is different from normal noodles have always played around my mind. Thicker than your regular noodles, this wheat noodles along with veggies and chicken dices, greased with Japanese sauces and pan sauted was wee bit of a downer for me. It tasted okayish and filled a lot of stomach quota.

Had two cocktails as accompaniment.
Shirley Temple: Rather yum than the typical alcoholic bitterness, was tantalizing. Ginger ale, spalshed with grenadine and garnished with orange juice, was made with artifice.
Cosmopolitan: Classic cocktail. The orange flavour of triple-sec, cranberry juice and fresh lime along with vodka giving a tangy-sweet-bitter taste was a refresco.

Definitely a place to recommend, with few disclaimers being your adaptation to various cuisines, specially Japanese since they like to incorporate rawness into their food. Also the pocket pinch is slightly on the higher side. Nevertheless, the authenticity is a very positive factor to welcome you to this place, more than once.

This place hosted in a small but well decorated place serves authentic Japanese food in the heart of the city. The ambiance matches the cuisine and is completed with Japanese low-seating arrangements and the waiters dressed up in that attire. The food served is excellent in its presentation and tastes pretty awesome.  I will suggest you go ahead with the platter, the Non-Veg Makimono Moriawase gives you the option to try out different Maki Sushis. The Butakakuni Miso Ramen is also one of my favorites from the menu which comes with the most amazing pork in it. End your meal with the different ice creams they have. Wasabi Ice cream is a must try. A real treat to your taste buds. Overall good food and great hospitable service. Prices are a little on the higher side but totally worth it.

Fuji is the latest offering in the current craze over Japanese cuisine in our City of Joy...and quite a good one i would say! The decor of the place is very cute, with the waitress wearing traditional Kimono, small Japanese artifacts on the tables and even 2 zashiki (traditional Japanese low seating arrangement). If you want a quick bite or are clueless about what to order, I would recommend these

Miso Soup: A soyabean flavoured soup with Japanese spices. Try this for quite a unique change of taste!

Jonogiri 7 Kan (Nigiri): While there were quite a few Nigiri options to choose from, try this one for a comprehensive tasting of their range. This is a platter of 7 different kinds of non-veg Nigiris containing one each of Salmon, Tuna, Prawn, Octopus, Squid, Salmon Roe and Basa. The fishes in the sushis were very fresh and perfectly cured! Loved the Salmon and the Tuna ones! 

Tuna Maki rolls - I have not tasted such fresh tuna anywhere in Kolkata. I would have liked it more, if it had a bit more of the tuna and lesser of the rice, though.

Try it with their fiery wasabi and soya to enjoy the best!

One suggestion, the ginger strands should have been a tad softer and not chewy.

Being a sushi lover, I always keep on looking for restaurants serving this Japanese delicacy. A friend of mine recommended Fuji, and she gave rave reviews of how good the sushi is there. I looked up on Zomato and saw that they deliver to my address. So I ordered Kaisen Yakisoba and Salmon Skin Roll. They delivered within the delivery time window. Kaisen Yakisoba is a pan fried noodles with sea food, squid, shrimp, octopus and was amazing in taste. The Salmon Skin Roll was mouth watering. Soon will be ordering other types of Sushi from Fuji. Pan Asian food lovers Fuji is a must try.

A very warm and nice experience we had.
Starting from the ambience,its pretty sober and neat with a touch of japanese art.
Next the people over there were very well behaved and quite cooperating.
Lastly,the dishes were fingerlicking good starting from the  starter till the desert.
The pocket pinch was also quite normal as we visited during the happy hours

As of today, this is essentially the only specialty Japanese restaurant in Kolkata. Which is a shame, given the worldwide fame and popularity of Japanese cuisine.

I am a fan of small boutique restaurants as they are often run by people passionate about a certain kind of food and the restaurants they open reflect their passion. This appears to be one such place located on the third floor of a house and decorated with Japanese motifs. I liked the decor as well as their food. Both the dishes I tried, the sushi (tuna nigiri) which comes with the usual accompaniments of super pungent wasabi paste, ginger etc. and the donburi  with pork cutlet were quite good. Prices are slightly on the higher side, but well, decent Japanese food can never be very cheap. Especially in Kolkata where they have to import basically all their ingredients. 

I desperately hope that people in Kolkata will start to experiment with different types of cuisine and expand their limited palate. I desperately hope that other restaurants like this one will follow.

It's a pity that I chose to visit the place just after the news of demonetisation hit the country. The experience, accordingly, wasn't a very pleasant one. 

Eager to try out authentic Japanese cuisine, which Fuji is very famous for, I visited it with a friend for dinner. The place isn't difficult to find, with the shining lights showing you inside a building, from where you take the lift to the 3rd floor for the restaurant. 

The place isn't a big one and is cramped for space. The sitting arrangements, however, have been subtly done, with provisions to sit without your sandals - the Japanese way. There's also a room inside, where a few more chairs and sofas have been stashed. So much authenticity that they have even dressed up a waiter in Kimono! 

Coming to the food, I have absolutely no clue about Japanese cuisines and asked the waiter to choose for us. So here goes my order: 

1. Virgin Mojito : What can I say about this? What can possibly go wrong with a Mojito? It's my personal favourite. 

2. Yakitori Moriawase : These is basically a skewers platter, with prawn and chicken mostly, grilled and salted or teriyaki style. Pretty good I would say. 

3. Maguro Nigiri (Tuna Shushi) : I realised I am definitely not meant for this. Even though I have had sushi before, with not much fondness, the accompanying Wasabi and soya sauce made it worse. The Wasabi might just leave you gasping for breath for a minute! 

Before I could order more, the adjacent table had a problem paying with card, since the machine wasn't working. And since I wasn't carrying cash either, I had to stop there. Well, the worst part is that I had to stand in the ATM queue opposite, to draw out money to money. Perks of demonetisation, eh? Even though I can't exactly blame the authorities, that most definitely didn't count to a pleasant experience.

Avocado Roll and Spicy Mushroom Roll - Veg sushi rolls which were really good once paired with the Wasabi. 

Yasai Gyoza - Pan fried Dumplings which were okayish. Definitely not a must order. 

Yasai Kakiage Udon - Noodles in soy bean sauce with Yasai Kakiage on top. Yasai Kakiage is a shredded vegetables Tempura. While this was huge on quantity,  the blandness in this just didn't sit well with us. My spicy and zingy expectations from a Ramen were set by other restaurants which this didn't live up to. 

Vegetable Maki - Easily the dish of the day. Filling and tasty.

Concealed and inconspicuous, Fuji doesn't impose itself externally. In fact it was quite difficult to pin down its location. However like some few classy eateries, one shouldn't allow second thoughts to cloud in till you're welcomed into the place.

Exquisite and dainty decor to greet you, the ambience isn't exactly awe-inspiring. It carries more of an 'ease-into' vibe topped with a layer of what Japanese would essentially refer to as 'kawaii'. So as the little touches of tatami mats, the paper board walls, the  the Japanese umbrella above the bar emanated an authentic Japanese experience, we settled on the normal tables rather than opting for the Japanese traditional low seating arrangement. 

Keeping up with the decor, the staff dressed in Japanese formals (kimono) were hospitable and exemplary in service. Low and peaceful tunes accompanied the short wait.

And now, for the dishes.

Started with Shime Saba Sashimi. Visually entrancing with veggies, this Japanese delicacy based on vinegared Mackerel emphasizes the pure smooth meaty flavour of the fish. Quite reminiscent of of our regional Ilish, the natural goodness is further enhanced by seasoning it lightly with soy sauce after dabbing the provided wasabi onto the pieces of the sashimi. Leaves a tranquil aftertaste without relying on spices and is quite appetizing.

Next onto Tori Teriyaki. A finger-licking delectable dish dulcified with good ol' teriyaki sauce. Moist and tender boneless chicken with skin on grilled to finesse, it has an enthralling lustre that one can never have enough of it. *Over-delicious Alert System*. Undoubtedly the best part of our course.

And then came the steaming Yaki Udon. Pan sauteed wheat noodles with chicken and veggies in Japanese sauces, somehow it didn't stand out. Palatable but stuffed us pretty heavy with the quantity provided. 

Finally, the drinks. Cosmopolitan, dwelling mainly on the essence of cranberry juice and vodka, added a bit of subtleties with the Cointreau and lemon. Overall balanced in harmony. And Shirley Temple- nectarous with the fruity orange juice, it sweetened us up.

A bit pricey, but with the variety available, if you're looking for something different and interesting- this is the place. Holding the baton of Japanese cuisine in Kolkata, Fuji is definitely a place one should try out.

Gonna visit again. After all I'm pretty enthusiastic to try the other dishes. 🙂

We took 1 soup,1 chicken momo, 1 vodka (30ml), one Mumbai something sushi (which is basically crab and prawn) and another non veg sushi and our total bill was around 2k. Great food,the staff is really sweet,and the ambience is nice n calm.  👌

Good heavens. I went inside with no idea bout Japanese food. One thing lingered in head was sushi. The place is small and cozy. We took the corner special Japanese Dinner seats. 
With the help of waiter there we ordered a sushi and a chicken dish. Along with a virgin mojito. The food was beyond expectations and delectable. 
Service was quick. Staff is helpful. 
It's a must visit if you wanna try different cuisine.you shouldnt be disappointed.

AFTER PREVIOUSLY RATING THIS ESTABLISHMENT 4 HAVE BEEN FORCED TO BRING IT DOWN TO 3 AFTER MY VISIT Last NIGHT. THE FOOD IS STILL GREAT BUT THE SERVICE STILL SUCKS. WE PAYD BY A ICICI CARD BUT THE CASHIER FORGOT TO INCLUDE THE DISCOUNT AMOUNT THOUGH WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED BEFORE. THE SERVER Then SAID THAT HE WILL CREDIT OUR DISCOUNT IN OUR NEXT VISIT . WHEN WE ASKED FOR THE CASHIER THE PERSON CAME IN AND SAID ITS AGAINST THEIR POLICY AND A WHOLE LOT OF BULLSHIT. THIS IS THE SAME SERVER WHO WAS RATHER CURT WITH US LAST TIME. IF YOUR SERVER CANNOT Handle CLIENT INTERFACE MAYBE HE IS BETTER OFF IN THE BACK OFFICE. I DONT KNOW WHAT WILL BE REPORTED TO THE MANAGEMENT BUT TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED . 
 Loved the Japanese stand alone restaurant in Sarat Bose road though far more expensive than wall which offers similar cuisine across the road. It's located on the top floor of building but fear not it has an elevator. The décor is minimalist and loved the separating Japanese screens. We orderd the sushi platter which was excellent, a glazed platter with something akin to a BBQ sauce on it., Must try the cherry tomatoes wrapped in bacon. The pork dish we tried was very tender . Had a ramen to top it all off and a beautifully flavoured rice with chicken. Excellent food every which way. Now for the downers. Service is questionable. Japanese food comes out of the kitchen quick and we were served very promptly . However we weren'tnt served drinking water even after we had been served our starter's and had to ask for it. There are no mats on the table and no coasters for drinks as a result the table quickly becomes a mess with the condensation from the drinks. And getting the server's to clean the table takes a while. Also of you are sitting on raised platforms then server's need to remove their shoes to get to you which is a serious impediment for seamless service. Like This is a plain design flaw . In the raised platforms there are two tables . Having a passage cut out between the two would have given the server's easy access. Or maybe even grass slippers with socks for servers . We weren't amused by the very Curt server either but it could have been a one off. Go on a weekday and dig in.

We ordered spicy mushroom maki and an assorted vegetable tempura.
The ambience is fine and the lighting good. The service is quick.
The mushroom makis were served with mayonnaise on the top which was a turn off for me. Also the sushi rice was a bit harder than expected. The mushroom filling though was great. I would like have loved the sushi more has the rice been a little more softer and stickier.
The tempura was served hot alongside a sweet sauce which was great and mashed daikon radish.Except the potato tempura, I loved all m my favourite being b by the bell pepper and onion ones.
Recommended.

Not a review for vegetarians

I went to this restaurant twice and had different items, so I thought I might as well review it. Its my first review so it is gonna be a bit sketchy.

Firstly the decor and atmosphere are very warm and made us feel welcome and peaceful. It is essential a restaurant like this gives you a feeling of calmness because it is supposed to be a niche dining experience and Fuji does that. So thumbs up.

The service is good if not great. the waiters are very responsive and food arrives with a 15-20 minute window. One complaint is though when we went there for the first time we did order a starter and a main course but both were served simultaneously, which shouldnt be done unless specifically asked for so thats a little negative. 

As for the food, yes its delicious. Is it authentic enough? Well I am not japanese so I cannot say for sure, but to me the food seemed distant form Indian spicy food and having a little knowledge of Japan I am inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt.

In starters had tempura chicken. The tempura batter was beautiful. Light aerated and crispy and very thin, just the way it is supposed to be, the chicken was tender and cooked to perfection as well. I am not fond of raw stuff and have seafood allergies so I tried Delhi maki sushi which has cooked chicken inside, and all I can say was it was good. The rice was soft and sticky, the sauce on top had a distinct flavour with an aftertaste of nolen gur but savory(this sauce was served with the tempura as well), and the chicken inside tasted good even if the quantity of chicken was very small.

Then in main course we ordered chicken miso ramen and chicken and pork yakisoba noodles. the miso ramen was unbelievably light on palate and so much that most Indians will have to add soy sauce to make it palatable, however if you do that it becomes an incredible combination of flavours, and the slight salty and earthy miso soup is delicious to drink from the bowl. The vegetables were cooked well and there was plenty of chicken to eat. The yakisoba was more of pan fried chicken hakka noodles. While it was incredibly tasty and the pork very tender, I did not see any specific taste difference to the chinese version of it, maybe its supposed to be like that. 

Then we had the wasabi ice cream which was a revelation. A stunning combination of savoury coldness with a hint of sweetness was like an explosion of flavours on the palette, a must try for people who like to experiment.

Even with such high praise why do I rate the restaurant a 4 and not 5/5? Well it has flaws, one already mentioned and the second being the buta negima yakitori which I had when I went there for the first time. The pork was overcooked in places , it was chewy and dry even when the sauce was overwhelmingly tasty. And overcooking / undercooking meat garners for point deduction.
 Also when we asked for beer they only had Kingfisher premium and nothing else. While I am nitpicking, since rest of it was so good, I have to be harsh.

So overall this is a fantastic Japanese restaurant if a tad bit overpriced(can be easily forgiven since its a niche) so you can try it once at least and decide for yourself.

This restaurant is one hidden gem of Kolkata. 
When i saw the outer look i was a little disappointed, but it was the only thing that was disappointing. 
The ambience, the courtesy of the staff, the menu, the quality and taste of the dishes was all amazing.
The sushi was well prepared. 
I was satisfied with the dinner but im not done visiting the place and would love to visit it again.

You really have to approach this place with an open mind if you have never tried Japanese cuisine. They have got a really authentic feel to the place with the cutlery and the staff serving at the place. We had four different kinds of dishes.
1st of all I wouldn't recommend the sushi. I do not know how it's supposed to taste. But it certainly didn't taste good in any degree.
But the 3 other dishes, chicken on skewers, okiminiyaki and and rice and chicken meal dish( don't remember the Japanese name for the dish). Now these were xompleteky different stories. Distinctly different in taste in a good way. I would recommend the okiminiyaki to anyone, for sure.
A special mention to the lady who assisted us in ordering the dishes. An extra star for that. She was really courteous and very comprehensive about the dishes we were having. She even put up a mini demonstration on how to have the sushi.
Looking to go back here to try the other interesting dishes they might have.

Fuji was highly recommended by few of my friends in kolkata, for their Japanese cuisine and esp sushi. I went with a lot of expectations, sadly it failed to deliver. We had salmon and tuna sushi, chicken tempura and a soy sauce based noodle. The chicken in both noodle as well as the tempura were semi cooked. Sushis too were average, I had much better sushi in delhi restaurants, or in manali for that matter. Easily can be missed. The 3.0 rating is more for the cozy ambience.

Japanese cuisine at its best truly!! Though a lil overpriced but the food was worth every penny spent.. located on sarat bose road this restaurant is a must visit for japanese cuisine lovers..
Today, me and a friend of mine visited this restaurant.. we were greeted very well as we stepped inside.. they gave us a very cozy seat which is left to the entrance... the ambience of the restaurant was nice and subtle..
Now, coming to food..
At first we ordered the goa makki sushi ( spicy salmon rolls).. one of the tastiest sushi i have ever tasted.. it tasted extremely good..
Then we took the the chicken miso ramen which is the authentic japanese noodle..
Well, this was the first time i tasted japanese cuisine.. and i am in love with it.. really fuji did a justice to my taste buds.. it was extremely tasty.. soya sauce flavoured soupy noodles with chicken, vegetables and corns. Along with these foods.. we ordered chilled beer which was a good companion with these foods.. the ramen noodle tastes best with the spices they provide with the food.. overall, it was an overwhelming experience... really looking forward to this amazing place again..

I visited the restaurant on 25th Sept, 2016 with my two friends. Its located near Sarat Bose Road Post office beside airtel shop. It is in the 3rd floor of the building so you can avail elevator.
Tell you what we are great fans of Japanese culture and food and we were awed by the food, ambiance, sitting, courtesy . It was my first experience of a complete Japanese food . And I loved it.
So Lets start the review:
i. Sitting arrangements:- the arrangements were really nice giving Japanese feel. They have three different types of sitting arrangements. 1. Normal restaurant style 2. completely Japanese style (where you can sit with your legs folded. 3. semi Japanese in a room of Tatami mats and the chairs are low.

ii. Welcoming:- when you enter the restaurant the chefs and the waiters welcome you in Japanese. It was very pleasant.

iii. The Menu:- The menu is in English but the meanings are in Japanese (Romaji). So you might need some help from the waiter if you cant understand the meaning. 

iv. The Food:- The food was authentic Japanese delicacies . We had Tori Momo Yakitori, Chicken Gyoza, Shake Maki, Tori Yakisoba and Ramen(forgot the actual variance). The food was awesome. 
 a. Shake Maki is a Sushi with fish and rice and served with pickled ginger and wasabi. We also added some  soya sauce. It was delicious.
 b. Chicken Gyoza is  chicken momo in simple language. We had it with soya sauce. and the taste was   awesome. two sticks of grilled chicken of 4 pieces served with soya sauce and we loved it too. 
 c. Momo Yakitori istwo sticks of grilled chicken of 4 pieces served with soya sauce and we loved it  too. 
 d. Tori Yakisoba is noodles cooked with vegetables, chicken and one very tasty sauce and it had no oil in it.  actually all the food had no oil in it. mmmmmmmmm, it was savouring and tasty.
 e. Ramen is kind of soupy noodle in case you dont know what it is. it had noodles, vegetables, chciken, and  egg. Being a Naruto fan, always wanted to taste genuine Ramen. and I loved it. 

iv. The Cost:- The restaurant is not very cheap but it cost us around Rs. 2200 for all that. Though it was not wholesome. But we just not eat to full ourselves. 

v. Value Card:- After all that we got one Loyalty card which got Rs. 1200 of which we can multiple of Rs. 500 in our next visit . So Rs. 1000 is saved from our next bill. hahaha which is an added benefit we got after all the tasty foods.

vi. Ambiance:- . The cooks were head bands the way you see in movies and animes and were in Japanese attire and as I said earlier, the ambiance is very good and has a Japanese feel with the Tatami Mats and when we entered into our room to have the food, we were asked to remove the shoes which a Japanese way of entering a room .It was fully A.C. with Japanese Music in background and had a TV where Ind V NZ Match was going on. 

vii. The Bar:- It also has a bar with various drinks. and you have the drink in your table as well. But  we decided not to drink cuz it was lil costly.(we can enjoy drinks at less price somewhere else too. right?) we went there for the foods and we loved it. it also had mocktails in case any of you wanted to know.

viii. Service:- The waiter was very courteous and i had planned a small birthday party for my friend so I gave them just the cake and as told they brought it with candles on. after that we started our lunch. and as were finished with one dish, they took the empty plates and bowls and brought the new dish. So the experience was very nice and very gentle. 

Over all we all had a very nice experience. adding some pics of the dishes. My suggestion will be a must go to all the Japanese food lovers and also to all who wanna try authentic Japanese delicacies.

A vegetarian at a Japanese restaurant confused as to what to eat and what to leave! What a situation to be in! #melikey ! You will be confused so best to get the servers help! You must as they know what is fresh and tastes better! I wanted to taste vegetables skewers in teriyaki sauce but if was disappointing .. The sauce too sweet and marginal utility declines at a faster rate with every bite! But then you get a plate of mushroom sushi and they are made so right so yumm ... No one can eat just one :p ! But the showstopper are the ramen noodle pancakes okinomiyaki must try veg or non veg! Dipped in soya sauce every bite reaffirms your faith in japanese food ! Sushi and this your meal is done! On a separate occasion got  tofu in teriyaki sauce  and the sushi platter delivered. The tofu dish was bad so please avoid ..a big slab of tofu fried in cornflour batter and coated with teriyaki sauce.. Bland !But the Sushi platter was brilliant ... mushroom, cheese and the big sesame coated nigiris were great! Order this if in a big group they serve 16 pieces. 
The meal ended with the ocha tea and wasabi icecream. Have tasted better green tea and better wasabi icecream but try it if you havent ever. The slight hint of wasabi is nice I was expecting it to be stronger! They should try to serve the salads , raw veggies fresher .. But go there if you still wanna try the veg nigiris, sushi and okinomiyaki. They are worth it!
You gotta eat here!

It's a small Japanese restaurant located on the 3rd floor.  Low square tables, the crockery and the décor was all Japanese. We had the sushi platter consisting of Californian sushi, mushroom sushi and cheese sushi. It was well prepared. The gyoza wraps were also well prepared. Had a pan fried noodles dish which was served in bowls. It was mouthwateringly tasty. Didn't really like the savoury pancake dish (okinoyoki). The highlight of the evening was the wasabi icecream. It was sensational. Really enjoyed the experience.

I must admit that my knowledge about Japanese food is quite limited. The only dishes I’ve tried till date are Sushi and Sashimi so when the first Japanese restaurant opened in Kolkata, I was very eager to go and explore more of the cuisine. Fuji is located at 209A Sarat Bose Road and they have an extensive menu with authentic Japanese dishes with reasonable prices compared to the very large portions they serve. The menu is presented by course—appetizers, soups, salads, sashimi/sushi and mains.

One place which i must admit surprised me to no end was this quant little place on the third floor and now regret about not knowing this gem before. From the interiors to the food to kitchen itself , a really honest and commendable effort. The food was spot on, the unagi and sushi being a must haves. A definite recommendation if you are craving japanese in the city.

I am an anime and manga fan , and an absolute lover of the Japanese culture and tradition and what better way to experience the food and culture ? The Fuji , traditional Japanese restaurant and traditional food , made to a level of perfection ! It is so sad to see that people have not yet acquired the fine taste of Japanese cuisine and why blame them , the so called Chinese food in Kolkata is to blame for that. The owner of the restaurant is an absolute delight and such a friendly person , also if you are in Pallavakam , do check out their restaurant too !

Finding authentic Japanese food can be a task in this city. We ran into Fuji while frisking through the Zomato collections. Took us a while to hunt it down through a tiny entrance in a building. But the experience, right from the time we walked in to the time we stepped out, was nothing short of stellar! The ambiance, with its little Japanese windows and quaint and delicate seating, was soothing to say the least. We ordered the Yakitori Moriawase, the Non-veg Makimono Moriawase and the Wasabi Ice Cream. I actually couldn't place my finger on what tasted the best...everything was delectable! The service was brilliant, the decor was so gentle on the eyes and the food was very, very palatable. Easily one of the best places I've had sushi at!

Ever since I got back from my post graduation studies from Singapore, I have been on the search for healthy dining options that actually fulfill the soul and stomach both. Obviously Indian food does the best job at it but let's face it, how many Indian restaurants actually offer healthy dining options among the Indian cuisine. Fuji was recommended to me by my friend who tried their Sushi delivered to his house so we decided to try the place out in person this time. 

Pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome in traditional style and I was actually feeling like I am not even in my city anymore as the staff was also dressed in traditional Japanese clothing. The other diners at the restaurant were expats too. 

They have a full service bar too. We ordered for two plates of chicken and prawn Sushi (Delhi Maki and Kolkata Maki) along with Chicken Gyozas and a portion of Chicken Miso Ramen noodles split into two. Our bill was of Rs. 1900 and we were fully satisfied with the healthy and soul-filling food. 

Great job done by whosoever owns the place. I see a lot of effort went into the place and I will be visiting frequently now.

I was delighted to learn about Fuji as I am a Sushi lover and I believe Kolkata lacks places where one can get good Sushis. Frankly speaking I was not disappointed. The interior is cleanly decorated with not too much of artefacts.  The  food is awesome. Ordered myself a Sushi Platter and loved it. Must try place for Sushi lovers.

Been a hardcore anime and manga lover, was curious for this place. Went on there for having a sudden unplanned lunch at this Saturday with my wifu-chan. Damn! The interior was so cool and homely. I immediately felt like sitting on a Japanese restaurant in Japan itself... Ordered tori-tempura with sashimi. A tangy tasty flavour engulfed my mouth at once! Specially the sauce. Then ordered yaki-udon and teriyaki. Both tasted finger licking good! All of the stuffs are very polite and helpful and the amount and quality they are providing, its amazing! We ordered single plate of everything and we were full up to neck! Worth 100% of your payment... I'll again visit Fuji again and this time with more hunger and expectation...

I am not a great fan of Japanese food so although Fuji is located fairly close to home it took me a while to visit even though I had heard good things about it. Some cousins in town and wanted to eat Japanese so off we went for dinner. Fuji is located on the third floor and while the entrance and building were rather mundane I was charmed the moment we stepped in. Loved the decor and all the little touches like the windows, the Japanese umbrella above the bar, the paintings, the crockery and the option of low seating where you could sit and eat more traditionally.

I am not a great fan of Japanese food so although Fuji is located fairly close to home it took me a while to visit. Some cousins were down from Canada and wanted to eat Japanese so off we went for dinner. Fuji is located on the third floor and while the entrance and building were rather mundane I was charmed the moment we stepped in. Loved the decor and all the little touches like the windows, the Japanese umbrella above the bar, the paintings, the crockery and the option of low seating where you could sit and eat more traditionally. 

I am not particularly big on Sushi but I love Tempura so the first thing we ordered were Ebi Tempura which was five good sized prawns in a perfect crisp batter with succulent prawns perfectly cooked inside. We liked it so much we ended up ordering a second round as well. We also ordered Yasai Tempura Moriawase which was assorted Vegetable Tempura which was quite good. We also ordered a Beer and a couple of glasses of White Wine which went perfectly with our Tempura. This was followed by Chicken Gyoza which we all polished off in record time. 

We were quite full so decided to go easy on the main course. We ordered a Buta Yakisoba which was a delicious bowl of Pan Sautéed Noodles with Pork and assorted vegetables tossed in Japanese Sauces ...... absolutely delicious and light enough after all the fried tempura. We also ordered the Buta Kakuni Miso Ramen which was really nice ... it was a portion of Ramen Noodles cooked in Miso Stock and served up with lovely sliced pork , boiled egg and vegetables and some seaweed to garnish , lovely rustic flavors and the pork was to die for only wish they had been a bit more generous with it ! 

All in all we had a wonderful dinner which I was surprised to enjoy as much as I did. The only thing is the pocket pinch which was rather steep. However for the occasional indulgence worth a visit.

Not being familiar with Japanese cuisine at all, we decided to experiment and immediately made Fuji our choice. I had seen the place a lot of times while visiting Southern Avenue. And so we went on a Saturday evening.

The interiors, seating arrangement and the overall appearance of the place is impressive. The hostess was in a proper Japanese attire (kimono?!) Given a choice to sit at regular dining tables and a somewhat Japanese seating arrangement, we chose the latter.

Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Nanban Tarutaru for starters, and a veg appetizer as well. We also ordered mocktails. The main course was a variant of flat noodles and it was cooked to perfection. The starters were also sumptuous, light and amazingly plated.
The only drawback were the over-sweet beverages.

Overall, it was a great experience, and my introduction to Japanese cuisine was a success, even though we left out the classic Sushi (Sashimi). Hoping to visit again. Two thumbs up!

Being a big fan of Japanese cuisine, I just had to try out Fuji. It gets full marks for its anime soundtrack and it's ambience. Theres even an inner sitting area which you can only enter after removing your shoes. However, the sushi was very average and made with somewhat stale fish (even if it wasn't stale, it was frozen and not fresh). The sushi itself was badly put together. The prawn tempura was very good though. It's worth mentioning that this place have a fairly extensive spread although I wasn't hungry enough to sample anything else when I went.

I’m personally loving the idea that Calcutta has all of a sudden come of age when it comes to trying out all things new in food and although I’m not quite sure what the response has been like for any of the new Japanese places FUJI where I had a great Sunday lunch a few weeks ago — and Japanese was probably the last of the internationally-hyped cuisines to come and have its place in Calcutta. Fuji is next to Macro Polo in Southern Avenue. The entrance is narrow and one can take lift to third floor. The ambiance is like Japanese eatery one have seen in movies. decent decor. Have option of seating like Japanese style in private dining section. I liked private sector very much, very cozy and  peaceful relaxing music will surely make u feel comfortable and attached.

The NON VEG MAKIMONO MORIAWASE 🍱🍣🍤 SHUSHI PLATTER was surprising I must say!! not only the most delicious sushi but also perfectly presented. The sushis were also served with shredded sweet ginger and pure green mustard which I liked the most. Unlike other people had mentioned about how sushi is basically sticky rice and raw fish its taste good , I liked the fact how simple and healthy it is and that it does not taste mind blowing.  [its a myth and rumour that sushi stinks . It's healthy and filled with perfect portion of protine, vitamins and curb. My advice don't judge food until u try 😇]
TORI TARIYAKI  🍡🍢was authentic Japanese preparation. Try this with sticky rice .  
Couldn't try any Dessert as m not very much Dessert person and honestly i dnt wanted to let go that sushi flavour from my mouth :p 
So conclusion is--
Very nice ambiance and service. Try it out for Japanese delicacies. 
Very clean , well behaved trained staff, lil expensive for many people but u can give a try once at least. M sure it will a mind-blowing experience.

After reading all the good reviews I went with my sister for her Bday treat.
Decor is really nice. We could see the chef preparing sushi and all. Nice seating arrangement. And also the staff were nice.

But Very very Disappointed with the food. Wasted a huge amount of money and leaving our taste buds angry. We went during the afternoon time and nobody was there so I guess it was a bad time to visit. Nothing was prepared and we had to wait a bit. The skewers platter with chicken, Pork and Shrimp were all frozen and we had to struggle to get it out of the sticks and all tasted the same. The Ramen was on the good side but still not happy with it. Sushi was ok.

This was my first try on Japanese food but not a satisfactory experience.

Authentic Japanese experience to be precise.
Experience was very new and good. The foods are awesome. Being a lover of Sushi, I opted for it wasting no time. They have a sushi platter, which has all the best sushis that are there. Tastes awesome. Also had a dish which has grilled tuna, salmon, ham, chicken. I am not sure about the name because it was suggested by the waiter.
I specially liked the separate sitting arrangement which is inside. That gives you a real Japanese feeling with the food. Very nice experience. Hospitality was very good.

Visited Fuji recently for dinner. Ordered the Kaisou salad, Salmon sushi, Ebi Tempura (prawn) and Tori Tsukune Yakitori (Chicken). Salad was fantastic and so was the sudhi. Delicious. Tempura was a little bland (but i think it's meant to be that way, using the teriyaki sauce to dip in for flavour). The Yakitori was very spicy and really disappointing. Upon placing the order I instructed the waiter to ensure that it isn't too spicy and this clearly wasn't looked into. Upon mentioning it to the waiter while my mouth burned, he just shrugged. 

Desert was alright - Sesame and green tea ice cream. Can't complain.

NO SAKE. Big downer. Japanese restaurant and no Sake is incomplete.

Music -- very disappointing -- commercial pop numbers from the 2000s ain't right for a Japanese restaurant.

Fuji is not that much good as wat i expected. I had taken ramen with miso soup and pork and  assorted vegetables but it was only with small 5 slice of pork like a parle-g biscuit ther was no vegetables only corn and som sea weeds was thr, and a half portion of an egg nothing more than that with huge quantity of noodles. According to the price of the dish it doesnt suits. Price is too high. Sushi was also not that much perfect. Wastage of money.

A fantastic surprise. Tucked away in the corner of Saratoga Bose Road this Japanese gem is worth a dekko. Beautiful decor with tatami mats and paper board walls exude an authentic Japanese experience. The service is exemplary. The food arriving within minutes of ordering. Now coming to the food- in one word heavenly. The Miso soup has the right amount of tang. The tempura sublime. The wonderfully named Kolkata/Mumbai etc Maki (Maki mono sushi) just that-wonderful. The Ramen comes in a huge bowl with wholesome amount of udon/soba and meat. And the crumb fried salmon with tarutaru sauce blew us away. The only thing perhaps not right up there was the teriyaki which was slightly overdone at parts and underdone at others. Overall an experience which calls for a quintessential Bengali " আবার খাবো" smile.

It might not appear much appealing from outside but once you enter it's a whole other place. The open kitchen and wide seating arrangement provides a decent ambience. Prices are bit high and so is the quantity of their items. No doubt about that this place does offer very genuine Japanese dishes. It's hard to pick favourites here. Would recommend everyone to visit once.

I had their Teriyaki Chicken, Karaage Chicken and a 7 kan Nigiri platter. I was happy that they let me choose the seven types. The atmosphere was wonderful and it was very refreshing to see a ramen-shop style sitting are with the cooks on the other side in the middle of Calcutta. Definitely recommend their Sushi - did not seem over preserved or frozen to death. The roe was of good quality too. This or Wasabee? I choose this.

Frozen fish (which has spent a long time being frozen) doesn't make good sushi or sashimi. 
The california roll and it's variations - chennai maki/goa maki etc. are all palatable because of the rice and mayonnaise based sauces. This is a very westernized japanese food experience - not authentic.
The chicken teriyaki is very good, soft and succulent bird with that wholesome teriyaki glaze. All the yakitori (meat or fish on skewers)  preparations are also a good choice here. I also love green tea ice cream (everywhere)
The most affordable Japanese food in the city (while still being remotely japanese).

Found out about the place via Zomato. Read the good reviews, but was oddly shocked on visiting the place. The only good part about the place was the sushi(veg). Tried the tofu triyaki, which turned out to be a bit too on the sweeter end. The Yasai Yakisoba was just too bland to be edible. Really disappointed with the place.

Went yesterday after hearing good things and reading good reviews. Ordered the pan fried seafood ramen, it was anything but Japanese.
I got a bowl of Bengali Hakka chow, filled to the brim with onions and capsicum (Didn't know that was a part of Japanese cuisine).
Extremely disappointed. Packed up the noodles cause it was too depressing to sit and eat a bowl of Rs. 600 Hakka chow I could've bought anywhere at a fraction of the price. Not to mention there was barely any seafood. But then again the seafood would have been overwhelmed by the ton of capsicum and onions anyway. I'm struggling to finish the disgusting plate of noodles today morning cause I'm not wasting that money.

Location- Located in southern avenue just next to the lane of barista and the lane opposite to xrong place and shwarma nation this is place is located at third floor of the building nxt to hdfc bank atm. 
Ambiance- Fiji being a japanease restaurant it has decoration like the japanese culture. Its a bright restaurant with nice furnitures and cutlery. You can see staffs dressed in jaoanease clothes here.
Food ordered- This was my first tine in this place and we ordered 2 brewed drinks,one chicken gyoz and one tori teriyaki.
Food quality and quantity-
Here brewed drinks get served in beer mugs designed with japanese design in the mug.
Chicken gyoza- Chicken gyoza was nothing but momos. We took the grilled one. Its one of the worst kinda momo i had.. maybe japanese gyoza tastes like this but seriously i will never reorder this one next time i come to this place.
Tori teriyaki- This item was just splendid. The dish had chicken grilled strips cooked in teritaki sauce. Its realky mouth watering and i strongly recommend this item.
I will again come to this place and try some more items.

I might have caught them on an off-day as when I arrived at the place, the attendants didnt look prepared for customers and acted a tad bit chaotically. Overlooking that slight inconvenience, the seating and ambience was pretty nice with both low seating and normal chair-table available. There were japanese hand-fans and wooden windows as part of the decor. They kept the music and even the paintings on the wall suited to the theme. What bummed me was the few Japanese (or Japanese looking?.. pardon my racist sounding comment as ignorance) attendants. They seemed ill at easy and unhappy servers. I was delighted by the chopsticks and the crockeries they used.
Coming to the food, I have tried Sushi before and I was completely satisfied with the Ngiri Sushi. I took the salmon one, in my rush to finish off the delicacy I forgot to click pictures. The other dish I ordered was a Tori Tsukune Yakitori. Yakitori is a safe dish for someone who is not well-acquainted with Japanese cuisine. It had a nice smoky feel, the meat was not minced and one could fill the bite sized bits; well-marinated chicken, glazed with a spicy sweet sauce and skewered- the combination was perfect. What I would give a miss the next time is the Chennai maki,- it was a sushi roll with tuna filling but topped with spicy mayo! Disastrous to say the least, all the subtleness of the flavours was off-set by the mayo. 
Anyways, the food was good enough to go back again, the pocket-pinch a bit on the higher side.
This being located on the third floor of a building that houses other offices as well, its best if you take the lift.

The food is delicious, but we paid roughly 3000 rupees for a total of 10 not-so-excellent-sushi (rice was knida slimey), some salad and some fried prown. At least the service was very polite, and the place is indeed very neat, but you'll get the same for 70% in my home European country, but hey, this is Kolkata, people work for 4000 a week, where's the super-quality for this price?

10th December, 2015.

So this was my first stint trying Japanese cuisine and my friend suggested that this was the best place for it and boy was she right!

-Decor-
You open the door on the third floor and you feel nice when you see the cooks from the open kitchen greet you in Japanese with such a big smile. The restaurant was mostly empty on this particular weekday afternoon so we got to choose our preferred seating arrangement. You get normal tables, two authentic Japanese-style seating arrangement and then there's my personal favourite - a more cosy, romantic seating arrangement for two right at the end of the place through a door. Do remember to open your shoes if you prefer any of the Japanese seating.
Very minimalistic design; spotless nevertheless, but exudes a posh corporate fine-dining feel.

-Staff-
Keeping with the general feel of the place, even the staff was immaculately dressed in formals. Our particular server was a Japanese woman. Since it's a totally different cuisine, the staff is expected to have a detailed knowledge of the complex menu (with poor graphics) and they do a good job. Don't hesitate to ask about any dish you're unsure about.

-Food-
Since it was my first time, we decided to play safe and order only items which my friend had already tried:

1) MUMBAI MAKI: So this is basically sushi; almost the authentic one with slight variations. This particular one had orange fish eggs stuck to the rice, with seaweed and crab meat stuffings. Now to how it actually tastes: pretty bland! We Bengalis are used to so many spices in our food that the bland flavour hits us more. About the crab meat, it is sliced to such a thin piece and the quantity of it is so less that you barely get to taste it. My suggestion is to put an entire slice into your mouth so that all the subtle little flavours hit your tastebuds. 

If you don't like sushi, you can always go for:
2) YAKITORI MORIAWASE: So this is assorted meat (chicken, lamb) and prawn on 5 skewers glazed with the sauce of your choice. This was delicious and a wonderful change after the sushi.

Caution: Just these two items cost us 900 approx and were definitely not filling for a lunch. A full meal (4-course) may go up to about 2000 approx.

P.S. They serve different toffees with the bill! That's always a plus.

-Final Verdict-
A very lovely experience for a first time. Will definitely go back to try some more. Recommended! 

-Bon Appétit. :)

Wanna have a different taste from same type of Indian foods? Then Fuji should be in your list!
We went at lunch and ordered Salmon Sashimi, Keizen Salad, Maki Shushi, Kushiage Moriase &
Bitakakuni Miso Ramen ...
Sushi, Ramen was delicious and Moriase was crispy fries of chicken , pork and prons...
Ambience and service was too good ... you can see those Japanese chefs cooking from your table and also bar is available...
Only thing is the restaurant is at 3rd floor ... so find carefully...

Amazing experience with Japanese food. This was my second time with sushi, which I quite liked (given that I am not well acquainted with the taste, texture, smell of sushi). Following the suggesting of the server, we went for Yakitori Moriwase, and oh boy, was it good! It was easily the most delicious yakitori I have ever had. The pork in the Butakakuni Miso Ramen was perfectly cooked, lean and meaty.

We also sampled their Wasabi Ice Cream which turned out to be a huge delight!  The sweetness of coconut against the hotness of the wasabi was a perfect marriage! :')

Coming back for more, I am! :D

P.S. Photos to be uploaded as and when I finish with editing them.

Although this place is a bit confusing to find, it has amazing Japanese food prepared and served by authentic Japanese people who are extremely pleasant and courteous. I recommend having the Pork yakitori and teriyaki. The place isn't the best for main courses but one can surely fill themselves up by the range of bite sized eatables.

Hands down the best Japanese I have ever eaten. 
If you are there you must have the Seafood Okonomiyaki. It has squid, Salmon, Tuna,Prawn. in it and is similar to a Pancake. The base is made using cabbage but it didn't taste anything like it. The Yakitori Moriawase is also amazing. You get 5 pieces - chicken, pork, and Prawn etc. It is the same price as just the pork one but I think it's better to get the assorted one. 
If you are willing to eat something different I recommend the Unagi (eel) Sushi. It has a very different kind of texture and a taste similar to Salmon.

This has to be hands down my favorite Japanese eatery in Kolkata.

I have tried just about everything on their menu and I can't decide what's best as everything here tastes superlative!

The kitchen is open and you can watch while you wait for the food. There is two types of seating - regular chairs and Japanese style seating. Service is attentive and prompt. Although the prices are on the higher side, the food makes up for the pinch.
 
My favorite's would be Butakakuni miso ramen (pork), Suzuki sushi, Yakitori moriawase, Kushiage Moriawase. Even the dumplings are to die for.

Must visit for lovers of Sushi and Japanese cuisine!

There aren't many restaurants in the city that serves sushi & comparing them, I can say this is the best. The ambience is good, staff is fine but the food is awesome. The pork here is fantastic. It's soft & by far one of the best cooked pork that I have eaten (one of the few places where you actually get a lot of meat instead of the fat). As far as the sushi & sashimi goes, they were lovely. The menu is actually very vast & it becomes very difficult to make a choice, certainly a happy problem to face. The also serve alcohol unlike the other sushi restaurants so cheers to that. Couldn't have celebrated my birthday better. Will surely visit again.

We came here on a holiday in an evening time. It was a bit hard to find. the restaurant is on the 3rd floor of the building. The food was descent enough but the moment we entered i realized a weird smell. The smell was really irritating. We order 2 types of sushis one was the thin wraps and the other was the original salmon sushi from Japan. Then we order ebi (prawn) and grilled chicken. The sushis were okay but as it was our first time we couldnt enjoy the japanese dishes and this constant smell was bit irritating. The ebi and the chicken was cooked with a typical soya sause which was making he taste strong and kind of bitter.Otherwise ambience was good. The waitress was in kimono and she was courteous enough. The only thing that i loved was the candy that they gave at the end of the meal.

I am a Vegetarian- however thought of trying my luck to find some 'veg' sushi- at "Fuji Japanese Restaurant" - they have 3-4 types of Veg Sushi to offer on their menu card - I must say the taste of Veg Sushi on offer was really good. My non-vegetarian friends tried Fried Chicken in sweet-hot garlic spread (as per menu card the Japanese name for the dish is not so easy to remember)- they also commented highly on the wholesome taste. 
However, think twice before ordering liquor (specifically foreign)- the printed price on the card - & the final bill value including all that obscure  taxes might give you such a "jhatka" you might fall off from your chair !!!

While their food is pretty decent, they need to look into improving hygiene and quality of service. The staff isnt rude necessarily but they need to be more courteous and have better knowledge of the food if they are presenting it as a semi fine dining experience.

My love for sushi began two years ago n Fuji is the third place I tried sushi out after sushi Oke n matsuri. The first thing that will strike you once your lift door opens at 3rd floor that this has tried to create an ambiance as close as what we know of a Japanese dining place. Choose your seats, whether normal chair tables or floor seating with low height tables or  separate area of low height chairs n tables. The flooring, wooden partitions, tables all remind u of being in a Japanese restaurant. Then there menu... Varied, vast n detailed. We ordered nigiri sushi, ebi tempura, chicken yakitori n chicken soy ramen. I personally can't take the smell weed so the ramen was enjoyed by my friend. The ramen was soupy noodles with sesame, corn, chicken , sea weed n boiled eggs.. Different but wholesome. The salmon nigiri sushi was simply awesome.. Fresh n delicious! The tempura was good, except I felt that the size of prawns could have been better given it's Calcutta where all sizes of prawns are easily available! Yakitori was well made with abundance of teriyaki sauce. After all these we didn't have much left to try the wasabi ice cream(next time for sure). All this n pocket pinch was 2.1k which I thought was reasonable. Note: 2pieces of nigiri sushi is 250 bucks! This makes the place costly if you are only visiting for some awesome sushi. Try Japanese, try here!!!

Well when Xrong Place started this entry fee thingy, we were left with no option than to go somewhere else. Interestingly we found this huge billboard right in the opposite street. Out of curiosity we thought of having it a go, and bingo it worked well. This place provides the authenticity at its best, including the sitting arrangements. As a safe bet, we ordered chicken teriyaki and chicken okonomiyaki, and it was good. I personally never had Japanese food before so hope the taste were truthful to their sources. But it's quite good. Beverages options are limited (Read: No strong beers). Would love to visit again.

After a long hunt for authentic Japanese food in the city we finally landed in this place thanks to Zomato and the customer reviews. In the hustling bustling connector of Sarat Bose Road in Southern Avenue from Deshapriya Park, this restaurant can be easily missed out. Though they are putting up a big board now.
This place is strictly for foodies who are open to explore cuisines of various cultures. Generally authentic Japanese food does not match our traditional Indian taste buds and this place lives exactly up to the above statement.
The entrance to this place is non descriptive, but the decor and ambiance in the restaurant makes up for the entrance. We preferred the Japanese style of dining where in one sits on the floor and eats. Seating arrangement is very comfortable.
Coming to the food, the word excellent is just an understatement. Since we were open to trying anything that looked eccentric, we ordered raw sea food dishes and sushi. And to our surprise, they tasted more delicious than their fried versions! Kaisen salad was very delicious and I would highly recommend it. The spicy version of sushi called Spicy shake temaki really helped in changing our taste buds. Apart from these 2 exceptional dishes that we had everything else was also very tasty.
Service quality and food quantity is also good. The dishes are decently priced given their quality and quantity.
We will sure be back here to try the dishes that we could not taste in just one meal :)
Recommend- Kaisen salad, Spicy shake temaki

Being a Japanese food fanatic, I came to this place looking for some good food. The result? Exceptionally good Food! I've been there twice in 3 days so I need not say more.  Do try their Green tea ice - cream, it's delish.

Have been to Fuji over many months now...bar is a welcome recent addition! However, staff must be more knowledgeable about the food! In the absence of many credible options for Japanese in Kolkata, Fuji is reasonably consistent ...although desperately wish they are a notch better...!!!

If you're a real foodie & enjoy exploring cuisines then this one is a must in your list !
Accompanied with a traditional Japanese seating section the ambience is a complete delight.  Let your taste buds get titilated with amazing aroma and flavours, that surely will linger on  for sometime.

With the growing fad of Japanese food in town, Fuji made its way to my wishlist quite sometime back. Dropped there for a sudden unplanned dinner and simply loved it. The apparently non-descript entrance led to a rather surprising and delicious experience thereafter. Located a few buildings before Fire and Ice, Deshapriyo Park, the space has an open kitchen and comfortable sittings and we took one of those low tables where you sit with your legs folded to get into that feel ! We had ordered Sashimi platter, Maki sushi, Prawn tempura, Chicken yakitori(skewers) and Desserts. For those who love sashimi the platter is a must . The sesame icecream is much recommended as well. Service was good and prices though slightly high are well worth it. Overall, I loved the food and if you have a thing for all that is Japanese you must give Fuji a try.

I had visited Fuji right before I visited Matsuri. Matsuri is a well known Japanese chain restaurant however, it shut down way too soon!
Fuji I felt, was way more authentic. They have a private dining area. They also have the modern day seating approach in addition to the traditional seating area.
You can sit on the wooden floor and enjoy your hot meal in the traditional manner. The decor is minimalistic and at par with a reputed Japanese brand. The last time I visited, I remember meeting a Japanese manager who was running the place. However, he was missing from action this time around. 
Recommended items - Te Maki Sushi, of course! The wholesome rice balls should be popped into your mouth. The flavours from the filling along with nori should explode inside your mouth!
They looked like they served sake with this, however, on not being offered, we didn't ask for it.
The usual sticky rice and the curry made a nice meal. The quantity was overwhelming. A dose of wasabi ice cream or sesame ice cream would have made our day but sadly that was not offered as well.
Nonetheless, I will consider visiting Fuji for the third time!

My quest for Japanese food in city continues post disastrous experience at Matsuri. The restaurant, Fuji is next to Macro Polo in Southern Avenue. The entrance is narrow and one can take lift to third floor. 
The ambiance is like Japanese eatery one have seen in movies. Not gaudy but decent decor. Have option of seating like Japanese style in private dining section.

In starters we had Tori No Teriyaki and Buta No Shougayaki. Tori No Teriyaki is superb with grilled chicken fillet baked with teriyaki sauce. Buta No Shougayaki is grilled pork shavings in ginger sauce. We didn't get any taste of ginger so the dish was pretty average to us.

In main course we had Tori Yakimeshi. This is Japanese sticky rice tossed with chicken and vegetables. Very similar to chicken fried rice but the taste is extravagant due special sauce and its not dry as fried rice. One won't need side dish if prefers not to.

In dessert we had Wasabi Ice Cream and Sesame Ice Cream. Wasabi Ice Cream is a must try while Sesame flavour didn't excite me much.

They now have bar license. Staffs were able to explain us and translate the menu. Price is on higher side ofcourse. It cost us INR 1890 inclusive all. All food fanatics can explore this once.

A former traditional Japanese restaurant . nice place to hangout with your buddies. service and food quality is really great even they suggest always the best ones.the ambiance is really very cool and eye catching and a great decor. a noticeable thing is proper Japanese styled seating table. tried yakitori moriawase( chicken pork fish combination).. it was so much delicious. the sushi platter was fantastic. loved the tuna fish preparation.
you can visit there with family or friends
hospitality is too good
internal decor and ambiance is soothing

The sushi that I tried was absolutely substandard.
The tuna sushi was completely stale. The sushi lacked any flavour . Compared to Zen which is located in The Park , it is deplorable ! The sushi was cut in an uneven manner and struggled to stay on top of the rice . The rice was abnormally dry and needed to be moist. The salmon, red snapper and other sushi was also very dry. The service was very slow as well. The rest of the food was below expectation too. My suggestion is that if you've ever had decent Japanese food in your life , don't waste your time going to Fuji.

This place will surely surprise you in a very pleasant way. The entrance is not very noticeable and hence, if you don't know of it, there is a slim chance of you finding it by chance. 
There has been a sudden spurt of new Japanese restaurants in the city and I was curious about this one for a long time. 
I ambiance was very soothing and the place is quite big, I mean it's bigger than what I had assumed based on the pictures I had seen. 
We sat in one of those Japanese style seating tables, where one has to fold her legs. Here it has been designed in such a way that one can either sit at it like in a normal table or can fold his/her legs.The menu was bright and catchy with ample pictures to give the customers a good idea of what to expect. 
The sushi platter was AMAZING and so were the rolled sushis. The skewered chicken was fairly good too. And the rice bowl with tempura was BIG, on size as well as taste. 
I was very happy with the meal but the best was yet to come. For desserts we ordered lemon coconut yogurt, sesame ice cream and wasabi ice cream. The yogurt was good but was overshadowed by the other two. Both the icecreams packed in an amazing punch of flavour and were completely drool-worthy. 
The best part of this place was that it wasn't too expensive too. If I have to pick out a flaw, that would be the apple cinnamon ice tea which was very ordinary. But I would overlook that any day and would love to visit this place again, and again.

Recently discovered this small Japanese restaurant tucked away on the 3rd floor of an inconspicuous building! Minimalist decor greets lovely aromas wafting in from the open kitchen! We got to sit Zen style albeit with a bit of cheating, the service was quick and helpful. Having had lots of Japanese food before on my travels, I quite enjoyed the sushi and the miso soup! I had ordered the stir fry veggies in soya sauce which frankly was lacking in flavour! My friends enjoyed the pork skewers and other non vegetarian fare. I hope to go back and try the Japanese style pizza, another old favourite of mine.

My idea of anything Japanese was just restricted to Takeshi's castle only :p . I had no idea what Japanese food tasted like but I had always wanted to know what made a small dump of sticky rice rolled up in raw fish a worldwide favorite delicacy. I'm not much of a fish lover and I was quite sure that I wouldn't like sushi much. Anyway, being a foodie myself, I had to try it out. So, I thought of giving Fuji a shot.

The ambience is just too good. They've kept the place as Japanese as possible. Hospitality is good as well. And now coming to the food. Food was beyond good. A fish hater just turned into a sushi lover after having the Nigiri sushi platter here. Also the Green tea ice cream they serve is a must try!

I'd have given Fuji 5/5 but -0.5 for the exorbitant prices.

Fuji is the place you should visit if you really wanna try good sushi.

Oh this place never disappoints if one's looking for an involved gastronomic experience. The Salmon sushis specifically the nigiri are usually my go-to order. It's crazy good. Recently I tried this pan grilled teriyaki sea bass(Suzuki teriyaki). That was a special plate of food. I'm also a big fan of the prawn yakitoris.

The best standalone Japanese restaurant in town.Simple.While I proclaim this I keep in mind the Pan Asian at the ITC Sonar,Zen at the Park and Wasabi on Anwar Shah connector.

We ( family of 4) ate a lot.

                   Salmon - 5/5
                   Tuna - 4/5
Sushi...........5 pcs of mixed sushi with tuna,prawn,squid etc.  4/5

Yakitori........yakitori moriawase ( prawn). 3.5/5

Houram son to bacon itane......Basically bacon with spinach 4/5

Tori no teriyaki......Grilled chicken in teriyaki sauce. 4/5

Miso soup........3/5

But a yasai mashi........pork and vegetables. 4.5/5

Tempura moriawase.......prawn tempura.....4/5

Kutsen yashimeshi.........fried rice.....4/5

Grilled pork with ginger sauce.......4.5/5 (ordered twice)

Good service apart,Japanese cuisine survives on two things......freshness of produce and expertise in molecular gastronomy.This place scores on both counts.

This is one of the few places in kolkata which serves authentic Japanese food.  Loved their hand rolled spicy salmon sushi. The kaisen salad was also also good...lots of fresh fish..however there could be better greens with the fish. The salmon skin roll sushi was excellent. Also ordered the nigiri sushi platter..the squid one was too raw for my taste but the others were nice. For desserts, the black sesame ice cream was good too. Overall a great place to have Japanese food.

With my family this was the first time I went to try Japanese food and boy I must say that Fuji is 'the' place to go if you are looking for typical good quality Japanese food in Kolkata. We received a warm welcome from a Japanese woman dressed in a kimono. Her appearance along with the interior decoration and Japanese music (played in the background) created a good ambience, typical of a Japanese restaurant. Enough with the ambience, now let me come directly to food. The menu comprised of a variety of dishes typical to the Japanese cuisine including okonomiyaki, ramen noodles, udon noodles etc. along with a wide variety of sushi dishes. Every single food item we ordered did not fail to please me ; everything was excellent, especially the Chicken Okonomiyaki (this dish is to die for). Their service was quite fast and efficient as well and the staff was also very co-operative. Every single aspect of the restaurant did not fail to satisfy me. If anyone asks whether I'll go there once again or not - the answer will definitely be A BIG YES !

With japanesr cuisine trending in kolkata one can never miss to catch on it. And my first journey of it begins from FUJI.
FIRST of all, it is located near the barista in southern avenue , above the place where there is to be " fire and ice". You go straight up to the 3rd floor by the elevator and bang comes the restro .
SECONDLY, you will be warmly welcomed by the staff there dressed up impressively with their lingering smile and once you are sitted it won't take time for them to entertain you.
AT LAST , the FOOD here is all japanese starting from the arrays of sushi ami sashimi to noodle soup and sticky rice. We ordered salmon sushi and mixed yakitori (skewers which had pork, prawn and chicken). for the main course we ordered  noodle soup and japanese rice and curry. The food experience is great though not a fan of sushi but their sushis are quite good . The yakitori dish and the noodle soup is awesome.  i would like to try some of their other dishes on my next visit.

P.s. : they have an open bar !!

I was first skeptical whether or not i should go for Japanese food. I was pleasantly surprised when I entered the place. The decor and ambience was nice.
Food ordered
Tuna and salmon nigiri - which was so good that we ordered twice.
Chicken prawns and pork skewers -very nice flavours , prawns were the best
Grilled pork- i prefer my pork usually well done. 
Could have been cooked more. But no complaints.  The gravy was amazing
The best was the wasabi icecream
Must visit.
Overall 
5 on 5.

Great food and wonderful minimalist ambiance. Never expected Japanese food to taste so good. Wonder who is the chef. Well cooked and well presented. Perfect in all aspect. I did not like the 'Nori" (sea weeds)  covering the sushis, instead of fresh and crispy, it was rubbery and chewy, perhaps kept too long in a fridge. Californian sushis are OK.
Overall experience is good and will visit again.

My work has constantly taken me to Japan at least twice a year for over a decade now. So, my love for Japanese cuisine has grown over the years.

I went to this place with bare minimum expectation. I am glad to admit that I was so wrong to have pre- conceived notions.

Simple Japanese decor, very courteous staff who know the menu. Our order consisted of salmon sushi, assoryed yakitori, chicken ramen soup and shredded pork in ginger sauce. The sushi was good with all fresh ingredients. The yakitori was excellent with the mince chicken ball and chicken with leek being standouts. The soup was enough to feed two persons. The shredded pork was cooked perfectly.

Overall, a very good experience and a place I will definitely visit again.

Fuji : A snapshot of Japan in the city... Interior is decorated in Japanese fashion , few Japanese waiters are roaming here and there...typical Japanese dining tables and chairs have been set to dine on... Japanese music is humming at the background to create a perfect ambience to dine . Waiters are super-courteous and they would usher you to choose tasty Japanese delicacies out of plethora of dishes. I tried my tastebuds on sushi for the first time but felt like my tastebuds are not meant for this particular delicacy. We had ordered:
Salmon nigiri - a type of sushi made of salmon fish.
Yakitori moriwase - a varity of grilled chicken with wasabi.
Tori Tempura - chicken fried in a batter. Unfortunately, this tastes blunt to me.
Kaishen kushi yaki - seafish and squid grilled in skewer and served in sweet and sour saucebase
Tori yakimeshi - Typical Japanese sticky rice
Tori no teryaki - grilled chicken in tangy kind of sauce base.
I won't mind to drop by here whenever my tastebuds will crave for Japanese delicacies.

N.B. : Pocket pinch is on the higher side.

I must confess I was a tad sceptical visiting this place as some of the comments here on this restaurant weren't speaking much good about them. However, I must say that I loved the food....we had ordered for salmon sushi, sticky rice with Japanese style chicken curry, Tori No Teriyaki ( grilled chicken basted with Teriyaki sauce) and Buta No Shougayaki (grilled pork with ginger sauce) and they were all yummy!! And the best part is their part sitting arrangement in Japanese style which we tried especially for my daughter who is in love with some Japanese cartoon characters. Overall, it's surely a recommended place to visit....
P.S. They have a vip room which you can have exclusively if in a group of 8-10

We tried out everything. Sashimi (salmon and tuna), nigiri sushi, maki rolls, yakitori, yamamono, steamed seafood and vegetables and japanese chicken curry and rice. We loved everything. I only felt that the sashimi was not value for money. 5 small pieces for Rs 580 per serving i think was steep. The pieces should have been bigger. I think Asia in Box sashimi servings are more generous.

I have absolutely no idea how there are some good-to-excellent reviews for this place. The others could not have eaten the same Sushi that I just nearly threw away. 

The Nigiri was a disaster. The rice was too vinegary and the fish was dry and tasteless. A slight dip in the Soya sauce caused the entire piece to disintegrate making a mess of the whole experience. 

I have rarely written any scathing reviews on Zomato but the experience here with my favourite food was greatly upsetting. 

Points for trying with a new cuisine in Calcutta I suppose and the Miso soup was decent (one can't really go wrong with Miso), but other than that Fuji is hardly authentic or enjoyable.

The ambience is really nice. The Nigiri Sushi was average. The salmon was a tad soft on the sushi. I am a sushi lover, have had sushi innumerable times in various countries, not many of them make them very good. The broiled eel here was as good as the best that I have had in UK. The Miso soup was different here, it was intrusive. Maki sushi (renamed Chennai Maki) was alright. The coconut ice cream was simply outstanding. I can go back here for the ice cream and the Eel. As for the rest, I shall skip. 
P.S. It was too expensive vis a vis the quality. A meal for 2 set me back by 4000 INR.

The most impressive thing about this place in my opinion is the presentation. Very clean, aesthetic and minimalist. I tried the radish vegetarian thin sushi rolls and the spicy salmon rolls, both of which were very good. Then I tried the pork ramen which was a very generous portion of really good broth and a great blend of flavours. The pork was a bit chewy. The highlight of the evening in my opinion was the Kiwi Blossom which was perfect. Will definitely come back here again. For the food, the presentation and the very friendly staff :)

This place is extraordinary. I have never had better sushi or sashimi anywhere in India. The freshness, the flavour, the restrained beauty of the presentation - Fuji has absolutely won my heart. I freely recommend almost everything on their menu, but especially their miso soup, the incredibly fresh sashimi platter, nigiri platters, the prawn-and-crab stick maki (advertised as the Mumbai maki), umeboshi maki (vegetarian), and all the tempura and deep-fried stuff, if sushi is not really your thing. 

I was a little disheartened to see the emptiness of the place. We were the only patrons at this wonderful place. Please, people of Calcutta, as one foodie to another, come to Fuji! Don't force this little city gem to shut shop.

I never had better Sashimi anywhere in India. And at that price! Calcutta scores way up over Mumbai this time. And I took a gang of 5 Japanese friends along and they clapped after every course. Its that good. Don't miss this place people. 

Recommendations: try the Shashimi platter, Scallops and Salmon was super fresh. Try nigiri too and the Miso soup. 

The meal combos are amazing... Comes with sticky rice, pickles, cold soup and Nori. Try teriyaki or even a tempura meal. 

The coconut based mocktails are good too, since they don't have Sake.

In Calcutta, I have almost no one to accompany me for my occasional Udon cravings. So I am quite playing the self-proclaimed Japanese food evangelist here. I love Japanese food - the subtle flavorful taste and texture plays havoc with my senses each time I eat good Japanese food. There are a quite a few good places in the city now, but they remain unexplored maybe because people are apprehensive about the unknown (and the expensive, if I may add).

The average Indian palate chooses Harakiri when offered an uber-subtle, uber-sensual, slick and quaintly delectable Japanese meal. It isn't your everyday dal makhni, butter chicken or super thick biriyani...its different, slow burning, tender, a little off-kilter, like Murakami was cooking and writing a haiku poem with noodles! All subtlety, all delicate pecks to the taste buds, all natural sauces and flavours melting in the earthen pots and steaming brews. Comfort food for the samourai. Not the mac-aloo consumer. But still I would want to urge the readers of this review to try more and more Japanese food.

My experience of Fuji was pretty exotic. I have liked Sushi Oke and Wasabee too, but Fuji was better. They have more variety, and the ambience is nice too. The interior is tastefully done. Service is quiet, unassuming, yet warm and helpful when needed. The waitresses walk past you, daintily, like neat little geishas - very cute indeed.

Here's what I ordered:

Shake no Teriyaki Shioyaki -  broiled salmon braised in teriyaki sauce
Yaki Udon - wheat noodles pan sauteed with chicken and assorted veggies in japanese sauce
Chicken Syoyu Ramen - hot ramen noodles cooked in chicken and soy based stock, served with boiled egg and steamed chicken

Service was prompt and the plating was done temptingly. The salmon was wonderfully done with mild saucy flavors, placed delicately on a bed of shredded salad.
The udon was awesome too. The ramen was good I would say, but the other two took the cake. The sweet corn was a let down in the ramen broth. Pocket pinch was a tad on the higher side, 2000 for 2 people, and there is no wine list as yet. They are still waiting on the license.

Now coming back to Jap food. I have seen tons of people going ga-ga over Chinese but not trying Jap at all, maybe because they are too tired to explore or maybe the newness bogs them down. I don't have a personal food blog, or I would have posted this entry titled 'An Idiot's Guide To Japanese Dining'. A Zomato Review may not be the most suitable platform, however I think I would take the liberty and go ahead and write a bit more about basic Japanese cuisine - in the hope that more and more people will take interest in it :)

Here's a list of common culinary terms that may be of help to the ubiquitous city diner:

Types of Rice Dishes:
1.   Gohan - steamed rice set meal, usually with egg topping
2.   Chahan/Yaki Meshi - sauteed japanese sticky rice / fried rice
3.   Don/Donburi - Donburi is a Japanese "rice bowl dish" consisting of fish, meat, vegetables or other ingredients simmered together and served over rice. Donburi meals are served in oversized rice bowls also called donburi.

Common Sauces / Seasonings:
1.   Itame - green coconut milk base
2.   Dengaku - miso paste
3.   Goma-ae - sesame
4.   Shira-ae - soy bean curd
5.   Teriyaki - mix of soy, rice wine and sugar
6.   Shougayaki - ginger sauce
7.   Ponzu - citrus soy sauce
8.   Wasabi - Pungent japanese horseradish sauce

Cooking Styles:

Raw fish: its all about freshness and cleanliness...and this restaurant guarantees it all..the cent percent authentic Japanese cuisine served in Kolkata.. And this is the opinion of the Japanese staff at my office..a bit pricey but that's because most of the ingredients, cutlery and decor being imported from Japan..and the restaurant being managed by Japanese people so u feel u r sitting in Japan..if u understand Japanese cuisine and culture try the following.
Kaisendon
Sashimi moriawase
Buta to yasai itame
Tori yasai mushi
Kaisen salad
Wasabi ice cream 

If you have a thing against raw food, you may go for their fried rice's, pork tonkatsu, chicken teriyaki, okonomoyaki, kaien don, soba noodles, yakitori, etc.

I wanted to try authentic Japanese cuisine in Kolkata and this place did not disappoint. The food was nice, reminded me of the restaurants in Tokyo. The miso soup was very much like the one I used to have in Tokyo. Similar was the chicken teriyaki. I did not try the sushi or sashami this time. But, overall a good place for Japanese food.

One of those days when the adventurous spirit gets the better of you, I went along with my friend to try sushi for the first time. Located at the third floor of the Fire And Ice restaurant building, it took us sometime to find it (mainly because it was formerly known as Aoi). We started with a bit of this and a bit of that before actually trying the authentic sushi. The waiters there are extremely helpful, and guided us to what they call the beginner's dish to sushi - the one with salmon. 

Honestly, it wasn't that bad even though I tried to gulp it down. The wasabi dip did help in overwhelming every other taste, but it was a nice experience altogether. The other dishes such as the 'Kolkata Maki' and 'Buta Negima' were delicious too!

However, one must not miss the wasabi ice-cream at any cost - it's immensely refreshing and something that is served at a very few locations in the city!

Fuji was my first visit to an authentic Japanese restaurant. Felt quite nice to be visiting one in the heart of South Kolkata.  I was struck by the array of raw sea food on display from squids, octopuses, tuna, and salmon to other exotic sea creatures that I don’t remember the names. As we entered we had a welcome by a girl in her typical Kimono fare. The interiors of the restaurant are very pleasantly done and we preferred to sit on the low seating area where we could sit with folded legs. 

It is not too difficult to locate Fuji. Once you take Southern avenue you have to turn right on Sarat Bose Road and it falls on your left. You might miss the building, as it’s located on the second or the third floor. Hence be on the lookout of Fire and Ice which is below it. 

I tried the Kolkata Maki a crab sticky roll along with Yaki Chicken Gyoza or dumplings as we know them. The only thing missing was some good wine since it hasn’t yet got the liquor license. We tried the Lemon Ice tea which was thirst quenching in the Kolkata summers. For the main course we tried the katsu Don which was a version of pork cutlets and eggs simmered and served with Japanese sticky rice. The portions for the main course are huge and it is advisable to ask the quantity before ordering.

Next time I want to go back to try the octopus and the kalamari on the menu.

This was my second time excursion to a Japanese restaurant. At first I was a bit apprehensive about the place, serving authentic Japanese (read raw seafood).... Did quite the research from previous posts and decided to give it a go. And boy am I thankful for that decision... We were warmly welcomed by a traditionally attired Japanese lady... The interiors were aptly done with an open kitchen and traditional seating. We were a group of four, and ordered Tori (Chicken)Momo Yakitori, Tori no Teriyaki, Kushiage Moriawase (assorted fish, prawn, chicken,squid skewers deep fried), Ika tempura(squid deep fried), and after much deliberations Goa Maki Sushi (raw salmon).. All the food was excellent, and proportions adequate so that all of us could have one piece each from one platter... The sushi was excellent (take it from someone who is not a sushi lover) and didn't at all taste like I was having raw fish... The dips were unique too. Then we went on to have Somen Champuru (noodles), Ton Katsu ( fried pork), Tori yasai mushi (steamed chicken and veggies with ponzu sauce) and a mocktail each... All the food left us in a blissful mood and the bill was quite reasonable at around ₹1150 per head.... We would definitely come back and also recommend it to my friends....

Mediocre Japanese - but at least a beginning. Rather interesting (and authentic) range in the menu. Impressed by the Gomaye (Cold Spinach with Sesame), Pork Cutlet and Kusihiagi / Yakitori. But, the lack of an alcohol licence is a dampener. Price reasonable - for a good Japanese with genuine ingredients   - but may be too steep for Calcutta (#Kolkata). Rating 2.5 / 5

Authentic sushi in Kolkata, that too just few Kilometer away from home.....sounds good no?? By far I didn't have any idea about Japnese food. I was quite happy with all those chinese joints, Tibetan corners, sometimes Lebanese kitchens. and the Indian/ Mughlai/ Bengali restaurants sprang up in Kolkata. All of a sudden came to know about Fuji (Formerly known as Aoi) beside Sarat Bose Road.

We tried some soup (Don't really remember the name), Maki Sushi, Chicken tori Teriyaki and Chicken Udan Noodle. Mmmm about taste of food i will not praise much, may be I dont have that kind of taste bud..... but yess they all are uniquely taste. An overall unique experience I ever had in life. And I found the menu to be quite pricey in terms of the quantity that was served.

Anyway, I will visit this place once again to try some other dishes, which may impress my taste bud. But thumbs up to you guys for bringing up these type of Restaurants in Kolkata and bringing world in our doorsteps... Good going!!

Not much of a Japanese food enthusiast, yet this restaurant left a certain mark in my mind. The first thing that needs to be mentioned is the decor. There were paper walls and sliding doors and that umbrella! I loved the fact that they had separate places with Japanese style seating, the sunken seats thing, as well as chairs. Every detail, from the music, to the chopsticks and being greeted in the Japanese way, AOI has it all. 
The food, the maki sushi, chicken teriyaki and some other stuff off the menu, that we ordered were served right away. The only disappointment was that the dessert I had ordered was not available at that time. The food was good. I liked the way they even showed my friend and I the way to have the sushi, and every time I called them, they came to our table and waited upon us with a smile. 
definitely a place to go. :)

Excellent & quite authentic for Kolkata. 
The sushi was absolutely fresh, loved the tuna, salmon, prawn & squid especially. We ordered the 7 sushi platter & loved it. The miso soup was pretty good too. The teriyaki pork skewers & pork in ginger were great. Tried the udon noodles soup bowl on an earlier occasion & loved it. Have been to Aoi twice & will be going back many more times.
Yes its a little expensive but definitely cheaper than the other good sushi options! 
Also if ure not a sushi fan, please don't insult their effort.

after having Japanese food in so many places, including in Japan and Thailand, I had been feeling a lack of an authentic Japanese diner in the city. They truly add a certain mysterious charm to the culture of dining.
Thankfully today, after coming out of a cafe and on my way to an ATM, there was this latest addition to the fabulous food street in Sarat Bose Road ( this place seems to be adding one good eatery after the other every month).
On entering the premises, it was clear that they got the feel right. The paper walls, sunken in seating, sliding doors and the fiery kitchen with the trademark Japanese style cooks ( i dont know what they are called).
On seating I was presented the menu, which thankfully had a spread that was affordable and diverse. One could taste a plate of sushi or teriyaki skewer without pinching pockets (~INR200). I loved the tenderness of the teriyaki chicken. They were marinated and grilled to perfection. It would be good to go through their fare in slow contemplation to savor it for long.
Aoi is a welcome addition to Kolkata.

First the cons - the service surely needs a leg up and no acceptance of card payment is a big thumbs down. But the food does make up for these two a lot. The chicken teriyaki and prawns were very well made. The ramen noodles were quite good as well. The menu is extensive and seems to offer an authentic experience.

I was pleasantly surprised to see high quality Japanese food in Kolkata, which is generally a rarity. The decor is really nice, very Japanese feel to it. The food is excellent- particularly the sashimi. My only grievance was that the wasabi didn't seem as fresh as I had hoped it would be. However, definitely a place I would visit a number of times.

‘AOI’ located on the 3rd floor above Fire and Ice on Sarat Bose Road. While entering we saw the open kitchen in front and staffs greeted us warmly in Japanese. There were two tables for Japanese style eating while seating in seiza but we opted for regular table. I ordered 4 Non-Veg Miso Ramen Soup, 2 Maki Suzuki Sushi, 2 Chicken Tori Teriyaki, 2 Non-Veg Udan Noodles and 4 Japanese Lemon Iced Teas. Japanese Iced Tea was excellent and it comes with lemon and honey. Miso Ramen Soup is refreshing and tasted wonderful. Then come Maki Suzuki Sushi, sorry to say I did ‘NOT’ like it, just terrible. Chicken Tori Teriyaki was quite good, we may have enjoyed it more if we have not tried the sushi. Udan Noodles taste very ordinary and nothing to wow about it. Pricing is a bit high, and the quantity of food is a bit on lesser side. Staffs are very polite and professional, ambiance is very comfortable. The restaurant is quite good, but it'll burn a hole in your pocket definitely.

This is a welcome change to the city's oriental food scene. The number of places serving true blue Japanese food can counted on your fingertips and those that are reasonable are fewer still.
The selection of sushis are larger than any other place i have seen before and the other dishes like yakitori, ramen, soba etc etc are quite authentic. The menu is vast and the food quality is also very good.
I tried the japanese omlette and the salmon sushi followed by some chicken skewers and a bowl of ramen and it was a very pleasant experience.
Word of advice though, if in doubt about any dish take the servers advice. My wife called for a pickled rice sushi inspite of being recommended otherwise by the server and it turned out aweful. Authentic japanese is a lot more beyond sushi and being used to it i enjoyed a lot and am quite adventurous otherwise as well but some people who may associate japanese with sushi and udon only will be treated to a lot more but tread with caution and enjoy with an open mind.
Service - 4.5

Location - 3
The decor has been kept rather like a japanese tea house but dont be put off by the workmanship. It may not look perfect and the location is a bit strange but the food speaks for itself.

Raw fish and raw seafood....on its own or on a bed of rice....YUCK....right????WRONG!!!!Absolutely wrong. There is a huge misconception amongst us that raw fish and raw seafood is bound to stench which in turn is bound to make one feel nauseated. What one needs to know is that good sushi and sashimi are made with only the highest grade of ingredients. Even a Japanese won't like to feel nauseated. The other thing that one should know is that only certain types of fishes and seafood can be eaten just the way they are. Usually bigger fishes like salmon, tuna and sea bass maybe eaten raw and smaller fishes are eaten cooked. Enough of knowledge transfer. Let's get down to business, of reviewing AOI. 
One thing I forgot to do was ask the appropriate meaning for the word Aoi, and Google is providing some vague answers. In Japan, a meal is often started with sashimi with the idea that one is in a position to enjoy the more subtle flavours before moving on to the more forthcoming flavours. I started with sashimi. It was the cuttlefish sashimi that I ordered and the moment I saw it I fell in love with it. It was cut in to thin strips almost like thick glass noodles, pristine white in colour with bright orange salmon roes on top. As one bites in to a single roe there's a delightful explosion of liquidy goodness. Oh I loved that feeling. Then I moved on to the nigiri sushis. I tried them all. How could I not! They were all fresh. My favourite is always the tuna and it was no different here. I liked it so much that I ordered a pair of tuna sushis separately. The presentation was beautiful too. The sushis came on a small wooden platform with a lump of wasabi and a side piece. Then came the day's special. The eel, unagi in Japanese. Talking of eel I had also tried the eel nigiri which was equally brilliant but that sushi was the point in case to demonstrate that sushi is not always raw. the eel was grilled and then put on a bed of vinegared rice and held together by nori. It was really good. The day's special was the grilled eel. Unagi Yakimono. All the flavours were mostly forthcoming. The eel was perfectly grilled. The sauce was tangy and sweet and the texture of the eel was more fish-y than anything else but the crispness of the skin was the game changer. Again full marks. The are yet to get a liquor license. When they do I dearly hope they serve some good sake. Although sake is an acquired taste but some sakes will really complement the food here very well. In desserts they serve only ice cream, some interesting flavours like wasabi and green tea happened to feature on the menu. I ordered the green tea ice cream and to be honest I didn't like it. Had it been a green tea sorbet or gelato I think it would have worked out well but since milk does not really mix with milk this was a disappointment. Especially after the outstanding meal. The service was not too bad but the guy serving my table found it difficult to understand my requests at once and I needed to explain myself more elaborately. Apart form that it was all good. The decor is decent but the live kitchen counter is definitely a win. Also I loved the floor seating thing that they have. Now coming to the point which a Kolkatan always attaches a lot of importance to, the value for money. This place is n the higher side. But its worth it. The sushi is very good and for really good sushi one will need to pay more money. If you are open to experimenting and if you love sushis and sashimis you can't afford to miss this place. Also those people who are under the impression that Japanese food is always raw please go here to change this misconception. I will be going back soon....I have to try the soba and udon noodles and the steamed pork. Soon.

Contrary to popular belief, i did NOT quite like this place. Well, it was quite original Japanese-style, with a japanese style seating for a few. Interiors were good looking, with a very nice open kitchen. There also was a pop japanese song in the background, though sadly, it repeated for half an hour. Now the food, umm, not so good. We had salmon, tuna and cuttlefish sushi's. Salmon, very good, tuna, ok-ish but cuttlefish, terrible letdown. A vegetarian companion had ordered radish and cucumber sushi's. Again, terrible.
We ordered a pork and vegetables, sauteed in soy sauce. Now this was quite good, as was the teriyaki chicken.

Vegetarian Soba noodles, horrible. Though the sticky fried rice was good.
 
Now is when the problem arises. After this hearty meal, I suffered a mild case of food poisoning. Maybe it was the sushi, or maybe the fact that there was so much oil in the food, but this is one of the reasons, i would prefer one of the other restaurants serving Japanese next time i an in a mood.

I went back to this restaurant and was really thrilled to see that they had started serving regular dishes and the restaurant has begun to be open for longer periods. 

I let the warm and friendly staff recommend my lunch for me and was absolutely delighted with their recommendation. First came the Miso soup which tasted wonderful. The mildly warm soup seemed to refresh me and prepared me for the absolute riot of colours and taste that was to follow after that. The staff had recommended a plate of seven course sashimi, which was as delightful to look at as it was in taste. Those like me who love the Japanese way of food, love it because of its varied colours, decoration as well as for its taste. The dish of 7 course sashimi was akin to sheer poetry, such was the vibrancy of colours. There was the orange of flying fish eggs heaped on a corner vying for attention with pieces of brilliant white squid and the orange strips of salmon. All the pieces of sea food were arranged on a bed of julienns of carrots and radish giving an impression of the pieces peeping out from the yellow & white coloured bushes, waiting to be picked out and eaten! 

I was also pleasantly surprised to note that each piece of sea food was fresh--an absolute must if it has to be served as sashimi. 

A real pleasure it was, my second visit and i have already started to plan for my future trip. 

There's 1 small issue which i hope would be noticed by the managers of the restautrant. The exhaust system needs to be made more effective as i noticed that despite the open windows, the smoke seemed to float into the restaurant . It stung my eyes a bit probably because i was sitting very close to the cooking area.



----- 13 Nov, 2013 -----

If you wish to get the feel of Japan while being physically stationed in Calcutta, this is the place to frequent! For those like me who revel in the flavours of Japan, a visit to this place was absolutely thrilling. Besides the usual thing about decorating the place in style that is so similar to the casual style restaurants in Japan. The way the chefs and waiters greet you in Japanese as you enter to the kimono clad lady, the crepe paper covered windows and the floor seating arrangement, all help in creating a sense of nostalgia for those who have been associated with Japanese culture  at some point of time in their lives. 

The taste of the food was equally good-- was told that all the ingredients are brought from Japan. The selection was limited, no doubt that the variety will increase as the restaurant settles down! 

I am eagerly looking forward to going there again.....and again.....!!!!

The newest Japanese restaurant in town, Aoi has a prime location and beautiful interiors. The first aspect that one notices while entering is the open kitchen and warm greetings from the staff. There are two kinds of seating available, one the traditional kind where you sit on a low bench with your legs folded and the other normal table-chair seating. Every waiter and the manager at Aoi goes out of their way to ensure a comfortable meal, and the fact that they have already set their hold strong enough was obvious from a crowded Thursday evening. Huge families, corporate diners, the place was buzzing absolutely. Also I couldn't help but notice that most of the diners knew their choice well from beforehand and had a palate for Japanese food.

My last line simply owes to the fact that I cannot tolerate sushi. I have tried it twice before but mostly with other stuff on the plate, thus could never really make a conclusion about it until today. Either you like or hate sushi, there possibly cannot be a middle path for it. We tried the nilgirizushi comprising six to seven kinds of sushi. It had octopus, salmon, tuna, flying fish eggs, etc along with wasabi. The sushi was cooked well and this I say not from a sushi lover perspective but someone who can just understand the food from the first impression. The vinegared rice, the freshness of the fish was unmistakably perfect but unfortunately I am just not cut out for it. My friend and me had a pretty adventurous time tossing and gulping it down. Oh it is expensive, we possibly could not have wasted it. Nonetheless, we did have to give up on the flying fish eggs. -_- And I would reiterate about our personal dislike here, nothing wrong with the portions served. 

I had researched considerably well before visiting Aoi and thus having yakitori was on my wishlist. We ordered the mixed one comprising chicken, assorted fish, shrimp with hard back cover, chicken stomach and squids. I loved this one, just loved the crunchiness of the skewers and the sauce of the grill. My friend had an issue with this one too because of a lingering raw taste in the mouth from the shrimp. It was not raw but also not we normally understand as succulent. The skewers had a certain texture to it and I enjoyed that.

Following that my friend ordered lime soda and me an apple cinnamon iced tea for beverages, fried pork cutlet and Japanese sticky rice with chicken and assorted vegetables as maincourse. The iced tea was BRILLIANT. I can just keep going here for drinking this iced tea, the kind I have never had before. The pork cutlet was tender soft and tasted really nice with the dip and condiments served. I love sticky rice and this one was PERFECT. The pork culet and sticky rice together made a delectable combination and we loved it. For desserts we ordered green tea and coconut ice cream, both of which came in extremely generous helpings and tasted GOOD - simple milky ice-creams with rich flamboyant flavour. 

Aoi has extremely pleasing service, interiors and quality of food. It depends from person to person if one will be able to appreciate it or not, and yes, at the cost of an expensive meal.

Several Japanese restaurants have recently sprung up in this city and Aoi (also knows as K's), located on the 3rd floor above Fire and Ice Piccolo on Sarat Bose Road is one serving exclusively Japanese cuisine. It's good that people here are are finally able to look beyond Chinese and Thai when it comes to oriental food. 
The restaurant is small, but there are many seating options, including Japanese style low tables. The place however is a bit claustrophobic, almost like a small office. 
We were seated at one of the low tables in a side room, and we were the only two people in that area which is secluded from the rest of the restaurant. A very eager waitress attended to us, she had difficulties understanding English or any other language we spoke, but her eagerness more than made up for her lingual shortcomings. 
The place does not yet have a liquor license, they serve beer on Saturdays according to the menu. We did not try any of the beverages on the menu but they did look interesting with flavours like watermelon and kiwi on offer.
We chose to order an assorted nigri sushi platter and Kushiage moriawase, which was an assortment of tempura fries on skewers, followed by Buta no shougayaki (grilled pork with ginger sauce) and Katsu don (pork cutlet & egg in a bed of rice). The sushi was quite good, although I really don't have the palate for sushi yet. My husband who is a sushi fan seemed to love them. The one I liked most was the one with the salmon.
I loved the Kushiage. The platter had pork, prawns, squid, octopus and chicken and came with a sweet- salty dipping sauce. It was lovely and crisp on the outside, succulent on the inside. This is one I would come back for.
The grilled pork was also quite nice, albeit a bit sweet. It would go great with some sticky rice as a main course.
If you are very hungry and want to order only one dish to fill you up for half a day, go for the katsu don. The pork cutlet on top was good as was the rice, but it gets a bit boring after a while. It is filling and wholesome nevertheless.
There were only ice creams for desserts, but they came in some interesting flavours. We were too full to order any desserts.
The bill was a little above Rs 2000, which is a bit high considering it was minus liquor.
I would definitely go back to this place for their sushi and tempura. I would be great if they can manage to serve beer ans sake as it would make a great combination with the sushi. I also need to brush up on my chopstick skills since I may not get private seating next time I am there. ;)

Great food. It's as authentic as Indian would like. Good diverse menu and prompt service. Finally some affordable sushi in town. Had some tempura prawns, lots of salmon sushi and teriyaki pork. All dishes were outstanding. It's not the cheapest place but being Japanese, where I assume most of the seafood and ingredients are imported, the pricing is perfect. For the main course gorged on some chicken miso noodles and pork in ginger sauce. Was outstanding. Did I mention the mojito was brilliant as well.

The sheer brilliance of the place lies in the simplicity of the cuisine and the warmth of the staff. Will keep visiting regularly. And its high time Calcutta warmed up to the idea of Japanese food.

The food was awesome, I loved it. Had sushi for the first time. Ordered 2 types and then loved it so much that ordered another plate.

Refrained from sitting at the Japanese style table and found the chopsticks difficult to manage as a noobie and so had to fall backupon fork and spoon

Loved the prawn tempura, far better than Mainland China's Golder Fried prawn. Also loved the nonveg platter of Yakiyori.

Had 2 types of noodles and a Japanese style fried rice.

There was a desert surprise waiting for us at the end.
Had seasame icecream, great tea ice and coconut ice cream.
Really loved the new flavours, a welcome change from the usuals.

All the prices are inclusive of tax, and it cost us around 4k for 4 ppl.

A must visit for foodies who wants to try Japanese for the first time.

Fantastic food and ambience. The sushi and sashimi are of course brilliant, made with very fresh fish. The katsu don, pork cutlets on a bed of rice was also fantastic. We also had the fish mushimono which is served with ponzu sauce which is quite different from the sauces we usually taste. The wasabi and green tea ice creams were a revelation, providing a perfect finale to a great meal. The service too was excellent. Looking forward to a visit in the near future.

Really fresh produce. Excellent sashimi and sushi. Great menu. Best Japanese restaurant and the only authentic one in the city. Price little steep but worth the brilliant food. Prior reservation suggested as the place has limited covers.

Finally a Japanese place to really write about!! 
A sudden plan and we landed up at this small tucked away marvel -AOI on the 3rd floor ( the only disadvantage) rest we can only talk about positive things for the time being( newly opened will review again after few months)
Small but cosy with an open kitchen and friendly smiling staff greeting you. Mind you they are even well educated and versed on all the items of the menu so first impression was very well made.
Decor is nothing too overtly Japanese but still the quietness with sudden clangs from the open kitchen is quite pleasant.
We took two seats at the counter facing directly towards the kitchen and was constantly monitoring how calm and quiet these chefs were ( must be trained in Japanese way of congeniality too!!)
The Menu had really exhaustive line of Sashimi's , sushis, yakitoris, Ramens, noodles and main courses. 
We couldn't resist the Sashimi's and a bowl full of 3 different varieties ended up on our plate served well on appropriately shaped and designed ceramics. Freshly made wasabi stole our hearts and so did the fresh meats on .5 deduction through the whole experience was the bit tough squids rest I couldn't complain about.
Then we followed with some Yakitoris again a multiple variety with just the right amount of teriyaki basting . from the fresh tofu to the eggplant and the pork yakitoris had such simplicity yet the freshness of the ingredients.
But what stole our hearts was the udon noodle Ramen with tempura prawns and the subtle flavour of the soyabean was just heartwarming. The udon is apparently freshly imported directly from Japan and that's where the trick lies!! Fresh ingredients, fresh food and lots of love and knowledge while preparing. 
One of the best new finds this season 
I know I will come back explore a lot more their set Bento menus and the main courses one by one.... 
More updates in the coming months...
Finally Kolkata has got its own Japanese restaurant out on the streets!!
Authentic , delightful and extremely tasty and at the end quite pocket friendly considering what we had we only ended up paying 2000 for whole but with other options it can come humbly under 1000 for two people....a great option for the food lovers of Kolkata 
A must try place not once but a lot of times!!! 
My almost 5 (.5 less for chewy squid)stars for this New kid on the block !!

Thumbs up for the Sushi. Really fresh !
Service problems. Waitress was extremely slow and confused.
Major billing errors. They charged us for extra dishes. apart from that they over charged us for certain dishes.
The price on the menu for a dish was half the price that was charged on the bill.

Finally a place in calcutta with real Japanese food. None of that fake 5 star hotel rubbish either. Good variety of Japanese food, though die hard sushi lovers will find it a bit lacking in the variety of sushi. Service is a bit slow but it's new so excusable... Already been there three times in a week

Aoi is the most exciting addition to the Kolkata restaurant scene in quite a while! I just got back from my first meal there. Being  a huge fan of Japanese food and also an experienced Kolkata eater-outer, I went with high hopes but modest expectations. Upon entering we found a charming and warm dining space resembling Japanese eateries elsewhere in the world. It's a small place, with maybe a dozen tables or so. There are 2 tables in a tatami-room-esque area but you don't actually have to sit on the floor -- there is a hole for your feet. I think there was a third tatami-room-table around the corner but I didn't get a good look at it. Those tables were reserved so we sat at a regular table. There is also seating at the bar but it didn't look like a very appealing place to eat  -- maybe for a quick bowl of ramen for lunch.

Getting our order in was a slow process since the server was quite inexperienced. She felt compelled to say "sumimasen" every 5 seconds, and had to check with the chef on several simple questions. But her heart was in the right place -- I'm pretty sure she loved us and wanted us to eat well.

Our order:
green tea
miso soup
agedashi tofu
salmon nigiri
tuna nigiri
mumbai roll
chicken katsu

The green tea was not your typical Japanese green tea. If it was green tea at all it sure didn't taste like it. More like an Oolong or Darjeeling tea. However, it was excellent tea and it came with lemon and honey.

The miso soup was excellent. Not too light. Not too rich.

The agedashi tofu was as it should be, with a nice thin batter on it and a full-flavored broth.

The salmon and tuna nigiris were quite good. Not the best quality fish, but respectable. I would definitely order them again.  Too bad the fish selection is so small. I would love to see some Uni, Unagi, Salmon roe, Toro, Otoro, etc. But I can understand that it's not feasible yet in Kolkata.

The roll was completely wrong but still delicious. The roll we ordered was supposed to be Ebi and avacado but instead we got imitation crab and cucumber with roe on the outside. It would be nice to have a salmon and avacado roll or Unagi and cucumber and avacado, a classic!

Finally, the chicken katsu was great. The batter was a little thick relative to the amount of chicken, but because it was light and not oily, and had a nice flavor, we really enjoyed it. It came with some refreshing salad, a tangy sauce, and a smidgen of hot mustard.

Several things were not available from the menu.  We wanted pork katsu, gyoza and snapper nigiri but none of them were available despite being on the menu.

Getting the bill was a bit of a challenge because our server was preoccupied with some people who were fondling the menus instead of ordering and she didn't have the experience to leave them alone for a while.

Overall, Aoi delivered in quality tasty food, authenticity, ambiance and price. Our bill came to Rs. 1960 including tax for 2 people, and it was worth every penny.

By the time we left (having arrived on the early side for dinner) the place was full. Half of the customers were Japanese, which says something!

Update: second outing. Excellent unagi now available! Good portion size (nigiri) but quite pricey. Two things we ordered this time I would not order again. The steamed seafood (menu says "fish") and veggies was boring. The Pork Katsu Donburi just didn't work. The katsu was soggy wrapped in omelete, and the overall taste of the rice etc wasn't very good. I much preferred the simple crispy chicken katsu last time. Also, last time there were no taxes but this time there are - now the bill is 20% higher.

This is the most refreshing dining experience in Calcutta today. Japanese food is served in a traditional way here, true to the cuisine in every sense. The attention to detail, service, ambience and quality of food is near perfection. Unlike what we club together and serve everywhere as "pan Asian cuisine" with chili and garlic thrown into everything, this place caters to those who love traditional Japanese food, which is a cultivated taste. While the cuisine itself is not "cheap" due to the quality and preparation style, which is not simple and easy to make at home, the pricing here is perfect. I highly recommend this place to anybody who would like a healthy wholesome meal with variety of dishes and preparation styles, and most importantly a much needed CHANGE!
