Just an average sweet shop with normal varieties of sweets like you find in most outlets. 
Their sandesh can come out stale sometimes so be careful.

Well it's actually a sweet shop......but snacks are available here in the evening......the mutton chop is very good....the veg chop is also nice but the fish fry & fish chop lacks quality. The singaras(samosas) are decent. Don't dare to try the Kobiraji.
