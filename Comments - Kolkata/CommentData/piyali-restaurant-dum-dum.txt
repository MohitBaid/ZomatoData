Pretty ordinary. Taste bad. we ordered reshmi butter masala. We have no idea it can taste so sweet. It looks like a dessert. Peas pulao rice was hard. the manchurian chicken was good in taste. Mattar Paneer was ok in taste

Located at the heart of Gorabazar it is one of the busiest joints in the locality. Looks-wise it will definitely going to grab your attention and will invite you to try. Now lets comes to the food. There are two sides of a coin. one side is when ask for home delivery. I had ordered food from here couple of times and trust me both quantity  and quality both were great. Contradictory when I personally visited the place for a quick bite or for dining same items were no way closer to which I had earlier. For example I asked for crispy chicken for home delivery, It was juicy- crunchy- great flavor, same thing when I had there, I ate only half plate coz I couldn't risk of loosing my teeth. It was chewy, soggy . So to me its a lottery place, u never know what you are going to end up with. Still I would say give it a try.  Kashmiri Aloo-dum and Fish fry are the best things in the menu.

Good place been hear several times.  Needs to improve service quality and behaviour amongst staff. Staff is not attentive towards business. But if you hungry middle of gora bazaar it's OK you can go here.

Had the food delivered.So no comments on the ambience and decor neither the staff.
But the food was awful. The chicken bharta was anything but a bharta with ridiculous amount of oil stale tasting with horrendous flavour. The chicken tikka needed to be grilled more . The saving grace the pudina chutney the served..A very bad experience with the food.

To those mughlai food lovers to whom Arsalan and Aminia are benchmark of good biryani destinations , you need to magnify your search and come here and get bowled over by the awesome quality and ambience of a "Good Mughlai Restaurant " . Piyali  restaurant has really come a long way their basic outlet to a luxury fine dining . It's not my first time here but I could not open down my last awesome experience here so finally came here and doing it . 
                     
° Ambience & Service ( 5  / 5 ) :- A fine looking interior for a classic fine dining . The ambience is top notch and something you will immediately notice on entering .The staff is well-dressed, polite and very helpful . No mughlai restaurant is complete without it splendid array of kabaabs and although we were spoilt for choice we still managed to select 2 mind blowing kabaab starters . One of their specialties and a must ordered item . This is as good as it gets . Just stunning .

Here common items are good like Soup, Noodles,Roll,Mughlai but  for any special kinds of items are not good.Price is nominal and no Vat and tax ,which is a good thing.I have ordered soup,fish fry and mix noodles where fish fry was horrible,though soup and noddles were good.

In all honesty, they are the 'Internet Explorer' of all Web Browsers. If you have a hell lot of time to waste on a restaurant by waiting for your food, this is the place to be.
It took them about an hour to get the food. I mean, seriously?
The restaurant looks clean, tidy enough to make you step for a fast bite, but WAIT! No fast bites. Only slow bites.
The food is just average with poor management.
One of those places where you should be paid to eat, rather than the other way round.
'Disappointed'

Location: Gora Bazar
Pros: Quite a new eatery in the area which has seen a major change in itz namin' along with itz owners probably. The space is large to cater the huge base. Food is good. You can give it a try to itz Punjabi delicacies. Well behaved staffs.
Cons: Slow service. Limitation in the variety overall.
Do not leave the place without: Havin' the bengali thalis n it may surprise you!
