Ordered onion uttapam with coffee while my brother was getting his computer assembled at M.D computers. Took a walk and landed up here.Really liked the simplicity and taste of the food served here. Non vegetarian won't miss meat for sure. The uttapam was out of the world.

Located in central business district, Anand is a fast food restaurant primarily known for it's south indian food, it has been one of the main stays for bussinesman hosting clients for a quick bite, feel it has been living in it's past glory and food quality has dipped considerably, on my last visit asked the management to up their game.

This restaurant had been long wishlisted , i was there at chandni chowk for personal work yesterday and couldn't resist to check out the much famed south indian fare here. Ordered a Cheese Coriander Masala Dosa and Mixed Uttappam with two cups of Filter coffee . The restaurant was full house at lunch time and we had to wait for some time to get served. I didn't find the uttapam exceptional , but the Dosa is something i wish to revisit for.

Just one word to describe this restaurant - Amazing!! Everything- the food, the ambience, the attitude of waiters and service staff and the desert. I haven't had such good food for a while. It impressed me to the extent that I  am writing this review sitting at the restaurant itself. We are from chandigarh and would suggest everyone who visits Calcutta to do have food at this place once 👌

A very old South Indian restaurant if u come to central area and wanna eat south Indian then this is the place for you. 
The decor is basic and staff is polite according to their own mood 

RAJ KACHORI- was very tasty today and what I liked is that the taste is always constant 

IDLY- it was fluffy and big today not usually this size or this fluffy 

VADA- was also nice and crisp today and tasted good

MIX UTTAPAM- was average today I have had better here only the vegetables got a little to burned today 

CHEESE ONION DOSA- it was the highlight of today was the best dish compared to the rest had good flavour of cheese and lightly fired onions and it wasn't oily and also tasted fresh

This place is always filled with people whenever I go. It is prominent because this restaurant offers the best south Indian food in the town. People stand in queues on a Sunday evening for their turn to come for getting inside the restaurant. The cheese dosa is my personal favorite. Pav bhaji is lip smacking. Chole bhature is decent. Ambience is nothing to boast about but the food covers it all up.

The Wafer Masala dosa with cheese is awesome as well.
Located opposite to E-Mall, this attracts all the central office crowd. 
Reasonable with a pleasant ambiance makes it still a hot place (it was my parent's favorite as well)

Went there with my family about a couple of months back.. Came back home with acid refluxes and bitter tasting coconut chutney in the mouth..

Having visited the entire length and breadth of our entire nation and having tasted south indian food almost everywhere, I can safely conclude that the food of this restaurant is pretty ordinary and nothing worth its hype. The items are costly too, compared to its taste/worth/value. Even ordinary restaurants in Mangluru, Mumbai and Chennai, have much much more authentic and better tasting dosas, idlis and vadas and are much more reasonably priced..

Those who think that the food of this restaurant is good, have either never had better South Indian food or they have absolutely no idea about good quality and taste..

Service is also not very good. They gave us cold vadas and when asked to replace it with hot vadas, firstly they argued with us a lot (with a tone that eat whatever is served to you), and then replaced it with the same vadas re-fried, which made it soggy and dripping with a load of oil.. The dosas tasted as if the batter consisted of only rice and hardly any lentils at all.. They gave us filter coffee made with nescafe.. It appears that the owner is taking undue advantage of its decades old reputation and passing on lower quality products under the garb of the same, with a sheer motive to just anyhow make more money..

The only reason I have given them 1.5 stars is that ambience is all right, so if you are that person who can just gobble anything without any focus on the taste or quality, then you can visit the restaurant..

If your aim is good food, I'll suggest hunt for some place better..

The good old story of south Indian and this outlet is what everyone has from childhood, for every person out here in Kolkata.

This place is known to all age groups and preferred for team lunches and family dinner. Chola bhatura is also recommended after Dosa's here. Dosa's here is nothing extra ordinary now and also the staff need proper training.

Come here for old nostalgic feelings and office lunches in this corporate area.

I used to go there a lot as a kid. So it was a nostalgic moment to visit this place again after decades.
The place has its old charm. They have removed the sofas and added chairs. Fish tanks, used to be the fad at that time, are still there. Overall nice ambience.

Comming to the food we ordered cheese masala dosa, which was awesome, high calorie but heavenly.
The masala dosa (normal) and vada were also tasty.
Cutney and sambhar were very good, complemented the food very well.

However the kids ordered pizza, which was similar as served by any road side vendor, just plain and simple boring.

We had some chola bhature also, which i personally didnot liked maybe coz after staying in delhi for so long one develops very high standard for punjabi food.

You can order anything from south indian menu here. For other things check out yourself.

This restaurant is famous for its finger licking south indian cuisine and being situated in chandni chawk, we went there on a sunday morning around 8am for an early morning breakfast.

Like any other restaurants in Kolkata, this restaurant has a stairs that leads up to the restaurant. Low ceiling and a bit tight in space, do not let that distract you from the main thing. The servers were good and energetic for the morning rush and this place can be a bit crowded, even in the morning, and i dont doubt why since their south indian is to die for.

We ordered for one cheese masala dosa, one cheese plain dosa, one idli ( two pieces ), one vada ( two pieces ), one uttampam and one vanilla milkshake. The food was so good that we had to extra for 3 more vada ( 6 pieces ). The good thing about this restaurant is that the servers keeps on refilling the sambhar and coconut chutney even without being asked, so that saves us some energy.

Despite being an old restaurant, they do accept cards so dont worry if you're cashless. The food is really delicious and pocket friendly. Do visit, i totally recommend.

Located just opposite emall,chandni chowk. Visited with office colleagues for a saturday afternoon lunch. The place was busy, and well maintained and hygienic. Coming to the food, it was good but nothing extraordinary. The hype of this place, was not understood by me. Maybe its been there for so long, so its kind of a heritage restaurant of the office area of chandni chowk. We ordered dosa, uttapam, chats, shakes, ice cream and pizza. The pizza was most disappointing followed by the uttapam, home made pizza's are better than what they served. I would recommend you to go for the chola batura, masala dosa and the tutty fruity. Not a must visit, but as there aren't much options in this area, so you can visit anand, if you are along with your work partners who prefer vegeterian food.

It's one of my favourite places. I've been there quite a number of times. Its location is nice. Near the metro "chandni chowk". Easy to go via public transport. (Although most people use ola/uber now.)
Anand is synonymous with south indian delicacies. Along with south indian, raj kachori is worth trying. The Restaurant is quite crowded on holidays or weekends. But they have a lot of space and a good managing staff. The service is good. The decor and ambience not bad. The best part being the FOOD.  Its perfect for family.

2) They mainly specialize in south indian food. i had onion sada dosa and masala dosa. Both were yummmm.Special points for a delicious tangy sambhar.
3) The ambience is nice. Staff is cooperative.

For a decent outing and wholesome south indian food this is quite awesome.

Food: Great food, almost feels like I've never left home!

Ambience: it's just like being in a Darshini at home! The same crowded restaurant and hustle and bustle, but slightly more upscale. 

Price: Quite reasonable considering that there would be very few south Indian chefs here in Kolkata. 

Service: Service was prompt but there was a slight goof up where we were charged for an item that never came. Also, the practice of charging extra for sambar and chutney irritated me. At one point, we asked for one extra sambar cup - and the waiter gave us 4 extra sambar cups and 4 chutney cups. He also kept taking them away when we told him we weren't done, and gave us an extra. So I downrated from 4.5 to 3.5.

This legend holds its own amongst all the south Indian restaurants in the city. Like most legends nothing ever changes here. Same decor , same staff and same old lip smacking food. 
Have been here countless times only to drop back again. 
"Beauty lies is simplicity" and this is proven by their papdi chat. (just papdi, bhujia, curd and green chilli). Always my first order everytime i go there. Unlike most papdi chats filled with dal , moat etc etc etc.
Their south Indian is very good and one can order almost any item.

The best item for me is their Tutty Fruity. The amalgamation of crisp dry fruits along with soft and creamy ice cream with fruits for all the flavors is nothing short of divinity. 
Give this a shot.

Top that with a plate of dahi vadas and a cup of hot coffee and you will be at peace.  Been going there since ages and the best bit,  the food tastes exactly the same as it was 20 years back.

An old outlet of pure veg and South Indian dishes suggested by my parents. Had decent ambiance. Tried Cheese Masala Dosa which costed 450 for 3. Though very much pocket friendly, I have tasted same at a lower price in other cities. Wouldn't complain against quantity and quality.

Food is good but same can be found at many other restaurants in kolkata with better service. Their Service is pathetic. Just because it's an old restaurant and ppl visit regularly they have become ignorant about the service.

I have been going to this restaurant since I was a kid.
Having tried almost every dish on their menu,I can safely say that it's one of the best South Indian restaurants in terms of taste, quality and quantity.
Their dosas,idlis,uttapams,Pav Bhaji and Pizzas are great.
P.S.: Do not except Chola Bhatura to have a North Indian flavour.Their Chola Bhatura is different with a garlic-y taste.

Awesome experience. Taste was awesome. Location of outlet was easy reach. Consumer do get the value for each money they spend. Its a must visit place for people who love taking a bite of dosas, idli etc. Just a small suggestion, they can increase varieties by offering more type of dishes. Apart from it everything is worth a experience.

"Anand" was recommended by a dear friend of mine a couple of days back for it's mouth watering South-Indian snacks. Happened to visit Chandni today and after wrapping up my work stepped outside only to be exhausted by the humidity and a stomach rumbling hungry on top of it.🙀 Just as I started looking on Zomato for nearby eateries, caught sight of this place standing diagonally opposite to E-mall on the other side of the road.

Upon entering, a staircase on the right led me to the dining on the first floor. They have seating available on the ground floor as well. With a spacious layout and ample seating, the interior although dimly lit, looks nicely decorated with potted plants and acquariums. But if you take a closer look the decor seems very 70's and might have undergone a renovation in the past few years. Perhaps they can rethink those paper place-mats with blue sketches of Kolkata landmarks on the tables. Their fried idlis are supposed to be deep fried and not the masala version that I initially thought and am not so fond of masala dosas either. So settled down for a plate a of plain idly and butter sada dosa. 

⏹PLAIN IDLY - They were soft and fluffy but somehow missing the super whiteness that I like in Idlis. I assume that could be due to the use of ground fenugreek seeds or may be the rice:dal ratio factor. Came with the usual accompaniments of coconut chutney and sambar. The latter seemed to fare better.

⏹SADA BUTTER DOSA - The paper dosa was perfectly made with buttery deliciousness and crispy till the very last bite. I gulped down the entire thing almost without the sambar and chutney.😸

⏹FILTER COFFEE - A cup of South-Indian filter coffee was served pipping hot and frothy. It was quite strong and milky with a bit of sweetness added as per my instruction. Traditionally, most Udipi restaurants serve filter coffee in stainless steel dabarah and tumblers. So no matter how good a filter coffee is, I will still prefer it be served in a traditional manner.😼

The staff was amiable and service attentive. They actually served the filter coffee at the very end of the meal without having to mention it. My friend told me the place is usually jam-packed on Sundays and can get congested there. Prices are a bit on the steeper side, total bill amount came down to 200 INR (with taxes).

Over the years, Anand has gained an iconic status in the city as one of the staff enlightened me, this place being more than 70 years old. Pleased to have discovered this landmark, I am definitely coming back very soon to try the waffle dosa and the filter coffee of course!😺

A very old place in the city of joy, and probably one of the better places to visit at any point of time. Being so old to the city, it becomes difficult to maintain its reputation but this place has done it over the years and will surely continue doing it as the days pass by.
The service at Anand is good with almost all the waiters attending the table being working there for quite some time now. The food is delicious, though the place is famous for its south indian food, I would still recommend giving paw bhaji a try. Traditional south indian filter coffee is a must have for the coffee lovers. Overall nobody leaves this place with an empty stomach or an unsatisfied heart.

Anand is one of those known spots in the city. It's been around for ages and it is the restaurant to go to for South Indian food. The food is good, comes hot and fresh and the staff are helpful. The ambiance is ok though the lighting is a bit dull. All in all a regular to many kolkatans for south Indian delacies. You can't go wrong with choosing Anand if it's South Indian food you want.

This veg restaurant is located at Chandni Chowk, near E Mall. It mainly serves South Indian delicacies along with other items.

Ambience is simple  with nice sitting arrangements.

Service is nice.

Tried Butter Rava  Dosa &  Raj kachori along with a friend. Both were well made & tasty.

Pocket pinch is bit high but quantity is sufficient.

Dosas: Crisp and cooked to perfection with a generous portion of the masala. The masala is neither too spicy nor bland. Coriander dosa, paper wafer masala dosa, ghee-cheese-wafer dosa and the traditional plain (and masala) dosas are a must try.
Idly, sambhar vada, fried idly- Wholesome in terms of portion and tasty. The vada was too oily. Fried Idly Chips are an innovative dish.
Uttapam: Well-crafted with vegetables and a batter base which is neither too thick nor too thin. The uttapam, on the contrary was less oily and perfect in texture.
Pav bhaji, chana bhature, bhole bhature: Tasty, nevertheless, but should not be of prime concern as Anand's dosa is it's signature. The pav bhaji is recommended, however.
Pizzas: Sadly, not at all a good fit.
Filter coffee: A must try. It is a perfect personification of the traditional Madras coffee.
Anand Restaurant is like an old friend who spreads out his/her arms and welcomes us whenever we meet. The decor, ambience and service is excellent. It is near the Chadni Chowk Metro station, which makes it's location a prime one. Highly recommended for anybody who wants to try out light, authentic South Indian cuisine.
Pocket-pinch: Cheap (An average of 6 dishes, including 2 dosas, a plate of idly, pav bhaji,an onion uttapam, and filter coffee would cost within 600 bucks).

On a cold evening when I was searching for a snacks point near Esplanade, then Zomato helps me to headed towards Anand restaurant.  A specialist in South Indian cuisine, Anand is quite popular with their food and service. The working staff are very humble and the waiter's walk barefoot inside the restaurant premise. I have asked one cheese onion masala Dosa and a filter coffee. Previously I have tried the butter Dosa in many restaurants but this cheese dosa is somewhat different.. The filter coffee is good. And the price is Rs.200 with tax. Looking to the bill slightly over priced. Must visit from my side.

Situated at 19 Cr Avenue, Near Dalhousie Square Area, Kolkata, Anand has been an iconic south Indian restaurant since time immemorial. However, the owners think that they can continue with their legacy even till date. Agree their food tastes great but running a food business is not all about taste and quality. A lot of other factors are important too. 

Service is pathetic, Attitude hits above the roof, Politeness amongst the servers is found in the dustbin and misdemeanor is sky high. But who cares as the prices are very-very competitive and pocket friendly and the Quality is just too good. So, if you are one of those foodie who cares about service and demeanor this joint can be given a miss from thousand miles apart. 

2 Star Rating only for the pathetic Service.

Lunched on their plate of poori here one afternoon which was really satisfying. Bought home their vada (sada) and cheese sada dosa which were very tasty. The vada dipped in sambar and chutney tasted very much like the original South Indian taste you get to relish in the South, unlike some versions of them available in the city that fail at best in emulating the quintessential South Indian delicacies.
Known for their legendary servings, Anand was a satisfactory choice.

Anand my childhood favorite joint for south Indian cuisine. But, with time this place has deteriorated in its food quality and taste. The problem is with the management or chef i don't know. The chutney is watery and tasteless, the masala is full of black pepper, caused me chest burn. Filter coffee given was cold to which the waiter argued. Thumbs down.

We have been visiting this place since our childhood and believe that this restaurant has lost its glory.This place is mainly known for its South Indian food.Before the equation used to be like "South indian=Anand".But now the taste which this restaurant use to serve in its dishes are gone.

Service-The service at this place is quite fast and reliable except on sundays and holidays.The staff is also very cooperative.

Ambiance-This place is a two storey eatery with very simple interior.The ambiance at this place seems to be quite noisy especially if you visit during holidays.

Food-As said the dishes served at this place donot have the same taste like before.South Indian used to the speciality of this place.We have tried almost all of their dishes but what we use to like the most are-
1:Fried idli curd
2:Cheese dosa
3:Mixed uttapam
4:Special chutney
5:Filter coffee
6:Tutty fruity ice cream

Service-4/5
Ambiace-3.5/5
Food-3/5

We really hope that this place will soon show improvements in its dishes but whenever you visit try their south indian dishes with special chutney.😃😃

Sunday lunch. We had to wait for our table for a few minutes. Unfortunately no waiting place. We had to stand by the door. The place is a bit noisy but clean and hygienic. Service and staff both are satisfactory. Decor is minimum. Had the cheese masala dosa and the coriander dosa. Happy with both. Also the chutney and sambar were at par. Now for dessert we ordered the triple sundae-tooty fruity. Well, it was something like that. What a grave mistake! Had two spoons and had to waste the rest. Now when we were about to pay for the bill, they suddenly tell us cards aren't accepted. Huge disappointment. Three stars should be enough.

Went today (i.e. Saturday) in the afternoon. The restaurant is just the opposite side of the Emall. The restaurant was not congested as read in the reviews. We (me and my friend) got a seat easily. The service was awesome. Water is served as soon as we sat. They gave the menu. We ordered the Cheese Masala Dosa, Special Chutney and Badam Halwa. Most of the reviewers said that Cheese Masala Dosa is too good so we ordered it. Believe me, they weren't lying a bit. It's seriously awesome. I just feel in love with that. Normal sambar and Chutney is served with it. Missed the Special Chutney as they said it would take some time. Better luck next time. Coming to the Badam Halwa. It's absolutely not what you are thinking it is. It is just a Badam Halwa shaped like a cookie. If you have seen "Thekua", then you can easily assume the shape and size. It is a thekua made of Badam. But it is the "Chota Packet Bada Dhamaka". It was so nice that we ordered two for each of us. Worth the money. 
Overall review, it's worth a shot. You should go there.

I still remember how we used to wait for hours with a token number to enter Anand. Authentic and Delicious South Indian food is what you should expect here. Nice family ambience. Staff well trained and polite. Amazingly fast Service. Usually frequent this place for their cheese masala dosa, Crisp sada Dosa, Vada /Idli dipped in Sambar, Raj kachori, Uttapams and much more.

Located near the chandni metro station, the place is very easy to spot. Stairs leading to the restaurant, you notice the dark ambience which instantly reminds you of a restaurant from the 70s. The well maintained aquarium and the seat arrangement is definitely worth a mention. One of the oldest restaurants in town, this is the place for a cheap south Indian meal. Its food tastes the same as it tasted twenty years ago. No compromise on quality is its flagship.
Coming to the food, the restaurant serves south Indian, snacks and pizzas.
You would like to try
Cheese masala dosa- the combination of cheese and masala is lip smacking 
Personally I am a big fan of their dosas ,so you can choose any. The Mysore masala dosa is a must try too.
Idly is nice and the vada is very regular.
You can try the idly finger chips
Mixed utappam - Very crunchy and tasty.
Chola bhatura - If you aren't a big fan of South Indian, go for this.
Raj kachodi - Total blend of masala and curd.worth a try.
Pav bhaji- spicy and full of butter.
Filter coffee is not recommended.

I would not recommend the pizzas and 
Other snacks.
The staff is usually courteous . They need a lot of training though.

Giving it 5 stars because of the taste of its dosa and chutney  which I feel haven't changed a bit from the time I came here for the first time yes the crowd counts have decreased to what it was in early 90s,  (We use to wait for hours to get inside on Sunday).Went to Chandni Chowk yesterday and I make sure that whenever I go to Chandni I visit this place as soon as you enter the restaurant the smell of the southindian gets to you We ordered for paper sada dosa uttapam and idli 
All the three items were very good and the coconut chutney was very delicious price is also ok..it's one of the best serving South Indian restaurant of Kolkata and they make sure they keep upto it ...😊

Its located near Chandi Chowk metro and opposite to E-Mall.

Anand Restaurant grabs its place as one of the oldest and legendary restaurant in the city. I have been there incalculable number of times since my childhood as there weren’t many options back in the day and the South Indian cuisine is my favourite here. The interiors have been the same since its inception and have much of a homely feel. The surroundings are adorned with plants and aquariums. As a child I have always been fascinated.

The food here has been the same in terms of quality, over the years. I have always been fond of the Cheese Masala Dosa here. The dosa is crisp and buttery along with nice quantity of molten cheese. The chutneys are also good.

The prices are a bit high when compared to other similar restaurants. But the south indian food is definitely worth a try here.

ANAND..My favorite South Indian Restaurant..Its like my second home..have been here innumerable times..masala dosa, coconut uttapam, masala dosa, rava dosa, idly, vada, paw bhaji, tuti fruti icecream, fresh lime soda...and the list goes on...from my childhood i have been visiting this place..till date the same quality of food..same old humble staff, same ambience and environment..m just surprised how they maintain the consistency in all the spheres..hats off..
Thier interiors have been the same since the time i first visited this restaurant..!
Now jumping directly to the food..south indian is best here..masala dosa is my personal favourite..then mixed uttapam is also very good..free servings of chutney and sambhar..
Other than south indian paw bhaji, tikia chola & chola bhatura are good to taste..lipsmacking actually..
In desserts Tuty Fruity ice cream with wafer is the best.Its simply awesome.!
To all the people out there this place is a must visit.!

Located just opposite E-mall in Chandni Chowk, Anand is a vegetarian restaurant that has been around for a long time. I have always wanted to visit the place and I finally did, one fine evening, for dinner with a friend. The interiors had an interesting decor, very inviting and cozy, a "family-meal" kind of place. 

We ordered 2 dosas, a cheese wafer dosa and a ghee wafer dosa along with a cup of filter coffee to wash it down and finally a tutti-frutti to finish. The dosas were absolutely brilliant - wafer-thin exterior, an extremely moreish potato filling and a deliciously thick sambar and coconut chutney. The porton size was huge and we were left in the end with greasy fingers, a most satisfactory experience. The filter coffee was nice as well, served with sugar on the side. The tutti-frutti had a fair bit of fruit, both fresh and candied, and it was a lovely way to end the meal. Their Raj Kachori chaat, which I had on another visit, was pretty good, with crispy kachori filled with all sorts of goodies, from potatoes and moong dal to chana and papri, all tied together with curd and tangy imli chutney.

I have not eaten a fair load of dosas but their dosa definitely stole my heart. Service is excellent, with food reaching our tables within around 5 minutes from ordering. Prices are just a tad bit on the higher side, but considering the quality of the food, there really isn't much room for complaint. If you are ever in that area and craving something a bit lighter, this place is a must-visit.

This one is probably one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata famous 4 it's South Indian delicacies. I have been going to this restaurant since my childhood. Though famous for its South Indian food, I must say that this is a place where u can order anything and u wont get wrong. They offer fresh juice, soda based drinks and even milk based drinks and majorly all are good. They offer a huge variety for South Indian food, be it dosas, idly, uttapam, vada, and all the preparations are good.

They offer special chutney, which is to be ordered separately, and a must for foodies. Their usual sambhar & chutney is also tasty, which they provide u virtually unlimited with the south indian food.

Nowadays they are also serving other dishes like Pav Bhaji, Chhola Bhatura, even pizza, and as I mentioned earlier, u wont go wrong if u order anything here.

I am not well acquainted with South Indian food. Among the restaurant I have tried, this one is the best for South Indian food. Food quality is great being it Dosa, Stuffed idli, utthapam or Upma. Their filter coffe is also nice.
Located just opposite to Emall, so it's very easy to find it from chandni metro station. Another famous restaurant for Chinese food, 'crystal chimney' is adjacent to it.
Decoration is impressive. Ambience is perfect for family dining. It opens at 9 AM, therefore having a breakfast here is a good option.
Staffs are decent and service is OK.
Price is higher than any average south Indian food joint but considering its ambience,food quality and service I must say it's absolutely value for money.
Recommend. Even if you don't like south Indian food, just try it at least once.
They also serve pizzas.

One of the few places that thankfully opens up early in the morning ( 9:30 am)😅. While majority of places open up at atleast 11:30 am in Kolkata, places like anand restaurant are there to address your breakfast concerns.  Additionally one of my friends called it as 'best south indian cuisine serving joint in town !' Hence I had to give it a try . Pleasant air conditioned indoors (contrast to the hot and humid weather outside). Soft spoken and courteous staff. The best part however , is certainly the food. Great taste , pretty much authentic , fresh and piping hot. A perfect breakfast treat. Their menu is extensive enough and spoils you with choices. Food preparation takes some time , but it's worth the wait. A mix veg uthapam and a sweet lassi fetched me a bill of just rs. 140 !!!  ( Which is unbelievably cheap !) Apparently this place has been up and running since the post independence era (1953 ? Perhaps ?) Which kind of makes them a legend already. Keep up the good work ! Looking forward to another breakfast treat there soon !

However, with time, the quality of food has gone down. It is not the same what it used to be when it opened its doors or even 5 years ago. I wish they look into this and improve their quality. I'll be the first one to visit them.

Being a hardcore non-veg still I do prefer anand sometimes,only due to the taste they offer. They have all vegetarian items, mainly south Indian, chats and veg north Indian ones. As well they do have fruit salads with ice creams of different varieties,  but the best one is their special tuttyfrutty fruit salad with ice cream..
 They have excellent service, and yes it's really fast. The ambience is homely and one can enjoy the food in a chilled relaxed atmosphere(prime priority for this summer).

When talking about South Indian Restaurants in Kolkata, Anand Restaurant comes as one of the toppest. Chandni Chowk is full of Chinese Restaurants, but Anand is for those looking for something else to eat.

Location : Anand Restaurant is located just opposite to E-Mall at Chandni Chowk. Its just beside Crystal Chimney & Chandni Chowk Metro Station gate.

Staffs & Management : All staffs of Anand are well dressed in white. They behave very well & serves very fast.

Decorations : The sittings are on the first floor. Just take the stairs & you are already impressed. The restaurant is huge inside with lots of sittings capability. Wooden statues, Old pictures of Kolkata on designed walls, Decorative tress, Old style wooden chairs & table decorated with artificial flowers & old style, Warm white lightings all are set very well & makes the ambience very good. The ambience is perfect for a family dinner.

Food : The list of the dishes on their menu card is decently spread. I am not a huge fan of South Indian foods, so I decided to go with their basic Sada Dosa.

Sada Dosa : As expected the Dosa was huge, it was balanced & served in a small steel plate. Dosa was crispy fried that just felt awesome till the end. Although it was plain dosa still it tasted very very good. With lite taste it is for all kind of people. Sambhar & Chatney provided tasted excellent with the crispy dosa.

Price : Their menu card is little odd in the sense all the dishes are priced an odd & rare number, like Rs. 58.30. That's probably help them to make a round figure after adding taxes.

Conclusion : Anand is known as one of the best South Indian restaurant in Kolkata & it definitely is. From the ambience of the restaurant to their excellent food quality all total its a pleasurable experience for South Indian dish lovers. If you don't like South Indian foods at all just like me, still I recommend you to visit Anand & try. You will fall in love with their food.

An all of a sudden craving for South Indian food led me and my friends to enter the Anand Restaurant. Located just next to the Chandni Chowk Metro Station, the restaurant put a sure shot smile on our face.
What all we tried- Idly Finger Chips (strongly recommended), Idly Pakora, Waffer Masala Dosa (super amazing), Ghee Masala Dosa, Cheese Dosa, Tomato Uthapam, Onion Masala Dosa ( very well prepared) & Filter Coffee (super good aroma). Bill came out to be 1140, value for money is just an understatement here.
Other aspects - Quick Service, Well Trained Staff, Neat cutlery, Average Ambience ( a bit crammed but then that's natural for all the ancient restaurants in the city), waiting times can be upto 15 min on a weekday.
Overall 4/5, definitely recommended.

Love this place to bits.
Anand is one of the few places in Kolkata which is vegetarian, makes brilliant food and yet very classy enough for a night out, or a business meeting, or even a date.
I took out mom here one evening post shopping.
We were really tired and famished and the courteous waiters not only helped haul our stuff up the stairs, but polite enough to get us cold water once we sat.
The decor was classy. Old, high seats, so many mirrors, dim lighting. I wish the seats were spaced out a bit more though.
We ordered Chole Bhature for me (yes Anand is predominantly south Indian, hence didn't have big hopes on this)
A Mysore Masala Dosa for mom, a salty lassi and a pineapple milkshake for mom.
Service is kinda relaxed in evenings here (they served our food by around the 15 min mark)
And the food floored me.
My chole was gorgeously spicy, tad bit sweet yet had the punch of imli which I loved. The bhaturas were crisp, on the fatter side though. Two of them stuffed me to the brim.
The lassi was really, really thick (the ones you can slurp, not sip) and had very less ice.
Mom's dosa came redolently smelling of ghee, the mash inside was diligently spiced, almost like our barir alu r torkari. Loved the coating of spices in the dosa, assertive but very balanced. And shatter crisp in most of it.
The coconut chutney (banana leaf makes better) was good, chunky and soothing, but slightly less creamy.
Sambar was brilliant, the best I had, no doubt.
I loved the double portions of sambar and chutney (who doesn't love bigger portions of good things?)
Milkshake was not candy sweet, very creamy and mildly tasting of pineapple flavouring. While the texture was perfect, I wish it was a bit stronger on the pineapple flavour.
Service was very polite, quick and brilliant absolutely.
Two of us were fully stuffed post alll this., bill came to ₹370, all inclusive.
Definitely coming back here!
----_------------------------_--------------------_----------
So I came back here with mom and gran, and was so gratified to see the service just as warm, the food just as good.
We got Raj Kachauris this time, with the Chole Bhature i dearly loved.
Both dishes were very well made, and very filling.
The sweet and sour lime soda sweetened our deal.
In love with this place!

Went there on a Friday afternoon with family for lunch. On the first floor, except for the last two tables in the end every table was full. We ordered a plate of idly vada and dahi vada (for "starters"). The idly was so soft, it just melts in the mouth. Vada was good too. Dahi vada was amazing. Then for main course we had a cheese rawa masala dosa, onion rawa masala dosa. Both were too good. The cheese dosa was heavy. The sambar and thick coconut chutney alongside were just perfectly made. A must visit for one time. You'll come again, that's for sure.

The street opposite the e-Mall just near the Chandni Chowk metro is probably the best place to be if you are short on money yet looking for some tasty sumptuous food. Crystal Chimney and Anand, while chalk and cheese in terms of the cuisine they offer, are the two places that make this street so special for the aforementioned group of foodies. 
 

I will not review any single item from the menu for this place : all sorts of South Indian food are available here for you to gorge on as you sit in their padded cushion chairs inhaling the rich smell of sambhar mixed with agarbatti. Special mention : fried idli curd, which is like the north Indian dahi vada except for fried idli in place of the vada. And couple that with their wide range of milk shakes and sherbets, you can treat yourself to a cheap, tasty and fulfilling meal.

I have been going to this place for more than 10 years now. The taste of dosas is exactly the way it always used to be. A nice place to hang out with friends if all that you are looking for, is decent snacks and good conversation. This place has still retained its charm.

I had a very horrible experience at Anand. The person who was taking order was very rude in nature. He had no courtsey how to talk to the customers. We ordered for one plate Idli and Vada in which we wanted Vada dipped and Idli not dipped in sambhar but he told either he will serve both dipped or both plain. He simply refused to serve as our requirement. This was not expected from such an old and reputed restaurant. We simply walked off from the place but no other staff members even bother of this misbehavior of his colleague. Very disappointed.

Located just outside the "Chandnichowk metro station" gate, opposite to Hindustan Building of "Life Insurance Corporation of India", this place is perhaps the legend in serving the best south Indian food in the city.
The amazing decor, the mesmerizing ambience, the heavenly food and the hospitality of the service staffs are something that will fill your each and every visit to this place with utter delight.
Specially the idly served at this place deserves a standing ovation. Its as soft as cotton, spongy in texture and just melts in your mouth.
So even if you don't like south Indian food, your perception is sure to change from the very first visit at this place. And if south Indian cuisine is something that makes your day, this place is a pure bliss for you.
A 5 rating any day.

Located opposite E Mall,probably the best veg restaurant in Kolkata. A paradise for vegans. It serves a variety of veg dishes from dosas to paw bhajis to chola bhaturas.
For me the best served dish here would be their dahi-vada. The best in the city by a mile. The quality and taste of the dahii they use is brilliant. The chola bhaturas and paw bhaji are also at par. 
The other dish which I personally prefer is the mixed veg uttapam. Its preety good. Service time is good and has a peaceful ambience.

This restaurant is just a few steps away from Chandni chowk metro station. We visited there for our lunch for the first time. The restaurant has a great seating arrangement on it's first floor area. When we visited there, all the tables were occupied and thus we had to wait for few minutes to get one. We ordered their idly and tomato cheese pizza. Though I am not too much fond of veg food but my experience here was good. Tomato cheese pizza was really good. Moreover, this restaurant is clean and well maintained and can be visited with the family too.

Anand is a vegetarian restaurant, located just opposite to e-mall and nearest to Ganesh chandra avenue.This is a paradise for vegetarian peoples but instead of being a non veg person I visited this place with one of my friend. They have a huge upper dine in segment with dark ambiance. Foods were good, but I would definitely say that it is time to renovate this restaurant because they are now still using years old stainless steel utensils instead of modern plates. We ordered Badam milk shake,Rose milk shake,Pav bhaji and Butter sada dosa. Milk shakes were good and I loved the taste of the pav bhaji.Overall good experience .

Terrible food... Sambar was simply water and tasteless even the chutney ... Mineral water served opened! Probably the bottle was refilled with tap water and served as mineral water... When pointed out the waiter first argued and then replaced with a new one.
When asked for Pao Bhaji, instead on Pao...they served burger buns.
While complaining to the manager, he said we run this restaurant in this manner only!
I seriously recommend everyone not to go to this restaurant anymore!

We just happened to stop nearby when we were searching for a good vegetarian restaurant and Zomato reviews helped our way in, perhaps the few occasions when things happen vice versa. We ordered different kinds of dosas,idlis and vada. I never expected something like this to be served especially when you are not in the same region as the cuisine is. Food was delicious, service was awesome, ambience was normal and all in a very decent price! In short delighted to be here!

Its no more that restra which I used to go earlier... Quality has deteriorated like terribly.. Earlier it had no comparison to it.. Washroom is totally unhygienic and smudgey.. Service is good but food is totally unsatisfactory
Ordered Idli which was like soso.. Nothing great like it used to b before.. Didn't find it that soft anymore.. Moisture content was missing
Then in dosai.. Orderd onion masala dosai which was even not that good to me...
Rava masala dosai was way better
Even tried farm house pizza which looked really tasty but wasn't pizza at all.. They just took pizza bread and stuffed it with vegetables without adding salt pepper or sauce.. Cheese on top was fine but rest was just not good...
The only item which would actually compel me to go there is Upma ... It was perfect.. It had all Quality taste moisture ...
But I was really not happy with the food... I was v eager as I had made a visit after years and had really high expectations but I was let down this time...

The waiters behave as if they have known you since ages, making you feel at ease. The location also nice. Many years ago I had mango kulfi and grape kulfi there. Those were something I never tasted anywhere else, so good to taste. Hope to go there sometime in summer and try them once again.

This place is South Indian lover delight. Loaded with varieties of stuff they provide quality products and services. Plus the restra is budgetory and doesnot cause a dent in your wallet even if 20 of you visits this place.
One of the oldest and the best restra in town. Plus they have started serving some dishes like Paw Bhaji , Chola Bhatura which is even quite good. But the south Indian here has no match. Just loved it.

I have been to this joint a couple of times.

I have to say there is something about this place which makes me want to visit it again.

May be its the happening hullabaloo of people around or the perfect location of this place.

I have had Rawa Masala dosa here on both the visits and the food is far better than almost any other south indian eatery.

What it lacks in ambiance and decoration ,it more than makes up for in food quality and taste.

The Dahi vada is a constant favorite and crunchy as well as soft which makes it a to die for recipe.

I have the mitha pan everytime i visit this place and is somewhat soothing to the mouth and good to have for fun.

I do not have to ask anyone to visit this as there are more than enough people inside it at any point in time (just kidding).

All in all ,it has my money to be one of the best in Kolkata for South Indian Delight.

In roasted idly the oil was too much and it tastes like nothing, for munching the chutney was like water... Disappointing

The butter gee masala dosa was fried too much which is very crispy and gee is added access of course munching chutney and sambar was tasteless!!! 

Finally done with curd rice which was a little better!!! 

Ambiance was good and the decor and furniture feels good!!

This restaurant has stood the test of time....in fact they have stood the test of decades! One interesting aspect that you will notice is their pricing -- but all their items are very fairly priced. Anand is an old timer, so one may not find the "frills" but it is a quaint place which can be good for family and friends alike.

Even those who aren't great fans of south indian food will most likely find Anand's food tasty. However, you can't order paav bhaaji at Anand and then complain about the taste! That's simply unjust! Ask for typical south indian specialties and you will not be disappointed.

I have been there several times and have never returned dissatisfied. Their sambhar is very delicious and the coconut chutney is not as watery as it is in some of the other restaurants.

Pvt car owners-- prepare for some hardship as finding a place to park your car may turn you off. That's the only downside i can think of about Anand.

#Review 1- 
Three of us had gone there yesterday for a late lunch to calm our hunger pangs at around 4 while returning from college. This place is easier to locate and has a nice ambience. The service is good and fast which was an advantage for our hungry souls. :D
The waiters are courteous and don't hover around the tables and is a plus point. We had ordered a Chola bhatura,masala dosa and a rava dosa with a thumbs up and 2 sweet lime sodas. The dosas were crisp and yummy and the chola bhatura had a magic of its own. The food was enough to satisfy our stomachs and is a really good deal. The bill added up to 360 INR which is really really affordable and nice. And yes,this place does serve one of the best south India food in the city!
Will come here for more!

#Review 2: Been there yesterday with family to satisfy my taste buds after a tiring day of pandal hopping. Anand was buzzing with customers and the hustle bustle of waiters, catering to the orders of the people. Thankfully,we got a table for four immediately and ordered the following - Coriander masala dosa,butter masala dosa, idly and chola bhatura. Each of their dishes were fabulously prepared. The dosas were crisp and delicious to taste. Even the chutney and sambhar are going to leave a mark for you. I lovee my second experience here too. I was thoroughly satisfied. Oh yes,we also ordered a cold coffee,a tutty - fruity and 2 butter scotch ice cream as well. The tutty fruity, which was completely finished off by my mom, was as beautiful to taste as it looked. The bill amounted to 800 INR,which was satisfactory.

I definitely came back for more. Will you?

Have been visiting this place for the past 25 years and reviewing it for the first time!
Situated at Chandni chowk, it is indeed 1 of the most popular restaurants in this place.
Parking is an issue as well as seat availability - given the huge rush of customers. Same is staff service - who are not decent and hygiene - tables and washrooms literally stink. Poor maintenance - even the menus are worn out, uncleaned water and food particles lie on tables. However, decor is good and the couple of aquariums placed in the restaurant provide amusement to children. Ambience is nice.
Have rated this place as 3 only due to food quality and taste. Had veg rava masala dosa which was out of the world. Also, chutney was nice and sambhar boiling tasty. Dosa was crisply fried and red. 
Also, had puri and bhaji - which was mediocre and overused lemon.
Prices are a bit on the higher side, which is ok.
Management could sincerely improve hygiene and hire better staff.
Thanks.

This place at Chandni chowk. Went to chandni for some computer related reason and became damn hungry after hopping from one shop to other. Then came to this place and by the look and feel of it decided to have lunch here. There was a bit of queue. I saw people having south indian food so decided to have the same. The food was delicious. Didnt expext it to be this good. We ordered simple masala dosa idlis and uthapam and all were very good. Later came to know about the popularity of this place later.

A busy lunch ... But amused with deliciousness... Ghee Dosa... Sambar... Chatni... Lassi... N a sweet pan!!! The south Indian style pan literally melted in my mouth!! Chatni is really awesome... Dosa n sambar is good too... More over its quite reasonably pricey than some other contemporary places of the same category... Worth the try... Looking for a group foodfest ;)

I realize Anand comes with a huge legacy but I cannot mince my words. Even after putting aside my bias (positive) for the Karnataka style thick, crispy dosa (Anand does it Tamil style), it was a letdown. The ghee masala dosa was not bad but was far from special. The aloo masala was ok, the dosa could have been crispier. Nothing significant to note by way of chutney/sambar. The vada was not crisp and the cardinal sin, not piping hot. The cold coffee had a strong coffee hit but was too dilute. The prices are bombastic (Rs. 90 for the dosa). For those South Indians looking for a taste of home, I doubt this would satisfy.

Although I am a hardcore non-vegetarian, I do hav a soft corner for veg south indian food and Anand is one of those places which serves me good.
Situated opp E-mall, it has a nice ambience and is spacious enough. It serves one of the best sambhars in Kolkata. Among the dishes my pick are Paper Masala Dosa, Dhania dosa and Fried idly. Service is a bit slow during peak hours.
All in all it good vegetarian destination if u want to hav some delicious south indian fare.

This place is situated very close to my house and have visited this place during my school and collage days. Usually for south Indian we opt for Madras restaurant close to this one coz of the taste and price.

Suddenly we decided to go here after so long years and ended up in a mess by ordering Cheese Masala Dosa, Alu CHop, Upma, Stuffed idly and special Chutney. 
Dosa's stuffing and chutney was so tasteless.
Alu chop was just like any other roadside alu bhaja with tasteless stuffing.
Upma was equally plain and blank.
Annoying part was that the special chutney is the dry version of what you get with dosa and was equally tasteless.
We waited for long for Stuffed idly and then the  waiter informed that it was over.
It's really sad to say that the quality of the food has gone down and taste is so bad. Didn't enjoyed the food at all.  They don't even have card payment option also. Service is hopeless and taste is also not good compared to other South Indian restaurant. Attitude of the waiters are also not good. Was really disappointed with this place.
Now the worst part is that we all ended up having bad stomach which should obviously because of the quality.
So guys, I would highly recommend you to please opt for Madras restaurant near to this pathetic one which serves good quality food and pocket friendly price.

One of the oldest South Indian restaurants in Calcutta, Anand is situated near chandni chowk metro station. Today I visited this place for lunch with a friend of mine after almost 5 to 6 years. It used to be very good when it came to authentic south indian food, so with that thought in mind I stepped in and ordered a Cheese  Rava Masala Dosa , Onion Uttapam for main course and fried Idli Fingers for starters. Well, talking about the starter first, the idli fingers were very good..extremely crispy and nice. The onion uttapam was not up to the mark as the onions you're not fried properly and the Rava dosa was very average, smaller in size as compared to other places and the amount of cheese was very less. All I can say is that, the quality of food has deteriorated over the years, it isnt what it used to be. Won't be visiting anytime soon.

This place is situated near Chandni Chowk metro station and is a very old name in South Indian Foods. Have been there many times earlier but this time came with friends after a gap of 4-5 yrs. 

Interiors and decor are still same what I saw 5 years back. Place is big but they have made it too tight by putting many tables. No place to move freely and seats are also tight. 

Now comes the food part. It's really sad to say that the quality of the food has gone done very much. Didn't enjoyed the food at all. Service is hopeless and taste is also not good compared to other South Indian restaurant. Attitude of the waiters are also not good. Was really disappointed with this place.

Ah! Today I again went to this classic south Indian eatery located just two steps away from the chandni chowk metro station at the heart of kolkata. The place is still the same - filled to the capacity, with a passable ambience. There were many known faces among the waiters who welcomed my and my papa with an encouraging smile. I didn't even check the menu card and just ordered my favourites - butter wafer masala dosa, masala rava dosa, chola batura and for desserts I ordered strawberry streusel and fruit salad with ice cream. Well, the dosas were just mind blowing as always but there was lil or no difference in flavour between the two types of dosas. The filling could have been a lil more bdw. So far as the chola batura is concerned, well I have never seen a south Indian restaurant serving such mouth watering north Indian delicacy. Strawberry streusel was sweet and thick and the ice cream with fruit salad had lots of fruit in it, full on paisa vasool! Over all I enjoyed my lunch today and hence I recommend Anand, as always. Go taste tradition.

Decent decor... busy place .... service was quick and prompt... 
I ordered the ghee wafer masala dosa... which was say... 8/10 ... i've had better... above average... ordered some extra masal and chutney which fell shirt considering the huge dosa...
Fruit salad with ice cream was so so... nothing great...
The filter coffee though was the best... warm... right strength... perfect..

It was a blistering April day and after having just come out of the AC in E-mall, a serious debate rose on where and what to eat: whether we should celebrate our purchase by having a plate of biryani or should we be sensible enough to get something lighter. As both the Celsius and our decibels rose, a small little restaurant from across the street kept on tantalising us, and it wasn’t long before we finally gave in to our rumbling tummies and bolted there.

 Anand had been on our wish list for quite a long time, having read the recommendations in Zomato about the authentic South-Indian fare, as well as the pizzas and shakes that they serve. What greeted us once we entered, took us by surprise. It was more of a polished and well maintained restaurant with extravagant interiors rather than an archetypal canteen serving South Indian food that we expected. The walls were mirrored; giving it an appearance of being bigger than it already was and as we sat down we couldn’t help but marvel at the paper table mats (you’ve got to visit there to find out why!). We wanted to taste at least one dish from both the cuisines they serve, hence, a Butter Masala Dosa and a Farm House Pizza was picked from a huge array of options. 

The dosa was big enough to satiate a hungry person, and I loved the consistent crispiness, slight tanginess of the batter and the distinct buttery flavor. The filling was tasty and so were the sambar and the coconut chutney.  They took some good 25 minutes to prepare the pizza and it was served hot and fresh. Both of us would initially cringe at the thought of a vegetable pizza but this one totally changed our perception. The pizza was LOADED with a LOT of cheese and we both LOVED it (who wouldn’t?!). There were bits of mushrooms, sliced baby corns, golden corns, capsicum, tomatoes and onions. Only if they had served it with some oregano and chili flakes, it would’ve been no less than perfect!

The place is a bit pricey but that is justifiable given their service, food quality and the environment. Would definitely love to go back for their milkshakes as we were too filled to have one last time!

This is very close by to Chandni chowk metro station . its a very popular restaurant since old days.
Well there is not much to say about the ambience. You leave a busy street and enter a busier restaurant. Yeah u will generally find this place crowded and buzzing at lunch hours.
Coming to the main point :-)
The dosa here is very nice. Although the sambhar portion served is very meagre but u can always ask for more. The chutney is watery and doesn't really taste like coconut chutney.. But as I said the dosa is good crispy and yummy..
Pau bhaji served with butter is another one of my favs as these prove to be filling and sometimes extra calories cost u nothing but gives only pleasure ;)
Basically its not that I would go out of the way to visit this place. But if I am in that area this place definitely serves me with filling food reasonably.. (The rates are cheap).
They need to work on the taste of the food but since already its a buzzing place I wouldn't blame them.
P.s.- I love feedbacks:)

Place is quite famous for south Indian and is one of the most lovable food joint for vegetarians. I had cheese masala dosa and masala dosa. Interiors are very good when compared to the pricing of the place. Price is very nominal. When any sudden food craving pops-up and you are near this area ( location - opposite to e-mall) you may give it a visit. Service is quite delayed and inefficient rather crowded place was the reason of delayed service. One of the hygienic places to eat . overall a good places  to eat.

Worst restaurant in history of Kolkata.  I was not allowed to make my 2 1/2 year child have his home made lunch. Because the restaurant did not allow outside food. No restaurant allows it, but for a child that to 2 1/2 yrs everyone allows it. They basically want the parents come without there child. The staff were rude even the one oldie sitting at the cash counter behaved as he has never taken his child out. The oldie must not have married or didn't have any children.  Just one question will the restaurant provided me with the lunch which he has if they cannot then why stop a child having is lunch. SHOCKING....

Their Dosas are recommended, Idli and Vada is also good.
If you want to have best South Indian in Kolkata, this is the place to be !

Great place to eat authentic South-Indian food. 
My favourite would be the Cheese Masala Dosa, it is made to perfection with their Sambhar being the best to my taste buds.
Among the deserts, I have been drooling over their Chocolate Milkshake since my school days & it has not changed a bit.

This place refreshes memories every time I step-in :)

The quality have been so bad these days.
Sambhar without onions
Special chutney so watery
No taste in normal chutney at all..
No any other items available before 12 except south indian.

Would suggest to go at Super Snack Bar or Jyoti vihar if at all u want to enjoy south indian....
Would not recommend any one to go.

For the best South Indian food in Kolkata, there is no better place than Anand. Although you may have to wait a bit to enter, especially on festive occasions, you will get every second's worth when your order is served. From a range of delicious dosas to an array of sumptuous uttapams, you will find everything South Indian here.

Apart from the top quality food, Anand is also quite pocket-friendly. So for all of you who already love South Indian food and also for those who want to fall in love with it, Anand is the perfect destination!

I Ma not a big South Indian Food fan but this place still holds a soft place in my heart. My mother used to work in Statesman then and very often after school i used to join her for lunch and many a times this was the place we used to go for a quick grab. This place is an institution itself being the 1st few South Indian Joints of Kolkata. I was a huge fan of there mixed Uttapam and till now i can vouch for their Rawa Dosas and Idlis. But what i ate as a compulsion was their Butter Ghee Rawa Onion Dosa which was a sheer winner for me. I was huge fan of their Majestic Milk shake and still try them out on impulse.

I am hardcore non-vegetarian. But for Anand, i can go for vegetarian fare also. Best south indian food in Kolkata. The fried idli and the rawa dosa are a must try. And every time I visit, I do make it a point to have a filter coffee since its available at very few places here.

The hallmark of a good restaurant lies in the ingenuinity of its recipes and Anand scores heavily on this. Located near the Statesman building, the restaurant is easy to locate. Once we entered, we were floored by the way the place had been kept clean and the way space has been managed. Good ambiance most of the times completes and complements the food. At first, we ordered pav bhaaji which was very nice. I have eaten a lot of pav bhaaji in different places of Delhi but Anand's stood out for its usage of mild spices and the fresh quality of its pav. 10/10 there. We also had veg cutlets which were very nice made and had the kolkata flavour infused in its every bite. Not everyday one gets to taste delicacies like these! 9/10 for that. We ordered masala dosa then which was okayish and nothing out of the world which was fine given that a dosa need not to be too much  outlandish  in taste. A dosa is afterall, well, a dosa. The service was nice and friendly so no complaints there. 8/10 for that. A big MINUS is that you can only pay cash so ensure to keep some greenery in your pocket before venturing out on this joint. Go for it. It is worth every bit of your time.

Anand is one of the oldest south indian restaurant in kolkata. I remember going there with my parents as a kid over the weekend to savour the great taste of this legendary restaurant. The dosas, idlis, vadas, upma, etc all had a lingering taste in our mouth. I remember always standing in a queue for over an hour most of the time as there were people flocking the place even on weekdays. With the advent of so many new restaurants in the city Anand today faces a tough competition but they have still emerged winners every year in different food related competition.  The authenticity, service and the taste remains the same. Though I feel the interior needs a make over to attract the new generation as they are more keen on flashy decor and hygiene along with good food.

I was planning for really a long time to visit this restaurant. We were out on the Christmas eve in park street and planned to have dinner at Mocambo or Peter cat(my all time fav). But because of the huge rush, we couldn't managed to get in. Then the thought of visiting Anand came into our mind.
Its a 10 mins drive from park street, located in chandni chowk.
Well, before giving the review about the food; let me tell you I'm a big non-veggie. I hardly spend my money on veg foods at restaurant.
But this restaurant changed my whole perception of veg food. It redefined the taste of veg food for me.
Firstly, We ordered for Rava onion masala dosa. It was as crisp as chips and masala was well cooked. Moreover, Chutney and sambhar was too tasty. Then we ordered for paav bhaji and farm house pizza. I must tell you, it was the best paav bhaji I ever had in my life. Words fall short to describe its taste. If you ever visit this resto,this should be on your top of the list.
Now,our stomach are full. So what next we can have. I have had read some reviews before and was eager to eat it. Yeah,its everyone's favorite 'Tuti-Fruity Icecream'.
No wonder why people are crazy here about this dessert. It's the best ice cream I had in Calcutta. It was all full of dry fruits and honey. I could still feel the taste of it.
To talk about the service and ambience, its more than good comparing the things they offer at this price. 
Overall it was a great experience dining there and would like to taste some different dishes some other time. I've already decided my next day to visit it. ;)

Excellent food and great ambience backed by good service. The food is great but being from Chennai i felt the Sambhar just a bit North-Indianish. Moreover I feel that extra chutney and sambar shouldn't be charged. Overall i would say the 2nd best South Indian restaurant in Calcutta after The Banana Leaf in Lake Market.

Coming here since childhood. Awesome south indian food, लाज़वाब विविधताएं, you will get fresh and quality dosas, idlys, uttapams and other south indian food. Dining is comfortable and clean. Management is very active. No complaint regarding servicing. One negative point areawise though, it is very hard to get a cab. You have to wave your arm to stop any public vehicle. Have to go to esplanade to reach your destination without major difficulty. So better get your car but again parking is also a huge problem there. But speciality wise it acquires the supreme speciality in south indian food. A cool  family  restaurant.

A really great place to have South Indian food in Kolkata. Very centrally located and is just a few paces from the Chandni Chowk metro station. The place is a bit cramped and the ambience is most ordinary, but the food is anything but. They have a wide variety of South Indian dishes and when the food comes and you dig in, you will simply forget about the Damn sitting arrangements, the ordinary ambience or the time. It is not a good place to have a conversation because the chit chat stops the moment the food comes. The food here demands respect and you simply have to dig in. The prices are a bit on the higher side,  but who the hell cares!! I stuff myself here pretty regularly. ???????????????? 

Long live Anand!

Heard a lot about this place. Suddenly made a plan & went there with a special one. Well the place is real nice. The decor was very good indeed. Have been there just couple of days ago &  Had a breakfast. We just ordered only a masala onion dosa & idly. Frankly speaking expected the food would be more good as the fame it possesses.  Not saying that food wasn't good but expected a little more better. & compared to the price the quantity was also a little bit low. As because I was really hungry, the quantity appeared to me a little low but that depends upon person to person. My friend who visited there before also told me that they have reduced the quantity of the food. If anybody loves to eat south Indian food he will promptly fall in love with that place but if somebody doesn't love, then its only good for them. But i would suggest to at least visit that place for once to check their taste Bud's frequency.

I am North Indian n my home is in Tamil Nadu. A perfect south Indian restaurant can be judged by tasting the sambar and varities of chutney served along with almost every dish. I had order Mix Veg Utappam topped with cheese. The moment i had the first sip of sambar, it reminded me of  my native. The utappam was crispy n spicy. I devoured every bit of it. The place is small but its ambience is perfect. Must go if u love idly's n dosas

This is a moderately decorated restaurant opposite emall. The food is mainly south indian,with very few north indian vegetarian delights. You would have to literally go through the menu several times before  ordering if you are not very fond of south indian dishes.
But when you finally decide,even the south indian food will surprise you with its flavor :) 
The dosas are one of the best standards i have had in kolkata.you can select from a wise range of dosas,with even ghee or butter or cheese to boost the taste.we had also ordered papri chat,which was quite unique compared to any other place.
Ice cream here deserves special commendation. They serve in two and three scoops with lots of nuts and fruits. The ice cream will simply lift up your mood.
The service is ordinary,though at times they take too long to serve,so order you deserts along with your other orders at the same time.

Anyways I am pleasantly surprised each time I try a new dish here...
The Cheese Rava Masala Dosa, Cheese Uttapam, Ghee Wafer Dosa, Stuffed Idly Fried, Farm house Pizza, Mixed Chaat are some of my favourite dishes here...
Being a meat lover myself, I recommend fellow protein junkies to give this place a try... Just make sure that you have the patience to wait, as this place remains crowded most of the time...

The great food, the swift service and the cheerful banter reverberating across its bustling corridors, with small chairs and tables on either sides, account for the incredible queue you are bound to encounter when you chance upon Anand. The queue albeit is fast-moving for the very same reasons. Once you enter the two-storeyed enterprise, you can see the innumerable servers running to and fro. It has quite a 'diner' feel to it, and a VERY busy one at that.

On our last visit, from a wide variety of vegetarian food, my parents and I chose:

(1) Cheese Sada Dosa: The inside of the large crunchy dosa was generously laden with shredded cheese. It was truly an otherworldly experience.
(2) Wafer Sada Dosa: Honestly, they might as well have called it Just Sada Dosa. I couldn't tell the difference between a plain Sada Dosa and the wafer one. It was perhaps crunchier.
(3) Sada Vada: Suffices to say 'yum yum'. I would have liked it even more if the vadas were a wee bit larger.
(4) Mixed Uttapam: I'm not a fan of uttapam but my father sure made a clean job of it.
(5) Mango Milkshake: It was syrupy and too sweet, and not something I would ever try again.
(6) Chocolate Float Milkshake: It is exactly what it says it is. Chocolate milkshake with a floating dollop of icecream. Yum yum.

Our bill amounted to Rs 590 including taxes and I felt that for the prices they charge, they could serve with better utensils and put some effort in the upkeep of the place. 

p.s. It is not an ideal place for a quiet dinner. You might be asked to share your table with others on particularly busy nights.

We are quite frequent visitors to Kolkata. Being from chennai, we like eating south Indian food for breakfast, and inevitably we end up here each time we are in Kolkata at least for one meal. The food is excellent here. Being exposed to highest standards of south Indian food, I can state that they clearly come in the elite category. They make a special chutney, which I wanna make a special mention for. My personal favourite is their ghee butter roast dosa :-))

First it is near chandi chowk metro and so very convenient to reach there. Secondly, i first went to that place with a frnd of mine and we two had a lunch over there. It is a nice place with good food with nominal rates. I tried a veg burger and  cholle batura. They were really nice. I think the place was good enough and pocket friendly. The thing i didn't like was the way of their service. I just hope they improve it a little and it would be excellent place.

I have been to Anand alot of times as my father's chamber is nearby. And I have stopped by to taste some tasty dhosas there :D Recently I tried the Anand Pizzas as well. Trust me they are wonderful :)

** Ambiance = Its always buzzing with people. The servers are quick, witty and ever smiling :) It is air conditioned.

** Things tried = Masala Dosa - Big size and the masala inside is beautifully prepared. The food is really fresh here.
Onion Uttapam - Makes you crave for more.
Anand Pizza - The cheese toppings and the fresh vegetables are just wow !! You can always opt for extra toppings :P

** Recommendations = Almost all the items are fresh and superb to taste. But special mention goes to the Butter Masala Dosa :)

** Purse Check = Rs. 400-500/- is good enough for 2 people :)

** Overall = They are not just good but they are best in their department and have been consistently doing so for quite sometime now. Rock on !
Cheers :)

After Hearing About this place From Lots of friends , finally decided to visit.

And was blowen away, really...
I am a frequent visiter in chandni chowk and Esplanade , and i always end up eating at KFC ,Karco ..
We always used to pass by this resturant... but never enter it... yesterday me and my friend went and ordered 

Butter Ghee Wafer Masala Dosa and Cheese Wafer Masala Dosa
and 2 sweet Lassi 

it was awesome, the best south indian food i have eaten ever... 
the environment was awesome, quiet , pleasent light , nice place to have a chat while eating a good food...

i would recommend this place highly to people who love south indian food 

Enviroment - 4.6/5.0(not full marks cause it lacks a light music)
Service-4.0/5.0(the plates and bowls are very cheap looking , and when they refill the chutney and sambar they make a mess sometimes)
Food-4.5/5.0(because the white chutly lacked freashness , that is freash curry patta )

A student of mine unwillingly pulled me inside anand.. literally.. firstly vegetarian n secondly south indian. Impossible. I could do it. I hate dosa. So my student ordered for a gujia vada n stuffed idly fried. Oh my my.. It was heaven. Excited, I told her to get an upma. N it was out of the world. The final blow was the fruit salad with ice cream n strawberry streusel. I loved it. If its south indian, it has to be anand.

For a non-vegetarian, It is really difficult to satisfy with veg options. Veg restaurants are options only on days which are celebrated as vegetarian days(yes, the once a week veg day). On one of such days, while walking down Chadni Chowk, my hunger alarm rang and found Anand near my vicinity. Initially, I thought I would try Dosa and get out. But when I entered, I got amazing smell of Chana Bhatura. I tried that out. My friend ordered Pau Bhaji, and it was equally good.On another occasion, I tried out the good old south Indian food. Dosa and Uttapam. I had Cheese Masala Dosa and it tasted really good. The uttapam was also pretty decent.A good pocket friendly place for quick veg snack. Since then, I donot hesitate to buzz in even on non-veg days :)

The only word for the food served here in *awesomest*. The best south Indian food offered in the city, cheaply priced and neat tidy decor. The place is very old and is beung visited by generations. The place serves the unique Onion Pakora which tastes great and is only available here. The fooding experience is great and I visit this place regularly with ny family for the best experience without diggung a large hole in the pocket!

Anand - A perfect south indian solution at Chandni Chowk!
===================================================
Even though Anand restaurant is located at the busiest of road in Chandni Chowk (Located diagonally opposite to E-mall), It attracts a lot of customers, tourists for its famous and quality South Indian dishes. They do as well serve north indian too but i haven't tried that as of now. 

My dad used to tell me about Anand a lot. Almost everyone residing or having offices at chandni must have visited Anand once in a lifetime.
===================================================
Coming to the pros and cons now:-
Pros:-

1) Serves one of the best rava dosas in the city of joy.
2) Service is prompt.
3) Ambience is perfect. 
4) Always crowded but still gets place to sit.
5) Reasonably priced.
6) Can accommodate people easily- decent sitting arrangement.
7) Pure veg south indian eatery.
8) Quality of food is too good with respect to the prices charged. 

Cons:-

1) The ceiling of the restaurant is pretty low a bit making it a little difficult for tall people like us.
===================================================
Food ordered: 

1) Rava Butter Masala Onion Dosa - My favorite. Though high on butter grease.
2) Upma - It is one of my favorite here.
3) Vada - It was too good too. :) Quite crunchy and served as you want it (dipped in sambhar or separately) 
===================================================
Summary:

Food presentation 4/5
Food quality 4.5/5
Food quantity 4.5/5
Hospitality 4.5/5
Taste 4.5/5
Value for money 4.7/5
Ambience 4.8/5
===================================================
Suggestion:
Maintain your consistency.
===================================================
Conclusion:

I would love to visit Anand in the near future. Perhaps comes under one of my Favorite. One more thing which caught me was that they had mentioned in their menu that they charge for "second serving of Sambhar/Chutney". However, they haven't been charging anyone since a long time.  :)

Growing up we would visit Anand almost every Sunday with the family. It's homely and the staff always give you a warm friendly greeting. As soon as you walk in that familiar aroma of South India greets you and you just cant wait to tuck in... i can't recall ever seeing the place empty.
My latest is experience was a pleasant one. The food is still great! I tried the sada vada,  fried idli and dosa. Will have to try to squeeze in another visit to have their channa bhatura. And the absolute best part was when the bill came.... only rs.300 for 3 people... lovely!!! Haven't spent less that Rs 700/- at other restaurants.

Worst customer service experienced in kolkata..a must no if you are going with family.they can very easily tell customers to leave the restuarant because they can't serve at one part of their ugly restuarant.The head waitor told us that they won't be able to give service in the area where 6 people can sit together without telling the reason.He simply did not pay any heed to our presence.Its so insulting.When we asked for the manager,the manager himself said that the manager has gone out.What an idiotic manager.I want to say one thing to the owner if he is reading this review-"If you have so much money that you directly deny to serve your customers then just shutdown the place.There are various other places,where good QUALITY food is served which is very ECONOMIC.Visit others and ask your staff to learn GOOD manners from them."

Location: Chandi Chowk, Right opposite E-Mall. 

This restaurant has been really close to my heart since childhood, reason being the 'n' number of family visits to this place just coz' of my love for South Indian food. :-P 
It's a purely Vegetarian restaurant with a simple yet great ambiance and definitely delicious food! 
Talking about the food... 
..Rava Dosas, Plain Vada, Paper Dosas, Stuffed Idlis, Dhaniya Dosa, Chola Bhatura, Pao Bhaji, Filter Coffee & the list would simply go on! 
In short, it serves amazing food. 

The staff is efficient enough to manage the huge crowd, the service is prompt and the prices are pocket friendly! 

Has always been a great experience. :-) 
-Wish to have the same in the future visits as well.

A recent visit to Anand Restaurant was scheduled with my family as we all love South Indian food..the place has beautiful interiors and offers quick and prompt service..

We had been there for breakfast..I guess the food is freshly prepared at that time..We ordered oil free onion masala rava dosa, idly, sambhar vada, upma and cold coffee with ice cream..all food was hot when served..The dosa was practically oil free and crispy..idly was soft..vada was crispy..sambar tastes too good to resist..upma was tasty too..cold coffee was the icing on the cake..

The photos speak about the taste of the food..sorry, the rava dosa was so appealing that I couldn't wait to click the photo..

Overall the food and service both were good..definitely deserves a visit again..also, the place is correctly rated by zomato for the best South Indian..

The food here is amazing. Period. 
Honestly I'm not a big fan of the South Indian cuisine but while I was in cc for my internship, we discussed about restaurants nearby and everyone praised this place like anything. 

So after my ofc my friend and I planned to grab a bite here. 
I had already read few of the reviews earlier and I remembered karishma's review where she mentioned about the stuffed idlis and I had been very very curious about it. 
So even before stepping in that was so on my list!

The interiors are neat and nice- far much fancier than the usual South Indian joints.

We ordered for a butter masala dosa, onion uttapam and stuffed idli along wth coffee. 
The uttapam here was the best you can have in kolkata. Hands down. 
The stuffed idli was very innovative and tasty but since I didn't really like idli much I would pass. 
The dosa was also really nice big and filling and I couldn't complete it :c
We also ordered the special chutney which was really nice. 

I took back sambhar vada and uttapam for my mom and she loved the vada! Super soft!

The bill came a mere ₹425. I was shocked. I was so paranoid because I had just 600 bucks on me that before ordering I made my friend calculate the amount it'd come to X_X

Looking forward to come here more more MORE often!

It is one of the places you would like to visit on a fine evening with family for decent south Indian food. The ambiance is nice. Ordered a Vegetable rava masala dosa and one babycorn pizza. However it could not make me a fan of their pizza as it was good enough but not really good but the dosa was delicious and cannot complain about it. With good ambiance and food, it was pocket friendly too and you will not complain if asked to visit again. :)

Another favourite place for south indian and other snacks,Anand, is located in chandni chowk(chittarajan area).The place is almost always crowded,but whenver im in this particular area i make it a point to eat there.For south indian i absolutely love their stuffed idli with fillings of dal and spices(must try ).I also like the ghee masala dosa and tomato uttapam.Everything on the south indian menu is amazing. Recently i visited this place with my family and we tried their tikia chola and mixed chaat and both were good. I always have pinapple milk shake with anything i order. 
The staff though a little busy still manage to serve you well. The prices are reasonable. 
This gem is not hidden from anyone,but still if you havent been to this place i would highly recommend it :)

This is the place to go if u have a craving for south indian food.The place is spic and span,with the aquarium adding a special touch to the place's charm.
The waiters are courteous and helpful.The service time is reasonable.They serve in shiny steel cutlery,sticking to the south indian dictum of simplicity.
We ordered onion rava dosa,cheese sada dosa,dahi vada and chhole bature.
The onion rava dosa was good,the cheese dosa was an exhiliarating new experience.I never new cheese worked so well with dosa!The smell itself got us drooling.the dahi vada is another great dish,with the fresh dahi refreshing,the spices working beautifully to create magic.The chhole bature was good and it was a relief for me to finally find someplace which knows how to make good chhole!
We washed down this meal with a cup of filter coffee which was a worthy end for such a delicious array of dishes.Basking in the aroma of the coffee,we happily paid the bill without any grudge regarding the price.
Will definitely go back for more!

Some say that the south indian food here is better than what they serve in most south indian places, for me (and my family) this place has been a one stop destination for our sunday brunch for the last 15 years. Anything you eat here will be good in taste and quality. Must try: idli sambhar, cheese dosa, dhaniya dosa, veg utthapam (first timers might mistake it for a pizza) and the tutti frooti ice cream.

Anand serves some great south indian food and the best part is that our choicr is not limited to southindian cuisine only. But this visit was not as pleasant as it usually is and the reason has nothing to do with the quality of food but the mismanagement of th customers and the poor behaviour of th waiter. Poor service does not make a person wish to revisit a place even though it may be a childhood favourite.

Being in South India for quiet a considerable span, I have grown a soft corner for this partucular cuisine. But this restaurant was a discovery on a busy day, when hunger tossed my mind and Anand stood bang on the opposite foot. 

The ambience or interior decor is typical, yet clean and tidy. The order is served within fifteen minutes as per their commitment. I ordered rava dhosa. Usually in south, rava dhosa is served along with a seperate curry. Here we get the usual sambar and chutney. The quality was good and worth the amount charged. The dahi vada is a delicacy and definitely not to be missed. The milk shakes are so so, not in consistence to the previous dishes. 

No doubt its a anyday visit restaurant for a quick bite of south indian cuisine. The total bill amount ranges around 500 for two, which gives a feel good exit from the restaurant.

I paid another visit to Anand couple of weeks ago while I was in the chandni area. I was already sick of eating at big places and thought of eating a modest south indian lunch and nothing beats Anand!

So, there I was one hot afternoon with J paddling along went and had one of the modest luncheons ever.
The order was simple :

Butter plain dosa
Cheese masala dosa
Filter coffee

Behaviour of the staff is very professional. I could see the staff talking to other customers yet scribbling down my order on the notepad!

Now for the food.
The butter plain dosa was delicious. I absolutely love their coconut chutney but somehow cannot come to terms with the sambhar.
The dosa was crispy and buttery and the smell made me bonkers. Dip the crunchy dosa into the coconut chutney and snap!
Thats magic.

Up next was the best dosa I ever had. The cheese masala dosa. The cheese in the dosa is an entire love affair! I never knew that cheese and dosa could go so well. It was delicious and filling.

Lastly, the filter coffee was strong and refreshing and because it was afternoon , it helped in cutting out the lethargy!


Coming back real soon.
Cheers! :)

For south indian food, Anand is the name.
Yes, you will find people sitting and enjoying uttapam, vada and dosa upstairs. This place is never empty !

I've been to this renowned restaurant many a times. :)
They make really good dosas and vadas.
Dont know about the idlis, because I havent tried them out as of yet. Technically, I dont like idlis :(
The dosas are a pleasure to the tongue with the coconut chutney and the sambar.
Not very oily and sticky, the dosas are just perfect.

Ambience wise , it is quite clean and yes spacious too. I believe the place went for a makeover recently hence this fresh revamped look.
I also tried their strawberry shake once which wasnt bad either. But yes, a recommendation : Strictly, stick to south indian food only. I mean its like, trying dimsums in a bengali restaurant! xD

So, to conclude, I would readily give a nod for this food joint. Its worth every visit and another brownie point for its affordable price. :)

Happy eating guys,
Cheers! :)

I have been planning to visit this place for a long time and managed it only yesterday. And I was amazed.

The first thing that catches your eye is the decor as you enter the restaurant. One word of advice to the management, the staircase should have been a little less steep. Another problem would be that the restaurant has only 4 or 6 seating tables. It would be nice to have some couples' table too. Also they should arrange for somebody who can lead the incoming customers to an empty table so that they don't have to roam around to find one. Apart from that the ambiance is great. Sets your mood for a good old fashioned South Indian food joint as soon as you are seated.

The menu was already on the table when I settled. I ordered an Onion Uttapam (Sadly I went there alone). The service was good. The Uttapam was just been cooked. The Sambar was also hot. Their Chutney is also of special mention. A thick mixture of the Coconut, Curry Leaves and other ingredients, not the watery kind usually found in South Indian joints

The Uttapam was great. Well cooked, nice taste. It is always nice to eat such delicacy after a tiring day

The Sambar was delicious. That little excitement of your taste buds that lingers in your mouth after taking a sip of it-that is what sets it apart from regular daals with lots of vegetables. Not many places you can find such nice Sambar in Kolkata. It had been a long time since I have had such great Sambar, the last time being my trip to Bangalore. But Anand successfully crunched that craving.

And then there is the Chutney. There is a common belief that South Indian chutneys are pretty sour to taste. It is not. Anand serves, by my opinion, the most authentic South Indian chutney in Kolkata. The delicious mixture of sweet, sour and occasional hint of chili is perfected here in Anand.

Sambar and Chutney are the two most important dishes in South Indian cuisine and it was nice to know there is some place in Kolkata where we can find them as perfect as they can be.

After the meal I decided to treat myself to a nice glass of Lassi. It was a great drink too. Sweet and not a hint of salt- just the way a glass of Lassi is meant to be.

It was a great experience. Considering the quality they have to offer, the price was modest and pocket-friendly. 

For any South Indian food lover in Kolkata, I'd recommend Anand without a moments hesitation.

On a trip to central cal yesterday stepped into Anand and was disappointed. with their quality, which  has gone down like anything. the chutney was watery and the sambar was near tasteless and runny. the steel plates were pockmarked due to overuse and needs urgent replacement. However the servers were courteous and smiling which made our day. Still Jyoti Vihar has a lead in terms of quality.

One can visit the place any time he/she wants to. The prices are also reasonable. I recommend this place to all the South Indian food lovers.

it is one of the best southindian restaurants. i frequently hang out at this place for lunch with my friends and till date service quality is unquestionable.the interiors are great. though located on the main street yet Its quiet nd.composed from inside. we generally order fried idli,cheese rava masala dosa,raj kachori,pao bhaji and chola bhatura. Raj kachori is delicious and dosas have always been great. The sambhar is my favourite and its uncomparable to any other restaurant. However chola bhatura are not that great,its not special its just simple like any other restaurant. Pao bhaji is good and delicious. it costed us around 500. the food is worth the price paid. looking forward for other items on the menu.

If you want to dig into one of the best south indian restaurant in town this is the place. Open from morning to night except Wednesdays one can get the best lip smacking dosas and idlis in town. My favourites being rava masala dosa and tutty fruity. I can bet you all that you wont go there only once. A must be place in town and the most crowded place in weekends

Located off the bustling CR Avenue, Anand is, undoubtedly, one of the best restaurants catering to the South Indian palate.  Since I used to be working there I frequented this place quite often and I was always left to be craving for more. 

The interiors are just cozy enough, the waiters are quite friendly.
And its never empty and immaculate considering the footfall it draws.

On various occasions of my visit, I had their Cheese Masala Dosa, Butter Sada Dosa, Onion Rava Dosa and it never disappointed me. I always thought of trying other items on their menu but after glancing through their menu I always came roundabout settling for their delicious dosas. I also had their Fruit Salad with Ice Cream which tasted fresh. 

For me it has always been a pleasurable experience both from the quality of their offering and the price point of view.
The pocket pinch is quite reasonable considering the quality they have to offer.

So to conclude, I would say its a must visit for every food lover and its worth every penny.....

Happy Eating...

This landmark restaurant is an example of consistency and power when it comes to south indian food in the city. I remember my grandfather taking me to this place when I was a child. Till date,the place boasts of excellent food,an old calcutta feel,and a typical nostalgic smell persistent in the air.
The dosas and the idlis are a mastery. The equally tasty paw bhaji and the chole bhature make sure that the menu is extensively varied. The badam ka halwa is irresistible,and the coffee is a strong original flavour.
Years gone,and im sure this place will still be the same landmark right opposite the Chandni Chowk metro station :)
Perfect legacy.

I have been going to be Anand since I was a toddler. It has undergone a few changes overthe years, but it has still kept its USP.
To be not biassed when writing a review about this place is very difficult. But still...

Here is what you should definitely try.
1. Butter paper Masala dosa or cheese Masala dosa, they are crispy and well fried, it has the distinct x factor that makes it very traditional, the masala is not too heavy and not too spicy, together with the sambhar and chutney you have a feast. 
2. Dahi vada, the dahi vada at Anand is sinful. The dahi is perfect and smooth with the pudina chutney and soft vada is is divine. 
3. Fresh lime soda to finish., takes care of everything else. 

Blissfully south Indian. I keep coming back whenever I'm around.

I have been going to this place since childhood. Never knew south Indian food could be so yummy. Sambar and chutney are delicious. Paper dosa is thin, long and crisp. Raaj kachori and dahi wada are exceptionally great. This place is vibrant and filled with that aroma which relaxes your anxiety for food if you go there for the first time. That aroma is to die for. This place has also received awards, one of it is from Burrp.

Anand Restaurant located opposite E-mall in Chandni Chowk area is another gem of a place for south indian food. The place falls in the league of raj, jyoti vihar, madras rest, ramkrishna mission but has the most comfortable and decorated seating arrangement of all. What else makes it different from others is the molgapodi powder available on each table whereas you have to ask for it at other places though the quality of same could be better.

Before you enter the place, you would go crazy with the heavenly fragrance of the south indian preparations. The place is huge and seats comfortable. The decor has been the same for years though they did renovate it a bit few years back which you wouldn't notice. If you go for the dinner, the person still stands with the balloons and toys for kids at the entrance. With anand nothing has changed over the years.

I wouldn't say anand serves the best south indian food in the city, but undoubtedly it is good. You could try their rawa or a fried idli apart from the routine idlis & vadas. Dosas aren't my favorite here and i would recommend an onion rawa dosa instead of any other variety. Special chutney is a must. There are other food options also including pizzas, chaats, chola bhatura, pav bhaji etc. though i would not prefer any of these except for the fried puri n subzi, which is rarely available elsewhere in the city. Fresh fruit juices or a filter coffee alongside is nice. But do not forget a south indian coconut paan in the end.

Anand has it's own charm. But it just lacks that authentic feel of a Ramkrishna mission while sitting in the restaurant. Plus i feel the dosas is not upto the mark at times which needs to change. But in the end what matters is inspite of the few dislikings, i have been here a lot more than a hundred times.

This is probably the one of the best south indian restaurant in kolkata. it has a diversified menu packed with both south and north indian snacks and almost all the south indian dishes from dosas to idly's. but one word of caution that the taste of the south indain dishes is not the same as u would find in the south india. the dish is the same south indian but with a north indian flavour.

Anand is probably the best South Indian restaurant in Kolkata and my connection with it goes way back. As my school was located nearby  at Bowbazar, my friends and I would end up sharing many treats over here. I really don't think you can go wrong with this place.....the various Dosas, Idly-vada, Uttapams, Dahi vada are all moth watering. They even do a good job at making Chole-bature, Pav bhaaji and the likes. Pizzas were added a bit later to the menu. I personally love the simple stuff the best......a Sada Dosa and a Filter Coffee.....and I'm happy ! I remember sharing a sundae with my best friend on her birthday in class 8, visiting with my family on Sunday evenings...So lots of fond memories here !
And the ambience really deserves a special mention....even when its crowded, somehow its still peaceful. The glasswork and wooden paneled walls lend an unparalleled charm to this place.....and ofcourse, the aquariums- one of my favourite things there as a kid ! :)
So, its not just nostalgia speaking when I say that this place definitely deserves a visit. Go there and discover it yourself.....Simplicity at its best !

My friends still thank me for taking them to this restaurant. And I would like to thank my dad for taking me there :) The food is just great. I am a die-heart fan of Non-veg food but I dont mind coming to Anand for Veg.
The best dish that i ever had in Anand is their "Fried Idly with curd". It is the best thing, trust me, you will order one more plate after having. The idli is cut into 4 pieces and deep fried, then they serve the idli with fresh curd which is cold and full of flavor.
You should also try their cheese masala dosas, in fact all the dosas are good. Another thing is their Pav Bhaji.
I tried chhole batura once but i personally didnt like it because the chhole gravy was watery. Maybe it was just that day that they didnt prepare it well.
They also serve very good chaats and pizzas. I like their tutti-frutti ice-cream. 

Warning: Try not to go during weekends, it is usually packed and you will have to wait for a long time to get a seat.

Bon appetit!

Great food, great price, great ambiance.. I really don't know what more would you want from a Vegetarian restaurant. Even though they have decent capacity, this place is almost always full.. Their spread is good enough, ranging from Masala Dosa to Veg Pizza to Lassis.. 
My pick would definitely be Chhole bature and the dosas.. Their baturas are soft like anything, and the chhole tastes great.. But their onion rawa dosa would be the one that blew my mind.. It was so good, that I make it a point to order it every time I visit this place, no matter what else We've ordered.. 
And not mentioning their service would be criminal.. With so much number of people coming in all the time, they are surprisingly quick in their service.. And the waiters are extremely polite.. So much that when they see We've ordered one Chhole Bature and one Rawa Dosa, they make it a point to serve one extra katora of chhole, rasam and sambhar! Now that's hospitality..
So no wonder this place is so popular, and it can only grow over time.. A big thumbs up!

Anand is one of the oldest and most popular restaurants for south Indian in kolkata. I have fond memories of the place since childhood as it was THE venue for all celebrations be it birthdays, anniversaries, promotions. The fish aquariums were my favourite place in the entire restaurant and we would always vie to sit in the tables near it whenever we could.  And when i grew older it was the place to go when we bunked tuition. Tasty food at affordable prices and decent ambiance.. it ticks off on all the right boxes of being a good restaurant. My favourite items are onion utthapam and cheese butter rava masala dosa which are heavenly. You dont get better coconut chutney any where else, it is so good. It also serves good chole bhature and pav bhaji. With such goodwill, it is bound to be extremely popular, proof being the long lines outside it on Sundays when waiting time can literally run into hours. Just go there with your family the next time you crave for South Indian or just do a takeaway. You will not be disappointed.

Anand have been serving one of the best South Indian dishes in town for decades now. It is located on the main road of CR Avenue. I have been frequent to this place in the past 3 years. Apart from South Indian food, they also serve decent North Indian food like Pav Bhaji, Chhole Bhature etc.

Food: Anand serves one of the best dosas in town. Cheese Masala Dosa, Paper Butter Masala Dosa and Rawa Dosa are my personal favourites. The Sambhar and Chutney accompanied with dosas is also perfect.

Service: Service is quick and staff are polite.

Price: Price is very reasonable.

Ambiance: Ambiance is good with dim lighting and wood paneled walls.

The next time you visit Anand, go with prior reservation as this place is generally crowded.

I have been going to be Anand since I was less than a year old so 33 years now. This is for sure Calcutta's favorite south Indian joint. I can recall from my childhood days for most family celebrations we would land up at Anand. I remember standing in queue and token system to be seated here. 
Nostalgia and happy memories of childhood fill me when I think of Anand. Nevertheless will try to write an unbiased review of the place. 
Here is my pick from the menu:
1. Butter paper Masala dosa or cheese Masala dosa all their dosas are worth a try but these two top my chart. Crispy and we'll roasted, and if u have read my review of the raj, a common factor of south Indian food at Calcutta is that dosas are always crisp and thin an evident tamil touch to the south Indian cuisine at Cal. 
2. Idlis... While the regular Idli is really good here, I would recommend the fried Idli. It does defeat the purpose of Idli being a light and wholesome dish, nevertheless it Is really worthwhile. Idli in the form of finger food. 
3. Veg fried rice : veg fried rice South Indian style with pieces of fried bread and dry fruits with a raita. 
4. Filter coffee or fresh lime soda to finish. 

Blissful south India food, decent ambience and good customer service. 

I would keep going back whenever I am at Calcutta.

I have been visiting this place since last 25 years... The place is located on the main road of CR Avenue.... Whatever being said about this place is less... 

Food: The taste of the food is still the same.. Have not changed in so many... Being a south indian restaurant, they serve north indian food like chole bathure, puri sabzi n pav bhaji but they also have very good taste...

Price: Reasonably price... 

Service: Service is quick and the staff is also good..

Wednesday they are closed.. Dont go on a Sunday since it will be waiting for sometime otherwise one get the tables easily...

This place has been serving up some of the best vegetarian food in the city for decades now.
Their dosa's are super and so is the channa bhatura and pav bhaji both of which I love. I prefer going here in a group so we can order a number of items and share so that I manage to at least taste all my favourite items. If you like halwa do try the badam ka halwa which is yummy and which I much prefer having rather than their ice-creams etc. Wash it all down with their filter coffee and your totally satiated. Not surprisingly this place is always crowded so please be a little patient when it comes to waiting for your table believe me its worth the wait !

Visit this restaurant primarily for its South Indian food and chola bhatura and pizza! Yes you got me right. The pizza was a revelation in itself, while the famous restaurant basks in the glory of its excellent South Indian food... The rates are extremely pocket friendly and the staff is every polite and friendly... However, they should improve their toilet. The dim lighting and the wood paneled walls take you back to your early days. And, it is always better to get a table reserved as it is packed with people!

This is a good place for South Indian food. I didn't say the best, only because I don't really love South Indian food too much. The prices are well in league with the quality and quantity of the food, and the service is fast.

SOUTH INDIAN FOOD AT ITS BEST

People flock to Anand Restaurant in Central Kolkata mostly for its delicious South Indian food. The variety of dosa, uttapam, idly and vada on offer is simply mind boggling. No two items are the same. Try their Onion Uttapam and you will want the recipe from them because you would want to have it every day for breakfast.  If you are not the calories conscious type, order for the Ghee Butter Masala Dosa without looking at the menu. They also make dosa that is wafer thin and you can have them in cheese or butter or ghee. The dosa is crispy and thin and the Coconut Chutney and the Sāmbhar served by them are thick and delicious. You can never run out of these accompaniments because the servers keep on refilling the empty bowls with them. Again the food is served within five to ten minutes and most of the time you have to blow over the morsel because it is piping hot.

For something to drink and to push down your food you should have their Filter Coffee. The smell of the freshly ground beans will definitely transport you to the coffee estates in Kerala. Instead of Coffee or Tea, the good old Lassi or Buttermilk is also available. You can even find milkshakes of varied flavours here. To cheer up your little ones you can never go wrong with their Chocolate Milkshake with floats. For the sweet toothed there is the good old Badam Halwa, ice cream in conventional flavours, sundaes like their famed Banana Split Sundae and Rose Royale Sundae and ice cream sodas . All the items are moderately priced. Since South Indian food is healthy there shouldn't be any qualm about ordering dosas or uttapams cooked with cheese or butter or ghee.

Used to be the joint I would visit a lot during my brief stint in Orient Blackswan (Orient Longman previously), which used to be very close. My order would generally be a ghee wafer masala dosa and a lassi, and it was a very filling meal for under 100/- . The best part would be the service, which was really fast during the office lunch hour. 

One of the things i loved was the filter coffee. I recently visited because I was in the area and wanted filter coffee. Ordered that with a plate of onion uttapam, and the food came in within 5 minutes, piping hot. So fresh and tasty! I was in heaven, and the chutney served was cool, so dipping the uttapam in the cool chutney to cool it slightly before transferring it to my mouth was a natural act. My bill afterwards, with two cups of coffee, was still under 100/- which was great!

If you are in the central region of our city and need some much needed refreshment in a cool place which does not burn a hole in your pocket this place is the one to be in. Located right opposite to E-Mall on Chittaranjan Avenue this restaurant has seen its good days and bad days. It had been shut a long time ago for some problems and reopened with the exact likable quality of food and beverages. A very long time ago in the 1990s when there were no fancy cafes to offer brewed coffee from properly ground beans my mother and I would often end up in this place post school. My mother would quickly come down from her office in the vicinity and while I would enjoy the cheese filled dosas with the perfect coconut chutney and sambhar she would enjoy filtered coffee. It has been 6 years since I have passed out from my school and yet when I dropped in for some refreshment I was pleasantly surprised to find the fresh fruit still being served fresh at a reasonable amount. The first thing you notice when you enter is the hygiene and cleanliness of the restaurant. It is extremely clean and its wooden handle of the staircase shines proudly with that of well maintained polish. The servers are extremely nice and keep on filling your little bowls of sambhar and chutney free of cost. The badam milk has the wonderful taste of saffron. It might not be very thick but is delicious. For some strange reason I have always associated Anand with authentic South Indian food and have always ended up orderign either Dosas, Uththappam or Idlis. As far as the coconut chutney goes it is as authentic as it is down south. The oil used is probably not coconut which is a relief for people not used to its taste because it does have a very strong smell which might be pleasant for some and might not be pleasant for others. The sambhar is also of good quality. I am so glad this restaurant which is part of my life since I was a child is still around and whips up desirable quality food.

Very conveniently located in central calcutta, in the heart of the commercial part of town.

Although this area is filled with restaurants for those seeking to have lunch during lunch break, Anand is a long time favorite for me as it is for many. Pure-veg south Indian restaurant serving up piping hot and fresh food. for the idly to the vada to the dosa its all brilliant. The sambar and the chatni are very nice to. 

Personal favorite Dhania Dosa.

Perfect for takeaways, just ask your office boy to collect it.

went to this place with oodles of hope which unfortunately wasn't lived up to!
i was seriously expecting to have the best dosa after going through all the previous reviews.. 
but it wasn't the best i have had!
i know many would disagree with me . well i cant help but be honest.
only the first bite that i had was really good.
the dosa was extremely crisp..
but gradually with elapsing time the whole thing started to get heavy and i could taste nothing but oil.
the stuffed masala didn't have that south indian flavour to it. it tasted simply like "bangali alur tarkari"
my favourite part of dosa- the coconut chutney was was yet another piece of disappointment.
i couldn't finish the whole dosa not because of its enormous size but because its taste was not captivating enough!
i was too full to try out their other delicacies but i am looking forward to do so and i hope they are good.
overall the ambience is good,prices are cheap and the rest part is okay!

Well, this is the place my mom and dad went on their first date... :P 
I have eaten here through out my childhood and now I am sure I will go to this place till eternity. 
Anand is the kind of place which has been a favourite of people over 3 generations. tThe food here is affordable, tasty and consistent. 

The Rawa Masala Dosa, Dahi Wada and Chholey Bhatoore are mind blowing. 
The range of fresh juices and filter coffee is great too. Do not forget to ask for the south Indian paan. 

The place has a beautiful aroma, with a brass lamp lit in the stairs, a signature of this place. 

Anand is not just a restaurant  its tradition.

in the hustle bustle of cr avenue and chandani chowk.. lies this ages old south indian and chaat hub of kolkata.. a delight to visit ! and The menu is standard Udupi restaurant fare, with several permutations and combinations of the items Dosa, Ghee, Cheese, Masala, Rava, Plain and so on. The Dosas are just right, and you could easily gobble up a few. And you would struggle to find a fault with the chutney and sambhar there

worth a try and must try!

This centrally located vegetarian south Indian place makes a good option for people staying in central and north Kolkata, since there aren't many breakfast places in the region. 

However, I do not agree with the over-hyped claim by many - "The best South Indian joint in Kolkata". The food is good but not that extraordinary to categorize it with the word "best" in the city. I agree, the service is pretty prompt and the quality is unarguable, with a wide range of varieties, but taste of the dosa's lack authenticity. Fortunately, I can credibly question about its taste due to my years of stay in South India.

The taste & cuisines here is a mix of different flavors from down south states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, etc and fairly satisfies your quench of a heartiest south Indian flavor, being in Kolkata. 

Overall, an average experience but I am sure people will find better options in South Kolkata.

excellent food at very affordable prices..vadas,idlis,dosas.chaats anything that i have tasted on the menu is delicious..and having tried dahi vadas (or dahi bhallas), i can assuredly recommend anand's to be the best.The service is pretty prompt.Another plus point about the place is the filter coffee.

Its one of the best options for a breakfast early morning. Being centrally located, Anand offers a variety of south indian dishes mostly among other cuisines. Prices have not increased exponentially like others around it and the service is still awesome. Sitting beside the Glass windows and watching the world zooming away while you bite onto the Rava Dhosa or Idly and sipping onto milk shake is a pleasure that only some blessed people would understand who have been there. The service is upto the mark and the food quality hasn't deteriorated over the years. All in all, a good place for breakfast with family or friends.

I use to go here with my parents after watching movie in dharamtalla. But this place was same then also as it is today. Same taste and friendly staff!

Probably my most visited place for Sunday brunch as a kid! People still have to stand in the queue if you don't have reservations. 
The aquariums there are a major attraction and good time pass for kids,was for me at least, we used it call it the 'fish-wala' restaurant. 
Good place for breakfast, spans many cuisines. From south-indian, north-indian to chinese, except for the oh-so-fancy things, Anand has it all. The Rava Masala Dosa there is a must have, so is the Pav Bhaji. Service is quick and prices quite reasonable. 
All in all, centrally located, its a good option since there aren't many breakfast places in Calcutta.
