Great hospitality and amazing food. it has been a wonderful stay at the saphire suite . The room was clean and the House Keeping was extremely prompt. The check in and check out process was very smooth. It was delighting to meet General Manager Mr.Ravi Sharma. Would surely visit soon.

Complimentary Breakfast following 1 day stay in the hotel. Considering the price of everything, overall there was nothing to cherish. Food was ok and without any proper spread, which one might expect from such type of restaurants

Supposedly a night life club. But did not like the ambience. Crowded seatings. Food was not good. Decent pricing. But would not like to go there again.

The place is NOT open 24 hours as suggested here! Went to this place in the excitingly shady New Market area around 1am only to be disappointed!
