Long time ago the resto wasn't that bad. It served good food with good quantity. But recently the resto dropped down.The food is average....

Tasty has been standing tall for any years now. It's plentiful food on a budget . Don't expect fancy and you won't be disappointed. Chinese Hakka noodles is pretty good actually.

It's a  small joint in a road off Southern Avenue. There is nothing much to speak of by way of ambience. There is a small room with a number of plastic chairs and tables. But most would prefer to sit outside where some tables and chairs have been placed under big garden umbrellas. Or better still just opt for takeaway. One can have rolls here or noodles( chow) all okayish.But what puts me off are the staff lounging around and gossiping.( Spoils the ambience further) This makes you feel awkward and not want to go back there!!

Ordered food from here after a long, long time. Seemed to me as if I was on a time machine, back to my childhood days. There was a time when we used to travel daily via that route and used to pick up stuff regularly from here. I have always liked the stuff available here from cutlets to chops to fish orleys. This time around we ordered Chicken Cutlet, Fish Kabiraji, Chicken Noodles (Gravy) and Chicken Hakka Noodles, Lemon Chicken and Manchurian Chicken.
Well the taste of the Kabiraji and the Cutlet was almost there (as in the good old days), but the noodles were lacking a bit on the traditional 'Tasty' taste. The lemon chicken and Manchurian Chicken on the other hand were very good. Renewing my romance with Tasty didn't turn out to be too bad in the end, I suppose.

Very old place.Used to be run by an elderly gentleman who smoked a lot.I think ownership has changed hands.This place had the attraction of pavement seating with beach umbrellas which are still there but the charm is somehow lost.

Early nineties this place made a name with their Cutlets and Chops.I had the chicken cutlet and the fish chop both of which had nothing in common with the taste I remember.

This has become another Indo Chinese joint with a serious identity crisis.Sad,considering the substantial fan following the erstwhile owner commanded.

Small roadside outlet, very good for evening snacks. Went there for the first time in 1999. Went there recently in 2012. It's still the same. Like it.

May not be the best resturant of its genre but still a good one. This small resturant has both outdoor seating and air-conditioned seating facility. The name justifies itself as soon u will take a bite of their food. The quantity of the food is good .. One plate is good enough for two. The price is quite cheap. So its very pocket friendly.

This small outlet is near the nava nalanda branch on southern avenue and near the bijoligrill outlet near lake market. The place has outdoor seats as well as airconditioned seating arrangement. We went there today and ordered a veg hakka noodles and half plate of chicken manchurian. We were served the food within 15 minutes and the quantity was adequate. The chicken manchurian was not what i call a chicken manchurian but it did not taste bad. The noodles were good and the quantity was good for two people. Half plate of the chicken manchurian had four pieces which were ok. The bill came to 165 rupees which was pretty cheap. I would recommend this place if you are low on budget or just want an affordabkr place to eat . They also provide home delivery nearby.
