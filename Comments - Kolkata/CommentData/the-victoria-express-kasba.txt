Won't visited the place so can't make comment on the ambience. Ordered online from here . Food quality is not too good but quantity is sufficient. Comparatively the starter preparation are good. Preparation are spicy enough. Pocketfriendly one.

well!! I would like to start by saying that we should never judge a book by its cover. The same saying goes with this place. Its a small and tacky place but the food experience was good. I was just strolling by acropolis to ruby bus stand when i had look at this place.. after considering a little i stopped to have a snack. The prices looked reasonable and the place smelt good. The staff and cook were clean but the surrounding is a bit in question. But coming to the food, it was good. I ordered veg. fried rice and veg. manchurian combo for just 100 bucks which were delicious and the quantity of food although being a combo was fulfilling ,and then i had the crispy chilly babycorn for takeaway which was also tasty although it was cold till i got back home. So overall a nice place. The owner and the staff were very hospitable and i could also see a lot of swiggy delivery guys waiting for their orders to get ready. Must have a lot of followers there, this resto.

Worst restaurant ever, you can see the food which is delivered.
How can you run a restaurant with this kind of service. 
Go and tell your chef to learn cooking first then open a restaurant

This place showed up recently on my zomato (price per person was just Rs. 150 and I was snack-hungry!) Ordered chicken drumsticks and well, they tasted great!!! Size, price was amazing!!!! You should try this joint!

Recent a new food joint has come up beside Balaram Mullick near GST bhawan. Been there two times. First time the experience was very good. The biriyani that I ordered came in a large size container stuffed with egg , 1 piece chicken & the boiled potato which is more than enough for 1 person. Impressed I tried to place order for thali in the weekends but they said nothing is available. I paid a second visit yesterday & the experience was horrible. This time biriyani came without the egg & the container was half filled. The chicken kasha was too spicy without any taste as such. And they charged an extra Rs. 10/- for packaging which they haven't charged the 1st time & they were very impolite. Not recommended even for try outs.
