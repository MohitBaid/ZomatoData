Located just beside Malancha Cinema  in tollygunj. Ordered veg fried rice and veg Hakka Noodles but both were average. Observed their open kitchen as they were using very low grade raw materials like local made sauces and all. Small sitting arrangement for only 12-14 people.

A very very unhealthy & unhygienic cookwares & kitchen space used for cooking all food items. Food quality is below average, very spicy, oily & very very unhygienic. Moghlai Paratha & pakora was the best seller of this fast food joint but at present this 2 food items also lost it's taste & quality. Most importantly very very unprofessional & rude behavior provided as service to many customers. There is no fixed cook/ chef. All the staffs there can cook even the owner can cook himself!!! That's the main reason for below average food quality.

I am staying in Malancha area for more than twenty years now and needless to say, I have tasted more or less all the eateries in this area, big ir small. I used to be quite regular here at Subal's, located just next to Malancha cinema hall, with my friends for a quick evening bite of rolls or chicken pakoras. The owner is always smiling, maybe, he has known me over time. The space is small and the food okay. Not bad for roll, pakoras or evening snacks.

An easy to locate fast food joint . Serves nice food. Chow and fried rice are super tasty. The paneer was a bit sticky but ok.. crispy chilli baby corn is also okayish

The rolls are okay along with the muglai paratha. However most of the items are of very average quality. None of the food is healthy. Price is cheap and so is the service quality.

It is one of the oldest fast food joint in the area... remains crowded always... though the place is very unhygienic... uncleaned sticky tables... but still they are getting a good footfall every day... I tried their mixed gravy noodles... and undoubtedly it tasted very good... pocket pinch here is very friendly...

Cheap rates, ambiance isn't that good. I won't say I hate the food here, but I won't say I love it. It's pretty average, maybe slightly below average. But I won't complain just because they aren't charging a lot of money. You get what you pay for, that's it.
