This sweet confectionary is located near Girish Park Metro Station and sells a variety of sweets and a few snacks.

Shop is clean and well managed.

Tried Misti Doi and Malai Chamcham. Doi was decent but chamcham was average, nothing to rave about.

Price is economical.

Bengoli sweets and snacks shop near girish park. Small outlet and friendly staff. Taste of sweets and snacks were good. I prefer their chhena sweets.

the curd or the mishti doi of mahamaya is too good. so i always see to it that i don't miss it whenever i visit the city. the sweetness, the flavor is just adequate to caress my senses

This is a sweet shop located near girish park opposite bandana chaat centre. Though located at a mere 10 mins walking distance from Nakur chandra and girish Chandra sweet shop, this place gets a good footfall. In my couple of experiences at this outlet I did not quite get the desired variety in sandesh but I must add that whatever I tried was fresh which  they themselves emphasized as well. 

The gulab sandesh, chamcham were nice. Mishti doi was pretty good too. They serve bengali variety of samosas in the evening which was nice and best of what all I have tried from here. Overall an average local sweet shop.
