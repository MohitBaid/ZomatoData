This is a modified roadside fast-food centre.. The prices are quite at par with the fast food centres, and in that cheap price you get the luxury of an AC and also peaceful seating area.. I'm not talking about any private cabin.. Also there're more options in the menu.. So, although it doesn't as such qualify for a 4rating, considering the standard of food and ambience, but what you get here is worth the money you spend, and no stomach problem with the quality of food also.

Why there's no option for "0" , restaurant, chicken reshmi butter masala nd chicken varta have same gravy. Highly disgusting quality. Last of all, if you willing to visit this place for cheap pricing, then plz dont because the prices are too high now, they didnt change the recent in zomato

This place is not famous for food, it's known for the private cabins where couples can spend some intimate time together. I have visited this place last maybe 7 years back. There was a waitor named Sachin who takes care of the private cabin sections. No food is worth special mention, but the mix chowmin with chilli chicken or chilli fish used to be the regular dishes that we used to have over there. And now while writing this review, I can still visualise how the egg omlete was smashed in a sqaure shaped and garnished all over the chowmin.
They probably don't accept card, so if you are reading this and feeling an adrenaline rush in and out your pituitary to drop in there with your special person, make sure to carry cash with you.
The place definitely don't deserve a "4" rating in terms of anything - but I am putting it just because of the nice and lovely memories we have spent there in those days.

Wasn't expecting prime quality food when we ordered in from this place. To be blatantly fair, the food was ordinary and I didn't feel that their pricing justified their food quality, which is saying a lot because they are incredibly cheap!

Rumali Roti and Sweet and Sour Chicken usually makes for a decent meal -- decently heavy and you can't complain about the taste. However, the Chicken we ordered turned out to be excessively sweet. The amount of Chicken they cooked up was good though, but churning out large quantities of food is never good enough to substitute for quality.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Visited this place. Quite a dark and congested place. Quality of the food not too good. Ordered veg rice, rice quality was not good. Service is fine. Ambiance is quite dull. Price is low.

Gave it a try as an experiment and maybe that didn't turn out all that well but not depressing at the same time.
Ordered a chicken roll and chicken kassa. Roll was bit too oily and same with kassa as well. But it was expected seeing the rates of the items. Less than 100 bucks is more than sufficient for one person and you cannot expect a royal treat at that price.
It is located mid of gallery of shops at 209 B T road in one small room with 3 tables. 
There was no specific ambiance or service to rate for which is again expected.
If looking for cheap food, it can be one of the options.
