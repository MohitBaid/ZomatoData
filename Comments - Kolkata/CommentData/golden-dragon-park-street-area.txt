If one needs a pocket friendly dining, this is one of the many I would suggest for! Quantity and quality of food served here is satisfactory. I would say, it's more a student's fave! A after - class meal with buddies will be perfect here. Give it a try. ‚ò∫

A budget Chinese restaurant among all the other finer places in Park Street. If you are looking for satisfactory Chinese food without caring much about the ambience, this is the place to go. We ordered Veg Fried rice with Chilly Fish. The quantity was just about right for two people, not more nor less.

Really enjoyed the food at Golden Dragon. I never visited this place, judging it by its outer appearance. Thought it to be a bar. Well, my opinion changed on 26th Of December when we visited this restaurant finding it the only restaurant which did not have a long queue waiting at its door.
The food is really good. Especially The Meifoon, ie. Rice noodles. I loved it. Do try it if you visit the place. The Hunan chicken and Manchurian chicken were also delicious. Hunan being better than Manchurian. Here they serve on PLATE BASIS. There is no specific number of pieces of meat. Its either shredded meat or small cubes. Quantity is enough. The fried rice wasnt as good as the other dishes but not bad either. 
Place is affordable. Food for 3 people costed Rs. 740 with GST. 
But do not expect a classy ambience like the other restaurants at Park street. If that isnt a problem for you then you are good to go!
Enjoy!

Located just opp to Mocambo and next to subway.. sitting area with dimmed light is  nicely done.. we had kung pao chicken (dry) and fish in hot garlic sauce (dry) . Both the starters were spicy and delicious. Then ordered for their special fried rice, chicken hakka noodles and chicken peiking. Fried rice was upto the mark and didn't want  a side dish. Chicken hakka noodles were good too. chicken peiking was tasty but excessive oily. They serve a greater quantity in main course dishes compared to starters. Pricing and servicing are okay. Overall a decent place .. food quality is good but nothing exceptional.

Went to Golden Dragon with a group of 15 friends on Christmas Eve. For our table we had ordered for Chicken Chowmein and Schezwan Chicken. Both of them were nice. The side dish had around 10-12 pieces of chicken but they were very small at the same time. Budget restaurant. Prices on the menu are inclusive of taxes. The interior is quite spacious! Service is on the slower side.

This is a small eatery located in Park Street and is a great place to get cheap Chinese food which does not hurt the pocket. I recently packed a mixed chow and some garlic chicken and was pleasantly surprised. The chow had a lot of chicken + prawn and tasted great and the garlic chicken was also solid.

All in all, although this place is not as glamorous as some of the other fascinations nearby I would still prefer it over a few of them due to the value for money offered and the consistent food.

The oldest  chinese restaurant which is located beside Nexa showroom and Subway. Compared to so many restaurants situated nearby, this place is small and not highly decorated but still this is a very popular restaurant for regulars. The place gives a homely charm which is a very important part of this restaurant. 
The menu contains all the welknown chinese items. We ordered mixed cjowmien gravy and mixed chowmien dry and sweet and sour pork. All the items were very well cooked and was delicious . The price was reasonable and service was good too.
This is a perfect place for casual or daily dinner with friends or family, cozy and relaxing.

This restaurant has cost effective prices but it fails to maintain the quality of food in festive season.. it certainly failed to provide tastes which one desired from a Chinese cuisine restaurant. They almost served the side dishes first than the main rice or noodles. Service is really poor. I will recommend to try only the noodles and not thw fried rice. We went to eat pork mainly so try the white gravy mushrooms Nd pork (less spicy) and chilly roast pork(spicy dark sauce)

Today is 24 th of december . Peak time . Parkstreet is  witnessing the crowd . Everyone is wearing santa cap . Everyone is enjoying . The hardest thing is to get a restaurant on that ocession in this area. The queue is everywhere.
Then we have gone there and there was no queue.
The cause may be the restaurant is less popular and cheap.
We five had no options , went into it. Got seats. 
The chinese guy was very polite over there. 
We were hungry , so that we gave random orders.
In starter we took chicken spring , dry chili chicken .
In mains we took chicken fried rice , chicken hakka noddles , kung pao chicken , hunan chicken .
We are satisfied . Quickly served
Bill was 1400/-

Located opposite to Mocambo, this place offers delicious chinese food at incredible low price.Figured out his place during my college days over the years the quality of food has improved big time.Being a big time pork consumer, this place offers an mouth watering pork starter-spicy chilly pork,which is a must try.

P.S- if you are lucky enough,you might bump into the 1 year old Aaron, the owner of this food joint and an adorable host.

Golden dragon: Nice place. Nice ambiance. I always felt i have come someone's home that cozy feeling you may get from here. First time I have ordered chicken fried rice and chilly chicken the taste was good had an typical Chinese smell and today ordered chicken fried rice and Peiking chicken and it tasted so good had a strong flavour garlic a bit spicy but undoubtedly delicious. If you want to have good Chinese but don't want to spend more so golden dragon is waiting for you.

A small place on Park Street serving chinese delicacies. I visited with my friend . Ambience is not extravagant but the Chinese traditionalistic interior and presence of Chinese customer made me feel real good. Staffs are average. We ordered special mixed gravy noodles and chilly pork. Pork was little towards harder side but managable.Food quality is good though not exceptional. But at this price point it's OK. Overall peaceful  and value for money place. If you want to experience China,  please visit.

The place is a link between the antique and the present day. The huge mirror on both the sides just make the view a bit more pleasant.
The place is very well lit , neither to much nor too less its just perfect.

The food is delicious and recommendable.
A good place to bring your family and friend for a supper.

Chinese place near Park Street

Ambience: Located in the line of Tung Fong, Mocambo and Koshe Kosha, this place looks a bit shabby in comparison to them. However, once you enter the restaurant, the shabbiness disappears. The interior is decorated with dragon head lampsheds, false Vines, Chinese blinking lights and Chinese paintings. The space is not much big though. 

Food: We ordered noodles and Manchurian, the staple food of any Chinese restaurant. The food that came was pretty much enough for both of us. The quality was also nothing to complain either. However, there is nothing excessively good either. But the food was palatable and didn't disappoint us. The quantity was a big plus though. 

Staffs: They seemed a bit casual though. However, card payment was accepted and parking was available. There is chances of improvement in the staff section.

Tasty Chinese food at affordable rates is a rarity in Park Street area. That's where 'Golden Dragon' comes in. Located opposite to 'Mocambo',this is the only place in Park Street Area where you can have delectable Chinese items at affordable rates. 

We went here for our afternoon lunch after a long walk form Rabindra Sadan to Park Street. Dim lighting inside makes the ambience a mysterious one.The lightning may not be good for food photography but good enough for a date with your lady.

We ordered one 'Chicken Drumaticks' first. The food came within ten minutes and waa served with a complementary sauce. The Chicken Drumsticks were delicious and had little batter in it which added to the taste of the dish.

Next wr ordered one 'Chicken Fried Rice' and one 'Peking Chicken'. The  'Chicken Fried Rice' was delicious and more than enough for two people. The 'Peking Chicken' consisted of shredded chicken in spicy red gravy. It was delicious and went well with the rice. We loved it.

The staff was amiable and well-behaved and we will definitely visit again.

This place is located just beside the subway outlet at the park street crossing....a restaurant at such a prime location would obviously have customers coming in with high expectations.And we were no exceptions.
So today we went with hungry stomachs... ordered
Chicken Drumsticks-This is my favorite starter.And we were served  eight pieces of crispy chicken drumsticks coated with very less but flavour full batter and a bowl of a very spicy and tangy red chutney that reminded me of the chutney they serve at Tung Naam.This starter was a hit.

Chicken Fried Rice-This dish had loads of juicy chunky chicken pieces and eggs with ample amount of veggies.The flavours were bang on.And complemented very well with the side.

Peking Chicken-Shredded chicken in a hot garlicky sauce.Super delicious.And the quantity was just the right amount to be shared by two.

Our bill came to 590.decent enough.
The decor is nothing to talk home about.A little bit more lighting would have been better.The service was promt.Loved the food.

Located at the heart of parkstreet crossing opposite to the then au bon pain .. 
we hopped in for lunch and ordered sweet lime soda pork momos, mixed hakka noodles, chilly pork ,schezwan chicken
Apart from the sweet lime soda 
The food was really good 
The pork pieces were really tender and well cooked, even the noodles was brilliantly tossed up with good mixture of pork chicken and egg 
Over all a great authentic chinese joint if you are looking in for someplace with thinner budget but quality food .
Great experience

We went to this place for the lunch of Choturthi during Pujo. The place was as empty as the share market on a Sunday. We ordered alot of food as there were 16 of us. The pork dishes were good. The others were very ordinary. The staff kept nagging to give all the order at once and showed displeasure when we refused to do so. The food is cheap but it didn't taste anything other than normal. Wanted to try this place and did so. Partially satisfied with my first and last visit.

This eatery is a place to be if you love chinese. It goes quite easy on your pocket. It does not have a great ambience but it is okayish. Staffs are courteous.
The food though was very good. We ordered a plate of mixed fried rice , golden dragon hakka noodles, chilli roasted pork, capsicum pork, chicken drumstick. The bill was just Rs997 and the food was more than sufficient for 4 people.
Looking forward to visiting this place again.Cheers!

You know those chinese joints where they serve lip smacking calcutta-chinese dishes in their sticky, saucy glory and humongous quantity at a super reasonable price? I have a list of about 10 places like that placed all over the city for all time food emergencies and this is one of them! 
This place is all about generous bowls of rice and noodles and succulent pieces of chicken or fish slathered in tangy, sticky sauce. The one thing that i never miss while visiting this place is their roast pork. The meat is nicely tender, juicy and has a good chewy bite to it. The sauce is hot and sweet and sticky with crunchy chunks of peppers and onions. 
If you're in park street and need a chinese fix that goes light on your pocket, this is the place you should come to. Easy to locate, right opposite to Mocambo, the ambience can be a little shady but the food fixes the little issues.

So we met with this joint suddenly on Ashtami night, after being tired to find a place. Its a two floored outlet, with an all men seating in the ground floor and a family on the first floor.We hardly had any waiting time, as there were seats already empty, and it was around 10 pm in the night.This is vintage park street, red lights, old decor, old and loyal staffs who knew what they were serving.The decor is very old school, tables and sofas.We ordered a couple of round of beers and topped it off with a plate of dry chili pork and dry chili chicken. Nothing out of the world, simple plain good tasting food. Compared to what we have in park street, it did not burn a hole either in the pocket. Nevertheless, it was a good start for usNo music, meant we could have a hearty conversation. Service was slow, but its okay with the rush of the pujas.¬†A little vintage old school bar is what you are looking for, this definitely ticks all points

Ambience - Same old, same old. A typical Chinese restaurant, cannot get any more authentic than this. It's run by a Chinese family (including a cute Chinese baby).
Food - Delicious, stick to the classic items as the less familiar ones are not too good. 7/10
Fish items are not too bad.

Been here twice. Once for office party and another with a friend. Its nicely decorated and quite spacious on both floors. The food is very good: Both quality and quantity wise. The prices are  on the modest side compared to its competitors in Park Street area. The service is also not bad. Surely a must visit.

We went their during puja . Though it was crowded during puja their service was prompt . It took only 15 min for them to serve the food. 
We ordered special mei foon (which is basically fine rice noodles), special mixed rice, chicken with hot garlic sauce and schezwan chicken. They provide plenty of fine boneless chicken and the juicy sause was awsome.

We ordered for chilli pepper chicken, chicken gravy noodles, chicken fried rice and szechuan chicken. We had to take soft drinks as lime soda was not available. Also the rice was a little burnt and did not taste good . The service is very disappointing as we had to serve the food ourself and there was no attendant to help. The food was also not upto the mark.

Golden dragon just located opposite Tung Fong is also a great restaurants for the Chinese cuisine. Like many other Chinese restaurant they are also matching it up. I went there last year during puja, though it was puja time yet the place was not so filled up. May be people need to explore more. me and my friend order mixed fried Rice and Singaporean chicken. The food was well specially especially the chicken. It was soft and tender. The Singaporean chicken just gave a nice lift to our taste buds as it was fully made up of spicy juicy gravy, it was a delight to eat such nicely cooked chicken. But coming to the mixed fried rice , I felt the prawns we're not well cooked and was smelling a bit. Otherwise it was a great experience all together. 

The moment you enter the place it will give you a Chinese flavour all together. the interiors is fully decorated and well lit. The service was okay but not prompt enough and it took a bit too long for the food to arrive though there was no other customers other than us. 

Hope they improve their service a bit. Will look forward to visit it again.

Had been to this joint this afternoon. Very easy to locate as It is situated just opposite Mocambo. The decor is quite nice with dim yellow lighting. The staff was very sweet with us as we had to wait. 
We got a place after 5minutes. Coming to the food, we were super hungry and settled for something simple. We ordered Chicken Hot and Sour Soup. The quantity is moderate. We liked it. 
For the main course we ordered, chicken Hakka Noodles. we settled for Kung Pao Chicken as my friend doesn't like much gravy. It is dry but tastes awesome! 
We also had Pepsi and we were super full! And dang! The price! We had all these for ‚Çπ500 only. Lovely experience. I am going there back. Soon! üëçüèΩ

This place in park street offers really good Chinese food in super affordable price. Amidst tung fong and bar b q, there is golden dragon which provides pretty amazing food. I personally didn't like the baby corn that much and the food isn't that spicy but other things are fine. The place is very dim and the interiors aren't that good but you can surely go for the amazing food they serve.

An average restaurant with simple and homely Chinese d√©cor. Their staffs need to be more polished and swift. Read good reviews about the place but their food quality was just average. Expected better taste from their dishes.

The Chilli Baby Corn we ordered was weird. The corn pieces should have been smaller. Then we ordered Mixed Cantonese Noodles which had pork too. If you do not have pork, specify this to them while ordering. We had Schezwan Fried Rice and a chicken dish too. Both of these were not at all upto the mark! If I visit them again ever, I would like to taste their pork dishes.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 600 for two (apprx.)

I still remember the day when I first visited the place. It was after my college admission and since that took a lot of time, it was late and the afternoon and we decided to dine out. I was pretty hungry and the ambience was nice.¬†

The seating was also limited. However I felt it was a little dark inside but that felt fine as it was a hot sunny afternoon. It is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Park Street.

The service is a little laid back but the quality of the food pretty much makes up for the former. Coming to the food we ordered red pepper chicken and ginger chicken which was pretty good. The chicken hakka chowmein and cantonese gravy noodles were decent.
This is one of the fewest places in Park street where you can have quality chinese food without burning a hole in your pocket.

An authentic Chinese restaurant, with a cosy and homely environment, had always kept me connected even after this area had become one of the least visited places in Kolkata. ¬†Service is a little laid-back but I suppose it is the quality of the food which continues to hold onto its customers. I would like to recommend a few mouth-savouring dishes for Chinese and non-Chinese lovers.¬†
1. Mixed Cantonese noodles:¬†¬†The noodles are mildly fried and served with thick gravy with deep fried chicken and prawn pieces. Those who don't prefer pork should mention it to them. I simply love this dish.¬†2. Dry Chilli Pork: ¬†For all those who have pork, this will be a delightful dish.
GOOD LUCK to the team!

Been there on all possible occasions all round the year, this place never fails to impress me with their light-on-the-stomach dishes, which are simple yet tasty...you get spoilt for choices and any thing you choose is wonderful: yes,that's how amazing Golden Dragon is!

This is an ol' timer in the changing landscape of Park Street's food outlets.Its located opposite to Mocambo just beside the Subway. I went out with my college group of 29 people.Yes, 29! That's how massive the college groups are. :P And we landed here in spite of our desire to dine at the legendary Peter Cat. As, you can probably guess this was a pick when we ran out of choices due to such a large group.Our expectations from the place were, thus, not too high to say the least. 
Now, I'll straight head for the food coz there's nothing much to write about the decor. Its as an old Chinese restro should be.Nothing special there. So, we ordered the usual dishes.Again, they didn't have anything new other than the usual Chinese menu to offer. Thus, Hot and Sour Soup and Chicken Meifoon Soup and Golden Prawns came at first. I found the soups quite average. Golden Prawns were nice though, crispy and soft hence well cooked. Dry Chilli Pork were a complete disappointment.They weren't that chewy and on the top of that was freakin' hot.A complete no-no for  a person like me who can't‚Äãendure too much spices.We had their House Special Chicken Meifoon and American Chopsuey for the main course. We also ordered Garlic Chicken as the side dish. They were the usual. So, that was all we had.

Not a bad experience I'd say but average.Considering the fact, we are having dinner at a restro in Park Street, the bill was unbelievably low.And we had our tummies filled.I'd say that's the USP of the place. Pocket Friendly Restaurant in Park Street- that's the list it should get featured on.You can try this place if you're running tight on the budget and need to treat friends or others for a low budget. This place is more like an Auto which you have to board if you can't afford the Uber or Ola at the moment. Happy Dining :)

There are certain places in Kolkata, where you'll still find them in kind of a time-wrap. The service is laid-back but the food is good and extremely value for money. The noodles (especially the gravy chow mien) is generally a lard-affected, but extremely-tasty-when-hot stuff. And, both the golden fried prawn and fried prawn balls are good, though the latter is a bit value for money stuff. Another item I'd seriously suggest is their Dry chilly pork. though slightly less in the hotness quotient, it's still recommended. 

Bon apetite !!!

If you like cockroaches, this is the best place since they have PLENTY of them roaming throughout the restaurant, not just one.
This place should be shut down, I've never seen a more unhygienic restaurant.
I cannot stress enough on the NUMBER of those insects roaming around and they do nothing to clean it.
 I've gotten the same review from a friend who visited this place a few months after I did (and mind you I created a huge scene and left the place without finishing my food when they had the audacity to ask me to pay the bill) and they did NOTHING to eradicate the insects. They're still there. 
Please, NEVER visit this place.

Golden Dragon was visited because of the sole reason that it was supposedly the first place to introduce pork in Park Street.
The restaurant is extremely small, dark and dingy.
We tried a few dishes. The Golden Dragon Special Soup was bland and the Vegetables included in it were bitter.
The Pork Wontons were rather floury and didn't taste great.
This restaurant is just for those who want to go for a Chinese meal without wanting to spend a lot.
The regular chinese dishes like fried rice and the gravy chicken dishes are available at a rather affordable price.

I recommend everyone wanting a nice meal to stay away from it.

If u want to get good Chinese food in park street area with a small budget this is exactly the place you would want to go. Located just opposite of mocambo golden dragon is run by a Chinese fellow and the food has a Chinese touch to it. The d√©cor is pretty good which gives u a feeling that you are in china with all the great lanterns hanging and the walls decorated with Chinese style paintings and decors. The ambience is pretty good as well. Visited this outlet many times and they have never failed to surprise me. Have had their mixed noodles soup, mixed fried rice, mixed noodles, prawns(many dishes) and also a variety of chicken side dishes. All of them tastes very good but if they want to compete with the big guns they have to further improve their quality. But it is the perfect place to have good Chinese food at low budget. Highly recommended if you are nearby

Annoyed with the quality of food as well as their service!! Went here for the 2nd time! Previously it was ok! But the subsequent visit was totally worst! Have to wait for a long time till some one came & took our order! Went with 4of my friends & told to serve us all...but they said "we don't serve the food! U have to serve your own"!! Never seen such rude attitude...will not go there ever!

I have been here a no. of times here with my family, friends and loved ones. It was a good experience. The Golden Dragon Special Meifoon Noodles is just amazing. I tried the Chicken with babycorn and mushrooms as a side dish and it was so delicious. The Chili Roast Pork was very appetizing. The ambience was really good and depicts a glimpse of Chinese culture. After my meal I ended it with  Fresh Lime Soda. Overall it was very good experience. One of the best Chinese restaurants in town. However if they could  improve on the quantity of food served.

There are some places which are never there in your visiting list but you end up visiting by chance or by luck... GOLDEN DRAGON is one such kind which we entered after roaming about in the park street for about an hour in 40¬∞C... We wanted to have chinese and that too sitting in a calm environment under an AC... The other chinese restaurants were above our budget and suddenly we realised we were in front of this place... After instantly going through the reviews and rating we decided to push through the door...

Interiors are cool, calm with the light just adequate to make you feel comfortable... Divided into ground and first floor we opted for the former... We ordered CHICKEN SHRIMP CHOUPSEY and to our delight it was ready in just about 15 minutes... The quantity was huge. and we could not finish our plates...The quality was at par and the noodles were a bit crispy which was a unique experience...
 
The prices were reasonable but I feel its better to inclide the VAT amd service tax instead of adding it up later... 

N.B. - Will be happy to see the addition of dumplings in their menu on my next visit!!!

Its like having a small China Town in park street! Located opposite Mocambo, this place serves cheap and good Chinese food. They have two floors and they open the first floor only if the ground floor is full.
I went there with my school friends, for lunch. Since the ground floor was full, they opened the upper floor for us. We were quite a big group and hence were a bit noisy. The thing is, a baby was sleeping inside the first floor of the restaurant, and so we were told not to make noise. But the baby woke even when we were normally talking. So we spend the rest of having lunch without talking. I think they shouldn't make a child sleep inside the restaurant. What would they have done if it was a busier day? 
Coming to the food, we ordered chicken lollipops and American Chopsuey. Both were good and full of sauce. But we couldn't order more as we wanted to leave the restaurant ASAP so as to prevent anymore harassment to the baby.

Located opposite to mocambo its a small chinese eatery that was once good but it coudnt stand the test of time..
As you enter the place is dimly lit with very humble and crammed seating arrangement..they didnt have the facility for card payment as the machine wasnt working so guys please take cash with you if u ever wish to visit this place (though i would rarely visit it a 2nd time) 
We ordered for:-
1.golden drangon special soup (it was a complete DISASTER very bad presentation..i dont know what kinda leaves they use but they wre sour evn the meat smelled,very less variety of vegetables used mainly compensated with cabbage)
2. Fried pork wontons( it was comparatively better but a bit oily and the filling of minced pork was bland felt like chewing on rubber)
Recommended for budget snacks and very cl√¨che chinese dishes (like fried rice and chilly chicken) as it is more hygienic than the stalls on the opposite footpath.

Sorry guys u really need to improve ur standards to survive in this tough market.

A little piece of our China Town in Park Street! Golden Dragon! A Pure Chinese reataurants owned by some Chinese People! If you are a chinese lover and want to try every chinese restaurants possible in Kolkata, then this one should make your list once! Quite a good place to have some authentic chinese within a reasonable price!

Coming to the Review:
POSITIVITY:
1. Food - They cook some awesome delicious mouth watering foods. With a loads of variations and the typical chinese taste will make your day!
2. Ambience - Ambicence is fantastic with dim light and darkish inside!
3. Service - Service is good! They will serve your order tounge burning hot!
4. Location - Location is perfect for a Restaurant to make customers, Park Street. Under the Park Mansion Building!
5. Staff Behavior - Staff Behavior is good and they will help you to understand the dishes!

NEGITIVITY:
1. Food Quantity - Food Quantity is not what other chinese restaurants will give you, they have a bit lower side food quantity which can make you think before visiting this place twice.
2. Pocket Pinch - When food quantity is not up to the mark and Pocket pinch remains the same like others, it becomes useless and it makes pocket pinch bit a higher side!
3. Service should be more prompt and fast! They took 30 minutes to serve you your dishes, which is really a bit higher waiting time!

Our Order:
Starter -¬†
1. Peiking Chicken - Chicken shredded into very small, thin pieces which is fried and spicey! The quantity of this dish will dissappoint you but not the taste!
Main Course -¬†
1. Golden Dragon Special Meifoon - Thin Noodles or Rice noodles which is Mixed consisting of Prawn, Egg, Chicken, Pork and Many more vegetables. Taste is delicious and the quantity is alot as it is special meifoon.
2. Chilli Roast Pork - Roasted Pork Pieces (6 Pieces) in Chilli. Gravy item goes well with Noodles or Rice! Quantity is good but we thought it will be of 8 pieces.

The total pocket pinch was around 650/- which I think is at higher side in accordance with other chinese restaurants in Kolkata. But if you are a chinese lover, you definitely can go and try their delicious foods! Have a nice meal!

It was one of my friends birthday party n we went there to have chinese dishes.. this is situated at park street, opposite to mocambo..
Food: we have ordered golden dragon spl fried rice, mixed fried rice, golden dragon spcl meinfoon, chi@lli pork and hot garlic chicken.. quantity was average.. all the main dishes were good and really tasty.. but the side dishes could not impress me.. i must say they should pay attention on their side dishes..
Ambience: it was good.. decorated with small lights and peacefull.. but they have arrangements for hardly 20 people..
Service: perfect.. very friendly and their service is really good..
So, overall if you wanna try some good chinese dishes at a low price then you have to come here üòä

Its located just opposite the iconic mocambo restaurant or diagonally opposite to the au bon pain restaurant (music world) park street. We had earlier called them and booked a seat for the 16 of us. We were seated in the first floor. The ambiance of the place is average with dimmed lights. The thing that sucks is the service. The worst I have visited so far. We had to wait for around an half-an-hour for the mixed fried rice we had ordered and then another fifteen minutes for the chicken side dish to appear. By the time the chicken side dish was served the mixed fried rice was ice cold with the rice challenging us to chew it. This poor service can be due to the large number we went but a restaurant should be able to cater to this mount of guest and that too if its located in the party street of the city. Coming to the food quality, it was no extraordinary but in fact below ordinary. The rice in the mixed fried rice was under cooked. The chicken and pork side dish tasted the same though they shouldn't have. It almost appeared to me that they had used the same gravy for both the dishes. The price is fine, but considering the quality of food it could be termed as over priced. The quantity is a bit low. One place rice might just be good for an adult but definitely not enough. On the whole, I am not visiting this place ever in my life again.

Golden Dragon is the place I had heard a lot about. I wouldn't call my first experience here as disappointing, rather, it is pretty good. The place is pretty cheap for the quality and quantity that it offers and especially for being located in Park Street. We had ordered Chilly fish, chicken drumstick, fried rice, Hakka noodles, and red pepper chicken both dry and with gravy. The food was pretty good like I mentioned before. Rather, at such prices, you wouldn't find anything better. 
As far as the ambience is concerned, the place is dull. It is pretty small and crowded. I wish they could do something about that. The service is good. 

I would suggest that this place is good enough for a visit every time you are a little low on the budget or even when you want some satisfactory Chinese food.

This gem of a restaurant was a surprise discovery for me. I truly loved their food. Yummy authentic Chinese and that too extremely pocket friendly. Do order their Chilli Roast Pork (dry). It was the best I had ever had. The pork was tasty and I ordered one for parcel too. I loved their Mixed Fried Rice too. Manchurian Fish and Mixed Hakka Noodles were pretty yummy too. All within 800 bucks. üòÄ Oh and if you visit them on a busy day like New Years or Valentines day.. be prepared to wait for half an hour or more for ur orders to get served. They are a little low on staff members. So, u might have to wait. However, with the pocket friendly prices and the yummy Chinese food, its hard to give this place a miss.
Location: just opposite Mocambo.. beside Subway on Park Street.
Likes: Yummy food, pocket friendly price, good quantity and quality, the decor on the ground floor
Dislikes: glasses were a little dirty, serving is slow on busy days.
Must order: Chilli Pork Dry

The food here is very good and it's the perfect place to hangout with friends because it's pretty cheap and they serve big portions. 
This is my go to place for birthday treats and casual meals with friends. 
The ambiance isn't too impressive but the service is good. 
You should definitely check this place out.

I was charged service tax on my take away bill. And when I asked them that why I was charged so they told that they will charge me if I want the food. Now as per government laws service tax can only be charged on service charge. And as I was not dining I was snot eligible for service charge which made service tax null and void. But when I told them that they were furious and so arrogant that they told me that if I don't pay the service tax I can leave without the food. I love their food bit that does not mean that they are eligible to charge anything .as I m a foodie and a chef as well I will definitely take this issue to higher front and will make them understand that people in this city are not fools who will pay anything on basis of their food.

Golden Dragon is one of the most affordable Chinese Restaurants in the Park Street area. It is small, unassuming and low key. Dimly lit and not very lavishly decorated, this place goes unnoticed by many. 
I have been to this place multiple times in my college days as this is the kind of restaurant a college student can afford to throw her birthday party in. The pocket pinch is considerably low and the food is decent. 
The staff is nice and the service is quick. 
Food is as good as you pay for. My favorite is the Chili Pork. In general, Golden Dragon has some good pork dishes that one can try. The noodles and fried rice are good too.

Golden dragon as the name suggests is an old but not worn out Chinese restaurant in the heart of the most glamorous locality of the city of Kolkata . While Dragon symbolises the restaurant serving oriental cuisine ,maybe the golden denotes its importance in that place . While park street boasts an array of fine dining restaurants , none of them are easy on the pocket. Golden dragon comes as a pocket saving excuse for all the hungry foodies who are eager for a oriental meal but unable to burn their pockets . As for the quality of the meal it will not be the best meal you will ever have the certain dishes are guarantee to make your day.

¬∞ Location :- People who have have been to park Street knows the lane that ultimately goes to Mirza galib street . The starting of the lane boasts restaurants like Mocambo and Tung Fung on the left side of the street and golden dragon is located on the opposite side .

-------------------------------

¬∞ Food :- I have always felt that there are differences in Chinese food served in dim lights and crampy seats than those that are served in fine dining oriental restaurants under bright lights and polished plates . And the difference certainly lies in the overindulgence of spices and that x factor that these dishes have than those of the fine dining ones . We had the following dishes :-

1. Chilly Roast Pork ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- It doesn't get any better than this. You will find almost everyone coming to this restaurant ordering this item . And the reason being the dish is certainly their specialty . You will be served a bowl of sliced pork and pork fat cooked in onion and capsicum . By cooking I mean they pork slices are properly roasted such that they inherit a smoked flavor and an aroma of the onion and capsicum . It's a stunning dish and we loved every spoonful of it. Every pork slice was heavenly . Certainly a dish to saviour .

2. Golden dragon special fried rice ( 4 / 5 ) :- I love fried rice and whenever i am in any oriental restaurant i tend to try their special ones . What's so special of this one ? It's the authentic flavour and aroma of the mixed fried rice that makes this a unique dish . There is ample amount of chicken , egg , pork and prawn  in the rice that will surely satisfy you if you are a pork lover . Once again a recommended dish . The quantity of the rice is more than sufficient for 2 hungry person . The dish being a tad oily is the reason I didn't give full marks .

3. Chicken with garlic sauce ( 3 / 5 ) :- I was really dissapointed with this one . Was asking for a hot garlic chicken which is medium spicy but what we got was certainly not hot and certainly not spicy . The original garlic flavor was missing and the sauce was orangish but bland . The shredded chicken had less cornflower and the quantity is the reason I gave a 3 .
Not really the kind of dish you would like to have with an awesome rice dish . Although the original hot garlic chicken would have been just fine . Not really recommended .

While ordering if they are suggesting a mild spicy dish then the suggestion is to not go for it . Just go for the full spicy items like Szechwan .Certainly they are better than the mild spicy ones .

------------------------------

¬∞ Service & Ambience ( 3 / 5 ) :- When I talk about restaurants with dim lights i am talking about an old world charm that was the kind of deal we used to have when there were not a lot of restaurants around . So that was something that worked for me a lot . What did not work was the sight of the dishes that didn't look that much clean as I was expecting . The tablecloth was another thing that was not the cleanest and same could be said about the glasses . I think if they improve the overall look and feel as well the hygiene of the surroundings then they will attract more attention than what they are currently doing .Other than that it was a good experience . The restaurant is run by a generous Asian guy and the service time is a little over 5 minutes .

¬∞ Verdict :- Absolutely a must visit to those who still have not . Following are the main highlights as to why you should visit this outlet :-

1. Age old Calcutta Chinese , easy on the pocket on an otherwise expensive locality .

2. Stunning chilli roast pork .

3. Dim lights bring the old world charm .

Do visit and if you are pork lover roaming around park Street and this is certainly the place to be .

One of the most beautiful restaurant in the park street area. The beauty of this restaurant is not the appearance it is beacuse of the homely atmosphere i get to see...firstly it is a pure chinese restaurant and serve authentic chinese food. Secondly the resto run by a chinese family. It is a small place but very heartwarming because apart from their delicious food you will get to see a tiny naughty toddler(owner's son)running here and there. He really amazes me...
Now talking about the food. They serve really good quality food with a good quantity. And a very Reasonable price. 
Very good place to have dinner or lunch with family and friends :)

While ordering if they are suggesting a mild spicy dish then the suggestion is to not go for it . Just go for the full spicy items like Szechwan .Certainly they are better than the mild spicy ones .

------------------------------

¬∞ Service & Ambience ( 3 / 5 ) :- When I talk about restaurants with dim lights i am talking about an old world charm that was the kind of deal we used to have when there were not a lot of restaurants around . So that was something that worked for me a lot . What did not work was the sight of the dishes that didn't look that much clean as I was expecting . The tablecloth was another thing that was not the cleanest and same could be said about the glasses . I think if they improve the overall look and feel as well the hygiene of the surroundings then they will attract more attention than what they are currently doing .Other than that it was a good experience . The restaurant is run by a generous Asian guy and the service time is a little over 5 minutes .

¬∞ Verdict :- Absolutely a must visit to those who still have not . Following are the main highlights as to why you should visit this outlet :-

1. Age old Calcutta Chinese , easy on the pocket on an otherwise expensive locality .

2. Stunning chilli roast pork .

3. Dim lights bring the old world charm .

Do visit and if you are pork lover roaming around park Street and this is certainly the place to be .

It's a small Chinese restaurant located in park street. But the food here is really authentic and is money's worth. If anyone is looking to have good Chinese food in a limited budget,this place is worth a visit.

One of the most beautiful restaurant in the park street area. The beauty of this restaurant is not the appearance it is beacuse of the homely atmosphere i get to see...firstly it is a pure chinese restaurant and serve authentic chinese food. Secondly the resto run by a chinese family. It is a small place but very heartwarming because apart from their delicious food you will get to see a tiny naughty toddler(owner's son)running here and there. He really amazes me...
Now talking about the food. They serve really good quality food with a good quantity. And a very Reasonable price. 
Very good place to have dinner or lunch with family and friends :)

Lovely food. The place is kinda small but that apart,the food and ambience  are just fine to go with . loved the roasted chilly pork. The schezwan rice was to die for. The chicken was beautifully  done. The  noodles were unparallely good. Very nice customer  service. More than a single visit is recommended . Not at all pricey.

Disappointment had dawned upon me as soon as I kept my first step inside the restaurant. I hated the ambience. The food was kinda OK, nothing special or unique. Not to forget the¬† awful service of the waiters. They aren't trained enough.¬† * Served regular drinking water without asking for the other option.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† * Ignorant appearance. They needed me to yell at them "Excuse me" , as the soft, table-mannered voice was not enough. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *Worst part was the parceling of¬† the left over food. Can you expect any restaurant in the park street area parceling food in a paper box ( those which are used by roadside fast food "centers" ) , and putting the gravy prawn¬† within a tissue paper kinda thing¬† placed inside that box???!!! 

My experience was too bad.

Came down looking for a good Chinese cuisine and didn't leave disappointed. Had mixed fried rice as well as chicken hakka noodles. Fried rice was comparatively much better. Had chilli roasted pork. It was nice. Chilli garlic pepper chicken and Singapore chicken was good. Especially Singapore chicken.. Quantity was moderate. Little less spacious but its fine. Service was good as well.

The place has disappointed me very much. Ambience is not up to the mark. Quality of food is very bad. Being a fond of pork, I have ordered one roasted chilly pork which turned out to be a disaster. And yes the place is definitely not cheap !! I know some restaurants of park street whose services are far better than this restaurant being in the same category. I can not give more than 1.5.

Cheap, with OK quality food and very unresponsive staff. The behaviour of staff deteriorates with the increase in customers. Guess this is why it's CHEAP! Not recommended if you are willing to wait for more than 30 mins for soup and infinity for the main course       Rating it one cause it is light on the pocket. Please don't go with hungry kids. üëéüèº

Honestly if there is anything more important to you than the quality of food, then this isn‚Äôt the place for you. Price is cheap as per Park Street standards. Excellent location, bang opposite Mocambo and Tung Fong. There are two dining areas ‚Äì downstairs, and if that is full, head upstairs to a family area that is private and quiet.The decor is in keeping with the Chinese theme ‚Äì a reddish interior decorated with Asian decorative pieces. The dim lights aim to create a romantic ambiance, while the aquarium seems to provide a relaxed atmosphere.The service is prompt and unobtrusive; in fact, we were served by the manager of the restaurant. Seating is cozy yet there‚Äôs enough room to have a private conversation.In short, this restaurant is almost like one in Chinatown but at a better location in terms of food, price and service.
                                                                ...

Went to this place several times. The decor like a little china in Kolkata. V.nice ambience. Its a two storeyed restaurant. Their pan fried fish is a must have. Chicken items is good as well. And yaa pork items are also available. Even the noodles and rice is good too. One plate is sufficient for two. Price is really really reasonable. So what do we want more.
So if you really want good food with reasonable price must visit here üòä

Relatively low priced than other big shot restaurants in park street but when it comes to quality taste they are not soo charming.

I was disappointed with their preparation of chili chicken it tested like a very normal restaurant.

Expected more from this one.

The rhumbs ip things are the ambience the location the chinese delicacy.

Overall a good place to worth a visit

Their fresh lime Soda was good. The bill came out to be 500 rs including the main course and two sodas. Good for a one time visit though

One of the best places to eat Chinese food run by Chinese settled in Kolkata. Love their Pork and fish dishes and the prices are so reasonable, it's just unbelievable. We had some chilli roast pork which was really well done and recommended by the owner. The other dishes we had were the special Chow Mein and the special Meifoon noodles both with pork, chicken, prawns and egg. Both were made with lots of mixed meat and tasted great too. The Chinese tea is something I always love to have with a Chinese meal and not many places serve it so it is always good to have it available. My favourite place for Chinese food in Kolkata.

This is a little Chinese restaurant opposite the Vodafone store, and by little, I mean every letter of the word. It can barely hold 20 people. The thing that sets it apart from the other restaurants serving chinese in Park Street is that it does not have a bar. So if your planning for a family dinner with your kids, who have the habit of constantly asking "What is that uncle drinking?", this is a place that should come to your mind always.
The food here is nothing extraordinary. It is simple, with the flavours in correct proportion. Of all the dishes I have tried, Kung Pao Chicken and Drumstick have excited my tastebuds. The friedrice and chowmein are simple and just go down your neck without creating any drama.¬†
The ambience is what i love the most about this place. It gives you that distinct feeling of sitting in some city of China and having dinner with a Chinese family. Cause it's the owners who cook and serve. So your simply eating, hearing and at the same time interacting with a chinese family. And that is something which is completely rare.¬†
The prices would not burn down a hole in your pocket, and the quantities are enough to suffice two.¬†
I just gave 0.5 rating for the cute bundle of joy who is always there to bring a smile on your face.

Golden dragon is the cheapest restaurant in park street I guess. I and my friends went there on a Christmas night because there were huge crowd waiting outside the other restaurants and we were in a hurry. The interior, ambience is really not up to the mark because they charge extremely low for each dish. The taste of every dish were excellent and they serve them in huge quantity. Good experience it was.

I visited this place on the Ashtami evening this year. We ordered Roasted Chilli Pork, Mixed Hakka noodles, Golden Dragon special fried rice, lime chicken, veg Manchurian. The ambience was quite and friendly. The food was not bad but nothing extraordinary. The rice and the noodles were good though. As far as the Pork is concerned, Chungwah to me is still the best place to visit if you want to have Pork. The Lime chicken/ Lemon Chicken was disappointing. 
In short, it's a good peaceful homely place if you are hungry and up for some Chinese delicacies and budget is a constraint. But there are better places around.

Had a hard run on Nabami afternoon trying to book a place in Park Street for a proper lunch, when suddenly ran into this place and then I remember that it was recommended by a friend long back. It was less crowded than the other restaurants of the area. We ordered American Chopsuey, Fried Spring Chicken, Peiking Chicken, Chicken Shrimp Fried Rice, Golden Dragon Special Meifoon and Chilli Roast Pork. The food was really great taste-wise and quantity-wise considering the fact that we 3 were lavish eaters. The price was also within our budget. Other than that I wouldn't complain about the behavior of the stuffs because it's puja time and everywhere the waiters are going through a tough time. All in all a must visit for good Chinese food.

Pocket friendly and surprisingly good food. Golden Dragon special soup and the chilli garlic pepper chicken combo was ideal, the chicken could've been softer (suggest brining) but the soup was on spot. The Mandarin fish was a little too salty but if balanced with the gravy, it was just right. The special mixed fried rice wasn't special but you can't really go wrong with fried rice.

The d√©cor could be better and the managers being a tad friendly wouldn't hurt.

This restaurant is an absolute misfit in a place like Park street!

Ambience and decor : Shady, shabby place. Pathetic decor. Ambience is like that of a village bar.

A Chinese couple owns this restaurant and I have to say, they seriously need to check their behavior with customers. The owner's behavior was very rude and unprofessional and he was a huge turn off.

Food ordered :

‚Ä¢ chili roast pork : Very less quantity compared to other places charging the same price. Not tasty at all. Meat pieces were tough. I've had way better pork.

‚Ä¢ fried chicken wantons : DISGUSTING. The filling of chicken was so less, you won't even fast it. I felt like I was eating a plate of 'nimki'. Absolute rubbish!

‚Ä¢ schezuan fish : After having one piece of the fish, none of us could eat if any further. The fish was so smelly that eve. The gravy tasted like crap. Fresh fish doesn't smell fishy. This was a clear indicator of the quality and hygiene of this place.

‚Ä¢ chicken hakka noodles : Nothing special. Similar to any street food seller, Quality and quantity wise!

Visited this eatery on a Sunday evening. Didn't have to wait long to get in. We were seated on the first floor. We ordered chicken manchow soups, fried chicken wantons and chopsey. The service time, really can't comment as I was engrossed in conversation with my friends. The manchow soup was good. After which came the wantons. I have had better honestly. We didn't wait for the American chop suey to be served as we were getting late. We packed it. And that was good too. Overall it's a good restaurant. Go check it out if you're in park street.

Golden dragon is a small chinese joint located in Park street. This place is not well decorated  but the food is quite good and affordable as well.It is done with Chinese lanterns and Chinese dragons all over the wall. The service is good. The food was quite tasty. We had ordered a kung pao chicken and  fried rice. Both the dishes had a  authentic chinese flavour to it. This place is recommended when the chips are down for some good chinese food :)

We didn't wait for the American chop suey to be served as we were getting late. We packed it. And that was good too. Overall it's a good restaurant. Go check it out if you're in park street.

Golden dragon is a small chinese joint located in Park street. This place is not well decorated  but the food is quite good and affordable as well.It is done with Chinese lanterns and Chinese dragons all over the wall. The service is good. The food was quite tasty. We had ordered a kung pao chicken and  fried rice. Both the dishes had a  authentic chinese flavour to it. This place is recommended when the chips are down for some good chinese food :)

Not the most glamourous restaurant especially for a place like Park Street. Extremely pocket-friendly and the food is damn good. Proper Chinese place. Cantonese is something I would recommend. Chili Roast Pork is the best dish I had here. Chop Suey is very delicious too.

One of the oldest eatery in park street located right in front of mocambo. I visited this place on the occasion of one of my cousins birthday celebrations. Among the dishes,  the pork ones are the best with reasonable rates.

Ambience: Very old types
Food: Absolutely Fabulous
Quantity: Huge portions
Pocket Pinch: Low

My favorite at this joint is the G.D special gravy chowmein, Garlic Fish, Chilli prawn, Red Pepper Garlic Chicken, Schezwan Mixed Rice and Mixed Mei Foon. The quantity is huge. 

We ordered each one of the item mentioned above and the pocket pinch was around 1100 rupees for 4 people.

A small unglamorous restaurant in the high streets of Park Street. Surprisingly the food was quite good & light on the pocket too. I tried Mixed Hakka Noodles & Schezwan Chicken . A little bit maintenance can bring in more customers. I'm returning for sure.

Amidst different cuisines, and different offering, this Chinese joint stands tall. Be it group celebrations or friends hangout, they have an atmosphere to accommodate all! Food is reasonably priced and extremely enjoyable. Quite easy to miss since they do not have much hullabaloo about their entrance. But recommended place for their taste and quantity.

Many people might not be aware of Golden Dragon at a place like Park Street and that too when it is located opposite to restaurants like Tung Fong and Mocambo, it is indeed hard to notice this place.

But I can gurantee you that this place serves some of the best chinese food you will find in the city and the high point is that the prices are as cheap as hell.

A trait not so common at the restaurants in that particular area.

The ambience is good enough but the main attraction is the food. Brilliant to be specific.

I would recommend food lovers to give this place a try and you will surely not be disappointed.

It has been a while since I had a Chinese(the way we reason) meal and a visit to this place was a bliss. Mushroom pork was a great dish if somebody likes pork as well as mushroom.The noodles was quite heavy with a plate that can be shared by at most 3 people. Everything was nice with a gentle gesture of serving.Cool place to dine for a Classy Chinese for the people.

Another gem of park street serving really finger licking non vegetarian Chinese. I have been there back in 2013 when I used to visit Calcutta frequently and this hasn't changed a bit ! 

Same people with smiles on their face, helping you have some great time with best food! 

The dishes with prawns are great here. I generally don't like prawns but it's lovely here. The quantity of food is great and you will leave this place being satiated for sure. 

Must try if you are in Kolkata !

So I was walking down Park Street and saw this Chinese restaurant. It was looking very attractive. I ordered the food. It was yucks. Worst Chinese food I ever had. Worst fried rice. Worst baby corn. I stopped ordering. The only reason I gave a rating of 3 is because of good Chinese decoration.

One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city along with Chowman and Blue Poppy. Great for people on a tight budget.
Situated right next to Subway, it is one of the most affordable restaurants in Park Street. The place is a bit small and dark, but don't be put away by it's appearance. Service is commendable and the food is mouth watering. Personal favs being mushroom pork and chilli pork.

It's a good place, however, not a very popular eatery but it's almost quite crowded. Great place to have some nice Chinese delicacies and pork items. But the place is dimly lit which might be a bad thing for some people as it might feel a little gloomy. The prices are fine, not too low and not too high. So it's a nice place to go grab a lunch or dinner. 

Try having the pork wanton, chilli roast pork those are really good.

I've heard a lot about this restaurant. Went for a weekend lunch. A small cosy place, we were given a corner seat for two. Foods were good, ¬†adequate in quantity and decently priced :). Located right on free school street just beside the park street subway outlet. We had Golden Dragon special. soup, fried prawn, Chicken with hot garlic sauce, chicken shrimp fried rice . All items were delicious.
 I cannot compare it with Tung Fung or BarBQ in terms of ambiance, overall service etc., but definitely it's a great place to enjoy awesome pocket friendly Chinese delicacies without going to China Town. Must visit for all.

The food tasted quite ordinary.. the chilli pork & veg fried rice was fine but the veg manchurian was terrible !
The ambience was nothing great too compared to the other eateries in and around park street.. 
But must admit that it's quite budget friendly!
Dont know whether i m going back there again or not..
Advice for the management: please look after the taste of the dishes and some better lighting would definitely help too!

We stumbled upon this place while we were struggling to find an affordable restaurant after finding our usual food joint closed for the day. The ambiance gives you a hint of authentic Chinese restaurants with dark interiors, spot lights and Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling and inscriptions written with the Chinese script. The food here is sober and one plate is enough for two people.

The most pleasant thing about Golden Dragon is the fact that you're assured a hint of Chinese heritage when you pop in. The restaurant is right opposite Tung Fong, and has been there for a good while now. If you're wondering whether Golden Dragon is worth your money, I'd say yes. But like most other restaurants, the Golden Dragon also comes with its fair share of flaws.

The ambience was very calming on my nerves; I tend to prefer a lack of light to too much of it. The place is decently decorated with a tonne of Christmas fairy lights. They don't employ a very warm colour tone, so you might not feel very comfortable if you're finicky about that sort of thing.

The staff were courteous. Our food was ordered and served pretty quickly. Efficiency is the backbone of this place, but they aren't the most chatty lot. I hardly expect a waiter to be though. Communication with their customers at the start of service, till it's conclusion, was somewhat lacking. But I always found my glass full of water, and that's all I really need.

The food was a bit of a rollercoaster. The rice was absolutely stupendous! The chow however, didn't match up. The mushroom pork looked, smelled and tasted like heaven, but the Chilli pork wasn't up to the mark. I wouldn't recommend their Chilli Pork to anyone really. It's not the most generous helping, nor is it the tastiest. The mushroom pork though, is a must have! I recall the chow being too salty. It's a little worrying when the food you're served isn't consistent -- it doesn't assure a consistent dining experience. The plus side of which was the absolutely marvellous rice. I cannot get over it! They also price their food extreme well. The Golden Dragon could easily lure in customers on the basis of their cheap food pricing.

I would recommend a little more variety in the pork segment, and a little less salt to taste. But nevertheless, Golden Dragon makes for a decent dining experience. It isn't on my list of the best in Kolkata, but it's definitely worth the experience.

Ambience/Interiors: 3/5
Service: 3.5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Value for Money: 4/5

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

I've been to Golden Dragon several times. It was a surprise for me that I hadn't reviewed this place before.
It's like a comfort, go-to chinese place for my friends and me.
We've had almost the entire menu but I strongly recommend the prawn balls. Be it in schezuan or hot garlic style. For starters drumsticks are well,classic. Their chicken preps- hunan,peiking,kun pao,schezuan everything's great. I really liked their schezuan fish as well. Must try is their dragon spl Cantonese noodles. A great place to indulge in awesome chinese right in Park St,without having to go to China Town. Very reasonable pricing.

REVIEW UPDATE

Today went again. This time there was no empty table at the ground floor so for the first time went upstairs. Decor same as ground floor. Ordered Chicken shrimp chopsuey and chilli roast pork gravy. Chopsuey was quite good but quantity is little less. Chilli roast pork was fav as ever.

So, I just went there for Chopsuey and even with an almost empty restaurant, the staff just barely did their job. Bring the food (no offer to serve), and didnt even take the used plates away before offering the bill. They also didnt ask me whether I wanted anything in addition to the Chopsuey. Towards the middle of the meal, I had actually decided to have fresh lime soda, but no one asked.

The chopsuey was rather nice though. Thus, if you want to have nice chopsuey but almost impolite service, you may choose to go there. Hell even Subway is more courteous and they aren't even required to be.

Few minutes back i visited this restaurant,to give a birthday and farewell treat to my co-workers.I live around this restaurant's vicinity(Sudder Street)and this is the most terrifying one till date!!

We were made to wait near the entrance for 10 minutes for the top floor seating place to be ready,then 20 minutes for some one to come and take our food order.And that too i had to go down and request the owner or a lady in the billing counter to send someone up because we were very hungry and one of us had to leave early for giving tuition classes.Water wasn't even served for the time we were made to wait/sit.The quantity of food was way more less than that of the other eateries in the area,our appetite was not satisfied.

It really disheartened me because of the bad impression that my co-workers had on me that i brought them here and made them wait for 25 minutes!And that too,apparently for no fault of mine!My suggestion,LOOKS CAN BE DECEPTIVE,and that's what i experienced in real time in Golden Dragon!PLEASE DO NOT VISIT GOLDEN DRAGON,you will be irritated and harassed to the extreme point that you'll bang your head on a nearby wall!!

Situated right opposite tung fong/mocambo, this place is situated at the heart of city( just like all other restaurants in Park Streetüòã) The interior is like any typical Chinese restaurant, nothing which stands out. It is dimly lit and the place is slightly cramped. The staff is quite well behaved and service is efficient. However the food quality is mediocre which is a little disappointing. The quantity is sufficient and is quite economically viable so that is a good thing. It is not at par with restaurants situated on the opposite foot of the road and therefore it needs to reach up its game to give them any sort of competition.

I've been coming here since I was a baby. Today was possibly the zillionth time I said, "This is the best food in the world!" 
Okay, I admit... This has a 1% babyhood bias, but if you live in Kolkata and love Chinese, do make sure you visit this place at least once. And, if your ordering gravy noodles, make sure you remember to ask them to make it double-fried.
Yes, it's a simple place with simple decor, but it is simply the best Chinese in the city. No babyhood bias this time... :)

Located in the Heart of the city & Just opposite Bharat Petroleum & their Rival 'Tung Fong' also close to it.The interiors were well set for their Chinese interior with Dragons and Lanterns hung all over the place.The lights were dim which gives it a comfy feeling.The place is slighty cramped so you will have to see if seating is available or not.Food is a mediocre than you can describe.But atleast its the most reasonable restaurants around Park Street.As we settled down in our seats placed a couple of dishes like Chicken Hakka Chow....not Bad..Chilly Roast Pork.....Too dry and too salty....not much flavour....so Thumbs down....Then lastly we added a Chicken Manchurian with Less gravy...Was too Sour and again very blank with no aromatic spices to lure your taste buds.....so a disappointment...Over all a good place to dine in once in a while when You are a bit on Low on budget.After all what can we expect from a Place like Park Steet Avenue.

It so happens that whenever I go to Park Street, I end up eating here. The restaurant is exactly opposite Mocambo and easy to spot. I went there last Christmas with my family. The place was moderately crowded. We were seated upstairs which was nicely decorated. We had ordered Mixed Fried rice, Chicken in Garlic sauce and Sweet and sour Chicken. It was nice of the waiter to remind us that the Mixed Fried Rice will contain Pork. So, we then changed it to Chicken Shrimp Fried rice since my mother was not really into Pork. The rice dish was delicious. The amount was handsome and filled with chunks of chicken and Shrimp. 2 dishes of rice proved to be more than 4 of us could eat even though we were famished. The Chicken in Garlic sauce was good too though I didn't particularly like the smell of Garlic in it. The sweet and sour chicken was out of the world. I don't remember tasting a better Chicken dish anywhere. I loved the restaurant,loved the d√©cor and it's hospitality. Next time I go there, I would like to taste Pork.
P.S. The prices were easy on the pocket too.

Ambience - 2.5/5 : Although based on typical Chinese theme but little dark and cramped.¬†
Food - 4/5 : Only the food here will probably take you back there again. Great taste wit less oil. Quantity is sufficient.
Service - 2.5/5 : Waiters doesn't even know how to serve. They'll just keep the food and go. You have to tell them that pls get the food served, otherwise they won't. ¬†
Value for money - 4/5 : Very cheap. In area like Park street, this restaurant is very affordable.

Situated right opposite tung fong/mocambo, this place is situated at the heart of city( just like all other restaurants in Park Streetüòã) The interior is like any typical Chinese restaurant, nothing which stands out. It is dimly lit and the place is slightly cramped. The staff is quite well behaved and service is efficient. However the food quality is mediocre which is a little disappointing. The quantity is sufficient and is quite economically viable so that is a good thing. It is not at par with restaurants situated on the opposite foot of the road and therefore it needs to reach up its game to give them any sort of competition.

I've been coming here since I was a baby. Today was possibly the zillionth time I said, "This is the best food in the world!" 
Okay, I admit... This has a 1% babyhood bias, but if you live in Kolkata and love Chinese, do make sure you visit this place at least once. And, if your ordering gravy noodles, make sure you remember to ask them to make it double-fried.
Yes, it's a simple place with simple decor, but it is simply the best Chinese in the city. No babyhood bias this time... :)

Located in the Heart of the city & Just opposite Bharat Petroleum & their Rival 'Tung Fong' also close to it.The interiors were well set for their Chinese interior with Dragons and Lanterns hung all over the place.The lights were dim which gives it a comfy feeling.The place is slighty cramped so you will have to see if seating is available or not.Food is a mediocre than you can describe.But atleast its the most reasonable restaurants around Park Street.As we settled down in our seats placed a couple of dishes like Chicken Hakka Chow....not Bad..Chilly Roast Pork.....Too dry and too salty....not much flavour....so Thumbs down....Then lastly we added a Chicken Manchurian with Less gravy...Was too Sour and again very blank with no aromatic spices to lure your taste buds.....so a disappointment...Over all a good place to dine in once in a while when You are a bit on Low on budget.After all what can we expect from a Place like Park Steet Avenue.

It so happens that whenever I go to Park Street, I end up eating here. The restaurant is exactly opposite Mocambo and easy to spot. I went there last Christmas with my family. The place was moderately crowded. We were seated upstairs which was nicely decorated. We had ordered Mixed Fried rice, Chicken in Garlic sauce and Sweet and sour Chicken. It was nice of the waiter to remind us that the Mixed Fried Rice will contain Pork. So, we then changed it to Chicken Shrimp Fried rice since my mother was not really into Pork. The rice dish was delicious. The amount was handsome and filled with chunks of chicken and Shrimp. 2 dishes of rice proved to be more than 4 of us could eat even though we were famished. The Chicken in Garlic sauce was good too though I didn't particularly like the smell of Garlic in it. The sweet and sour chicken was out of the world. I don't remember tasting a better Chicken dish anywhere. I loved the restaurant,loved the d√©cor and it's hospitality. Next time I go there, I would like to taste Pork.
P.S. The prices were easy on the pocket too.

Although the food quantity and quantity is good in the restau, ambience is poor with respect to its surrounding restaurants like Mocambo, Tung fong, Peter Cat.. Reasonable price is the best attribute. For a budget friendly Chinese food, Golden Dragon is good.

Below average restaurant...The waiter placed the food and left, without even asking whether the food needs to be served. We ordered for Chili fish ¬†as starter. You can check the attached picture to get an idea how it tasted. Charred, smelly and tasted nothing like how chili fish normally tastes. We were hungry so had to order something else. The chicken hakka noodles that we got looked & tasted similar to what any street stall would make. Price is cheap. Actually they shouldn't dare charge more for the food that they make. Portion is okay. Manager/Owner is courteous.

A great place in Park street. The restaurant has a nice ambience for a quiet dinner or lunch. Tried the Chicken drumsticks and Spring Fried Chicken. The chicken was well cooked and the outer layer was crispy. For main course tried the Golden Dragon Special Fried Rice and Capsicum Pork.Both the dishes were well prepared .Definitely not the typical chinese food you get everywhere as the taste here was different. 
Pocket friendly place. 
Loved it, will surely visit again.

Went for a lunch treat last month. had to wait around 20minutes since we were around 17 people in number and without any booking in advance. Because of the large number we were seated in the upper tier of the restaurant. The quality of the food was really good (maybe a 3.5/5) but the quantity was really little.

This place was in my wish list since quite long. The positive reviews I got about this place were quite tempting. One scorching afternoon after my classes got over, I decided to visit this place for lunch. And so we went. 
Very easy to find. Its located in park street in the ground floor of park mansion,bang on opposite Mocambo. 
Place is small. Nothing special about the decor or ambience. Except ofcourse the food. My hungry tummy was completed satiated with their delicious lip-smacking food. We had a golden dragon special fried rice along with chilly roast pork and for drink we took one Pepsi. The pork was heavenly and so was the rice. The prices are very reasonable especially for the forever broke students like me.
Only thing is that it would be better if they try to maintain some hygiene.
I'm absolutely in love with this joint. I'm visiting this place again very soon.

Golden dragon is a student favourite and the pocket friendly option in Park street.

Food:4/5: The quality of food is really good. I would suggest the chili roast pork to all interested.

Price:4/5: While not the cheapest, but definitely one of the most reasonably priced restaurant in the Park street area.

Ambience: 2.5/5 They have tried to give a feeling of china in the restaurant with paintings, however the twinkly lights kind of spoil it. While the decorations are nice, the restaurant itself is a bit cramped with little or no chance of private conversation.

Cheapest Chinese restaurant in Park Street area.This is the only good thing about this place. We were 4 friends. We ordered French Chicken Mushroom Soup and Chicken Hot Sour Soup. Both tasted as they should be, nothing special.We were confused about the quantity of the soup though. While ordering, the staff asked 1/4th or 1/2. we assumed they will serve 1 bowl of soup dividing into 4 bowls. so we said 1/4th. when it arrived, it was only 1 small bowl of 1/4th amount. when enquired, the staff said we ordered only 1 bowl of 1/ 4th soup. That means we had to say 4 bowls of 1/4th soup!!!???? It was really confusing, the staff didn't cooperate at all, and charged full price.
Then we had Chicken szechuan noodles,chicken fried rice and chilli roast pork. Rice and noodles could be better. Quantitywise these are enough for 2 persons.Pork was good though.Ambience was average, it's a very small place, lights were not enough, ac was working though.

The Golden Dragon is a great option for people low on money but high on hunger. The biggest complaint I have about this place is that despite looking like a perfect small Chinese restaurant, complete with ancient looking artifacts, wall hangings and dim lighting, it does not serve authentic Chinese food but goes for the same variant of Indo-Chinese stuff.¬†¬†They make a mean chilly pork roast and some really filling and tasty noodles and rice. I had tried their chilly chicken once though and it was a tad disappointing : almost tasted like a curry.¬†A nice variety to Park Street's usual flashy opulence.

If you want to avoid the rush and don't want to stand for hours in queue specially for Sunday lunch near the Park street area then visit this place for some good tasty Chinese food.
Our first choice was a different hotel but that was too crowded which I thought useless to wait and make myself more hungry. We then opt for this restaurant as we want to have Chinese.
We entered and saw a small space with 6 or 7 seating arrangements and little lighting in the wall. The menu card is full of delicious names and a wide variety. For starter we ordered Szchwan prawn balls along with Fresh lime Soda. The prawn balls were tasty to eat but I didn't realise it to be prawns. A little bit can be worked on this dish to make your customers feel that they are eating prawns.
Anyway for lunch we ordered Mixed fried rice along with Garlic fish and Chicken with babycorn vegetables as the side dish. No complaints for any of the dishes. The garlic fish was too yummy. The fish pieces were so soft and the gravy was perfectly done. Even the chicken with the vegetables were not so spicy but it comes up with a totally different taste.
After having all this we paid a bill of 860 rupees. If u are looking for pocket friendly restaurant which serves u yummy Chinese then u can no doubt visit this place near Park street area and have a nice experience. ...

Golden Dragon located at the ever happening Park Street is a good option to dine out, for authentic Chinese lovers. This place boasts of authentic Chinese cuisine at pocket-friendly prices. The ambience too adds to the authenticity of the restaurant. The service is a little slow but food is worth the wait. The Chopsuey(Chinese, American and regular) is a must try along with the Red Pepper Chicken. Also, another reason to visit this place is pocket friendly pork savouries!

This is definitely my favourite Chinese food joint in Kolkata. The food here is absolutely amazing and the prices are very reasonable given the quantity. It is in every sense valid for money! My personal favourites are :

Chicken Drumsticks - These drumsticks are my favourite. I love the simplicity of flavour. It makes a wonderful starter to a lovely meal. The chicken is cooked perfectly and has a wonderful colour. It's crisp and heavenly.

Chicken Wanton Soup - Another dish that is truly fabulous. The soup is a clear soup with vegetables and wonderfully cooked chicken dumplings. It is arguably one of the best soups I have ever tried.

Prawn in Hot Garlic Sauce - I simply love the garlicky flavour in the sauce, I order this every single time I have food here. The prawns are cooked really well and the quantity is very generous.

Chicken and Prawn Cantonese Noodles - These noodles have wonderful taste and they by themselves can make a great meal for one. Though some people find it a bit bland, I absolutely adore the flavours in the dish. The quantity of chicken and prawns is also quite a lot.

Apart from these their chicken and Prawn hakka chow and chicken shrimp fried rice are also very very tasty.
The ambience is quite comforting. The lights are dim and there are some nice lamps and hangings. The place also has an edge in my books atleast because of the really reasonable price for all dishes! This is one of my favourite restaurants in all of Kolkata.

One from the past...would eat here quite often when I was a student of Loreto House. Remains a good one for authentic Park Street chinese fare. We had special soup and golden fried prawns for starters. The soup was delicious and the prawns were large ones and crisp. Special fried rice, special chowmein, chilli chicken and chilli roast pork made up the main course. All the dishes were tasty and well prepared but the pick of the day was the chilli roast pork. A place to go back to....

Located on the foot opposite to mocambo near the parkstreet crossing, this chinese eatery is quite a famous place for people who are looking to enjoy a good meal at parkstreet without burning a serious hole in their pockets.
Coming to the ambience, it is decent and resembles a typical chinese restuarant with dim lighting and hanging lamps. However the space is quite limited and the decor is okayish, nothing great.
Service is also average and the waiters are not very efficient, however, the food came in a moderately fast time.
We ordered french chicken mushroom soup, crispy chilli babycorn, mixed american choupsey, chicken drumsticks and chicken spring rolls.
The crispy chilli babycorn tasted good. It was well made and one cud get the taste of the actual corn in it.
The chicken drumstick came in good quantity was decent in taste. I found less quantity of chicken and more amount of fried batter in the drumstick. Nonetheless, it was quite good.
The french mushroom and chicken soup came in surprisingly smaller bowl, but the soup had ample amount of chicken nd mushroom. Tasted avarage but was quite refreshing.
The chicken spring rolls were very good in taste. They even smelled awesome. It mentions 6 pieces in the menu. However its 2 big pieces of spring rolls cut into 6 smaller cubic portions. Its filled with lot of veggies nd u wont get any distinct taste of chicken.
The american choupsey came in huge quantity and it tasted quite good too. It was a good dish.
Overall a good experience. The pocket pinch is also low.
However they charge the regular vat and service tax. Nonetheless, a good place to visit on a tight budget if u r at parkstreet!
Extra 0.5 for their low pricing of their dishes

Being only a few minutes walk away from my office along with the not so high-end pricing like other places in its vicinity, I have been here very often with colleagues, friends, team lunches, farewells, and lot more! Chilli Pork Dry and Prawn Chinese Chopsuey have been my favourite thus far but their wantons, soups, and some of the fish dishes (like Szechwan Fish & Garlic Fish) are also pretty good! Do try some Chinese tea as it goes with spicy food better than cold drinks!¬†A lot more to come from this Dragon..!¬†PS: Be ready to meet a very cute little kid who is bound to be the next generation owner of this place. So, be nice to this cutie! ;)))

Went here twice. This place has serious hygiene issues. The last time I visited, I was greeted by roaches that roamed about bravely on my table. We ordered pork wantons, roasted chilly pork and Chicken. Well, nothing to write about the food. It's economical especially if you're visiting in a group. The ambience is cute. Once a try is fine.

Here the ambience is good. Their Chinese foods are authentic n one cannot just complain about the dishes. Mixed fried rice n Singapore chicken dishes are the best.

You must visit it once in a while with your friends. The ambience has a Chinese touch and you will be drifted away from kolkata's hustle-bustle to a tranquil area to enjoy food. Though they take a longer time in serving your orders but the food is awesome. We tried  Hunan chicken, Golden dragon spl. chowmein, they are just awesome.

Not an avid lover of Chinese food but heard a few recommendations about this restaurant from my colleagues so was always eager to try the place and today finally got the chance. The place is very well decorated and the dim lights totally sets the mood. Now coming to the food, we had to wait a while for food to arrive but the food totally made up for it. We had veg sweet corn soup,fried golden baby corn,veg garlic Hakka chow and kung pao chicken. Expect soup loved every other dish to the core and it wasn't too heavy on our wallet too, all in all a great experience and I will definitely be coming back for more. :D

I used to swear by this place for inexpensive food Chinese food but the last time I visited this place I was disappointed. The food here is generally good, but keep in mind that the ambience is average. I particularly like the Cantonese Noodles here. The good part is that it is one of the cheapest restaurants in Parkstreet, and sells a good variety of dishes. But the bad part is that the food is not consistent - sometimes it's great and sometimes it's below average.

Situated right opposite to mocambo, the place provides decent Chinese food when you are on a low budget. The  food is good and is frequented by college students such as myself. They make decent pork dishes. Now it'd be unfair to expect something extraordinary from this joint, but they do one hell of a job with quantity and fast service.

A sudden visit it was, and i was quite unsure about the quality of food there. But surprisingly it turned out to be very good. We tried hot sour soup which was nice, then in the main course we ordered fried rice and chilly chicken. Somehow i felt that the chicken could had been better. Anyways it was pretty good.

There's a typical chinese feel u will get once u enter this joint...dim lighting of the restaurant makes it a perfect place for a romantic dine out.. 
Have visited this place twice..
On the first visit had ordered veg fried rice and hunan chicken both of which tasted good not great though.
On the second visit had ordered veg fried rice, veg hakka noodles and red pepper chicken..  The red pepper chicken was very good.. 
In a place like park street, this restaurant is quite pocket friendly compared to other chinese joints in parkstreet...

Every person who wants a cheap, decent meal while they are at Park Street, should consider Golden Dragon as an option. 

The place doesn't promise a lot, nor should one have a lot of expectations. It's economically priced our-everyday-favourite-Chinese. 

We usually order the Schezwan Rice and a side dish called Chicken, with Babycorn & French Mushrooms. Together they make a very good lunch. Service is quick, efficient. 

The interiors look a bit seedy. But the bill makes you overlook that. :p 

So a favourite place of

Golden Dragon is situated on the opposite side of Mocambo. The interior of this place looks fabulous and the dim lights make it an apt place for a quiet lunch/dinner. I recently visited this place and found it good enough. We ordered fried chicken wantons, egg fried rice, egg hakka noodles and chicken with French mushrooms. The quantity is okayish and the chicken pieces were too small. Overall a nice place to visit. üòä‚úå

Actually my friend suggested this place for its Kung Pao Chicken which was good enuf but anything else was bordering mediocrity. 
Dont get me wrong this is still a good place to hangout and have Chinese food specially keeping in mind the affordable price but for serious Chinese affair is what you look for there are other places around Park Street. :)

Located opposite mocambo. The place seems quiet from outside but the two storeyed place is almost always full. The place is actually a cheap place in Park Street. Another notable thing is the family running the restaurant is very cozy. The place serves good Chinese. The noodles is what you should look out for.

Taste of food is 50-50. Restaurant is in Park Street however do not expect the food quality here. Restaurant is based on Chinese Dining. However this restaurant is very cheaper comparing to its neighbours. 

Service is very slow and ambience id just ok. This could be the favourite restaurant for Students.

The ambience and decorations are nice enough. I feel the pork dishes here are marginally better than their other items.

Not a place that will send you into raptures but definitely gives you the feeling of having made the right choice especially when you are on a budget. Serving authentic Chinese, both the quality and quantity of the food is quite fulfilling. Does not have much of an ambience or decor and is a little constricted and cramped for place but then again good food at reasonable prices surely make up. A great place to treat people in large groups.

If you go without much of an expectation you will undoubtedly enjoy.

I have been here quite a few times, its at the Park Street and Mirza Ghalib Street crossing, besides Subway and opposite of Mocambo. This is a very small, shabby looking place that offers Chinese cuisine at the most pocket friendly price, considering its location on Park Street, which is known for being one of the biggest food hubs of Kolkata. Now the ambience is nothing great but the staffs are friendly and the service is okay, considering one only has to wait for a few minutes till the food is brought to the table. The staffs are also very helpful with their suggestions. Now for the food, the dishes that I have tried are: 

1. Mixed Meifoon - This is one of their best main course dishes, I have tried it a few times and the taste was good every time. 
2. Mixed Hakka Noodles - This one was decent at best. The prawns served in it were very small.
3. Mixed Cantonese Noodles - This one was absolutely not good. The noodles were partly deep fried and the overall taste was below average.
4. Szechuan Chicken - This was okay and was not too spicy, as it is at some other restaurants.
5. Chicken with Garlic Sauce - This dish was quite good, it had a mild sweet taste and there were about 8-10 pieces of chicken of decent size.
6. Chili Roast Pork (Dry) - This dish was very good. It was very mildly spicy and the pieces of pork were tender, juicy and slightly crispy all blending together to give an extraordinary taste.
The price is very very cheap, food for two people would cost around ‚Çπ500-550, which is quite reasonable but don't expect anything outstanding.
All in all it has been a mixed experience for me, some of the dishes were really very good while others were below average. Also this review is based on my experience from my collective outings at this place, so one can argue that may be the food just wasn't up to the mark on a particular day, which can happen.
Hence if one is looking to have decent Chinese food in the Park Street area at the most affordable price, don't look beyond this place, just look beyond some of its short comings and you will be satisfied.

My love of Chinese food and recommendations of a few friends brought me here...and I was not disappointed ! We ordered schezwan noodles,chicken fried rice and chilli garlic pepper chicken. All the items were delicious! The rates are reasonable and the ambience is very nice.The place is dimly lit with hanging chinese lamps and since we visited during Christmas it was well decorated ! If you are a bit low on cash and want to have good chinese food in park street then this is the place to go! However,the service is quite slow and needs to be improved.

Golden Dragon used to be an old haunt and an absolute favourite of mine. And my partner's. Need a quick Chinese fix without blowing up too money? It would always be Golden Dragon, the next best thing to Tangra. We didn't mind the lack of alcohol, the ajinamoto induced happiness more than made up for it. Huge portions and delicious, no fuss food is what characterized it, apart from being very easy on the pockets. But things have changed of late.

We recently visited the restaurant after nearly one and a half years. The prices have increased. By a lot. We don't really mind that but the potions have drastically reduced as well and that's what really disappointed us. We had the chicken fried rice and the hot garlic chicken. The taste was nice as always, thankfully. Our other favourites here include the crispy chicken wantons and the chicken with mixed vegetables. Why do all good things have to eventually get disappointing? Sigh.

Have visited atleast 7-8 times, but so you can understand how budget friendly this place can be - just in case you have to tr8 your gf for dinner at a really cool place, this place may be the one!!! 
Recommended dishes Wanton soup, peiking and hunan chicken with golden dragon special chowmien. Just like that plain and simple. Have fun visiting this place.

The moment I entered the restaurant I went to flashback so many tasty memories lol anyways we got settled down in one corner. Same old decor nothing to write as almost everyone knows about it. 
Now let's come on the food part we started with soup Veg French Mushroom soup and chicken hot n sour soup we were so hungry that after completing the whole soup we remember we  did not click one pic after that we order for fried chicken wontons and for main course we ordered veg mei foon chicken mei foon pork mei foon ( one fren loves pork ) and veg manchurian shredded garlic chicken and chilly pork. Must say the food is authentic Chinese food yum to taste and quality is also good so is the quantity and also affordable. After lunch we were all satisfied will full tummy hahah. 
Had a great lunch quality time always be the same Golden Dragon üëçüëçüëç

This place will provide you the typical road Chinese which is so tasty that you can't get enough. So I went with a friend there and we had pork spring rolls , which were steaming hot but really really good. We next had fish in a spicy curry and mixed non vegetarian noodles which had shrimps, chicken, pork and ham. Their food was above average, with the right amount of sauces and good balance of taste. We even had crispy chili baby corn because Chinese food is so incomplete without it. It's a good place that serves cheap and good Chinese food.

Park street also have some joints where it is not too heavy on your pockets. This place is such of a kind. You would get  chinese (don't expect authentic chinese) or a better chinese . It is actually a filler. It is a good restuarant. The ambience is also good . More over light in our@ pockets. 
The quality is also good. But the restuarant must take a look on the  quantity. Tried the chicken fried rice pieking chicken , chicken in hot garlic sauce these stuffs are good.

Went there on Shosthi, didn't really liked the ground floor ambience. The first floor was okay-ish. Reasonable price, that means it won't cut a hole in your pocket. However, the food quality was not very good. Some preparations like the chilli chicken felt tasteless. Won't recommend going there.

All the food items were good and the quantity per plate served two!Not OTT but still fair enough!
The USP of this restaurant is that it's reasonably priced considering the other restaurants in the vicinity(Mocambo, Peter Cat , Tung Fong)
In short.......Nice for a birthday treat or a casual dining with friends or family!

A restaurant I go back to every time I have a craving for uncomplicated old-school Chinese food. Their Dry Roast Chilli Pork and Golden Dragon special Gravy Chowmein pair handsomely and are a MUST TRY! The half-crisp half-soft texture of their Special Gravy Chowmein is one that is quite unusual and and absolutely fantastic! The other items are good too.. So in love with these two dishes that rarely do we order anything else. The prices are very reasonable too... One of the last bastions of  "Mains below ‚Çπ200" in Park Street. Strongly recommended by this foodie. Deducting .5 for the seating issues downstairs.

An usual fare for us is the chilli roasted pork and fried prawn balls. These are excellent and so is the rest of the food in general.

Price is cheap for Park Street standards.

In short, this restaurant is almost like one in Chinatown but at a better location in terms of food, price and service.

Visited this place with collage friends few days ago.In starter we ordered Fish finger,but it was not up to the mark,ordinary in tatse.In main course we ordered mixed fried rice and mix chowmin,both the dishes are delicious. We have also tried Szechuan Fish, it was amazing and wonderful in taste.Ambience is nice but I think it's little dark.Staffs are well mannered. Overall it's a pleasant experience.

The food over here was good. Specially chicken drumstick and chicken fried rice were nicely prepared. The food served were hot and they were good in taste also.
In terms of management I would give them 2.5 out of 5. They delayed to prepare and serve the food.¬†
Apart from this it was a good lunch.

The place is right opposite Mocambo and since we had a 90 minute wait there, we chose it.
The food is decent. The mandarin fish deserves a mention since it was the only highlight of an otherwise insipid meal
The service is bad. Very bad.
You have to remind them to get your order. I went down to the front desk and reminded them before being served. And this is when the restaurant was almost empty (at 2:15 PM in Pujo time)

Avoid unless you are desperate.

There were no vegetables in the chicken chow mein just boiled.white noodles.and a few pieces of chicken. The dry chilli chicken was black with  a few chillis . Their take away is a real let down. No v√†lue as you cannot see what your getting. Very disappointing.  Hawkers serve you better fried rice and chilly chicken.  Dont seem like the management are  interested in the customers  opinion......coz we have complained before while in the restaurant  but they look at you blank & make excuses........

This is one of the many old places in kolkata serving chinese delicacies. But to put it outright, there is nothing new or worth a mention about this place. The ambience is okayish,the sitting arrangement is just ordinary and simple. The staff are not very enthusiastic and has to be called several times for placing the order. The food here is also ordinary. Among the many dishes i tasted here i liked the lime garlic chicken and the chicken spring roll. The noodles are rice served here has quite a good taste to it but nothing special . The price of the food is in sync with the quality. Overall the experience here has been average on both my visits and I am not going back there if given an option.

If you want good Chinese food near park street which is not so costly then definitely this is the place to visit. Quality of food is excellent but the quantity is little less. Sevice is prompt. No hard drinks which is a let down for such a location like park street. Have gone there many a times with friends and family. Roast chilli pork is my favourite along with chow chow rice. There soups are very authentic in taste. I have tried their Thai soup which is a combination of both spice and simplicity. Ambience is nothing special and the tables are also pretty cramped up. I would recommend it any day of the week because of its food.

A pleasant little oriental house tucked away between all the more lavish eateries on Park Street...walked in to get some pork, wasn't disappointed! Chill Pork, dry, probably one of the most succulent meats you'd ever taste.
Went back to try their Manchurian fish and prawn in ginger sauce. Try, if you fancy. Ambience is old 90's, hillside....very contrasting to the sparkle of Park Street. Quite a welcome change.

As the name says 'Dragon', it is actually dragging on their poor quality food every time we visit, leaving us with nothing but disappointments. Ambience and food quality should be checked by the authorities and must be rectified, so as to have positive reviews. All that I can say is, It is one of the worst restaurants I have ever visited in my lifetime. So, Golden Dragon, change for better so as to justify the 'Golden'. :)
Thank you.

A fancy joint Golden Dragon is not, but one has to congratulate them on the spot on seasoning. Not one person from our lunch party of more than a dozen even reached for the salt, the pepper, or even any of the sauces.

Average decor, run of the mill furniture and the lack of ample lighting is what you'll immediately notice. While the the side dishes and mains - Sweet and Sour Chicken, Chilli Fish, Veg Garlic Noodles, Mei Foon - were pretty average, the starters were excellent. 

The Chicken Spring Roll was, by far, one of the best spring rolls I've tried. Crisp on the outside with just the right amount of filling, they were simply delish. The Chicken Wanton was rather good too. Will definitely be back for these two dishes.

A cozy restaurant with a proper ambiance. 
The prawn is a MUST TRY in this restaurant- Hunan Prawn, Golden Dragon Prawn; Any kind of Prawn and they'll nail it. 
The mei fun, rice and rice noodles were sufficient in amount and so was the Manchow Soup. These dishes were too good. 
The only complaint is the baby corn being a little too floury . 
Keep it up! :)

Owners are very nice and are always on the premises. Just thought your Taxes are very hefty...!!!!! Needless to mention requires refurbishment.

My good friend in college treated us here. This place was my suggestion though, combining all the good factors of having AC, very affordable, tasty Chinese, in a well known locality.
We came here at 4, a troop of eight very hungry people and ordered as follows.
Mixed Fried Rice
Chili chicken
Red pepper chicken
Chili fish.
I try, wherever possible to order fish at Chinese restaurants, to see if it was worth its salt.
The ambience was dark, a bit too much perhaps, but I loved the mirrors and the gorgeous dragon motifs all over the walls.
Orders did take time, about 35 minutes. Food came in well coordinated manner by waiters too rude to give a smile or even to portion food. Bad servicing there.
The rice had ample amounts of chicken, egg and deveined prawns, and was absolutely delectable.
Chili chicken had chicken cooked properly in a not too gloopy gravy, which was perfect.
Red pepper chicken made the wimps at the table cry üòÅ but the gravy was yum, a bit hot though, as expected. But nothing that'll blow your face off.
After having bites of the food on the table, I turned to my chili fish. Same gravy as the chili chicken...but good God, the fish was amazing. Custard tender, briny yet sweet, fresh bekti coated gently in a soft batter, it was imperatively NOT SHARED and finished in seconds.
Portion sizes were puny (maybe because all the times I've gone there I'd been ravenous), but apt for the price.
Our total bill came to 1526, all inclusive, which was totally value for money.
I've returned for that fish and also the chimney soup, and I suggest you do too üòä

This is fairly a normal Chinese joint serving 'Indianized'  Chinese food for decades.  What they serve are nothing exceptional,  but suits your pocket. The dishes are quite reasonably priced. We had spring fried chicken which was nicely done.  But the mixed rice we had in main course was prepared with undercooked shrimp. Another big let down was Beijing chicken which was completely bland to say the least. The dimly lit interior is good but seats are little cramped up. Over all a somewhat decent restaurant which can come handy while budget is a constraint.

One of those restaurant which strongly believe in their food.
Situated near park Street area adjacent to subway.... One of the prime location in this area.
Visited here on several occasions. Decent interior with old style Chinese decor.
On the other occasions on of my friend didn't like the ambiance as the restaurant was full and all the tables were closely set as the carpet area of the restaurant is very small, but on the other side I felt the ambiance was good and the pricing for the food was very moderate, so for such low priced restaurant its good, and there is a difference in casual dining and fine dining.
Ordered for chicken clear soup, American chop suey, Singapore chicken, egg fried rice.
Service was good and quick, sequencing was also good nothing was dumped together.
I personally felt chicken was little dry, could be because of over frying.
My friend was expecting a sunny side up toped on chop suey but it wasn't served, my friend is a big fan of chop suey and he says it is part of chop suey...... Though every restaurant has their own policies.
Overall the food was good an our taste buds was satisfied...

Anyway, the food was not bad i guess, little above average. There are better chinese restaurants in Kolkata. Had this restaurant been in China Town, it would have a tough competetion to deal with. Anyway, it is a fairly good place to dine when in park street. The plus point are the prices. The food is real cheap, you could stuff your tummy with all the food you want without burning a big hole in your pocket. 3.5 for me. Give it a go. Do try the chilli chicken. Loved it.

This is probably one of the oldest restaurant in park street area. At least I have seen Golden Dragon being there for the last two decades. Whenever I think of Golden Dragon the first foid item that comes to my mind is Golden Fried Prawns. According to me they serve the best golden fried prawns in the city. The five pieces of prawns just melts in your mouth and the taste is bound to linger for days. I remember visiting the restaurant during our college days when we friends used to order starters and spend the entire noon here with lots of good food and adda. I specially liked the mezzanine floor... it is very cozy and gives you a very snug environment. Among other food items I like their schezuan chicken and the hakka noodles. The best part is they have a wide variety of mouthwatering starters which are must try items if you are a foodie.

After a long time, I am again back Zomato. Sunday dinner in Park Street can be quite a mood lifter.¬† Fortunately, we did not face any long queue and got our sitting arrangement. If you notice the decor of this place, it will give you a China Town feeling with Chinese wall hanging and dragon night lamp. As far as sitting arrangement is concerned, it is fairly comfortable. 
We ordered Dry Chilli Roast Pork, Chicken Hakka Chowmein and Red Pepper Chicken. As far as food is concerned, it was pretty¬† good in terms of both quality and quantity. They did not take much time to serve the dishes too. As far as service is concerned, it was pretty average in my opinion. It would have been good if we could have got alcohol over there. There are rooms for improvement too.
I have given four out of five as the food was good at fair price.

It says a lot to have etched a name of it's own amidst a horde of Kolkata's best restaurants- that too in the prime entertainment zone of the city! Went here for dinner few days back.¬†The ambience was cozy and the decor was simple. The seating area is limited and not very spacious.¬†We ordered Sweet Lime Soda, Chicken Drumstick, Special Mixed Mei Foon, Chicken Mei Foon, Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce and Chilly Roast Pork. The food took quite a while to arrive. The quantity of food is very impressive for their very reasonably priced menu. But the quality of food seemed like a gamble. The Mei Foon was disappointing. Very average and tasted nothing like what it should. I personally think the drumsticks could have been better too. But the fish was good - Tender, juicy and the right blend of spices and I loved the pork which was cooked to perfection! Probably the only reason why I'd like to go back and try a few more dishes from their menu!¬†
Overall, a satisfactory experience - Great value for money! For a very economic and filling Chinese meal, this is a very good option. But Not! If you're looking for a competitive quality at par with the other big names in Park St.

The food experience was average.Ordered American chopsuey..though I don't like it but my friend insisted on having it.Frankly..I just hated it here more..It was just crispy noodles dunked in loads of tomato ketchup.Pepper chicken with mixed meifoon was okay..I had better in other places.Red pepper chicken was average in taste.The place is too small..It had 4 tables only.The only plus side is that it's probably the cheapest Chinese restaurant in park street area.

Location: Opposite to the mocambo.

Ambience: Nice.

Food: Ordered chinese chopsuey and chinese chopsuey. Taste is okayish! They fried the total amount of chowmein, but usally in chopsueys it is used to be half fried!! They do not keep any desert item in their menu.

Service: Very poor. They really have no manner how to treat with customers. They dont serve the dishes to our plates. They need to asked to fill the glasses for water.

Price: Reasonable.

Overall: If you have a hole in your pocket in the park street area go for it.

Quite good food.. but not excellent.. The ambiance is good.. The working staffs are not so expert in their systems.. The food quality is quite good but it is not good enough for the price estimated there.. So the quality could have been better...
The dishes are sufficient and the quality of the rice is not as expected...
the non veg items are quite good.. but as i have said earlier it could have been better... i have ordered a chicken pate as side dish but the chicken was not soft enough as it should be.. overall we cannot say that the restaurant is very good....

Nice, cozy place in the Park Street area. Friendly staff, decent ambiance, feels a bit cramped, but that is before you discover the first floor. Nice place to have an unplanned lunch with friends. Decent food, and more importantly, easy on the pocket. Not some place you'd plan to go, but just drop by and have a nice time of it all.

Golden Dragon...as the name suggests is an authentic chineese restaurant in a corner of Park Street. Unassuming from the outside this is one place which serves delicious authentic chineese food. Surrounded by legendary and famous restaurants in the food capital of kolkata, over the years,  Golden Dragon has etched a place for itself. Ambience and service is very homely and its very pocket friendly. I have been visiting this place since my college days and this place has never disappointed me. My personal favourites include Chicken Wanton Soup, Talumien Soup, Prawn Garlic Sauce, Chicken/Pork Spring Rolls, Lime Garlic Chicken, Hunan Chicken and Chilli Roast Pork.

Golden dragon a very small fish in the ocean of park street where much bigger fishes mark there presence. Located opposite two such big fishes mocambo n Tung fong this place have managed to survive well. Being in a lane next to my place made sure that I hv dropped in this place several times.
Ambience: Nothing fancy with dim light n a poor attempt at projecting real Chinese ambience.
Food: Noodles are good meifoon not good. Chicken average.pork above average.
Service: Piss poor n definitely needs a lot of improvement. The waiters are impolite. Service very slow.
Pricing: Its ur go to place if ur a little short on pocket money.
Overall an average place for very cheap but still better Chinese food.
P.S. Where do they find so much oil to pour over there noodles üçú

This place is really easy to spot. Located opposite to Mocambo, this is a small restaurant with very limited sitting. I had gone there with a friend on a weekday afternoon, and it was fully packed. Interiors are not fancy, yet not unattractive. We had ordered mixed Cantonese noodles, chicken wonton (fried) and pork mushroom. The noodles were a bit too oily, had generous quantities of prawns, chicken and pork. The wonton tasted fine and the pork mushroom wasn't bad either. Overall a decent place to eat. The prices aren't too high and they absolutely match the  quantitative and qualitative value of the food served. Looking forward to visit this restaurant again.

Chicken Drumstick: They served 8 pieces..it was nice,crisp,light and tasted good..
Szechwan Fish Dry: It was extremely spicy,loved the blend of chilli..fish was fresh..
Peiking Chicken: It consisted of shredded chicken strips..a red sauce with generous portions of chilli..tangy goes well with noodles or rice..
Golden Dragon Hakka Chow: It was pretty ordinary,a bit too oily,quantity was good..
Overall our total cheque comes to Rs.710/- for 2 of us..so definitely worth a visit..

Today around 1pm me n my two friends dropped in to have lunch. With all the exams n all since morning we didnt even have the time to have breakfast. Relying on the reviews here about their quick service we decided to have lunch here. Moreover it is known for its low prices.¬†¬† ¬† ¬†When we went in there were like 2 people in there, slowly the place started filling. Ambience is not very good in the ground floor, inspite of the beautiful interior. Tables are so close and people keep talking so loudly, its literally annoying. We ordered Szechuan chicken¬†hot garlic sauce, Chicken shrimp mei foon & Chicken hakka chow mein. And we waited...... and waited. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†It took them around 35mins to bring the plates , then another 10mins for the the food. At one point it became very fraustrating. service was really slow. Still we hoped the food would be good. ¬†Without sparing another word we dig into the food. quantity of noddles was huge and that of side dish was moderate. one pleate of noddles easily fills two hungry souls with fairly moderate appetite. ¬†We all enjoyed the noodles it was tasty but too oily. The chicken pieces of hot garlic sauce was over fried and thus lost all its juices, became hard and tasteless. gravy was nothing extraordinary, i expected it to be spicy but it was mild. then came the rice noodles (mei foon) again huge quantity with barely any chicken and few shrimps. it would have been good if it had atleast egg in it. would have improved the taste. ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† We were still eating while the waiter came and said if we are finished. they were like hell bent on driving us out as they got a few customers waiting. i think they have tables upstairs, they should have opened it to the customers waiting rather than chasing the present customers away. the bill came in within a few mins and we had to leave. This left a really bad impression. The food was not that incredible. they took around 21%tax.

The entrance leads to a dark room with dim lit lamps. Golden dragon is located right opposite the lane of tung fong and mocambo. Had gone there for lunch. The first floor was shut. So we had to wait until seats get vacant.

Ambiance:
Petiole chattering away, and the sound of cutlery fills in. The decor is very Chinese. Seats are stacked together so there's not much space to move around. Ideal for a cheap casual Chinese meal.

Food:
I expect Chinese cuisine in Calcutta to be good. This one lived up to it's expectation. The red pepper chicken is deliciously spicy. Szechuan fish is tasteful. The fish is fresh and soft. The chicken is tender. Their portions are pretty huge.

The mixed Hakka noodles and rice are very tasty. The price are huge. The quantity of prawn, chicken, veggies, etc is quite a lot.

To sip by the side there are fizzy drinks.

Service:
The service is super quick. The staff is just about okay. We had ordered noodles instead of rice but since they noted it down wrong, we asked to change it when it arrived. But we'll, they didn't.

This Chinese Resturant is right round the corner on the Free School Street crossing. Though the resturant gives you a very Western Texas Mafia den kinda feeling , with the dim lightings and dark staircases and all. The food is medium to good. The Chinese Chopsuey , I am not a fan of. The noodles are hard and when served they havn't even got the spread over it so as to make it soft. Irs very hard to the mouth. On a brighter side, the Pork Noodles is a delightful. Substantial amount per portion. Among side dishes , the Red Pepper Chicken stands out. Overall , this resturant is for those sudden urges for chinese food at the end of the month, when the pocket pinch is felt the hardest.

The first thing I noticed as soon as we walked in, this place is small. ¬†I mean 8-10 tables small. Each table with max 4 people, so, 40 max and if it fills up to the max, it wont be very comfortable inside.¬†
2 of us three, including me, are absolute pork lovers, so Chilly Roast Pork (gravy) made the list almost immediately. To go along, we had a plate each of mixed fried rice and mixed noodles, non veg off course. And from the chicken corner, we had¬†Chilly Garlic Pepper Chicken (dry) . Chilly roast pork is an all time favourite with scope of misfiring very limited, and as for the chicken, it had everything, chilly, garlic pepper, so we ordered it :)
The order took about 10 mins to arrive, the time spent taking photos of the space. The pork had a thick gravy, delicious. The noodles and rice had ample quantities of meat and egg bits, no complaints there, and the overall quantity was sufficient. The chicken, however, looked more delicious than it actually was. It could have been a bit more spicier, but, overall, it was fine.
Keeping in mind the price, the time to serve and quantity, the rating is a correct reflection.

If you are low on budget and want to settle for decent quality chinese food then this is the place to be. This is one of the cheapest resturants in park street. Space is small and ambience is average but it does make up for those with its food quantity and prices. This place is best for dinner after having drinks in any bar. Their rice, noodles and pork items are very good.

This is a pocket friendly place which sells excellent Chinese food with a variety of dishes to choose from, taking in consideration the pocket-friendliness.
It's a place catering more to the college and office crowd for a quick lunch or dinner and isn't exactly the ideal place for a lavish weekend  family dinner.
It's one of my favorite places to dine out. :)

One of the best Chinese cuisine I had till date was at Golden Dragon. The ambience lacks sophistication but its peaceful. The food is simply mind blowing. I visited Golden dragon with my friends and had garlic chicken, chicken Manchurian, chicken gravy noodles, chicken Hakka noodles and mixed fried rice. Gravy noodles and garlic chicken were simply a treat. Chicken manchurian was a bit spicy but good. 
Overall a great experience. Will definitely visit again.

Prices are pretty decent, no great pocket pinches, but the food is really nice. I'd recommend the chicken vegetable rice, pork wantons and shredded chicken in garlic sauce.¬†

Staff is nice and they give you their privacy. Definitely a comfort food place for me.

Saturday. Post movie. Heat. Long walk. Closed Blue poppy. Dejected. These were the circumstance that led us to visit this place. I am going to keep this brief. Food is of an average quality. Surely worth it if you are damn hungry as we were. The ambiance resembles more of a Chinatown eatery, rather than what you might expect to find at Park Street. Well give this a go if have less options available.

Golden dragon is an authentic Chinese restaurant located just opposite to mocambo park street. Ambiance is ¬†typical chinese type ¬†but not best .Quality and quantity of their food is just awesome and I would say that they served the best chinese. I ordered mixed hakka and chicken with garlic sauce and the taste was just awesome.The best part of this restaurant is the quality of noodles . I would love to visit this place again and again.

It was last Durga Puja. We planned to visit either Mocambo or Peter Cat but unfortunately we saw a never ending queue of people and that compelled us to change our plan and then we found this one just opposite to Mocambo. We were surprise to see half of the seats were empty and that created a doubt on my mind but we had no other option than to go for that only. We thought not to experiment and thus ordered Mixed Noodles, Szechuan Chicken and later my friend tried Chilly Roast Pork. The food was tasty but the service was pathetic. I was just thinking what would they do if the restaurant was full?

Golden Dragon have a Chinese feel once you enter here. Price is reasonable. Hospitality is good. Foods are served here with good quality and quantity. If you hop around different restaurants for different taste you won't be disappointed...

Went here today with two friends..Nice place with a Chinese ambience..taste of food is mediocre level and quantity served is less compared to that of other popular restaurants..they serve only 6pieces shredded chicken when it comes to side dish,so i felt that it is a bit over priced compared to the quantity served..service was slow,it took more than 40mins..

Before writing any review I prefer to go to that eatery at least twice and that too at an interval of at least a fortnight, as that allows me a peek into the consistency of foods served.
Golden Dragon has well passed the exam specially for its dry roasted chilly pork and Golden Dragon special mixed fried rice.
Also for my own satisfaction I ordered a EGG CHICKEN NOODLE WITHOUT VEGETABLES and it was in both the times at par with the 5 star foods that I have tasted across Globe.
However other items in menu like Fried Prawn and Chilli chicken or Red Pepper chicken , etc., were not at all upto the level of the foods mentioned above.
On an average its a very nice value for money coupled with one of the best locations in the city.

Sometimes it is not convenient to splurge on food (a) because your savings to spend on food is not enough or (b) there are other priorities. If you have either of these two reasons then hit the golden dragon restaurant to enjoy a hearty meal of Chinese cuisine at pocket-friendly rates. The quantity is also sumptuous making it easier to share not just the bill but also the food items! However, the lighting, AC and the overall decor is quite dull and shabby.

But if one can overlook that, the Golden dragon is the place to be when you are hungry but cannot spend more than few bucks!

P.S. I liked the noodles more than fried rice as I felt the rice quality was not upto the mark.

You get the best fried rice & chilli pork in here.. Absolute favourite since childhood i guess.Some real good fresh lime soda.. Basically this is like real chinese food and its budget friendly.. I also happen to love the gravy noodles here, If i crave for some chinese then this is the place I head to.

For people who has not visited Golden Dragon ever, the restaurant is located just opposite to Mocambo at Park street. A mediocre restaurant which gives you a Chinese feel once you enter. This not too small restaurant can be tried if you are running out of allowance and you are hungry. Vegetarians may not have a good time here according to me as the Veg dishes did not impress me & my vegetarian pals. But one can go for non veg delicacies like Chicken chopsuey, chicken or prawn fried rice,chicken wantons,garlic chicken or szechuan chicken. All of these taste good. The soups are not bad either. The hospitality is good. They serve you fast. If you feel like having chinese for a day but your pocket pinch is low, give Golden dragon a shot and you'll not be disappointed.

If you are looking for Chinese cuisine then I guess golden dragon is one of those! Its a small restaurant and decorated well giving a traditional Chinese effect! We ordered sweet and sour pork which was indeed tasty but I think the amount of pork they served was a bit less and chicken Mei foon which is rice noodles is yum! Overall the food, service and ambience satisfied me. So u may give it a try if you want to have Chinese:)

Ordered szechuan noodle, egg fried rice, hot garlic chicken & crispy baby corn in a gravy( 1 plate each). The noodle was really good it was nice & spicy, the correct amount. The fried rice was good too. ¬†Now lets come to the crispy baby corn which came as pleasant surprise as it was well coated & cooked, if someone wants to try veg in case u can go for it. It made 8 pieces in it. The chicken was not that hot as it was said. it also had 8 pieces. One plate of noodle & rice can be easily shared by 2 ppl. its cost 641 including the tax

This is one place I always end up going to just for their Thai soup, chilly pork roast and chicken meifoon..  I can't think of another place where I would even want to try these out.. But today I tried out the golden dragon special hakka chowmein and it was real good.. I can confidently say that all they're dishes are good and they're pricing is pretty decent for the park street area.. I make it point to visit them for Thai soup everytime I have an urge for something hot and spicey.. The red pepper chicken is something for people who loves spicey stuff..

It's the place where you can go when you are on low budget. The ambience is not that good.
Me and my friends visited the place last sunday. We were seven in number. We had ordered szechuan prawn balls, chicken with garlic sauce, chilli chicken, szechuan chicken, mixed fried rice, chicken fried rice, mixed hakka chow mein & sweet and sour wanton.
They were very swift in serving the foods. After having so many things, the bill was quite low.
Though the chicken with garlic sauce dish is very spicy, but I loved it. The prawn balls were very soft.
I will visit it again. Some improvements are needed.

If you are looking for ambience this is not the place. However, if you are looking for good Chinese food at reasonable prices then this place is perfect. They do not serve alcohol and the wait time is irritating. But when the food arrives its great. The soups, drums of heaven and meifoon is something you must try. Other food items are so so.

Had gone their on Christmas for dinner. Though Christmas we didnt had to wait their much. The ambiance is quite poor. Shabby. They had a proper menu but they didnt have some dishes due to Christmas. I was surprised to see the low price but as the food came we saw the starters to be of very small quantity. The main dishes were more in quantity and was tasty. Service was good. If you are unable to find any restaurant in park street for your dinner you can obviously go there.

Visited here yesterday after we saw a long queue in front of the blue poppy. Location is easily accessible.
Ambience- ordinary but clean. The place is bit small and the tables are close by.
Food- we ordered chicken and mushroom soup which was not at all spicy and suitable for my pallet. Then we ordered chicken in red pepper and garlic. It was tasty and spicy. Next we ordered golden dragon spcl fried rice and chilli roast pork. The rice was gd with lots of chicken, prawn and egg. The pork was nice but the gravy was a bit more.
Pocket pinch- it costs us around rs. 650. Considering the area and the quality and quantity price seems reasonable.
Recommended if you visit park street next time and have food at reasonable price.

Wanted to visit this place since a long time and finally got a chance on a weekday after some cumbersome shopping at new market. The place is a decent in terms of ambiance with small seating area.  
My friend and I were starving so without wasting much time we ordered 
Veg Manchow soup
Egg fried rice 
Mandarin fish. 

All the dishes were outstanding. This place reminded me of the Chinese food which I used to eat around 15 years back. Food was simple yet delicious. After tasting the food ambiance and decor didn't quite matter. Service was also quick and nice. Summing up a great place to try authentic consistent kolkata Chinese food.

Been to this place couple of days before......Its a nice place and Chinese is the theme..

Judging the decor i wouldn't say its awesome but its pretty good...There were Chinese carvings, lanterns and all the other decorations.....Also the ambiance was pretty good too. As the day was Sunday we barely got seats....Judging from the crowd i guessed people like it.

To tell about the food It was awesome. We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Chilli Pork, Red Chilli Pepper Chicken, Chrispy Chilli Baby Corn, Chilli Mushroom And one Veg Mushroom Clear Soup.....Taste was equally brilliant.......The only fault was the Service. It was like hell slow. and we had to remind them about the food couple of times.....Otherwise its a good place to eat.

Its one of those places where you can dine without burning a hole in your pocket.Aftr the closing of Peiping this restaurant has taken its place in my heart and my tongue for its great food at really affordable prices compared to the area its located in.Though I admit the ambiance can be better...coming to the food we ordered thai soup,roast chilli pork (dry),chicken and shrimp meifoon, red pepper chicken & soft drinks.The soup was tangy and warm & the meifoon was perfectly cooked.The chicken was on the hotter side but very warm to its soul with the right balnce of spices but the Chilli Roast Pork was HEAVENLY.Succulent pieces of pork with the right balance of fat teamed up with onions n chillies n spices and soy sauce is indeed a gastronomical delight and also the perfect combo of soft drinks to wash these down with.The service was a little slow but overall, this restaurant provides value for your money as well as pleasures your tastebuds.Satisfied :)

Located opposite Tung fung and Mocambo , this Chinese restro resembles the restros of Chinatown , but lacks finesse . They have 2 floors to accommodate . The ambience is good for peaceful dining with dim lights to set the mood . We tried the GOLDEN DRAGON MIXED SOUP , PRAWN SOUP , CHICKEN DRUMSTICKS, CRISPY BABYCORN for starters. The baby corn was not at all baby , but they were cooked perfectly. In the maincourse , we had GOLDEN DRAGON SPEACIAL MIXED FRIED RICE, MIXED MEIFOON , HUNAN CHICKEN and SHREDDED CHICKEN . Food was moderate and costed us Rs 300 per head

I recently visited there with my friends after finishing our exams. I liked d ambience of d place as it was quiet with dim lights hanging around. We ordered chicken drumsticks and garlic chicken for starters both of which was good. Although i thought it wud have been better if d drumsticks were coated in some sauce. Anyways we quite liked it. D schezwan fried rice over der striked d best balance for me as it was neither too spicy nor too mild. D meifoon over der still needs some modifications since d place is pure chinese. D singapore chicken was piping hot and it went dwn well with d main course. even d prawns were juicy and suited well with d garlic sauce. d quantity was right given d prices. D veg babycorn starter was gud bt d side dish was bland. even d servicing cud have been a bit better. overall, a good experience...

This is located in Park Street amongst the best restaurants in Kolkata. The interior is shabby compared to its neighbours. A very small place with very few people to attend. The walls are covered with reflection on the mirrors that hang. :). They serve pork, so people who likes pork can definitely try there. This place serves no alcohol. The food is good. We tried soup, which was good and well prepared. The rice noodles really tasted good. I did not like the chilli chicken, it was like, chicken dipped in soya sauce and it tasted dull. :(
I found it bit costly. A descent place to try with families, specially when there is no room for you and your companion/s in one of those Park Street restaurants.

Decor-ed in traditional Chinese, this place was a pleasant surprise for me. I specially liked the shallow lighting. We went there around about midday for lunch and got ourselves the Chicken Drumstick for starters, and Chicken and Shrimp Fried Rice with Chicken Hot Garlic Sauce for the mains along with two bottles of Pepsi.¬†

The drumsticks, 8 generous pieces, were crunchy, juicy and delicious. The main course did take some time to arrive, but we didn't mind as the drumsticks were quite filling. The quantity of the Fried Rice was more than sufficient for the two of us. Filled with loads of chicken and shrimp, it was good as well. The Chicken Hot Garlic was mildly spicy without being overwhelming.

The ambiance was quite homely and the servers are polite. A great place that gives good value for money...

This small Chinese restaurant is probably the missing piece in the park street food Lego. It may not offer you fine dining, but it will fit your budget. It will not give you the sophistication that comes to your mind when you hear the location, but it will definitely keep you happy with the quality of food it serves. Situated exactly opposite Mocambo, you are likely to find this small place full more often than not. The place itself is nothing fancy, okayish lit with some Chinese lamps hanging here and there. There is no ambiance whatsoever and if you're looking for that, there are plenty other places in the neighborhood. Here you are to gorge on food, nothing else. 

We ordered two bowls of roasted chilli pork, one plate of red pepper chicken, two plates of golden dragon special noodles, one plate of fried rice, also special. The waiters are attentive, and even with a full house, the food was on our table within ten minutes. It was piping hot, and we loved every bite of it. The noodles is nice. Less oily, which is to my liking, and subtle in taste. The rice was average in taste, but it went fabulously with the heat of both the meat dishes. The red pepper chicken had a generous amount of ground bell pepper, and tastefully hot. But the standout was the roast chilli pork. The meat was tender, with right amount of succulent fat, just the way I like it. It was so good that we ended up ordering a second helping. A must try if you love good pork. A bill of a thousand bucks arrived at the table, and we were more than happy to pay. 

So there you have it. A restaurant at the heart of park street that serves good food and suits your budget at the same time. Sounds like a bargain, doesn't it?

Honestly if i wrote a review a year ago i would probably have given Golden Dragon a 5. However over the last year ive seen the place steadily disintegrate. Though they have tried to make some changes in terms of decor , overall the place is extremely unhygienic and simply swarming with rats and cockroaches.¬†

The food was extremely lovely I have not been able to step into the place since my friend and i got a LIVE COCKROACH in her plate ! Golden Dragon is extremely conveniently located , affordable and the family that runs it is absolutely adorable , I wish they would pay some attention to cleanliness.

First of all the name should be changed to Bronze Dragon,because I feel it isn't living up to its name.
It was my friend's treat,and we had originally planned on Tung Fong,but seats weren't available, and same was with the other famous restaurants in Park Street,so we decided to go here as we were really hungry.
We ordered 4 fresh lime sodas and 4 Cokes along with 2 plates of Chicken drumsticks as starters. 3 plates of Mixed Fried Rice,2 plates of Mixed Noodles,1 Mixed Pan Fried Noodles,1 dry chilli roast pork,1 plate of prawn balls,1 hot garlic chicken as the main course.
The Beverages arrived 10 mins later,and the Chicken drumsticks half an hour later. This was horribly annoying,but we wouldn't have minded if the drumsticks were tasty. But it failed to impress,and was very average.
The wait for the main course was the test of our patience,and we had to go and speak to the owner twice as the waiters were just annoying us even further by giving us false assurance.
So after speaking to the owner twice,our food arrived 1hr10mins after our order. The place was quite small,yet,wasn't even full,so they couldn't blame it on the no. of customers to be taken care of.
The food again was a let down with the portions being very little.
The pork was good,but very little,and the pan fried noodles were good too. All the other items were very very avg. And I've had better at local take aways.
The service was very slow and the food very avg. in all,and I don't think I'll ever be visiting this place again. We should've rather waited for Tung Fong that day.I feel we would've been much more satisfied with much lesser wait.
Regret the decision.

Imagine one of those suave tiny Chinese joints James Bond would probably visit in hiding when he is on a mission to calcutta. That's exactly how Golden dragon looks. 
Five Chinese at amazingly reasonable rates is what this restaurant offers. The pan fried chow which is not listed on their menu card is something you should try out. Happy dining.

I was with my family and so we ordered many items and didn't stop until we were full. The quantity per plate was great. About quality I would just mention one thing that the prawn was smelly. Otherwise the chicken and the vegetables were fresh enough.
It is a quite spacious restaurant having accommodation at upstairs as well. For a family outing I can suggest this place without any hesitation. But yes, their service is a bit slow. I hope they will recover it soon. Best of luck for golden dragon !

Price: Too much pocket friendly.

Food: Ordered sweet and sour soup, Mixed fried rice and chilly garlic shredded chicken.Everything was tasted good.Quantity is really good for two.

Bottom Line: This might be very simple restaurant, but the food is yummy.I will recommend this place at least to try once.

Went back after 2 years hoping for a change at the insistence of my daughter. Nothing, it‚Äôs all the same, wait of 40 minutes after the soup and starters. Fried prawn/ chicken, garlic chicken, sweet and sour chicken had an unearthly chemical crimson red hue. Prices racked up, so it‚Äôs no more of a cheap/good Chinese food joint. The worst part ‚Äì the owners sitting near the entrance with the waiters keeping on piling food on the table, them stuffing their faces with food while the customers‚Äô stomachs are cramping for want of food. Simply not done!! Never going back!!! When asked was cited lack of adequate staff. Wish the old man who used to sit at the counter long back was there.

The Chinese lanterns and the decor was really good. Food as I said was totally worth the price. I've been here twice, but have never been disappointed. I'd definitely recommend this place for my followers. Don't think too much. You won't regret it.

Golden Dragon might not present itself as one the elite restaurants on the park street stretch, but the food it has to offer can give any other Chinese cuisine restaurant in it's ¬†category a run for ¬†their money. The food is brilliant absolutely brilliant and has a very authentic taste.Since dinning out is about the complete experience and not just the food, it has to be mentioned that the decor of the place is beautiful and it offers a very friendly service. Personally i have been to Golden Dragon on multiple occasions, and it is highly recommended. Also, it is very economical. So that earns them extra cookie points.

The ambience is pretty good , I really liked American Chopsuey and even Lemon Chicken. It's@ a nice place to hangout with friends thats for sure. Chicken Wanton is crunchy and tasty also. Mixed Fried Rice was not so great but the Hot Garlic Chicken was yummy.

Heard a lot about this place so finally decided to visit. After watching a good movie and getting drenched in the heavy rain, decided to have a good lunch so went to this place. We were irritated by the weather so didnt order much. WE ordered schezuan chicken noodles and lemon chicken. Service was quick and ambience was satisfactory ( nothing great). Though had ¬†heard great things about this place, the food was not-so-great . The lemon chicken was very ok, not at all mouth watering, the noodles was still better than the chicken.
On the whole, if you are looking for cheap chinese food..then do visit..otherwise u can give it a miss :)

One of the very few restaurants serving great Chinese food yet very much pocket friendly.Food taste and quantity is really great, ambiance is good with soft lighting.You must try their Fish dishes.
Cons
1. Serving is a bit slow.So expect to wait for 15-20 mins on regular day. It takes more time if you are sitting upstairs.But no complain towards the food.
2. They serve entire order all together ( happened to me in last 2 visits).¬† So Main course can get cold once you finish starter.Tell server to adjust the timing.

Overall a good place to have great Chinese without a hole in your pocket.

Truely one of the best chinese restaurant in and around central Kolkata which offers a clean environment , dim lights to give you a cosy experience and chinese decorations as well as chandeliers all around the corners of the restaurant.
Now lets talk about the quantity of the food , which is just right for individuals and the quality is just very impressive as the food is presentable and delicious ,so thid restaurant definetly rules .

As a student, this place certainly is the go-to-place. Not only is it wallet-friendly but the food here is equally delightful. Probably one of the best Chinese restaurant's I've been to.¬†Interiors are dim light with the familiar Chinese lanterns. Nothing fancy or grand. Simple yet serene. Sets the perfect mood.The Chilli Pork is a MUST here.¬†Only con would be service during busy hours. It gets disappointing at times but still this place is worth all your penny! Enjoy.

Ummm, I find it hard to write unhappy reviews. There are three reasons why I wouldn't go to this place again. One, every single one of the three dishes we ordered was colored in the absolutely identical crimson colored 'chemically' sauce. Two, the vegetables in the noodles tasted distinctly stale, and I have some unvoiced suspicions about the freshness of the chicken too. And three, the servers ignored my repeated requests to turn off the massive table fan that was making me feel cold and miserable. Let me end with the things that I did like about the place. Both the decor and the prices belong to the last century, which is kind of charming.

I went there with a friend recently, we had the garlic chicken noodles with chicken in garlic pepoer sauce and chilli pork. The dishes were ample in quantity and the taste was amazing.

As you step inside, you definitely must think as if you have come to Chinatown. The receptionist ,the Waiter everyone here resembles Mongoloid.
The sitting is not that spacious, with a max of 4 tables, the lamps have Chinese  paintings on it,
 
The service here is good, and the waiters are polite and attentive, but I have complaints regarding the plates,it should be cleaner. Hygiene should be given priority.

We ordered  Dragon noodles and chicken drumstick. 
Drumsticks were served first , and it looked very dry on the surface,the taste was good, and the size of drumstick was just good enough, almost 11 pieces, but they didn't serve any sauce. Then come the noodles, the quantity was just ok,not very much for a single foodie like me,with high appetite, taste is nothing to be boast of.
Even the salty fresh lime soda isn't worth mentioning.
All in all I expected a better food,seeing the reviews,but was disappointed. The only positive point is the Chinatown ambience. Room for improvement

If u love authentic spicy Chinese food then this is the restaurant you must visit. Located just opposite of Mocambo. It's a very small joint but the taste they provide in their food is just awesome. We ordered kum pao chicken , red pepper fish, golden dragon special fried rice and sechuan chicken. The food was too spicy and tasty. And one more thing they serve pomfet fish for red pepper fish. Prices are reasonable considering the place. Best wishes.

The food was pretty well prepared. The chicken was a bit spicy, but isn't that how "Indian Chinese" should be :P 

The portions are huge....Unlike some other, more upmarket, places you will not leave wishing for a few morsel more.



Overall a great deal...provides an excellent bang for your buck!

Thai soup.. Golden dragon special cantonese noodles and Roast chili pork... Other items worth mentioning are the Chicken drumsticks, Golden fried prawns,Kung pao chicken and Veg garlic rice.

For most foodies and Chinese lovers in the Park Street area, Golden Dragon is name synonymous to good food and value for money. Since it is a stone's throw from my office, I visit this place often. It is one of the best Chinese joints in the area, and delivers on quality food that is tasty at the same time. Try out the Chicken chow chow rice and roasted chilly pork, which is one of my regulars. They taste mind blowing. The french mushroom egg drop soup tastes good too.

Located just opposite renowned names like Mocambo n Tung fong, this is one of the most reasonable restaurants in park street. The quality and quantity easily suffices ur appetite and suits ur pocket equally. I went with 4 more of my friends for my birthday treat which i was supposed to share with another friend. We ordered pork chilli roast, dry n gravy, spl.fried rice n chowmein n singapore chicken. Towards the end we all were literally full upto d brim, tje bill came n it was just arounf 1100 bucks. That means 550 each came to our shares. I just love this place....have been there more than 3-4 times. Suggested to all.

One of the more affordable restaurants on Park Street, opposite imposing names like Mocambo and TungFong... This little restuarant isn't much to look at. Dimly lit with Chinese lanterns and mirrored walls, it's old and familiar and sturdy! We used to love eating there as a family. 

Visited last week and had the chicken manchurian,  hakka chowmein and golden dragon special chow... loved every morsel!! Was so happy especially sine last year when I ate here 'salt' was lacking. Good going Golden Dragon, I'm coming back for your pork fried rice.

After seeing the rating 3.9 out of 5 I decided to visit this place and what a let down it was !!! The restaurants interior is quite small while the waiters are least interested to serve.
 The special golden dragon fried rice was literally inedible as the quality of rice itself was bad and to top it up the prawns in it were not deveined and not even cooked...
The chicken drumsticks were so so.
The chilly roast pork and fried chicken wantons were good but to my surprise they don't serve wanton with its sauce...
The only reason a rating of 3 can be given is due its sauce missing wantons and the price..Though seriously would advice to go to restaurants like Tung Fong or Bar-B-Q instead ...

Have you ever wondered how it will feel if you were thrown into one of those Bruce Lee movies or the Jackie Chan movies? The movies where the men with power and money gamble and smoke and look creepily  mysterious but oh so enticing under the red light. Upon entering this place I almost had that thrill, the Chinese lanterns, the dim light and the wooden furniture and I could smell mystery from the entrance. 
The place is small which remains occupied most of the time given the quality food they serve at such affordable price and that too in a place like Park Street. My friend told that the restaurant is one of the few which is run by a Chinese Family. 
The food to say the least was good. We were a group of eight and went for the popular ones in the menu, nothing fancy. Red Pepper Chicken, Chicken Drum Stick as starter, mixed fried rice, Hunan Chicken, American Chop Suey. 
The red pepper chicken was savory and the heat strikes at the right places. If you are on the sweeter side, avoid this. The Chicken drumsticks were good but not the best.  
The Chop Seuy was good with generous portion of sauce and veggies. The Hunan Chicken was sweet and sour and made a perfect match with the mixed fried rice. The rice itself had generous amount of shrimp and chicken. 
The food experience was good given the smiling bill that came as the climax to the experience. Nothing makes you content if both the stomach and pocket is happy.  The staff is helpful and cooperating as we as a group of eight created quite a commotion there. 
If you are in this area and officially broke. Then Golden Dragon is your savior.

Was too much hungry and found this small eatery beside all big ones and got in to explore.
Its a very small place,not much accommodation, yet the ambiance is very soothing ..
Chinese my all time favorite to fill my stomach is Mixed Hakka noodles and any chicken platter. ( I guess we had Chicken Manchurian.. plain and simple) yet very nice in taste.
Anyway, the budget is also affordable. So Enjoy !

Golden Dragon is one of those places which you would probably be more likely to find at say Tangra China Town rather than Park street.It lacks the sophistication associated with most places at Park street but it does have its fair share of advantages.
I had visited this place on a Sunday afternoon with a couple of friends.It was absolutely full like most Park street restaurants.After a wait of about 10-15mins we got ourselves a table.The ambience has nothing to boast of.It is typical of a smallish Chinese restaurant.The space is on the lesser side.There are two levels,the upper one is used only during the peak hours.
Coming to the food on offer,we ordered a French Mushroom chicken soup,Golden Dragon special Chowmein,mixed fried rice,chili roast pork and a chicken with mushrooms.The food was served quite swiftly.The soup was decent and nothing special.The quantity was a little less we felt.The Special chowmein with generous amounts of chicken prawn and veggies was something that I quite liked albeit a tad too bland according to one of my friends.The Mixed fried rice was a bit of a disappointment.It was very very ordinary.The chili roast pork was well made and quite adequately hot.I had expected it to be a little drier than the amount of gravy it actually had.The chicken with mushroom was okay.
In short the food though not brilliant was quite good specially considering the prices.The prices are very very reasonable.They are an absolute bargain compared to Park street standards.But yes the food is good but not brilliant.Also the ambience is not much to speak of.The service though decent,the cleanliness could be and probably needs a little bit of improvement.
Overall this is a decent budget restaurant in Park street.For me it adds variety to the already many options in Park street.It can be looked upon as China Town Tangra in Park street(without the alcohol though!!Yes this place does not serve liquor).

Located in midst of sharks of big restaurants like Peter Cat, Bar-B-Q n all, this restaurant is serving a very pocket friendly Chinese cuisine. Ambiance is its not strong point, but the food quality and quantity at a very reasonable price makes it a place for frequent visit.  Mostly crowded during lunch hour with ppl from near by offices. I went there with friends and we ordered mixed fried price with chilly chicken and pork mushroom. They took quite some time to serve. Bottle-neck of this place is the waiter, only one waiter and its really hard for a single person to serve everyone's demand and running up and down.
Food quality is good and so is the quantity. This place is nice getaway when you want to grab a bite in the busiest afternoon time and also don't want to end up paying too much.

Hands down the BEST chinese restaurant in Kolkata. Owned and run by a Chinese family, this is a quaint little place opposite Mocambo. Done up with hues of read and chinese dragons the ambiance is old world China Town. The food is exceptional. The best VEG Manchirian you will ever eat! Lovely and soft fried rice and their soups are out of the world. Iv been eating here since  a child and my dad since the early '80's and it just gets better.
Recommended items: Sweet Corn Chicken Soup, Wanton Soup, All Fried Rice dishes, Hunan Chicken, Prawn in hot garlic. Chicken drumsticks(starters).
Way too easy on the pocket in comparison to all the big boys on Park street. Each time I'm very satisfied.

This was my first visit to this restaurant... at first the place looked quite shabby... we went upstairs... lookwise this place may not tempt you but pricewise it has a magical power within it... being located on park street it is really pocket friendly... food is good.. I am not that appreciative about the quality but pricewise it has satisfied me definitely... we ordered for veg hakka noodles,mixed rice,chicken with babycorn and vegetables,red pepper chicken,chicken manchurian... although I am disappointed about their service... we went tired on calling the waiter... I dont know why does this place keep only one waiter to attend so many customers over there... they should seriously think over this issue... I went with my old friends.. so their company made my visit worthy.

We went in there after an exam. The ambience is nothin to boast of. 
The choice of vegetarians dishes ain't much as well. 
Hesitant and not willing to take any chances, we played extremely safe and ordered chilli garlic noodles with veg manchurian. 
The manchurian balls were soft and tasted really good but was extremely spicy.. And to add on to it the noodles were spicy too!
The waiters were not much interested and were just doing their job halfheartedly. 
Anyway, I can say it's an ideal place to go to when one is running low on budget.

I went there after hearing a lot of raving critics and was a tad disappointed.The place can be best called average.
The ambience is okayish...a basic soulless air-conditioned small room,a bit cramped.I had expected some degree of creativity since the family running it is chinese. I ordered a soup,mixed noodles and roast chilli pork. The food was pretty decent and in quantities just sufficient for 2 of us.The roasted chilli pork was excellently prepared,though the others were nothing special.
I suppose it could be said that location wise,the restaurant is exceptional about its price.But all in all,a rather dull place.Not bad,just dull.

This little restaurant off the Park Street is good if you want value for money. The rates are pretty reasonable keeping the fact in mind that the place is situated in Park Street where most of the resaturants charge exhorbitantly. The food is fresh , good and tasty with the serving size being sufficient. The decor sure needs a facelift. Unfortunately, when we visited on a hot Wednesday afternoon, the AC's were not working properly (one of the two was out of order) making it quite uncomfortable. The service staff is okay (cant say good because they are unable to suggest the right accompaniments with the main course).
A must visit for people who like good chinese food without any frills and without burning a hole in their pocket.

As dingy as this place may be, their food is awesome! I had to ask around and find my way to this place as I forgot its name and had last been here a few years ago but I was certainly not disappointed. The prices are extremely reasonable and quantities very decent. I had the mixed hakka chow mein which consisted of prawn and pork and was exactly what I could ask for. I also had the chilly roast pork which was tender and flavorful and perfect to go with the hakka noodles. And as a lot of other reviewers may have said, the little Chinese kid is definitely an attraction. When I last went a few years ago there was a little Chinese baby girl who was equally cute. What amazed me more was that these kids speak fluent hindi :)

If you're looking for a reasonable, no frills place with tasty chinese food, Golden dragon is the place to try!

Never have I tasted such bland and tasteless food.I felt I was eating at someone's place where I have been not been invited.We ordered "special" fried rice which took so long to come that we had almost lost our appetite and when it finally came the staff did seemed to lack the common sense to bring along the side dishes.The special friend rice looked anything but special.It tasted like some amateur cook has made it for the first time.Now the chilly roast pork came and we found tiny amount of pork dominated by onions and chillies.The gravy was so salty that we turned our attention to the remaining dish, the szechuan chicken.Now the szechuan chicken is supposed to be spicy , but this one was not only flavourless but also bore the appearance of chickens swimming in orange tasteless gravy.The lime soda which I needed to wash down the food was okay but when I touched the glass it was sticky.The experience was very unpleasant and the only saving grace that day was the ice cream we had from cream and fudge!

Situated amidst d buzz of chains of restaurants, Golden Dragon is a Class in itself.
With no exquisite interiors or jazzy music at your disposal, the place is more of a tradition to witness
As i entered the place with my 3 friends i was politely seated to the second next table to the counter
With a pretty limited space the arrangement is amazing
The reason it earns stars from almost individual is because of it exceptional blending of food which drives me back to the traditional times.
To sum up i shall rate it in the following areas
Interiors-2.5/5
Hospitality-3.5/5
Ambience-4/5
Food- 4.5/5
The have loads of positives n negatives to check into 
Pros: 
1. Special taste(Just as needed)
2. Good management
3. Good location 
4. Surely budget friendly

Cons:
1.  Space crunch
2. Lack of experienced personnel 
3. Not all varieties a hit

A must try if u want to experience indian blended Chinese at one of its best! 
Dont think! Try it! :)

Golden Dragon was the last place I went before my board exams started. And it left a wonderful impact. It's nothing very high standard if you're looking for that sort of thing. It's a nice warm place and has good service. Best part is that their food is great. We ordered Peking Chicken, Golden Dragon Special Fried Rice, Chicken Szechuan Noodles and Red Pepper Chicken. This last item was admirably cooked, with a hint of spice that doesn't actually set your mouth on fire. Everything was well cooked and had the distinct Chinese flavour we crave and love. Not much variety and the quantity is a wee bit less than in most other Chinese joints. But you know? Good food, great prices, quick service. Enough for a lazy Saturday night out with friends.

We had heard that this Golden Dragon restaurant is run by a Chinese family and had gone for lunch with expectations of authentic Chinese food. On the plus side, the prices are reasonable and pork dishes are available (most Chinese restaurants in Kolkata do Not have pork items on their menus). However, the food in general was nothing special and at best "average".

Since I and my family were just there for a day in Park Street, I thought we would catch some good Chinese food at the Golden Dragon which is one of the older popular places in the area. Initially, we were hoping it was not closed as most of the places on Park Street remain closed on Sundays.  So we were delightfully happy that it was open.

The place was smaller than I had imagined. Tables were pretty close to each other, but I suppose people in Kolkata don't mind that. Still the service was fast and the waiters were always available and quick to serve. We began by ordering the sweet corn chicken soup which was thick, creamy and quite filling really. Though we divided it in two portions it seemed quite enough. For the main course we ordered chicken fried rice, chicken hakka chow mein, chilli chicken boneless and sweet and sour prawn ( as people told me don't forget to try prawn items at the place). The food was simply awesome. The quantity was also quite large that we had to take away some of the stuff. Of course to be enjoyed later while replaying golden dragon yummy flashbacks. A very good and budget restaurant for just anybody who likes authentic Chinese food.

So what do you do when you find yourself at Park Street and the prospect of so much food around you gets your appetite up and running but you do not have much money on you? You walk into Golden Dragon and order some pork. 

This is a tiny restaurant squeezed into one nook on the street among various other eating places in the area. What makes it stand out is its reasonable pricing and its loyalty to Chinese food.The Manchow soup stands out as my favourite although it probably won't be to the taste of those who like their soup light. If you love fish and Chinese food, this is the place to.It is also one of the few places  in the city that serves a decent chopsuey. 

Golden Dragon has relatively more options for vegetarians as well. I like the chili roast pork and the crispy chili baby corn just as much. Everything is decently proportioned and promptly served. 

Although the ground floor is quite crunched for space, the first floor has ample tables for big groups to be seated in. Especially good if you have to treat large groups of people and/or are about to order a lot of food and don't want to feel your pocket get pinched.

I have been frequenting golden dragon since the last four years now. I discovered it when i was in college and ever since then,  it became a patent place for me and my friends to hang out. The Manchow soup is great. It's a thick soup with cubes of chicken dipped in a broth of egg white. Also the dry schezwan fish will make you drool, especially if you are a fan of spicy food. The red pepper chicken is great too. All the items are decently priced and the quantity is satisfying. However, if you are looking for great interiors and soothing music and an exotic lunch or dinner, then golden dragon will not meet your expectations.

Golden Dragon is a nice place to grab a quick bite. The food here is good and nothing extraordinary. But definitely won't burn a hole in your pocket and would fill your tummy. The American chop suey was a let down but the noodles and the sweet n sour chicken is worth appreciating. Overall it's a good place to have a sumptuous Chinese meal.

Now for some reason unknown to me "The Blue Poppy" restaurant in russell street was closed last Sunday (30/03/2014) and I wanted to have chinese for dinner so I decided to give this restaurant a try once again (this being my 2nd visit). Located just opposite to Mocambo tucked between Subway and Wonderland Toys this place is hard to miss. When we entered it was almost full but luckily we got a table, the interiors have been kept simple nothing fancy and the lights too are quite dim but that's fine with me because I am a person who is more interested in the food than the decor. So coming to the point we ordered 1 chicken hot and sour soup, 1 chicken & prawn fried rice, fish in hot garlic sauce and since they don't serve liquor we had to stay sober with the good old fresh lime soda. Now there was nothing exceptional about the fried rice however the soup with enough chicken & mushroom pieces tasted good and the fish didn't disappoint either, have to mention the quantity served was also enough for 2. The service was also very good they were fast and polite and when your dinner bill comes to just Rs.484 you tell yourself that it was money well spent.

I am a big fan of Chinese food, though ajinomoto allergy often prevents me from enjoying it as much as I would like. Golden Dragon was the venue of choice for 20 of us at a recent gathering. The place is admittedly a bit cramped and definitely very poorly lit, but we'd booked the upper floor for ourselves, so we got some privacy. We ordered chicken fried rice, chicken chowmein, chopsuey and chilli pork. I tried all the items except the chopsuey. I had already eaten earlier (owing to my allergy concerns) so I didn't have a full meal here, but I have to say that overall it was pretty average. The fried rice was decent fare, nothing unusual. The noodles were very bland and didn't have enough chicken or vegetables in it. The pork tasted nice, but was a bit on the rubbery side and had rather too much soy sauce. I don't think I could have had an enjoyable sinner here - I'm glad I ate elsewhere. Granted, the portions are generous (one plate of rice can serve about 3-4 people) but the quality needs to be upped. 
Final verdict - very much average.

It was the best gravy chowmin I ever had. The garlic chicken was also pretty good. The best part was when we saw the bill charging 287 rupees only!  Simply I loved everything about this restaurant. Its a must visit place food lovers.

The service was prompt and polite.The food served here is authentic Chinese.We had ordered Red pepper chicken and vegetable Cantonese chowmin.Though the chicken wasn't that good but cantonese chowmin was above our expectation. Moreover it doesn't even pinch your pocket.

Compared to other places in Park Street, this one is very pocket friendly yet tempting. Visited there for 5 to 6 times. Each time tried to try something new, surprisingly they never let us down.
Few of the items worth mentioning are : Kung Pao Chicken (dry), Diced Chicken, Hunan Chicken, Peking Chicken, Shreded chicken with hot garlic sauce (It is simply awesome and spicy), Golden Dragon special fried rice, chicken shrimp fried rice, Chicken and prawn hakka chowmein. All of them are scrumptious, appetizing and comes with good quantity.  Another item worth mentioning is Chilli Roast Pork. It is simply fabulous over here.
I have also tried Lime chicken garlic, but I didn't liked it very much, the lime part was little bit over done.
the service needs to improve a little bit.
Otherwise it is a very good place for a hangout.
P.S. Dont miss the awesomely cute Chubby chinese kid of the owner. He is simply a treat for your eye :) Every time I visit there, i just wait for him to visit the restaurant. :)

Ever had a fetish for having pork ? If yes, then just rush into Golden Dragon !
One of the most frequently visited restaurant for me. The place is well decorated and dim lights ll give you and hallucinating effect, but i dnt find first floor catchy enough. The Chinese menu has got a huge variety, you can easily explore new items. Service is extremely good.
The most common order from ours end is
1. Golden Dragon spcl Fried Rice
2. Chilli Roast Pork(dry)
3. Pork Mushroom
4. Red Pepper Chicken 
Each item tastes awesome..but Chilli Roast Pork is undoubtedly the best. The best quality pork served here with the best possible taste. Each time we visit here , we tend to reorder for roast pork.
Pork Mushroom is another must-try item here. Served with a very smooth gravy and fresh mushrooms all over, the pork gather a different taste all together.
The quality of the food is just too good, very well cooked with all required spices. They served food in no times with ample quantity.
And above all this is the most pocket friendly restaurant in Park Street area  with high quality food. Cost for 4 with sufficient food will be around 1000 . Best place to give your birthday treat :)
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to all.

Few days back, there came a very cold, windy afternoon and to my respite, the last day of my dreadful exams. To celebrate the cause, we were out in Park Street in search for Golden Dragon, hoping for a healing Chinese meal. We found it as well, tucked between the Subway and Wonderland Toys on the ground floor of Park Mansion (bang opposite of Mocambo).
The place was small and instantly conveyed a cosy vibe. Since the ground floor section was completely filled, we got a table on the first floor. The whole room was washed over warmly by the reddish yellow dim lights coming from the mouth of cute little golden dragons.
 
We got seated and ordered for the Pork Chowmein (hakka) and Red Pepper Chicken (dry). The food took its normal time to reach our table, all hot and heaped up on the plates. The plate of chowmein easily served us both and so did the bowl of chicken containing 8 pieces.
The chowmein was a complete healer with the strips of boiled pork, julienne of cabbage, carrots, scallions and its satisfying taste. The red pepper chicken had pieces of reddish chicken with lots of black pepper on it. I'd expected to see some bell peppers or chillies, but it had none. Nevertheless, it was spicy like it should be and tasted quite amazing! The thing which we loved most was the soft and juicy texture of the meat and that it came without any outer coating. 
Initially we'd thought of ordering starters but midway through the meal, we decided against it because our once hungry tummies were almost completely filled. Whatever space was left inside got filled with ice creams later on, from a parlour outside! :P 
Overall, this place pleased us with its good food, cordial service and reasonable pricing! 
 
P.S: We caught a glimpse of this OH-SO-CUTE-AND-CHUBBY Chinese baby (the owner's I assume), making the rounds on a staff's lap like the perfect host!
And that is how we conquered the cold that day. :)

Went during the Christmas time to Park Street and had seen reviews and rating about this place so thought of trying it. This place changed my view about Pork Dishes. Tried the Chilli pork here and was totally mesmerized. At first me and my friend ordered for one dish of Pork one Schezwan chicken and Fried Rice. But the taste of the chilli pork forced us to order one more dish of Pork. 
Overall 3.5/5 for service and 4.5/5 for food

atlast  i  was  able  to visit  golden  dragon & to  be honest it is quite  a small place , but reasonably well done .  best part what i liked was that it was a family joint &  frequented  by both young & old alike . coming to food , we had ordered 2 thai soup (  rs 90 / bowl ) , 1 chilli fish dry & 1 szechwan fish dry ( rs 140 / plate each ) & in main course we had  1 plate of sweet *& sour BAGDA   prawn ( rs 285  ) & 1 plate of prawn fried  rice  (  rs 120 )  & the bill including vat & service tax came at around rs   1-000  only , which was the best part . the service here is quite prompt &  the  QUANTITY  quite generous , however i  would like  to  mention that the QUALITY is    nothing amazing , so don't expect exotic quality here .  Thai soup was very well done so were  the fish items  , but the rice was a big  let down , so i would suggest one to have cantonese gravy noodles , instead of rice . i would  have given it a 5 on 5 but for the QUALITY of rice . overall a very good experience , so guys if you are on a budget in parkstreet you better  head directly to golden dragon   :)

This year birthday party turned out to be a trip to old charm China. The place is very easy to locate and on entering the place, it feels like that we have traveled back in time. The decore has a old age chinese charm. The management and serving boys are very well behaved and make you feel like home. 
Coming to the food. The quantity was huge compare to the price. I went with my four friends and had almost everything on the menu from Fried Wanton to Chilli Pork. Every dish had its own identity and taste. My reccomedation to people planning to visit the place is---'PORK RECEIPES ARE OUT OF THE WORLD AND A  MUST TRY'.

We were in the Park street area yesterday and looking for a place to have lunch when I remembered this place, having eaten here around 2 years ago. My friend was a bit sceptical, asking why we should visit this place considering the big names just opposite to this relatively small place (read: Mocambo and Tung Fong). But once inside, we were pleasantly surprised by the dim lighting and warm interiors. Decor is traditionally Chinese with dragon motifs all around. Coming to the important part....the Food ! We ordered the Chicken Drumstick for starters, and Chicken and Shrimp Fried Rice with Chicken Hot Garlic Sauce for the mains along with two bottles of Pepsi. 

The starters arrived in a while....we were served 8 big pieces of drumstick which were quite yummy. Crunchy and juicy at the same time, they were filling as well ! The main course did take a while to arrive, but we didn't mind it much. The quantity of the Fried Rice was really good.....it was more than sufficient for the two of us. Filled with loads of chicken and shrimp, it was tasty as well. The Chicken Hot Garlic was mildly spicy without being overwhelmingly so. It consist of diced chicken pieces and made a really good combination with the Fried Rice. I must say, I love it when the quantity of dishes are good and not tiny portions....the only drawback being that we were too full to try out any of the other dishes ! :)  

The ambience felt very homely  and the servers are polite. All in all, a great place that gives good value for money. My friend was surprised at the bill being just over 500/- for two, considering we were in Park Street. Moral of the story: good food need not always come at a huge price ! And yes, for desserts do not miss the Donut Baker outlet just next door....but then, that's another review. 4 stars for Golden Dragon ! :)

I was out with my friend I and S, and the two decided to have the Golden Dragon Special Soup and pork so off we went. On a Sunday evening around 9, the place was not too full, and we were so glad of that, it wasn't funny. We were left waiting for 10 minutes or so before the nice guy who was sitting behind the cash counter opened up the floor upstairs and ushered us in. We plonked down and ordered the following - 2 Golden Dragon Special Soup divided into three parts, 1 golden dragon special noodles with gravy, 1 chilli roast pork -  dry and with extra fat in it and 1 pork with mushrooms. 

Our food arrived soon enough - first was the soup. It was light -  not thick - and filled with mustard greens, carrots, cabbages, chicken, pork and shrimps in a very tasty broth. We followed it with the noodles which was a nicely balanced dish filled with chicken and prawn and topped with a fried egg which was cautiously cut in portions before serving. But the two pork dishes were amazing - the pork with mushrooms was extremely delicate and amazing and the chilly pork with little bits of fat clinging to the meat (we requested fatty pork btw, we love fat!!!) was soft and DIVINE. We ordered a second plate of it after finishing the first, and well, our total damage after all this was around 800/- for three people. Service was fast, very courteous, and very sweet.

I love Golden Dragon! For 2 reasons - 1 - you get pork there, 2 - its very reasonably priced, considering its on Park Street. I've been there a few times, during my dating days, and my then fiance (now husband) loves it too! The portions are reasonable and we always have enough to satisfy ourselves. The only downside is that it is a little small and cramped.

Roast chilli pork. Whenever I think about Golden Dragon or someone talks about it I remember their roast chilli pork. A lot of restaurants serve roast chilli pork but none can match Golden Dragon. It is just out of this world. A quaint little place, just opposite Mocambo run by a Chinese family this definitely is one of my favourite restaurants in town. Very dimly lit but a small and cosy place. In fact the dim lighting goes really well with the decor. The ambience is pretty good more often than not in spite of it being a very affordable restaurant. The food is always good. The sweet and sour pork here also rocks and so does a noodles in soup dish that they serve. You just need to add your own sauces to your own liking. Their service is really quick and food always good. Need to go to a place on or close to Park Street which is a little more reasonable than Bar BQ but not packed with drunks like Mags get yourself to Golden Dragon you are not going to be disappointed.

really the cheapest restaurant in park street, it also stands out for the awesome taste of the pork dishes. the chilly roasted pork and pork fried rice are highly recommended. we had dry chili chicken and chicken in hot garlic sauce along with that. both were good. but the portions of the starters are much less than the main course. the place is small but i don't think one should have a prblm in finding a place for a weekday lunch. the pocket pinch was rs 657 for a three course meal for two with two thumbs up

GOLDEN DRAGON stands out as the cheapest of the entire park street bunch of restros.
coming to the inetriors, its minimally decorated, but clean and comfortable, although the 1st floor is not upto my liking.
the chinese menu is quite extensive, and includes soups,starters,the staples-fried rice,noodles,meifoon,chopsuey,fish chicken and pork side dishes , desserts mainly ice creams, and soft beverages.

yesterday both of us ordered -
fried pork wantons
chicken meifoon
peking chicken

the meifoon and peking chicken were served first within 10 minutes. both tasted averagely good...nothing to knock out! peking chicken consisted of shredded chicken in red mid spicy gravy. a tinge of sweetness would have made it tastier. the quantities were standard, but not " huge" according to me.
the fried wantons took another 45 mins to come , just before we were planning to cancel the order. well they looked big ones, but after the 1st bite, we got to know, the size was mostly due to the outer fried batter.  the meat in the centre was in extremely limited quantity, that was a big dissapointment for those 8 pcs  prices at rs 115.
in previous occassions, i have tried the manchurian and schezwan chicken with few types of fried rices. all of them didnot satisfy me much taste wise. the quality of rice in the fried rice was also very dissaponting.
but since they continue serving chinese dishes at a much cheaper fare than the nearby restaurants, the place remains almost always packed.
Golden dragon might be crowd pleaser , but definitely lacks behind in terms of quality and authenticity.

When I first thought of going to Golden Dragon, I expected it to be expensive as it is located in Park Street. When I entered the restaurant, I understood it was an average restaurant. Being a vegetarian,it was difficult to order as it had a majority of the menu had Non-Veg items. We ordered Szechuan Vegetable Fried Rice, Vegetable Garlic Noodles, Chilli Baby Corn and French Mushroom and Baby Corn. I don't eat mushroom so I didn't taste French Mushroom. The Chilli Baby Corn was good enough. The quantity was sufficient enough. The  Veg. Fried Rice tasted very good and the Hakka Noodles had the taste of a pure Chinese cuisine. It would be good had the service been better. Except the service and ambiance, the restaurant and the food are worth the price paid.

This is probably the most pocket friendly restaurant in Park Street which serves amazingly delicious food. Located diagonal to the place where Music World used to stand, Golden Dragon is famous for its exquisite Chinese dishes (not the typical Indianised Chinese food).

I have been there a handful of times and each experience has been pleasant. The ambiance is okayish. The decor is simple. What brings people here over and over again is the fact that it serves one of the dishes in Part Street. My personal favourites would be Hunan Chicken and Peking Chicken. The rice and noodles are also a must have. It also serves some mouth watering pork dishes. The staffs are very friendly and helpful just like the management. We even pulled off a surprise birthday part for a friend over there without paying anything extra even though the staff and management helped us a lot.

So this comfortable joint is a must visit if you are in Park Street and trust me you won't be disappointed at all.

Ambiance: 3.5
Service: 5

Beautiful Interior which made me feel I was in a road side restaurant in China. The food was very delicious and different from what we Bongs ussualy have as "Chinese Khabar". The wangton was just awsome. Every food served is having authentic chinese taste. It's like mini China in Bongs favourite "Restaurant para". But I would like to add that the service is not satisfying. overall it's a good experience.  I would suggest all to visit this place to experience the authentic taste of China.

Have been here on Many occasions...  their Chinese is very different and you'll crave for it.  one mist try their spring rolls, crabs and prawn noodles..  their chilly pork is a personal favorite.
The ambiance is nice and welcoming,  the only disadvantage is they don't take cards but you really don't require it as its not at all expensive.

My favorite Chinese restaurant in the city. Why?
1. Golden Dragon is very cheap.
2. It's very simple. Nothing fancy. No confusing menus with weird names. Simplicity.
3. Their portions are HUGE.
4. Their food tastes waaaaay better than it looks.
5. The service is pretty fast. 

There. As simple as it gets.

i have seen golden dragon restro since a kid. true there is nothing to rave about the deco and all but since most traditiinal chinese do not like to spruce up their restaurants but nevertheless the food is great. the lung fung soup, the mixed hakka chow, garlic pork and lemon chicken, szechaun prawns, and honey chicken are some of the best items i have eaten at golden dragon. surely recommend it to those who are hardcore foodies and for those who go for the decos. production time is too long.

As you may have noticed the pricing for the food at Golden Dragon is: "Approx Rs. 500 for two (without alcohol)". It's awesome, really, how this restaurant manages to dish out really tasty, sumptuous food for this price.
The MUST-HAVES here include: Golden Dragon Special Noodles (cantonese style), Chilli POrk, Lemon Chicken AND the Mixed Vegetables (this is divine, and this coming from me - a die-hard carnivore!)

Golden Dragon has been around forever and serves pretty good Chinese food. Location wise its excellently placed on the corner of Park Street and Free School Street opposite Mocambo. Be warned that if your looking for fine dining with super fancy ambience this is not the place for you but if like me your  a foodie who will follow the trail of good food then Golden Dragon is a great choice. Start with the fried wantons and either the Talumein or Lung Fung Soup which are pretty good. For your main course the must order dish is Chilli Pork which is super along with the mixed meifoon and mixed fried rice paired up with the kungpao chicken or garlic chicken. Good servings at great prices is the added plus over taste. However service is erratic so don't expect too much in that department.

One of the few options you have of a decent meal in the heart of Park Street that won't burn a hole in your wallet, Golden Dragon is situated just beside the Donut Bakers on the ground floor of Park Plaza and has been around for ages. Their claim of serving authentic Chinese cuisine is probably supplanted by the fact that a Chinese family runs it. Like most such restaurants across the city where the fading Chinese diaspora holds the rein, this place was once much better than it is now. 
However, everything from the tasty food to the snug ambience and the quick servers with a smile will definitely make you love this place. Chinese is found at its best here, without the back breaking prices. The menu is expansive with most items passing the test of taste superbly. The soups are fantastic and the Talumein Soup we ordered were a delight. Also try the Manchow soup. Other than the usual schezwan and babycorn chowmeins, they also rustle up a wanton chowmein which we had and was bowled over. Please also try the Shredded Chicken in garlic sauce and a dish aptly named Special Chowmein. :) The lighting and setting create a nice cosy atmosphere perfect for a date. The food arrives fast even when the crowd is bursting, which is nearly always. 

Chakraborty Tip : Upstairs is probably better if you have a larger group with you but the environment is better downstairs.

This place serves quite good Chinese food with decent ambience in 'Park Street'. I have visited this one a couple of times and never got too disappointed. As usual the common chinese dishes like babycorn, momo, noodles, rice, various chicken dishes are well prepared. 
The staff are jolly and cordial, they can give you good suggestions if required. You can trust their suggestions completely and rely on them. 
The ambience is well done though nothing out of the world. 
Overall i am always satisfied after my meal here, the pricing too is low and very reasonable. I rate it 3.5 and if you are crazy for Chinese food you must visit this one for sure.

The Golden Dragon is a Chinese restaurant just off Park Street, and is well known for the cheap Chinese food it serves. It has always been considered to serve good, but not extraordinary food. Over the last year, though, there has been a dip in the quality of the food being served.

The restaurant is spread over two floors. The ground floor has smaller tables and is the better place to sit. For larger groups, or when the ground floor is full, customers sit on the mezzanine floor, which has longer tables. The mezzanine does not find much favour with me as it is impersonal, with wall-to-wall mirrors that reflect the tables. The lighting is too dim and the air-conditioner(s) work fitfully. The service on that floor is also slower.

The food is still standard - not bad, but not extraordiarily good. They make good soups, and their dishes in oyster sauce are still well made. Standard items should be stuck to - the few Thai items on the new menu are best avoided.

Provided that the quality of the food goes back to the older, better standard, this restaurant would be a very good place to visit.

Wandering in Park Street having exhausted almost our entire pocket money, my friend and I walked into Golden Dragon. We weren't expecting much, but to our suprise the food was good, delicious, hot. Service -a bit slow, decor - kinda shabby. But you can count all that out considering we had a great lunch in around 300 bucks. Great place. Easy on your pockets.

Well, Ive been to this restaurant twice and i wasnt dissapointed.
The first and foremost reason is because the food here is cheap. Located at Park street, opposite Mocambo...It sure packs a punch in terms of taste and quality. Infact some of the dishes are at par with any of the better chinese restaurants in the city. A typical meal for two would come to around 300 bucks which is bound to bring a smile on your face, given the location. Instant hit with college students. The food quantity is decent but i wish the waiters were as generous in having a smile on their face. The service is a bit slow but the food compensates for the lost time. The decor is sort of okay...okay. But if you are looking for a place to have good food going easy on your pockets, Golden Dragon is your place.

this is my second time writing a review about Golden Dragon because I feel my first one was very bleak and lacked just points :) ok, so this restaurant like I mentioned before is my ultimate favorite. This is where we eat during our break time or even on other occasions. And I would detest anyone who don't like this restaurant. I feel they they serve very good chinese food, definitely 1 of the best in the city atleast in my opinion. Some their top notch would a be szechuan chicken fried rice, chicken mayfoon, chilly chicken, hunan chicken, manchow soup and shredded chicken in hot garlic sauce. The restaurant is yes a bit small when you see it but they do have another upstairs which the open only when downstairs is full. I only wished the waiters smiled but well,;they dont anyway :( and most importantly is kind of cheap have recently increased their prices by a bit the quantity that they serve is quite a lot. so drop in here and you wont regret getting inside it's lovely food!!

This is the place where my friends and I are always seen at break times, the food is authentic the ambience is nothing fancy but is does it. One must try szechuan fried rice, kung pao and red pepper chicken its terrific!

The place is really economical given its location in parkstreet(Bang opposite to Mocambo and TungFong).The dishes are mostly in the range of Rs.95 to 120, and the quantity is not very scanty either(2 plates should be enough for 3)
The two things i simply love here are the thai soup and roast chilly pork. I have had this pork dish in many other restaurant in Kolkata as well as in other cities, but this place wins hands down.Whenever i visit this place, these two are MUST haves.
I also like their cantonese noodles. But I am not too fond of their gravy chicken dishes.

I have been to this restaurant recently with my friends and I had a disastrous experience. Located at a place like Park Street, Golden Dragon definitely serves you at a very cheap price but then their quality of food is very much compromised. We had Chicken wonton soup-chicken hot wings-prawn balls as the starter and mixed fried rice-mixed noodles-schezwan chicken-hot garlic chicken-roasted chili pork as the main course. They took almost ages to serve those dishes both in case of starters and the main course! The waiters were either inattentive or busy in some really serious works other than catering to the people present there. They took nearly 30 minutes to prepare 6 fresh lime soda! Except for the chicken wonton soup, chicken hot wings (or whatever it was named) and schezwan chicken, all the other items were clearly substandard. If one is looking for a low-priced place to eat at a location of Park Street, this might be a choice. But be prepared to be welcomed with a poor service and an ordinary, if not bad, food-quality.

Given the fact that the restaurant is located at Park Street, the food here is cheap and delectable. We started our meal with Kung Pao Chicken and Fried Prawn as starters. The Kung Pao Chicken was delicious. I wouldnt say the Fried prawn was the best Ive ever had,yet it was good. The restaurants at Tangra do it better I suppose. For our mains we had ordered Golden Dragon Special Fried Rice and Golden Dragon Special Meifoon(Rice Noodles). Both the rice and noodles were filled with pieces of chicken,prawn and pork. As sides we had Pork Mushroom gravy and Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce. The fish dish was subtly spiced,not too much as you would find in many chinese eateries. The Pork and Mushroom had blended well but the gravy was a little bland to my liking(Im generally fond of spicy food). We washed all of it down with glasses of sweet lime soda. Overall the experience was good.

Have to mention this place as its just amazing. At a posh plave like park street this place is surprisingly reasonable however since it does not have a bar license people tend to frequent it less, however that said its Awesome food at an amazing price.
You cant get better value for your buck at any other place located right at the heart of the city. The must tries are the diced chicken, chicken fried rice and the sweet corn chicken soup.

Recently I went to this restaurant on 5/5/12(Saturday) with my friends. It was closed for a couple of weeks (may be for months, not sure) and now it is back with a few renovations. But the FOOD quality & the price (5-10 bucks added/ dish) is the same  :).
We had Special Golden Dragon Cantonese noodles (Whenever I go there I have it - must), Roasted Chili Pork, Chicken in Garlic Sauce, Hunan Chicken.
The taste was excellent and the atmosphere was nice. I went to this place several times still When Its Chinese I want, I always put this restaurant in the top 3 of my list. Favorite destination for those who love Chinese. A must visit.

*********Essential!!*********

Golden Dragon is one of those eateries that manages to provide social commentary on the " gastronomic zeitgeist" of Kolkata. It is also one of those eateries which, in my opinion, makes Kolkata the mecca of inexpensive good food of almost every variety conceivable. 
Golden Dragon is a small restaurant on the famed Park Street, run by a family of Chinese ancestry, and serving superb, no frills Chinese food at shockingly reasonable rates. 
Everything about the restaurant - the aquarium, dim lights, reddish interiors, simple white crockery and garish Asian decorative pieces is a testament to the substantial "AsianChineseNorth Eastern" community and their designated neighborhood -China Town or Tangra. 
Service is prompt and unobtrusive, seating is cosy and the food is divine. 
The restaurant has only about 6 tables and at any given point in time 4 will be occupied, usually by Bengalis (we love our Chinese food) or by members of the "Chinese" community. 
I've eaten here so many times that I've lost count a long time ago. What remains constant, however, is the stuff that I order: 
1) PorkChicken Fried Wantons - Tasty mince filling in crisp golden wanton shells. I make my own special dipping sauce by mixing their chilli sauce and several drops of lemon juice. 
2)Hot & Sour Thai Lung Fung Soup - Need I say more ?? 
3) Golden Dragon Special Cantonese Noodles - Possibly my favorite in India !! The mixture of soft and semi fried noodles in a gravy with chinese greens, chicken, prawn and pork dumplings topped off with a double fried egg is almost like a panacea for my woes. 
4) Chilli Roast Pork - The perfect accompaniment for the noodles. In fact, this combo might possibly be the second greatest of all time, right behind hot buttered toast. The combo of semi-lean slices of roast pork tossed around with fried onions, soya sauce and sliced chillies is phenomenal. 
Although I order these items 95% of the time I visit Golden Dragon, I've tried enough items from the menu to recommend them wholeheartedly too. 
The meal ends with the ubiquitous mouth freshener and toothpick platter which is placed alongside the bill(usually about 350 bucks)in a simple black leather folio. 
Eating at Golden Dragon when I'm in Kolkata is almost as essential to me as breathing - I kid you not !! 
I cant't imagine my beloved home city without this establishment, the memories attached to it and the wonderful meals I've enjoyed here so many times. Golden Dragon epitomizes comfort food, not just for the palate but for the soul too.
