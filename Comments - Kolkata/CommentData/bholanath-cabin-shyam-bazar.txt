A nice place for a quick bite on your way. This one is a forty-year-old shop near Ramakrishna Math, Balaram Mandir ( near Shyambazar Metro) and exactly in front of Girish Bhavan. You can have chicken dishes as well as dishes like egg devil,Â ghugni, egg toast, tea and other snacks at a very reasonable price. As this is a small shop you can not enter the shop rather you have to sit on chairs provided by them on the outside. But no matter what you will like their food.
