Went there on the Christmas day during afternoon! It wasn't that crowded and the ambience had nothing to do as it was the day time! We had ordered one Kighfisher storm and VAT 69(30ml) along with chicken nachos! Chicken nachos tasted good but the nachos wasn't toasty and had some unpleasant odour, but the nachos dip tasted awesome! The bar price range is quite affordable! Would like to visit again.

The first bar in Garia, our favorite stop during college days. It has a come a long way, with the decor, food and feel.
Lamb in oyester sauce is a must try. Also ask for their special fish kabab.

I went there through little, ordered mocktail, chicken sweet and sour soup,Angara kebeb, butter nan,salad,Dal makhani,keshria pulao,Mich murg marshals, chicken butter Mashala and ice cream. Their chicken items are really finger licking.naan is also good. I don't like their jafrani pulao, it's a bit dry and pan Mashala flavoured.overall experience is good.

Good one with a restaurant cum bar separated by a floor. Visited the place with a lot expectation. Everything is good without the proper hygiene. The main issue is regarding the cleanliness and maintainance. Seems they have put less concentration over being clean and tidy enough. Rest of all are quite good with ambience and food. Food quality is good and quantity is sufficient. But should be much aware of keeping all dishes and tables proper cleaned and maintained.

The place has a quite homely atmosphere. However I did not liked the interior design of the place. Tried the chicken Tikka butter masala which comes at a price of 270 plus tax for 1plate which comes with 4piece chicken only. The taste was good but we felt it was more like Kadhai chicken. The Butter naan was nice. Food is a bit expensive considering the quantity and quality. Overall 3.5/5

It is in the same building with Baraf. Rather this is the bar. Baraf is the family restaurant. Food quality is very good. It shares the same menu. Ambience is also inviting. Located just beside the Garia Bazzar metro makes the place very convenient. Has a separate smoking zone also. Staff are well trained & professional. Overall a very good place.

There are times when you want soul satisfying food, full of aroma, rich in flavorful spices, a food you can’t stop yourself from having in heap.  That’s when Bengali Food crosses your mind but more importantly, it is necessary to have it from a place which prepares Bengali food preparation very delicately in whatever type the dish is, One such place I came across recently is BabuMashai. Although the place is famous for Bengali Food but their other items should surely not to be missed. Babumashai is located just Beside of Kavi Najrul Metro Station. This is a lovely place for fine dining . With semi private dining areas, the place makes sure that we are able to enjoy our meal in peace. The whole vibe of the restaurant is very calm and relaxed. They have a good amount of space that has been utilized to create a simple seating atmosphere.  I have been here with Team Panchphoron to attend their Durga Puja food menu launch and it was Hilsa Festival Elishey-Babuana. It surprised me like anything. The long listed menu start with

Located at the prime location just 2mins walking distance from Kabi Nazrul Metro Station this restaurant is comprised of both restaurants and bar. 
Babumashai is located on the 3rd floor. The decor is quite simple and nice with a seating capacity of 50 people or more. 
So for the upcoming Durga puja babumashai is launching some new and innovative dishes. Even they are arranging Ilish festival which includes a variety of ilish delicacies.
Team Panchphoron was invited for their food tasting event. The dishes were comprised from starters to main course. Thus here are some of the dishes we tasted over there.

ILISHI DELICACIES- 
■ ILISH CUTLET- Beautifully decorated. The ilish cutlet was designed in the shape of a Hilsha fish. It was crispy from outside and soft succlucent from inside. The ilish was very fresh.
■ ILISH TANDOOR- This dish was prepared in tandoor style. The spices were packed with flavours. It was a little spicy which goes great with corriander chutney or even with mustard sauce.
■ DOI ILISH- Prepared with curd..this dish is sweet and salty in taste. The ilish was pretty soft and the curry was very tasty as well. Another great preparation.
■ ILISH PATURI- Bengalis festive mood cannot get over with some pinch of bangaliana in it. Paturi is the undoubted winner. And when its ilish paturi you just cannot say no to it. The ilish fish was baked nicely. It was fresh. Great in taste.

CHINESE AND INDIAN-
■ STUFFED MUSHROOM- Soft balls made of mushroom with cream and cheese filled in it. A moutwatering vegetarian starter.
■ HARA TAWA KEBAB- Fried vegetable filled kebab was good in taste.
■ CHICKEN TIKKA- It was so delicious. Had that tangy flavour in it. Little spicy. Served with corriander chutney and mayonnaise.
■ LAT MEI KAI- A very popular chinese dish. This dish was so flavourful. Had that spicy, sweet, salty taste. Served with onion leaf, julian cut veggies. Great in taste. Must try.
■ DRUMS OF HEAVEN- Chicken leg pieces cooked dry with varieties of spices. The chicken was soft and succlucent. It was crispy from outside. And the dry gravy was so yummy. Loved it.
■ TANDOORI PANEER WITH TAWA ROTI AND DAAL TARKA- A wholesome dish for my vegetarian friends out there. The paneer was very soft and fresh cooked with flavourful spices. Served with tawa roti which was good as well. Daal tarka complimented the paneer and roti really well. 

So altogether it was an great experience out there. The owner herself and all the staffs took special attention to each and everything. 
To all my loving friends please try out their dishes. And I am sure your Puja will become more special. Till then Happy eating 😊

And yes I am a proud member of Team PANCHPHORON

Located near kavi najrul metro station. Ambiance is good but the quantity of food is too less according to the price. We ordered 4 plates of schezwan mixed fried rice and 2 plates of chicken in oyster sauce. But they served only 2 plates of rice and told us that each plate contains of two. The chicken pieces were also very small. It was actually a total wastage of money.

Being at a prime location, it attracts many people. A bit higher in the price range Babumashai serves good food. Simple but comfortable interior. Comfortable ambience gives a good feeling. Warm and cordial behaviour of the service persons are also to be mentioned. They also serve hard drinks and price is premium. Overall good experience.

After a long time I went to this restaurant yesterday. I was surprised to see a group of disinterested service persons and a disgusted floor manager. Food quality is surprisingly poor. Serving is very general. They were serving in a way as if they were serving in an on shop not in a restaurant. I found each of them reluctant specifically the manager. I think he needs to see a doctor. He was so unwell both mentally and physically. After such disinterested serving they produced a bill including GST for food only. Price for drinks is all inclusive. When I asked a proper GST bill with my GST number he refused to produce such. His lame excuses were such ridiculous that even the glasses started giggling. I was spellbound to hear that this is the common practice! Not producing proper GST bill!! 

Mr Narendra Modi, our Honourable Prime Minister and our respected Finance Minister should know about this. Sir we are paying double tax and you are getting nothing.

Shame on you Babumashai!

Visited there at last weekend for lunch. Had Chinese food mentioning chicken fried rice, chicken soup and oyster fish. Food quality was very average. The soup was good but may be they forgot to include salt (ha ha ha). The only thing is the price, it's reasonable else don't expect higher from them. It's a average restaurant.

A very pleasant multicuisine restaurant , Babumoshai is a sure-visit place. The interiors and ambience is comfortable, and the service by the staff is quite impressive. The delicious food is ample in quantity, thus reasonably priced. In fact, the kebabs are their specialty. I also enjoyed the Chicken Schezwan Noodles and Teppan Chicken, along with Fresh Lime Soda.

Had come here with a friend almost two years ago. We were in Garia and wanted to grab something to eat near the metro station when we decided to give this restaurant a try. Décor is ordinary, service is ok at best. We had a Chinese meal. It arrived hot which was a good thing and the taste was good too. Pocket pinch is moderately low. This place is ok for a one time try.

Babumashai, noodles oodles and baraf are in same building and under same management. Visit either of them the experience would be same. Food taste good, comparably favourable pricing and the service is courteous though there can b delays. But the Bengali cuisine could have been better.

Located right next to Garia metro station, this eatery is part of a shopping complex beside Garia Sitala Mandir. 
We went there in its early days. It was okayish, mostly at a time when Garia was developing and didn't have too many options nearby.

The prime location of this restaurant next to kavi nazrul metro station was the only reason that pulled us here for lunch today. The multistoried building has been taken for restaurant and bar business , the moment we were about to enter , the security informed us restaurant is on the first floor , serving only italian continental and south indian. The first floor seating comprised of plastic muticolour chairs no better than the one we see at food courts. we asked for the menu , that features chinese as well , we were told its available on 3rd floor which was a bar cum restro. Finally we went up there , the interiors of both the floors were disappointing tad shabby and old fashioned. We selected few chinese dishes and on asking the availability of pasta mentioned in the Same menu , the waitor hesitated and was unsure , he informed he had to ask the chef downstairs and continental dishes will be charged extra if we order it from 3rd floor ! How Hippocratic , the same restaurant with same menu card with divided kitchen charges extra for carrying the food up or downstairs!!

What we had was CRISPY CHILLI BABYCORN , MIXED BABUMOSHAI SPECIAL FRIED RICE , CHILLI GARLIC MIXED NOODLES and CHICKEN WITH PINEAPPLE AND GARLIC SAUCE. The babycorn was really nice , rest were below par. Thannkfully nothing was stale.
And the serving time !! Took almost more than an hour to serve that too after repeatedly asking for food. And so idiotic they took another 15 minutes for summing up the bill. Sheer wastage of the property in such a convenient location. Must avoid. Please avoid.

Located right next to Garia metro station, this eatery is part of a shopping complex beside Garia Sitala Mandir. 
We went there in its early days. It was okayish, mostly at a time when Garia was developing and didn't have too many options nearby.

Prime location at Garia, I visit this place quite often, just love their friendly behaviour and the chilling ambience. Special thanks to Mr. Jyotirmoy and team, a warm welcome is always ready from them... The place is little over priced. Couldn't give 5 coz of the price. Thanks to the team members for making my day.
Keep it up guyz... Sure visit for next time

I went there only because it is in the prime location in garia. Otherwise I would never visit this place. The food quality is not that good. And quality wise it is over priced. And they don't allow in three-quarter. Thats ridiculous.

The prime location of this restaurant next to kavi nazrul metro station was the only reason that pulled us here for lunch today. The multistoried building has been taken for restaurant and bar business , the moment we were about to enter , the security informed us restaurant is on the first floor , serving only italian continental and south indian. The first floor seating comprised of plastic muticolour chairs no better than the one we see at food courts. we asked for the menu , that features chinese as well , we were told its available on 3rd floor which was a bar cum restro. Finally we went up there , the interiors of both the floors were disappointing tad shabby and old fashioned.

I was there this evening as usual like many other occasions and was treated very shabbily by the waiter attending to me. I was ignored right throughout the evening by the waiter and had a tough time catching his attention. Finally, I asked for my bill and he replied..."I am coming"....This act was repeated three times over...each time I was waved away with his hand...totally disregarding my request foe the bill..Finally I walked away with without paying the bill...However, I paid the the bill to the manager after complaining  about the shoddy treatment received....MOST DISAPPOINTING EVENING

Visited this restaurant with the Groupon Offer of 599 Indian Combo Dinner valid for 2. For this they already had a set menu to choose from which is fair enough. Here is what was promised and what was given.

Indian Combo Inclusions:
2 Soup (Veg / Non-Veg)  --offered-->  1 Soup in 1/2 servings
1 Starter (Veg / Chicken / Fish ) --offered--> 4 Piece Chicken plate instead of 6
1 Main-course ( Veg / Chicken / Fish )  --offered--> Quantity Reduced than regular order.
1 Dal --offered--> Quantity Reduced than regular order.
1 Rice Item  --offered-->  Good
2 Indian Assorted Beads   --offered--> 1 in 2 pieces instead of 2
1 Salad  --offered--> Good
Papad and Pickles --offered--> Not offered
2 Desserts  --offered--> Icecreams were good
2 Fresh Limes / Mocktails  --offered--> Small servings similar to welcome drink.

When one decides to make a set menu for a Offer, all the items in the menu should be given as mentioned and in regular servings, or else mention it in the offer. Where on earth you get a Chicken Malai Tikka plate for 4 piece servings in a similar restaurant?
Food tastes nice and behavior of staff is very warm and pleasant.

Situated just beside kavi nazrul metro station it  looks tempting from outside but as soon as you enter the restaurant that same feeling disappears.i personally do not like the interior and the ambience too.
Coming to food,it tastes good and well in quantity. we ordered blue lagoon,panfried chili fish,fried baby corn and mushrooms in staters. In maincourse we took hakka noodles and fried rice and one chicken preparation.lastly they serve icecream only one scoop which was disappointing.
As a whole it was a mixed experience visiting here and second time hopefully i wont prefer to come here.

The location is quite good!!! The interior is also good!!! But the rest is just awful!! The time they took to serve us our food is 40 min!! The worst I have experienced so far!! The fried rice was not up to the mark!! The Thai chicken is just pathetic!! The Chicken with hot garlic soup was good!! Overall food taste wise is not satisfactory!! The price is high for the food they serve!! And the most hilarious part we even had to wait about 20mins for our bill!!! The price of alcohol was even more than olypub!!! It's a bad food day to me!!!

It's surely the most sophisticated and best in terms of quality of both food and services in this locality. If you find my review too bias then you should come and see for yourself. No matter which cuisine you'd prefer the chef will surely surprise you with their delicacies.. And don't forget to try the kebab thali.

This restaurant situated just near the Garia Bazar metro station. So location wise it's great to have lunch or dinner over there.  But the interior decoration must be improved. The food quality is okay. We have ordered a fish item and a chicken item and both of them are almost same in taste. The prices are pretty decent. Staff behaviour is good. But the most disappointing thing about this place is the food delivery time. We were almost thought about leaving the place as we have to wait for a really long time for even a soup!!! So I must say you may visit the place, but be prepared to wait for a looooong time for your food!

But the behaviour of the staff is fine.

Babumashai: well their bengali food is good and it offers a good choice in a place like garia bazar. Visited there today and had a hearty meal.
Decor: it's situated just beside the kavi nazrul metro station or the garia bazar as they say.it's clean and calm. Not so much crowd.
Service: the service is quick and the waiters are attentive, composed and helpful.
Food: we ordered the chicken reshmi kebab,peas pulao and mutton dak- bunglow. The food was titillating to our senses. The reshmi kebab was as reshmi as ever and beautifully done visually and tastefully. Then came the peas pulao and the mutton. The mutton was a bit fibrous. However the gravy was pretty well done sweet sour and spicey..went well as a combination. Overall we were fully satieted..
Price: rs 650 for 2.. That's pretty cheap for the awesome food.

Quick summary for quick view: 
Quantity: 1 plate is enough for 2
Quality: lipsmacking
Decor: quiet and calm. However I missed the view as the others said as they won't open their windows.. 
Price: reasonable 

Conclusion: would visit again to try their food.. It's pretty good.. :-)

I liked the restaurant mainly for the following reasons:

1. The location: just outside Kavi Nazrul Metro Station
2. The decor: the furniture and the interior design is awesome
3. The service: they serve the food in less than 15 minutes after placing the order
4. The view outside: u'll b able 2 c the running metros and crowd from the top.

and, last but not the least

5. ThE FoOd: luscious dishes with pleasingly rich which strongly appeals your taste buds !!

The location of this reatuarant is actually qte good and easy to find, jst beside the garia metro station. The area in the restuarant is spacious, waiters are very well behaved. In case of doubt wat to order, they do suggest good items according to choice of customers. Food is good, the only problem is the price which is bit on the higher side. So, its not pocble to visit this place if it is planned ol of a sudden, one need to be bt prepared.

In such a surrounding it was a surprise...hospitality good...varities of food and drinks....as the orders were given...the best thing I liked is the set of papads for all...yeah that's a good idea to keep the hungry tigers calm...though that wasn't enough...we were extremely hungry after the hectic xam schedule....so according to us they were late enough to serve us... but the food worth the wait....quality wise quantity wise and cost wise it didn't disappoint at all...it made the day...I will like to rate it 3.5 out of 5...and would definitely love to go back once more!

This restaurant is located at stone's throw distance from Kavi Nazrul Metro station in Garia. Was there at around 1:40pm and decided to go for take away.

There are actually two restaurants combined under one banner.
1. Baraf - The Last Metro (this is on the 3rd floor and is a bar cum restaurant)
2. Babumoshai - The Last Metro (this is on the 4th floor and is a family restaurant)

The primary mode of transport to the restaurant is a old style lift (the one where you manually close the grill gate). Of course you can decide to take stairs but if you are like me, you will definitely avoid it. The lift is something the management can definitely work upon.

Inside the family restaurant, the sitting area was spacious, well lit, with LCD tv and nice arrangement of chairs and tables. The biggest "LIKE" from my side was view. The metro rail line passed just beside the window at the same level. The view of metro rails moving up and down was something which I enjoyed.

As soon as I stepped in, I was immediately given a seat and a waiter came forward with menu card (good service). The menu looked extensive with bengali, north indian, choices of kabab, soup, choice of bread, sweets and drink. I asked the waiter whether there was any item which was speciality of the restaurant or which he recommended was certified tasty. The answer was that there was no such speciality as such but all the items were good(fair enough...).

I decided to go for simple indian order.
1. Kasha murgi - Rs 180/- (4 pieces a plate)
2. Jhiri aloo bhaja - Rs 60/-
3. Sona muger daal - Rs 100/-
4. Chingrir malai curry - Rs 300/- (5 pieces a plate)
5. Sukto - Rs 120/-

While I was waiting, they gave me a tray full of papad. The staff was really attentive and hospitable. The order took around 20 minutes to get ready. The food was good. Kasha murgi pieces were fairly large and the curry was very tasty. Chingrir malai curry was sweet and had great taste. The best was the daal and sukto which was really awesome.
Overall, the food, ambiance and location are all great for this place. The only downside (probably it is also a positive for the restaurant) is that this is located in between a crowded market place and beside the metro station where you always have hustle and bustle of people all around. If you have a car, you could be in great trouble finding a parking space. Best way is what I did. Park your car somewhere else and take an auto or a rickshaw to this place. Or you can simply go for home delivery.
