This restaurant is located right beside my house. More of my go-to restaurant when i crave restaurant food, this place has some really amazing food at cheap prices. Normal cuisines, nothing too extravagant. 
If you're looking for food to meet your appetite, and are in the Paikpara area, this is the place you gotta be at.

Well it was not bad but it wasn't worth the price. Ordered Chinese food it was OK but the quantity could have been better. The kebab was below par

Unimpressive!! by all margins. We had chili chicken, schezwan chicken hakka noodles, just wanted to have a quick dinner, but when the food arrived!! One plate noodles looked more like 60% in quantity as compared to anywhere I have ever eaten (refer my other reviews). The noodle was dry, very dry, the chicken in chili chicken was hard, unable to bite through one of the pieces, I swallowed the whole piece. They gave extra gravy for chili chicken, when requested, in the first serving the gravy consisted of a few pieces of onion and a few pieces of capsicum. One noodles is ONLY enough for one person here, so if its a take away for you, order likewise and they will spread the noodles on the plate to make it appear more :-\

Flavour's has been on the centre of Northern Avenue for quite a some time now. I remember being a student and checking into this place with my friends to grab a quick egg roll or chicken noodles from time to time. Moderate sitting area, average interior what Flavour's could not change over time is their really slow and unprofessional service. Their food quality has also degraded over the years. Irrespective of numerous efforts by changing their menu frequently doesn't really work and  this place is fading with time.

The place is just a 10 min walk from home. This used to be our go-to place a few years ago. We used to order food from here, every time we had a hankering for some change. Recently though the quality has dropped drastically. If you're looking for a place to snack and talk, by all means come here with your friends and order something light, at most some noodles. But do not try to fill up on the food they serve here.

One of the best restaurants in the dumdum locality. The garlic fish is just too good. People who havent been here must give this place a visit atleast once. Although the sitting area is small which is a major drawback. But there is no denying the fact that it is one of the top restaurants in dumdum area.

The food was average...
Ordered masala nun (wasn't very good), keema kulcha (average) and chicken tikka butter masala (sweet in taste)....
Salad was only the thing i enjoyed...
Ordered a coca cola 600ml for a little satisfaction after that food and even that also turned to be disaster....the coca cola was expired..it was of oct'15..
Terrible...

1.5 rating bcz the food was moderate....or else i would prefer other options than this restaurant when having option...

The restaurant is our "Parar" restaurant.
With my friends when it comes to party at home with a great movie ...we always depend on The Flavours
The food is so good even from price aspect 
As well as the hospitality and cleaning

Only is that the flavour of every items seems a little similar 
But well its their FLAVOR ...

Whether it is kabiraji or biryani or chinese or indian cuisine-this place serves tasty, good quality food with a decent ambience suitable for family and college crowd. Its not of a pocket pinch.
Try their chicken tikka masala / bharta/ egg tadka/ chicken roll/ friedrice/ chicken manchurian- they are really good for the price!

The food is alright. It's a viable choice for people with low budget. The Chinese is good actually and the home delivery system is quite efficient too.
For people living in and around Dum Dum, it's a good place to eat at. 
Nothing exceptionally good, but the food isn't disappointing either.

This restro is located at Northern Avenue.
Dim lit...light decor... all adds up to enlighten your mood.
This place is gonna work out just right for you if come in hungry with a caution on pocket pinch.
The North Indian and Chinese cuisines taste really well and are aptly cooked. The order time is also less.
Basically the hungrier you are the tastier the food is gonna be.

The Flavours is located at Northern Avenue.This is quiet a old restaurant up there .
I have been there many a times with friends ,family and foes.
The restaurant is not so big,but not so small.
When I went there for the first time I had mixed moglai.
It was awesome.
The moglai was stuffed with prawn,chicken and egg.
It was so crunchy and tasty ,that still didn't forget the taste.Still now it brings water to my mouth.The second time I went there I tried Chopsey .
Well ,to be frank ,it was not that tasty.
And we were disappointed.
After that there came some great combos at relatively cheap price.
Like Chicken Chowmein and 2 piece Chilli Chicken at rs 90 ,and many more.
Pocket friendly it is.
Service is ok.
But one day when I went there to have Chinese ,they said that it would take 20mins or more to make ,so we had to order Indian ,but it didn't take them less time to make.
Whatever it is.
So ,you can save some money by visiting here and having good food .

Located at Northern Avenue and Ganguly para crossing - this restaurant serves for a decade to the neighbourhood. Not awesom ambience or extra ordinary food - but decent food , quick service and also they do home delivery.

I would say it is more of a cafe than a restaurant. The quality of food can be made better.

For school goers and if u wanna have a meal when u r terribly hungry this is the best place...they serve some great chinese and north indian dishes..i have been visiting this place since my school days being near to my school...

I like their combo meals of chicken chow and chili chicken and mutton kosha ,dal makhni and parantha...this two i loveee..they also serve tandoors and rolls which i like...it comes in a package where u get tasty food within a readonable price of rs.200

It may be a small place yet a nicely decorated one ,servers are friendly and the place is very pocket friendly though they serve lil late...yet having school memories attached to it i will go there again and again... :)

The place is pocket friendly and also they provide combo meals with a decent quantity. The food is nothing to go gaga about but you will find it satisfactory. The ice-creams are very basic. The menu too is traditional i mean, the same old chinese and indian combination ie. no new kind of items. The service is not that bad.
You can definitely pay a visit.
