Tried their double egg cheese chicken roll. Right size with sufficient amount of chicken and cheese inside to make you happy. Eggs and cheese perfectly mixed together adding extra amount of fondness to have it once again .The chicken pieces were perfectly marinated, soft and juicy. Heard about this place from my brother so went there and had it . #Nomnom

As being recommended by a friend thought to try out this fast food house too. Thus, decreed for Chicken cheese roll. Appetizing, though too tiny for a barbarous foodie. Usual in size, nothing but taste of extra cheese was an addition to it.

Located in Saltlake V, just opposite to WEBEL Bhavan. They dont have any seating arrangement. Offers  wide range of snacks and fast foods as well as few moghlai dishes, parathas, tandoors and side dishes. Tried their normal egg roll and jabrr chicken roll, both were very good. Their jabrr chicken rool with cheese is the most popular dish and one must try it once. Moreover the price is also very cheap and reasonable in accordance with the quality of their food. But the outlet is very small.

One can easily guess the reason behind the bulging tummy of most of the IT guys... :P ... 

Jokes apart.... This place is worth a visit... And especially its a favourite spot amongst IT guys for their evening snacks and time pass

Tried their jabbrr mutton biryani with egg. Biryani was wonderful .The outlet is actually very small and most of their orders are take away. The staffs were all smiling and gave us some extra rice seeing two people sharing one plate of Biryani. That's so sweet of them!
Mutton was tender and well cooked. A great Biryani place. I tried their chicken rolls too but there was nothing significant in it.

Have heard of this place from my colleague, who asked me to try its Jabbrr roll and since then was awaiting a chance. Got the opportunity this September to savour on its chicken roll. The filling is good but the size of the roll is a bit too much for a single person to finish. It's better to order one for two persons and share and reorder if required. The taste was good enough but a bit too oily for my liking. Pricing is on the higher side but it can easily feed two hungry souls for a quick bite.

Had a Chicken Roll from this place and it was good. Now I don't know whether this had anything to do with the fact that someone treated me, as food bought from someone else's money often tastes much better. :D
Jokes apart this roll was really good. The paratha was soft and layery just like a lachha paratha. The chicken fillings was pretty tasty and the quantity was good to. The only downside for me was that the gravy was a bit too salty for my taste but I would really suggest all to give this place a try. And next time will try their special roll.

It has since been a ritual of ours to take a stroll in the evening. You see sitting all day at the desk and typing furiously, sooner or later gets to everybody. It so happens that this gem of an eatery falls in the path that we traverse and more often than not and way more often than it is advisable we find ourselves in the line to munch on the mouth watering rolls they dish out.
They don't have any seating arrangement available so you mostly have to eat out of the box or parcel it back to the office or home. But what they lack in decor they pretty much make up in the food department.
We have tasted their rolls and I will be damned if they didn't tasted heavenly.
I have tasted their egg chicken roll, chicken cheese roll, chicken roll, paneer roll and many other rolls which I don't seem to remember at the moment. All of them are good. But their oozy jabbr cheese chicken roll is divine in taste. The dripping cheese, the succulent chicken wrapped in the laccha is a taste to behold.
Their biriyani is good too if you like rich biriyani with loads of ghee and so is the chap.
But take my word for it no one makes rolls in sector v area quite like jabarr afghani. 
Only thing that stops giving them top score is a seating area. Though its not their fault. There is just not enough space. 
Lastly you are doing a great job people. I will surely miss your rolls more than even I know.

First time again, it was sudden stop for a Sunday munching. And we were hungry as hell. We went for their chicken cheese role and simple chicken role. I can't talk about the chicken role cause didn't taste it. However, chicken cheese role was beyond amazing. It was full of cheese and loaded with chicken and other stuffing. Too perfect. Then  for dinner we took a parcel of chicken chaap and two lacha parathas. And the chaap was mind blowing, exact amount of spice made it extraordinary. Chicken was tender and perfectly cooked. Parathas were soft and sweet, typical lachas. I loved this place. Its very small and cozy and well located. Best part is its a pocket friendly place for all. Definitely an option for next time.

Located near Webel building this small outlet is famous for it's rolls. I had tried rolls from their City Centre outlet multiple times, so i was well aware about their quality.
I ordered chicken cheese roll, with 12% tax it costed 70. It was great and full of flavours. Everything was good about the food. Use of cheese makes it even better.
As mentioned before it is a small joint, mainly for takeaways and rolls. They had only four chairs in front of the outlet. Though I liked thir food, but this place was not very clean.

Regarding the roll, not to tell anything....It's Finger Licking Good.....The 0.5 less is because the amount of cheese grated is much less as compared to the price of 70.....

If you like tasty food then do pay a visit to this place. Best known for their variety of rolls, they have a creative menu of rolls. The oozing cheese from "chicken cheese roll" will leave you wanting for more. The generous amounts of cheese in chicken cheese roll will fill up your stomach completely. I recommend trying out all their roll varieties.
There biryani is also very good and delicious compared to other "supposed to be good" biryani restaurants. Overall, a good pocket friendly food junction.
P.S- They don't have any seating arrangement so its more like a food junction rather than a restaurant.

Well if there's someone who can make you a sumptuous roll in this side of Kolkata, its this place. The Jabbrr of Jabbrr rolls and the Ooozing cheese rolls are a must have and I can easily dare you to have two. Any kind of craving can be sent home packing once you visit this small corner right beside Globsyn Crystal building, Webel more. Come, order, have it and you're good to go. That's how simple it is.

Have not tried this place but going through the menu it looks like a normal roll joint with usual common moglai and North Indian gravy items. The name Afghani is a misnomer.

There has been a shift in their location. Jabbr afghani is now located in Shaila towers, just beside the buddha bites outlet. I had heard a lot about their cheese rolls. This friday i decided to try it with a colleague of mine. So egg chicken cheese roll it was. The roll was good but could have been better. Frankly, the roll could have been better with a little lemon juice and a little spice along with the filling. Apart from rolls they also have limited main course items, biriyani to be more specific. I'd love to try it some day.

It's basically a take away. So no thoughts for services and ambience. Unluckilly I hadn't had their special jabbr roll but will try soon. I always end up having their chicken biryani which I find the best biryani in town in 100-200 sections. Neither arsalan, nor aminia, nor alibaba can compete their biryani. The chicken is fried and mostly leg piece. Another thumpsup for that. I don't prefer mutton so I can't comment on it. Friends who had mutton said it was okayish but masala rice portion 👍

New edit..
Back after having their jabbr roll. It tastes great but not as much as hyped.

Heard about this joint from my friends. So decided to try it during office lunch break. I was recommended to taste the jabbar chicken cheese roll, which was too delicious and more than enough for a lunch. As the cheese melts slowly, it becomes more soothing for the taste buds. Looking forward for another visit.

I just love the spicy taste of the Biryani. Till now tried only the Chicken Biryani and the way the chicken is prepared, for the biryani - awesome!

The portion is more than sufficient for a person.

So, after a long an tiresome journey I have finally reached to a wholesome conclusion . If you are in the silicon valley of Kolkata and you are looking for some good rolls, this is it . Jabbrr Afghani is the new standard or should I say benchmark of the traditional paratha based delicacy .

Jabbrr chicken cheese roll :- 

1. It's huge and very very wide . One of this roll is enough for you to carry on till your dinner .
2. The quantity of chicken is commendable .
3. The quality of paratha was fine .
4. The layers of cheese once you go deep is stunning . They didnot over do it though . It was sufficient .
5. The roll didnot contain any sauce and that made it unique and awesome .

Timing and packaging :- We ordered 15 roll and since we were in a hurry they promised to deliver in 45 minutes . Since , due to the recent payment issues they took Paytm and it was to our delight . The packaging was perfect and the roll was still very hot in the aluminium foil packaging .

Verdict :- A must must try if you are in sector 5 . This should be your one stop destination for your roll parties . My best wishes to them

I ordered a Double Chicken Cheese roll from Jabarr Afghani at 1 in the night. It was the best decision I made all week. The taste is phenomenal, there isn't ANY 'kanjusi' in any of the ingredients. The cheese melts perfectly into the chicken and there isn't any excess oil. Though delivery may take more time than usual, it is definitely worth it.

Well, they may have shifted their base from Infinity building to Shaila Towers (both in Sector 5, Saltlake), but definitely, everything else remains the same. Similar old store, similar limited seating arrangements, similar good old rolls, similar great service and similar reasonable prices.

Had their Paneer cheese roll for the 1st time, priced @ 55 bucks. A majority of other veg rolls were not available, as they have recently relocated and will take some time to streamline business. Roll was fine, as usual, but my earlier experience with their Infinity Towers store was much better. Good cottage cheese stuffing with onions, but high oil content. Food presentation as well as size of the roll is great!

Special kudos to the service guy, who was attending customers – was a 1-man army, managing so much!

And yeah, do visit them for a quick evening snack!

The Jabbr of Jabbr Cheese Rolls are unbelievably awesome. One roll is sufficient to floor a person with an average appetite. One should never miss out on the rolls here. The other items like Biryanis and chaaps are top class too and the quantity they serve....OMG. Be careful while ordering cause you might just end up wasting food. Top class stuff...simply top class. Pity they don't have a branch down south....something they need to look into.
