Ordered mutton rezala and butter naan. The rezala gravy was a bit too thick and creamy and lacked the typical light flavor rezalas should have. Butter naan was good and there were enough juicy mutton pieces of mutton. Lastly, they were a bit late delivering the order so I deducted half a star for that.

Very nice hangout place spcly if you are living in rajarhat area, as it wud be a little out of reach from main kolkatans. Interior is nicely maintained as the restaurant is comparatively new. Staffs are nice and humble.
When it comes to food, this place stands as its named. 99/100. Food is good and well served. Totally value for money. Cherry on the top is that they provide home delivery for a very minimal price order.
2 thumps up for the idea.

Located near the upcoming Siddha Happyville near Rajarhat Chowmatha. Though I have only ordered food from here..but thankfully the taste were quite good. Have tried their Fish Hariyali Kebab, Tangri Kebab, chicken bharta, biryani and Tandoori Roti. All these tasted well. Also I must add that their delivery is pretty quick and so the packaging is good. Overall if u stay in the vicinity..it's a must try restaurant.

Food was great. Roti nd Naan was very soft. Panner was soft and moist , kebabs were good too. The only negative point they have is delivery time. They took almost 1 hr 15 mins to deliver only four items. Need to improve only this part.

Living in Rajarhat, we had been waiting for the opening of good restaurants here, especially for food lovers. First came the Majestic Suite, and now came The 99.
Located near the Rajarhat Chowmatha, itz a medium sized well decorated restaurant. The ambience and decor is quite good.
Now coming to the main part, the food taste and quality.
First we took the starter Chicken Tengri Kabab which was quite good, followed by the 99 Spl soup and the Coriander Soup. The soups tasted different but was yummy!
Next we took the Mixed Noodles and Mixed Friend rice alongwith Kung Pao Chicken. Also had the Garlic Nun which was awesome! The rice n Noodles were good and tasty, and the chicken was excellent.
There are many other dishes which i have to try out next time i visit there.
So, overall, itz a good restaurant with quality and tasty food :-)

The food is very good, I ordered 3 tandoori rotis and paneer tikka butter masala, the rotis were good, and paneer pieces in the curry were very soft and tasty.....but the only and the major demerit is delivery time...they are not delivering within the estimated time...I think if they rectify this, they will have more customers....

Ordered mutton biryani, keema naan, cheese naan and kashmiri chicken. The biryani and kashmiri chicken tasted wonderful, you could say that they have got a good chef there. However, the meat in both the items seemed a bit less fresh, a typical problem with not so popular restaurants. If they can solve this part of their inventory management, they will surely be a big hit.

This is a new food joint near Rajarhat Chowmatha. Cannot tell about the ambience, because we ordered food at home. We got on time delivery with good packaging (I must mention)..Â 
We ordered Green Salad, Jeera Rice, Paneer Butter Masala and Chiken Curry. Jeera Rice is average, Paneer Butter Masala is good to taste with soft paneer pieces. The Chicken was a bit chewy but it tastes good.
Try it.. I also will love to go to this place again.

It is a great place for hangout. The quality and quantity of the food served is great. We ordered butter roti,methi chicken,chicken varta,salad and ice cream. All food taste good. The ambiance is great. The only problem we faced was the waiting time is very much compared to other places.

Located beside of Siddha Happyvilla very near to Rajarhat Chowmatha... Nice place to have dinner with appreciable interior... We ordered Chicken Achari Kebab , Chicken Bharta , Methi Chicken , Butter Tandoori roti , Ice cream... Each and Every item was almost equally good in taste... But the star of the show was "Achari Kebab"... In Chicken bharta they used some very finely chopped green chillies which made the dish exceptional ... But But But the service was very slow... We waited for almost one hour after order to have our foods... It may be for Diwali... Stuffs are very polite...

After a long wait Finally a restaurant shows up around this area. I have been crossing this place and the place is really pretty from the outside. Although i havent had the time to dine in i chose to get a delivery since my place is just few metres away.

I was skeptical about the quality of the food so i chose to order just two starters. Fish hariyali kebab and chicken tangri. The fish was amazing. Soft juicy and no smell. Usually fish kebabs even in big places can have a typical taste and smell but this one was absolute delight. Priced at 300/- i think it was worth every penny. The tangri kebab was the usual that one eats . It was good but could not beat the fish. The mint chutney can be better tastewise. It was little bland with the chicken.

However i hope to visit soon when they are fully ready with every item on their menu. The delivery was prompt and service was good. The food was well packed. I spoke to Mr. Swarup( sorry if i have forgotten the name) but I specifically told him to prepare the fish with extra care and i could see hes done the job right. Kudos  and i hope you keep the quality same throughout.

Had ordered food to be delivered at home for a get together of 4.Food tasted great,quality and quantity was perfect.Chicken Rashmi Kabab,Chicken Hariyali Kabab,Chicken Tangri Kabab -- they were just perfect and made our mood.Kashmiri Pulao,Chicken Kasha,Chicken Kolhapuri -- were good too,although we felt the pulao needed a bit more of sugar and salt both and Kolhapuri tasted better and spicier than kasha.Packing was superb,no spillage.Delivery was on time as promised.They accepted card on delivery for which I give an extra *.
Overall a nice joint in our vicinity and definitely will have a regular customer in us.
Thank you.

Excellent ambience, friendly staff behavior, courteous service, and above all very good food quality. A very good setup and first of its kind in the vicinity. Whats more.... there's more to come (Plane concept). Would definitely visit many many more times.

Update as on 4-Oct-2014: Over the last few days, I have been trying out various food items in their menu, all parcel orders, and every time they have impressed me with their packing, presentation and above all the quality and taste. Here is a brief of my personal opinion regarding the food that I have tasted:
Fish Hariyali kebab: Awesome
Fish Achari kebab: Outstanding
Chicken Biriyani: Outstanding
Chicken Reshmi kebab: Good
Chicken Tikka kebab: Good
Crispy Chicken: Very Good
Prawn Fried Rice: Very Good
Prawn Hakka Chow: Very Good
Chilly Fish: Good
Garlic Chicken: Good
Chilly Chicken: Good
Chicken Tandoori: Okay

Update as on 27-Oct-2017: It looks like this restaurant has got a little stability in terms of business, because the quality of food and service both has started deteorating. Billing mistakes, inattention to personalized orders, packing charges, etc. have all got introduced now. The quality of Tandoor items (mainly Chicken) is also no longer same as it used to be. We literally had to search for shrimp pieces in Mixed Rice. Result is that the frequency of orders from my end has also decreased. And that is most unfortunate for us.
