The bangalir bhaat macher hotel. This is what fern hotel is. I have eaten a couple of times here. And I have enjoyed it. At times simplicity is what life craves for. Go for their mutton curry. Its the best.

One of the worst restaurants in quality. I ordered paratha and mutton kasha. The paratha was dripping in oil and the mutton was raw and stale. Eat in a roadside shop, it will be better than going to this worst restaurant.

This is what u call an old fashioned restaurant.. still holding the nostalgia of Calcutta is the recent times..the choices may not be many but the food is awesome..rice dal fries and choices of the fish curry is enormous..any fish u name and they have it..minimal price and food is steaming hot..if u wanna taste authentic Bengali food and have a craving for fish then this is a must visit place

The place is a old Kolkata feel joint located near Gariahat road and Fern road crossing.  The name hence.  The place is small but nevertheless clean.  This people is a place where you can come and chat over cutlets,  fish fries,  and coffee.  They also serve meals as in Rice with veg,  chicken,  fish,  egg et al.  

The place is a classic and retains the coffee house feel.to it.  Also the owner boasts of hosting famous tollywood stars and even they are a fan of the food. 

I liked the food,  the fish fry was really nice,  the mughlai paratha could have been better.  

All in all a nice experience

This old joint is located near gariahat and is pretty close to my home. We have had our lunch here for so many times. Food, quality, taste everything is average. But pocket friendly.

This place has many memories from my childhood. I used to go there after school and with my family and friend. They serves very good fish fry and moghlai paratha.....

Located near Fern road intersection....just 10 mins from my home...its has not a single day in my childhood i didn't go there to taste their moghlai...the fry is really good...
can't complain...but as we have all the fancy restros emerging here & there this restro lost its flavor...still giving its best to survive in the long run of fancy air conditioned restros...its one of my favorite places to opt for moglai...just love it... will visit soon...:) :D

I went there at a wrong time. For vegetarians the ideal time to visit Ferns is for lunch. At dinner time they mostly serve  non-veg food, which according to my hubby was tasty but oily. The parathas were too oily for my liking. The cook was sweet enough to make a quick aloo subzi in-spite of not having vegetarian food at that time. The rating is mainly for their good service. They also have tiny cabins for women customers
