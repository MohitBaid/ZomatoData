Ordered from this restaurant due to an emergency because this is closest to my house. Even then, they took a lot of time to deliver just 1 plate of fried rice and one side.
We specifically asked for non spicy or less spicy options and they themselves recommended chilly garlic fried rice which was extremely spicy. So I am worried about the remaining menu. We ordered ginger chicken, and that tasted alright. The quantity was good and the prize wasn't a lot but the overspicy food was not worth it

Today On 4th August 2017 I Visited This Place Niu Eatz, Lake Gardens With My Friend Arnab De For The 1st Time.

In That They Gave Egg Fried Rice, Egg Chowmein, Chilly Chicken And Fish Finger. After That I Took A Mini Bus From Golf Green To Howrah Stn. And I Reach Ballygunge Phari For Rs. 8/- And I Reached Home Palm Avenue By 5:30pm. Thank you Niu Eatz For Making Our Day Special.
