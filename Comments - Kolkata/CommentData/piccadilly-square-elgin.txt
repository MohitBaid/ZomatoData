Before Calcutta sprung up with numerous waffle joints (especially Belgian Waffle co), Picadilly¬† Sq was the go-to place for all waffle lovers. It's a really small yet cozy and artsy joint and what makes it stand out from the rest of the waffle-wallahs is that it serves sumptuous sweet and savoury waffles/crepes.A few things I particularly enjoyed were dublin mudslide, classic belgian, nutella crepe, velvety red and the cheese and mushroom crepe. Their fondue's are also great!

Went here around 1 year ago. I had the chocolate mudslide. Though it tasted heavenly but the quantity was too less in comparison to price. The waffle was soft and melted in mouth. 
The chocolate syrup was sugary.

My first day in Calcutta; came here after a friend raved about its pancakes and waffles. I got super excited since I was craving for some for a while and ordered the pancakes with vanilla sauce. It was a boxed mix, unpalatable nightmare. It tasted so artificial, dry and like a truck load of sugar; the sauce was the same. 
The price is waaayy too high for something like that.
Couldn't even finish my food and that very rarely happens. Thank goodness that was the only thing I ordered.

On a cold winter evening , it is a blessing to have a cute little cafe like this one.
¬†Situated on the main road of Elgin, it is a quiet little cosy place with warm waffles, savory delights and a variety of hot and cold coffees.
We opted for one normal Latte, one Caramel Latte among hot coffees and¬† one Classic Belgian and Choco Dynamite among waffles.
All the four items were delicious, fresh and filled our soul with warmth and happiness. 

Great food, courteous service and reasonable price inspite of the classy location and the quality of food.

So a 4.5 in all the sections- service, ambience, price, food and location!

What stood out about this place was its prompt service. Had Choco Dynamite Waffle - with chocolate chips and chocolate case & a Hot latte. The waffle was fine , nothing extraordinary - the dish had 2 pieces of waffles only though, not 4.

Absolutely love the Popeyes Pick and The Dublin Mudslide- MUST TRY!
They have a special winter menu, from which I tried the Berry Merry waffles.
Decorated with strawberries and cream. It was a break from the chocolate world as you bite into the freshly cut strawberries.
Overall nice experience!

My sister was very eager to visit this place so we visited it on a cool winter evening.The place is really very cozy with painted walls and comfortable seats and the scent of warm brew wafting across.We went for a blueberry cheesecake,a darjeeling tea for me and capuccino for her.The prices are reasonable enough and if u get the window seat u can enjoy watching the lively humdrum of life outside while u r cozy inside this italian place sipping a cup of warm tea/coffee.

To be frank I was quite sceptic to try this place but after going here for the first time I‚Äôll probably be one of their regular visitors. 
I tried their Mushroom Crepe, Al Funghi Spaghetti & Chocolate Pancake. All of the items were top notch. However the pasta had excess amount of mushrooms which can be overbearing to the palette. Chocolate Hazelnut Shake was good too. Excellent service & warm ambience. Pricing is also good enough, all of this costed us 800 (GST included).

Price and quality apparently don't go hand in hand. Ordered for my all time favourite salad bowl. What I got was uneven chunks of vegetables with disproportionate dressing quantities followed by mockery was my today's visit here summed up. 
It was so disappointing I am glad that was the only thing I ordered. 
Please don't take your customers for granted! It's a request!

This place needs more than a 5 star rating! The d√©cor and ambience are so warm and friendly. We ordered a Mad about Mushrooms crepe, the Must Have Pancakes and the Dublin Mudslide waffles. The crepes were absolutely stuffed with perfectly cooked mushrooms, and the sauce accompanying them was lipsmacking! The pancakes were the best I've ever had. The texture was spot-on. And the gelato and chocolate sauce which came with the waffles were irresistibility good. The waffles were also wonderful - crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. All in all, I had a very very memorable experience, and I can't wait to go back. If you're having a bad day, head to Piccadilly Square RIGHT NOW! :D

I had been to Piccadilly Square once with two of my blogger friends! So I loved the overall ambience and decor of this cute little cafe. So it‚Äôs a veg cafeteria, a fun place to chill out with friends. ‚ù£Ô∏è
The best dishes to be tried are definitely the chocolaty waffles! These have to be the most yummy waffles I had lately. They were served with chocolate ice-cream and chocolate sauce as a dressing. üò¨üíñ
Before those sweet tooth, we tried the Cheezy Spinach Crepe which was again absolutely delicious and quite filling. 
We‚Äôd also tried the Pasta in white sauce, although not very delicious but was overall fine.

Back in my previous office, worn out by dealing with client queries, my boss and I would atleast twice a week extend our lunch break and hop into this pretty place to have their famous Popeye's Pick Crepe and Classic Belgian Waffle. 
The crepe is light, creamy and very tasty. The Classic Belgian Waffle is their best dish on the menu. With 2 quarters of a waffle generously topped with whipped cream and a bowl of warm, thick chocolate sauce, this sinful delight is bound to leave you craving for more.  
Curteous staff and a decent pocket pinch add the cherry on the cake.

Okay.. Guilty as charged. I am a little biased about this place. My love for their celestial chocolate is unbound. I go there and order. That is mandatary. I have been here many times and always, I have been delighted. But, then again I just order desserts and savories here. There waffles is not good. It is not crisp and is hard. So, that is a definite no no for me. Otherwise the crepes, pancakes and coffees are good.

One thing, the staff is not very welcoming and courteous and that is a big Turn Off!

I'm not a big fan of veg restaurants but this place, inspite of being a veg restaurant quite impressed me.
Visited this place for an early breakfast after a night duty at the hospital and we were craving for some soulful comfort food.
Ambience- simple and nice. They have both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements.
Order- we ordered a spaghetti aglio oglio, croissant, chocolate pancakes and red velvet waffles.
Food- the food was great. Loved every item especially the pasta and the warm soft pancakes. The waffle could have been better but loved the white chocolate sauce they served with it.
Pocket pinch- around 900INR
Overall- its one of the few veg restaurants I wouldn't mind visiting again!

A very trendy place with a wide variety of choices. The place is very well decorated and the staff is very cooperative. We ordered a red sauce penne pasta and a mixed sauce spaghetti. The sauce was a bit thick and did not blend well. The taste was good but it wasn't smooth. Could have been better. Then we ordered blueberry pancakes which was very well platted but was a bit too sweet. We also ordered white chocolate which was ok ok,nth great. All n all a nice place but did not give a wow experience.

We ordered a foccacia sandwich , Popeye's pick and a dark moccha frappe.
Popeye's pick was my favourite and i would suggest it to all of you. A creamy corn and spinach mix enveloped in a crepe topped with loads and loads of cheese .

Food was as delicious as ever but found them being very stingy in giving paper napkins. To start with they gave one between the four of us n had to ask for them. Gave two more making it three. Had the food n needed some more n were handed three more. Seeing the standard of the restaurant this is unbelievable n intolerable. Made a verbal note to the staff n instead of apology were given a shy smile. Writing this so that the management could check this wrong in future if it is not intentional. I carried a bad impression though the food was good

This place is a pure vegetarian‚Äôs delight. We went to Piccadilly Square for a small Sunday brunch. This place is very well decorated to match a cafe like you would find in Piccadilly London.  It has book indoors and outdoors sitting arrangement. The outdoor one had grasslike wall with a few window frames for decoration and the indoors one has a wall with paintings on it. On getting seated we were promptly handed over the menu and we placed our order. And within a few minutes food arrived at our table. I was amazed by the quick service provided to us.

A tiny but beautiful place on the main road next to Ideal Plaza. lovely cozy sitting and quite crowded even during weekdays. It's a completely vegetarian place. I am not saying that's a problem but the day I went i was craving something non veg.¬†
My friends and I had to kill sometime therefore we thought of having just coffee here. I had ordered for a hazelnut cappuccino, my friends ordered the regular cappuccinos. The taste and flavour were top notch. Cant complain. The food ordered on the next table looked quite impressive. May be, in my next visit I shall try out some of their offerings. Worth a visit if you are on a date. Be wary, parking could be a problem.

Super Delicious Food..!!
Humble Staff...!!
Decent Interior..!!
Since I planned for this yesterday..I wasn't being able to control myself...As I love Waffles too much...and everything was predetermined...what was I going to order...
Ordered Red Velvet Waffle, Chocolate Waffle, Popeye's Pick Cheese Crepe and Blueberry Pancakes..!!
Everything was super delicious..and was quite reasonable..as we don't get the Waffles everywhere now a days..!!
Super Satisfied From My Visit.. Would Love To Re-Visit as few dishes are yet to be tasted..hehe..!!

This quaint little cafe in the middle of a busy street is the perfect escape whenever one is feeling stressed out or low. It has limited seating - just four or five tables, and it is usually crowded, but if you go a little late in the night for desserts, it's at its charming best. The hot chocolate, milk shakes, pancakes, crepes, waffles are highly recommended. Doesn't burn a hole in the pocket, either!

It is a nice little cafe, situated in Sarat Bose road,near Elgin road (walking distance from the Bhawanipore College) . It has an outdoor seating as well. The menu is not so long. The decor is neat and attractive. Services is quick. Staffs are friendly. Basically we went to try out their pancakes. 
We took the Creme  De La France pancakes with Vanilla sauce (5/5), which perfect for the taste buds, soft and yummy, specially the vanilla sauce added to its taste. We also had Strawberry Yogurt Smoothie(4.5/5), which had a thick consistently. Lastly we had Pasta Salad(3/5) which didn't impress me that much. I would definitely‚Äã like to visit this place again to try out their waffles and crepes as I have heard much about them.
Overall a big thumbs up to this place. Highly Recommended.

Awesome food, its been more then 10 years i know this place from my student days in kolkata and it tastes the same. More options in the menu added since then. They have awesome Sandwhichs, shakes, pastas, waffles and more. This is pure veg restaurant but you will not miss the meat here. Good work guys keep it up more outlets needed in other cities too.

Piccadilly square is one of our most favorite eat outs in Kolkata. Located at  Landsdowne , they have beautiful interior as well as an outdoor seating arrangement . Though they have other things in the menu what keeps us calling  back to this place, are their super tempting desserts...

# Ambiance - the place is small yet well decorated and cosy to have a nice chat and enjoy your food at the same time .A maximum of 20 people can fit in easily..To be very honest the only reason we visit this place is to satisfy our sweet tooth.

# Service and Staff - Super courteous staff ,they would help you select the best according to your taste and wants.The service  pretty fast than what we had expected.

#Food- Coming to the best part , we decided to indulge ourself in

~ Classic Belgian - Oh god! these were the best waffles we have ever tasted . Waffles served with a whole lot of whipped cream  along with a serving of chocolate sauce ...it tasted like heaven!! 

~Caramel Pecans - we could not get over the waffles , so we decided to hog in some more waffles.. we ordered Caramel Pecan waffle. We loved the way they served it,, waffles topped with Pecans and a drizzle of caramel syrup..But since it was too sweet, we had to order vanilla ice cream separately , Trust us the ice cream made it taste super yummy..

~'The must have' - as the name suggests ," The must have " pancakes are a must for every pancake lover, The pancakes with maple syrup was lip smacking..they were soft and fluffy ..you could feel every bite melt in your mouth . 

#Pocket Pinch- Rs.680 approx (including GST)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†This place is definitely wort a visit, We keep going back to this place to put on some more calories. Interestingly,this place gives you a 10% discount on your bill after you have registered yourself with them.

Keep eating !! All the love ...

This small vegetarian cafe near forum mall is a hidden gem with hardly 7-8 tables (2 outdoor seating). This place is famous for waffles.
Apart from food, I liked the ambience and the service. The waiters there listen to you properly and best part, they leave you alone after serving you so that you can enjoy your meal. Though I'm not a sweet tooth, I still liked the restaurant.

Must try :
Dublin mudslide waffles.

I have been going to Piccadilly Square since my school days. This place has never disappointed me. My recent visit was on the 27.07.17. I went for breakfast along with a friend.
What we ordered blueberry pancakes and red velvet waffles with cream cheese.
The blueberry pancakes were yummy and I loved the blueberry sauce it was made just right not too sour not too sweet.
The red velvet waffles were made well, the vanilla sauce is too die for. By far the best vanilla sauce I have had in Kolkata. What I didn't enjoy was the cream cheese it was just too sour for my liking.
The service was prompt and the ambiance is wonderful. You can drop in here for some excellent food both in terms of quality and quantity.
Highly Recommended.

Accommodation isn't much, but in no way will you be disappointed with the place. 
I went here after college, for a quick breakfast, with few friends. 
We ordered for chocolate pancakes, Belgian waffles , waffle sandwich, popeye's pick.
All of the above were really tasty, and quality food. 
Pancakes and waffles are a must have here, and were crispy golden brown.absolutely loved them. 

Would love to come for a second visit! Cheers!

Walk into Piccadilly Sqaure and a typical European Interiored Cafe awaits. 
It serves irresistible range of pancakes, waffles, crepes, panini, etc. I've personally been there several times and each visit has been a delightful one.
The Red Velvet Waffles, Nuts about Nutella (crepe),
Chocolate Pancakes are worth a try. Apart from that the Pasta and Risotto are also very tasty.
The staff is very amiable and the service is also real quick.
A must try for everyone looking for some great European Food! üòä

Want to try the best waffle? Try the Belgian mudslide waffles over here. This is undoubtedly the best waffles, and my friends from Delhi went there every day as they couldn't find waffles like this in Delhi. The only negative point about this place is that its small and you might have to wait for some time for your seats. The food is vegetarian and the quality is amazing. Also ,they give 10% discount for your next visit.

Frankly I'm crazy about food in Kolkata. The puchkas, the sandwiches, the fried delicacies, the jhaal moori, the chana zor garam served warm at many signals, the dhabas and so on so forth. Where do I begin and where do I stop?
Anyways on one of my brunches over the weekend my friends and I got to this place and I was absolutely speechless by the food this tiny place served. We chose the seating outside and it was a bit awkward at first because they had to move a few chairs and tables to accommodate us. The sun was too bright for my liking and made the outside seating tiny bit uncomfortable for me. But honestly no one else had any complains so maybe just me ü§∑
We had the choco dazzle pancake, mad about mushroom crepes, voila veggie crepe, and nutella crepe with some coffee.
Each item tastes wonderful carefully twisted to suit indian palate. I especially enjoyed the savoury crepes so much that we had 3 Voila Veggies ordered. The sauce the roasted Veggies were perfectly wrapped in beautiful thin crepe. 
The dessert crepes were yummy as well but chocolate is chocolate. What's there to get wrong? 
I got in a food coma after this visit and hence only posted a review now. Kolkata Kolkata I'm yours Kolkata because, food üò¨

Went there yesterday evening. Rainy outside and a typical European kind of interior-ed cafe, what more can you ask for!?! We had jolly good fellow (croissant sandwich), the must have (pancake), pomodoro secco (pasta) and finally gelatin ice-cream. Each of these were equally well cooked, well presented, overwhelmingly tasty and a delight to have. This place has a rather short menu and not a very wide offering, but whatever they serve is just perfect. Loved the place! Conveniently located. Would surely go back again sometime!

This place is known for its desserts and what so ever you order, you'll want more of it later. 
Seating arrangement needs to be more spacious. 
Have ordered :-
1. Popeye's Pick - it was cooked just as it is described and tastes lovely. 
2. Blueberry pancake - It had blueberry sauce spread over the perfect pancakes.
Earlier have tried white sauce pasta, garlic bread and walnut brownie and waffles.
The food is always fresh and mouth watery.

One of the best dessert places in Kolkata. Can literally call it as the "Dessert Heaven". We ordered a Banana Crepe which was wonderfully garnished with Caramel and Creme. It was so delicious that we finished it in less than 5 minutes. Along we that we ordered for Al Funghi Pasta made with smooth mushroom sauce and sauteed mushrooms. The pasta was cooked well but the sauce wasn't very tasty. Next we ordered for the Hazel Heaven Waffles. The waffles were perfect. It had the right crunch and sweetness topped with chocolate sauce. Totally recommended to try these out, especially for the ones who has a sweet tooth.

The food at this place is excellent. However, I was shocked to learn on my visit here that they serve only vegetarian food. This is quite unacceptable and ridiculous in a city where the majority of the population comprises avid non-vegetarians. I think this restaurant must sell non-vegetarian food as well if it does not want to continue to lose out on a huge part of this prospective customers.

I have been visiting this place for quite some time and thought to review it after a recent visit. This place is one of my favorites in the city and never fails to amaze me. The ambiance is completely cosmopolitan and there is seating space outdoor as well. Foodwise their Waffles are well known and are a must have in case you visit. Chocolate Waffles and Chocolate Devotion from their menu are to die and kill for. In case you aren't too fond of desserts or feel too fed up of sweet items, try their salads or their sandwiches. All in all this place is a must visit for all!

Visited this place some days back. It is situated on Sarat Bose Road, near Forum Mall. I had heard about this place from quite a few of my friends and so I decided to check it out. We were in the mood for having some good old pancakes and so we ordered Blueberry Blast, and Choco Dazzle. Both were really good, and damn delicious. And we were still not full, and ended up trying the Alfredo Pasta as well which again was good. The staff were polite and service was prompt as well. Going by the quantity of food, the price might seem to a bit high but then again, when it comes to food, quality will matter more than quantity. Good experience overall.

I tried my favourite pasta spaghetti Alio olio.. quantity was good and it was delicious, lots of Italian places fail to get that authentic garlic and olive taste.

The must have is the Belgian waffle, I had it with their homemade chocolate gelato. It was scrumptious. This was the best waffle I have ever had...

Super happy .. made my evening :)

Piccadilly Square is a lovely little cafe on Lansdowne Road. It is situated on the left side of the road if you walk towards Minto Park. It has both indoor as well as outdoor seating. We chose to sit outside on a rainy evening and it was a beautiful experience. Loved their classic Belgian waffles and the little mushroom tarts. Their pour down coffee was great if you are a fan of filter coffee. The service was good. All in all a great experience. I always wish that cafes like these served non veg too, but that's just my personal choice.

Then Piccadilly Square Is one of the Best place to  cure Your Sweet Tooth. If you visit here make sure you try Dublin Mudslide Waffle‚ù§ One of their best Waffles . Ambience is quite good but they have a limited seating arrangement . If you are a group of 4-5 then its okay , anything above that make sure you make your reservation.

Piccadilly Square was a regular haunt for me once upon a time, long before I was hooked onto Zomato.... and I love their Belgian Waffles with thick chocolate sauce and whipped cream... It was a desert decadence worth the name... So if you love to stuff your face and fill your soul this is the ideal desert for you! I like their make your own sandwich too... With array of breads and fillings.. and their sweet and Savory crepes... Very French... Love the decor with old London cobble stone and gas lamp vibes... The sit out is nice for a cool evening too... Only drag is Lansdowne Road bustle. Only downer for me being a hard core carnivore is the place is vegetarian.... But their waffles are worth trying and I shall fight my demons and calorie counter and visit again soon!!! 

And I did visit again... Just yesterday and two things have stuck with me, how good the pour over coffee was, perfect for a rainy evening and how good the mushroom tart, a filo pastry bowl filled with creamy mushroom filling was just what was needed... the portion size of the Belgian waffles have been downsized... Which is a pity .. my best friend loved it and I wish there was more of it!!!!

Sun dried Tomato Risotto, Red velvet waffles and the maple syrup pancakes were definitely the highlight of the night. My sister always makes it a point to come to this place every time she is in Calcutta- and with good reason. Fantastic food, good service, what more can one ask for. The not so warm pancakes and the average focaccia sandwich could also not dampen our experience.

Visited Piccadilly Square today, well its a small vegetarian cafe which is located near The great booze story. Its a well decorated and a nice cafe, they serve European street food. I tried the al fredo pasta which came along with a bread, then i tried the chilli cheese panini sandwich which was amazing good and very much recommended. Tried the choco lave cake was well and it was delicious. Overall a good cafe but would be really nice if they include pizzas in their menu.

Love this place for its food and desserts. I've been a regular to Piccadilly square since it's inception. The menu gives you a wide range of variety from waffles to pancakes and pastas. Their desserts and sorbets are amazing. Must visit in the evening for board games with friends.
Strawberry waffle is yum. 
Seasonal - pizza fondue and chocolate fondue is yum. 
Tried their bananas and strawberry smoothie

Had gone there a few days ago after seeing a lot of people visiting there and sharing pictures on Instagram. The location and the ambience is great. The staff were courteous. We had ordered chilli cheese panini sandwich, caramel frappe, spaghetti aglio e olio and dublin mudslide waffles. 
-Chilli cheese panini sandwich was great. I loved it even though I am not a huge fan of cheese. Since I am a huge spicy food lover, I would have preferred it to be little more spicy but still it was a nice balance between cheesiness and spiciness.
-Caramel frappe was good but didn't feel anything very special about it.
-Spaghetti aglio e olio was something I loved there very much. Perfectly done pasta with perfect amount of garlic and topped with little parmesan. 
-The waffles were amazing. They were crunchy on the outside and didn't have any soggy insides, which I@ loved. Dubline mudslide will be perfect for you if you are a huge chocolate lover.
The only thing negative I can think about this place was the value for money. It is little on the pricier side. But other than that, it is a perfect place for breakfast or for casual evening meetings.

I wish I could  give a ZERO POINTER here.
We ordered a Sandwich and a Brocolli Risotto.

I had already enquired that the Sandwich would be one pc so no problem there.Nothing great as to how it tasted compared to when Picadally had opened.

Then comes the mood upsetter,the brocolli risotto, the quantity of it was around 4 spoons,the price of which was around Rs.300+ if we include taxes.
We called the server and he told that the quantity is alright according it their standards.

I CALLED THE MANAGER AND HE STARTED TO EXPLAIN ME THAT INTERNATIONAL CUSINES ARE SERVED IN LESS QUANTITY.
I ARGUED THAT THE COOK MUST HAVE BY MISTAKE MADE LESS QUANTITY.
BUT THE MANAGER PREFERED TO CANCEL IT AND TOLD HE CAN CANCEL IF I DONT WISH TO GO AHEAD.WHICH IN A WAY WAS A GOOD OPTION AS THERE WAS NO POINT SPENDING RS.300 FOR 4  BITES OF RICE.
THERE ARE MANY MANY PLACES IN KOLKATA WHICH SERVES TOP NOTCH RISOTTO AT SIMILAR HIGHER AND CHEAPER PRICES TOO.

BAD EVENING.

Heard of the piccadilly square so decided to try it for its pancakes.. i was absolutely craving them. So went there with my salad loving healthfreak of a husband. The place was easy to find. Service would hav√® been average if they were not burping behind the counters.. so poor really. We had cranberry pancake and greek salata. The taste was really good so points for that but.. the quantity was not enough for yhe price.. garnishing the pancakes would have been appreciated. The feta cheese was too little in the salad... all in all am not sure aboit going back. Points given for the taste of the individual dishes.

Located on Sarat Bose Road, Piccadily Square is a nice little cafe with a beautiful decor. The walls are lined with paintings of places from all over the world, that leaves the visitors guessing. The behaviour of the staff is good. I visited this place twice with my girlfriend. The first time, we ordered a Hazelnut Hot chocolate, a Classic Belgian Waffle and a Mad about Mushrooms Crepe. The hot chocolate was the best I'd had till date. Hands down! I went to this place for a second time just for this. The waffles were too disappointing. By no standards did they qualify as 'waffles'. The taste is bad, and so is the preparation. I would recommend not to go for the waffles here, as you'll burn a hole through your pocket and still be grossly dissatisfied. The crepes were more or less okay-ish, but they didn't go well with me. Perhaps it's my personal dislike for most crepes in general that made the taste worse. The taste was bland.
The second time I visited this place, we ordered the hot chocolate again, along with a chocolate truffle. Both were too delicious. Though the truffle wasn't extraordinary, and loads of other places offer way better ones, the one they served was too good ! And ah! The hot chocolate! I would die for it !!! I've given it a 3 rating just for it's hot chocolate and the decor!!!

The best place to have Italian in Kolkata.
The place is small, yet it's tasty as hell. One of my favorite places in the city. It's places like these which justify the tag of the "city of joy" for Kolkata, atleast in the food department.

Great Pancakes. Quick service. Worth the price. The place was completely full at 3.30pm on a Sunday afternoon.. what I liked the most was the generous quantity of chocolate syrup and maple syrup they serve with their pancakes.. usually cafes and restaurants don't show this amount of generosity on the syrups. Loved the food. Would go back soon for another bite.

My first visit here and was mightily impressed. Ordered a pasta, lemonade, croissant, pita chips and pancakes. No complaints about any of these.. What blew me away was that everything was on the table within 5-7 minutes of ordering. The pancakes with maple syrup were to die for. Went again the next day for them. This is one place that I'm gonna visit everytime I come to Kolkata. :)

Okay since this place isn't all brand new, I'm gonna cut short and introduce you to the gem-dish of this place: creme de la France. Ive been here a lot and tried many dishes, but this one dish keeps pulling me back to it. I purely dedicate this review to this mouthwatering pancake dish. Im sure people picture pancakes with maple syrup and end up ordering only that, or maybe chocolate pancakes. But oh my this dish is sure gonna help that sweet tooth of yours. PS: order extra whipped cream on top and separate chocolate sauce for that mesmerising experience :P

The place is a  sure hit among desert lovers! The salad was good but the dressing was not that appreciable!

We decided to have our dinner here and at first, we were a bit reluctant as this is a purely veg cafe. Being an avid zomato food reviewer, i decided to give this place a try and i was neither too Disappointed, nor extremely satisfied with this place. We ordered a bunch of items for two and the bill came around rs1600.

Situated next to technocity, Piccadilly square is a small cafe that provides both outdoor and inside seating. We were greeted and we decided to sit outside as it figured it would be easy for us to eat and smoke at the same time.

After taking our time looking at the menu, we decided to go for americano and hot chocolate for drinks. Actually we wanted to try hot vanilla but that was not available so we settled for hot chocolate. The drinks were nice and smooth but americano took a long time, probably about 20mins whereas the hot chocolate came in less than 5mins.

For food we ordered for aglio alio. This dish really disappointed us as it tasted blant, we were expecting better taste. Then we ordered for alfredo spaghetti. This one was delicious. We were still hungry so we ordered for mushroom risotto. Again, nothing special with this one. Then we ordered for focaccio bread with our own desired fillings and sauces. For the dessert, we ordered for velvety red waffles. This was the best part of the entire meal. I loved it.

I would probably visit this place again soon for the waffles.

If you are craving for some good food,  this should be your go to place! Crepes and sweet waffles are a must must try. Croissant Sandwich was a little disappointing but Crepes and Pasta made up for it. Parking near this place is a little troublesome. Visited this place quite a number of times now but still cannot get enough. The service provided is good too.

I tried Pomodoro Secco Pasta. It was really amazing. It tastes the best if had with just the sauce and no add ons. Service was fast. This place never disappoints me. A must visit for all the sweet tooth out there!

On of the few place where i love the pancakes.  

The creme de la france is my personal favorite. 
The vanilla sauce with pancakes is always a treat. 

The corn and veggie sandwich is also very fitting.  
Service was fast and attentive.

The waffles are amazing and considering Kolkata has  such less places serving waffles, it is a must try. However pancakes and shakes and savoury items are average. The blueberry pancake is not that good, very sour and does not go with a regular expectation of the pancake.

But they just refused to serve us cause we were a lil late. I could see ppl eating inside and u really requested to just serve us deserts. I really requested and told I hAve come all the way just to eat dessert and it's a bday. But they didn't budge. It was a really disappointment.

It is hard to find a themed dessert place contrary to the fact that Kolkata is laden with themed restaurants. Piccadilly square, a European styled cafe is a must visit for all the sweet tooth.

Outdoor seating under the shed is a unique experience and you would be hardly troubled by the onlookers. The indoor seating doesn't boast of a huge seating space but at the same time it isn't cramped given the fact that there are exactly 6 tables which can accommodate only 20 people at once. An overall pleasant d√©cor sums up for the simplicity of this place.

I haven't tasted any of the pastas or sandwiches, so I have rated this place on the basis of the desserts served here. Starting with the Classic waffles, the outlook of the dish is itself worth mentioning, whipped cream on top of the waffles with lots of chocolate peanut syrup. The waffles were well baked and tasted delicious with a tinge of salt in it. The caramel pecan is one of a kind, scrumptious and loaded with caramel, nuts and chocolate chips. The additional caramel syrup is all you need to quench your thirst for delicious waffles. The nut and nutella crepe was appetising and the decoration of it is worth of a picture.

It might feel a tad overpriced, but you won't leave unsatisfied.

Piccadilly Square is located on Elgin Road close to Bhawanipur College. The place has both open as well as internal seating. The ambiance is nice and this cafe is very popular among young crowds. You might have to wait during peak hours to get a seat. Also the traffic on Elgin Road might disturb few folks. 

We tried the Lemon Iced Tea and the Hot Chocolate. The Lemon Iced Tea was flavorful with right balance of sweet and lemon taste. The Hot Chocolate was also delicious and was perfectly sweetened. We tried the Mix Sauce Pasta (Al Arrabbiata + Alfredo) which comes with a piece of bread. The pasta was delicious and amazing. The pasta had loads of veggies. 

We then tried the Banana Cabana, which is a crepe topped with condensed milk and caramel and filled with banana. Now this is something no one could resist.

Started my Christmas eve with a supper at this outlet,  there was moderate rush than expected in the outlet. I visited this outlet after a gap of 3 years. The only thing that i remember from my last visit was popeye's pick, which was amazing. I ordered the same with Mad about mushroom, Alfreddo pasta and Bombay sandwich.

The cutlery they served with Popeyes pick is not the same as last time, the presentation was a set back and it tasted average.

Mad About Mushroom tasted awfully bitter and really bad choice of white sauce. It spoiled the whole thing.

Pasta Alfreddo: i would recommend the pasta alfreddo served here, probably the best pasta i have tried in months.

The Bombay sandwich tastes awful, very monotonous taste of green chutney, definitely not recommended.

The service was very poor, the food came early but i had to wait for about 15 minutes after i asked for water and then again for refill. Despite of any rush in the outlet and so many staff's the promptness of the service lacks.

Had a bad start to the Christmas evening, so I would give this place a pass for my future preference.

2 star just for the sake of pasta Alfreddo.

Piccadilly Square is one of the finest bakery within elgin area with large array of Italian cuisines. It is for vegetarians. After long time of planning we came here yesterday. Place was quite small. Service was pretty good.

Ordered Mixed Berries Shake and Chocolate Shake. Both were very good.

Also tried Spaghetti Al Fungi Pasta. It was so nice...

For the dessert we tried Blueberry cheesecake. Which was mouth melting and also tried pan flavoured popsicle along with coffee caramel popsicle.

Bill amount was 1018 with taxes. Pricing is little bit higher. But acceptable for that good quality food.

This joint of piccadilly is located at Sarat Bose Road, Opp Hindustan Club. It has a good ambience and one of the few that has an outdoor seating area. The food is great. I liked the chocolate fondue and chocolate pan cake.

This is a very known desert parlor, and has gained much name for their waffles and pan cakes. It has a small seating inside and open seating as well, which is very closed to the main road but soothing in winter mornings when traffic and on lookers are less. We tried this place by ordering Dublin mudslide waffle, the quantity was too less even for one, though it tasted well, but eating two pieces and paying Rs.265 is totally not value for money, as there was no hint of mudslide, just a well made waffle with choclate sauce and a scoop of choclate icecream. Will visit once again for pan cakes but I don't expect myself to become a regular here owing to such less quantity and totally no value for money.

If you want to have waffles, piccadily square it is. It was good to see that they have revamped the place and the menu. But we did miss some staples from the previous menu like the seasonal fruit waffle. We tried the new on menu- red velvet waffle and it was quite nice. The pasta however was not really great. Keep introducing more varities but at the same time, keep up the quality.

I had been here on my last trip to India over three years ago but since then they've renovated. We ordered the pesto pasta which was rich and filling. The mushroom crepe wasn't cooked all the way and had entirely too much creamy sauce drowned in it. For dessert we got the caramel pecan Belgian waffles which were the best out of the three, they were soft and I believe came with walnuts instead. They give you a coupon if you fill out a survey on their service for the next time you come back

I have been a regular at Piccadilly Square whenever I am in town. Earlier today evening, I planned to enjoy some good old crepes with an old friend.¬†

The favourite 'Mad about Mushrooms' was not available, and I had so settle for Popeye's pick. Disappointed.

While we completed our meal, a traffic sergeant came along and fined around 6 to 7 cars parked right up front. I asked the server if parking was forbidden off-late I was back in town after a while, and there were plenty of cars parked.¬†

He replied it was a 'No parking zone off late without sign boards'. On being asked why they didn't warn the regular visitors, the reply was a blunt - 'I didn't ask him earlier'.

You guys surely have put up notices for the 'new currency regulations', but this one I guess would have been detrimental to your footfall !!

This place has always been one of my all time favourites. Recently when I visited, I found many interesting additions on the menu. They have included Spanish and a bit of lebanese. Apart from this they have added new dishes. We ordered for pesto pasta - it was heavenly,  perfectly cheesy, perfectly herbed. We also ordered for Patata Bravas - it was a spicy and herbed potato dish and was yummy. The ice on the cake was the red velvet waffle with cream cheese. It was the best addition as per my taste buds. Can't wait to visit again.

Piccadilly Square is almost getting synonymous with waffles and so finally, I decided to give it a try. This outlet is situated few steps away from the Elgin crossing on Sarat Bose Road. The size is pretty small, and they have arrangements outside to provide for the lack of space inside. In spite of that, the decorations are sure to impress you. Trademark buildings of European cities adorn the walls, and the lighting provides a certain warmth for the perfect evening date. 

Baskets of freshly baked cookies and savouries are kept alongside the ones on display to lure you. Primarily, it is a vegetarian Cafe serving bakeries and desserts along with some really cool beverages to drown them with. 

With the main motive to spend a fun evening, I had gone easy on the food and ordered :
1. Hot chocolate : This tasted REAL good, and hot chocolate done right anyways gets bonus points from me. 
2. Classic Belgian Waffle : I have heard so much about the waffles in this place. However, the look itself is disappointing, let alone the taste. Probably, my expectations were set high, but in any case, it fails to do justice to the waffles even with the Vanilla Ice Cream that they serve alongside. 
3. Mad about Mushrooms Crepe : The crepes weren't as bad, but they sure didn't suit my palate much. They were soft, creamy and the filling was not done miserly. However, I found it too bland and no proper accompaniments to have it with. 

They have a lengthy menu with plenty of options left to try, but am probably gonna return only if someone offers to take me on a date and pay the bills.

Have been eating at this place for many years now.. First we used to go to the one in Alipore, and then to the one on Lansdowne Road.. My 11 year old Son, who is quite fussy about the food he likes, absolutely loves the Mad About Mushrooms Crepes and the Choco DYnamite.. What stands out is that you guys have maintained the same quality / taste over all these years.. Great job !!! Take a bow team Piccadilly Square !!!

So after ages of passing through saratbose road and staring at this cafe, i finally decided to get some pancakes and waffles packed one day. A quaint shop with an awning that gives it the look of an antique icecream shop. There are seats outside under the awning. Seating limited. About 15 people. The servers are really friendly. You can get pastas, risotto ,sandwiches ,crepes etc. They even serve their own gelato. I tried the choco dynamite waffle and choco dazzle pancake. The waffle though expensive, 200 rs for two quarters , was heavenly. The pancakes were delicious too. Hope to have waffles here again.

I heart Piccadilly specially for a brunch date.
It is so classic with a small space with such classy interiors and vintage hues. I totally love the feel to be at Piccadilly. The staff is great and very cooperative. Service is excellent. And food is God. 
Waffles are so yumm and I love the huge bowl of decadent Chocolate Sauce paired up with it. My goto waffle places in the city.
Popeye's pick is one of the best spinach corn crepe in the city.
My new favorite was the chocolate crepe. It was so amazing. The hot chocolate inside with the ice cream on top contrasted so well. It was a gluttony affair.

4/10 on the whole for me.

This a unique restaurant. A plethora of choices is available for everyone and I am sure you will not be able to make up your mind easily as everything on the menu is brilliant. The food is great and made me feel like I was in Europe. I tried the waffles and pancakes and they were great. The best thing about their food is that they serve the food of different countries in just the same it is done in their native places.
I would recommend you to not try the French food although that is my own personal choice.

The restaurant is one of kind!!Everything we ordered was really good. This is a must try. I guess its one of a kind in the city. Hope to get back here pretty soon as the food was awesome as well was the staff, atmosphere and ambiance.I have never been to anything like this... The menu is so very confusing that even after having a look at the menu for an hour you would hardly be able to guess what to order. We went there as it was a friend's birthday treat and there was one girl in the group who had been here before with another guy who had been here. So the best way to go here is with someone who has already been there. I would have listed the names that we ordered but I forgot them the second I stepped out. You can view my pics to get a better idea. In the end I would surely recommend everyone to try this atleast once and believe me you wont be disappointed.

Thus restaurant gives a nice European cafe kind of feeling. It is very small with hardly 4 tables . We ordered one choco dazzle pancake , one savoury waffle by the name "say cheese" , a cranberry delight and a lemon cheesecake. 

The pancake was absolute delight for chocolate lovers. It was soft , perfectly shaped and with lots of chocolate sauce. The waffle was complementing the pancake with a salty and cheesy flavour with lots of corn.

The cranberry delight was refreshing and the lemon cheesecake was one of the best I ever had.

Overall a nice , bit overpriced place with a nice ambiance and  friendly staff.

This place has been long due on my list. Good that I finally made it today. A pretty warm place. Nice and soft people around.

Viva Italia sandwich was quite delicious. The dark mocha frappe was okay, not something that I would like to order again. 

The best was for the last, the Dublin Mudslide, one chocolicious dessert that completely made me fall in love with this place. This one is definitely going to take me there again. :)

If there's one place that NEVER disappoints it has to be this cute warm joint close to forum. It scores on every front, the food is greaaaat, the ambience is nice and the service is pretty good too. The menu is vast enough for a hungry stomach ranging from salad to crepe to pasta to waffle. My personal favorites are corn a la mode and classic Belgian and those are two things I can finish all by myself. The waffles are the best I've ever had, just the right amount of sweet for me. I think they can possibly work on the beverages as I've never quite liked whatever I've tried. The flavour of chocolate in the shake isn't exactly appealing to my taste buds. Gelato is great again. Salad is really nice too, quite contrary to my belief of healthy can't be tasty. The mixed sauce penne pasta was the best I'd ever had the first time I tried it but I'd like to mention it's not very consistent but not like I can complain. The prep time is very short which is great when you're hungry. If I have to choose a place to go to when I'm not in the mood to try anything new, it is my first choice. It leaves you satisfied and you don't end up spending too much. Not quite sure this review would be helpful to many locals as most people would've already had an experience but if you're new in Calcutta and not sure where to go, you must try this place.

It's definitely better to visit the restaurant and have the same food. Tastes amazing in the restaurant. But if you are really craving Popeye's Pick and can't make it to the restaurant, ordering for delivery is worth a try!

Small nice and cozy place located close to forum mall. Nothing much to talk about as far as the ambience is concerned. However the quality of the food is what stands out. It is a cafe and hence the menu is designed accordingly. They serve one of the best waffles in the city and when you combine that with the bowl of chocolate sauce that comes along, well it is difficult to describe in words! Simple amazing. Coffee is also good. The pricing is also right and explains why it is frequented by students. This one is a must visit!

This is like a bit of a cafe in Europe where you'd go to grab a coffee, or on a quiet date. Nice, wrought iron lamp posts give you a feel of the typical European cities. We ordered the classic pancake with chocolate sauce, a savoury waffle dish called "Say Cheese", a lemon cheese cake, and a cranberry drink.
The pancakes were really nice. Thick, soft and sweet, generously drizzled with chocolate sauce. Since I am not a huge fan of chocolate, I really can't do the dish justice..
"Say Cheese" was a wonderful dish. Warm waffles, with a cheddar dip and a side of corn kernels covered in cheese. This was one of the best dishes I ever had. And the corn side was love.
The lemon cheesecake was definitely the best I had. Luscious, creamy, just the right amount of sweetness, with a sweet biscuit base. There was a gentle hint of lemon, and the lemon zest was the final touch. A perfect dish. I am enclosing a picture of the perfect profile of the cheesecake.
The cranberry drink was refreshing. Sweet and tangy, it was a real treat!
Slow service, a bit overpriced, but friendly staff. And very very nice food.

Just visited this place after a tiring day and could say that the food at this place will bring an end to one's exhaustion.Now commenting on other things briefly-

SERVICE-The service at this place is good.Though the staff was quite unresponsive but the food service was fast.Once the staff serves you he is ignorant about any other thing.

AMBIANCE-The ambiance at this place is soothing and calm.The place has good interiors but the seating area is too small to cope with.

Food-The food they serve is finger-Licking but quite heavy on pocket.We tried a few of them-

1:Al pesto
2:pizza con pesto
3:Cheese and garlic on toast
4:Classic belgian waffle
Among them "Classic belgian" is a must try.

Piccadilly Square....the name says a lot about this small little place. There is very limited seating inside the AC part of the restaurant. Though there are a couple of chairs and tables outside they aren't a good option in the hot and humid weather prevailing here most of the year. Even in winter it won't appeal because it's situated on a busy and noisy road.  Inside it was a cosy atmosphere and the service was pretty quick. Loved their Popeye's Pick....which was a savoury crepe of spinach and corn and doused in cream cheese. Tasty. The salad was especially good with an abundance of freshness and dressing was spot on. Not too much of it and the crunchiness made it great. I didn't like their toasted sandwich....it was ordinary. But the meal ended on a high with their chocolate swirl cheese cake. It was just YUM. The drinks, Summer Tang and Cool Off, were excellent,fresh and refreshing. But the Peach Ice tea needed a little more of peach flavour. The portion sizes are small probably in keeping with European style, so it seems to be a little overpriced. But overall a tasty and good food experience.

An absoltute delight for sweet-tooths everywhere.
An ideal breakfast place. The food here is yummy.

The chocolate pancakes here are heavenly and the cookies and pastries are also delightful.
The ambience is also nice compared to how small the place is and the service is brilliant.

Picadilly Square is one of those extra special outlets you should cherish with all yoir heart and every single time.

Piccadilly Square is without a doubt one of the best places in Kolkata to have Vegetarian Continental food!

They are open for breakfast from 8am on weekends, and we ended up here for just the same last Sunday. Our order was pretty much fixed from hearsay and our previous visits, but nonetheless, the breakfast was pretty magnificent - as expected!

They have two tables outside and few others inside...it is not a very big place in size. We sat outside. The cloudy morning, light morning traffic and people slowly starting their day on the street beside made the whole experience quite spectacular! It felt quite like how you see in movies and rarely get to witness in real life. 

We ordered Cappuccinos, Popeye Crepe, Al Pesto Pasta and Chico Dazzle Pancakes. And they all were spectacular! You could taste freshness in them. Service also was quick. My personal favorite was the crepe - corn and spinach with sinful amounts of cheese, literally! But I'd have hated myself to not have the fluffy pancakes with chocolate syrup on top, and extra syrup on side... Or the cheesy pasta with a crisp bread to its side. You can order here anything and I bet you'd end up feeling ecstatic!

One of my favorite places in Kolkata! Its not much heavy on your pocket either. You must visit here - no second thoughts! :-)

One of the tucked away and under rated place of Kolkata. The food is just to die for and so is the management as in such a small place with kitchen in front they manage to make a lot of stuff and in a very very short span of time.

The sweets are to die for specially the wafers and also the savory crepes. Never attempted to try anything else and always stick to their specialities of Popeyes pick, Mushroom crepe and everything sweet.

Wanted to try the Popsicle and ice cream but somehow they did not look very appetizing so did not attempt. 

All in all a very very quick and hearty meal that makes you happy.

as suggested by the name, find the London in Kolkata decor. food is good, but on the expensive side. i think this is to keep up the London imageüòã. i don't like the location. its a very busy crossing area for a cafe like this. it should have been at a relaxing surrounding. the open air seating doesn't make sense because of the immense hustle bustle of the place. being at a busy place, there's lot of pollution, noise and crowd. this doesn't justify an outside seating from cleanliness & hygiene point of view.

This would definitely be one of the most tucked away and underrated places in Kolkata. It is just a bunch of tables placed around a bakery. The food variety and quality is amazing and you would be surprised at the huge variety served by such a small place. The service is super fast. It is one of those places where you rush in, grab a meal and walk out. They definitely can work more on expanding the place and would surely like to see more outlets for this gem of a bakery.

Shangri la for sweet lovers... if you have to satisfy your craving for sweets, you cannot and should not skip this place. The hot gooey chocolate lava cake with strawberry jam and vanilla ice-cream is a pure indulgence. The contrast of hot lava cake with the cool dollop of vanilla ice-cream and strawberry jam is a pure bliss. Their waffles and pan cakes are also I can say the best i had in this city.. However, since the place is really really small , with limited seating arrangement so time and again one might find oneself waiting outside..but it's totally ok coz its absolutely worth it !

A good offering and a nice approach to the classics, waffles and pancakes do justice to its name, and the classics one are a must try, the classic waffle with whipped cream, and their classic pancake. The disappointment was their dark frappe, an absolute flop, this needs a huge uplift. I'll surely return for waffles though. Cheers

Previously I had given this place a 4 because it used to be an old favourite. Today I went back for the sake of nostalgia and the experience I had was shocking. I will give only one example. The waiters here are the rudest waiters I have ever seen in any restaurants. I asked one of them whether there was a parking he replied 'There is no parking and we have no idea where people who come here park their cars' in the rudest manner possible. I would request the management to look into this because they lost a loyal customer for sure. I hope they don't lose anymore.

If you are looking for great desserts then this is the place. They have different types of amazing item to satisfy your taste buds. They also have Italian cuisines but we went there for desserts. This joint is not too big but they have both inside and outside seating arrangements. Staffs are extremely courteous. Coming to desserts we tried their black forest cheese cake which was great and chocolate dynamite which was absolutely amazing. Visiting this place again for the love of waffles. Foodies, you should definitely try this one.

I could see mostly it was full with student crowd.Coming to food they have many varieties of waffles ,pancake, pasta, crepe ,desert and beverages . I ordered there coffee and creamy mushroom waffle and both were awesome. Last but not the least there was service was awesome and quick

The home of European street food, from pancakes to waffles this place just transports you to the busy European Streets. A cosy joint situated in Elgin Road baking all things beautiful.
A dream joint for all those who holds a sweet tooth. 
I highly recommend you try their Cr√®me De La France if you are craving pancakes and the Belgian Mud slide if you prefer waffles.
Piccadilly happens to be a Vegetarian's Paradise, from sandwiches to salads and from pastas to burgers you get the best of what vegetables has to offer on your plate.

Just a hangout to catch up with people in Kolkata and they took me to this place. Small but really good.
The service (4.0) was great and friendly. Have not seen many places where people really ask about the food quality,  taste and service.
The caramel with coffee was good, not very fond of caramel though, virgin mojitos  (4.0) was refreshing and had a good taste of mint, hot chocolate was good, pie with blueberry was good for those who like the taste, the item in grey with mushrooms was fine (2.0) but the highlight rather showstopper was the waffle with cream and chocolate sauce  (4.5) well the rating says it all.
A must try with friends and cousins!!!

I love this place so much. Th waffles, the pasta everything is so yummy. My favorite waffle is the "Season's Surprise". 
I got to have the strawberry one. And it was the best. Pretty looking. So many strawberries they gave and all strawberry were a combination of sweet and sour. I loved it. 
Then once i had the "Classic Belgian". Loaded with chocolate syrup! This one is also a definite try. 
"Al pesto" pasta was so very yummy. Juicy and flavoured. Loved it. 
In drinks i had the "Virgin Mojito" and "Cranberry Craze". 
Cranberry craze was besttt!

We had plan to visit this place for quite sometime, a minutes walk from rabindra sadan metro. The place transports you to a europian street caf√©. With indoor and outdoor seating facilities, the number of seats available are very less epecially if you are planning to go with a large group of people. We ordered aglio olio, mushroom and cheese , choco dazzle and a smoothie. The quantity is quite less but the food tastes awesome....My personal favourite choco dazzle just melted in the mouth. A great place to spend an evening with friends. !

My visit to this Piccadilly Square, located in Elgin Road, was a few days back on a Sunday evening. The cafe is indeed small as it houses only a couple of tables and chairs in the indoor part which is air conditioned and another 3-4 tables and some chairs on the outside on the footpath at a region, which probably belongs to the store.

It is an absolutely remarkable experience to 
have -
‚Ä¢	 Stuffed mushrooms ‚Äì It was more like a cheese ball with a soft mushroom in it. The balance between the crispy crust and the soft mushroom was exquisite.

‚Ä¢	Garlic Mayo

‚Ä¢	Corn-a-la-mode

‚Ä¢	Choco dynamite waffles - The classic warm waffles with choco chips and chocolate sauce. Waffles at Piccadilly Square are surprisingly both soft and crispy, and these were no exception. We were also provided with a cup filled with all-time favorite Choco sauce.

‚Ä¢	All arrabbiata Pasta (cold Salsa dip, Mayonnaise) - Pasta is better than most cafes

‚Ä¢	Mixed Sauce Pasta

Suggestions: 1. The staff here could be slightly more interactive and attentive.

2. The portion size is quite small in proportion to the price charged, and it would be nice to amend the serving sizes to a feasible degree. 

I love Piccadilly Square for its good food, cozy ambiance and reasonably quick service. The waffles here are absolutely the best!

At the end of each visit, you are provided with a tablet to note down your feedback and I am glad that Piccadilly Square has taken this initiative. But above everything else, the food here is the chief reason that drives me to this place time and again.

Tiny little place in Sarat Bose Road this place is a gem for dessert lovers. It is an absolutely remarkable experience to sip hazel nut coffee and read a novel sitting by the window overlooking the busy road outside( or so I've been told by a friend) üòú I love love love the Oreo cup cakes, nutella pancakes and waffles here. Hazelnut and chocolate shake is sheer brilliant as well. The sandwiches are okay, could be better ( barring the cheese and mushroom sandwich - coming from a hard core non vegetarian like me, please realize how good it is). üòÇ The staff is well behaved and hygienic. The possible drawback of this place is the space. Very tiny place, can barely accommodate 15 people inside. There are a couple of chairs outside but in a humid summer day that is not an option. In general it's a nice place to stop by and grab a bite ( soothe your sweet tooth) üòâ

My visit to Piccadilly Square was a few days back. I wanted to visit this place since quite some time. And finally one day after giving my exam, I landed here. It was a rather odd time around 12 so the place was not crowded and I got a seat inside. I had ordered the chocolate waffles. I don't remember the name but yes, I definitely remember that it tasted really amazing! I loved the crispy waffles with the decadent chocolate sauce and the creamy ice cream! It was definitely a cracker dish. The price was perhaps a bit high but the food didn't disappoint at all! The staff is also quite courteous which is an added bonus. 
I do recommend this place to all people. Everyone should try this place for a quick bite whenever you find yourself around Minto Park.

Piccadilly Square, located in Elgin Road, is a common favourite on the virtue of its vegetarian delicacies, sweet and savoury waffles, as well as the soft and fluffy pancakes. It is spread over a small space (landmark: The Great Booze Story) and despite the obvious parking issues, Piccadilly Square continues to remain popular enough to be crowded at all points of time. 

My orders:

ÔÅ∂	Golden Moments Waffles: I have relished this dish only twice but I can never forget the delicious taste of these sweet waffles with butter and honey. The waffles were terrific in making, and yes, a little bit of heaven oozed out of my every bite. 

ÔÅ∂	Blueberry Blast Pancakes: A must try for blueberry lovers, the Blueberry Blast is an utter delight! The pancakes are soft and filling, and the generous sprinkling of blueberry compote is a pure blessing. 

ÔÅ∂	Savoury Waffles with Vegetable Ratatouille: Somehow the vegetable ratatouille was not as relish-worthy as we had expected it to be. The waffles, of course, were amazing in taste.

ÔÅ∂	Cake Pops: We had chocolate cake pops, which were good, but tasted slightly stale in my opinion. 

ÔÅ∂	Vegetable Sandwich: This is a decent choice to be had with either white or brown bread. 

ÔÅ∂	Savoury Potato Crepes: This one is for the potato lovers ‚Äì it is light, well-made and delightfully bland. 

ÔÅ∂	Dublin Mudslide: Quite a beauty in appearance, the Dublin Mudslide is one of the most sought after menu items at Piccadilly Square, and rightfully so for the waffles come with chocolate ice cream and ample amounts of chocolate sauce.  

ÔÅ∂	Savoury Belgium Waffles with Vegetables: Waffles at Piccadilly Square are surprisingly both soft and crispy, and these were no exception. I could mostly detect the taste of zucchini and broccoli, and I am not complaining!

ÔÅ∂	Walnut Freddo Gelato: Interestingly, the walnut freddo with vanigilla gelato served with a shot of espresso consisted of the most satisfactory portion size in the restaurant. This coffee dessert could have been a little more satiating if it contained a little more coffee and a little less number of walnuts. Still, gelato is gelato. 

Suggestions/Feedback:

ÔÅ∂	The menu card on Zomato needs to be updated as it does not contain a lot of items on the actual menu. 

ÔÅ∂	It would be a good idea to highlight the location as Piccadilly Square is very easy to pass by. 

ÔÅ∂	While it is not possible to magically expand the seating area, if feasible, it would be great to have a separate branch of this restaurant in some other part of the city as well. 

ÔÅ∂	The staff here could be slightly more interactive and attentive. 

ÔÅ∂	The portion size is quite small in proportion to the price charged, and it would be nice to amend the serving sizes to a feasible degree. 

Verdict: 

I love Piccadilly Square for its good food, cosy ambiance and reasonably quick service. The waffles here are absolutely the best! At the end of each visit, you are provided with a tablet to note down your feedback and I am glad that Piccadilly Square has taken this initiative. But above everything else, the food here is the chief reason that drives me to this place time and again.

A place for waffle lovers. I am not the one into it. But I would recommend this place only for those who loves chocolate crapes. Coffee is average, no comparison to  Q33 at quest mall. 

Staff is very courteous. This place give good vibe.

Craving to indulge my sweet tooth I came to this place randomly after checking it on zomato that they serve variety of European desserts.It's a quaint little cafe near forum mall.The decor matched perfectly with European bistro style and music that was being played here was very soothing too.They have options of outdoor seating too but I avoided it because of scorching heat in Kolkata now.Since its a purely vegetarian cafe,being a hardcore non-vegetarian I didn't look at the savoury dishes on offer and went straight into the dessert section.I ordered a plate pancake "The must have" and classic beligian waffle.

"The Must Have" pancake-It had 2 pancakes served with a small bowl of maple syrup to drizzle it on the pancakes as u wish.Pancakes with maple syrup-Classic combination.Piccadilly square didn't go a bit wrong with this.The pancakes were best I ever had.They were so soft and fluffy.They don't even need the knife to cut them..just gliding the fork through it will be enough.The maple syrup went perfectly with it.

Beligian classic waffle-It had 2 mini sized waffles filled with chocolate syrup,topped with whipped cream and also chocolate syrup drizzled all over.In this dish too small bowl of molten hot chocolate syrup was served which was like cherry on cake for chocolate lovers like me.Waffles were fresh,warm and crisp and combining it with warm chocolate syrup and whipped cream..it was pure bliss in my mouth.
The only downside I felt that the portion of waffle was too small for the price they charge.

I'm going to come back here for the sake of their amazing pancakes and other sweet treats. :)

I am not sure why this place is rated so high at Zomato. Seeing the sudden craze and flurry of positive reviews which has been passed, I decided to hit the place yesterday. Finding this place wasn't difficult as Zomato came to my rescue. Located very close to Deli Cravings and at a stonethrow distance from 'The Great Booze Story', this a small cafe tucked on the main road.

The cafe is indeed small as it houses only a couple of tables and chairs in the indoor part which is air conditioned and another 3-4 tables and some chairs on the outside on the footpath at a region, which probably belongs to the store. Since the inside was full, I decided to sit outside and this is when reality dawned upon me. I was given the menu card and decided to opt for Dublin Mudslide. A patient wait of 5-7 minutes, and the waffle would arrive.

The first look was beyond disappointment. Two small portions of waffles, topped with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and accompanied by chocolate sauce. And this costs Rs. 200+? (Rs. 210 to be exact). You have a cafe charging not so economical price, a good premium price if could be to the point, and you simply place some tables and chairs right on the edge of the main road where a bus or a couple of cars passes by every 5-10 seconds? Publicity is one thing and completely exposing your customers offering them no privacy and yet charging them like moneylenders is a different and despicable game altogether. Atleast, you could have had constructed some shades, so that only the entrance is seen and rest of the portion remains concealed from the outside. If I wanted to have waffles like this, I could have had done it in much less a price at a place nearby home where the decor and ambiance matches the price and with the food quality!

The staff here needs training as well. Once they serve the order, they are like gone forever. Am not sure what good does the CCTV cameras serve. I literally kept staring at one of those for a couple of minutes once I was done with food and no one came up to me. I had to walk up, stand like a dumb person infront of the entrance gate trying to grab attention of one of the captains to ask for the bill!

Now, here comes the most interesting part. Although, I do not possess the bill with me right now, I remember having been billed a total of Rs. 253/- (On the menu price of Rs. 210). This means a tax of 20.476 percent in total, again implying levy of VAT + Service Tax. I was clearly seated at the Non-AC portion, taking in all the dust, heat and unwanted attention. Either the restaurant fails to demarcate between their AC and Non-AC enclaves or the waiters were not trained enough about the government circulars! Conclusively, am not going to drop by here again!

Picadilly Square - Loosing it's charm.
=====
Intro:

It is not really difficult to locate. It is not far away from the famous hot spot for the time being 'The Great Booze Story'. I had been here with one of my friend and i know i am late coming here. I thought this picadilly is going to be huge but somehow when i entered inside, i found around 4-6 tables to accommodate. Nevertheless, that's not an issue though. It was full when i came here and somehow after 5-10 minutes, i got to grab a seat. I had been to the Alipore one so if you compare the ambiance of the outlets, the Alipore one was way way better. Nevertheless, i was served the menu and began scrolling.
=====
What i had here:-¬†

‚Ä¢ Virgin Mojito - One of the worst i have ever had. It was more like mint leaves topped on top with a syrup. No brown sugar nothing. I felt it was waste of money for me.¬†

‚Ä¢ Ratatoullie With Waffles and Orange Mayo - I personally liked this one. That's why my mood got elevated here a bit. The Mayo is really good. The best way to eat it is spread the mayo on top of waffles, place the veges/ratatoullie and then, again place some more mayo. Trust me, you would love it. ¬†‚úå‚ù§

‚Ä¢ Belgian Chocolate Waffles - If you are a chocolate lover, you cannot miss this. The whipped cream on top along with extra chocolate sauce to add on. #purebliss ‚ù§‚ù§
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Location.
‚Ä¢ Brand Value.
‚Ä¢ Pure Vegetarian
‚Ä¢ Good Hospitality. Courteous staffs.

Cons:
‚Ä¢ Mojito disappointed me big time.
‚Ä¢ The menu card handed over to me was torn. If you are earning so much money, i bet you can fix at least this much? the least to expect. First impression always matters.¬†
‚Ä¢ Prices are on the elevated side.

Meal for two 700-1000 max.

Oh how I live this place :) a small cafe done up simply, with an outdoor seating. The food is amazing... From the Popeyes pick, to sandwiches to the strawberry waffles to the spaghetti agli o olio and the cheesecakes to the salads... They are flawless! I don't like their service, the staff attitude pisses me off always. But I can't stop going on here :)

After shopping, my friends and I were looking for some cafe to sit and chitchat when we thought of going back to Piccadilly Square. I have always loved their Popeye's pick. So we called for that along with hot chocolate and chocolate shake. The hot chocolate and chocolate shake tasted disgusting. There was something wrong with the milk or some other ingredient. Though after our feedback they changed both our beverages but it still tasted horrible. Popeye's pick was well made and tasted how it used to taste always. Waiters were courteous and friendly. But this place has lost its charm.

So, I revisited this place and this time I was surprised with really good mushroom items. I thought of changing my review since I was little disappointed last time. This time I was happy and good food is always appreciated. Place is nice, service is good. Desserts are good. Hop in if you are nearby. 
Eat and be merry.

Piccadilly Square had been on my priority list of restaurants to visit for a long time now, and finally had the chance of stopping by this place today along with couple of friends. The craftily written title and woven seats on the outside are surely to attract you. Stepping inside you‚Äôll find brick flooring and the interiors done to replicate a British bistro on the streets of Kolkata. However it‚Äôs a bit cramped for space with only about 4 tables inside and a couple of them outside.

The food here is treasured by all who are regulars here. The main reason being the wide variety of items their menu has to offer. You can never stop loving them. The pancakes and waffles are the most famed savouries here, so we decided to go for the same.
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Belgian Blast : These were ‚Äò‚Äôthe most amazingly soft‚Äô‚Äô pancakes I have ever had in the city. Didn‚Äôt even have to chew through them or even use a knife to cut. A gentle slice with the fork was all that was needed. Also a great combination with blueberry sauce poured heartily all over.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Choco Dynamite : The classic warm waffles with choco chips and chocolate sauce. Since they were baked just for the right time, they were ‚Äò‚Äôcrunchily soft‚Äô‚Äô. We were also provided with a cup filled with all time favourite choco sauce.

The service is also a plus point being real quick. The staffs are well aware of the items on the menu and so can help you out in picking most suitable dishes. The pocket pinch is a concern for people with limited means.

Located in Landsdowne, Piccadilly Square serves some of Calcutta's best breakfast food. The place is comfortable and cosy, with an option for outdoor seating. The food is simply outstanding. Popeye's Pick, Mad about Mushrooms and corn crepes rule the savoury menu while the Belgian chocolate and season's special waffles are to die for. The pasta is decent while the cake pops are a delight for kids and adults both. It is definitely a must-visit.

A lovely evening spent with friends at this cozy little place on Elgin road.The cafe is small but very cozy and the staff is very courteous. We ordered for a three refreshing mocktails and to be honest they were absolutely yummuylicious. Cranberry craze, icy blueberry and hazelnut frappe. I so wanted to order one more just having a sip at the cranberry craze. Next comes the food.We started with Aglio olio. The pasta was dry and lacked flavour . The came the grilled potatoes which was yummy but the portion was very small for even two people. The mushroom and cheese sandwich should have more filling. It semmed dry.Finally all the complaints were forgotten when the chocolate pancake with hot chocolate drizzled over. It was delicious and we almost fought over the last bite. ¬†I was expecting a better job from Piccadilly .There is still room for improvement on the savoury side but when it comes to my sweet tooth .......yummylicious

Went to this place recently with my friend, upon his recommendation. It was kinda sad that I missed such a lovely place even after covering so many places. There are scores of ppl who are still unaware of this lovely place. The ambience was great, ideal for a lazy weekend culinary treat. We had Popeye crepe, blueberry blast pancakes, stuffed mushrooms and some earl grey tea.

Popeye crepe: the presentation was lovely. It had a lovely combo of spinach n corn in a soft crepe covering. The distinct flavour was that of the cheese sauce on the top with a light sprinkle of oregano.

Stuffed mushroom: it was more like a cheese ball with a soft mushroom in it. The balance between the crispy crust and the soft mushroom was exquisite.

Blueberry blast: one of the softest pancakes iv had in my life, with a perfect uniform texture throughout, on top of which is poured a blueberry sauce with blueberries too! A touch too sweet thou.

Earl grey tea: iv had the twinnings earl grey tea earlier, but this had a slight flavour of elaichi too, I guess they added their own unique touch to it.

Pros:
1. Very tasty food.
2. Lovely presentation
3. Friendly staff and great ambience
4. Pocket friendly

Cons:
1. It's inconspicuous . I passed by that road for 3 years without noticing this place.
2. No parking in front. I guess there is a Rs 100 fine waiting for me at Kolkata police site.

Must try items:
Popeye crepe, thou my friend suggests the mushroom crepe is way better. Blueberry pancakes

I was attracted to this place primarily because of the name. And I was not disappointed. This is a delightful small joint that serves refreshing snacks. We had the blueberry blast pancakes....yummmm! It was just too good. Then we had stuffed mushrooms, they were served hot and the taste was good. Finally we had green apple lemonade and it was extremely refreshing. Recommended for having a small get together with nice baked food and desserts.

Chocolate and cheese are the two things discovered by mankind that are closest to heaven. Picadilly Square happens to be an expert on both of them.It's an all time favorite place of me and my friends.The beautiful patio outdoor with seating arrangements gives the feel of some distant country! Service is always prompt and good. Now coming to food, the celestial chocolate french crepes,the blueberry cheesecake, the pancakes,the waffles are simply heavenly. The fudge brownie with thick, gooey delicious chocolate sauce is a sin to miss out on. Even their hot chocolate and mocha makes you weak! They have plenty of both sweet and savory options. Will visit again and again :)

I have eaten here quite a few times and my experience is fine. But I am writing here only because today I felt irritated at the staff. If ur not gonna accept don't ask for reviews either. After I gave my feedback one staff member kept on coming back to me asking y is not that nice and started explaining difference between saut√© and frying food. What is called what as if I have come to eat for the 1st time. Just so you know we eat at the best of eateries n hotels. It was very irritating to continuously tell him what I meant . Tossed onions and zucchini are NOT black and soggy if I am correct.

We were here about a month ago having brunch. We ordered a mad about mushroom crepe, a sweet Caribbean breeze crepe and a potato waffle sandwich. The food came well presented and all three were delicious. The mushroom crepe was exceptionally good as they were generous with the mushrooms in the creamy, mushroom sauce. The strawberry and white chocolate sauce complimented well in the crepe and a great way to finish the savoury meal. I also had a ginger and lime cooler... It was fabulously refreshing! Having lived and travelled around Europe, this place has done a great job with their menu creativity and selection. One thing to note is that the menu is more extensive in the caf√© than online and portion sizes are not overly big. However that wouldn't stop me going back again... soon!

This is undoubtedly one of the best places to savor desserts. Sweet and sumptuous, the decor, just like desserts.
Been there once, but I guess that's enough to pin a review 'bout it.
Varieties of items, swinging from France to England to Belgium cuisine.
Coming to the point.
We had Crem√© De La France, tune in to the colorful sprinkles over pancakes.
Popeye's Pick, remember the days I watched 'Popeye- The Sailor Man', I got a feeling. xD Spinach and sweet corn inside the crepe.
Chocolate fountain, two choco-lava cakes accompanying a sweet pink strawberry scoop of ice-cream. Yes. It's delicious.
And Caribbean Breeze, pineapples and crepe. A tastebuds-tingler.
Well there's no doubt I'm gonna barge into this place again. And they play such good music, this really gets them extra brownie points.
Oh, did I mention, the place really gives off a happy vibe ? :)

Wow.  First time here.  Was looking for a place with more than decent frapp√©s. But when I saw it,  not again ! The search for excellent frapp√©s continues then.  But then I laid my eyes on the waffle menu -  and oh boy,  couldn't take my mind off them ! Amazing taste,  extremely delicious and wonderful presentation.  Piccadilly won my heart for this.
Pocket pinch is worth it for most items. The outside seating area is quite good.  Although a small place,  you would still enjoy here.  Not really a place for groups,  but this place is perfect for those flocking lovebirds who just wanna have good food and some fun. Don't judge me :3

I dropped n at Piccadily Square today. The place is delightful. I love the popeye's pick(crepe) and creme De la france. The crepes here are irresistible. A small place but with amazing food. They have outdoor seating too. Ambience is good. Pocket pinch is fine. Overall an amazing experience.

The place is delightful ! Perfect place if you love the tag "Sweet tooth". The waffles are supposedly the best and the tag was justified. The milkshakes were amazing too! Searching for waffles? Where else do you go !

Piccadilly square is one of my all time favourite restaurants, inspite of it being vegetarian. I love the Popeye's pick and the Dublin mudslide. The cr√™pes and waffles here are irresistible. On a recent visit I tried the chocolate fondue and it was a true blue sinful delight. Loved it. The decor of the place is also pretty nice and had an English feel to it. Not too expensive. Must visit. Only downside is that it is a vegetarian place.

International tourists beware!

The sandwich was fine and passable-  but as an international tourist, I found myself not able to use my US credit cards.   I was forced to use my cash -  which I try to limit for safety. 

The service was fine and the manager was apologetic-  but why put pictures of Britain and Paris on the walls of you want accept their money?

Updated: ¬†While I didn't get a resolution confirmed and am unlikely to go back anytime before I leave, I was impressed with the speed of the management response and have changed my review to reflect that.

For the first time I tried hazelnut hot chocolate outside of CCD and was awestruck with the taste.It was the best chocolate drink I ever had in so many years and ordered 2 instead .This was followed by the cheese fondue .The fondue is one of a kind dish here and it was awesome. One of the best cafes I have been to

Simple concept executed well. They have a menu limited to cuisine from 4 countries. The food comes together quite nicely. The iced frappe was serviceable. Not much to crib about roesti. It's crispy potato for god's sakes! The mushroom crepe was served to us cold. Once they warmed it up, it was quite satisfying. Beware as that much mushroom and mushroom sauce can get troublesome for some. We ended with the classic belgian waffles - honey and butter. Something classic should not be bathed in sin. But hey, we are gluttons and we loved every bit of it. 

Good service. Shockingly reasonable prices for the coolth it exudes. Good job Picadilly. I'm sure to return.

I absolutely love this place, even though i have had just one dish here (Dublin Mudslide), which is insanely delicious i just wanna keep coming back for more of it.
The arrangement is kind of a cafeteria with outdoor as well as indoor sitting area. The service is really fast. The staff is nice as well. This place is a goody bag in the name of a restaurant. The crowd that comes here is pretty decent too(not that i have to judge them).
Overall : Great place. Will come here again and again for the Dublin Mudslide(Open to suggestions on trying new dishes).
Suggestions : Expand your restaurant. You won't be able to accommodate large groups, which is a disappointment if you wanna bring along a group of people.

The food is excellent. I have no other word to describe it. Will recommend the Popeye's pick specially. I suppose its the most famous dish here. Interiors- chic and cosy at the same time. Service is good and fast.
My only complaint is the quantity. They have reduced the waffles and sandwich quantities. The reduced portion sizes at the same price is a little disheartening.

I have been to Piccadilly Square which was located in Alipore but sadly it has been closed. 

It was a great place to sit and enjoy delicacies they serve. 
We

I had Alfredo Pasta, Roesti Rounds. Both were just awesome. 

I especially liked Alipore outlet as it wasn't very crowded and I can really relish dishes in total peace and calmness. Just lost in tastes.

I went to this quite, little and beautiful joint a few months back. The inside and outside have been designed immaculately. It has a nice chic and clean appearance.

We had ordered a macaroni and their signature pancakes with maple syrup. Both the dishes have been such delightful. They were so tasty and properly taken care of while cooking and serving.

I must say that they are technologically well-advanced too. The service was really good and I was left so darn impressed!

Now now this is place where you might just find one of the best desserts in Kolkata. My first visit here was long back in 2010 and I was simply delighted with everything. The food ambience service, so much so that I wrote in the bill "You guys are great." The cheesecakes and Belgian waffles are must try. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and everything was really delicious. .5 deducted since water is not served you have to buy a bottle. Apart from this everything is AWESOME. I will continue to write time and again "You guys are GREAT"

The GPS-made-easy-location is Piccadilly square makes this place a happy place. A perfect evening cafe, the place is so subtely qnd yet beautifully decorated with its yellow bulbs and amazing postered walls. Piccadilly square offers one of the creamiest and yummiest penne pastas in Calcutta. Alfredo, as they call it is a must have for cheese fanatics.  The Sandwich however was a disappointment and I wouldn't recommend a bland tomato pesto filling for anyone. We ordered for a cranberry based smoothie which was quite refreshing and tangy. However ,the waffles took the cherry on the cake! Dublin Mudslide as they call it, is a chocolate ice cream based waffle sided up with a bowl of piping hot chocolate sauce and its such finger licking stuff that you dare miss it if you ever land up in this place. 
Also, we got a nutella doughnut as a take away but it was cold and rubbery and yes, a disappointment.
Overall verdict  : atleast one visit for satisfying the curiosity revolving around this place.
For the staff : Work on the sandwiches maybe, a better choice for fillings rather than the regular ones would be a nice lil touch. :)

Heard about this joint from a friend and finally made a pre puja celebratory visit. Desserts. Who doesn't love them! Being an ardent fan of the whole genre, i went there with a lot of expectations and they delivered a large dollop of satisfaction, layered with cheesecakes and garnished with freddoe. The waffle tasted absolutely great and the extra dose of chocolate syrup upped the glamour. The freddoe imbued with oreos were just spoon licking good. Anthe cheesecakes were just yum. Overall a very sweet experience and will be visiting again in the near future. Totally recommended!!!!

Variety is bit less on the menu amd some are not there even though shown in the menu. Service is just great. Location is also good since its right in the starting of sarat bose road. Ambience is also good. Rates are bit high on the chart but reasonable for the service and food. Its a good place to hang out with friends.  I didnt find any special snacks or food there but do go there once if u happens to be hanging out in the area its worth one vist.

Well, I hadn't been active on zomato for a while now but after today's visit to Piccadilly I just HAD to review it! 
Two of my friends and I walked in here to indulge in waffles and cheesecakes and boy was it amazing! 
We went for the Belgian cheesecake, Dublin mudslide waffles and chocolate explosion waffles. Each of them were out of the world. We further ordered donuts and it was just as amazing as the rest. 
It's truly rare when you walk into a place and come out so happy and stuffed. 
Even though this place is slightly on the more expensive side, but hey, good things never come without a price!

You can't help but lust for these whenever you're hungry! I had ordered Belgian Waffles earlier. This comes with Fresh Hot Waffles toped with Cream and Chocolate Syrup. Equally Tasty! 
Coming to the Pasta , Perfect is the word! What taste. What service and what preparation. I'm simply in awe. You can see in the pictures on his perfect my orders look.

For two years, I used the Sarat Bose Road for daily commute but just didnt happen to visit the place. Finally did so a few months back and have been visiting this place ever since. When the weather is good, the small eating area on the pavement outside is a treat to sip coffee (average), have chocolate donuts (pretty neat), waffles (average) or salad (average) from the live counter. Staff is cordial and they go out of the way to suggest menu items. 

Tip: Chocolate lovers should try the mudslide waffles. Would remind you of the Israeli joints in the Parvati valley.

The go to place for waffles in the city! Cosy cafe located right opposite Hindustan Club on SB road , it's a paradise for people with serious sugar cravings. We tried out three different Belgian waffles , namely, the classic waffle with whipped cream, a Dublin Mudslide with its sinful combination of hot chocolate sauce poured over chocolate ice cream, and the cherry waffle. All of them were absolute palate boosters, but my personal favorite would be the Dublin Mudslide. Although I'll have to say this features on the pricier side (three plates of waffles and that cost us 600 bucks including taxes!), it's definitely worth a visit.

I have lost count the number of times I have been in this place. Being a die hard non-vegetarian, this was the only vegetarian place which appealed me. The food quality is still the same from the last 4 years, when I started visiting this place. Though the price is on a higher side, the mouthwatering taste of the food served does justice to it. A must try is Corn-ala-mode. Perfectly cooked. Also the waffles and pancakes are their best stuff indeed. One of my most favourite joints!

This is a little cafe situated near minto park. Its near my hospital so decided to try it with 4 friends of mine. The place is very small hardly 4-5 tables. 
I being a nonveg was a bit apprehensive at first about ths eatery but then the food was ok. We had a belgium cheesecake, crepes, rattatouille and foccachia sndwich..it was ok. Because they amount they charge for it i expectd the veg food to b exceptional but its not .
The cheesecake was yummy, the ratatouille was avg and the sandwich was okayish.
Would mind visiting once more though.

Location: Sarat Bose Road. 

Piccadilly Square is one of the popular places among the people of Kolkata for its delicious and quality fare. Started years back as an outlet in Alipore (now closed), it is slowly spreading its roots across Kolkata with currently two functional outlets. One being this at Elgin and the other being towards Central Kolkata at Dalhousie.
This outlet of Piccadilly Square is located right beside Techno City, Sarat Bose Road i.e. a stone's throw away from Flavours. Dropped by this place twice while was around Elgin for my usual work affairs. 

About the AMBIANCE, the elegant creepers on the iron structure at the entrance gives an instant hint to the customers about what could be expected from the interiors of this place. The interiors are pretty simple yet, have a classic touch of the Italian environment which could be seen with the jute-mesh style chairs, the pavement-style flooring with a cart-style counter and a couple of old country style lamp posts to take the roadside interior theme a notch up. 

About the FARE, this place is an all-day vegetarian cafe serving mostly bakery and dessert items along with a widespread Italian Fare. A plus to the place is a live Salad counter. Of the menu, the following has been sampled until now: 

- Italian Salad
Was tailored to choice. Had more of fresh green and cold cuts which included zucchini, American corn, bell peppers, iceberg lettuce etc. tossed in their special in-house dressing and vinaigrette. Tasted great and was also light on the tummy.

- Chocolate Donuts
One word, delicious. Nicely done chocolate layered donuts, best when eaten warm. Recommended.

- Chocolate Fetish (Freddo)
The usual has Vanilla ice cream to it, but, I preferred Belgian dark chocolate in this dish and the server was notified the same.
This dessert is a frozen mash of chocolate chips, ice cream, brownie topped with fudge sauce! Served on a waffle. An absolute indulgence. Chocolate love!
Highly recommended.

- Dublin Mudslide Waffles
Decently done waffles drizzled with chocolate fudge sauce and served along with a scoop of chocolate ice-cream. Tasted nice. The waffles did look nice but, still had scope of improvement.

The SERVICE by the courteous and trained STAFF was prompt.
PRICES were found to be inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall a nice experience.

A quaint little place.Bang opposite Hindustan Club on S.B.Road,I have seen this cafe on transit many times but today made myself get down and visit the place.

Very small space with an outside seating area,the decor is nothing to write home about.They probably have tried to recreate the London street cafe atmosphere,what with the street lamp replicas and the name,but the effect is somewhat lost because of lack of space.

Stuffed mushroom,Potato waffles,Americano and green tea were ordered and consumed.The mushroom and coffee were excellent,and the tea and the potato were average.The sauce was very good.

Overall,a nice place for students and service was efficient if not warm.

I will start the review saying that I am not really a veg person. I went to this place solely because of the varieties of waffles they serve and I must say I am satisfied keeping in mind my requirement. I did try one of their sandwiches which i definitely did not like..but one again the berry waffles did make up for everything else!

Piccadilly Square not being a very spacious place but still is a nice place to chill out with friends. Its a good vegetarian cafe offering you salads, waffles, pancakes, sandwiches, coffee, hot chocolate etc. I have tried their waffles, blueberry pancakes and their fondue and they all have tasted ¬†so good that whenever i am back in the city i prefer visiting this place at least once.

Always been a fan of this quaint and tastefully decorated bistro! The mushroom sauce with the crepes is truly one of a kind. The Belgian chocolate waffles are a must-have, as is the Banana Cabana. It's a dessert-lover's paradise! Albeit a little harsh on the pocket, its a perfect place to stop by for an indulgent dessert.

They are trying to replicate the famous dessert cuisines from all over the world. A good strategy for having repeated customers. People try to taste all the varieties available. Regarding the taste, its better than regular deserts you have after meal. The full meal desert is a great concept.

Piccadilly square is a charming little bistro, situated at the side of the Techno city expanding on the Sharat Bose Road. It‚Äôs a little cafeteria however greatly clean and all around improved. They have seating organized both inside and outside so you can get a look of Kolkata. I like that they have included lampposts and pictures that fit in superbly add the additional appeal of a proper cafeteria. Members are very friendly and give you your own privacy which is really important thing for me to like a coffee shop.

Food- Most importantly, I would say the cost is too unreasonable as per the item. Yes, they accept cards but no exception in food; however they are standard, crisp and great. I requested Sandwiches, Hot Chocolate, Cupcakes and Pasta. The bill burnt out my pocket!I didn't expect that much. So I didn't even go for the gelato. Some of my friends have the same issues. It will be great if you low down the price a bit, specially for the students and normal individuals.

Well to start off,yesterday we three foodies suddenly planned to check out some new place. We decided to check this place as we were longing to visit this cafe on the sarat bose road for quite sometime....
         To b frank enough ths cafe is cute in every possible sense related to  appearance, decor and ambience...
          We ordered quite a few things wich included Foccacio Sandwich wid garlic mayo,Nutella Brownie,Lemon Iced Tea,Choclate Fetish,Berry Mates & Mushroom & Cheese Panini...
          At first we were served wid iced tea nd berry mates.The lemon iced tea was okay & the Berry mates were possibly the best thing we had that we realised aftr we were served d rest.
         Then came mushroom & cheese panini & foccacia sandwich..foccacia sandwich was nothing great, d filling seemed bland panini was okay not worth upto d mark..
          Now d core of my disappointmnt was d nutella brownie for wich i was goddamn excited bt  to my hardluck d thing i was served was an overheated plain  choclate brownie wich was hard as rock making sure it  wasn't an inch nutella-ish.. 
Choclate fetish was less than average d waffle appeard a bit soggy wich detoriated its charm... 
            I m pretty much sure i wont recommend ths place to any of my friends as an evening plan....

Being a foodie myself I often try out different food joints and Cafe whenever I get time.. I wanted to visit this place for quite some time. Until today when I finally managed to hop in there.. A very small vegetarian Cafe(one of the very few in kolkata) located near bhaggu at sarat bose road.. Decoration is quite impressive and lives up to its name.. 7-8 odd tables are there and looks quite classy.

We ordered foccacia sandwich with garlic mayo spread.. Nutella brownie.. Lemon iced tea.. Chocolate fetish..... Berry mates and mushroom cheese panini sandwich

Foccacia sandwich_it really didn't taste anything like it with hardly any signs of mushroom in it.. Not worth a try

Lemon iced tea_ummm decent nothing great ..

Nuttela brownie_i don't know why would you call it a Nutella brownie and fancy things up when there is no signs of Nuttela nor nuts in it... I would rather call it a chocolate brownie which was spoiled further due to over heat in the microwave.. It was so hard in the edges that it was hard to cut a piece off with a spoon..

Mushroom cheese penani sandwich_again nothing special decent I would say..

Chocolate fetish_a blend of ice cream chocolate chips and chocolate sauce served in a waffle bowl.. It seemed to be a mere Replica of chocolate avalanche.. However chocolate avalanche is better..

Berry mates_the best thing we ordered today and the only good thing.. It was really awesome..

Note: if you think I rated this so low because of the food well of course no.. I would have given it a 2.5probably but the staff there made it a point to worsen things up. He was very rude, arrogant and almost spilled a glass of berry mate which was partially filled.. He was in such a hurry to clear tables when we were not even finished and mind you there was not even a rush at that point..

I would think twice before before stepping into this ever again..

I've been wanting to visit this place for quite a long time now. So, in spite of a few friends warning me of not-so-good-food, I went ahead and gave this a try.

Piccadilly square is a cute little cafe with only 6-7 tables, located at the corner of the Techno city building on the Sarat Bose Road.
The interior as I said previously is small but extremely tidy and well decorated. To remain true to the name of the cafe they have added lampposts and pictures that fit in perfectly add the extra charm to the ambience.

We had Foccacia sandwich with garlicky mayo, Mushroom and cheese panini, Nutella brownie, Chocolate Fetish, Berry Mate and Lemon iced tea.

The Foccacia sandwich was rather insipid. The Foccacia bread itself was too dry, the fillings were not great either. It was supposed to have a coleslaw filling with mushrooms. A coleslaw salad as far as I know is supposed to be dressed in a vinaigrette dressing. But the sandwich which we were served tasted by no means of any dressing leave alone the extra garlicky mayo dressing we desired.

The Mushroom cheese panini was okay. But not lip-smacking.

Now coming to the worst of all the food items we had this evening- The Nutella brownie. Apart from the name, there was nothing about the brownie that I could call Nutella-ish. To be precise, it was NOT A NUTELLA BROWNIE. Period. It was just a sad excuse for a plain chocolate brownie with no hint of either nuts or nutella in it. And to top it all the brownie was as hard as a rock which I presume was due to over heating the brownie in microwave mode. I myself love baking so trust me when I assume how the brownie turned rock hard (I've been through such culinary disasters myself).
This brownie is the main reason why I'm rating this place so low.

The Berry Mate- which the staff described to be a strawberry flavored yoghurty drink was great.

The iced tea was okay.

The Chocolate Fetish is basically a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream served on a fancy waffle bowl topped with chocolate sauce and choco chips. It was good. I mean come on....nobody can go wrong with such a basic combination of vanilla and choco sauce.

Overall, I won't say my experience here was too good. I'd probably think a hundred times before I step in here again.

Want to burn a hole in your pocket? See,I've got something for you.
The saving grace is that the food is fresh and feel-good.

Try the Belgian waffles if you like the concept of waffles.I don't but I found it pretty good.
The cheesecake is really good!
The other dishes are very less in quantity and considering the price,that's a disappointment. 

I like the decor : the floor and the lamp-posts,the tables,the counter.They've tried to make it look like one of those street shops in London and it has turned out nice.

Worth a try.

Been to this place numerous times and I should probably say that this place serves the largest cheesecake in Calcutta! Their Pancakes,  waffles,  coolers,  sandwiches,  salads- all are top notch! The ambience is pretty nice with the cobbled streets flooring and food cart like counter!  However I think that they are a bit overpriced,  given the fact that you get equally good pancakes,  waffles n sandwiches in other places in Calcutta and Bangalore at much lesser prices.

A small cozy place right in the hub of the city dishing out brilliant and more importantly genuine belgian style waffles. 
Piccadilly Square is the holy grail of waffles in the city. 
Perhaps my shortest review so far but I think enough's said. Cheers! :)

Even though this place is really popular and usually busy, the staff is really polite and courteous. Love going back there time and again ¬†:)

This place was in the hitlist and advantageous as it is nearby to my office. I visited this place after office with a friend  and I must say it is a very nice place to hangout with a interior of different places screaming out in different walls.  Though the place is small but definitely with a very nice ambience. I ordered much hyped #mad over mushrooms and trust me I dint regret, it was so tasty and perfectly cooked,  then we ordered one of yummylicious waffle filled with potato and cheese,  the potatoes were cooked perfectly üòä. Then we ordred a chocolate cupcake but to my disappointment it Was not available üòØ so I ordered for the lemon cupcake and  I was very happy as the it was sooo yummy. This place is pocket friendly too . And I would love to visit this place for the pancakes as I could try them in the first time. üòÉ

There can be no other word for it!! Each and every food, you have to but name it, is extremely well prepared and tasty !! You get a feeling of sitting at Piccadilly Square when ur eyes rove over the ground which is cobbled exactly as it is over there in the original one. You can sit out on a winter day and indoors as well in a sweltering summer day!! But this is a joint worth every penny u spend !!

Beginning my review with the best thing I had at Piccadilly Square - "freddo" or¬†gelato-sundae. I don't remember the exact name of the freddo, but I do remember that it had belgian chocolate gelato alongwith oreos and chocolate sauce - a heavenly combination which made for an incredibly delicious dessert. ¬†Their Mocha Shake has a great dark chocolate flavour and the perfect bitter-sweet taste.¬†

The Very Berry Shake was Very Average. The Aglio Olio pasta was decent, but then again it was average.¬†
Coming to the Pita Pockets - this was listed under Greek cuisine and well, it tasted like greek roti subzi. Very bland.¬†

The service is very prompt; everything ordered was served within 5 minutes.¬†
The decor is nothing fancy - it's simple, clean and pretty with soft lighting. On the whole, the ambiance is pleasant.¬†The seating area is small but their menu has a lot of variety. ¬† ¬†

Piccadilly Square was on my 'To Go List' since a long time and I am glad I tried it out but somehow it failed to evoke the "I am definitely coming here again" emotion in me.¬†¬†
Having said that, I would like to mention that before I wrote my review, I read the other reviews on Zomato which made me think that maybe, just maybe I should go to Piccadilly Square once again and only try the waffles, pancakes and crepes.¬†

On the whole:
Food - 3/5Freddo - 4.5/5 (Yes, I am rating the freddo separately.)
Service - 4/5
Ambiance - 3.5/5

Only flaw would be the waitors. 
They do very less to help you with the menu.

Piccadilly Square is a blessing for dessert lovers and students with less money in their pocket. Also for Vegetarians. Discovered this place years back and I keep going back for more. Primarily known for their Pancakes and Cr√™pes they serve several other vegetarian dishes as well. Piccadilly Square is appropriately decorated with frames of pictures connecting Paris and Pancakes, an olden day roadside lamp post and live counter and open kitchen. It also has outdoor seating areas. Overall very pretty.
I will start with the Pancakes. My favourite pancake is Blueberry Blast which is perfectly citrusy and sweet. It is a strong flavoured sauce on soft and tender pancakes. The other pancakes with chocolate sauce, usual maple syrup are good choices too. Coming to Cr√™pes I had tried their celestial chocolate cr√™pe. It had thin and delicate cr√™pes filled with thick chocolate sauce and chocolate chips. Very safe. However recently I tried their Caribbean Breeze ( if I remember correctly!) and it blew my mind. It consists of Cr√™pe filled with pineapples in a thick milk cream sauce with strawberry syrup. The pineapples and cr√™pe in the milk cream is an unexpected but delicious combination. The white cream sauce is thick and not too sweet with strawberry syrup aptly breaking the monotony. One mouthful of this and you are in heaven. Their Mushroom Cr√™pe is a nice savoury cr√™pe.
I have also had waffles and I love almost all the toppings that come with it.
They serve really nice Pasta, and my favourite is their mixed sauce pasta. The pasta in Alfredo sauce is great too.
They have sandwiches in various kinds also make your own sandwich option in which you are allowed to choose two spreads and as many fillings.
Their Cheesecakes, though not authentic ones with cream cheese, are really worth trying. Somehow they have managed to put an authentic feel to their cheesecakes with the kind of cream they use. I have tried their Juices and drinks as well and have liked them.
Pocket Pinch for two is about 800/- for sufficient eaters. Reasonable and well worth your money. Do try. Enjoy.

This place was in my wish list for a long time. As it is a vegetarian place and I am a hard core meat lover I always skipped this place but today I was determined to visit Piccadilly square no matter what. My brother gave me company. We decided to have deserts only for lunch üòç. First we ordered Dublin mudslide waffle and a pancake with maple syrup. They were so delicious I loved them no doubt. Then we ordered a strawberry crepe which was average with lots of sliced pineapples and strawberry syrup. It was a little sweet for my taste bud. Then we ordered the brownie cheese cake. It was so soft that it melted in my mouth üòòyummy. Then we ordered a blueberry based drink which was a little different but won my heart. Our bill was 950 around. The service is fast.

I had been there with a friend a few days back. I had always wanted to try this place out and trust me,this place is a must try! We had ordered strawberry and cranberry mocktails,2 potato sandwiches and a dublin mudslide. The dublin mudslide was the highlight of it all. The waffle was crisp and the ice cream and the chocolate sauce just made it all the more lip smacking. It was a delight to be here! Definitely going there for more. :D

This is my all time favourite place to meet my sweet cravings. From classic pancakes, Dublin Mudslide Waffles to Savoury Crepes. Everything is just so delicious. Their pasta is average. But I love all their pancakes, waffles and crepes irrespective of them being sweet or savoury.

Expenditure/VFM : 1200 for 3 people
Ambience/Service : The entry to this place is fashioned after a traditional French Cafe. The interiors are plain, unpretentious and not too fussy. The servers were courteous and helpful.
What to Order : Crepes
The last two times I was in the city, I was coaxed by my sister to visit this place, but unfortunately missed it. But finally this time we made it and am glad we did.
Although the place is small, they make up for it with the size of the menu (which is large with a lot of variety). We ordered some cold beverages which were all decent although the hazelnut frappe turned out to be too sweet. The Alfredo Pasta was well cooked, I especially liked the healthy quantity of sweet corn and capsicum in it. The focaccia sandwich was average (a little over grilled perhaps). Finally, the chocolate crepe was heavenly. We were so full by the end of it that we had skip the waffle this time (Which I have heard so much about). Hopefully, next time I'll be here only for the waffles.
Verdict: its a fitting place for casual hangouts. The overall quality can be improved if compared to similar such cafes in the other cities. But 'thumbs up' for raising the bar for cafes in Cal and hoping to find more such places in the city.
P.S. ~ Had I found this place during my school days, I would have surely been a very fat kid :p

This place has a homely feeling , the interiors makes you feel as if you are in some cafe on the European streets . the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Coming to food and menu , this is such a joint where they have limited menu but whatever they serve its the best . be it pastas , crepes , focaccia sandwich or the salad or the felafel , you can just blind fold yourself and point at anything on the menu card , iam sure you will like it. The main part is the deserts for which it is popular . I loved the cheese cakes and waffles and the gelato . I guess i love everything in menu . it is not a fine dine place but always a walk in for a casual dinner or even after dinner . do check out for seasonal menu and food festivals organized by them

The place is really cramped up. You can't possibly go here in a big group. I went there in a group of 17 people and we had to sit in an L shaped table arrangement so you can't interact with anyone. The food is really good. Popoye's pick, mad over mushrooms, Nutella crepes and waffles are really really nice. You can't say that the place is overpriced because they serve really good quality food. You may try it out.

An excellent little place, for European snacks and desserts.  We visited recently and had the Blueberry Cheesecake which was exquisite. Staff service was very good, and the decor matched the theme. My only objection was the music, which didn't really match the feel of the place.  Still the food was excellent and the prices moderate. Would definitely go back and would also recommend this to all.

Good interiors, pleasant ambiance. Bad food. Ordered 3 dishes, only 1 was worth ordering. The #PanCakes with maple syrup was upto the mark. Next, the #StuffedMushroom had an unnecessarily thick cornflour coating which felt & tasted disgusting when chewed! The last dish sampled was Aglio Olio(pasta), which had a ill-balanced flavour profile. The only flavour was oregano and nothing else & couldn't finish the dish. Coffee is NOT AVAILABLE over the week & only on weekends!! The service on the outside sitting area is bad as the waiters prefer Air-conditioned atmosphere over service.

This little cafe in sarat bose road has a very european feel, its decor minimal yet appealing. The peaceful ambience in stark contrast to the busy street outside, combined with delicious food and drinks quite nearly sums up this place for me. Among the beverages, banana caramel smoothie and mixed berries shake were the perfect kickstart to our meal. We had focaccia sandwiches with cream cheese spread and saute√©d mushrooms, grilled onion and tomato filling along with grilled potato waffle sandwiches. Despite being a hardcore non-vegetarian, i have to admit sometimes it doesnt need chicken or pork or turkey to appreciate the goodness of a sandwich. Picadilly Square is famous for its desserts and bakery and the brownie cheesecake, we ordered did full justice to its name and fame. It is a spoonful of pure melt-in-your-mouth heavenly awesomeness. It's my first visit and i am already in love with this place. :)

Decor was very simple with 8tables fr 2 or 4 people including the outdoor sitting... And the walls r decorated with paintings related to Italy or London or Paris with 2 street light inside the restaurant.... It mainky serves Italian and belgian food... The drinks and food were delicious... Service was very good... This is one of the cheapest but quality cafe I have ever gone in Kolkata...

Piccadilly square has amazing waffle (both sweet and savoury) dishes, crepes (both sweet and savoury) dishes and pancakes, along with pastas and shakes. They also sell doughnuts and brownies. If you are in the mood for some light brunch or high tea or coffee definitely try this cafe. They provide both outdoor and indoor seating. However the seating is limited. Nevertheless I would definitely recommend it.

I keep going back to Piccadilly Square for their Mushroom crepes and their Belgian waffles. I've NEVER had something quite like that in any country / city I've visited. Their chocolate sauce recipe is quite unique, and has been painstakingly developed.¬†

The only minus one is their tea. The cups could be better, and they could really consider using better tea than Tetley.

Another college days' favourite! My Usual: Walnut Brownie with Chocolate Fudge and Whipped Cream. A very simple and general choice, but the quality of it makes it stand out at this place; the freshness of the brownie with the flavour of the walnut intact, the smoothness and aroma of the chocolate fudge and the lightness of the cream. Good ambience. Friendly staff. Good service.

Oh! How much I miss this place now that I am settled in Mumbai. This place lives up to its set standards from the very start. established on the European street food concept, they serve really good savoury as well as sweet dishes.For savoury I somehow end up ordering for their sandwiches, the cold pasta salad and spinach and corn crepes. Dessert must is the Dublin mudslide which is a waffle served with oodles of chocolate sauce and chocolate icecream. Banoffee pie is also a very good choice if one has taste for banana flavoured desserts. When my friend introduced me to this dessert here, I loved it so much that for the next 3-4 visits here I made them fetch bananas from the nearest fruit seller and made them serve it to me since they were out of bananas. And they happily did it!!I am loyal to this place and whenever I go back to the City of Joy, I will always make a visit to this place!!

Eating at picadilly is always a delight.
The ambience is always perfect,not loud, not dull ,with the sunlight brightening the glass facade during the day .
The staff are courteous and service quick.

We ordered an Italian meal which has a Pasta dish,a sandwich and a scoop of icecream.We chose the light aglio olio ,a mixed sandwich and a scoop of belgian chocolate icecream .The sandwich bread was the best ive had -fresh and soft.
In addition we ordered classic pancakes ,just the right amount sweet n warm.With the little scoops of belgian icecream the dessert was heavenly.

This was sufficient for two people not wanting to indulge in rich Italian food .Another usp was the quiet cafe ambience best for good times with close friends.

We ordered Pan cakes with Maple syrup and Belgium waffle with dark chocolate sauce. Both were superb.¬†
I returned from Europe 2 months back and I loved the desserts there and couldn't dream of finding anything similar in Kolkata.
I don't know about other dishes, but the pan cakes and waffles were actually comparable. They were soft, just the right amount of sweet and simply delicious.

Picaddilly Square at Elgin Road has truly bested all other eateries around its corners. I went there today with my hungry little elfshian pals, to grab a bite. We ordered two types of waffles, a strawberry smoothie and different flavors of brownies and choco mousse! Boy were they tasty! The waffles, perfectly cooked just enough. and the extra chocolate sauce went gratis with the waffles! Mamma Mia. kudos to the chef! The french poster on the wall, says it all...you;ll fall in love wd this place! will try blueberry cheesecake next!

We had visited the joint tonight.. Arnd 1015 we ordered and in ten mins food was served..  At 1030 this rude waiter asks us to leave as it was their closing time, even though we were still having out food.  We told him to wait for 5 mins but he responded that it wasn't possible and that we will have to pack the food. 

When we asked the cashier - Mr Sandeep Mishra who apparently is the manager there,  he also gave the same response! 

Was shocking! Hospitality is seriously a miss here!  At least this time! 

Food was nice as ususal!

This is my favourite place. Whenever in kolkata i dont leave without visiting this place. The staff is very attentive. Food mind blowing. Lets start with the pancakes.
Alll of them are awesome in their own way. The simple one with maple syrup or the blueberry pancake. Even the creamy one in which they add sprinklers. Justttttt dreamy.
Now i have't tried any waffle here. Just 1. Waffles with butter and honey. This itself left me no choice. Every time i visit. This is the only waffle i indulge into. They even give you extra butter or honey if u need. My suggestion : more butter lesser honey. Lovely. If it becomes too sweet u may not like it. So butter shud be more.
Now the crepes. There is this savoury crepe with corn and mushroom. Very tasty and creamy.
Even the foccacia sandwich is worthwile.
Well 3 things i always eat when i go here. A pancake. A waffle. And the crepe.
The place is small and ambience is lovely. For some quiet time or a private meet its worth it. Even to hang out with friends it being centrally located next to Soho and Pattisiere.

My experience with this place has really been disappointing.
The first time I visited this place, I ordered a salad and a waffle with potato wedges and salsa. The salad was just about average and the waffle with salsa and potato wedges was not upto the mark at all.
I visited this place again to try out something new. The mad over mushrooms crepe was really good but it is a shame that they served stale samosas. The filling was stone cold as if stored in the freezer. They replaced the samosas but the replacement also had no change and there was no one willing to be accountable for the same.
I did not find anything that was too good. Everything about it was just average.

Just a day before I visited this place with my friends. I would suggest you all to go. Ordered 3 sandwiches, cupcakes and a frozen dessert with brownies, chocolate sauce and choco chips. 2 sandwiches were named Foccacia with different fillings, it was yum. Viva Italia was average, nothing great. Chocolate cupcake was really nice.. Normal cake but a really smooth butter chocolate frosting. Best part was that frozen...vanilla ice cream with chocolate toppings. Overall it was a good experience and a sober ambience. Should try the desserts.

Frankly speaking I don't know what all the fuss is about when it comes to Piccadilly Square. My friends and i visited the Elgin Road branch a few weeks ago and honestly it was extremely disappointing. We ordered around 4 items and the bill was around Rs.1500 ! I never pay that amount of money for Non vegetarian food , let alone vegetarian food which did not even fill our tummies. As one of my friends opened her handbag to take out her purse her comb fell out of her bag and the waiter immediately pounced on us by saying we could not comb our hair in the restaurant ¬†, he didnt even wait for an explanation and was extremely rude. Overall , extremely unsatisfactory.

This joint is located in sarat Bose road beside "great eastern techno city" and nearby "Soho". It is a small cafe comprising of 6-8 tables, the decor is very nuclear and attractive and the ambience is quite soothing too. They mainly specializes on Italian cuisines, but offers a wide range of succumbing savories, like- pastas, focaccias, hot chocolate, cold coffees, shakes, smoothies, coffee beans, salads, sandwiches, gelatos, cheesecakes, moussees, cup cakes, donuts, waffles, muffins etc; I have been to this place several times and I have really relished their offerings every time, specially their Italian sandwich, pancakes, waffles ,focaccias, fruit chillers are fabulous(personal experience) and leaves you craving for more. The service of the staffs are a quite smooth and hospitable. They completely commits in providing uncompromised quality without any fuss. This cafe doesn't creates much hype out there but the quality of their offerings speaks itself

Their blueberry cheesecake was one of the first I ever tasted and the reason I became a fan of this wonderful creation. Beautiful, light and fresh, with the quiet sourness of the berries, it still tastes the same as it did the first time and I am glad it does.¬†
PS: though an ode to the cheesecake, the wonderful waffles should get a special mention. Try them!

I discovered my love for all things vegetarian at Piccadilly Square with the waffle sandwich which was grilled to perfection with beautifully seasoned assorted vegetables. A generous helping of the dip made me savour each bite and my time at this quaint eatery with a lot of character. It's a must visit every time I am in Kolkata cause a quick bite with some friends couldn't be better with a table full of the most tasty crepes specially the ones oozing with chocolate and refreshing smoothies. 
Go visit, this ones from one foodie to all the foodies out there ;) 
Happy Savouring!

I had heard about this place a long time, but when I finally went there i really loved the place. Its located near Soho Minto Park. The place is quite small like a cafe but inside its a sweet factory. After trying some cheesecakes and waffles, I was really impressed with the food. On a whole one of the best places for cakes and deserts in town. Do find some time and head there, you will not be disappointed.

Meeting an old friend after nearly 2years. A quaint little place. Nice ambience and a great place to just munch on and chat. Known for its desserts and bakery mostly we had a Belgium chocolate waffle which was really good. However we also really enjoyed the Al Funghi pasta and our irish creme lattes. A little on the expensive side but generous helpings adequate for two.

After being wishlishted for a long time, I finally went to Piccadily Square to celebrate a friend's birthday. Its about a km from the Rabindra Sadan metro station and located right beside Ideal Plaza. Our order was simple. A Walnut Brownie, All Chocolate Cupcake, Ferrero Rocher Donut and a Strawberry Cupcake. This little cafe is pretty impressive with seating arrangement inside and outside and old town street lamps right inside the cafe. The ambience is simple yet elegant. Now lets come to the food. I had my first doughnut here and trust me it changed my whole outlook on doughnut. I never thought even doughnuts can be so tasty. It was like heaven came down at my first bite. It was very fresh and fluffy. The strawberry cake was so delicious that my taste buds were engaged in a love affair. I think its the strawberry frosting on the top that made it the winner. The Walnut Brownie and all Chocolate Cupcake was ok, nothing special. Special mention to the staff for their cordiality and immense patience. And yes, the menu that was handed over to us there is different from the one on zomato. So, uploading the menu as well. The photos are not that sharp but you can still make out some of the dishes.

Piccadilly Square is a small cafe having flavors from Paris, Britain, Venice and Belgium. This little place has floors and lamp posts from the streets. The four countries are dandily framed on the walls. Though this cafe is known for its sweet dishes, I also loved the savoury bit. My favorite was the Crepe with corn and cheese filling. I also loved the pancakes with honey, simple and spot on! But the chocolate filled cake wasn't the best I have had, and it would be better if they would serve it with plain vanilla scoops and not vanilla strawberry flavour. Would love to revisit again sometime. The service was quick and efficient. It would be better if they include more savoury dishes.

Piccadilly Square is one of my favourite places to visit with my friends when we want to get dessert or a quick snack. The staff is friendly, service is fast, it is conveniently located and it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket! The decor will make you feel like you are sitting in a European cafe, although space is a constraint and it can get a little cramped, especially if you are with a big group. Try and get seating inside as noisy traffic is always an issue in this area!

If you have a sweet tooth, you can eat practically everything on the menu, especially the waffles and pancakes. However, you shouldn't go without sampling the Banana Cabana, a thin crepe stuffed with bananas with a drizzle of caramel sauce that tastes like heaven! If you feel like you would rather go savoury, Mad About Mushrooms is a must order - the mushroom sauce is unlike any other I have tasted.

The best part of Piccadilly Square is you can bring anyone from your baby cousin to your huge gang of friends here as it has something for everyone!

What i liked the best was the ambience which resembled piccadilly square in london with cobbled flooring and lampposts! Whay they should seriously work on is the quantity!

It's absolutely delicious and will undoubtedly leave you craving for more. The waffles are made to perfection. The only thing I dislike about this place is that it's too small. Not more than 5 groups of people can be seated inside at one point of time. However, they have outdoor seating but it's not very preferable by the customers considering the humid climate of Kolkata! Thumbs up for piccadilly. (y)

My first visit to Piccadilly Square was a year back, when my partner took me for the birthday cheesecake.
Last evening, we landed there again. Our order was simple - classic belgian waffle, hazelnut hot chocolate and two scoops of ice-cream - banana crunch and blueberry. Ice creams were good, hot chocolate more hazelnut than chocolate, waffle -quite thick and lacked flavour. Food-wise, not so impressed i'd say. ¬†Ambiance also, nothing special. But we had a great evening. And last year too.
Overall verdict : i enjoyed my visit both times, but the credit goes to my partner than the food.
Worth a visit in once in a while, but nothing special.

I was driving around looking for a place to park near Elgin Road when I spotted this place and decided to give it a try. I had three of my friends with me and each of us started our meal with a brownie. The best was the Fudge Brownie while the Ferrero Rocher Brownie lived upto my expectation. The pan cakes were really good ( the Creme De La France deserves special mention ). The Oreo Overload Cheesecake is also worth tasting. Apart from that other items like waffles, paninis and sandwiches were good enough. Staff was good and service was fast and prompt. Good crowd and ambience. One thing that struck me as odd was the old bollywood hits playing in the background(by old i mean 2006 onwards). It was not expected in a place like this. Parking can be a hassle 'coz they have permission for 4-5 cars infront of the joint ( otherwise its a No Parking Zone ). You can also park behind the building ( fits 2 hatchbacks at the most ). Apart from these, it is really a good place to visit , eat and chat with your friends. I've been there twice within a week ( it's like the pan cakes call you from within :P ). Hope this helps! Happy Dining folks! :)

Being a vegetarian, this is my favourite dessert place. getting eggless waffles and pancakes in Kolkata is only possible because of piccadley. and the flavour of chocolate, YUM!!!!!!

Thank you Piccadley :*! i can never get bored of u. I visit this place every week and know each and every dish by heart now.

one litre thing that needs improvement is the brownies. the servers don't heat it accurately and end up burning the core.

Probably the best place in Kolkata for sweet toothed vegetarians! Do not dare to miss out the 'Nuts about Nutella'. It is so sinful that just one of it won't be enough. The waffles and crepes here are the best. delicious and kinda authentic, this is one place I haven't yet gotten enough of! The ice creams are also worth a try- especially the berry flavour. perfectly price to not give a pocket pinch, this continues to be one of my favorite joints in Kolkata. Service sometimes is slow, but I kinda overlook it, considering the food! :)

Pro:

1. The Popeye's pick crepe was fab fab fab all the way.

2. The red bull mojito was also very good. 

3. The cup cakes were okayish

4. The decor was very good and the parking space in from of the Alipore store was also very good.(Though I worry for parking if there was more than one car)

5. The staff was very gracious. 

Cons:

1. I was disappointed to go to the Alipore eatery and learn that world cup menu was only available if ordered beforehand. The wc menu was the primary reason for going. I had confirmed beforehand from the sarat bose road eatery about the WC menu and I was not made aware of the same.

2. The lack of parking space for the Sarat Bose road store is a big issue which u guys need to look at asap. 

Overall the experience was good and I will come again in December

This is a nice small cozy place in Elgin Road, and they sure know their food. After a sudden burst of monsoon Kolkata had gone back to its usual sticky heat and we( a friend and me) were passing by this place, when we saw a horde pf people standing and watching something. 
Actually today it was the IPL play offs and the local team Knight Riders  featured in it. And this place had a television placed ideally for both the people inside as well as outside to watch. From outside the place looked decent and we entered. There was seating arrangement outside as well, but considering the heat, inside seemed a safe bet. 
We ordered only a few things :
1. Frozen Frappe 
2. Corn Crepe 
3. Watermelon smoothie 
I was thoroughly impressed with the crepe. It was succulent with ample corn and cheese, and had a lot of contrasting spices added to it to create a rather wholesome snack. The frappe was normal, and I really liked the watermelon smoothie. Refreshing! 
I am sure going to come back, if not for anything else, then for the crepe.

If you want to really have delicious desserts that appeal not only first to the taste but to your eyes as well, specific to kolkata the choice is rather disappointing and one needs to walk into five star. This is unlike other cities where there are amazing dessert parlors, boutique restaurants and baking joints that whip up some amazing dishes. 

I ate their waffles and cheese cake a while ago. The waffles were ok nothing over the top.however. The cheesecake was making me queasy within the fourth bite. Unlike the quintessential quality that exudes popularly defined cheese cake - is light creamy flavorful. This was heavy, hard and too sweet as compared to the popular definition.

As for the service given piccadilly is not really a street footprint, the waiters need to be trained regarding customer service. Example I am not a great fan of a bill being thrown to me. Small changes define better experiences at a restaurant / eatery.

It is situated near my office in Elgin road. And once by chance I had the opportunity to visit the place. I had some kind of salad , the name of which I forgot. There are two kinds of sitting arrangements. One is outside where you can sit over chat sessions and enjoy the roadside view. The other arrangement is indoors which also has a view of the wall clamped television set. I liked the dish and the staff's behavior was appreciable. I am confused as the menu card out here is not matching with the menu card which I saw out there physically.

I remember dropping by this cosy dessert corner sometime in January after my school reunion when I was just in the mood for some sweet nothings ! ;) the interiors are simple yet elegant and warm .we had Oreo cheesecake, Belgian waffle with chocolate icecream ,Fudge brownie with raspberry icecream and some coffee .for a not-so-sweet-toothed person like me its quite a job when a desserts impress me and I was at awe of almost everything that we ordered‚Ä¶ the waffle is a must try . I would definitely give a brownie point more for the good service and the nice staffs there .thumbs up for Picadelly Square

I love this place. The Dublin Mudslide is one of the best desserts I've ever tasted. The Mushroom waffle is pretty good too. We also tried a pancake with French vanilla sauce. The panini sandwich is okay. The cr√™pes are to die for. The drinks can be improved. Nothing great about them. You can never regret going to this place. A place you must visit. #Tummy Khush. :D

I have always looked at this place all through my high school days at Diocesan with admiration. I like the way the outdoor seats are done in posh black. After all these years I finally visited Piccadilly square today. Since proper menu card is not is provided at Zomato, I wanted to click the photos but A. gave me the oh-shit-don't-embarrass-me look and I did not. But you can just visit this place for all your cravings for sweet dishes.

The pan cake that we ordered was soft and bang on! The maple syrup with it was a little too sweet for me but A. liked it very much. The waffle with Belgian chocolate sauce and cake was HUGE. The service is prompt. We were given the Ice cream scoop and pan cake within a minute of ordering. The waffle with ice cream came later. 

The TV played T20 match with music playing inside. Nobody disturbs or questions the customers which I particularly liked about the place.

A lady on the table just beside ours ordered something which looked like cold coffee with ice cream. I loved the way she was served and the person who served said 'Ma'am please sip' and waited till she said that the coffee was fine and as per her instructions about the sugar. 

5 on 5 to the workers at PC! 

An absolutely wonderful place to go, especially if you are bored of the age old ccds

This is one great place to hang out with your bestie  and you will never be disappointed with it. The place is small but quite impressionable with its adorable outlook. The walls were donned with beautiful hangings. The menu was beautifully designed  segregating the  cuisines to the country it belongs. Spending a good deal of time on our deliberations we finally went for Popeye's Pick, Blueberry Swirl Cheesecake and Dublin Mudslide. I actually wanted to try the Strawberry Cheesecake, but was not available at that point of time. For drinks we ordered a Dark Mocha Frappachino and a Caramel Frappachino.

Both the drinks arrived first and tasted good, but the Mocha Frappachino was yummylicious, which was what my friend ordered. The Popeye's Pick was my choice and certainly was the pick of the day and with the warm crepe wrapped around the cheesy spinach and corn, tasted insanely good. Next came the beautiful and adorable cheesecake. Ah! in all our excitement it didn't meet our expectation. The Dublin Mudslide was next. It was a Belgian waffles tinkered with chocolate fudge sauce and  chocolate gelato. Also it came alone with an extra copper of the sauce. Both of us enjoyed till the last bite.

We were left fully satisfied with a real happy smile on our face. The pocket pinch certainly complemented with the quality they had to offer. Definitely will return for more... :)

Piccadily Square is very close to my house and I go there atleast twice a week! BEST part about it is the FOOD ofcourse but going to that later, first I would like to talk about Ambience. Soft background music to go with the food. The setting is of a street in London. In winters you'll just love to sit outside and in summers, the inside is the best. Service is good. Average actually but its FAST!

Now coming to the food - LIGHT, YUMM, INSANELY GOOD, DIFFERENT!

Bored of the usual Chinese-Italian-Indian food? Try Piccadily! The crepes are delicious and light. Mushroom lovers will fall in love with "Mad About Mushrooms" Crepe and "Popeye's Pick" is fantastic, oozing of cheese and white sauce with spinach and corn. YUM! The waffles are great and so are the paninis but topping everything else is the CREPEs and FALAFEL!

Coming to Desserts there is one which they conveniently leave out of the menu and that is "Nuts About Nutella" it is a crepe, again, and it is just out of this WORLD! You will be able to eat an entire plate all by yourself and not be willing to share at all. Other desserts like Pancakes, Choco Dynamite (Waffle), Celestial Chocolate (Crepe) is also too good!

They usually have on going festivals for valentines day or french festival or something and the special menu card will just make your jaw drop. Fantastic variety.

And don't forget to order a nice beverage/ drink to go with it! Cranberry Craze or Hazel Nut shake if you want something cold and if you prefer something hot go for Hot Chocolate! You'll love it!

Order the right things and you will keep coming back to Piccadily every week. It isn't very expensive and worth every penny!

had a short but sweet experience at piccadilly square the last week.It was on the occasion of chocolate day ,and i knew what to have, something that i have longed for...was the dublin mudslide!

To begin with, we chose MAD ABOUT MUSHROOMS..a crepe loaded with tons of sliced mushrooms n topped with creamy white sauce...hot cheesy mushroomy..well that was delicious!

next it was time for our main course of the day, the DUBLIN MUDSLIDE... belgian waffles with a large scoop of chocolate ice cream, n drizzled over with chocolate sauce..oh i missed out the main thing, it comes with a small pot of warm chocolate sauce!! the last thing was more than enough to satiate my chocolate desire for the year :-D but something struck my mind  to be missing,while having it,the plate looked a bit deserted, n later i realized it was the whipped cream topping..never mind!

it was time for billing, when both of us had sudden  cheese cake cravings :-) 
the best thing of the eve followed us, the BLUEBERRY SWIRL..this was the only thing we felt was worth paying .160 bucks for the cheesecake was VFM, the rest of the prices have been steeply raised..it was about 700 in our case,but for once a while... its done!!

The piccadilly square is a very small,cosy beautifully decorated place , located near the minto park crossing at sarat bose road.. a beautiful decoration overlooks the busy road. 
I am not a regular to places like this but the mushroom crepe and the cheesecake made me fall in love for them. its definitely one of the best place to sit for a chit chat or a date over the chocolate mudslides and the other delicious item they have. i never ever thought that vegetarian dishes can be so deliciously made. 

Though the price is bit on a higher side for a veg dish but all worries of the price and life will be gone when the cheesecake slowly melts in the mouth :)

This place has turned out to be a little gem and very consistent in terms of flavor and quality. Their crepes ,waffles and pancakes are excellent and even though they are vegetarian a hardcore non vegetarian like me enjoys them thoroughly. Their Cheesecakes are superb and have lovely delicate flavors and their shakes are yummy. Try their Savory Crepes with Mushroom which is delicious or their Cheese Waffle .... both are highly recommended. If you have a sweet tooth don't miss the Belgian Waffle with Chocolate Sauce which is superb. Love the chilled out ambiance and of course the location which is so central is a huge plus.

This is my go to place for Crepes and Waffles ! One of the top five in the city , hands down.
I love the ambiance, the decor, and the fact that it is small cozy and warm. :) 
My friend here is Gaga over the Mushroom Crepe , which I have to admit is pretty darn good ! But My favorites are without doubt :
The Belgian Waffles ( Chocolate one's of course ! )
The Crepes, ( also the chocolate one's :P )
The waffles have the perfect texture , generously covered in chocolate sauce and whipped cream !
The crepes are thin and flavorful leaving you wanting more of them :)
The coffee is really good too.
The service is swift.
I also love the outdoor seating arrangement as I love to enjoy my waffles watching the hustle bustle of Kolkata :) 
A great place for hanging out and eating some delicious food !

Hands down the best place to visit for all those with a sweet tooth [no wait a 'sweet jaw' is what I have]. I have been visiting this place for years now. And I have not yet experienced a tiniest shift in quality and taste. The same place, the same service and the same super sinful treats. My most-ordered food is the Waffle in Belgian Chocolate sauce. This is heavenly. The waffles with cheesy mushrooms, crepes, juices, cheesecakes are all items to die for. Service is also super quick, that is to say they don't make you wait when you are in the mood to dive in that rich warm chocolaty sauce. Their price is towards a higher end, and considering the quality they serve that is the fairest thing to do. I am a staunch non-vegetarian, but Piccadilly Square, happens to be my favorite haunt. The only place where it doesnt bother me if the food is veg or non-veg, because whatever it is, happens to be heavenly.

So I dont even remember how long I have been visiting this place and in turn how many ppl I hv got hooked to it.
Straight away talking business, which here is the food, I would like to start with the desserts.
So the pancakes here are the best you will have in your life (believe me they go best with maple syrup on top and vanilla icecream on the side, try it!!). Reason being the texture which is very porous and crumbly like a cake and not chikna (smooth) like the ones u make at home with the premix (most places use them)
Other than that the chocolate based crepes taste good too(nutella and d one with the brownie)
Talkin about savouries their sandwiches and salads are as good as u design them fr urself (ingredients are fresh and well flavored)
But the mad about mushroom crepe is like ecstacy for a mushroom lover (my mouths watery right now). The other crepes also taste good depending on what u like. Make one for urself...my suggestion is mushrooms with cheese sauce (sauce without mushroom) if u dont like overdose of mushrooms or corn with cheese sauce.
Their waffles are average (I hv never been fond of waffles honestly so judge fr urself)
If u want to sip on something cold close ur eyes and order choco hazelnut shake...its yumm evn if u are not a choc lover and at the same time they cn brew a decent cup of coffee for you.
The best part is that they keep coming up with food festival...a notable one was the burger fest (sumptuousness :p)...so hope u r  there at the right time.
The service is super quick, staff is courteous, and d ambience is decent and well lit. 
No doubt a value for your money place. If u visit cal u must must go!
Suggested order for two:
1. MAM crepe / corn ala mode crepe
2. A sandwich/salad/pita whatever suits you...try it bcz its fresh flavorsome and healthy!
3. Chocolate hazelnut shake
4. Must have pan cakes with vanilla on the side and extra maple. :p :p

I have visited this place many times but never felt the need to write a review. This place is a small n quaint cafe and i love the feel of it. The menu is amazing and varied. I have tried their waffle sandwiches, the pita pockets, mushroom crepes and a lot of desserts.

The grilled veg pesto waffle sandwich that i had was very good in flavor but it lacked texture. The veggies are supposed to be firm and crisp but they were very soggy and i couldn't make out the peppers from the carrots. 

But i must say that the sweet dishes in this place are Amazing. I have tried the cheesecakes, gelato sundaes and crepes. But i must say that blueberry pancake stole my heart. I have never tasted anything better.

I will definitely go back for some more soon.

I have heard a lot about Piccadilly Square, and I have been wanting to visit the place for a long time. I finally went there on the 31st of December,2013-with my boyfriend.
We went in the morning. The restaurant had just opened for the day. We sat down and we were given the menus. We ordered the Mad About Mushrooms(savory crepe) and the Dublin Mudslide(waffle).
After waiting for about 10 minutes, the crepes arrived. I must say, the presentation was quite good. They served a creamy sauce at the side. Overall, the crepe was delicious, the mushroom were of good quality.
After about another 10 minutes, the Dublin Mudslide came. I was completely blown over by the presentation and the taste. It was simply divine. I enjoyed adding more and more chocolate sauce on the waffle, from the bowl they provided.
The bill was about Rs 460, a little expensive, but worth it.
However, I felt that the service was not up to the mark. Thus I am deducting one mark. The waiters were quite slow in taking or serving orders. We had to signal for taking the order, and for giving us the bill. One of the waiters was continuously staring at us while we were eating. It made us feel quite uncomfortable.
Overall, a nice experience at Piccadilly Square. I look forward to visiting it again... :)

A cute place with yummy cheesecakes! This is how I will describe Picadilly Square! Although a bit on the costlier side, the food served here will make up for the hole in your pockets! I visited again a few weeks back and ordered for a Viva I'talia sandwich, a Corn and Veggie sandwich, Classic Blueberry Cheesecake and a Chocolate Swirl cheesecake! Chhesecakes are heavenly over here and if you have a kind of liking for this, Picadilly Square is a must visit for you! I would love to visit PS again and I wish the team all the success for future! :)

P.S. I wish they start serving Non Veg dishes ! I am an out an out Non Vegetarian and I seldom visit places only serving veg delicacies! I truly wish PS serves yummy chicken sandwiches as well ! :P ;)

This place claims to specialize in European street food. But European street food is in most cases non vegetarian. Europe cannot even imagine pancakes and waffles being cooked without eggs. India however is a different story altogether with its large vegetarian population. Those who have had pancakes and waffles made with eggs and those made without eggs will agree that the ones containing eggs taste better. This is not to demean vegetarians or veg food but just the presence of the egg as an ingredient gives these kinds of food a different layer of flavour and texture. The ones one gets here are without eggs. And they are almost as good as ones with eggs. The waffles sandwiches or the classic waffles are really delicious and flavourful be it the sweet ones or the savoury ones. The case is much the same with the pancakes. There are no savoury pancakes of course. Also I am pretty fond of the crepes. Especially the Caribbean Breeze. There is just one panini sandwich I like the name of which I fail to recall as of now. The Greek food is not that great in my opinion. The cheesecakes are also average at best. I really like the orange julep and their espresso is also among the better ones in town, which means their coffee is good. For a cafe the service is good enough and I have never found any reasons to complain about. The best thing I like about this place is the outdoor seating arrangement. Lazy and foggy winter morning and pancakes or waffles and a shot of espresso. I'll have to do this again. Soon.

I have been a huge fan of this restaurant and swear by its dishes. Popeye's Pick and dublin Mudslides are my favourite. Despite being a small place, the welcoming nature of the staff shall compensate for the same. Its a GO TO place for those who love cheese and chocolates. I cant recall any dish of Piccadilly that has tasted bad.

Went for desserts...had Mt.Cocoa...it was chocolate cake in a cute heart shape along with strawberry gelato...it was quite delicious! 

At 190 including tax with the quantity served it's definitely a steep price! 

Place has two sections inside and outside. Not very big around 10 tables in total. 

Can be tried again!

So, after reading such lovely reviews on Zomato, decided to visit this place with a friend. First impression, the place is really adorable.....yes, its kinda small, but I feel that it just adds to the cuteness ! :) The menu is quite vast, and the descriptions of the dishes (divided in sections according to the countries they belong to) makes you wanna have all of them ! So after quite a debate we decided on Popeye's Pick, Blueberry Swirl Cheesecake and Dublin Mudslide. We also ordered  a Dark Mocha Frappachino and a Caramel Frappachino for me and my friend respectively.

The food arrived fast. The Dark Mocha drink was really yummy....thick and chocolaty ! The Popeye's Pick was served next...the combination of the warm crepe with the cheesy corn and spinach was delicious. And its not easy for a vegetarian dish to impress me ! Next came the Cheesecake.....it was presented beautifully. We liked it alright....but probably we had expected a bit more. Next arrived my favorite part of the meal....the Dublin Mudslide.....Belgian waffles covered with chocolate fudge sauce and served with chocolate gelato. And it was served with extra sauce on the side ! Simply divine.....We both loved it ! 

By the end of it, we were quite full, but finished every bit of our yummy meal. Pocket pinch is a wee bit on the higher side but the desserts kinda make up for it. Definitely a place I would return to. 4.5 stars from me. :)

I again dropped in at Piccadilly Square today evening with my friends.
Yes, they recognized me from my frequent visits :P

This time, I ordered :
Popeye's Pick (Read : crepe)
Mad about Cheese (Read : waffle)
Blueberry Blast (Read : pancakes)
Strawberry Cheesecake

Both the crepe and the pancakes were fabulous. My friends were overjoyed after eating the crepe. The creamy layer coated around the delicious crepe that had stuffing of corn and cheese was to die for!
The Blueberry Blast was as usual fabulous.
But what took us by surprise was the Mad about cheese waffle and the strawberry cheesecake.
Yes I've had the cheesecake before. Its to die for. Today, they also put a berry on top which made it even better.

But the waffle was seriously good. The corn and cheese combination goes really well.
The creamy cheese mized wd corn and biscuity taste of waffle was a real treat to the taste buds.
Do give this place a visit :)

Happy eating guys,
Cheers.



----- 17 Nov, 2013 -----

I again dropped in to Piccadilly Square this afternoon after a sumptuous meal, the reason being I did not have desserts today and secondly my sweet tooth craving brought me here. AGAIN. :D

So, today I decided to unravel a bit more from the last time.
I kept two old items and added up two new. A safe calculation you see :p

This bistro has literally been driving me crazy since the time I first entered this place. This is just so wow. Wish I lived next to PS.
I again have no words for the team PS coz they are outstanding.
And the best part was they actually recognized me :D
Yaaaay! 

This time I ordered :

Summer Blush (It wasnt summer but I wanted to have something cold)
Popeye's Pick (Read : Savoury Crepe)
Blueberry Blast (Read : Pancake)
Strawberry Cheesecake.

Today was one of the best experience I ever had here.
The food was outstanding.

The summer blush is always refreshing. Do try it. Its tangy and it tasty ;)

Popeye's pick was a discovery for me. This savoury crepe is made with a stuffing of spinach and corn which is amazing. I would recommend this if I had to suggest a savoury crepe. And for the sweet ones, Banana Cabana or there is this crepe with pineapple stuffing. Do ask them. (Read : Carribean flavours)
Popeye's pick is a gem. Do try.

Technically, because its PS, I'd ask you to try anything yet you will never get dissapointed :D

Okay next up, my favourite blueberry blast. They serve you two hot pancakes with ooodles of blueberry sauce on it. A total knocker! 

And my second discovery was the strawberry cheesecake. It was just fabulous. The strawberry flavours burst into my mouth to fill me with a complete edgy feel of the tangy cheese cake and the beautiful firm yet softness :D

Do try!

Will wrap up here. I shall be back soon.
Till then,
Happy eating guys.
Cheers! :)

Another evening spent well at Piccadilly Square. A s I've mentioned before, this bistro can offer you a LOT more than you can imagine. They have delicacies of France, Belgium, Venice, Britain and what not.
This little cafe can lift up your mood in minutes - be it a break up, or a bad hair day ! :D
Ambience is very soothing and they have a very good collection of music running in the backdrop. No-nonsense stuff okay!
The painting are quirky and I am sure you'll love it. And the street lights. I am so infatuated. !
Yes, I totally love this place.

Ambience : : 4.5/5

Last time I went there, it was my birthday. The staff were very warm and helpful. We were a hungry bunch of six and created total chaos but they smiled it away!
They even presented me with a cute complimentary cupcake with happy birthday written on it. Thank you Team PS. 

This time I walked in with a friend. The staff as usual were warm and smiling. They greeted us nicely and after we seated ourselves, we panned our eyes through the menu. Everything and simply everything seemed to scream a "EAT ME FIRST" expression to me! :P
This is one place where I order more than 3 dishes at one go! xD
PS : I had told the staff to serve the dishes one by one because we had ordered 6 things in a row !

We placed the order and after the staff was gone, I started staring at the road outside. It was drizzling which made it even better. This is my favourite thing here because they have a beautiful glass frame window that lets you see the hurrying and scurrying world outside. I mean isnt it a bliss to have savoury crepes, a warm latte and watch the world outside ? I love it totally.

So, after a meagre wait of 5 mins, here what landed at our table : :
1. Hazelnut Latte
2. Mad About Mushroom Crepe
3. Blueberry Blast Pancakes
4. Chocolate Fudge Brownie with chocolate sauce topping
5. Banana Cabana Crepe
6. All Chocolate Cupcake & Lemon Cupcake.

The hazelnut latte came brewing hot and tasted very nice.  The taste of hazelnut created whirlpool in my head. The climate was chilly and because it was drizzling, I thought a latte would be just fine and so it was. The latte was made to perfection and the smell felt so nice. 
Then, came the mad about mushroom crepe. Its a savoury crepe. The taste of mushroom and the sauce gave the crepe an edge over all other savouries because a mushroom lover would definitely know that mushrooms are a delight in themselves. The taste of mushrooms and the sauce blended very well with the crepe. Only one complain, my crepe kept tearing :(
The pancakes were brilliant! The blueberry blast was a treat to the eyes, the nostrils, the taste buds, the eardrums too! :D
It sounds so nice.
The were made very nicely and the sour zing of the blueberry went just perfectly with it. Last time, the pancakes were moist, but this time just right and firm! Full marks. :)
I do not know about the brownie because my friend had it. I assume it was awesome because he did not want to share it with me :(
Then came one of my favourite here - the banana cabana crepe. Its s sweet crepe. Ok guys, last time I cudnt tell the name of the syrup which was an add-on the crepe. Its caramel syrup. The caramel syrup just adds to the flavour of the banana crepe. It was delicious. I almost ate the entire crepe without sharing.
The last rites were performed by the cupcakes. Again, I chose the lemon cupcake because I love the sour taste of lemons. Its pretty quirky and my friend has the all chocolate cupcake. The lemon cupcake was just fine with the sourness of the lemon and the taste of the cupcake being balanced at finer level.
Eating all this, I finally made a move though I was in no hurry. The staff here is really sweet and does not bother or pester any of their customers. They give you the privacy you need and offer you delicious food simultaneously.

The bill came up to Rs. 878/- which I felt was just right. One thing I can very well say with confidence is that this place is not overpriced. AT ALL.
Just the right pricing for the right dishes.

My tummy's full from all the crepes and sweetness I savoured.
Go and enjoy a lovely evening here. I am sure it'll be wonderful.
 Happy eating guys.

Food : : 5/5

PS : If you love Europe, Piccadilly Square is Times Square for you :D
Cheers! :)

Team PS, You guys are fab   : )
Love and sweet tooth cravings for more stuff!



----- 20 Sep, 2013 -----

This pretty little bistro can offer you more that your tummy can actually take. Sitting placidly, on Sarat Bose Road, 
Piccadilly Square is one fine European bistro you would die to visit time and again.
It was my first time there, but the amazing impression that they've created left me spellbound. I'd love to go there again (In fact I'm planning a visit soon)

The fine glass frame right outside is very nice. Seating arrangement - cosy . To be honest, the space is  a problem but then not a problem actually. Cobbled floors, very posh looking indeed.
The little lights warm up the place and I love the paintings on the wall and those European street lights. (How I only saw them in movies). Ambience : : 5/5

The menu is just vast and you have so  much to choose from. I was very perplexed when it came to choosing something that I wanted to eat because whatever I read in the menu, made me want to taste it. However, I finally decided on this gorging delicious meal that follows : : 
We ordered Hazelnut Latte, Very Creamy Mushroom Waffle, Banana Cabana Crepe, and Chocolate Cheesecake.
I would swear by Virgin Mary, the hazelnut latte was all frothy and chocolaty and caramel like (whatever you may call it)
The very creamy mushroom waffle was bit spicy which actually pleased the taste buds. I loved every bit of it. The next delicacy was the Banana Cabana Crepe which was devastatingly fabulous. I almost downed myself in those pieces of banana that lay hidden inside the crepe. It was probably topped with chocolate or maple syrup which was just sinful.
Last but not the least, the Chocolate Cheesecake was delicious and a lot calorific actually (that does not stop me from gorging on it like a madman) The small biscuit layer beneath fit the bill perfectly with the thick white layer above that mixed perfectly with the chocolate that sat on top notch. Very very impressive. Food : : 4.5/5

Pocket pinch : : 500-600 for two

PS : : Do not mind the pocket pinch. Trust me, it is worth for money.  If your tummy is craving Europe, do visit Piccadilly Square. It is the ULTIMATE fantasy land for foodies. Cheers guys! :)
And the Piccadilly Team, I love you so much :'D

Amazing place :) went there on basis of of zomato reviews n trust me it was worth a visit.. i savorued the flavor of  almost everything.. the Italian grilled sandwich was the best but neither the crepe nor the gelato with chocolate sauce was any less.

The ambiance was good.. a cool place to hang out with friends or drop in just to have a good time.

Will visit the place soon again to try the other delicacies.

The corn a 'la mode (not sure if I got the spelling right) is to die for. I am a big corn freak and their preparation is the best that I have tasted so far. Some of the chocolate shakes/drinks are OK.

My sisters and I went there post a horrible lunch at Soho Bistro where we did not eat anything after the quesadilas and trust me it was worth every penny. 
The ambiance is perfect for a hangout with friends/siblings, the decor very European, and the food is finger-licking good.
We ordered Popeye's pick which just melted in our mouths and I have this to say to the Chef - Respect brother.
We also ordered a Choco Dazzle which was the best desert I had after Berry'd Alive in Bangalore. 
The menu said this about Choco Dazzle: "be dazzled by the goodness of smooth melting chocolate smeared over golden brown pancakes" and I definitely agree :-)
The pricing is value for money and I regret that I could not try out other mouth-watering dishes on their menu.
But I have promised myself that I will come back in December and try the Cheesecakes, Hazelnut Latte, Very Creamy Mushroom Waffle, Banana Cabana Crepe, etc.

To start with my review,had an awesome experience at 'PICADILLY SQUARE'..The environment is quite pleasant and suitable for having a great desserts..
Starting with the crepes,i and a fre
Iend of mine ordered a mushroom crepe and one banana crepe...having a sweet-tooth myself,i enjoyed the banana crepe.
All the creaminess just blowed my mind off..great dish with lots of different flavours..
Next one is my favourite.
Blueberry pancakes..ohhh!!! Still can taste them..the tangyness of the blueberry just cuts the sweetness a bit..it just melts in the mouth..really cant explain the awesomeness of the variety of flavours in it..DOUBLE THUMBS UP!!!
Then came the brownie..ohhh man..one isn't enough,is it??
The soft brownie with the hot choco sauce..yum yum yum...DELICIOUSO

Piccadilly square is a small restaurant situated in sarat bose road which has 4-5 tables. The ambience here is awesome. The place is small but the food here is too good. The staff here are very friendly and cooperative. One going here should definitely try mushroom crepe,falafel and sandwiches. It also serves one of the best waffles and blueberry cheesecake in the city.

Piccadilly Square made me wish I had my first date there!! Everything about the place is mesmerising and I couldn't control my delight when I came to know that it is fully vegetarian(something to look forward to during Navratris ;-) )

The food (yes proper food, not only desserts) tastes great and also looks the part, compelled us to try almost everything on the sexy menu(I mean really!). Some recommendations:

Popeye's pick, which just melted in my mouth and tasted like the best lasagne I ever had (though it wasn't one :D). 

Desserts: Banana Cabana Crepe was amazing and Divine chocolate Freddo rivalled the Gelato served in 5 stars! Team it up with a Chocolate Hazelnut shake(pic attached) to get high on chocolate! If in confusion, you can always seek help from the cheerful staff. 

Dinner or desserts, party or date or just a casual hangout, cakes or ice creams: Piccadilly is a perfect one stop destination for all you might imagine :-)

This place is known for its crepes, waffles and cheesecakes. It is a small European bistro and i come here quite often. Quite a cosy little place and remains full all the time. I am personally fond of their creamy corn waffles,mushroom crepe, pancake with vanilla sauce, blueberry cheesecake and chocolate devotion. Walk in anytime to grab a quickie and you'll love the options they offer.

Conveniently located right on Sarat Bose Road (near Minto Park), Piccadilly Square is a small but terribly comfortable place to spend a few hours with the divine culinary discovery of CHOCOLATE, among other things (ranging from savoury to desserts). Aesthetically furnished with wooden chairs and tables, and cobbled floors, the restaurant is reminiscent of a European deli. 
 
Of what I've had: 
 
Choco Dazzle: 
To quote the menu, "be dazzled by the goodness of smooth melting chocolate smeared over golden brown pancakes". And I agree. Apart from the rare times that miserly proportions were served, the pancakes have been laden with rich amounts of delightful chocolate (that does *dazzle* your senses) on most occasions. 
  
Paprika Potatoes: 
Comprising herb waffles served with saut√©ed potatoes and hot salsa sauce, it is 'lip-smacking'-ly delicious but I only wish they would raise the proportions of each component because, on its own, it can just about feed one person.  
 
Dublin Mudslide: 
It consists of waffles generously doused in a mouth-watering chocolate fudge sauce and topped with a scoop of chocolate gelato - a "trio made in heaven" indeed.  
 
Celestial chocolate: 
Cr√™pes infused with Belgian chocolate and chocolate-hazelnut sauce - the chocolate is truly otherworldly. 
 
Grilled Potatoes: 
Cheese-grilled potatoes sandwiched between waffles and served with mayonnaise - the potatoes are of satisfactory quality and the dish was almost bland. 
 
Blueberry Swirl Cheesecake: 
Served on a neat, white doily, it is delectable (and a personal favourite). The biscuit base is as good as the cheesecake itself - both of which melt in your mouth and give rise to terrific flavours. 
 
Cost for two, for a light meal comprising a minimum of three dishes, sums up to at least Rs. 500-600, inclusive of taxes. Service is spot on. The seldom inconsistent presentation and the proportions of each component of a dish remain to be my prime complaints with an otherwise good dining experience, albeit a slightly expensive one. 

p.s. The photographs have been taken by a friend.

Picadilly square located beside Soho on Sarat Bose Road is one amazing place you must try !!! The place is small and compact but inspite of that fact, they have managed to produce a great feel of european streets with the cobbled flooring and black posts. The open air seating space is not that good. The staff is courteous and warm. 

They serve waffles, pan cakes, focaccia sandwiches, crepes, cakes, salads, gelatos, shakes............ I have visited the place more often for their deserts and love their waffles, crepes, gelato. I cant think of a single time when i have visited and not had a choco dynamite waffle. I have not had much of their savouries but am convinced that they wont disappoint. Reading some of the other reviews, i feel bad to have not tried out the dublin mudslide but chcoco dynamite is to be blamed for that!! Looking forward to my dublin mudslide experience !!!

Wow!!
The first impression i had of the place as i entered is "can this small place meet the expectations?". And soon i found out that it actually raised the bar of expectations. Though a small place near Minto Park on Sarat Bose read, Piccadilly Square has a lot to offer. A wide variety of dishes to choose from. Loved the vanilla pan cake i had. it was 5/5. The waffles and the cheesecake were also worth noting. Overall, a "should go" place for people of all age groups. 

Ambience: 3/5
Food: 5/5
Service 4/5

Lets take a look at the plus points first- the ambiance nice, staff polite and comfortable chairs. Price- Not too high priced and not overtly low priced either. Food is good, especially the way it is served, looks beautiful, tastes above good and a little less than excellent. The problem would be the quantity. A dish ordered should be filling and this is where I guess, Piccadilly Square is a let down.. Overall, you would love to come back to this place again to have that calm lunch and nice conversation on a rainy day.

This 100% vegetarian place surprises me. Situated in a fantastic location Piccadily Square is a beautifully done Bistro. The floor and the dim light gives it a wonderful ambeince. 

Have been here many times for breakfast on Sundays, and undoubtedly, its always been a perfect start to the day. The eggless pancakes and waffles with chocolate sauce and maple syrup is heavenly. Also, the freshly made salad to which ingredients and dressings can be chosen and the toasted subs with a filling of your choice are good. 

The staff is nice and friendly, and the place is totally pocket friendly.

Only had time to pop in for 15 minutes before rushing off, so this review will probably need editing after a couple more trips down Sarat Bose Road, however, I'll do my best right now.
The quaint decor immediately drew me in. Love the dark wood flooring and the tables, the outdoor seating arrangement, the lovely, quirky paintings on the wall, the attention to detail. The menu was beautifully decorated, in keeping with the whole Parisian cafe theme with a hint of cartoon network that they have going. 
Ordered the cheesecake which was overpriced (in light of recent discovery of other cheesecake havens in the city), but delicious. It was served on its own doily too!
My friend ordered the fudge brownie which was served hot, but was more 'light chocolate cake minus frosting', than fudge. The walnuts were nice, but I have had better brownies for less at Nahoums' (New Market). 
Would love to try their waffles and the crepes (which, I am told, are delicious) before passing final verdict, but the place definitely has potential.

Foodies' delight!
Ambiance: The huge glass front wall, the cobblestone flooring, the muted, warm lights, the weaved-look of the chairs and an outside seating arrangement immediately make you feel like you are in a typical Parisian bistro! So bravo for the ambiance!
Service: The staff is cordial, efficient and I had no issues with their service yet. 
Food: Yummmmm is the only expression (not even the word!) that I can manage with a mouthful of their crepes or waffles or desserts....they are that good. Yes it is only veg (quite a shame?) but all I really care about is the food and the food here gets a thumbs up! The selection is quite varied covering mostly all the gastronomic countries of the European continent. So you will get crepes (French) beside waffles (Belgian), paninis (Italian) beside sandwiches (British/American) and fondues (Swiss) and they have recently introduced a few Mediterranean dishes (falafel, souvlaki) as well! The desserts spread is equally mouthwatering. From regular yummy gelatos to exotic cheescakes and freddos, all are just great! The prices are slightly on the higher side but this foodie cannot really complain though.
Recommendation: The mushroom crepes, the cheese and corn waffles, the Creme de la France pancakes and the chocolate devotion freddo are simply orgasmic! But try everything anyway to find your own turn-ons... :P

Visited after ages. For once the experience want so good. Tried a salad, which had little taste, too much tomato and annoying ugly hard crisps. very overpriced.

Also had a potato waffle sandwich. Was passable. Wish it was better flavored. Also the accompanying sauce was the same that was in the sandwich. Would have been nice if it was different. 

The choco shakes used to be rich and so tasty. I wonder what happened to it on the 13 February 2013 when I visited.

PS The main chef is known to me and has always been more than happy to help. He was not on duty on that day.



----- 20 Dec, 2012 -----

One of the rare vegetarian places that I will vouch for :)
Some of my personal favourites are:
1. Corn-ala-mode
2. The toasted sandwiches with your choice of fillings.
3. The pita wraps.
At one time I would regularly have a quick lunch at this outlet. The staff, especially the chef were very accommodating and friendly, and went out of their way to make sure I was satisfied.
The then newly launched cheesecakes I initially gorged on, but then soon had to take it easy on them!

Piccadilly Square has to be one of my most visited Bistros in Calcutta.
This one is located in Sarat Bose Road, in the same building as Great Eastern TechnoCity.
Since its conception I have been here innumerable times. According to me, It is HEAVEN for Vegetarians on a look out for "something new". It brought to Calcutta the trend of Waffles, Crepes and Fondues which were either unheard of before, or were only served at 5-star properties or Abroad. Almost every item on the menu tastes awesome. BUT The Dublin Mudslide is to DIE for (This is a Must for me. I don't remember a single time, when I went and haven't ordered it !)
Other favorites include Chocolate and Cheese Fondues, Popeye's Pick, Wild Berry, Gelatos, Falafel Souvlaki, Blueberry & Oreo Cheesecake :D Even the pastas are great !
They also have these 'Festivals' going on every now and then - Mexican, Italian, Cheesecake, the list goes on and on, which introduces new dishes. Currently they have a Mosaic Festival going on.. which clubs food and music ;) Their Awesome Foursome was great too. They have these cute Cake Pops, Tartlets, Mini Cupcakes etc which make great gifts.
It is a favorite among students and elders alike. Great work, Ms. Pooja Baid ! :)
What more?! - It's 100% Vegetarian. Brownie Points for that! Well, quite literally :P
If only it was a little bigger like the Alipore one, but nevermind.
Four and a Half Stars from me :)

Went in after the reviews from Zomato. Seriously, not worth the hype. Fell short of every expectation that I had on this place. Strictly veg and over-priced food is the forte of this cafe. Service sucks, they actually forgot to serve a cupcake we had ordered!! No apologies too!!
Their order boasts of several varieties but most of them are not available when you visit this place. The place is small and its tough to get a place to sit.
Will think thrice and maybe more before visiting this place again.

been to this place many times. simply adore the interiors, the staff is a bit hesitant. 

the cobbled flooring and the old english lights add a lot of character to the place. 

The crepes are of good quality especially the one with mushrooms and the corn crepe. 

even the sweet crepes are great too. although the waffles are much better. 

the selection of the salad bar is great too. the only disappointment is the coffee which i didn't quite enjoy.

Amazing lil place with a fine menu!
Limited no. of seats in the a.c. section but that's OK. A regular for college & school goers.
Loved the food over here.
Pita Sandwich was so-so. 3 out of 5.
Open Waffle Sandwich with Mushroom Sauce was yummy! A great preparation.
The savoury Crepes were very soft, and just melted away in the mouth.
The dessert:- DUBLIN MUDSLIDE (if i'm not wrong.)
Waffles with Chocolate Ice-cream and thick black chocolate sauce was just sumptuous!
But you will have to follow the mantra to eat the dessert: "IGNORANCE IS BLISS" because you will have to ignore the LOADS of calories to enjoy the dessert's absolute bliss! :)

Not very heavy on the pocket as well.
Wifey and me had a great dinner. The pocket pinch was just 700 bucks.
Located on Sarat Bose road opposite Hindustan club, it is very easily accessible for all Kolkatans!
A MUST VISIT place.
Non vegetarians will be disappointed as the place is Pure-veg.
But even so, a must visit!

not so good service,variety in cheesecakes is good,but the taste is not upto the mark as per the price.(it has a sandy taste,not soft enough and the sweetness doesnt properly blend in with the flavors)

This is hands down, my favorite spot in the town. I swear by it. Pancakes, they are indulging & they on top of it call it - "Must Have Pancakes" @ Rs 75/-.

I can visit them any number of times. It's a beautiful Italian street like setup with vintage lights and stone flooring. Really peaceful too. They have a range of salads & sandwiches too!

The Cheesecake here is really good-especially the blueberry one. Perfect place for the strictly vegetarian (no eggs,onion garlic etc) people who are looking for dessert  and dining options.

Excellent food. But a bit slow in service. Good place for a brunch on Sunday morning.

Painstakingly made it to Picadilly Square on a Saturday morning around 11AM, eagerly anticipating a nice meal of bangers and mash. Firstly there is NO parking anywhere (we had to park at a nearby office complex under the pretext that we were 'getting stuff printed'). 
So we walk in and look at the menu. Vegetarian, vegetarian, vegetarian. English breakfast?? European breakfast? Certainly not! they dont even use eggs! no potatoes, no onions, no eggs, no meat! What kind of breakfast place is this??
Avoid, unless youre a marwari who just came back from London for the first time. We had to settle for *sigh* south indian
