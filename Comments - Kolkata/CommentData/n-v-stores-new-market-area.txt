This place serves the most massive and best tasting sandwiches. I haven't had such great sandwiches even at bigger eateries. 
Pros:
1. Massive sandwiches. If you are having a shallow stomach you need to share one whole sandwich. 
2. Perfect taste. 

Cons: 
1. You have to eat out in the street .
2. A little pocket pinching, but totally worth it.
