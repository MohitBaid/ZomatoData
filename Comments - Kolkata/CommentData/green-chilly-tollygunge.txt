Ordered dinner from this place last night, for two mughlai paranthas and a side of chicken butter masala (dry). The pocket pinch was pretty reasonable! Costed only 250 bucks.
Quantity of the aloo subji accompanied with the parantha was served for one portion, which was disappointing. The chicken butter masala was not authentic or even was not close to being one. Also there was kind of a umami smell to the dish. Best part was mughlai, which was filled with succulent chicken pieces and a crisp exterior.
So, for ordering next time have to rethink my choices from this eatery.

Its a small Chinese food joint. No seating available its a only take away joint. Food is very delicious. A must try is pan fried chicken momo. The quantity they give is too much satisfying. Taste profile is also very good. All these in a very reasonable rate. Must try you will love it.

Had placed an order via swiggy to try their starters. Among the options available i opted for the following:-

1. Fish kabiraji- Egg coated fish fillet served with salad & kasundi. The fish was fresh. The size was very good & the kabiraji was thick in size. Tastewise it was great.

2. Chicken clear soup- Thick broth of soup which consisted of capsicum,tomatoe,chicken pieces,cabbage strips. Very simple looking soup yet packed with delicate flavours. Loved every spoonful of it.

3. Hot & sour chicken soup- Light & filled with lots of chicken and vegetables. Not very spicy like you would find in all places. The spice factor was considerably on the milder side. Tasted good.

4. Chicken kabiraji- Same as the fish version,the chicken fillet was solid with good coating of spices. The fillet was nicely cooked & was equally tender. Good taste

This place offers pocket friendly food. The packing of food is also top notch. Looking forward to try more of their items üëç

Do not know how the food is but I ordered the food and its been more than an hour and the restaurant has not delivered the food. Zomato showed that it will be delivered before so and so time but when I called the restaurant the person said it may take yet another 30 minutes! dying of hunger.

I had given online order. The order was accepted but suddenly at the time of delivery they just cancelled the order. The is just irresponsible attitude.

Ordered from this place around 100 of times via FoodPanda. Food is really good considering the price it offers. Can be your daily place to order snacks while partying at home.

I really like to order from this place when there is plan of sitting and eating at home at affordable prices. They make great starters and chicken side dishes along with fried rice or noodles. The quantity served is huge and the pocket pinch is not at all felt. When it comes to home-delivery, they serve the same in no time.

We ordered some food from this outlet for home delivery at my workplace. We ordered the Crispy Chilly Baby Corn, Dry Chili Lamb, Egg Chicken Rice Noodles, Veg. Fried Rice, Shanghai Chicken, Shredded Chilly Lamb, Honey Chicken. The overall food taste is not up to the mark. The Rice Noodles too much fried, the lamb were hard, the chicken preparation were ok. The price is little bit costed according to the taste.
