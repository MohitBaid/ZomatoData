There sabji is like soup. NEVER ORDERING AGAIN. The paneer butter marsala was tasteless and watery and downright disgusting. Terrible quality, waste of money.

Ordered paneer butter masala and aloo methi from this place. Both the vegetables were okay. I found it a little oily . But I order from this place when my mom is away. The taste is like ghar ka khana. The aunty is very polite. And the service is good.
