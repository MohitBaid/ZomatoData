A nice place for buddies to catch up for drinks. Place is neat and offers drinks at very reasonable price. The food tastes good enough and you won't get the opportunity to complain about anything here.

Of course, this ain't a place for a family gathering for dinner or anything cause the ambience and the crowd won't suit the situation.

Not for family...but one of the best places to visit for stags...especially during 3.30 - 7.30. They have the most well behaved band in Kolkata. Food quality is good. All the staffs are well behaved and are working there for many years. The d√©cor is average. but the behavior of the staff will overrule all others deficiencies.
