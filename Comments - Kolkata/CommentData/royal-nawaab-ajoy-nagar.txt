The food quality is good, taste is also ok. We had naan and chicken its was quite good. The place is quite simple but it's ok if you are looking for a simple place with decent food.

Good service - Polite and efficient.
Ambience is pretty average. Clean tables. 
Most of the food items are good. Well priced. Good at what it does. If you want pocket friendly North Indian or Mughlai cuisine in the area, this would be a good option.

Liked the delivery service,on time and hot food.
Coming to food,the indian gravy dishes of mutton was good. biryani was moderate but quantity was enough.tandoori roti was stiff by the way.
Overall,impressed.

This is a small restaurant with average food.  The nawaabi special chicken biryani was average. The North indian dishes are a bit better. They offer a lot of item in the menu list.

Location - Easily accessible  on the main road ( close to big brands like Shiraz)
Price - very easy on the pocket
Taste - not the best as its a bit oily yet does justice to the price
Recommended. However, would prefer this place for a take away.

Located next to Shiraz golden restaurant and haji Ali Restauarnt, this small places receives a stiff competition yet manages to hold it's own against these two chains.

Priced very reasonable and taste doing justice. Opted for a take away and happy that I got my money's worth. Recommended.

Yesterday afternoon I was looking for a new restaurant for Biryani near to my area, Ajoynagar.
Only alibaba, Shiraz, Haji Ali and khawab are the main outlets if you want to have Biryani.
These are common to all as well.
So, decided to go to Royal Nawab, a new restaurant in Ajoynagar.
Ordered Mutton with egg Biryani and Chicken chap.
Asked for some dry items in chicken.
A staff recommended not to have chilly chicken dry with Biryani.
Wtf!!!!
Who's gonna ask this !!!!
Whatever, order came very late.
Biryani was like ghee salty rice mixed with few drops of keora water and rose water and shahi garam masala
Pathetic!!!!
Chicken chap was good compared to biryani.
Though, sweet.
Chicken Leg piece was also small enough.
Price is cheap
Staffs are well behaved
That's all.

My suggestion is please improve food quality.
If you want to be real royal Nawab, try to compete with the big names like Only alibaba, Haji Ali, Shiraz (Ajoynagar outlet not good)etc...

29/09/16 Been here today with a group of friends. We were very hungry. So we ordered chicken byriani. It's very light and good in taste.  Overall it's quite a nice place to spend sometime with friends.

Though it's new in this area but couldn't compete with the big daddies of indian food in this area like Haji Ali and Ali baba.
Food was quite okay in starting, with time it has started getting awful. Be it there mutton dishes or just a simple plate of biryani. I would recommend to try out other restaurants in ajoynagar rather than going here.

We have been decently regular at this joint during our lunch hours. (Atleast twice a week) 
I would say, avoid mutton at all costs. The biryani is average too. The only good part is when you have breads with North Indian dishes. The latter is a value for money deal.
They know us by face now, haha. Will share more pics soon or checkout my insta page.
