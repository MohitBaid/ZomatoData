I ordered for my In-Law's anniversary , was surprised to see the quality and freshness of the cake. The owner was very responsive to our requirements and ever engaging. Very polite and on time delivery. It was a fantastic experience right from ordering then customizing and ultimately the delivery! Its a 5 star!

Great bakes at reasonable prices, Chef Prantik brings his considerable experience as a 5 star hotel chef into play and bakes cakes that will melt in your mouth! Hard to get cakes of such quality at these prices! A wholehearted 5 star is what #C4CC deserves.
