Santa in US = Santa Claus

Santa in Kolkata = Santa Delivers

Was quite unhappy when did nothing last X-mas, no celebrations, no gifts, no trees, no cakes, nothing! However, our own Desi Santa i.e. Santa Delivers compensated more than expected by delivering happiness to our doorsteps i.e. delectable food!

Based in Sector 2, Saltlake, this is a delivery only outlet, which ensures you get a more than dine in comfort even when you are dining at home or at work!

Packing – Neat, hassle free, noteworthy that they serve food in microwaveable containers – an unprecedented initiative by the management – as these are quite costly! Expect breads in silver foils, main course and starters in containers and salads etc in plastic packets!

Delivery – Bang on time – again, since they have 2 outlets – 1 in Kasba also, hence, they can deliver at both North and South Kolkata!

Food – We foodie friends tried countless items and I hereby enumerate only the veg ones which I tasted: -

i)	Crispy chilli baby corns – A perfect beginning to a perfect meal - crispy babies topped with sesame seeds and served with lots of onion and capsicum slices. At least ½ a plate is required for satiating oneself!

ii)	Tandoori Aloo – Sweet / Sour masala stuffed to hollow ½ slices of potatoes, served with slices of capsicum – goes indeed well with the masala salad!

iii)	Paneer tikka – Gigantic paneer cubes kebabified to perfection, served with slices of tomatoes, onions, capsicum – don’t forget to bathe the same in the mind-boggling mint chutney before having this one!

iv)	Masala salads – Onions sprinkled with spices and lemon dressing – not to be missed while having the kebabs!

v)	Mixed chopped salads – Did not taste

vi)	Mint chutney – Refer above

vii)	Paneer butter masala – Very rich, creamy, slightly sweet and tasty!

viii)	Dal Makhani – Somewhat highly dilute but still awesome!

ix)	Malai Kofta – Creamy and overly sweet, huge pieces – so huge, I could devour only 1!

x)	Veg fried rice – Chopped veggies and rice fried in low oil without compromising the taste! So light, that you can have this even after you are full!

xi)	Butter naan - Fine

xii)	Masala kulcha – Indeed their signature bread – Awesome masala stuffing and coriander toppings – regret I could have only ½ a slice.

xiii)	Onion salad with green chillies and lemons – To make the meal a perfect meal!

xiv)	Papads

Overall, it was more of a picnic experience. Quantity served is so high that we were struggling to finish even 2 plates of food each! Again, quality of food and service is pretty high!

Prices are commensurate to what they serve and 2 full tummies might cost you approx. 500 bucks!

I am grateful to the management of Santa Delivers for an experience of this calibre and wish them loads of luck! The place is suitable for those lazy foodies who don’t bother driving down to their favourite eateries and would rather prefer food being delivered to their place! They also suit the shift-working population of Sector 5 and New Town as their delivery hours range as below: -

12 Noon to 3 pm

6 pm to 4 am

They are akin to sudden mid-night cravings also as they serve till early morning!

Enough being said, go ahead and get your palate of happiness delivered to your doorstep now!

Santa delivers 🎅

No matter it's AM or PM
good food will be delivered by them 🍜

Late night and on time food delivery is their one of the speciality..

Containers and packaging was perfect. that's the reason the food was hot even after one and half hour.. Ps- containers are microwave Friendly.

So our menu was-

Chicken butter masala- It was mildly smooth buttery but spicy. Highly recommended with butter nun or kulcha . It was actually tasted like Delhi style typical butter chicken. I Loved it.

Paneer butter masala- Paneer's place was average to me after all am a hardcore non vegetarian. Paneer was soft and as per my knowledge maybe it was homemade not bought from random market

Dal makhani- it was rich creamy dal. Must try !!

Malai kofta- this one was best among the veg item.it was very rich and creamy ..it goes well with nun or jeera rice.


Mix fried rice - i loved it personally cuz it tasted like homemade not over fried ..overall quantity and prwan, chicken and egg's ratio was enough to make me happy.

Chilly chicken & chilly fish -  both was almost same but according to me fish slices should be more juicy.. otherwise fine enough..

Crispy chilli babycorn - quantity, quality and taste everything made me happy...must try starter !!

Tandoori aloo - new thing I have noticed they stuffed spicy and sweet mixture in aloos.thn made them tandoor.

Paneer tikka - as I said earlier about paneer chunks was soft it must be homemade..well marinated with spices which made tasty ..

Chicken tikka - it must be their speciality ..their chicken tikka can give tough competition with many branded outlet.

Their Indian food is very special and authentic.they are favourite of many people for reasonable price and late night delivery option.

The food you are offered by them is more about it's efficiency & utlity than it's flavors.

Why so?
We were late from work thus had to order from zomato at around 1.30 am, frankly speaking, it's tough to get yourself covered by delivery partners when you're staying in salt lake, that too in sector-5.

But their delivery is prompt.

Food?
We ordered Butter Chicken & Roti.

Butter Chicken tasted a bit flat, irony?
We hardly had a communication with BUTTER 😂
But flavours were not that rich and was moderately spicy keeping in mind the late night meal scenario and the follow up thereafter.

What is to be considered is the price.
Roti's - They charge ₹12 for roti which resembles to each roti a normal street shop of kolkata has to offer.
A discount,coupon or maybe a reduction of atleast 20% in the price may give this place a good push up.

Point's UP straightaway and the reason being their initiative of providing food to the night owls and covering up for the late dinner scenes and saving the starvation.

Period.

Ok Food. Late night and a hungry stomach, you won’t mind ordering from this place. Too more than an hour to come. Chicken was hard, ate it with the gravy and nan. Thankfully nan was soft.

Deducting 1 point as ZOMATO made late food home-delivery for the first time and that 2 on Xmas.😤😤😤But nevertheless, the food was still hot and was packed in beautiful containers. The Egg-shrimp mixed biriyani along with fish curry was the pick of the day. Never before I have tasted such yummy mixed biriyani as it was perfectly blended with different flavours and ingredients. Moreover, the fish balls were prepared in such a way that it easily melted in rima oris. Giving 5/5 to SD for providing nice palatable experience on Xmas. Keep up the good work SD👍👍

When you have a midnight food carving, do not look anywhere. It is a reliable option to order in midnight. Food is good and service time is as promised while ordering

Mumbai girl in Kolkata. I had a late night flight to Kolkata and was really hungry around 330 am and this place came to my rescue.
What we ordered-
∆ Schezwan noodles 2/5- This was not good but thn again I got food at 430am in Kolkata so I didn't really mind.
∆ chispy babycorn- 3.5/5- This was nicely prepared and the portion size was also generous. Must order.

Overall this place could be better but atleast they deliver late night and IL definitely order again.

Ordered Paneer tikka roll and lime burst from this restaurant. The food was well wrapped but tasted okayish. Lime burst was not worth my money. Time it took for delivery was horrible!!!

Ordered chicken biryani many times from this place. Always tastes very good. The quantity and quality of their biryani is good. This time we ordered chicken lollipop which consisted of 6 pcs each plate. The chicken was finely good with right amount of spices. Not oily and also not much spicy which makes it ideal for everyone to have it. But their packaging is not good when it comes to chicken lollipop .

Thank You, Santa Delivers
