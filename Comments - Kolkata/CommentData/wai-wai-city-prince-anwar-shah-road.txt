I wish I could give a higher rating than 5...
Indeed the best place I've been too...
I just love the location,interiors and ambience.
It's small yet a comfortable place.
Located in the opposite foot of South City mall. It's a splendid place.
Visited here twice. 
Will go back sometime soon.

You always get a feeling that every noodle place in the city is Indianizing itself. If you have ate from one, every other restaurant seems to serve the same food. Not this one though. Absolute must try. You can customize your own noodles. I did it, and it did turn out pretty great. Keep it up.

I've never had something so bad. It was so bad I can't even explain. Worst thing I've ever had. Can't believe noodles can taste so bad. Try to improve your service otherwise you'll be forced to shut down by people.

This place is completely  overrated.It is situated opposite to South City Mall.It has a clean and cheerful ambience.But that's where the pros end.The couple of staff manning the counter do not have coordination  among themselves.My order was served & then taken back for the egg to be added in it.The had overlooked the details of the order earlier.As for the food,paying 198 bucks for a single helping of wai wai with an omelette in it ,is quite expensive.It had some kind of a hot sauce with a peanut flavour in it.Halfway through the box in which it was served,I found the wai wai completely uncooked & in lumps.It was completely  inedible.Would never recommend  this place to anyone.Utter waste of money.

It's newly opened. Nice menu. Self service. Quantity is good enough. The place was empty though visited around afternoon. Darsan was really yum. The staffs are not so co-operative while deciding the menu though provided with the good timely.A nice small joint for snacking.

Located just opposite South City Mall. The interior is very slick with welcoming atmosphere. But seating space is limited. We ordered Tokyo express, Kung Pao delight and Bang bang noodles. As expected, the noodle base is Wai Wai. However all dishes are veg. We had to order Sliced Chicken for add on. Washed it down with Spicy Mango which was pretty ordinary. Food was very spicy so if you are not a fan of spicy food, look elsewhere. Price is on a higher side of reasonable. And it's self service. Would visit again.

I had been invited here with couple of other bloggers. The place is cute and chic and the concept is modern. With a plethora of wok concepts entering the city of joy, this is also kind of ‚Äúwai wai‚Äù wok concept. The concept is like choose your toppings and your favorite sauces and tell them what you want and don‚Äôt want in your box and they will prepare a wok box for you. Also, there are limited items apart from the main wok box which you can order separately. It started its first outlet from the niche area i.e. Delhi‚Äôs Haus Khas Village and slowly seems to expand over franchisees over India.¬†It is more like a quick service restaurant, the noodle bar incorporated from the iconic noodle brand wai wai which we usually have it in our house as a savior when hunger strikes.+

There's a reason this place usually remains deserted despite seeming lavishly decorated and well managed. 

The food is terrible.

We tried the make your own noodles gimmick. It's been done to death already so why not. We tried hot Schezwan sauce, with corn and a few other veggies (you get to choose 4) and we topped it off with fried onions, a personal favourite.

And boy were we disappointed.

Firstly, the price tag. It was 176 bucks.

One. Seventy. Six.
For a single packet of noodles that cannot be more than 10 rupees. But of course, they have to make a profit, there's materials, labour yada yada. Fine, let's just move along.

The Schezwan sauce was about as spicy as a head of cabbage. The noodles were soggy and didn't have an ounce of salt added. The veggies were just...old. I found a slice of baby corn in it that had somehow wilted like sour pickle. Argh. Finally, the topping of fried onions- I think they legit counted it out. I found around 4-5 tiny brown bits.

Please don't spend your money here. Let them step up their game. Let them actually make food that doesn't taste bland and sad. Give them the time to buck up.

Nothing out of the ordinary yet quite appetizing.
I am a person who grew up with wai wai and thanks to my Nepali and north eastern friends wai wai finds its various use in my everyday diet. 
Wai wai city specializes in customizing noodles for all noodle lovers. Their live kitchen is quite a visual treat for those who are eagerly waiting for their box to be made.
They do offer quite a good number of interesting options to choose from.

A few namely are the Kung pao wai wai, burnt garlic, classic wai wai and so on.
The burnt garlic was quite amazing with a good balance of flavors.

Amongst the appetizers The mimosa which is supposed to be a fusion of momo and samosa was quite something. The dips accompanying it made it even more flavorful. Fried zucchini was another vegetarian option which was pretty good.

The coolers especially the tamarind twist was quite refreshing, they have a handful of options to choose from.

Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5

Located opposite South City Mall in Prince Anwar Shah Road, this restaurant is Kolkata's first Noodle Bar featuring several signature Wai Wai dishes which is amazing just like the other!

Their Signature collection comprises of :

1) Hakka Wakka : Classic Noodles with Pepper Soya Sauce. It is made with onions, carrots, cabbage, beans, capsicum, potatoes, fried onions and crispy garlic.

2) Bang Bang : Chopsuey Noodles with Schezwan Chilli Sauce. It is made with mushrooms, onions, capsicum, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, green onions and crispy chilli.

3) Classic Funtastic : Roasted Noodles with Masala Fusion Sauce. It is made with peas, corn, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, beans, crispies and coriander.

4) Tokyo Express : Classic Noodles with Spicy Teriyaki Sauce. It is made with mushrooms, chinese cabbage, beans, spring onions, zucchini, pak choy, green onions and sesame seeds.

5) Burnt Garlic Chow : Pan Fried Noodles with Soy Garlic Sauce. It is made of chinese cabbage, babycorn, capsicum, carrots, onions, pak choy, sesame seeds and fried onions.

6) Kung Pao Delight : Pan Fried Noodles with Kung Pao Sauce. It is made of cauliflower, zucchini, onions, mushrooms, carrots, spring onions, chilli flakes and roasted peanuts.

7) China Chilli : Roasted Noodles with Hot Garlic Sauce. It is made of babycorn, carrots, onions, chinese cabbage, cauliflower, mixed chillies, fried onions and crispy garlic.

These authentic Wai Wai dishes come in small boxes which is really handy for office, tiffin and travelling purposes. Every noodle item can be customized based on :

1) Noodle type : Classic/ Roasted/Pan Fried/ Chopsuey
2) Sauce type : Soy Garlic/ Hot Garlic/ Masala Fusion / Pepper Soya/ Spicy Teriyaki / Kung Pao/ Schezwan Chilli
3) Type of Vegetables ( upto 6 )
4) Type of Toppings ( upto 3 )
5) Other Add ons like paneer, egg, chicken, shrimps.

These make your noodle extremely tasty as well as delicious just the way one wants it to be making Wai Wai City the first to bring such an unique concept in Kolkata.

There are Appetizers which are also present to enhance your dining experience.
1) Wai Wai Bhel
2) Zucchini Masala Fries
3) Chilli Cheese Wantons
4) Honey Chilli Potatoes
5) Spicy BBQ Crispy Chicken
6) Chicken Momosa

The Chicken Momosa is a superb dish that will surely satisfy a non vegetarian foodie while the Chilli Cheese Wantons will leave an impact on the vegetarian foodies on the other hand. Definitely one should try out their appetizers along with the noodles for a good experience at this joint.

Amongst the drinks and the desserts, one gets :
1) Spicy Mango
2) Tamarind Twist
3) Nimbu Masala Soda
4) Soft drinks
5) Honey Crispies and Icecream

Every drink has it's own taste and is just as good as the other is. The Honey Crispies and Icecream is basically Darsan with Vanilla Ice-cream which tastes amazing after a nice lunch over here!
One should definitely go for it.

The ambience is great and the staff is really co-operative and helpful which gives this place an added advantage over others. Though, the seating capacity is less with uncomfortable chairs, one can always opt for take-away or can sit in the high bench attached to the walls for a wonderful experience! The quantity of every item suffices one and the quality of every delicacy is top knotch. Though the pricing is a bit on the higher side, the items are worth every penny to be honest.

Recommended highly.

Taste Quotient : 4/5
Ambience : 4/5
Pocket Pinch : 3/5

It did not surpass my expectation neither did was it a big let down. About a month old when we were visiting the outlet, located opposite to the South City mall. The noodles base is Wai Wai, as the name suggests. They have limited seating spaces. They have an Appetizers section, a drinks section, a noodles section, and a Make Your Own Noodles section in their menu. We tried their China Chilli noodles which was spicy (as per my liking) but lacked taste, you could add meat/fish to it. The next up was Chicken Mamosa, quite liked it. Served with a spicy and sweet chilli sauce - can be tried. The spicy mango cooler is also a good drink that complimented the noodles.¬†

Easy on the pocket, a quick service restaurant. Collect your food on the go - can be tried!

Read the reviews and decided to try this place. This place which has replaced chock cafe, looks pretty good. While the ambience is nice, the prices are not. Paying 149+ taxes just for one packet of wai wai is a little too much. The concept is pretty nice. But the price is not at all justified. They give you only one packet of wai wai which doesn't even suffice one person. We ordered the make your noodles where in you can choose the type of noodle, the sauce, the veggies you want. The concept is very good , but the price is a little too much and the quantity is not at all justified for the price.

Finally a joint dedicated just for wai wai lovers. It has been opened recently. Located bang opposite to the South City mall, this joint has two sections. I really loved the interiors, which was neat. It has a self service counter. We were the only people there. Not much people are aware of this place.

We ordered for a burnt garlic wai wai noodle and chilli potato wedges. The burnt garlic noodles comes in a box which is easy to carry if we can't eat the amount served at a time. I loved the noodles which had lots of vegetables. A very healthy option. The chilli potato wedges were really spicy. Calling out to all the spice lovers, do try this one with a Coke. I loved it.
This place needs a lot of exploring, and I'm surely gonna come back to try their other variants.

Read the reviews and decided to give it a try but was disappointed. While the d√©cor and ambiance are nice , the prices are not. A humble wai-wai noodle along with few toppings (all veg) sets you back by 149 + taxes which in my opinion is pretty steep. Even the portion size is very small. 

No wonder this place wore a deserted look even during peak lunch hour despite being located opposite to south city mall (where food court is not functional currently). 

Taste was OK. In my opinion it should not be more than 100 bucks including taxes , for it to become popular n economical. Am not visiting again !!

A new concept. Delicious food. Wantons are a must try. Even the in house drinks are very nice. The dessert has an amazing taste. And its the best place for noodles and spice lovers. Very well priced. One can have a proper meal in just 150 rupees. Portions are good. The wai wai bhel has a tangy taste and is just apt as an appetiser. Ambience is very nice and positive. The staff is well trained and good. In short its a very nice place. One visit is truly not enough for this place.

New spot in the town... Wai wai city looks promising. It has outlets in other cities in india..But this one opposite south city mall is the first one in Kolkata. This place is next to Habib's where there was choco cafe earlier. 
Now it will take time to try all the variations that they have to offer but this place sure looks promising. We went there yesterday and ordered a wai wai bhel, burnt garlic chow and their signature cooler.

Wai wai bhel was perfect...Tangy, sweet, crunchy with veggies ....It will definitely tangle your taste buds. 

Burnt garlic chow had lots of veggies in it and coked with lots of garlic. It was gravy based topped with sesame seeds and fried onions. Must try! We got the nimbu soda kind of thing that was their signature cooler as a combo. 

This place needs to be explored more ... One visit is not enough.

Aesthetically decorated new noodle bar is where we dropped after we shopped. As the name suggests exotic dishes are carved out of the famous brand of noodles(originally from Nepal). Ordered Burnt Garlic noodles with extra sliced chicken and Green onion dressing,Honey Chilli Potato wedges. Washed it down with  Tamarind Twist and Spicy mango soda. Pocket pinch is moderately high, although it adds value to every penny you spend. Interiors have a modern look, the noodle bar is symmetrically placed. Service is predominantly self which takes away the wholesome experience of a dine in place. Overall a nice experience.
