It is an amzing place to try Bati Chokha! A varanasi themed food joint with a khatiya outside. Located near FD park. We ordered the Bati chokha combo and it was very filling. A must visit!

Being a hardcore nonvegetarian, i consciously avoided this place just with the prejudice of vegetarian food. But that was a huge mistake. The place is relatively smaller compared to the usual good restaurants. The decor is authentic and relevant to the ambience and food. And the food! The food is melt-in-your-mouth, mouth-wateringly delicious. We ordered the special batichokha thali, hariyali paratha, benarasi aloo dum and lassi. The panner litti was amazing, the chokha was of a refreshing flavour and the raita gave the perfect cooling effect. The lassi was rich and smooth. The kheer that came with the thali was yummy, and the churma was such a pleasant discovery. All in all, an excellent discovery and i would wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to all vegetarians and especially nonvegetarians for authentic food.

Its located just a few minutes away from city centre 1 . The Lane is not so busy and traffic is lesser.  Be ready for a wait if you are visiting on a holiday.  
They serve a host of Indian food but there forte is authentic Bihar food.  As the name suggests Baati or Litti Chokha is there specialty.  
The decor is very basic village type, but does the job of creating the atmosphere. 
We ordered Paneer tikka for starters, it had 6 pcs serving (unlike 4 at max places).  The taste was also pretty good.  For the Main course we ordered masala khichadi (heard about it from many people) and @Special Baati chokha.  
Khichadi was just average as per my liking. 
Baati chokha was good and authentic, well cooked and very authentic Bihari taste.  
The prices are also very reasonable, 4 people can have dinner within 1k.  
All in all a must try,  something different and authentic

A different ambience and theme restaurant based on Rajasthan and Rajasthani food.
You will get the feel of being in Rajasthan or say village.
Yum food with best taste.

A village-themed restaurant. The ambience is great. Food is also very tasty. The flavors are typical and unique. Yes, a bit spicy but that's what makes mouth water, after all. The decoration is well-made. The staff is also good. The doorman will greet you very cordially. The location is good, too. One drawback is that all the tables are quite large and meant for 4+ persons. So it kind of feels odd. The tables are a bit high, too, so eating posture will be quite awkward.

As the name suggests ' bati chokha' specialises in north indian and rajasthani food. The baati's are filled with delicious filling and when drenched in ghee are heavenly. the dishes that are actually appreciated are papad paneer, cutlets, a variety of stuffed parathas and dal bati.
For the people with a sweet tooth, the choorma and kheer are out of the world.

An awesome place to go if you want to enjoy the signature dish of Bihar. The bati chokha along with chutney is delicious. Paneer baati was not that good.
They give a bowl of ghee so that you soak the baati totally in the ghee. It was yummy and the price is reasonable.

The two items were served with tomato chutney , green chutney , both of which were really good , ghee and pickled chillies. Possibly the only place in Kolkata that serves litti chokha. A must try.

Went there during 1st week of September. They have tried at lot to give rajasthani feel . They have an outlet in benaras as well after which they started this. Their attempt is visible thanks to the decor which has a very traditional feel as shown in the images below. Loads of handicrafts and clay work has been used to decorate the place. 
We opted for the "Special Baati Chokha". To be honest it was a very average experience as my hopes of reliving my experience of "Chokhi Dhani" of Rajasthan was shattered. The baati's were were oily. Dal was average. The churma however was the saving grace of the rather sad evening.

Can give it a shot to experiment with different food  apart from north indian and chinese but not going there again for sure.

I had bookmarked this restaurant couple of months back as it promised an authentic taste of Baati Chokha. Finally, I happen to visit this place yesterday evening. 

The board outside is visible so finding the place is not a problem. The interior is way too good. The ambience is such that you will feel that you have come down to a village. 

Since this place is known for its Baati Chokha, my friend and I ordered the ₹220 combo in which we got 2 Sattu Baati, one big bowl of Chokha, one small bowl of dal & rice each, pickle, and chutney. We had also ordered ₹160 Khichdi combo which was served with small bowl of curd, chokha, papad & pickle. 

The food was served on a plate made of leaves also called as Pattal/Paatli in village. It was kept over a wooden plate. It certainly gives you the desi touch similar to the one you get in villages.

First talking about the Sattu Baati, the filling was pretty good and the Baati was cooked well. The chokha was prepared in the mustard oil and had that strong taste of the oil. The flavour was amazing. Dal served with Baati Chokha combo was okayish. Khichdi on the other hand was pretty decent and tasted much better with curd. Since one baati each wasn’t sufficient for us so we ordered two more sattu baati. 

The overall experience was great. The service could have been faster. We didn’t get a chance to try other items but if you are planning to get an authentic taste of Baati Chokha then this place would certainly not disappoint you at all.

Food is avarage by teast and below average by it's quantity.
The combo/thali is not at all value for money.
The salt portion in Khichuri was high. Bati was quite dry. Ghee portion and small almost absent.

Altogether a below average restaurant

DISAPPOINTED! I had been waiting to go to this place. I had thought, finally, I will have some daal baati. I was left utterly disappointed the way things were. After waiting for an hour in the queue, we got in the restaurant. The interior was very nice with all the rural set-up and songs from the golden era. "Wow, this is amazing", I thought. Then we get to the menu. We ordered this snack: 'Ulta-Pulta', quite a creative name; but it is besan ka chilla with veggies. Nothing fancy like the name and the quantity was so little that it seemed like we had nothing as a snack for the starter. "Chaalu hote hi khatm hi gaya, yaar!"For mains, I had taken Baati Chokha combo; specifically asked for plain baati and in return got sattu ki baati. When I said to get the plain baati that I ordered, they said it's over, without even checking and asking me whether I even want to have sattu baati. The taste was just okay, not outlandish about it.  apparently, the dal listed on the menu and dal served with thaali are different, interesting! That cannot even be brought individually, so how does the restaurant expect to have only daal and baati that normal Rajasthani or MP/CG guy would have and that too without kachumbar salad? If things need to be so called 'authentic', do it in right way, not just by fooling people in the east. I can tell a lot about taste as I belong to Indore and have lived in western India for most of my life.
Quantity was a huge letdown.Then came moong ka halwa, which was still decent, a little low on sweet side that a diabetic would love. Only good thing I loved about food was green chutney, that's all!Had a good time because my company was good else value for money I would go with 2 out of 5.Ambiance: 4 out 5.Service: 2 out of 5. (Waiters and managers seemed frustrated, lethargic and lost for most of the time).
*Gravely disappointed*

This place will give a full Rajasthani feeling.
The decor is of a village type area with typical foods.
Baati chokha - amazing mixture of rajasthani & UP/bihari food.

Chokha - aloo chokha if we keep it very simple.
People who has the taste for it, they would surely love it. For others, it would be great experience for them.

Staff courtesy is great and so is their Rajasthani ambiance. I personally am in love with their Special Baati Combo, though I do not like their paneer baati. Just go for normal sattu baati.
Many people have recommended their paneer papad pakoda but I found it quite ordinary.
Their churma is also not the authentic Rajasthani churma, which actually is made by mashing baati with ghee and sugar. Their churma seem more like a ghee halwa (and not churma).
I would only recommend their Dal, Baati (sattu) and kheer.

There is no reason for me to not rate this place a 5. It delivers in every parameter of a good restaurant. And its very pocket friendly. For being at a prime location in salt lake, thr price is quite reasonable.

Ambiance - Decorated on the theme of a village, the interior is creative and gives you a cozy feeling. They have small hut like seating areas as well as few table chairs if you prefer them.

Parking - Road side parking available. No charges.

Food - Thats the best part about this place. Authentic taste of Dal baati and Chokha in Kolkata is a refersher. We ordered these:

1. Paneer Papad Pakoda - It's a unique prepration. Must try if you are going. Crispy on the outside n soft panner inside.
2. Paneer and Sattu Baati - They give plain batis as well as those will filling. We opted for these.
3. Dal and Chokha - Daal was decent and aaloo baingan chokha was superb
4. Gulabjaman - Decent in taste

A complete recommend from my end to all veg food lovers. I am going to be a regular at this place.

We went last week there. Decoration was simple n matched the regional theme​. They served the not on the glass plate, they served on wooden thali covered with leaf. Service quite good. We ordered stuffed aloo, aloo paratha, masala kulcha, mix veg, Paneer Tikka butter masala n bati chokha. All the items were good.

There is no reason for me to not rate this place a 5. It delivers in every parameter of a good restaurant. And its very pocket friendly. For being at a prime location in salt lake, thr price is quite reasonable.

Ambiance - Decorated on the theme of a village, the interior is creative and gives you a cozy feeling. They have small hut like seating areas as well as few table chairs if you prefer them.

Parking - Road side parking available. No charges.

Food - Thats the best part about this place. Authentic taste of Dal baati and Chokha in Kolkata is a refersher. We ordered these:

1. Paneer Papad Pakoda - It's a unique prepration. Must try if you are going. Crispy on the outside n soft panner inside.
2. Paneer and Sattu Baati - They give plain batis as well as those will filling. We opted for these.
3. Dal and Chokha - Daal was decent and aaloo baingan chokha was superb
4. Gulabjaman - Decent in taste

A complete recommend from my end to all veg food lovers. I am going to be a regular at this place.

This place is a hidden gem. The Rajasthani Ambience is soothing with superb music in the background. The Food is divine and the Staff behave professionally. Paneer Papad Pakora was just awesome.❤️ 
Strongly recommended. :)

My first venture in a all veg restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised with the food. First time tried Baati Chokha and it was pretty good. While the sattu baati was unique test the choka was delicious. Also loved the Aloo Paratha and the kheer.

Had to wait for more than 45 minutes for my order on my table.

Batti chokha is similar to dhani chowki in jaipur rajasthan. It brings to you that kinda flavour. Food is really good and so is the hospitality. I must visit for all.

A colleague recommended this place for when I crave vegetarian food. The cuisine is Rajasthani as it is clearly named after their staple food baati chokha. The day I went, I was in full mood to explore this new flavour but I was in for series of surprises not to my liking.
Firstly, decor is very good resembling a Rajasthani village with matching seating arrangements. We went and saw the menu and without flinching ordered their special thali of 348 bucks. 
After 20 mins or so, the thalis came and we were hugely disappointed. Except for their USP 4 baati n 1 bowl chokha, other items included plain sticky rice, normal moong dal, chilli Achar, dessert -- payesh Kesar flavoured. The baati as its nature goes is very dry and we had to literally bathe it in ghee to make it edible without ounces of water. The chokha is nothing but roasted brinjal mashed with potatoes and onions (begun pora with aloo chokha) which tasted good but was too little in quantity. For one person two baati is enough, four was too much for us. 
We felt that the price was way too much for such simple food and the baati didn't cater to our taste buds. It was too dry and there were no spotting difference between the sattu baati and the paneer baati.
For vegetarians, I cannot speak, this might be very good for them, but this is my personal take on it even though I was ready to enjoy every bit of it.

Hi All.. Had been to Baati Chokha this weekend. It's located in Salt Lake, Sector 3, near the Chinese Consulate General. 
Must say it's Vegan and it's good. Had been there with family, we ordered Special Baati Chokha and Puri  sabzi. The Baati Chokha comes as a combo and comes with Baati (paneer and satu) the later is good as always, brinjal (eggplant) Chokha, dhania and tomato chutney. Now the best part is once you mash the baati you have Desi ghee to pour on it which makes all the more awesome. The combo had desserts kheer and churma (churma with ghee roasted dry fruits), bakheer (gur kheer). The best part is they serve in clay pots and lotus leafs. Thatz really lovely. Secondly the ambience reminds of rural india. Please if you are visiting it over lunch just have a Mattha (buttermilk) it's just so refreshing. My family just loved it..

Brought back all the fond memories of my village with the interiors so nostalgic and the food so subtle. 

A must visit place for all the person out there who would like to relish a different taste which roots directly to villages of india. The interior are indeed admirable and the staff is very courteous. Located near salt lake stadium the place is easily tracable and worth visit multiple times till you get bored which is not gonna happen.

Surprise your loved one and your elders with food and decor here.

A treat for all vegan out there. I would tag the place as Must visit!!!

I visited this place in February but thought about writing review today. 
Ambience: It looks like Rajasthan village dhaba with khatiya at the entrance and internal decorated with hanging lanterns. Perfect place for photo frenzy people.
Food: Loved the sattu and paneer baati, served with chokha and lots of other chutneys to make it delicious. They even provided a bowl of ghee and green chillies in case you are interested. Chaas was the perfect way to end. Two baatis are enough for normal people, so order cautiously as the food is very heavy.
Service: Ok. Can't say much as we were the only people at that time, so it was obviously fast.
Overall, it should be a must visit place in your list. Looking forward to visit again.

Interior was good, but the attitude of the staff over there is hell pathetic.
They just want to make money.
First of all, i went with my family, we were 8 of us, and we reached there at 10:25 pm, i asked them whether the outlet is opened or not, if u r close we can go to some other place, but for making money they said they are open.

We went inside, menu was a kind of new and looks good with the items on it. We ordered all food items and also there speciality in BAATI.
 i am a marwadi, i know how baati is prepared and we all know. Whether they say its a benaras cuisine they serve.
When we said it was not cooked. It was raw atta inside, the server didnt checked it and said we make like this, and we are right. He was continuously arguing with us that we were uneducated and we do not know anything for food.

Rest all food items was good, especially there roasted tomato chutney and palak kofta.

Will not visit this place again, and not recommend it to any of my frnds and family.
Not a good service at all and not at all good food for the speciality they serve in baati.

It is not everyday that you visit a restaurant and want to give it full marks. This small restaurant at one end of Kolkata deserves the accolades because it's worthy. The restaurant is themed as a village and the signboard does nothing to entice you to come in. Infact it looks exactly like a small restaurant in a mid tier town and therein lays its charm. 

The Interiors are well done for the tight space it occupies but in some places it does look a bit overdone. However nothing looks out of place and they get full marks for that. They are big family compartments with huge tables for what can only be described as there intended audience. There are a few tables for couples and smaller groups of upto 4. But they look more like an afterthought or a result of the feedback they would've recieved. However the compartments are really well done with wall art and lanterns and big wooden tables. The lanterns look gorgeous but are annoying for bigger groups who would have to place chairs on the outer end of the table and there's a high probability of banging your head against the lantern while getting up. However it's a minor annoyance and one easily avoided in most cases.

The staff is pretty knowledgeable and once (and if) they get a grasp of what you like, their recommendations are spot on. 

The food was divine. The owner and the theme of the restaurant are both from Benares ( Varanasi ) and so is the menu selection. However the best part is that the north Indian selection also has a distinct taste of the region making it as authentic an experience as you would get. If you're find of Bengali/Bihari/Up cuisine, chances are that you'll lap it all up to the last morsel. Spotless plates would be the go-to term, however the plates are woven from leaves and not the usual ones you get in most restaurants. Responsible tourism definitely gets brownie points.

We ordered a wide assortment of dishes and practically the best of the menu given the big group we went in. 

Baati with Chokha
Baati is a flour based ball baked with a filling of your choice, usually a mix of lentils (called sattu) or paneer. It is served with chokha which is basically mashed potatoes lightly stir fried in mustard oil. This amazing combination is indegenous to Bihar and parts of UP and is a must try for this place. It does take a bit of time to make so order it right from the start and you'll get it as an accompaniment for your main course.

Benarasi Alu dum & Benarasi Mix Veg
Both have a distinct taste of spices different from the one found in your usual North Indian fare. The Alu Dum is basically a potato dish served in yellowish brown gravy while the mix veg is a dry dish (no gravy) with an assortment of vegetables. Both the dishes are highly recommended especially the Alu Dum for all potato lovers.

Kofta
This could pass for a kofta at a regular restaurant but was very delicious. Recommended.

Sattu Paratha
This is a stuffed Paratha (Thick Indian Bread) with a filling of crushed mix lentils called sattu and spices. For someone who's not had it before, it can be a little on the spicier side but is amazing nevertheless. Highly recommended

Khichdi 
Normally eliciting an image of a  concotion of smooth dirty yellow dish of rice and lentils (dal) topped with ghee ( clarified butter ) in most homes, this is one with a twist. In this the spices, and vegetables are added in at the time of making it, giving it a unique flavour. Mumbai people might know it as dal khichdi and Bengalis as Masala Khichdi. Be as it may, it's an interesting dish as an alternative to the normal rice dishes most of us order at the end.

The butter milk and Aam Panna as drinks are also recommended with the latter available as a seasonal option. 

The restaurant however is new and is going through its teething problems with less staff and slow service but is easily forgivable in lieu of what it provides, great food in a gorgeous themed ambiance. A very big thumbs-up and we can see ourselves combing back for more, the next time we're back in town.

Sadly enough, we missed out on clicking the pics of the food as we were too hungry to wait :)

Really loved the food from this restaurant. Didn't visit it, ordered via zomato delivery, though they took more than 1 hour to deliver still the food they served were truly good. Ordered paneer papad pakora, veg pakora, paneer paratha, aloo paratha and veg kofta, banarasi aloo dum, all of them were great, specially the veg kofta was delightful. Amount was sufficient, pricing was pocket friendly, its much cheaper than some other veg only restaurants but taste wise  better than them. Overall satisfied with the experience..

The taste and the extent of food served are both around average. Although it doesn't promise to be a multi cuisine outlet, it doesn't really do complete justice to what it says. The retro feel and traditional menu does entice you a lot, but the taste leaves you wondering. The main course is great in taste, but all the sweetness of the world is in the churma. To such an extent that even the staff couldn't be sweet. Good for a one off meal but not really a go-to place, considering the premium at which the services are offered.

An excellent place, if you want to break the cliche and try something different. 
However  I would suggest that donot try if you have continental type taste buds that don't relish Indian food much. 
In the starters, the paneer papad pakoras were crispy and a must try. If you are two people then try having a single combo like the special baati choka. It comes with 2 baatis, chokha, dal-rice & dessert. All 3 baatis are yummy and baked to perfection. Don't count your calories & add ghee on them for that perfect mouth melting feel. The chokha was also tasty and well made. All their chutneys are absolutely lip smacking. The dish comes with a dessert option of kheer/churma. We ordered churma, which just melted in our mouths. 
The parathas/rice dals & sabjis are average. Just like other North Indian outlets.  
Didn't try their lassis though I would definitely go there again to have baatis..

Baati Chokha is a hidden gem.Beautiful interiors ,traditional music and good food.We had tea,pakora and obviously their special baati chokha for which we went.Bati Chokha was good.Stuffing inside the baati need to be improved.everything was too good from cutneys to mirchis and from service to billing.Overall it is a must go place whether with friends or family.Prices are reasonable.

A tiny place, with a small but balanced menu & what they’ve created is exactly a typical Rajasthani (bikaneri) type ambience. From the entrance gate to the whole eating area is gorgeously decorated, even the waiting area gives you a feel of dhaba. Add delightful, warm attentive service from the owners/staff. Apart from ambience & great service they give, the food department is definitely not matching the level. I didn't found the baati or daal any good at all. But the Rajasthani decoration is so good that it will compel you to visit this place atleast once.

If you are from m.p / u.p and missing ghar jaisi daal roti in kolkata, then this place is a must visit for you, a very nice themed based restaurant, very good pure vegetarian dishes will remind you of your childhood days specially some dishes like Nimona, kheer, gajar ka halwa (pure banarsi taste) butter milk with roasted zeera masala , fried green chilli marinated in amchur powder with tamatar lehsun  chatni will definately make your experience memorable sattu baati and paneer bati at its best 👍👍☺

The fact that they serve a variety of litti right in my neighborhood is what makes this place really special.  I am a huge fan of bihari cuisine who take the whole home made and rustic feel to another level.  The decor transports you to another part of the country and the staff are super courteous.  My special little along with the paneer paratha was really yum.  Their garlic coriander chutney is superb. The chokha is slightly bland compared to the very strong taste of mustard oil you get from the litti filling but when tasted together there is complete harmony.  Cannot wait to come back to the city and visit this place again.

If you're kind of  "mera gaon mera desh" type, this place is just for you. Once you step in, magically, you'll be transported in a corner of UP/ Bihar. Let's come down to details. Littis are having a good variety and huge in size. But, they're slightly on the tough side. Out of them, the paneer litti is definitely recommended, and even better, they have an assorted litti platter, which one should order for. The cholha was slightly under-spicy for my taste-bud. Gud ki kheer was good. 

Overall, good for the rustic setting. And the service is fantastic.

I had been to this place for lunch on one of the Sundays.
Its a themed restaurant situated in FD Block - Salt Lake City.
Feels like being seated in kinda cottage and being served on leaves, an entirely different experience.
Offered quite decent quality food and the staff behavior seemed to be courteous enough. 
The sweet dish, Kheer felt to be a minus for the surprisingly low quantity offered. Whateva, I loved the Sattu Baati and Chokha. You may also give a try to Paneer Baati.
Would say 2 Baatis is good enough for an adult. Max to 3, not beyond that ;)
The ambience felt to be good with loads of painting around and some art pieces trying to give a villages' theme. In background, you will notice some old tracks as of being played on an old Transistor.

Overall, quality food and good ambience for the subjected price tag !!

The interior decor looks nice, based on rajasthani theme. Food is served on  wooden plates with leaf plates on top, the taste is just too good specially that of the baati , water and lassi etc are served in a clay pot. You are only served vegetarian items here. The The quantity and quality both are good enough to fill your tummy. The prices are on a little bit higher side.

The ambience and décor completely nails it. If u want to go to a nice traditional place for dinner with tasty food this is the place. From the entrance to the inner seating it gives u the feel of a typical village and u completely enter a different world. The food was delicious albeit Zomato mentions Rajasthani food is available here but they don't serve typical Rajasthani food. The staff himself told us they serve U.P cuisine. That was the low of my visit but otherwise whatever we ordered was yum. Being reasonable adds to its charm😁!

The look of this restaurant from outside is good. Feels like as if you are entering a grand palace or something. The interior decor looks nice as well. Well, you are only served vegetarian items here. The prices are on the higher side. We had ordered the Special Baati Chokha combo. The dishes failed to satisfy my taste buds. And the khichudi tastes like simple home-made khichudi. Though this restaurant has an overall rating of above 4, I coulnt help but give a poor rating. Just not my type.

Before going into details let me tell you all that this is my first restaurant which I rated 5.
I couldn't find any error in any of the things everything was inviting let it be ambience,food,staff or price.
We ordered Ulta Pulta and papad paneer pakoda which was great in taste. The best part of starter was the chutney served with it,they were unique and very great in taste which complimented the dish.
Then maincourse we ordered Dal Handi,Veg kofta,kadai panner and rice every dish was above perfect I must say. The best part is they keep a bowl of ghee as well😜
Deserts has a very interesting story with me. We were group of 5 and there were 4 desert so we ordered all 4 and I was left out with desert thought to taste all and order one from that. but when I tasted deserts I was in big trouble and was not able to decide which to order again..so I thought it would be unfair to pick one and I shared the deserts from all my friends.
Overall this is bestest of all restaurant I have visited till now in Kolkata.

The desi khana, the make over, the songs playing in the restaurant, everything just goes in the same rhythm. 
If you are low on money, and would like to eat some shudh desi khana (veg) this is the right place for you.
I have been here twice, both of the times I had a nice experience here. The staffs are very helpful and greet you well. The food is too good. We had khichdi, aloo parathas, bhindi masala, kadhai paneer, palak paneer (including both of my visits). The quantity and quality both are good enough to fill your tummy. 
We had also ordered churma, a sweet dessert, which was also too good. It just melted in my mouth. The smell of ghee, the taste of food, makes me visit this place again and again.

This is one of the worst experiences I have had in a restaurant. We were 11 people at the Salt Lake Kolkata branch this evening and almost all of us had to leave the restaurant empty stomach. Only 2 waiters serving all the tables, no staff in the kitchen, the waiters forget the order, utter confusion, after 15 mins of placing the order we are told that the dish is no longer available or possible. I do not recommend this restaurant at all. After all this the food isn't good either. "Baati" is not cooked well, "churma" is too sweet, "chokha" is ok and the starters are terrible

"Paani in Kulhad", food in "Mitti Ki Thaali" and in "Nariyal Paata" makes food taste even better. And because its a restaurant so food is the main part and this main part has "great taste" .

I had baati chokah, Khichri, Kheer nad loved them all. Must try guys ...

Have been to this place before but this time the experience was awful. The baatis were burnt and their was a bunch of burnt hair in the baati which the staff refused to accept was their fault. The behaviour of the staff at the counter was extremely rude. He kept arguing that it is not their fault and the baatis were returned to him to which no replacement or refund was provided. We even tried to contact the resturaunt at the numbers mentioned in the bill, but there was no response. Worst experience and extremely unhygienic food. Will convey the incidence to friends and relatives so that they dont face the same harrasment.

5/5 for this wonderfully themed restaurant! Not quiet spread in word around the town, also because of its location in north Kolkata, its an underdog now! They have worked really really well to get us look and feel of sitting in a village hut and eating. Décor is just amazing. And its a pure veg restaurant, so for those family dining (who don't like to eat in a place wr non veg Is also served) its perfect. Menu is limited but good authentic food. Servers are so humble. Menu is printed on that thatched plate. Cutlery is wooden plates wd leaf plates on top, n water and lassi etc is served in a clay pot. There are compartments for sitting too.

It was a matter of pure accident that we visited Baati Chokha. Even for the first visit , we were so humbled and amazed by the courtesy of staffs present there. Food was really delicious and tasteful. As a gourmet I had been at many places where you can see a clear level of oil in any gravy item you order. Here it was different. 
Ambience: Themed around rajasthani village they have maintained a good level of comfort with nice old hindi songs at a low voice which adds flavor to the place. They serve food in leaf made plates kept over steel plates and water in kulhads.
Service is really nice and their behavior towards their customers makes your experience pleasant. 
Price is a bit towards the costlier side but amount is good enough so it compensates the earlier part.
Surely this has become my favourite veg restaurant in Kolkata.

The wait to get a seat was comfortable. The staff were courteous. Baati chokha markets itself as a Banarasi cuisine restaurant but the ambience was that of a Rajasthani restaurant. We ordered sattu and paneer baati with daal and chokha. That tasted good. The kheer and bakheer were good too. But what let down is their Indian food which had no Benarasi or Rajasthani connect whatsoever. Mixed veg tasted like a paneer dish, dahi bhindi was made of extremely ripe bhindi which had gone bad. The khichdi was good. Baati Chokha goes wrong only where it tries to offer mainstream items which don't go with the feel of the place. My suggestion would be go for a pure Rajasthani positioning and add items like gatte ki sabzi, sangar ka saag and excel in it instead of trying to be the Jack of all trades.

Yesterday was my third visit to this place.. i took my parents first time to this restaurant with lots of hope of good food, due to my past good experience. However, this time experience was really bad, restaurant was full, but there was no staff to manage it, only three staff were handling all tables therefore poor service, late food delivery almost after 40 minutes. We had to call waiter atleast thrice for ordering food every time. The environment was also very disturbed with no privacy to enjoy dinner. In terms of food, prices have been suddenly increased. In terms of taste food was good but little spicy. Kheer which used to be very tasty was not at all good as it was seved nither hot or cold but at room temperature, spoiling its taste completely. I am highly disappointed with restaurant service.

The most important thing is that the place is really clean with good ambience and a wonderful village setup. It's a must go. Too bad they have the minimum delivery price of Rs. 500 otherwise I would be eating nothing but this for days.

What an imagination, the leaf plates are pretty cool and you will enjoy eating on it.

We ordered Paneer Baati, and those Sattu filled Baati along with Lentil and aaloo chokha and kadhai paneer.
Food had magical aroma and mesmerizing taste.
We also ordered mattha, and The food tasted soothing with mattha.

Paneer Baati was very tasty and had the right spices. On the top of that was the GHEE which was offered by the staff so generously and sweetly that it gave me a glimpse of the home Baati and forced ghee !!
But the thing which made my day was the spicy tomato chutney!
Being a non-spice lover I generally stay away from spicy dish but trust me, the tomato chutney was so so so so awesome that it was worth of those tears which I shed out of spice!! 
I wish I can bring home a big bowl of the tomato chutney :p

The moment you enter into this restaurant, you enter into a very beautiful cozy village. 

This pure veg restaurant offers some offbeat foods in a different way.

What I like about this restaurant-

- village theme

- serving food in that manner

- different types of baati with fresh ghee
 and chokha
- the desserts like churma, gajar ka halwa
- staff behavior
 
I have been to this place many times and this place has never let me down. :)

Known as the heart of Rajasthani cuisine, Daal Baati is one of the most popular dish originated from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. 
The daal is a combo of all types of known lentils like Urad, Moth, Moong, Chana and Tuvaar daal cooked on vegetable oil with seasoning of jeera, mustard and fennel seeds. 
Baati, the size of tennis ball, is a hard wheat bread is cooked in a traditional oven until it turns Brown. 
I could describe all the above information because I witness the preparation in my kitchen itself and trust me the end result is worth every step of the preparation. 
Luckily, those taste buds who haven't experienced the taste of daal baati, this place has tried its best to serve you the dish in its best form. 
Located in the heart of salt lake,beside the Chinese embassy, the place can be easily accessed. The theme is a small village hut with a separate seating arranged with clay-brick themed wall. The  rajasthani culture is nicely potrayed over the walls with bamboo shelters above each seating space. The eatery is spacious with an approximate capacity of 40. 
Our group of 5 decided to try a Rajasthani cuisine. Half heartedly I agreed with them because its a common dish at any Marwari household.
The management has tried to bring in almost all types of Rajasthani dishes like Sangri, Churma, kheer but our eyes were struck to the first item in the dish, " The thali". 
First we ordered a Paneer starter named "Paneer Papad Pakoda ".
The starter was pretty good with a thick layer of fried coating over a large chunk of Paneer. Very crispy and goes with the name. 
Henceforth, we decided to order Baati and daal; 6 pieces of normal baati and 4 pieces of Paneer baati. 
A bowl full of tennis sized Brown hard bowls arrived. Along with them came a couple of hot daal, spicy tomato and onion chutney, pudina chutney and the best part, a small bowl of hot ghee.
I forgot to mention that Ghee is an important ingredient of north-west Indian diet. The function of ghee is that not only it makes a dish rich and healthy ( if used in trace amounts), in case of Baati, khichdi, etc, it brings a different taste and aura( some people do not like it). 
We were elated to find so many complementary servings with the main dish. The Paneer baati was not as hot or tasty as the normal baati (made of sattu/ chana flour). 
The dish were served on thalis and bowls made of clay.
The staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful in selecting the dishes for us. 
I would strongly recommended to pay a visit at this place and you will definitely like it.

I was happy when I heard the restaurant has been shifted to salt lake which is near from my place. The food is awesome. Reminds me of my place. Service is good. Not too costly. I liked ulta pulta in starters very much. Khichdi is great in taste. Special baati chokha combo is a great deal for one person at reasonable price. Again visit is for sure. It is near to cc1 so can be reached easily.

Bati Chokha - The name has everything you need to know. Joint famous for its Bati w Chokha offerings. 

We visited there on Sunday around 3:30 p.m. for a nice brunch of bati. Restuarent has an apt set up depicting that of a Kuchha house, typical village environment - you can view a lot of pics on Zomato. 

Coming to the most important part - Food 🍲!!! 

We started with the paneer papad pakoda - awesome preparation. Two layers of paneer strips - thickness similar to a Dairy Milk bar!!! Deep fried with right amount of juice within the paneer strips, thus giving a nice taste to it. The pakodas were accompanied with 4-types of chatni. 
For the main course we went for the Paneer and Sattu bati (the usual one) and chokha and  dal. All of them were freshly prepared, the outer shell - thick and at the same time breakable with little pressure applied at the middle. The size of each bati was comparable to billiards ball. And to go with it, liquid ghee lukewarm temp was served. All in all we had a good brunch - a rad expensive but what can we say, things are getting costly day by day. 

Staff was around courteous and ready to serve at an call. We were really pleased with their service.

Known as the heart of Rajasthani cuisine, Daal Baati is one of the most popular dish originated from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. 
The daal is a combo of all types of known lentils like Urad, Moth, Moong, Chana and Tuvaar daal cooked on vegetable oil with seasoning of jeera, mustard and fennel seeds. 
Baati, the size of tennis ball, is a hard wheat bread is cooked in a traditional oven until it turns Brown. 
I could describe all the above information because I witness the preparation in my kitchen itself and trust me the end result is worth every step of the preparation. 
Luckily, those taste buds who haven't experienced the taste of daal baati, this place has tried its best to serve you the dish in its best form. 
Located in the heart of salt lake,beside the Chinese embassy, the place can be easily accessed. The theme is a small village hut with a separate seating arranged with clay-brick themed wall. The  rajasthani culture is nicely potrayed over the walls with bamboo shelters above each seating space. The eatery is spacious with an approximate capacity of 40. 
Our group of 5 decided to try a Rajasthani cuisine. Half heartedly I agreed with them because its a common dish at any Marwari household.
The management has tried to bring in almost all types of Rajasthani dishes like Sangri, Churma, kheer but our eyes were struck to the first item in the dish, " The thali". 
First we ordered a Paneer starter named "Paneer Papad Pakoda ".
The starter was pretty good with a thick layer of fried coating over a large chunk of Paneer. Very crispy and goes with the name. 
Henceforth, we decided to order Baati and daal; 6 pieces of normal baati and 4 pieces of Paneer baati. 
A bowl full of tennis sized Brown hard bowls arrived. Along with them came a couple of hot daal, spicy tomato and onion chutney, pudina chutney and the best part, a small bowl of hot ghee.
I forgot to mention that Ghee is an important ingredient of north-west Indian diet. The function of ghee is that not only it makes a dish rich and healthy ( if used in trace amounts), in case of Baati, khichdi, etc, it brings a different taste and aura( some people do not like it). 
We were elated to find so many complementary servings with the main dish. The Paneer baati was not as hot or tasty as the normal baati (made of sattu/ chana flour). 
The dish were served on thalis and bowls made of clay.
The staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful in selecting the dishes for us. 
I would strongly recommended to pay a visit at this place and you will definitely like it.

I was happy when I heard the restaurant has been shifted to salt lake which is near from my place. The food is awesome. Reminds me of my place. Service is good. Not too costly. I liked ulta pulta in starters very much. Khichdi is great in taste. Special baati chokha combo is a great deal for one person at reasonable price. Again visit is for sure. It is near to cc1 so can be reached easily.

Bati Chokha - The name has everything you need to know. Joint famous for its Bati w Chokha offerings. 

We visited there on Sunday around 3:30 p.m. for a nice brunch of bati. Restuarent has an apt set up depicting that of a Kuchha house, typical village environment - you can view a lot of pics on Zomato. 

Coming to the most important part - Food 🍲!!! 

We started with the paneer papad pakoda - awesome preparation. Two layers of paneer strips - thickness similar to a Dairy Milk bar!!! Deep fried with right amount of juice within the paneer strips, thus giving a nice taste to it. The pakodas were accompanied with 4-types of chatni. 
For the main course we went for the Paneer and Sattu bati (the usual one) and chokha and  dal. All of them were freshly prepared, the outer shell - thick and at the same time breakable with little pressure applied at the middle. The size of each bati was comparable to billiards ball. And to go with it, liquid ghee lukewarm temp was served. All in all we had a good brunch - a rad expensive but what can we say, things are getting costly day by day. 

Staff was around courteous and ready to serve at an call. We were really pleased with their service.

I went to Baati Chokha after I saw their board while I was in Sector 3. I was thinking of eating in a Rajasthani restaurant for a long time and coincidentally I saw this. After entering the restaurant I was greeted by the rustic decor with well laid out seats and leaf shaped menu card. Since I went during office hours I didn't want to take very heavy meal and opted for 1 Paneer Parantha. The waiter asked me if 1 would be enough for me, although I love eating, that day somewhat I get 1 should be good enough. After waiting for sometime the parantha arrived and my god the size and thickness of one single parantha blew me away. The parantha was thick, full of paneer and accompanied with different chutneys. As I kept finishing the pieces the stomach became more and more full. At the end I thanked my stars of not ordering one more parantha or else it would have been too much for me. Taste was awesome and best part is it was very pocket friendly. I would like to come some other day to try out their other dishes. Lastly the servicing guys were very cordial and well mannered. I would like to give .5 marks more for that.

This place was in my list for a long time. Finally visited the place today. 
This place stands to your expectations being a 4.1 in Zomato. 
A very traditional decor from walls paintings, sitting arrangement to thaalis. 
Waiters were polite. My waiter actively gave me suggestions on what to try. He even suggested that the portions i ordered will be too much for us to eat. And that was exactly the case, the portions we ordered after tooking his suggestion was apt for us. 
Kurkure bhindi and baati chokha thalli is a must try. Loved the chutnies and chokha had its authentic taste. The food was like i expected, traditional benarasi food.

A very beautiful experience all together. Justice done to the dishes, service too good, ambiance lovely, reasonable price.

Ordered food:
Sattu bati - tasty. Very heavy. One is more than enough.
Dal - very simple taste. Added ghee lifts up the flavour.
Normal chokha - again tasty yet simple
Sattu paratha - never had such delicious sattu paratha with ghee. It was very heavy. A quarter of it was more than enough after 1 bati.
Bakheer - gur se bana kheer. Just with the perfect sweetness and taste.
Churma - A must try. Very tasty. Again a perfect blend of ghee, sweetness, full of kaju.
Mattha(butter milk) - one can skip this.

Service was promt , they even guided us about what dishes to be combined as a whole. The owner also came and asked us about the food and service, which was really very sweet of him.

Since the area of salt lake is like a puzzle to me, it was a bit difficult for me to locate this one. But once you enter its a whole new different place. Amidst the hustle bustle of city life, this restaurant is a village theme done up beautifully. Dim lamp lights, beautiful paintings, the decor is too good. The food is served in dry leaves. We ordered two baati chokha thali and it was enough for three of us... The litti and chokha was amazing but that one dish standing out was moong daal ka halwa. I guess I have never tasted anything better than that. The service was a bit slow but then the food was worth the wait.

First of all, I am not a fan of veg food. Second, given I choice, I will only try non veg . And this determination is surely shaken after I tried food here.  I tried this on a Saturday afternoon, so not much compromising with my usual non veg food schedule and here is what I feel about it. 

Food - awesome veg food and possibly better than the other veg restaurants I have tried in the city. Paneer Papad Pakoda is good as a starter. The Litti Ckokha (or Bati the way they call it ) is very very tasty. This with chokha and ghee on top of it makes it perfect. 
The parathas  are superb (I tried Aloo and Sattu paratha) and large in size. I tried Banarasi Aloo Dum - this was ok. 

Staff - very polite. I liked the gentleman who served us. They may be bit busy at times

Ambience - perfect rural atmosphere. The decor is very nice. Seats are comfortable. Big tables. Wooden plates - all in all, very good. 

Price - very reasonable. Nothing to complain about. 

Service - a bit slow as many people in this forum have already mentioned. 
Rest all is good. 
A sure recommendation from my side.

The place has a themed look and gives a cosy feel, the staff are also courteous and polite now coming to the food, me being from U.P. know the taste of Authentic Banarasi Food and YES the food was good, the chef did justice to its name of BANARASI FOOD. I ordered Butter Milk, Sattu Baati & Mixed Chokha which gave me the same taste as my Mom's preparation, the Tomato chuttney was also good. On the dessert part i ordered Kheer & Moomg Dal Ka Halwa both were tasty but the Moong Dal Halwa was the best and is a must have, the kheer was also good but i felt the quantity could have been better. And the Mixed Chokha is also priced a little high. Overall I am Satisfied with the place.

Very nice ambiance and good food.  Nice place to  enjoy Litti Chokha in a Village theme restaurant. The chokha and the chutneys that are served with the batis are really great.  Papad paneer tikka is a must to have in starter.  Among dessert Bakheer is also good. Menu has limited options but if u want to have proper Litti Chokha , this place is ranked 1.  
comfortable and peaceful place to enjoy with Family.

The place has a nice rural ambience complete with a mock well and charpais imparting a very rustic feel. I quite enjoyed the baati chokha, both sattu and paneer stuffed options.  The stuffing for the  paneer paratha was a bit bland. Also daal puri was quite papad like and not up to the mark. However, the sweet endings were pretty likeable.  Quite liked the kheer and churma.

To those people who go by the name thinking it as a marwari bhoj place. Thats not what you're gonna get. Its actually benarasi not rajasthani. When rajasthani food comes in mind the first dish which hits our mind is dal baati and choka. The name of this restaurant does describe so but isnt that marwari type. Its basically the u.p type bhoj. 

Now U.P too has such types of food like litti. Which you'll get here by the name of baati. Thus, whoever is thinking to go in future to this place considering to have a marwari bhoj. Please dont. Incase you want a benarasi flavour? Please do then. And just want a change? Sure you can. It has a nice theme of the village. Nice sitting arrangement too. You can always enjoy with a couple or family hete. The service was good aswell.

But the Food is very tasty and authentic, those who are looking for Authentic Bihari Cuisine will definitely love it. Things to Order
Don't miss Special Baati Chokha.
Kheer is too Good.

Baati Chokha was suggested by my local friend. He is a regular out there and we visited this on a Thrusday. Ambience is unique with it's village like theme. The Lanterns design is really beautiful along with wall painting. Food were served over a plate made of dry leaves. This natural plate was on a wooden base. 
Baati was looking awesome and tasted batter. Chokha with daal and Tomato mix was delicious. Ghee was taking it to the next level. In the desserts section, churma sweet and rice based kheer were lovely and highly rush with ghee taste. 
Overall a delicious experience for me!! 
Every hardcore non veg lover should give it a try.

Churma and kheer, we ordered as dessert and both are just mouth watering. I highly recommend this small Benaras to all f you. Please keep it in mind, this place is not for non-vegies. I am sure you all will live this place if you are a Food Lover.

Hi guys, be very careful when you deal with the folks in this restaurant. My experience is they will steal your money if they can. Last Saturday(11-6-16), I had ordered food for home delivery. My residence is stone throw away from the restaurant. It was a bill for Rs. 600/- I handed over a Rs.1000/- note. The guy who made delivery offered to adjust it (Rs. 400) with the next bill. This is something that the restaurant had done earlier also. However, today (13-6-16) when i offered to place my order for home delivery, firstly the restaurant owner refused to take the order and when i reminded him that he was already holding my money, to my utter surprise, HE REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE WAS IN POSSESSION WITH MY MONEY. Now that's STEALING in my opinion. I am sure you will agree.
As proof I am enclosing some bills of orders i had placed on this restaurant. I had made several more orders, but I had not retained all the bills. however, luckily i have proof that this kind of refund adjustment is done by this restaurant (see second bill). The last bill, is of last Saturday (11-6-16).
Since the delivery guy who brings the food calls me when he is at my doorstep, I am sure police authorities will be able to trace bonafide of my complain through tower triangulation. The Guy who made the delivery called me from the phone no. +917872007710 at 8-09 pm.
Of course I shall also complain to the police. Not because of Rs. 400 stolen by this resturant, but because I fear that he may have already done this to others who did not know how to respond or that once he has gotten this idea he may try on others too. But you guys beware too.

I always had a complaint that salt lake lacks a  good pure vegetarian eatery and this is just the right place to redress it. What is more exciting is that it serves Rajasthani cuisine , something you don't find usually. Located just opposite to the labony Kali temple, the setting is of an earthen thatched hut with cots outside for people to sit and wait for their turn. The interior is soothingly rustic with frescoes and dim lanterns imparting the perfect village feeling of Rajashtan. The food too is amazing.
I went there for a family dinner and it turned out to be a good decision.
For starters we had:
•Ulta-Pulta, which was made by stuffing thin gram flour(besan) pancakes with cottage cheese,capsicums and tomatoes. It was just the right dish to start with. Crispy and delectable;
•Phara, rice dumplings stuffed with a mixture of pulses. It was properly cooked but should have been a bit more spicy as its meant to be. The tamarind chutney provided with it was just perfect.
In the main course we had Palak Kofta, Mix Veg, Aloo paratha, Paneer Paratha and Sattu Paratha.
•Palak Kofta was simply amazing. It was different from the usual koftas one eats.

•Mix veg, though a common offering was prepared excellently with piquant flavours.

•Parathas were huge with generous stuffings and tasted great with the vegetables and the assortment of chutneys provided. The spicy coriander chutney was simply outstanding; you could club it with everything from starters to the parathas.
The service was nifty and the waiters were polite. A great experience. Looking forward to visiting it again.

Staff: well behaved, helpful, polite.
Service: quite slow
Food: food was good. The paneer pakoda, Churma, baati, litti ... everything was on point. Baati was a little stiff but. ( Not a fan of rajasthani food, so when I say it was good believe me,it was)
Pocket pinch: reasonable.

The only thing that stands out here is the Rajasthani Ambience. Everything else is disappointing. First look at the menu and you will realise that you have limited options. And then not everything on the menu is available. Even with this limited option, you will be told that it is going to take time for your order to be delivered. Staff are good but the service is very very slow. Quality of food is also average  including their so called specialities. Landed up visiting this place as some of the others in Salt Lake that I intended to visit had long queues and this turned out to be a disappointment. Avoid!

As soon as u enter this place,it gives u a feeling of Rajasthan. A diminutive version of Rajasthan where everything is so made out of clay and so beautifully the interiors are done.
Coming to food,we had ordered
Paneer Pakoda - it was crisp from outside and succulent from inside giving it perfect texture and within paneer was some spicy masala stuffed to it which made it absolutely perfect
Sattu Batti & Chokha- Tummy filling as the stuffings of sattu is very heavy. However, the batti was well prepared and even the Chokha
For main course we ordered
Dal Handi- which was pretty average
Mix Veg. - nicely prepared with all the raw and freshness of veggies intact in it. Not overly cooked and tasted well to me
ALU Paratha- average again, I didn't like the stuffing of ALU inside it. It should be made a lil more spicy
Chutneys which they serve are really amazing and goes well with the food which they serve.
Would definitely like to visit again to get the Rajasthan feel all over again.
Suggestion: they should play songs . it would add to the ambience.

The ambience of the place is just awesome. Totally gives the feel of being in Rajasthan. If u are searching for an authentic cuisine this is exactly where u should go.
 We ordered khadi chawal which is a traditional Rajasthani food. The khadi was exactly how it is made at our home. 
I did not particularly like the plain baati. 
The chatni n fried mirchi they served was great.We also had aloo parantha which was okayish. 
The food is not something to die for but the ambience and khadi covered it up for me. You wont miss fish or chicken here. 
Also, the pocket pinch is so reasonable! :) little improvement here and there and they have a long way to go.

This place is a mix of great ambiance, good food and great service. One should visit this place to know what a theme restaurant should be. Absolutely love their village theme and the details. 

Litti / Bati and Chokha is one food I love and most of the time eat at roadside stalls near our house. So when a full blown restaurant was launched dedicated to it and more I was overjoyed. The main items, the baati chokha here is great. The chokha and the chutneys that are served with the batis are yumm too. I can complete my lunch / dinner with them only.

The matha / buttermilk was refreshing. 

Among snacks we tried the Ulta Pulta which was a fun dish like an omelette. The Phara tasted ok, but the amount was huge. It needs atleast four people to complete what they serve. So unless you have a large group I wont recommend ordering it.

Among dessert Bakheer is a must try. Kheer made with jaggery and tasted awesome. A must visit family restaurant, not only for the vegetarians, but also for non vegetarians. Believe me, if you are open minded, you wont miss your meat or fish here.

This kitschy restaurant serving Rajasthani and authentic Benarasi cuisines is themed like the inside of thatched-roof huts in a traditional Indian village, giving off a soothing rustic vibe with its charming artistic alpana on mock mud walls, wall frescoes of the ghats of Benaras, a lit tulsi manch, hanging hurricane lamps, handcrafted knick-knacks and dim lighting amidst a bucolic setting and backdrop. The veggie-friendly dishes were served in circular wooden plates covered in saal leaves, with water in earthen cups; even the menu card was shaped like a winnow. We ordered the khichadi that came with curd, chokha, ghee, papad and pickle, followed by plain paratha, sattu paratha and the day's speciality mattar paneer. The food items were piping hot served straight from the kitchen, fresh and delectable. Only if some folk music had played in the background the aura would have felt more authentic. The eatery with its unique and attractive entrance has gained popularity as guests wait outside just to acquire a cosy seat inside that remains occupied most of the time. For North Indian vegetarian dishes to be enjoyed in a mellow thematic ambience of a rural village at reasonable prices, this place can surely be included in one's gastronomic itinerary.

When I came out of this restaurant, I was missing this place already! 😍

Ambiance - 5/5
Food - 4.5/5
Service - 4.5/5

I've been in this city for 2 years, and I had never visited this place. You need to understand how stupid I am.

Ambiance will straight away win your heart. It basically gives you an insight of how things look in a rural setup, away from the hush and rush of a metropolitan. It does have an AC. The food and drinks are served in wooden thalis, in glasses made of clay, and in leaf plates; the table looks so authentic bcz of this. Please do check the photos I've attached.

Food is equally superb. We tried Sattu baati (immersed in ghee), Baigan-aloo Chokha, 3 varieties of chutneys, Aloo Paratha, Paneer Paratha and Butter milk. All the dishes I've mentioned were top notch. I mean just for the sake of complaining I can say that there was less salt in Paneer Paratha. That's it, everything else was just perfection.

Bill came out to be 800 for 3, which is pretty affordable. Highly highly recommended if you're in Salt Lake.

Eery single item served was delicious, Except for the bakheer. I will suggest order the simple kheer. The sattu paratha is very filling. They stuff it very generously. The decor is also very good.

One of the most authentic restaurants for Bihari cuisines in Calcutta. I wonder why is it named "Baati Chokha" & not "Litti Chokha". Every dish right from litti chokha to khichri is awesome and not at all heavy on your pocketl. 

Though food options are limited to vegeterian Bihari cuisines, ambience is suited perfectly for the mood. Anything you order, quantity is good enough for one person; & it's so delicious that you will end up finishing it yourself. Staff is very polite and friendly.

An essence of village with the perfect taste and blend of spices, the place is worth the money. Being new the place is still unknown to many but the food is great. Specially the taste of Litti with the smell of ghee and chutney is amazing. Dishes are limited but each is too good in taste and the parathas are also very perfectly baked. #PLACE TO VISIT AGAIN

1. Ambiance is just perfect , a typical Banarasi feeling.
2. Staffs are very well behaved. 
3. Prices are reasonable .
4. Quantity is more than enough. 
*5*. Every food items are just delicious.
Tips- If you order Paratha then remember 1 paratha=4 Slices :) (For 5 people you can order 3 parathas )

Highly recommended  ^_^

One Friday (Last Year), me and my friend decided to try some place new for dinner. It was 9:30 PM then. We searched on Zomato and came across Baati Chokha, which was fairly new then, and a little close from our home and immediately decided to check it out.
We reached at around 10 and were amazed by the setting and hospitality. The staff was very well disciplined and friendly and took care to be on our constant care.
We ordered One Aloo Paratha, One Paneer Paratha and One plate Veg Kofta (All Without Onion and Garlic). 
To this day both the Paratha's remain the best stuffed paratha's I have ever tasted anywhere. Veg Kofta was soft and super delicious too.
The quantity and quality was so superb, that we were completely stuffed and full from this much only, and decided to just order something sweet as the finale.
The waiter suggested Bakheer (Gur ki Kheer) as their specialty and it really was one of the Best Gur Ki Kheer I have tasted.
We were completely blown away by the taste and deliciousness of the food.
With no more space to even drink water, we decide to visit this place once every quarter.
But we ended up going almost twice every month from there on.
To this day, it remains our favorite place if we wish to eat Stuffed Paratha.
We have also tasted other dishes during visits with friends and families, and they were amazing too.

A very new restaurant serving typical benarasi and bihar cuisine consisting of mainly daal baati churma, sattu baati and chokha.... The quality is very good and price us very reasonable... The quality and quantity is both very good. I hope this place gains more popularity because there are very few places in Kolkata were you get sattu baati (litthi) and chokha.... A must visit for vegetarians or people who like benarasi and bihari food. Overall very good food.

I Went here for lunch with a couple of friends. The decor is that of a village. We ordered the thali. The service was very slow. The food though was tasty. It was authentic baati choka. If want to taste the food of UP,  Bihar, banaras. This place is a must visit. The restaurant is bit small and cramped. I would give it 10/10 only for it's food.

This place is located near FD park. It serves banarasi cuisine. The restaurant has the look and feel of rural India. Nice Decor. Now coming to the food,everything was simply awesome. We ordered ulta pulta, paneer papad paoda and paneer tikka for starters. They were good. Their special attractions are the chutneys they serve specially the green coriander , baked tomato and sweet tomato. Simply loved them. Coming to the main course we ordered dal, sattu bati and chokha served along with ghee. It was finger liking good. Next we ordered paneer and aloo parathas and ghee chapatti along with dahi bhindi and masala bhindis. The parathas were very soft and tasty and the bhindi dishes were simply awesome. For desert we ordered mung  dal halua and gulab jamun. Special mention to the mung dal halua. It was heavenly. The only downside of this place is their washroom which doesn't have a lock. I would request the management to please look into this. Overall service was good. Would love to visit again :)

We were planning to visit this place and finally visited on a friends bday party...
Ambiance will make you remind of some dhaba in village, they serve food in leaves and that's unique.
We ordered paneer takki,paneer papad pakoda and ulta pulta.. All of them are good, I'll recommend ulta pulta.
In main course we ordered Dal,Sattu bati and chokha served with ghee.. And that was too tasty....
And then we ordered plain chapati,aloo paratha and paneer paratha with dahi bhindi and bhindi masala.. Paratha will make you remind of home and dahi bhindi was delicious.. At last we ordered mung halwa and gulab jamun in desert,mung halwa was good..
Ambiance : 4.5/5.0
Service : 3.5/5.0

Visited few days back, on a weekday. It is opposite of kali mandir, near labony, Saltlake. Ambience was good. Giving the feeling of rajasthani appearance. Mainly baati and chokha is the main food here. We had ordered for plain baati, sattu baati, Paneer baati, yellow dal, Paneer paratha, Benarasi Aloo, churma in desert. Staffs were friendly and helpful. Service was slow. Not very spacious. Food was not good enough, once visited is fine. Baati was so stiff. They didn't knew how to make churma only. Chokha and chutney were good given with the baati.

Loved the food. The ambience is great. The staffs have a pleasing behavior. Overall a good one. I would agree to the point that the food being a bit costly, but when looking at the traditional style of the restro, you will readily forget the price. Good ones to try are the churma, lassi and kheer. A must visit place in Kolkata.

Though I am a hard core non vegetarian still after going through so many reviews on this restaurant and made my mind to visit.
Really surprised to see the décor and ambiance of the place. Very attractive and authentic too. 
Lot of option is available to choose from the menu. Typical Benaras gharana food.
 Ordered aloo paratha, banarasi Alu dam, chokha, chapati , lassi and special baati thali- rice,dal,baati (sattu and paneer),  pickle, kheer etc. Food was excellent. 
Staffs were very much polite and helpful.
Error is service level.  They  took almost 30 mints to serve. This is the only area of concern which they should improve.
Overall a satisfactory experience.

Great ambience!! I love the earthly coolness of this place!and great service-we were served by three waiters and three of them were warm polite and friendly!making the experience all the better!for starters we had ordered Ludhiana paneer tikka which is a new item in their menu and also the "today's special"(on that day)!it was v good!for main course we ordered the special batti chokha combo,khichdi meal combo and sattu paratha combo!all of which we had with excess of desi ghee the vessel of which was kept right at the centre of our table.to be very honest be it the khichdi,chokha,sattu paratha or even the batti all of these were okay!a new experience of banarasi food nothing else.for deserts we had kheer(which was a part of the special batti combo)and thandai-both were to die for!! To sum up the starters and the deserts are great!the ambience and the hospitality is commendable but as far as heavy meal(main course) is concerned- it will be liked only if authentic banarasi food and it's taste is considered! Will definitely visit again especially for their warmth and the thandai!!

Baati Chokha located in sector 3 of salt lake is a theme restaurant reminding you of the days of the old.  As the name suggests,  baati also known as litti is the main item on the menu.  Lipsmackingly reminding you of mom's food,  baati Chokha is sure to find a place in the top 3 veg restaurants of Kolkata. 
I found out this place first when they had their outlet at triangular park, but unfortunately that has been closed down now. 
The food tastes amazing here, the decor is also beautiful. IV been to this outlet many times now, and the best part is the consistency in taste. 
Must try items : baati chokha, khichadi &  Bakheer

Baati Chokha was a nice find for us thanks to zomato...we were craving for some nice vegetarian food but not the traditional paneer and stuff like that...hence we did some research on zomato and zeroed in on this place...very nice ambiance....with a village themed interior....the menu was a simple one pager and we ordered special baati Chokha thaali and khichdi...both of them turned out to be awesome...ordered some masala chaach to go with it..overall a very nice experience at a reasonable price. I would certainly recommend this place to all who crave nice and simple vegetarian food...

Ambience was very nice. Village feel. Well decorated with lanterns and wall art. Felt nostalgic as I am from Benaras. Will recommend this place to all who like authenic banarasi cuisine.

I wanted to come to this place for a while and today I got the opportunity to visit.. Once I entered this place I found the decor absolutely ethnic and a feel of village is prominent. We ordered litti and chokha ( apparently it is their speciality). The litti was served with chutney and ghee and it was served in a traditional platter. When I first saw the litti I felt how will it satisfy my appetite as it looked too small in size but after I tried the second piece my stomach was absolutely full. Since it was my first experience of litti so commenting on the taste would be wrong but I can say one thing the way it was served was pretty eye catchy. Lastly, I would say this place is for experimenting and not for regular visits if a person is not a fan of this cuisine.

It was a pretty normal day when we randomly decided to go visit this place for "ghar ka khaana" sort of food.
This place definitely met our expectations. We had to wait for a while before getting seats inside but the waiting area was superbly designed. Typical village ambience. Lamps and khatiyas.
We had litti chokha and mattha , all of which were delicious. The best part?  The bill. Such low cost! Totally affordable and you'd come out of the place with a full and happy stomach.

The ambiance is very unique with hut like structures, wall art and the food being served on leaves. The staff also adorn specific clothes that are native to Rajasthan, if am not mistaken. They are extremely courteous and was of great help in choosing what to order.

We had the baati chokha combo and also the khichdi combo. The former was a very unique experience. Baati is a ball like thing with stuffing inside. You add ghee to it and eat it with the chokha and dal. The latter comes with paapad, curd and more chokha. We also had gurkheer for dessert. Which was delicious too.

The pricing is very reasonable for the quality of food served even if not necessarily the quantity. All in all, a very very satisfying dinner experience.

The place is decorated very sensibly giving a feeling of a village hotel in western UP/ Rajasthan. Everything, right from the menu card to kullars to plates is made as per the ethnic standards. 
Loved the sattu baatis . Others might have varied opinions but I personally felt that the paneer  baatis are somewhat mismatch. One thali is actually heavy for a normal person. Have some space in stomach for a wonderful glass of sweet lassi in the end.

The "Great Bihari Food" vibe is what I felt when I had Sattu Paratha on my wooden plate:-)............................
We started with Hara Bhara Kebab which was good.
Then came the real deal BAATI,SATTU PARATHA (both filled with ghee) along with CHOKHA (with accurate and mouthwatering spices). All of it fulfulled my expectation, some of the battis were little thick with less filling of sattu but overall it was good .....................................................Now the thing I liked the most was the green coloured flamboyant dal like  "Nimona Seasonal" I loved it and would visit the place just for the same again and again. I finished my dinner with Gur Gajar Halwa which was eqally good:-0
Service was good and very helpful.
Place is mostly full during the winters and the interiors is pretty innovative
One thing to be taken care of is not to sit on the table there in front of the washroom.

Was longing to go to this place since long time but initially I found this place not so convenient to reach but actually this place pretty near to city centre. There is theme is very unique never heard of a restaurant from Banaras. Restaurant is small and beautifully decorated with a theme of village mud house. Going to menu option the list is not big but again the list is unique.Other then drinks all the eatables are very unique and you find it everywhere.
Specially went there to eat the phara which was awesome with nice presentation.They can try preparing it with different flour.
All the items were very reasonably priced

I must say that this restaurant serves the best sattu paratha in d city atlst. It was soo delicious. Would love to come agn fr that. They also have very innovative bati - sattu bati, paneer bati which were good too. Their chokhi was also very delicious. We also ordered paneer makhani and paneer paratha which were also good. Gulaab jamun was served cold and was avg. 
Expect a wait of atlst 30-40 mins since it cannot house more than 30-35 people at a time. The ambience is good. The decor is Rajasthani. I liked the fact that they serve on banana plates and earthen pots. 
The prices are reasonable.. Around Rs. 250/- per person. The service is very good.
Would love to go agn. Hope they learn manage the queue as nobody likes to wait for 40 mins!

Went there for a new year outing. The atmosphere is not comfortable to start with. The variety in the menu was too less. Started with papad panner kebeb n hara bhara kabab. The latter was a disaster. Batti was no doubt very tasty. Bread were nt upto the standard at all. Kofta n corn palakr was fine bt paneer was nt that gr8. Overall our first n last visit...

An amazing experience. Very good themed restaurant. Good ambience and interiors. Very very good food. Be sure to try the Paneer Baati. Dnt waste your time on the Plain one. Ask the people for quantity suggestions as the helpings are reasonable large. A must visit. Don't expect fine dining service but absolutely untrained but personalised service. (Pure Veg .... So non-veggies beware).

It is probably the only veg restaurant that I keep going back to and that's a huge recommendation coming from a meat lover such as myself. It is a themed restaurant; the theme being centred around rural India. It's a lovely place to drop by to have the most awesome pander filled paratha with kashmiri aloo dum. The food is delicious, service great and the preparations are made with good quality ghee, which adds great taste. Even the chatni they serve is very tasty.

The service was great. They behaved well. It was Christmas so the place was well decorated. The way of serving food on leaf plates was a great idea, very different from other restaurants that I visited and the food was very tasty and we all enjoyed going to baati chokha last night. I wish to visit it more frequently. Thank-you.

In my 3 days stay at Kolkatta, went twice to this place !

On my first visit here(which was for dinner)we ordered Mathha and Paneer Papad Pakoda to begin with
 and both were yumilivious and the Pakoda was so heavy we had to change our main course plans !

We just had a khichadi Combo for 2 people and even that was yum ! :-)

had to go back second time next day for lunch ! Had Dal bati Combo which was authentic ones which u get in the rural areas of North India. Also had Moong Dal halwa and Gulab jamun which was 😊 

The ambiance is also of a village & you technically don't eat from plate but "Padapodam" leaf.

Loved everything served here .I wish it had an outlet in Mumbai , would have been amazing !!!

One of the best vegetarian restaurant(village type) in city. Went there for lunch last week.
Located near FD park, could be difficult to search if you are not familiar with saltlake area.
Interior decor and ambiance is really nice and impressive.
Service was fast and waiters were very polite and take care of everything what you want, I liked it very much.
Now food, it was served in mud plate covered with leaf and water was served in clay pot, again very impressive.
We ordered Phara(served with potato fries), Paneer Pakoda, special dal-baati thali(which contains Dal, two Satto batti, Chawal, Baigan Chokha, Ghee and churma as we prefered it over kheer) and matta. Trust me all food was very tasty and upto the mark.
Price is also reasonable. Will definitely visit this place again.
Recommend for people looking for Sudh Deshi Khana. :)

First time ever tried a vegetarian restaurant. Had to visit for ritual obligation. the first feel on entering the restaurant will give you feel of standing in middle of North Indian village chowk (crossroad). Ambiance is the most interesting part.
Started with Lassi and Mattha. Both are good and refreshing but lassi was preferred by my taste buds.
In food not much option to my preference hence ended up ordering Special Baati Chokha thali. Will recommend Sattu Baati over Paneer Baati. However to relish its actual taste much be drenched in ghee. Chokha was delicious. Daal was normal. Go for churma compared to kheer. One thali was ok for 2 person however have to take extra baati.
Service was fast, price is little towards higher side. May try it once.

Amazing decor,nice food,a must try for people looking to experiment with different cuisines..
We had ordered sattoo baati,paneer pakora and hara bhara kababs..the food tasted really good.besides,,pricing is also quite reasonable..
However they should work upon training their staff well and should also provide finger bowls at the end of the meal...
PS-locating it can be a trouble for people not familiar with salt lake..

The food experience here was amazing! First the ambience, then the inside decor along with the way the table was spread! Coming to the main part, the food, it was lipsmacking! The baati chokha accompanied by shudh ghee and other side dishes was simply awesome! We were 3 and we ordered a baati combo, aaloo parathas and bhindi masala! Trust me out of the 3, 2 of us are big time foodies and we had trouble  finishing it all up! On top of that we ordered chaach, and lastly for dessert moong dal halwa and gulab jamun! All in all it was an mind boggling super tasty experience worth remembering!

Have been to this outlet a couple of times and keep recommending it to everyone I know. They do a select few dishes (read one-page menu) and they do those right. I generally order sattu baati with mixed chokha, daal and mattha and always end up eating more than I intended to. They have this 'ghar ka khanna' wala feel. The service is pretty fast. Visit it with family for a pocket friendly experience.

This place deserves a Very Good Review!

Not only because it has great food, but also great people to boot with. I haven't come across any restaurant in Kolkata which serves food with so much love. 'The staff is warm, helpful and caring. Excellent service!!!
What makes the deal sweeter is the ambiance.. warm nice friendly place.. which reminds me of my roots. food is served on pattals (Soft plates made of leaves).. not boring plates... there are sweet smelling kulhars (small glasses made of mud)  in which they serve you water (for some reason its tastier in this restaurant) and Mattha (Buttermilk). 
Now comes the best part. The food is amazing. Authentic and tasty. I loved the green chutney which came with pakoris! Baatis were rich and tasty and chokha was yummy. So was the Sattu Parantha ordered by my husband. 

Awesome experience


Edit: Dined here recently. The food quality has definitely gone down and that warmth is missing from the servers. They stopped serving that sweet tomato chutney and refuse to serve you that unless you order certain kind of food. The food also gave me bad indigestion this time around.. never happened before! ☹️

Away from the modern interiors, the rusticity of the restaurant is the prime attraction..Warmth oozes right from the moment u enter the restaurant till you finally move out after completing your meal. 

The food is simple and can be best termed as "home style food". The staff well explains the dishes. 

The dishes hold a great deal to the authenticity which they proclaim. The portions are big.

Only setback is the large sitting arrangements since all tables are meant for seating 6 people.

I loved the dotting taste of chillies which is dominant in all dishes so anybody who cannot tolerate the high chilli factor do let your preference known in the very beginning.....

Once you enter the restaurant it feels very nice. Ambience is very charming. Once we entered a pungent smell greeted us. We thought it was room freshner. It was feeling like we will have headache. At last we could figure it out. It turned out to be the smell of pheneol. The person who was mopping the floor seemed to have used full bottle. Really disgusting for a restaurant. Anyhow we ordered for bati the famous menu of the restaurant. Oh!! A reminder... When you visit the restaurant pls take a small hammer to break bati. If you like table manners then this is not for u as u will have to apply your body strength to break it. The bati that was served was not at all eatable. Seemed bati prepared earlier was served just by heating again.  But yes service was very good.  Overall a big thumbs down. Spoiled the Sunday evening. I have given 1.5 rating for gd ambience and good service.

The ambience at Baati Chokha is bright, warm and inviting. The service is also wonderfully warm. I wish the food lived up to this. I had the special baati chokha, their luxury thali. First off, I was not a fan of the baati, the shell was too hard, the paneer filling had dried up and failed. I am no expert on an authentic baati, but my tastebuds did not enjoy this. The chokha was serviceable. The standout of the meal was gur kheer which was sinfully rich and laden with cashew. 

Earlier we had ordered a lassi and ulta pulta, which turned out to be a homemade style cheela (I have had and probably made better :-/). Much regret about not going for a standard roti subzi combo :(

Though one is not spoilt for choices, the food served is tasty, comes piping hot and portions are filling. We tried the benaras thali which rice, dal, bati chokha and kheer. We also ordered 'ulat pulat' or chila, which was yummy. The chutneys were also mouth watering good.     The thali had 2 littis, one paneer and a sattu filling. The paneer was simply awesome. Overall a good experience and would love to visit again.

The newly opened place in Salt lake has the perfect decor & it is very attractive, with a north Indian village atmosphere created by mud colored walls they stuck mirrors into the wall randomly just like real mud-houses does hanging lanterns, bamboo work and water served in clay pots. The inside seating area is not huge, but it is comfortable the restaurant serves pure vegetarian North Indian, Rajasthani and Bihari cuisines. The food was served, clay plates covered with dried lotus leaf very unique and eco-friendly idea.The sattu bati which was delicious with the chutney served on a bamboo tray. I loved the sattu paratha and the most tempting palak kofta.
Overall a nice dining experience if you are in a family group with some old people who want a taste of authentic food it's a good choice and also a good break from the regular multi cuisine restaurants and cafe around

Visited the place few days back. The ambiance is authentic UP wala style with patal ka plates n miti ka glass. The food is good n choka is ultimately finger licking good. But for me baati chokha or litti chokha is a street side food n best enjoyed at street side only. But to have authentic UP food with family, its a good option. Should try this once for a different experience.

But when paneer papad pakoras arrived, they were simply brilliant ( though the chutney that accompanied it was not that special) !! I would specially like to mention the plates where the food were served, clay plates covered with dried lotus leaf ( very unique and eco-friendly idea).

Very nice place for vegetarians. Decor is quite good and impressive with awesome food.
We had paneer papad pakode which was damn delicious ..then we had paneer baati and sattu batti along with aloo baingan tamatar chokha..it was an awesome feeling to have such taste in Kolkata. Varieties of chutneys they serve on table is also awesome. Following this we had sattu paratha and paneer parathas which were okay but didn't justify the price.
Last thing which disappointed us was churma and gur kheer, which were below average and cost is too much.
Overall very good restaurant for vegetarians in a peaceful environment and village like decor except they should improve the quality of dessert they serve.

The taste is mouth watering. Even though the resultant is small the ambience is awesome. On Saturday and Sunday they don't give home delivery due to heavy rush. I recommend this place to visit. 
Note : if u planning on weekend try to come early as on peak hours the waiting time reaches around 2 hours. I was alone so they did not had issue to accommodate me .. Amazing food must visit

Baati chokha is newly opened restuarant which is walking distance from home.. its decor is very appealing.. I liked the sattu baati.. paneer baati was not that good.. chokha was amazing.. and complimentary chutney is tasty.. but other items like parathas or yellow dal or kadhai paneer was just ordinary.. being a new restaurant, its all staffs were not well trained..
But overall sattu baati and chokha with chutney is a must try..

Very nice place for vegetarians. Decor is quite good and impressive with awesome food.
We had paneer papad pakode which was damn delicious ..then we had paneer baati and sattu batti along with aloo baingan tamatar chokha..it was an awesome feeling to have such taste in Kolkata. Varieties of chutneys they serve on table is also awesome. Following this we had sattu paratha and paneer parathas which were okay but didn't justify the price.
Last thing which disappointed us was churma and gur kheer, which were below average and cost is too much.
Overall very good restaurant for vegetarians in a peaceful environment and village like decor except they should improve the quality of dessert they serve.

The restaurant serve amazing veg food . I ordered baati choka meal which will serve for one . it consist of 2 baati , choka , rice, dal,ghee and variety of pickles along with loads of ghee. The taste is mouth watering. Even though the resultant is small the ambience is awesome. On Saturday and Sunday they don't give home delivery due to heavy rush. I recommend this place to visit. 
Note : if u planning on weekend try to come early as on peak hours the waiting time reaches around 2 hours. I was alone so they did not had issue to accommodate me .. Amazing food must visit

Baati chokha is newly opened restuarant which is walking distance from home.. its decor is very appealing.. I liked the sattu baati.. paneer baati was not that good.. chokha was amazing.. and complimentary chutney is tasty.. but other items like parathas or yellow dal or kadhai paneer was just ordinary.. being a new restaurant, its all staffs were not well trained..
But overall sattu baati and chokha with chutney is a must try..

I had a taste of baati chokha when they were near to deshpriya park and it was mind blowing experience..... And visited this place last night when i came to know about it from a college friend for meet over venue.... Just same taste with awesome decor and hospitality... They increase pricing of their menu compare to deshpriya park outlet. But quality remain the same... Having their baati and chokha is always feel like streets of benaras with charpai as sitting

A great first time experience of the Taste of Banarasi restaurant. We ordered Baati Chokha combo, Sattu Paratha combo, Bhindi Kurkure for main course. Baati was of Sattu too. And their signature dishes Baati and Chokha stood true to their name!! Ghee ke saath the Taste was amazing! Chokha was made of Aloo, Baingan, Pyaaz, Adrak, lehsoon, hari mirch and methi. For those who have never been here the portions might look small but when u have it with ghee and the complete thali (combo) is enough. Lassi and mattha (buttermilk) given in kulhad (earthen tumblers) the mitthi's lil taste adds and feels like a down to earth drink! Must visit place for foodies

I had been excited about trying out a new cuisine at Baati Chokha ever since I discovered that an outlet opened in salt Lake, thanks to Zomato! :D It wasn't the easiest to locate the place, especially on a very windy, rainy day, but we got there and were greeted warmly and ushered inside. 

The inside seating area is not huge, but it is comfortable. The interiors have been done up to a resemble a rural set up, with lanterns, wall art, etc. In fact, the crockery included glasses and plates made from baked clay and the menu design was creative too. Well done!

The restaurant serves pure vegetarian North Indian, Rajasthani and Bihari cuisines. The servers were very helpful and after some suggestions and deliberations, we ordered a Mathha (butter milk), Phara, Sattu Batis and Chokha. 

The food arrived quickly. the butter milk was creamy and served in a clay glass, enhancing the flavor of the beverage. Next, came the Phara. It's a dish made from rice and lentils, shaped into thin slices, steamed first and then shallow fried with spices (tadka). The dish was slightly bland, but the accompanying range of chutneys and pickles made it taste wonderful, especially the raw mango chutney and the tamarind one. Also, the dish had lentil fingers as well as french fries.

The Sattu Bati was accompanied with a bowl of ghee and stuffed with a mixture of sattu and other spices. Now, this Bati is a perfect example of how looks can be deceptive. I saw it and thought to myself, "This Bati is so tiny and I can eat at least 4 like this", however, when I was halfway through the Bati, I felt full. Don't order too much at once. It's really heavy and filling. The Chokha was a mix of mashed potatoes, brinjals and tomatoes, along with finely chopped chillies, garlic and onions, laced with mustard oil. I loved the flavor it derived from the oil and the smokiness from the smoked brinjals. 

The service is prompt, the servers are polite and helpful and the food is worth trying. The bill arrived soon after we were done with eating and it didn't burn a hole in our pockets.

So, the ratings for Baati Chokha would be as follows:  

AMBIENCE: 4.25/5

FOOD: 3.75/5

SERVICE: 4/5

VALUE FOR MONEY: 4/5

Baati Chokha....... A pure delight!!!!!
This place recently shifted to Salt Lake from its previous outlet at Triangular Park..... I visited this new outlet for the first time for a family lunch......
Located in the heart of a urban residential area it is altogether different place, it seems you are visiting a beautiful Rajasthani village..... The ambience, the look, the decor - all were totally native and primordial..... The walls were painted beautifully with clay sculptures and hand paintings...... To give it a more indigenous feel little lanterns were hung all over the place , the tableware was wooden, bamboos were used to make up the ceiling for individual cubicles, even the menu cards were presented in an unique manner......
Coming to the food we ordered Hare Bhare Kebabs for starters which came in hot 
and delicious.... Next we ordered some Sattu Baatis along with there famous Chokha, Dal Handi,  Jeera Rice and Dahi Bhindi- which is a must try..... The food was absolutely toothsome...... After a long time I tasted such a succulent and well made Sattu Baati..... There were quite a many "desi" options for desserts.... We ordered Bakheer- it was an appetizing and mouth watering Kheer..... 
The place had already become likeable for me cos of its aura and food but the biggest jewel on the crown was its highly courteous, mannered and hospitable staff..... There actions & gestures were very convivial and well disposed.... May it be informing about a particular dish or pouring ghee over our Baatis so that we enjoy it more , it was all so genial and affable..... They made us actually feel that we are the guests and they are our hosts for an aboriginal invitation..... Really kudos to their service or rather "mehmaan-nawaazi"......
Overall it was a great experience..... A must visit for all the veggie food lovers!!!!! 
It has already found a high place in my list of  favorites..... Hope I visit it soon again for another palatable meal of Baati n Chokha!!!!!!

Finally after positive reviews of the place, Me, Mum and Dad, decided to visit the place, and we liked it a lot.

Location:

A lil in middle, but not difficult to find, with Uber and Ola, its easy to check out, or else, finding a cab there is real difficult.

Ambience:

Looks like a a comfy environment, with village feel and comfortable spacious sitting.

Food:

Short, Concise and to the point menu, with traditional veg food, tasty, and worthy 
We had - 
Paneer Baati
Sattu Bati
Veg Pakoda
Bakheer ( Gur ki Kheer )
Rice
Dal
Churma
Papad Churi
Veg Kofta and Aloo Paratha

Service:

This is the best part, amazing services and fabulous staff, time commitment is super accurate and highly responsive.

Me and Parents adored the Place, a ill steep on prices, but worth the experience and definitely a revisit.

Good food, good decor and good service. 

A new place we tried after hearing mixed reviews. A pure vegetarian Rajasthani food joint. But for people who are not fond of it there are a variety of paratha to choose from. 

For a restraunt the quality of food and preparation was very good. Specially liked the Bati, chokha, kheer, parathas and starters. 

So if you are in a family group with some old people who want a taste of authentic food it's a good choice and also a good break from the regular multi cuisine restaurants and cafe around 

p.s. It's also quite reasonably priced.

The only thing i missed from moving from tollygunge to phoolbagan was Baati Chokha.. missed the ambience, the food, the smell, the taste and the courtesy which these ppl treat you with.. 
To my surprise, they now shifted here.. went as soon as i got to know about it.. same feeling,  same aroma and same satisfaction.. :)

So finally i had Churma after a span of 6 years. And believe me it was too good! 

In thali we had Special Baati Chokha which comprises of delicious Paneer Litthi dipped in Ghee with special aloo chokha along with Rice and daal. Plus the sweet toothsome kheer. 

The decor of a typical Rajasthani/U.P Village  mesmerized me with proper lightings and seating space. 

But coming to that of Price, it was bit expensive i thought since they do not serve extra rice plus there is no option of any sabji in that particular thaali mentioned above. 

Therefore considering all the aspects of food quality, quantity, price, ambience and service i would rate it  3.5!

I had been to this place before when it was close to priya cinema I was there fan could eat their batis at any tym but After shifting to saltlake they had kept d ambienec same but could not match to their previous taste. We had taken two variants of parathas but both didnt had at all fillings in them Even though their speciality good bati was cold as if made before two hours and then served at the table no courstey to even pass theough the oven once again.
And highly increasrd rates just a small bowl of kheer charging Rs 80 really will never think of visiting again

This place is a little difficult to locate its opposite the kali mandir after crossing 11 no. tank but totally worth the "treasure hunt" First off I loved the entrance , the desi decor... very clean and well kept... the hanging lanterns... the small n cozy semi private cubicles ... the mud finish walls with hand paintings , the leaf covered plates n even the waiters' uniform was in accord with the whole rajasthani do...
Now coming to the food...
We ordered the special baati chokha combo... which comes with a large serving of ghee!! Although I liked the sattu baati more both , the sattu n paneer baati were good... went perfectly with the chokha... just the right flavours of mashed potatoes tomatoes and egg plant... with tomato n lasan chutney... the daal was just like "ghar ki daal " and to finish it off... the churma was heavenly...
The kadhi chawal with the kalauji... too good...  specially the kalauji... bhindi... karela n potatoes... dry roasted with spices... oh n u must try the mattha... perfect.
Also kudos to the very attentive staff.. who took care of the helpings as soon as our plates were empty... be it the extra chutney or chokha or daal... or huge servings of ghee... 
Absolutely no flaws... hats off!!

went there with my family on wednesday evening. this was my first visit to the restaurant. the place is pretty cool. i really liked it. they have completely designed it in rajasthani style. but the food was quite ok types. being a marwari , i have tried better dal batti churma in comparison them. the only best part was the kheer. it was pretty good. 5 on 5 for the kheer. the butter milk was also tasty, but the rest of the food like sattu or paneer batti, khichdi, chokas , churma, dal were all averge.

My beloved Baati Chokha has shifted to Salt lake; it couldn't get worse. However, being a super foodie, distance has never come between me and my food. We headed to the FD outlet of this food joint on Wednesday late evening. The two of us ordered a rice, lassi, kadhi pakodi, paneer kadhai and chokhha. We decided to end our meal with churma.  The best part of the meal was the welcome drink, the Chaas that they served. It was pretty darn refreshing. Now coming to the food, the paneer was extraordinarily good, I love the "phoron" or "chokha" that they use- unusual and very very north Indian yet non Punjabi. The kadhi was less on oil(grease) yet tasty, though I thought the chokhha was too pungent (courtesy overuse of mustard oil). The churma was a 3/5, a little dry in texture, hence slightly disappointing. We paid 700 for 2 and came out highly satisfied! Would keep going back to this place whenever I am in town!

Had been to this "desi" North Indian veg restaurant for dinner. The food was different for me but I liked the food mainly the sattu paratha, khichri and Kher in desert. The paratha was very good not a bit of extra oil that went well with banarasi allo dum. Khichri was nice flavoured with desi ghee. Kher was low in sweetness hence superb. A very good option for veg lovers. Must try.

Coming to food... They serve authentic food . 
Must try baati of sattu and paneer. Along wid dal and chokha. Other items are general one nothing so special. 
Now the interior... The place resembles village.. Outdoor seating on khaat also available.
PS: waiter are always in hurry to clean the plates and table even before you finish your food... Pls at least let people eat their food... No one comes to settle down at your restaurant forever.

Baati chokha is a great place for vegetarian's to enjoy many dishes from "Banaras "like Baati chokha ,Phara ,Ulta Pulta and many more ,price is also very decent .
Ambience is amazing as if you have entered in village with bamboo hut and mud wall and wall painting reflect banaras ghat .
Overall a awesome feeling great job done by Baati chokha.

After a lovely experience at the previous outlet at Triangular Park, a family dinner was decided at the new outlet at Salt Lake.

The ambiance resembles a Rajasthani village household, with mud walls, cots, traditional wall hangings and thatched roofs above the seating areas. The warm lighting (in the form of lanterns) completed the interiors, which looked really soothing and pretty at the same time. Outside the AC area, you may sit on traditional cots and wait for availability of seats (in case of a rush), or have your meal there only. 

We ordered Special Baati Chokha, Daal Puri, Alu Paratha and Khichri. The first one came with two baati's - one of sattu and the other of paneer, served with rice, daal, warm ghee, chokha and kheer (which was brilliant). The Daal Puri was far drier than what we are used to having, but tasted decent. It was served with Bakheer, which was a kheer sweetened with Gur (jaggery). It was less sweet than the previous one.
Alu Paratha with Raita is an all-time favorite, and they made it better than what is served at most of the joints in the vicinity. Last but not the least, the Khichri was fantastic! Served with papad and chokha, it was the best khichri I've ever had. Do give it a try!

Service was quite good, with the attendant, Nandan, who happily guided us through the different items served. Prices have been increased at this outlet, but overall it is worth it. 
Baati Chokha is highly recommended. I'm sure you'll want to visit it again! :)

Had heard a lot about them. They have shifted from triangular park to sector 3 so had to go a long way for this place. The ambiance is superb. We had bati chokha, dal, rice combi. It was too good. The placing is great. The accompaniments, as in chutney etc are very good. The only damper was the service after our food was served. Request for additional chutney etc wasn't completed until it was too late. Hence the 4 rating. But that aside. The place is a must visit to experience the North Indian specialty BATI CHOKHA !!! :)
