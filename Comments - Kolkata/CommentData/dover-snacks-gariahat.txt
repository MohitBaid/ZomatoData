The dosa and the aloo chat of this place was nice. The chowmin wasn't up to the mark.Prices are cheap.Ambience is not good, i suggest you to take home whatever you order.

A small little eatery in dover lane serving south indian and chinese. It is one of the oldest restro here. Nothing much to decribe about the decor as it is just homely place perfect for students and the food satisfies your taste buds without burning a hole in the pocket. Had masala dosa and chcken momo. The momos were huge with good quantity of chicken stuffing. Really liked the place and will definitely visit again.

0/5 for ambience, 
Priced a little on the higher side. 
Had a masala dosa which cost rs. 50.
Not bad considering the neighbourhood. 
The dosa was delicious. 
Decent place for a quick snack,  if u dont mind the cat under your table.

Situated at Dover Lane.
If You wanna have South Indian & Chinese in one place at a budget rate you can go but don't expect much.
Ambience is not at all good & service is also same.
Better use take home but use self service.

Located Just opposite to Gariahat Police Station, this place is quite a find. At first impression one might not want to give it a try, but this should be a must place to visit for a quick hearty meal. Eating at this place since the last 3 months i have come to realize that this this place is a gem. The staff is courteous, the owner himself attends the guests with a smile. The place is is local haunt for local offices nearby and banks. Coming to the food , this place serves all types of chinese dishes, and south indian dishes. The chicken Rice Combo & Manchurian is just awesome. The dosas & idlis are just awesome for a quick bite. On some food items the prices are a bit high. I would recommend this place a must visit .

the worst ever service you can experience in kolkata when you step in here. to top it all.. the food tastes pathetic. Burnt dosas.. and burnt uttapams. and rude waiter who apparently happens to be the owner.. and the attitude is u explained. in short no service.. just tasteless food. .. go at your own risk.
