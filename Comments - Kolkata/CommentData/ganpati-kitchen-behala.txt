Twie I have ordered from this restaurant and both the times the food was really nice....first of all I ordered chicken mughlai biriyani and veg biriyani..instead of chicken mughlai biriyani they packed traditional Bengali biriyani..still then I liked the Bengali biriyani and it was really delicious..
Second time ordered chicken kasa and mix veg...and both the dishes were really good...
Overall it is a good restaurant....
And I would love to order from this restaurant again....

I ordered online from here..I had..

Chicken Hakka Noodles - This was average yet good enough..


Chicken Ganpati Kitchen Special Chopsuey - This was quite good, then again this is a special dish of theirs..So it is expected to be good and unique..and in a way it was..

Chilli Chicken Gravy - My personal favourite is chilli chicken so I had it from different places..But what I really really liked about them was that they gave 12 pieces.. :D Apart from that, it was really good, better than what I expected..

Overall, good place for family/friends.. but also good enough for romantic lunch or dinner.. :D

Lovely cosy place to dine with family or friends. The food platter they offer is diverse. The tandoori items are mouth watering and so are the assortment of breads and indian dishes which go along with them, given the price. Chinese food is decent not that good..

Plain Naan was good!

Well to make it short if your living  close to silpara and sakherbazar area....this place is a delightful place to be... the ambience is quite soothing..the taste and quality of food will never let you down... service is up to the mark... and the pocket pinch is quite light..compared to the quality quantity and surroundings... nice place to hang out with family and folks...

Ordered online so will only talk about food

Thai Fish Dry - Not the authentic Thai cuisine to be frank but okay.
Red Pepper Prawn
Red Pepper Chicken
Pepper Chilli Fish

The rest of the foods were also okay.

They take both delivery and packing charges which will be on my mind if I ever plan to to again order from this place.

The Indian dishes they serve are a complete bullshit. The Chinese are still eatable. We had ordered mutton biriyani, chicken Rashmi kebabs, fish Tikka masala. The mutton smelled so raw and it wasn't properly cooked as well. And I haven't had such tasteless biriyani in my entire life. The other day we ordered Chinese, which wasn't the best though, but ok to have. So thought of having Indian this time. First of all they took 2 long hours to serve, and then we were served with this quality. I don't think it deserves even a single star. Really disappointed.

newly built in the place where there used to be Jafraan, another restaurant. ok, but the chef must develop to his art to justify the prices.. over fried meat or chicken makes hard, even timing to add the same spice may differ the taste of food.. the ambiance is renovated, nice.

A new addition to the cluster of multicuisine restaurants in Behala over James Long sarani.Those who live in and around this area can easily identify that Ganpati Kitchen is located exactly at the place where JAFRAN once stood at Sakher Bazer & James Long crossing opposite Axis ATM.
The restaurant is nicely decorated with some eye catching floor lighting work.
The menu consists of Indian and Chinese affair with Moctails and juices added in the beverage section.
Cranberry was the juice of choice for me, and served in a pilzner glass.Wanted to try out bits and pieces from the menu, thus ordered for Tandoori Fish in starters.It lacked the tandoor scorched grilled taste and the quality of fish was also not of top quality, though not stale at all. The coriander chatni was excellent to taste with absolute dipping consistency.
In main course , ordered for Chicken Hupak style and Thai Mixed fried rice.Absolutely loved the taste of Thai fried rice ,as it had a strong taste and flavour of Lemon grass,with perfect balance of spicyness and went well with the chicken dish .Which was rather another variant of a mild Chilli chicken with the ting of spice being added by the spring onions and soya salty taste.The chicken rather tasted good with the pieces being gulp size.
The service was satisfactory as the waiters do serve platter to plate and occasionally filling the water glass as required.Though the dinner plates are all plastic which was a real turn off for me as cutlery was of SS and all serving bowl being bone china.
Over all a decent place to stroll down or for family outing if you are in and around this area.Prices are rather moderate with menu prices being inclusive of tax at this moment.

Ordered Chicken Bharta and Cheese Naan,Butter Naan...Chicken Bharta was good...Naans were good too...but Cheese Naan could have been better prepped.Instead of grating cheese on top had it been infused with the dough it would have been great.Hoping the standards are continued..The same location has had a change of restaurants many times.We can see why.Hoping it does not get repeated.

The interior is very good and inviting. Located at Sakherbazar Jameslong. 
Ordered only for take away. Had ordered Mutton Biriyani. Quantity was generous but the taste was not upto the mark. Tasted burnt, both the rice and the meat. Please improvise.

Food is not that great. It was mildly over cooked and too salty. The service was good. Jovial was staff. Expecting better cooking next time.
