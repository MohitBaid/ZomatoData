A random pick frm zomato this time to try out "home bakery". Pure Bliss keeps the worth of its name thoroughly. Ordered few things from the huge variety of desserts & snacks she keeps. Brownies, cookies & jars were my choices (names have been mentioned in the pictures posted). the nutella cookie was nice...really nice. it was crisp, gooee & yumm. same goes for the ferrero rocher jar...it was ❤ 
All in All, it was really a pleasant experience to order from her. the best part was her behaviour. She's (

on hearing about the goodness of their brownies, i had ordered oreo and choco brownie. both were very delicious . in snacks they have added a surprise element by serving snacks in tea glasses. in bengal it was cha khao. now snacks bhi cha ka glass mein khao. pricing has been kept reasonable. would suggest their brownies and snacks. a dessert and a snack will wipe off 120 rupee from your wealth.

if its desserts, it is gonna be pure bliss. tried their brownie which was simply great. the different types of desserts served in shot like glasses has redefined how desserts are to be eaten. the pricing of the item is reasonable too.one should definitely try out their stuffs.
