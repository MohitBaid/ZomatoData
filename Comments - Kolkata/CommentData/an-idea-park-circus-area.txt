This is a small joint near Park circus located on the main road.Comfortable sitting with simple decor. Ordered Margerita pizza and Kitkat and Oreo shakes. Both the shakes tasted quite similar in taste but was good enough. Late service but altogether a good experience.

I am surprised how places like this have even survived for so long. There is no idea behind building this place. Food menu is very very basic but they failed even in that.  The place lacks a vibe and a life.  All dirty and unprofessional.  Going here is literally wasting money. A clear example of how bad management can destroy places.

NEVER VISIT THIS PLACE.
This place is nothing!
Ambience is horrible. Litters here and there, no cleanliness, bulbs fused, tables and chairs are untidy, the menu card is in a going-to-die condition: torn from sides and the lamination is all gone. 
The place looks like an abandoned cottage with few lights hanging here and there. 
The food is disappointing. Cheese sandwiches hardly had cheese. Bread was chewy- no softness. And the size was a little larger than a biscuit. 
The kitkat shake was HORRIBLE. There was hardly any milk. Hardly any chocolate. Presentation was really very bad. 
We asked them to compensate for that. They gave lime soda. Even that was bad. Badly presented. Too much sugar. The nimboo-pani which you get  roadside is better than this. Atleast they put lime in it.

Moreover the behaviour of the staff wasn't that good. 
Only one lady handling the entire kitchen. Food serving was delayed too much. Seems they are least bothered about the maintenance of the place and the food.
Such a good location but such a disappointing visit.

It was a perfect place for Business and Entrepreneurship Meeting! I used to visit this place frequently with my team mates mainly for spending some quality time over a cup of coffee or RedBull. I used to like this place but nowadays they have included Hokkah and all these stuff which has made it a chill out spot rather than a meeting area! I am afraid that this place is loosing its vision including these kind of chilling items! Food is average!
I hope the management will look into their vision perfectly and will set their menu according to that!

this place has potential but its still a let down. the place is not well maintained. First time i walked into a cafe and saw litters lying around. The floor, stairs everything looked unclean. The menu card needs lamination. ordered french fries and margherita pizza. The food was if not awesome but average. But the place can do a lot better with more care and professionalism by the staff there. I dont know if they are even reading our reviews. I hope if they do and improvise.

Very very disappointing. There's no life inside this cafe. Too boring. When we entered the cafe there was one lady who was busy talking over the phone and didn't bother to greet us or pay attention to us. When we were all set to place the order most of the items that we wanted were not available. Finally we made up our mind to have hawaiian pizza, crispy chilli baby corn and green apple ice tea. Pizza was not properly baked. Crispy chilli baby corn was too hard inside and wasn't crispy at all. Only the beverage was fine. Service is very poor. Inadequate number of staffs. Staffs are very very unprofessional. They got the pizza but forgot to bring the dishes.

This place is moderately well decorated. The furnitures don't match. Ambience-wise, it's very boring. We were the only customers on the ground floor.

SERVICE: Now, whatever I tried to order, they had served the customers just before us and was not available anymore. I was so angry, we only ordered 2 dishes instead of 4.
After waiting for like 30-40 minutes only the burger arrived. Then another 15 minutes for our Café Frappe after we finished our burger!

I LIKED THEIR: Chicken Burger with Mayo Coriander Dip. It was really good. It was more like an Indian Burger with no cheese but masala and chutney and very little mayonnaise. The buns were crunchy on the outside and soft from inside. Surprisingly, they had put capsicum in the burger (and I HATE capsicum) and it went well with the Indian style. The Café Frappe (we had actually ordered cold coffee but then they said we have to order Café Frappe as that's what it is but had still put both of them in as different options with different prices) was good.

I DIDN'T LIKE THEIR: We only ordered these two (as they seemed out of everything we asked) and luckily liked both of them.

Not a good place to be to . The interiors are very boring . The restaurant is also inadequately staffed . We saw a person coming to take order after a long time . Hookah there chokes like anything . Most of the times the staff are busy among themselves . Food is basically amateur cooking . Just ok for a cup of coffee . Avoid otherwise .

Located off Circus Avenue opposite Haji Saheb.

Planned to visit this new place on a Sunday evening. They had promoted themselves on Groupon, now nearbuy, so we had a voucher.

The place is well designed utilising the space available. Well themed to have creative discussions etc. A new concept truly. But the staircase leading to the mezzanine does not go proportionate to the height. I probably bumped twice, bruising my head.

Here comes the worst part. 
The manager, not trained at all. Complains started that he cannot honour the deal and the deal with groupon is not fixed and blah blah. He ended up honouring it.
Nearly 70% of the items were unavailable. So we had to be content with what was available. Even in the mocktails a few of them were unavailable. So we ordered from the menu, drinks which were far more expensive. Because of lack of training he ended up accepting the order.
Ordered French fries, Idea special burger, Chicken Sandwich, 2 Oreo shakes (part of the deal worth 300)
And from the menu ordered Idea special pizza as a replacement for an item not available.
Pizza was horrendous. Other items were okay.
And in total i probably had to wait 2 hours for the full order to arrive. Lack of staff and chef it seemed.

The manager ended up by giving me a bill of only Rs.100.
We thought of correcting him, but with the horrible experience, we did not think of paying any extra. 
Feel sorry for the owner.

'An Idea' struck us one Sunday evening when we were searching for a nice cafe to drop in. The place is nicely done up, making good use of the space across two floors. It does look like a typical hookah parlour and their choice of loud party music further accentuates the vibe. We were their only customers that evening, and duly chose a couch on the first floor. The woman who came to take our orders informed us that none of the iced teas that we wanted were available, much to our dismay. We finally settled for a Green Apple Lemonade and an Egg Fried Burger. 
The food was served within 15 minutes. The lemonade was a tad bit stronger in flavor than we had wanted but it was refreshing. What stole my heart and changed my feelings regarding that place was the egg burger. Trapped between the mayo slathered burger buns were a patty of potato, a nicely fried egg placed sunny side up, a slice of cheese, onions, tomatoes and slices of cucumber. It was extremely juicy and yummy. The best part was the perfectly done fries. They were hot, crispy and came with some masala sprinkled on top. Together with the ketchup dip, the dish spelled so much comfort. 
I hope the cafe owner makes it a point not to keep half of their menu items unavailable or out of stock and this surely would turn out to be a better place.

Location: Opposite Haji Saheb, Park Circus; A stone's throw from the Park Circus 7-point Crossing.

An Idea is the newest addition to the list of upcoming cafés in Kolkata but, isn't yet another herd-walker. This café, as the name subtly suggests, is all about coming up with something new. An Idea walks in as an all new corporate café wherein one could peacefully discuss business over a refreshing beverage or some delicious snacks!
Spread across two levels, the ground and the mezzanine, the AMBIANCE spells of a positive vibe and does lift up the mood and aid relaxation. The pristine white walls & ceiling, with business-oriented quotes across, need regular maintenance so as to not send across a negative first. The combination of cushioned as well as leather upholstered seating which could seat around thirty heads added as a plus.
The ventilation needs to be worked upon and the music volumes could be kept low as the loud levels might end up disturbing a corporate discussion. A routine mopping would help upkeep the place. Happened to visit this place for the first time on an Invitation for Food Audit and thereafter have visited it a couple of times.

Coming to the FOOD, the menu on offer was widespread and looked promising enough with a plus of included non-vegetarian fare. But, the dessert options need to be increased. The following was sampled across all visits:

- Blueberry Lemonade
Bottled blueberry crush proportionately used with a well-prepared lemonade. The blueberry flavor was found to be subtle. Could have been a notch higher to give the drink a nice texture & a better taste.

- Pineapple Soda
The drink was just about average and lacked the spot on fizziness. The fruit flavor was found to be too low and the soda had minimal fizz. Has a scope of improvement.

- Café Frappé
Frappé is a Greek foam-covered iced coffee drink made from brewed coffee.  Was well-prepared and had a nice & strong aftertaste of brewed coffee. Served with a dollop of ice-cream on top added as a plus. However, a frozen scoop of ice-cream & a quenelle of whipped cream would have lifted up the level of presentation. Nevertheless, the beverage did taste good.

- Green Apple Lemonade
This drink proved to be a hero throughout. A perfect balance between the flavored crush & lemon juice was struck every time it was ordered. Yes, there were repeat orders. Perfectly done lemonade with the right amount of green apple crush. Tasted refreshing! Highly recommended.
The umbrella straw could be swapped with a lemon wedge for a formal presentation.

- Mix Berry Shake
This drink was a disappointment, mainly because of its disproportionate punch of flavors. The mix of the assortment of berries (read: flavored syrups/crush) failed as the proportion wasn't looked upon. Has a huge scope of improvement. A striking of perfect balance & usage of fresh berries (raspberries, strawberries & blueberries) instead would do wonders. Adding a banana & a well set vanilla-flavored ice-cream to the beverage would take the flavor a notch up.

- Mango Smoothie
A nicely prepared smoothie with low-fat yoghurt, toned milk, flavored syrup & chopped frozen fruit always tastes nice. However, the thick consistency of the beverage was difficult to sip on due to the narrow-mouth straw. A broad-mouth could be better bet. Nevertheless, the beverage impressed. The frozen fruit/coarse crush could be substituted by a ripe fruit in season.

- Blue Lagoon
The drink had a nice balance of Blue curacao syrup, lime & soda. Was extremely refreshing!
Recommended.

- Spicy Mojito
A twist to a virgin mojito was to have the mint leaves swapped with crushed green chillies. The swap was an instat hit and the mojito tasted awesome. Fizzy enough to satiate the bases and spicy enough to leave a nice aftertaste.

- Cold Coffee with Icecream
Failed to live up to the expectation. The coffee flavor was found to be flat and needed to be a tad stronger. Nevertheless, the blend of milk, coffee, ice-cream and sugar was fine. The consistency of the drink could be thicker than served.
The drink as a whole could be improved a lot.

- Hot Chocolate
The mahine-made beverages do taste good but, fail to produce consistency throughout. The drink was thick & extremely chocolatey till the three-fourth portion of the cup. Thereafter, the chocolatey flavor diluted and the drink was too dilute for the liking.
However, a hand-made hot chocolate would always prove to be better! R&D could be done for the betterment of the drink.

- Masala French Fries
Crisp, seasoned & slightly greasy fries served along with ketchup. Was just about average to taste.

- Veg burger
A flavorful, slightly oily & crisp Aloo (Potato) Patty sandwiched along with fresh slices of tomatoes, cucumber, onion & iceberg lettuce inside a mayo-spread burger bun tasted delicious. However, the shape of the bun could have been maintained and the spread of the mayo be restricted to the inside of the bun (and, not to the sides as well).

- Veg Sandwich
Fresh cold cuts (tomatoes, onion & cucumber) sandwiched between two slices of bread along with perfect seasoning were grilled to crispness. Delicious to taste. Was accompanied by ketchup & mayonnaise as dips.

- Idea Special Veg Pizza
The pizza was a bit of disappointment as the base sauce lacked flavors. As a result, the pizza tasted flat. However, the toppings of assorted Olives, American Corn, Pineapple & Capsicum were found to be fresh. The pizza was nicely baked with a generous amount of cheese on top but, the lack of punch in the base sauce couldn't be made up for. Has scope of improvement.

- Veg Mixed Sauce Pasta
Slightly under-boiled pasta (penne) tossed in an imbalance of Arrabbiata & Bechamél Sauce made up the dish. Due to the imbalance, the rose pink color of the Primavera (mixed) sauce was missed. The Arrabbiata sauce lacked the tanginess it should have, resulting in the overpowering of the creamy texture of the Bechamel sauce making the dish too cheesy for the liking. The pasta as a whole was slightly under-seasoned and was found to have a decent scope of improvement.

- Brownie with Ice-cream
The dessert failed to impress. The plain brownies were stiff, cold & too sweet. Replacing the plain ones for the walnut ones and serving them hot would help re-create this dish in a much better manner. The ice-cream served on top of the brownie was a melted form of a quenelle. Serving it either as a scoop or as a quenelle wouldn't affect much till the time the ice-cream is frozen.
Presented with a generous drizzle of chocolate sauce was nice but, a warmer drizzle would have been much appreciated. Hope the dish is worked upon and the ending is a happy one. 

• The SHEESHA was found to be smoky and lasted long.

The STAFF conduct was found to be polite and friendly. A shoutout to Asif who catered the customers in the best possible way! Looking at the bigger frame, the staff needs training and also needs to be more welcoming.
The SERVICE is somewhat slow and needs to be worked upon.

The PRICES were found to be inclined towards a reasonable end.

Overall, the experience was nice. 
- Being a new startup, one needs time to settle. This place has a great scope and can do much better in the coming days!
Hope to see An 'improved' Idea soon.

Finding this cafe is very easy because its exactly the opposite of Haji Saheb restaurant  in Park Circus Area...But entering the cafe is a bit tricky somewhat :p.... You need to cross all the muds and stones lying just near the entrance carefully as the KMC work is in progress.... 

Anyways coming back to the cafe, the place looks nice and filled with frames, paintings, etc... The walls are written with quotes... Staffs working here are polite and attentive.... Ground floor is spacious with sofas and chairs... They have a big projector and the best thing about this is you can connect the projector with your mobile phone and when doing  anything on your phone, it displays onto the projector...one can tease his/her friend's by saying "tu mera yeh kaam karde warna tera secret or embarassng photos/videos ko projector mai dikha denge abhi" :p fir kya bechare ko manna hi padega...

For a sports lover like me, my adda is always the first floor because its more comfortable watching the match like being on the balcony of a theatre :D 

V asked for one HOOKAH Pan Thunder flavor.. (hookah was okaay typs)... 

V had their own recipe An idea VEG PIZZA...(pizza was very delicious and well cooked... It was filled with cheese.. The cheese were rolling down on my lips while eating....i loved it... Many people doesn't bother about what  quality tomato sauce its being served with.... But sauce plays a very important role in the taste of pizza, burgers and all in your mouth.... An idea serves the best sauce along with pizza)..

V also had BROWNIE served with vanilla ice cream and dipped in chocolate sauce... ( brownies were a little on the harder side while cutting but the ice cream and chocolate sauce together makes it a perfect taste into the mouth no doubt.... Its nice... 

Lastly v had LEMON ICE TEA..... The taste was just so good.... Everything was well mixed to the right proportion... 

AN IDEA is definitely a nice and suitable spot for sports lover in a pocket friendly way...!

Starting with the bags n loads f garbage which is almost near its entrance will make u feel so not good!!Next coming to the place itself.... the first impression u get will b good only coz the interiors is nt so bad.Inspiration quotes on walls are always good. Coming to the food!Disgusting in one word. Although its nt good to tag so harsh words but really wish could hve helped. Ask food ask drinks all the same and not that its vei much on the economical side,quite standard price and below average stuffs.

[Intro]
Café is always a good option for passing time over a cup of coffee.but now a days a café not only serves coffees,they have plenty of foods, drinks collections.which is a good change.this particular joint is like that.went for a food tasting event.place is quite good divided in two parts one is ground floor section and another one is first floor section.ground floor section consist with sofas chairs along with tables.every corner there is a story even in the cling too.various types of caption. The wall I really licked 3 business persons chatting over a topic and having coffee.different types of captions,you can enjoy live sports of movies through the projectors.you can  enjoy musics too,the way they managed the place brilliant.
[Location]
This place is located a lane towards minto park.if you're coming from park circus cross the bridge walk 2 mins just opposite off haji saheb.better use google map.but it's not that hard to find it out.
[Ambience n Interior]
First of all ambience was good.walls classy touched by the white paints and it's like bricks sequence.sofas very comfortable,I love the concept separate place and every chair tables and sofas very far from the other one.music little laud,but otherwise the ambience was ok.both the floors interiors were good.
[Drinks]
1. Mango smoothie - one of my favorite. Last time I tried it was very much sweet.but have to say really good one.very much thik,not liquidish.the flavour you can smell while drinking.
2. Green apple soda - the drink decoration to taste just perfect.mixed with ice cubes with cutted lemons inside.taste was really good,lovely drink.you have to try this one,or else you'll miss a good one.
3. Blue lagoon - this one consist with crushed ice mixed with lemon juice.taste wise good,smooth ice crushed well.

That horrible situation of being stuck at Park Circus with friends, with the only option to hang out being the very family friendly Biriyani-Mughlai restaurants, now has a solution, which is An Idea. This lovely café has newly opened , just opposite to Haji Saheb, near Meher Ali Road crossing, away from the hustle and bustle of the Park Circus Traffic.

I was invited here with Team Panchphoron for a food tasting session. An Idea is quite spacious, and spread over two floors. While both the floors are well decorated with multicolored posters and photo frames with inspiring quotes, it is the first floor which sort of gives a more cosy feel , and is more suitable for romantic dine out. The seats are cushioned and comfortable. We got seated in the ground floor. I liked the idea of placing the seats at a good distance from one another which will not hamper the privacy of the customers. Also, it was good to find that the cafe hasn't made the most out of its space and has focused mainly on the comfort of its customers.

We were served with gum flavoured hookah which I didn’t have, but my fellow foodies loved it.

Since it is a café, we sampled a wide range of mocktails:

1.	Blue Lagoon – This was a really refreshing drink. Made on soda base, it was slightly frothy and citrus in flavour, with a kick of lime.

2.	Mango Smoothie – Even though this drink was made out of rich Mango Puree mixed with milk, it wasn’t too sweet, just the way I like it. However, the ice cubes weren’t crushed properly when mixed to the drink, making the texture coarse, and difficult to sip with a straw or otherwise.

3.	Green Apple Lemonade – My favourite among all the mocktails here, the subtle green apple essence gave the drink a new dimension. This is a perfect drink for a summertime hangout.

4.	Ice Frappe - The drink was slightly watery and tasted average. Also, the vanilla ice cream topping wasn't a proper scoop. So, it was poor in terms of presentation too.

5.	Masala Lemonade - The masala lemonade was also good and tangy with masala and lime.

We were also served hot chocolate, in the hot drinks category, which was pretty rich, think and welcoming.

We then moved on to the burger and sandwiches section, where we sampled a variety of them. Among burgers, we had egg fried burger, veg burger, chicken burger and chicken cheese burger. All of the burgers were brilliant. The bun was soft and the patty was well-seasoned, soft and moist. The egg fried burger came with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg, and the chicken cheese burger had a layer of cheese. All the burgers came with tomatoes and lettuce to add some freshness to the protein bases, and were generously drizzled with spicy mayonnaise dip.

Next we had sunny side chicken club sandwich and veg sandwich. Again, both were brilliant. The stuffing of the chicken sandwich with a layer of chicken sandwiched between two layers of egg was heavenly - one of the best sandwiches I had till date. The veg sandwich was stuffed with mashed potato, tomato, onions, etc.

Unlike the Burgers and Sandwiches, the pizzas didn’t impress us as much. The tandoori chicken pizza was not so well made. The crust was thick and dry. Also, the topping had generous chunks of chicken but the taste was average. However, An idea special veg pizza, which we had next, was better than the chicken pizza. The crust was well baked and not as hard and dry as the earlier one. It was topped with cheese, pineapple, corn, olives and other veggies which tasted good.

The next dish was mix sauce pasta. This was good except for the fact that the penne needed to be a little more boiled and the sauces were not mixed properly in the entire pasta. Overall, it was a good dish but our expectations were a little high after having the burgers and sandwiches.

Crispy chilli chicken was presented to us in a very typical way which didn't appeal to any of us. The dish tasted average as the chicken was crisp from outside but dry from inside.

To end our meal, we had brownie with chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. This was the most disappointing part of the meal ! The brownie tasted very poor and was not at all hot as it should have been. Neither was the chocolate sauce hot. The vanilla ice cream scoop at the top was again in the form of a chunk and not a proper scoop.

We had a good time but there are a few areas which need a bit of work. The music was too loud. Also, the staff was too miser in providing napkins. Overall, the place has scope for much improvement. Some of the dishes like drinks, burgers and sandwiches were brilliant. The pizza, pasta and the brownie were average and hence need improvement. Also, incorporating some more dessert options in the menu apart from brownie would be beneficial.

A new café in the city named "An Idea". It's located at Park circus, exactly opposite to Haji Saheb at circus avenue and 2-3 minutes walk from seven point crossing. I was invited to the cafe through 'panch phoron' group. It was a food tasting session on a weekday evening.
    It is an easy find ofcourse but now the entrance is a bit congested due to KMC work.

    The interior is spacious enough with white walls and white tiled floor which soothe your eyes and mind. The colorful ceiling and few quotes on walls here and there breaks the monotony and it will keep you busy. Speedy numbers were being played. It has two floors. The upper one is smaller and very cozy. It is more colorful too. The sofas and chairs were comfortable. It can accommodate around 24-26 people at a time.

  The café serves hookah too but since I don't take hookah, i skipped it.

   First of all, we were served with drinks. We tasted-- Blue lagoon, Mango smoothie, Ice frappe, Green apple lemonade, Ice frappe, Hot chocolate, Masala lemonade.
   Blue lagoon was refreshing with a dash of sourness.
    Mango smoothie was a bit thick, sweet with crushed ice and mango pieces and of course a must have during hot summer.
    Ice frappe served with a scoop of ice cream was not that good. It didn't have right consistency and was too thin and the flavour didn't come out properly.
     Green apple lemonade was again a thumbs up for me. It was tangy, cool and thirst-quenching. 
      Hot chocolate was really good with chocolate sauce on top of it having right consistency. was warm and the aroma and taste will provide comfort on chilly winter.
      Masala lemonade was as usual good and a bit tangy mixed with jal jeera.

   Next we had-- Egg fried burger, Veg burger, Chicken cheese burger, Chicken burger, Sunny side chicken club sandwich, Veg sandwich,Chicken tandoori pizza,An Idea special veg pizza, Crispy chilli chicken, Mixed sauce pasta.
    Egg fried burger was stuffed with aloo (potato) patty and poached egg, cheese and mayonnaise and lettuce. The bread was soft and the whole thing tasted great.
    Veg burger was stuffed with aloo patty,tomatoes, cucumbers,onions and lettuce with mayonnaise and again was great(though veg).
    Chicken cheese burger was stuffed with chicken patty, cheese,lettuce, cucumber and was amazing in taste though slightly salty.
    Chicken burger was good too. It was simple yet awesome.
     Sunny side chicken club sandwich had two stuffings with three layers served with mayonnaise and tomato ketch up.One stuffing was with chicken whereas another one with egg and was delicious though I missed the crisp of toast.
      Veg sandwich was stuffed with onions, tomatoes and cucumbers. Here I loved the crispness and served with mayonnaise and tomato ketch up. It tasted decent.
      Chicken tandoori pizza couldn't impress me much. The crust was thick but hard as a result of which I had to chew hard though and tasted average.
      An Idea special veg pizza was good topped with corns,capsicums,black olives. The crust was soft enough and yummy.
      Crispy chilli chicken was crispy,spicy and tasted good but i didn't like the presentation. 
      Mixed sauce pasta was a thumbs up for me. The blend of sauces was well proportional. Penne need to be boiled a bit more so that it could have been melted in mouth. But the taste was nice.

   For dessert, we had brownie with ice cream. Brownie was cold and as a result it was hard. So it could have been tasted better.
   
   Food and drinks are reasonably priced and service is fast enough.

The place looks good but no i didn't like it. The wifi doesn't work. I had oreo shake here and believe me the oreo shake found on the small street juice shops is wayyyyy better. So no I wouldn't visit again. Guys please improve the quality.

Located in AJC bose rd near hai saheb this is newly opened outlet is real good.

its a 2 floored cafe,with a nice seating arrangement and quirky wall and ceiling decor and ample space around alongside a big screen to go with ,which I think should be used to screen sports to bring in more clientele.

I tried the combo of Pizza(veg is normally served in the combo, for non-veg 30 INR extra is charged) +Soup+Soft drink along with brownie.

The pizza was nice ,thin crust with a nice layer of cheese and toppings,but the soup was a sadly a disaster,was more of a curry than soup and too much oil quotient, Coming to the brownie,ice cream wasn't available alongside thus we stuck to chocolate.The brownie was on the softer side and not warm,it was not bad but ok. 

Service wise they are real good and wi-fi is also available.Since its opened up very recently I'm expecting the food quality to go up.

Its easy on the pocket aswl.TO ZOMATO please update that NON-VEG food is also available here.

Have visited them twice now. Good open ambience. Quality music. Food menu is good. Tried their chicken sandwich and cold coffee once and a combo meal (veg sandwich, omlette, fries, orange juice - Rs 130) the other time, both being good in taste.
