When my wife and I walked into Aliah Restaurant, Park Circus last evening, the place looked about 60% full. Ahhh, we both thought, finally a place we wouldn't have to wait endlessly for our food, it being Christmas Eve.

More than 10 minutes had elapsed and there was absolutely no show of any service. No one even showed the slightest inclination to take our orders. Was serving a table of two, quite beneath their dignity? Or perhaps, was the establishment busier than it seemed?

In any case, we decided we'd had about enough of their welcome and hospitality and made a beeline for the door.

Not even the man at the counter had the courtesy or training, to enquire what the matter was. For a 62 year old, this was a novel experience, indeed.
