Not so good.
You can get other sweetmeat shops in the same place, with better taste at the same price. They do not  make the sweets tasty nor the snacks are of that good quality

This sweet shop located on College Street, just opposite to the Medical College. There is nothing out of the box one will find here, however it carries on its business well because of the people coming from over all the corners of the state to treat their patients finds this as a place to sit and have something.

Judging from the fact that, it has been rated by Kolkata-ians, 2.9 star ratings for it is pretty high. There isn't anything good this shops provides except ofcourse the 'Balusahi' tastes well. As it is evident from pictures, ice creams of Kwality Walls as well as soft drinks are available making it a handy place.

New College Sweets is just opposite of Medical College between gate 3 and 2. They serve regular sweets that all sweet store sells. Each of their sweets are good in taste. Prices are also very less. Ranges from Rs.5-10. Nothing much special to mention about. They also sell Kochuri for Rs.5 a piece.
College Sweets also sells ice cream, the have a small counter infront to do so.

This shop is located on college street opposite Medical college,kolkata. So I often visit this place to satisfy my sugar cravings. The sweets they sell are good at taste . But the thing I don't like about this place is lack of hygiene. The price is not high.

This shop is just near my hostel and I keep visiting this place almost everyday, if not for sweets but for Cold Drinks and Ice cream.
They have a good collection of Sweets which are of good standard. Most of them are priced at Rs.5 and they taste good. They also keep curd (misti and tok) both.

Kalash Sweets also have a good collection of Ice cream and Soft Drinks.

Another addition to the list of sweet shops in this area. Been here a couple of times when I got bored with the popular ones. A standard sweet shop with basic offerings. Tried a couple of their sweets which was decent.  They maintain good quality and hasn't compromised over the course of time. The staffs are nice with good behavior. Their products are also usually fresh. In short another good option to try out if you are in and around College Street.
