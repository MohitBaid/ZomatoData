[REVIEW]
Ordered one of them special thalis one fine morning.
I was a little bummed to see their avg delivery time. But thankfully, the food came 30 min early. Everything was well packaged and I found this extra container which had 5 Gulab Jamuns #ZomatoTreats. 

My thali had:
3 Ghee Tawa Rotis, 2 Parathas, 1 Paneer Masala, 1 Chicken Kassa, 1 Mutton Kassa, Pulao, Sabji, 2 Sweets, Boondi Raita, Sliced Onions,  Achar, Jaljeera, Mouth Freshener, a Pop Up Towel

The thali was very appealing to the eye but in terms of taste, it was more on the average side. 
The paneer was slightly bland though. 
And the pulao wasn't all that great.
However, the kassas and Parathas were really tasty.
And, I loved the sweets.

From here we ordered biriyani of 1.6kg.
There's no doubt regarding quantity and quality of food but for 1.6kg of biriyani if we could have get 1 more piece of chicken then it would have been nice.
The biriyani really taste good no doubt in it and as well as bondi rayta too.

What made me click on their page was the name. I was curious about the whole selling food by the kilogram thing. 

We ordered 3 things: butter masala chicken, boondi raita and parathas. 

The food was simple and very nice for a weekday meal when you want something a little more fancy than home food but with the same familiarity of a warm meal. 

The parathas weren‚Äôt as crisp as the menu stated though. 

Zomato gave me a crazy wait time, over 2.5 hours. The restaurant got in touch immediately after the order was placed and gave me the real waiting estimate which wasn‚Äôt too unfair. 

Wouldn‚Äôt not recommend. It‚Äôs simple food, cooked well and more than affordable. Quantity need not be mentioned I guess. 

;)

Tried mutton thali for the first time from KIFO via Zomato . Received the food parcel before the scheduled time and that too with a good gesture from well mannered delivery man. Now coming to the mutton thali, it contained Two parathas nicely prepared in less oil, the polao portion was sufficient for an individual and lastly the mutton pieces were juicy and not at all rich that reminds one of home cooked mutton recipe. Moreover, it was pocket friendly and yummy keeping in mind the health factor. Definitely bookmarking it for special occasions next time. Kudos KIFO and keep delivering the warmth of good food in future too!üëçüëçüëçüëçüëåüëåüëå‚úå‚úå‚úå‚úå

I ordered for the first time at this place. I ordered Kifo Special Thalia via zomato which costed Rs 270. The delivery was on time. The packaging was very good. The quantity and quality of the food was also good. The thali consisted of Rice, Roti , Paratha, Mutton , Chicken , Paneer , Potato , Raita, Salad, Sweets , Mouth Freshener, Pickle and spoon & Napkin. The best what we can get at Rs 270. I was little disappointed because the chicken, mutton , paneer and Potato were not hot at all, not even a little bit. The paratha and Roti were hot. The rice tasted very good. It had a nice smell.  The taste of the food was good , not at all disappointing. 
Food Quantity & Quality : 3.5/5
Packaging and Presentation : 4/5
Value for Money : 4/5
Overall Experience : 4/5.
I will suggest them to remove either mutton or paneer or aloo and add dal instead of it. 
Would definitely like to order again. 
Thank You for your service. 
Keep Up The Good Work.
Happy Eating.

Ordered for Kifo's special thali, which was enough for 2. Each and every preparation was well prepared and up to the mark. Pretty cheap given that i got 2 pieces of Chicken, 2 pieces of Mutton, Paneer butter masala, alu dum, 2 ghee brushed roti, 2 Paratha, pulao(my favorite of the lot, extremely lightly cooked and well balanced in terms of flavor) bundi raita, badminton papad, salad and 2 gulab jamun. I think the gulab jamun could have been better if it were more fresh or soft and warm. I got all this in 270rs only(tax/delivery/packing included) which is pretty cheap.
All in all i would recommend everyone to have thali from Kifo because it's pocket friendly, tastes good and not too spicy.

Last week, I got to know about this place and decided to give it a try. I called for 2 Chicken Executive Thali and 5 pieces of Gulab jamun. The person who confirmed the order on call was very helpful and polite.The food was nicely packed. The price is reasonable. The quantity of one thali is enough for a single person and the quality of the food was also very good.

I ordered a mutton thali which costs around 250/-. The whole meal consists of a basmati pulao, mutton(4pc.s), 2 khasta paratha, aachar and a salad.
I must say it was a great experience overall, the food was tasty(basmati pulao was the best one) and budget friendly too. Coming to quantity the quantity was also good enough for 1 person.
Packing: Hygenic.
Delivery: I got my meal within an hour.
Behaviour: Staff's behaviour is also a plus point.

Kifo to you also- plz make the food little bit more delicious and yeah less oil.

Price was ok quantity is good only thing which you need to work on is Bharwa Aloo which was only half cooked and also not having proper taste.One more thing Gajar Ka Halwa should be more sweet i think more of sugar was less in it.Hope these can be resolve . Bharwa Aloo was a waste of money. Rest food was still good to eat. I liked you panner butter masala.

If you are tired of cooking and having food ordered from restaurant which are too spicy, this is the place you need to get your food from.The food is exactly like home-cooked meals, without spice and less oil.You'll like it if you're looking for a light yet non-veg meal but not if you're expecting restuarant type rich food.

Disappointing.
Food - 2.5 Delivery -3(considered)

Delivery takes 3 hrs, and on top of it, it was more 10 mins late tho delivery man apologized so can't really complain. Yet 3 hrs is lot of time.

Food, I had ordered chicken chap and laccha parathas with Zomato treat gulab jamuns.
-Chicken chap was average by taste and awful for health. As they have used atar (I guess) and a lot and lot of oil (which made it unhealthy). It was literally dipped into oil, and the chicken pieces weren't tender. However, taste was average.
-Laccha parathas : There were no laccha on parathas, just simple parathas with not much huge size tho can't complain about quantity at rs 8, but there were no LACCHA!
-Zomato treats gulab jamun - Mentioned 5 peice worth 75, i.e., 15/- rs per peice, was nothing extra ordinary in term of size or taste, just like rs 6-7 u get in roadside shop and ALSO IT GAVE ONLY 4PEICE INSTEAD OF 5! (Which was mentioned 5 pieces).

Overall Comment, food is good for quantity of people just like caterers, not healthy for home eats!
Disappointing because of how it got so much rating with this food, ruined all the excitement!

After hearing a lot about this outlet and the reviews from people, I decided to try for once.I decided to order the mutton biriyani, but they told me it was unavailable at that particular time, so instead went for the Chicken Biriyani, egg biriyani and mutton kasa. Well to be honest the quality was good and the quantity of the biriyanis were huge, enough for 4-5 people.Mutton kasa was tasty too, along with soft and juicy 10-12 pieces of mutton. Pocket pinch was 1020‚Çπ. Packaging was excellent and the delivery was courteous.Will definitely order again.

Had heard a lot about this outlet.. Decided to give it a go for their executive Thalis, which unfortunately weren't available on that particular day. Ordered Chicken Pakoras, got a call from the outlet stating the estimated delivery time, which was about two and half hours.. The person on phone was extremely courteous, the food got delivered within the estimated time, so far so good.
Coming to food, as I've had ordered only one particular item (it was my 'home alone' night), I can say the quantity was sufficient and quality was decent enough. Again, got a call from the outlet after delivery enquiring whether the food has been delivered or not, which was very much appreciated.

Had been hearing a lot about these guys over the past few months.. so finally decided to try them out. As i placed the order on zomato i was somewhat surprised at the 180 min wait time. However on call the person on the other end promised to deliver within an hour and a half. 
To cut things short, the wait time was indeed nearly 3 hours.
However, as mr jaiswal had promised over the phone, their food more than made up for the delay in delivery. As opposed to what i had thought, they didnt put quantity over quality. Their biryani was light and the chicken pieces, succulent. If they had indeed delivered within 1.5 hours then i would have given 5 stars hands down.. 
The next time  you guys order, order at least 3 hours in advance..

Well, some positive word-of-the-mouth about this place compelled me to experiment with them and I ordered a home delivery of their Paw bhaji as well as a gulab jamun family pack. They are perhaps one of their kind in the whole of Kolkata ‚Äì as they trade by the weight i.e. provide food by the kilo and hence thy name ‚Äì KIFO (Kilo foods)!

Some half kg of bhaji along with a dozen pavs as well as 5 medium sized gulab jamuns were delivered to my place after some 3 hours of placing the order. They do charge a few extra pennies in the name of packing (which is justified) ‚Äì although, the delivery service is free! Glad that they served some complimentary sliced onions as well as a Jaljeera pouch!

The pack is sufficient enough to feed 2 hungry bellies but don‚Äôt expect the food to be warm ‚Äì as lead time is too high (which is somewhat justified as they are based out of Kestopur and deliver even to remote areas). Even the delivery lead time displayed on the Zomato online orders section is 175 ‚Äì 180 minutes!

No reservations for taste for both the main course as well as the sweet dish as well as the packing. You can expect a much better pav bhaji from them in winters when availability and variety of vegetables is much much better!

Only thing which perturbs me is the method of delivery ‚Äì the delivery guy did not even have an umbrella and even, rain water was dripping down from the food parcel delivered ‚Äì citing the niggardliness of the management towards the delivery boy as well as the food parcels ‚Äì may be this can be looked into!

Rest all ‚Äì so far so good!

RECOMMENDED!

Ordered chicken masala, roti and boondi raita.
At first was sceptical about ordering, however when had the food oh boy it was tasty.

Chicken masala was tenderly cooked with spices not very hot but was home cooked. Not too much oil.

Roti came with ghee on it. Was soft and hot as well.

And the best one was the boondi raita. Wow that was the best raita had.

As the name suggests kilo, the food comes in kilo formats.

Chicken was 500 gms. Approx 10 medium chunks of chicken.

Raita was also 500 gms. In over all a best place for order.

Kilo have an outlet in Keshtopur, however the restaurant is in airport gate no 1 from where the food is sent to the outlet and from there for delivery.

Ordering from Keshtopur expect a 90 mins delivery. Definitely will try a next order from you.

On a lazy, rainy evening, was just surfing through Zomato to order dinner. Came across Kifo, that had good reviews and was also pocket friendly.
The menu looked tempting as Kifo supplies food by kilo (weight).
Ordered-
1. Dal Makhani - was a total disappointment. Very poor in taste. Priced @ ‚Çπ 175/, the quantity was good, however, the taste was disappointing.
2. Paneer Mix Veg- it was a relief after the disappointment of Dal Makhani. Decent taste, though low on salt, but that is acceptable.
3. Veg Pulao - neatly cooked pulao and tasty was the highlight of the order.
4. Chapati- were also good.

The service was a bit slow, but delivered on time.
Overall a good initiative by Mr. Abhishek who co-ordinated my order to assure good-to-better service.
There are still are a few pockets of improvement.

Ordered a chicken thali for 2 this afternoon. Didn't have much expectations. The delivery was a bit delayed due to bad weather. But when it finally arrived, the behaviour of the delivery person, just won our hearts. He was very polite and apologised very sincerely for the delay. The best part about the food was the way they pack everything  into a Bento-box-ish thali. The food was very good considering the low oil:gravy ratio. The proportion for each item was absolutely on the mark. Complete value for money. The overall experience was way beyond our expectations! Brilliant!! Would definitely be ordering again from this place. Expecting to see more variety of combinations in the thali section...

This place is a new fooding joint in keshtopur and they tend to supply food in accordance with measurements ie grams and kilograms. I had to a board a train from sealdah and surprisingly this outlet came to the rescue in that time of crisis. I had ordered a chicken thali. The food was tasty, not so oily and the quantity was also good. The delivery boy was very courteous and the food packaging system was fabulous. Thumbs up for this new eating joint :)

The mutton in the biriyani was undercooked,hard and bit smelly as well. Overall,the biriyani was a disaster. The quantity of biriyani was enough for 4 people.The chicken thali however was good enough and all the items was pretty good. The delivery was good and very courteous. Will like to order more from their menu except biriyani.

Ordered online mutter paneer and chicken butter masala. Have asked them to make spicy. Below is the feedback.
1. Gravy was same (chicken nd paneer), in looks nd taste. Both are different items and were supposed to be different in taste.
2. Chicken butter masala is supposed to be tomato based gravy, which was not.
3. Both main course items were worst in taste and not spicy.

Hope this review is taken seriously by owners and they improve.

We could tell from the taste that the food was fresh, Healthy and hygienic. Now the Quantity of the food was surprising. It was too much. I had to take a Tub of Polau home.I enjoyed the food very much and am completely satisfied with this Take out. I Recommend everyone to Order from here. I myself am planning to do my next order for a friend's farewell party today.

My parents had to catch an early train and we needed to get the lunch packed. When no other outlets provided delivery options, KIFO came to the rescue. Not only did they deliver the food early but they made sure the food reached us in the best possible manner.
The owner of this outlet is very hospitable and so are the staffs.

Coming to the food, we ordered Corporate chicken thali (pack of 2). The food was beautifully packed, no spilling or intermingling of gravy. Each thali consists of Basmati pulaw, 3 rotis, sabji, boondi raita, 2 pieces of chicken, chutney, a sweet, salad, papad, mouth fresher and jaljeera.

The food per thali is more than enough for one happy stomach and will actually relish your taste buds.

Would I order from here again? Oh YES!

Was hesitating a bit at first but got a call immediately as I ordered. Half Kilo of Chicken Biriyani and Half ¬†a Kilo of Chicken Chap. Inspite of Monday having their half day the food arrived right on time as promised. The person who delivered was a very nice person. I was blown away by his respect shown to me.Nevertheless the food was very neatly packed in the container and was hot.Taste buds were tingling. Fingers were crossed.
And I got the best of the ordered food stuff. Awesome aroma.Awesome taste. Perfect balance of oil. No chip-chip. The rice was of good quality and the Chicken was perfectly cooked. The chap was not slimy but was hard enough to go with the Biriyani with perfection. The smell of the chap was really good.
Thank you KIFO

ps: The smiley made on each container by hand was so sweet.

Had ordered 2 thali for lunch. Food quality is very good and cheaper. After long time,its found quality food in Kestopur . No extra oil, no extra spice,  which are usually provided by others restaurant of Kestopur.it's a good sign. Delivery is also in time and behavior of delivery person also good. 

Suggestion : I think as summer begins, plain rice in thali will be more preferable/acceptable by people.
Wish you all good luck .. Will order again....

I really appreciate the concept of this restaurant and their service is commendable. 1st order-Half kg chicken masala. It was very well packed,no leaking of oil from gravy.It had some 10-12 pieces of chicken in it,which is enough for 3-4 people.Taste of the curry was yum it had more like home cooked flavours. The delivery was quick too.

2nd order-So all of my family members were tired after pandal hopping so we decided to order our lunch from kifo.We ordered 2 chicken thali and 1 kifo special thali.As it was dashami the delivery was bit delayed due to heavy demand but that's perfectly fine because the food was great. The 3 thali was enough for 4 people. Despite of heavy orders they maintained their quality. All the items were tasty.And they packed it so well.My favourite from the thali was basmati pulao,chicken curry,khasta paratha and gulab jamun.
I would love to order from kifo again and again.

Reliable restaurant when you have guest in your home or you don't want to cook anything. Kudos to you. Many more orders arriving your way.

This place provides food on kilo basis also provides thalis. They only deliver food. Well ordered non veg executive Thali, minimum 2 thalis compulsory. The food was packed in airtight plastic thalis. The Basmati Pulao was very nicely prepared and very colorful and aromatic. The aloo Dish was amazingly cooked very tasty only if the quantity would had been more, nevertheless. In salad cucumber, Onion and lemon piece was available. 3 pieces of Roti was provided which was soft. Tomato chutney was sweet and exceeded expectations. The Raita was a waste, the curd was old and smelling bad!!!!! The only hickup in the entire Thali. Packet of Jaljeera and Pass pass were provided as miuthfreshner. For sweet Dish gulab jamun was provided. The Chicken Curry waz provided in a different container and contained 2 medium piece of Chicken. If only the chicken piece would have good parts other than breast pieces. Overall good customer service they do follow up with customers. Would try there other delicacies soon.

The packaging is neat , food quality is good and fresh and quite tasty. And the best part about the thali was , the small pouch of achar, tomato chutney and mouth freshener. It's so cute and thoughtful. 
I would definitely order again from them.

So placed order for paneer executive thali, within minutes got a call from them regarding delivery time & confirmation of address. And bang on time the food arrived well packed with the delivery guy bidding namaste in traditional style.
Food is delicious I felt the sabzi should be a bit more in quantity 0.5 less for that. Just a homely feeling very good for office goers and p.g people I say. Will order again for sure.

Had order non-veg thali from here.

With excellent food quality i must say they are very particular regarding delivery time.

They just provide within 1hr where expected time of delivery was 3hrs.

Definitely try this one if you have guests over. Unique concept.
pros- mouthwatering food, efficient packaging , polite staff and on time delivery.cons- not for people who live alone (as they don't deliver single serving ), and some of the items are unnecessary.such as chutney and parathas in a chinese thali. ( so the only con is that they give so much extra food , which is not negative at all) :)overall, very nice and polite staff. The food was more than enough for two people and was lipsmacking as well.¬†Loved the khasta parathas . would definitely order again.

Food quality and quantity is very satisfactory. Less spicy and awesome taste. High five to kifo... Timely service, good behaviour, great food... must order. Their current location is Park Street . Kudos KIFO.

An awesome service for people looking for a taste of home.

I had gone through many  home cooks mention that they are serving Bengali, Punjabi, Tamil Brahmin food and quote a price that suits them but KIFO was BEST.... It would have been much better if they serve for one if possible.

Ordered for the first time and found that the food was very good in terms of quality and quantity. Reasonably priced. All the items ordered were freshly cooked and had a distinct taste and flavour.

Have not tried the deserts yet.

It was rainy time and timid cold . We ordered mutton kasa and the kasa was very very delicious the upper topping of ghee and cloves was dreadfully tasty and the mutton was very soft and the joinment of the fried masalas cannot be classified

We ordered food from this place after getting some very good references. Delighted to share the entire range that we ordered from starters to Mains was an absolute hit. Delicious, generous and neatly packed and delivered. We had a large set of people and everyone liked the food. Well done kifoteam.

TIme and again we have ordered food from this place for most condescending of our guests.. and all we have heard is good things! Besides being value for money, kifo has a varied multi cuisine to suit everyone's palate and pocket. If you are expecting the authenticity of the dishes to be of gourmet standard, please don't because even the best of chefs cannot churn out authentic dishes at this costing. Having said this, the kitchen team at kifo has tried to keep the food tasty and wholesome and very easy on the palate. Kudos to team kifo for coming to our rescue in hosting cosy and grand parties in the comfort of our homes!!!
