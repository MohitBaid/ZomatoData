Ordered via swiggy, the food was good, and the delivery was quick as well. One of the best thing about this place is the price, value for money in all respects. Fish n chips could've been better though.

ordered via swiggy a while back.
Ordered: 1 Veg Burger @ 39/- & 1 Corn Toast @49/-
Veg Burger: Was quite good & really soft. The patty was crisp inside, the bun was fresh & the taste was really good. @ 39/- I think, it is a steal :-)

Corn Toast: Well to be honest, I wasnt expecting it to be so good as it turned out to be. full of 3 colour bell peppers, sliced cheese & a hint of mixed herbs, made it work wonders. I am impressed with this particular item.

All in all, Chicken @ Mirch Masala, worked wonders for me, as I was really hungry & was expecting some good food for me in less price. Its really pocket friendly & the food they served was paisa wasool as of now.
RECOMMENDED :-)
