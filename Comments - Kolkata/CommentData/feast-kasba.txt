I m a regular at feast.  We basically order in. Our most  ordered dishes are chilly chicken and fried rice.  Sometime laccha paratha too. One of the most popular joints in kasba.  Rolls are very famous here. The quantity is alot n its pocket friendly.  Located just by the road it gives tough competition to alot of nearby joints. Pan fried momo and steam momo are just amazing n quality n quantity both are amazing 😊😊 must visit! Biryani is nothing like outstanding or something but its good. I hv been eating there since ages.

This is a small joint for take away, ideally. I have always had their rolls, which are good in size and taste. For which this place has better offerings.

It used to be a decent food outlet once. But over the last few weeks the quality of food has degraded much. Ordered Chicken Biryani, chicken schewzwan fried rice and dry chili chicken from this place today. The fried rice was bland, the sauce wasn't mixed or added properly. The Biryani was too light for my liking. And the dry chili chicken was below average compared to feast standards. Utterly disappointed!

A small fast food outlet serving delicious & extraordinary food. From rolls to momos, they offer a various fast food on the go. Their rolls deserve a special mention. They are humongous and almost difficult for one person to finish. Their parathas are really soft and also the quantity of the filling is a lot.

They provide with great quality food and the prices are extremely cheap and reasonable. Perfect place for students to order or takeaway.

Though the place can be a little more cleaner than what it appears. Also their rumali roti and chicken tadka are absolutely scrumptious. Their food quality and quantity has gained them their popularity but the ambience needs a lot of improvement.

Food : 5/5
Ambience : 2/5

This place isn't a restaurant but you can buy food from here. If you're interested in street food then you can step in here. The ambience isn't very great but the food is pretty tasty. Price is also cheap. They maintain quality and quantity since years. Try once maybe?!

If you are super hungry and in the mood for street food then head over to Feast. Feast has MASSIVE rolls and they are super tasty. There is some magic in their parantha and filling plus its huge. Their rolls are very popular. 

Their rumali roti and chicken bharta is also very tastey. In fact one of the best chicken bhartas I have had. 

But its a small place. Just for takeaway. Not fancy at all. Perfect for a drop when you are on the go.

Situated just beside Bosepukur auto-stand in Kasba the place is quite convenient to reach via bus or auto.

The first impression by looking at it from outside was like averagely decent! Not good definitely but not the worst.

They have quite a lot of food in menu. Ordered Chicken Fried Momo. It came 8 pieces with a good amount of red chilli pickle and the price was ₹130 which I think is really affordable.
Now the momos were very very very crispy. I mean a bit more than you're usually accustomed with fried momos. But I liked that extra crisp, maybe some people who doesn't like much oily would not be very happy with the extra crisp though. The taste was astonishingly good! Really good. I didn't expect those momos to be this well in taste & the red chilli pickle just stole my heart! It was spicey and sour! If you like chilies you'll love it too!


Overall the place was ok. The food was good but the interior doesn't look much hyeginic. And flies were all around. That's the biggest con I'd say but yeah the food what matters. So the rating is completely for the food and 0 for the ambience.

It is located near bosepukur petrol pump. It is a small eatery which remains crowded almost every day. The eatery has 2/3 table options so it is a better option for takeaway. There rolls are huge and it comes with a lots of fillings. I have had their egg, chicken, egg chicken, and mutton roll. Tadkas are also good.

Food quality is just up to the mark. But the problem is about the dine-in facility. I am a regular customer of this outlet. But sometimes I cannot manage my seat during lunch hour. They have just a single 4-seater table. Sometimes they refuse to deliver food to my office as well. They have to upgrade themselves at first. Thanks.

This place is quite old. Earlier it used to serve both Indian and Chinese food, but in the middle the stopped making indian. So as of now, I am only aware of their chinese preperations. There was a time, when their food was extremely satisfying and true to its prices, but now it's no more so. The taste of their food is more on the sweeter side, the side dishes are very high in corn starch, the rice and noodle dishes are okayish and very oily. However, what bothers me the most is that even their soups have a lot of oil. But nonetheless, their szechwan rice and noodle and chilli chicken is really nice. All over, it's a good place for takeouts.

A well-known joint for take aways and home deliveries. Efficient service for home delivery is rendered only when the order is given 2-3 hours prior to the delivery time. Otherwise, an hour's wait is positive. Now coming to the food, the quality and quantity of the food both are satisfying. The mixed Cantonese noodles is a must try. Accurate pieces of chicken, prawn and veggies are added. For all those staying nearby, could definitely order from this place. Disappointment is rare here. Shireen Seddon

Rating this place just for their delicious and humongous rolls.
Located near bosepukur petrol pump, this joint used to serve just rolls and chowmein for snacks but now they have upgraded to many more varieties.
The rolls are huge and a tad bit oily. Lots of fillings and the laccha paratha used as base is very big. I have had their egg, chicken, egg chicken and double egg double chicken rolls. All varities are good but the double egg double chicken will make u feel uncomfortable due to its size. Taste wise it is above average but the chicken fillings are nice.
A tad bit costly. Must try 1ce if u are in kasba area.

Just opposite to the Petrol Pump in Bosepukur, lies this small eatery which remains crowded almost throughout the day.

It's one of the oldest eateries in Kasba and with time they have improved for the better. 
Feast started as a basic shop selling Rolls but eventually they widened their menu and now offers a mix of both Chinese and North Indian (with a touch of Bengali). The eatery has just 3 tables so it's a better option to opt for a takeaway. 

The owner of the shop is the only one taking the orders and attending the phone calls from the customers and is very impatient. Also kind of rude to his staff members.😐 By the way, he never smiles and tends to have infinite fold on his forehead throughout the day.

[NOTE : They never provide a proper bill, hence I apologise in advance for not being able to inform you all about the price of each and everything I tried from here.]

Things we have tried :
1)Mutton Roll and Chicken Roll (3.5/5) : The rolls are humongous. One roll can easily stuff you to an extent of not wanting to have dinner. The rolls are very basic with beautifully fried laccha paratha, mutton/chicken, onion lacchas and a squeeze of lemon. Also, ask them to not add any extra sauce if you prefer to have it plain, like I do. 

2)Chicken Tadka and Egg Tadka (4.25/5) : To be honest, I am not a huge fan of dal tadka but I swear by the 'mean' tadka these guys make. The main ingredients are visible and in good quantity too! Both the tadkas are extremely smokey and very tasty! 

3) Mutton Kasha (3.9/5) : A very oily concoction of bangali spices and soft mutton (3-4 normal pieces). Tastes just like home but comes at the cost of some extra calories.

4)'DRY' Chilli Chicken and Dry Chilli fish (4/5) : They use bombay bhetki for the chilli fish. Both the dishes comes with 10 pieces at a very reasonable (rather, cheap) price! Please do remember to go for the dry version because the gravy is kind of watery.

The place is total value for money and can be ordered once in a while when your 'Bangali' gene crave for some bengali chinese and tadka!

Conclusion :-
•Food : 4/5. (Solely Based on what I have tried)
•Quntity : 4/5.
•Value for money : 4/5.

Recommended. ✌🏻
Happy Eating.😁😄

Mostly a takeaway and a delivery joint with a few tables to sit and have your food. Nothing fancy about this place. Just another restaurant serving decent food. It has been there for quite a while and although it was pocket friendly at one point of time,  over the years it has seen quite a hike in prices. Their rolls, mixed fried rice and the momos are the best in their offerings. Good for house parties specially because of the good quantity they serve.

But food was not that bad
And the better thing is they give a lot more quantity/dish than normal shops

So its a place where u wanna buy food when u r broke and want to have chinese 





And menu card isn't updated

This place is the local champ in Bosepukur. It's always crowded and is generally known for its rolls. The rolls are big and will easily suffice 2. My personal favourite is the double egg double chicken roll. It's big and fat, and only one friend of mine has been able to complete it till date except me.
Coming to the other items, the tarka and roomali roti are cheap and in 200 rupees,a family of 5 can easily have dinner. Chilli chicken and fried rice are good enough for their prices.

Located in between Bosepukur sitala mandir and talbagan bus stop, Just opp. to New Kasba Police Station.. Very popular among the local people yes but quality wise a little better than the other fast food centre.. I had tried egg roll once it was okayish just that the egg was not properly fried... and other time we opted for Feast as our budget were tight there were no other option so we ordered for a bulk amount of biriyanis for a special occasion... No complaints with the biriyanis (i.e. budget-friendly biriyanis :P)... and hence Feast proved to be the rescuer... :P

Hosted as a takeaway fast food joint, located at the Ruby-Gariahat connector. This joint is well lit with a Yellow board, quite visible. You will find a queue almost everytime you run into there.
Don't be taken away for the word Chinese, here you get Indian food (Chinese, the Indian way). You will find a variety of rolls here, though just opposite you will find 'Only Alibaba' serving the same. Rolls here aren't bad, you can eat them without any comparisons in mind. The starters are nice, so are the main courses. The dry chilli chicken was nice complimented by some prawn chowmein. Wotta combo!
Just don't get shuffled here, your turn definitely will come even if you aren't nagging. ;)

Feast is one of the small eateries in Kasba just opposite to Only Alibaba. This place is basically a take away joint with only 2-3 tables to sit. They are popular for their rolls as they serve varieties of various rolls. The staffs are not well behaved as you would like them to be. The place is not clean which is a matter of concern and they should look after this. The Chicken Roll which I had today was not up to the mark as I had a lot about this place. A long way to go and lots of improvement needed.

Located just opposite to Bosepukur petrol pump, this place is famous in this area. They do make both Chinese and Indian foods, but is mainly known for their various kinds of rolls. They do make some of the biggest rolls I had till now.
Their double egg double chicken rolls are huge in size and chicken inside tasted very nice. It was oily though, that a negative for them. Price of the rolls seemed fair too comparing with quantity.
It is recommended mainly for take ways as the seating arrangements were not very good. This place was crowded at the time I arrived and their service seemed quick. They makes kebabs on the footpath openly so cleanliness can be a concern.
Overall, if anyone loves Kolkata rolls will surely love to have their rolls.

An outlet located at Bosepukur Talbagan, Feast calls for the mass who loves Kolkata rolls. I did try them quite a few times and did like the size of roll they sell. The Double Egg Double Chicken Roll is by far the biggest I have had in Kolkata. However, the excessive oil makes it difficult to finish it causing a repulsive effect after a few bites. However, the chicken is well cooked and have a good taste !

Good place to have quick bites like chicken or egg roll. They all taste good. Takeaway is preferable as there is no proper or hygienic seating arrangement.

Pocket friendly.
Great quantity.
Great quality.
What else does a student need anyway?
You will never find this place lacking customers, rather you will always have to queue up to get your hands on their massive egg chicken roll.
Out of all the stuff available here, roll overshadows everything else really.
PS. Avoid this place during pujas because the dough they use is pre made and the rolls are kind of hard and chewy.

"feast" the name itself reminds me of the lip smacking briyani and the delicious momos. food is great, so is the quantity. the home delivery and take away options are preferable.

FEAST is the name that comes in our mind when we are in the mood to gorge, whether it's chowmeins, biryanis, parathas, chaanps, any Chinese preparations or even small titbits like rolls, fish-fries, momos, fish-fingers. Since it is located at a stone's throw distance from my house, I just bear the pain of moving out of my house in servant's cap and after reaching there, let our very own Chandan Da take a note of my requirements before it's too late, then just sitting back and relaxing, knowing that my orders are being taken care of. It's not always wise to judge the book by its covers - FEAST may not bear the marks of Peter Cat or Trincas or Bar-B-Q or Magnolia in any aspects, but its delicacies are simply to die for, believe me. Their way of dealing with customers on the basis of serial numbers is the one I admire, although it can be really very painstaking at times when there are huge number of customers during Durga Pujo, Diwali, Christmas, New Year's Eve celebrations or any other occasions. This outlet has normal latency time for deliveries, but as I have already mentioned above, it can be painstakingly high during festivals and revelries. It is highly recommended for a foodie by heart, but not at all for those who are supercilious by nature.

Close to my house. Hence we visit this place whenever in mood of a quick bite. They serve good momos. Much much better than Wow!Momo located just near this place. 8 pieces for 100 bucks. Good deal rather.

Rolls. Too big. Have it in the evening and you wouldn't need dinner. :3

Chicken fried rice is lovely though. 

Extremely pocket friendly..

Feast is a very old food joint and can also called a takeaway joint as there are very limited seating arrangements. This place is making great rolls. One should order the variants of Egg-Chicken Rolls. The diameter of the rolls is on the higher side as compared to most of the restaurants. It can easily serve 2 persons. The chicken inside the rolls are kebabs and the parathas are well fried. Overall if you are paying a visit to Feast, rolls are a must have.

If you are in Kasba then you just cannot miss a treat from Feast. This small restaurant is well known for its good quality food and huge quantity. The price is more or less reasonable and the Rolls are in huge demand. Other than that, their Biriyanis and Momos are quite hot sellers as well. The only grouse is the staff behavior which is quite atrocious. They are not attentive and it takes repeated requests to place an order here.

When we went to check out Bosepukur we managed some food at this joint. Not the first time i had food here, bt this joint has been here since quite a few years now. The recent let down being, they were not serving biryani for some reason but were serving chinese. However i have tried their biryani a few days ago and its properly done, not much oily and chicken pieces were good tender. Last time during pujo my friends and i tried chinese here, food was very tasty. Talking of behaviour of the owner, a very money hungry owner, but what can be said if the food is tasty. The kebab's are not the best. Rolls are good, chinese very good and so is biryani as i have tasted it before, and apart from bad money hungry behavior, another fault being they said to deliver food to nearby location they would charge 30 rupees extra even if their delivery boy uses a cycle to deliver the food. Money hungry bt good food. Kasba te deliver korte food cycle kore tate 30 taka extra charge er ki ache bujhlam na. Even though tax was not charged but most small joints dont charge taxes.

Best freaking biriyani in the entirety of kasba. I repeat, best biriyani in kasba.
Feast also has the nicest rolls. They are big with juicy pieces of very flavourful meat, enough to be a meal in themselves.

I, however , have always been very skeptical about anything else that feast serves. The Chinese is okay, my brother tells me. But that's about it.

Have been a fan of this outlet since childhood.

***Update 11th October , 2015
Visited this Restaurant and the crowd was average. This is the first time I myself went to the shop to bring food. Either someone brought/ I took home delivery during my previous experiences.
One of the worse staff behavior.
The Attendant who takes orders and payment was very rude and is just a man hungry for the payment(your money). With those who had smaller orders( an egg rolls or two) he was shouting "Take out Rs 30 now/Take out Rs 60 right now"*. The one preparing and packing the rolls had given 6 pcs of Paneer in a Paneer roll, he shouted, "Why are you giving so many pieces of Paneer? Reduce it"* . I have never seen such a rude staff and its not at all expected from a resto like FEAST at least. He scolded the delivery boy as he was getting complains about delivery, what the hell is he doing? (the sentences in * were spoken in Bengali"

Orders: 6 Egg Chicken Sheek Kebab Roll
Was prepared within 20 minutes.
Tasted rich and delicious and it was huge and filling as well, the reason FEAST is famous.
rating reduced from 4.0 to 3.5 for rude staff behavior.

*** Updated Review***(OLDER)

My friend decided to give us a treat so we decided to take home delivery from this restaurant.

We ordered

2 Plates of Veg Chowmein( 8/10)

2 Plates of Veg Fried Rice(7/10)

2 Chilli Chicken , one dry , one gravy(8/10)(8/10).

The pocket pinch was just a few bucks higher from other restaurants. Try to avoid 'Dine-in' as you will be a steamed momo by the time you finish your food. Staff is well behaved but the speed of their delivery cannot be predicted. They can take 30 mins, and even 1hr 30mins to deliver, after the order is placed. Luckily, we got it within 45mins. ( We stay within 1 km from this joint)

You should try this restaurant if you are in Kasba. And if you have a tight budget, you can always opt for their huge and Delicious Egg Roll, which and average person cannot finish all by himself and girls would throw half of it.

*** Older Review***

The prices are okay. Food quality is great,quantity is sufficient. Dine-in facility is very bad as the heat of the cooking boils us when we are at the tables so better to stand outside and have. Biriyani is good. Chinese is okay..as China Bite and Hungree takes it away. Side dishes are better in quantity to that of hungree. Their rolls are huge thus you won't get a chance to complain that you're not full after having an Egg roll. Love their Chicken Pakoras(but not happy with the price though) and Fish fingers. We are students so we do demand more in quantity for we cannot afford to buy much due to limited pocket money and savings and we are not born with golden spoons in our mouths.

Fish Fry-It is a big chunky piece of Fish Fry which is nicely spiced and decently priced at Rs.60/- per piece.

Fish Finger- The taste is pretty much like the Fish Fry except the difference in the shape, size and price. It is priced at Rs.140/- for 8 pieces and is great with drinks.

Chilli Fish(Dry)-It tasted absolutely divine as it was hot and spicy and just the way I wanted it. It is priced at Rs.150/- for 10 pieces which is great value for money.

Veg Fried Rice- We ordered 2 portions and they were huge (literally) in quantity.It is good enough for at least 4 per people per portion size. It is priced at Rs. 105/- per plate and way more than good.

Chilli Chicken-It was good both in terms of quantity and taste and was a sure hit priced at Rs.130/-per plate.

Chilli Prawn-This was the best part as it had 10 big Bagda prawns priced at Rs.180/- per plate. Not only was the portion and price great, the taste was equally nice.

Double Egg Roll-It is huge in terms of size as it not only has 2 Eggs but also comes with a filling of spiced potatoes which is good enough for 2 people but again very very decently priced at Rs.35/-  per roll. However, the paratha is pretty heavy(guess because it has to hold the strength of the eggs and the rest of the filling).

Chicken Sheek Kabab-I have tried this in the past and wanted to particularly mention it as it has 22-24 pieces priced at Rs.140/- which is a great accompaniment with drinks.

Some word of caution though, please don’t ask them to make the food extra spicy (in case you like spicy food) since it already is even if you don’t ask them to(I love spicy stuff and hadn’t ask them to make it spicy but it turned out to be perfect for me when I had them). In fact, you can ask them to keep a check on the spice level  if you are not fond of spice (read hot).Also, please refrain from dining inside the store as it is all clumsy filled with noisy customers and a Manager(name unknown) who keeps shouting at the cooks, delivery men and order takers.This place is extremely crowded during the weekends (for home delivery and take aways) so it is a good idea to order in advance if you are pressed for time.

Feast is not one of my favourite take aways though some of their food items are good, like the fish manchurian, chilly fish , fried rice and the chicken tandoori. Overall the hospitality of the staff is not that commendable. Food takes time to be prepared and it remains crowded. For a quick munch of junk food this is a bearable outlet.

You have to try Rolls here if you are visiting Kasba. It's indeed a household name. Good variety of Chinese and Moghlai take away dishes available. The rolls which you get here are different from other roll outlets. The lacchha paratha wrap along with your desired filling is more than  sufficient. I warn you though. It's not a quick bite. One roll is all it takes to fill you for dinner.

Feast is pocket friendly and the 'parar dokan home-delivery fast -food kinds', which is basically the slightly greasy, standardly cooked and seasoned, served in big helpings fast food counter - served quick, and cheap. by that standard, the rolls, fries and biriyani are pretty good. however their standard is not always consistent ( I have had very good rolls to very bad ones rolled in inedibly thick doughed parantha). so if this is your para-r or extended para-r dokan, or your hang out in this area, do drop by and try this.

After being away from Bengal for around 5 years, I did crave for Bengali rolls. Just happened to pass by this joint and felt like trying this Feast.

5 years ago as far as I remember, Feast was not that bad.

NOW,
Cheap - Hell yeah. Its cheap.
Quantity - Fill your tummy whatever roll you choose
Quality - Very Bad. Thick Parathas. Tasteless, no salt, No taste.
Never gonna try this place again for Rolls at least.

I actually wanted a simple mutton roll. But no, they never keep that in the kitchen yet they always have it displayed on the menu.

Update[22/07/2015]: Ordered Paneer Butter Masala from this place for a party. Its bad luck that this place is close to my Home. The worst Paneer Butter Masala on Earth. This place simply deserves to close rather than kill people's appetite. I wish I could rate this place a complete ZERO.

From a decade ago to now, Feast has really increased in its popularity. And I am very sure that is because of the cheap prices. This place has generally been popular for its Biryani and Momo, and those don't disappoint. Apart from those, I've only tried their Chicken Pakoda which was good for the price and Chili Chicken which was huge in its portion but very disbalanced in the sauce and ginger department.

Given its cheap price, you should try it if you stay nearby.

The quantities they serve is really nice! If you have a good diet! They make sure that you are full even if you order a dish! Which gave them a half star extra! Rest the food is above average! I have had chicken chap here( average) , paratha which are really big! Chilly chicken( just the way it should be). A pocket friendly resturaunt which is good for guy living in pg!

Feast is a very pocket friendly joint. The quantity of every item on the menu is enormous. The taste is awesome. This is the place I always order from when my friends are over at my place.  Feast has never disappointed me.

Yesterday we had pan fried chicken momo. Its was very tasty and yummy. Price range is somewhat ok. As a whole food service taste price all comes under your budget. And I must mention that FEAST is One of the OLDEST snacks bar in kasba.

Their dry chili chicken is just too good. If you love spicy food and really juicy pieces of chicken this is the place to be. And they never compromise on the quantity!

Food quality and quantity of feast is really something to be appreciated. Its one of the oldest fast food shops in kasba area. Considering the fact that it is a take -away -only food joint, i think its a bit costly.

Good Biryanis and Rolls. 
But then again why would you want to get food from here when you can pay a little extra and go to Lazeez or Ali Baba on the same Road.
Some of the items here are actually pretty pricey considering the look and feel of the place(its a roadside roll shop).
Having said that it was a pretty popular roll and biryani shop a few years back and it still maintains the same standards with the taste of their food.
You can check it out from time to time, maybe for an occasional snack but there are way better options nearby for almost the same price.

Oh man I have been loving place this place  since my school days. Whenever we friends had a bet we will be like "bhai haar gaya toh Feast se roll dena parega" So, I guess you guys can understand how famous the rolls are. Even the Chinese dishes of this place is good and it doesn't pinch much from your pocket too. But my personal favorite is the Special chicken kabab roll, the chicken just melts into your mouth ^_^ So if you guys are feeling hungry and looking for quick bite then this is the place for you :D

The food is just average( and I mean Just) the quality of the dishes and the ingredients used has deteriorated much compared few months ago... The flavour is okay, so the price charged will be felt on higher side... This is a roadside joint so the feel is like it should be... But the service is good and adds as an highlight here... But the food disappoints... An average experience can be expected...

Feast has become a household name for rolls in Kasba.. Their biriyani is good and tasty, their chowmein is again pretty decent.. The amount they provide is unbelievable.. One plate chicken chowmein is more than enough for two people.. However, it's their roll that makes the headlines.. Huge parathas, stuffed with adequate chicken, is extremely heavy.. One roll would be a heavy meal for about atleast 4-5 hours.. Overall, their roll is a must-try

Well  I have savored on their roll items. They are worthy to give a try, specially the egg roll--they will provide you a roll of gigantic size and not everyone can have that entirely in one shot.
Apart from that I have tried out Special Moghlai, Chinese items -- the menu is very standard and mostly common dishes are available. The food is not bad but there is nothing special either-- and not costly.

 The restaurant is aesthetically very poor and requires urgent renovation. So best thing is to avoid having food inside, just take away and enjoy at home.

Just for the Egg Roll they provide I am bound to give them 3.5, otherwise nothing special about this place.

Feast is a take away restaurant. Feast score well when it comes to mughlai cuisine. I specially like their kebabs and rolls, though the roll are heavy. I would suggest to try the chicken roll or egg-chicken roll rather than the egg roll, because it full with potato...and makes it heavier for evening snakes. Fried rice and chilli chicken is equally good though the quality has been deteriorate. Chilli chicken is much more oily. Though the place is good for college student and for a quick roll.

Yet another food joint in my locality that I can be proud of. It's a take-away and home-delivery joint. Their food is palatable enough. They serve ample quantities per plate which can easily serve 2-3 people that too at a comparatively lesser price compared to other outlets or restaurants of the same kind. I don't think i have ever been disappointed in their food. Good food, good proportions. What more can one ask for. Worth giving it a try.

It is  a very small place and you will surely need a few visits to discover that its actually a restaurant and not a fast food centre. Moreover they are not the best as far as hygine is concerned in fact they serve you in plastic plates.
      But the food is surprisingly good in taste high on quantity and less harmful to the pocket.
      But they are best at making rolls which are massive. Its more of a take away place and home delivery is on time.

Feast is a small Chinese and North Indian cuisine restaurant located in Bosepukur, Kasba. The restaurant is mostly known for its Chinese preparations rather than North Indian. There is also a roll counter located outside the restaurant.

Food wise, the restaurant may not be the best when compared to similar restaurants in Kasba. Standard Chinese food is available here with little improvisations done. The menu is very standard and mostly common dishes are available. Fish and Prawn items are also available here. The food as I said is not bad but there is nothing special either.

The restaurant is one of the budget restaurants and your pockets will not be hurt very easily. Quantity is impressive when it comes to cheap prices. Home delivery service time is acceptable within 2km of distance. The restaurant is aesthetically very poor and requires urgent renovation. There are very less tables making it more of a home delivery or take away only restaurant.

Finally, Feast may attract more number of customers if they renovate their restaurant and improvise a little with food. Also they should focus on either Chinese or North Indian. My suggestion would be to go for Chinese as they are known for that.

the feast is perhaps the best place to experience the chicken rolls; not only they are large enough to make fill the appetite excess but also tastier and crispier so much that that one would like to visit it more often; the amount of oil used is more but still i think  while eating we should enjoy it leaving out health issues for a while . it will be better if the onions are served fried before they are embedded inside the chicken roll

I have been there for several times, yes I agree sitting arrangements are not very pleasing. They only have three to four sitting inside their restro. But they manage to place a few more chairs outside the main premise if you are talking about ambience. 

Feast started their journey with snacks only joint, but later on they tried their hands on main courses too. When I first visited they only have rolls and momos, and I don’t remember how many times I have gone there only to taste their momos. I have never tried their fried momo, but their steam momos are good enough to lead me there again. I find actual chunk of chicken in their dish (momo) which is very hard to find if it is not a well named brand. 

I have not tried my hands on their main courses which they acquainted later. But I have savored on their roll items. They are worthy to give a try. 

Yes if you are looking for cheap venture with taste, this place has a chance on your list.

This is a place from where I have been always taken home delivery. The seating arrangements are not where you would take your family so the genre of this place is well defined now. Few observations though:
(Read the following if oily food is something you really like :) )

1) The biryani is slightly oily but really tasty. Must try though.
2) The rolls are really huge and one is sufficient to complete your hunger requirements
3) Chinese is run of the mill, nothing very special but the quantity is very good
4) Tandoori main courses are all right but again have dollops of oil

Good if you are having a group of friends over for "adda" with good takeaway.

FEAST started out as a fast food joint. But later on started preparing multiple cuisines. I must say that this food-joint makes the most underrated-delicious biryani. Whenever people talk Biryani, they talk only about Arsalan and Shiraz, but this place produces some very nice biryanis, with tender mutton (worth it) and ample quantity of everything. Maybe the quality is a notch lower than Arsalan, but definitely worth a shot for the biryani-obsessed foodies out there.

Its our regular hang out place..with para friends..whenever..we decide to have a walk..
Their chicken roll is awesome..(a bit too large sometimes)..
I love the biriyani here too...it compares to any of the famed biriyani houses..
But my favourite has to be...Garlic chicken...truly its the BEST...
They have renovated the place recently..and come up with little sitting arrngements..which is a very positive move..considering their popularity..in this part of the city..:):)
I am a regular...and will always be..:)

feast is typical snacks and take away diner restaurant of Kolkata. Nothing very special about its menu. typical egg roll and chicken roll. mughlai paratha and heavily fatty biryani plus other regular dishes. enjoyed the food in college days as its low on bucks and heavy on stomach. They don't have very decent sitting arrangements. best for having a quick take away snacks while chatting with friends in that area.
