The food is pretty good. Tha hariyali Paneer tikka is a must eat for anyone whose visiting this place. Ambience is average. But a decently priced place with good food.

Breads and starter were good but veggies in main coarse weren't as expected. Soups tasted as if knor soup was served. But yes service was really appreciable....

I was actually shocked at the amount of the bill. We were 11 people and we had ordered so much food, but the bill amount was very less as compared to the quantity of food... I liked the north Indian!!

Ordered Chinese from Swiggy. Even though there are separate set of rules to be followed with them, Urban Edge fulfilled some personal requests of mine. Amazing service and behaviour.

Food is also superb! :)

A small place. Though spending time with just few friends is perfect but not for a large number. Atmosphere is pretty cool with soft music played and dim lights. The club sandwich is perfect and a must try, avoid french fries they aren't upto mark...rather than that enjoyed the service

Happened to visit this place recently for some evening snacks. 
Ordered fusion pasta which was incredibly delicious with all the herbs and spices blended appropriately.
However we didn't enjoy the  crispy Baby corn, which  was just way too crispy and over fried probably . 
Decor : very gross and the television played too loud. 
Overall , I could drop in a few more times for some good pasta ;) 
Cheers!

I had ordered food from this place a few days back. To be precise I ordered North Indian cuisine. The food wasn't too great but was decent enough to drive my hunger down. If compared to the cost, the food was definitely worth the price.

Its is a great place. Due to less attractions and an odd location it is not popular among the people. I recommend everybody should try it once. Step in any time you wont see a crowd so you can trust on getting a seat and even your food will be served fast. Food is delicious and will be light on your pocket too. I have been their several times. Haven't seen any change since the begining. Unlike the fancy places this restaurant has simple decoration. Every family has one place on their list which they visit once in a while. Mine is Urban Edge and im pretty sure even you will love this place like we do.

went via groupon/nearbuy voucher to have pasta so it costed me 99 instead of 170 but he immediately brought it in a minute after ordering .. basically it was made and they simply heated and brought ! The gravy was thick and like a paste didnt taste good .. although the pasta was boiled properly and their service is courteous !! please make and serve fresh

The place is situated nearly on the main road. It is for sure spacious and the sitting arrangement is good as well. The food is good but the quantity is less and the price according to that quantity is a bit high.

Date of visit : 20/11/2015

Location : near 4 no. tank, just next to aikya spa

Decor : Simple

Service : staffs are well trained and service was quick.

Foods ordered :
Spicy corn fitters
Pasta bhel
Fresh lime soda
Doodh cola

Description :
We went there in evening at around 5pm.. The restaurant was empty. We were escorted to our desired table. I ordered spicy corn fitter & kurkure kabab. But kurkure kabab was not available so I was suggested to try pasta bhel. Spicy corn fitters were average. Pasta bhel was new item but dnt like the taste. Both the drinks were below average..
Overall fooding experience was not good. But I liked the service. I have heard that food is good here, may be my choice of food was not good, so will definitely try again soon.

This place is near aikya spa. The best thing on its menu is pasta bhel. It had actually changed my concept of the pasta being boiled.
The food here tastes ok. I would not say it to be good except the pasta bhel because it requires a lot of improvisation.
I had a mixed experience.

WORST PLACE EVER. So I went there at 5 o'clock with a friend and the waiter said it's open. I assumed it to be cafe but it was a proper restaurant. Anyway, we ordered a babycorn as you can only have a snack at that time and it was really bad. Too deep fried, the coating was really hard. We also had two fresh lime sodas which were good. But the waiter was such a rude man, like none other I have met. He kept pestering in 5 min intervals and before we had finished our order, asked if we'll have anything else and came with the bill! And I asked as to why is he rushing and he said It doesn't take half an hour to have a starter. I told him he should learn manners and respect to which he had no reply. Piece of advise, NEVER GO. That man should definitely be fired.

A sunday dinner plan at fly quizina was slaughtered by the overpowering crowd there. So we were wakking staright from the restro.  Came across across a crossing and walked straight and took the second left. There stands a great veggie friendly restro. Urban edge. The seating arrangement is ample and so was the decor. The only problem is the shortage of staffs. They couldn't attend tp the customers on time. They were struggling I could see. They did not have time to even serve two glasses of water as well. The air conditioner was not even properly functioning. Then we ordered for a sweet corn soup which was pathetic in the literal sense. The instant knorr-soup packet seemed to have been served. It was a major turn off. Then came in the main course. We settled in for garlic nun, dal subzbahar and veg jhaalfarezi. All the items were equally amazingly.  I couldn't imagine vegetarian food can be so well made. I am definitely going back for the nun. But the ambience and the service have got to be worked upon.

I find myself as a regular to this place. It has a great number of things one can love. The pasta bhel is a new kind of dish with crispy penne pasta in red sauce. Yumm! And the tetragini i.e. spaghetti in your preffered sauce is also good. Nothing special about the interiors. I would recommend everyone to try different sorts of dishes that the place offers as the north indian though good is always just "north indian". The place helps you explore. The sodas are pretty tasty and go with their medium spicy food. The pocket pinch is what it should be according to the place. In fact I think its a bit less. Just one more suggestion, do try the lasagna too.

It's a veg restaurant in the salt lake area which is good thing for the vegetarians living nearby . Soups are delicious and starters have wide range of varieties but serving time is not that great.

Decor - No. Ambiance -No. Staff -No. Food - Yess. Price - Definitely Yess.
The place is a mix of a cafe and restrau with a small and encompassing menu. The Indian food is good. Even the lasagne was good. The sizzler was good to taste but was not sizzling hot. The kebabs were pathetic but then they accepted it to be their mistake and didn't charge us for that. Overall the place is good if you're somewhere nearby. The location in particular is void of good food joints specially veg!

Amazing food. Piping hot in true sense of the word. Tastes great. Prices are also pretty resonable. Though the ambience is pretty ordinary, I'd still recommend it as a good vegetarian joint. Do try the amazing starters, pastas, dal makhani, kulcha and biryani. Service could improve though.

Sitting at a friends place and wondering how to satisfy a hungry tummy, decided to take a leap of faith and allowed my friend to experiment a home delivery from this not so old pure veg joint without those routine zomato checks like the average voter rating and the reviews, and LESSON LEARNT !!!!!!!!!

I have not seen this place other than on the photo uploaded in its profile so cant really comment on the ambience or seatings but our order consisted the north indian preparations including the dal makhani, paneer makhani, veg biryani etc. Priced at Rs. 140 each, i could think of peter cat, kwality, first innings-the stadel, lazeez as my first in-league restaurants whose dishes too range between 135 to 200 but was disappointed !!!!!

I thought the only dish worthy of a mention or a re-order was the dal makhani which i liked a lot but the paneer makhani was average and quality of paneer ought to be better. Veg biryani suffered from an overdose of spices and oil. Pickles provided alongside dint seem worth a try. In the end, the dal saved our meal.

The serving is good but the preparations need to improve a lot. At such prices, i would expect a lot better than what i actually got !!!!!

Another Gem For Vegetarians In Salt Lake City!!
The Food Is Simply To Die For Here!!
But again it is hidden from the eyes of the people tucked between by lanes its slightly out of access and thus suffers.
But Once you eat its food you realize its simply amazing.
the menu is not a common menu, it has many items basically starters which you can order 5 6 at a time and enjoy with 3 or 4 friends, the prices are very cheap.
For to people it costs only 350-400 rupees.
Hope that more people see this place and increase its revenue as it would be sad if it closes down.

I liked the place and the food they served. It boils down to what you choose from the menu. Their cheese spinach florentine and aglio olio pasta are damn nice! The baby corn, nachos etc are just normal, nothing great. The staff is friendly and all. Overall, a nice place with slightly expensive rates.

Hi, We were a group of 8 people, who walked into Urban Edge for lunch on 26th Jan.Had a dreadful experience.The place was extremely humid with AC's just installed and not running when we entered the place. They presented d menu card for us with most things what we wanted to order not available in the kitchen. The staff are extremely poor in talking and knowing what to offer. Service was also extremely poor with over 30 mints of waiting time in serving, with no other customer in the place. To add to it, the price which they charge is too high compared to the quantity what they offer. We just ordered a Chinese and was shocked to see the uncooked noodles and meagre quantity which they offered. Just 4 manchurian balls were served which were also no value for money that they charge. Overall if you guys want to splurge your pockets with bad quality food, go try and see out for yourself what hell of a place it is..We walked out from the place and had to go other place to get and complete our lunch...So Foodies, beware before you walk into Urban Edge....
