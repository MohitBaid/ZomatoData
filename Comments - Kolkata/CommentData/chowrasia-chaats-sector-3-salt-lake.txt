The best place in Salt Lake for chaats.Situated just below carnival cinemas this place is always flooded with people during the evening hours.Their pao bhaji is also a must try and their shikanjis.They home deliver chaats and phuchkas too.

This small food joint is famous for its chaats and quick snacks. Food served here is all vegetarian . It has wide range of snacks from veg momos , Vada pav, Pav bhaji , varieties of lassi to papri chat, dahi chat and gol gappe.

One would never feel disappointed with the rate (cheap) and the quality of food they serve. The joint opens at 9am and runs the whole day . It's quite a busy place.

Highly recommended for Vegetarian foodies !!

A veg Chat store located in Broadway mall. Was here for some work and hence came to have breakfast here. The place is good . It's neat and hygienic. Prices are quite affordable. Had ordered the Piyaz paratha and the Raj kachori chat. 

The food tasted good and was good in terms of quantity too. 

They don't have a seating facility which is a let down. Otherwise a good place for quick snacks.

Almost everything that I have had taste very good. ¬†Although I haven't explored Kolkata much but this is the only place where I really liked the paranthe in Kolkata. Although the chole served with paranthe was not according to my taste. Every item can be said to be reasonably priced where it is neither too cheap nor too expensive

I love chaats very much and this is one of my favourite Chaat eatery. Located at the ground floor of Broadway mall, Sector 3, with quick service , serves quality chaats at reasonable prices. There is no sitting arrangement.

I love to relish their vada pav, dahi fuchka, samosa chaat, dahi vaada. Tangy , well flavoured and very chatpata.
They make good lassis too, thick & creamy .
A must visit place.

Location-Basement of carnival cinemas(salt lake) beside big bazaar..This outlet is basically a street chaat center with amazingly fast services...A great place to treat your hunger with all of the types of chaat probably available in India at a pocket friendly price...
P.S-Most of the time crowded by college students of the area(me being one of them)...

The stores below the Broadway Mall have few things in common - improper use of a place & excellence in customer dissatisfaction.
This Chaat Shop is located below the Broadway Mall, adjacent to Tea Junction, very near to Big Bazaar and close to Columbia Asia Hospital of Sector 3. Even being located in such a good location, one doesn't feel the niche to be there.
I've had visited here as I meant to watch a movie at Carnival Cinema and had some surplus time before the show was meant to started. Though the behavior of the staff were okay, I somehow didn't like being there.

Aftereffect: I went to the cinema somewhat dissatisfied.

Well, my 1st visit to this outlet ‚Äì one amongst many situated in the ground floor of the Broadway mall @ Sector 3, Saltlake ‚Äì near Bikash Bhavan. They do serve a huge variety of chats and parathas amongst several other evening munches as well as lassi! However, since I was full, I just decided to go for a parcel of 1 plate samosa ‚Äì packed along with some chutney.

Samosa was huge and cheaply priced ‚Äì just Rs. 10 each ‚Äì but what really was lacking was the taste. They do operate out of Bengal, hence, they imparted it a typical Bengali samosa stuffing (yellow coloured) along with peanuts, flavour and taste. However, this does not really impart it the desired taste.

Space is huge (considering they serve street food) and prices as well as service is fine. Variety and also availability is good! Might re-experiment with them in future ‚Äì this time some other items!

Tried the Papri Chat and Lassi once. The quantity was good. The portions of Papri, something which we usually carefully inspect before having the dish was also sufficient.

I have tried almost all the chaats here but my personal favourite is the ALU paratha and dahi fuchka. The foods are totally value for money.

This place has a lot of variety and was surprised by it too. It serves a variety of chats, momos, parathas etc.
We ordered
1) momos- not good but decent enough.
2) aloo parathaa- good taste and served properly with achar, dahi and one sabji at a reasonable price.
3) bread samosa- the best of the lot surely.
4) gundi paan - was good too.

Finally decided to give this place a try before catching a movie at Carnival cinemas...This place normally is not very crowded so if lucky,one might get a seat!!!

We had Dahi papdi Chat-The taste was like that of a typical North Indian papdi chat(not like the papdi chat one would get on the streets of Kolkata)...It had ample curd and was spicy as per my liking...But I found it a bit overpriced for the quantity they serve...

Nevertheless,would prefer trying some more chats out at this place!!!

Nothing is really impressive in this fast food outlet which is in the same building ground floor of carnival cinemas Saltlake Kolkata , as the stuffs are just only looking good on plate but not pocket friendly for the quantity they give you and then you are not satisfied with what you try out here , now i have seen this outlet come up right from the day this mall has set up and expected some improvement but its just getting worse or probably a place to avoid if you are hunry after watching a movie .

This is a den for chaat lovers in the area. You will always find a crowd in front of the shop. Mostly families come here along with kids and oldies to enjoy the chaats in the evening. The vegetarian community ate the dedicated customers if this shop who enjoy the snacks in between shopping or watching a movie at the same premises. Young boys and girls also sit here and order chaats and enjoy adda sessions. I tried the dahi puchke chaat here and I would say it is kind of average tadting as the dahi was too dilute and the combination of the masalas were nothing great. Also the papri chaat was kind of okay. Cannot say much about the taste as most of the items we trued were average in taste. Just that you get different varieties of chaats at the same shop in Salt Lake area. There is nothing great about the food here.

We had been for a movie after college at carnival cinemas. We didn't have time and much bucks for lunch so we entered the chaurasia chaats for a lunch. The alu parathas was of fifty bucks which was served with chhole, curd and anchar. It was more than enough for two people. The papri chat was also very awesome. It costed thirty five. It was spicy and chatpata.
The lassi was really awesome. It wasn't diluted with water. Thick and savoury.
And thank you zomato for adding chaurasia chaats to your list. I have suggested it many times. Their alu parathas are really great. Couldn't rest in peace without having reviewed it.

Location: Ground Floor, Downtown Mall (Carnival Cinemas). 

Chowrasia Chats (earlier known as Meals@Kolkata) is a purely vegetarian joint located adjacent to the box office of Carnival Cinemas at Downtown Mall serving different types of chaat items or to term it better, street food from different parts of India. It has a stand-n-eat concept, thus, lacks seating arrangements. They also have a kiosk inside, adjacent to French Loaf.

The fare ranges from Bhel to Batata, Puchka to Pakoda, Vada Pav to Samosa Pav, Pav bhaji to Stuffed Parathas and the list goes on. 
After a bit of contemplation, tried the following:

- Papri Chat
The papri was oily, the toppings were generous, but, the dish had a high level of tamarind chutney (didn't suit my palate) which as a result overpowered all flavors. Wasn't prepared as per personal preferences; had requested for less of tamarind chutney, wasn't catered to. Highly Disappointed.
However, the sev along with Haldiram's Bhujia on top did taste nice.

- Samosa Pav
Hot samosa sandwiched along with chilli coriander chutney & garlic chutney inside a sliced griddle-baked butter pav. The samosa filling was decent to taste and has a scope of improvement. The samosa pav tasted decent.

The staff was found to be polite and friendly who served at a prompt speed, but, missed on the little tweaks a customer wishes to have in their chaats.
Prices were found to be set at reasonable bars.

Overall an average experience.
- Being one of the better as well as hygienic options in the area, this joint is favored with high footfall. But, sadly I didn't find anything as good as the people quote it to be.

Jan 2015 : This is not a restaurant, but a well stocked food counter, located on the right side of ‚ÄòFrench Loaf‚Äô.¬†

Though the washed out outer signboard reads ‚ÄòMeals @ Kolkata‚Äô, the inner menu boards reads ‚ÄòChowrasia Chats‚Äô! Whatever the name may be, this food station is gaining popularity amongst the local population, because of its wide stock of ‚Äòchats‚Äô offered at pocket friendly prices.

We ordered - Rose Lassi, Pani Puchka, Vada Pav, Bhel Puri, Methi Paratha, Pyaz Paratha and Dahi Aloo Tikki. They were nice. Serving was in paper plates with plastic spoons. A big blue dustbin is placed on the footsteps, so as to keep the place clean.

Variations of the above mentioned food items are also available. Like ‚Äì normal and khus lassi, delhi suji puchka, samosa pav, tikki pav, sev puri, batata puri, other stuffed parathas (aloo, pyaz, gobi, paneer, cheese), chole aloo tikki etc. Other items in the menu are ‚Äì pav bhaji and other chats (papdi, kachori).

Counter attendants (two in number) are in uniform. Their serving is fast and precise, but they don‚Äôt elude any warmth or even any happiness over sale! Ample parking space is available.

An assorted meal for two will cost within Rs. 200/- or even less!

Street food doesn't get any more hygenic than this. Also,  the sooji puchka and vada pav are great, though a lot more taxing on the pocket than the ones you get in the roadside stalls.

This place is at the Downtown Mall, near the EZCC, Sector III Salt Lake,  Kolkata. I have visited this place many times without knowing this fact that this place is also listed on the Zomato. 
I came here to have their Pani Shuji Phuchka as a Phuchka lover since my childhood days. This place is bit different  from rest of the Street food centre from the point of view of my opinion as they have two types of Phuchkas, Normal Pani Phuchka and Pani Shuji Phuchka. Both are quite good in my opinion and another noticeable thing is that they use " Amchur" water instead of normal tamarind water. Whenever i want to have different types of Phuchkas,  I prefer to come here. Apart from having Phuchkas, I had their Paw Bhaji, Papri Chat and Raj Kachori Chat and yes, my experience was good.  They are hygienic as far their service is concerned. They don't have any permanent seating arrangement but i would love to revisit their place just to have Phuchkas.

Their Vada Pav with its butter roasted vada and lasooni chutney for 20 bucks is a killer deal. Grateful to a colleague for his suggestion.  They serve tasty Aloo Paratha and Pav Bhaji though the latter uses too much of food color.

But I keep on coming back to this place which is minutes away from my office for the chats. Simply delicious! Their mixed chat is my personal favorite and you can try out Aloo Tikia chat too. 

Over-all a good enough place to snack on quick bites or fix your chat craving on sudden evenings but unlike what the name suggests I cannot trust it in times of screaming hunger.
 Oh! the samosas are pretty hefty too.

Just back to office after having lunch here. The location is great, situated just under the Broadway/Big Bazaar Mall. Ordered a plate of Aloo Paratha. The Chanaa Sabzi, Raita and Pickle were complementary. The food tasted good and was filling too. However, all the items are too pricey considering the quality. My advice for you is to visit this joint only if you've no options left (or if you are a hardcore fan of chaats and parathas). Oh... and I should also mention that this place makes (perhaps) the best Vada Pao in Kolkata. So if you are here... do try it out.
