This place stand just two steps beside the Aminia take away counter of Golpark. Small shop but great in taste. I have been visiting this place since my school days. The last visit was after a long gap during my last visit to Kolkata, two months back. The place remains all the same.

My picks from this place are the chicken momos (steamed and pan fried) , chicken noodles and the chicken side dishes. They make great soups too.

This is a hidden gem in South Kolkata and I am happy that the taste is intact and so is the behaviour of the owner who greeted me with a smile and could recognize me after such a long gap. Will come back for more.

Had heard about this place from a friend of mine. So ordered in one day to fulfill my evening hunger pangs. Since it was just for snacks we order a chicken steam momo and a chicken Hakka chow. The food was good, typical Kolkata Chinese. I liked the momo and the sauce served along with it was super yum. The quantity of the noodles was really nice . Would love to try a full course meal from this place. This is only an order-in place without any seating arrangement, so keep that in mind. Till then Happy Dining Peeps :)

Took the food for home delivery. I took egg chilli garlic chicken fried rice and boneless pepper chicken. Both the dishes were quite good and tasty. Much beyond my expectations. The quantity is great and the prices are perfect. A good place for having Chinese when you are hungry and pocket friendly as well.

Ordered for home delivery. This take away joint is located near Aminia of Golpark. At very reasonable prices,they serve really sumptuous food. We had spring roll, vegetable schezwan rice, drums of heaven, vegetable manchurian . Spring rolls were especially perfectly made. I loved the veg manchurian too. So when you are hungry and want to go for something light on pockets, this place could be worth a try.

This is actually a take away food corner as it has no sitting arrangement but this one thing has nothing to do with the food they serve. Their fried Momo's are awesome. Along with it, they cook some great chowmein. It's fresh and the food will surely uplift your mood. So fresh n up is a must visit. It is located in an area where you'll get a chain of restaurants around yourself. But this place has its own blend of flavors.

Amazing and lip-smacking fast-food. If you ever want to have fried rice / Hakka chow, this is the place to be. Their chicken pieces in the non-beg variants of it are sumptuous and heavenly. 
Dry / gravy Chicken items can be worked on. 
Over all , good food.

An old joint in the area, it actually does provide authentic northern Indian food at very affordable prices. 
The manchurians and the chows are very tasty and the momos are quite inviting as well. 
There is not much for service here as the sitting accommodation is outside the shop, and is pretty much a carry out shop. 
Yet, the food maintaining its quality and their packing being good enough earns them the points.

A takeaway joint situated beside golpark ami nia, the place is pretty much the same as any other fast food joint. However, the difference is in the taste and quantity of the dishes. The taste may come as a surprise. It is quite unlike regular fast food joints and more like the fast food joints of a food court in a shopping mall. I had a plate of schewan chicken chowmein. It had a good tangy taste and spicy flavour. Quantity is more than enough for two. Overall decent place serving food at a cheap price.

I have eaten here innumerable times during my school days and considered this as a merely roadside place. It was only last week that i had been here after a very long time and was happy to see that the quality of food has improved. Recently was surfing through zomato for restaurants in the area and was very surprised to see this one listed.Located just beside Alibaba at golpark crossing this one provides a large variety of items. The mixed chowmein tastes nice. Among the sancks momo and chciken lollipop is worth a try. Very pocket friendly place. Ample proportions of food is served however there is still a lot of scope in terms of the quality of food.

I used to come here aot duing my school days for cheap wholesome Chinese food. I can't assure you about the quality but the food was very tasty and came in good quanitites.

Have to mention, their most famous is the chicken Lollipop. If you can't handle heat, then don't go it. It is extremely hot and spicy.

Fried rice is very good as well as other chicken preparations! 

Pocket pinch is low.

We stopped here to get some prawn chowmin, as it is right next to Aminia where we had just placed a party order, for the Chinese option for a small together. We would otherwise never have noticed this shabby little road side take out eatery. The noodles were average, generously peppered and studded with tiny gummy prawns. Nothing remarkable nor terrible.

Today we decided to take away food from this place after many years as this was a place which we frequented at one point in time. We ordered Chicken Pakora, Chicken Lollypop and Golden Fried Prawns. The details are mentioned below.

Chicken Pakora-There was a nice touch of masala in the mash but was too salty for our liking. Not sure why is it that they don't check the seasoning before serving their customers.

Chicken Lollipops-The coating was heavy in use of artificial colour which had an electric red effect.However,the inside was pretty soft.I would have preferred for the lollipops to have a coating of the sticky sauce which was missing.

Golden Fried Prawns-It was the best of the lot as it was soft and melt in the mouth which included the outer coating

They provided pouches of the Momo Sauce rather than the usual Tomato or Chilli sauce.

The location of the place is a plus point though they don't really have any decent seating arrangement.

The best part is the pricing of all the items which makes it extremely pocket friendly for one and all.

Its an extremely cheap and value for money joint. Quantity is adequate as per price. Its a good take away joint rather than dine in. 
Best dishes are 
Chicken Momos, 
Hot n Sour Soup, 
Chicken Pakora, 
Chicken & Vegetables
and Varieties of Noodles, Fried Rice.
However for other dishes its OK type.
Pros:
Quick service
Good quantity
Best for quick bites
Cons:
No place to sit (Unless u count a single bench on footpath)
Only Chinese
High on spices
Monotonous taste to most main course chicken dishes.

This joint is located just beside aminia at golpark. They are basically known for their momos. Since i was quite hungry, i ordered for a plate of chicken fried momo. There was a wooden bench in front of the restaurant and my order was placed in less than five minutes. I was very pleased with the fried momos. They were crispy and had a nice filling. I would come back to taste the other chinese items on their menu !! :D

Located at a prime location in Golpark, right beside Aminia, this is a take-away joint. Fairly priced and decently-tasteful food. I've been ordering-in for ages and my personal favourite has always been Gravy Chicken Noodles. It's lip smackingly good. Succulent pieces of sliced chicken and chunky bits of wholesome vegetables, what a perfect combination. Lately the noodles has been on thicker side but even then for a hundred bucks, it is an amazing snack, lunch or dinner. Chilly garlic rice is also worth mentioning. Avoid prawns as they aren't always cleaned properly. Amongst side orders, chilly chicken can't ever go wrong here. 

Pocket pinch for 2 people is about 300 bucks.

A small roadside place that basically caters to take away customers . It makes awesome momos both the steamed as well as the fried variant...that will keep you wanting more... Their noodles and rice are also very good. But the side dishes have too much cornflour which makes the gravy a tad thicker.. But they do mofify according to your wishes which us a huge plus!

This is a tiny place located at Golpark, beside Aminia. Dont go looking something fancy and you won't be disappointed. There is hardly place to sit, only a wooden bench. It is mostly preferred for take aways. The services however, is quite fast and the food, tasty and sumptuous. I like their fish preparation, like Fish Devil. it is quite tangy and lip smacking. Other preparations like Sweet Corn Soup, Hakka Noodles and Chilly Chicken are quite good too. I normally opt for take away and find it quite inexpensive. I have also tried their Roasted Chilly Chicken and found it to my liking. For a quick meal, the place fits my bill totally.

Just a walk away from my place, this place is a saviour for me when stomach starts craving for Chinese. Considering the pocket pinch and the deliciousness of evey side dish over here, it should be rated above 4.0 without a doubt. Just don't go for mixed rice n chilly chicken after checking out the low profile they apparently maintain, each n every dish has its own distinctive taste. And for those people who have a soft corner for spicy food, just go for Red Pepper chicken. it is quite capable of setting your ass on fire due to the spice in it, but at the same time it is equally delicious n yummy. Comparitively the side dishes are beter than the starters I would say. But still, if your stomach aches for some chinese with only 200-250 bucks in your wallet, Fresh-n-up is possibly the best option in the entire South Kolkata.

Just don't go for mixed rice n chilly chicken after checking out the low profile they apparently maintain, each n every dish has its own distinctive taste. And for those people who have a soft corner for spicy food, just go for Red Pepper chicken. it is quite capable of setting your ass on fire due to the spice in it, but at the same time it is equally delicious n yummy. Comparitively the side dishes are beter than the starters I would say. But still, if your stomach aches for some chinese with only 200-250 bucks in your wallet, Fresh-n-up is possibly the best option in the entire South Kolkata.

Fresh-N-Up - Did not make me feel fresh. 
====================================
Brief: Had made a visit today while going back home from Swimming. It is situated in the just beside Ralli's and to be more precise in the lane where the famous punjabi tinny Da Dhaba and Aminia is located. It is more like a fast food kiosk with prizes which are little on the higher side as compared to the place. It has open kitchen and you can see whatever is being cooked in front of you. Has three staffs- two helping in making and one packing and one cashier. They have kept some stall type wooden seats so that people can sit there. 
====================================
Food Ordered: -

I wanted to order Veg Steamed Momo. However, as they hardly keep any veg items, i had to start off eating Chicken Steamed Momo.

Chicken Steamed Momo - It was perfectly designed and served me with their spicy red momo sauce. However, the chicken chunks inside had been stuck up with the momo. The steamed maida covering was too heavy. It should be absolutely thin. I personally enjoy seeing it rather gulping it down. 
====================================
Summary:

Quantity 3.5/5
Quality 3/5
Hygiene 3.5/5
VFM 3/5
Taste 3/5
====================================
Conclusion: 

Not a very great place place. However, i am yet to try their other non veg items. There are a lot of items for Non vegetarians but lacks in Veg. Have a look at the attached pictures.

If one is looking for a nice Chinese take away, this is your destination. Indeed a very old restro, but the food is indeed worth a try. Then you can decide for yourself whether it's really good.

This is a tiny place in the same line as Tinny Da Dhaba and other small eateries - and I have to say, it has saved my life quite a number of times when I wanted nothing more than a well-made fried rice. I absolutely love their chicken fried rice and mixed fried rice - somehow the rice to chicken/veg proportion, taste and flavors are almost always spot on for me. I also like their chicken lollypops.. although they are not the best I have had. The momos are all right for me, strictly speaking, but I would definitely vouch for the fried rice.

Wow..!! Loved this place when I was in Kolkata. My mum and I used to go there in the evenings. Right in front of Mouchak this place was a surprise package and most definitely one of our favorites ! I loved their Chicken Lollipop and Momo plates !

This is almost 12-13 years ago and this definitely brings back some really nice memories ! Long live Fresh N Up and I truly miss the food even now :(

Fresh-n-Up serves really good chinese food. the fact that they have been in business at such a competitive environment around gariahat for over 10 years bears testimony to the fact that people like the taste of the food they serve. i wish they had a seating arrangement for dining. i also agree that some of their food is a bit on the spicy side, so people who are not accustomed to spicy food must enquire about the dish before placing the order.

Nice small joint just off Gariahat!Very good for a quick bite and take aways!The only complaint I've got is, their food is a little too spicy but can be made more suitable upon request.

Being a residence of gariahat, i never had a dearth for a food joint, and Fresh n Up use to be my favorite Chinese eateries nearby my place ever since my childhood, however the recent dip in their food quality and quantity has actually made me feel a lil sad. I had their chicken fried rice recently and it was served stale. The original taste of a good Chinese food is no more available with Fresh n Up.

I was introduced to momo's here. #Respect for serving momos in Kolkata at a time when 3/4th of the city hadn't even heard the name " momo ".

And STILL, they serve excellent momos with delicious sauces. A lot of eateries have sprung up serving this dish but I have a weakness for this one in particular.

No longer can I spot the old man who sat at the counter and took orders, no longer it is 1998, but Fresh'n'Up evolved with time and is still going strong. 

Way To Go.
