The restaurant serves fish and seafood related bengali, continental and South east Asian food. The fish kebabs tasted good except the galauti kebab, which was undercooked and smelled of raw fish. The fishes served in the Topse Fry were too small. We ordered Nasi Goreng, however the rice and the ingredients were undercooked. The Singapore Fish was not too good. However the sigh of relief was the prawn green curry. The grilled fish is not up to the standards of some other famous continental restaurants in Kolkata. Finally none of the deserts were good enough. The service was too slow and the place was too crowded.

If you ever thought fish kababs are just an extrapolation, you are bound to be proven wrong after visiting Fish Fish. Their Makhmali kabab and Fish Galouti kababs are pieces of fish heaven served on a dish. We had them as starters and believe it or not, again as dessert!!! For the mains we tried  Chitol macher muithya and chingri macher banspaturi both of which were good. A surprise was their mishti doi, creamy and yummy akin to the good old Jalajog er doi. Will recommend highly !

I admit that the rating is solely based on a single dish which I ordered for lunch, Grilled Fish with Garlic Toast. It was a kind of Fish Steak. Among the places which serves Bekti, I chose Fish Fish only to my great  disappointment. It was some inferior quality fish, looked and tasted much like the yellowish Indian Basa. Vegetables were not even half boiled, it was almost raw. The Broccoli, the Cauliflower and the beans became delights for the crows of my locality, best suited for them. Hoping that the 350 I spent on the inedible fish doesn't lead to a further expenditure of a thousand on medicines. Strictly not recommended.......

It's Fishy ! Very Fishy!
This outlet of Ballygunge is a must visit for Fish Loving Persons.Their decent & pristine ambiance will instantly give you a cozy feel.Staffs are very cooperative & patient in nature.We ordered Stuffed Bhetki with Legumes & Assorted Tandoori Platter (Pomfret,Bhetki & Jumbo Prawn) in Starter followed by Iccha Pulao, Prawn Fried Rice,Saghai Fish with Thai Fried Rice, Prawn Malaikari & Prawn Baanshpaturi in Main Course.Each item was delectable & different in taste.Rice items had decent amount of ingredients including Prawn.Only one thing which I disliked little bit is the quantity of rice items,could be little more.More or less It was a good & enjoyable experience.Being a Fishy person I would definitely suggest this place which has a perfect combination of  Seafood, Continental & Bengali cuisines.

As it says always keep it simple silly!!
As ambience goes, is pretty simple because they have invested lot of time to make the fish at its best. Starting from Gondhoraj Ghol to Fish salad to Chitol seek kebab, Rice combo, Ilish item and ending on a sweet note Chocolate Firni (orderd this as nolen gur er ice cream was not in the house) which is just out of the world. 
Too good, will try to catch up at this place soon again to try out other dishes!!

I visited this restaurant this week. The main attraction of this restaurant is in its name. Being a bengali and away from kolkata for a long time, this was my first choice to visit to have classic bengali fish delicacies. We had tel koi, loita jhuri, bashepora chingri , gondhoraj ghol. All the dishes were awesome n worth a try. The other thing i appreciated is the stuff service. I would definitely love to visit this many more times to appease my bengali tastebuds.:)

Second visit here.. Couldn't find a spot during pujas. But finally.. Ordered Elish macher jhol (Hilsa fish stew) and sada bhaat (Steam rice) late in the night around 10.30pm. Jhol was absolutely delicious, Elish properly cooked is just what you expect from a restaurant named fish fish. Staff too were very courteous. I felt the quantity was a little less though but when the food is so good.. It will never be enough!

Well I packed chingri machher baash paturi, steamed gondhoraj bhetki, bhetki masala,chitol machher muitha. The food was packed well and I don't have much issue on that but the main problem was the food. The quality of fish, the tenderness- it was all very good but the salt was too less and they​ didn't pack the prawn we ordered at all, instead they packed another bhetki preparation of the same type. The cooking was mediocre and nothing too special but the pricing of the food is at par or I might say a bit on the higher side. The staff at the restaurant was very friendly.

During Durga Puja , I went there for Lunch with a friend didn't get place....  Later we tried in the month of Feb 2016 , that time also place  crowded and we had to wait for 30-40min to get our table..
We Ordered :
1. Topse Fry (4/5) : Good in quantity as well as quality... Crispy outside and well cooked inside...

2. Chingri Muger Dal (4/5) : Light fried mug dal, with 2pc of Jambo Prawn and flavor of Green chillies in it.  Taste was good but Prawn was bit soft and the flavor of prawn didn't mixed well with the dal... 

3. Pata Pora Ilish (4.5 /5) : I splly  went there to try this dish. Different  from typical prep of Ilish in Bengali homes..They serves 1 Pc of Ilsha which cost u around 300 per plate... Bit higher in ur pocket... But if u consider the size and taste u may ignore the money factor...

4. Rice

Ambience is small, cosy.. Service was good..

Fish Fish the name itself specifies the theme of the restaurant. This is a heaven for fish lovers,located near Ballyganj Phari. When u step into this place, u will get an awesome smell of fish. Small cosy restaurant, very well decorated. We had cheese filled kebab in starter. First time i had fish kebab. It was good but it could have been better if the kebabs were little bit juice. We ordered a authentic bengali thali which contains of ghee, bhat, mung dal, begun vaja, fried topshe mach (2 pcs), chingri macher malai kari (2 pcs) and chatni. The gravy of chingri macher malaikari was just yammm... Then we had lacha parantha and tel koi. I will revisit the place to taste the crab and prawn items.

Visited few months back this restaurant is unique in name and serving all categories of fish items. Located in the lane of ITI near Ballygunge phari this place is not difficult to locate.
We ordered crispy fried prawn-very nice in taste and unique way of serving 6pieces of medium sized prawn fried golden brown in a batter and served with sweet chilly sauce.
Then we ordered their two of combos. In one we had Ghee bhaat with dal and begun bhaja with bhapa ilish and chutney and in second one there was chingri malai curry with topsey fry instead of ilish,the rest being same.
Lastly we had Notun gurer ice cream. We loved each and every preparation and the items were  prepared to perfection. The ambience was also proportionate with the name of the place.

"Fish Fish " is undoubtedly one of the famous fish joint in Kolkata. It's in Ballygunge. From it's name we can easily guess that it's quite famous for it's various fish cuisine. So here I go,
First of all the decorum of this hotel is quite good. The entire decoration is based upon costal culture. It contains few fishnets, few statues and fish like wooden work. The air conditioning and stereo system were also pleasant.
Now comes the food.
1. Topshe Bhaja, Moong Dal,Chingri Macher Malai Curry, Begun Bhaja, Ghee, Bhat, Chutney
It's the Thali for ONE people ( The quantity is ok for a single person. Usually we have a general idea that we can share a Thali between two people but in this case we can't. And it's written on the Menu Card also)
The taste of the Thali is ok.
2. Fish Tikka Butter Masala, Lacha Paratha, Salad
It's also an other Thali. Each and every items are superb specially the tikka Butter Masala. The gravy was just heavenly. And Laccha Paratha was also good. It contains little bit of oil. So who usually prefer less oil they must try the Laccha Paratha.
3.Kakra Kosha
@It's taste is also good. It's a little bit spicy but still it's pretty much ok. One can have this with Laccha Paratha or Plain Rice.
4. Ilish Pulao
It's one of the best item of "Fish Fish". It's sweet in taste and quite light in nature. It's just melt in mouth. And the quality of Ilish is also very good.
5. Cheese filled Fish Kabab
It's the best item of "Fish Fish". It's just absolutely awesome in taste. It's served with two different chutneys ( Green and Red).
Recommendations: Ilish Pulao and Cheese Filled Fish Kabab.
P.S. 
The quality of each and every fish and crab was awesome. So "Fish Fish" can be your lunch or dinner destination with your loved ones.

A small cozy restaurant tucked away on a lane near ITI in ballygunj area. Decor is understated. What attracted us to it was fish...being bengalees its our eternal love. So reached there on a wednesday afternoon for lunch. We were the only people there. We ordered fisherman's basket. A platter of assorted fries...liked all except the prawn cakes. We also ordered chitol sheekh kabab. It came with a green chutney and a tamarind sweet chutney. Very tasty. Then our mains...seafood lasagne and prawn stroganoff. Prawn stroganoff.....quite cheesy but tasty. Seafood lasagne very tasty but would have liked to feel a little more presence of seafood in it. Then our crab stir fry...yummy though messy. Forgot to mention gondhoraj ghol and aam panna.. ghondhoraj ghol could have drunk glasses of it if there was some more place in our stomachs

My craving for fish took me to this place. Nothing fancy about this place. The decor is nicely done with some great photographs by chef Debashish. We ordered prawn cocktail which was ok, crispy fried prawn was fresh nd crispy. The bhetki used in fish in salt nd pepper and butter masala was nt fresh. Dinning experience was nt great, could not make a  mark per the name  of the place.

Had a fulfilling lunch here. Situated beside the industrial training institute alley and just bordering kasturi ballygunge outlet, this place is a treasure for fish delicacies. We had a prawn fried rice and fish red curry. The rice was delicious filled with adequate spices, vegetables and succulent medium sized prawns. Coming to the red curry it has a rich coconut milk flavour but lacked the spicy tinge. The fish quality was good. Tender soft moderate sized pieces cooked to perfection. Prices are well suited for a fish serving outlet. The decor is minimal with some paintings, nothing fancy. Not much to speak of the ambience. Overall decent place which needs quite a lot of improvement.

Having read about this place in a few blogs, decided to give it a try.We had ordered the following items :
i)Fish Fish Chello Platter(3.5/5): It was not listed on the menu card,but when we asked for it they said that it was available. The kebabs in the platter were good.Batter fried fish was too oily.
ii)Malabar Fish Curry (4/5)- The gravy had a coconuty flavour,with a tinge of sweetness.It was delicious.
iii)Chingri Macher Bass Paturi(3/5)-Though it was presented in a unique manner,inside a piece of bamboo but the gravy was average.Did not have much flavour.
iv)Mung Mohar(2/5)- The dal was bland.Just had a faint taste of ghee.It's better to avoid it.
v)Plain Rice (5/5)-Nothing to say about this.

Service(3/5): Despite being almost empty the service was slow.
Overall, it was a mixed experience. Would like to try out the continental items in future.

They had a set menu, and we loved the chingri r daal, and the fish in bamboo, very well done, good portions. We visited around 7-- the place was emptyish, and we had full attention of the servers. 
 The food was actually that good that I forgot to click pictures and just gobbled.

Had ordered different variations of fish and was not disappointed. The Malabar fish curry reminded me of my vacation in Kovalam. But the best of the lot was Bekti Begun Bhorta it was just too good. Pabda was also good. Had ordered one continental preparation I guess it was baked fish in white sauce or something had expected some cheese but no cheese or sauce this was bit disappointing. But overall it was really good. Goan fish curry was equally satisfying but my family just loved the  bhetki begun bhorta... price is not overrated it's reasonable with regards to portions. Overall satisfied and happy

I have had the experience of ordering food twice from this restaurant in the past one month using Zomato Online App. Once I had the honour of eating  myself and the second time I ordered sitting in my home at Singapore for my old parents @ Kolkata.  On the first occasion i ordered something which needed to be changed because I didnt understand the item from the title and absence of any explanation on the APP didnt help.  I had a bit of a challenge expressing my desire to get the order changed after the payment was made online. However the Manager finally relented and helped me out. The Beer Batter Fry was fine - a bit oily but good and solid. The Fish kalia was a tad too spice for me. The Second occasion where i ordered Bhapa Ilish for my parents remotely was better (as heard from my parents who are great connosiuers of fish). All in all, the menu looks quite interesting and I will love to try their food out again. Thanks for helping out, guys!!

If you like seafood, then look no further than "Fish Fish", a small restaurant, tucked away in Swinhoe Street in Ballygunge.  Started off with Prawn Fritters and Crab Cutlet which were really tasty. Main course options we chose were English Fried Fish with Tartar Sauce, Very nice!, Assorted Tandoori Platter (Nice variety), Ajwani Macchi Tikka, Grilled Fish with Garlic Toast , Prawn in Red Curry, Steamed Gondhoraj Bhetki,all items are mouth watering.

Fish Fish has an extraordinary but wonderful ambience, specially created by the pictures of fishes and other interior decoration. The staff are friendly and well-behaved. Food quality is satisfactory and the price range is within the capacity of the middle-class people. I had jumbo prawn malaikari with plain rice and it was a sumptuous lunch for me. I would give Fish Fish a 4.5 rating out of 5 and would endorse it as a good dining venue for fish aficionados. :-)

I have heard a lot about this place in zomato and in some Blog sites, one fine day decided to visit the place. 
As the name suggests fish lover should go there, I am very big fond of fish so it was in my bookmark list since long time. 
Location - in ballygunj area beside kasturi restaurant better to take ola or if personal car then turn on map as it is not in Main road, one may find difficulty to search this. 
Service -  very fast and prompt 
Ambiance -  interior was good and nice
Food - I ordered one topshe combo consists of topshe bhaja, chingri macher malai curry, begun bhaja, ghee bhat, dal and chutney, also ordered one plain rice, shorshe ilish and pomfret masala or pabda jhal don't remember it.
I did not find any extra ordinary thing, as the name suggest I thought would be a best place for fish lovers. My personal experience was good not awesome. One thing I like the most about the place is varieties of fish under one roof. 
For only varieties of fish will go again, and looking forward to try other items.

Went there for lunch on Xmas to this place, and was glad to find that most of the tables were unoccupied. Ordered the Fisherman's Basket, Seafood Lasagne, Seafood Gravy Noodles and Szechwan Fish. 

The Fisherman's Basket was an assortment of batter fried seafood. While some of them were good, the tempura prawn wasn't crispy at all and the pomfret overfried. 

The Lasagne looked and tasted great, but had more of spinach and corn than seafood. The other two things that we ordered were decent, and as we're expected. 

The servers were courteous but service was very slow. More glaringly because only one other table had guests. 

What I loved is the menu itself, which includes tikkas to steaks, paturis to tempuras. Would love to see the place doing better in the coming days.

Fish in Bengali style and continental are equally charming .. must try Stuffed Bhetki & prawn stroganoff .. and Min Sorba as soup .. ambience is calm .. it's a cosy place with lots of good clicks ..

As the name suggests its the place to be if you are a fan of sea food.... Had heard a lot about this place online on different food pages/blogs and thus was on my agenda on my trip to kolkata...

Had ordered tandoori pomfret and prawn tempura with namchin sauce...

Both the dishes were good but for a place that specializes in sea food had expected a lot more from them... 

Tandoori pomfret was standard nothing exceptional about it, and the prawn tempura was a little oily to my liking also the batter was very soft while the fried prawns should have been crispy....

Awesome place! You are welcomed with the lovely aroma of cooked fish as soon as you enter. Went here for a team lunch and had a great time. Food was yummylicious, me being an all-time fish lover felt like I was in heaven! Special mention for the gondhoraj ghol. It's a perfect ending to a hearty meal !

This small restaurant is a must visit place for all fish lovers of Kolkata. There is ample parking space beside the restaurant and no need for prior booking since you will mostly not find too much of rush inside the restaurant. We were a group of 4 people and ordered fisherman basket and bbq prawn with burnt garlic salsa as starter. Both the items were awesome. 2nd item was a little hot but Taste wise mind blowing. In main course we ordered ilish pulao, plain rice, bhapa ilish, steamed gandhoraj bhetki, chelo platter, crab meat fried rice and mandarin fish combo. Quantity ok (neither too small nor excessive). And taste wise everything was so perfect. The beat item was stemmed bhetki dish which is their speciality item. Crab meat fried rice is also worth mention since it is not that typical fried rice we get in ordinary Chinese restaurants. It was little sticky and had wonderful flavour. Chocolate firni at desert was also very good. There are many other exciting dishes in their menu and that demands for a repeat visit

We have visited Fish Fish at Ballygunge. Food is good, but the behaviour of one of your staff named bikash/vikash is very much rude.I was really surprised with the payment system at your place. I have carried sodexo and card for making the payment. My total billing amount was 1747 rupees only.I have very politely asked to pay 1000 rupees in sodexo coupon and balance rs. 747 on card, but Bikash/Vikas replied rudely. and said that its not possible in Fish fish as the company has its own rules and regulation that only one payment mode can be used at a time, i.e. either i should use coupon or card. In the fraction of a second he again said just to make the payment system ease, he could not accept both card and coupon. So my question is "Is it a defined rule or a created rule by himself only?His behaviour was quite harsh.Hence I said to him that I have not expected such a rude behaviour from Fish Fish(the place I visited 1st time), and would never visit this place again.This is my 1st and last time.That person Bikash/Vikas in reply said "Yes, its not a problem". I am really surprised. I have finally paid Rs 1750 in sodexo and he has returned me Rs 3.Please note in sodexo no return can be possible. But he returned me Rs 3. So I have assumed that perhaps this person Bikash/Vikas has created its own rules and regulations regarding payment system at Fish-Fish for the customers. Horrible experience. Hope you should do the needful at your end.

Located just beside the Kasturi restaurant near the south Point school which serves only the fish items. Ordered fish basket - combo of all types of fried bengali fish which tasted good and chocolate phirni is the signature dessert of this eatery which tasted delicious. Ambience and service is good. Pocket pinch is a bit high.I would recommend the Bong fish lovers to try out at this eatery.

Being Bengali, I have a natural love for fish and this particular restaurant satisfied me with their lovely food. Went there couple of months back and forgot to write the review. 
Ambience :  Good
Management : Good
Food : lovely
Pocket pinch : slightly on higher side but value for money. 
As it's too late, I couldn't remember all dishes I have tried. Some of those were fish makhmali kebab, a crab dish, mixed sea food hakka noodles, one squid dish and one prawn dish. What I could remember is fresh fish, tasty preparations, moderate quantity and we love them all ! If you love sea food & fish, a must try place atleast for once.

Wholesome and all items have its unique taste.

Located next to Kasturi, Ballygunge, this place is a must visit for every fish lover in the city. 
Really glad with my experience today. ❤

First, the ambience is really nice. I loved the themed pictures and blue lighting, complete with a fish net hanging from the ceiling. Really pretty.

Second, the food was lipsmacking to say the least! Coming to the food quickly. We had ordered :

• Amritsari machhi - this was our starter, which consisted of 6 pieces of fried fish. It was really crispy, and the fish was really fresh. Was literally melting in the mouth. Full marks for this one. 

• Fish chelo platter - ah! This was manna dew for every fish enthusiast. It had rice which was topped with a poached egg, and 2 fish kebabs, one huge fried fish (somewhat reminded me of fish kabiraji minus the egg batter), one piece of tandoori prawn, and one fish sheek kebab which I'm guessing was chitol maach (I could totally be wrong though. 😅). Each of the items were beautifully prepared. Loved it! 

• Chocolate Firni - an amazing end to an amazing spread. This was so gooood, that I can't really express it in words. I just wish they had served a bit more of it, instead of in a shallow, deceptive looking bowl. This was really amazingly prepared. 

• 2 glasses of coke to wash down the food.

The service was prompt, and the staff knew what they had to do. 
Absolutely in love with this place.❤

Pocket pinch - 1446 for the two of us!

So it was a family lunch on a Sunday & everything that could go wrong did. The topshe fritters were raw inside and we had to squeeze lemon to douse the smell. Ilish pieces were cut diagonally making the bones totally unnegotiable. The chitol muithya had coriander leaves and were green in colour. Anyone seeking Bengali food go to 6 Bally or Kasturi. Will never visit. Ps: we ordered risotto which was muddy like bhog khichri and came with bread sticks!! Stumped. Not recommending.

The name is a big away! Located in the lanes of Anil Moitra road, this one stands beside Kasturi, giving tough competition to each other. Tried their fish finger with aioli sauce! The fish quality needs improvement, a bit too oily..like really oily! Seemed as if was made in a hurry.
The chocolate firni was not upto the mark at all! The firni was grainy n lacked taste. The Hershey's sauce could make up much for the lost taste.
The aioli dip was perfect though!

It was a cozy March afternoon (13-3-2016) that two of my closest friends and I chose to meet at this "fish place" and boy! were we not disappointed. Snugly ensconced in a sleepy little nukkad, the restaurant is small (tables too closely set) but otherwise empty when we ventured in. The rest, as they say, is history. We started with gondhoraj ghol, fresh lime soda followed by posto chingri bora, fish galouti kebab, prawn cocktail, ilish polao, rup chander bhorta, chingri machher bass paturi and ended with notun gurer ice cream. All the dishes were flawless. We ended up ordering more rice to do justice to all the little entrees we ordered. The fish portions are good, the cooking just right. Thankfully, all the different fish have been cooked differently and taste very varied. Otherwise fish fish would have been one big yawn of fish after fish, which would not have been very rewarding. The decor is fun, with big fishing nets draped all around and big blowups of fishing. Talk about fishy!

Located between Gariahat and Ballygunge, away from the main road, near the Mandeville garden and Swinhoe street crossing this restaurant is a pretty easy spot and there is free and available parking all around. The ambience is posh with smooth music on the speakers.
Specializing in their fish delicacies, they serve one of the best baked crabs in the city, 2nd only to Mocambo maybe. We ordered the Bhetki paturi, crabmeat rice and Mandarin fish combo and Prawn Stroganoff. Out of all tha the Crabmeat rice combo was specially good, Bhetki paturi was good enough while the continental prawn disappointed us a little.
I have been there some 3 times bit I can't seem to remember what we ordered. And yes I'll be back to try some more.

Fish Lovers Paradise. Only Fish dishes national or international. Awesome/toothsome, luscious, delicious, delightful. Cool ambiance, tastefully décor. Whether, Indian, Chinese, Italian, continental or Mediterranean everything cooked using verities with Fish only. We also tried verities. In Indian, Bengali cuisine most innovative & a must is Chitol Fish ( Clown knife fish ) Seekh Kebab. Tel Koi was not upto the mark. Cooked in west Bengal style with onion & tomato which actually not required for Tel Koi. International, Fried Kalamari, very crispy yet juicy, best ever had. Even better than Jamies Italian. Fish risotto was simply delicious. Cooked with, squid, prawn & Kolkata Bhetki, perfect. Fried Fish platter was toothsome. beautiful presentation. Bhetki, King Prawn, pomfret & Kalamari, Delightful. Bhapa Chingri was too good. Finishing with Gurh (date jaggery) ice cream was super hit. Actually want to try all dishes in the menu. So waiting for my next Kolkata visit. Service is little slow. Chef is great. RatingFood- 4.5/5Service- 4/5Ambiance- 4/5Value for money- 4/5Highly recommended.

Fish fish and some more fish if you will. Nice little cozy place off Ballygunje Place this place knows a thing or two about fish cuisines. Some of the names may surprise you as they aren't mainstream (like Chitol, Boila etc). Of course the usual suspects (Hilsa, Bhetki, Chingri) are there in all their glory. Surprise dish was Nasi Goreng (with fish of course). Nice dinner.

Seems to be a over-hyped eatery. Dishes are bit pricey in comparison to the taste or quality of food. In case you wanna try out new dishes, don't seek their waiters' recommendation, as that might turn out to be a horrible experience ! I had tried "ilish in padma kuri" which tastes pathetic. The other non-veg preparations taste average. They take quite some time to serve the order on table.

Are you an avid fish lover? Fond of the varieties of dishes that can be prepared with different kind of fish and prawns? Then this is an apt place for you!! 
The theme based decor of the place will make you feel good. We had ordered for BBQ prawns with salsa sauce, grilled Parmesan fish with garlic toast and mixed fried rice( with prawns, fish and egg).
The prawns were pretty big in size and tasted great, though a little on the spicier side, but if you like your starter a hot ( as in having ample quantity of pepper corns in it) and spicy one, you would enjoy it. The prawns were fresh. The grilled fish was also cooked well, however, felt that the texture of the grilled fish could be a little more soft. The fried rice was cooked to perfection. Overall, quite delicious and fresh food and the cost would not burn big holes in your pocket! Would certainly like to come back soon !!

Great reviews on Zomato prompted us to order from here - ordered for home delivery from here. The spread on the menu card looked broad and promising. We decided on Gondhoraj bhetki, Chitol kalia and prawn pulao. Chitol maach quality was excellent. Gondhoraj bhetki was in a creamy sauce base, which is quite an interesting take for a perennially popular fish. Finally their prompt response for delivery all the way to new alipore is commendable. Overall a fishilicious thumbs up to fish fish!

Sumptuous Fishy dinner which satiate your taste buds- it was my husband's birthday and what can be a better place than this for an avid fish lover. I will describe the place and food in details:
Ambience:
Simple yet artistic is how I will describe Fish Fish. There is no overdoing in the decor. But the simplistic approach gives it the perfect interior. Rabindrasangeet is played at a very low volume which adds to the feel of the place.
Food:
The presentation of the food was really nice. We chose to have continental and we started with Prawn Cocktail and Seafood salad. Both of these were really nicely decorated and presented. The prawn cocktail had eggs and mushroom in it which added variety to the dish. The seafood salad had prawn, bhetki and squid along with finely chopped vegetables.
In the main course we chose Grilled Pomfret in Pesto and Seafood Lasagna. I expected good food but what we got was AWESOME FOOD. I had lasagna at the US before and it was as yummy as that. Very well cooked and it tasted perfect with the cheese coating. Pomfret was served with the pesto sauce and potato and onion pieces. It was grilled to perfection and well blended with the sauce.
Overall it's a pocket friendly place which is like heaven for fish lovers. 
I would deduct just 1 point as all the dishes were cooked with a bit too much of salt.

I am forced to write this review as I found most of the reviews are misleading and utter misrepresentation of the actual quality of food at this restaurant. I went their with my family and first ordered the much talked about 'fish basket'. The fries were crispy but more coating and less fish. They were also too salty. A vada has a smell of 'besan' rather than the smell of fish and inside was not fully cooked. The Mug dal was ok with a smell of ghee but too light. The worst of all was the Hilsha Bhapa. Too much of 'sorshe' made the bhapa completely bitter. There were limited option for any thing to go with dal like 'postor bora' or even very common 'jhuri Alu bhaja'. This is not at all comparable with Kasturi which is much mush better and value for money.

Kasturi gave me the thrust needed to try out the various Bengali cuisine restaurants in the city and hence visited Fish Fish on the hot afternoon of Bengali New Year. Quite naturally there was a queue however we got lucky as the waiting time came down and Chef Debashis Kundu who is also the owner/Manager of the restaurant was greeting the customers himself, very heartening personal touch as per as service is concerned. The ambiance screams "something fishy" as soon as you enter. Fish nets, fish motifs, pictures and the stark dominance of fish in the menu was delightful for any fish lover. There was a special Noboborsho Menu going on and we took Plain Rice, which was perfectly cooked. No sogginess and long grains of rice. Shona Mug er dal came along which had a mild ghee aroma in it and we loooved it. There was Chital Maccher Seekh Kabab as a side along with the dal. If you have came along Chital Maccher Muittha it's like that only formed in the shape of seek kebab. Fleshy, coarsely spiced. In the mains we took suggestions from Chef Debashis and he suggested Steamed Gondhoraj Bhetki and Sorshe Chingri. Sorshe Chingri had the distinct pungent aroma of mustard and medium sized Tiger Prawns perfectly cooked in it with occasional hint of chopped coconut. But the best of the lot was definitely the Gondhoraj Bhetki. Super soft and fresh Bhetki diced and cooked in a coconut based semi thick gravy with a heavenly aroma of Gondhoraj leaves and lime juice. The entire preparation was presented in a sealed Bamboo Shoot. The fish was so fresh and soft it kept falling of the forks. And the gravy. Drool worthy and definitely a recommended one. Beautiful initiative by Chef Debashis and all the praises for making only fish a forte of them. We bengalis love u for that and will visit again. Cheers!!

Been to this place 3-4 times. It's an absolute Fishetarian's Paradise. Tried Pomfret Maacher English Fry, Chitol Maacher Kalia, Bhetki Bhaapa and Chingri Maacher Malai Curry, among other dishes. The quality of food is really amazing, and that includes the fine steam rice too. The quantity is pretty exhaustive too! However, the prices are a bit on the higher side. The ambience is pretty ordinary, and the waiting time can sometimes be on the higher side too. But if you're looking to experience the best quality of fish, you've come to the perfect place.

Nothing really to say about this place. I wanted to give it more rating but I couldn't. The boxes stopped me. Amazing food and taste. The ambience is really nice. Just one thing it is expensive.

Kasturi gave me the thrust needed to try out the various Bengali cuisine restaurants in the city and hence visited Fish Fish on the hot afternoon of Bengali New Year. Quite naturally there was a queue however we got lucky as the waiting time came down and Chef Debashis Kundu who is also the owner/Manager of the restaurant was greeting the customers himself, very heartening personal touch as per as service is concerned. The ambiance screams "something fishy" as soon as you enter. Fish nets, fish motifs, pictures and the stark dominance of fish in the menu was delightful for any fish lover. There was a special Noboborsho Menu going on and we took Plain Rice, which was perfectly cooked. No sogginess and long grains of rice. Shona Mug er dal came along which had a mild ghee aroma in it and we loooved it. There was Chital Maccher Seekh Kabab as a side along with the dal. If you have came along Chital Maccher Muittha it's like that only formed in the shape of seek kebab. Fleshy, coarsely spiced. In the mains we took suggestions from Chef Debashis and he suggested Steamed Gondhoraj Bhetki and Sorshe Chingri. Sorshe Chingri had the distinct pungent aroma of mustard and medium sized Tiger Prawns perfectly cooked in it with occasional hint of chopped coconut. But the best of the lot was definitely the Gondhoraj Bhetki. Super soft and fresh Bhetki diced and cooked in a coconut based semi thick gravy with a heavenly aroma of Gondhoraj leaves and lime juice. The entire preparation was presented in a sealed Bamboo Shoot. The fish was so fresh and soft it kept falling of the forks. And the gravy. Drool worthy and definitely a recommended one. Beautiful initiative by Chef Debashis and all the praises for making only fish a forte of them. We bengalis love u for that and will visit again. Cheers!!

Been to this place 3-4 times. It's an absolute Fishetarian's Paradise. Tried Pomfret Maacher English Fry, Chitol Maacher Kalia, Bhetki Bhaapa and Chingri Maacher Malai Curry, among other dishes. The quality of food is really amazing, and that includes the fine steam rice too. The quantity is pretty exhaustive too! However, the prices are a bit on the higher side. The ambience is pretty ordinary, and the waiting time can sometimes be on the higher side too. But if you're looking to experience the best quality of fish, you've come to the perfect place.

Not being much of a fish lover i went to this place with lots of doubt in my head.

But this place just threw me apart. 

I started liking fish only because of this place.

The place in cozy enough and the staffs are friendly. 

The food is awesome. 

Allover a great restaurant.

This is a one of a kind restaurant which serves only fish delicacies.... It has a wide range of fish to choose from-Ajwani Machi Tikka nd Macher Muitha are its specialties.... The shrimp pulao is also a must try.... The decor is also different covered with the traditional Bengal pata chitra’s.... You are sure to fall in love with fish after visiting this restaurant.....

Long craving for bengali cuisine was fullfilled by this restaurant. Decent Ambience. Ordered chitol machersheekh kebab, chingri malai curry, daal,bhaat. Food presentation was really good which fuelled our hunger. And, the aroma of the chitol starter was amazing! The only mess up was the daal which was too bland. Rest, Thumbs UP!!

DO NOT GO... i am a huge fish lover and was very excited when this came up...hoped really good fish items. But this restaurant is a big let down. The menu is exotic only on paper. The waiter warned us in advance not to have grilled items and advised we order tandoori in appetizers. But we thought we would b able to manage it. The grilled platter was miserable... stale fish and badly made. So was the baby bhetki which followed. Scared ( and hungry) we ordered indian/ bengali items and what came was extremely ordinary food..
Wont visit again stale-fishfish

The name itself is tempting for Fish lovers. Whenever we visit Ballygunge I used to visit 6 ballygunj but while passing through the neibouring lane I had noticed this restro and the name attracted me. This time decided to lunch there. To my surprise in the peak lunch time I found only one family inside. Rest of the tables were empty. Very cool ambiance, tastefully decorated, not loud. The complete fish menu was aweosme. Its not only Bengali Dishes, it contains international cuisines with fish only. Whether Chinese, continental, Italian, meditranean everything with fish. The Best part is pricing specially for a delhite. We ordered Fried Kalamari, (sqid) Chitol Seekh Kebab in starter. Tel koi & Risotto in main course. Kalamari was simply awesome & Chitol Koi was out of the world. Hats off for the concept of serving chitol fish in this form.Delicious delicious and delicious. I actually want to taste every dish on the menu.

This place is unusual in its insistence to stick to fish, only. The tandoori chilli fish made for a delicious starter as did the Mandarin Fish and rice combo. Note- Crab fried rice wasn't available, so it was substituted by the Thai one, which did have fish and squid rings, just no crab. The Mandarin Fish tasted great too. Overall, good quality fish used, which made things really tasty. Pricey, yes, but tasty too.

Went here on a very hot Kolkata summer day after watching a movie..it was almost 3pm.
The ambience reminds you of cool and the inside is quite spacious.
The waiters were available on demand and their service and behaviour was perfect.
Coming to the food...awesome..
We ordered 'Chingri Baansh Paturi' , a thali , 'aamshotto khejur chutney' , fresh lime soda and 'Gondhoraj Ghol er shorbot' .
Chingri Baansh Paturi was just awesome,served in a thick and long bamboo shaft,blackened by cooking,the mustard was fresh and strong,the 'chingri' retained all its natural flavours..the thali included Bhapa Ilish,Chingri Dalna,Rupchander Muitha,Topshe Bhaja,Dal,Begun Bhaja,Gheebhath,Chutney..it was excellent,the bhapa ilish was wonderful,it was soo tasty,so was the 'muitha' and Topshe Bhaja,soft and full of the natural flavours..
'Aamshotto khejur chutney' too met all expectations,and the 'Gondhoraj Ghol er shorbot' gave a pleasant surprise too,yummy..
All in all,I would love to keep coming back here,especially on hot sunday afternoons and would recommend each and every one of you to pay a visit here :)

Fish finger with aioli dip is perhaps the best dish I have had in a while. Must try! 

The decor is cute and the quality of the fish is okay, the hilsa quality could have been better in the main course. Combo meals are quite filling !

If you planning to eat awesome fish dish with full of Bangaliana, Fish Fish is one of the best choice. I ordered combo thali with pomfret tandoori. Thali contain nice amount of rice, daal, began vaja,  parsre and chingri er malaikari. The ambience is trendy not contemporary. I am very glad for their hospitality and nice test in all dishes. I have to mentioned the size of pomfret, its amazing, every one should have to try it.

Bengali and Fish- the eternal love story transcending the borders of time and space, and when you plan to start a restaurant to capitalise on this everlasting bonding you are already embarking on a winning voyage.. Thats what has been the case with this joint, to segment yourself as a 'Fish Only' restaurant gives you a competitive advantage right at the starting mark.. And then to satiate the palate of the ver-critical Bengali foodies with some superlative dishes and innovative cooking style definitely earns you a place among the Elite Joints of the City..
Coming to the ambiance, well elegance is achieved with the simple and sobre decor while concentrating on the theme with the unique fish nets hanging from the ceiling, the rather unusual paintings on the wall and even the boat top table at the entrance.. The service was spot on and what I liked is that all the items displayed on the menu are available and the quality of the fish served was superlative.. Though they took a bit longer to serve but once the food is on the table you can't complain..We ordered:
Chitol Machher Sheek Kebab: Loved the twist, since Chitol is cooked similar to proteins, liked the rendering, though wish had a bit more punch and taste the spices more prominantly, but nevertheless it was a new dish to our taste buds..
Amritsari Machchi: Six generous portions of bhetki fillet marinated in spices and chillies and fried to perfection, crisp, soft and hot..
Ilish Bhapa Platter: Served with Ghee Bhat, Yellow Dal, Begun Bhaja and Chutney.. the ilish was spot on..Tasted such a quintessential version of the fish after a long time..Portion was generous and when you have the piping hot Ilish wrapped in mustard paste alongwith the beautiful fragrance of the rice, Heaven it is..
Chingri Bhapa Platter: Similar to the above one, only Chingri in place of Ilish.. The Chingri was marinated with Coconut and Mustard paste, a tinge sweeter than the Ilish dish and two large pieces of Tiger Prawns were served..
Thai Fried Rice with Sanghai Fish: A bit dissappointed with this combo after a superlicious meal till now.. The Fried Rice lacked the aroma and flavours of a typical Thai dish.. The fish was however good, tangy red sauce containing 4 cubes of batter-fried fresh fish..
Chocolate Firni: Wow!!! they have not only mastered the cooking of fish, but also they do excel in their desert spread and certainly this is indeed innovative.. Loved the play with the original flavours and the blend of chocolate.. Passionately Recommended..
Overall our total bil came to Rs.2226/-(all incl) for 3 people.. Definitely I am already urging to go back and sample their unique play with continental dishes..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

Superb place for fish lovers. Had some awesome fish items. Had chitol machher sheek kebab, fish galouti kebab and BBQ prawn for starters. For the main course had grilled fish with garlic bread and chitol machher steak.Fatafati tastes. Service quite good and interior was neat. But in one visit the expedition wont be completed...Surely going back again 
If anyone wanna try any fish preparation be it Bengali or fusion dish you should pay a visit to this place.

Every time I've been in Kolkata for the last couple of years, I've passed by this place. Finally tried it and was not disappointed.
The décor is nothing to write home about, although, don't get me wrong, the place is quite cozy. But the food more than makes up for everything else.
For starters, we ordered the Fisherman's basket, an assortment of fried fish like topshe, bhetki and lota, and the chitol maccher sheekh kebab. The basket was good, but I'd recommend trying something else over the chitol sheekh (although it wasn't bad).
For the mains, we ordered the fish chelo kebab (really good, but too big for one person), the pesto prawns (delicious, succulent and flavourful) and the grilled bhetki with garlic bread (again, soft flaky fish in a balsamic dressing: perfect!).
The servers were also courteous, attentive and knowledgeable. Will definitely be coming back to try their Indian/Bengali fare.

Verdict: If you're a fish lover (and which Bengali isn't?), this place is a must-try. The pesto prawns, especially, are highly recommended!

The service is pathetic here and the food a bit overpriced. We went there around 2 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. We were a group of 3 and we wanted a slightly bigger table but they refused with a plain lie saying those are reserved. Of course, no one turned up for another 1 hours 15 min, while we were there. We initially ordered 3 dishes and finally we wanted a 4th dish which was fish batter fry. But to our surprise, it took full 20 minutes when there was no other guest. May be the cook was taking a nap. I am only giving 2 stars because the chitol dish was tasty.

Before I write a review I would like to state that I went there based only on the review of Rocky and Mayur of NDTV Good times. Location near the Goriahat more and instead of swinehoe we can use 13/5 anil moitra road its the same thing.  Decor is very very good of course as in whole of kolkata from the exterior we cannot see the diamond inside.  The staff are courteous and polite and quick in service the Ac was working fine. The food was just wow lot of things in the menu but I went for  CHINGRI BHUNA which  cost me 190 and a king sized jumbo prawn to give me company, Rice at Rs  60 was enough but I would like to try the badam bhat, MAKHMALI FISH  ( bhekti fish)Rs 325  left a everlasting tast it was soft and as the name goes makhmali  was just right.  I would love to come again with and taste the eternal dining experience. at last the chocolate firni normally associated with mughlai cuisine but this chocolate firni was the masterpiece of the chef .So fish fish is way above its contemporaries

Swinhoe Street in ballygaunj area is a heaven for food lovers because one and only fish based restaurant in kolkata- 'Fish Fish' and one of the finest bengali cuisine- 'Kasturi' are located here side by side. This time we took a chance to explore this fish based restaurant. And the experience turned out to be delightful. Chitol seek kabab-thinly sliced fish kabab blended nicely with herbs and spices tasted superb with tamarind and pudina chutney as dips. Posto chingri was lip smacking. And vetki kalia went well with plain rice. The menu contains a lavish spred of different types of fishes b@oth traditional bengali and fusion preparation. This place deserves few more visits for proper exploration.
The negative aspect is their washroom which is very awkward and their service is slow.

This is a new fish restaurant in Kolkata & first time I went to a restaurant serving fish-only. We Bengalis always love to eat fish every day in our meal. This is the place where traditional food comes with a modern twist which is good. It is a very small restaurant with limited tables and food taste was good. The price little bit higher in the range which is obvious. I hope I will be there in the near future for trying more fish dishes.

I would say very good overall. 
Had makhmali kebab. Nice. Mild. 
And Chitol kebab with cheese filling. Tasted good. Had few fish bones though.
And banspora prawn ... Tasted good. Lacked the bamboo smell though. And the gravy tasted awesome but with rice it was not that good. Rice had a smell that over powered.
Then fish parmesan and grilled fish - from continental bucket. Really good. Permesan had bit salty though.
Have a good assortment with Bengali style. Continental style. Chinese options. Plus you have malabar and goan. Also you have wide varieties of fishes ... Bhetki. Ilish. Prawn. Aar. Boal. Pabda. Parshe. Chitol. Koi. Need few more trips to this place to have all tasted

Visited today for dinner. We had prawn cocktail, fish fry with tarter sauce and fish chello platters. The starters were awesome in taste but somehow i feel the quantity of food (especially what they serve in prawn cocktail) is not as much as the price of the food items. As for the Fish Chello, the kebabs and tandoori were very tasty but i didn't like the butter rice much. May be i have tasted much better chellos elsewhere. Overall its kinda overpriced depending on the quantity of food they serve. Otherwise its a very nice place with awesome fish delicacies, nice ambiance and very warm hospitality. A must visit one for all the fish lovers out there.

This was the first time i went to a restaurant serving fish-only delicacies. We started with Ajwani Machi Tikka for starter. And for main course we had Chitol Macher Muitha ( chitol fish rolled into balls) and Icha Pulao. The Ajawani Machi Tikka was superb, soft and tasty. So was the pulao made with shrimp. The pulao was mildly sweet which we liked a lot. But I was a bit disappointed with the the Chitol Macher Muitha. I have had better Muitha preparations at our neighbor's places. The decor was nice with pata-chitras decorating the walls.

Cons:

What really disappointed me was the facilities of the restaurant. It had a  Tiny (with a capital T) washroom to used by both men and women. There was hardly any space in the washroom and what was worse, it was directly beside the kitchen. After seeing that, I lost all respect for the place's cleanliness. There was no hand-drier either. I would have given the restaurant a 4/5 rating had its facilities been better, but any place with such abysmal facilities deserves no better than 3.

Rating :

Food : 4/5

Service : 4/5

Decor : 3/5

Facilities : 1/5

Price : 3.5/5

I forgot to write review for this FISHY food joint where I went at Durgapuja n was very surprised to see dat no one waiting outside at even d lunch hr. It was a very good bangali food restaurant n for all fishes....7 on 10. Only 3 cut marks cz many was complaining about Ilish Paturi...too much spicy n fish quality was not up to the mark some how. We took derahdun rice,plain moong dal,jhuri aluvaja,ruhi kaliya,chingri malaikari n ilish paturi. 
Only one complain I have. Even in rush lunch hrs,you serve very slowly n your excuse is as you serve all hot items,it takes time to prepare a fresh plate. But to me,its only an excuse cz I didn't get all foods very hot. 
But over all its a very good bangali food joint n my one of d favourites.

মাছে ভাতে বাংলী ....the dedication thats there in a bong for his fish and rice, I would have never understood if i had not stayed away from home. With the craving pounding everyday FISH is all that i want on visit to Kolkata and other than home if there's one place to devour and satisfy my palate it's indeed Fish Fish...
I tried their Hilsa platter and simply loved the taste,the fragrance the presentation..the daal fries and chutney ....absolutely the way a bong would cook it....living out of the country I had often wondered why we bengalies never endeavour to promote our delicacies....was really happy to find this one not only promoting our cuisine but the interior so intricately planned in perfect harmony with the theme...a fishy affair it is indeed.
Last but not the least honestly speaking i was quiet surprised at the moderate pricing..was expecting much more in our bill....
Surely will come back and hope to savour some more new items on the menu by then.

Already made your dining out plan for the four days in Puja? Take it from us and reschedule your plan to drop a visit at least one day at Fish Fish this puja. If you are a traditional Bengali man and can’t think of eating anything but typical Bengali food during the puja then Fish Fish is the best option. Their special staples (sandhi puja) of traditional Bengali fish items include Badam Pulao, Chingri Pulao, Elish Pulao and lot more.

Fish Fish will also serve you some lip smacking Puja Maha Thali (Anjali) during the Puja.

The amazing preparation of Chingri Mach diye Moong Dal is a must try at Fish Fish. To sooth down your body after such rich foods sip a glass of Gondhoraj Ghol.

The food speaks for itself, and it’s no surprise with acclaimed Chef Debasish Kundu heading the culinary team. Kickstart your meal with the Makhmali Fish Tikka, meltingly decadent vetki served with dips, or the Chitol Seekh Kebab, an excellent appetizer of thinly-sliced fish kebabs, with flavours amplified by a herbs and spices. Then, dig in to their special — Lobster malai curry. Indulgent, rich, and slightly creamy, the flavours of the ocean will explode in your mouth. There’s no better place to bring your favourite friend or that special someone who loves Bengali food.

The price of the food may seem slightly high but the mouth watering dishes are worth giving a try at least for one day during puja. If you are going with your pals in the evening try out Jambo Tandoori Prawn with sauce as a starter. This is the kinda place for those who want to have fun with their food, certainly not for fish critics! Come for a fun date or a night out with picky friends.

As a fish lover, went there with high expectations. The ambience is good with fish dishes hanging around the wall (I meant pictures). I had ilish bhapa, begun, dal and bhat. The size of the ilish was beyond my expectations ( it was very large) but as I went there in off season, I didn't like the taste of it. The waiters can help u with there dishes and trust them, they are good at it. We had other dishes too in starters and main course. ( Sorry couldn't remember the name though). IMO the prices are little high. . we had a bill of 1200 for 2 persons.

What more can a true Bong want when he is served with most delicious fish platters. The fish platter was great. The bhetki was soft and melted in the mouth. The pomfret and the prawns were perfectly cooked too. What I loved the most was the fish sizzler which I had ordered for. The big chunk of fish complemented by veggies and mushrooms was quite exotic. The restaurant has a fine blend of Bengali and continental cuisines. The ambience is nice. Service is good. I would say its little expensive but when that Bhetki melts in your mouth you are no more in a position to complain. Recommended for all Maach lovers. :)

It's a place where I love to go back. Tried all the  non-indian dishes till date. My favourite is grilled fish permesan with garlic bread. at times they take time to deliver the food on time, but ultimate satisfaction takes place when i SEE the food on the plate. prawn stroganoff is another absolute favourite. AND, the fisherman's basket! Last time what I remember, I did let my friend (who was accompnaying me, poor thing, could not eat much) touch one or two fries and that's it! Fried ice-cream is mouth watering.

Loved everything about this place.
It's pretty small restaurant with limited tables...and ambience wise its decent...but the food and also the service would simply win your hearts.

Started with soup we had Prawns Mulligatawyn...and it was awesome..simply loved it...#must try
In starters we had tandoori chilli fish...this was heavenly...it was Betki fish cooked in tandoor...the texture of the fish was soft and melting in mouth...#must try
Then we had BBQ prawn with burnt garlic salsa...this was not that good. #ignore

Main course we tried chingri mater bas paturi...this was a pleasant surprise and Kankra kosha (crab) was perfect...the gravy was perfect was everything complimented it really well.
We tried 'bhat' rice..and were happy that we did not had the order traditional naan or other breads.
Well loved the Bengali preparation and eating fish with rice...not common in other parts of India...was a good decision 

CONCLUSION: Definitely visit this place once...you would leave with smiling face :-D

Bongs and Fish are like eternal love. And after visiting this place even a non-bong would fall in love with Fish.
This is the place where traditional food comes with a modern twist, and the result is simply lip smacking.
We had prawn malai kebab(tandoor) , rice, moong dal, topshe bhaja, posto chingri, pata pora ilish and notun gurer ice cream.
Each and every dish was made excellent.
I just wish the price was little pocket friendly. So people can try out more dishes.

We have tried makhmali fish tikka and chitol Sikh kabab ..it was really good.. Unfortunately when we ordered maha thali after first two three items apart from rice daal and topshey fry balance items were horrible.. Prawn was unhygienic nor even cleaned properly .. Ilish was also horrible nor only the taste the quality of the fish too. And the other fishes were also not fresh all 12 of us who were there gave the same feedback .. Pretty bad experience about the maha thali..and on this day u can not opt for.any normal menu items..

Wanted to visit the place since read about it in zomato. Finally been there on ekadoshi for lunch with family. Must say it's an amazing place. Ambience is good. Nothing too special about interiors. The main thing is food and it's unbeatable. We ordered fish fry as starter. The for main course we ordered a Maha thali (pujo spl I guess) baansh pora chingri, gondhoraj bhetki and chocolate firni as desert. Gondhoraj bhetki is so amazing that I have fallen in love with it. Chingri was also good. The thali was pretty loaded. Too many items. The chingri dalna and ilish was mouthwatering. Liked the chatni too. Last but not the least, the chocolate firni is something I can die for. Will surely visit again. Will recommend too.

Went with the person who recommended this place ( and the earlier recommendations were fantabulous). Liked the ambience but being an ardent "foodaholic" didn't like food ...
My orders were 
Chitol macher roast ( starter...m8 not b the exact name) - fish was rubbery and not fresh at all
Chingri pulao - rice overcooked and chingris came with the shell !!!
Bhetki masala - okay dish ...fish was good but again no decor / garnishing
Gondhoraj steamed bhetki - BURNT AND SERVED!!!
Chocolate Firni - With due respect to the cook I like my firni "jomaate" and not like "gajar ka halwa"

Pretty ordinary food atleast as far as the pujo menu and that day's serving is concerned.

Actually i am a fish lover guy. Hearing the name fish fish i went there but wat i got over there is totally unexpected, i tried there 3 recipes,  prawn cocktail, crab fried rice and mix seafood nasi goreng.  Prawn cocktail have a nice garnishing and presentation but the meo they use is 3rd grade,  crab fried rice is soaked in ghee and taste awful and lastly nasi goreng was terrible of all it was a disaster,  it stinks like foul fish.  i asked the manager about the smell he told me its natural bcuz for the use of shrimp paste, whatever it may be but it cant be that bad,  i can guarantee no one will like it. hours after i complete dinner i can still get that stinky smell. Don't waste your money atleast don't try any Thai or continental dishes.

It's BAD!
The fish in most cases stink. Do not order hilsa because what they serve is remotely anything like hilsa.
The only positive is that the price is reasonable but then if the food is bad, how would reasonable pricing help.
The quality has deteriorated with time and hopefully the management will try fixing it.
The service though is good. Hoping for a better experience in future.

Being an ardent fan of bengali cuisine visited this place on the eve of my mothers birthday after going through the menu in zomato.
The place is very near to 6 ballygunje :)
We entered the place at around 7:15pm.The ambiance of the place is good,though would have prefered a lil more dim light.we ordered prawn fry with namchin sauce as starter.it had 6 medium sized prawns and tasted awesome.It was soft and juicy -too good starter.Next for main course we had shorshe bhetki,kakra kosha n plain rice. Bhetki shorshe was not only tasty but the amount was good too.it had 4 big pieces of bhetki.kakra kosha was fine too but the other two dishes were better.
At last for dessert we had my fav notun gurer icecream-a scoup big enough for 2 persons .
The total bill amounted to Rs 1651/- for 4people.so i would like give 5/5 for price:-)keep up the good work:-)

I was here this Saturday afternoon during my trip to Kolkata. This restaurant is located next to Kasturi Restaurant in Ballygunge and is a small place that can accommodate about 35-40 people at a time. Decor was minimal which is okay, but unfortunately there was Bollywood music playing (not sure if it was off the radio).

I was the first guest in the restaurant and reached before Sui Bun who was going to join me. The last few days in Kolkata have been hot as it has not been raining, so without wasting much time I asked the waiter for a Gondhoraj Ghol, a Sweet Lassi infused with Gondhoraj Lime. The drink was refreshing, instantly beating the hot weather.

Once Sui Bun joined me, we ordered a Bhapa Hilsa, Kankra Kosha Jhol and Rice. The food took a little while before it was served but it was worth the wait. Being a fan of the legendary Mustard and Coconut based pastes of Bengal, I loved the taste of the Bhapa Hilsa. The fish was yum. But I'm not a fan of bones, as it slows down my eating (not complaining, as I was told about this and I signed up for it). Great dish nevertheless!!

The Kankra Kosha Jhol was a hot spicy Crab curry prepared in a Bengali style. The crab meat was sweet and definitely fun and messy to eat as it was served in its shell!

While we were in the middle of our crab, we ordered another dish - Stir Fried Prawns in Butter and Garlic. This was something what would not go with the other items we had ordered, and hence we chose to have it at the end of the meal. The prawns were big, juicy and chunky. The stir fried vegetables served with it were tossed nicely in butter and the garlic flavor was kicking!

With all that food in us, we didn't need to order any dessert. Damages for this meal was slightly under INR 1,500 for two people and I felt we could have easily wrapped up the meal for around INR 1,000 had we not been too lavish with our ordering.

On a scale of 5, my ratings are:

A. Food - 3.5
B. Ambiance - 3.0
C. Service - 4.0
D. Wait Time - 3.5
E. Value for Money - 4.0

With an overall rating of 3.5!

I recommend this place to anyone looking out for delicious seafood prepared in Bengali or Continental styles at an affordable price!

Anyway, we went there to have lunch during the Monsoon festival time and the Queen of Monsoon was no surprise to find its way to our platter.
All the items we ordered for were of a high quality.The Ilish Bhapa & The Bhetki Starter were awesome.
I hope to hit the place soon again & recommend it those who have a special craving for variety of Fish Items.

It was difficult whether to mark this fish joint a 3 or 3.5 upon 5. The menu is interesting and unique but only untill the food appear on your table. The fish sizzler was a big let down for it had only a thin fillet of bhetki and that too with a stink. However, the chitol machher sheekh kebab and prawn fritters are a treat for your gastronomical senses. Especially the latter for its rich cheese filling .The Thai rice fish combo was good though too less in quantity for a full grown man's appetite. 
I was here for my mothers birthday and I must say, it wasn't a successful choice for the quality of food was not as expected or according to the price.

Fish fish...ilish ilish. We landed at this restaurant on a rainy evening...and it was "Borshaboron"  going on here. I am definitely a fish maniac....the cuisine laid out for barshaboron celebrated hilsa, crab and prawns in our lives....and these are no less than "food gods"(if I may use that term) in most Bengali's lives. Padma Kuri Bata diye Ilish....uff...fantastic...so was ilish machher pata pora. Kankra kosha was just the way a Bengali would have it. Baked crab was exceptionally done. Ilish sizzler was something different we tried and it worked out wonderfully well. Fisherman's basket provides a fish lover with a variety of fried fish items. Add to this the mustard sauce...really good for the taste buds. Their desserts need special mention...Nalen Gurer Ice Cream and Toffee with makhana and vanilla...exceptional. Good food at a reasonably good price. The service was admirable too.

Visited this place two months back...The taste and quality of the fish were excellent. However this restaurant is slightly overpriced and we were not satisfied with the quantity they served. We ordered-
1. Fisherman's basket which consisted of fried calamari, prawn,pomfret, and topshe. This is a signature dish of Fish Fish.
2.Tandoori Prawns which consisted of about six pieces of juicy and succulent prawns. 
3.Grilled Fish Parmesan with garlic bread: It was average
4. Two combo meals which comprised of Ghee bhaat, dal, begun bhaaja, topshe bhaja chutney
5. Tel koi
6.Nolen gurer ice-cream. Extremely overpriced according to the quantity but overall good

If your looking to savour on fish then this next door restaurant is the place to be. The experimental dishes are quite tempting and has an unique blende of taste and aroma which leaves your palate tingling. However am yet to try a few dishes which I guess aren't available all year round. Shall confirm further after tasting the same.
One word of advice to the management. The cuisine being fishes, the national food of Bengalis, light old Bengali music should do better than English or Hindi numbers

I'm not at all into seafood and usually have never tried fish anywhere outside home but this is one of the few places I have. I was with one of my closest friend and she loves prawns a lot. The ambience seemed elegant and the tables are arranged in a fine manner.

The preparations were of top notch quality and the prices are well justified. I loved the way the plate is decorated and it all looked exquisite to be honest. It's a must try restaurant in Ballygunge and would definitely recommend to all.

Being a bong and a fish lover it's a place which attracted me with its name Fish Fish. Have been here with my husband for lunch. They have very limited variety in there menu however have not deviated from the fish thing which is fair enough. Had ordered Ilish bhapa,  English fish fry with tartar sauce,  crab fried rice,  Mongolian fish, nolen gurer ice cream. Food was tasty however the service was pretty slow. The concept of the ice cream was good and tasty infact. The quantity of food isn't that sumptuous. So overall good to visit just once if have to consider the large number of options for fish lovers available in Kolkata.

It's a delight for fish lovers! Though I don't have too much of an inclination towards it,I made it a point to visit this place during the Hilsa festival and it was sheer joy exploring the super tasty dishes. The ambience needs to be worked on, and I found the staff particularly on that day to be a little unfriendly. But I forgot everything after that first bite of Hilsa fry!!

Pros:
1. The menu, truly thoughtful items
2. A place for fish lovers, great concept

Cons:
1. Only fish sight taste and odour around you, so if you are fasting, etc.. wait till you are in a fishy state of mind. Do not bring people who are resistant to fish.
2. Exhaust system is required in dining area, the sizzlers smoke up the place and it is impossible to breathe. Owners please take note and look into this.

Bharti wala machhi's bhetki was not good at all. However we doubt if it was bhetki at all. Other than this the BBQ prawn, fish gilauti kebab and Singaporean chilly crab was very good. I would have rated the place as a 4.5 but due to the bhetki I would rate it as 3.5 as if you pay for good quality food you ought to expect good raw materials!

I have been to this place only once. My cousins suggested me to visit this place. It's a restaurant which serves only fish items and nothing else. Unlike my cousins I didn't find food to be 'too' good for my liking.

A small little place which id big on quality and quantity. I went for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. The menu has a large variety of dishes,right from their soups to their desserts. Bear in mind that they serve only fish and nothing else.There are some unusual dishes like chitol macher sheek kabab, fish gilouti kabab. We had the seafood risotto and grilled parmesan fish and prawn tempura. All the dishes were well presented and in sizeable quantity. The service is good. Overall, a place definitely worth a visit.

As the name suggests, this joint is all about fish. Started off with BBQ Prawns and Chittol Macher Seekh Kebab. Both excellent! Followed those up with Betki stuffed with Legumes and Pepper Grilled Betki. Again, Stuffed Betki super awesome and like nothing I tasted before! Grill Fish was good too. Aam-pora sherbat was ther to gulp the food down. Finishing touch was provided by Chocolate Firney - again like nothing I tasted before, Super Good! All these at a total bill of 2300INR. 
Only little blip, if I can call it that, was the non availability of certain items on the menu. Hope that would be taken care off, next time I visit!

Being a Bong outside Kolkata, the name of this place is tempting enough enough to warrant a visit. I visited the place on a weekday night. To my surprise it was completely empty, that too around 9 PM. However I have to say that does not speak anything about the food here.

We started off with the Fisherman's basket as a starter. It was more than enough for 3 people. To be very true it was a little too much for 3 people. The fresh taste of a variety of fried fish still makes my mouth water. We followed it off with  Grilled fish Parmesan with Garlic Bread (Fillet of Bhetki in Parmesan sauce grilled to perfection..Ahh! Bliss!!) and a Combo Meal (Topse Bhaja, Chingri Macher Malai Curry, Begun Bhaja, Ghee Bhat, Dal and Chutney). Every item of the combo meal was perfect. The awesome ghee used gave the rice and dal an aroma that I have never experienced before. The plating was really awesome and deserves a pat on the back.

The icing on the cake was their in-house Natun Gur-er Ice cream. Now I have tasted Nolen gurer Icecream at many places. The trend started if I am not wrong with Bhojo Hari Manna. However I can say blindly, this was the best Nolen Gurer Icecream I have ever tasted. The Ice-cream had bits or Nolen Gurer Sandesh inside it that made all the difference. Kudos to the concept. I am pretty sure next time I go, I will save a lot more space to have more ice-cream.

Overall, a very pleasurable experience. I will definitely visit this place again and again, when ever I goto Kolkata. A well deserved 4.5. however I will give it a 5 due to the nostalgia associated with the fish and the ice-cream.

Wanted to try out this place, as the name itself was very tempting. :) And, we were really in for a surprise. We had ordered  Chingri Bhapa Combo meal, which came along with dal, begun bhaja and chutney, and along with that, we had also ordered chitol kaliya. Though it is slightly expensive, infact more expensive than its neighbour, 6 Ballygunge Place, the food was really worth every paisa. Would especially mention the begun bhaja and the chitol kaliya, which formed an exception to the rule 'good things come in small packages'. It was, what I would call, 'huge'. The chingri bhapa had four medium (more towards large) size chingris. And I must mention, every dish left a lingering memory on our tastebuds, and every dish was FRESH and steaming hot! 
After finishing lunch, I almost felt like someone would have to carry me home! I don't generally like experimenting with new places, but this one time, I surely found great results! :D

Fish Fish. The name will draw any fish lover to at least try the food in this restaurant.
Tucked in 1 corner of the city, this place is a heaven for die hard fish eaters.
On entering the place, all you can see is fish. The decor and sitting arrangement is simple.
Not a very big place. The menu is elaborate though. 
It is a bit confusing what to order because you would want to try everything at once.
Realizing that it is not possible, we decided to order an entire Lobster.
The staff was very helpful and they helped us choose which lobster we wanted and why there was a price difference.
It is good to know what you are eating :)
The lobster was just out of the world. Very nice plating and amazing flavors.
The place is a little pricy but the taste would not will let you forget about the money for some time :)
It is really difficult to wait for the food to arrive on the table because you could smell different flavors all the time.

We loved everything about the place and the food.
I would recommend it to my friends and would love to visit again.

Thank you Fish Fish!

A complete dining experience for sea food lovers in Kolkata. Although the service was a bit delayed.. But it was definitely worth the wait! We ordered for coriander soup which had fish chunks, moderately sized prawns (not shrimps) and squid. Then we ordered an assorted tandoori platter which had one medium tiger prawn, a pomfret, two baby squids and two bhetki pieces.. Although it wasn't original bhetki.. But for the price one pays and the quantity of the platter it isnt tht bad too.. Lastly we had a baked whole bhetki stuffed with cheese n mushroom served wid the perfectly boiled veggies presented beautifully! Fishfish has really won my heart! A must visit for all fish lovers who dnt mind a little bit of naak shetkano!

If you are a die hard fish fan then this is the place. Good location. Price is slightly on the higher side. The quality of fish they will provide is amazing. Cooked to perfection. Nothing much of an ambiance and decor. Coming to the food, In starters we ordered Tandoori Prawns and the prawns were cooked beautifully. In the main course we had ordered stuffed Bhetki with legumes and Steamed pomfret. I loved the Bhetki with legumes, This dish is highly recommended. The Bengali food with rice is also good. They do have some great combos. This place is highly recommended for fish lovers.

I being a foodie try several restaurants. But I'm not a big fan of fish. But last day my brother and I had gone to this restaurant thinking the place will have other items in menu other than fish, like chicken and all. But to my surprise this place only deals with fish. Not only that but the fish cooked over there is just awesome and even the non-fish lovers will just love it.

If you are a fish lover, then  this is a must visit. They have so many variety of fish items, I have never seen any where before. Unlike other places, they are perfectly cooked and not over cooked which is very important for any testy food and specially continental items. Ambiance is good; though don't expect something like Marco Polo as the space is not too big. Also the price is reasonable and cheaper than Oh! Calcutta or Mainland China.

Had a terrible experience out here when went to try out this fishfish, Kolkatas only fish restaurant just b4 Pujo.

Have ordered for a Chingri & Hilsa thali..Both were awful.
Never have wasted ilish & chingri ever in life being a true blue bong, but here the taste of the food was so yak, that finally had to leave that place empty stomach and that too after shelling out more than 1.5k for 2 sick meals.

Both the hilsa & prawn was not fresh, chingri was really smelling foul & the mustard paste was bitter in taste.

When complained the same to the  manager  he dint even bother to listen, spoke instead it cant be as they have high regards for their own chef/people..Not for the customers it seems.

Utter disappointment what i have heard or what hype the created about themselves when the launched in Swinhoe street,,
Would suggest all my friends/family never ever to try out anything in Fishfish.

We went to Fish Fish on Sasthi this year, four friends, meeting over lunch. Three of us stay away from Calcutta and wanted to dig into Bengali food. Fish Fish proved to be a very good choice made by us. We ordered Aampora Shorbot. The cool green drink was such a welcome one. Next we ordered Chitol Maachher Sheek Kebab and Bhetki Fry as starter. The Chitol was yummy and Fish Fry was, as expected, delicious. Main course was rice, daal with prawn and prawn cooked in bamboo stem. Amazing taste. Loved it. The price was well worth it. The total bill came to Rs2800 for the four of us. 
Will come back again

Have often wondered what is so degradingly secretive about the fishes that we often relate them to conspiratorial whispers and secrets that tend to be annoying! The restaurant "Fish Fish " , with its spartan walls done in white and grey and tables in contrasting shade of black, in no way has a secretive feel about the place. The bright lights too add to the cheerfulness and vibrancy of the place and make for a pleasurable dining experience for all those who choose to visit.

The menu card is a colourful one designed in the shape of a fish and reminds one of the list that accompanies the bride's trousseau at a Bengali wedding! As regards the items on the menu card, we went during the Pujas when there was a special Bengali menu available and their standard fares were not. The Topshe fry was deliciously crispy and barring the bones that needed to be picked, was succulent to taste. I also liked the chitol kebabs- a Novel way of cooking chitol peti and also very good to taste!
The main course was however a bit of a letdown with the Prawn malai curry little too spicy and more reddish than we Bengalis are accustomed to. The Baked Bhetki gondhoraj, probably an attempt to emulate that heavenly offering of one of the better known restaurants of Kolkata (and probably of the country now), was nowhere near its original! The cloned dish, available here, had too much cheese and was too watery. Despite the Bhetki being fresh and flaky and the essence of Gondhoraj coming through in spurts, it failed to charm it's way into the heart. The Bhetki paturi, fish wrapped in Banana leaf and layered with mustard, was the only dish that warmed the cockles of our heart.

I intend to go back to this place again, to give the other dishes on its menu, those that were out of bounds for us on the day, a try. It is also probable that the chefs were tired after a hard and gruelling five days of working overtime during the festivities!
Come to think of it, I actually don't need an excuse to go back. I would go back to this place, simply because- I love all that is fishy!

Fish-Fish, May your tribe increase!

16th Oct 2014 : I was back, sooner than i had anticipated and was mighty pleased witb myself for having made the wise decision of not tarrying a day longer ! This place is a veritable treasure trove waiting to be explored by all fish lovers! The sea food salad opened up the taste buds with the pungency and the sour flavour and whetted the appwtite that wee bit more! Then came the Calamari coated in a layer of batter and tasting of beautiful kasundi. The main course   was suggested by the staff and consisted of grilled fish with pepper and served with garlic bread and mashed potato. Then came my wife's choice-stuffed Beckti with legume.If the first was excellent, the Beckti out of the world and left us fumbling for words to praise it. 

A suggestion for the restaurant to make the diners' experience worthwhile-Why dont you introduce a live station for diners to pick their fish or crabs?

Good restaurant but not good enough to compete with other restaurants in the vicinity. Food was good but there are not many choices in the menu. We ordered one of the thalis  but it neither consisted of   chutney nor mistidoi or paan. Bengali cuisine has it's own characteristics which should not be ignored while setting the menu for buffet or thali.

If you are a fish lover then there is no place better than this. A bit expensive but as it says every thing has its own price. Superb quality food rather fish. I ordered for a Prawn Tandoori and a stuffed bhetki with rice and believe me the food was like awesome. Both the preparations was like, I just can't express in word. And last but not the least was the desert. Uff what a feel it was to have the fried ice cream, hot from the out side and cold inside...
Simply awesome...
 Just visited for the 5th time (27th Feb'15)...

first , being a bong and all that, I was always in love with my fishy platter , so this place was on my wish list for almost 6 months. Finally, one stormy afternoon I got the chance to drop in . The menu was a delight, so many choices in my favourite form of protein, "FISH". I was alone so cud not sample much of it. I went ahead and ordered tandoori prawns which was heavenly , just grilled to the right yummy perfection, not to chewy but buttery soft and delicious. For main course(as I was not too hungry) I ordered English fried fish with the tartar dip.. the dip was creamy and had perfect consistency. Now I know the right place in Kolkata for all my visiting friends and relatives from different parts of the world who want to understand the madness Bengalis have for fish. Service was a bit time consuming and the décor was ok, but, the food made it up for me! will be back again for more!

This review was long due. I had been to Fish Fish a long time back and have had a few occasions to carry out the food. The restaurant is quaint, but can only say about 20-25 people at a given time. I visited the restaurant on a Saturday evening, so had to wait for about 15 minutes to get seated. I'm not sure if they accept prior reservations, but if the do, then I would definitely recommend doing the same, especially if you are there on a weekend.
Now this restaurant is typically for those who loves fish. It's infact a boon to us Bengalis. Our love for fish is something the world knows of, and this is one of those rare places where you can appease your hunger for fish.
Some people complain about their menu lacking authentic Bengali fish preparations, but I find the menu quite exciting with a good mix of Bengali, north Indian, Chinese and Continental preparations.
Anyway we were two people and ordered for tandoori prawns, chilly fish, stuffed fish with legumes and grilled fish parmesan. We didn't want any rice or bread, as we only wanted to indulge in fish. The chilly fish was nice, ss expected. The stuffed fish was a disappointment though. It had a strong fishy smell and I didn't quite like the stuffing. The grilled fish was good and had lots of cheese. Both the continental preparations were accompanied by garlic bread.
The winner however was the tandoori prawn. Respectable sized prawns perfectly fine on the tandoor was enough to make us forget about all the other preparations. Infact, so impressed were we that we ordered for another helping and my friend also placed an order of the same for carry out. This is a sure winner for all those who love prawns and I would urge everyone to try it once.
On a second occasion, I ordered for hot garlic fish, fish butter masala and ofcourse, the tandoori prawns. We had steamed rice to go with the fish preparations. My parents went berserk over the tandoori prawns. The fish butter masala and the garlic fish were also, just as should be done.
On a third occasion, I got to try the chingri malaicurry and boy, that was a revelation. It's a typical Bengali favorite and was perfectly done with a rich coconut gravy.
The prices may seem a bit steep, but I'm actually happy that the fish pieces are decent sized and good for two adults mostly. Writing this review makes me yearn for the tandoori prawn and I guess I need to make a visit soon.

I really fail to understand whats all the hype about this place. After hearing a lot, one fine Sunday evening I landed up to this restaurant for dinner, Surprisingly we were the only customers for that evening I guess. Decoration wise it was ok. But the food was very poor judging by both quality and quantity and overpriced too. We started off with Smoked Salmon Salad. Under cooked vegetables served with four pcs of salmon. Not at all impressive. The waiter was courteous enough to serve all the four pieces to my girlfriend and only substandard vegetables to me. Anyway for the main course we ordered Prawn Stroganoff and Pan Grilled Pomfret with Pesto. The stroganoff was served it a handful for rice maybe and stale cheese (I personally didn't like the taste at all). On the other hand 2 pcs of pomfret (possibly the same fish - both sides) and again under cooked vegetables. I was totally disgusted by the food but unfortunately ended up paying around 1200 INR for nothing. We actually had Chicken Roll from outside as we were still hungry.

I am NOT going back there for sure.

Fish fish is very special to me coz it's from here that i got food for my first major family treat and they were super impressed. :) For starters we had the makhmali fish, seafood pop with burnt garlic salsa & cheese filled kebabs. All of them were delicious, the best among them being the kebabs. In the main course the prawn stroganoff was outstanding and is a must try if u r a first time diner there. The seafood pasta with creamy garlic salsa was good too but since it tastes almost similar to the stroganoff, i suggest u get either of the two. All pictures are posted herewith so do have a look. Next comes the fish in lemon coriander which was quite good, a nice try if u r a fan of sour tasting preparations. Finally, there was the chilli crab, which fared not so well as the crab meat wasn't tasty enough. Now, interiors were decently done, a had a cozy feel. Good to take your date out for dinner but best for a family visit. Your folks will be impressed and that's for sure. :)

Fish Fish, Ballygunge Place, Kolkata

From the time we landed in Kolkata , our extended relatives just could not stop raving about Fish Fish the new fish concept restaurant in town. Finally we managed to find Fish Fish in an obscure corner of a tight alley called Arun Moitro road in Ballygunge Place. Thanx to an excellent driver we managed to located it and grab a table. Pictures of the joint give a very fishing sort of a look with nets and a pair of rows. 
The menu was a foodies delight especially a Fishy guy like me. With no time wasted we ordered a prawn cocktail. As I have said before, I declare, very few chefs ( in the country)  can rustle up a great Prawn cocktail. This is something I bait the chef’s with in  order rank them in their standard.  The Prawn cocktail at Rs.250/- per martini glass was a steal compared to Mumbai standards. Presentation wise it was not too good looking as it seemed a tad bit too gooey. The Mayo and ketchup was excellently mixed with a hint of spice ( nope it wasn’t tabasco) and tasted superb. The prawns were fresh water ones and very tasteful, sweet and meaty and larger than life from what we get in Mumbai. Wife and I polished off all of it including the garnishing of lettuce, mint and red leafy spinach.  There after we ordered a Chotol Macher Sheek Kebab at Rs.250/- per plate. This was a gastronomical delight in texture as it was chunkily wrapped about just like a mutton seek kebab, tasted so wholesome and evenly marinated. Wow! Wow!! Loved it. Wife and I swiped it off in a jiffy polishing off the plate. 
Main Course for me was a dilemma as to whether I should go for a al carte of dal, Tarkari ( Subzi), Mach ( Fish) and Rice. Time was short, hunger and greed got the better of me and I decided to go for the Combo of Topshe Bhaja, Chingri Macher Mmalai Curry, Begun Bhaja, Dal, Rice and Chutney at Rs.450/-. Wife ordered just a Kankra( Crab)  Kosha at Rs.350/-
The Topshe was superb! The Begun bhaja was just perfect and ,Malai Curry was absolutely perfect. The Dal balanced off with is subtle blandness yet well done. I was mesmerized by the concoction. The Chutney was the best. The helping was too tiny so I asked for a separate plate of chutney for wife at Rs.40/- . All my Aunts ( Pishi, Mashi, Jethi and Kaki’s) and my Mum make the best of bong chutney but this Cashew Aamatto Date Chutney was the best I ever had in my life. Not many of my aunts or even mum would concu but who cares: This was the BEST!! 
Now for the Chef de Resistance – Kosha Kankra…………The Crabs were no where good as the ones we are used to in Mumbai but the thick onion paste gravy Kosha was just superb. I kept on licking my fingers. All the items eaten /tasted had a hint of bong sugar in them and a subtle touch of chilli powder.
Its been a long time since we ate such great food. Kudos to Chef Debashish Kundu whose idea and concept it is in the spirit of Fish Fish. Guys, when I Kolkata Do not ever miss this joint otherwise you will never know what the taste of heaven is ………….!!!

Ambience – 10/10  Warm, Cozy, Bright & Clean ( On the Road and yet no Flies!!!)

Menu – 9/10 Excellent concoction and taste buds based inventiveness  

Taste – 10/10 

Customer Service – 7/10 Good 

Value for Money – 8/10 

Recommend –  Don’t ever miss this place!!! It’s a bongs Heaven in the modern sense!

FishFish had been on our wish list for long. For two main reasons: we are fish-lovers and this is a restaurant serving fish and also we are dying to taste the authentic Fish and Chips (the TLC way). So, last Sunday, my partner took me here for a date.
We started off with our much coveted English Fried Fish with Tarter dip , that came closest in the menu. It was nothing but two fish fries ( bangla ones with bread-crumbs, sans the strong ginger masala ). I have had better ones made at home. Disappointed. For the main course, we ordered Mediterranean Salmon, which tasted odd with the tamarind sticky sauce and some of the veggies bitter. The savior of the day was Poddokuri bata diye ilish mach with rice. Coconut based gravy, tasted nice. Ilish was good too, though one piece ( not that i expected more ).
Ambiance and service was good. Prices are okay ( higher side, but that is the standard for fish these days ). Not overwhelmed because some of the preparations let us down. But the fish is fresh. A good place for fish lovers.

As the name suggests the place is for fish lovers. It's difficult to find and required my GPS to find it. Even before I could start with the fish the lemon flavored lassi bowled me.

A true Bengali is known by his love for fish and philosophy. While the latter is served fresh in local tea stalls and evening chat sessions, the former is being catered with care in Fish Fish. A small restaurant with a heart for all the 'fish'y affairs of Bengali cuisine, Fish Fish does a very good job in Kolkata food-scenario. If you like having fish in your platter, you will end in loving it once you step out of this joint.
To start with the food, their seafood-coriander soup has a quintessential flavour which is an assured treat to your taste-buds! Another one that follows the same path of sheer delicacy is Ilish cooked in Lotus seed-paste. The preparation looks like a regular sorshe-Ilish but has a completely different, mild taste. I do not think I am going to taste something so surprising any soon. 
The restaurant offers a large variety of starter and main course. You can try the different fish tandoori or the Fisherman's Basket. We had a combo meal and that was really good; especially the Prawn Malaikari was FABULOUS! Apart from the experimental and traditional Bengali platters, they also have variations in their continental section. I have tried only the Mediterranean Salmon and Sanghai Fish and can assure you that both are worth your pennies (especially the latter one). 
As for the end-note, please do not leave the place without having a sip of the Gondhoraj Ghol, a curd sherbet flavoured with the Aroma King lime. I wont stress myself into describing the ethereal taste of every gulp I took from it, but will only say this - you don't know what you are missing!

The only suggestion I have for the management is that it is time you improve your washroom facility. It is neither hygienic nor very comfortable.

I went dere with a lot of expectation! Ordered prawn on toast all I got was a soggy( mind u it was bleeding oil) toast which only tasted like a blob of oil. The flavour of prawn was all lost and having a single pc was a challenge. After this shock did not order the main course and ran away. I will not go bk there for sure!

I ate during Durga puja. Ambience,  staff behaviour is the positive. While the menu suggests a whole variety of fish preparations, we stuck to bengali combos which included illish bhapa, Topshe fry, dal, chana preparation amongst others. Extremely disappointing. I don't know whether I was eating a continental preparation of traditional bengali dishes or was it a simple case of unbalanced ingredients and seasonings that ended up giving less than average dining experience. There is a difference between subtlety in flavours and no taste. The bengali section of the menu in my humble opinion needs vast improvement. Neither will I go nor suggest anyone to eat at fish fish if they are looking for good authentic bengali food.

Galouti kabab of chitol and bhetki was not worth, as somehow it didnot represent the spirit of fish...there was a conscious effort to conceal the  flavour of fish..but starters apart, the main course was truely a bengali delight....padma koli bata diye ilish was like ambrosia....the coconut flavour made it taste like goan curry.bhapa bhetki with sorshe-..would satiate any taste bud modelled on the cuisine of east bengal...all in all fish fish is someplace to go again...

I wanted to remember our family dinner at fish-fish for cuisine, ambience and delight; however... I will have to customize my memory due to the following:

1. Parking - the hotel staff expect you to park at the wrong place ; because thats what most people do and as you enter, the staff points out the correct place to park; which is btw on the opposite road rather than the one just beside it; proactive measures required from the hotel for parking aide

2. Ambience - nice, considering a low budget restuarant. However, lot of room for improvement since it does not sport a low budget menu; we are no longer satisfied with just good food anymore, we want to carry home an experience 

3. Food - good food. No doubt. If you are looking for the best fish cuisine, well stop fishing around. Fantastic variations to choose from. Try the gondhoraj ghol for an appetiser and assorted fish tandoori for a starter. Ilish and prawn combo for main course. Sucking a Calamari to go with it. For bongs, for fish lovers things cant get better. The quantity isnt too bad either. And finally notun gurer icecream and chocolate firni. Orgasmic my dear.

Staff behavior was nice and warm. Our table was a bit wobbly, but it was soon fixed by putting a cardboard fold underneath by them. The waiters talk about food, can help you make your selection. They also promote & sell "hangla hensel" magazine from the reception, one has to pay separately for it, in cash. 

All said & done, the word is out, no hush-hush or fish-fish as they say in bengali, its Loud & clear... Go and enjoy the underwater life. They are tasty.

I remain hopeful to see mermaids serving food on my next visit !

If you are looking for fish as different from sea food this is the right place.
Food is tasty but during my three visits it varied form excellent to average. Generally order indian cusine (though for bengali fish the place next to this - Kasturi might be a better bet) , the chef seems more comfortable in this. The menu is extensive but for a fish lover the place is worth visiting a couple of times. The pricing totters on the edge of value and cud do with some right sizing as this is no longer the only fish specialist in town....

being a bong but not really a fish-smitten one, i am always very critical about the perfect fish quality, the no-fishy stink, the properly cooked fish and so on..my ma is the best fish chef i know and nothing can come close to her doi mach and tel koi..that being said, my fish-smitten bf and i went to try out fish-fish a couple of times to try and find what all the hype is about *after high reco from a fellow foodie* we were shattered the first time..prices were too high, amount was miserly, the baked fish was.. dare i remember again? almost raw and the sauteed veggies could not save the appalling show :-| a truckload of taxes and half-empty tummies was all i sadly remember of my debut.
come to take2- we thought it was wrong to expect good continental cuisine maybe and wanted to have a dash of good ol' bong/indian fish..we were suggested fish amritsari and another kebab which i dont even care to remember..fish amritsari cost a whopping 375 bucks and came in 2 bite-size pieces which by the way were soo buttery and delicious but just fell into one distant corner of our hungry stomachs :( we had a bill of about 700 and had eaten only 4 kebabs in total *2 each*. it was abominable,disgraceful and was enough to say good bye forever -_- 
recently on poila boisakh, while people were fist-fighting next door for entry in kasturi resto, the fish-fish guys were swatting flies by an almost empty door :D serves u right!

Being a fish-smitten bong ,the very name of this place sounded as MECCA would sound to a pious !!  …. And well I was not disappointed  Conveniently located this place is simple yet comfortable .  It was in FISH FISH that I first tasted CALAMARIS  in Kolkata. The MIXED GRILL PLATTER WITH BURNT GARLIC SALSA  was complete showstopper with the STUFFED SQUID giving it a close competition . Apart from the westernized versions of rui pabda ilish.. they also have them in traditional Bengali style which I have not yet tasted though . Price is pretty good for the quality and portions . I am definitely going back to FISH FISH to satiate my fish cravings .

We had Fish Finger, Chitol Sheekh Kabab, Fish Fry, Lote Bora, Charcoal Grilled Prawn, Fish Galauti Kabab and two mocktails. The first 3 items were quite good while the others were just too bad. Mocktails were good however.

Fish fish - The ONLY Restaurant All over India which just only serve's Fish!! ( As said by their management)
=================================================================================================
Brief:

Well, Located near the Bondel Road which is situated opposite to Ballygunge Dhaba (When you head from 6 Ballygunge place and cross Chowman to the end of the road you discover Fish fish). I am not a very big fan of fish food. As my brother wanted to eat some fish, we planned to bump in this place. I have been hearing about fish fish for quite a long time and many of my foodie friend's have complimented this place for the excellent food they serve. As the name suggests, i thought this place would be dealing with a lot of fish products and some other products too. Well, i was wrong. They just ONLY deal with fish. VEGETARIANS, sorry, please strictly avoid this place as they don't have anything to serve you apart from ice creams and tom yum soup. However, w.r.t. to the ambience, i really loved the blue false ceiling which they have constructed. It was adding to the simple look. 

As i entered this place, it was a simple ambience with little decorations which gave me a calm feeling. 
=================================================================================================
Food Ordered: 

We had ordered three things here as it's only fish, we ordered:-

1) Fish Fry - Two large pieces of Bhetki's coated with their special layer was served to me with loads of peas mixed with some masalas and tartar sauce. The tartar sauce was excellent but quite low on quantity as compared to the fish. The fish tasted good. However, the coating was a little thick to me. Overall, excellent dish to order here. 

2) Grilled Fish with garlic toast- Due to unavailability of garlic toast, they offered us to choose from parsley rice or mashed potatoes. We chose parsley rice. The rice was plain, simple and excellent. The Grilled fish was quite well grilled and was served with loads of good vegetables like brocolli's and mushrooms. Well, it was quite healthy and presentation of the dish was excellent. However, if you are eating this first time, you got to develop a taste for it as it's quite different from the usual. 

3) Natun Gur Ice Cream - I have heard from lot of my bengali friend's about the gur ice cream. Well, i had loads of cravings to try it. I was served this ice cream with tulsi patta on the top. This was simple ice cream but i personally would not like to pay 200 bucks for this ice cream which is not even good in the quantity. 
=================================================================================================
Pros:

1) Good ambience.
2) Courteous and knowledgable staffs.
3) Good food.
4) Few items like the fish fry and grilled fish are reasonably priced.
5) Hygiene is well maintained.

Cons:-
1) Quantity of tartar sauce served is quite less with the fish.
2) The gur ice cream is over price.
3) Expensive affair.
4) Nothing here is available for the vegetarians. Vegetarians strictly avoid.
5) Chicken and mutton lovers would love to have some of these items too. Nothing available here on that context too. 
=================================================================================================
Meal for two: 1200-1600 bucks.
=================================================================================================
Must try:

1) Fish fry
2) Tandoori fish
=================================================================================================
Summary:

Food quantity 4/5
Food quality 4/5
Hygiene 4/5
Taste 4/5
Value for money 4/5
=================================================================================================
Conclusion:

I liked my experience here due to the good hospitality and hygienic food. If you are fish lover, this place is a paradise for you. I have attached a few pictures below depicting the environment in which they operate. Feel free to comment. :)

Well,, this was heard from all my firends. Being a Bengali, I dont eat fish. Yup, thats true !
So, went there for my mom, sis and wife, where I thought I will sit back and enjoy with my 1yr kid.

BUT -

Had some starter there , some fish item tossed in butter.
Env was asesome, and location is also nice.
Food presentation was also good, just that portion was little less.

Price is on higher side, and thats fine considering the taste of the food. Again, I don't eat fish, but from the feedback I got from my lady brigade who accompanied me, it was awesome.

PS: Fish fish owner was playing with a Canon 7D Cam :) He had gifted a small fish shaped toy to my 1 yr old kid. Thanks for that !

I had read some of the reviews before going there yesterday, but nothing had prepared me for the wonderful plethora of mouth watering dishes that were about to come before me. The restaurant decor is nothing fancy, but when you have food like they have in Fish Fish, I would not mind even sitting on a wooden stool and enjoying the meal. And what good food they serve!! We ordered BBQ Prawns and Fish Makhmali as starters. Both the dishes were just too good. If you visit the restro anytime soon, make it a point to try out the Fish Makhmali. You can thank me later. ;)
For the Main course we ordered from the Combo Menu, Fish Tikka Butter Masala with Laccha Paratha and Mandarin Fish with Prawn Fried Rice. The Fish Tikka Butter Masala was out of this world!! We finished off our awesome meal with Vanilla ice cream. Fish Fish has made a huge fan of me. The waiting staff is very good, the presentation of food is worth mentioning and the taste, well, its the best fish I have ever had!! Give this place a try!!

This one is a long overdue! This place simply brought out my inner bong-fish loving side after a long time! I had always craved for a typical sea-food serving place, not that there is much option in Kolkata. But fish-fish comes quite close to removing such sadness. Unless you are allergic to sea-food, this place is a joy land for your tummy. Pomfret Macher English fry had a very nice marination but i felt it was a tad too much. We had ordered with some refreshing Gondhoraj Ghol. Their sea-food pasta in creamy garlic sauce is so amazing and perfect,  though a little too cheesy after the first few spoonfuls! Thankfully my friend had ordered the Mandarin fish with crab rice which had a wonderful balance of flavor. Overall the best part about this place is you dont burn a hole in your pocket, the seafood options though limited is definitely enough for one's expectations for a quick lunch/dinner. This is one of my best find's from last year!!

went there for a quick dinner but found the service time rather longish. However, the place is decent with nice minimalistic décor. Came across very cordial staff. We ordered for a Mee bakso Soup which had a nice aroma, Fish Galouti Kebab tasted great served with a Mint dressing and a jiggery/ Tamarind mixed dressings. Then we moved to main course - Stuffed Bhetki with Legumes which had generous cheese stuffing with worldly presentation and Mediterranean Salmon. Salmon tasted well though I thought the seasonings were on the higher side. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the food. The courtesy of the staff again calls for special mention as they gifted my 3 and a half years old daughter a toy fish to play around and as a souvenir. she too enjoyed her share of Prawn Mixed sea food gravy noodles. One need to go back again and again to try other delicacies they dish out!

I love seafood and a seafood only restaurant is the stuff of dreams for me. I went to Fish Fish for lunch recently. The place is average sized and not very fancily decorated. We got a nice table next to the window covered by a fisherman's net. The restaurant was nearly full even on a monday afternoon with families enjoying all sorts of very attractive seafood dishes which got us hungry even before we could order.
To start with I had the gondhoraj ghol which was very summery and refereshing with gondhoraj lemon leaves.
The menu is quite varied with different kinds of cuisine, from pan asian to continental and bengali. We had the stuffed squid with spicy thai salad for starters. The squid was absolutely delightful with a very tasty sauce, but I did not really like the thai salad, it was too dry and tasted only of chillies. Then we went for the prawn bhuna. The jumbo prawns were the freshest and tastiest I have had in a long time, cooked just right with a gravy that goes perfectly with some plain steamed rice. This we followed with the Kosha Kankra, which is crab heaven. The crabs were well cracked, but still a cracker would have been welcome. The meat was tender, the gravy a bit too rich, and the portion huge. For desserts we has the creme caramel which was quite a disappointment to end the meal with, the caramel tasted more like molasses than caramel. 
Suggestions would be to include clams and oysters if possible, since it is a seafood restaurant.

Fish-soup and Ilish - polao--I still remember these 2 items and will suggest people to try out these.
The continental dishes on fishes is better compared to ordinary bengali items.
A bit costly compared to other bengali restaurants but again the varieties are more and taste is equally good.
The ilish piece they provided was delicious and the polao was also properly cooked -- even without any side dishes you can have that i guess.
Fish soup, since had there for the first time, I liked it too much

Fish... Fish... Oh what can I say about my most preferred non veg item!! :D The name truly lives up to it!! We went on a weekday afternoon to this little restaurant and were joyfully surprised. Lovely to have a different menu from your regular Indian, Chinese, Moghlai and lately Italian being dished out everywhere... So non fish lovers beware and to the rest welcome to paradise... with varying tastes to tingle your palate.
We first ordered the Topshe Chingri meal and both the fish were superb, the dal served along with it was a bit too sweet for my taste, but who cares, I wasn't there for the dal :) The portion was more than enough for 1 person.
Next we ordered the Grilled fish & Mediterranean prawns along with Garlic bread... Both the dishes were out of this world and yeah the tastes, distinctly different!! They served Bhetki only and the prawns were fresh and supremely tender!
We also tried the Gondhoroj Ghol which was a sweet & fragrant frothy drink. Quite enjoyed the leaf thrown in, kept the flavor right till the drink finished.
For dessert we had the Nolengurer ice cream which was again nice and the Tofi Makhana with vanilla ice cream served in dark chocolate baskets…. Drool worthy totally…
So we stepped out with a song in our hearts, Fish… Fish… Fish… Fish… :P

Visited this place for a lunch after shopping in Gariahat. I heard from some of my frinds that this place is really good. and you can never keep a true blue bengali away from his/her Fish. they informed us that orders will be delyaed as there was some problem in the kitchen. 
we ordered for fish kebab, it was very good with just the right amount of marination and very little spices. then we also ordered assorted tandoori platter consisting grilled pomfret, prawn etc. and it was real good. really cherished the food. will definitely recommend it to others.

I am not in the least a Fish lover, the Bengali way i.e. Nonetheless I am open to experimentation and I do have an affinity for Fish tandoori and kebabs. The name suggested that it will be a fine dining experiencing. The area of specialty being 'Fish' (and sea food). Novel concept. A  food item being the attraction and not a particular cuisine. 
Keeping with my preferences I went for the continental affair on offer viz. steak on my first visit and grilled fish on my second. Both the times it was sheer bliss! The platters had tenderly cooked fish with a lovely sauce and cheese dressing. The sauce was neither too thick nor too watery along with lots of roasted veggies nicely flavoured with herbs and spices. Accompanied with that were well-buttered crispy Garlic breads.
But that is about what I ate to fill myself up. I dug into others' share as well. The staff suggested 'Chital Maccher Sheek Kebab' for starters. Simply awesome. Chital  tends to become rubbery if not cooked properly. Don't miss this one at any cost! Unfortunately, the company i had stuck to common dishes for the main course. Sona Moog Dal, Begun Bhaja, Bhapa Bekti on the first occasion and replacing Bekti with Hilsa the second time around. Excellent taste(s) on both occasions though. Also they have interesting deserts. I tried out Caramelised Makhane with  Toffee sauce. 
The presentations indeed are very nice as well.
It's a small cozy place. Not too fussy decor and the staff is courteous. Carry enough dough. Not very pocket -friendly but the high prices are justified amply. Yes..Loved it!

We went to this restaurant on my parent's anniversary and did not like it at all!!!......i tried the grilled fish with parmesan and toast......the fish was not at all 'grilled' it was baked and tasteless, the garlic breads were really minoature in size which was not very impressive!!.....my verdict is im would never try continental there, however the bengali dishes are well prepared as my sister tried the crab there and it was delicious.........since im not at all a fish lover ill not b going back......but those who are fish fans can definitely give it a try

Any one who loves fish must try out this one at Ballygunge atleast once and am sure, would be compelled to come back. Small  restaurant but nicely decorated with a soothing ambience and an extremely courteous staff, prices are slightly on the higher side. But after having prawn fritters, sea food mixed fried rice and fish hot garlic sauce(fresh bhetki), we felt it was worth the price we paid. It was simply mouthwatering and of high quality. The fish served were fresh. I would surely be going back there soon.

A Name very apt... Nothing Fishy about this Fish Joint... :) A Definite destination for Fish Lovers... I've had food in Fish Fish for 3 times now... First was twice on the same day 10 Months back and the latest being 15th Jan. The quality and standards have remained the same or has bettered than the last time. 

The Food is Surprisingly Brilliant and  the way Debashish takes care of you is simply amazing...  There are certain MUST TRY items in the menu... one being the Galoti Kebab (never it could be so beautifully done with Fish), Fried Calamari, Crab Kosha, the Prawn Bash Paturi,  just to name a few... A Definite Item for Desert would be Tofi Makhna with Ice Cream..... Everything that I've tried here till date was a super hit, except the Ilish pata pora, though it was cooked beautifully it didn't have the flavor of the Ilish itself (could be bcoz I had it in winters) Will again try it in Monsoon and update... :).... Good Food that Suits your pocket... Neither your stomach nor your pocket will hurt... :)

Decent food. The gondhoraaj bhetki is certainly par excellence. But then again I wouldn't pay so much for such tacky ambience. Debasish, the proprietor has a lot to work on before fish fish becomes a legend in the  Calcutta culinary map.

I ate lunch at this place one oshtomi and I liked it. Their noodles were great and their chilli fish was very very good. Yes we had fish and fish alone there and we liked every bit. It was a clean place with nice decor and no crazy smell (which the name gives warning of) and I would recommend this place if you happen to be in the are where it is located. Yes, the name is a bit strange but the food is definitely worth eating at least once, after which you will probably end up going for more!

We ordered a takeaway meal of English Fried Fish with tartar sauce and fished stuffed with beans etc along with veg.

However, we did not find the fish to be fresh and the cleanliness and hygiene at the restaurant cannot be said to be the best. The food also takes time to be ready.Cannot say whether we will go to this restaurant again or recommend it to others.

Well what to right about this place....went in with quite a lot of expectation but was very disappointed.
the service is so poor, it took such a long time for some to come and take our order, and that too we had to call the waiter to take the order otherwise god knows how long we would have had to wait.
the puja special thali which we had order was just warm and the fish and the dal had no taste what so ever. The fish was also raw and under cooked. Smae was for the Prawn Malai curry.
For a restaurant which specializes in Fish dishes of bengali, it was so disappointing, taste and service wise, even the quantity was minimal in comparison to the exuberant price. and even after informing the restaurant manager, nothing was done about it. Not Done!!!
Well this is one place i am not recommending to my friends or guest and i am definitely not eating here ever again!

Fish Fish is the destination for those people (mainly Bengali) who want to try something new but without moving away from their favorite i.e. fish. Being a Bengali and a fish lover, I just loved this concept.
I have been here many times and each time tried something new. Their menu is very elaborate and also they  update and introduce new items from time to time. Even they have special menus on special occasions. Below given are the list of items that I have tried. Also I have rated each one (on the scale of 5).
*Thai Sea Food Salad --> very new if you haven't tasted similar before. And healthy too.  [4/5]
*Fisherman's Basket --> If you are two people and want to taste as many fish as possible then this is a must. You will just love this fried assortment. [4.5/5]
*Chitol Machher Sheeck Kebab --> Good and healthy. Only the quantity is less [4/5]
*Tandoori Pomfret --> I had better [3.5/5]
*Fried Calamari with French Mustard Cocktail --> Loved it. It is served in a cocktail glass along with mustard sauce. Tastes great if you eat it alone or with sauce. Only shortfall, that I found in it, is that the calamari rings are not perfectly round with holes in it. It should be taken care of. [4/5]
*Fish Sizzler --> A sizzler with a chunk of Bhetki. Only the size should have been more. [3.5/5]
*Sea Food Pasta with Creamy Garlic Sauce --> Quantity is good. But after sometime you will crave for some tangy food due to blunt creamy taste. This single dish will get you full. Its that heavy. [3.5/5]
*Steamed Gondhoraj Bhetki --> It is really good. But same dish from Oh! Calcutta! is still the best in Kolkata. But you will have to pay nearly twice the amount. [4.5/5]
*Singapore Chilli Crab --> Really Good. But they should have broken the shells completely. It took a lot of time eat this dish fully. [3.5/5]
*Poddo Kuri Bata Diye Ilish Maach --> I ate this at the time of the year when Ilish was not readily available. They are storing seasonal fish in a vacuum sealed pack. So fish will be preserved in perfect state for more than a year. Now you can eat good Ilish any time you want. [4.5/5]
*Gondhoraj Ghol --> It didn't like it much [2.5/5]
*Chocolate Firni --> Good desert [4/5]
*Nalen gurer Ice-cream --> Good new flavor [4/5] 

I really liked this restaurant. Not only for their food but also for the warmth that I receive from the people in Fish Fish. You will find the owner himself to approach you asking about the food and any thing else. I really liked this personal touch.

Menu is on a very pricier side. So I suggest to visit with as many people (who will share the bill) as possible. And if you love fish then don't worry about the taste. Its really good.

Happy eating :)

SOMETHING'S FISHY!!
It's not that only Bangalees are fish lovers but somehow they are fish oriented from birth till death.Was walking down Anil Moitra road when we came across this restro called "Fish Fish". Having heard about it before ,so we decided to try this new place ourselves. The space was small but the ambience was nice and cozy and the decorate was decent too. We had ordered 3 meals for 3 persons- a sea food pasta with creamy garlic sauce,a prawn straganoff and a grilled fish with parmesan cheese and garlic bread. The quantity was decent but, The raw fish smell from the grilled fish with parmesan cheese literally gave me a headache and there was hardly any Parmesan cheese.,Just a negligible amount was sprinkled on the top. Was forced to send it back.
 The prawn straganoff tasted really nice however there were hardly a handful of medium sized prawns in the platter which was a little disappointing. 

The sea food pasta platter was nice. 

Overall the new experience was good,-especially due to the peaceful ambience and well mannered ,efficient staff ,
however the food could have been better-especially the grilled fish!

Touted as the only "Fish Restaurant" in Calcutta, this quaint place is worth its name, coz it serves only Fish & Seafood.

The eponymous menu comes in 2 versions - One Traditional Bengali and the other more International.

Our starter came as "Chitol Machher Seekh Kebab" - more like a fish sausage. But great quantity.

Main Course was:
Mixed Seafood Fakuca Juice (superb mixed fried rice enveloped in omelette) paired with - "Grilled Fish with Garlic Toast" (heavenly) and "Chingri Maacher Baas Paturi" (monstrous tiger prawns paturi served inside a bamboo).

For desserts, we chose "Nutan Gurer Ice Cream" and didn't get disappointed either.

Overall, great quantity served making it a real value for money and of course Awesome food at great price !! They serve the "Hungroooo" version of every dish. Must visit for every Fish Lover. 

Service can be made faster but then, the polite staff, kind of compensates for that.

PS: I'm gonna come down there once again, soon.

In a nutshell:

A small but very good concept restaurant that sticks to its core – fish & other seafood, no mutton/chicken.

Short Description – in case u r in a hurry:

For non bongs - 'Fish Fish' has a dual meaning. In English it means that it is a fish restaurant. In Bangla ‘fish fish’ means ‘whisper’. While whisper has nothing much to do with the restaurant, it for sure is a catchy & rememberable name.

For all-
This tiny restaurant is a brave attempt to stick to the core competence in a city full of generalists – I am sure u wud have noticed ‘Indian, Mughlai, Chinese’ written all over town. Yes, u got it right, no meats r available at Fish Fish. Only fish and seafood of different kinds r available. I saw families with chickenetarian kids & people with seafood allergy walking out of the restaurant but the Management stuck to its principles.

The menu card has fish & seafood items from different parts of the world as well as different Bengali fish preparations. I was pleasantly surprised to see some Far East dishes that r usually not served in India. The day I dined there, they had some big uncooked lobsters with them which they were displaying & showing to customers. Once customers chose the lobster, they wud cook it as per the customer’s taste. 

Service was very good. The staff were polite, efficient & nice. 

Loved the food in general & some items in particular.

Detailed Description – In case u have the Time to NJOY reading:

We tried a drink called Gondhoraj ghol. For the uninitiated, Ghol is something close to sweet chaanch but not the same. The Gondhoraj ghol had a thin texture like Ghol usually is, but had a strong taste & gondhoraj (aromatic citrus fruit) flavor. It had a good balance of sweet and sour. I wud not say this was the best I have ever had but it was surely good. While one can always argue about the price of the drink as compared to similar ‘ghol’ available on roadside shacks in Kolkata, the price at fish fish is comparable to such drinks in such restaurants in all other metros of India. I rate this 3.75/5.

We started the lunch we had the Seafood mee baksi soup – It was bhetki dumpling in bhetki stock, with garlic, green chilly & coriander. The soup was Super thin & clear. The soup was transparent & that reminded me of my eat-outs during visits to China, Vietnam & other Far East Asian countries. The soup at fish fish was not bastardized (like most Indian eateries end up doing by addition of corn starch, which the Chinese wud never do). It had a strong taste and flavor of fish. The truely outstanding fish dumplings were made not with fish paste but with lumps of fish. It was somewhat juicy due to the same. Super loved it. I rate this dish 4.5/5

For appetizers we had Chital machher Sheek kabab. I had never had anything like this b4. This was chitol paste mixed with spices & made into kababs. The idea was very interesting & precarious as well. While spices cud have overshadowed the flavors & taste of fish, the lack of it cud have made the kababs bland. The kabab at fish fish was quite balanced & I liked it. However must mention it that one of my co-diners still found it bland & another one found the spice overpowering & hence less flavor of fish. Well, I rate this 4/5 since I found it very good. However warn u to try it on ur own risk, not on YUMMRAJ;s recommendation.

Next we had was a fish & seafood platter. It had Lote machher bora, Calamari, Tandoori fish, topsey fry, prawn tempura, pomfret fry. 

Lote machher bora had too much packing & thus the fish was lost. Good to taste as it is, as a bora if not told it is lote machher bora. I have had different versions of Bombay duck (lote maach) ib Delhi & Mumbai & in those the fish taste is so obvious. I rate this 3/5

Pomfret fry had just salt and turmeric. Like at home – in case someone wants to taste the home version. Good, but nothing great. I rate this 3/5

The Calamari was batter fried. It was soft (which is an achievement as most people goof up on this). It tasted good as well but like any batter fried small item, the taste of the batter interfered with the taste of the calamari a lot. I rate this 3/5.

Tandoori fish was good. It had layers of juicy fish. I quite liked it & rate it 3.5/5

Batter fried Topsey fish was good. The batter was crisp & the fish within was nice – same way as u get in most homes. However I have had some versions of topsey fry with a thin marination layer between the external batter & the fish. That usually adds a twist to the tale. I rate the Topsey at Fish Fish 3/5.

Overall rating of the platter averages out to 3.1/5.

For main course we started with Koi aam kasundi that turned out to b the star of the show. It had juliennes of raw mango in a pungent mustard sauce. Very very intense, had a nice kick to it, pungent, robust thick gravy that was simply divine. Koi itself was also very fresh & enjoyable. I rate it 4.95/5

Next item that we had was Chingri macher baansh paturi. This was prawns cooked & served in bamboo hollow. It was in the right direction but had a mild execution issue. The prawns marinated in coconut and spices were put inside a bamboo Hollow and sealed from the top & then cooked in the bamboo hollow. Since the steam cud not escape, it condensed back to water thus making the gravy bit watery & deficient in salt. I guess the dish conceptually needs a bit of fine tuning unless this was an occasional mistake. The huge prawns were very good to taste and had perfect texture. Not at all chewy. Without the execution problem this cud have been 4.5/5. But the way it was, it turned up to b 3.75/5.

Ilish macher pata pora. This was large pieces if ilish (marinated with mustard, mustard oil, green chilles and coconut scraped) wrapped in a leaf & baked. The scraped coconuts got a burnt feeling. Overall there was a strong unmissable smoky flavor that u do not usually get in an ilish paturi. Loved that smokiness. The dry gravy was again pungent and strong. The fish was also very good in quality – it was juicy as the layers of fat had melted due to the heat. I rate this dish 4.5/5.

For dessert we chose Nolen gurer ice cream. It was superb as well. Strong nolen gur flavor of ice cream with mashed chana interspersed in it. The chhana ensured that the sweet level was balanced & it also gave a daanedaar effect to the dish. Loved it and rate it 4.5/5.

Overall rating of food at fish fish averages out to 4.1/5

I wud surely revisit here. Look forward to trying out newer dishes next time.

Lovely experience. Went there almost a month ago. Tried the prawn stroganoff, makhmali kabab, muligwtany soup and pan fried bhekti. The first two were the best especially the prawns. The waiters were quite cordial and were suggesting dishes as per your taste. We ordered for fish and chips first, but they said that the preparation was not fresh that day. This was what i liked. Ambience was good, though the moment i entered could get the raw smell of fish all around...
Overall good experience.

A worst bengali cuisine restaurant I have ever visited,they suggested patapora ilish which was absolutely a bad experience.The strong smell of shalpata destroyes the natural taste of ilish.Another was bhetki mach,am a fish lover,but couldn't take a bite of that dish for its rawness,because we know that bhetki has a strong smell.And small pieces of glass can cut your tongue or throat if you eat unmindfully.

Extremely over priced given the quality of food. The "Chitol Machh" was very bad - couldn't eat it. However, the other dish was good . I would say there are better places for fish lovers in Kolkata. But if you R-E-A-L-L-Y want to go, avoid "chitol machher peti"

If you a fish lover, then it is the place for you. Space are very small. you have to wait if there are  many guests. We took steamed gandhoraj bhetki and chitool machecher sick kabab masala. I recommend their 'steamed gandhoraj bhetki'. It is so yummy but must be consumed hot. It is baked with cheese. It is a good creation.

Wow. What a nice new luncheon restaurant. They have wonderful versions of bengali ( and other) fishes in fusion, oriental, english and continental styles. A wholesome enjoyable fishy dayout. We were little disappointed while ordering salmon, they very polietly informed they are out of stock, but, who cares, they offered us with lote croquette, gandhoraj bekti, stuffed squid, bekti sizzler and singaporean crab. Believe me, even they are much tastier than you can found in Singapore, and sizzler was very different than our old favorite mocambo fish steak, spicy and very nice and different. Not a copycat, but, a new signature mark. Everything were delightful except the chital peti. A fishy experience to remember and come back.

I ate at Fish Fish last week when I was in Kolkata. Its a small restaurant, doesn't take reservations and everything on the menu (minus the dessert) is fish!  The staff are friendly and the service is good. The décor is minimal and not too inspiring. Many people come in for take outs. I was eating with two other people. 

We ordered stir fried prawn and crab.  The story fry was rather oily with some vegetables. The crab was good.  The rice was basmati, which (in my view is a bit of a mistake) when there is good Govindbhog around! We had an interesting dessert - caramelised makhanas wit a scoop of ice cream.  Delicious.

Ever since I had heard of this place I was itching to try it out.Being a fish lover myself I was fascinated by the idea of a restaurant serving mainly different types of fish based items.I really like the concept and thought it was a brave one too on the part of the owners.
I had visited the place a couple of days back with a friend.I was impressed by the number and variety of items available in the menu.We had ordered a mixed fish grill and a sea food pasta.Both the items were really nice.The mixed grill contained bhetki,jumbo prawn,pomfret and squids.It was quite nice.I thought it was just a shade over cooked but good nonetheless.The pasta was also very well made.We ordered a dessert-makhani with ice cream.That was absolutely delicious.I have also tasted their stuffed bhetki which my parents had brought for take away.It was also well made and really tasty.Overall the food was really good.
The staff were well mannered.The space is a little on the lesser side.The place can accomodate about 20-25 people at most.The ambience and decor could have been a bit better.
Overall if you like your fish,then this place is meant just for you and you must at least give it a try.

I went to this restaurant today only to find it completely empty, around 1600 hrs, the waiters were courteous no doubt and as per as food is concerned its tastes good but one would find a stark difference in quality and quantity, its too pocket pinching, money charged for the food is not as per the rates, however for foodies I'd suggest the oyster meal was superb which they do not have in their menu card, one needs to request for it...if the cost is taken aside the other factors of this restaurant is absolutely nice...

I had loads of expectation from fish fish.. but was highly disappointed. All the bengali fish curries were below average specially chitol macher kalia. Gravies were sweet which didn't suit me. the only dish which i was satisfied with was tandoori prawn. They recommended ilish macher pata pora.. which tasted absolutely bland.. basic salt was not properly marinated and the fish tasted raw. Decor was good, staff was polite. But the pocket pinch is too much.. they are selling gandhoraj lebur ghol ( which is nothing special.. even the roadside nimbu paani tastes better) for rs 120 which i think is too much!!!

I have been to Fish Fish today and found this place good. The Bengali cuisine is extremely good but I would definitely recommend them to improve more on the Continental part. When there are lots of people who survive only on meat its a great challenge to think only of fish. Chef Debashish had the courage to think of such a concept. The Pora Pata Ilish is one of its best. I congratulate Chef Debashish and wish him all the best for the future.

This is my first review so I hope I am not too harsh.I visited Fish Fish twice in a matter of a few weeks and sadly its the wrong things that stand out. For starters the staff are neither professional nor courteous. I tried the Salmon salad which was okay but not great. The English Fried Fish with Tartar Sauce isn't too great either.It tasted rather bland. The Grilled fish with Garlic toast was however a saving grace. The sauce was nice had a punch of cheesy garlic and the fish was properly grilled too. My second visit was a disaster.I went with 3 friends of mine. We ordered the combo and supposedly the owner came to us and suggested we go for their Chitol Macher Jhol. It was a complete disaster. The fish was not cooked properly and the gravy was way below par. Another advice to the owners is that one thing customers expect at a decent restaurant is a proper clean restroom.The one at Fish Fish can be described in one word. HORRIBLE. For a change the one item I did enjoy both times was the Chitol Macher Seekh Kabab. Stands out as the best thing I have to comment about Fish Fish

Visited this restaurant on 31st May 2013 with 3 of my friends for dinner. The food was good, the staff behaviour wasnt, which made the overall dining experience unpleasant. The gondhoraj ghol, chitol maacher kebab & sea food pastas were good. My friend had ordered a Crab dish. When she asked for the Crab Cracker, the waiter said they didnt have one. So my friend had to struggle through her meal, trying to tackle the crabs with both her hands, which was quite a tedious task! At the end of the dinner, I asked the concerned person (am assuming he was the manager) & just gave him the feedback that they should probably keep a crab cracker handy, going forward. To which the concerned person replied quite rudely, that we should have opted for the Hilsa preparation instead of ordering for crabs!!!! We were shocked that someone who is in the hospitality business, can have a belligerent "I Told You So" attitude!! The whole purpose of having a menu is that customers can choose a dish they want to eat & not be forced to go by the recommendation of the restaurant managers!! After this experience, Im not sure if i will visit or even recommend this place to anyone!!

This one eatery sure deserves a thumbs up! As the name suggests they have some serious fishy affair going!  A small 30-seater joint at Ballygunj. I wanted to try them forever! I went last week with family. The ambiance is nice. But let's talk about the food as they were surely the star of the show! 

Our order were:
a. Gondhoraj Ghol - A very refreshing drink, Punjabi Lassi with a Bengali Gondhoraj Lebu (lemon) twist
b. Then for starters we had ordered Chitol Maacher Kabab . Yummy, tender fish which had a smoky flavor and needless to say was highly appetizing. 
c. Also Fried Squid with French Mustard Cocktail sauce. The squid were extra crispy and crunchy, even if you hate squid do try this one. And the mustard sauce is to die for. I really really wish they provide some more sauce with the dish.

In the main course (we were 5 in number) we ordered:
a. Bhetki Sorshe and Pur Bhora Bhetki Maacher Jhol: Now the interesting thing about Bhetki Sorshe was the Sorshe curry. It had a tangy flavor to it which made it taste different from other restaurants. The "Pur" in the "Pur Bhora bhetki" was shrimp paste stuffed inside the bhetki fish with a Sorshe curry. It was good too.
b. Next we had asked for Grilled Bhetki Parmesan with Garlic Bread: Very good portion.. a sizable chunk of bhetki fish grilled with veggies like carrot, potato (skinned), broccoli topped with Parmesan cheese. The broth that surrounded the grill was sweet and suited well with the overall dish. But I was hoping a little of melted cheese or may be some more handful of shredded parmesan in the dish. Nevertheless a must try.
c. Then we had ordered for Mix Grill Platter. The platter deserves special mention because of its portion and taste. It had one big prawn (Bagda Chingri), one big sized pomfret, small chunks of boneless bhetki and squid. The grill is a sure hit and I will definitely try again!
d. Lastly came the queen! - the beautifully decorated, sumptuous, tangy tasty BBQ Prawn with burnt garlic sauce. The prawns were quite big in size ( golda chingri), cooked to PERFECTION, might I say the best Prawn BBQ I ever had! I can never say no to this one baby for sure!

For dessert, we ordered Chocolate Phirni and Caramel Custard. The custard was tender , not too sweet, nice its own way. Again the chocolate Phirni.. Just brilliant! Do give it a try.

All in all, very good food... a fish fanatic that I am, Fish Fish served my hunger, crave and appetite for fish. 
This one is here to stay... for long.

We just returned from this restaurant on Anil Moitra road.its a small 30 seater joint themed on fish items. The interior aren't much laudible, its just well lit and cozy. So we didn't spend any time browsing and went right for the kill. Since I remember the order very clearly, I will take you dish by dish

1. Gondhoraj Ghol - a nice appetizing drink based on the concept on ghol served with the strong aroma of gondhoraj lime. it was quite comforting to begin with. rating -8/10

2.Grilled Fish Parmesan with garlic bread - the portion was real nice, but the vegetable served with it and the 'hint' of gravy wasn't as delightful.                 rating-7/10

3. Singapore Prawn- in the bill they have mentioned it as prawn stroganoff,a mistake no doubt.again,the size of jumbo prawn was enticing,but the gravy wasn't quite singapore.  rating-7/10

4.mixed sea food hakka noodles-this was one real good serving,with richly added shrimps and fish                                 rating-8/10

5.tofi makhana with vanilla icecream-the rich topping of caramel and chocolate makes it a must try.                     rating-9/10

6.firni with chocoalte sauce- my pick of the day,and kudos to the chef.it was extremely well made and compounded.don't miss this one.     rating-9.5/10

about the service,we went early so the waiters had time to be attentive and courteous,there was a hint of mayhem and macabe while we were leaving,the restaurant being small and people starting to queue up.   they do have small toys for children and that felt like a nice gesture(inspite of the fact that the children receiving those weren't with us). 
the price like any other theme restaurant and being exclusive and small seater,was on the high side.but they don't apply vet.



give this one a try.it will be a pleasant surprise!

The food is OK quite on the better side. But the service and the laziness of the waiters will pull it down. Way to the toilet is horrible. It Stinks. Need to improve. May be the restaurant works for the posh locality. But believe me if you really like Fish you should go for the next door.

The idea of a only fish specality restaurant was surprisingly missing among the Big, Fat , Bengali Foodie.. Fish Fish is a pioneer in this respect no doubt. We are a foodie couple and last week we had our dinner in Fish Fish. The decor is simple and the use of fishnets in the show-windows  are apt with the theme. 
We are a couple and ordered Thai sea food salad, Grilled fish Parmesan with garlic bread and  Fish Sizzler (one each). Thai salad was good with a nice melange  of flavors and tastes. 

As  for the two main dishes, Grilled Parmesan with garlic bread was more or  less good. A bhetki fillet, in this case, is baked and served with vegetables. The fish sizzler almost tastes the same. Both are a little bland, though Grilled Parmesan tasted better. One would expect a butter and parley infused chicken in this case, but the taste and flavor is completely given a twist. 

The food is well presented, service was prompt and ambiance was quite ok. However, the portions were too small. Our bill came around Rs.1500 for the 3 dishes and two fresh lime soda. But, after having them, we didn't feel filled-up. So, I would say that the price is a little on the  steeper side.  Also, please note that there is no parking place in the vicinity and finding a cab in this lane at night is a bit tricky. 

And lastly, sorry Rocky and Mayur...the eatery smells too much of fish...so much that one can smell it even when one crosses it outside.

Very very disappointing place.

I had heard a lot about this place and so I took some of my colleagues to Fish Fish for Lunch and each and every one of us was thoroughly disgusted with the food and service.

To begin with 7 of us were made to sit on a table where probably 5 would eat with difficulty. No one came to take the orders or give water (It was a scorchingly hot day). After a lot of hand waiving the water was served and orders taken. The staff were not at all helpful to explain the menu or suggest portions and were visibly rude.

The food came good 40 minutes after placing of the order. The portions were pathetic in comparison to the prices. There was no effort from the waiters side to serve the meal and reacted rudely when were asked to do so. The taste of all the dishes were below average and any Bengali House-wife would probably cook better. 

There was again no refilling of water anytime before, during or after the meal.

I will seriously recommend not visiting this restaurant.

Fish fish was a disappointment. The menu card looked more delicious than the actual dishes; most of which was not available with them. General food served on expensive cutlery decorated with meager quantities, though ostentatious names and exuberant prices. I so want to go there and get a bite of their bengali servings but end up questioning myself if it would be a wise thing to visit that place again...

The idea of a restaurant dedicated to fish was a novelty and wonderful recommendations provoked my brother and me to try this place out. I have wisely understood that the portions of most main courses served in most restaurants are sufficient for a full meal along with a drink and dessert but my brother was all for the appetizers and since I have unfortunately allergic to prawns and crabs we decided on the Fisherman's basket to be shared between the two of us and my brother opted for the Thai salad. As a Bengali the basket seemed very common with a high price tag for those of us who have had the privilege of devouring on numerous varieties of fish fries throughout our lives but later when I thought about it this is a perfect way for people who haven't eaten the fish of Bengal to get a treat. I personally feel a variety of homemade condiments with the fisherman's basket would make it more interesting rather than the 'kasundi' (mustard sauce which is extremely pungent, a specialty of Bengal). The decor is neat, clean and very appealing. The servers are polite. I wanted to try the house specialties and decided on the Fish Sizzler while my lucky brother (who is non allergic to sea food) ordered the Singaporean crab from the section of the Main Course. The sizzler was superbly made with the perfect taste which I was craving. The servers are not too well acquainted with the dishes. I asked them for recommendation on a dish which is spicier than any dish prepared in white sauce and they discouraged me to opt for the sizzler which was spicy but delicious. My brother on the other hand did not enjoy his crab too much because he likes the meat to be first scooped out which makes dining less messy. Like most modern restaurants knives were not a part of the cutlery which had been provided which made the task of cutting the vegetables and fried fish difficult. The restaurant which is still in its infant stage finds it a bit difficult to handle too man y customers since once the restaurant started filling up no server came towards our table which made asking for a knife impossible and my glass of water remained empty after a second filling buy our server . One must not misunderstand their inability to cater to every table because their efforts in running around trying to appease all the customers was commendable. I would definitely recommend this to people who do not have the good fortune of trying the fishy delicacies from Bengal at home and I personally would not mind dropping in for a healthy lunch, for after all fish is full of Omega 3 which is very nutritional and the unique taste created by the restaurant in their options of main course is commendable.                                                                                    P.S. The Gondhoraj Ghol is a perfectly delicious appetizing drink. prices are very steep but given the dearth of fish and the high price of it in the market it is understandable. My brother who has recently been to Thailand and is in love with Thai food found the Thai salad as close to authenticity in taste as possible.

Finally a fish only restaurant for the fish crazy bengalis. The restaurant has a pleasant decor... Although the restroom needs some serious cleaning and redoing.
From the food side, the menu is pretty varied ranging from  quintessential bengali food like chingri maacher malai curry and topshe masch bhaja..to a western and south Asian fare including seafood pasta, grilled bhetki and thai platter. The quality and the quantity of the food is pretty good and service is also not bad. Over all the place surely demands a second visit from any fish lover.

This one has been rated very high and become very popular on Zomato so wanted to go myself and check out the place. Yes the reviews are very rightly written this indeed is a very good place and a must try for all those who haven't been here as yet. Well as the name suggests this place is all about different types of fishes prepared in various styles. You get continental preparations as well as pure bengali cuisine. The 'Tom yam' soup is amazing though it is very spicy as supposed to be. Nothing like Prawn dishes after all Prawn is the King of all Sea fishes. The ambience is also really well done and quite stylish.
 Overall I was very impressed and I rate it 4, you too rate after you've had ur scrumptious meal here.

Been there on a very busy day ,but the service was absolutely fabulous.

The food there is awesome

try the stuffed calamari and the nasi goreng!! 
Awesome is the word for it!

The fish and squid is fresh which is something to keep in mind!1

I went with a friend of mine.

The quantity is ok according to the price.

but the best thing is the price includes all taxes

This is my first review after joining Zomato. Thought this would be a positive one, but it turned out to be a disappointment. As a fish lover, I went to this newly heard place to try some of their dishes. What came, looked good from outside but from inside was tasteless, smelly. Prawns, pomfrets were smelly, the grilled prawn was bland. Add to this, we were taken aback by the service quality of their staffs. Nobody bothered to clear the dishes after starter, we have to ask for clearing. I asked for glass of water, they came with a jug. Moreover, we found the staffs to be very rude. Their tone was.. take it or leave it.
We were very happy that such a type of restaurant has opened in Kolkata and looked forward to it, but really it is not worth it. The quality of food they serve at the price is below par of the food we get in 5* restaurants.
Definitely, not going back.

fish fish isn't that great...they gave us two menus, one which had bengali cuisine and the other which continental. After we decide on the order, they tell us that they're not going to serve continental as some festival is going on. I was extremely dissappointed as I don't like Bengali cuisine much.

We finally ordered prawn malai curry, rice and pomphret. They were ok. On the whole the experience was disappointing.

Ambience : 3/5

Fish-fish turns out to be more of phisss-phissss...the food seriously takes the wind out of the hype surrounding it. We really have a penchant for glorifying the ordinary, or has kolkata lost it taste?! The prawn cocktail was obnoxious. Some prawns n lots of mustard mayo, served at room temperature. And somebody has reviewed in zomato that it was great. I really would request the chef n the reviewer to visit at the most peter cat n get n idea how a prawn cocktail shud taste. The english fry was the plain fish fry wid the same mayo in which the prawn had been folded in the cocktail. The grilled fish with garlic bread n boiled veggies was absolutely ordinary.the vegetables were half cooked, we could not have them except a corn cob n the garlic breads were unmentionable. Not worth the price at all. Kolkata boasts of better places to have fish anyday

Went to fish fish today at 4. I think I can safely say that I am a big foodie and have been to enough restaurants around the world, so i think I am suitable enough to rate a food serving place.

Below are the list of things we noticed.

1. After entering at once me and my friend noticed that most of the tables were left in a dirty state. pretty surprising when there was only one family eating there. 
2. You will be greeted with the smell of fish in the restaurant. This was acceptable to us as we both are fish eaters.

3. Food prices seemed on the slight higher side so we expected good food and service. 
4. DO NOT order the fresh lime soda. They charge Rs.125 plus taxes. I felt this was out of order. I inquired about this to the waiter and I was told by him that this is a very good star restaurant and not a cheap one. He was very rude in his comments6 which is not acceptable customer service. we wanted to walk out but we thought we might eat some fish before leaving. Got the fresh lime and it was nothing special. 
5. We ordered one mixed sea food platter and one sea food gravy noodles. I would rate the sea food platter as average. nothing special..It was overcooked with out any salads or ever slice of lime.  
The gravy noodle was good, but not as good to force me to go to this eating place again. 

This eating house needs to work on their customer service, cleanliness and food quality or else there will be no returning foodies for this place.

no fishfish way to announce it,but should be told in a clear voice that this new entrant in the food map of kolkata is here to stay..heard quite a lot about this place and the food they serve,so lured by the idea of a new "concept" restaurant in the heart of the Calcutta, wanted to pay a visit with my good friend who is an avid fish lover.he is a doctor too,mind you..first about decor and really nothing much about it though..can't categorise for a classy extravaganza..it lacks decor. Frankly, a lot of the excitement ebbed on entering the ordinary down the road looks. Fish net on the show windows, laminated table tops, uncomfortable office seating and above all the fish odour or stench for some people who is not that "fishy" by nature..instead of going for the regular bengali delicacies that we tend to eat in other themed restaurants,i wanted to opt for some other options and ordered fried calamari with mustard infused sauce..trust me it was wonderful..for main course we had shrimp paste stuffed squids and grilled bhetki with parmesan cheese and parsley teamed with garlic toasts..must admit that squid was well-cooked..a bit chewy as squids should be with a smooth shrimp paste..grilled bhetki was a foodie's delight..perfectly grilled to perfection and the parmesan cheese infused gravy did the trick..literally lip-smacking..garlic breads were awesome too..though very little in quantity..average price for two persons should range between 1200-1500,a bit steeply priced i know..but hey a restaurant offering only fish items,we can pay that extra price for our love of "maach" right!!!

Don't want to beat a dead horse but what a fantastic place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Tried their Fried Calamari with french mustard cocktail,sea food risotto with garlic bread,stir fried squid and fried icecream...

A pelican with a full beak stands by the door. As far as welcoming metaphors go, nothing could be more appropriate. Because here, the catch is always fresh.The restaurant may be small, but it's big on taste!!
The spices don't smother the food, but enhance their flavors....

The Chef is really good,does a fine job of keeping the food tasting authentic and equally inviting,makes scrumptious fusion food and the bridge that he's created between Bengali traditional food and continental food is really appreciable!!

Linger over the seafood display before you make your choices....

There are problems with their seating arrangement as its a little cramped and lacks privacy.
The food quality is really good, service is legitimate, staff is amicable; though had ordered a soft drink which they conveniently forgot to serve.Later on they did the needful after a reminder.
The place lacks a privatised parking space.

The VERDICT: If you are in the mood for exquisite Fish, "fish fish" is DEFINITELY worth a try.

The average tab per head comes to Rs 600-700.

For the Food : 4.5/5
For the ambiance and service : 3/5

Can fish ever be enough? This place says it can & I think they're right.
It's a small place,but lively. The service is fast and friendly.
The starters are excellent, especially the mixed kebab platter, though the main continental items are a little bland.
The prawn cocktail is UNFORGETTABLE--fresh, fluffy with lots of green salad--the best I've ever had!

Rocky's Taste: - 4/ 5 - Everythings Fishy about this place. A bold decision to start a restaurant which serves only fish and everything to do with it with a few veggy items thrown in.  Its simple and clean lines are welcoming but its food is what takes the cake (albeit the fish cake). Try the unusual Calamari with mustard cocktail for a starter, its delightful. I also ate the wholesome sea food Risotto,  the delicious Singapore chilli crab, the very good mixed sea food hakka noodles and a bunch of other fish Items from the very extensive Bengali, Indian and South east Asian fish preparations. It's a new place and all the Chefs are working hard to please their customers, go there now and make the most of it.  

Mayur's Herbivorous TASTE: 4 / 5 - Nothing fishy about my meal here! Yes it's an eatery dedicated to fish and other seafood but the Chef will be happy to rustle up some impromptu recipes for the occasional vegetarian that wanders in. I started with a delicious glass of the tart, yogurt-based Gondhoraj Ghol mocktail with the characteristic flavor of this big green 'lebu'. I was next served a dish of spaghetti with fresh vegetables cooked in a creamy peppery white sauce with a hint of citrus (Chef Debasish loves using the tart Gondhoraj lime to flavor various preparations), which is a full meal by itself. I enjoyed the still crunchy stir-fried vegetables served in generous portions in a soya based sauce and followed this up with a large rosogulla innovatively served in a cocktail glass. Tasty though it was the spongy Rosogolla was a bit dry and a little too sweet for my taste. Should have tried their Fried ice cream or Tofi Makhana instead! 

AMBIENCE: 3.5 / 5 - It's a small space but impeccably clean and cool with comfortable leather seating and dark wooden topped tables. Deft touches such as little sea -style light fittings, a panel with wooden oars, a wall with porthole like mirrors in rows and columns and a fun fish design on the coloured glass door lend a modern nautical ambience to the interiors. The main dining area allows a view of the kitchen through a large wooden framed opening covered with gauzy material providing tantalizing glimpses of the small and extremely busy kitchen. It has the air of a clean relaxed place and does NOT smell of fish. 
SERVICE: 4 / 5 - We found the service to be quick, efficient and on the ball though we did see some fellow diners waiting for a while for their order to arrive. We also overheard a member of the service staff patiently and expertly answering queries about the food on the phone. Well done we say!

VALUE FOR MONEY: 4/ 5 - It's not cheap but given the quality of ingredients and prepared dishes we are happy to give Fishfish a thumbs up for value. A meal for 2 should cost under Rs1500.

OVERALL RATING: 4 / 5 - A great and bold idea to operate in this niche of a fish/seafood only restaurant and that too in Kolkata. The skills of Chef Debasish and his team (almost all of whom have their origins as purveyors of street food) have made this gamble pay off. The intersection of 3 narrow streets just outside can cause a bit of noise and confusion outside but inside it's calm sailing.

My right for a bite ended when I went to Fish Fish. What attracted me? 
The name of course!! what a delightful name was it! walked right across the street. 

What was good?? well ahem nothing.. What would I even review when there is NO food!! 8 of us entered FF with a lot of expectation. We sat and started wondering what we could eat. Well a particular calamari caught my attention. I politely asked the Waiter about its freshness. All hell broke lose!! mr. rude told me I was not allowed to question the quality of the fish. well.. i still sat there awaiting some kind of apology. A few of my friends thought digging into some Rui Kalia would settle matters!! 

Guess what Fish Fish restaurant does not keep Rui macchh :D :D .. whatever they have we are supposed to gulp down whether we like it or not.. Chicken? how did i even ask for it??? and mutton na na - dont u see i stood corrected - this is Fish Fish we do not keep Rohu fish, we keep 2 fishes - prawns and pabda - eat it or leave this place... we dont keep chicken coz we are fish fish .. we are rude, since we are in the league of Dum Pukht.. Needless to say we walked out. Hoping we or no else ever entered the place.

Although name suggest it is a place for hardcore fish lover, but first time fish eaters can surely indulge in a meal and I can assure you  it will be worth going there.
Ambience is 6 out of 10, but you can surely exempt it and concentrate on meal. Preparations of fish, prawn and crabs are right to perfection . 
And whatever you see on the menu card price that is all inclusive of taxes so you don't have to pay a penny extra. 
Ps note for first times definitely try fish kebab . And do Remind them about your spices. So that they cook to taste

This restaurant is dedicated to the fish lovers of Kolkata, one will always find this restaurant empty as there are not many people who will indulge in eating only fish items in a restaurant. But the ones who dare to go there will have great time I can assure that.  They serve fish items in variety of styles-Indian, Chinese, Thai, Bengali, Continental etc. We tried Prawn Fritters and Ajwani Fish Tikka as starters - both were excellent, fish were fresh and juicy. For main course we ordered Steamed Rice with Prawn Green Curry which was not authentic Thai Green Curry but still was good, and Gondhoraj Vetki which was too rich, creamy and buttery, very tasty but not healthy due to too much butter and cheese contents. Ambience was ok. Service was slow and steady. overall had a very good experience at this unique fish themed restaurant.

I went there on a cold winter evening, because the name intrigued me. Being a fish lover who cannot eat most delicacies thanks to a severe seafood allergy, I stuck to the fish pepper salt. I daresay I loved the fish, which was fresh, not overcooked, and tasty. My partner found his prawn to be slightly saltier, but nothing that could not be remedied with some cold drink. Overall, the ambiance was laid back, and the food was all right. Maybe I am too demanding, but I would have liked the service to be a bit more attentive? Otherwise, good start.

First of all, you need to be a die-hard fish fan to truly savour this place to the last bite. I do not say this because it is all about fish, but because otherwise you would miss out on the different items to be tried. 
What sealed the deal for me specifically - a mix of Thai, Chinese, Mughlai and typical Bengali cuisines to choose from, secondly, the heavy use of Ghondoraj Lebu in at least one item from all the sections and the familiar yet exquisite choice of fish on the platter (bhetki, lobster, prawns, squid, pomfret, ilish). Once the menu card is handed over, one brush through and you know your pick.
My favourite for which I can definitely see myself visiting this place infinitely is the steamed Ghondoraj Bhetki. I have had Steamed Bhetki, Baked Bhetki, but this one is a food lover's gastronomic estacy. Four thick fillets of bhetki baked in a bowl full of cheese/white sauce, with a tinge of Ghondoraj Lebu and lemon grass. The foil opens, you go - ummm, looks delicious, and a mouthful makes the taste buds and sensory organs succumb to the flavour and aroma. Steamed rice is an absolute necessity to go with this dish. Pat yourself for having created one of the best instant risottos on a hot plate. 
Overall, it is definitely one of the most promising restaurants in town and I wish them good luck.

Very bad service ... will never go there. food is good but the kind of service we expect from a proper posh eating place is not at all here. Not at all professional and no courtsy. First they will keep you waiting. Then 15 min to bring a menu card and again slow food service. Finally another 20min to bring bill. If you tell them to be fast, they will behave rudely. They think people visiting their resturant have all time in life and no other work. Not at all expected ... Seriously dissapointed :-(

A great restaurant ever visited. I went there recently and had a very good experience. It is mainly a shop for fish items which are simply awesome and ambience is very comfy and nice. Staffs are informative and food quality is mind-blowing. I like the name of the restaurant 'fish fish'. For starters i had ordered Crab Cutlet,Fish pepper salt and Prawn fritters. You will get various kind of fish items. Then, at last for dinner i tasted the combo meal of Fish tikka Butter Masala, Rumali Roti. I would suggest you to taste the Prawn in Red Curry here. Overall had a very good time there and it is located beside a Sari Shop and kasturi restaurant. I would rate 4.0 for  FISH FISH.

fish fish is a little cozy restaurant in a little lane in south kolkata.we were just passing through when it crossed my vision. Being a piscetarian we decided to check its food.The kebabs & tikkas were tender & delicate.The preparation was very good.one plus thing this joint  is a regular haunt of Bengali film stars & you have a very good chance to bump into some of them...keep your camera ready..

Brilliant food. lovely cozy ambience. perfect mix of tradition and experimentation.

Loved it!

try out the fired icecream for dessert and the gondhoraaj bhetki with steamed rice for main course. the cheezy creamy sauce is just delicious!

Calcutta should have had such a shop much much earlier. Please think of opening smaller outlets at other cities in India for us fish-lovers!

It is a new place with great potential.I personally detest fish in all its edible forms but the food here was so good that i found the fish lover in me.I onle went for starters and dessert that day.Fish kalamari,the chef's personal favourite is mindblowing.Apart from that i really liked "lote macch er bora" and "chitol machh er kabab"-nice use of spices,not too heavy,not too light.In all,the starters were perfect.Though the tandoori platter i did not like much.

Among the desserts i would seriously recommend the Tofi Makhana.It is one of a kind and surely a dessert you would hate to miss.Fried icecream was good too.

The way they present the food here is really worth mentioning.The ambience is not really good since the place is still under renovation but the food here is better than many of the other highly priced bengali restaurants.

Surely it deserves a second visit.Thumbs up from me!

Fish Fish is all talk and no service. The concept is fresh but confused, the service is confused, the waiters are confused. They say they don't take table bookings on weekends, when we reached we saw a big table which was vacant. They promised to have us seated in 10 minutes, 15 minutes later they kept on doing their own work while the customers were still waiting at the counter without anyone communicating as to what was going on, a good 20 minutes later when we demanded to be seated we were told that the table was RESERVED for a group of 6 or 8 (on a weekend when they apparently don't take reservations). When we asked when we might get a table, the waiter snapped back rather rudely saying that people are eating and that he couldn't predict how long they would take to finish. Well he was clearly in the wrong profession since waiting time is a standard prediction all restaurants make. This utter nonsense left such a bad taste in the mouth that we're decided NOT to venture into the food at the joint. I hope the food is good for the sake of the Chef but wouldn't dare recommend it to even my sworn enemies just to spoil their evening with the lousy service.

Went to Fish Fish for lunch last week. Had topshe fry, prawn malai curry and a very deiicate hilsa bhapa in a light flavour.
Also ordered daal and fried potato julienne.
The topshe was ok but the other two were so politically correct that they contained way too little salt and I had to add some.
The julienne failed to arrive and we had to cancel the order.
Admittedly people around us were eating non Bangla dishes and appeared happy.
We will go in again, try the Asian and European menus and come back with fresh comments.
