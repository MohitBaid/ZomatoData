The pan fried memo is the best one... Other than that foods are not that much good... It is open on Sundays also unlike many other restaurants at this area.. it's pocket friendly..

One of many restaurants in Sealdah area. 
Not so good. It's a quite small place, by side of M. G. Road. As I live nearby for long, I've been there numerous times. And tried most of the foods on menu. 
Only one food that's quite good is Pan fried chicken momo. The chow, fried rice, chicken items...all are average or below average. South Indian foods are also not that good. 
The service is also poor. 
Only good thing is it remains open on Sundays (unlike many other nearby restaurants) , and opens at 11 am with about all foods available from that time. 
Not a good experience going there.

Not so good, cheap restaurant.... foods are oily and extremely spicy.... if you have a weak stomach, you should avoid.... But the only thing great about the place is the quantity they serve....

The worst place in the locality... From serving the rotten food to using unwashed plates they have done it all.... Clearly over priced and the quality of food will make u sick and its for sure...

One of the best places in sealdah area for Chinese and South Indian cuisine. It is a small place but packs in a yummy punch. A cosy, pocket friendly place.

Located on MG Road where the Sealdha Flyover just touches down. I had tasted their Chicken Chowmine and Momos. Momos are good and tasty. Their pan fried momo is really good with thin crust.
Chowmine are decent, good amount of Chicken and egg provide on the Chow.
Have also tasted their Chilli Chicken which was also good at just 100 bucks for a full plate.
Value for money :)

Best for its pan fried momo.

Tried chicken chowmin, momo of almost all type.

But my personal favorite is the chicken pan fried momo.

Didn't have to wait much for the order.

Annapurna used to have a bigger resturant which was present opposite to the puravi cinema hall. Now due to financial reasons the resturant shifted to a smaller version near the surendranath college. The food in this outlet is average. I really like the noodles here which is filling but my favourite would be the momos. A plate of chicken momos will cost you 50 and you will get 6 pieces along with chicken soup. I have heard of the good south indian cuisine but never really cared to try it.
