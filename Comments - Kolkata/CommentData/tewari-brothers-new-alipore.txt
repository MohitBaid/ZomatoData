Sudden cravings and traveling from near by brought me to  tiwary! Famous for there sweets I tried gulab jamun and it was just awesome! One of the best I've ever tried. Apart from that tried vada pav. It was good as a snack but gulab jamun won my heart!

This is a nice multi cuisine restaurant, but let me remind you, it's veg. But that is nothing sad. We don't hate veg, do we? You'll get every cuisine, starting from Chinese to South Indian to Mughlai to Street Food, and even Continental! A perfect place for a veg lover to go.

This place is one of the most famous sweet shop of Kolkata.The food here is up to the mark.Some good and some amazing.We visited here twice so I am here to write about both the times together.The first time we visited we ordered plenty of dishes and second time also it happened the same.Quantity is great and prices arw quite reasonable.The interior is quite descent.Overall a nice place for vegetarians as no non-veg dishes are available.Visited again recently.Actually whenever me and my boyfriend have to eat veg we prefer visiting this place.This place is no doubt serving some amazing veg dishes.

A good spot for vegan!
Food : upto the mark.
Ambiance and Sitting Arrangement : Good.
Price: Perfect for the dishes served.
I ordered :
1. Papri Chaat: superbly mixed all the ingredients, one can taste the different spices n chutneys used. The papris were crispy and fresh. A must try dish if u come here!
2.Kulfi with falooda: Being a fan of Kulfi always but not falooda, somehow i like this clubbing of falooda and Kulfi. Not so sweet, perfect blend of flavours. You can't miss this if u r visiting this place in summers.
3.Chola Bhatura: Bhatura was fresh n round. Perfect size. But the chola was overcooked, the colour of the dish was not at all appealing. Too much of spices have been used.
4.Stuffed Parantha with Paneer Curry: Parantha was good but little bit oily. Paneer Curry was really good, but could have been little bit less spicy.
5.Badam Milk: The showstopper, i must say. The drink was so soothing, had a flavour of kesar and badam(i guess almond). Perfectly blended. Definitely a must thing to order if u r here.

Went for breakfast yesterday. Despite us being one of the only three tables there, the service is painfully slow. We ordered dosas, and it seems everything here is cooked in ghee. Some people might have an appetite for food cooked in ghee and cheese, I personally despise it. It was one of the most oily food I've tried in recent times.

"Tewari Brothers" is one of the well known shops in New Alipore area, specializing in different kinds of sweets and pure vegeterian savouries. Just a short walk from Taratala, it's very conveniently located opposite the Raymond showroom in New Alipore Block E. Spread across two floors, the ground floor makes up for the sweet counter and a small seating area while there is a dedicated dine-in on the first floor.

Though mainly known for sweets made out of pure ghee and catering to North Indian tastes, they have also forayed into flavored sandesh succumbing to recent trends. Craving for dahi chats, mum and I paid a visit today evening...

‚èπDahi Papri Chat & Dahi Tikki Chat - Will rate both as below average. Served with sprinkles of chopped coriander, generous amounts of sev, chutneys and chat masala. Excessively sweet due to an imbalance between the tamarind and green chutneys and I was somehow missing that pinch of roasted cumin powder that could have made some difference. Also, the dahi (curd) used in the chats felt like a couple days old. Very disappointing!üòæ

‚èπDhokla - They were soft and fluffy, garnished with grated coconut, chopped coriander leaves and tempered mustard seeds and green chillies. Proved to be another let down with the sweetness of the dhoklas almost killing us.üôÄ

‚èπGulab Patti Sandesh (Rose Petal Sandesh) - Chose the gulab patti one from their section of flavored sandesh. Mildly sweet, the rose petal on top is used for mere decoration and name sake as the sandesh itself is tasteless. This section of sweets can well be given a miss!

Prices are reasonable and service is promt. After years of visits, I will recommend trying their
KAJU BARFIS (best you can find üòª), Gulab jamuns, Kalakand, Kaju Pista Rolls and Ghee laddoos as these are some of the few items that have been consistent in terms of both taste and quality and always see repeat purchases!

Tewari Brothers, the house of pure ghee sweets is how they like describing themselves- has multiple outlets one of them being at New Alipore. Being a two storey building, they serve both savoury snacks ranging from kachori to even your favorite veg pizza, and also sweet items. Food quality is excellent and they receive a well-deserved 4.0 from my end. Keep up the great work!

This place is one of the places for vegetarians to fill their empty tummies without having a hole in their pockets. This is the ultimate Hub for Marwaris during Navratri. This is one of the best places to have sweet and savoury both. Their kulfi is just the best in town.
You can always give a try to this place.

This is a great place to go to for both sweet and savoury. They have a lot of variety in their sweets and since I have a sweet tooth I love them all. For special occasions when you need sweets you can order and they even make special to your specifications. Some occasions call for ladoos and they make special ghee ladoos and give in different packets which can be distributed. Good quality sweets, they maintain their standards. They also have a variety of chaats, all tangy and yummy. On the first floor they have seating and serve north Indian and south Indian cuisine as well. All their food maintain a good standard though the prices are slightly on the higher side, but acceptable if standard remains good.

The sweet shop located on the ground floor presents wide variety of spread cooked in pure desi ghee. This aroma always draws my attention towards the shop when i visit this area. What I like more are their attractive swwet and namkin packs for gift purposes.

A people's choice for veggies in around new alipore and behala people . This place has been there for years now and has been consistently serving good quality veggies for especially marwaris and bengali veg enthusiasts .

¬∞ Location :- Close to state Bank new alipore .

¬∞ Ambience & Service ( 3 / 5 ) :- The ground floor is for the sweet section and the top floor us for the snacks . Seating is available in both the floors . The top one is usually favored in you are there for a meal .The service is really fast for regular items and a tad slow for the items which are not ordered regularly . 

¬∞ Food :- Have been there a lot of times, but have never managed to write something about the food . So, finally managed to grab a bite recently.  We had :- 

1. Cheese corn Toast ( 4 / 5 ) :- One of the costliest yet yummiest items in the menu . Since , this is not ordered much the serving will take some time . But, once you get it you will be overwhelmed . 2 pieces of bread with cheesy goodness on top and corns mixed with the cheese . That's yummy written all over it . Hardly get cheese corn Toast everywhere so went there specially for this dish and was not dissapointed .

2. Plain lassi ( 4 / 5 ) :- Worth every penny . This one is thick , full of malai and every sip will hit you with the awesome flavor . A drink that will refresh you and fill your tummy at the same time . A must recommended .

Other than the items mentioned above the following items are highly recommended :- 

1. Chole bature .
2. Pav bhaji ( A must try )
3. Raj kachori 
4. Roti & Tadka 

Those who still have not tried it yet must give up all the inhibitions and get here and get blown away by good quality food . A must try for veggies of South Kolkata .

One of the popular sweet shop & veg restaurant in the area. Not being much of a sweet tooth myself, I often visit there for their different snacks. I love the chats there.
I have tried nearly every variety of chat available there. One plate is enough for a person. The food quality is good & very much reliable. The price is okay.
They have the veg restaurant in the 1st floor where chinese & south indian items are being provided. Though many of the names in the menu are always not avaible. 
And to sit in the upper floor you have to order something from there otherwise you will only have the ground floor chairs which wont give any comfort eating or privacy either.
Even though most poeple go there for their sweets, but their veg restaurant is also worth checking out.

Spread across two floors, my first interaction with Tewari Brothers was actually at their Beckbagan branch, when my brother took me there and we had Gajar ka Halwa. Well, that was many many years back. This particular outlet happens to be quite popular among the locals. And rightly so, they specializes in making Jain food, that is without onion or garlic. While the ground floor is used to purchase sweets, a separate dine-in section exists on the first floor. Tried the Chola Bature and Lassi here, both of them were fantastic and filled up my hungry tummy. The prices have increased a bit, but these people still maintain the same quality.

Tewari Sweets are one of the premium brands serving the sweet teeth all around.

Location:
Located at New Alipur main road this outlet is just near to the SBI ¬†bank.

Experience:
A two floored outlet with ground floor being the sweet shop and upstairs serving quick snacks items from Chats,Pizzas to different kachoris along side,

Tewari is famous for their laddus and its a must try. Wide range of quality sweets with everyones favorite options. Also the Jalebis are too tasty to describe as well. Among their snacks I loved their Chola bhatura along with the ¬†the Dosas which is absolutely a killer dish here. Do not miss them at all. Highly recommended.

This is a regular for the Veg population of the area and it‚Äôs a stampede during festive days. They have managed to keep the quality of food to its reputation inspite of the surge in demand. It is a few blocks from the Taratala crossing. Although, the service is quite slow though & the prices have increased a tad over the last 2 years. The rajbhog & chole bhature will be my picks, sumptuous & pocket friendly.

Great option for vegetarians.I personally love their Chana Batora.one plate has two huge pieces and can easily fill up 2 for an evening snack.The channa masala accompanying it is the tastiest I have tasted.
The mini thalus are also a good option and more than enough for a person.The chinese idli is a tasty snack,and their badam milk shake has such huge amount of badam bits that the straw gets jammedand one has to scoop out with spoon.
Two complaints,service is really slow.Also,the prices have increased quite a bit.Zomato needs to update its menucard.now the chana batora is Rs.100/- and thali is Rs.200/-

Tiwari new alipore has some delicious pure vegetarian food and we often get Sabzi Kachori, Samosa, jalebi, Khasta kachori from there for breakfast. Being a pure vegetarian outlet which does not serve onion and garlic, this place is a blessing for the surrounding vegetarian communities in new alipore and nearby areas. They also serve falaahar or Vrat ka khana during Navratri and other festivals which is very convenient. The confectionery counters are on the ground floor while on the first floor is a food court where you can sit down and savor all sorts of vegetarian food, main course and snacks alike. Their Dosas are superb and loaded with ghee which I personally love.

Tewari Brothers has been some high quality sweets and snacks for a long time. This place can be located just few steps away from State Bank of India in New Alipore Main Road. Its a two floored place. The ground floor is basically for sweet counter and the upper floor is for dine in. They serve some good variety of vegetarian dishes. The quality of their sweets and food has been high since they have started. I have been to this place many a times to take away sweets. The sweets are extremely delicious and the packaging is excellent.
As I am not a great vegetarian food fan its not that often I visit for dine in. Still few dishes are made superbly made which drags me down to this place.

What to order?
Corn de villa Pizza : They make it simple and great. The toppings are of cheese, onions, corn and tomatoes. I love the small size pizza here. And the price is very reasonable too.

Dilliwaale Chole Bhature : Another dish which I take often when I visit this place. The Bhature size is large and the chole is delicious making it a perfect filler for your stomach.

Rajkachori : One of my all time favourite place for having Rajkachori. This place nails this particular dish. The ingredients which they use inside the Raj Kachori is just delicious with a good amout of curd making it awesome.

Lassi : They make very good lassi too. Always a good option.

Gulam Jamun : Hot, big and delicious. Thats give you the overall hint 


Last Words:
A definite go to place for having quality sweets and have some good vegetarian dishes. The place is spacious cozy and a decent place to go with your family.

4/5 for this place for sure

I have been quite regular to this place which is overall very good and gives an excellent option to carry home pure-ghee sweets. It is located in New Alipur (Block-E) quite close to the State Bank of India branch. I have mostly been to their ground floor section for the sweets but they have arrangements upstairs where you can sit down and have your food like chhole bhature, papri chat, lassi, dosa, kachoris, noodles, etc. So it is an upgraded version of the typical sweet shop and is actually a restaurant! Though I am yet to visit their upstairs dine-in section.

The staffs at the ground floor are pretty efficient these days and overall courteous. Also the prices are quite reasonable (though not on the lower side) which should bring you back for more. But the best part is the pure-ghee sweets which I love at this place. 

The jalebis, gulab jamuns, kaju barfi, laddoos are to die for. I am a big fan of Kaju Barfi in general and this is the place I trust for my personal box of this sweet dish! It‚Äôs not overtly sweet and the texture is just perfect, I have tried Kaju Barfi at numerous places but this is the place which hits the bull‚Äôs eye! If you are at New Alipur area then you can not miss out these pure-ghee delicacies for sure!

Cheers!

Almost bang opposite to Krishna cafe in the New Alipore. The ambiance of this place is nothing special to talk about, the second floor has the seating area where you can have your food.¬†

Neat, clean and friendly staff. Ordered coley baturey, hot gulab jamun and lassi, I really do not know why such I ordered for such an odd combination but that's how it goes. One plate of choley baturey I think will make you full enough that you would like to skip the meal. The taste is really good. Hot gulab jamun was too good. Lassi also tasted great. If you are in this place don't miss out on the Gulab jamun.

Well, I've been to this place with my college buddies earlier, a good number of times, on different occasions, and it used to be one of our preferred destination for casual hangout over some quick bites during our college days.
So, in terns of taste and quality of the food they serve, the non-dessert items can be placed somewhere between average and good, but so far the desserts(sweets) of this place are concerned, its awesome. Even today I can get back to my memoirs and feel that lingering taste of their hot gulab jamun!! its that delicious!!
Ambience is good but service is a bit slow, and service staffs also need to get rid of their lethargic attitude I must say.
So overall its a good/okay place to check in for some quick bites without much of a pocket pinch. But if sweetmeats are something that makes your day, its a must visit for you.

Tewari Brothers located right on the new Alipore road past Taratala - is one of the best sweet shops in this area known for their Pedas, Barfis, Laddoos and SonPapris. The shop is hugely crowded during active hours, so you would have to toil a bit to get your items. Their Kaju Barfi is undoubtedly one of the best in Kolkata. The Kaju barfi comes in various alternative forms as well apart from the regular one - for example, the anjir kaju barfi or the kesar kaju barfi. Their normal barfi is too very good. The Laddoo is made of pure ghee and tastes delicious. The sonpapris are also made of pure ghee and extremely good. The gulab jamun is extremely well made and tastes heavenly after it is heated properly. I have also heard that their snack items are also good - though I haven't tried them personally so won't be able to comment. Overall - recommended.

Samosas, Kachauris, variety of sweets - Tewari Brothers is a melange of amazing sights, smells and juiciest of sweets. Eating at this place after so many years brought back memories of yummyness.

The strawberry rasagulla, the rajbhog and imartis were just brilliant and I am going to go and eat at this place everyday on this trip to good old Kolkata.

Cheers,

If you wanna enjoy a delicious chaat after an evening walk this is the place. Located near taratala, this veg joint serves one of the tastiest chaats and kulfi in Kolkata. And their lassi is thick and yummy. The price is reasonable also. I never tried their sweets so can't comment on that.

All that a Marwari needs when hungry is SAMOSA from Tewari... one of the oldest, famous for sweets and snacks with another outlet at Bara Bazar where i have been going since i was a kid. Glad that another one was opened very near to my place.... i just love the Kaju and Badam Barfi, Rajbhog, Nariyal chakki, Ladoos, Kalakand ,Baikunth Bhog, Lassi, Kulfi with lachha.......and the list can go on and on..... awesome and lovely!! They also have a meal counter in the 2nd floor to add on to all this and its fairly good. Thankfully its there and open when i get back home....

This is one of my fav sweet shops in new alipore. Its purely vegetarian .. they don't even give onions. I absolutely love their hot gulabjamuns oozing with sugar syrup. They melt in your mouth like dream. From my umpteen visits I like their lip smacking jalebis, chole bhature,  chole tikki, chaat. I even love their kesar lassi.

Situated in a very convenient location this place is not at all hard to find. Just in the Taratala mor moving towards New Alipore. I went here with a friend, this is a completely and purely vegetarian restaurant. We ordered the Veg Thali and Kesar Koolfi Falooda as dessert . The food and the dessert both were delicious. The service was good as well. We had a good time.

This outlet is the closest to my place. Not really New Alipore, the exact location is Taratala. The Paw Bhajis, Chole Batora, Dahi Chaat they make is amazing! They also provide great south indian food starting from Upma to several kinds of dosas. A must visit for a veg foodie indeed. Love the tasty veg food here.  The north indian mini meal as they say isn't really mini. It's really enough for one to eat. Quantity and Quality no doubt is good. Recommended.

Tiwari brothers are situated just around the corner to taratala.visited the joint yesterday. The staff are courteous and helpful but couldn't find that many wet sweets with them.otherwise there is a fare of dry marwari sweets. The khir mohan tasted nothing of kheer and only of elaichi. Even the kesar chamcham tasted of elaichi and I.hate so much of that spice in any food. Well the mawa cake,mango kalakand , and kaju barfi were nice. The elaichi taste is a bit too much and kept on lingering even afterwards :-(

Most of the sweets in our home are bought from here.They serve only pure ghee products.Nothing can beat their traditional sweets like ghee laddu,amriti,gulab jamun,sohan papdi, kaju barfi, kalakand...and many more.They r just yum.Their faluda koolfi is amazing.Tewari brothers serve best chaats in terms of size,filling..and most importantly TASTE! Their rajkachori chaat is difficult even for 2 person to finish.I like their dhoklas too.

They serve tasty chats and how can i forget to mention the jalebi.. Yum yum yum.. Their jalebis are served hot, right from the kadhai. U can see even the making of the jalebis. The outlet in new alipur in quite big and one can find a great number of options to choose from. The tewaris.. One of my fav misti...

Although the name brings in a lot of expectations from this joint but the overall experience is one which you wouldn't consider good enough for remembering. While the sweets are above average, they are way below the levels of other joints such as Haldirams n Gupta Brothers to name a few. The food is exceptionally boring and one you wouldn't really want to eat after just a few bites. All in all... maybe you could just visit once... so that you have a some what idea of where the 'mediocre' benchmark lies!

The sweets are very good and that is why I hoped the food at this joint will be as good. But I was wrong. The food was quite average. The restaurant though conveniently located had no other customers at the time we went there, and there was an uncomfortable feeling in the air, which I think women will be able to understand. the over-friendly staff did not help it and we felt watched and did not like the attention. We finished our food quickly and went away and will not be returning there soon.

Sweet is Kolkata's second name, be it the people, the language or the food. Tewari brothers is my favourite dessert shop in the entire country. Try their Kulfi with falooda, it's absolutely amazing. Coming to the sweets what I loved was their Anjeer katris, but my favourite is the Kala Jamun.. Maaaaan its so worth the calorie mountain you are gonna devour. Also try their Kalakand, it is so rich. All their products are made in Desi Ghee and are just out of this world. If you are from another city and willing to take some sweets home, this is the place you need to hit.

"Tewari brothers" is a prominent and one of the most preferred names when it comes to sweets and other desserts. This outlet of tewari brothers is located on your way towards taratala and nearby new alipore branch state bank of india. This outlet is located in a multi-storeyed building with a posh decor. The ground floor comprises of the sweets section and the main course offerings are served on 1st floor which is also decently decorated and has comfortable sitting arrangements. Any festivals like diwali, rakhi, durga puja etc would be incomplete without sweets from tewari especially their mouth watering and succumbing ghee laddoos( those are just devine). Almost every sweet in this outlet has a distinctive and royal flavor and pure desi ghee is one of their most important ingredient which is worth cherishing till the last bite. If you are in search of pure and authentic flavor and breathe taking aroma of ghee in your laddoo then this is the place you should be.

The yellow dal fry ordered was thin and should have been more thick. The mixed vegetable had more paneer than veggies. Also all items as per the menu are not available as i was told that either black daal or yellow daal will be available based on which one they made that day. They alternate the daals on daily basis.

Situated in Burra Bazaar, Tewari Brothers is famous for its Ladoos. Any why not, it does produces the best boondi ladoo in town!! A place frequented mostly by the Marwaris. 99.9% non-bengalis marriages order ladoos from Tewari Brothers. Other delicacies that you will like are motipak, kaju barfi, gulab jamun, imarti. Everything they prepare is of desi ghee. Their samosas are different and taste good but over-priced.

Location: New Alipore. 

This outlet of the Tewari Chain is located few minutes away from State Bank Of India while travelling from Durgapur Bridge towards Behala. 
This outlet is way different from other outlets since it has a dining area on the first floor. Yes, it's a two-level outlet. 
The ground floor also has a few tables so that one can sit and enjoy the snacks. 
One can enjoy North Indian, Chinese and Snacks at the dining area on the first floor. 

Being near to my place, have visited this outlet a number of times. One thing you would always notice is this place would always be crowded with people who would have either come to make takeaways, get bulk orders, dine-in or a simple quickbite. 

Food Recommendation: 
-Chola Bhatura 
-Radha Bhallavi
- Kachori Sabji
- Jalebi
-Samosa
-Raj Kachori
-Papri Chaat
-Paneer Butter Masala 
-Dal Makhani (Black Dal) 
-Naan
-Dosa
-Kulfi (with falooda)
-Lassi 

The service here is a bit inconsistent, but, the staff is courteous and polite. A little knowledge about the menu to them would be a plus. 
Budget friendly prices.

Overall has always been a good experience.

Tewari brothers 

Tewari brothers is located at many places , I tried the one located in new Alipore its near Himalaya opticals  , block -E .this place is quite famous for its desi ghee mithai's . It even has a restuarnt.

Pros :
1)its a mithai shop cum Resturant where one can come and sit and eat .
2)I tried the chola bhatura, it was made in ghee, tasted good . 
3)even tried the dahi kachori which was really good . 
4)their kulfi with faluda its highly recommended .

Cons :
1)the staff are not well trained.
2)its a bit high on the prices . 

Overall tewari brother is a good shop for mithai's and to grab a quick bite its a 3.5 from me .
