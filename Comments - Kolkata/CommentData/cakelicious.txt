"If you're trying to create a company, it's like baking a cake. You have to have all the ingredients in the right proportion." -  Elon Musk

The warmest corner in neighbourhood of Alimuddin street, Taltala Cakelicious is serving honest bakes, cakes.

Fatema Barodawala, belongs to the IT industry. She is currently also working with Wipro. What made Her start this bakery was that she is a Big time foodie. And she has this sweet tooth. So she started learning bits from YouTube and tried to get her basic cake right. Being self-tutored her bakes exhibit earnestness in their ingredients, art in their looks and home in their taste.Then she ventured in more and discovered her passion lies in here. The journey of Delicious cakes at Cakelicious has started.

Her mother has played a big role in her dream journey. She's been very supportive in terms of letting her experiment..and motivating her at all times.

The Dishes We Had :

Choco Chip cookies ( egg less ) - To appease your sweet tooth as well as sudden hunger pangs what better flavour of cookie to make than chocolaty ones! Delightful Eggless Chocolate Cookies, which have an ideal melt-in-the-mouth texture and the sweet scent of vanilla, speckled with chocolate chips, which added more joy to every bite.

Brownie - Satisfy your chocolate cravings with these cocoa brownies. These brownies turned out amazing!! Dense, fudgy middles and crinkly tops made us fall in love with brownies.¬†

Brioche Veg -  Oh brioche, I think I loved you! Your rich and tender crumb, flaky crust. Your neither bread nor pastry, you don‚Äôt care, and pretty easy really! Your not like the other breads. Something wonderful happened with these plateful of brioche.

Berry cake - This beauty is baked love and layered with a sweet raspberry filling, both of which offer bright counterpoints to the thick layer of chocolate-cream cheese frosting and whole berries scattered in between.

Blueberry Chocolate cupcake -  These pretty [weird] little purple cakes are the result of roasting some blueberries until they burst and explode. Fun fun fun. And messy. Oh! And hot. RIP taste buds.

Chocolate with vanilla cupcake - Yummy it was great and easy.Cupcakes are a universal favorite. Vanilla and chocolate swirl together in these cupcakes to make a beautiful and delicious combination. Top them with pearlized sprinkles to complete the elegant look.

Red velvet with cherry toping cupcake - Red Velvet cupcakes topped with Cream Cheese Cake Batter frosting.  And decorated with these adorable cherries, what could be better?

Vanilla Blueberry cupcake - Like I always say, there is nothing more imperative in a baker‚Äôs recipe collection than a basic, delicious vanilla cupcake recipe! And Cakelicius had it rightly listed and taste was fascinating too.

¬†
Donuts - Ultimate indulgence, purely heaven, tender and airy, sinfully good, fit for foodie like us.

Cake is something which no one can‚Äôt ignore.if he/she may be very much health conscious but still whenever everyone heard the name of desserts they can‚Äôt stop themselves from eating.there are varieties of cake shops and bakeries,but now a days home bakery is a new trend.i went to several places and tried their home made cakes,donuts as well as cookies,cup cakes.quite hard for me differentiate between which home bakery is good and which one is the best.few days back i went to a homemade bakery to taste some delicious cakes,cookies & cup cakes.i was really surprised by the decoration,how beautifully they decorated all those things.well this place is located near Taltola,Alimuddin Street.they prepared varieties of sweet desserts which was superb in taste.both the egg and egg less cakes are amazing in taste.

Amazing cakes. Really well customised and very different in styling. This is so exotic. Great work dear Baker. This cake from Cakelicious was out of the world. It was so yummy and looked so great. The chocolate balls on top were simply amazing. Too brilliant one of the best in Kolkata without question. So much in love with this.
