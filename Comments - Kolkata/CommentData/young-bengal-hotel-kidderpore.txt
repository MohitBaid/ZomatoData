Total "Bangaliana"..... Excellent choice of food with lots of bengali fish dishes. Service is good! Every "Bong" should try this place out! Price is quite cheap.

The quality of food is awesome in this place. The kind of fish they serve is fresh compared to other restaurants and the price is quite reasonable too. One will feel the charm of old days here. The location of this place is not so convenient to many, but if you are a foodie and have a crave for authentic Bengali food, this place is then a must visit.

It's my nostalgia.
It's my college days hotel.
After 4 years I came here yesterday.
Ordered sukto, dal, ful kopi, Tangra macher jhal, bhetkir Paturi and chatni.
The cheapest hotel with very delicious authentic bengali foods in Kolkata.

My memories came alive.
Shankar da still serves food and aunty at cash counter.

Please don't miss food here.

In a nutshell:

A pice hotel opened in 1930s, that still serves authentic Bengali food made from fresh ingredients. If u r in Kolkata and want to try local food as it is cooked at home, either get invited to someone's home or visit here.

Short description - in case u r in a hurry:

Yes, u read it right - Pice hotel. ‘Pice’ was a currency denomination in colonial India. This ‘Pice hotel’ concept was common in that era where every item had to be paid for separately, including salt, onions and lemon wedges. Nowadays they serve salt on the house but rest r still charged.

‘Young Bengal’ movement happened nearly a century before this restaurant opened. It seems the founder was inspired during the centenary celebrations.

It is a 1930s restaurant & nothing much seems to have changed inside. Even the signboard on the façade is completely worn out & faded.

As we entered the gate, we landed in a courtyard, beyond which there was a thatched roof building in which this restaurant is located.

The interiors had some old framed press coverage of this restaurant. The furniture was wood & marble.

Office goers eat here regularly, doctors from nearby hospital, police, army, dock employees, businessmen in the area. Once in a while during occasions do they get people from outside the neighbourhood coming to eat here. However they get NRIs, foreigners etc also as customers who come here after reading on internet.

Bengali food is subtle - quite opposite of North Indian food. One has to develop the taste and appreciation. Please avoid this restaurant if ‘subtle food’ appears to b bland to u. If u appreciate East Indian food, u wud love it.  

Food is home like - with not 'on the face masalas', fresh ingredients and a tinge of sweet - as in 'ghoti' homes.

For the uninitiated, 'bangal' was the term used to describe Hindu families who migrated from east Bengal in early to mid 1900s and 'ghoti' referred to the original inhabitants of West Bengal.

Staff was not in uniform. Nice & warm people who took immense care of us when we were dining.

There is no menu card. Items were hand written with chalk on a black board.

Detailed description - in case u hv the time to njoy reading:

Mochar ghonto with chingri ( banana flower curry with shrimps). It was like home made but as on the day guests r coming, the mom wud make it a bit spiced up (yet not on the face). Tinge of sweet, crunchy mocha tasted yumm. Flavours of masalas made their presence felt. Rate it 4.5/5.

We next tried Pui shak chorchori with macher muro (poi leaves curry with fish head). The curry was intense, robust, rustic. It had pungency of mustard oil & had burnt feel that added flavour. Fish flavour permeated the curry. The dish was excellent. Rate it 4.5/5

Dal was super simple with 'barely there' spices. It was thin and yumm. Soul food for many Bengalis. Rate it 4.25/5

Aloo bhaja (fried potato) was perfect match stick size and shape. It was crispy and perfectly salted. No more value additions. Just like home. It was not freshly made and served but was made sometime bk / I guess 30 mins bk. had it been freshly made, wud hv rated it 4.5/5. As it is, Rate it 4.25/5

Dhokhar dalna (curry of lentil cakes) had strong asafoetida flavour that was enjoyable. It was not hard and was not crumbling away either. Perfect texture. A hint of sweet, salt and hot were very well balanced. Loved the gravy as well. Rate it 4.25/5.

Fish Paturi (fish wrapped in banana leaf) was excellent. It was not made in shorshey bata (mustard paste) but with onion, ginger , garlic paste. The marinade was brown in color, had a sweetish tinge, was somewhat hot and marvellous to eat. Juices of the fish amalgamated with the marination. The fish was flaky, juicy and yumm. Excellent overall. Rate it 4.75/5

Parshey shorshey was very good as well. The fish itself was fresh and very good. It was soft and yumm, inspite of the fact that it was deep fried a bit over optimally. The gravy was not extremely pungent but was pretty well balanced. Rate this dish 4.25/5.

Chingri malay curry was not a true blue Malay curry but a very nice prawn curry. It didn't have the thick coconut milk base. However the gravy was flavourful and very tasty. Flavours of both prawns and spices made their presence felt. The prawn was tasty but a bit rubbery. Rate the dish 4.25/5

Mutton kosha was not a mutton kosha the way we r used to eating at commercial joints.  It was a great home style mutton jhol. Rate it 4.25/5

We also tried pulao – mild sweet, soft independent grains of rice, with cashew in it. Nice, flavorful & tasty on its own. Rate it 4/5

Tomato chutney (pronounced by server as tomatom) was very good. Tinge of sweet, sour & salt. Rate it 4.25/5.

Mango chutney was sweet & sour, with a tinge of salt. Loved it & ordered an extra bowl. Rate it 4.25/5

The overall rating of food at Young Bengal averages out to 

However the joy of eating here is way beyond rating.

The Young Bengal Hotel in Khidderpore is an 87 year old restaurant that still caters to more than 200 people every day.
The simple meals of rice, a variety of fish curries and vegetables are delicious and fresh. If you want to taste heritage in very bite, this is the place to be.
Negatives are the bare interiors, cramped during lunch hours, but people go by the quality of their food. If you are a fish lover, try the local fishes like pabda, rui and others. The food is light on the palate, just like home-cooked Bengali food.The lunch hours start around 11 and end by 3 and dinner from 8 to 10.Dont't forget to give a call before coming here because the food finishes really quick and they make limited quantities and not as per order.
