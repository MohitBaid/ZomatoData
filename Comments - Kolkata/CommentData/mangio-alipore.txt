The most creatively appetising meal in the town.Steeply priced yet worth every penny.
Each dish is such a visual treat and Just oh so perfect on the tastebuds.
The to die for hot chocolate was so chocolatey and creamy to the yummy spiced watermelon salad was one of the best that I’ve ever had.
The beet root & goat cheese ravioli just melts in the mouth and super yummy.The thin crust pizza was just average and not the best I’ve had.
Over all quite an amazing place with all day dining options.

Unfortunately this restaurant with so good ambience doesn't serve good food and the staff ain't courteous either. The chilly cheese toast they served was not up to the mark and not at all worth the price. When I asked the staff to do something with the food he did not do anything. And told that the food is ready nothing can be done. What kind of service is this? They don't even care about the customer's satisfaction.

This place has been existing for a long time now in the Kolkata food scene and has been constant in its food and service according to my family who visit here quite often.
The set up is very casual and comfortable. The menu is decent and the restaurant is also backed by Kooki Jar for confectioneries.

What we ordered:

-Chef Salad : beautiful and fresh. We asked for extra feta cheese and it made the salad even better tasting.

-Mushroom Cappucino : it was a little too grainy for my taste. I have had this dish in a couple os restaurants,the broth is smoother andthe mushroom tastes sings more than in this place. But it wasn't too bad

-Chicken Stroganoff :again just a good dish,nothing extra ordinary but not bad as well. It had taste but somehow I felt the oomph was missing.

-Chocolate Sandwich with Belgian Ice Cream : the sponge was decent but the belgian ice cream was the best part of this dessert. I would rather just get couple of scoops only of the icecream.

The service was quick since we were the only people on a weekday afternoon and the prices were nominal (around 700-800 per head)

They have a fresh food, courteous staffs and beautiful decor. Little bit of pricey things are definitely there but at times you'll like it and won't have any regret.

I went to this fine dining restaurant when they were having some Italian food festival on 27-31st July,2017. I've ordered he Risotto but it was really not suitable for my palate. It couldn't WOO my heart and my palate and I'm really sorry about that. The sphaghetti which was the other dish I've ordered was good but the amount was quite less than the price. They forgot to serve the bread which is must, but I had to demand that as my birthright (never mind)! 

Foodies can definitely take a look on Kookie Jar which is beside the Manjio, and enjoy some munchies they have.

I went there with one of my friend and regretted the very first moment after reaching, their taste in music is horrible, they played a song by Honey Singh. Urrrgggh.
Secondly, they didn't even serve us water till we asked for it.
Third, we ordered Espresso single, both the quality and quantity sucked. It was horrible in taste.
But yeah, gotta agree with the fact that the ambience was good, BUT only because of the fancy lights.
Anyway, wouldn't even think of visiting the place again. Total waste of money, and not even worth the time.

I don't think that this place is worth the money and time. Me and my friend went here today and ordered Espresso. The coffee was horrible, the amount was just like we drink in those 10-15 rs cups of coffee and the price was touching the roofs. I do not recommend this place if you're looking for a place with affordable dishes and coffees, unless you're a billionaire.

Mangio is located in Alipore, in the kookie jar floor. 
Their ravioli is a must try and also their thin crust margherita pizza is a must try. If you're going their for just a meeting, then do try their hot chocolate, the hot chocolate is a must have.

Mangio is one place which has been consistently serving quality food since years now! Their pasta, pizza and the risotto are all quite nice though the place is slightly over priced. The desserts obviously are amazing KJ's bakery backing them. Would be good if they could now revise the menu and come out with new dishes since in the vegetarian options and reconsider their pricing given their portioning.

I have come here often since the day it opened. It was a favorite of mine until my last experience. The ambiance is still classy. The food has consistently deteriorated but is still delicious especially there new additions (try out the spiced watermelon salad, the salad with the oranges which's name I can't remember and the new Lebanese dish with pita pockets). If my review were limited to the food it would have probably been a 4.5 or 5 star review(I don't understand some of the negative reviews here, the food is definitely worth trying, I think most people were shocked by the price which is very very high). Sadly, I also must take into account service - I had to wait forty-five minutes for a salad which was served after the main dish. They literally gave the same dish we ordered to a table that had been seated 10 minutes after us, before they managed to give it to us. Also they forgot one of my orders. Needless to say, I didn't leave a tip. Neither will I be visiting again.
However, I don't wish to pass my bad experience on to the rest of you. Thus, I would still suggest you visit this restaurant. The food is certainly worth it, if nothing else is.

See what you can flare up with traditional Bong ingredients (like Bhetki, Lamb etc). Bong fusion at its best! Try the mains. Make sure you leave room for the desserts! On the higher side of prices for a cafe cum restaurant. But good tasty food overall.

Tucked inside a Kookie Jar outlet in New Alipur is the Mangio, where I landed up with a few friends on a rainy evening. The staff was a little clueless when asked if we could take pictures of the place, and that included the manager, which I found to be very surprising indeed. 

The menu was big, and full of seductive descriptions but sadly one of the salad which I was very excited to see, wasn't available. I always prefer small menus of which everything is available, rather than the reverse. 

I am an ardent ravioli lover and ordered the Beetroot and Goat-cheese Ravioli in Walnut Cream and Parmesan Gravel. The thin, wonderfully even, al-dente pasta pouches were filled with not-so-generous amounts of a filling which sung of beetroot and goat's cheese unmistakably. The walnut cream coated the two generously and was lovely and velvety. 

The Pizza however, was very ordinary and largely unimpressive. 

So my rating would be for the ravioli and that only. There are loads of improvements to be made before they can justify the price they charge for their food.

"All that glitters is not gold", is the perfect tagline to describe "Mangio". Initially it is very impressive to walk in as the beautifully decorated interior and the mellifluous ambience provides you a soothing charm, a fine diner is expected to possess. In fact it immediately creates a high expectation which ultimately sublime when you take your first bite or sip.
Honestly, the food is very ordinary and not at all justified with the price they charge against it.
Specially the "Beetroot and Goat Cheese Ravioli in Walnut sauce and Parmesan Gravel", is a sheer disappointment if the taste & quantity is compared with the price they charge.
Even the pizzas they serve, look stunning but fails to impress if the taste and the price is taken into consideration.
The service is courteous and prompt though.

So it is advised not to go by appearance,
as it can be deceptive enough to turn down your dine-in/walk-in experience.

Located in a posh area, this place is attached to a famous bakery Kookie jar which is more popular than Fury's now . It is most convienant to meet friends as one can use it as a coffee joint and also for lunch . The pizzas there are good and so are the juices . One can have a variety of tea but coffee options are limited , 
The service and ambience is ideal for meeting up with friends , 
It is not wheelchair friendly as there is no ramp from the road to the footpath , and there are 2 steps at the entrace.

OK now this is one place I find uselessly expensive for things which aren't even unique or special. Whatever you get here is something you get in any CCD or cafe. Nothing special about this place. I understand people in Kolkata make a lot of money but wasting it behind overtly priced food with nothing special to it is Stupid. I'm sorry I even came to this place.
2/5 is for the service and behaviour of the staff.

Last week I had been to this place for coffee. And this place turned out to be decent enough. I have orders for a Cafe Mocha and Fresh Fruit Pudding. The coffee tasted more like a hot chocolate served with a cinnamon stick on top. Which totally gave me the cinnamon flavour in my mouth. The coffee wasn't that strong though. 
The Fresh Fruit Pudding was super delicious, very much fresh and soft. Loved the pudding. 
The ambience of the place was good. Wasn't that crowded. 
The service providers were quite friendly. Wish to visit this place again.

Oh my god this place is fantastic. 

I've been in and out of Calcutta every year all my life because of family, and Mangio has always been my favorite place in the city. It's cute, and it's extremely well presented in its simplicity. 

Food: if you don't mind the smokey taste, the smoked tomato soup is TO DIE FOR. I'm dead serious, you won't regret it. Next, I can guarantee you haven't had a Caesar salad in the way they present it here. I really love the mushroom risotto as well. 

Finally, if you like chocolate, do yourself a favor and get a chocolate boat or two (or three). You will not be disappointed.

Overall, I absolutely love this place :)

Its a outlet in enclave mall new alipore. We went there during evening time. The ambience was quiet and relaxing. At first we ordered fresh apple juice and roasted chicken amd onion soup.umn the soup was really yummy. We felt more refreshed after the fresh apple juice. Then we ordered tenderloin steak and lamb shank. My partner really liked his steak as it was cow meat and he loves to have cow meat always. And my lamb shank was pretty good but it was a way more salty. I mean i like salt but it was a little bit more salty.except that part my lamb was delicious and i loved it.

If you like experimenting with your food and have a palate for something a bit unusual, try this place. I visit them very often since 2007 or 2008 I guess. Quality and taste of food have been very consistent. Those who know and love their food will agree with me on the fact that there are not many restaurants who manage to keep the food quality and taste consistent. It's difficult but this place has done well here with the selective menu of theirs. Tad bit expensive but its a good experience, even the crowd is very selective.

The food here is amazing but the service is horrific. We walked in around 2.30 and the place was abuzz. We ordered mushroom with feta for appetizer straight away as we were really hungry and within 10 minutes, ordered the mains as well. Had to remind the waiting staff twice about our appetizer which was served after 35 minutes of placing the order. Had ordered cream cheese and olive ravioli in a sun dried tomato sauce for mains which was yum but the pizza ordered with it never arrived. Having finished the ravioli, we still waited and then enquired about the pizza to which we were told that it will take further 5 minutes. Mind you its been over an hour since we placed our order and had run out of patience and asked him to cancel the pizza. They were not able to put up a simple 2 course meal on our table in over an hour and 10 minutes, that really does say something about their inefficiency. The food should not disappoint anyone here but the service definitely will.

A restaurant in a shopping centre that has a food bazaar but is positioned as a fine dining place....bit of a paradox. Have visited a few times but never been  impressed with the prices for the fare...probably why it's never busy there. The experience is simply not worth it...the only upside being the short walk from our place in Kolkata.

Mangio which is located inside a kookie jar outlet in Alipore is bit of an high end restaurant ! 
I was a pretty regular customer way back in 2010-11, their menu was quite interesting ! It's located in Alipore and the irony is its just located besides Gold's Gym! Which isn't fair because after a pretty heavy work out gorging on their ice creams haven't done much good to me atleast ! 
It's basically an extension of kookie jar with fine dining experience. 
Their chicken stroganoff ( I do not know whether it's still a part of the menu ) was superb! So was the fish and chips! @
But I remember I mostly ordered my favourite freshly squeezed watermelon juice and a couple of "made from the scratch" kookie jar ice creams - which by the way are to die for and any day better than the canned Baskin Robbins ones, well atleast according to me. 
The dining area is a little cramped because they have a huge adjoining kookie jar shop! You can also have the usual kookie jar favourites like corn puff, chicken envelope, chicken and mushroom patties, chicken egg sandwich etc at an elevated price ( taxes!!! ) inside this place! 

It has been a while since I was there and I see they have a little different menu right now so might visit soon :)

So, the food here is pretty good . Its refreshing nice continental food. 
We had fish and chips which was really nice and crispy.
We had ravioli which was nice but a tad bit salty. 
Then we had an amazing that green curry which was really nice and just how it should be .
And we had a chicken steak which was again a little salty but it was nice and soft and not bad in terms of taste.
And the dessert was really nice , we had a sundae, it was really good.
Overall an amazing experience.

Simply put - A great Experience.

One of the best places to have Tenderloin Steak, Steak Sandwich and huge choice of Continental food. Ambiance is smooth and cool. Staffs are very courteous and paid attention to finer details. My friends daughter was feeling cold, before we could tell the staff, the turned down the Air-Conditioner.

Food is too good. Steak-perfectly cooked and perfect pink inside. Ofcourse the Nutty Triangle does not require special attention, they are the best nutty triangles you will ever have.

Pinch on the pocket - A bit on the higher side. A perfect place for a family celebration

Overall - Loved it :-)

If you're at mangio do try the spiced watermelon salad. It is the perfect combination of fruits and vegetables. The baked bekti in paper is incredibly good too. But you have got to try the desserts before you leave. We drooled over the blueberry mille-feuille and the caramelised rosemary apple tart.

I had the ham and cheese sandwich followed by the molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. And I'm not sure which of the two deserves more praise than the other. To say the least, both are HEAVENLY. The ham used in the sandwich is one of the finest quality. And the time for the dessert to arrive was totally worth it given the aroma of the cake and the sandwich settling down gradually. To top it, a classy ambience as well!

It is located inside the "kookie jar" outlet of alipore. "Mangio" has added a classic and distinctive quotient to the value of kookie jar all together. When "kookie jar" comes to our mind we think about dropping by to pick some of our favorite pastries, tarts, foccasias, cakes, cookies etc. But with the addition of "Mangio" now it is much more than visiting kookie jar for our sweet tooth cravings. "Mangio" is a complete presentation of culinary glamour. Their offerings revolves from mediterrenean, european, asian, italian etc; like salads(caesar salads, mushroom salads, chef's special salad[definitely worth trying], pastas, sphaghetti, lasagna, sandwiches, lamb shanks and what not. It is a complete package to hypnotize your pallete with their tantalizing cuisines. With the presence of "Mangio" it has become a perfect place to execute your sunday brunch in a cozy and classic ambience. Till date i have never been dissapointed and hopefully you won't be either.

Hidden behind the walls of Kookie Jar is a fine place to hog over mouth watering servings. My all time favourite here is the Omlettes. Haven't been in a long time so don't know if the menu is still decently priced or overpriced. In any case it is a place to be for a foodie.

Am a vegetarian who loves this place as much as my non-veg friends do. Their tortellini with plum tomatoes and their mushroom capuccino are my favourites! Apart from that the watermelon salad has a unique taste to it because of their amazing dressing. The freshness and temperature of every element in the salad makes it so. Additionally, have tried their pesto pasta and the sri lankan lentil soup which are alright. Ambience is great but a smallish place with only about 15 tables so do ensure they have tables when you want to go. The attached Kookie Jar is well-known for its baked goodies, so that's always a plus when we visit this place!

With Cookie Jar being my regular dose of serotonin booster from school days , I was excited to find out their savouries Mangio .i most definitely liked the interior which is quite spacious with two sections- the outer one where you can enjoy that coffee with some cookies or muffins of your choice and the inner dining space which is nicely done up with shades of red and brown . We ordered Chicken garlic pepper salad , Grilled prawn and Tenderloin steak …. I just have to say none of the dishes made me go wow –unlike their confectionery items which I swear by the savouries failed to impress me. The salad was kind of dry with no proper dressing too infact what they served appeared to me more like skewers instead of a salad! service was not atall impressive.overall I would say this is an ok place where u must not go with the standards of cookie jar confectionery in mind and about the pocket pinch well its just not worth it

Mangio is a place I visit often as its very close to my office. I have been a regular patron both of the Kookie Jar shop outside as well as the dining at Mangio. Like every regular I have my favorites but on and off I like to try other stuff as well. Both the Smoked Tomato Soup and the Sri Lankan Curried Lentil Soup are good bets to start your meal with. Caesar Salad is quite nice and a soup and salad is great for a working lunch. The Tenderloin Steak Sandwich is my pick if I am in a bready sort of mood and I have so far enjoyed it although of late I feel that they need to be a bit more generous with the tenderloin stuffing inside. For the mains I recommend the Fish and Chips , Grilled Prawns , Lamb Shanks and the Tenderloin Steak. For a sweet ending try the homemade ice-creams , Creme Brulee or the Cheese Cake and ofcourse you can order any of the desserts from Kookie Jar outside. However I have given them a lower rating than in my previous reviews because with the advent of Smoke House Deli , Chili's etc the service is below par , the decor is dated and the pocket pinch is marginally higher. Time to buck up Mangio !!!!

Mangio has delicious food and I quite like the ambience as well. Service is good as is the quality of the produce .... all these factors plus the fact that location wise its bang next to my office have made me visit this place fairly regularly.  My usual meal if I am there on a working day comprises of the Sri Lankan Curried Lentil Soup .... similar in flavours to the Mulligatawny Soup which is a personal favourite, I am yet to come across another place that serves this in the city. I follow it up with either the Caesar Salad which is very nice or the Tenderloin Steak Sandwich which is delicious. The Cream Cheese and Olive Ravioli as well as the Stir Fried Udon Noodles in Ponzu Sauce with Prawn Tempura  are two other delicious dishes that I recommend. Being part of the Kookie Jar chain the desserts are very good , do give their home-made ice-creams a try if you have a sweet tooth. They open at 8am for breakfast as well and the pancakes and omelettes are excellent when combined with the selection of fresh juices on offer.

Mangio is run by the same management as Kookie Jar . A great place for breakfast / lunch or dinner that is a little different. They have a sort of a world cusine which I like because you will find a dish for every mood .... good service in a pleasing decor with consistent quality is the hall mark of this place. Love their Iced Tea and their fish and chips .... also some of the thai and oriental dishes are yummy !!! When your tastebuds feel like a bite of something different do drop by !

Though I can write a full blog writing bout this shambolic restaurant but I rather would not. Instead I'll  just like to give a simple advice to the management that no matter how good stuff you are making, you should know that people go to restaurants to have food when they are hungry and not to taste your food, which comes after like waiting and waiting and some more waiting . So  Bro...puck up. ( or give me my money back next time)

Quick review for Mangio @ Alipore.

We had recently been to Mangio for a late lunch this week. The restaurant is clubbed with the Kookie Jar chain. We are very much aware about the Kookie Jar which is quite famous for its lip smacking pastries and delicious cakes. It was based on this experience that we decided to pick Mangio (Kookie Jar's Dine In restaurant) for our late lunch escapade this week.

The restaurant has a good decor and has an inviting feel to it - so far so good we said to ourselves as we settled down and looked forward to the food and the service.

It took roughly 10-15 minutes for someone at the restaurant to attend to us, even though the place was fairly vacant. We were there at around 3:30 PM which is fairly out of time for an Indian lunch time zone. Anyway, we didn't bother much as we were just trying to settle ourselves in the cozy chairs, decor of the restaurant and glance our way through the elaborate menu and sharing a quiet conversation. So finally after waiting much time, we get one of the attendants to take our order - I must mention that the person who came to take the order appeared very stressed and sad to be in a restaurant especially in a role where you are expected to be energetic, greet and meet the customers and guide them over the food choices the restaurant has to offer from its menu to make the experience really memorable.

Nonetheless, we were hungry so we placed our order which was Roast Chicken and Onion soup, Chicken Garlic Pepper as starters, Chicken Stroganoff, Fish and Chips and Garlic Breads for what we may say as the main course dishes.

We waited patiently for our food at the table and we waited and waited but there was nothing on the table - so we thought of checking with one of the service attendants whether we were going to get our food today or not. And finally after a long wait of 20 minutes, we got the soup - it tasted good, but yes, after waiting for so long anything would have tasted divine to us at that moment to be honest. So then again the wait continued and we had to always check with them to speed up the food service on our table - do note that besides us there was only 1 more table which was being attended to, so the restaurant was not that full to start off with in the first place. Also, there were quite a few attendants but most seemed very busy standing idle and watching the TV rather than taking the time to attend to the customers ensuring that nothing is missed. A shame indeed. 

Overall, I would say that the food was good, presentation was also fairly well done - BUT unfortunately, the restaurant service needs to gear up on speed along with a therapy for the staff on customer service so that it adds to the overall experience and makes it worthwhile. Perhaps, they could introduce an incentive scheme for their attendants which may encourage them to be more polite with their services and improve the customer service to a great extent. A good place but the service is seriously disappointing and can be stepped up to a great extent. I would think twice before I visit the place again for sure.

I have to admit - If I want a good steak, one of the first places that comes to my mind is this. We recently decided on a quick meet up at Alipore, and ended up at Mangio in the afternoon. I was interested in the steak, while my friend was all for chicken. Our eyes also fell on the house made pasta with mushrooms, and we ended up ordering the chicken steak, tenderloin and the pasta. Our pasta actually came in first, and it was a lovely jumble of fresh pasta, perfectly seared mushrooms and generous bits of sun dried tomatoes. We quickly got our steaks, and I had ordered mine medium, and it was medium. For desserts, we wanted molten chocolate cake, and they warned me that it would be late - around 20 minutes. We were fine with that, and it came in after a while, and was INCREDIBLE. 

Why am I cutting off marks then? The service, while nice, was Incredibly slow, and that is what we hated the most. Inattentive was the word and we had to catch their attention with difficulty.

Really good food, disappointing service

I must say Mangio was a disappointment. At first someone came to take our order who had no clue about the menu. Then he sent someone else who was helpful somewhat. We ordered the Roast Chicken & Onion Soup and the Thyme Roast Chicken.  We were the only people there and the food was served quick, unlike the experience shared in some of the reviews here.

Much of the eatery is taken up by the showcases containing sweet offerings - as it is after all a Kookie Jar venture - leaving a rather sparse seating area. There are like four-five tables and the ambiance is hardly meant for fine dining. You will be interrupted by the odd chatter from the waiting staff even if you are seating in a corner. Don't be surprised to see a torrential downpour from a leaky AC vent in the ceiling, for which they have placed a blue bucket on the floor. If such an eyesore wasn't enough, the relentless pitter patter of the water irritated me to no end.

The soup was a delight. The thyme roast chicken was really good (so good that you can actually ignore the sucky ambiance and the inattentive waiting). The portion was good enough and I shared it with my friend. But we had to fight our way through in the very small plates they served. Another mistake! What the heck, they even forgot to change plates in between and provide spoons till we reminded them.

We decided we have had the best of Mangio, asked for the check and stepped out.

Exelent . But you have to deliver your food quickly . If you wouldnt have made this mistake you would have got 5.0 . Another suggestion , you should have atleast one bengali meal or rice or something see because even KFC has launched a meal called rice bowlz . Though you are italian you should do that . Hygiene is perfect . I have nothing else to say . :)

Mangio - My must visit place if I am in alipore area and also if i have a lot of time in hand. 
I have been to mangio more than a couple of times and never been let down by the food here.
From the feta filled mushrooms (Which By the way are absolutely delicious) to the mouth watering sticky rice with malaysian curry, everything just tastes great.
Must try are the feta filled mushrooms , the sticky rice with malaysian curry and the pasta. The desserts are exceptional considering it is also an extension of kookie jar. Was pleasantly surprised with the strawberry mille fuille. Loved every bit of it. 
Now the let down, and this is a let down every single time is the SERVICE. The waiters are so laid back and slow it takes forever to get the food. last time it took over 40 minutes to even get the starters ready.
So go try MANGIO but only if  you have enough time in hand.

Mangio is a quiet little restaurant tucked away in Alipore. Managed by the Kookie Jar chain, it serves Continental food, and a few Middle Eastern dishes.

The food is certainly very good. Ordered the Watermelon Juice and the Carrot and Apple Juice to start off, followed by the Chicken Stroganoff and the Fish 'n' Chips. All four items were rather good.

The decor is very good. One can sit in tables in alcoves that ensure that conversations take place without interruption. The service is good, but waiters occasionally miss requests from tables in corners.

The primary problem with the place is the pricing, which is too high. Though the food served is good, it does not warrant the prices charged. Moreover, to go all the way to Alipore for this sort of food makes no sense - there are plenty of more accessible restaurants that serve the same kind of food at lower prices, keeping the quality intact. Therefore, unless prices come down, this restaurant is not worth visiting unless you live nearby.

Sleek decor, pleasing ambiance. Good food. But high on pocket pinch. This is summing up Mangio for you. It is run under the same umbrella as Kookie Jar. As such, they always have a huge dessert selection. I love their hot chocolate. Breakfast platter is good. It is a good choice for an early morning rendezvous or a quick lunch when you would not mind to spend a little extra.

One restaurant which never disappoints. Its a restaurant closeby which we visit twice to 3 times in a month. The staff are very warm and recognize us maybe because we are regulars. Ambience is good. Service is not bad.

Must try dishes:-
Corn and Cheese Foccasia Sandwich
Oodon Noodles
Roshtis
Risotto
Mud pie
and blue berry cheese cake shots ( I guess its been discontinued now)

Good going guys!!

Understated elegance and class thats whats Mangio aims for , and succeeds . Pricey but once ur done with the whole experience of eating here it doesnt pinch the pocket that much . The quality of food here is quite good , but the one item that i must talk about is the cheese cake in a fruit soup , i can walk a 100 km it sample it over and over again. the ambience is beautiful and service pleasant . If you are in mood to eat good food and splurge mangio is the place to be...

Slick, smooth and effortlessly classy venue.No wonder,it's a favoured haunt of high rollers and if you fancy a spot of informal glamour, there is very much a sense of those comfortable with their money here!!!!

No expense is spared in making the foodies feel comfortable.

The diverse all-day menu continues to deliver cracking sandwiches, top-drawer pizza and 'adorable' mains-lasagne,Spaghetti and risotto.. To finish, the cheesecake is 'out of this world'!!

Tried out the following sandwiches:-
Corn and cheese,khoubz wrap and roast chicken(The SANDWICHES are to die for!!)....
For the Main Course,had tenderloin steak(with wasabi baked potatoes) and finally,the cheese cake with fresh fruit soup.

Staff is friendly and efficient, swift and attentive. The ability to mix and match from sandwiches,salads to mains allows for a diverse variety of combinations and one is rarely disappointed.

Despite the restaurant being busy, we were allowed more than ample to sit and talk at our table once the plates had been cleared away, a very welcome approach!!
An unbeatable location and a really quite pleasant seating arrangement- inside and outside,plus a take-away counter,spacious and comfortable, these are further advantages... 

Unequalled and unique food presentation!! 

A MUST for those who love Italian and Continental food!

Food
Brilliant. Thoroughly enjoy all their preparations. There is a sort of a magic touch, a wow factor which is unique to Mangio. Something even as basic as a lasagne is prepared so meticulously and presented so gracefully, you know it will satisfy you the moment it reaches your table. 
I generally like to order Asparagus Soup, Caesar Salad, Homemade Fettuccine, Lasagne and Pizza. 

Service
Average when the place is full. It takes a few minutes before you can locate a steward and you can't help but feel they are under staffed. They are very courteous though. 

Ambience
Good. The crowd generally is young and vibrant. A nice atmosphere to have a good meal. The tables could do with a bit more space. It gets quite cramped if you order more than 2 dishes. 

Value
Meal for 2 would cost btw Rs 2000 - Rs 2500. It's expensive but you can be assured you won't find a similar style of preparation elsewhere in the city. Love going back every time.

Possibly one of the best fine dining options in the city where there is no dearth of Continental restaurants but there is very little class and quality. The menu is limited but well thought out and planned. I was recently very disappointed with the service, we had to ask for water twice, we were given menu cards and cutlery with food smeared on it (the ipad menu cards are no longer available). The food is generous, well balanced and tastes exceptionally good. The desserts are true to the Kookie Jar standards and legacy. However, alcohol is not served here. All in all a good dining option, though I'd hope that the quality of service gets back to the previous standards and matches up with the quality of the food.
