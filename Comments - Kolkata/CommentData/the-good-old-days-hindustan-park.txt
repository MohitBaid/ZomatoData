The food quality was not at all upto the mark. We ordered dry chili chicken and they landed up serving it semi gravy and salty. The sandwich that they served contained worms which usually grows when the bread rottens. The atmosphere was equally bad. They were playing some 4-5 songs, that too in a loop from a mobile phone. Time taken to serve a sandwich was huge. We ordered at 7.45 pm and it was served at 9.20 pm. Not at all recommended for family goers.

I visited here few days back. The place is really small. You can hardly breath when your hookah is on fire. Food took looooooong to cook but it was delicious. Those staffs were friendly, I really loved their behavior.. I can't find reasons to rate it more.

The service is the worst and the owners and managers are in their own world so much of attitude as they are getting customers.


All they say is you can review us bindaas we don't care nobody can touch us and all.

From my point of view not me only nobody should visit this restaurant as they are getting customers they are getting more of attitude.

If you want to see the worst service in any restaurant then this place is a must visit. Its like a membership club they run where only specific kids who are regular for sheesha at their place are attended. People sitting on different tables call out to each other very loudly, abuse. The waiters are very mannerless. Horrible crowd. Horrible staff.

One guy came to take our order after 45 mins, yes 45 mins. He was only responsible to take sheesha order and said that the food person will come in a while. It took a server 15 more minutes to just come and take our order. It is very normal for servers to talk loudly with each other at this place. 

Noodles we ordered was pathetic, just like their service and behavior. I felt like vomiting after having it. Ordered crispy fried babycorn, which was not even 1 percent crispy. The one thing which was good was the mocktails.

Songs selection was pathetic as well as the sound quality. Loud distorted sound quality. What a torture! Only breakup songs sung by wannabe artists...Even after repeated complains they did nothing about it.  And bad service in a restaurant where all tables are occupied is still acceptable but this restaurant had only three running tables including ours. If you decide to pull sheesha in their AC section in ground floor there is a good chance of dying out of suffocation. Kitchen smoke everywhere. Our eyes were red due to that smoke. The utensils were dirty too which had oil stains. Worst experience!

Food - Pathetic
Sheesha - Pathetic
Ambience - Below Average
Service - NEGATIVE
Rearrival quotient- NEVER
You'll never get the food of your choice. Whatever I'm trying to order I'm disappointed with the answer "sir it's unavailable". Toh bhai menu card se hata doo sab -_-
One star for the mocktails. Byass enough!
I, being a super foodie, requesting you all not to visit this place at any cost. Horrible confused staffs, horrible food, horrible ambience, horrible quantity of food they offer which is not even enough for a child. *Do not visit this place* don't get fooled by the pics on zomato posted by the management. The scene is completely different. Thanks!

Being a fan of coffee I love their coffee. The quantity as well as the quality is very good. The Irish Coffee is also very good here. I love the couch where you can sit and chill and their sandwich didn't disappoint me. Overall a good place to visit with your friends. I wish the place was bigger and the place didn't smell of hookah.

This place has to be one of the best in terms of managing their lack of space with delicious food and prompt service. Although a bit hard to locate, once you enter this café you won't be disappointed. Comfortable couches add to the coziness of the place and food is reasonably priced. Chicken Parmigiana had a good crunch to it with generous portions of moist chicken and both the Cappuccino and Cold coffee were enjoyable. However, the Margarita pizza failed to impress. It was topped with flavoursome gooey cheese but the crust was thick and doughy. Looking forward to trying more dishes next time around.

Visited this place many a times along with my friends and it has become one of favourite hangout places. This place is located in the lane of Hindustan Park and is never overcrowded. The ambience is good enough to spend quality time with your loved ones. This place accepts only cash which is a big turn off but on the other hand the tax part is waived off.

Caramel Macchiato is a must try along with Oreo Shake.
Watermelon Mojito can make you feel refreshing.
Chicken AOP is the signature dish and is a must try. Pizzas are not so good than expected. Garlic Bread tastes damn good. Lastly hookah has been introduced over here and the prices are very less. 

They have different kinds of combos available with the hookah. Please ask for the combos available while ordering.

Ordered A Margarita pizza, one strawberry shake and one choco vanilla strawberry shake. 

The shakes were very good. When I say good it's really good. Definitely worth 150/- 

However, the pizza was a bit disappointing not in taste but for it's size. I'd say go for pasta or sandwiches.

I went here with seven amazing, crazy and adorable friends around Holi this year. 
The space is cramped up a tad too much for claustrophobic people like me. They have two floors.
We went upstairs and sat in the wide-spread sofa-cum-bed. Though we were severely cramped up for space, the experience was soothing. The ambiance is nice. The staff is courteous. The only thing that bothered us was a blaring TV set.
We ordered Grilled Chicken Mexican Sandwich, a Fire of Bengal Pizza, Alfredo in white sauce and Cold Coffee.
The coffee was great. Loved it
The sandwich was amazing. Though it's overpriced, the quality is impressive.
The pizza was ordinary and overpriced.
The pasta was amazing, but the quantity served was shabby. That was perhaps the most disappointing aspect. They need to serve a hell lot more for that price. No excuses there.
Overall, the bill was a little bothersome, compared to the quantity. But we plan to go back there again.

As I entered this cozy little cafe shop the aroma of some lemony essence boosted my tired soul immediately. I was totally in love with the snugly feel of the outlet. A great place to hang around with friends over some lip smacking food, mock tails and beverages along with shisha. Great hospitality is something I can vouch for about TGOD. Visiting again soon.

This cafe is located in Hindustan Park and occupies a small and cozy place. It has seating area in the ground as well as upstairs, not too spacious. The place is a little shady and has dim lights making it look pretty. 
I was on a cafe hopping mood and so I went with a friend to experiment here. I've earlier heard that their Chicken Mozarella is good. So we just ordered it. They took a really long time to serve the food. The dish was ordinary in presentation. The quantity was very less. There were 6 small chicken pieces served with mayonnaise dip. The taste was good though but not filling. The chicken was well fried and the mayo was completing the dish.
I didn't try the other dishes but I would suggest them to include some other items too and the service need improvement. The price is reasonable. The ambience is fine.

With a platoon of less than ten tables in the entire duplex, this place seem to actually end even before it starts. But it is unlikely for one to feel claustrophobic within the confined joint, instead might just find it just too cozy. We had tried:
1. Chicken AOP (chicken chunks fried in caramel, with dip) - 4⭐️
2. Chicken Pasta in white sauce - 2.5⭐️
3. Oreo shake - 3.5⭐️
4. Kit Kat shake - 3.5⭐️

The rustic setup and partial privacy really makes you feel relaxed in the dimly lit setup.

An overall 4⭐️ including the ambiance. Definitely gonna be one of our "regular" hang out places in the near future. 

P.S. There is a sofa-cum-bed on the 1st floor, try to get comfortable there before anywhere else.

Why would you open a cafe in the middle of Hindustan Park, where there are already so many other options, and still not be serious about running it?

This is a smallish two storeyed place which seats not more than 20-25 people. They have a voluminous menu card (actually just a bunch of printed papers), with a number of catchy sounding items like Bun Maska, Baked Eggs in Bread Bowl, London Fog Iced Latte et al. In reality, only about 20 percent of these items are available on a Friday evening.

Asked for Pinacolada, not available. Asked for Keema Bun, not available. I was ready to leave right away, because I have singular irritation with restaurants which will produce for you a thick menu, and then will shake their heads at whatever you ask of them.

Ordered iced teas, Chicken Parmiagna and Chicken Wai Wai. Iced Tea was completely synthetic. Parmiagna was good, and so was the noodles. My husband asked for a glass of water, and the waiter said only bottled water was available. As far as I know, this is absolutely illegal. If you have a restaurant, you are required to provide free drinking water to your customers. It was just that I was not in a mood to create trouble, else I would not have let this skip by.

More trouble while trying to pay. Their card machine was not even charged, they connected it to the charger AFTER we​ said we chose to pay by card. We got tired of waiting, so we chose to pay through e-Wallet. 

It was not the sort of experience I was hoping for at all, especially since designer cafes and tea rooms have become a dime a dozen in the city now, and everybody has plenty of options. I hope it is just because it is a new place and still needs to settle down, but for its own sake, this joint needs to really buck up.

There has been a change in their ownership. I don't usually go out of my way to criticize something, but this is by and far the worst place I've ever eaten. You'd be surprised how small the pieces of the chicken lollipop were, and the pieces barely had any meat. I wish I'd taken pictures. 

There are a lot of other things wrong with the place but everything can be overlooked if the food is good. Quite sadly that isn't the case. I'll be pragmatic enough to save myself the trouble and the money.

The cafe looks much bigger in the photographs than it actually is. It seats about 12 persons on the ground floor and another 4 to 6 in the mezzanine but the tables are placed close to each other due to lack of space, yet the place cannot be called cosy. The issue of lack of space could have been made up through exemplary food but there also, the food is not impressive. The menu is printed on white sheets and clipped on a clipboard, the kind we used in exams as children. Through continuous usage, the pages were tattered and shabby and looked unappealing. We ordered a shake and an iced tea along with french fries, which were acceptable. We then made the mistake of ordering a fondue which was not at all palatable and I felt rather guilty about wasting it. The breadsticks that accompanied the fondue were soggy and bland. I dropped in cause I was impressed by the photos on zomato but after having visited the place, I'll put it in the league of cafes which are suitable for students and a place you drop on if you happen to pass it by but not a place you plan and visit.

The place is really small but cozy. It looks like a secret tunnel which would lead you to the outskirts of the city in case of a surprise attack or something. But as I said, It was comfortable enough.

Coffee is good, so is the tea. Chicken AOP is a good selection if you want something saucy and hot with a taste of lemon. 

Staff are well behaved. They do take a bit excess time to serve the food.

Only con was that they didn't have a proper menu card. It was a just the photocopy of it on a clipboard. That was really a turn-off as that's the first thing you put your hands on after you're seated.

I wasn't aware of this place till my bunch of friends and I were looking for a place to have a nice adda session and found this one out through Zomato. The place is really small, even though it's spread across 2 floors. However, it's possibly one of the best places for chatting over beverages and pizzas and sandwiches, if there aren't too many people to stare at you everytime you laugh out too loud. The menu is limited, and they don't even have a proper menu card. However, what is served, is good enough. The quantity though is a little less for the price and quality, in my opinion. They also offer Shisha, and the good part is that the air isn't suffocating with the smell in spite of that. We had ordered a Grilled Chicken Mexican Sandwich, a Fire of Bengal Pizza, Alfredo in white sauce and Cold Coffee. The sandwich was quite good, and I liked the filling inside. The pizza was thin crust and done crisp, even though the taste wasn't anything over the top. The pasta was pretty good, even though the portion was small. Overall, I loved the place because of the amazing company I happened to have, and it did remind us of 'The Good Old Days!'

I visited this place around Puja twice. For the first time we got the cozy first floor. It gives you a very nostalgic feeling. The ambience is really good and so are the staffs. At the second visit we were on the ground floor. I loved the chicken mozeralla specially l. The hookah was also good.

Went there few days back. The cafe was very easy to find, near the 'Zucca Lounge'. The place was cosy, and the ambience was bit dark, the decor was good, as well as their hospitality. The seats are arranged in ground and first floor and you will find a beautiful couch in the first floor. A perfect place to spend some leisure time.

Coming to food, ordered:

Starters : Chicken Mozzarella -  Served with dip, deep fried. (must try)
Sandwiches : Egg Fried Grilled Cheese Sandwich - (Server's Recommendation, and it was excellent) 
Pizza : Margarita - (The crust was too crunchy and not that good)
The Regular : Cappuccino (As always good)
Mocktails : Blue Lagoon

Prices were not that high, anyone going low cash can hit this mark. Overall the experience was really above the expectation, and surely its a recommended one.

Time to tick off one from the bookmarks. Went there few days back. Really liked the place, a small cafe but they surely know how to utilize small spaces. Location wise very easy to find, opposite triangular park city style. The sitting arrangement is very comfortable with dim lights. Coming to food, its absolutely perfect. And the pocket pinch is low comparing to quality quantity of food. :)

I wasn't aware of this place till my bunch of friends and I were looking for a place to have a nice adda session and found this one out through Zomato. The place is really small, even though it's spread across 2 floors. However, it's possibly one of the best places for chatting over beverages and pizzas and sandwiches, if there aren't too many people to stare at you everytime you laugh out too loud. The menu is limited, and they don't even have a proper menu card. However, what is served, is good enough. The quantity though is a little less for the price and quality, in my opinion. They also offer Shisha, and the good part is that the air isn't suffocating with the smell in spite of that.

Place is a bit cozy but very private...you can talk loudly bcoz other person sitting on the next table can hear u clearly... I went there with my sister on a Sunday evening and it was all empty.  It was a niCe place but not so good...food was also ok... Average place wid a little pinch in ur pocket .

It is conveniently located, parking is not an issue and the ambiance is comforting.  Tiny, two storied, narrow steep stair notwithstanding, the insides are inviting. I have been there on a number of occasions - you can take your work there and sit for long hours, you can chat for long - especially during the afternoons, when business is anyway slow, there is no hurry. Food is good. Some of them are a little surprising - eg., the brushchetta today, did not have a bread base! The burgers are often small but very very tall. Otherwise the coffee and food are satisfying.
The sheesha has closed down, leaving a faint aroma of hookah smoke on the first floor.
The blaring TV beside every table is an overkill, but you can ask for the volume to be turned down and your TV can be switched off.
Service is unremarkable.

The name of the place, is quite appealing and so, is the menu, which on the first glance, keeps us in mystery as to what is in store for us ! 
It can be easily located, if you are walking. 
The place is small, a few tables on the ground floor and a sitting area on the first floor. Thats a thumbs down!
Coming to food, 
The servers are really receptive with great suggestions, so we tried the "Fire of Bengal" from the Pizza Section, and "Glory of GOD" ( told you, they leave you in mystery) 
The pizza was thin crust, with oodles of cheese on it. It's got great kick of spice, complemented with freshness from the coriander. The chicken on it was moist.  Great pizza, overall!

The Glory of GOD is a beverage. 
If you love chocolate. This is certainly, your thing! 
Brownie on top, with whipped cream, ice cream , chocolate sauce, and blended with great amount of richness and thickness, this itself can make your whole meal. 
Hookah, is also available here. But, didnt try!
But, a great thumbs up for food and service!

This is one of my personal favorite among the new places in town.
Coming from traingular park walk towards gariahat take the 1st right, walking towards zucca. The crossing before zucca.
Amazing Ambience with quite a limited seatings.
Food -
Chicken Mozarella- Excellent. Deep fried and cheesy, served with dip.

Fire of Bengal (pizza) - Thin crust. New and toothsome. Very nice!

Hookah was good too.

The place is reasonable and the service is nice and attentive.
This is one hidden gem you must visit.

It has opened up where The Bistro used to be.The dimly lit lamps and the matte walls gives a good vibe and creates a bar-like ambiance though they do not serve booze here. We dropped in one evening and preferred to sit upstairs. There's a low duvet type thingy where you can sit with your friends.A couple was already sitting there and they stayed for a long time though they didn't order anything but a shake.That probably means that you can sit here and chat for as long as you want.We had ordered a KitKat shake (very good),a pizza margherita(okayish), chicken mozzarella (delicious),cheese puffed pastry baked eggs(yum with mayo) and some drink called chik-fila-lemonade or something(tasted like cold milk with vanilla,don't order this) which was recommended by the waiter.On my previous visit,I had tried their cheese fondue.For the 1st time,I had seen liquid(in this case,the molten cheese) beinh served on a plate instead of a bowl.It was very difficult to have it since fondue is generally served in a bowl with fire underneath it.However,food is good.The worst thing is that they do not provide separate plates to eat.Even if you ask for plates,they'll give you only one.We had to eat using tissue papers.

I Have gone to this place with my friends  and I must tell you  to do the same. 
Ambience  is good but it can get a little loud at times. 
I have tried out hookah and a couple of shakes  here all of which had turned out to be satisfactory. 
The wooden, dark ambience  of the place is the only thing I like the most and also the comfortable  corner in the second floor. 
The place is a little hard to find and one might need to use the Google map for it. 
Nevertheless  it's worth a visit.

This is a pretty tiny but well decorated cafe and hookah lounge located right beside King and Queen in Hindustan Park. It has two floors with a total seating of about 15 to 20 people. 
This place serves good quality and tasty food and beverages for a price that is quite reasonable also they have an additional benefit with a phone charger attached in each table.

We Tried : Chicken Mozzarella, Fire of Bengal Pizza, Cold Coffee and Watermelon Mojito.

All the dishes were really good but the chicken mozzarella has to be my favorite.Four big crispy, crumb fried chicken with lots of cheese on top.
The pizza was also very nice.The crust was perfect and the pizza was well made.
The cold coffee was one of their extremely well made coffee which we personally liked.
Watermelon mojito was really refreshing and tasty.

This place has everything going its way - from the good food, to the good price (all prices are inclusive of tax) to the good service.
All together its a good place.........

I came here at the time of 4:30. Were opted for the 1st floor seating arrangement. 

Ordered one Watermelon Mojito and Blue Lagoon. Both were good and refreshing.

Then we took egg in the hole which was a poached egg bordered by bell peppers. Presentation of that dish was good.

Later we tried Mozzarella Chicken. That was very nice and I liked a lot.

Service was very good. Staffs were humble. Ambiance was fine...

Dimly but beautifully lit, small but comfortable,2 tier cafe with a surprise of delicious food. A place for a group of 2/3 people.Not ideal for a group hangout.This was my first visit and I tried out rissotto al fungi which was good. I loved the quesadilla and I would highly recommend this Mexican dish. It has got a kick for your taste buds.The hot chocolate was served lukewarm but inspite of that it tasted awesome.Every table has a plug point for charging your phone/other devices and a LED.

This is a small cafe located near Vivekananda park. You can get hookah too. There are two floors both quite crammed up...but it is good for small groups. The upper floor is more dimly lit. The hookah was good and cheap too!It was recommended by them. Coming to the food, both the pizza and chicken sandwich were amazing. The staff were well behaved. Looking forward to try the other delicacies :D

Located near vivekanda park,I visited this small little joint during the pujas.It is a pretty small place and could not really understand the logic behing the name Good Old days,as the only thing retro there was a clock.We ordered coffee and garlic toast,and to be fair both were pretty good.They serve hooka's as well.So if you are in the region,you can drop by but nothing special.

The first thing you are likely to notice the moment you enter the place is the area of it. What I mean is claustrophobia can set in. It's that small. But yet you avoid that and you take a sofa and go thru the 'not so fancy' computer print out menu card. On your first visit you can be a little confused considering that the menu is quite elaborate. Trust me when I say, this place will grow on you. The staff is very caring without being indulgent. Soon enough the size of the place won't be a problem. Special mention to Mr. Numan who is really courteous and caring. The mocktails are a must try. Go for it.

Located near Hindustan Park. Hookah is available at a very reasonable price. A small group of friends is more preferable for Hookah. The food dishes are average. The staff are very good & well behaved. But the main problem is it is very small in size & they don't have customized menu cards yet. And, the ambience is very nice & the place is well decorated.

Again thanks to Zomato's Search nearby restro feature. After hopping a few pandals in south, we wanted to give some rest to our legs and looked for a cafe. Then this one came up and we selected. Perfect ambiance for spending some quality time with friends or special ones. They play selective music in the background. This small place is decorated with a feeling of kolkata's retro environment. Yellow neon street lights, bricky walls are the special addons. 

We ordered caffe latte, darjeeling tea and chicken mexican pizza. I usually don't like pizza but their pizza entirely got me. I loved the crunchy crust and the spicy toppings. It also has an upstairs.
The staffs over there were funny and friendly. Overall, a cool cafe. I will definitely visit again.

Visited this place today, late in the afternoon.
Located near Gariahat, this was such a great find by me. 
The prices are ridiculously low, and this can be the perfect getaway for anyone who is running low on cash.

The interior is done up in a very sassy way. Really impressed. Exudes the vibes of a first class, fine café. And judging by the quality of food, it definitely is one too.

As we had had our lunch, we weren't keen on ordering much. We just wanted to chill over a glass of cold coffee. Still we ended up ordering titbits. 
• Cold coffee - this was made to perfection. Really frothy and amazing to taste.
• Lemon iced tea - another perfectly made drink. The right amount of lemony zest made this drink perfect.
• Egg cheese grilled sandwich - this was moderate to taste, but what made me really happy were the potato wedges served with it. Overall pretty good. 

We also wanted to order devil eggs but sadly that wasn't unavailable.

Now coming to the best part of the afternoon. The pricing. Only 275 bucks. And VAT free, so Yaaaay!

The service is very prompt, and this café is definitely worth many visits.
I'm definitely visiting it again to try out their chicken items.

If you know where azad hind is in gariahat, you'll be able to locate this place easily. The cafe has 2 floors. And we sat downstairs. They didn't have a proper menu just printouts on a clipboard. The menu was nothing extraordinary. The staff suggested chicken AOP starter saying that it's a signature dish so we ordered that along with penne arrabbiata and chocolate milkshake. The hookah we ordered was teen pan rose. Hookah was nicely made. The service was a little slow, but because the cafe was nearly full that was understandable. The food tasted really good and the milkshake tasted yummy. But the quantity was very disappointing. 
The decor was good, but there was no good music. Staff was friendly. Overall an okay experience.

I had this place bookmarked for quite a while. Finally visited it on the navami afternoon. The place has two floors. It's a bit crammed up but I would really like to commend the intelligent usage of a small space. The food and service was good. We had ordered Risotto in mixed sauce, which was nice. Spaghetti in mushroom ragu sauce was great. The veg farmhouse pizza was also amazingly done. I loved the beverages. Orange slush, cucumber mojito and caramel frappe, all top-notch. Had such a lovely experience with the food and drinks, that I almost forgot about my claustrophobia. :P

• Lemon iced tea - another perfectly made drink. The right amount of lemony zest made this drink perfect.
• Egg cheese grilled sandwich - this was moderate to taste, but what made me really happy were the potato wedges served with it. Overall pretty good. 

We also wanted to order devil eggs but sadly that wasn't unavailable.

Now coming to the best part of the afternoon. The pricing. Only 275 bucks. And VAT free, so Yaaaay!

The service is very prompt, and this café is definitely worth many visits.
I'm definitely visiting it again to try out their chicken items.

If you know where azad hind is in gariahat, you'll be able to locate this place easily. The cafe has 2 floors. And we sat downstairs. They didn't have a proper menu just printouts on a clipboard. The menu was nothing extraordinary. The staff suggested chicken AOP starter saying that it's a signature dish so we ordered that along with penne arrabbiata and chocolate milkshake. The hookah we ordered was teen pan rose. Hookah was nicely made. The service was a little slow, but because the cafe was nearly full that was understandable. The food tasted really good and the milkshake tasted yummy. But the quantity was very disappointing. 
The decor was good, but there was no good music. Staff was friendly. Overall an okay experience.

I had this place bookmarked for quite a while. Finally visited it on the navami afternoon. The place has two floors. It's a bit crammed up but I would really like to commend the intelligent usage of a small space. The food and service was good. We had ordered Risotto in mixed sauce, which was nice. Spaghetti in mushroom ragu sauce was great. The veg farmhouse pizza was also amazingly done. I loved the beverages. Orange slush, cucumber mojito and caramel frappe, all top-notch. Had such a lovely experience with the food and drinks, that I almost forgot about my claustrophobia. :P

Had been planning for this cafe since a long time nd finally i made it with my better half toDay afternoon. Extremely good nd comfortable with excellent mouth lickering Foods nd shisha too. A staff helped us in choosing a mixed flavoured hookah that was indeed good enough for fooD we had Chicken mozarella we were spellbound with it followed by Wild mushroom pizza and TGOD special Frappe which was no less than the other two in taste. The prices are reasonable too. Total bill came up to be 820 for us. So absoloutely a great food joint for young food lovers , a must Go place it is. TGOD made the afternoon for us .

Dropped by this place today. It's quite cramped, space wise , with only 3 tables on the ground floor and probably the same number on the first floor . But the decor is really nice. 
We tried the caramel cappuccino, the café latte, the chicken mozzarella and the chicken AOP. All the dishes were really good but the chicken mozzarella has to be my favorite.Crispy, crumb fried chicken with   lots of cheese, what's not to love? The total bill came to Rs 550, which was very reasonable. Would recommend it to all :)

Cafe cum Hookah lounge is located at the crossing of Purna Das Road and Jatin Baghchi road (on the right) if you come from Souther Avenue towards gariahat. The little cafe is too stuffy with 2 floors. Decided to get a seat at the upper floor, but due to strong hookah smell, i have to take my seat on the ground floor. This cafe has an additional benefit with a phone charger attached in each table with free wifi.
Coming to food ordered chocolate milk shake which tasted very yummy and Chicken Parmisania - the flavour of the sauce was ok, but chickenbreast strips were soft and tender from inside. Service was instant.

It's a tiny place off Purna Das Road with seating on two levels. The wait-staff aren't very well-versed with the menu themselves and a couple of things we chose off the menu weren't available. We tried something called a Chic-Fil-A-Frosted-Lemonade which tasted a bit like vanilla lassi with lemon and was not to our taste. The Watermelon Mojito however was quite refreshing. The French Fries came in a nice wire basket which was cute and were crunchy enough. A big letdown was the cheese fondue which tasted more like the white sauce of a pasta to me and was served in a flat dish rather than a fondue pot and with slices of toast rather than bite-sized croutons. The place has little to no ventilation and we had to scramble out when other patrons started on their hookahs.

The Good Old Days - the name itself gives you a nostalgic feeling. This catchy name would certainly grab your attention while you would be around this new cafe at Hindustan park.

USP:
-> Delicious Food
-> Value for money pricing
-> Good service

##Location: It is situated at Hindustan Park on Purna Das Road. Beside the King &Queen parlour & UCO Bank ATM just after you cross wise owl.

##Ambiance & Decor: Though they have a small area but the smart interiors and design has came up with a decent amount of sitting capacity which is really appreciable. Very nice..
Ambiance is quite nice and cozy where you would like to hang out with your friends or may be someone special to have some alone time.

##Food: Even if you have or don't have a lavish interior or ambiance but this is where you get no mercy from the customers. Would like to share my views on some of their dishes
Starters:
Chicken AOP is one of their signature dish which is strongly recommended. Hint of lemon had given it a Tangy yet very interesting flavor with added garlic and parsley. #Recommended

Chicken Crostini yet again they impressed me with this as well. Chicken mix served on top of breads. #Recommended

Panko Mushroom is yummy and served with Cheese & Toum Dip. #VeggieFun

Egg- in-Hole another speciality item from their kitchen which is a pure egg lovers delight. Very innovative concept as well.

Among the sandwiches I tried the TGOD special. Stuffing was filling and they serve it grilled along with French fries and dips. #Nice

Mains:
From their mains menu tried the Paprika Pizza , Pasta Alfredo and tortillas.
Pasta was cheesy yummy and also the quantity is decent at the price.
Veg Tortillas - A stuffed wrap stuffed with assorted veggies and served with tomato salsa and sour cream is also a good option for the vegetarian people specially.
Only problem I found is their pizza which was a little down compare to other dishes. My expectation was set to high looking back at the previous items. My suggestion would be adding more cheese and toppings to make it interesting.

Drinks:
Irish Coffee: This is one of their extremely well made coffee which I personally liked even being a non coffee person.

Vanilla Ice tea Latte: Creamy garnishing with Caramel syrup gives an attractive look and so as the taste. #Beautiful

Cucumber Mojito: Very refreshing
Lemon Ice Team: It was average. The strong lemon flavor had over poured the flavor if tea.

Blue Lagoon: Balanced preparation made it apt . #TryOut

Desserts:
Tuti fruti: A classic dessert which was made well and a good option for dessert. May be some seasonal fruit addition would make it more attractive. But this one is quite nice as well.

Hot chocolate Fudge: Sheer joy for specially chocolate lovers. Vanilla ice cream added with hot chocolate fudge served with chocolate syrup is just a divine end to your food journey.
#Yummy

Apart from food they excel in the service as well. All of their servers are very attentive and responsive towards the guests which is a good sign of building a reputation. #MuchAppreciated

##Verdict:
The Good Old days better known as TGOD is one of finest nee cafes in the city which not only looks good but also serves some exciting dishes as well. I would surely recommend people to drop in and try this place out. Thanks :)

TGOD or THE GOOD OLD DAYS is an example of smart architecture and brilliant planning. Located at one of the corners on Hindustan Road this food joint deserves a special mention not only for its food but also how intelligently we can use space to work for us. The name itself is very nostalgic and reminds each one of us about our school or college days for sure. The signage is very catchy and is neat without much glitz. As i entered the restaurant the aroma of hookah invited me in. My friends were waiting on the top floor (Mezzanine floor actually) and i climbed the wooden steps to locate them. And whoa moment it was for me. A tiny little place turned into a snugly seating area!!! My friends were seated on the couch meant for three to four members and there were few more tables and chairs spread for guests to come and sit. I loved the cozy couch where we sat. A perfect place to sit and chill over hookah, beverages and food.

Finally went here after seeing such nice reviews from my foodie friends! Locating might be difficult if you try and search in google maps, but if you directly open map from zomato it will be easy and exact.Its exactly on next lane of triangular park. Hardly 150m away from the main road. 

Ambience is great, all wooden with vintage bulb dim light. I sat on the upper deck and its the best. I was lucky to get the best couch kind of seating. This people can't accomodate large crowd and that is only the drawback. Perfect for couple or max 4 people. 

Coming to food, we ordered chicken nuggets, tall and dark cold coffee,tgod special blessing coffee and brainfreezer with teen paan hookah. Nuggets was okay enough but the coffee was heavenly. @150 this was something. 

Service was awesome! Super fast and staff were very warm and polite. Hookah @299 was perfect. We were there for 2hrs and it dint choke once. 

Best thing about this place is they dont add any service tax or vat. Bill is exact the same what you see in menu card. My bill was 780 only and i was shocked! They don't accept card and that is one drawback. 

Highlight: Cute cafe for a cute little date with your loved one with dim light and pocket friendly food and desert. Don't miss this one!

Located in the interiors of Southern Avenue,this place has a pretty decent and unique interior. The place is not a very spacious one,but do not go by that, cause they fulfil their drawback by their amazing hookah and food and their well presentation of food. Though the quantity could have been more with respect to the price. The staffs are friendly. The music and the ambience is good enough to charge up your mood. The price is not too high neither too low.

What I have tried:

Caramel frappe.( Must try.)
TGOD's blessing.( Amazing)
Apple Ice tea. ( Not so great.)

Chicken bruchesta ( different yet tasty )
Chicken AOP. ( Tender and tasty)
Fire of bengal pizza. ( highly recommended )

All together its a good place. Have visited thrice, would visit again.

Its a pretty tiny but well decorated cafe and hookah lounge. Its of two floors with a total seating of about 15 to 20 people. The ground floor is quite lit up and the above floor is darker. 
They don't have a proper menu card yet but a print out of it. The menu spread was quite good. But after reading the reviews i opted for Chicken AOP which to my disappointed was not good. Its made of chicken pieces which are marinated with herbs and spices served with mayo.  However it is quite a oily dish with a distinct flavour which not be suitable to everyone. Also tried the Pizza (veg paprika), which was also quite average. The hazelnut coffee was good. The presentation of the dishes were great. According to my friends the Hookah was good too. Service is fine. 
Overall verdict : needs to improve on the quality of food, otherwise quite a good cafe.

Been here with my couple of friends in evening to taste some of there snacks and beverages. A newly opened Café cum Hookah bar. Heard a lot about this place and finally visit here after the strong recommendation of Shahbaaz Zaman. . Before I start let me first tell you how to reach this outlet because in first time it may little tricky to find the exact location by you. It was just there where Zomato map was showing. If you are coming from Kalighat Metro side then take the first stop after Triangular Park stop and if you’re coming from other side then vise versa and then just walk for 1-2 min you see the café  on your left at the end of the first lane.
                                                                ...

In love with this new gem in town. 😍 Right beside King and Queen in Hindustan Park. Its rather a compact place but surely a good one. The rough walls with low light bordered around and pipes decorating the place would give the nostalgic touch to anyone who visits.
Wouldn't be a good choice for large groups though. The two of us had a pretty good we-time 😝
They serve really amazing food, I must say.

Chicken Mozzarella- two pieces of chicken deep fried to a crisp being succulent inside, topped with mozzarella cheese, served along with a dip. Found it really amazing.

That along with Lemon iced tea, also well made.

Price is reasonable. The menu is inclusive of taxes. Our bill was just Rs. 255. Great deal, right?
Oh, the staff too were extremely well mannered. Just that the service could be made better. Else spot on. Coming back for more.

New kid in the block, yet when you will enter, you will be hit by a surge of nostalgia. A very interesting décor and theme, and equally interesting is the name. We were just passing by the Hindusthan Park area and came across this place. The idea was just to have an adda session just like the ‘good old’ college days, so just ordered Grilled Chicken Mexican Service, a Meat Lovers’ Pizza and Oreo Frappe. The menu is pretty regular, with ample amount of beverage option. More than the food, I loved the décor and the theme. Old Victorian Clocks, bricked walls and bulbs, a scene from an old movie. I loved this place and kudos to the person who has decorated this place.

The Desapriya Park and adjacent localities were devoid of decent cafes and restaurants just about a year back. But the area has seen an upsurge of some top of the line cafes with not only great food but also amazing ambiences. Such is this newest baby on the block, The Good Old Days.

The place can be tricky to find but the location is exactly as shown in the map on Zomato. For those not having access to that, follow these directions. Move into Rash Behari Avenue from the Kalighat crossing and take a right from the crossing that comes after passing Triangular Park. It’s on the same lane as Zucca Lounge.

The café is divided into two levels – ground floor and 1st floor. Due to certain space constraints, there is no space for large groups. Otherwise, the seating arrangements have been well managed by the owners. The place is dimly lit with vintage low intensity bulbs fitted artistically into designed pipes. The walls have the rugged bricks texture which adds a nostalgic value to the ambience. The theme mixed with some soothing club music allows you to slip into a trance of nostalgia.

The Good Old Days in fact does speak of old days and surely adds a nostalgic factor to your dining experience. It’s a great joint for friends’ reunions where people can just garner old memories.

PS : Thank you Shahbaaz Zaman for suggesting this place.

An tiring Thursday evening led to the cafe-abundant streets of south Kolkata. My friend Tanwyee Ray  suggested a new eatery on the block and we started for Hindustan park. The Cafe can be easily missed if you don't know the exact location viz. Where bistro used to be. 
The atmosphere inside is cool and comfortable which was unexpected. One level above, we find a nice low-seated arrangement where you can stretch your legs to enjoy the experience. In a small space, a healthy seating capacity of approx 20 is arranged. The interior is well designed with chargers on every table; full marks for the ambience.
Tgod has plenty of options to choose from when it comes to food selection. Obviously we were up for some suggestions as we didnt want to experiment. The staff quickly suggested us to try four from the best they had. 
Chik-a-fil-frosted-lemonade : a thick white lemonade based sweet drink will leave you in a jolly mood. This is the best served at this place.
Chameleon: A Blue colored slush drink with a combination of tangy taste and crushed ice. 

Fusili Alfredo pasta: Combination of herbs and white sauce along with oregano sprinkled over the pasta. I found the dish lacked white sauce and was a bit dry.
Chicken mozzarella: Boneless pieces with layers of cheese served with dip. Recommend by my friend.
Overall I liked this place because the place is a cozy one that won't make big hole in your pocket.

Off the chart food? Check. Friendly staff? Check. Vibrant ambiance? Check. Superb playlist? Double check. So what's missing in The Good Old Days? Definitely more recognition.

A hidden gem tucked in the lanes of Hindustan Park. This little café is located right beside King and Queen.

Before I get into business, I need to thank Shahbaaz Zaman for recommending me this place.

Now ladies and gentlemen, let's talk food, shall we? What I liked most about The Good Old Days is their well thought out menu. Most cafés that I walk into have few items that are good and few which are not. TGOD definitely doesn't fall in that category.

*T. G.O.D's Special Blessing: If you like cold coffee, this should be your first order. Cold brew coffee served with generous amount of whipped cream topped with shredded chocolate and chocolate stick wafer. (4/5)

*Chicken Mozzarella: Four big, saucy chicken breasts which when cut is seen to be tender and succulent. This is topped with mozzarella cheese. Complementing this is a bright looking, tangy dip. (3/5)

*Chick-Fil-A-Frosted Lemonade: This was definitely a drink I've never tried before. The menu said that it was a lemonade, but when the drink arrived it was solid white in colour. This drink has both lemonade and scoops of ice cream, which makes an interesting combination and a more interesting tasting session. (4/5)

*Devil Eggs: Two boiled egg whites with yolks that are crusty and packed with flavours. This is served with a colorful looking salad and two different types of dips. (3.5/5)

*Cucumber Mojito: Served in a Mason jar are slices of cucumber and thinly cut lemons. A refreshing summer drink, that definitely quench your thirst after a hot day outside. (4/5)

*Chicken AOP: I believe this is the best dish in TGOD. A strong recommendation. Beautifully plated dish that includes big chunks of boneless chicken with an aglio olio peperocino sauce. Hints of olive oil and the glossy finishing on the meat really tied the whole dish together. With this was garnishing and other elements that not just made the dish beautiful on a visual point of view but also from a tasting point of view. (4.5)

*Tuti Fruiti: Layered drink served in a big glass, the top one being whipped cream, second jam, third blueberry current, fourth chocolate. If the drink has this many layers, you gotta try 'em! (4/5)

*Wild Mushroom Pizza: Pizza served with a saucy base and chunks of mushrooms. Cheese is gooey, so there shouldn't be any complains. (3/5)

*Watermelon Mojito: Another refreshing summer drink. Strong hints of watermelon with wedges of lemon. If fizzy kinda drinks are your thing, this should be it for you!

*Sizzling Drizzling Brownie: Served on a wooden sizzler plate is a brownie with chocolate sauce drizzling over it and flooding the base of the plate. On top of that is served a vanilla ice cream. A popular dessert, no doubt. Combinations worked well. (3/5)

A word about their head chef, Sunny. He is a wonder. Starting from the flavour of his dishes to plating it up. Stress on the plating up part. Each of his dishes look exquisite. Furthermore, to see how well the owner has managed to make a crammed space look so hip. That is something. Definitely coming back again.

A cosy place for close friends.Tv, wifi n cool lights are some specs to look at.The food they served was good for the palate though it took some time for them to serve. The location is a big plus for the place.All in all a nice cafe I can say..

A new cafe on the block. Close to Hindustan Park stoppage. We visited on a Thursday evening to this deserted cafe & were greeted well by the staff.

This tiny place has 1 table on the ground floor and 3 on the 1st floor. The cafe was semi dark. We chose to sit upstairs & found that the  seating arrangements were really comfortable.

They still haven't got the menu cards ready so we had to check the print out versions of menu. 
We really wanted to have the Glory of God & other signature coffees but unfortunately most of their signature coffees are cold and both of us being little sick refrained from ordering the same.

We ordered Moroccan Chai, Classic Hot Chocolate, Mozzarella Chicken & Chicken AOP. 

Moroccan Chai was decent. Light bodied & refreshing.

Classic Hot Chocolate was above average. Could have been better if it was thicker in consistency & little more bitter. 

Chicken AOP was disappointing. There were 6 pieces of chicken stir fried with spices & herbs. I found it to be bland. The only good part was the dip which compensated for the bland taste.

Now, The Mozzarella Chicken. A big shout out for this amazing dish! This should be their signature item!
2 large pieces of fried chicken layered with mozzarella cheese on top. It was crispy, soft and succulent. The dip was adding to the taste. We loved it. 
A must try for all.

Service is good. Portion is sufficient. Price is reasonable with no extra taxes.

Ambience of the place is excellent.
Mocktail's are good and the food menu has too much to offer. Value for money & the staffs are very friendly with the guests. 
Shisha is excellent with variety of 
flavours.
It's a must visit place.

.....And my 200th 

"Wish we could turn back to the GOOD OLD DAYS
When our sang us to sleep"....
This eatery is one of the newest inclusions in the Kolkata's evergrowing names of eateries.....and what a start!! Merely some days old the place has an old charm, that reminds us of our college hideouts were frds met for a small adda over some piping tea or coffee. Hats off to the person who did the interiors; neat getup, old style clock, bulbs, and above the british like ambience is lovely.
This eatery mainly specialises in continental dishes.
Some of the dishes and drinks that we tried were-
Cucumber Mojito-Light yet refeshing, beautifully presented infused with cucumber slices and lemon chunks.
Glory Of God- This is one of their special drinks.. it's a treat to your eyes as well as taste buds. Superbly blended cold coffee toppedwith whipped cream. I simply loved it!
Quesadins(not sure of the name though) when you want to eat light try this. For me this was slightly bland in taste, but i loved the dip that added a much needed punch
Chicken Mozzarella- This dish has 4 chucks of chicken, fried and topped with mozarella. Filling and palatable, an absolutely delightful dish!!
Egg In A Hole- This was for me the star dish. Anyone will surely want to begin their day with this dish. There were 3 poached eggs in capsicum rinds acompanied with 2 toasts and dip. A healthy and yummilicious preperation.
I am just looking forward to my next visit to this place which will surely make it's mark in the culinary map of Kolkata..!!  
A very special thanks to

An impromptu visit turned out to hold quite a pleasant surprise for us. A reasonably priced, cosy little place with unexpectedly good food, and with even hookah on offer. But the key differentiator was the attentive, well-mannered waiters who upped the service quotient quite a lot.

It was an impromptu visit to this cafe today. A newly opened cafe just a few steps away from Hindustan park more. This is not a very big, spacious cafe rather a very small one. The décor is minimal and gave me a cottage type feeling. It's a two storeyed cafe and we preferred to seat upstairs. Coming to food we had ordered very berry ice tea, watermelon slush from the beverages then bruschettas from appetizers and lastly fire of bengal chicken pizza from the main course. Both the beverages were refreshing but watermelon slush was better than very berry ice tea according to me. Bruschettas were finger licking good and the pizza was ordinary. Staffs were courteous and disciplined. Service was neither too late nor too fast. Music was good too. The only negative point about this cafe is the space crunch.

With little expectations, we went to this new place. We didn't even plan on it. The place is really cozy with additional seats upstairs.
We sat downstairs. We got a hookah, a cheese maggi, a mojito and a cold drink. Everything was satisfactory.
P.S. - the staff is really courteous and the music is good.
