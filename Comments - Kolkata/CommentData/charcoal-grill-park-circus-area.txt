Charcoal Grill is situatedÂ 102 A & B, Park Street, Park Circus, Beniapukur, Kolkata, West Bengal 700017. Charcoal Grill is a multi speciality restaurant and has launched their grand buffet menu on 22 December 2017. It is a 12000 sq. ft, 220 cover two storey restaurant which boasts of three different kitchents and three separate floors for Chinese, Coastal Sea Food and North West Frontier cuisine.Â  I had been invited here as a part of Bloggers meet on the first floor to try out their new buffet menu.

Charcoal Grill has been one of the most popular restaurants in Kolkata for a long time. But the construction of Maa Flyover led to closure of half of New Park Street & we were ignoring this place due to inconveniences of commuting . Now that the Flyover work is complete & the approach road is clear they are getting back to old form though they still remain somewhat hidden by the Flyover. Today we decided to pay a visit to this place to check out their newly introduced Buffet Course . Parking was easily available under the Flyover & they ensured that it is not chargeable . We were seated on the first floor which is very well decorated & spacious . We had to wait for quite sometime as they were busy preparing the buffet spread . The place was almost empty as only two other tables were occupied apart from us . Staff behaviour was polite & they were attentive to our demands .
The Buffet spread was as follows :
Welcome Drink : They are offering one welcome drink with the buffet & we chose fresh lime soda for us .
Soup : One Veg & one Non Veg soup were on offer but we decided to skip them .
Starters : Most of the starters are served on a Sigree placed on the table & the options are quite large . Paneer Tikka Kabab , Hara Bhara Kabab , Tandoori Mushroom etc comprised the Veg segment while Fish Peshwari , Chicken Boti Kabab , Prawn Banjara completed the offerings on Sigree . Chicken Bara Kabab , Mutton Sheek Kabab & Chilly Chicken ( dry ) were served on the table by staffs . The less oily kababs with right mix of spices were truly mouthwatering . Chicken Boti Kabab & Chilly Chicken were jewel in the crown among the starters . Charcoal Grill were always renowned for their Kababs & the unlimited offering in Buffet is a clear winner .
Salad : Apart from regular onion , chilly , cucumber etc they had spicy & tasty Seafood Salad with good amount of prawns as well as Chicken Haiwaiian Salad which tasted great .
Main Course : The main course comprised of Indian , Chinese & Continental dishes & they serve nun , kulcha if asked for & it is included in the spread . Veg Kabinika Noodles , veg fried rice, mixed veg in corriander sauce ( my favourite ) & Schezwan Chicken made the Chinese section . Corn & spinach Gratin was well prepared . Chicken Biryani was very disappointing as the chicken was very dry & burned while rice lacked the aroma . Chicken Bharta , Fish Butter Masala & Mutton Rogan Josh were tasty but very little quantity was available & they took a longtime to fill them in . Peas Pulao was light & tasty .
Desserts : With 20 varieties on offer this is the biggest spread . From Cheesecake to Tarts ( lemon , chocolate ) , Brownies , Fruit Cakes , Pastries , Mousse you name it they have it . Even the Gulab Jamun & Gajar ka halwa are also there . The Fruit Cake was awesome . Then there is the Ice Cream segment where quite a few flavours with associated sauce & garnishment is available .
From our experience we got the impression that though they have arranged for a large buffet spread but they are still inexperienced in providing a total spread . It took us longtime to get our required dishes & though the staffs were trying their best to serve they are still not accustomed to the ambiance of a buffet place . We hope & believe that as the news will spread about their offerings & more & more people will throng the place they will get better in serving as they know that they have to compete with other popular buffet restaurants . Hopefully I will have to revise my rating upwards when I visit here in future .
For today we had a nice time & enjoyed good food .

We celebrated the beginning of the year by dining out in Charcoal Grill.
The service of the staff was courteous. The decor and music made the ambience a pleasant one. The food quality was mediocre... there wasn't much variety. The starters were pleasing to taste but the main course was disappointing.
The restaurant attempted to bring in a colourful assortment of desserts but the cheesecake was far from original.
Upgradation of the quality of food will help bring a better experience to the guests.

Charcoal grill had been around for the longest of time. I would often go there to enjoy sizzlers as a kid and grilled kebabs. Of late the restaurant has been hidden under construction of flyover but its charm still remains the same. Recently they have launched a grand new buffet with the largest number of items possible in a spread. The kebabs being served in individual sigrees on your table and a large spread of main course for you to help yourself with. The main course contains a great variety of indian and oriental dishes coming in vegetarian and non vegetarian options.The buffet also contains over 20+ varieties of desserts to choose form.

One of Kolkataâ€™s favourite multi-specialty restaurants,today,launched an elaborate lunch & dinner buffet, which will be available from Monday to Sunday, throughout the year. Delicious kebabs, Sizzling live over charcoal on your table. All you can eat buffet format,but served on skewers by waiters at the table, match made in heaven! So less oily kebabs that the authentic floavours of base was coming out nice. LovedÂ  the prawn Most and then the Mutton Sheek Kebabs.

Charcoal Grill is one of Calcutta's first authentic seafood restaurants, which has set a benchmark with its quality seafood, coupled with fine dining ambience. They have recently launched a grand buffet which will be a part of the regular menu. I was invited at the launch of the grand buffet. 

The buffet begins with a vegetarian ( Tomato Soup ) and a non vegetarian soup ( Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup ). There is one veg salad ( Russian salad ) and two non vegetarian salads - Chicken Hawaiian Salad and Spicy Seafood Salad. I loved each of the salads. 

The kebabs were next, they were served in grills on the tables. The vegetarian kebabs were Tandoori Gobi, Tandoori Aloo, Tandoori Mushrooms and Paneer Tikka Kebab. I tried the potato kebab only. The potato was soft, juicy and well grilled. 

The non vegetarian kebabs on the grill were Chicken Haryali Kebab, Tandoori Mahi Tikka and Prawn Malai Kebabs. The chicken tasted good. The fish kebabs stole the show. They were so soft that they melted in my mouth. The prawns were juicy and succulent. 

The other starters were Veg Hara Bhara Kebab, Chicken Burrah Kebab, Crispy Chicken and Mutton Seekh Kebab. The crispy chicken was my favorite. 

Shifting to the mains, I was amazed at the huge assortment. The Chinese options were Veg Hakka Noodles with Shredded Chicken in Manchurian Sauce. I loved the combo. There was a veg side dish as well. 

The North Indian options were Dal Makhani, Pindi Chana, Paneer Butter Masala, Chicken Bharta, Fish Butter Masala and Mutton Rogan Josh. The chana was lovely. Once again, I fell for the fish. The mutton was juicy and very well cooked. These dishes were paired with Butter Naan, Peas Pulao and Chicken Biryani. It was heavenly. It was good to see such great effort given to the main course as to the starters. 

The desserts had close to twenty wonderful options. The Moong Dal Halwa was brilliant. The brownies tasted good. The blueberry and mango Cheesecakes were the best among the lot. I also loved the lemon tart, chocolate mousse and the chocolate cake. 

I completed my meal at the ice cream counter where I chose to have a sundae. The owner herself took the pleasure of preparing a sundae for me with Chocolate and Vanilla Ice creams, topped with Oreo biscuits, KitKat and chocolate sauce. 

Overall, such an amazing buffet spread is quite rare to find in the city. The service is excellent and so is the hospitality. The pricing of the buffet is extremely reasonable, which makes the buffet here one of the best in the city !

I work in Bangalore and every time I'm in Kolkata, Charcoal grill is a "HAVE TO GO" place for me. It's a restaurant which satisfies your cravings for both Chinese and Indian food.

For Chinese food,i love the pan fried noodles and the Devil's chicken!

For Indian food, I feast on the chicken reshmi kebab and the mutton sheekh kebabs.

This place has amazing sea food also. The squid calamari and the butter crab is sumptuous!

Charcoal Grill serves alcohol too. Their Long Island Iced Tea is to die for(not for the weak hearted though)! Do try it to know what I mean ! ;-)

I have been eating here for more than 5 years now! The ambience is amazing and the staff is courteous.

A must visit for those who crave for authentic Chinese food in Kolkata !

Time and again we try to find a place that can satiate our desires with mouthwatering kebabs and the authentic kolkata biryani. Charcoal grill never lets me down, quick service, soothing ambience and finger licking food.
my favorites are - dal makhani, garlic naan, crab with neer dosa, tandoori chicken and the 'very hit' chicken biryani.
we always wipe out the food before clicking pics, this time here are some from their new desert selection. (taken at a recent tasting)

Conveniently located at Park Circus area, this place is serving good North Indian dishes for years. The white 2 storeyed building is hard to miss, ambiance is pleasant, food is great and service is decent. Though some of the dishes are slightly overpriced, the overall menu pricing is reasonable.

Went there for a family lunch scene a few days back. The restaurant is very spacious with ample seating arrangements. 
Now coming to the food, we ordered - 
Starters-
1. Chicken Reshmi Kebab- very less quantity. The kebab were not divided into pieces and considering the price it wasn't justified. 
2. Chicken Tai-Pan - it was very tasty 
Main Course - 
1. Chilli Garlic Noodles- a tad bit sweet. Otherwise it was good
2. Veg Hakka Noodles - better than the chilli garlic noodles
3. Veg fried rice
4. Tandoori roti 
5. Schezwan Chicken- schezwan sauce is supposed to be spicy but this dish from this place wasn't spicy at all. Instead it had sweetness. It wasn't good. 
6. Chicken Rara- the best dish. A must must must try! 

We had also ordered a dry martini with vodka. It was good too. 
Would like to visit again sometime. 
Happy Fooding â™¥

The food is delicious , fabulous ambience,  good service.  If your  in Calcutta you cannot miss this place. I  love the dal makhani,  chicken Bharta , egg biryani.  My sister prefers Chinese that's  why we ordered a bit of that as well and it was worth it. The egg rice noodles with butter prawns , chilli fish dry and  chicken in Hunan sauce. The food was scrumptious. The best part of it all was my mouth watering desert. Melting chocolate with vanilla ice cream.  I  don't think any joint can beat this desert of there's.  You should definitely go to this place  at least  once so that like it did to me it will surely captivate your taste buds and  you  will be sure to visit more often . This place serves some of the best food in Calcutta.

Charcoal Grill is in a different  league. I personally feel that it is an underrated  restaurant. I  have been here a couple  of  times and even ordered in. The food in terms quality as well as quantity has never disappointed me. 
I love the dal makhani, lachha Prathna, egg rice noodles and the fish in chilli wine sauce. My personal favourite is the melting chocolate, you can taste the chocolate oozing out. I have had the melting chocolate in different places but the one available here is to die for. 
The ambiance and service  is top notch. This place is highly recommended.

This is one of my favourite places for a family dinner. Situated near the Park Circus crossing, this restaurant is a little difficult to spot due to the newly constructed fly-over. It is a very underrated restaurant which will give a few other restaurants in the locality a serious run for it's money. I have visited this place quite a number of times and have never been disappointed.

Visited this place yesterday, to celebrate Mothers' Day. Ordered Chicken Reshmi Kabab for starters. The chicken pieces were really small compared to other places, but tasted just perfect. For main course i went with North Indian and ordered Tandoori Roti and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. The chicken was really tender served with a good amount of spicy gravy. My mother chose Chinese and ordered Veg Hakka Noodles and Schezwan Chicken. I was greatly impressed by the quantity of food served.

For dessert it was Apple Pie with Ice cream and Chocolate Mousse. The pie stole the show. A plate of hot and fresh apple pie with the perfect amount of sweetness and a hint of cinnamon served with a scoop of ice cream can never go wrong. Definitely going to go back for more. The mousse was average.

The service is slow. However the food is worth the wait. Fine ambiance. Pocket pinch is Rs. 1200 for two. Strongly recommended.

The children had opted for cold drinks, while the rest of us tried the mocktails and cocktails special mention must be made for the strawberry margarita.
Main Course 
. Chana Pindi- trust me when I  say its the best in Kolkata. I haven't had better. 
. Dal Makhani- was very well made. It had a proper balance of the taste. 
. Chicken Butter Masala- big pieces of chicken cooked in delicious gravy. 
. Chicken Bharta- it tasted just fine.
Breads

.Masala Kulcha
The breads were soft and well made.
Overall we enjoyed the food. Ambiance is very soothing. The food is priced well compared to the quantity.  The staff was very helpful and courteous. We had no place for desert, but I  will come back with  my family!!!

It's a wonderful restaurant conveniently located near Park Circus' 7 Point Crossing.. Their Squid calamari and Crab Butter Pepper Garlic with Neer dosa are to die for! Not to forget their chilly chicken and Ching Kao (steamed dumpling). With ample space to accommodate a nice family lunch or dinner, Charcoal Grill has enough to offer to every kind of palate. They also have a very courteous staff and an excellent bar, which is stocked with the best liquor there is. Parking is not an issue. Charcoal Grill is a must-visit while you're on your food trail in Calcutta. :)

This restaurant is located underneath the MA flyover. 
You can come easily from the seven point crossing, by taking the road on the left underneath the flyover. 
It has been the place where my friends and I come for get togethers. 
Since we are a group of vegetarians and the variety they offer is huge. We are never disappointed. 
The ambiance is soothing and calm. The service prompt and the staff is courteous. 
We usually opt for the Indian cuisine. 
The Dal Makhani and Pindi Chole is the best I have had in Kolkata! Just the right amount of everything.
The breads soft, you must try the pickle they serve with the Indian cuisine.
You just feel at home here. This place is a must. Highly recommend.

Charcoal Grill has been my all time favourite restaurant in Kolkata. It is an under rated restaurant, it will give any restaurant in Park Street a run for its money. The quality of the food here is phenomenal. One should try the cocktails here my all time favourite is the strawberry margarita!! ðŸ˜ƒ They even have a 1:1 offer on draught beer all through out the day which makes it convenient for me and my friends to come here for a drink.
I had come here with my friends yesterday and we had a great time. They have proper valet parking in front of the restaurant so we didn't have any problem to park the car.
Coming to the food, for starters we ordered the squid/ shrimp calamari along with the sauce which is to die for. I even tried the Bombay duck fry which was excellent, the salad which accompanies the dish gave it a fresh zest. My friend had ordered steam chicken dimsum the covering was perfect with more filling and less flour around it. Definitely very different from all the places I have eaten! For main course we had neer dosa and crab butter pepper garlic it was the best crab preparation I have had so far. At last we come to the desert and as the saying goes 'Alls well that ends well.' We ordered the melting chocolate and apple pie along with ice cream. The melting chocolate was suggested to us by the manager and let me tell you it was gooey, warm and delicious. When you scoop the top, chocolate sauce pours out of it just wow.ðŸ˜€
Overall I had a wonderful dinning experience service was prompt, staff was courteous, pocket friendly place and we left with our tummies full and a big smile on our faces!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ƒ I am glad Charcoal Grill has excellent quality food, kudos to the team.

Went for a quick saturday lunch. The seafood fried rice was awesome. The crab dish with neer dosa was superlative. It was suggested by the restaurant manager. I never tested neer dosa before. The vetki dish was also very good. Ambience was relaxed,Overall good experience. One problem is there is no nearby parking.

The ambiance is fine. The bar is good. But the best part is the food. We had fish Xacuti and sea food rice which was prepared to its best. The taste melts into your mouth and urges you to have more. The quantity of serving is ample for 2. A little higher side on the pocket but the taste balances it.

Normal quality food. Ambience is okay ( not that great). Service is good. Not enough crowd. I consider this to be a bit high price. Rest it's okay considering the area of it's location.

Charcoal grill is a restaurant cum bar located near Park Circus just under the flyover. They serve Chinese, continental and North Indian food. Along with it they always have an offer of buy one get one on their draught beer. We went there on late Sunday night and decided to order couple of beers and then straight to main course. We ordered rotis, aloo do piazza, yellow dal and jeera rice. Contrary to my expectations the food turned out to be really good. Rotis were crispy, dal was perfect and aloo do piazza was one of the best we had in town. Interiors and decor are pretty ordinary like a normal 80s restaurant. Service is quick and prices are quite reasonable. Good option for a quick beer and dinner if you are in that area and looking for a reasonable place.

The 3.5 rating goes only for the food I ordered. Overall I'd probably rate this place a 3 at best. The interiors were lacklustre at best and it was mostly empty even on a Friday night. The ladies washroom was unlit up until we informed the waiters. The cocktails were definitely sub par if not terrible. Now coming to the food. The batter fried squid was pretty good, largely so because of the truly excellent dip it was served with. The prawn kolapodi (I.e. the fried prawn, I don't remember what it's called on the menu) was decidedly average. It wasn't even de-shelled or served with a dip or accompaniment. Now, coming to the mains, the mutton stew was amazing although the appam it was served with was cold. The Goan fish curry was fragrant and high on flavour although it wasn't as good as it could have been since they used only one type of fish which was really bland to taste. All in all the food wasn't half bad but it certainly wasn't memorable either.

CG is a nice place for some good food at pocket friendly prices. 

Located near park circus crossing I have had experience with the place for take away or deliveries for a few times. The service in that regard seems pretty fast and the order is prepared well timely. 

I have stuck to the north indian cuisine on all occasions and it has not disappointed. The paneer tikka is lovely. The main course consists generally of the kali daal that is average but the naan and aloo dum, paneer makhani are nice. 

Obviously this does not seem to be a fine dining place but a rather pocket friendly eatery that gives good options with nice preparations without causing manor financial expense.

Alive and ticking.
Despite being an old place, Charcoal Grill still manages to shine in glory and live upto expectations.

From the entrance you will notice neat, clean and classy arrangements..mark of a fine dinning restaurant.

We tried one of their specialities, 'Stuffed Squid Tandoori'. Squid filled with delicious stuffings and grilled in a tandoor. Served with green chutney and salad, it was a perfect balance of spicy and subtle taste. A must try item.
Next we tried Moonfan rice and Pepper Garlic Chicken. The quantity of both the main course items were enormous. About 12 succulent pieces of chicken in a garlicky black bean sauce went well with the moonfan rice. The moonfan rice was freshly prepared with lot of mushrooms and the fluffyness of the rice added to its taste.

Service was cordial and one of the best you can get.
Charcoal grill has huge sitting capacity for hosting parties. Pricing is bit on the higher side, but totally worth it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I'm just a huge fan! Just love this place.

Maybe its my childhood memories, maybe its the sheer menu variety, maybe its the well executed cooking on each dish.

They offer so many varieties and dishes not just varieties that simply are not easily available in town.

Its the one place I would suggest such a variety of dishes, so do try -

Squid butter pepper garlic with ne'er dosa
Chicken chettinad
Chicken xauti
Honey crispy chilli chicken
Appams
Mustard fish and mushrooms
Garlic naan

I could go on... But I suggest you try it.

Side note-
They got covered up by the Maa flyover, but they kept up their service and even kept calling with offers and everything, they must have taken a blow because of that. But they've stayed strong and serve good food.

This used to be a very popular restaurant, however it is hidden under the flyover now, and people barely come here. The one on one offer on drought beer brought us here. The beer was decent. The crispy honey chicken was too sweet and too dry that it became chewy. We ordered crispy konjee lamb and instructed them to keep it soft instead of crispy. The meat was soft but again was very sweet for a meat preparation. Both the dishes came in very less portions. We wanted to have a crab dish but crabs were not available. So we called it a day. Had tried seafood here, long time back. The experience was worth it. Somehow the food and the service wasn't at par with my past experience.

LOCATION:

After the Park Circus 7 point crossing towards the "Maa" flyover. Do not climb the fly over. Go below it and you will spot the place on the right.

OVERVIEW AND INTERIORS:

Charcoal Grill has been around forever now. Its not as popular as some of the places on the Park Street but then has a loyal clientele among those who have tried their elaborate menu. As for me, I have had food delivered from here on two occasions. I have never had a dine in experience here and normally I do not rate restaurants based on deliveries so highly, but then I think this one deserves it.

WINE & DINE:

Our order consisted of Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala, Malai Kofta, Tandoori Roti and Butter Naan.

Food was delivered in about 1 hour and 15 mins from ordering which was not bad considering the delivery was in Alipore. I was actually surprised they delivered this far.

The Kali Dal was great. It had a nice texture to it and was just right with its creaminess. The liked the dark brown color it had as opposed to black in many places and light brown in others. It meant that they had got their ratio of dal, butter and cream right.Â 

The Paneer Butter Masala was one of the best I have had in the city. I practically licked the bowl off.Â 

The Malai Kofta was nice but a little on the sweeter side. While many might really like it, I dont have much sugar tolerance with North Indian Food.

The breads were well made and fresh. The Tandoori Roti was crispy like I had ordered and the butter naan was soft gooey and light.Â 

Prices were between moderate and expensive. The food costed us Rs. 1500 approximately.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

I loved the food. I might be able to write more here once I visit the the place.

VERDICT:

Great North Indian food delivered hot and fresh and decent enough prices. Recommended !

The reasturant has become less popular now due to the construction in front of it. The food was decent both the time i had visited here, the decor and service was also nice. One complaint that i had was i felt that the chicken and mutton pieces were being prepared in one place and then dunked in different gravy. The texture to the pieces of meat was missing. The kebabs were good though.

Its been disappointing to know how the food quality has deteriorated in the past few months. We had ordered dal makhani, pindi chana, masala kulcha and veg biryani as a take away. The dal was over cooked and had a thick layer of oil floating on it. The taste wasnt so good either. Even the kulcha was not so good. The only thing we liked was the pindi chana. Overall, I didnt enjoy my food much.

I'd bought takeout from this restaurant a long time back. Items were tandoori naan, paneer tikka butter masala and chicken biryani with mutton. As per taste goes, very good food. Paneer was succulent, with the right amount of gravy. Naan was also very soft and chew-able unlike some that are almost difficult to tear with bare hands.

Had visited this plc yesterday for a family dinner and was literally left distraughted.. The food out here is just not upto the mark.. We opted for indian cuisine and therefore wud not be able to gv reviews on the chinese cuisine.. For starters we opted for chicken reshmi kabab, chicken tandoori, mutton seikh.. All of which was preety decent.. Among the veg starters we opted for hara bhara kabab.. It was honestly made quiet well with lots of peas in it.. For main course we opted for malai kofta which was extremely pathetic,it was soo horrible tht we almost felt lyk puking.. I jst dnt undrstnd hw cn any1 make such horrible food!! The peas pulao was also quiet average.. For the non veg main course we ordered prawn masala, chicken bharta and a chicken item whose name i just cnt recall.. The chicken and the prawns gravy was exactly the same and to worsen it thy had added green peas in it.. Chicken bharta was also not upto the mark.. For breads we ordered lacha paratha, garlic naan, tandoori roti.. All of which were fine.. Coming to the service, the staffs were easily approachable and thy served us well... Had not the food saddened us we wud hv bn really impressed by the staff. !!

To be very specific the prawn soup and squid tastes excellent. But the seafood rice which we took tastes just like south indian  curd rice. Then again the chicken side dish was too good.
This restaurant is neither too costly nor pocket friendly. Once or twice visit is good for this place.

Known for its seafood and serving quite an amazing seafood platter Charcoal Grill is a good place for Chinese as well as we discovered. We went there on a Sunday afternoon at around 4 and the place was totally empty. Due to the heavy road constructions going on just in front of it(as on 13.09.2015) parking could be an issue although we faced none. The dim lit decor sets the mood to enjoy a meal and we opted for lung fung soup and dry pepper garlic chicken as appetisers. The soup had egg whites and sliced mushroom in plenty however chicken seemed few. The pepper garlic chicken was wonderfully cooked with the right amount of tenderness in the chicken and crispness outside. Next we went for pepper garlic chicken again, this time in a gravy as we were told it would be totally different, along with bekti tai pan and chicken fried rice. For the fish, it was fried and then tossed in chili and garlic, although i didn't like the taste of bekti itself very much. The chicken dish was absolutely amazing and is a must try. Pieces were tender and the gravy lip snacking. I could live without the carrots in the fried rice but no complaints with the quantity. There was a 1:1 offer on draught beer but I refrained, and instead found the lime soda only average. The service was satisfactory,the prices on the higher side. I have enjoyed on all occasions i have been here and Charcoal Grill remains a very good place to try all sorts of cuisines that they offer.

I have been visiting this place from the time it was called Shraddha.i love seafood especially the Konkani type and this was the only place in Kolkata where I could get them.

Then they became charcoal grill but I remained loyal to them.I have not been able to visit anytime recently though.

Hence was shocked to see the cage totally dwarfed by a flyover being constructed in the abutting road and on a Saturday night the eatery absolutely empty.

We were a large group of friends with family and the waiters assured us about the freshness of products.

Having settled in after some drinks we asked for our perennial favourites :

Prawn koliwada : 5/5
Pomphret tandoori : 3/5
Kerala mutton dry 4.5/5

One can see that we enjoyed what we ate.

We followed it up with some more mutton and ne'er dosa and appam as well as

Crab butter pepper garlic de shelled Â 4/5

Finished with ice cream and cream caramels.Service was attentive and warm.And we remain faithful forever.

During my bi-yearly visits to Kolkata, I do try to take my family out for dinner. Over the years Charcoal Grill has become one of the preferred choices for everyone.

My family is mainly vegetarian so I will not be able to review the non-veg dishes but going by what I have seen I do feel that should be equally good.

This place is not usually too crowded but it would be good idea to make a reservation. Located near Park Circus, its not easy to miss this place.

We usually end up order babycorn, chilly potato and paneer tikka for starters. The paneer is really well prepared and must have. In the main course, it's dal, chola and some other sabji along with Garlic naan.

The servings are a delight and the service is quite good. And above all the food is quite reasonable on pocket. So overall would say 8/10 and a safe, good bet for eating out anyday!

Used to visit this place quite regularly with my parents during my childhood. I fondly remember this place for serving delicious briyanis..way better than the usual affair served at Arsalan or Shiraz. The chinese here used to be extraordinary as well. Unfortunatly haven't had a chance to visit this place in a long time. Hope the quality hasn't deteriorated over the years.

It's an old restaurant literally old, you can understand why I am saying that if u closely observe the furniture here in this dimly lit restaurant. It's kinda situated in a not so happening place which attracts not many here. Food is good specially sea food is worth it its not great but comparatively really good. It's comfortable not that crowded service is slow nobody is in a hurry out here, so if u are in a mood of lazing around and having food and spending lot of time here nobody is going to disturb you. It's not that expensive so worth a shot try sea food you won't be disappointed.

Although I'm not at all into seafood, I still liked this place because of the other items that are on offer. The menu is quite huge with number of preparations one can try from.

Their ambiance is too good and it's spacious with well organized tables. The in house service seems prompt to me and I had a nice experience. I'd definitely suggest Charcoal Grill to people looking for a place to sit and have good food at affordable price in Park Circus area.

Was thinking from a long time to visit, finally checked in. Lot of space, no need for reservation in advance. Ambience is fine, service is good. Quantity is too good, you need to go there with full empty stomach. Enough quantity for two people. I was full before i could order main course. A must visit. Hope to visit soon.

2. Burnt Ginger Fried Rice - ok sort of.
3. Seafood Rice - just wow.
4. Ghansu Lamb - boneless fillet in white gravy.
5. Chicken Xacuti - out of this world.

Again I'm back. Ordered Fish malgudi and Lobster thermidor yesterday. 1st one is a betki preparation deep fried. 2nd one is utterly delicious. A must try.

I had ordered for a home delivery last night and I wud like to recommend it to my fellow mates in NRS or in n around sealdah.. 
We had ordered crab meat balls, pan fried noodles and lamb in green chilli sauce with pineapples. Portions of each dish is satisfying and was still steaming hot wen delivered. Crab meat ball was served with boiled beans and peas and potatoes. I wud have loved a little more of crab meat in d preparation but it wasn't disappointing in any way. The pan fried noodles was good. Portions of vegetables and meat was ok.Lamb meat was soft and pineapples were fresh. Gravy was spicy as u wud expect. Overall it was worth indulging.
Service was quick. 
Im certainly up for another grab .

The place is spacious with 2 / 3 floors, ambiance is a bit tardy, but food makes up for it...specially seafood

Each and every dish , mostly fish/ seafood, was amazing , very tasty, and whole family of six people liked it all.

It was not that busy....dont know whether this is good or bad sign....but we were seated comfortably..service was good...food was better

If you are up for seafood, this is an amazing place in Calcutta. Don't miss this place.
Perhaps, they can pull up their socks and smarten up the ambiance, which at present Â seems bit retro and rusty-ish

One of favourite chinese restro!! I've been going here since the last 8-9yrs when it used to be "Shraddha" & recently went there on the eve of my parents' 23rd marriage anniversary. Its situated beside park circus maidan route connecting to the 4 no. bridge!! Although it might be very difficult to locate this place at the moment due to the construction of a new fly over in the restro's route

This is a restro cum bar with 2 floors with the upper floor being more spacious for family dinner while the ground floor consisting of dining + separate room for the bar..

The food is very good & in large quantity.. I have tried their fish items namely Fish Tai pai,chilli fish etc but i would like to recommend a dish named "Pepper Garlic Chicken" which is one of their best dishes in my opinion. Also their fried rices are very light & tasteful. They also serve liquor outside the Bar area as well.

So all in all a worthy place to visit if you are around park circus area & a chinese freak

Its become a tradition now where me and my friends that have become family go for new year dinner, each year on the 1st of January. So this time we landed up at Charcoal grill which is very conveniently located (except right now due to flyover work) near the park circus 7 point crossing. The decor is decent and the staff is nice. The seating is comfortable though could be more spacious as 5 of us on the table was kind of a tussle. I had the hot and sour soup which i felt was really nice as it was not too spicy and very tasty. We ordered for lat me kai and chicken in fire sauce it was i think for starters. I liked the chicken in fire sauce better but the lat me kai was nice too. The main course that we ordered was veg chilli garlic noodles, schezwan rice, chilly fish and one chicken gravy. All the food was tasty, not too spicy just according to my liking but they can still improve on its taste i feel. The bill was around 600 per head which i believe is pretty alright. A good place for sure ????

Ever since I have been to Charcoal Grill last Durga Puja 2013, it was always on my 'to-go-again' list and finally i started off my year with good food as i settled down here last evening with my partner. Ambiance and service was good. Good footfall, but not overcrowded. Order was simple - Special crab and Oyster Konkani style with Mutte Appam and Neer Dosa. Crab tasted like last time - the butter garlic one - and now we are confused which order they jumbled up. Oyster was good - but a little too little considering the price. Food is good here.. it is a shame seeing people ordering regular tandoori and Chinese here rather than the house specialties, even though prices are on the higher side. We love it here and appreciate the seafood dishes.Both times, the experience has been very satisfying. I surely consider re-visiting. 
Note - a little thought on innovative desserts would be great.

What more can a person ask from a restaurant than great food, able waiters, reasonable n well stacked bar and a classy ambience ??

Bearing all the above mentioned traits, charcoal grill is, especially, the perfect culinary escapade for the seafood aficionado. The steamed crab here is great and so are the chicken dishes (Indian and Chinese alike). I have been to this place thrice (separated by a great deal of time) and it has maintained its quality surprisingly well. Even during Christmas the place was not overcrowded (owing to a generous floor space).

Although seafood is a bit on the pricier side, there is no compromise with quality. Also, a great place for a quite date :)

The lamb tossed in schezwan  sauce was very tasty. The fish tandoori was very good too. They also make good mojitos. I will obviously visit this place again. The price was also mid-ranged.

The ambience was good although the startling absence of customers did surprise me. The menu offers a variety of options especially in sea food but unfortunately the oysters that we tried was quite a disappointment. It was more of oyster-gone-wrong-in-indian-spices! However soup was delicious n creamy, the broccoli and cream chicken soup! 
P.S. Stick to indian at this grill base!

Placed very close to the 7 point connector in Park Circus, the food continues to be mediocre in taste. Except the fact of the large interior space, nothing interesting here.

OrderedÂ 
1. Squid Koliwada #Batter had no taste. Squid was over fried and rubbery.
2. Golden Fried Babycorn and Mushroom #Decent taste, but this is one of the most simplest dishes available at any random eatery.
3. Spicy Coriander Rice #Filled with green peas. Not sure if they wanted to enhance the decor of the dish and decided to add green peas to make the rice look green.
4. Devils Chicken #Decent taste.
5. Chili Garlic Noodles #Awful.
Add to this the place is overpriced for the type of food and quantity it serves. It was surprising to see them pack food in paper boxes (no - they did not have a container) and charge money for that. Overall, Charcoal Grill was a disappointment.

So much of Variety in the menu including North India, CHinese and Sea food.
The best dishes being Won-ton, Paneer Spinach roll, Malai kofta, the soup is also good and the best for the non-vegetarians would be Chicken in Fire Sauce..... Not very fond of Sea food so haven't tasted Crab but i m sure it is gonna be the best.Â 
One should definitely try, good ambiance and hospitality is also good, quick service. Â 
Having two floors and large in size with lip smacking food i must say.

Charcoal grill...i believe this is one of the most underrated restaurants in kolkata....partly bcoz its location is not prime....but still,it would give any park street restsurant a run for their money anyday..
Born as Shradhha initially,this restaurant was rechristened  to CG few years down the line... I feel CG is more in keeping with the varied menu offered here...
The resto is sprawling,spanning two whole floors..decor is minimalistic urban and standard.. but what will blow u away is their food...
Lip smacking good is what the food here is...they serve an assortment of cuisines.... north indian,chinese,some continental and wait-for-it....coastal snd seafood even!!!
Having had the good fortune of living nearby,im more or less a regular and hav tried out many dishes...do try the north indian fare if u visit the first time..their dal makhani id daresay is the best ud get in kol...reshmi kabab,paneer shashlik,fish banjara,malai kabab,paneer spinach are some of their better appetisers..othr main course favorites would be paneer butter masala, palak paneer,paneer tikka butter masala,chicken badami,chicken rara...phew,the list is endless....the dishes are not too spicy yet delicious..and the butter naans are the softest iv had till date
They rustle up some great chinese too...be it lat me kai,gravy noodles or hunan chicken..
Im not much of a seafood fan,but iv heard rave reviews bout it...iv just had the fried calamari (squid) once,was tasty enough...
Prices have been hiked quite a bit,but still id say its worth the gastronomic experience...
When you are sick of queuing in front of park street joints on weekends,go ahead and give this place a try!!! Its so huge that ull usually get a table despite the crowd...

P.S. Drinks- they do serve a mean pinacolada!!

The rating should tell you that this is place is special for me. If seafood is your thing too, then Charcoal Grill is a must visit. Even the service is simply brilliant. This probably the the only place anywhere that the head waiter can recognize me even after 3 years (and I'm not a regular). 
Tip: 1. Try the seafood rice, and neer dosa as accompaniments.
2. The staff are experts at gauging your preferences and portions with the right input.
3. (Special tip) If your guilty pleasures include crabs and noisy eating, then order the butter garlic crab (with the shell of course!).

Im not much of a seafood fan,but iv heard rave reviews bout it...iv just had the fried calamari (squid) once,was tasty enough...
Prices have been hiked quite a bit,but still id say its worth the gastronomic experience...
When you are sick of queuing in front of park street joints on weekends,go ahead and give this place a try!!! Its so huge that ull usually get a table despite the crowd...

P.S. Drinks- they do serve a mean pinacolada!!

Charcoal Grill.. Aaa.. What I say about this place.. I used to visit since it was named as "Sraddha".. Perfect family restaurant. Specially renowned for their sea food dishes.. But they are equally good with Indian and also continental.. So it is a full marks from my side.. :)

The rating should tell you that this is place is special for me. If seafood is your thing too, then Charcoal Grill is a must visit. Even the service is simply brilliant. This probably the the only place anywhere that the head waiter can recognize me even after 3 years (and I'm not a regular). 
Tip: 1. Try the seafood rice, and neer dosa as accompaniments.
2. The staff are experts at gauging your preferences and portions with the right input.
3. (Special tip) If your guilty pleasures include crabs and noisy eating, then order the butter garlic crab (with the shell of course!).

Had planned to try this place out as I happen to cross it quite frequently. Food was quite good with a variety of Indian and Chinese platter. The ambience was nice... N they have Valey parking. Only thing was that I found it to be slightly overpriced, but a definite recommendation for the adventurous...

My memories of this place is in its older avatar *Sraddha*. My dad's office was close-by and while I was working there, we would often send a peon to get lunch packed from here. Most of the time it would be chicken chowmein. Simple things were well made.

I have visited this restaurant on two occasions. Once I was kind of put off because they had batter fried prawns with the shell on, which to me is a pain! On another occasion I was with vegetarian people and they ordered the meal, which was pretty pleasant. no complaints. We had the usual dal, paneer and roti kind of meal.

This place is renowned to do good food, and as Rukshana pointed out, is rather underrated. The interiors is a little odd. And the staff on an occasion did not evoke much faith.

Charcoal grill is a good place to visit in park street,(its near the 7 point connector). Previously called Shraddha,this place was later christened, Charcoal Grill .

The menu includes a lot of sea food items, indian and chinese. Though im a vegetarian, i sometimes eat chicken here,namely chicken reshmi butter masala, which was good.It was accompanied by butter tandoori roti.I have also tasted their chinese, it is okay,i didnt find it too appealing to my taste buds.
The interiors are neat, just about okay,and the food has been inconsistent. My rating is biased on the chicken preparations here, which i quite liked.

The reason I haunted this restaurant for quite some time was the collection of some of the best squid recipes one can find in Kolkata, until it seemed they stopped having it anymore. The other things on the menu were not too bad, but some of the portions were too little. I guess its fitting to mention here that there are several items on the menu which are priced okay, but the staple food is quite expensive, be it rice or roti/naan type items. Also, the service time is way way too long, especially when after 30 minutes they report that they don't have that particular item.

I was there for the first time. dining room is spacious enough and well decorated.  ambience is great.  we started with bhetki Banzara kabab and ordered for the same for second time .. believe me it was finger linking good. at main course we had masala kulcha and bhetki tikka kabab masala. this is also fantastic.  let me inform you that you won't get tht vetki tikka kabab masala on menu card. but one of the person who is in charge of the day he suggested me to go for this item. food quality and service great. but a little bit high priced. otherwise excellent.

Located in the very heart of Kolkata, Charcoal Grill is a heart-warming place to dine with your friends, colleagues, relatives, family or even acquaintances. I've been eating here ever since it bore the name Shraddha. And boy, the food IS good here.  In fact, I'd say it's awesome. The restaurant is well lit and decorated, and the chairs (read sofas) and tables are a pleasure to use. The staff is well-behaved and offer excellent suggestions. The price is competitive, but the food is excellent for the price. I'm myself a foodie, and I do like to experiment with different items, but there is one thing I order every time, be it any occassion. That is, the Paneer Spinach Roll. It is a delicacy that will set even the most hardcore paneer or spinach haters drooling. Do order that the next time you visit. 
Another great dish served there is the American Chop Suey. I know it's the most common thing, with chowmein-like Chop Suey available in every second roadside stall, but the one here is worth eating. 
I once ordered the lamb here, and by God, it was good. Just awesome. The lamb was cooked so perfectly, that I almost mistook it for cotton. It was so soft. 
I've also tried Chicken in Fire Sauce. Believe me, the name sounds intimidating, but the dish isn't that spicy. Even toddlers can have it. It's good. Check it out.
Now coming to the desserts, Oh! Apple Pie, Ice Cream with Melting Chocolate, Tutti Frutti Ice Cream, these are the kings and queens of the desserts there. 
So I'd say, go to this restaurant yourself and check it out. I'm sure you WILL like it.

I have been frequenting Charcoal Grill since those days when it was called "Shraddha" and its one of those places that has very happy memories and associations for me. These guys serve up awesome sea-food and the one thing that makes them stand out is that they have always served up quality produce and I have never had cause to complain on this front. Their biggest drawback is service and I sincerely hope the management works on this aspect because service along with good food is what draws repeat visits from a patron. I would have rated them a "4" but I usually order home delivery and the last couple of times I was a bit upset because they seem to have no fixed minimum amount for delivery which is quite strange. 
Coming to the food ( my favorite part of every review worth its salt ) Start with Creole Calamari which is delicious batter fried Calamari rings , Fish Malgudi which is a fillet of Bhekti stuffed with sea food and fried ... brilliant stuff. My staple must have is the Goan Sea Food Rice .... simple yet bursting with flavors and absolutely yummy. Kind of like an Indian Paella and my hot pick. Pair that with the Chicken Xacuti , the Kerala Mutton Stew pairs perfectly with the Appam and is a flavorful combo. All the sea-food preparations grilled or steamed are lovely , the Lobster Thermidor was surprisingly good. To be honest I have rarely tried the typical Indian and Chinese menu and can vouch for them only as starters not the mains. Chicken Reshmi Kebab , Fish Hariyali Kebab, Chili Honey Crispy Chicken and Mutton Bara Kebab are all good options that I can vouch for. If you like sea food especially coastal cuisine you should put this one on your wish list for sure.



----- 08 Nov, 2012 -----

I have been patronising this place for years and find it to be a very under rated restaurant .... my personal favourites are the Fish Malabari for starters alonfg with the calamari  and the sea food rice, chicken xacuti, aaapam and dry mutton for mains. All their sea-food items are good and they make great preparations of coastal,north indian and chinese food. They also have a home - delivery service which I frequently use. A must visit for all sea food lovers !

I have been to â€˜Charcoal Grillâ€™ several times and had pleasant feelings every time. So when I hear that â€˜Goan Food Festivalâ€™ going on there, I donâ€™t want to miss that chance. I went there with my friend. We ordered â€˜Chicken Cefrealâ€™ as starter; it comes with complementary beer pints. The plate had 14 diced boneless chickens, sautÃ©ed with spring onion, celery, green chilly and other condiments imparting its distinct taste and crispiness. We were desperately hungry & wolfed down most of it within a minute of it being put on table. A.C. was not working on the corner we sat, as soon reported the matter they change our seat. As for the main course, the combination of â€˜Goan Seafood Fried Riceâ€™ and â€˜Mutton Vindalooâ€™ was heavenly great. But the most I liked was the â€˜Mutton Vindalooâ€™ cooked with full onions and had an awesome taste. If you are a sea-food lover, there's a whole lot of coastal veg. & sea-food to choose from. I am old customer of this restaurant from the 'Shraddha' days and had very intimate relation with Prince Bhai. The price isn't too high considering the food quality. I should definitely recommend everyone to give it a visit.

Being conveniently located in the heart of the city near Park Circus; this double-storeyed air conditioned restaurant Charcoal Grill offers a multi-cuisine fare of Indian, Tandoori and Chinese food.A separate take-away counter and affordable pricing also contribute to their popularity.

Had an unique & pleasant dining experience as first timers, we happened to be here for our dinner on maha shaptami 2013. As we( in group of 7) were in central Kolkata , looking for food & liquor under the same roof  as well  trying to avoid the Park street/china town rush, walked into CG that is just 100 metres off Park Circus seven point crossing (thank you zomato for your wonderfull android app) .They confirm telephone reservations even during the festive hours - impressive! From outside, The facade is garish yet eyecatching with an artificial cascade of shimmering lights. Coming to interiors ,the reception desk leading to the waiting area downstairs having couple of smushiest couches; the restaurant has good enough space utilizing it in two levels (we got our table upstairs).The decor is quite sublime with wooden tables, brown leathery sofas and cushioned chairs, neat and clean cutleries & folded napkin cloth on tables & soothing lightings-- all imparting great,and indeed a top scale ambience; the biggest plus is the dining(sitting) arrangement - it was truly cozy which made us more comfortable to enjoy the food!
 
The menu card filled with multi-cuisine varieties of dishes offer something for everybody, to have their own choice of food.Much known for its sea food to which few of our mates were allergic ; we alternatively opted for some mouthwatering preparations from North-Western frontier and Chinese menu.To begin with , we decided to savour some chinese starters along with a PITCHER of draught beer , which were -
 > LAT ME KAI - spot on! the plate had 8 diced boneless chicken-- deep fried & sauteed with spring onion, celery, green chilli and other condiments and finally stir fried with white wine imparting its distict taste and crispiness.we were deperately hungry & wolfed down most of it within a minute of it being put on table!
> CHICKEN IN FIRE SAUCE - each of these were like chicken wings -on steroids ! The strips of chicken breast (threaded on bamboo skewers)  were packed with so much flavours that made our mouth jump for joy! the hot sauce with the mixture of herbs & spices was truely a great temptation to the tongue, here to add on , the chicken was juicy & tender, in short -  grilled to perfection!
> CHILLI HONEY CRISPY CHICKEN -deep fried chicken bits glazed in lemon tinged,sweet-chilli honey sauce , teasing our taste buds with such sweet & spicy combination of flavours-- typical of the oriental cuisine.Persons lacking sweet tooth might fail to appreciate it. 
Each of the starters were priced at about Rs 225( just to make out an idea about the hiked up prices, as the menu in zomato needs to be upgraded)

For  the main course, our eyes went wandering over the indian pages of the menu booklet & we picked up - CHICKEN BHARTA ( mashed chicken simmered in spicy gravy , over it a smoky flavour with a distinct charcoal smell made it truely awesome) ; KEEMA MATTAR (mutton mince & green peas cooked with spices). Both these dishes were great accompaniments with TANDOORI NAN (5 servings) which were crisp at the bottom & soft and fluffy on top as they should be. The rest two of us ordered for JEERA RICE (cumin flavoured boiled rice lightly punched with whole spices, in serving portion of atleast 3 people , was delectable in its aroma and flavours). A 2nd round of  pitcher of daught beer accompainied  this time as well .

All dishes were innovatively cooked up without compromising on preserving the richness of the tastes. In a large group ,the north Indian dishes were just able to cut the ice, where as the chinese ones were really surprising, better than even some uptown  chinese joints. They have a good sense of food presentation, more importantly the quality of food is upto the standard & really  doesnâ€™t disappoint us.The prices which looks like little expensive becomes affordable at which the food is served in terms of Q2 (Quality & Quantity), its very affordable for group dining especially owing to the generous portions.

The service was courteous but tad slow specially while preparing the starters.The Staff needs to be more attentive & prompt as I found them a bit snooty ( might be in order to handle the puja rush- 0.5 deduction for that) but yes , brownie points for confirming reservations,proper management and maintaining the standard of food even during rush hours of the durga puja days.
By the end of this sinful evening, having chewed way more than we could digest, we had to shell out about 3.4 k for 7 adults including the two pitchers of beer.pocket pinch was fair enough!

With a rating of 4.5, I recommend CG to everyone who is from Kolkata or coming for a visit , specially to people in a non-experimental mood , for families , friends & corporates seeking a diverse range of menu ,upscale ambience and bearable prices - CG is too good a place worthy trying!

My visit to Charcoal Grill was quite pleasant!
I ordered Fried Bombay Duck as a starter,it was yum!
The service was very quick however the waiters didn't seem that confident.

In the Main course I ordered Chicken Chattinad and Neer Dosa.
Neer dosa was soft and paper thin,i had it for the first time and loved it!
The Chicken Chettinad was yum too,the chicken pieces were super soft.

I'm giving it 3.5 based on their quick service and tasty food.
I'd love to go there again and try out crab!

Charcoal Grill is another perfect place to relish the exquisite taste of sea-foods. Located near the Park Circus, the restaurant serves a wide range of coastal preparations of marvelous flavour. We had the Seafood Platter and the Squid Koliwada as for the starter. They contained fried squid, prawn and fish items; tasted really great. Though, I would suggest, Squid Butter Pepper Garlic would also be a very good option. As for the main course, the combination of Seafood Fried Rice and Chicken Xacuti was heavenly great! I can give this place another visit only for these two items. We also had a Shredded Lamb preparation, knowing well that it won't go along with that rice. Anyway, it was a personal choice, and a standard tasted dish. 

The place has a variety of cocktails too. I took a vodka Martini in cranberry juice and it was excellently flavoured. The gin-based cocktails were also good.

Well every good place, unfortunately, has some cons, and Charcoal Grill is no exception! The food may be excellent, but the service is poor. We ordered oyster and a clams preparation; both were unavailable. The men were too slow; your starter might just get digested before you start with your main course! Lastly, the decorum does not go well with the cuisine. The ambiance is a complete dud and only your friends' presence can make it a bit lively. So go there only for a few delicious and fabulous seafood platters and fewer excellent cocktails, and nothing else.

Although it has been at a walking distance from my school, I first tried out Charcoal Grill after school was over, for a date.
I was certainly not let down.
The decor and colour of the walls gives it a touch of sobre semi-darkness that I liked.
We tried the lunch buffet, and I have to say that there was certainly much more variety than restaurants like Haka. The different gravies tasted actually different, which I find missing in a lot of Chinese places. Also, their fresh lime soda had a perfect zing about it. 
The price isn't too high considering the food quality. I should definitely want to give it a visit some time soon again.

FOOD THAT IS DELICIOUS AND DIVINE!

This restaurant, located near Park Circus, is the place to go in order to have a wonderful lunch and dinner with your family. The menu is extensive and exhaustive with varied dishes on offer for everyone who decides to have their meal here. You will definitely be spoilt for choice here. The effort to provide a unique dining experience is simply commendable. I am always thrilled at the prospect of having a meal at the restaurant. As I have said before, they provide elaborate Coastal, Chinese and North Indian options. 

As much as I can manage, I always have a little of everything on offer there. There are certain items that I simply love to have and cannot refrain myself from ordering for them every time that I am there. This time was no different; from the Indian section I simply demolished the delicious starters I ordered, namely their Tandoori Potato and the Spinach Paneer Roll. For the main course, I happily consumed the following: Tandoori Chicken, Fish Tikka and Mutton Seekh kebabs. The other kebabs that I wish to have the next time I am there are Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Prawn Tikka and Fish Peshawari. Even ordered (my not so favourite dish) Palak Paneer and had it with Nan. Being in a large group, we just couldn't leave without having some comfort food from their coastal section namely Prawn Koliwada, King Fish Fry and Fish Hariyali. After having so much I was still raring to go, so we ordered Golden Fried Prawns, Buttered Prawn and Lat Me Kai.

Having been a regular at charcoal grill for over three years now, I can safely say that their standard of food and service has remained much the same. The service is prompt and efficient and the servers are well mannered. The prices at which the food is available are affordable in terms of the quality and quantity.

I have been to Charcoal Grill several times and I have had a pleasant experience every time. Firstly because they offer a lot of things up on the menu, and whatever they serve are nice! The first time I had visited i had they Special sea food Chelo platter, and it was very nice. The second time I had plain chinese, with noodles, and rice and chicken, which also i loved. The only thing I have noticed is that they don't have Thai soup on their menu. I personally Love their Kung pao chicken and Hunan chicken! 
Nicely decorated place, Nice service. Visit especially for the sea food! You'll Love I swear! Enjoy :)

Well it took us a long time to find a place where good food was served and one could chill. Ambience is very good. The lights are just perfect inside.
I have been going there since August 2012. Whenever I am in Kolkata we end up going there very often. The staff is perfect, food is excellent. The owner is very humble and friendly.
Price is very pocket friendly.
I would recommend Charcoal Grill to every one who is in Kolkata or is for a visit.
If you like spicy then one should try Prawn Banjara and oder as spicy as possible. Try out the fish finger and loads of other things to try.

Visited this place days ago. this place is a good option for kebab lovers. food quality is very good so as the ambiance. the staffs are well behaved and service is good enough, but the pocket pinch is in the high side thats a bad part about this restro.

Charcoal Grill is another perfect restaurant to have north indian and chinese food...at least i love these cuisines there. Prawn Koliwada and king fish fry is extremely tasty and good for starters. 
Fish Hariyali is my most favourite. Ambience is nice and staff is polite. 
For chinese, Golden Fried Prawns, Buttered Prawn and Chicken Lat Me Kai are great. Prices are affordable and quantity is appropriate for 2 to 3 people.
Overall a good restaurant. 
3.5 from me.

Location - Very easy to spot. Right near park circus. The road along the entrance was dirty when I visited.
Reason of Visit - I have a desire of eating all types of animals I can eat legally. I remembered one day that I hadn't tried sea animals much! Searched zomato and found this and was interested after seeing the menu.
Atmosphere - It was empty at 4 am. the atmosphere was highly dull. the room not spacious. I thought i would compensate with new type of good food.

Order - I ordered the main attraction seafood platter. It officially was to have King Fish, Bombay Duck, Prawn, Squid. But sadly neither the Bombay Duck nor King Fish was available. But the one thing I liked is that they agreed to assort their Master Dish on my request. Together with this and other order, I had Clam (which tasted really moist and succulent), two types of Squid preparation, Bhetki. But the most I liked was the Prawn cooked with Capsicum and had an awesome taste.

Conclusion - If you want to brag having eaten different types of animals, then this is it. Neither the food or the atmosphere is very good. But on the whole it is a nice package and has good potential.

Was at Charcoal Grill this Saturday, my second time there and I must say that I was a bit disappointed. As soon as we entered the 1st floor there was a strange smell and when we questioned it, we found out that it was because the air-con was switched off.

Charcoal Grill has a wonderful array of starters and their Tandoori Chickens and Paneer tikkas and Fish starters / kababs are wonderful. But the main course we ordered that day (Indian) was average. Nothing out of the world. My friends who are regulars there complained about the Palak Paneer (3rd time in a row they said) - it was not how it usually was they said. On complaining it was replaced to somewhat like the original.

The waiters were kind of unprepared and not perfect. But the worst hindrance to what could have been a nice evening were these children running around and screaming. I know this is nothing that the restaurant was directly responsible for, but somehow the people coming in there are not the people with whom you would want to spend this kind of money to dine with.

Please hear the feedbck from a resident of Park Circus.
I started visiting this restaurant from the old 'SHRADDHA' days and seriously , a lot had changed. I still visit CG with my family in the evenings and more often than not we are the first guests on the 1st floor. There is a mrked difference in AC intensity as well as the knowledge of the waiters on the 1st floor , for the better ! I wonder why , though ! !
As far as food is concerned , they still serve some of the best kababs and indian dishes like - Chicken Side dishes and Veg side dishes. Even Chinese fried rice ,  gravy chowmein is also good.
But , with the increase in service tax and food cost , unfirtunately , CG has become a bit expensive nowadays.

Had Dinner at Charcoal Grill on Saturday night. We ordered Tandoori Chicken was good to taste. Our second order for Fish Tikka was pretty disappointing as the fish pieces were pretty small. For the price they are charging, we expected better portion. We then ordered for Mutton Seekh Kebab which was very bad. 

Overall I will not give too many points for food.

Service though was excellent and to the mark. The staff were attentive and paid attention to the details.

We went to this place on Astami Night. The ambiance was decent, food was tasty & the waiters were courteous.
The only negetive thing I can mention is that I found a rice-bug in my biriyani dish. However, they provided a good compensation when we complained to them.

Overall, a nice experience.

Charcoal Grill.. It is located on Park Circus.. This place boasts a multi-cuisine menu which seems to have some thing for everyone, the restaurant makes an amazing effort to provide an authentic taste for each of the items on the offing. The ambiance is okayish.. The Pindi Chholey is worth the order and Indian Breads are really nice. The starters are also worth a mention. It is very pocket friendly too. Go for having North Indian main course and for Non-Vegetarians, I've heard it serves great sea food.
Three stars from me.

i went to this restaurant twice...once we took the seafood in the evening...it was  delicious.... along with a south indian chicken item...which i tried for the first time...with this expectation i went for the 2nd time with my girlfriend and a friend of mine to take a lunch...the ambience was great as like i saw earlier..food was good and tasty until a COCKROACH came to our table...which was certainly not expected in this type of place...though the attendants were cordial and suggested us to change the table immediately...but again im saying i will think twice to go to this restaurant...

Today went to charcoal grill, as it was 3 pm in the afternoon most of the tables were empty, we got good seats, ambience was good,dimly lit, the waiters were not that attentive, we had to ask three times to take the order before they actually did, after 20 mins foods arrived, we mainly ordered chinese items, fried rice, sliced fish in mustard, devils chicken,prawn in garlic sauce everything were delicious & fresh.. liked the food very much.. little expensive but as long as they will serve such good food the price wont be a factor!

This is a brilliant place to try out new stuff. Also the seating is plenty and you'll not have to wait, unless its some special occasion. Crab Meat in Garlic and Butter Sauce is epic. Must have. They have very good indian food too, as well as good kebabs. thumbs up!

Arey, this is one of my all time favorites. I've been going here for the past 6-7 years now, maybe more. one of the best things about being a regular is that assuredly you will get excellent service which these people have provided me, every single time! 
even for a new-comer (read: walk-in), they are equally courteous. 
this restaurant is quite, quite spacious. Gr.flr + 1st floor.
even after that, most of the weekends, you'll have to wait for a table (especially if there's a big group visiting) because of the rush.
Valet parking is a big, big plus. 
FOOD:
great selection of food from the menu available. if you are a sea-food lover, there's a whole lot of coastal veg. & sea-food to choose from, apart from the already-elaborate indian & chinese options.
their paneer-spinach roll is one of my all-time favorites for starters, as well as tandoori aloo. crispy chilli paneer (dry) is another item worth trying. 

the main course for both Indian & chinese cuisines are all excellent. 
Egg-Curry (if you request while ordering, ask them to make the grave a bit thick), is also quite nice. 
all-in-all, a great, must-visit place.
One another great thing about this restaurant is is location. neither too far away from North Or South Kolkata. 
my favorite part of he restaurant is 'everything' about it. 
love this place.

when at charcoal grill go for their crab and prawn items. as good as it gets the crab and prawn items are sure to satisfy your palate. if you have typical bong taste buds go for chinese or indian cuisine as the sea food items specially the rice is a bit too tangy

This place is a must visit for all food lovers. Boasting a multi-cuisine menu, the restaurant makes an amazing effort to provide an authentic taste for each of the items on the offing. The kerala mutton dry/ stew are a must try with the appams. The egg- wrapped fried rice is worth the order and the crabs are awesome ( though, it gets a bit cumbersome to handle them,at times) . But nevertheless they are worth the effort. The chicken xacuti is also worth a mention. So, donot think twice, u wudn b disappointed, seriously.
