Ordered for a Masala Dosa and Vada from this place. Both the items tasted good. The dosa's size was bigger thsn the average size you get. Overall, its nice and pocket-friendly too.

It is a road side eatery located sector 1, saltlake. They serve good south indian foods in a reasonable price. 

Zero ambiance, proper seating arrangement was not there. Tried butter onion cheese dosa. Service  was fast and taste was good. Good place for quick bite.

This streetside food joint  is located at Sector 1, Salt Lake. It mainly serves quickbites at an economical price.

Ambience is shabby .

Service is quick .

Tried their masala dosa & idli, which were average though price is economical.

Not at all satisfied. 
A place named with dosa and not making good dosa is the worst thing you can have.
I had once a somewhat nice onion dosa.
But all other instances were bad, bad and bad.

This place opens up at 10AM.
There's nothing GREAT about their dosas but if you wanna show up their with your family on a sunday morning, you might just NOT get disappointed. I quite like the Cheese dosa and idlis and vadas.

Our morning breakfast on Sundays used to be from this shop. They had started out as an only south Indian shop, now have moved on to biriyani and other items! The prices are reasonable and they have home delivery options as well.

Dosas are not that good. Just eatable. Barely have I bought their dosas. Not a good place to try out dosas. People who are just trying out something new would perhaps try their stuff, but someone who has eaten once would give it a miss a second time.

For an area, which is mostly known for a hotel dealing with Indian and Chinese, it is tough to come up with a successful business. I happen to visit EC Market many-a-times, mainly to pick up stuffs from Aahar and evidently I get to come here quite often as well.

This is basically a road side stall situated by the walls of the market. If you know the middle gate to the market (There are 3 entrances to the market), you shouldn't have any problem locating this. The sitting area is small and comprises of few tables and chairs. Since, this is a Non-AC joint, you are bound to have hygiene issues as well as suffer from the scorching heat and humidity in the summer.

If one goes through their menu list, one wouldn't say that their pricing is cheap! Instead it is almost at par with some superior shops like Bhikharam's or Haldirams. Although, the quality they offer is below par! I have tried Dosas here a couple of times and mostly they were disappointing. The Masala filling, inside the Masala Dosa, wasn't exactly tasty. The Chutney lacks flavor as well. Had packed their Special Dosa once, and it was a sheer disaster. Absolutely no indication as to why one should regard the Dosa to be 'special'. Other than probably it may have been cooked in space and parceled back to Earth, something to which I may not be aware off!

The only thing good here, according to me is their Sambhar. Although, this place doesn't pack a hole in your pocket, I would rather make my way to the nearby Bhikharam rather than come here and eat in the circumstances described above!
