Bho E Bhojan is a true Kolkata Style Food Provider... Very Good Tasty food in very very good price range. Very good for students like us staying in hostels and looking for tasty food here and there. Thanks to Bho E Bhojan, we are now know where to place the order. Idli Bada to Momo Chili Chicken, Biriyani kabab paratha... awesome... best part is they are also serving with bengali home made food...
Their deluvery is little slow ,but we get freshly cooked food and thats the Best Part of them....
All the best Bho E Bhojan... u guys are rocking. ....

but after all still rating 3.5 which is good!

Delicious food at affordable rates.Impressed with the service. Checked that some of the items though available at restaurant menu, but not available online.Would be really beneficial for online orderers if all the items are available online especially chicken lollipop and paneer dishes.Also paratha could be valuable addition to your menu.

Had chicken momo few minutes ago nd couldn't resist myself from giving review. Clean nd small outlet which is really very pocket friendly. They serve 6 pieces of momo with nice stuffing nd a big bowl of soup. I took a takeaway nd i think it's a good outlet in our locality. Would like to taste their other dishes.

A Small Neat & Clean Take Away Counter with a big kitchen behind, providing mouth watering Chinese food at a very low cost. The Momo and the Soup was awesome as well as the Hakka Shezwan Noodles. They are also serving north indian dishes which i plan to taste again sometime.
