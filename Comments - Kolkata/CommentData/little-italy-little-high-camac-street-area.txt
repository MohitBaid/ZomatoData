Average best described my experience at Little Italy because I had heard good things about the food. The Garlic Bread we ordered was ice cold which was not the greatest way to start the meal. Next we ordered the Cheese Fondue which was like I said earlier was at best average but not great. Hopefully they were just having an off day and I hope a future visit will be a more positive experience.

I'm a big fan of the Little Italy chain and was an absolute lover of its outlets in Bangalore. The one in Kolkata is pretty disappointing though. The ambience is dull and pizzas were mostly bland. Most of the desserts weren't even available, and the caramel custard I had was decent (it was the best thing I had among everything I had ordered though).

It has been said and i reiterate that they serve amazing food. Mind-blowing italian and also mexican. Super place for your taste bud fulfillment. From the point of view of food you will never regret being here. It is a heaven for food lovers. Service is also good. Cost is also good and in your limits.

What puts you back is the decor and restaurant itself and also the place where it is situated. All have lost their glamour and charm. Look so shabby and worn out. For once you will think you might have come to the wrong place.

But for the side of food you should be here. Although everything is awesome you should especially try for the nachos dish.

Compared to the outlet in Bangalore,  the food quality was bad.  The taste of their pasta was definitely not up to the mark. Their quantity was too little,  so the items seemed overpriced. Definitely would not recommend it.  Try their Bangalore outlet instead!

One of the most expensive Birthday treats to my School friends. 

However the impeccable interior, the fine dining experience, the difficult to pronounce names, the awe at the ease with with each staff member would pronounce each dish, just by telling them the code name. 

I should point out, that it would be the best restaurant for a romantic evening..Slow music, A beautiful view, luscious interiors and the gig. 

The whole package you get once you enter the restaurant is worth the penny.The service are patient to guide you through the menu and give you the better suggestions. The food is too point and flavorful. It respects the subtleness of the Italians. 

In case you go there during the holidays, I would highly recommend to get a reservations done. ( JIO, pointless being frugal) .

We came here with high expectations, taste and service stood the test. The ambience is soothing so is the music. Nevertheless the quantity was disappointing.. Ordered for 7 got more than enough for 3.. Had to supplement our dinner.. Good market strategy though.. Got business for 2 restaurants instead of 1.. Next time you ever drive by camac street try something else!! ! Kudos!! 😊

One of the best joints in kolkata serving vegetarian food like no other place does. The hype for non vegetarian food in Kolkata will never cease to grow. Amongst the various Non veg joints here, a handful of vegetarian eateries have sprung up. The little Italy is one of those eateries which can give the carnivorous world a run for its money.
From fresh baked farmer's bread to hand tossed pizza the food here screams of Italy in every bite.
From Fusilli to penne the pastas here are absolutely lip smacking.
I would take a special mention of the salads which are of good taste and vigor.

The food here was excellent. One of the best Raviolis that I've had in Calcutta, for sure. 
However, really disappointed by the 'feel' of the restaurant. Agreed, we came in pretty early, but it was surprising that they had no staff. We were being served our food by the security there, and the person managing the restaurant looked like he had just woken up with unruly hair and not tucked in shirt. 
Not the ideal scenario for a lunch date, that's for sure.

A great place to have Italian food amidst a very spacious ambience and soft music with endless conversations. Really liked the place much and recommend it to everyone. Although it's completely vegetarian but definitely worth a visit especially to try the Asparagus soup, the fresh Salads, awesome Pasta and the amazing wood fired pizzas that will make you want more. The Chocolate Bomb is also a sinful delight that must be had after your meal to end a great dinner with your loved ones.

One of the best Italian places in town and which has always been on my top list. Went on new year Eve with friends. The best part was we got reservation. We ordered the mushroom soup which I feel is the best in town. The brocoli soup was okay, can be skipped. We then ordered a pizza, mixed sauce ravioli and another dish which is off menu and was suggested by the waiter. The Fire and Ice drink is absolutely great. Overall it is a fantastic place.

Went to this place on New Year's Eve. Lovely ambience, very fine dining. The staff was polite and courteous and helpful. A little suggestion, if it's your first time here, then take the help of the staff as the menu is pretty extensive. So we started with the broccoli soup and the mushroom soup. Broccoli soup was pretty good, but the mushroom soup was just to die for- highly recommend. Then we tried the spinaci salsa accompanied by breads, the salsa itself was creamy and well made and the breads were crisp. We also had the tortellini which also pretty good. The mixed sauce ravioli and the rustic pizza kind of reaffirmated the fact that is one of the leading Italian restaurants of the city. All an all, a paradise for vegetarian Italian food lovers.

I went here only a few days back. Since the time it has opened , I've loved having their ravioli, garlic bread and bruschetta. Everything here is cooked well. However , this time the quality of food had gone way down. The food served was cold, the staff was not attentive and the taste had gone bland. Must be one of the bad days restaurants face. However , it's a good place for Italian food. Do try the chocolate bomb in the end.

A good Italian restaurant. It has still maintained its quality. Pocket pinch is on a higher side but worth it. We had a cheese fondue quantity was really too good for two people and croutons, veggies and fondue were amazing. Than we had ordered pizza which was not great and hair in it too so was replaced by ali olio pasta which again tasted good. Best part was the dessert- chocolate bomb it was amazingly filled with chocolate. Great feast

My fetish for Italian food landed me here! So I  ordered for  Crostini Vesuvio, Pale di potato, pita bread with hummus, lasagne, special tacos, Nachos, etc etc. The Crostini and marinated potato were particularly yum in taste. The Nachos with refried beans were disappointing. Ending the meal with a Chocolate bomb was a wise decision. The place needs to improve on the serving staff.

Pros- Food was quite good. I had the best mushroom soup ever. Ambience is also good. 
Cons- music in the background was missing. Also it is easily overpriced and waiters are not well trained. Some pointers to work on and it will become the best Italian resto.

This used to be one of my favorite places in town. But sadly it has deteriorated a lot. Worst thing was the service. Earlier they would never have any qualms about customizing a dish, but now the manager, blatantly refuses, and that too quite rudely. Plus they bought us our main course before the starters. I would like do ask there management where did they learn that? 
And coming to the food, the taste has completely gone to the dogs. I fail to understand how it could have deteriorated so much. I doubt if I would go back.

First of all i have to admit tht im a hardcore non vegetarian, and i really donot visit veg restaurants. The only exception being little italy. 
I have been to their restaurant in hyderabad as well, and have been in love with their food. 
We ordered the assorted crostini and caprese salad. Both of the starters were nice and worth trying. 
For main course we opted for the pasta barbaresca. The pasta is awesome and every time i visit little italy i order it. 
The place is costly and the quantity isnt huge, compared to the prices they charge.

One of the best places for Italian delicacies. Being located on the 8th floor, the view is amazing. It has a huge menu list and it becomes tough to choose as everything seems mouth-watering. In starters, we had ordered Stuffed Mushroom, which is a delight for mushroom lovers. Next we ordered Crema Di Funghi and Zuppa Di Broccoli. I liked the former one. Main course constituted Pizza Alla Vodka, and pasta in white sauce. It was so amazing that we were totally satisfied. And in the end, being the cherry on the cake was the Chocolate Bomb ! The liquid chocolate just cracked open my whole mind.
Overall it was a delightful experience. 
Only 'but' thing is that it's a bit overpriced. But after dining, it seems worth it.

If you want to enjoy an eve with your loved one in a calm and relaxing place, then this is the right place. Amazing place with sober ambience to enjoy different Italian dishes, etc. Varieties of Pizza are amazing, specially the 'Nawabi Pizza'. The thin crust which they provide, no one can provide better in Kolkata(that is what I feel).

Apart from the Pizza, other dishes are also good...even the complimentary Nachos they provide during the whole time you are there is also very tasty. 

Either friends or family...you can enjoy this place with anyone. Keep it up! :)

Little Italy has lost its charm because of the new restaurants opening every now and then in Kolkata. You can cross this place every day and yet not notice it's existence. I recently went there for an office lunch. After visiting the other restaurants in the city you would definitely consider this ambience as dull and boring. Anyways talking about the food. Starters were very good,  especially the stuffed mushrooms. Nachos were decent too. In the main course I did not like the pasta. It was very very ordinary and one could cook a better pasta at home. Overall an average experience.

Interiors not as good as it's been portrayed. Price is very high also the quantity served is not sufficient compared to the price charged. Nothing too extraordinary.. We ordered Mexican sizzler. It was nothing extraordinary. Overall you will get better restrauntants in that area with lower prices... better quantity.

Little Italy has lost its charm because of the new restaurants opening every now and then in Kolkata. You can cross this place every day and yet not notice it's existence. I recently went there for an office lunch. After visiting the other restaurants in the city you would definitely consider this ambience as dull and boring. Anyways talking about the food. Starters were very good,  especially the stuffed mushrooms. Nachos were decent too. In the main course I did not like the pasta. It was very very ordinary and one could cook a better pasta at home. Overall an average experience.

Interiors not as good as it's been portrayed. Price is very high also the quantity served is not sufficient compared to the price charged. Nothing too extraordinary.. We ordered Mexican sizzler. It was nothing extraordinary. Overall you will get better restrauntants in that area with lower prices... better quantity.

This place has been there for a while in Kolkata. Before my visit last week, I had been to this place a while back and remembered it to be very popular and always full. However, went on a Saturday very recently and found the place to be empty. This made me apprehensive but we were quite a few of us and had booked a table.

I didnt get to taste much but the pizzas were decent and the mixed sauce pasta was good. The risotto was also decent. Food was not awesome but was good. I think they need a face lift and need to make the ambience more lively.

The name itself was framed with a big "pun intended" I guess! Little Italy wasn't little too high but wayyyyy tooooo high-ly priced!! Four of us,four dishes ordered and the bill came for "4000(+ tax)! The hole in my friend's pocket was too big i guess after this expensive 'little' treat at LITTLE Italy! The ambience is fine but the chairs are uncomfortable and the sofa sinks in!How can someone possibly eat!!
Coming to the food..we hardly had any 'coz the prices gave us small bouts of attacks! But then there were two things which were actually worth the price we paid! One was the soup, Zuppa Di Asparagus..very fresh and creamy! It was the first time I had tasted asparagus and I was surely impressed and satisfied! And the best(or the bestest) was the dessert..Chocolate Bomb! It really brings back your adrenaline rush which by the end of the meal may have seemed a distant memory!!! The pasta,pizza,lasagna was nothing extraordinary (giving authentic Italian names doesn't really make it taste better!) but  their services is horribly slow,the portions too small even for a girl who's on diet(!)and added to such prices your stomach waves a goodbye to hunger! 
I have given one extra mark just for the dessert as I actually visited heaven when I had it! But overall there are better Italian restaurants in that area with better food,better portions and sober prices!

Ambience was nice......  Food was so so..  Loved the zigana salad, very healthy and refreshing. The white sauce pasta was nice...  Now comes the sad part,  lasagne was runny, red sauce pasta was so so and so was th e pizza.  
Hopefully they try and improve the taste of the food..  All in all Ok experience.

One of the good Italian joints!! Nice ambience, great food but yes a high pocket pinch!! But it's worth! Had ordered for pale di potato which is crispy potato skins with spices, and fungi trifolati, which is sautéed mushrooms, for starters. Both were outstanding and so was the nachos with cheese sauce. Had ordered for a simple margarita pizza and asparagus risotto for the main course. The pizza was one of the best I ever had but the risotto was quite disappointing!! 
Overall a great experience and I can visit time n again for the potato starter!!

For Pizza n Pasta lovers this authentic Italian food station is a must visit place. For pasta,pizza n authentic Italian soup....rating 10 on 10 as its d best Italian food counter in Kolkata. We took Zuppa Di Broccoli(an authentic Italian soup with broccoli n cheese), Pizza melino( traditional pizza bread imported from Milan), Lasagna Alla Napoletana wid bechamal sauce n riccotta cheese(a kind of pasta), Risotto 4 formaggi(arborio rice wid 4 different types of cheese) n Beans Tacos n of course hot coffee. May it be a bar come restaurant,but anywhere I don't like to booze at all. All cheese lovers must take Risotto 4 formaggi as u ll feel all different types of cheese's taste. Awesome experience here. But don't visit after 8pm,its overcrowded place then,u can't enjoy the ambience n beautiful decoration for which I would rate 7 on 10. But yes....all pockets of ur jackets n pants must b full, u ve to pay a handful of money for the best Italian food.

I am 11 years old. I went to the dessert menu, on the top there was a tiramisu so I ordered it...When I ate the first bite, I realised that there was something alcoholic in it... I made my dad and Mom taste it... They also got the same taste... We called for the menu again and it was written that it was soaked in rum... I only ordered the tiramisu and the waiter came and put it in front of me... How can the give an 11 year old boy a tiramisu soaked in rum???
I also realised that the waiters were not interested in serving the people... We had a Groupon voucher with us and when we showed it to him he is asking us 'Do you even know what is there in the offer'..... The pizza we ordered was very bad, I think it was stale. The parmesan cheese was also stale... The cheese fondue had a cockroach. I would prefer do not go there at any cost.

This place in Fort Knox is a sheer delight for all the vegetarians. Food service ambience everything is ek number.

Some of the highlights :
A58, ...... a broccoli on a piece of toast. You can make it in your home it's that simple. But the only thing that makes this item tempting n the menu is the spicy, tangy, tasty sauce that they give with it.

Z.3......mushroom soup... I don't eat mushrooms, but my friends liked it.

We also ordered P33 (pizza), Spaghetti and B51 (pasta) . They were amazing.

P.S.- make your friend treat you in this restaurant (that's what I did :P) or else you'll end up spending a good amount of your pocket money over a meal.

Date of Visit : 23/09/2015 (Lunch)
Location : Fort Knox Building, 8th floor.
Cuisine : Italian - Pure veg
Decor : Excellent
Seating Arrangement : Very Good
Staffs : Staffs are well trained and had smile thoughout.
Service : Service was prompt though the restuarant was almost empty on that day. The staffs told us the waiting time for dishes which may take time.
Offer : We took groupon offer. Offer included 2 soups, 1 Starter, 1 Main Course, 1 Desert & 2 Fresh Lime Soda for Rs. 899/- for two person.
Food Ordered :
Soup - 
1. Minestrone
2. Crema Di Funghi (Cream of mushroom)

3. Mixed Sauce Pasta (Dont remember the name, all names are so complicated)

Deserts :

2. Mango Cheese Cake

Taste : All soup tasted good. Cream of brocolli & cream of mushroom were exceptionally good. Both the starters were excellent. Supremo Garlic bread was different as most of the restaurants serve it in sliced bread form but they served in bun form. So loved it. Main Course was little disappointing, pizza was excellent but pasta & lasagne were average.  In deserts, chocolate bomb in a must try. Mango cheese cake was average.  

Overall the experience was good. But it was not satisfactory.
Pocket Pinch : 899 per two person (Groupon Offer)

Food is good ..Especially for vegetarians.. The service is average and cleanliness is negative there .. The couch was smelling and so was the lobby and lift.. Very big put off was the mosquitos and table flies hovering around my cheese and food.. Found it extremely irritating and unsanitary... Nachos is top notch! The chocolate bomb has become half in its height lol
Paprika pasta was not at all good but they changed it on request.

An excellent ambience..brilliant service. The broccoli soup was not good. Fondue with vegetables was also not at par. There was too much oil in d vegetables.
But the main course Nawabi Pizza with thin crust was simply outstanding. The fresh lime was really very very well made. I am really particular about my fresh lime.
And the desert which gave me orgasm was the Chocolate Bomb. The ratings would have been average if it was not for the Choclate bomb. It was just " Oh My God".

Shitty, Crappy & Ball-sy to charge such exorbitant rates for dishing out utter trash ! 
Got excited to visit the place after seeing a varied menu of 'exotic sounding dishes'. OMG. Nightmarish Sunday it turned out for us. Stuffed mushroom starter dripping in oil. (Sickening) Thin crust pizza again had oil dripping all over. And this took the mickey.....a lasagna dish - half baked, consistency more of a gravy rich subzi, with ONLY paneer pieces in it- mind u, paneer was nowhere mentioned on the menu card as one of the dish ingredients. 
Service standards atrocious & preposterous !! 
Forget about ratings, this place deserves to be closed down & cannot b allowed to fool any more people. 
ZOMATO - can u do sumthing about these thief restaurants ??

I would give this place zero ratings if i could. Went there on a sunday afternoon. Around 3 pm. For a supposedly high end restaurant there was no one to receive guests at the entrance and we had to find our own way to an empty table. Was told by the incharge mr james that since the kitchen will close soon. Pls order everything at once. So we ordered a mushroom starter. Sicilian pizza. And lasagna. The starter was unbelievably awful. Dripping in oil with absolutely no taste or aroma. We actually had to drown it in sauce to swallow it down. Also by that time we had asked for some ice for our water thrice with no response. Completely irritated we called mr james again and requested to cancel the main course. But he said its not possible as the foods already prepared. 15 minutes after that the pizza arrived. Which mr james decided to serve on the dirty starter plates. My friend corrected him so he went to get new plates. Again. The pizza was greasy and again. Absolutely no taste. Plus cold. For something which was supposedly prepared and coming fresh out of the kitchen. The "lasagna" had only chunks of indian paneer in it. In cheesy white sauce. The paneer pieces  were chewy. And the sauce runny and uncooked unlike what the base of a lasagna is supposed to look like. By this point we had reached our limit of endurance. Mr james said this is how its cooked. We demanded to meet the manager. Mr james took the plate of lasagna and said he's going to show it to him. But came back 5 minutes later saying the manager is not in the restaurant. Which was obviously a lie. Eventually we argued for another half an hour or so. After which we only paid for the starter and drinks. Frankly even that was not worth it. But since we had consumed those two did the decent thing and paid for it. However not only was the food horrible. The servers and mr james were rude and further spoilt our mood. Thanks for nothing.  Another thing i would like to add is. The cocktails and drinks are way overpriced in this place as compared to other high end restaurants. Glad we didnt try that

We bought a Groupon Voucher from internet. We made a reservation call wherein staff asked whether we had a Groupon Voucher. The reservation was took politely at the time we asked for.

On arrival we were seated to the table of our choice. We announced that we wished to use our Groupon Voucher.  Staff took the voucher and checked whether it had not been used previously and retained the voucher. 
Host explained us that with that voucher we were entitled to order Two Soups, One Starter, One Main Course, One Desserts and Two Fresh Lime Sodas.

We ordered one Minestrone Soup and One Broccoli Soup for our Soups. The Broccoli Soup was perfect. Minestrone Soup was good but could have been better. The vegetables used were mainly, Brocoli, Cauliflower, Peas, Onions, Beans. Peas were used mainly and the Minestrone Soup had distinct taste of Peas. 

For Starters we were unable to choose as the suggestions were not to our liking. Then Staff suggested that we can order Saute Vegetables from Pasta section as our Starters as the Restaurant consider that as Starter dish also.  Host told that the outlet prepares it mainly in Red wine. We asked that it should be cooked in Olive Oil and not Red Wine. Host himself told that he will get it prepared in less Oil. When the dish was served to us it had huge quantity of Oil. The plates were all greasy, Taste wise the Dish was perfect. The ingredients used for Saute Vegetables consisted of Bell Peppers, Sun dried Tomatoes, Mushroom, Zuchini, Baby Corn, Asparagus with lots of Italian Herbs and spices. The taste was just perfect and it was cooked very well. Other than being somewhat oily no complaints whatsoever.

For the Main Course we ordered Pizza. We had selected Pizza Mellino. Pizza was thin crust pizza. The ingredients consisted of Mozzarella cheese on Tomatao Sauce base alongwith Green and Black Olives, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Onions, Bell Peppers and Jalapeno. There were more olives than all other ingredients combined. The pizza tasted great, it was slightly spicy and one does not need to add extra chili flakes on it. The quantity of Jalapenos could have been higher. The spicy taste came from base sauce and not from Jalapenos. But still it tasted great.

For Dessert section we ordered Sizzling Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream and Hot Chocolate Sauce. It was perfect. 

For Drinks we were served two portions of Fresh Lime Soda Sweet. The drinks were good in taste but presentation could have bee better. The drinks were served with only a slice of lime in it. For better presentation  some fruit slice or a cherry would have given it a nice color. 

Its one place which serves authentic Italian Food and to top it all the places serves pure Vegetarian food. The Groupon deal was worth it and at no time staff were disinterested just because we were using a promotional Voucher. The staffs were friendly and provided right suggestions and served the food in time and also cleared and cleaned the table in time. 

An awesome experience.

This is one of my fav Italian places to go. The chocolate bomb is the best molten chocolate dessert that I've ever had. It's a must try.
Also, the Mexican sizzler is nice and Italian is obviously nice. The masala garlic bread, pizza nawabi pizza, its tomato basil soup, all are classic.

Have been going here for a long time and I realized the place is still consistent when I visited again recently. Yes only veg Italian which is fine for me. My regular order of a margherita pizza, sicialian pizza, masala mafia spaghetti never disappoint anyone. Of course the starters could improve further and the decor needs a bit of work. Decor has to be more inviting and have the Italian fine dining feel. A terrible blue texture paint or wallpaper on one of the walls is defiitely not a pretty sight to look at sitting there!

Little Italy - Well,its a top notch Italian Restaurant located in Camac Street... Ambience and interiors are impressive and sophisticated.. I found it quiet soothing and relaxing ... Waiters are easily approachable & service is quick... 
I tried signature dishes.. Starting from soup.. I tried Asparagus Zuppa and I quiet liked the taste... Flavour was so raw and fresh.. It persisted long... 
Then in Starters I went for Herb Bread Sticks which again was a hit... I just wish that everyday in d evening I get those bread sticks with hot tea... It would make my day...:P .. Breads were crisp with oregano and other spices sprinkled on it .. Along with it they served a Sauce sort of stuff whose main ingredient was Spinach ... 
Then comes Main Course ... I ordered Lasagna which was average to me... The burnt cheese on top was d only thing which I liked in it... 
Dessert made me high again and ddnt let me go without being completely satisfied... It was Choco Bomb... A must try for dessert lovers...
So Little Italy .. definitely worth going ...

Then comes Main Course ... I ordered Lasagna which was average to me... The burnt cheese on top was d only thing which I liked in it... 
Dessert made me high again and ddnt let me go without being completely satisfied... It was Choco Bomb... A must try for dessert lovers...
So Little Italy .. definitely worth going ...

Pure Veg Italian restaurant. Confuses a bit. Been here for a 4 course meal today. Mushroom soup with small pieces of mushroom in it was good. Cheese fondue was OK. Stuffed Mushroom was good and unique. Spaghetti in mix sauce ok. Portion very small. Pizza was excellent with full of mushroom toppings. Chocolate bomb in desserts was a soft shell of chocolate filled with liquid chocolate and a scoop of vanilla icecream. A perfect end to the meal. Pricing otherwise is very expensive. Groupon coupon made worth it. Ambience was sober with comfortable sofas and large table. The Pizza we had was Pavva Rotti, which was thick based, but even that was crisp like a papad, topped with ample yummy cheese and toppings. Service was little slow but good , considering they were serving a full house.

Its an all veg Italian restaurant at the top floor of a building in Camac Street. The view of Kolkata is good. Best part of this Italian place is the Ambiance. Service is OK types though. Its a must go place for anyone who love Pizza but wanna eat in a full service restaurant rather than Pizza Hut or Dominos. May be they come up with a new restaurant which serve non-veg and alcohol too. That will really pick up the profile of this restaurant.

There are a few places in Kolkata where you can't decide what to order nd little Italy I certainly one of them with a wide range of dishes which are equally tempting. With a soothing ambience, this place offers wonderful desserts but I personally found the rest a bit below expectation.

The points are only, and only for the food. 
It's completely vegetation, and yet the options weren't limited. 
The portions were so awfully small, I savoured them to the last morsel because they tasted as good as ambrosia itself. 
Little Italy satiates the heart, but not the tummy(not a bit), while making a deep, deep hole in the pocket. 
I wish to make it more clear, the food is what must be served in heaven, if you are willing to pay with your kidneys. 
The service is very prompt too. They had served the first appetiser even before we could finish our orders. Now, that has never happened before with me. 
The restaurant is situated at the top of a building, in one of the posh areas, so you get a good view of the semi-skyscrapers of the city.
I would recommend this place to all foodies. Just take loads of money, if you want to fill your tummy.

Though a bit on the pricey side, Little Italy offers you both food as well as an experience to remember. I'd ordered Pasta and Lasagna and followed it up with Choco lava cake. Each of them was brilliant. Especially Lasagna, which is a must have over here. The delivery time was a bit on the higher side, but hey good things happen to those who wait ;)

Little Italy is probably one of the best Italian restaurants in the city. It's expensive but makes up for it with its fantastic ambiance and excellent preparations. But beware: Service is Slow and No Non Veg. That's right. The place is purely veg but does serve alcohol.
Anyone new to the place should definitely try out the masala garlic bread for an authentic Italian experience. Also instead of a cheese fondue try the 'spinaci salsa' for your gooey-garlicy-cheese fix. Soups and salads are average but it's the pizzas that are mind blowing. You could literally order any of the hundreds of pizzas that they have and receive a contender for one of the best pizzas in the city. And if you're ever in an adventurous mood try the tortellini pasta which is probably the most unique item of the giant menu. As the manager once told me, 'you can't complete your meal without a chocolate bomb'. But order it early cause they take at least 30 minutes to bake it to perfection. Also try the fire and ice mocktail if you like your food spicy.

I love Little Italy, the restaurant is lovely,  the food is good, the location is perfect, the music is not intrusive, but unfortunately the staff ARE! I don't know what it will take for Indians to learn that people don't like to have groups of idle staff standing around WATCHING THEM EAT. Every time I looked up, someone would run across the room and say "yes ma'am, yes ma'am!!", which they no doubt thought was "service," but which was nothing but irritating. Teach your staff to be less intrusive: it IS possible because I see it elsewhere, but I'm tired of coming in to this place and being treated like I'm some movie theatre screen that everyone can sit around and stare at....

Good food. Sort of Indian-ised Italian Food. Let down by the ambience as the amount one ends up spending is too high in comparison to what you get finally. Runs because its few of the vegan places in the city which are better than the average ones.

Little Italy had never disappointed me and this time around too it lived up to its reputation. The ambience smooth, food delicious as ever and their service "smart". The only down point was that it took us 10-15 minutes to find this place after landing on Camac street, very few signs or hoarding. Definitely a place to hangout be it with you gang or a date!!!

This place was on my radar to visit for a long time primarily coz of the view it offers along with a wide Italian Menu !
Located on the 8th Floor of Fort Knox this place has a very warm and cozy feel.

Coming to the food, Starting with a refreshing Virgin Colada we ordered the D.13 Insalata Di Monti Iblei Salad which i read was supposed to have spring onions but they added the usual red onions (In lots) and thus completely overriding all others with its sharp, astringent and pungent  taste.
Moving on, we tried the Freestate four cheese pizza served with a olive topping which was pretty average.
Thankfully our final dish Barbaresca Spaghetti came to the rescue and ended our meal on a pleasing note. It was creamy, balanced and well cooked.

Overall,  my rating would be :

Ambiance - 3.5/5 Food - 3/5 Service - 5/5 Cost - 3.5/5

This review is going to be sad. 
I don't really know why I hadn't reviewed this place yet. Makes me sad Cus I don't exactly remember what all I ate, by that I mean specific names. 
But hey, at least I remember the taste !! 
As per as I recon, I had pizza which served me GREAT, cus I still remember and I had mocktail. 
I like the service of this place, makes me happy to see how welcoming they are. 
In conclusion, I shall go back here and eat more. But for now you all must try this place out too.

I went there for dinner on the new years eve and the food was excellent. The Aglio Olio Spaghetti Pasta they served was lip-smacking and the pizza was the best I ever had. They are willing to serve one pizza with toppings for 2 different pizzas, which helps foodies like me to try 2 pizzas at the same time.! The ambience of the place is also nice and warm.!
I must say, it actually is the beat Italian restaurant in Kolkata because I've tried most of the popular Italian restaurants in Kolkata but none of them beats it's mark.!

_______________________________

We visited this place again for lunch. Ordered the same Pizza and it was again very great.!
The starters here are not so good.!
The Lasagne was awesome.! 
And the desserts were also very good.!

I was in Kolkata for 2 days and wanted to indulge in the local cuisine. But an acquaintance who is a vegetarian suggested this place for lunch. I was happy because Little Italy in Mumbai is my fav Italian place. My husband and I love their lasagna. I haven't been to the one in Mumbai for 1.5 years so was not aware that their lasagna recipe has changed. 
We ordered a Greek salad which was not bad, veg lasagna, lemon iced tea and broccoli soup. I just had the iced tea and lasagna. The server asked us which lasagne we want- cheese or veg. I went for the former because the one I have eaten does not have veggies. When it was served I realized that by 'cheese' the server meant cottage cheese. I was so disappointed. It does not taste the same. Why have they added 'paneer' to lasagna... what the hell is wrong with this outlet? It is bad enough that they serve only vegetarian Italian food.
And it costs 500 bucks but the quantity is sufficient for only 1 person.
Very disappointed and not visiting Little Italy in any city ever again.

Situated in fort knox in camac street. Quite an office location. And offers excuisite Italian food. 
The interiors are relaxing and soothing . I like it for a quiet dinner or an airy lunch . its a pure veg Italian restaurant which helps vegetarians like us to go with our fussy families;)
The food. A must recommended :
The veg mousakka- its a bake with exotic veggies and how the shape of veggies can bring out various flavors to the dish.
I had ordered few drinks too like the fire and ice.omg!!!! It actually hits u. People who don't drink alcohol must try this to feel how neat alcohol tastes. Two more but I don't remember the names. Drinks very well made.absolutely refreshing.
Nachos- amazing rajma dip yummmy nachos with loaaaaads of cheese.
Pizzas were thin and crispy and with plenty of toppings . try with Parmesan cheese( have to ask separately for it) and some herbed olive oil.
Pasta- we had ordered for mixed sauce ravioli which were very well done exactly cooked pastas not overdone. Tangy cheesy gravy. *thumbs up*
Service- drinks come pretty quick but food take a lot of time to be prepared they give u plenty if complimentary nachos with different dip which is yummy and acts as an appetizer so beware..
All in all must go for Italian food:)

Very recently been to this place, located on the famous camac street on 8th floor of fort Knox. Had it been on ground floor it must have been flooded with people. It was a monday evening so I was not expecting.
As we entered, the restaurant gave a very elegant feel. We chose a place on a corner with overlooking the city. The place is neatly done with very comfy seating. The best part is the lighting. Here the light is over the person sitting and not just on table as its not always just the food but also the person you have come with.
Next came the food. All specialities. First was zuppa de cippoli and fondue. Zuppa was zuperb. So light and each ingredient's flavour could be felt. Fondue was fine but I won't say amazing. In main course we ordered pizza napoli and lasagne verude. Both were just awesome.
The best part of pizza was, extremely thin crust pizza with just right amount of cheese and toppings, not like one is just feeling cheese or just the toppings. Even taste of the crust could be felt seperately. Superb.
The lasagne was very light and the red sauce made it slightly spicy but that different tinge of continental food was there.
For deserts we had tiramisu and chocolate bomb. Both are treat and a must if you are there. Those are just heavenly, only felt tiramisu was a bit dry.
Now lets talk of the part which I diddn't like was the service. We were there for almost two hours. Though we were two people and in a great company we did,'t really feel two hours but when we were paying we realized. Waiters were well Informed but on a monday night when there were very few people we hoped them to be more attentive.
The entry point could be made a bit more lighted.
Overall and as a foodie amazing Italian experience.

One of my most favorite italian joints in kolkata with an amazing ambience and food..the garlic bread, pasta, pizza, ceaser salad risotto and the list wont end here..interiors have been kept simple and sober which is very attractive...service is nice and prompt..The view from the restaurant is really fantastic...to conclude the chocolate bomb is very famous here and its a must try for everyone. 
Its slightly on a expensive side but its worth every penny just love this place.

One of the few really good places I have visited. This place is a delight to visit. The ambience is great. Interiors are fine. View from the glass windows is good. Food was really good and I had one of the best pastas I've ever had in Kolkata. Lastly the chocolate bomb or what was its name I forgot was cherry on the cake for the dessert . Really satisfied with the visit. Would like to go again and recommend to others!

At the risk of my review being skewed due to my visit to the place on a weekday, I would say it was a pleasant experience. 

The view from the restaurant side is pretty awesome from the 8th flow, however the group wanted to sit on the little high side which had black blinds. Mood killer.

Beverages were so so. Garlic breads were great and the pasta and spaghetti were something that I would like to come back for.

This place featured on my wishlist since a long time for couple of reasons. The lunch which I had yesterday kind of, proved that my choices are really good!!  :) :p Courteous staff, warm ambience with varieties and varieties of authentic, Italian dishes...is what makes this place different from other Italian restaurants. The dishes were ordered by my friend...thankfully I didnt have to leaf through the loooong menu! We had tacos, pizza and for dessert the much coveted Chocolate Bomb. It was delightfully well cooked! Wish I could steal the recipe ;) Tiramisu is also worth having as is repeatedly told to me. It however wasnt available. Nonetheless, there always is a next time. 
I can happily conclude that this will be one of my favourites from now on! :)

Visited Little Italy after a long long time. The place was surprisingly completely empty - even though it was a Thursday - we were the only people till we left. Their mushroom soup was good, but we returned the Minestrone soup as it was tasteless. I somehow didn't like the stuffed mushrooms, but the Nachos with beans and salsa dip was amazing. For the main course, the spaghetti aglio e olio was amazing as was the Asparagus Risotto. The major setback was that they were out of desserts. We were so so looking forward for the chocolate bomb and walnut brownie with ice cream. To top it off, we were offered the strangest of reasons - their ice cream had melted. We requested them to get a simple vanilla ice cream from outside and serve it, but they refused, thus spoiling our experience. Frankly, failed to understand their reluctance. And, they should have made it clear at the time of booking or at least when we arrived. Disappointing end. Price for 4 was 3400. Without desserts, I think it was a steep price.

Consider a 3 layered cake with the juiciest cherry on the top. The 3 layers being Happiness, Satisfaction and Sophistication. And, as The Great Barney Stinson quotes, Awesomeness accounts for the cherry. That's what defines the Destination. 
My personal favourite, Little Italy has given me one particular dessert dish, namely, the Chocolate Bomb that makes my mouth water the moment I think about it. 
On a serious note, try out the Italian dishes out here while seated on a table by the window to account for the Beautiful City of Joy.
Cheers to Little Italy and may it remain my favourite restaurant until forever :D

I would say one of the worst experience I had in my life. Service was awful food was even worse and the bill was the worst I mean u order food u get a such of 600 n still you leave the restaurant feeling hungry and with a bad mouth. The restaurant is over hyped and over priced I would recommend to avoid it.

Very true to it's name, this restaurant seems like a small isolated piece of the best of Italy right in the centre of central Kolkata.
Situated on the eighth floor it gives a wonderful panoramic view of the city.
The waiters are not too profuse with their greetings which is a very good sign, though they show some laxity while you hunt down for a vacant server to take your order.
The menu is constitutional long and it would, literally, take eons to order everything from their menu. I am not going to advocate for a single dish but as a gross review everything is worth eating especially the pastas in mixed sauce.
But before you are complete and ready to go, thinking that one can always have a dessert from outside roadside stall, stop your asses. The best is still left and behold the great CHOCOLATE BOMB. This dish scores the maximum mark on my report card.
Altogether the dishes are morish, coupled with friendly service and okay-okay ambience. Pricing can be a pinch in the pocket but a one time visit will be worth that much. I would prefer you go with your family and colleague than your friends.
This remains one of my favourite Italian restaurant and I again reiterate, do not mss on the CHOCOLATE BOMB.

Probably one of the oldest authentic italian places in Calcutta(apart from good ol fire and ice), little italy is situated in fort knox, the jewellery mall in camac street, where 9f is also situated.Little italy( little high) is an all vegetarian italian experience and serves such wonderful foood that non vegetarians would agree :) The interiors of this place are top notch and the seating is very comfortable, the places looks like a million bucks <3 
On offer are choicest dishes in italian and trust me all vegetarians are spoilt for choice ! Zuppa di cipolle is an amazing start and you can follow it up with a bruschetta (rustic italian comforts) .My favourite pizzas are the pizza zen and the ortolana.The portions are good. For pasta  i like the lasagne aala verdure,which is delicious.Also worth mention is their 4 cheese pasta(formaggi) yumm is the word . 
The service varies(sometimes quick most times tad slow) but the servers are really well informed and guide you throughout. 

A much recommended place , go try ! :)

To all my carnivorous friends making fun of vegetarian food at any given instance, please do visit Little Italy:) I bet you will change your mind. The food is comforting and good to taste- just what Italian cuisine demands. Try their lasagne. Recommended.

If You have a taste for Italian food and you want a fine dining Italian restaurant, Little Italy is the place for you .

Location : Little Italy is located at 8th Floor, Fort Knox Building, Camac Street Area, (just a floor below Urban Desi and 9F). 

 Ambience : The place is warm and cozy . Its not to cluttered with tables, you can sit comfortable and converse . two tables are in good distance to avoid discomfort . The cutlery is kept on table which is neatly done . And you are greeted well when you enter . Not to forget , It has a beautiful view outside you get a  table near the window.


Food description in brief: 
------------------
A) Starter's : Garlic bread , Jalapeno poppers , Fondue . All of which tasted superb . I would personally recommend to try the Fondue (After all nothing can go wrong with a good amount of cheese in your bread crumb)
------------------
B) Main Course : Ceasar Salad , Indian pizza , Al 4 Formaggi pasta. All of which was decent . I would recommend you try their pizza which is freshly done and has really good flavors 
------------------
C) Dessert : Chocolate Bomb . This one is highly recommend , even if you are not a chocolate lover. It really melts in your mouth . We called for a second helping for this one . 
------------------
Staff : The staff were friendly , knew the menu well . But they seem to be a little disorganised . 

Overall , I would rate little Italy a 4. It was good dining experience.

______________

Summary: 
Food quantity 3.5/5
Food quality 4/5
Service Promptness 4/5
Hospitality 4/5
Ambience 4.5/5

Nice place to dine it with friends and family. Little pocket pinching but worth it. :)

Personally, i loved how fast the staff was with the service. I had the World's best nachos, baked stuffed pizza and a plate of their ceasers salad. Within a minute i had the best nachos i've ever tasted on my plate. And a little after that came the pizza and the salad. With this i ordered a 'fire and ice' to drink. And may i say, fire it was indeed. though it was a little spicy for me but i thought that it was an amazing combination.
Later, i order lasanga with a layer of cheese. But sadly i forgot to mention the type of cheese and ended up having cottage cheese lasagna and a slice of thin crust margharita pizza which tasted amazing. The ambiance and crowd was really good too.

Back to Little Italy, though this time the location is different. We have earlier visited their restaurants @ Hyderabad( beautiful location) Ahmedabad and Chennai. We were definitely happy with the familiar menu and quality of food.

Decor with the warm yellow lights was okay. Seating was comfortable without feeling crowded as one does in many places. Only the dark colours does not give it a cheerful feel. Wish it had some colours seen in their cuisine. 

Cream of Mushroom and cream of asparagus soups were both good and up to expectation. Grilled stuffed mushroom was great too. Pasta both fresh dough one and spaghetti was delicious and to our taste. Tobasco sauce based pizza with  sundried tomatoes and jalapeños was spicy to tangy, crisp at the base with the right amount of cheese. We just loved it. 

A word on the service. It was just about adequate unlike our experience of more cheerful and eager service at the other Little Italy restaurants we are used too. We had to request for change of plates when we went from pasta to pizza. Though the food made up for it completely!

Being an italian lover,there is no way I could have missed out on this place. Being a modest,unspoilt student,I had to take shell out my savings to eat here,but it was totally worth it.
The ambience is such,that once you enter the place, you feel you're a king. Classy interiors,well spaced tables,over whelming hospitality,and knowledgeable staff. 
The food is not only extremely authentic,but also very tasty. The pizzas, pastas ,rissotos are all dishes which when tasted ,prove the experience of the cook.
The desserts are extraordinary.
Personal fav - A unique rissoto ive not seen anywhere else - Saffron Rissoto.

Had one of the worst experience at Little Italy. Saturday evening, we made reservation for four through phone & were confirmed by the staff. On reaching the place, first of all we had to wait almost 10 minutes at the reception as there was nobody available to assist. Then we were told that we have to wait till a table is empty & that there has been some confusion regarding the reservation. We still waited patiently for 10 minutes after which we complained about their treatment. Finally the lady at the reception (Ms.Heena Irshad) comes to the counter and very coldly tells us that these things happen & 10 - 20 minutes waiting time (even after pre-booking) is very normal. She also mentioned sarcastically, that even customers make them wait by coming in late. Throughout, her tone was extremely rude & taunting. We left immediately & promised ourselves never to return back again. FIRE AND ICE is an amazing place (much better than Little Italy) both in terms of food and ambience. That's where we went to save our evening & believe me it (FIRE AND ICE) more than lived up to our expectations. Little Italy really needs to train their staff on customer service & basic politeness & courtesy.

Italian Heaven for Vegetarians. There  are hardly any complaints I can have about this place.

Starting from the soup, the Zuppa Di Cipolle is my favourite. The others also taste fine. But this remains a favourite.

The starters are quite nice. The Nachos with beans is a must try. The Fondue and Crostini Assortiti taste fine. Haven't tried the others. But given the taste of the other dishes, I am sure they must be good as well.

Coming to the main course, the Pizzas & Pastas are really Delectable. The Risotto could be improved.

The Lemonade is one of the Best I have ever had.

Lastly, the Chocolate Mousse and Tiramisu are Heavenly. Do not leave the place without having one of these.

Team Little Italy - I Absolutely love the Ambiance and the Service. Keep up the Great work. :)

Little Italy was my high today afternoon as I stepped in with a friend of mine. In shades of warm brown and smouldering black, this restaurant gives you a warm and comfortable feel and a plethora of options to choose, from their enormous menu. You just cannot have enough of it, I swear !
This restaurant is all posh and classy and you will feel very royal in here. I already felt great. Loved the interior and the ambience. Its pretty big and a provides a magnanimous view of the city! 
I mean what can be better than sitting at an awesome restaurant, enjoying lasagne while its raining cats and dogs outside! Heaven isnt it? :D  (It rained like crazy today which also made my experience even better)
The staff is very friendly and makes you feel comfortable enough. ( They are so sweet that they even wait for you till you click the pictures of the food you eat ) :P :D

We ordered : : 1. Cinderella (mocktail)
                          2. Pasta Al Forno
                          3. Ai 4 Formaggi
                          4. Cheese Quesadilla
                          5. Lasagne Alla Verdure
                          6. Blueberry Cheesecake
                          7. Chocolate Bomb

I believed we over ate today but could not help it. The food was divine. Just.
The cinderella was very nice and sweet and refreshing  (as I prefer it) 
Next came the pastas - Spaghetti and the Fusilli. Both tasted awesome. I preferred the fusilli with the tomato sauce and mushrooms because I'm ocean deep in love with mushrooms. They tasted just perfect. The spaghetti was prepared with four cheese and surprisingly, one can actually taste all the four cheeses in them. No, simply NO adulteration. Fabulous!

Next was the cheese quesadillas. They gave 3 dips each. (Sorry, I do not know the names) They were totally delicious. 
The quesadillas tasted good even without the dips.With the dips, of course they tasted great. 

The ending of our main course was with the lasagne which was again, brilliantly made. It was lip smacking and the hot lasagne and the rain outside made it a great affair indeed :)
The lasagne was soft and the pasta tasted great and they do not compromise on the quantity either!
It was suffice for two. After having eaten ALL that were served, we finally snailed along to the dessert section.
I was too tempted by the Choco Bomb but later on their suggestion ordered Blueberry Cheesecake and a Chocolate Bomb.
Both of them were out of this world. The Blueberry Cheesecake was sweet and soft, the cake crust below was just perfect. The blueberry cheesecake I presume also had little crumbs of blueberry, which tasted delicious. 
The choco bomb was simply sinful as the soft gooey chocolate burst into my mouth, I became ecstatic. It was delightfully warm and soft and chocolaty. The ice cream with it was devilishly good. The food here at Little Italy can actually transport you to Italy and make you have the time of your life. This was definitely one of the BEST meals I ever had and Little Italy being one of the finest restaurants I've visited.

Team Little Italy, 
You guys are just fabulous. Tonnes of love and wishes from my end.
Keep up the good work.

Cheers!  :)

Little Italy is my all time favourite Italian joint by far in all of India. I have been to the Little Italy restaurants in Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Delhi and of course Kolkata but i find the Kolkata restaurant to be the best.

In my many visits i have tried a lot of their dishes but i must say that i can never resist ordering the spaghetti aglio olio every time i go their. The only better spaghetti aglio olio i have tasted was out of India. The porcini mushroom rissotto is another of my favourites from this place. People who want to try out new things should try the tortellini and a pasta with a pesto sauce as the pesto here is very good.

This place is also a treat for chocolate lovers be it the chocolate bomb, chocolate mud pie of chocolate avalange. Each one of them is to die for.

A really classy Italian place. Love the ambiance and service. Quiet, comfortable, soothing restaurant. 

The food is amazing. In the last 5-7 years, have probably had all their pastas and risottos. Perfectly cooked pastas with great flavours. Pizzas are really good as well. A must try is their mud pie for dessert. But I guess, if its on the menu you would order it without me saying right?

Pricing is totally justified with the quality of food and service.

Overall, a great place to take a date or family for a fine-dine meal. Definitely one of my favourite places in Calcutta.

Six friends went to lunch at Little Italy. We asked Stewart on duty to help us guide with ordering their signature dishes.
Here is the report
SOUPS we ordered Spring Onion Soup and Minestroni soup. Spring onion soup was outstanding,highly recommended.
STARTERS Spinach Salsa, Pale do potato and suprimo garlic bread, all three were very good and worth repeating.
MAINS. Lasagne,asparagus risotto andPizza Napoli. Pizza was outstanding and others were also good.
DESSERTS Highly praised Choclate Bomb was really good,Tiramisu was nice but a bit runny. Chocolate a mouse was also good.
For vegetarians and for non vegetarians who are looking for a change,this place is good.
Average cost per person in a group is about Rs 700.

Little Italy.. It is located in Fort Knox in Camac Street, on the 8th Floor, under Urban Desi and the newly opened 9F. Have been going here since a long time and have never really been disappointed. It is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city. The ambiance is classy with dim lighting and the interiors done in subtle shades of brown and black. Located on the 8th Floor, it provides a great view of South Calcutta. Coming to the food, I have tried almost everything on the menu and it is by and large good. There are of course, many favorites of mine for which I keep returning here. This, being a Vegetarian restaurant, is a great hit with the large Marwari and Gujrati population of the city. The service is good too. I would have come here almost every week if only it was easy on the pocket. Expect to shell out 1000 per head.

Not to be missed  :
● Tabasco Pizza (by far the best I've had here.)
● Risotto Con Asparagi OR Quattro Formaggio Risotto.
● Fondue with Exotic Veggies  OR Nachos with Cheese Sauce OR Spinaci Salsa
● Crostini Assortiti
● Chocolate Bomb (AMAZING. Do NOT Attempt to Share!)

This is not the place it used to be..bad food..pathetic service..terrible hospitality..and a bloody shameless manager to top it all..it's happened for the second time with us and would recommend anyone reading this to avoid going to this place..
If the manager and the staff can't take the criticism it's better to avoid a place which was so very highly rated with me before..
The pizza we ordered was margarita with olives and it seemed like the pizza was full of vinegar that the olives are dipped in..on complaint we gay lame excuses and a very bad treatment the story was the same with the pasta and everything else..
Please avoid the place..should be the last eating option in kolkata which has so much more to offer than this..
If this is what the staff of little Italy call service and food quality let them be happy with the misconception they have..

Had heard a lot about this place and wanted to come here since a long time. I am a veg and went there along two other veg friends of mine. The ambiance is classy with dim lighting and wooden furnitures. The waiters very extremely courteous and very helpful. We ordered Crostini assetiti as starter which was nice. The main course wihich consisted Canellioni, Lasagne and Pasta Barbaresa was abosolutely brilliant. For desserts we were very much looking forward for tiramisu. We ordered three desserts and saved tiramisu for the last, but I daresay it was bad. It was soggy, bitter and in no ways what we had expected it to be. The tiramisu is the only reason I am giving this place a rating of 4.0 instead of 4.5 or 5. Its much better at places like kookie jar or casa toscana.
The prices are steep but you come out satisfied from this place. For the meal for 3 including beer the bill came down to 4200 INR inclusive of taxes

On a recent visit to Little Italy
The place was complete empty as in no customer and at the reception I was asked do I have a reservation. 
We ordered for few mock-tails Garlic Bread , Mash Potatoes, Pasta & Pizza , .  
Mockatails were good 4.5/5
Garlic Bread was good as ever 4/5
Then Mash Potatoes with corn n capsicum was edible. 3/5
Pasta was tasteless 2/5
Pizza had vegetable raw over it and with no salt. Horrible 1/5

All over 2.5 Rating. 
The destination I used to look forward to is now worthless.

Italian cuisine is becoming very popular in Kolkata but i fail to understand why most of the Italian restaurants serve only vegetarian food...nonetheless i wanted to taste their food as i am an ardent fan of  italian cooking and love the cuisine..though i am a hardcore non vegetarian but thought of giving it a try as i had heard a lot about Little Italy..
so i happened to walked in to the restaurant without a reservation with my friends, not a very usual act that i do, i prefer booking a table before going to any restaurant. the restaurant was dimly lit.. and there were only 2 families so we were lucky enough to get a table.
we ordered for garlic bread which is common and was like any other place but fondue with exotic veggies was simply awesome. i had no idea that veg food can be as much interesting as non veg food. the fondue had the perfect taste and the mixture of white sauce and cheese was just perfect. the vegetables were fresh..and there presentation of the dish was worth mentioning. the fondue came in a small bowl and was served hot..
next we ordered pasta 4 stagioni..which was a creamy tomato mixed sauce with the right proportion of garlic and sun dried tomatoes..the portion was good and tasted brilliant..
well i do not like missing Italian dessert specially if i happen to see tiramisu in the menu card. the tiramisu was ordinary but fudge brownie with vanilla ice-cream with the cherry on the top..
overall a good ambiance and if u r fond of vegetarian food.. a place u should not miss..

with an exuberant ambience and touch of world class dining,little italy is a premium venture of italian food chain in kolkata.the quality of food and service and the interiors are unmatched.i have been there just once and tried pizza and sphagetti.its perfect italian taste without the excesses of indian masala is quite refreshing.th pocket crunch is however a factor though.but considering a high end dining,its a thumbs up!!

A good place to have dinner. Loved my second experience.
We got lime drinks,
In starters we had taken nachos with beans which were no doubt delicious,
Also took cheese balls, were good but one can give it a miss.
In main course we took one wood-burn Pizza i.e Fantasy,
It had a indian touch in it too with cottage cheese and coriander,
Order for a thick crust pizza or you will get very thin crust,
Risotto al forno was quite filling and tasty dish,
For someone who would hesitate to try risotto,
I would suggest that if you like cheese and rice then would like it,
And if you want to play it safe then you can take al forno,
Dessert was the cherry on the cake,
With soft brownie and sizzling chocolate,
Chocolate bomb was also yummy,

It needs work on ambience,
Last time had gone for dinner so couldn't see most of the things,
Serving are in good quantity,
Spend here or you wouldn't fill your stomachs

Though I am a non vegetarian had wanted to visit this place ever since I had tasted their awesome food in Mumbai.Went there for dinner.Though the food is expensive I must admit it is the best veg food I have ever tasted.Their quesadilla is mind awesome and so is their pasta in white sauce.Best part is the food is customisedbased on the order and the waiters pay attention toeach detail provided so what is served is much to your expectation.The ambience is also quite nice and peaceful.Only things that could have been better would be the availability of fondue and better options for desserts.
Even then if someone would ask me to visit again it would definitely be a yes.

i must say this restaurant is something i adore not only for what it is or it provides but also because my first visit here was on my birthday!!with decor soo posh and classy, all i can say is it's ambience is simple yet grabs attention!located in a very prime location of Fort Knox, Camac street, Little Italy provides you the most authentic, finest and delicious italian cuisine you can get in town making you actually feel  like theres a little italy in the city of joy!! Be it pizzas, pastas, risottos it just gets it all right!it's just that the place is a little over-priced!!i mean a little decent pricing is all it needs!as a whole a nice place to go with friends or family!!i can happily give a 4.5 to Little Italy!!

One of the best authentic Italian family restaurants in Kolkata. The place is dimly lit, and well furnished with a great space. Has an attached discotheque. The overall ambiance is great except the occasional loud music from the discotheque. Food - Strictly authentic Italian. Also includes a generous variety for authentic Mexican food. Strictly Vegetarian. Serves alcohol. Must try - Lasagna in red gravy, Rissotto in white gravy, Chocolate bomb for deserts. *Those habituated to the 'family garlic bread' from Jalapenos, shouldn't order garlic bread as they will be disappointed* Also, since the menu is in italian, the waiters are very helpful. Bon apetit !

What do you get when you combine veggie food and Italian (and also Mexican) cuisine? The answer is simple: it's Little Italy! With gorgeous interiors, and food to absolutely die for, this is a must visit place for all vegetarians who love nothing more than digging into a slice of la dolce vita with mouth-wateringly delicious food! Apart from the delicious pastas don't forget to sample some of the desserts on offer, especially the Chocolate Bomb! It's well worth the slight pocket-pinch and a definite don't miss place!

horrible experience n very disappointing food. I had come here after years n ws hoping for an amazin repeat of all my previous experiences. but was very sad by the end of.my meal. my jalepeno popper. ws just full of cheese n had no other flavour to it. my pizza was soggy and d risotto was undercooked. by the end I was so underwhelmed that I did not even want to try any dessert. would definitely not go there again anytime soon.

Have just been here once, and that was my last time too' I do not have any 'beef' . with the place but every reviewer seems to be missing the elephant in the room. If there is such a paradoxical cuisine such as vegetarian Italian then Little Italy serves it. No matter however fabulous the good it, I don't think an establishment can pride itself for serving authentic Italian fare when the red meat, the poultry and the seafood is off the menu. The owner obviously brings his personal gastronomic preferences and imposes them on his patrons, all it does feel like it's meant for a certain affluent business community but as I understand their next-gen have far swayed from the idealistic vegetarian roots. So it would do Little Italy good to get a little dose of reality.

This place is an itallian food heaven..ambiance is totally nice..we started with mexican salad..perfect mixture of salt and sour.just awsome..after than we had lasagne and everybody must try Tris(the best at this place i guess),though this dish is a bit costly..but one must try this dish..as a dessert we had had a ice cream with mint chip that tasted like some hevenly dish..
