Good place , as it pulls the maximum crowd to and fro the Santragachi Station. A people's delight if you love Bengali Cuisine. The name rightly suggests so. The Chinese and Biryani served are not much behind from the peoples wishlist

Just opposite Santragachi station a very good restaurant..Have been there few times.banglar kolapata serves authentic Bengali food in the afternoon which is not only delicious but also within the budget..In the evening you will get all the Chinese dishes as well as biryani..Special chicken biryani is must if you go there..Service is very good too..Overall a good experience..
