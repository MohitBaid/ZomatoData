Located centrally in located in Golpark. This place has got variety of sweets but the quality is too poor compared to other places. Though their kochuri is fine enough. Not a recommendable place.

Its been 20 years, i am having the experience of such a heritage mithai shop. But today, I visited with my family in the morning to have Radhaballavi & alur dum and surprised myself with quality of food which decreased, behaviour of the cashier also was arrogant, wired, Insensible towards us / any other customers. it was hardly 5-6 customers at 11am on SATURDAY morning which made me a bit shocked coz most of the time Mouchak at Golpark becomes crowdy. the brand of Mouchak may rise higher but sorry tosay that the quality of Radhaballavi & alur dum are just not bearable along with the hotness of the wrong attitude. i will suggest the cashier / owner whoever he is, just maintain the curtsy otherwise it is affecting on the taste of the food.. sorry but its fact.

Undoubtedly one of the best when it comes to authentic Bengali sweets. But Mouchak is also special because they experiment on new and innovative items. Some of the special highlights are - Baked rosogolla, truffle, chocolate barfi, pan-masala sandesh. 

Hot radhaballavi with aloo dum is a must have. Overall it can be considered as one of the legendary sweet shops in Kolkata, a taste of Mouchak sweets is a must.

Folks living in South Kolkata are not unknown to this gem of a mishti r Dokan . It's the pride of Golpark. I have been here many a times and is definitely a personal favourite . Have tried their nalen gur er sondesh many many times and it's definitely a treat . This time though very recently tried some of their offbeat offerings. Frankly , they did not turn out to be over the top but still they were pretty decent sondesh.

1. Mango ball ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- It just caught my eye the first time I saw them . Tiny little yellowish delights served a tiny golden container. These are basically molten sondesh wrapped by "aamsotto" layering . It was a delightful experience . Still, the quality is behind the biggies but still a decent offering .

2. Sahi paan ( 3 / 5 ) :- What seemed like an opportunity to taste pan flavor in sondesh . It didn't turn out that way . The outer wrapping was a barfi like quality . The taste seemed like a mould of kaju and the in the inside you will find badam pieces . It was noway close to an experience of having a pan which was a little dissapointing . But still an average sondesh.

3. Baked rasogolla ( 4 / 5 ) :- Classic . Loved it at first swallow .

Nevertheless , an option which I will choose blindly whenever I have mishti cravings in Golpark and I'll suggest these to the others too .

There is nothing to complain, but nothing to be excited about as well.
Service was good. Ambience is okay.
I like their radhaballabi and alur dom. Khasta kochuri is just okay.
I prefer their traditional sweets over their new launched sweets (baked sandesh and baked rosogolla and a few more).
P.S.-  The taste of sweets and snacks used to be better than what it is now.

The city of joy is famous for a lot of things, landmarks and achievements but the one which stands out in south KOLKATA is MOUCHAK sweet shop.It is a small but one of the best and the finest sweet shops in town, yes comparatively it is slightly expensive than the rest in the locality but it is definitely worth every penny. The "SANDESH, "RASOGOLLAS" and a vast variety of "NALEN GUR" sandesh.
They have lots of collection, but still lack in variety of fusion sweets.

The person on the counter ( I think he's G**tham), is rude and loud-mouthed. That said, if the sweets were anything to write home about, it would still be ok. I picked up the 'langcha' and their namesake 'mouchak'. Both were downright pathetic.
I am a Delhiite and I have a fair idea of what poor quality sweats taste like :(

If their is no rush then you can seat and eat as well although 3 to 4 maximum people can seat.

The radhabollovi with alur dom is nice here   at rs 10 the malpua is also good 

Rosogolla is also a show stopper

During the summer, when I used to be too hungry after swimming from my club at Golpark - I used to have their Radha Ballabhi for breakfast. Tasty or not, I used to have it anyway given how madly hungry I would be. Still, it's better than those Dalda Fried Kochuris.
However, I have a particular dislike towards their Rossogolla.. I personally do not prefer spongy Rossogollas and those you would get in the morning wouldn't even be fresh.

Coming to the sweets, they are extremely tasty with the perfect balance of sweetness. 
Apart from their general sweets,what I found new today (puja special launch) were:

Chocolate barfi.

Although the outlet has been in the area for decades now, and was even refurbished a few years back, I have always found Mouchak to be a bit overpriced, compared to the quality and / or size of sweets they provide. Their Cadbury Dairy Milk sandesh collection was nice, but to be quite honest, I've had better. Would definitely love this decades old place to improve and maintain its glory. Good luck.

Bengali's have a sweet tooth. No wonder you'll find sweet shops in every nook and corner of the city. Some have been there for so long, history speaks for itself. The mouchaks, bancharams, balaram mallicks!! The list never ends.
The location has become a landmark itself. It's in Golpark. They have a decent variety of sweets. But then again, sometimes they aren't fresh. Not being a sweets person, I'm not really a fan of the sweets. I like their radha ballavi aloo'r dum.

Since I don't have much of a sweet tooth, Mouchak for me (and my generation) had always been for years the quintessential meeting place where friends assemble for before setting out for a place to hang out. After a decade or so of waiting in front of it and passing it even more, I finally ventured inside and decided to have Radha Ballobi on the way back from swimming. The Radha Ballobi was more of a luchi, with no filling, and smelt of the oil it was fried in. The dum aloo was better - a dry gravy not any more delicious than the simple home-made Sunday morning aloo dums. I left with no regrets at not having visited the place earlier.

Located just around the gariahat flyover ending towards golpark.

Specially Misti doi is just the most savoured item in Mouchak according to me. 😇

When Mouchak opened its door again after years of hiatus, it was a happy occasion for nostalgic people like us.

Mouchak is one of the legendary sweet shops in Kolkata. There is hardly anyone living in the city does not know about the shop and its legacy. 

**Location**
Located at one of teh busiest place in the city Golpark more. Just on the left hand side of the island coming from Gariahat or the Gariahat flyover.

**Known For**
Firstly in my opinion this is used as a very common landmark of Golpark or even Gariahat as because of its popularity. As my most of the friends lives in south Kolkata area this has been a common meeting point for all of us.

**Products**
A pure bengali sweet shops with lots of options in chanar misti and sandesh as well. Also you get some authentic bangali singara and kachori which is hot favorite still now. Misti doi is another item which is always in demand.

**Service**
Without a good service along with quality products one can not sustain the business thats for sure. Quick and prompt service and keeping good terms with the customers makes that difference always. 
Overall a must try destination for foodies..May the legacy continues to carry on the charisma of the city of joy.

I would have given it a 5 star if I was born in the pre 80 era. No innovation has ever taken place. And hence the sweets you get here are perfect for those who are still live in the olden eras. The shop has a great strategic location and hence finds customers but the shops that surrounds it have by far gone ahead of time and the sweets are also better. I'd request the owner of the shop to improve the variety they offer.

A lot of childhood memories associated here. Not only with Mouchak, but with their partner restaurant Hotel Saptarshi as well. I remember of having visited here almost once every week! A college friend to my father used to work as a high ranking officer overseeing the work of both these institutions and the office was situated right behind Mouchak. So whenever my father used to visit his friend, he used to take me and boy did I get some love and blessings from him. 

Owing to the repeated visits and the relation which my father shared here, this is where he got acquainted with the owner of Mouchak. I remember him as a nice, young man (Uncle to me). He even invited us to stay at his brother's home at New Delhi when we were in transit from Kolkata to Dehradun via New Delhi. That was some 13-14 years back, but those are memories which probably cannot be shared here.

Coming to Mouchak, Golpark, an age old institution which has still kept up to its name and quality! Offering savoury snacks and sinful sweets since ages, this has literally become a landmark in South Kolkata! There is hardly a soul in entire Kolkata, who is possibly not acquainted with the existence of this sweet shop. Many copy-cats has sprang up trying to duplicate the fame and hype, but none has been successful in living up to its name!

If you every come here, try their special sweet which is named as Mouchak! Besides, am a huge fan of their Laddoos and Barfi as well. For snacks, try their Samosas and Kachoris. To end the hearty meal, pick up some scoops of their Mishti Doi. The pricing here is moderate and doesn't charge you exorbitant rates! Surely a place to visit again and again to fulfill the beckoning of sweetness!

Mouchak is a very popular sweet shop in South Kolkata. It is located at Golpark More.i have only visited it recently though ot was located opposite to my school. One eerie thing about this store is that pedestrians walk through the store to get on the other side of the road sometimes and the management is allright with that. I went here after visiting AMRI. The store was well maintained. It was clean. The behavior of the staffs were amkable. We ordered a plate of radhaballavi which came with 'alur torkari'. It tasted really good. I loved the 'alur torkari'. It was cooked perfectly. Next we ordered their special sweet which eerily is also known as mouchak. This sweet was mind-blowing as well. We loved it. In a nutsshell, a good sweet shop. I will surely visit again.

Mouchahak is beyond rating. The sweet Rosho Sudha (i guess was the name) was served as 'Totto' (sweet platter while wedding) from my dad's side to mom's family. 
I am brought up eating Mouchak sweets, playing around that Golpark circle of mouchak. For me Golpark is Mouchak. In my dad's last days he demanded Mouchak ...  What more i can say about you Mouchak, you are legend!! Thank you.

When you pass by Golpark, your eyes are sure to run into Mouchak sweets shop situated right on the road. Mouchak has a miscellany of toothsome sweets starting from the very basic sandesh and gulab jamuns to barfi and mishti doi. The samosas and kachoris are also served hot and they taste delicious with a sweet or two. Prices are also not very high.

Time passed by, quality didn't, it's still the same great quality you expect from Mouchak.
The "shingara", the "radhabollobi and alur dom", the "mishti doi", the "sandesh" still remains the same and as delicious as ever.
Once you eat here, there's nothing but LOVE!!

Been eating their sweets since childhood. Now I take their sweets with me back to Dubai whenever I come to Kolkata. They have remained the same as always in my memory, and that's the way it should be.

A very nice sweet shop at golpark more serving delicious sweets. Mishti for bengalis has always been a very emotional point and mouchak has been touching this spot for years now. Although mouchak has a number of outlets, this one is very close to rkm institute of culture and so my most visited outlet. I generally have their sorbhaja and trust me, they serve amazing sor bhaja. Yum yum yum!! And seriously i am in love with their sweets. The prices are good and pocket friendly and so even students who have a sweet tooth can eat them. Yummmy mishti..

This is possibly the second sweet shop that I am reviewing after chittaranjan. Growing up in north kolkata,  surrounded by amazingly tasty sweet shops have developed a critical sweet tooth.  I definitely do not praise sweets until it is real good.
Now this one in golpark is something that I have been addicted to since my dance class days. 
The sinful mishti doi still lingers on the tip of my taste buds and so does the rabri,  which tastes superb.
Among sweets am a huge fan of their rasho sudha and their chitrakoot.
Though I feel their rosogollas are a bit chewy and that definitely needs to be worked upon.
The flaky khir kadam and posto kadam is something that I don't mind hogging on and on.
And not to miss the keshar barfi and the chhanar payesh. 

People living in south kolkata, you are blessed atleast with a sweet shop which supplies authentic bengali sweets.
Do miss the opportunity and grab it on at the earliest.

During my college days I was a frequent visitor. I stayed in keyatala for over 3 years and during this period I used to visit this place. 
Although there's nothing to say about the food quality as it's time tested and people know the brand. A wide array of sweets are available. 
It's just opposite ganguram and is facing tough competition  but still the brand speaks...

I am usually biased towards bengali sweets....that's what living in calcutta for several years have done to me! In calcutta, you will find a sweet shop almost in every lane and i miss that sorely since the time i have had to move to bangalore!

Mouchak is a very old brand in calcutta and I have been there quite a few times. The quality of their sweets though have declined since the old times. I'd rate a 'mithai' or a 'gopinath' a little higher than the mouchak of today.

However i still think their "raabri" is a superhit....you can't miss that if you are around the gariahat-golpark area anytime.

Mouchak is not just a name but also a landmark for people in south kolkata. This place has specialized in good sweets for a few decades now. Over the years they have opened and closed multiple times, but somehow I feel the sweets they have today are not as good as they used to be. The best things to buy here are the Mouchak which is a trademark of the place. Among others what I like here are the Toast (which is a sweet that looks like a bread-toast) the sada talshaash and the kalo jaam.They also have an ice cream counter if you are interested. I definitely feel they need to up themselves a little provided the competition in the sweets market these days. Overall 3.5/5 from me.

This is the outlet from where the magical journey of "Mouchak" started decades ago, located in the prime location of golpark. They are one of the most sought after and trusted name for the sweet lover of city of joy. They have been satisfying the crave for quality and mouth watering sweets for ages with complete dedication. I was introduced to this sweet shop by my mother. She used to take sweets from this very outlet in tiffin during her school days. Hence "Mouchak" brings a lot of nostalic feelings and memories to the people of Kolkata. With time this outlet has expanded and has opened up multiple number of outlets all over the city. They offer a wide variety of sweets and other savories ranging from- chamcham, sharbhaja, mouchak(their special and signature offering), lyangcha, rabri and lot of other mouth watering sweets. Their recently introduced fusion sweets comprising of chocolate, fruits etc have also earned a lot of appraisal. The quality of their offerings has never been altered till date but have been improved with time. This is not just another sweet shop of Kolkata but a heritage and a living legend where the generations meet.

The shop is one of the oldest sweet shops in the area , giving the place a name for its bus stop !  Almost all their products are worth a try. The bhaja mishti segment is the best of the lot , and exceptional in terms of taste and size of the sweets . Chocolate sandesh is also available in some of its basic avatars. The swar bhaja is a favorite here, as is the chitrakut. This place is where you go when you crave some good ol' bhaja Mishti on days when health doesn't matter much !

I dropped by this place to cater to my sweet tooth,after being filled to the neck with Biriyani and Kebab...

and I definitely opten for Nolen gurer mishtis...

In the display case,a certain mishti caught my attention,which according to the shopkeeper was anonymous,but it looked promising,and to my utmost glee,tasted out of this world..it was a small bottle cap shaped gurer misthi filled wid honey colored liquid nolen gur...couldn't help but gulp down three pieces of it..before trying on another rose colored Sandesh..too bad they don't ascribe a name to each of their items...

nonetheless when it tastes ethereal,I'm reminded with the famous phrase by shakespeare

"WHAT'S IN A NAME"??
Being in close vicinity to my library,I've checked this place,to be visited regularly henceforth :)

Pretty moderate place located in Golpark--it was the best for many years in that area before the arrival of Bancharam, Ganguram and then Mithai. 
In my childhood I used to visit this place repeatedly and tried out sweets, fulkofir singara and radhaballavi.
Now a days after it has reopened I feel that somehow the quality has degraded though varieties has increased but I dont feel that ano of their sweet items can impress your taste buds a lot. All are good but not outstanding, the price is moderate.
Singara I feel they still are really good but radhaballavi and alur dum again is just average.It almost a heritage of the Golpark crossing and definitely deserves a visit or two.

A decent enough sweet shop. Was the best in the area till the Bancharam and Ganguram's came up. Is still good post its reopening. There might be delays in the service depending on what time you are visiting but nothing to be complaining about. Sweets are better than the snacks in my opinion. It is a very old and almost a heritage of the Golpark crossing and definitely deserves a visit or two.

Nothing extraordinary is the phrase that comes to my mind if i am to summarise my experience. I tried out sweets like the baked sandesh,their specialty sweet named "mouchak", golab bhog and the good old rosogolla. Barring their specialty named mouchak all the other sweets lacked the wow factor and failed to impress.The baked sandesh was too bland and was not sweet at all. It was at best solidified chana(cottage cheese ) sans the sweetness.The rosogolla size was inadequate keeping the price tag of Rs 10/- in mind.It was not that spongy enough-something which i prefer.The golab bhog-bengali version of gulab jamun was nice  with a light brown soft skin coating.I found the singaras to be pretty tasty.At Rs 8/- they were extra large in size with a spicy stuffing of masala potato inside.In fact i noticed that their singaras sell out pretty fast and stocks are replenished almost immediately.Nothing comes close to a piping hot singara.
The attractive location, plenty of variety are the plus points of this joint.On the flip side some sweets are too small in size as compared to the price they charge and provide no value for money.Items which i intend to sample in my next visit would be kheer kadam,poshto kadam and the chocolate sandesh.
Recommended items: Singara,langcha,mouchak

Mouchak - The name is appealing. However, the misti does not remain appealing after taste. :( 
====================================================================================
Intro: 
It is located in the Golpark crossing very near to the Golpark Ccd. I have probably heard this name a lot of times in my daily life from my friends, relatives and all. I gave a visit here. I did not see anything extra ordinary about this place except there was one rasgulla. 
====================================================================================
Ordered:-

Orange Rasgulla - It was flavoured with orange. However, it was not soft at all. I would always prefer Chittaranjan. It is no match to it. It costed me 10 bucks and i feel the price is high too. 
====================================================================================
Summary:

Quality 3.5/5
Quantity 3.5/5
VFM 3/5
Taste 3/5
====================================================================================
Conclusion: 

According to me, It is pretty moderate a place. :)

I have always been fond of mouchak, the Kheer kadam and the posto kadam just get me going , even the savories like samosa and kachori are nice too. Their sweets are tad bit sweeter than others .I have been a having their kheer kadam for more than 20 years and it has always been just right i especially love the extra sugary center and the kheer outer that just balances it off beautifully. 

the posto kodom on the other hand is really rich in texture with poppy seeds on the exterior and they adds a very nutty flavor to a filling that's identical to the kheer kadam. 

Had some of their fare at the nolen gur festival at city center the other day and must say it was very impressive, Especially the gur rabri and the gur kalakand. Mouchak has been around forever and they do take good care of their products which are very consistent

the sweets of Mouchak used to be very good but somehow somewhere the quality of the sweets have dropped. As a kid been there many times. some sweets are still there good old taste. love to see old Mouchak reviving. could have said that we could go to Mouchak on regular basis but looking at the standards u could govthere only once in a while.
