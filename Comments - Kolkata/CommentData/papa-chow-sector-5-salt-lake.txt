This Papa Chow stall is located near South City Pinnacle building. I am a regular customer there and had tried most of their common items. They offer momos, rolls, noodles mainly.
They are a bit better than the nearby other roadside joint when it comes to food quality.
Momos are good, better than most of the places around. Noodles is also decent, but have not liked their rolls.
Overall as a roadside joint it offers some decent stuffs.

Probably the worst place to order from. Firstly this does not qualify to be a restaurant, it's more like a stall on the road and the quality is below average. Whats wrong with Zomato and Swiggy? for the sake of business, you guys will take anyone onboard.  This is really bad and not expected .

It's a roadside eatery at college more in sector 5. The price is more mouth watering than the food actually. The quality of food is so so but the rolls are good enough compared to the price.

Papa Chow has 4 outlets, 2 around sector 5, 1 at New Town and 1 at Rajarhat. I frequent the outlet beside South City Pinnacle, situated on the roadside but the quality however is far better. Their Chicken Momos are pretty good sans the soup, which is pretty sub standard. Their chicken chow mein is fantastic, the proportion of chicken, veggies and noodles is pretty balanced. However, that said the proportion is sometimes inconsistent and that's the reason I have rated them below 4 which is my average for good restaurants. It is however worth a try and the quality is much better than a normal roadside vendor.

They have couple of stall in Sector 5 serving chinese food . Had there veg steamed momo and it was delicious with good amount of stuffing and thin outer layer. Stuffing had a taste of spicy sabji masala.Overall a good place to have spicy chinese food during office hours.

On my way to KFC I decided to skip the boring burger and try this new bright food joint,

For starters I would like to say it being placed on the main road it was very clean and looked very hygienic, the Chef wore plastic gloves while Handling ol the ingredients and while cooking also he was being very clean about the leftovers,

We had the noodles and the chilly chicken here, n I must say the noodles was very tasty, I love kolkata street food n I must say it had a lot of good flavours, the chilly chicken was okay the gravy was tasty, only thing dissatisfied me was their menu it was stupidly complicated and the chef was also unaware of the owners intention of the various dishes that was put up there. The menu needs to be simplified.

Well, was initially reluctant to visit them, since this is a very small outlet based on the road side nearby my office. However, a friend of mine recommended them and I nevertheless walked into. Was initially disappointed to see that neither fried rice, nor atta based stuff, nor Chinese samosa available – and I had no option but to settle for their veg momos. The counter guy proceeded to fry the pre-prepared momo dumplings.

Another disappointment came in when it transpired that soups were not available to be served along-side momos. Further, they declined Sodexo meal vouchers stating that they need more time to on-board and settle – as they are pretty much an infant in the business hub – Sector 5.

Further, since the place is too small, you can’t expect more than a bench to place yourselves – also, hygiene did not seem great.

Furthermore, the sauce served along with momos had a strand of hair in it – a sight which literally killed my entire appetite.

However, all my above regrets came to a stand when I put the 1st momo bite onto my tongue – and could experience them just melting on my tongue. This was indeed 1 of the best I had ever had – so low on oil, so tasty on stuffing and so high on taste. Damn! The 6 pieces of momo finished in a whisker!

Prices are reasonable and service is good – you do need to try out their stuff!

Most hygienic food when it comes to stall in sector 5. Loved their momo's thrice so far. Soup tastes pretty decent :) they give you a bill too. 50 bucks for chicken momo's.
