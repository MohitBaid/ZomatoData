The food quality is ok. But not satisfied with delivery. As I did not get what was mentioned. They provided normal rice instead of basmati, and gave 1 fish instead of two. And my add on mishti doi was also missing, but Zomato refunded add on amount. 

I ordered special fish thali. They have mentioned it includes basmati rice, 2 rawa roti, 2 pieces fish curry, shahi paneer, seasonal vegetables, aloo fry,, salad.

A week ago I ordered a schezwan mixed noodles through Swiggy. It was nicely packed. Even the container one can use later on. coming to quantity, it was enough for two persons. At last the quality, it tastes awsome. Looking forward of trying the other dishes.

Why the hell zomato not gives the option of negative rating!!

Ordered chicken meal thali. Just look at the quantity (picture below) of it. Don't you think it should be renamed to kid's special thali***

Coming to its quality.. Trust me the Indian railways serve better food than this crap.

I ordered Chinese thali twice. Once through swiggy and once directly. Both the times the quantity was very less. They provided a RS 1/- chocolate instead of sweet. Food was okay only.

On my recent visit to SaltLake, came here a couple of times. The food was consistently good, and the service was quick. The food is quite reasonably priced and I like the idea of their home/office delivery system.

The menu has decent variety ranging from indo-chinese to north indian. They also provide catering services - something to think about since their prices are quite low. 

Overall, I had a good experience, a good place to eat and I would definitely recommend it.

I visited Kolkata lately and went to Sector-V to meet my old friends. They demanded a treat and suggested Officer's Kitchen! I was reluctant initially, but at last thought to give it a try! Thank God for my decision!
The place is very hygienic and the staff gave us a warm welcome. The food is cooked in less oil and spices without compromising on taste. I would recommend their paneer makhanwala, methi malai chicken and afghani pulao. Last, but not the least, it is very much pocket friendly (I had to pay the bills :D )!!
