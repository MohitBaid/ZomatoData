I had a satisfying veg thali here ages ago and loved it. I was fairly new to the city and enjoyed my baby steps towards discovering Bengali cuisine. From the jhurjhuri to the aam doi to the simple aloo poshto, I savoured the simple meal. The veg thali is the perfect quantity of food.

সল্ট লেকের সেক্টর ৫ এলাকায় অবস্থিত । আকারে ছোট হলেও বেশ সাজানো গুছানো । ফ্রায়েড রাইস আর চিলি চিকেন খেয়েছিলাম । খারাপ লাগেনি । ব্যবহার ভালো ।

This small eatery was in my bucket list for a long days. From outside it looks very small but when you enter you'll find seating arrangement for atleast 15-20 people. We stepped in quite late around 2pm so maximum options in menu wasn't available. We tried the polao n chicken korma thali n there was a small gulabjamun also in the plate. 
Tastewise no complaints. The rice of the polao was of good quality. But they should include another curry item in the thali. Its hard to finish the polao only with 2 pieces of chicken korma.
Overall good experience and definitely would love to go there to try the rice thali.

Lunch  Stopper is located at Sector 5, Salt lake.

Ambience is nice with little sitting arrangements.

Service is quick .

Ordered mixed fried rice & Chilli chicken. Both were well cooked and tasty.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Overall a nice place.

ছোটর ওপর খুব সুন্দর একটি রেস্তোরা , বিশেষ কারও সাথে একান্তে কিছু সময় কাটাতে চাইলে এখনে বসে খাওয়া যেতে পারে সানন্দে , খাবার এর মানও আহামরি না হলেও ভালো । চিকেন কারি বেশ ভাল লেগেছে ।

Tried Pulao with Mutton Korma from this place. A rather less known place due to the lack of publicity, this outlet has a lot of combo offers going and attracts a lot of office goers due to the economical pricing. Located close to the Oxford Building, the place is relatively small though and cannot accommodate more people at the same time.

I used to get lunch at lunch stopper everyday when I was in college (IEM) break for its clean and home-made like food.I generally do not like Chinese food so I preferred lunch stopper, though they make Chinese food too.Missing lunch stopper with my frnds.Price is not so hefty.I will definitely recommend to those who want hygiene.

Today went there for lunch, we were four colleagues together. 
Located near oxford univercity, 10-12 people can accomodate only, so space is very small but very clean and tidy. 
We thought to have Chinese but they said that is not available only thali is available, never mind we ordered 3 poulav with mutton korma and 1 poulav with chicken korma, and misti mango doi. 
I must say its very reasonable and pocket friendly, quality and quantity both good. 
There is no tax or vat, our Total bill was 700 only. 
Looking forward to visit again :)

This cute as a button place is value for money and offers good food on a budget. He menu is limited and for lunch it's a pre set meal of yellow polau and chicken curry. The polau is much too sweet but the chicken is well made. The momo selection is wide and loved their chicken fried momos . Very good service.
