Ordered a margherita pizza, a plane & a cheese vada pav from the induction, bhawanipur today evening. Delivery took around 40 minutes.

It was waste of money. Quality of food was very bad. Pizza was bad! Cheese vada pav was even worse.

Very disappointing experience.

The Induction is a mixed bag. We ordered the induction special pizza, nachos, and pasta in pesto sauce. Long story short, the dishes went somewhat like this:
Pizza = amazing. Nachos = sub par. Pasta = average. 
The open setting is great for a quick bite in winter weather, and I would recommend this place only for the pizza. Pricing is reasonable as well.

This is located just opposite Laxmi Narayan nursing home near northern park. 
It is a street joint, where seating is available in open. 
Me n my sister ordered a pizza with mushroom n onion topping. It was just for 125/-.
The size was huge. I was surprised to see the size and it was amazing to taste. Didn't expect this quality from a road side joint. 
Next up, we took mix sauce pasta.  It was well cooked with correct flavors. Cheesy and juicy. 
Just the way I like. This was for 135/- for a bowl full. 
I took a cold coffee with ice cream, it was bitter sweet as I asked him to make. Served in a fat Mason jar. This was priced at 65/- only. @
The prices are unbeatable. The service is quick and proactive. Love the way they are energetic. 
It will become my frequent adda zone. 
Do visit if you are a vegetarian, you wrong regret unless you are high nose.

This place serves all veg fare ... Pizzas are just fine but the best dish here has been the macaroni and  cheese which is baked and served topped with a whole lotta cheese. Love the pricing but the food cannot be called restaurant standard. Ambiance wise this is a takeaway counter however there is some seating arrangement on the footpath in front of the counter in the form of stools and chairs. Not possible to eat here during the afternoon or during rains , this is mostly an evening ADDA . A very good value for money place . You haven't missed anything if you haven't eaten here.

This has everything you need for an evening snack, regular for localities. Presentation perfect, taste ok. Look and feel is good. Pizza and nachos is great here. Tried cheese vada paw this time, which was okiesh, didn't like the potato filling. 

Wanna try litti here next time. Best about this place is the economy and the peacefully road side eating experience of this varities of items, not generally available as street food in Kolkata.

Fast Food joints like these just make their orders thy dnt do tym pass so ppl give tym to prepare the food ,if there are lots of customers u do hav to wait but I m sure that wait will be worth cz at the end u will get good food unlike places whr u hav to compromise with the quality during rush hours...thumbs up

I had ordered for home delivery from this joint. I had ordered for the following things: 

1. Brownie Shake -  It just tasted like a chocolate shake that was too watery. No trace of brownie whatsoever. 

2. Penne Pasta in Pesto - The pasta was undercooked. The pesto was moderate but the cheese was stinking. So overall it tasted like it had gone bad. 

The food was delivered hot. The quantity is also good. But the food quality is below average.

Never go there when you are hungry. They will first let you starve and then serve. The food is good and worth trying though. The first time we ordered 3 different pizzas and garlic bread. Food was good but we had to wait for more than an hour.
I have my classes near this place so I thought of giving a second try and had a cheesy vada pav which was prepared in 20 mins and it had no cheese in it but only mayonnaise.

Situated beside the northern park, this place deserves a thumbs up. Being new joint in the locality this place has made its mark. I have had garlic bread that was good, oreo shake that was nice and pizzas here are awesome. This place is also famous for its vada pav. I had a great tym here. But one thing that pulls it down was the time they take to process the food. Hell lot of tym. Thy took nearly 20 min to serve me vada pav. Who the heck takes so much tym for a vada pav. But the wait was worth as it was gooood. But leaving that apart everythings just fine. Long way to go amigos.

I have ordered twice from here... Vada Pav and and Mexican Cheese Burger.
1st time I had given a benefit of doubt since they had just started, but not the 2nd time.
The time taken to process the order is infinite... My burger was served to me in 35 minutes precisely.
Moreover, the nomenclature of dishes does not represent the dishes served. The Bombay Vada Pav was served with Tomato Ketchup! And the Mexican Burger was served with an extra layer of so called 'salsa'.
The taste is rather average and doesnot leave behind any memories..

On my way back home from work i decided to stop and pick up a quick snack! Ordered chili cheese toast and bombay vada pav. It took 25 mins for the order to get processed and after all that wait, the food was v disappointing! Both the dishes had too much salt, so much so that u can only get the taste of salt and no other flavour of any other ingredient. I feel these are very basic dishes for any casual food joint and one should not go wrong here. Specially in a city like kolkata which is full of food joints which make awesome food, i feel this place will have to pull up their socks to survive. The only saving grace for this place is the price point which will attract students! I am never going again!

My office is very close by and for the past 3 years I always complained of not having any good fast food around the area offering good variety and taste. This place really surprised me when I decided to try it.. I have tried the chilly cheese toast the bet I have had till date anywhere and I was very curious how the pesto cheesy maggi would be and to my surprise it was delicious which could give any big cafe a run for its money. I think I'm going to try something new everyday to try the entire menu. The items are priced so reasonable and offers quality standard and Taste which is it's high point. A big thumbs up from my side !!

It might happen so that you may never come across this street stall. But hey? It's your loss if you happen to miss this place.

Doesn't pinch your pocket but your time as the food preparation takes a lil longer than expected. 
All in all, a good place for all the foodies out there. Must visit. 
Cheers üçΩ

Great place to be at in evening to chill with friends. It maybe little hard to locate when going for the first time. But trust me it's worth visiting this place. Tried Oreo shake and garlic bread here. 10/10 for them. But the thing that got my attention was the 15" pizza, and that too at such cheap prices with the toppings you want. And yeah, they don't ration while putting the toppings over the pizza unlike others.
Way to go guys. Keep up the great work!

Located in bhawanipur ( take the lane opp to my big fat belly, turn right and voila) the induction is a cute cosy kiosk serving snacks and fast veg food. The place recently opened a month back. The serve pastas, pizzas, sandwiches, icecreams and Indian snacks like vada pavs. I tried the following-

- cold coffee which was made well. Liked that they have branded their cups and glasses
- Penne pasta in pesto sauce. Was surprised to find a beautiful made creamy pesto. The owner assured me that the pesto was homemade! Brownie points for that!
- veg and cheese vada pav which were made in true mumbai style!

Overall was very content with the food! Prices are reasonable!
