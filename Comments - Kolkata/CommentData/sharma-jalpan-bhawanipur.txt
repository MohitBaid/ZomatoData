A unscrupulous shop where for the large cup of chai they won't fill up the cup and if you ask why is it not filled up they will say it will cost 5 rupees more.Will never visit again.

This place serves some damn awesome kachoris. The best kachoris that you will get in this area. This place is mostly crowded with Khalsa school students. Service is pretty quick. Everything is sizzling hot and fresh.

This is probably the best 'Sharma' I have ever ate at. Its located on the road opposite of Khalsa school. The kachori, singhara chaat are delicious. The lassi is not watery like other Sharma & is quite up to the mark! The place is bigger than most 'Sharma' & is pocket friendly too.
