I am not a biriyani guy because kolkata biriyani is aromatic and not flavourful....but to my surprise this particular joint gives a well package with perfectly seasoned rice.....value for money nothing fancy
It's only a take away

A small roll outlet although biriyani and kebabs are also available but kebabs hanging openly beside busy road I don't like. I tried a egg chicken roll. The service is very fast. The roll is very oily, you can see those oil on the surface of the roll very clearly. But the roll is very good. A large size with big tender pieces of chicken from top to bottom. The taste is really very good. Would like to visit again.

Just visited Nagerbazar yesterday and a friend of mine who lives over there suggested me this place for a quick snack..I must say the mutton tikia roll was very good which we had but one con is that its a bit oily... tastes good though with proportions of onions and capsicums amidst the minced meat...Good for a takeaway for those living over there cuz the place is congested..Service is fast as the name suggests..

One of the best roll makers in the dum dum area.I tasted the best of rolls here for the first time.They used laccha parathas to make the rolls.¬†They changed the concept of thin and tastless rolls by using the laccha parathas to make the rolls.
Even their normal egg rolls tastes heavenly.
They offer the best of rolls at the most affordable rates.And their biriyani and chaaps are also nice.

Heard a lot about A1 Haji . Was disappointed alot when I tried. Tried their chicken , veg and mutton roll. Not at all hygienic , not at all tasty , they put a lot of masalas in it like ajwain and all which worsen the taste . The food feels really heavy you wont feel like having anything for a long time after you had the food.  Everything is made in 'dalda'  so the aftertaste is not that good . Prices are much more than other ordinary food stalls but at this taste and quality prices are too much. Although they try their best to provide you the food asap also staff is polite . A lot of people do like it , so I would suggest you to try , you may like it...

I think most people who stay in Dumdum will agree with me on this, that this is one of the best Roll Centres in Dumdum.Yes the food is a bit oily and  they should really improve in that department ,but the taste is awesome..Situated in the heart of dumdum ,just a couple of minutes from the Dumdum railway and metro station,this place really deserves a visit..
The biryani is Ok,and I would recommend others to only stick to the rolls,kebabs and biriyani and not invest in other gravy items as it will really disappoint you..
Am going with three and a half stars out of five.

The Rolls are fabulous in A1 Haji. You should try at least once if you are staying in DumDum. The Biriyani is also very good. The only thing that make disaster in my belly was the Chicken Tikiya, too much heavy food and too much spicy & oily. Don't eat that. I prefer all kinds off rolls in this shop.

Went to this place to get some food as we were super hungry. Got a mutton biryani, a plate of mutton kasa and tandoori rotis packed. When we came back, oil was dripping out of the packages. The rice of the biryani was of a horrible quality. It had a weird smell and was overcooked. The biryani was super oily and the piece of mutton had only fat. The mutton kasa was not kasa at all. It was bones of mutton floating in a thin broth. Yes, there was no mutton at all, just huge bones. The only thing edible was the rotis. I wonder how come the restaurant is functioning in a locality, in spite of serving such horrible food!

The food . Well the food is oily . As in high cholesterol heart attack inducing oily. Their kebabs are okay. I don't like their biryani. But the thing they really sell through our the day and in gigantic nos are the rolls. The rate is cheap , a reason why they flourish despite making average food and good rolls. But this is no where close to the rolls we fell in love with back in the nineties. Have it for the rolls when you are in a hurry.

But the most fabulous,tasty,great biriyani only you get from here.
Yess sometimes you have to wait for a long time.

Chiken biriyani : taste,quality,quantity 5/5.
You can try egg roll,chiken roll and paneer roll too..

All the items are value for money. No waste.

And still,this is my one of the best biriyani destination after raj biriyani(chinsurah) and dada boudi r biriyani ( barracpore)

This is the best fast food centre in Dum Dum. The Rolls here are excellent. The biryani both mutton and chicken was good. The biryani was not too dry and oily. The laccha paratha which they also used in Roll is outstanding. This is the best laccha paratha in the city. It is soft and perfect. The price here is also reasonable. Had been there uncountable times. I never found this place empty. 
Overall a perfect place in Dum Dum for Roll and Biryani lovers.

The most unhealthy, high cholesterol fast food centre in dum dum area, yet a crowded place throughout the day. The more you try to avoid this kinda food, the more they appear in front of your eyes. However, the reason is very obvious as they truly serve very nice mughlai dishes with a very reasonable price. The most incredible item of this take away centre is their  mutton tikiya along with lachcha paratha. Also their biriyani is nice; you can choose any of the rolls with closed eyes randomly. But again, be assured you have to keep aside your thoughts on your lever, fat, cholesterol before putting the first bite.

The outlet is just a few minutes walk off the DumDum Metro towards Naagerbazaar. The place attracts quite a hefty crowd during the evenings especially for the rolls. Prices are quite cheap but what I felt was that the rolls were a tad bit oilier. Could have had done without that because the rolls taste quite well.

the rolls are not bad in the taste department..chap and tikias are average tasting..but the biriyani is horrible..

if u let the packet of biriyani cool down u will find dalda solidified in the corners of the box..

If you're near this place, and you don't buy yourself a chicken roll, please don't call yourself a foodie. 30 bucks for a mouth-watering chicken roll that fills you up pretty good. Totally worth it. Gets crowded in the evening. Try it. And you'll know why.

Don't know why everyone is giving a bad rating It has the best rolls you'll ever eat( though they don't make it as big as they used to ) Almost everything tastes good The paratha is the best ...its whats makes this place stand out Always swarming with customers ..good quality and rsnbl price ... its always crowded everybody near dum dum knows its the best place for rolls i specially love the chicken roll it has an awesome citric flavour which is just the correct amount and needless to say the gravy is good too one paratha is just about how any girl can eat combined with the tasty chicken chaap its a great dinner the kebabs too r very tasty eaten here a lot of times always eager for more...hope this place is always this great
