Searching for Authentic Japanese Food in Kolkata...
Wasabee will be your perfect destination...
It is a brand... It is a sentiment... It is a mark of quality... It is a mark of authenticity...
If you don't like Japanese... No problem... They also serves some extraordinary Chinese, Thai and Burmese too... 
Go and enjoy...

Was there on my wishlist from a long time. These place offers you some amazing oriental cuisine. Went there for the Khaw-suey festival. Loved the food and the service of the place. The place is well decorated with red and golden, loved the lighting. The service too was commendable. 
Tried their Singaporean Chilli Crab and Drunken Prawan in the starters. Loved the later one a bit more.
The Bento Box was something which was one of the best.
And the star of the day was the Lamb Khaw-suey.

Loved the place overall. Would recommend everyone to visit the place during the festival.

Pathetic place. Went for lunch @1pm
Not a soul. Sushi had overboiled inedible rice. Tempura was ok. Caramel custard was served in a tin foil. Servers would justify bad food rather than accept the poor quality. Value for money is a 0 on 10 I am assuming this as a normal dine and not din dine. Fresh ice cream had frozen icicles. I wouldn't give my dog this kind of food, let alone a human. 

Avoid and don't believe the bloggers review who "blog" on zomato for free meals. 

Cheers.

I visited this place for lunch with a group of close friends. Recently shifted to Sapuipara, this place was one of the very first restaurants to introduce Japanese cuisine to the city.¬†

The ambiance is amazing. The staff are very polite and courteous. They even have live sports screening. Overall, the management is very efficient.¬†

Coming to the food, we ordered a host of dishes. The Khow Suey festival is going on here till January 19th, so they have a lot of special dishes available.¬†

For starters and mocktails, we took Wasabee special, Drunken Prawns and Singaporean Chilli Crabs.¬†

For the main course, we ordered Khow Suey- Chicken, Pork and Lamb. We also ordered the Wasabee Special House Salad and a Bento Box.¬†¬†

The quantity was very impressive. The taste was even better !! The wasabee special drink was a mixture of three juices, and tasted too good. The Bento box had a variety of items, each of which was mind-blowing. The prawns and crabs were excellently prepared.¬†

Now coming to the main food for the festival- Khow Suey!! A delicious meal prepared with chow and meat in a bowl. The quantity as well as the taste was beyond perfect. I surely will go back here before 19th and have it again. It'd be a shame to miss it.¬†
The salad was very well prepared.

Lastly, we topped the sumptuous meal off with desserts- Vanilla, chocolate and black current ice-creams. Perfect ending to the lunch.

Wasabee is one of the foremost (if not the first) restaurants to introduce Japanese Cuisine in Kolkata. And being alien to the taste of relatively raw meat, it took me some time to start appreciating the cuisine, and I can't deny that Wasabee did help me in that. Recently, they have shifted their outlet to Sapuipara and have introduced a lot many new things on the menu as well. I visited the outlet during the Khow Suey festival which is being held from 9th Jan - 19th Jan and needless to say, I had a pleasant experience.

Orders:
1. Singaporean Chili Crab
2. Drunken Prawns
3. Thai Chili Fish
All of the starters were excellent in themselves, and I can't recommend them enough.

4. Wasabee House Special Salad came as a beautifully decorated plate with cucumbers, tomatoes and carrots dressed in their special sauce, with a tinge of Wasabee!

5. Bento Box comprising of Sushi, Sashimi, Tempura Prawns, Thai Green Curry with steamed rice and a mixed veg with wonderfully cooked Shitake Mushrooms. The sushis are less raw and more suited to the Indian palate, but I believe that's only to encourage more people to try the dish! I personally loved the idea of this box.

6. Pork Khow Suey was the major attraction of the day. There were various other options like veg, chicken, fish, lamb, prawn, squid, octopus and mixed meat and for a nice warm bowl of Khow Suey, the prices are quite reasonable. For the uninitiated, it's a Burmese one-dish soup compromising of noodles in a bowl of coconut milk served with a number of other condiments.

All this ended with a lovely bowl of Black Currant ice-cream!

Overall, totally recommend this place. I would have loved it if they stuck to authentic Japanese, however because of the dearth of such restaurants in the city even with so many outlets now offering the cuisine. However, the seafood they have on offer is excellent and this festival surely is a big attraction!

I haven't very been a guy who is into Oriental cuisine so that's why I never came to Wasabee which is nearly 10 mins walking distance from my home.

Suddenly I saw a banner nearby that Wasabee is hosting Khow Suey festival so I thought why not and try that!

This place is owned by Tabla Player Tanmoy Bose, started at October 2013.

Place was not huge and not so small. decoration was very beautiful and nice.

I ordered Wasabee Special drink (Orange based) and Apple soda (good).

From the starters I had Singaporian Chilli Crab,
Drunken Fish,
Thai Chilli Fish.
From those crab and chilli was was very good.

In main course I had Chicken Khow Suey (It was very good, and flavour was very lite).

I finished my Lunch with Black Current Ice cream.

If you're interested in authentic Japanese cuisines, this is your place, and they are presently having Khow Suey Festival. 

Ambience(10/10)
Service(9/10): An advice, please tell the waiters not to stare at the customers, it feel odd, really and we feel that I'm doing something wrong. 

¬ªStarters¬´
‚ú©Drunken Prawn(9/10): Fresh and wonderfully cooked. Tastes brilliant and has a wonderful blend of spices! A palatable starter, try it! 

‚ú©Singaporean Chilli Crab(10/10): This one will rattle up your taste buds with its awesomeness. A remarkable preparation and shows the chef's expertise. This is a must try foodies! 

‚ú©Thai Chilli Fish(8/10): A very good serve. Fresh fish and super tender and juicy. 

¬ªMains¬´
Wasabee Special House Salad(10/10): A bit on the sweeter side. Can serve 3.

‚òÖPork Khow Suey(9.5/10): You get options like chicken, lamb, fish, pork. Serves one easily and is very filling! The gravy is very good! Needed a bit more pork in it(-0.5) for that. You get condiments to decorate ur khow suey(see images)

Mocktails 
‚ô°Wasabee Special(10/10): This was super delicious and refreshing even on a winter afternoon. Adequately sweet. 
‚ô°Green Apple(9/10): Just took a sip, didn't want to have this much after the wasabee special. My friend had it. 

Ice Cream:Took black current. No rating, coz it's from a company.

So I visited this restaurant during their Khow Suey Festival to try this Burmese dish and just loved it.
We ordered Singaporean Chilli crab for starters and the Wasabee special mocktail both of which were very appetizing.
Then we ordered their in-house salad and Pork Khow Suey. The salad was amazing and the Khow Suey was perfect in taste. 
Finally we ended it with some ice cream.
The taste of the food is amazing and the staff are very courteous.
This place definitely deserves a thumbs up!

They shifted to Safuipara more some months back... As far I know they are Kolkata's first ever Authentic Japanese Cuisine Restaurant... I visited long back... At that time I don't have much knowledge about this particular cuisine... But as the time pass by... I learnt about this particular cuisine a bit... You will get amazed that Japanese cuisine is considered as the healthiest cuisine among all... As because they uses the raw or less cooked meats, fish etc for the meals... They cook the raw materials as less as possible and serves those very uniquely... Although most of the other resturants in Kolkata serving Japanese Cuisine is cooking the raw materials bit more to suit the Indian palate... Wasabee is not an exception... But they keeping it close...

Apart from Japanese they are serving Singaporean, Chinese, Thai and Burmese Cuisine too...
The Decor is Classy... Ambience is pretty good too...
Service is flawless... Sttafs are courteous...

Now coming to the food directly...
#Starters#
‚ù§ Pork Suimei~ Mind blowing...

‚ù§ Chicken Suimei~ Excellent...

So we ordered the following- 
Starters:- 
1. Pork suimei / chicken suimei 
2. Double cooked lamb 
3. Black pepper fish 
4. Yakitori fish 

Main course : 
1. Thai chilli chicken 
2. Red curry (non-veg) with steamed rice 
3. Singapore noodles 
4. Hong Kong fish 

Mocktails -
1. Mango rapture 
2. Tornado twist 
3. Shirley temple 

Dessert- 
Toffee walnut topped with vanilla ice cream. 

The food was amazing, it's been quite an experience. Definitely coming back to this amazing joint.

It was an unbelievable experience for any food enthusiast and I am delighted that we could start the New Year on such a gastronomic high.
Let's start with the mocktails- Mango Rapture, Tornado twist.
Mango Rapture was refreshing that belonged to the category of sweetness. While Tornado was more of mojito. Perfect to soothe oneself post heavy meal.
Starters:
Chicken suimei was served with an extraordinary dip that enhanced the taste of the dish. Loved it!
Black pepper fish was the best among all the other items. Soft,yummy and perfectly sauteed with sauce.
Double cooked lamb could have been better.
Mains:
Thai chilli chicken
Singapore noodles deserve special mention. They seem to be the finest version of noodles I've ever had. Super thin noodles like rice vermicelli they were.
Tasted better when we had them with chilly chicken.
Red curry non veg with steamed rice was heavenly. Perfect for wintry dinners.üëå
Speciality: BENTO BOX was unique served with prawn fries, Sushi with wasabee dip and rice. Adequate for one with higher appetite.üëç
Dessert:
Toffee walnut n vanilla. It was amazing.
P.S. you get to have loads of walnuts too! Loved the dessert.

A real nice place with soothing music,good ambience and an amazingly well behaved and helpful staff.
Dropped in for a dinner with family and here goes the menu:
Starters:

Easily locatable place, situated over Prince Anwar Shah Road Connector , exactly at Safui Para Bus stopage.

Since it was a new year , I wanted to have some good food , and was going through zomato for some high rated delivering restaurants near me and eventually Wasabee grabbed my eyes.

I ordered online , the item Crispy Chilli Babycorn Sweet Chilli in Basil Sauce as an appetizer . The taste was unique . The basil sauce added some sort of sweet flavour in spicy chilli babycorn making it incredible .

When it comes to the main course , I had ordered Egg Cantonese Noodles , Hakka Noodle Egg , Steamed Rice ,Josico Curry Fish , Josico Curry Tofu. The dish , Cantonese Noodles was unique. The rice noodles was packed in a different container and the gravy was packed in a different container. The Egg Hakka Noodle also tasted good, and the unique thing was that the egg noodles was topped with a thin layer of egg. Rice was also good.The Josico Currys were also outstanding. The mushrooms added more to the taste. Both fish and tofu were pretty much soft.
I ended my meal with a dessert - Caramel Custard. The taste was repleshing and was served in a beautiful manner . It was looking so attractive.
Every item satisfied my taste bud and I ended up craving for more.

The food was delivered hot and within time.
All over it was a ravishing experience and a delightful begining for new year.
Worth trying the dishes. :)

Wasabee serves you true Japanese and Burmese Cuisine which tastes delicious and looks amazing.
Located in Kalikapur suggest you to use Google maps for exact location as it's far for us North Kolkata peeps.
D√©cor replicates a traditional Japanese restaurant with traditional Japanese background music. 
Approx 50 Seater restaurant with positive ambience and really nice hospitality, service was also great.
Been here with a group of my friends to try some of their traditional Japanese dishes, let's see what i ordered - 
* Veg Sushi Platter - perfectly made with traditional ingredients.
* Veg Miso Soup - True Burmese Soup, perfectly made.
 * Veg Khao Pad - Thai fried rice, loved it.

If you‚Äôre looking for some authentic Japanese Food, this is the place to be. From the decor to the ambience to the food everything screams Japanese. 
Coming to the food, the sushi and the sashimi are a must try. And if you‚Äôre not a great fan of fish then the Chicken Yakitori is there for you which is like little balls of heaven ! The thai Chilli fish was really delicious but the highlight dish of the meal was the Chilli Pork dry ! It was tasty and melt in your mouth delicious . Then the Khao Suey, which is a Burmese dish, with it‚Äôs condiments was a brilliant dish to awaken your taste buds. The Kung Pao Chicken and Hot Garlic fish was perfect with the Seafood Fried Rice and it tasted simply awesome ! To quench my thirst throughout I sipped on Cranberry Cooler which was refreshing. Desserts left me speechless with their Custard and Black Currant Ice Cream. It was really sumptuous ! This place is a must try for me. Enjoy !

Located on the Price Anwar Shah connector, few minutes from Jadavpur Police Station, is this vibrant gem of a place, Wasabee. This is a treasure trove for those who love Japanese food and for those who do not, they can enjoy their delectable fare of Chinese, Burmese and Singaporean dishes. A couple of friends and I dropped at this restaurant for lunch and we had a lip-smacking experience.
For tried the shrimp sushi and crab sashimi which my sushi lover friends loved. I had chicken yakitori and it was delightful coupled with cranberry cooler. Thai chili fish turned out to be surprisingly good, soft on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside and the dry chili pork absolutely lip- smacking with it's succulent pieces of pork fat.
For the main course we tried the burmese khao suey first. It was stunning with the platter of condiments that came along with it. Next we ordered the seafood fried rice along with kung pao chicken and it was a delight to the palate.
We were full but refused to leave out on desserts. We ordered caramel custard and black currant ice cream. The caramel custard had a nutty flavour and a perfectly smooth texture while the black currant ice cream was a treat for my sweet tooth.
Overall, a wonderful experience - decent staff, gorgeous decor, soothing music and delicious food. What else can you ask for!

In main course,Khao Suey is a lovable burmese dish,one should definitely try this,brilliant.
Kung Pao Chicken was terrific in taste with the seafood fried rice,another recommended one.Hot garlic fish was lipsmacking.

In dessersts, Caramel custards were yummy,but what I likes most was the Black current icecream,it's wonderful.

Hot garlic fish- Fish could‚Äôve been more soft but despite of that it was tasty.
Virgin mojito- It was so fresh and refreshing.
Caramel Custard- Never been that fond of custards, but it‚Äôs caramel custard was mind boggling.
Black currant ice cream- Best one from the whole dessert thing, ice cream was amazing.

Special thanks to the amazing hospitality of the place for serving us pretty well.

Wasabee features as one of the top Japanese restaurant in Kolkata. And they deliver as promised. We dine out at Wasabee often and spread the good word and often overlook the very average non Japanese food.
Today I had a bitter experience. I visited the restaurant for a takeaway order. I was left waiting for a long time without anyone taking my order. I got up and requested the lady manager who was managing today and she told me to go and sit. Then a group of 7 people came in. And the lady manager was just falling over - but there were only 4 seats left. The lady manager told one of the waiters to seat them by any means. Now I was waiting for my order to be taken. This waiter comes to my table and I order for some plates of smoked salmon sashimi. I am told that it may take up to 1 hour. Now sashimi is the easiest thing to deliver - I have stayed in Japan and cook Japanese food.
I understood that the restaurant will go to any lengths to drive me out and seat some others.
I left on my own. A message to the lady manager - if you carry on like this, Wasabee will have to shut shop one day and you cannot show high preferences for some customers ignoring others.
Wishing all a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
Best Regards,
Dr. T. Nag.

A true Masterclass in oriental cuisine. Located conveniently on a busy Prince Anwar Shah Byepass Connector, just beside Garfa Safuipara crossing, Wasabee is now a favourite dine out destination. Curated with an aesthetic decor, the restaurant pampers you with great food and great service. The Seafood Hitachi Sizzler was tummy filling with fish, squid, prawns and steamed rice. 
The seating arrangement, the wall decor are just stunning.

Awesome ambience! A Japanese feel in the City of Joy. Food is excellent. The Teriyaki fish melts in your mouth! I could select from A varied range of oriental cuisine. The hospitality is spellbound as they also attended to my Gluten Allergy. Also their food doesn't contain Monosodium Glutamate. Thank you so much Wasabee! It was an amazing experience.

Great food and great service considering I had the order home delivered to 5 km off.. staff who took order on phone was very polite and so was the delivery man. It's amazing to see such good quality but reasonably priced japanese food in Kolkata- had no idea would get this here of all places- my request to other kolkatans please order from here and let the popularity of Japanese food grow..

Absolutely terrible. I ordered Tuna and Salmon sashimi, salmon maki roll and shrimp maki roll. The tuna was frozen, it had not been thawed properly and had ice crystals. Salmon was awful as well. The sushi rolls were too thick, and terribly tasteless. I really wish I hadn‚Äôt ordered it- worst sushi I‚Äôve ever had. Absolutely dismal.

Wasabee... again a food joint which made me feel proud to hail from Kolkata, where good food is prepared with care and appreciated equally. Stumbling upon this place proved to be a very pleasant experience for me, with the lovely cozy decor, the satisfying service and most importantly excellent food. The place specialises in Japanese and Thai cuisines as they claim. I did not have the opportunity to try out much, but from what I did, I loved most of it. The fried wantons were my pick of that outing. Had basic Chinese, which exceeded my satisfaction as far as flavours were concerned. Yes, the portions seemed to be a bit on the lower side, but then, that wasn't that big a deal. Will definitely visit again for more cuisines and I suggest the same for all. Specially loved the design of the menu card

Wasabee is one of my top favorites! Today I ordered Chicken Won Woan Sen soup and the taste was wonderful as always. But what is this? After eating up 70% of my bowl, I found a mosquito!! I don't know if that adds additional taste but as it was a Chicken soup, I was not expecting anything else apart from some veggies and mashrooms. I know it is not intentional. But it is never acceptable. I don't like mixed up ingredients. And as there is no mosquito dish on menu, I understand this is a hygene issue. Definitely it is not processed mosquito which can be safe to eat and digest! How Wasabee wpuld compensate if I get sick tomorrow as a result of this? My digestive system is very sensitive about these unhygenic practices.
I would keep this rating until I get served by them once again, clean and hygenic as I expect from a restaurant of their class.

Wasabee is a premier food joint for all those who loves Japanese, Burmese and Thai cuisine. This is a pretty looking outlet with a 20-30 seating capacity. Interiors are nicely decorated with red and white colour and all the tables are neat & clean and properly organized. Recently they shifted to a new location near Arya Vidyalaya in Kalikapur from their older outlet close to EM Bypass. They have some outstanding dishes in their newly launched menu and The Sushi & Sashimi platter and the Roasted Chili Pork are the dishes to die for. Me along with the members of¬† TeamPanchPhoron were invited in a food tasting event and the we were really amazed by the quality and and the quantity of the dishes. The dishes which were there are as follows : Tornado Twist, Mexican Sunset, Kim-chi Salad, Sushi & Sashimi Platter Non-veg, Wassabee Special Pork, Burmese Fish Curry, Singapore Mixed Meat Noodles, Kung Pao Chicken, Seafood Hibachi Sizzler, Thai red Prawn Curry, Toffee Wall nut with Ice-Cream and Japanese Tea .

Wasabee... Your destination for oriental cuisines. The place is well known for their excellent and delectable varieties of Japanese, Chinese, Burmese delicacies.¬†The interior is very impressive. Loved the decoration, music. The owners alongwith the staffs are very much courteous. Everything is on top notch.

Now Wasabee had introduced some great unique dishes which is really great in taste and had some twisted flavours into it.

Team Panchphoron was invited for the food tasting. Me alongwith my foodie blogger friends tried their dishes..And must say most of them are extravagant. Their Sushi and sashimi platter is a must try. All foods were very delicious and yes fresh.

So lets see what they are offering to us
¬∞ Tornado Twist - The drink is very appealing to look at. After the first sip you will find it really refreshing. Green I'm colour with right flavour in it.
¬∞ Mexican Sunset - Eye soothing drink. So very colourful. Made with orange juice and other added flavours into it. A real show stealer and very refreshing.
¬∞ Kim-chi Salad - Basically made of pickeled cabbage with soya sauce, sugar, garlic, chilly flakes and white vinegar in it. The salad tastes sweet and tangy. Very beautifully presented.
¬∞ Sushi & Sashimi Platter Non-veg - The Sushi consisted of Maki Sushi, Tamaki Sushi and Nigiri Sushi. And the Sashimi ¬†was comprised of Tuna, Salmon, Squid and Crab meat served with pickeled ginger, wasabee sauce, soy sauce. Loved the platter. It was yummy and very fresh.
¬∞ Wassabee Special Pork - Pan fried pork. The pork gravy is dry. It has the pork fat and chunks of pork pieces in it. Tastes bit spicy. The onion rings, the bell peppers made it more heavenly. I am totally in love with the dish. Lip smacking. Must must try.
¬∞ Burmese Fish Curry - Tried Burmese cuisine for the first time. And loved it. Soft pieces of fish on a bed of yellow gravy. The gravy consisted fish sauce, ginger, garlic and other spices as well. Tastes very nice. Interesting.
¬∞ Singapore Mixed Meat Noodles - Rice noodles cooked with perfection in soya sauce and other spices. Had lot of veggies and egg, chicken, pork in it.The noodles goes great with Kung pao chicken.
¬∞ Kung Pao Chicken - A very popular Chinese cuisine. Chunky pieces of chicken served with red gravy. The gravy was spicy and tangy. The gravy consisted bell peppers in it. Loved the dish.
¬∞ Seafood Hibachi Sizzler - I am always very fond of seafood. The hibachi sizzler consists of octopus, squid, fish. The dish was a total stunner. You will find colourful cabbage on the sizzler plate and full of other vegetables. Very delicious.
¬∞ Thai red Prawn Curry - Perfect mixture of ginger, onion, corriander leaves, tomato paste. The Prawn was good in size and was fresh. The curry tastes amazingly good.
¬∞ Toffee Walnut with Ice-Cream - Fresh vanilla ice cream scoop topped with toffee syrup and walnut on top of it. Perfect to end up your palate.
¬∞ Japanese Tea - Tastes great and very refreshing. The tea will instantly make you charged up.

Well do visit to the world of oriental cuisines. All the dishes were great in taste. All the dishes were very hearty and mouth watering. Thanks to Wasabee Management for the amazing hospitality.

So guys go and experience the oriental dish over there. And till then Happy Eating üòä

Starter: Chilli Pork Dry, Double Cooked Lamb, Sweet & Spicy Crispy Chicken, Calamari Rings (Squid) & Fish Pepper Salt.

Main Course: Thai & Burmese Chicken Curry with Rice.

Desert: Sizzling Brownie with Vanilla, Tutti Frutti & Caramel Custard.

What better way to start Bijoya!Subho Bijoya!¬†
Wasabee, one of the few restaurants in Kolkata which serves delicious Burmese and Thai dishes.¬†The decor is simple and elegant with a touch of Burmese and Thai tradition in it. The restaurant has a seating capacity of 45-50, a bit small. The seating arrangement is quite spacious though.¬†
The staff is courteous and always ready to assist whenever required or demanded.
Price of the dishes are a bit overpriced.¬†
Rs.1,300 approx for two (including GST)

If you want to really have some oriental cuisines while enjoying both Thai & Burmese tradition with a bit of music, this is definitely the place for you to be.

For the sumptuous and awesome dinner at Wasabee we decided to try something quite different.. It was a puja evening and we had pre booked a table.. Yes the dish we chose was yakisoba noodles.. Its a Japanese blackish noodle and we decided to go for the mixed meat version... We customised according  our liking and chose octopus nd pork as topping which the staff gladly accommodated... The noodle was a bit salty and quite unlike anything we had tried before.. The octopus was fresh and so was the pork..chicken was okay and specs of egg added a new dimension to the dish... All in all good.. However it cannot be shared by two and the quantity isnt adequate...so price extremely on the steeper side.. Staff extremely courteous and helpful.. Good for repeat visit if budget permits

Wasabee has re-invented themselves to serve the people of Kolkata better and probably in a way that suits the Oriental palate by bringing a diversity in their menu . The journey started with an offering¬† of various Japanese delicacies but has now spread its domain to include Chinese , Thai , Burmese and Singapore style cuisines that are promising enough to create an immediate impact on the way you view oriental cuisine as¬† a whole.

Wasabee has just shifted to a brand new, more noticeable location of Safuipara the Prince Anwar Shah Road connector, from its former location closer to Bypass. But location is not the only change it has undergone. There are some changes on their existing menu, as well as the addition of Burmese and Singaporean items, making this place the new destination for city foodies who are curious to try Oriental cuisine beyond just friend rice and chilli chicken. With the name of Tabla Maestro Tanmay Bose associated with Wasabee, the place has a unique decor that has touches of music here and there, alongside various Japanese elements here and there.¬†Coming to the food and beverages, the spread started with Virgin Mojito, Mexican Sunset and Shirley Temple, three refreshing mocktails. The dishes served for the lunch included a Sushi Platter; a Sashimi Platter; Tempura Prawns; Chicken Khow Suey; and Sea Food Fried Rice to go with Pak Choy Delight, Wasabee Saut√©ed Mushroom and Chilli Pork. And it all ended with two coconutty desserts, the Caramel Custard and the Fried Ice Cream.¬†I really enjoyed the Sushi Platter, which included Nigiri, Maki and Tamaki Sushis, each of which had a¬†different mix of flavours and textures. Now the Sashimi platter was the big surprise for me. I have had sushi before and loved it, but Sashimi is something I tried for the first time at Wasabee. It's raw seafood, and instead of strong, overpowering taste of raw seafood, I was surprised by some gentle and beautiful flavours. I also really liked the Khow Suey, with the taste of coconut and the aroma of lemongrass. What I really liked about the main course dishes was that each had its own set of tastes. Though they could do with some gentler flavours, especially the pork dish, I still liked it. And the seafood rice was an absolute stunner!Among the desserts, I became a fan of the Caramel custard almost instantly. It was silky in texture and had the right hint of coconut. The fried ice¬†cream also had a great texture. Most places tend to make the outer coating too thick and doughy, but that it was not the same in this case. The only complaint I have is that the coconut oil flavour in the ice cream was too strong. But, I suppose it is an acquired taste, as coconut or coconut oil usually is.¬†Altogether, it was a great culinary experience for me, trying out some of the finest dishes in Oriental dining. The place has the potential to be counted¬†among the best Asian restaurants in the city. As of now, it's a must-visit.¬†[Special thanks to Candid Communications,

Wasabee is very well known for the Japanese cuisine restaurant that it is. Ever since they have shifted to a new location very close to the old one ,they have added more special cuisines. The Burmese and Singaporean Cuisine have taken a place now along with the existing Oriental menu. I was invited here by Candid Communication and Foodie dada to have a pleasant experience of this beautiful restaurant. The restaurant is run by the Family of Pandit Tanmoy Bose and it simply has a spectacular atmosphere inside. I have really liked the interiors and seating arrangements here which gives a very polished finish. Coming back to the new menu options point ,well they looked very well appetizing and appealing but my bad that most of them i could not go through as i am kind of allergic to sea food .The food that looked so good even tasted great as i saw along with me my fellow bloggers were relishing it to the core.To say it now a bit brief way,over here the menu in drinks were VIRGIN MOJITO,MEXICAN SUNSET,SHIRLEY TEMPLE as stunners indeed with the right essence to refresh you totally.Personally I liked the virgin mojito among all and as it was made with the right punch of lemon,mint and aerated lemon.The Mexican Sunset and Shirley Temple were made with a fusion and were decent too but my choice is sorted as said.From the SUSHI Platters there was NIGIRI SUSHI,MAKI SUSHI and TAMAKI SUSHI. They were all well presented and gave everyone a good eat to digest i can say that very confidently.SASHIMI PLATTER was offered next which had four variants such as CRAB,SALMON,SQUID &TUNA presented in it's respective ingredients that seemed to be great also.After the platter came the specials like TEMPURA PRAWNS which was prawns marinated in ginger and garlic coated with tempura batter followed by frying it to a crispy texture.Then came the SEA FOOD FRIED RICE,PAK CHOY DELIGHT, WASABEE SAUTEED MUSHROOM & KHOW SUEY(CHICKEN) .The Fried rice was made pretty good and had a nice blend of taste and texture along with sea food specails.It went well along with the Choy delight which was a vegetable green dish made in a hunan style.The mushroom dish was also very tasty and i took a second serve to it as it went well with the rice again. However for me the dish that stands the best for the day would be the Burmese Khow Suey which had a nice portion of curried chicken,egg noodles,stirred along with coconut milk .It was served with it's garnishing elements and simply left me satisfied and happy to go through this,a big compliment to the chef for making it so fine. It ain't over until the desserts arrive. So the desserts to end it all was the CARAMEL CUSTARD & FRIED ICE CREAM. The custard was made very rich and sweet as well as looked well presented. The Fried Ice Cream was equally nice but I would prefer the custard over this any day.

Well that's all in the new and signature menu ,it was promising and a well made effort from the management ,i am looking forward for their future endeavors and such great experiences in time to come.

I had been planning to visit Wasabee for a long time especially for trying out their Japanese fare, but lately I found I have taken a bit too long to visit them since they closed down their old outlet and shifted from there to a new address at 30 Arya Vidyalaya Road (Garfa), not very far away from the older joint. And this time obviously I had to visit them since I was cordially invited by the management / PR for a food tasting session at this new outlet. As already said, I haven't been to their old outlet, so no question of comparison arises. This new outlet has a warm and relaxed ambiance with a positive vibe to it that helps you get into that zen mode in no time, it's that typical ambiance found in classy oriental joints spread across the city and elsewhere. At this joint, they have also introduced Burmese and Singaporean cuisines which I hope everyone will enjoy.

Coming to the food and beverages, we tried -

1) Virgin mojito: It was quite refreshing made with fresh mint leaves and lemon chunks topped with aerated lemon beverage, but there was an overdose of sugar which should definitely be checked.

2) Mexican Sunset: A drink that is both pleasing to the eyes and the palette, made with Orange juice, pineapple chunks and grenadine. Should be served chilled for a better experience.

3) Shirley Temple: A classic drink that comes with soda and grenadine syrup topped up with ginger ale.

4) Sushi Platter: It comprised of -

Nigiri Sushi - It is made of Nori sheet, short grain rice, wasabi paste filled with smoked salmon, crab meat, cucumberand asparagus served with Japanese soy sauce, Japanese pickled ginger and wasabi paste. I quite liked this.

Maki Sushi - It is made of Nori sheet, short grain sushi rice, wasabi paste filled with smoked salmon, prawn, avocado, carrot and finished with marine Japanese cooking wine, served with Japanese soy sauce, Japanese pickled ginger and wasabi paste.

Tamaki Sushi - It is made of Nori sheet, short grain sushi rice, wasabi paste filled with smoked salmon, asparagus, avocado, carrot, tofu and scallion and served with Japanese soy sauce, Japanese pickled ginger and wasabi paste.

5) Sashimi Platter - The platter comes with a variety of four different types of Sashimi, crab meat cured in Kani, salmon cured in sake, squid in Ika, tuna in Maguro and served with wasabi sauce, pickled ginger and sweet soy sauce. I really found them fresh and amazing.

6) Tempura prawns - These are fresh prawns marinated in ginger and garlic and coated with a thick layer of tempura batter and fried to a crispy perfection, served with a side of sweet chili sauce. But I would have loved it a bit crispier, though it was pretty flavourful.

7) Sea Food Fried Rice - A sea food lover‚Äôs paradise, this dish has a mix of shrimp, baby octopus, baby squid and vegetables wok tossed along with rice. Really loved this, highly recommended!

8) Pak choy Delight - A Chinese staple vegetable, the greens are prepared in the classic Hunan style. Really liked this one.

9) Wasabee Saut√©ed Mushroom - This is a Wasabee specialty, mushrooms are simply tossed in butter, oyster sauce, light soy and coarse pepper.

10) Khow suey (Chicken) - Although I won't go gaga over this, still this was quite a nice preparation of Khow Suey. Burmese Khow Suey is a traditional dish made with egg noodles, curried chicken and coconut milk. Served with a variety of condiments. Khow Suey is surely the first thing that comes to mind when you think about Burmese cuisine.

11) Chilli Pork - Though some of my fellow foodies loved this preparation of Chilli Pork but I found some scopes of improvement out there in this dish. It had a serious overdose of Soya sauce which marred the charm of the dish, though the pork in itself was very well cooked. Hope this point will be taken up positively and the dish will be improved.

12) Caramel Custard - This classic dessert comes with a twist at Wasabee! Light on the palette yet rich in flavors this is a must try according to me.

13) Fried Ice Cream - A dessert which I really love to have. Here it's a Chef‚Äôs specialty dish, it comes in a variety of flavors although the coconut milk flavor is the most unique and talked about. I quite liked it and the presentation was truly appreciable.

That concluded my meal and I would really love to see this place grow, more because of their reasonable pricing, warm ambiance and a huge spectrum of Oriental cuisines which few places in the city serve. In the vicinity, definitely there is no other place having all these points checked. Hope the comments mentioned in the review will also be worked upon and this place will flourish in the coming years. My best wishes are with the team!

Cheers!

Wasabee should be your one stop for Oriental cuisine. They have a new address. And we were invited for a food tasting session. In addition to their Oriental cuisine, they also serve Singaporean and Burmese cuisine.¬†
Our afternoon begun with mocktails - Shirley Temple, Mexican Sunset, Virgin Mojito.

This was followed by the sushi and sashimi platter. The fish was completely cured before passing it on to us, accompanied with some wasabi paste and pickled ginger. Tasted delightful especially when we are such big fans of sushi!
Next up, the seafood fried rice which paired well with the chilli pork (which was outstanding!!) and the pak choy delight!

Must try: Khow suey (Chicken)

Burmese Khow Suey is a traditional dish made with egg noodles, curried chicken and coconut milk.¬†

The desserts also didn't fail to surprise us - the caramel custard was outstanding! They had added their twist to this - coconut. Yes, the added coconut to their caramel custard, and it was not at all dominating, and tasted divine

The Fried Ice Cream
 was the second dessert, and it was a complete vegetarian one which is difficult to find. A Chef‚Äôs specialty dish, it comes in a variety of flavors although the coconut milk flavor is the most unique and talked about!

Do visit Wasabee for a fresh burst of Oriental flavors!

Love Oriental cuisine or have an ardent fondness for Japanese dishes like Sushi and Sashimi? Then, Wasabee is the place for you to be. Wasabee has moved to a new location on 30 Arya Vidyalaya Road, Kalikapur, Kolkata, and now its revamped and bigger. As such, they have also come up with their new set of menu, and you are going to love the food here. This Saturday, I paid a visit here and tried quite a several options from the menu, and I can tell you they do justice with authentic oriental cuisine. I started with the Virgin Mojito which was refreshing and its taste was just perfect for me as such the sweetness and the minty flavors were balanced. However, the other drinks such as the Shirley Temple and Mexican Sunset, although looked great and were refreshing, I found them to be on the extra sweeter side.
The Sushi platter and Sashimi Platter are bound to woo you, taking note of the authenticity, presentation and taste. They come in suffice quantity, including smoked salmon, tuna, crab, prawn and vegetable varieties. These were my favorites.
Tempura prawns served with sweet chilli sauce were my next favorite. Perfectly fried, crispy and the prawns were fresh and tender to eat.
Sea food Fried Rice tasted a delight with all sorts of sea food starting from prawns to fish to octopus. I had it with Chilli Pork and I absolutely loved it.
The Pok choy delight and Wasabee Sauteed Mushrooms were the other dishes that were there, and tasted quite good.
Next came the Chicken Khaw Suey, which indeed can be called the bowl of happiness. This is a Burmese speciality and it was served with a variety of condiments and spices to be mixed in the bowl full of egg noodles, curried chicken and coconut milk. It is filling enough, and I feel one bowl is enough to fill a person for one time. I loved its taste and presentation.
The desserts come next. The Caramel Custard was beautifully presented, and tasted creamy enough.
The fried Ice cream was the next to arrive. It comes in a variety of flavors, However I went for the coconut milk one, and I loved it.

I hav had heard a lot about this restaurant but couldn't get the time to dine in here. So today I ordered wok fried mix meat noodles and grill calamari squid sushi for myself. First and foremost the order was really quick. The food seem tempting.
The quantity is completely worth for money. The quantity was huge for the noodles n sushi both.

But according to the taste it didn't seem to have satisfy my palate. No doubt the sushi were really good.The squid were really well cooked. But the noodles seemed a bit bland. Although it was full of prawn n mix meat but the taste didn't seem to hav satisfy the palate.. 

Never the less, looking forward to dine in sometime to taste the best of wasabee dishes.

Locating this one was a challenge, Google maps/ Zomato points to it's previous location which is more than half a kilometre off this new one, it is near the Safuipara Garfa and Bypass connector crossing. The decor had a typical South-east Asian feel, and the seats comfortable. The capacity is low and can well be packed on rush days. The service staff is prompt and informed, well mostly. We ordered crab meat soup which just had ready to cook crab meat in it -- on a side note I had bought this very crab meat wrap from Metro Cash and Carry a while back. Coming to the sushi platter we ordered, well, it wasn't as good as it looked on the plate. We had some fun with the chopsticks and then stuck to our friendly spoon and fork. Sushi in India is generally very bland and it was something similar here, the sushi sauce (the green one) however stings like a bee. One starter we really liked was the roaster lamb in oyster sauce, the lamb is shredded and juicy and the dish pretty good. For the main course we had flat rice noodles (mixed meat pad thai) and Pla pad phak (fish preparation). Both these traditional dishes were awesome and at the end of it we were too full for dessert.
Would love to try out the other dishes sometime.

Visited this place for the first time on 2 September 2017. Sat for 10minutes before we got the menu. When we got the menu sushi not available, suimai, wanton will take time 30mins, khao swey will take 40mins and the list goes on. The only things available readily are the chinese stuff ....... why is the name of the restaurant Waseebee and why does it claim to be serving asian cuisine. Service staff seem reluctant to serve anything besides chinese. Taste of food bad. ASIA KITCHEN, MAINLAND CHINA will still be my choice if I want good food with good service.

‚ÄúBest Oriental Meal in Kolkata"

I can't stop thinking about that feast. That epic and seemingly endless carousel of flavours. I'm trying to remember what I ate - dish after dish bursting with flavour, each one different from the other. I am glad I took some pictures to remind me. It is the best Oriental restaurant in Kolkata - and I have eaten my way round this town for decades. The service was excellent. The food was exceptional. I recommend that you skip lunch if you are going to visit this place for dinner. Outstanding place. Will visit again and again !!!

I have had sushi and sashimi in India and away. Today we ordered crab sashimi from Wasabee through Zomato and to our surprise all we received was rock solid frozen crab sticks which we get in any hyper mall. As a bonus one of the crab stick even had the plastic cover, the restaurant team did not even had the patience to unwrap it. We were charged over 800 bucks for the inedible sashimi, even a 250 gms packet of frozen crab sticks costs you over Rs 250. 
When we called up the incorrigible restaurant staff they confirmed that they serve frozen crab sticks as crab sashimi. 
The worst restaurant food I ever had. They are delivering cheap inedible craps and charging exorbitant rates. 
Friends if you are planning to visit this place please don't. Value for money is zero. And you might have to go to sleep on empty stomach.

Wasabee is a place very easy to locate as it falls on the main road. It has an amazing service. The food is served on time and people are always available for help. One of the best foods of this restaurant are- Chilly baby corn and the soup served. 
   The food is yum and am highly satisfied with it. I have been there just once but am very satisfied. 
Instant cake is available... It has a simple but nice decoration with a nice environment. Would look forward to this place again.

Hi Everyone !!

I dont know how to describe this place. Generally in Kolkata hardly any restaurant maintains its pristine condition and good food for years together. But this restaurant does. I am into Thai and Chinese food. And i have never had better experience with these food than here in all of India. And i had food all over India ( north and south ) and mostly in 5 star hotels. So I know what i am talking about.

Now for the service. I never had experienced such a genuine service person like Mr Bhowmick ever. He not only guides you, listening intently about your taste but always helps you to choose the best meal. And in the 20 times that i visited the place, i have never been dissapointed but one time.

I absolutely recommend this place. 
Keep up the good job Wasabee !

Had gone there for lunch. Ordered the salmon skin roll sushi, calamari squid sushi, prawn tempura, and josico curry (seafood).
The sushis were pretty good. The portions were fine, and the fish was fresh. Wasn't expecting such generous helpings at that price. The prawn could have been better. Wasn't so much prawn tempura as batter covered prawn. Tasted good though.
The josico curry was a disappointment. Not comparing it to any other such curry, but simply the plain texture did not sit well after such an exciting entre.

Coming to service, the place is spectacular. The manager as well as the waiters are polite, happy, and very welcoming. Definitely made a huge (positive) difference to the meal.

Would not recommend this place for the Chinese cuisine as everything but the starter tasted pretty bland.
Place has a good ambiance though with soft music playing & a light decor but the food, well not much to say about that.
The fried rice tasted like boiled rice (that too not properly) with a few shredded chicken pieces. Finding chicken in the noodles was like winning the lottery. Kung pao chicken was like boiled chicken in a broth, neither spicy nor tasty.
The only redeeming factor was the starter pepper chilli fish which was succulent and tangy.
With 2 nearbuy coupons for 3 people we clearly weren't satisfied but atleast it didn't burn a hole in our pockets.

After trying a portion of soup few months back, today I ordered a Japanese non-veg combo for 2 with good expectations. Well they didn't disappoint me. In 1.2K INR it was quite a good menu starting with appetizers ending to a dessert. I didn't dine in so would not comment on the service and ambience part. The delivery was quick and the delivery person was smart enough to locate my home with minimum instructions. Packaging was perfect. No negative as such in terms of food quality and quantity. But quality was not upto the soup that I tried on first day; probably that is the typical compromise in combo meals over a-la-kart√©. From price perspective also this combo was a good value for money where as the soup was quite costly.
Would look forward for a dine in experience some day.

After realising that there is not enough option in Kolkata for Japanese cuisine, I ended up in Wasabee.
Well the d√©cor is quite simple and neat, not overdone. Cutting straight to the food quality - tried Volcano Sushi with baked Tuna - which was pretty well baked and hair-raising spicy! A delight.
Next was Stir Fried Udon Noodles with Mixed Meat. Pretty well garnished and decorated platter was served, sided with equally tasty Fish Teriyaki.
The pricing is a bit high-ended. But one may find too difficulty in getting an authentic Japanese cuisine at price of Chinese.
A must-go for food-lovers and health-conscious people.

Now Wasabee has a new address. The restaurant has shifted to Garfa and now Wasabee is bigger and better. They have introduced to new cuisines to their menu. Authentic Burmese and Singaporean dishes have been included . There are the Burmese Khowsuey, Singaporean Style noodles.
The Khowsuey is one of the best, I have tried.
I need to specially recommend the "chilly pork" which was tender, amazingly seasoned.
There are also the old favorites, sushi and sashimi and the jazz Jambo prawns. 
The sea food fried rice was flavoursome .
The pak Choi delight was indeed delightful.
Apart from the food their menu has also included some cocktails.
Now coming to the dessert, tried their caramel custard, which is indeed different from the mundane custard because of a secret ingredient ( you need to try this custard). The fried ice- cream too tastes different and is a chef's special.
The ambience is also soothing as the interiors is tastefully done and perfectly blends with the south  east Asian cuisine which the restaurant specialises in.

Had food there, though it was pretty away from the heart of the city but I can bet you their food will make you astonish. From the beginning they welcomed us really in a great manner then the soft drinks made us cool. Next the delicious sweet corn soup was served with a starter preparation which made us happy and everything went out from our mind. Now it was the time to take main course that is noodles and fried rice with kong pau chicken, that was unbelievable really mouth watering dish and at last the desert was served very finely and we're very happy that they helped us a lot to make this day memorable.
However, I would like to thank all the staffs for nice serving and off course for your food.
I'd also like to recommend everyone to take a opportunity to taste the dishes at least one time and I can bet you will fall in love again n again with this restaurant.
How many words I will write may not be adequate to describe, but looking forward to see you again and this time I'll go for the Japanese cuisine.

Wasabee is my first gateway to the world of Japanese gastronomy. It is well situated near Kalikapur-Abhishikta point. They are equipped with car parking space. The restaurant is in first floor. And it is very spacious and well maintained. The behaviour and gesture of every staff have been polite and decent. They welcomed us with chilled aerated soft drinks. Now comes the food. I wanted to try from their Japaneae spread so did not bother even looking at other sections in their menu. We were two so, went ahead from their 'combo for two' section. We chose The Deep Blue Sea. It starts with non-veg Miso soup. It contains different types of exotic veggies, sea weed, mushrooms, tofu, chicken and ofcourse few delicious creatures from the deep. Next. the bento box arrived. It contains six pieces of sushi of your choice, two generous portions of sashemi, two prawn tempuras, decent amount of rice, a chicken mild curry and one portion of lovely exotic vegetables mix. The condimentum comes with the notoriously beautiful wasabee, ginger stripes and soya sauce. We began with Sushis with the help of the chopsticks. The wasabee was refreshing enough when chewing the sushis. We could exactly feel the hell in our nasal cavities. Sashemis were made of salmon and well marinated. The prawn tempuras worked like plot relief. The rice with chicken mild curry was good. And the veggie curry was outstanding. After we finish the bento box, we're offered desserts. There are only two options. Caramel custard and icecreams. The pocket pinch is worth according to the food and ambiance. Overall Wasabee is indeed a nice place to serve your taste buds and especially the nostrils with sumptuous  Japanese sea food. Thank you.

Located on Kalikapur on the left while coming from Spencers towards Jadavpur.I would recommend the food lovers to try out their weekend buffet (combo of Japanese + Thai+ Chinese) which is much much better in terms of taste and rates than their ala - carte menu. Be concious, when you try some Japanese sauce - they are so strong in terms of smell and taste :).

Located at kalikapur, Wasabee is a Japanese cum Chinese restaurant. I've been here on a number of occasions, mainly availing the nearbuy coupons. I've had their chinese set menu meal. The place is fairly spacious, ambiance is very nice, with good music being played all the time. The service is very good, staff is very friendly and helpful.¬†
The pepper garlic fish and kung pao chicken from the set menu require special mention. The quality of food is also good.¬†I plan to try the sushi once. One should definitely drop by sometime to have a good a dinner.

From the beginning they welcomed us really in a great manner then the soft drinks made us cool. Next the delicious sweet corn soup was served with a starter preparation which made us happy and everything went out from our mind. Now it was the time to take main course that is noodles and fried rice with kong pau chicken, that was unbelievable really mouth watering dish and at last the desert was served very finely and we're very happy that they helped us a lot to make this day memorable.
However, I would like to thank all the staffs for nice serving and off course for your food.
I'd also like to recommend everyone to take a opportunity to taste the dishes at least one time and I can bet you will fall in love again n again with this restaurant.
How many words I will write may not be adequate to describe, but looking forward to see you again and this time I'll go for the Japanese cuisine.
Regards

Wasabee is my first gateway to the world of Japanese gastronomy. It is well situated near Kalikapur-Abhishikta point. They are equipped with car parking space. The restaurant is in first floor. And it is very spacious and well maintained. The behaviour and gesture of every staff have been polite and decent. They welcomed us with chilled aerated soft drinks. Now comes the food. I wanted to try from their Japaneae spread so did not bother even looking at other sections in their menu. We were two so, went ahead from their 'combo for two' section. We chose The Deep Blue Sea. It starts with non-veg Miso soup. It contains different types of exotic veggies, sea weed, mushrooms, tofu, chicken and ofcourse few delicious creatures from the deep. Next. the bento box arrived. It contains six pieces of sushi of your choice, two generous portions of sashemi, two prawn tempuras, decent amount of rice, a chicken mild curry and one portion of lovely exotic vegetables mix. The condimentum comes with the notoriously beautiful wasabee, ginger stripes and soya sauce. We began with Sushis with the help of the chopsticks. The wasabee was refreshing enough when chewing the sushis. We could exactly feel the hell in our nasal cavities. Sashemis were made of salmon and well marinated. The prawn tempuras worked like plot relief. The rice with chicken mild curry was good. And the veggie curry was outstanding. After we finish the bento box, we're offered desserts. There are only two options. Caramel custard and icecreams. The pocket pinch is worth according to the food and ambiance. Overall Wasabee is indeed a nice place to serve your taste buds and especially the nostrils with sumptuous  Japanese sea food. Thank you.

Located on Kalikapur on the left while coming from Spencers towards Jadavpur.I would recommend the food lovers to try out their weekend buffet (combo of Japanese + Thai+ Chinese) which is much much better in terms of taste and rates than their ala - carte menu. Be concious, when you try some Japanese sauce - they are so strong in terms of smell and taste :).

Located at kalikapur, Wasabee is a Japanese cum Chinese restaurant. I've been here on a number of occasions, mainly availing the nearbuy coupons. I've had their chinese set menu meal. The place is fairly spacious, ambiance is very nice, with good music being played all the time. The service is very good, staff is very friendly and helpful.¬†
The pepper garlic fish and kung pao chicken from the set menu require special mention. The quality of food is also good.¬†I plan to try the sushi once. One should definitely drop by sometime to have a good a dinner.

Had been to this place on 1st October,2016,on my brother's special day. We went for a 6 course non-veg Chinese meal with add-ons .The decor was nice with the perfect, if I may say, 'mood lighting'. Soothing soulful music of 70's played along. Out of the food we had that day, the Hot garlic prawns stand out as simply overwhelming. The Hakka chowmein and Chicken fried rice were inviting. All in all a fond memory.
The waiting team were courteous and mannered. The manager on duty was a perfect gentleman and bid us adieu on our way to the cab.
Ambience-4/5

Looking forward to meet you and this time ala carte'.

N.B- I have written reviews of this place before, which I don't know how, it got deleted. Some tech prob?

Visited for Ashtami dinner as I love coming back to this place again and again. Staffs were courteous and the service was quick even during this busy time, this really deserves an applaud. Chicken Khao Pad was delicious along with Thai Chilli Prawn. Chicken Wanton, Roasted Pork with Pok Choy was great. Love to come back again....

This is a Japanese, Chinese and Thai food restaurant located near Kalikapur...Very well decorated restaurant. We went there after buying coupons from nearbuy. We bought 6 course non veg chinese meal..we were served -coca cola
,Chicken sweet corn soup. Pepper garlic fish, Chicken hakka noodles, Chicken fried rice, Kung pao chicken,Hot Garlic Prawn, and Ice Cream..foodwise no complaint everything ¬†was good specially the starter-pepper garlic fish.. Considering the prices food was above average ...BUt service was a big letdown ..The waiter serving us was very rude..They almost take more 40 minute for main courses ..After finishing our starter they refused to change our plate when serving main courses..felt really cheap..anyone who gives service more importance than price should avoid this place....

wasabee is named after a spice called wasabee. the place is located in kalikapur near avishitka housing complex. the ambience is simply great and the behavior of the staffs are unmatched. they offer buffet as well. the chineese and thai dishes are something to look upto. this place can be a little harsh to you wallet but the food is worth it. must try are thai green curry and jasmine rice

A well decorated restaurant. We went there after buying coupons from nearbuy. One of the nightmare dinner it was.food-: We bought five course non veg chinese meal1. Soft beverage : coca cola was served.¬†
2. Chicken sweet corn soup: Quite good.3. Chicken hakka noodles: Not at all good. Seems like boiled noodles with some salt.¬†
4. Pepper garlic fish: Not good.5. Chicken fried rice: Quite good.
6. Kung pao chicken: Horrible
7. Ice ream: Good.

Quantity of rice and noodles was very poor. We bought two coupons but they served in one bowl.¬†Will never ever visit again. Highly not recommended.

All that glitters is not gold- and yet again the age-old proverb seems so apt while speaking of this place.. When you go to a restaurant named after one of the most significant ingredients of Japanese Cuisine you expect a quintessential array of Japanese dishes.. sadly this place seems more like an amateur when it comes to Japanese dishes but surprisingly they seem to go well with the more popular Indo-Chinese recipes.. Located on Kalikapur Main Road, it‚Äôs easy to locate and closer to the byepass connector..
Coming to the interiors, well this place is elegantly decorated with the musical posters on one side which shows the preference of the Owner being a renowned musician himself.. Also the presence of Chinese and Japanese artefacts sync perfectly with the cuisines served here.. This place is so colorful and exudes a vibrant feel.. Service was also spot on, may be because the place was mostly vacant.. Since we went with two Nearbuy vouchers, hence tasted the following:
Aerated Soft Beverage: Always a nice way to refresh up for the grand affair..
Chicken Sweet Corn Soup: Nice and subtle flavors as it should be.. the broth was consistent and tasteful..
Chicken Miso Soup: This soup gives you a meaty, earthy flavor yet not much use of spices as such.. could have been better as I felt they have way too many cabbages overpowering the broth..
Pepper Garlic Fish: 6 pieces of juicy, succulent yet crunchy basa fillets sauted with garlic, bell peppers and onions..
Nigiri Sushi (Salmon): Well I didn‚Äôt have high hopes since this single dish requires the culinary skills of highest order but I was pleasantly surprised as the Sushi tasted good actually.. slightly roasted and the wasabi was indeed strong..
Yakitori Chicken: Aweful to say the least.. extremely disappointed as this dish never tasted like authentic yakitori.. more like crispy chicken cubes in skewers..
Chicken Hakka Noodles: This was the only decent enough staple served.. the noodles were light and long.. not oily like the usual hakka noodles at some place..
Chicken Fried Rice: Well found Chicken in this dish only in the name.. jokes apart proteins were not present in sufficient quantity and it tasted as if few chicken chunks are mixed with steamed rice..

Kung Pao Chicken: After a few horrific tastes, this dish actually satiates our taste buds.. balanced in flavors and liked the tanginess of the dish..
Hot Garlic Prawns: 4 medium sized tiger prawns served for a meager price with nearbuy voucher is indeed commendable.. but felt that the batter on the prawns were a bit too thick and the sauce need a bit more work..
Chicken Udon Noodle: Traditional Japanese wheat noodles cooked with authentic spices and veggies.. well this dish was so salty that we couldn‚Äôt even finish it.. enough said..
Golden Curry Octopus: Served with Steamed Rice, well this was indeed a relief after having a series of below par dishes.. I was skeptical of ordering octopus at first, but it turned out to be the dish of the day.. has a strange similarity with our Bengali curries which is quite surprising.. not overdone with spices but packed with flavors..
Vanilla Ice Cream with Chocolate Sauce: The ice cream has melted almost 20% by the time it reaches us..
Overall it was indeed the cheapest possible lunch of Rs.1200/- (all incl.) for 4 people, but if you are going without any voucher, then it is one of the costliest affair given the high cost of Japanese ingredients and spices..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 2/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

Great place for seafood. Love their sushi. 
Request to make the ambience better.  There are buffet available which are not listed on regular menu, please ask for the same. Try the tempura. Alas, since there in no bar, dont expect Sake (the drink). Please add Sake or some wine to your menu, this will take you to a different level.

The food was really nice.  The ambiance was kind of Okay. If you are looking to dine at an affordable cost and relish the taste at the same time,  this is the place. However the staff is not courteous at all. In my case the staff was very rude and I had to call the manager for that purpose . If you wanna try Japanese cuisine,  this place is right for you. I took a coupon from Little deals and enjoyed the food at a very reasonable price.

What a disgusting meal me and my friends had there !! We were served rotten chicken and the noodles were made out of Maggie noodles !! Moreover when we complained ,the restaurant staff instead of cooperating completely denied our allegations even after tasting the food.My friend's birthday lunch at wasabee, completely destroyed her mood and ours too.Even after charging such amount of money ,they so casually served unfresh food.Only the starter was served fresh and edible.Previously they did not serve like this.I hope they work on improving their quality as the quality of the food do not match the ambience of the restaurant.

Wasabee comes up among the first results when you search for Japanese cuisine in Kolkata. We wanted to try Japanese, so ended up here for lunch and asked for the non-veg combo (you have to ask for it, as it is not in the menu).
It was a large spread. Firstly, we were served miso soup which was light and easy on your tastebuds. Then salmon sushi rolls. I was a little sceptical because my sushi experience so far wasn't good, but here sushi was great! Must try.
Later came yakitori fish ( this was mouthwatering, another must try ), udon noodles ( with lots of veggies ), and golden chicken curry with rice.
Lastly, they served custard, which I wouldn't recommend.
The food, its quality and quantity, didn't leave for anything more to be desired. It was sumptuous and quite delicious .
Service was formal, functional. The decor contemporary and bright, which makes the ambiance rather stark. That aside, it is a great food joint.

My first ever experience with Nearbuy coupon and it turned out to be pretty good. Very easy to spot on this place, Wasabee definitely deserves brownie points for their ambiance and the decor. Lovely paintings, giving an authentic traditional feel. As per the Nearbuy coupon, we were served with aerated drinks and then we had chicken sweet corn soup, a fish starter (uhh, forgot its name!), mixed fried rice and noodles, chili chicken and a prawn item and ice cream for the dessert. The food was certainly delicious and filling, but I felt the quantity was a bit less. But anyhow, I enjoyed my meal there and I really appreciate the courtesy of the staff members there.
Will surely be going again, Very soon! :)

Wasabee.....anytime you hear that word, the first thing that strikes your mind is a strong, greenish sauce which is very well associated with the famous Japanese Sushis.....and when a restaurant is opened by its name, you know very well, what you are in for....This outlet is bang on the main road of Kalikapur EM Bypass connector, which seats comfortably over 50 people, has simple but classy d√©cor right from the stairs to the interiors‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs easy to locate and it‚Äôs a Asian joint serving Chinese, Japanese and Thai delicacies, some of which are a little hard to find in the city

Anytime is a see a generous deal over the internet, the first thing that strikes my mind is that the place probably is not doing too well or as well as it expects‚Ä¶..off course it‚Äôs a gimmick used by the new restaurants which open up every day but the secret here is that they only use it for a few days while Wasabee has been in the market for some time now and it seems like the deal is pretty never ending‚Ä¶..so got a deal through little app, shelled out mere 449 bucks for‚Ä¶.2 soft drinks, 2 chicken sweet corn soup, a fish starter (6pcs)‚Ä¶a prawn main (4pcs)‚Ä¶a chicken main (6pcs)‚Ä¶a chicken fried rice, a chicken noodle, 2 ice-creams‚Ä¶can you believe it people, yes all of that for only 449 all inclusive‚Ä¶.so I was all the more confused but more curious to know what is going on‚Ä¶.that ventured me to this place, on a extremely heavy rainy night of 5th Sept, when more than half of the city was washed away, we visited this place with the 2 coupons pre-booked‚Ä¶.

To our dismay, the place was pretty empty, yes it was on a Monday with heavy rains outside but it was a holiday and I surely expected more people inside‚Ä¶.we were greeted and seated in a table for 6 (we were 4 adults and 2 kids) I spoke to the manager about our deals, showed him the barcode and he obliged‚Ä¶.and once we sat, in not much of a wait time, came the food, one after the other‚Ä¶.small glasses of sprite (I guess there is no choice there)‚Ä¶sweet corn soups which were thick, a little under seasoned with egg drops, chicken chunks and tasted delicious‚Ä¶.it was perfectly warm and we relished it with Joy‚Ä¶.a perfect start for sure‚Ä¶..the next was the pepper garlic fish‚Ä¶6 pcs of pepper garlic fish, perfect in texture and taste, the fish was basa and I just love basa, they were sweet with a hint of chilli, a little crisp to the bite and we finished it in no time‚Ä¶.they served all the mains at once, the noodles and rice, the hot garlic prawns and kung pao chicken...the quantity was sufficient for all of us which means its more than a worth deal and again, it was light to the stomach but still leaves a mark inside your mouth‚Ä¶.and off course we finished with generously presented ice-creams with chocolate sauce

The place as I mentioned had very few people except us, a couple on one side and a family for 3 who were done when we started‚Ä¶.it was around 9.45pm‚Ä¶.there were English tracks played in the background which was soothing to the ears but may be some oriental music suits the place better‚Ä¶.the overall standard of the setup can be a close comparison with mainland china which off course is more spacious but this place otherwise will not let you complain‚Ä¶.the d√©cor as I mentioned is simple but soothing, this could have been a little more but then again at times simplicity is the best way‚Ä¶..

Wanted to highlight bits of feedback and may LORD forgive me for that since it sounds like I am still complaining after all of these at 449 but again like always, the intent here is to get the place really cover up these minor things and do even better‚Ä¶..the rice and noodles were bland and although it was supposed to be chicken, there weren‚Äôt much of it‚Ä¶.the hot garlic prawn can be a little more hot to do justice to its name (but that is again on my taste buds)‚Ä¶.that‚Äôs all on the food part which was otherwise just delicious, take my word for it‚Ä¶..and the final feedback is that throughout our stay for almost an hour, no one asked for even once about how the food is or even when we departed, we just left with the staff standing right next and was almost absent‚Ä¶it‚Äôs pretty basic for even small restaurants to engage with your guests but it was zero this evening‚Ä¶.was that because we came with coupons‚Ä¶lol‚Ä¶.we will never know but that is one area the guests expects these days and the team Wasabee can get a little better at that‚Ä¶

Readers, please don‚Äôt get me wrong with the above feedback, we had a splendid evening with excellent food at a very nice outlet and I will do my bit to ensure the words are spread everywhere to do justice to the deal the owners are offering almost draining profits out of their flesh and blood‚Ä¶.it takes a mighty hell lot to open and run a restaurant and tireless efforts from the staff day in and day out and in this case, they left a group of 4 of us mighty happy with their efforts‚Ä¶.thanks once again and all the best!!!!

I was dying to have some Japanese food from a long day.üòê..so we went there for lunch. Their decor is impressing with the combination of red and white colours...the host was very courteous and welcomed us..the staffs were professional and they even helped us to order.üòÄ Firstly we had maka sushi...which had 8pieces of sushi,and served with few sos. The taste of the sushi's was so unique and had a nice aroma..never tasted anything like this before. üòÑüòò It was tasty,but light..and the sos companied well with it. Next we ordered one mixed rice,noodles,one lamb item and one pork item. üòáCan't remember the exact name of the dishes..üòê I loved the rice..it was just awesome. The lamb dish was also good too,tasty yet so different from the lamb dishes I had earlier. So overall for me a great experience. The price is a bit costly though...but I will be visiting this place again very soon. üòÑüòç

This is a renowned Japanese, Chinese and Thai food restaurant located near Kalikapur. Coming here is easy just take a Jadavpur thana-kalikapur route auto and ask them to drop you at Wasabee.¬†
It is located at first floor but the decoration starts from ground floor entrance and it is really praiseworthy.
The host was really good and they welcomed us heartily. The price is bit on the higher side but lots of coupons are available online.¬†
We had ¬†:
¬†‚Ä¢ ¬†Welcome Drink: a glass of Sprite.
¬†‚Ä¢ ¬†Chicken Sweet Corn Soups- It was good like any other place but more on the sweeter side than expected.
¬†‚Ä¢ ¬†Pepper Garlic Fish - This was really tasty and we liked it a lot.
¬†‚Ä¢ ¬†Hot Garlic Prawns- the preparation was not that good though the size of prawns are worthy of the price.
¬†‚Ä¢ ¬†Hot Garlic Fish- This is the item which I liked and had with fried rice. Not sure about the fish used, may be Basa fish
¬†‚Ä¢ ¬†Chicken Hakka Noodles- Normal and in good quantity
¬†‚Ä¢ ¬†Chicken Fried Rice- Tastes good with authentic Chinese flavour.
¬†‚Ä¢ ¬† Kung Pao Chicken Gravy- Too Blunt do not go for this if you are not going through a coupon. I didn't like it at all. May be My tummy was already full and that can be a reason too.
¬†‚Ä¢ ¬†2 Scoops Ice cream-¬†Again nicely served with chocolate sauce.

In all a good experience for having a hefty lunch with nice ambiance. This was a deal through littleApp and the best deal so far.

Tried Japanese food for the first time in my life at Wasabee and I quite liked it. We went for the non veg course which served us a chicken soup which was delicious. Best part of it was we did not have to add any sauce which we Bengalis do often while having soup üòÅ The soup had a typical flavour of its own. Next came the sushi. Well I am not an aficionado of this dish but I liked the way it was presented and tasted as well. The typical aroma was intact in the sushi and the sauce provided along with it was really nice. Next came a Japanese chicken which was more or less like the Chinese items we try. The fish curry was out of the world. The simplicity of the dish is its speciality. The udong noodles was another treat for the tongue and I want to go back to Wasabee just to try out the noodles once again. The decor is kept simple with combination of red and white. The wall hangings give a typical oriental feel to the place. The staff was cordial and the service prompt and timely. Overall a nice place to dine out with family and friends.

Went there with a Nearbuy Voucher for a meal around 6.30pm most probably, yesterday with my mom! Its my first experience of nearby voucher deal, and its Went well. 
it's is very peaceful, calm and dimly lighted. Just the way I like dinning places to be. Very neat and clean everything! We had a Nearbuy coupon of 6-course Japanese meal. First we were served Cold drink in small glasses and Chicken miso soup. It was really good.
Chicken miso soup : it was with baby spinach, mushrooms , chicken and vegetables taste really nice! Good quantity, they served really hot and fresh.

6 pc nigiri sushi (salmon) : sushi is my most favourite dish !! They served big size sushi and taste really good! But quantity of salmon was less! Although if u don't notice u can't understand that. I won't blame them  for that , because a deal of rupees 799 , I don't expect much!  But i liked that taste, green mustard should be more deep and solid as per my point of view! 

6pc yakitori chicken: was very impressive cooked well , taste very good! Very good quantity! 

One bowl of chicken udon noodles: its filled with lots of veggies and chicken. was soft tender and at the same time crispy at the edges. Taste seriously good!


Steam rice with one bowl of golden curry /octopus/fish/chicken :- nothing to say bout steam rice. Its was pure fine steam rice, eatable temperature. Here We had option to choose , we decided to have octopus. 
Curry was sweet n sour , with proper Quantity of spice. Taste good, its a different kind of taste, worth a try. 
rest of all  they served us 2 bowls of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. 

#Food quality & quantity is excellent. Japanese cuisine is worth trying. Naw at Kolkata we have naw lots of Japanese cuisine, including this. I have Checked their menu, lil expensive but very good quantity and quality they serve. Overall a very pleasant experience. Will visit again.

Got bored with the Oriental Sunset so I thought of trying The Rising Sun and just around the corner was Wasabee. Was thinking of dropping by this place for a couple of weeks and eventually i made it.

The decor was nice and clean, but the Japanese Touch was missing altogether.

When we arrived,we were greeted warmly by the host. The restaurant was nearly empty so did not had any trouble finding a table. 

We ordered the Japanese Combo.

The Miso soup tasted average, the Sushi lacked its freshness .

The Yekitori chicken and the Tampura Prawn was superb.

The Udon Noodle was a treat. But i found a hair in the noodle and the dish was replaced promptly.

The Bowl of Steam rice was cold and very lumpy .

The Octopus was devastating, They served burnt baby octopus.

And for desert we were served Caramel Custard. That was the worst caramel custard i ever had, it was too sweet and eggy and the caramel was runny. The caramel tested like jaggery water.

We went there with a Groupon voucher. Reception was cordial. The food specified on the Groupon menu was served timely. The quality and quantity was impressive too. But looking into their regular menu, I thought that the prices were too high. The d√©cor of the restaurant isn't too impressive. I think they could make it a lot more attractive to match up with the oriental cuisine that they offer.

We visited this place with nearby coupon of 6 course chinese menu. Thank god! We had coupon otherwise if we had gone there just as normal customers,it would have been a disaster!!! The quantity and quality of food compared to their prices were horrible. Taste was just average. Only positive points are good location which can be easily spotted,it's just at opp.of bharat petroleum on the jadavpur-avisikta connector road and the interior decoration was pleasant,spacious. Therefore, I'm giving 1.5 out of 5.

My husband and I went to Wasabi last night and had the Crab Kodo as well as the Japanese menu for 2 which consisted of Salmon Sushi, Shimp Tempura, Miso Soup, Udon Noodle, Gravy with Octopus . ¬†First the Miso soup was hot and delicious, the Salmon Sushi was great with the Nori Sheet. ¬†The Shrimp Tempura's batter was crunchy and scrumptious. ¬† The gravy with octopus was the first time I had octopus and it was quite yummy. ¬† The Crab Kodo was the winner of the night along with the Ginger Capsicum fried rice. ¬†The BBQ flavors ¬†along with the crab meat was succulent. ¬† The Fried Rice was a great companion with the crab. ¬†We had the custard for desert which was a great way to end the meal. ¬†I highly recommend trying the Japanese dishes.

Went there with a Nearbuy Voucher for lunch. Wasabee is located just opposite of the Bharat petrolium Pump on Prince anwar shah connector. The Ambience of the restaurant is good. The behaviour of the stuffs were also nice. Now coming to the food. We opted for the 6 course Chinese meal with Nearbuy Voucher. First of all they served cold drinks and Chicken sweet corn soup. The soup was really very good. The soup contains good amount of chicken and corn. In starter they served Pepper garlic fish. The fish was awesome. In Main Course they served Chicken Fried rice and Chicken Hakka Noodles With Kung Pao Chicken and Hot Garlic Prawn. All the items were excellent in taste. In Dessert they served vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.
At this Price point, the food is excellent both in quality and quantity wise. It is value for money deal.
Cheers!

We have been to this place with friends but its sad to say the food is not at all good as the prices are. We ordered the japanese noodles which was just like top ramen. We did not have a very good experience.

I went to lunch in Wasabee with my brother. Umm.....I visited this place in the end of last month but forgot to put a review.

They welcomed us with soft drinks. Then we started off with CHICKEN SWEET CORN SOUP. It was good.
Then we proceeded with :-
CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES: It was totally bland.
CHICKEN FRIED RICE: Though it tasted nice, salt was less.
PANFRIED FISH: This was the star dish among all. It was very tasty and the fish-coating was crispy.
KUNG PAO CHICKEN: Though the chicken tasted ok types, the gravy of this dish tasted somewhat weird. 
VANILLA ICE-CREAM WITH CHOCOLATE SAUCE: The dessert was good.

Personally I feel that the food of this place is over-priced. There is no extra-ordinary taste in their dishes. In fact the staples are too inferior.
The service of the staff is good.

Wasabee has a Nearbuy voucher worth Rs. 349/- for a 5-course chinese meal for two.
For me, their positives are their flexibility with the timing, because I reached at 3 and asked for lunch and they did not deny it. Their interiors are nicely decorated, which is another plus. And food wise, I definitely liked their fish starter and the Haka Noodles. Nothing extra ordinary, but it was good. But this is where it ended for me. Every other food item I tried was absolutely a disaster. The chicken Sweet Corn Soup was not seasoned at all. The Fried Rice was absolutely tasteless. I don't know what happened there. And the Kung Pao Chicken had miniscule pieces of chicken in a huge bowl of brown gravy and tasted absolutely nothing like Kung Pao Chicken. I've had Kung Pao Chicken before, and this was not it. And I did enjoy the ice cream, but you cannot commend them for that, can you? Overall, food wise, a bad experience.

Its just near Anwar shah connector near Kalikapur..Purchased nearbuy coupon of 6-course Chinese meal with prawns. The menu was pre defined.The chilli garlic fish starter and the prawns were super tasty.. ¬†The fried rice and noodles were good but a bit less in quantity..probably beacuse of the disocunted price. lastly there was ice cream with choclate sauce..the place is well decorated..and quite busy too.. For 399 ,the food was great and value for money.. service could be a bit fast as we had to wait for each item ..

Went there yesterday for lunch. It is very peaceful, calm and dimly lighted. Just the way I¬†like dinning places to be. We¬†had a¬†Nearbuy coupon of 6-course Chinese meal. First we were served Cold drink in small glasses and Chicken corn sweet and sour soup. It was really good. I am not a soup person but it was too good to dislike. Next came the Chili garlic fish. We were served 3 pieces each. I guess the fish was basha. It tastes amazing too. I wish they had given some extra pieces. Next Prawn gravy, chli garlic¬†chicken¬†along with egg¬†Fired rice and veg Noddles . We loved the Prawn , it was big and juicy. They noddle and rice were very less in amount. I don't know if it was becoz we were paying through Nearbuy. Would definitely like to know how much amount they provide if not purchased through deals. We didn't like the chicken much . Dessert was vanilla scoop with choco sauce. Overall a good experience at 399 rs. I would say it was a good deal.

Pretty good food ! We went with Groupon 400rs non veg combo deal. In this deal they served a whole lot !

soup/ starters/ one rice dish and one chow and 2 main courses. On top of that one soft drink and dessert ! 

The food is good as I said, specially the rice and prawn dishes. The noodles is average. The starters were fantastic we had pan fried fish. The kung pao chicken was above average. The soup was great.

They have a lot of potential they can do even better. 

The service , the d√©cor is very good.

Located on a cosy corner along anwar shah connector , this place delivers the delicacy of japan. Amongst a flamboyant chinese cuisine all lover kolkata, this place deviates from the comfort zone but gives a comfortable and palatable dishes. The salmon sushi is must try. Sashimi with wasabee sauce quite tender and succulent. I specially liked the udon noodles and rice with octopus curry. They are good at it. And all these comes in a japanese combo meal that ends with a caramel custard or ice cream. We preferred the custard and it was too good. All over a must try i must say.

it was my second visit to this place and this time i redmed groupon japanise deal. the decor and anvironment was avarage but what made my eyes open that was the crowd in that place. so bfor tsting i was pretty sure abt the taste that it would nt dissapoiant me.it was my first japanise ride and i really loved their miso soup. succi was fine. but their fish wow!!! was soft tender and at the same time crispy at the edges. rice ws nice but my partner who hs tsted authentic japanise before in the very country said it was not clsic as they prefer sticky rice not lik that. but i love the aromo of lemon leaf in the rice. the chicken tested very much chinise i was quite confuse wit it. the udon was similar wit phad thai but i love the moist pattern of the noodles. they ended wit a buttersch scoop where i was expecting some royal japnise delicacy. overall a good experience but at the same time i really hope for better next time.

Went on 25.06.2016. Despite of calling them twice in the morning for a booking as we hqve a little 5 months old baby but in the evening we had to wait one and half hour outside at staircase which was extremely hot.

After getting the seat waiter came for taking the order almost 20 mins later.

The food was very bad, tasteless, it is not expected form a well known restaurant that it can not able to maintain the food quality in rush hours.

Crispy chiken has only crispy on it which was very hard and a thin chiken whose taste can not be found because of hard coating of crispy ingredients.
There was hardly 2/3 pls sliced chicken in the chiken fried rice and no other ingredients, just like a plain egg rice from a road side stall. Chiken hakka noodles was also tasteless and few pcs of chiken and egg.

Served ice cream without chocolate sauce.

And most  saddest part was that no one ever bothered to serve us the drinking water 2nd time despite of asked them . 

Thank you wasabee for the horrible experience.

Being a oriental food lover and especially japanese food this was place i have been looking forward for sometimes. Though it was hard to skip sushi & sasami and order something else but i did so considering that it might be bit risk to order a kind of high on price item from the menu on my first visit. Ordered some regular chinese stuff hot & sour soup and shredded lamb , it was quite good . So i am definately going back to try out the Japanese stuff, but i need to find some coupons otherwise its little heavy on the pocket. Another thing i liked i walked in at 4pm on weekday and still i was served that is something really good.

Dropped in for the Chinese Food Festival at CC1 a couple of weeks ago and Wasabee was their. They put up a whole range of Pan-Asian delicacies, all of which were much loved by the hungry Kolkata crowd present there. The most highly grossing item from the limited menu was the octopus. It was made fresh to order and hence not present for display. 

They had a flare of other seafood items on offer as well, which definitely got all of my attention. I tried the stir fried Udon Noodles with chicken and teamed it up with some Fish in Thai style. Quite pleased with the flavours and would love to return to the establishment for more.

I visited this place with a group of 15 people. We had coupon from nearbuy. The first thing that struck me was extreme antipathy from some of the staff towards coupon holders. I could see that most of the customers were coupon holders. They reserved the best tables hoping to get regular customers,who never showed up. I must also mention that other than the table issue, the people who served us were courteous and helpful.

We had a set menu of five courses. Welcome drink of fresh lime soda was small but OK. The chicken sweet corn soup was a tad too sweet, but otherwise good. The appetizer chicken had a tasty gravy, but the chicken itself was deep fried and hard. The staples were good. In particular the quality of the rice in the fried rice was good. The Basa was tasty. However, the prawn that we ordered separately was fried too long was hard. 

Given that for the set course we paid 175 per head, it was super value for money. However, I am not sure if I would pay the regular price for this fare, probably not.

Their food is delish. Momos, noodles, sushi, teriyaki chicken, I mean you name it and they deliver. Agreed that the price is quite on the steeper side and they don't deliver orders below 1600 bucks, this is not your everyday neighbourhood Chinese joint but once in a while indulgence.

Wasabee is located at Kalikapur (Anwarshah- Ruby connector) this place is a little off route for most people. My friend had treated a bunch of us here on her birthday. She had purchased near buy coupons which seemed quite reasonable. The restaurant is spacious, with interesting posters hanging on the walls including saxophones üòÉ The glass windows surrounding the circular structure of the place makes it a very pretty sight. Now coming to food...we had opted for the Japanese combo for 2. For starters we were given miso soup ( if I'm not wrong) which tasted horrible. Even adding salt and pepper made no difference. üôÑ Following this we were served sushi which tasted really good. (REALLY GOOD) For main course we were given noodles, chicken side dish (which was quite good) , steamed rice and octopus. The octopus tasted really sticky and one would have problems chewing it. Amidst all this there was a power cut and the restaurant didn't have a back up or generator. For dessert we had vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. The staff was helpful but extremely lost. Inspite of its flaws I'd still want to go back just for the sushi. üòä

I had a nearbuy coupon for a Chinese non veg combo meal. First of all the environment and staffs are good. We were served small glasses of pepsi instead of lime soda. Then they gave chicken sweet corn soup, then a plate of crispy chicken with 8 small pieces, then a small bowl of chicken noodles, a small bowl of chicken rice, a bowl of garlic fish and then ice creams. Taste wise the foods were pretty good though the quantity of individual items would seem less than what they normally give. As i have a medium appetite altogether it was okay for me but if you have a large appetite it may not be enough for you. But its definitely worth giving a try.

I had my first taste of Japanese food at Wasabee. I know very little about Japanese dishes apart from sushi hence it was an easy choice. We ordered the Nigiri sushi which I liked very much.They served it with soya sauce, ginger and of course Wasabi sauce( be careful abt Wasabi sauce as it is insanely hot). We also ordered the Yaki Soba mixed noodles which has a blackish colour with a sprinkling of sesame which gives it a nice flavour. For side dish, we went for the Golden Lamb Curry ¬†which was very tasty, but I found nothing distinctively Japanese about it. 

The pocket pinch is on the higher side, but worth it.

Overall I had a nice experience and would love to visit again.

We ordered Chinese fried rice, hunan fish and szechuan chicken. These three items were really good- both in taste and quality. Then we ordered Thai chicken fried in pepper corn sauce and Thai fish in red curry sauce. Both these thai items had been overcooked and had a lot of starch and ajinomoto salt... Not very impressed.. Even the pepsi wasn't cold, they gave us ice cubes!

According to the name says this restaurant serves Japans Chines as well as Thai. The food is very good, its serves sushi which is little modified but taste very good, may be thinking about the colonial taste. The ingredient use are very good and are authentic . We took a combo meal where they served a mizo soup, sushi, octopus golden curry, noodles, Thai chicken, and a ice cream. the food was good enough for two people. the ambiance is good, little vagabond style with olden time posters. But the sitting area is less and fnb staff can be improved.

This is my third visit in three years. I do consider myself a south east Asian food addict thus I make it a point to go everywhere they serve Japanese/ Thai or Chinese. The other two times I have been here I have been disappointed with the Thai food specially the phad Thai which had no oyster sauce or fish sauce in it. The Japanese sushi was OK though. The mother and I went in today for a quick lunch today and ordered the prawn fried rice . Excellent quantity and a generous serving of prawns not shrimps. I had to have the crispy chili baby corn again because I love it for no particular reason.
We walked in at an odd time 3.40 pm which is quite late for lunch but the servers were prompt and courteous and we were served in 10 mins. Mind you the restaurant was empty but for the two of us. The d√©cor is a bit of hotchpotch. Woodstock meets oriental meets old record collection. But it's nice to be able to look out those huge windows. All theme is abandoned in the stairs which has some prints on the very bright red wall.

I had gone with family with Nearbuy Vouchers last Sunday evening. The place was jam packed and there was long que. Ultimately we got a place to sit , being vegetarian and seeing rush we were not confident about the services and quality of the food. However was extrememly excited to see the service and quality of veg combo spread they served. In one word it was yummy!!!! at ¬†last found a place for vegetarian like us and nearbuy coupon helped us to get the course at such a reasonable price. Would reccommend all the veggies like me to try out this place if not till now.

For food restaurant gets big zero, for atmosphere it should get 4. I will never visit to this place again and veggies please stay away.

We brought a Nearby coupon where there was Lime soda, Chicken sweet corn soup, Sweet and crispy chicken as a starters and they were really good and tasty . Chicken Hakka noodles, Chicken fried rice along with Fish in hot garlic sauce was in the main course. Now here I will rate this as an average like it was not bad but didn't fulfill my expectation. And Ice cream with chocolate sauce as deserts which is as usual everyone's favorite one. Now coming to price range then its not so high not so low (i.e. Average), interior decoration and ambiance and service section was really good. If you are looking for family restaurant near Kalikapur then you must come over here. I really liked it. It takes a bit time toserve but still its OK. They don't have parking section but you can park your car or bike outside the restaurant (on road).

Visited the outlet for Dinner with my wife on May 14, 2016. On the positives, the place is well located on PAS Road, Byepass connector, the decor is subtle and seating also comfortable. The people attending to you are friendly and helpful too.
Unfortunately, the quality of food leaves lot to be desired, be it the noodle, rice or mains (chicken), though the soup was fine.

I was one of the first customers to this chain, and have come back ever since to this restaurant whenever I felt an asian craving. Originally their quantity used to be much less compared to price. However, recently I went with my family to have dinner - and was quite surprised at the huge quantity of food. Quality has remained fairly constant. But the problem is I find their thai and Chinese dishes more authentic in comparison to their Japanese food. Their Makimono sushi was pretty okay, but they gave me this weird looking wasabi. A good restaurant, but could be better.

Have been planning for while to visit this place, but it didn't happened for some reasons. But now I bought the non veg Chinese meal coupon, so gave a visit. Now first impression was really good. Ambiance Was nice so was the decor. Quite comfortable place for me. Now the food. The chicken sweet corn soup was good , nothing special though but good enough for me. The crispy chicken was not that good. The chicken portion was little less. But not that bad actually. Then comes the main course. The chowmin was really good. So was the rice. But the real show stopper for me was the hot and sour garlic fish. It was just too good. The fish was fresh and soft. The gravy was very delicious and nicely balanced with proper spices. For 349 for 2 people its a mind blowing deal I think. The quantity is just sufficient for us. But people with large appetite may feel the quantity is little less . Overall its a very good experience. Hope to visit again.

Went to wasabee. Had a nice feeling entering the restaurant with a good decor. I went there thanx to nearbuy for their amazing offer. But the food at this place just disappointed. First of all instead of veg manchurian, they provided a disgusting veg curry which tasted so poor, i left it untouched. The food quantity would not fill 30% of your stomach. The only thing that was nice was the crispy babycorn. Last visit to this place. Would recommend people to skip this outlet.

Thanks to Nearbuy we got to know this place serves Japanese and we've always wanted to try Japanese without burning our pocket.
First things first, the service we received was prompt and good. Ambiance and Decor had a taste of elegance.
Coming to food, we had Chicken Miso soup (didn't like it to be honest), Nigiri Salmon Sushi (first try, and surprisingly liked it), Yakitori Chicken (just okay), Udon Noodle as suggested by one of their stuffs (this was the best part of our Japanese meal) , Octopus golden Curry with steamed rice (the octopus felt a bit chewy but the I liked the light but flavoursome curry) and finally Vanilla Ice cream with chocolate sauce in desserts.¬†
We also had a coupon of their chinese menu and got to try those items as well. Sweet Corn soup was just okay-ish, no complains though. Crispy chicken was a bit too crispy, though the portion was huge. Noodles and Fried Rice were again, good but not extraordinary. What I liked most in their chinese menu is the Fish in Garlic Sauce- it was an absolute delight.

Wasabee. First time here. Was very pleased by the decor. Went in to have dinner. First we got out welcome drinks. Then we were served sweet corn soup. I didn't like it very much, felt it was under seasoned. Then we were served sweet & spicy crispy chicken. Which was heavenly. So delicious!!! Then came out hakka noodles, fried rice and hot garlic fish. Which again was very good. Then at last we had two scoops of chocolate ice cream for dessert. The food was good. Though the quantity of fried rice and noodles were very less. If we had ordered only one it wouldn't have been enough for two people. Other than the quantity issue everything else was great. Staff was courteous and service was quick. Will definitely visit again to try their Japanese food.

I was recommended this place by a friend and I'm glad I took his suggestion. Walked in to some really nice, original posters of some legendary music festivals. 

Ordered some crab sushi which were absolutely amazing! Felt really light and clean. Followed that up with some noodles and pork teriyaki. The pork was also really good. The service was also top notch and the manager made sure that everything was up to standard. 

Would definitely visit the place again.

Celebrated my birthday yesterday at Wasabee . Reached the first floor restaurant around 1:30 pm and it was bustling with customers and all of them with nearbuy vouchers. Good food at  dearth cheap price thanks to the vouchers.

The inside is decked up with different music posters of different genre. Music is played to keep up the jolly mood.  

It started of with cold drinks then chicken corn egg soup which is of thick consistency but tasty. The crispy chicken was a bit too crispy in my opinion and was becoming hard if they were kept without eating. That needs to be fixed. Maybe in the batter part or fried a bit less. Chicken fried rice was bang on. No complaints. The fish main course was made using fresh fish and that made the difference in the taste. The sauce consistency was perfect and the soft fish were gobbled up by everyone. The chicken noodles lacked a bit of seasoning and the server understood something was off, so he himself took the plates and got the noodles made again and served. That is service. Although the food was bought in a voucher,no discrimination was made in service, behavior and the food. Thank you so much for making my birthday a memorable one. Lastly there was the vanilla ice-cream with chocolate sauce. Stuffed and happy. 
Kudos team :-)

Wasabee had been on my list for long and when I got this irresistible nearbuy (Groupon)voucher had to rush.It was a set meal for 2 @Rs350 only (total value for money).
The set menu included
1.Fresh lime soda -we were served plain sprite and on enquiring the server said that sprite was the fresh lime soda.I guess @ 350 bucks there has to be some concessions.

2.Sweet corn chicken soup -was very very good with ample amount of shredded chicken sweet corn and egg white.

3.Sweet Crispy Chicken -Another amazing dish. Crispy chicken glazed with a sweet and spicy sauce loved it.

4.Chicken fried rice -it was pretty decent

5.Chicken noodles -was very well made absolutely delicious

6.Fish in hot garlic sauce -Fish was also amazing. It was melt in the mouth.

7.Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce -Standard.

The decor and ambience is wonderful while the service is swift and courteous.Will be back to try their la carte menu soon.

Have come here 5 to 6 times for 4 course veg chinese meal for 2 persons bought via nearbuy for just rs 299 . For the price they provide u bang for the buck a lip smacking 4 course meal including ice cream with chocolate sauce. Their service is also good and the staff and ambience both are good . But u must mention that urs is a veg meal exclusively else they will serve non veg meal without even asking this seems hard to digest to me that why dont they enquire before serving .. Baby Corn chilli was ok not good nor bad but the noodles is more on oily side .. liked both veg gobi manchurian and vegetable manchurian

Food ordered:
1)Fresh Lime Juice
2)Chicken Sweet Corn Soup
3)Crispy Sweet and Sour Chicken
4)Noodles
5)Chicken Fried Rice
6)Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce
7)Icecream
It was a nearbuy offer which had cost us ‚Çπ350/-. The meal was set to this as I've mentioned above. Food quality was average. The two things which I loved were soup and crispy chicken. The rice was very plain. The fish could have improved. The ice cream served was horrible. 
Now coming to the interior. It's normal. The place is not very huge. There are wonderful paintings on the walls of the staircase.

The food quality is very good. You may find the price little costly but as i went their with coupon from 'NearBuy', it was only Rs. 350 for 2 people, for a five course menu plus welcome drink and ice cream. On an overall basis, ¬†i shall recommend this restaurant.

We went there with this offer coupon and gorged on this lunch for two.
We began with fresh lime soda and the sweet corn soup which was perfect and had ample amount of shredded chicken.
The crispy chicken was again wonderful,spicy and crispy.
For the main course,there were the noodles which I absolutely loved.
The fried rice was too plain and the fish side dish a bit too bland,the pieces were soft though.
There was ice-cream with chocolate sauce in the end.
Ambience is moderate.

Going by the menu,its pretty costly. But the offer turned out to be cost-effective. We had this wholesome lunch for a reasonable amount of 350 for two.

I have found your stall in Park Street Christmas Carnival. The Octopus and Sushi plates are just awesome. The men there, were helpful enough to give information on the continental foods they were serving there. But I have a question. Do you import the Octopus and Salmon fish or Nori (the seaweed that covers the sushi) or those are cultivated in our country? Mainly for the octopus portion, are those the same that we often see in the movies or discovery channel? Or those are some special miniature only for food purpose? If you kindly satisfy my queries, I will be greatly obliged as a foodie.

This joint is located at a very convenient place on Kalikapur Road opposite the petrol station (next to Avishikta apartments). This was our second visit to the place. The ambience is exhilarating. The staff is very efficient and courteous. Abundant car park space is available. The quality of food remains the same as on my first visit 2 years back. For starters we ordered Yakitori Fish and Teriyaki Chicken. Our expectations were met with each of them. Yakitori Fish: quite crispy and the fish inside was very soft.Teriyaki Chicken: Soft and well marinated pieces...very well done. 
For Main Course we ordered:
1) Seafood Hibachi: This was an excellent dish, basically a Seafood sizzler served with rice and salad and miso soup. Some people may have certain issues with the strong smell of octopus that is also served in this dish. But based on our judgement that had been well taken care of.
2) Pork Josiko curry- Was a tad bit disappointed with this one as the pork was a bit smelly. The curry too was average...nothing exceptional.
3) Prawn Golden curry: This was a mildly spicy curry and was very good to taste. The size of the prawns served was substantial.
For desserts we ordered :
1) Caramel Pudding: Not a custard as in the menu.....but a pudding. Good to taste.
2) Sizzling Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate sauce: Sizzling as the name suggests. Excellent blend of hot and cold.
Pocket pinch is high.....so be sure of the depth of your pockets. 
Quality of food , service is excellent....there's no doubt regarding that....yet the prices can be a bit more reasonable considering everything.

We went there for a birthday party. Just a couple of minute away from Avishikta. Owned by a famous person this restaurant looks gorgeous. It was my little brothers birthday. So it was family get together. As soon as I came to know that we would come here I went through all the reviews and I was not at all excited. Coming to the decor as it was a birthday party it was nicely decorated with balloons and colourful papers. Now coming to the food. The starter chicken tirayki was not nice. A bad smell was coming out of it. We had noodles rice chicken wantoon and fish in main course. Noodles tasted good and rest was average. The ice cream was saviour for me. It was combined with Darshan and it was really good. Overall it disappointed me.

My friends took me to this restaurant on Bypass-Anwar Shah connector in September 2015 for dinner and it was a lovely experience. The ambience is nice and cozy, staffs are polite .....and the food, simply awesome :) !! We had 5 different Chinese dishes, all all of them were very tasty. I went there yesterday too, and want to congratulate and thank the chef for making such lovely preparations for us. Next time I might try the Japanese or Thai dishes too.¬†
The price is slightly on the upper side, comparable to Mainland China, but the portions served is more.
Do keep it up.

Visited the place with curiosity about Japanese cuisine at 10.15 at night. Some feedback for the persons like me who doesn't hesitate in exploring for new taste.
The ambiance and decor was excellent. There was both the buffet (served at table) as well as A-la-carte. Buffet price was Rs.650 + taxes and having a good variation.We went for A-la-carte though every item seems to be quite costly.
¬†As I am totally novice when Japanese cuisine is concerned, I totally handed over my taste bud on the good faith of the service person. He told me to try¬†
1) MISO Soup (Mixed Meat)
2) Stir Fried UDEN Noodles (Mixed Meat)
3) JOSIKO CURRY Chicken.
I must say all the items was very unique in taste and we all liked them very much. If anyone get confused with the vast variety of menu, I suggest you can try the above items.
Another thing I should mention here - the courteous behavior of every service man.
Only thing which we found as "negative" is the - PRICE. All I have to pay Rs. 1749 (including tax of Rs.300) for just 3 dishes. If you go for A-la-carte, you have to bear that a quite handful. Otherwise this restaurant is a must try.

I went there for week day buffet lunch. It is near by Kalikapur Purbachal bus stop. After eating their buffet lunch, I found some important thing should share here for food lovers. Five things I did not like in there. In buffet lunch, no buffet table is present, only serve by their staff from direct to the kitchen. Second, they did not convey that what menu are available in the buffet spread. For example, when I asked for cold drinks, someone told me it is only one time served and it is complementary, but when I complete my starter, they refill my glass. Few staff did not know about the buffet menu properly. Third, in the main course, they only provide one side dish which is fish item, and one vegetable item, at least one chicken item is missing in the main course. Forth, when I went to any other restaurant for buffet lunch, I may taste the veg starter also, but here I do not have any option due to serving problem. Fifth, they served ice cream in a chai plate which is a very bad presentation to serving food. The food taste is good, but I do not think I will try again their buffet spread. 

They provide Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Oriental Salad, Chicken Fried Wanton, the sweet garlic dip, Chicken Teriyaki, Chicken Noodles, Fish In Chili Wine Sauce, Exotic Veg In Chili Soy Sauce, Hakka Veg Khao Pad, Ice Cream Darsan, Soft Drinks. The soup was ok, very common choice,  nothing special. Wanton and Teriyaki both are good taste. The rest of the items are so much average taste.¬†Next time I only try A la carte menu, especially Japanese dishes, not the buffet one.

A complete let down of humongous proportion !
A buffet as our Groupon coupons read..It was more of a set meal without the option of choosing from..more like eating at the mercy of the restaurant.
A tall glass of cola came with a steaming bowl of the very common sweetcorn chicken soup..so should I drink the hot or the cold first?
The liquids accompanied by a blob of Oriental salad (cabbage cucumber tomato in a sweet ketchup, the only thing oriental were the sprinkles of not so generous seasme seeds)
Then came the overtly oily chicken wantons the only saving grace , the sweet garlic dip..
Followed by rounds of hardened chicken in a sweet sticky dressing. ..They called it chicken teriyaki nothing like the ones I had before.
chicken noodles and a vegetable fried rice with fish in a garlic chillie sauce for the mains, nothing out of the ordinary much like my para food cart which even costs less!
Sweets can never go wrong.. fortunately The ready made vanilla scoop with darshan helped survive the bad taste!.
All for a 549 deal seemed like a slap on the head.
Wondering why did I have it on my to go list for so long!!

Owned by a celebrity, Wasabee is a more chic, upscale oriental restaurant with a modern twist. It‚Äôs, located on Kalikapur Road, and serves the delicacies of Japanese, Thailand and China. Devotees of Pan-Asian fare can taste a variety of oriental dishes under one roof. The atmosphere is very vibrant thanks to the bright orange & yellowish themed decor and comfortable specious sitting arrangements.

After seeing the a la carte options and prices we consider getting their buffet which was comparatively cheap and affordable. Buffet spread consists of ‚ÄòChicken Sweet Corn Soup‚Äô, ‚ÄòOriental Salad‚Äô, ‚ÄòSoft Drinks‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Fried Wanton‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Teriyaki‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Noodles ‚Äì Hakka‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Fried Rice‚Äô, ‚ÄòExotic Veg in Chilli Soy Sauce‚Äô, ‚ÄòFish in Chilli Wine Sauce‚Äô and ‚ÄòDarsan with Ice Cream‚Äô. They also informed us that food will be served on our table as well a wait staff will attend us all time; I liked this idea.

To start with Chicken Sweet Corn Soup was nice, appetizing and had good fillings. Back to back they serve Oriental Salad, Soft drinks (Sprite) and Chicken Fried Wanton. Oriental Salad was mixed with sweet and sour sauce; I loved the taste and spiciness. Chicken Fried Wanton looks good but tastes average.

Do not miss their Chicken Teriyaki, a dish of fork-tender chicken pieces doused in red curry sauce, was one of their unique dishes. Succulent stir-fried chicken pieces in flavourful sauce with hints of lime and ginger, too good to resists.

Now moving to the mains I first tried Chicken Noodles and Exotic Veg in Chilli Soy Sauce, found both dishes very average. In fact I did not like them at all. Then with a hesitant mind I tried Fish in Chilli Wine Sauce and its turn out awesome. It was exceedingly moist, tender and flavourful, this melt-in-your-mouth fish in chilli wine sauce was sure to please fish-lovers. The fish in chilli wine sauce was undeniably a mass pleaser. Chicken fried rice was just above average but went well with fish in chilli wine sauce.

Save some space to end your meal off with Darshan and ice cream. I tried 4-5 plates of darsan and felt they were good but nothing extraordinary. I will recommend their buffet spread but please be selective.

On demand I take my family to Wasabee regularly as we enjoy their good quality oriental food with many varieties in veg. I always find some celebrities or other enjoying their food in Wasabee. This time I ordered for home delivery to my Alipore residence. I was highly satisfied with their delivery schedule and was more happy to find they maintain same fresh quality in case of home delivery. No wonder why my family always want to have Wasabee food.

I was a regular in Wasabee when it was opened in 2012. I returned to Kolkata after 2 years and as an old habit my first dining was at Wasabee on 14th June. I felt very precious when their old courteous staff recognized me immediately. We were a group of 9 and had Chinese, Thai and Japanese food. They were yummy as usual and the most satisfying thing is that they have been able to maintain the same standard and quality of food. We are already planning a party for 70 people in Wasabee to celebrate my brother‚Äôs birthday.

Went to Wasabee on 12th June and tried their imported Japanese Udon noodles, Teryaki Chicken and Prawn Golden Curry. Seems they have reduced the prices of Japanese items recently as the raw materials are now available easily at a competitive price. We had an awesome dinner and would recommend everyone to try out their basic Japanese items though they have wide varieties. No regret that we overlook two famous restaurants near our house.

I had taken¬† two Japanese visitors to Wasabee on 10th June. They were excited to find wide spread of Japanese cuisine in the menu. We tried out Deep Sea Bento Box, Sushi platter, Sashimi and Hibachi (Japanese Sizzler). Though I am not that used to Japanese food, my Japanese guests were so satisfied with the quality and perfection that I had to take them to Wasabee before they left on 14th June. Thanks Wasabee! Proud of you!

Ambiance is an okay-type. Nothing special to mention about apart from few Japanese-trademark plates and pictures which where hanging on the wall. And so is the quality of food. Very average indeed. Went there to try some authentic Japanese delicacies but ended up in opting for their buffet. Among the whole buffet spread the only dish worth a mention is Chicken Teriyaki. Only it had the right taste and crisp. The veg dim-sums and the Schezwan rice were just awful. Though the staffs gave quick response, the manager there was not that attentive and cordial. Really they must get things sorted out and pretty fast to be at par with and maintain the reputation they had on their earlier days. Overall had an ordinary dine-out!

So, to sum up -¬†

This place is very expensive but they make sure to offer u good quality food. Its a multicuisine restaurant. I have tasted almost all the types.. Chinese Japanese Thai.... The ambience is quite good. The staffs are very good. Overall nice place for a dinner but then you have to have lots of money in your pocket.

One salmon sushi 900 rupees. Too too too expensive compare to the ambience. Food is tasty. But not like 5 star hotel. I stay in kslikapur. Used to go often before their price revision. Not I wud prefer to in Hyatt/park and had a buffet in 1500 rupees instead of wasabee.

my friend staying near kalikapur wanted to have a quick lunch and we chose wasabee as he opted for oriental food. located on anwar shah connector, it will be just before the 2nd signal once you enter from em bypass. parking is easy on the main road and the restaurant is on the 1st floor.

we were visiting on a saturday noon and it was almost empty. without spending much time, we ordered for roasted lamb with pok choy (appetizer), stir fried uden noodles with mixed meat and teriyaki fish.

serving time was ok, not slow but not quick as well. all foods were served hot and the staffs here are helpful and polite to describe the food while you order. they would also come back and ask how did you like your food.

coming to food, all the items were excellent in terms of taste and quantity. lamb was soft and tender, we liked it most. the noodle contained too many cabbage pieces (the ones with which they make kimchee salad), which we disliked, but it was full of meat though. teriyaki fish was, well, indian teriyaki :) sweetish and tangy. fish tasted fresh.

the space is small but neatly decorated. no complaint here. problem is the cost of food. their cost can rival a 5 star restaurant!! we just had 3 items along with 1 bottle of mineral water (so 4 items in the bill) and total was around 2300 with tax!!!!

bottomline - they have good assortment of food, ranging from japanese, thai and chinese. however, they are too pricey to visit again :(

If I had my way I would eat sushi for all meals 365 days a year! But this place has the WORST sushi possible.. The sticky rice was badly cooked.. could feel the uncooked rice while eating.. The meat was not fresh and the portion in which it was cut was to big to chew on.. 

Mid way through the meal I was asked by the manager if I was enjoin my meal.. I was honest enough to tell him the mistakes... and he politely said sorry for the trouble and walked away.. 

I now understand when 90% of ppl around me say that they hate sushi, that's cause there are restaurants who don't make it right.  

I was dining alone.. and I paid a bill of rs1851. And I had left 5 sushi ' s on the plate. 

I would like to make a small comparison .. If a consumer dines at sun Asian at TAJ deccan in hyd he would have payed 1200 buks for a sushi platter and gone back for more. 

The restaurant was empty I was the only one dining. They really need to up their game.

Actually we had some other name in our mind as my partner was keen to have Chinese in Dinner. But unfortunately the restaurant was full & we had to wait for an hour or more. So without thinking more we straight went to¬† Wasabee. This is the second time we have been there. We were hungry enough & decided to go with the quick menu -¬† chicken clear soup, Mixed Hakka noodles & Diced Schezwan Chicken. Must say lovely food especially the Noodles...the flavor was awesome & nicely garnished reminding me the beach side dinner of East Asia . The only thing missing was the drinks part (Hard) as they don't have a bar facility. Else everything was perfect. Cost wise a bit high but if you compare the price with the lovely foods, ambiance & well mannered staff¬† then it's worthy. Would love to visit again.

If you're in the mood for some proper Far East delicacies with a relatively fat pocket, I'd definitely recommend this one.I've been here atleast 5 times, and have never been wholly disappointed.
Firstly, the decor is very well suited to the cuisine served here - they'll even give you chopsticks to dine with.The most recent visit, we ordered Chicken Pad Thai Noodles, Thai Prawn Massaman Curry (with Rice), and Diced Chicken in Taichin Sauce.Needless to say, the Curry was the show-stealer - wholesome and soft pieces, mild and tasty curry with all the peanuts. The Chicken was excellent too - they'd fried the dumplings slightly, and it went very well with the spicy Taichin sauce.
The noodles were a bit on the spicier side, and you don't really expect that zing out of a normal Pad Thai.
And the Orange Margherita as a final mocktail was very refreshing too.

Not pocket-friendly by any stretch of imagination, but worth every visit.

Niche little place, I like personal touch with the service and Mr. Bhowmick did made us feel very comfy. It's not an orthodox buffet where you'll see the dishes in display but you'll have the menu and they will serve you hot and fresh as many times you want. I really like the concept where we can avoid wastage unnecessarily. The teriyaki chicken and the rice was very good but the fish in wine sauce was the star for me. Overall I was little bit surprised by the outcome as me and my friend just wanted to experience some place new and buy we didn't regret it at all ... Perfect place for a calm dining for family and friends.

We stumbled at wasabee while looking for a place to eat with friends..The food was quite nice and decor appropriate..The chopsticks on the table was interesting. The accompaniments were well prepared. Even though the salt in black pepper lamb was slightly on the higher side, we enjoyed the food at Wasabee.. The service is quick but would hope they can engage in better activities than have all staff who are free looking at a particular table..Its a bit uncomfortable for even a men's group while eating.

Located on Anwar Shah connector, it quickly attracts your attention with iys red clored fonts. I was on a strict budget this time and just happened to be in that locality somehow and the joint I could immediately think of was a bee !!!
They serve mainly Japanese, Chinese and Thai. They have chopsticks on the table for enthisiasts to use which I had not much intention on that harried date. Thr Japanese was pretty expensive followed by Thai and Chinese, the latter being at standard market price. We consulted the staff and on recommendation ordered for Teriyaki Pork and Mixed Meat Japanese Flat noodles. The meat, though was prepared goodwas a tad bit overcooked, thus killing the overall balance of the spices. The noodles was good. Quantity does match up to some extent with the price. Overall taste was good, though being on budget, I could not taste much and hence my scope is limited. And these 2 dishes didnt do very good to my pocket either, costing me a whopping 1500 bucks ( yes it was too much that day, considering the ambiance, the no of items and taste) !
They serve good table salads which are yummmyyyyy !!!

When I heard about wasabee I was excited because I am a big fan of Japanese food. However I was Soo disappointed. The sushi rice was hard. The tempura was batter fried prawns and they served it with Thai sauce which was weird. The prawns in the devils curry was over Cooked and chalky. Only good thing was the udon noodles. For a place that over priced the food was really really substandard. Definitely not value for money.

Tucked away in a silent corner far from the maddening puja rush of other eateries. That was my first impression of the place! Though it may not be good news for the owners but finding a relatively empty place on oshtomi late afternoon was a relief! The place is nice and quiet, with soothing and appropriate music palying in the background. Didn't want to be too experimental so instead of trying the Japanese spread we decided to go for the safer Thai option. We ordered roasted pork with pok choi for starters which was slightly on the saltier side. But the mains more than made up for that. The thai green curry was perfect. Portions were good as well. One curry was sufficient for two people with medium appetite. For dessert we ordered a caramel pudding which was absolutely spot on! It had the right amount of sweetness and the caramel wasn't too overpowering either (I have faced this in quite a few places). Overall a nice place. Pocket pinch is slightly on the higher side. But then we felt it was worth it. Will definitely go for the Japanese menu the next time! :)

We were very sceptical when we went to this place during ashtami because surprisingly this place was empty. Decided to keep it pretty simple with traditional thai dishes. For starters we had ordered roasted pork with pork choy along with thai green curry for mains. 
And they didnt disappoint. Everything about the restaurant is serene. The oriental music playing in the background goes really well with the ambience.  Though we couldnt fathom what the set of music festival posters had to do with oriental cuisine.
The food served was hot and delicious. With sumptuous quantities served, one main dish suffices for two people easily. Overall its a wonderful place if you don't mind the pinch in your pocket. But then again its worth it.

Wasabee is a good try, with an amalgamation of Japanese, Chinese and Thai¬†cuisine. Good place, with the staff being the plus factor. They were so eager to help, re-filling our plates, drinks, were extremely friendly. The quantity was overflowing, absolutely 5/5 here. Taste wise, all items were good. ¬†Conveniently located, ample parking space.
                    

Second Review
Wasabee has a new address! The new location is across the street and a little towards Jdavpur but on the connector itself. We loved their seafood fare. The sushi was excellent and authentic but a little too dry for my taste. I was surprised to see the sashimi platter.
The tempuras were perfect, and paired well with the sweet thai chilly sauce.¬†

The other recommended dishes:
Sea Food Fried Rice

A sea food lover‚Äôs paradise, this dish has a mix of shrimp, baby octopus, baby squid and vegetables wok tossed along with rice

 

Pak choy Delight

A Chinese staple vegetable, the greens are prepared in the classic Hunan style

Wasabee Saut√©ed Mushroom

A Wasabee specialty, mushrooms are simply tossed in butter, oyster sauce, light soy and coarse pepper

Khow suey (Chicken)

If something can be called a bowl of happiness, this could well be it. Burmese Khow Suey is a traditional dish made with egg noodles, curried chicken and coconut milk. Served with a variety of condiments, each spoon full you eat will be bursting with flavours! Khow Suey is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think about Burmese cuisine.

Caramel Custard

This classic dessert comes with a twist at Wasabee! Light on the palette yet rich in flavors this is a must try if you love your puddings!

Fried Ice Cream

A dessert that is completely vegetarian is hard to find. A Chef‚Äôs specialty dish, it comes in a variety of flavors although the coconut milk flavor is the most unique and talked about!

We two extremely foody ppl..have targeted Wasabee for pretty long time....bt month end n pocket crunch had put delay on our plan...so oneday while browsing net we came across this Groupon Buffet offer at wasabee at a pretty reasonable pocket frndly price..we immediately grabbed it....n one fine wednesday we went there...it was absolutely empty...adorned with bright colors on the wall...it ws pretty well decorated. We went in shown our groupon coupon to the manager...he seemed a bit displeased...n with a reluctant expression escorted us to our table. Then started the food roller coaster ride....we were given welcome refreshing drink...then came the soup...which was very average....the service was very fast so we asked the waitor to keep it a bit slow...the starter we good....by the time v reached the mains...we were quite full....bt we didnt let go...we tasted each n every stuff on the buffet menu..mains were just average chinese...the desert was good...overall ok experiance....i feel they should update their buffet with more japanese items..rather than just normal chinese once..

Wasabee... the place is really nice, very good indeed, and totally a "value for money" place.

Me and my friends decided to check out this place, and luckily got ourselves some coupon for their lunch buffet. Although, the spread was predominantly chinese, i found it better than most restaurants serving indian version of chinese and at par with the likes of Bar-b-q.

It started with some delicious chicken sweet corn soup, followed up by an okay-ish oriental salad and then came the starters(i wonder why don't they call it their main course, taking into account the volume served) consisting of chicken wanton(basically what i would call a miniature chicken samosa), chicken dim sums(a delight for the healthy bingers), chicken teriyaki( muaaahhh, sorry fell short of adjectives here). They gave us a second generous helping of the above said items(it's an all-you-can-eat buffet).

Then came the main course. We were already 3/4th full by then. More than generous quantities of chicken hakka noodles(it's almost the same everywhere) ,hong kong fried rice(surprise..surprise... it wasn't in the menu) and fish in chilly wine sauce(mamah miaa, exquisit√©, .... catch my drift... a must try for everyone) were served . We struggled to complete our spread, but finally when we did, came the icing on the cake........ that is....*drums playing* Darsan with ice cream. It was heavenly. I took two helpings of it despite being totally full. It was that good, it makes you forget everything else. It gives you a Darsan of heaven(not trippin lol).

Now coming to the other aspects of it, the service was impeccable, the waiters, well mannered and courteous, and the ambience was quite amazing(they played a soothing japanese song in the background, not too loud, not too meek just perfect)

Go ahead give it a try, worthy of your time and money.
P.s- i am just a beginner foodie, so everything looks awesome

First of all i know this place is called Wasabee but then please dont have the Japanese food here at all... they dont understand the concept of it and when we asked for bowls to mix the soy and wasabee they went into a dilemma which took a lot of clarification to resolve.... in the crispy chili babycorn the guy serving us agreed that it was re heated babycorn and not a fresh batch which was then changed...¬†

the place is nice and cozy and the interiors done up above average style.. the chairs and tables although not all that comfortable is ok to do with... the food concept today is changing in Kolkata the way it had in Mumbai and Delhi and other cities... Multi Cuisine restaurants are becoming less and less and people try to focus on one main cuisine which they can serve the best of... not this place though... they have Japanese Thai Chinese Indian... though according to me stay away from the Thai and the Japanese for simple reason that they are not good or they taste just like their Chinese counter parts...

the Chinese is average and nothing that great to talk about that will make this place stand out...

all-together i think this place is a joint you can go to if you not getting place anywhere else cause there is no finish to the food and everything is just about average to have...

Had lunch with my office colleagues on Friday. Got coupons from groupon "buffet lunch for 12. Started with shezwan chicken dry and other stuff, unlimited as per them, followed by pulao and chineses fish and noodles with shezwan chicken and other tongue twisting named dishes, well the main thing is it was cheap 270/- per person, unlimited on all dishes served, so the profit on eating depends on you, the more you eat the more profitable it is & the food was awesome !



Here's an extension to my review. Visited this place with my special friend on Friday evening to have some Chinese. Was expecting it to be good... But hay! It was left as just an expectation. The haka noodles were yuk!!!????
The roadside chowmin stall cooks better than wasabee.. Had chilli chicken and baby corn, which was ok, but still my dinner was spoiled

Ok 
Too sweet. 
But this was my first visit.
Every dish we ordered was sweet. 
Taste was good .
The Jazz Jumbo Prawn served with miso soup and brown rice .
Was picture perfect in display .
The prawn was excellent. 
The brown rice was so so in my opinion. 
The miso soup was perfect. 
With Regards to taste.
The nigiri sushi was not up to the mark sadly.
The mixed meat noodles were great
Hopefully the next visit will make a better impression. 

Also sad to say the staff was lacking in guidance about the preparation and flavours to explore . 
Most customers will not have a vast knowledge in Japanese food
 but with a better guidance on the flavour. I belive will spread the love for Japanese food.

Pretty good Japanese restaurant. Good for people yet to have a taste of Japanese food. Ambience was pretty good and service was prompt.  We ordered a Chicken and a veggie Teriyaki, with stir fried Udon noodles and a golden chicken curry (which comes with steamed rice) and a sizzling brownie to top it all off. All in all a very good experience!

Let me begin with some qualifiers.
I never eat at the buffet anywhere except at non-specialist eateries. The only reason to eat off a buffet is when you have no clue to the cuisine or the items on offer are not especially exciting.
This was my first visit to the restaurant although I had the food delivered home earlier.
I am partial to sashimi and not so much to sushi. The sashimi here is good, especially the salmon sashimi. The prawn tempura really depends on the quality of the prawn and this serving did not disappoint at all.
The Udon noodles were all they were hyped up to be as was the Josiko lamb.
Avoid the chicken teriyaki.
Will certainly go back for more. One fellow diner on this trip is allergic to seafood so a large part of the fun was left untasted.

Its like a neighbourhood restaurant with decent Asian food....not particularly for the food aficionados who knows proper Japanese cuisine.
The ambiance is decent, the waiters good but not so knowledgeable as one would prefer. We were looking for brown rice, an item they had on the menu, but the Manager informed that since it's not so much preferred by guests, they do not perpare brown rice anymore !!!
Btw, we took Thai green curry chicken and Prking style shredded lamb along with steamed white rice. Both items were of decent taste, nothing excotic or over-the-top to be talked about. I went with a friend of mine, whom I met after 15 years, so the time went by pretty well and fortunately he liked the food.
Once again, not a dissapointment, but nothing to add to bucket list either. Decent food at a neighbourhood restaurant is what I can infer.

A self proclaimed Japanese Restaurant without a single Japanese item in their Buffet Menu . The Chicken Coriander Soup was good, Teriyaki Chicken was just something far from what one can expect... On asking for a refill for the second time, they acknowledged but after waiting fro about 40 mins when it didn't arrive, on inquiring they said , it can't be served since it was past 3pm .. Ddnt get their logic and why dint they say that when we ordered... Strange !!! 
The Fish was good so rating 2.5 ( else would have settled for 1 ) 
Fried Wantons were of street side qulity without any seasoning or taste of any kind... 

The Dessert was pathetic.. worst darshan ever tasted.. They were so dry and looked like they were prepared at least a week back !!
A BIG Disappointment in whole !! Neva to return ...

I cant comment on the Japanese Food they serve but dnt ever go for the Buffet.. moreover they are served on the Table which leaves you no choice to settle for your favorites ....

I wish there were some 'Negative Rating' option available. 

This is one of those WORST of the kind restaurants...WORST IN TERMS OF FOOD....WORST STAFF... WORST SERVICE.... Most ill managed....At Buffet counters u don't find food...and if the food is available its cold. After several requests, complaints and pokes you are still sitting with empty plates. And finally when you try to talk to the higher authority (THE OWNER) you are just gonna be bashed by his abusive language.

Well with this experience at hand I thought I must write a review at least for people who are planning to visit this place sooner or later.

I can assure you -  Any roadside outlets will make you experience a better hospitality in comparison to WASABEE.

I had the worst experience of my life after visiting this restaurant, which is run by a bunch of hooligans. The most unmanaged, ill disciplined and serving the worst food in kolkata.
I was most surprised, when all the customers raised their voice against the ridiculous quality of service and food, the owner of the restaurant came out totally drunk and started misbehaving with the customers.
I fail to understand how these people get a restaurant licence to fool the people.
So foodies beware of such a bad dining experience, if u r thinking of visiting this so called restaurant.

Worst service ever. Buffet absolutely cold. On complaining the owner blatantly aggressive. His response " whatever is given is there. I'm doing you a favour. If you dont like it, you can go." since review cant b uploaded without rating, perforce had to give 1. Otherwise has to b negative

Food is OK but the basic attitude is to cheat customer. They advertise for buffet lunch and u land up and find, they serve at table. Objective of such act is to control the quantity.
BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OF THIS RESTAURANT IS THE WORST POSSIBLE BEHAVIOR OF ITS STAFFS. I have hardly come across an agency in a service industry with such a bad approach.
Shall never visit again and advise all friends not to visit. There are so many other choices in Kol.

I was there on one Sunday night (May, 2014) for dinner in order to experience some continental items. We got a warm welcome by a well-dressed manager as we (2 persons) reached there around 9 pm and we liked the ambiance there. A soft Japanese music was playing in the background. After opening the menu card, we were stunned by looking at the item prices!!! We love to try out new restaurants in Kolkata and based on my experience I can surely say that the ala carte price of this restaurant is very high compared to some famous restaurants in park street like Peter Cat, Tung-fong, Bar-B-Que, Marcopolo, Mainland China etc. Whatever, we directly ordered main course - "Japanese Golden Chicken curry" and "Thai Red Chicken Curry" which were very delicious. 
The items were served with steamed rice and were enough in terms of quantity for a single person. Now the question is, was it worthy at all in terms of price? The bill was Rs 910. Frankly, we find the price very high for two persons for two items only. If we consider the location of the restaurant, it is one of the most expensive restaurants in South Kolkata and is definitely a no-no for a middle class family. 
They have buffet @ 499 /  head, excluding Sunday dinner. 
Food loving people can go and try out there and have a change in taste.  
A suggestion - if they can lower the price a little bit, then it may attract a large number of people  ( especially students of Jadavpur University area) as they provide a variety of dishes and I bet after seeing the dishes they offer, One would be tempted to try out WASABEE.

Firstly i have to say if anyone of you want to have proper buffet dont go there. They always serve you to the table though some buffet utensils were kept on a long table but i think they are for exibition.
The available dishes in their buffet which we got in a discount coupon was good in their names but not in tastes. Only I found the noodles and fish item in the main course were worth mentioning. 
The worst thing came when we asked for a repeat serve of fish item. The dish when they served the first time had 8-10 pieces in a plate,but when they took the repeat it had only 3 pieces dipped in gravy in a bowl !!! Even the waiter was failed to take out one more piece from the gravy. This is not only disappointing but it was an insult to the customers i think. When you cant serve proper buffet then dont do. There are many restaurants in kolkata dont have the buffet and they are doing a lot better than this place but they dont need this business policy which badly affect the foodies.
In the desert they served a scoop of ice cream in a plate !!! And the darshan in the same plate !!!
May be they serve good food for a la carte as some reviews said. But the idea for buffet and discount coupon which they started to increase the no of customers completely failed.

A restaurent on one end of Kolkata, close to Avishkta, with an average food, is certainly not smething one can wish for.
With a tag-line "Food for Soul", the dishes dont mirror the name.
They declare to serve Thai, Japanese and Chinese dishes, but the serving and quality of food falls flat.
I was disappointed with the food and having had to go in one corner of Kolkata was not worth it.
Can be best avoided.
Rate it 3.0.

This place serves good quality Japanese food, though the buffet service was devoid of any such typical Japanese delicacies. But in a-la-carte system, one can always go for chicken teriyaki, octopus or squid sashimi, ramen noddle soup or sushi which are typical of the Japanese cuisine. Though the serving of the food took quite some amount of time, it was worth the wait. They also serve  Thai and Chinese dishes as well, but it is preferable to take Japanese food over there, though the Pla Rad/Red Prik (Thai preparation) won my heart. Overall Wasabee is a good place for fancy dining, but if your taste buds revolt over the concept of being brave enough to try octopus or calamari, then you'd better stick to the Chinese platters, which also are not bad.
P.S They have a good stock of mocktails too. (Personal favourite - Virgin Mojito)

No Japanese in the buffet! That's really bad! ! And the buffet menu was not at all good.unnecessary spicy and too less options. The daarsan was peppery hot! That's very unusual! ! The sushi was really good! But we are apprehensive about the rice used! ! May be it was not original sticky rice. But anyway the sushi tasted really good! ! Don't think we'll come back here! Sorry!

Convenient location, aesthetic interiors ,the lilting intsrumentals in the background and the courteous staff ,however, fail to make it up for the average food quality .

Wasabee..my god whats wrong with you guys? Went there with my group from office for the dinner buffet...and was terribly let down. The buffet spread had only a fish preparation in the main course whereas last time we had chicken and prawns as well. And the fish had no taste at all...totally bland. The chicken teriyaki had too much sauce and bamee noodles were undercooked. The dimsums lacked seasoning and the darsaan too tasted weird. You guys should also teach the service staff some manners, uncourteous and rude to the point that they did not even look at us while answering. Mismanaged and havoc...we had a lot of expectations since the last time we went there 2 months back we really enjoyed.

Went to Wasabee on my brithday to treat my family consisting of 14 people. We had gone for the dinner buffet. Wasabee, claims to be a Japanese outlet and a Thai one. I will not agree with the Japanese bit of it but the Thai is rather good. We had a lot to eat in the buffet and the overall experience was really good. Everyone enjoyed their services and hospitality as well. 
the Buffet Spread is given below with comments to each item:
Oriental Salad -- It was tangy and nice and was liked by majority with a sour taste.
Chicken Coriander Soup / Veg Coriander Soup - Soup was fantastic!!! 
Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce -- Fish was succlent and soft and the batter was less. The sauce was like sweet n sour sauce of chinese prep.
Teriyaki Chicken -- Not really like the Japanese teriyaki but was nice to eat.
Chicken Fried Wanton -- No one can go wrong there!
Baamee Noodles (Non-Veg) / Veg Baamee Noodles --- Noodles was cooked to the right time and the veggies added were plenty, it wasn't just noodles :P
Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice --- The most favourite dish of the night!
Veg Dim Sum --- Another favourite even though it was veg!
Devils Choice Veg (Mushroom, Baby Corn, Cauliflower) -- Veg Lovers can give it a shot!
Ice Cream
Darsan
1 Mocktail -- unlimited serving of Mocktail will bring a smile on anyone!

I also tried their Thai Red curry and was much impressed. 
The price is a bit high compared to other similar joints. 
All in all, definite recommendation.

Its misleading to name a place Wasabee and offer no Japanese food in your Buffet. Maybe we picked the wrong day to dine there, but it was only on much coaxing that we got a plate of Chicken Teriyaki which was not bad, but lacked the Presentation or light touch present in any Japanese food. I get it. They're catering to Bong palates and I salute their effort to do so, but, like someone said in an earlier review, a Japanese name and a few Oriental Plates on the wall do not make a Japanese Restaurant! Their fried Wantons lacked seasoning; their fish in lemon sauce was  Blehhh; too much soya, ginger and Vinegar in most of their items; the noodles could have been rustled up at any street corner; hell, even their Daar Saan looked sad and came served on little saucers which looked like they belonged with a tea cup, not Ice cream!

No, this is not a place I will recommend for anyone who knows their Japanese food from their Vietnamese. 

Bottom line, Wasabee was a disappointment.

Having read reviews online, we decided to try this new chain. Located in an odd place on kalikapur, you could miss it if you are not alert.  The food however was excellent, hands on. We took the Chinese buffet. Everything was well organized starting from the catering to the table.  The starters were perfect, hinting you at the mouth watering entrees following it.  The star of the menu were ginger capsicum fried rice and fish in hot garlic sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked, as if melting in your mouth. And the fried rice was one of the best I had in recent times.  I would definitely come back here to try their other items.

my hunt for Japanese food in the city was on for quite some time till a friend suggested this place. Indeed, they do serve Japanese food better than other places here. The sushi platter is good, and the glass noodle and wanton soup was delicious. The roasted pork was okay kinda stuff. 
They also serve chinese and thai food, but then, since they specialize in Japanese cuisine, I would suggest you to try the sushi. 
happy eating :)

Passing through Kalikapur road, we suddenly decided to try this place. I wasn't very convinced with the idea, however, went in with minimum expectations...
but from the moment of entering the place....my thoughts started to change.....
the decor was wisely and nicely done...simple yet warm....
after a little dilemma over whether to try new cuisine at a new place...we settled for tried-and-tasted chinese and thai options! 
We started with 'Satay Kai', a chicken preparation and ordered fried rice, noodles and two different preparations of chicken for the main course. I have to say,we ordered pretty common items fearing a possible dissatisfaction. 
But after the very first bite of Satay Kai with a dip in the accompanying peanut sauce i felt sorry for myself for not ordering the special dishes here. The appetizer was an explosion of flavours and an absolute hit.
The main courses also served us pretty well.....though common dishes...like garlic chicken and mix rice...but the tastes were really different!! Even the quantity of food per plate should get some brownie points...
At the end we were also served complimentary 'sandesh' for 'Poila Baishakh' ! 
On the whole the experience was really one of a kind...will surely visit again and try the delicacies...

I went there a couple of days ago with a friend of mine. We were carrying groupon coupons but the service was no different. The teriyaki chicken in the buffet was extremely good. The baamee noodles is another special mention. Service and ambience quite nice though hard to comment on the service since we were the only table they were serving at that point of time. 499/- inclusive of all taxes for a weekday buffet including starting with a mocktail followed by soup,chicken fried wanton,teriyaki chicken, veg dimsum and the main course consisting of veg fried rice, non veg baamee noodles and prawn in hot chilli sauce squared off with darsan and ice cream is pretty reasonable. The prawns were also succulent but the gravy was a tad too thin for my taste. Overall a nice experience and a 3.5 from me

A lone Buddha statue outside the entrance to the restaurant does not an Oriental restaurant make! Inside you see an African tribal painted on the pillars, loads of framed pictures of music festivals around the world (Glastonbury et al) and about 8 oriental plates on the wall. The only thing that reminds you that you are at a restaurant serving oriental cuisine is the set of chopsticks on the tables. The food is extremely overpriced. and while the first few bites make you think it is amazing, the taste gets more and more bland as you keep eating. The Yaki Soba noodles were extremely oily  and laden with more cabbage than meat but Teriyaki chicken was nice and crispy. The Fish Josiko Curry was really bland and tasted like something you'd cook at home, not something you're paying good money for at a restaurant. The sizzling brownie with ice cream was the way it should be. Also, the pickled cabbages and the cheese-cherry-pineapple sticks served before them meal were very nice.

The waiters are extremely non intrusive and the maitre d was very courteous. But would I go back? Probably not. There are a number of places in Kolkata that serve better food at lower rates and our 2500 bucks was just not worth the food. Also, the music sounds like you're at a Psycho screening, and isn't remotely Japanese or even Chinese.

Travelled from Howrah with expectations only to be given average food and average service. 

No positives, there were no customers other than me and a friend till 2.30. After that, only one family came. The buffet spread wasn't even laid out and we were brought food from the kitchen. Not the worst experience at a buffet restaurant but not worth visiting twice.

It was our 7th Marriage Anniversary, sadly could not take a leave from work or planned anything special. Saw this newly opened restaurant ‚ÄúWasabee‚Äù, was not sure about it and I rarely do experiments with my food. This place is like 5 minutes walk from my flat. I thought of giving it a try.

The Menu looked out of dictionary, took help of a guy and I ordered for a Noodle dish along with a Chicken side dish, sorry I cannot remember the dish names now. I was sitting and waiting for my order to be cooked and was enjoying the new ambience. Really well maintained place and well behaved people. Sadly to say we strive to get both at the same time in the city anymore. Well finally my wait was over and I got my parcel, I surprised my wife with the food. We are a die hard Chinese food lover. She unpacked the food while I refreshed to dig into it. Well while writing this blog, I still remember the yummy food and still my mouth waters. It was really nice and the ingredients were excellent indeed. Undoubtedly the best in Kalikapur as per my opinion. A must to try!!!

Well, we  visited Wasabee, wanting to have Japanese food. The Mizo soup was good, but nori was not available for flavouring, even  on request. Vegetable Tempura was fine. The main dish, Japanese curry rice combo, was a disaster. Tofu/ Shrimp curry was essentially based on white sauce with coconut milk, ginger, onion etc. The rice served was Basmati rice. The distinctive Japanese rice was not available. Actually what was served was a Thai white sauce curry and good old basmati rice.
Meal for two cost Rupees 1873/- (excluding tip).
The establishment's offering of Japanese food is misleading. For Chinese and Thai cusine, there are many competing options.
There is nothing to recommend the restaurant, unless one is very hungry and close by and other restaurants have customers waiting.

On the 27th we decided to try out this restaurant as it's close to where we live and we LOVE Japanese cuisine!
Ordered octopus salad, salmon maki, tuna sashimi, caramel custard. Bill came to Rs 2,800, which I think was a tad steep since they don't serve booze. The wasabi was prepared too bland (too much water added to the powder). The octopus salad (actually a sunomono) was OK and quite tasty. However, the salmon maki had too much rice and too little salmon. But that is to be expected since salmon is a tad expensive in Kolkata. I didn't find in the menu basa or tilapia fillets. My suggestion to the chef (koksan) is to offer the futomaki rolls which is made with a combination of cucumber stick, crab stick, shrimp, egg omelet, and raw tuna diced with negi (scallions). This would then be worth savoring at the Rs 500 price range. I'm also suggesting they add "seaweed salad" in their menu.

Would we go there again? You bet we will, especially if they start serving steam heated sake (not microwaved) and green soy beans to go with it.

Quite a promising restaurant with a wide menu to make up for it's rather modest size. I like the distinction that they keep between Japanese, Chinese and Thai, so as to feature specialities from each country. The food is quite faithful to the distinct cuisines, especially the Thai dishes. As to the authenticity of the Japanese dishes, I am afraid I cannot comment as I have no prior reference. The sushi was certainly nice, but then it was the first time I ate sushi.

Had Japanese meal which I had for the first time (basically I just wanted to taste Japanese). Food was good (though I didn't liked the dish Maki Sushi, though the dish golden chicken curry was awesome). Price is bit towards the costlier side. Ambience was pretty calm and awesome,
 they managed to give the restaurant an exclusive touch.
My overall experience is good over here.

The food is great. Nice ambiance, waiter was helpful and not opposed to customizing items according to my food disorders/intolerance. The problem is the price, especially if you order Japanese oriented non-veg items. Then two people will need more than 900-1000 bucks, after their price revision (portions are not bad). I really liked the Miso soup and Soba Noodles, Yakitory was good enough. Would like to visit again.

I took my husband there as a birthday treat this Monday. Thankfully both of us love experimenting with food, so we I was hoping he would enjoy it. Never having eaten Japanese food before, we didn't have very high expectations. However, we were happy with the food there... I wouldn't spend so much on the Chinese food there, as there are good Chinese restaurants at much lower rates... but I did enjoy the food there. We had the regular sushi, and we did enjoy it. My husband loved the wasabi sauce, and we actually asked for some more!

All in all, a good experience, with good and courteous staff. Be prepared with enough cash to spare

My first visit to wasabee on a rainy afternoon. The lunch was dedicated for nabami in durga puja.  I had a lovely experience on my first visit to the place. 

First of all coming to the location, it is located very near to the kalikapur and Prince Anwar shah connector road. I personally didn't had a nice impression form outside but the interiors did changed my mood. The paintings on the wall to the light music in the background was really nice.  I went there with my family. With full on Durga puja crowd we dint get the place at one go so we had to wait outside for a few minute. They warmly welcomed us asking for time in a very nice manner. And the best part was we were served with a complimentary Soft drink during the time we had to wait :) :) Dat made me give a rating of plus .5

The restaurant mainly comprising of Japanese, Chinese and Thai foods. Secondly coming to the menu selection. I love Chinese food which made me choose all the Chinese from the wide spread menu they have. My menu selection goes like :
Soup : Chicken meat ball soup and Crab meat soup
Dim Sum : chicken wanton
Main Course : Diced Chicken in hot garlic sauce
sliced fish in chilly mustard sauce
prawn fried rice
Egg hakka noodles
&&& sweet Fresh lime soda.

Added to the menu I will say the quantity is really good for almost all the food they served us. Crab meat soup was just amazingly nice and the best one which I liked. The chicken wantons were served with some oyster sauce which made it different form the wantons served in other places. Both chicken and fish tasted nice. Even the prawn fried rice had a nice taste of prawn with a very good quantity. (I really had to fight to complete the food). Drawback with the egg noodles, thou it looked really nice but dint tasted as good. 

Well Chloromint at the end was nice :) 
Looking forward to visit soon & try some Japanese & sushi next time.

they are passing a mix of Indonesian and Thai as Japanese food in their curry items. coconut milk / cream is almost never used in traditional Japanese offerings. however the staff is smartly trained and friendly .

My 3.5 Ratings is a combination of both charming interiors and quality food!
This place is near to Spencers at Kalikapur Rd, on Price Anwar Shah Connector. I had gone on a weekday noon and opted for a seat near window to watch rain drops distinctly. Though the place boasts of its Japanese cuisine, We (My wife and me) wanted to try Thai cuisine here and so our order comprised the following (review in brackets):  
Veg Tom Yum Soup (bit spicy but distinct flavour of lemon grass)
Crispy Chilly Babycorn - Thai style (Really crisp, perfect and wholesome quantity)
Exotic Vegetables in Thai Green Curry (Really exotic were the veggies, green curry is less spicy liked by my wife :-), would advice red curry for spice lovers)
Thai Veg Fried Rice (rice had a distinct aroma & the quantity was good) 
Two Beverages
Vanilla Ice Cream with hot choco sauce (Average)
Cost for two - Rs 1100-1200 plus taxes

Pros:
- The interiors are done beautifully with Chinese decorative plates adorning the wall, beautiful paintings fetching that oriental & Japanese feel and the soothing music playing in the background.
- The staff is very courteous, polite and helpful. They are indeed a plus for this food joint.
- The presentation of the food is very good, for example a beautiful flower crafted out of a chilly! (Pic attached)
- The portions of the dishes are good enough for 3 people, thus bringing down per person cost. We both struggled to finish the above mentioned menu.

Cons:
- The tables near the windows are very small to accommodate 3 people, even 2 of us were jostling for space as there are sauces and cutlery pre-positioned on the tables.
- The cost is on a higher side given the 'food-location-amenities' matrix.

Wasabee is located in the Kalikapur area on the fag end of Anwar shah road connector near EM Bypass. The interiors are simple but well done. The waiters are very polite and very efficient (glasses were always refilled with water without ever asking, food brought and served on time, right cutlery, attention to details). 
I tried the Chinese dishes and was satisfied. The Coriander soup was light and well balanced. the Sweet & Crispy chicken was well flavored, the chicken in garlic sauce was again light and well balanced as requested. The only disappointment was the chicken hakka noodles which had little chicken and more eggs (room for improvement in overall taste as well).
Priced on the higher side, it is still a place to try out the Chinese food. 

I wait to try the Japanese food at this place.

the menu for japanese food is quite good although the sushi is not out of this world. presentation & quality of food is decent enough. the decor of the place although minimalistic could do better with a little bit of space management. the seating arrangement looks a bit cramped up specially in the weekends. would suggest to add more items to the food menu specially in the thai section

Bliss is the bright colour of red on the waiters' uniform.
Bliss is the smile on their face, their greeting warm!
Bliss is the bright colour and the decor adoring the wall,
Bliss is the chefs' offering, every bite big or small!

It is this Bliss that encompasses me, during every visit.
Wasabee, the restaurant, it remains my very favourite!

The place is located near bypass , hence its less crowed. The ambience and the hospitality is good. Food is not as good as the price. The restaurant demand to serve authentic japanese and hence the price is very high compared to the other restaurants. For two people the bill was 3000/- oops when we just ordered for 01 pork fried in barbeque sauce , 01 sushi , 01 mixed noodle ,01 cicken preparation and only 02 mocktails. Dnt you think its over priced.... 

For me yes it is over priced... compared to the quality of food you serve.

the new kid on the block. i was not sure of this restaurant when i first heard of it. but i was impressed by the decor. however mere decor does not make this restaurant one of my favourites. the khao phad i had tasted so authentic that i thought that i was back in Thailand. the food was good plus a good ambiance and good service makes this restaurant impressive. i've been there twice and would love to go more in the recent future.

I visited  wasabee on 13 June 2013, The friendly clean & spacious environment was impressive. The choice on the menu and the food was excellent and the service too was prompt, courteous , professional & friendly. I found Wasabee no less than some of the best restaurants of this category in the US & United Kingdom. I will certainly visit Wasabee again when I come to next year.

The place has got good deco and all but the food is nothing quite like The wall on Sarat Bose road. I kind of found the suchi quite insipid. The hospitality was not bad. Overall the food i found to be very middle. 

The items on the menu card needs to be changed, some of the items need to be changed and are stagnant.

Amazing place to be with. Great ambience and nice hospitable staffs. The menu is just superb. A very thoughtful combination of japanese, thai and chinese. I loved the japanese cuisines in particular. Had jumbo sized octopus with sea food rice. A much needed break from Pan Asian restaurant @ ITC Sonar or Ban Thai @ Oberoi Grand.
Thanx to Tanmoyda for such an excellent place of which the city can be really proud off. In fact his artistic touch has made the place soo dearer. A meticulous decor with a reflection of impeccable ideas......loved it.

How could I have not noticed this restaurant that too within 200 meters from my residence. Went there day before yesterday. Being a celebrity owned restaurant, I expected the feel a bit different. What I found was really surprising. 

First thing I must say is the decor. The look and feel and the cleanliness will surely touch your heart. Very well managed space I must say. The staffs were very well behaved and friendly. 

I ordered jumbo King Prawn and Josiko Curry - Lamb. King prawn was awesome. What I like most was the garnishing and the way it was presented. Josiko Currry with Lamb was amazing. Extremely juicy slices of Lamb perfectly mixed in a thick gravy. I also ordered for Tamaki Sushi. It was absolutely amazing in taste. However I feel the wasabi sauce needs a little more care. Apart from that everything about the place is great. 

Thanks for bringing the Japanese Cuisine and that too so near to my place :)

though the quantity of sushi is decent for the price they charge the quality was not up to my expectation ...my bill was about 2200..for two people and that left me wanting too !!! In terms of food the  sushi left much to be desired...the ambiance was very pleasant though the authenticity of the food left much to be desired in terms of the palate as well.The staff were pleasant and efficient ...but i guess everything  isn't always perfect ....i would miss this restaurant if i wanted authentic japanese food.....they do serve thai and chinese too.....but i can't say cause i never tried it!!!!

probably my love for sushi took me there..actually this is probably the first Japanese themed  restaurant in the city.However,it was not-so-good experience.the nigiri sushi platter was simply horrible.Pathetically cooked(or uncooked) sushi almost made me puke.Anyway,the seafood rice teamed with joshiko pork was sumptuous. Seafood rice ha ample amount of prawns,squids and baby octopus in it which gave it a real nice texture and taste.curry was mild,creamy and smooth.So,my advice is if you are a sushi-lover then probably give it a second thought before stepping in.

A nice, cosy place with splendid service. The Japanese cuisine is what we ordered for considering the name of the restaurant. The Maki Sushi was super and comfortably priced. The Chicken Golden Curry was decent, with enough room for improvement. The portions are sufficient for 2 people. Don't go there with great expectations, it's not an overwhelming but a satisfying experience.

Visited this place today for lunch. we ordered a combination of Chinese and Thai dishes.
The Thai dishes such as green curry, red curry, tom yam soup , Pad Thai noodles  were excellent and the service was also very friendly.  The presentation was very professional with vegetables carved as flowers served with most dishes. would definitely like to go there again.
The Chinese rice dish was a bit of a let down as it was dry and seemed like it was on hold for a while. A La Carte priced appeared a bit steep considering its location.

Went to this place for lunch yesterday hoping for some good Jap food. I guess my expectations were a tad bit too high. 
Stay clear of the sushi on offer here. Possibly the worst I've had...balls of sticky rice with very little of the filling (and the salmon wasn't even fresh). Unpalatable would be the apposite word to describe those rice balls served with diluted wasabi and desi ginger (not the pink ones that are usually served with sushi). 
However, the Miso Ramen soup was surprisingly nice...although the 'dashi' was highly 'Indianised'.
The ambience was kitsch. Gaudy music posters adorned the wall and that just seemed highly incongruous in a place which purports to be a fine dining oriental restaurant. And the music they were playing was Hindustani Classical.
The service though is impeccable and the staff is very hospitable. Our waiter, Mr Rajesh, was very forthcoming with suggestions whilst ordering and the food was brought to the table promptly. 
My advice - stick to the Chinese section of the menu and you won't regret it

Wasabee creates a good first impression due to its warm ambiance and the classical music that was being played at the background. The waiters were polite and very efficient in their service. The Japanese food that we opted for was good, though i am not sure how authentic it is. The only downer was the highly diluted dessert, Chocolate Monk.

I went to Kolkata on a week long trip and dined at this restaurant on the last day of my stay there. The ambience is good,comfortable. Service is fast. Although menu offers many options under Japanese and Thai and Chinese, only a few seemed satisfactory. The soups and starters are very good but the main course options aren't up to the mark. A chicken preparation and a lamb preparation both tasted as if they'd been cooked in maggi masala. However the sushi was good, although the rice covering was a tad too thick, chicken satay with peanut sauce was also pretty good, though not the best. The japanese grilled fish preparation was tasty. A decent place to visit, though slightly overpriced.

Every body deserves a second chance...other than abject idiots. So walked into Wasabee again. And the menu was slim and trim, svelte even ;with the Indian section taken off altogether. A wise decision indeed.
And pork is back. Hallelluiah.
Miso soup was very good, loads of shitake mushrooms...pork teriyaki was very tasty indeed. 
Presentation is better. Even the fresh lime soda had a (so called) cherry to jazz up things... Cannot comment much on authenticity as all Japanese food i had was out of japan. 
Toilet is clean and the decor is nice.
Service is very good. They have turned things round-admirably so...so good luck to them.

Wasabee is a fine restaurant which is serving some lip smacking and mouth watering Thai, Chinese and Japanese food in Kolkata. I am a foodie who has visited almost all the small and big restaurants in Kolkata with my family in the recent past. Wasabee would surely impress you because of a number of factors.
Firstly, it is located at a convenient place and finding a parking spot is never a problem. 
Secondly, the ambiance and hospitality of the restaurant and its waiters is something that would impresses you instantly. 
Thirdly, and the most important factor is that, the quality of the food is extremely good. The mushroom preparations, the yellow and green Thai curries, the Japanese sushi with the famous wasbi sauce are some of my hot favorites in the interesting menu. The sizzling brownie with the ice cream of your choice is something to die for ! 
Now to sum up my entire experience, it was a pure gastronomic treat :D

Started well, standards slipped pretty fast. Huge menu and a large Indian section( what IS Indian cuisine anyway?) Why? why would one like to eat mutter paneer in a restaurant called WASABEE? Why eat paneer in the first place...but that is another discussion.

No alcohol.

There was pork but not any more. Suggest they take off all non-veg items and call it Wasabee Bhojanalaya for a more authentic experience.

Also, had pork but now has been taken off the menu-why not take all non-veg item off the menu and call in WASABEE BHOJANALAYA.

We went to Wasabee yesterday evening after having read the wonderful reviews on this website.
Our expectations were high - considering this joint belongs to a well-know Tabla / percussion exponent of Kolkata.
However, the sight of mosquitoes flying around the place gave a VERY VERY BAD first impression.
The website mentions "BAR AVAILABLE". Sorry - they don't serve liquor. Another negative point.

Coming to the food, we went for chicken, fish, sushi, rice, chowmein and all of them tasted pathetic.
The salt content was extremely high in chicken and fish dishes and the portions for all the items was very very less.
Overall, the experience was REPULSIVE. It was a bad idea to go there. Bill for 6 of us came to approx Rs. 5000. Over-priced menu and disgusting food quality. Bad ambience, looks more like a road-side dhaba.
If only hanging some japaneese scripts and hand fans could turn any joint into Wasabee, then the promoters have set out on a wrong foot!!
WILL DEFINITELY DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM WASTING THEIR MONEY AT WASABEE - BETTER GIVE TO A BEGGAR!!!
