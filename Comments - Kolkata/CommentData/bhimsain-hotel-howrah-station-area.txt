Myself Samrat, I have experienced a very very bitter evening yesterday at Bimsain Hotel. On the said time when I sat in a bar of the said hotel (ground floor), one of the bar man touched my body and driven out from the bar. This is because of to smoke a bidi during drinking. Okay I admitted it may be the violation of bar rule but there should be a proper manner to communicate the same. I also reported the matter to the manager but no any response came from him.This is a very shameful phenomena for a renowned hotel. I was too much insulted from the said matter and this message for the higher management to take a significant action on the culprits.. Today in every business every customer is essential and getting same importance-Â  it is a fact. Just mind it................
