I ordered Mexican rice with spicy veg curry last time and it was almost perfect but yesterday I repeated my order but to my horror what came was something else but surely not mexican rice or curry. It was like indian red spicy rice with indian sabzi dish...No flavour no taste ridiculously bad...I called up the no given on the box and he gave me excuse tht chef who use to cook mexican has left and new chef actually don't really know how old chef use to cook..I also order Vegetable Pizza but tht only had cheese and capsicum on it and vey badly prepared.....He told me he will call back after checking but he never did....Better to avoid this place now....

This restaurant really took me by surprise. I ordered some food as it was very near to my house and recently i had heard accolades of this one. I ordered veg delight pizza, mixed sauce pasta, Mexican rice and jacket potato, crispy mushroom and malai kofta. Surprisingly, I liked everything and definitely looking forward to ordering more in future.

Hey foodies... today I have tried a new food joint near my place. It's a very new joint & It's situated at girish park & barabazar joint crossing, just opposite of Rabindra Bharati Campus. It's a vegeterian (not pure veg.- like Jain cuisine, onions & garlic will be there) joint. Today I have taken a home delivery, which take more than an hour to deliver. Now come to thefood part. I have ordered :
1- Aloo Paratha(too bad),
1- Kabuli Naan(sweet in taste, for cherry as toppings, so just ok),
1- Masala Naan(good, but not as expected),
1- Pindi Chole(best of all, even 1 of the best chole I used to have). They also complimentary given Pickle, Pickled Onions & Green Chillies. So, I have a doubt in my mind to rate them. As of me, their bread items are not good as seen, bt they have good side dishes & main course items, which can be affordable in spite of their price in on higher side. Just giving my points as below :

1. Food quality - 4 / 5. (Exclude chole it is just - 2).
2. Food quantity - 3 / 5.
3. Ambience - ??? / 5.
4. Varity of food - 3.5 / 5.
5. Service - 3 / 5.@
6. Price @ food - 2/ 5. (1 is costlier 5 is cheaper)
7. X factor - Just opposite of Rabindra Bharati Campus.

Pathetic service... They deliver pathetic food. I ordered for white sauce arabbiata pasta it completely sucked... Never in my life I had such a pasta.. It didn't tatsed at all like a white sauce pasta it has no cheese in eat.... And the  garvy babycorn is pathetic too... It has so much gravy and chilli that no one can eat.... Really its a complete waste of money... Will never ever order from this place in my life.

When we arrived there was no attentand to our table.. the only person present refused to take order and asked us to go to reception and place the order... As there was rush we went with the situation but later he completely ignored us.. yet he was serving others.. we waited for about 35 mins but no food was served... They did not even prepare our food... There was no attendent to atleast serve water to our table.. 
Such poor is the services... The manager didn't even try to hear our query and console us that our food was being prepared... The food is aver😅😥age yet such poor service.. I bid the people ordering here done waste ur time and prestige in the restaurant...if u wanna loose it patience u might as well try... Even before my last visit they were serving wrong order to us... None of the attendent there is qualified to serve tables... And again there is about 20 min waiting time on table even when the restaurant is empty.... They even evade taxes... Hope u guys find it useful... There are other restaurants in Girish park area go for them... Atleast they will make u feel like in an actual restaurant... Thankyou...

Rasoidaan pleasantly surprised me with the quality of their pure veg. continental dishes. It's located in the busy Ganesh Talkies area where a tragic event happened not so long ago. The South Indian items are not always  available & I haven't yet tried out the North Indian dishes. My rating is based on the services provided & the taste of the continental dishes. A must try if you live nearby.

Located near ganesh talkies, opposite to Frank Ross pharmacy. Earlier it was known as 'Social hub Kafe',
Pretty decent eatery at Ganesh talkies. Simple ambience but great food. 
I have been to this place several times and it's one of my favorite place to sit and eat.
We have ordered -
Hakka noodles : noodles were okayish.
Crispy chilly baby corn : chilly baby corn was perfectly made
Mix sauce pasta : this dish will make you visit this place again and again only to have this drool worthy mix sauce pasta
Baked macroni : baked macroni is also mouth watering 
Italian sizzler : Italian sizzler is good
Mexican rice with jacket potato : amazing is the only word for this dish
Burger : it wasn't upto the mark, too dry burger.

This is a late review, sorry I had been busy eating out some really good food and even busier thinking about where to eat and what to eat, that's what kept me from reviewing so many places... So a 'maafi' is long due to my followers! :) I had absolutely no knowledge about this new eatery that had opened near my home. Thanks to Zomato I was fortunate enough to come to know of this place and even order online from here.
----------
This was my first tryst with Zomato's online feature and I would like to say, you guys did win me over. It was a rainy day hence ordering in was the best way to satisfy my hunger pangs.
Since I was ordering in from a new place I wanted to play it safe, but for someone like me who is experimental with her food choices... I decided I will play it safe with a hint of experimentation.

So I ordered crispy chilly baby corn, aloo paratha, Kashmiri aloodum, Mexican rice with vegetable Le Cordon bleu.
Crispy chilly baby corn- it was tasty and tangy, not too extraordinarily good, but comforting.
Aloo paratha- I was not too satisfied with this, because honestly I have had better than this. It tasted a bit floury.
Kashmiri aloodum- it was tangy, spicy, red with just the right kind of oil. Some might find it a bit oily... But it was amazing in taste.
Mexican rice with vegetable Le Cordon bleu- this was the master blaster that sealed the deal. I had zero expectations from this dish and probably that's the reason it outshone all the others. It was cheesy tangy with just the right amount, kind and size of Vegetables. The Mexican rice on the side was also very flavourful. The rice was fluffy and had just the right zing to go with the vegetable Le Cordon bleu.

Do give this place a try and be sure to be surprised.
Cheers! ✌🍻

After various attempts , got successful in placing the order . Ordered Hakka noodles , chilly paneer - gravy , and a paneer tikka burger . The delivery was prompt as mentioned on Zomato with no delay. However, the food was NOT upto the mark . Hakka noodles was average to taste, chili paneer was requested to be spicy - but then it was neither spicy nor had any taste .. totally bland ! 
Coming to the paneer tikka burger - it looked stale to me . Not good ! 
1.5 stars for the timely delivery, neat packaging and staff carrying change .

Been in Ganesh Talkies today for some work.
Was very hungry around 8 so thought of visiting this small cafe. This cafe came out much better than what I thought.
Ambience was full of young couples and college boys.
Service was fast and prompt.
I ordered Mixed Sauce Pasta
And Cheese Garlic Bread
Garlic bread was just FAB !
Was a little loud for my taste buds but seriously it was one of the best garlic bread I have ever tasted!
Pasta though didn't come upto my expectation as it missed a little on taste.
Salt was less as well as it wasn't mixed up well!
I think They should keep oregano dispenser with food!

Ambience was okay, with a tv playing songs.
Little messed up but okay!

Con : Salt dispenser was very old and was not working, was jammed by some dirt or any other thing, so salt was served in a bowl which was a huge turn down!

But food was mesmirizing and a must try!

Food : 4.5
Ambience : 3
HYGEINE : 2.5
Service : Fast and appropriate so 5 out of 5
Pocket Pinch : 5 (Very affordable on Pocket)

Worth a try !

Got home delivery from them for dinner. Ordered Hakka noodles and chilli gravy potato. Both items were good to taste. Quantity wise it is just about sufficient for 1 person. Packing was nice. None of the gravy split from the containers. Will try their pasta and pizza the next time. Pizza packing is a disaster. They should provide a plastic table for separating the pack with the pizza. It gets stuck in the pack.

This review is based on home delivery. So ambiance, hygiene etc. are not considered. The food came packed neatly, and they know the areas they service pretty well. Most of the time I have to guide the delivery boys in detail, but for them I just mentioned the nearest bus stop. The rest they figured out themselves and still the delivery was faster than most. A huge plus for that.

Coming to food, at this type of multi-cuisine restaurants, don't expect authenticity. The taste of the dishes and their names on menu might not match. But they are tasty in their own way.

We ordered Saute Mushroom, Mexican rice with jacket potato and veg au gratin. The saute mushroom had good amount of red and yellow bell peppers diced along with onions. It was tasty but a bit too spicy. The overload of Italian seasoning and chilli flakes almost killed the tender taste of the mushrooms. If they reduce the spices it would become an awesome dish.

The veg au gratin was really tasty. Filled with corn and chopped veggies we enjoyed it very much.

But the dish I liked the best was the Mexican rice with jacket potato. The vegetable rice was tasty and and not too spicy and the accompanying gravy went perfectly with it. The side dish was a real mashup. The gravy was a garlicky Chinese one. The jacket potatoes didn't had their skins and was stuffed with paneer. But who cares as long as it tasted awesome. These are local restaurants not meant to represent global cuisine, but serve tasty pocket friendly dishes. And Social Hub Kafe is a winner that way.

The restaurant serves cuisines like italian, chineese and a special mention to the north indian. The north indian tastes very good. Cheese roastie rice is also one of the awesome dishes.

Went there with some friends to grab some evening snacks after celebrating BasantUtsav at jorashanko thakurbari. We were actually searching for a restro to have some quick bites when we suddenly spotted this place. 
Nice decor, comfortable and cosy ambience. A cool place to hangout with friends. The staff was really cordial. They made sure we had a good time over there. 
We ordered chilli garlic noodles. 
Tastewise - Well.. A bit spicy and the flavours are not worth mentioning coz its a simple noodle dish so on the flipside we thought we could have ordered just the hakka noodles only.

This place is located in Ganesh Takies a very well known place near Girish park....
It is a treat and a much needed restaurant for burra bazaar people...
It serves u nearly all the cusines from starters north Indian Chinese and quite
good variety of mocktails...
It has a floor sitting area and very picky friendly...such vl gve u break from all the exorbitant taxes nd charges...
The white sause pasta Garlic bread and Mexican sandwich is a good try ..
Sizzling brownie is a good sizzle...
U have home delievery services also...
So this place is jus what v local people needed..
Waiting to try the other items on the list...

Excellent place I will visit again and again. Awesome food service is only issue I guess but food covers that issue. Double cheese burger is my personal favorite.

Been there on Eid, on a hot and humid day on our way to nowhere, me and my friend found this cafe and thought it must be a good idea to explore. The menu looks excellent, though only veg! Then we realized, they don't have 95% of the stuffs mentioned in the menu. Whatever it is, apart from the sandwiches, they have nothing! We ordered Mandarine Mojito and Watermelon mojito. The waiter took the order and vanished only to reappear after 30 minutes to inform us that Mandarine is not available, well we ordered blue lagoon. We got both the drinks which you can differentiate only by the color. NO FLAVOUR WAS FOUND. We ordered lasagna. he came back in 10 saying that "madam 30 min lagega". THEN, a bunch of students showed up, and we realized, the are the primary customers and were served with optimum care. We waited till 45 minutes and went downstairs to get our bill! Though they were apologetic, but wasting almost 1.5 hours for 2 drinks which we dint like, did not impress me. Management, well done!

This cafe is placed on the main road, attracting crowd with its sign. The food is good, but their dish has to be The Italian Sizzler, and the Mixed Sauce Pasta. The crispy chilli baby corn is of average quality but the brownie is not really worth a lot of brownie points. However, for the price it is worth, the food is worth every penny. As regards for the cocktails, they are of mediocre level, with a wide berth for improvement. A nice place with a nice ambiance. However the service can sometimes be a little slow.
