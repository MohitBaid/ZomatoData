One restaurant that has shown little improvement over the years, don't know how it still exists in such a prominent locality.
Even as a kid, I remember finding the bloodline running through a very raw chicken.
Nothing much has changed from then on.
Much, MUCH improvement needed.

Not even worth of a good rating. I ordered Noodles. They looked like simply boiled noodles with no spices or chicken. This place is a big no no. The decor is also below standard. I wonder if they maintain any hygiene or not.

Went there for a friend's Birthday treat.

Highly disappointed.

Chicken Biriyani was too bad and the chicken was not well fried.

I am someone who hardly wastes food, and wasted the Chicken.

When I told them, they changed the plate and gave me another one. 

The street side Biriyani sellers serve us something tastier I think.

AC? Let's not talk about that.

I went there almost 2 months back and will never visit them.

Renuka Snacks is located at Nagerbazar , Kolkata.

Ambience is ok with sitting arrangenents.

Ordered Chicken Drumsticks, mix fried rice & Chilli Chicken. Drumsticks were average. Mixed fried rice was oily and bland with less fillings. Chilli Chicken was nice but not that good.

Pocket pinch is low and service is prompt but food quality is average.

A very small place with limited food items. One of the most oldest restaurants in dum dum area and it is there sunce when i didn't understand the meaning of "cuisine" and everything was to me was a "hotel". But for sure on the eve of ostomi or saptami we definitely used to visit this place. No food is worth special mention - just choose anything to fill ur stomach in case u r too hungry or have shortage of money..that's it!!

So I am writing a review for Renuka just for the sake of 'been there,done that' kind of a thing. Renuka has seen very good days and now stands completely forgotten in the hustle bustle of Nagerbazar. They served amazing food once upon a time and now is close to ruins. Please avoid this place even if you are short on money. A roll from the nearby shop will be a much more value for money!

This place used to be Mecca for good food back in its glory days.
Ma would be like "baba get chowmein or biriyani, aaj sharir ta myajmyaj korche" 
{ Son get chowmein or biriyani, today I don't feel like cooking.} 
Now it looks like a rundown attic in a the big house called "nagerbajar more". It was famous for its Biriyani, chap and Tikiya which no more draws attention other than in festive occasions. The interiors in better times were polished and clean, now its greasy and damp. People except under desperate conditions wouldn't like dining here, instead they get they take parcels for their home.
I feel sad how time and competition has cornered renuka, a once majestic diner.

Used to love the Biryani but now they ain't up to the mark and it's not that cheap too. Well, the reason behind a 2.5 is because it's dining area is nice and AC is good. Or maybe was, now no idea.

The restaurant is specious. Once you enter you will feel so. During the pick time, it's a little hard to get a seat inside. But the main thing of a restaurant is a good food at the end. And they certainly have it.
The accommodation is nice. 
Their behavior is nice. 
The food is good. 
The price is not so high. 
Well what else do you expect while going for a dinner or lunch at a restaurant. 
Well when the next time when you are going with your special person for a dinner I say go for this one.

Renuka – Stopover When You Have No Better Choices Left! 

After visiting a lot of puja pandals, we were really starving and were probing for a place to eat.

There was an enormous queue on every hotel so we thought of visiting Renuka, at the Nagerbazar stop. 
It is unquestionably a very good place to have an eatery. 
It was my first visit.  

The ambiance was ordinary and it was quite dark. I love dark atmospheres, but I find it pretty uninteresting and mess. Moreover, there was no AC.
Thank God, It was raining or It would have got hot inside.

People were coming unceasingly and they demanded us to share the table, but gratefully one group had finished their lunch at that point of time.  
There was only one server in such a hectic time. 
We requested for water after 15 mins, and thank god we did, they must have elapsed that we were present there.

There was a different menu for this Pujo, lesser than the ordinary times. 

Anyway, from the few numbers of menu we ordered  

i) Jeera Rice

ii) Mutton Biriyani 
iii) Chicken Manchurian

iv) Chicken Tikka Butter 

They grabbed 20 minutes to come over with our order.

i) The Mutton Biriyani was acceptable. The flavor was decent. The Mutton –pieces were the conqueror. Overall it was good.

ii) Chicken Tikka Butter was a huge distress. We got a burnt feeling, still the gravy was good.

iii) Chicken Manchurian was satisfactory.

iv) Jeera Rice was nothing special. It was pretty average.

Food was middling. So I would like to embrace it in both my Pros and Cons.

Advantages: 

FOOD!

Cost-effective

Disadvantages

The facilities

The décor 

FOOD 

So if you have no healthier choices left, you can certainly visit Renuka for an inexpensive lunch/dinner. But to me charges doesn’t matter, worthy food does 

Not recommended at all. Its a dream location for any restaurant being bang on the Nagerbazar Crossing. But they totally messed up in the main section which is food. I visited them once and ordered Mixed fried Rice and Garlic chicken. The Rice smelled of smoke and the Garlic chicken was some sorrow looking pieces of chicken floating in a bland gravy. Never visited this place though its beside my house.
