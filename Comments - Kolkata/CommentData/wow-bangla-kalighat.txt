SIMPLICITY AT IT'S BEST 
Have eaten in many eateries but this one really makes you feel like home made food.
The one your aunt or cousins will prepare for you 
Ordered a Chicken Meal which consists of Rice Begun Bhaja/Potol Bhaja alur dom chicken & salad. Cost Rs 140 + taxes. The food was tasty and the presentation was neat and clean. Yes the quantity of Rice is little bit low but all the side dishes make up for it. 
Will surely recommend it for bachelor or for some one trying to have some homely food.

I ordered fish and chicken thali from them. Huge quantity. Good taste. The most important things it is home made, so no extra oil, no extra spices. Perfect. It is also budget friendly. They have done only home delivery. There are no sitting arrangement.

I have ordered special Mutton Thali from this place today. To be very honest I was surprised after getting the thali delivered. There were so many things. They didn't even miss chatni , papad and doi. The tate was very good and the packaging was very neatly done. Above all the price was very pocket friendly.

Honestly I was a little sceptical about the quality of the food. However the food did not disappoint me at all.

I'd ordered a Chicken Thali. It included Dal, Aloo Potol er jhol, bhaat, aloo bhaja,chips, chicken curry (4pieces) and chutney. The quantity impressive given the price.

The packaging was great. A must try for authentic Bengali food lovers.

The originality and simplicity of food impressed me. Definitely going to try again. :)

Firstly I was but sceptical about ordering the lunch from this place. Having no review , no rating I was not not getting any credible review to decide on choosing this place.
So after thinking twice, I settled down with 5Chicken Thali and 1 fish Thali.
Chicken Thali costs 90+ 12for packaging
Fish Thali costs 75+12for packaging.

The chicken Thali had Rice , Dal, 2 Sabji, Alu Bhaja, chicken 3pieces medium size, chutni.
Fish Thali had one large piece fish instead of chicken .

The food was tasty, very homely. Even though their simple Thali don't have Alu Bhaja, they gave it as complement. The delivery was free and on time.

Lovely, value for money food for office lunch.
Only bad side is that the quantity of rice was bit less.
Quality is good. Packing is haygenic.
All in all a must try if you are looking for excutive Bengali lunch at your office.
