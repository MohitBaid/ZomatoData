Best place to have a cup of hot cardamom tea on a cold winter evening and awesome lassi on a hot summer afternoon. Their sweets and club kachori are very nice.

This is one of cheap and best place that I have visited. Went here quite a few times. The tea, kochuri, nimki, gulab jamun and jalebi r hot favorite dishes. Especially the mirchi achar with kochuri makes me drool over it. Ive never been disappointed after visiting the place. But recently I visited the place to pack some food for my family. I repeatedly told the man to give the mirchi achar while packing and he said he will. When I came home, to my utter disappointment i found the achar missing. The gulab jamun was smelling and tasted sour.
This is a good place but whatever happened wasn't expected.

Went there with Mom for tea and snacks. Ample car parking space. A small and shabby shop with crowd thronging around. All the staff are super busy, especially the boy serving tea. I chose papri chaat and Kesar tea for Mom and mixed chaat for myself. The chaats were wonderfully prepared - very tasty. They prepared just as per instruction. A miracle as to how they remembered it in the crowd. Mom said the tea was also good, not too sweet but heavy and served in a clay cup after a long time.

Price reasonable, location ok, staff were professionals. We have decided to return here again next week.

Great place to have an evening snack. They make brilliant tea and their jalebis are to savour! 

It's located behind the laketown sarbojonin Puja arena. Must visit if one is looking for an evening/morning snack.

There is a reason why Bengali people love to indulge over tea and 'adda'. With so many quaint joints around the city quietly serving amazing tea in clay pots in combination with various snacks, it comes as no surprise that loyal customers throng to their favourite adda spots every evening.

Living in rented apartments can be difficult and God knows how many times my family has moved around the city in search of the perfect apartment. Having recently moved to Rajarhat, it was my mom who set out in search for the perfect tea and discovered Sharma Snacks. With stools laid around to sit and enjoy some hot samosas over tea, Sharma's serves customers of all age groups.

The kachori served with aloo sabzi is crispy and absolutely delicious with the chutney acting as the much needed complement with the same. The tea wasn't too sweet (just the way I like it) and sufficiently thick with the clay pot adding a flavour of its own. Teamed with the hot samosas, it tasted like heaven and proved the fact that nowhere in India will you find a place that adores it's food as much as Bengal does.

Make it a point to visit the place if you are around the area. Afterall, all you need for the perfect 'adda' is always some good tea.

Name any marwari food, and this place has got you covered. From snacks to sweets this shop will blow you with it's taste. On weekends this shop is always filled with customers, especially in the mornings when people try hard to even get to enter the shop and get their hands on the hot delicacies being made.

Sharma is located bang opposite to the Lake town AC market. Its really famous for their club kachori, jalebi and chai. I am also fond of their specialities. Its a great place to break your fast and kick start a day. In a plate of club kachori they will give you 5 club sized super hot kachori with aloo,paneer, matar sabji and green chatni. But nowadays I feel that they have cut down the amount of paneer and matar in their sabji which is a bit disappointing to me. Their jalebis are my absolute favourite! Then comes their rabri which is my second favourite!! They really make some awesome marwari sweets. I have tried their veg sandwich but I really didn't like it. It was very dry and flavourless. Than comes their lassi.  I ordered lassi and when it came I saw that the lassi wasn't anything to die for. I feel that their lassis are overpriced. I'll prefer shyambazar's or esplanade's lassi over sharma's lassi. One should try out all their food items at least once but one shouldn't miss their jalebi ever!!

An institution in itself, The Sharma Tea and Snacks franchise is one of the finest places to be at when it comes to tea and vegetarian snacks. Have been to their Bangur and Saltlake Swimming pool outlets as well, this place is a great one. I have had their dhokla, piyaz kachori and absolutely am in love with the Doodh Cola. 
They make a great cuppa. Served in bhands, i.e clay cups..... It takes the kullad wali chai famous. A bit pricey if u consider the tea. They charge 30 bucks for a large bhand. 

A good place to catch up with friends over chai and pakodas, this place is in one word outstanding.

Sharma Snacks is located near Manasha Mandir Bus stop in lake town. I ordered a Lassi from there via swiggy. The quantity was sufficient for the price. But the taste wasn't good. I felt the milk to be stale. It was giving off a foul smell too. Couldn't take the risk to finish off the entire lassi.
On a second order, I had rabri. It was dry. Didn't have milk in it. But still it was okay. At least better than the lassi. Improving the rating by 0.5

Well, I begin with a big thank you note to the Management of Sharma Snacks, Lake Town ‚Äì who simply made my evening ‚Äì with their signature Kesaria tea.

After watching a movie with my friend, we strolled around and hit upon this place, conveniently situated near Jaya Cinemas, Lake Town. Having due regards to the mild rainfall in progress, we decided to have a cup (errr ‚Ä¶. Bhaand) of tea from here. It was perhaps the best ever I had in my life - or atleast ‚Äì to the extent I can remember ‚Äì I am still in veneration of that and thinking what elements had been used in the making to impart a taste of that level. One thing I could easily figure out that milk/ tea had been over boiled to make it denser and condensed ‚Äì rest I couldn‚Äôt.

For sides, we ordered a plate of poori bhaaji (or kachori sabji ‚Äì whatever thy name) ‚Äì which was prepared live and served hot-n-fresh. It was fine, sabji ‚Äì tasty, although, the poori lacked the fluffiness and slenderness I anticipated.

Moving over to the ambience, there is none ‚Äì as the shop is pretty small ‚Äì no seating arrangements are available, although, I strongly feel that a few chairs can be accommodated outside. Prices are reasonable ‚Äì but they seriously need to work upon the hygiene factor ‚Äì specially considering the monsoon. Service is fine.

Well, to sum up ‚Äì they can very well change their name to ‚ÄúSharma Snacks and the Tea experts‚Äù.

Maybe the most trusted chain of fastfood joints in kolkata where you get tasty kachoris jalebees dhokla lassi tea etc etc. Particularly this place is very very small. Hardly you can stand and eat. As this place is crowded all the time, its possible you have to wait for your turn, so patience is must. The only reason i come back to this place is for great club kachoris.

They say they put paneer in sabji.. But u really need a magnifying glass to look for 1... Sharma is famous for its kachori they say... How? Why? Please eat anything but not kachori from this shop...,

Easily rate as one of my best CHAI breaks.¬†
The place was introduced to me by a friend, who most probably dragged me to Sharma's for the first time. On later occasions he still had to do the same as I was the one who wouldn't go without ¬†having at least 3 cups of tea. [chai and sutta]
The first time when my friend took me there, they put some Kesar in the tea and they called it masala chai, I was so excited that i burnt my tongue :P ... but all that was acceptable as from that time onwards I was going to be a regular customer.¬†
This tea madness started when I was in college and it's safe to say that I am a ¬†TEAKHOR by now.¬†
My first visit to Sharma's was on 2010 and it rolled smoothly till 2013 and then ended abruptly. .... :(
I still miss the piping hot GULAB JAMUNS and SAMOSAS. The RABRI they used to prepare was simply irresistible although it had no extravagance in it, yet simply exceptional.¬†
I used to take that RABRI ¬†back home, my folks appreciated it too. I took my MA to have tea a couple of times and for the funny part she too burnt her tongue in the first sip :P¬†

Located in one of the residential lanes of Lake Town this joint has catered to the local people for years now. The entire tea making process itself is a treat for the eyes where the frothing milk is treated with ginger, sugar and tea leaves to bring out the special aroma in the tea. To sip the tea from the clay glasses is a different experience altogether.  
They also sell kachoris and samosas along with other snack items.  So if you are looking for a morning breakfast with a typical indian flavour you can try out the items here. The hot kachori and sabji will boost your day.  
Do not expect a very clean ambience here ad there is too many things going on in the same shop and the waiters are mostly in chaddi and banian.

When I found out my favorite place for tea has an outlet at a stone's throw from my tuition, I was overjoyed. Since then, the entire friends' group has visited Sharma's after every session.

Situated by the Manasabari bus stop, Sharma Snacks (like its other outlets) serves possibly the best lassi I've had till now in Kolkata. I totally in love with their "bhaar" of tea as well.

We would regularly feast on their hot kachori and club kachori, with some jalebi to complement them. Though we love the kachoris, they seemed better a couple of years back. The pakora platter is also a nice choice, provided you have them as long as they stay hot and retain the crunch.

Prices are very, very reasonable. Eating here is never a disappointment.

P.S. They never hesitate to pamper you with extra malai on your lassi. Just go ahead and ask for it. :)

Easily rate as one of my best CHAI breaks.¬†
The place was introduced to me by a friend, who most probably dragged me to Sharma's for the first time. On later occasions he still had to do the same as I was the one who wouldn't go without ¬†having at least 3 cups of tea. [chai and sutta]
The first time when my friend took me there, they put some Kesar in the tea and they called it masala chai, I was so excited that i burnt my tongue :P ... but all that was acceptable as from that time onwards I was going to be a regular customer.¬†
This tea madness started when I was in college and it's safe to say that I am a ¬†TEAKHOR by now.¬†
My first visit to Sharma's was on 2010 and it rolled smoothly till 2013 and then ended abruptly. .... :(
I still miss the piping hot GULAB JAMUNS and SAMOSAS. The RABRI they used to prepare was simply irresistible although it had no extravagance in it, yet simply exceptional.¬†
I used to take that RABRI ¬†back home, my folks appreciated it too. I took my MA to have tea a couple of times and for the funny part she too burnt her tongue in the first sip :P¬†
Sharma's ei pujotey dekha hocche :)

Looking for garam chaay and jalebi with club kachori for breakfast in or around lake town, head to this place. Specially on Sundays they make ghee jalebi, its yummy. Be ready to jostle in to get the food and have it standing on the footpath. They do parcel things for take away.

Mostly vegeterian foods are available. But they are really pure and tasty. Not too costly in comparison to the place.
Kachudi and jilipi is good.

I will give one thumb up at least.
