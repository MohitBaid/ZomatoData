Taste is so good with reasonable price. They even serve better quality than some restaurants in Chinatown.
I must visit this place whenever i came tangra.
Takeaway is suitable here..

This local shop is situated quite close to my place.
Their Chilli Chicken is recommended,
The noodles and rolls are okayish.
Takeaway is the best option.
Local people could give it a try.

Location: Its a small place near Panchkuri. 
I've tried the chicken momos here which were not that good. The Chicken noodles and the roll here is good.

Small food joint tried chicken noodles and dry chill chicken... Noodles was average but dry chill chicken was spicy and tasty. It's not so tidy and clean.. it's near to my maternal uncle's house. I have also tried there rolls too it's good.

This place is very close to my place.
Momos from here are not recommended
I often take away their Dry Chilli Chicken. It's spicy and great.
Their gravy noodles are also good. The Hakka one, not as good.
One thing here is, the attitude of the staffs are very bad. Firstly, they make you wait too long and then don't even give you ₹100 change for ₹70 order. They will simply tell you to get change in order to get your food.
I only come to this place for their Dry Chili Chicken. Otherwise, there are other joints in this area which serves good food with better behaviour.

Had their food many times. They serve both Indian and Chinese but not Biryani. It is mainly a take away counter with few chairs placed outside, located near the Tangra-Howrah bus stand(Tangra). The Chinese items are really tasty like mixed rice, chilli chicken, mixed gravy chow. The prices are reasonable as compared to the quality but the service is little bit on the slower side.

Walking distance from my home. Its a local shop where you can get from rolls to main dish like fried rice and all that. Pocket friendly though they take a bit of time to get your orders done.
