Have tried the murgh malai and zeera kabab along with tandoor prawn. The kababs were no doubt delicious  do was the prawns. The food was tasty and also non spicy. Biriyani  was not that good as expected.

Somewhat tasty, non tasty foods but less quantity with so high prices. Old Calcutta theme was just ok. Pathetic non stop Bengali folk songs is being played so proudly which they will not change irrespective of requests. Good option for NRI's who would go to a nostalgia zone ordering dub chingri, kosha mutton, luchi, nolen gurer sondesh etc etc with a city view.

This is the worst place to have a lunch or dinner..... Quantity is not satisfactory as compared to price...
For e.g say Biryani -- Mutton biryani costs ‚Çπ500 and they give it only in a small handi with a lot of rose water in it so that you can't have the whole.....
And the Bengali food is just worst.... That's all

I have visited Charnock's off and on over the years with my family. They do some great Indian food, with a special mention for their Chicken Seekh Kebabs, some of the best I have had. Their Paneer Makhani and Murg Par Luft are also good. I was happy to visit it again the other night with my parents and grandmother. I had the Nizam E Murgh and laccha parantha for myself, and tried my mom's Kosha Mangsho. The chicken came in unusual rectangular boneless pieces and was really yummy, in a delicately flavoured creamy gravy. The parantha was crispy yet soft, and generously sized - one was enough for a hungry adult! The mutton was surprisingly good - I am not a huge fan of mutton, but this had a lovely spicy flavour. I also tried my grandmother's Murgh Malai Kebab and found it good, though a little too sweet for my taste. Afterwards I had coffee - I will note here that the coffee was kind of disappointing, just regular instant coffee, and not strong enough either. But overall, the quality of food is very consistent here, and service is prompt as well. A very good option for family dining! :)

I went there for the nabo barsho dinner. They had organised special menu for bengali new year. The spread was lavish. Situated in the 9th floor right opposite the Salt lake stadium, it gives a good view of the stadium and the township. The interior were well lit, had been styled in the lines of zamindar bari. They had live classical music for the occasion and the singer was very good. However, the chairs and the table cloth were very dirty, full of spots. In fact we had to change one of the chairs - someone had spilt chutney on it and they didn't bother to change it earlier.
We were welcomed with aam pora sherbet which was the perfect welcome drink. They served in a clay plate covered with banana leaves. The starters -  the kumroful with fish paste was pretty innovative and good. The egg plant fry was also pretty good. The thin potato fry with shrimps was decent. The daal was good as well. The pabda was pretty good though it looked a little spicy. The mutton  was very good and was the highLight of the menu. The chicken can be ignored. I didn't like The amada chicken.The prawn was good but we were so full that we could not relish it fully. The prawns were little bland as it seemed they were not marinated enough. The coolfie and baked rasogolla was good, but they are Not prepared in-house. 
With attention paid to the chair and table cloth, it can grow into a better restaurant.

Their special occasions menu are always out of the comfort zone and something inventory. Went for a nabobarsho(bengali new year) lunch special buffet. The ambience is typical of old school restaurants‚Äã with big glass shades.being at the top you can see the roof of salt lake stadium at the same height. Coming to the food-
The greeting glass of aampora sharbot ( mango panna  sort of) gave a accelerator push to the appetite.
The non veg thali had ghee bhat( rice with desi ghee drops on it), kumrophul(pumpkin flower) stuffed with fish paste, spinach kochuri with chholar dal( lentil of bengal gram) to be mentioned.
The pabda preparation turned out to be good with well made spices.
Aam ada posto murgi (chicken in mango,ginger and poppyseed paste) was a winner, very different and unique too.
Thakurbarir mangsho could have been made better.
In dessert i liked the orange kulfi with drunken boondi and baked rasogolla.
Ending with a misti paan made the day.
Service is courteous but tad slow. But in food section they keep surprising every year.
P.s. the chef too comes and sees if all dishes are on track.

I had gone to this place during the pujas with parents and husband and son. Got quite a choice from their menu....bengali food for parents,north indian for husband and continental for son and myself. First ...the bengali food...it was too good. My parents really loved the polao,potoler dolma and kosha mangsho. Hubby was quite happy with his naan and chicken tikka masala . But nothing could surpass the taste of the lobster thermidore...which my son had. I had pasta which was not great but good. Theview was lovely with clouds hovering in the distance. It was a nice experience.

Bengali Thali With 18 Veg Items @ Charnock's, Kolkata, India ‚ò∫

Food Event: Nababarsher Mahavoj
 
Duration: 15 - 16 Apr 2017

Time: 12:00 pm - 4:00 pm, 7:30 pm - 11:00 pm

Situated on the 9th floor of Charnock City i.e. the building at a small distance, on the left of AMRI Hospital (Salt Lake), Charnock's is an 82 seater multicuisine restaurant, with magnificent top view and old Victorian style interior. 

It's an 'L' shaped restaurant with an active bar and two rectangular 'baramdas', which are basically semi enclosed settings on elevated platforms, meant for live singings and renditions on special occasions. One of the walls is adorned with a life size pencil sketch of Lord Ganesha by Late M F Hussain. Apparently, the legendary painter was present at the restaurant's inauguration in 1998. That is when he sketched it live!

To usher in the upcoming 'Poila Baisakh' i.e. the Bengali New Year, that falls on 15 Apr 2017, Charnock's is serving 'Nababarsher Mahavoj' i.e. new year's mega meal, on 15 and 16 April 2017, for both lunch and dinner. This sumptuous Thali comprises of authentic Bengali Cuisine. It is available in both veg and non veg options.

I was humbled to receive their exclusive invite for the pre-tasting of their Vegetarian Thali. Encompassing a total of 18 items, the Thali comprises of the following items -

- Beverage -

- Aampora Sorbet: This was the usual sweet and tangy, fit for summers raw mango coolant. It tasted nice.

- Starter -

- Karaisuti Narkeler Chop: Two circular pea and coconut based fritters/chops were served. They were piping hot, fresh, dense in composition and tasted excellent.

- Majar Bhaja: It comprised of thin, mid sized and fried potato juliennes. Some fried flat rice (chidwa) grains were also mixed in it. It tasted average.

- Main Course (Sabjis) -

- Sona Moong Dal Masala & Narkel Dea Chholar Dal: This was the quintessential Bengali yellow dal, with a nice coconut flavor and mildly sweet taste. It tasted very nice.

- Lau Bori Chhochori: It was a sabji made of ash gourd and lentils fritters. It tasted nice.

- Baygun Basanti Masala: It comprised of a well roasted and elegantly spiced vertical half of a long and thin brinjal, with it's outer peel and stem intact. It was perfectly cooked and tasted very nice.

- Suktani: This item was not served for pre-tasting.

- Patol Posto: This item was not served for pre-tasting.

- Mochar Paturi: It comprised of a well steamed mocha aka banana flower concoction, consisting of hung curd, cumin and mustard-chilli paste. Shaped into a square, this delicacy came wrapped in a banana leaf wrapping. It was soft, little spicy, flavorsome and tasted very nice.

- Chhanar Malaicurry: Medium sized, soft and shallow fried cottage cheese balls came dipped in a creamy curry of subtle spicing. The dish tasted very nice.

- Enchorer Kofta Kalia: It comprised of fried jackfruit dumplings, dipped in a spicy curry. It tasted nice.

- Roti & Rice -

- Misti Kumror Pur Dea Palong Kachuri: These were fried pooris, wherein the dough was infused with spinach puree and the pooris were stuffed with a mildly sweet stuffing made of mashed yellow pumpkin! 

This kind of poori, was first of sorts for me and it tasted very nice. In fact, it tasted better sans any accompanying vegetable. If served with some nice pickle and tea, it would make for a wonderful evening snack.

- Ghee Bhat: This item was not served for pre-tasting.

- Rammohan Dorma Pulao: It was a slightly yellow colored sweet rice dish, infused with fried cashews. It was garnished with few glazed cherries on top. It tasted nice.

- Condiment -

- Aamsattya Khejurer Chutney: In true Bengali eating style, this 'aam papda' and dates based, thick and sweet chutney was served at the end of the meal, just before the serving of desserts.

I asked for some papad and the servers were kind enough to get me some, which I relished with this chutney. The combo tasted excellent.

- Dessert -

- Kamala Kulfi & Drunken Boondi: This was an amazing and addictive in-house made dessert, wherein a half of a vertically slit mango was served over a bed of juicy 'boondis'. However, the yellow pulpy semi liquid encased in the bowl shaped mango peel, was not the fruit itself, but an ice cream made out of mango pulp!

Apparently, the restaurant uses a special technique, wherein they extract the mango pulp, create the ice cream concoction and insert it back inside the mango peel casing, without actually damaging or slicing the mango peel!

This ice cream was quite a revelation. It paired well with 'boondis', which were also nice in taste.

- Baked Rosogolla: This item was not served for pre-tasting.

- Palate Cleanser -

- Misti Paan: I was in no mood to rinse off the heavenly mango taste from my mouth and conscience, so I refrained from consuming this. 

The entire meal was served in a traditional manner, on clay (kachhi matti) utensils. The dinner plate was covered with a circular banana leaf. The food items were served on top of the banana leaf. 

Overall, the Veg Thali had all the primary and festive ingredients of the Bengali Cuisine. All the items were well made and served in good portions.

The staff were courteous and well trained. 

Price of Usual Veg Thali: Rs. 895/- plus taxes

Price of Junior Veg Thali: Rs. 450/- plus taxes

Situated near the Salt Lake stadium this place is quite old and one of  the most known place for family dinners.The ambience of the dining area is very nice.Have tasted quite a few items from here,the Raan-e-charnock, pomfret tandoori,daab chingri and fish milenza.All the items here swear by its quality.You know you will be getting fresh food every time you order.Prices are high but justified.Recently ordered for a Mixed grill platter via home delivery.It basically contains a portion of Raan-e-Charnock,1prawn,2 fish and 3 chicken tandoori with a kulcha and mint chutney and salad.Considering the price to be almost 1400(inclusive of taxes) I will say the quantity is less.The quality of the kebabs was very good, specially the raan is always the showstopper.The kulcha was also very nice but small in size.It would have been more appreciated if they included few more kebab and sides considering the price.Other than that as usual Charnock's maintains the food standard.

Located on the 9th floor of charnock city mall,this restaurant serves both Indian and continental...the ambience of this place is good and the service decent with a lot of variety in their menu..but sadly,the good things about this place end with these..the prices are high considering the quality of food served...and the taste is pretty mediocre,with the Indian dishes relatively better than the continental ones...they definitely need to improve their standard which I feel has gone down over the years..

Charnock's is a pretty old restaurant, located on the 9th floor of the shut down Charnock City Mall in Sector 3, Salt Lake....Located on the 9th floor of a building, you can make an easy guess, that the view you are gonna have from your seating zone , is definitely gonna be the best thing about this place and it truly is so...You get a broad view of the Salt Lake city and surrounding places and its a lovely view..The decor and ambience is really classy and exudes a sense of grandeur and sophisticacy...Coming to the food catalogue, I would definitely call it diverse...But the items are really priced pretty high..We decided to have a chicken dum biryani, which was priced @ Rs 350 and the billed amount including VAT and service tax was Rs 440, which is quite high for a plate of biryani , sufficient for only 1 (in quantity)..However, the biryani along with the raita that was served with it, tasted really good...So, I won't add to my complaints here...Staffs were decent and well behaved and service good, but slow..Do visit this place, if you are a Salt lakeian by heart and get an amazing view of the city , while enjoying you tasty enough meals..

We had a fusion of sorts here what with us ordering a chicken, mutton, and fish dish. I don't recall their names but they were good especially the chicken. A tad bit costly, though.

The ambiance is lovely though with a good view. The staff is polite and helpful. Their service is impeccable.

Had ordered their Country Apple Pie via Zomato, that turned out to be something other than a pie but an item filled with sweet stuffing and garnished with apple slices and accompanied with custard. I'm not too fond of custard, and the pie was too sweet for my palate.

Last 25th November , 2016 ,my sister's marriage was held at Charnock City Banquet Hall in 5th & 6th Floor . The ambience was beautiful. It provided a bird's eye view of Salt Lake from top floor . We even had variations in the menu. The baby corn and chicken lollipop tasted excellent which were part of our starters. The cuisine in our main course was excellent ,flavorful and was prepared with delicacy among which the "GOAN FISH CURRY" & "GOST ROGAN JOSH " tasted yummy. We received appreciation from our guests for the food,the ambience ,the hospitality and the reception offered by service caterers . We can easily say that we took the right decision in choosing Charnock City as wedding venue for my sister's wedding venue. The responsibility shown by event manager Shubhojit was incredible. We were touched by his skilled management ,cooperation and arrangement . Charnock City Banquet is highly recommended.

This is a legendary restaurant giving you a fine dining experience situated in Salt Lake Sector 3.
The wow factor of this is the view from this 9th floor restaurant, the taste buds delighting food, and the well mannered attendants. It also maintains a quiet and peaceful ambiance.
The price is on the higher side.

Had dinner at this restaurant with 2 of my friends few weeks back. Situated beside AMRI hospital, Saltlake near Stadel...it is one of those older food joints in the area which have been renovated in the recent times. As we had booked our table earlier by phone, we were asked to go upstairs straightaway.
From the "Bengali Bhoj" , we ordered Basanti pulao, Chholar dal, Pabdar jhal (prepared with gravy)... These authentic bengali dishes were aromatic, well prepared and delicious.
Among others , we went for "Cottage Cheese Steak and Corn Sizzler" (with ginger Bar-Be-Que sauce) and "Spaghetti-A-La-Bolognaise" (spaghetti in a minced meat sauce) ...both of which really disappointed us. Kashmiri Dum Aloo tasted nothing extraordinary. A large chunk of bengali dishes on the menu were unavailable. Same was true for desserts (everything except ice creams)...so much so that we had to let go of that part completely. 
The decorations are intended to provide a royal vibe to the diners. The ambience is pleasant, although the dimly lit environment may put off some foodies. Most items were overpriced with respect to contemporary restaurants and food standards. The servers were courteous but took a really long time to serve.

Visited this place for our team lunch and was not expecting much from this place. But was taken to surprise because this place has a very great ambiance like a old street of kolkata. They offer some authentic bengali food apart from other north indian food. In starters we have ordered majorly tandoor stuff and in main course bengali food. Everything was prepared very nicely and service was fast and nice.

They need to work on lights despite having an ok interiors it was not giving a pleasant feel , but well staff was courteous so it keeps you motivated to give some order , for a North India Bengal is all about fish & rolls m so the first thing which we ordered was malai maahi tikka and bhetki Paturi , tikka was awesome 4/5 , i wish Paturi would have some more of mustard base , still it was ok 3.5/5 , paneer kasundi (tikka ) was just ok 2.5/5 , they should have marinated more , daal Amritsar was awesome 4.5/5 ,kangaroo sabji was god it's more of mix veg but was bit oily , all together an ok pace with good food but not that great , they didn't had anything in sweatdish other than ice cream , which was a bug let down . My advice in core place of Kolkata of u don't serve mishthi doi & rosogulla or any authentic sweetdish than u are not having pulse of your guests , please work on this .

This restaurant offers lovely city view as it is situated on the higher floors, making the experience even more delightful.
Now coming to the food, every dish we had ordered for was delicious and served us well. Very efficient staff and instantaneous services were delivered. Would love to visit this place over and over again.

I don't like Bengali cuisine much. But Charnock didn't disappoint me. Though it didn't satisfy me a lot either. "Okay to go once in while if your parents force you" sort of placeüòÇ The ambience is nice. It provides a great bird eye's view from the top. The food is okayish. We had Murgh Tandoori and murgh seekh kabab in starters. They were quite good. But the Bengali dishes weren't. We had luchi and chholar daal. They were still okay. The basanti pulao was a bit turn off. My parents had some Fish side dish. I took a spoonful of gravy and I didn't like it at all. To satisfy my sweet tooth, I had a Kesar pista ice cream. Well, to conclude, Charnock's is not a bad place. Gotta try the north indian cuisine once. But to match the class of bengali cuisine like that of Oh! Calcutta, it has to improve!

My fiance treated me on his 2004' birthday and impressed me with a sumptuous lunch here. We had overordered and really felt bad when we had to waste some. The uniqueness of the place, besides it's food is the revolving motion that gives a bird's eye panoramic view of the whole Salt Lake.

I ordered a boneless ilish for an out of town friend in the hopes for letting him in on our Bengali delicacies, but sadly charnock city managed to send me ilish with bone, even after calling up and confirming the order as boneless ilish and notifying me of increased prices. When I called to find out why they sent the wrong order I was apologised to and politely told that nothing could be done. Rather disappointed that a place I like so much was so careless with the order. 

Update: I was called by the manager and he apologised for the mistake, something rarely seen in people today.
I'm glad. Charnock hasn't lost its charm.

Looking at some good reviews about this place in Zomato I decided on to hopped in to this place located near Saltlake stadium gate 3, 4 area near Stadel beside the AMRI hospital Saltlake.¬†
The ambiance was truly impressive as soon as you enter this royal looking place and my expectation raised up with that naturally. But unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with the food they cater us which clearly was not edible at all.¬†

Started with some basic kebab which was a below average dish and pushed my impression downwards. Moving on to the mocktails they were decent and okiash. But the biggest disaster was the Mutton Biryani which was clearly a mashed rice served with some boiled mutton pieces. Also to add on the raita served with it was stale. Even after informing that no such ¬†gesture of apology or not even a good service.Utterly disappointing and not expected as they are priced at quite high. Totally thumbs down not recommended.

neat and nice place to have a drink,or two, sitting in the vicinity of Salt Lake Stadium.  Whenever there is an event in the stadium the place is abuzz with people all around.  As for the food is good though a bit expensive but the overall experience of spending time sitting beside windows makes up for it.

DISAPPOINTMENT !

Located in sector 3, close to Sojourn or AMRI (on the same side of the road). I was really hopeful about going to Charnock's because of what I had heard and read about this place. Standing tall on salt lake withstanding Kolkatas ever changing food scene.

Let me begin with saying that the interiors are marvelous. I was at awe with the place my first few seconds inside.¬† An elaborately done patio (sort of) welcomes you. The view is awesome.¬† With high ceilings, intricate interiors,¬† bold furniture, a retro-style bar counter, the place exuberated sophistication. Everything was subtle and tasteful.

We ordered a platter of Sunhari Murgh Tikka Kababand some Mutton Biryani. We had also order two kinds of mocktails-Prohibition Punch and Green Temptation(not sure if that is the exact name of the drink). The mocktails were average. The kabab tasted good. The biryani was a trauma. The rice was overcooked, the mutton tasted ok but was hoping it to be more juicier, the raita was stale. When I complained about the raita they took away the bowl and then never returned. It was at this point that I decided to leave without further ado. The prices were exorbitant compared to the quality & quantity of food.

The staff were lackadaisical and indifferent. Hoping they will improve. Wish the team all the best for the future.

I was absolutely overwhelmed by its ambience, food, view and what not. This is a highly recommend restaurant. It is on the ninth floor and you get the birds eye view of one part of salt lake. The fish with tartar sauce was amazing. Authentic sweet water bhetki cooked to perfection. The chicken stroganoff was sublime, and the quantity was generous. And finally the dish , thinking of which still gives me a foodgasmic pleasure, was the lamb shank. They were soft, juicy, tender. They were God sent succulence, to play with your feelings, to flirt with your taste buds, titillate  your olfactory senses, and then suddenly disappear deep into your guts, while you wanting for more.

Famous for typical Bengali food. Was spellbound by the ambience. The service was also very good. Though for food one has to wait about 20mins. But u enjoy the ambience and view from 9th floor in the mean time. 

The food was good. Had dab chingri (coconut prawn), Elisa bhapa (steam Elisa) and Elisa biriyani. All three tasted good but quantity to my surprise was very less. 

Zomato says dinner for two as ‚Çπ1000 but the figure is bit misleading. This place more expensive than that(~‚Çπ2000). I wanted to rate the place 4/5 but cut 0.5 points for this reason.

After a long time visited this place and wow , the towering place with the entire Salt Lake skyline in view still enthralls ! Occasion was the celebration of 48th anniversary of parents and it was absolute paisa vasool with the rain soaked weather outside. Great view , good food but customers seem to be somewhat dwindling down. Would suggest the management to encash the coming monsoon season to draw back the old crowd specially with rain soaked evenings.

To Celebrate the Poila Boishakh with my wife I visit Charnock's. The ambiance was awesome. It was well decorated and there was a live performance of Rabindra Sangeet.

The waiter greeted us with Ampora Sharbat. As it was Poila Boishakh there was only Veg and Non Veg thali. there was around 18 menus. It included Macher dimer pur dewa kumro ful bhaja, two or three types of bhajas , bhaat , Luchi, cholar dal, shukto, posto,Echore chingri, Chingri bhapa, gondhoraj murgi, Khasir mangsho, Sandesh paturi, Strawberry Rosogollar chutney , Malai Icecream and many more. The food was great and very tasty.

But the main problem is the hygiene. there was Cockroach coming out of the plate.¬†

And another point to mention the waiters were always in a hurry. They not even bothered to wait to complete a dish and repeatedly disturb to serve the next item.¬†
I don't know from where they are trained but the owners should make them understand that people came here and pay such a high price for the foods to spend quality times with their near and dear ones.

I have no complain with foods but all the Ratings I deducted it is only for the hygiene and ridiculous behavior of the staffs.

It's a restaurant which have special place in my heart...since my childhood, year 1999 I use to go to this restaurant in every occasions with my parents n other family members . It is situated just opposite to 'the stadel'(salt lake stadium) & beside 'Amri hospital'. The decoration is based on the british heritage in earlier calcutta, which potrays the lavish and luxurious culture in calcutta at that era.Ambience is soothing n calm. Icing on the cake is the view of stadium n half of the salt lake from the top, aa it is situated in the top most floor of the 'charnock city' building.It's an appropriate place for a family launch/dinner as well as any casual office lunch/dinner.
The are authentic n delicious that can be of any cuisine. I love there Bengali cuisine preparation which will make you nostalgic of the preparations made by your grandmothers. Last time we went there to celebrate my maternal uncle's b'day and choosing the restaurant was worth it. 
They too have good range of cocktails. We ordered "Black Russian" and "El Dorado", they were awesomely blended and authentic.
In food we ordered chicken clear soup,posto bara, daabchingri,Roasted lamb shank with red wine reduction, steamed rice, hilsa fry, vegetable au gratin, fried fish wit tartare sauce,nolen gurer ice cream.
Foods were yummy and satisfying. Service is excellent. Must visit for the complete food pleasure.

The place was so good specially the view out side the window was amazing. The interior decoration was average. I ate a plate of biriyani. No doubt the food quality was very good. But the cost of that biryani along with VAT and Tax was too high!! Even i didn't know was that really worth above 450Rs!!

This place has been around for a long time but somehow never got a chance to visit..but on rain swept evening it finally happened 

Ambience : The location is really a killer . You dine at the top of the world or at least saltlake if you get a window seat . The interiror are cozy . But boy of boy they seriously need to have major pest control done ....a cockroach did a kamkazi act on my draught beer !!!!!¬† They changed the glass but guys ...really ..

Food : Food was surprisingly good . The fish finger and tartar sauce combo were great so was the bengali style mutton kosha ....but the draught beer was flat and warm 

Service : As mentioned countless times before ...this is really average ...hey have been in operation for a decase almost and we expect better .

Not going bacl anytime soon ...

A good meal on a hot afternoon overlooking the entire Salt Lake and Salt Lake stadium is a desire come true. Charnocks at sector 3 Salt Lake is on the 9th floor of Charnock building. The interior has an old school charm thanks to the beautifully maintained wooden antique furniture complete with chandeliers et al. The restaurant serves North Indian, NW frontier, Bengali and continental cuisines with liquor choices. The staff is extremely polite and helpful. We had ordered Tandoori Roti, Bhetkir Paturi, Nawabi Murg and rice for lunch. For drinks we ordered Prohibition Punch, a mocktail prepared with ginger ale, lime juice, apple juice, soda with jal jeera. The drink was a respite in the sweltering heat. The dishes were absolutely phenomenonal. The Paturi was tender and juicy. The mustard flavor was just perfect without overdoing the zing. The Nawabi Murg was a new dish which we tried and were pleasantly surprised to find it mouth watering. It was neither too spicy but had a sweetness to it that we loved. All in all a wonderful experience. Would love to try some more dishes.

The Indian cuisine they serve is good as always.... So on that account there is not much to praise or complaint.... They have been there for long enough and have built a reputation for themselves.... So why you must be wondering the rating is low... The reason behind that is service.... Slow, incompetent and sometimes downright ridiculous.... A server even suggested that I didn't know that Beefeater was gin... Well since I have ordered it... I guess I must know what it is!!! The non veg kebab platter was good... The quality of food was very good... The hari mirch Mutton was tender and succulent... I am not a huge fan of the Hyderabadi school of Biryani making... Nevertheless the biryani was rather good.... And the view for which we return to Charnock's  again and again remained uncompromised!!!

The restaurant get the tick marks for many good reasons. Firstly the ambience is very good, the view from the 9th floor is really nice and internally the decor in old Kolkata style is extremely soothing to the eyes. Also getting a car parking is also easy with plenty of empty spaces around. The behaviour of the staff is impeccable and the menu is a wide range of choices. We went there recently on Republic Day and the crowd was a minimum. We ordered Mahi Malai Tikka, Makai shhekh Kabab for start. the veg item was better as the fish could have been more fresh for my liking. for the main course we had subz pulao (5/5), lasooni naaan( 4/5), safed maas (5.5/5) and jheenga jajaldeep(5/5). This was my third visit to the place and I have enjoyed every time.

If you have money and want a Peaceful time with your close ones or family, its one of the few places in Salt Lake.
The food is awesome (a bit costly too but the taste is great).
We had Continental along with wine.The ambience is flawless and the calmness inside the restaurant is really good.
For 2 foodies like us,it was around 3k(including wind and desserts)

2015 Christmas Eve Lunch just has ended with great satisfaction with unique food n ambience in Charnock's. All spheres of cuisine rated 10 on 10. A special menu they ve introduced in this festive season....Continental Food Festival n the amazing thing is the price is moderate. I took Prawn Fettacine Alfreda, Turkey roast with cranberry sauce, Duck-a-la orange, Murgh seekh kebab n Mutton La'sagne. I can't compare with any good bar n restaurant cz all foods tasted perfect n rates between rs 450 to rs 700 per plate. D quantity is huge. Must try dessart is Dutch apple Pie. Really I enjoyed d lunch hrs thoroughly. Merry Christmas to all my zomato friends...yepiiiii....

I visited this place on a Diwali night and was quite pleased to find a table beside the window with a view of the lit up skyline of the city, from the 9th floor. The ambience is calming and perfect for a dinner date. We ordered the Murgh Par Luft which is a succulent chicken kebab grilled in a coat of cheese, that's crunchy outside and soft inside. The main course consisted of Lasooni naan and Nizam-e-Murgh which was this amazingly creamy preparation with big pieces of boneless chicken. It was quite a fulfilling meal. Oh and the chakhna with the drinks was my favourite: Potato chips and peanuts!

Last week was a week of team lunches, and we went to Charnock's for a team lunch with four of my colleagues. It was quite empty when we reached there (around 2 pm) and we had no problem getting seats.

We started off with Cream of Chicken soup with Fish Fingers and Chicken Lollipops. The soup was thick and creamy with bits of chicken in it, and I relished it very much. The fish fingers tasted good with tarter sauce. The chicken lollipops were good as well.

For the main course, we ordered Chicken Stroganoff, Lobster Thermidor, and one of colleagues ordered a spaghetti dish, the name of which I forgot. For myself, I got the Sizzling White Lady fish sizzler. The best of the lot were the Lobster Thermidor and Chicken Stroganoff. Both were cooked in a creamy, cheesy sauce - which was superb. In addition, the lobster meat was scooped out from the shell and served in a bed of rice. My fish sizzler was a bit disappointing - the fish was not fresh enough, and the quantity was not very fulfilling.

Altogether, the meal was not very satisfying, considering the steep price we paid. Also, the service was pretty slow, considering the fact, that only two of its table were occupied. 

Despite these,¬† I would like to give Charnock's another chance and taste the Bengali fare there.

went there for lunch with colleagues on a weekday. at the beginning we were the only customers there and few other guests turned up after some time. even after this light load - their service was very slow, neither they had much clarity about their menu. however we ordered for cream of chicken soup, chicken drum sticks and fish finger for starters. all of these tasted good. for main course we tried lobster thermido , sizzling white lady(fish sizzler) chicken stroganoff and basil butter prawn in a bed of spaghetti.  the lobster item was very well done - scoped out of shell, cooked in a white sauce with mushroom and served on the shell on a bed of rice. it tasted great too. the basil butter prawn on the other hand was a bit under seasoned mainly the spaghetti. while my friends liked the chicken stroganoff they were a little disappointed with the quality of the fish in the fish sizzler. the bill was about a grand per person. we were seated at the corner table with an ample view of the overlooking salt lake stadium and the surrounding - which had been the USP for this place for years.

I went to Charnock's with high expectations that fell flat as I felt the food was not worth the money. 6 luchis for 175 bucks made me feel why I went there when it was available for 30 bucks outside. I felt it even more when the taste didn't live up to expectations. Cholar dal was good and so was the radha pallavi. Again quantity of dal was really poor. And can you believe there was no traditional alu dum?? Just kashmiri style. The overall quality of food was good, and view magnificent. You can try it if you are in the vicinity but not a must.

This outlet used to one of my favourite spot since the day they opened their doors. Serving the best biriyani in town at one point of time, their special items like Daab Chingri, Ilish Bhapa used to attract people from all over the city. But with the opening of so many other restaurants, slowly we stopped visiting here.

The view from here is absolutely breathtaking. The ambience is very elegant resembling a house of yesteryears with brilliant architecture. The service is very good with their staffs always attentive and well trained. 

After a long time we decided to pay this place a visit and to my surprise nothing has changed including the decors, their servers and even their table positions. We ordered for some beers and a few appetizers. The Mutton Raan we tried was very tasty and soft to my liking. Even i quite enjoyed their Tandoori Pomfret which was tandoored to the exact limit. The fish also seemed very fresh. The Fish Tandoori could have been better as i expected the tikka pieces to be on the softer side. One should also try their Prawn Thermidor which is an absolute delight.

Been there today for puja dinner with my 10 family members.First of all it was not that much crowded.Ambience was good.we ordered for chicken hariyali kebab and mahi tikka for starter.The hariyali kebab turned like a chunks of chicken and plain grilled fish half done instead of namesake mahi tikka, accompanied with mint chutney which was really really sweet.After telling the same the didn't rectify the same.What to do we started with that sweet chutney.Followed by the same we called for mutton biryani, chicken biryani, something keema chicken chicken which was recommended by the server and butter naan.The first thing came on the table was butter naan followed by biryani and they started serving the biryani.By the meantime chicken came the naan got chilled.Still we had the same but it was totally pathetic when we had the biryani.I have visited lots and lots of gud restaurant and had biryani but I have never seen biryani with green peas, cashew nut and raisins.I think it was the charnock special puja biryani and tasted like pulao.Anyway we had a bit and left the place with half empty stomach with the billing of almost Rs. 9000 which is almost equvalent to a five star restaurant. Seriously had a pathetic experience with my family as I have recommended that restaurant..Will never go back...Spoilt the last puja day dinner.

Like everyone else, I also love this place for its view from the 9th floor. Everything looks so tiny. The seating is very suave, the lighting mild and dim, and the music soothing yet a little energetic humming in the background. We prefer the seating by the window mostly for obvious reasons.

The first time I visited Charnock's was by chance and did not have an agenda. So I and my friend gulped a couple draught beers. We then ordered a tandoori chicken. It was spicy. Very spicy. We had to request the kind waiters, to give us some mayonnaise to offset the chilliness. In my next trip here, we ordered some cocktails, and that was followed with a Ceaser Salad. Very mild, very crunchy, very creamy. yum yum. 

It is a must visit for men trying to impress their women, people trying to make their relatives jealous by throwing a neat dinner party, managers trying to pacify their overworked staff, or just people who want to come, chillax and have great food complemented with a great view.

Charnock City has been a Salt Lake landmark since its opening. It was one of the first malls to come up in Kolkata with different sections on different floors to cater to people's various needs. It also introduced to the public one of the first capsule lifts. Sadly the mall is no more and the building now houses 2 restaurants, 1 bar, 2 banquet halls and an art gallery. 
     Cutting to the chase, Charnock's - the 9th floor restaurant has survived the ravages of time and has remained an abode of good cuisine throughtout. We reached the restaurant via the aforementioned capsule lift. (I mean how many restaurants olin Kolkata have access only by a capsule lift?). The ambience was really good with dim lights and soft music. You should definitely opt for window seats to have a taste of the breathtaking views. 
        I have been there hundreds of times in my childhood and i seem to remember the Continental cuisine more vividly than the others. It was no surprise then, that when i revisited the place, we ended up ordering continental! We had ordered fish fingers for starters and roast chicken & rosemary flavoured lamb for main course with fresh lime soda to go along with it all. The fish fingers were a bit overdone but they went nicely with the tartar sauce alongside. The roast chicken was properly done but it still didn't hit the mark. The crown went to the Rosemary flavoured lamb which had just the right amount of spices. The lamb was tender and the dish came with spaghetti. Do try it. The garlic bread also deserves a mention here as it was really lip-smacking.
        Definitely wo

Been there accidentally..... But was a good surprise.... Firstly the ambience was too good.... It is on the 9th floor of the building with a breath taking view of the rainy Kolkata evening.... It was raining.... The waiters are friendly and try to be prompt.... Although the food I tried there could not make me fully satisfied... Will have to try again for a confirmed opinion .... Overall nice ambience..... Should definitely visit

If you want to Charm your palate with some delectable and flavoursome Bengali cuisine with some big cash to spend then Charnock's is your place.¬†
Nizam-e-Murgh needs a special mention here because the meat was perfectly juicy along with cottage cheese and it's tenderness will simply melt in your mouth.¬†
Daab Chingri and Kochi pathar jhol (Mutton curry) was also good. Though the Daab Chingri was overly priced compared to the quantity provided.¬†
Located at 9th floor, Charnock's provides you a unique panaromic view of the Salt Lake stadium and it surrounding area which will surely mesmerize you to eat all the mouth-watering, tooth-some delicacies.¬†
But remember it's highly over-priced comparing with the quantity of food they provide.¬†
Hope this review will help you to adjudicate to visit the restro or not.¬†
Cheers! ¬†:)

In my opinion this is an over-hyped and overpriced restaurant which should not be in one's top priority wishlist. Seven of us visited this restaurant on a wednesday evening at 8 pm. It was very dimly lit restaurant, light was so low that it may cause eyestrain. ambiance is nothing great, only if you get a table by the glass wall facing the stadium then only it will be little praiseworthy but those glass wall side tables are for couples and small groups of 3 people, a large group will not be able to sit there, so the view is out of equation. no washrooms in 9th floor, you have to go to the 8th floor for that. Waiters were not at all attentive and they are not properly trained also, they didnot serve us all the foods and forgot to give washbowl to all the guests at the end.. food took awful lot of time to reach us, waiting time was very high. we ordered chicken platter, malai mahi tikka and tandoori fish and chicken lollypops for starter, all the items were very ordinary. main course was little better, nizam e murg was good but the mutton item was bad and lasooni naan was too oily and had very little flavour of garlic. mocktail was not that good also. we didn't order any dessert but still per head cost was above 900..overall average experience and i will not visit it second time for sure.

I went there for lunch on a weekday recently. Now that there is a new building on the South, the tables on that side no longer have a view. Still, the seating arrangements were not too bad, and the foreigners in our group got seats facing West (towards the stadium), so they had a view of the city skyline. The food was pretty bad, even counting the fact that it was a business lunch and I was not paying. Aam-pora sarbat (mango drink) was way too sweet. In the starters, the malai kebab was soft and slightly sweet, and the only dish that was not actually bad. The bhetki paturi was made with fish that seemed to be several days old, and solid like a rock. Not flaky at all, certain not bhetki. The dab chingri had big prawns that seemed to have been on the steam for several hours -- the texture was very rubbery, almost elastic.¬† There was no taste in the gravy. Dal was very ordinary. The Nizam-e-murgh, despite the description, seemed to have been made with a ready-to-cook gravy, or at least powdered spices of very ordinary quality. The nalen-gur ice cream is supposed to be good, but the texture was a bit odd, as if the milk had curdled. I was glad I had not been there in a long time.

We chose Charnock's to celebrate this year‚Äôs Jamaishashthi.. based on a friend‚Äôs feedback.. and mostly because my husband was dying for hilsha! Most of the reputed restaurants were not serving hilsha this year because of unavailability of good quality fish‚Ä¶ and Charnock‚Äôs qualified in this category‚Ä¶ though I understood the reason behind this later on!

Location wise Charnock‚Äôs building is pretty easy to find‚Ä¶ the difficult part is to locate the restaurant inside... we found no directives or boards which mentioned which floor to head into.. finally a peep inside the small Chinese joint in ground floor made a guy appear who let us know that its in the 9th floor!

We entered the place at 1.30 pm sharp.. and it was almost empty.. only a group of elderly people were having lunch.. A renowned Bengali joint empty in the rush hours on the day of Jamaishashthi.. pretty strange! Whatever it is, I loved the interior.. that old house look and feel created a perfect ambience for our lunch. We were seated in the corner most table. We could get a nice view of the city, but what accompanied that was the swelling heat outside. We requested the waiter to change our table but he just pulled off the curtains so as to restrict the heat. but it didn't help much.

While we were going through the menu, the waiter suggested a Mango Mocktail. All three of us absolutely adore anything made of mango and we immediately jumped into his suggestions. We looked for some Bengali starters but they said they have only Posto Bora as starter. Hence, shifted towards Mughal cuisine and ordered Malai Mahi Tikka. This was served by 15minutes, along with the mocktail. Fish chunks marinated in cream and spices, charred with coal, was a delight. The mocktail was strictly okay. My homemade mango shakes are far tastier, as per my husband!

In the main course, we went to keep it proper Bengali. Hence ordered Posto Bora with Plain Rice, Daab Chingri, Dhakai Ilish and Kachalonka Bhapa Ilish. They arrived by 15minutes or so. 

The rice grains were of real good quality basmati. We aptly utilized the bowl of ‚ÄòGhee‚Äô they served as an accompaniment.

The Posto Bora , tasted on a sweeter side, suited my palate but did not overwhelm it. 

The surprise of the day was Kachalonka Bhapa Ilish. A giant Hilsha pice, cooked in Coriander-Green Chilli paste and mustard oil tasted awesome. It did not take away the typical hilsha flavor, as well as created a different yet tasty gravy on its own. 

At the same time, the Dhakai Ilish straightaway disappointed me. I could taste Poppy seeds, mustard, melon seeds in the gravy whch actually stole away the pungent smell of mustard and henceforth killed the dish. The hilsha was of good quality though. 

The star item of the day was Daab Chingri. Jumbo prawns in super-smooth creamy gravy.. The prawns were fresh and crunchy yet soft.. I could taste coconut, cream and butter in the gravy.. it was silky! Undoubtedly the best Daab chingri I have tasted! 

We were quite full by this time but could not miss out on the desserts part! We went for Mango Kulfi and Nolengur Icecream.. The icecream was nice.. smooth and creamy with strong flavors of nolengur.. nothing extraordinary though! What raised the bar was the Mango Kulfi. Served in slices of Mango skin, it consisted of good quality mango, cashew, pista, khoya and tasted royal! 

The service was prompt when coming to food.. but not otherwise. Somehow the air-conditioning system was not working properly and we requested them a number of times to adjust the cooling, but they didn‚Äôt, or to be specific, they couldn‚Äôt and we sweated till the end. Attention needed!

Our pocket pinch was around 4k, which is on a heavier side I feel. Worth the food they are serving, but not the service they are giving.

Charnock's is basically a restaurant cum bar and also a banquet hall which is housed inside Charnock City in Salt Lake, located close to AMRI Hospital. The cuisine they serve is mostly Bengali and some North Indian preparations. Recently happened to be there for an anniversary party. Though I did not use their main restaurant and only the banquet hall, but I can certainly be sure that the food was the same as their restaurant.

Starters had Chicken Malai Kebab and Crispy Babycorn, both were quite nice and appetizing. We were also served Aam Panna which could have been better. For the main dinner, we had a taste of Pulao, Chicken Curry, Fish Fry, Dal, Aloo Dum, Kadhai Paneer and some Naan alongside. Now I can't remember the exact name of the chicken curry but it was overall below par. The chicken pieces were full of bones and the chicken was not to soft but not very hard either. Kadhai Paneer was tasteless, never expected this kind of taste. Fish Fry was tiny, but tasted as it should. Aloo Dum and Dal were good enough to be enjoyed. We also had a mixed vegetable dish which was pretty good. Pulao was descent and one of the better items. Naans were soft and big enough. For desserts, we had Vanilla Ice Cream with Chocolate Sauce and Gulab Jamun.

Ambience was quite nice, the view from 7th floor was awesome. Decor was average and lighting was not too dim (even for the restaurant). Parking was not a problem for the place.

We never mind to bear the overpriced items here when we know its fully worthy unless we had a horrible experience at charnock's. We visited this place again and again to enjoy the finger licking mango kulfi, white lady the best fish sizzler I ever had. But last time we got all our ordered dishes with three COCKROACHES in free. Along with one living crawling over the table!! Never ever expected this can happen in such a reputed restaurant like charnock's. Not sure how many we had already consumed with the food items. All the love we had for this place just got disappeared after the incidents.

I went to his restaurant last month...I ready had a wonderful experience having lunch with my office collegues.

First of all the ambience and decor was awesome.Having the restsurant at the sixth floor of the building,we can see a spectacular view from the large glass walls of the restaurant.

Coming to good,I can say that though the rates of the dishes are bit pricey,the taste were delicious. Even the service was good and the staffs were attentive.

Finally I can say that this restaurant must be there in your wishlist.

One of my favourite joints for a peaceful late lunch especially. I love the tandoori pomfret here. And I keep going back for the lamb shanks. The staff is very well- mannered, to the extent of coming up and showing us the fish pieces (especially hilsa) that they have selected for our order. Now, how sweet is that!

Have been quite a regular here (much to the consternation of the missus who likes to keep trying new places), but this, along with the nearby Abcos restaurant, keep on drawing me to this part of Salt Lake.

The decor is nice and soothing. But the AC is REALLY chilly, and I prefer to carry a light sweatshirt or jacket, and eat the heart- warming food in warm comfort.

While I prefer the continental selection, the Bengali food is also rally good, right up there in the ranks of 6 Ballygunge Place.

First things first,  the view from the 9th floor is amazing.. the set up is traditional and sophisticating, the ambience on BENGALI NEW YEARS DAY was gave us a feel of 'bangali bonediyana'.. there was live rabidrasangeet which was the best part of that afternoon..the singer simply mesmerized us!! 
Opted for non veg thali.. since there was no ala carte that day.. everything was well arranged.. from aam pora shorbot.. radhaballavi cholar daal.. to ghee bhat.. sukto.. assorted bhajas.. topshe fry.. echor chingrir dalna..chingri bhapa.. kosha mangsho.. gandharaj murgi.. lal pabda.. and endless helpings of each of them.. and ending on a sweet note with raajbhog and the Best Nolen Gurer Icecream. 
Everything was well cooked except the topshe and fish fry.. which were cold. 
But The service was not flawless.. as expected.. they took a lot of time to serve the portions one after the other.. otherwise the meal was pretty decent.

Firstly, the view is amazing. If you reserve a corner table, you can enjoy a fabulous meal while looking out onto the city of joy. They had introduced fusion food a few years back, but the place is still best for indian cuisine. Their signature dish Raan e Charnock is simply out of this world. One of the places in calcutta which has really maintained its charm and quality of service.

First things first,  the view from the 9th floor is amazing.. the set up is traditional and sophisticating, the ambience on BENGALI NEW YEARS DAY was gave us a feel of 'bangali bonediyana'.. there was live rabidrasangeet which was the best part of that afternoon..the singer simply mesmerized us!! 
Opted for non veg thali.. since there was no ala carte that day.. everything was well arranged.. from aam pora shorbot.. radhaballavi cholar daal.. to ghee bhat.. sukto.. assorted bhajas.. topshe fry.. echor chingrir dalna..chingri bhapa.. kosha mangsho.. gandharaj murgi.. lal pabda.. and endless helpings of each of them.. and ending on a sweet note with raajbhog and the Best Nolen Gurer Icecream. 
Everything was well cooked except the topshe and fish fry.. which were cold. 
But The service was not flawless.. as expected.. they took a lot of time to serve the portions one after the other.. otherwise the meal was pretty decent.

Firstly, the view is amazing. If you reserve a corner table, you can enjoy a fabulous meal while looking out onto the city of joy. They had introduced fusion food a few years back, but the place is still best for indian cuisine. Their signature dish Raan e Charnock is simply out of this world. One of the places in calcutta which has really maintained its charm and quality of service.

Lost in the glam of malls, food court and many other happening places, legendary places like Charnock's still holds a very special place to me and many others for sure. Starting from the beautiful ambiance to their food and the services rendered, it's the definition of a perfect diner.

There's not just one dish or one thing I would point out yo be great about this place cause it's the experience I cherish most about any place include Charnock's.

You get the royal feel, beautiful views, courteous staff and amazing dishes all at one place and that's a blend most won't find together at once.

Don't mind paying the bill cause it's all worth everything you get.

There are some persons who when met leaves a mark in your mind that you can never erase. The memories come back again and again. Same concept applies for restaurants.
I never knew about this place until I visited for the first time with my colleagues on a Maha Shashthee noon. Second time also, I visited with the same group.
The moment I entered, I felt very homely.  Very well decorated space with matching designs of furniture and lots of mind blowing paintings which go absolutely with the aristocrat mood and appeal of the decoration. Being on a high floor, the windows give a nice view of saltlake and stadium.
Both the times we ordered lots of items combining all the available cuisines mixed up. I opted for mostly Bengali dishes I remember. Somehow, the ambiance whispered in my ears to go for Bengali dishes. I found every dish tasty and of fine quality. Price was a bit on the higher side but the quality and quantity somehow justified it. Service was extremely courteous and helpful.
Coming to the main part of this review. What made me remember my experience? The answer is "Murgh Par Luft". I would not try to describe the pleasure I got while tasting this delicacy. In one simple word, it was just 'magical'. If you are reading the review and willing to know what is it, you can just go to the menu and check the description. This dish, literally fainted out all other dishes I ate there. No need to mention, I was extremely satisfied each time I visited.
Last year, in a rainy evening, I felt a desire to taste that dish again. I went there. It was around 6 PM. No guests was there. I just wanted to order one plate of Murgh Par Luft. But they informed me about the unavailability of the same due to the charcoal oven issue as a result of heavy raining. I left broken heart. But would definitely like to visit again whenever I get suitable time and opportunity.

BAD. That is the only word with which I can end the review.
I went back to the restaurant with my office colleagues almost after 3 years only to feel like I am visiting some ruins. Depressing ambiance, shabby interiors, low light. It wasn't like this before.

The starters and the attendants are only things I can cheer for. We took chicken platter and kebabs which was Good. The people were cordial too.
The food was awful. We ordered "loochi-mangsho (mutton kassa)" for main course dinner along with dal makhni.
The loochi absolutely did not have that oomph factor. The roadside loochis are far fluffier and tastier. The mutton kassa was just eatable. The dal makhani was a total waste and it tasted stale. We did not touch it.

I would think before going back here again. We regret the choice we made of Charnock's over Oh Calcutta. The bill amount in the end was almost identical.

Walking by saltlake suddenly thought of seeing it from the top floor of charnock city building. The top Floor is there restaurant so we went there. The lift opened in to a mughal darbar like area. Loved it instantly. The decor really impressed me and my friend. We chose a table near the window having the view of the city and since it was evening just ordered snacks and coffee. The chicken was crisp and the sauce was spicy n sweet. The coffee was great! They served in tea pot and we could easily manage 1 n 1/2 servings each from that one pot. The waiters had impeccable service. We enjoyed talking and lazing there for an hour or so. They never bothered us with irrelevant questions. They just let us be. We were more than happy to visit the place and would soon try out their lunch n dinner items, they sounded nice to us.

The festive season for the year came to an end and to mark the occasion special and revisit the memoir of the eventful one month the venue was selected as Charnock's. The restaurant located opposite Salt Lake stadium Gate No. 4, is a legend itself started 14 years back and was very popular those days. Recently it lost its charm or hype a bit but veteran gastronomists claim that Charnock's have managed to maintain the same food taste throughout the year.

By taking elevator to 9th floor of the Charnock City welcomes you to a world where few signature dishes were born. Old yet maintained interior will remind you Jamindar house or Raj Bari which we often see now-a-days in various themed Durga Pujo. One will find MF Hussain's painting too hanging on the wall.

In starters we ordered Malai Maahi Tikka and Murgh Par Luft. Malai Maahi Tikka is 4 pieces of huge chunks of bhetki marinated in butter and cheese with spices and cooked inside tandoor. Murgh Par Luft has 6 pieces of boneless chicken covered with cheese and cooked inside tandoor.

In main course we narrowed down to Malai Murgh, Daab Chingri and Lobster Thermidor. Malai Murgh is a mild cashew nut gravy yet full of taste. Goes well with naan or tandoori roti. Heard a lot about their Daab Chingri, been told that this culinary wonder was originally born in the kitchen of Charnock‚Äôs. Though today many restaurants serve Daab Chingri but nothing can beat the taste over here. Must be relished with steam rice only. And finally the one of most popular dishes of the restaurant Lobster Thermidor, have no words to explain this. Lobster meat scooped off the shell and cooked with mushroom and cream sauce post seasoning with white wine. This is a complete dish itself where each proportion is served with butter rice.

Such an extravagant menu will be unjustified if its not complete with a Nalen Gurer Ice Cream. Will recommend each and every items here and each of them will be an experience for all.

Price is very steep here at par with a 4 star restaurant if that can be spoil sport. Final bill came INR 4324 (with taxes).

When it comes to Charnock's City, my opinion is 110% biased.
I have been visiting Charnock's since 2001, and have dined at there for over 200 times.
The brilliant ambience of Charnock's, the interior with MF Hussain's paintings, coupled with a superb food makes it so special.
I must recommend Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Mutton Shami Kebab for the appetizers, their very own "Avant Garde" Gosht Handi Biryani  for the main course.
Also, the Naan and Malai Murgh is irresistible.

This is a place where I am coming since my childhood for family lunch and dinner. It offers a spectacular view and has a calm and quiet ambience. I have tried both the Bengali and the North Indian food. The staff is really helpful while recommending items from the menu.¬†Recently, we went there for a small family reunion.¬†For the starters, Malai Mahi Tikka and Chicken kebab wrapped in cheese (I forgot the name) were great and very succulent. We loved every bite. For the main course, we wanted to try Ilish and we were pretty skeptic about trying the Ilish Biriyani suggested by the staff. I have never liked the concept of Ilish Biriyani but they proved me wrong totally. The boneless Ilish Biriyani with fried Ilish and fried onion rings as side dish was the show stealer. Undoubtedly, this was the best Ilish Biriyani I ever had. Finally, we wrapped up with Nolen Gur Ice cream which was pretty awesome as well. It did satisfy my taste buds. This is a place worth visiting for great ambience and equally good food.

Years back i visited this place with my family for dinner to celebrate the wedding anniv of my parents.We were more than 10 in number and It was a blast ¬†. I still have fond memories of this place. Probably thats the only reason why i am here reviewing it. The ambiance is just wow with a beautiful view from the glass panes esp of the stadium. The service was prompt and staffs were helpful and courteous.¬†

My dad had ordered basically and i think his knowledge and selections were top notch. From champagne to dessert everything was perfect. I remember only few of the dishes so i will speak of those that has left a mark in my mind. Coming directly to the food- the tandoori murg was well grilled and nice, the prawn malai curry and my very first encounter with daab chingri was just wow. The prawns were nice , succulent and the blend of flavours were just perfectly balanced. I specially recommend the daab chingri i think its till date the best. There was this mutton dish i dont remember the name but that too was really well done. The mutton just melted and had a very different taste. ¬†From the dessert most opted for the kulfi and fruit salad. It was nothing special as the taste was the usual.

This place provides very authentic north and bong food but it is definitely an expensive venture. But i am sure food lovers will love the food here.

Over all an awesome day it was. Will be visiting soon.

A 5 star for the ambience.on the top floor of the building just beside AMRI and opposite salt lake stadium. Excellent decor, you can view the saltlake city and parts of kolkata from the 13th floor . The restaurant is covered with glass panes.As far as food goes, you have ample options, from Indian to Bengali ,Mughlai to continental. "Mutton ran" and "mutton pepper dry"is a must try.Bar is also well stocked.The stewards are also very cooperative and know what they are speaking.Between 4 PM to 7 PM you get only drinks and snacks.Excellent place to chill out and take a view of the city from the top and stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city.In the recent past they have added new items in the menu with an increase in the price too.They also run time to time food festivals.All over a place of must visit.

I was at Charnock's a few weeks ago with my colleagues. The decor was fabulous and the view of the city from the floor even better! I don't exactly remember all the items we ordered but the one that I clearly remember, and which I would recommend to everyone, is steamed rice and daab chingri. It tasted haven. It would be nice if they could add more gravy by default in the daab chingri becasue that's required with steamed rice. They did bring it on request but the wait was long. I will very definitely bring my family here for the food and the ambience. The items are a bit overpriced but I believe if food is good and served hot and prompt nothing beats that!

I visited this place back in 96 when we had ordered Mutton keema and pulao. I also specifically remember my cousin ordering Sphagetti Bologna which smelled very well. Service was a bit time consuming but again this is a much older version and lots may have happened in ten years. I enjoyed the ambience though especially since it is located at the to of the tower.

Charnock's is located near AMRI Hospital in Salt Lake opposite the Stadel at the top floor. With a good seating capacity and big glass panes, it provides an amazzing view of salt lake city especially the stadium. The seats are pretty comfortable and my ideal time to visit this place would be a sunday afternoon. Giving the type of location and view from that 8th floor, i feel the decor could have been better. Plus the music is not so well controlled with various genres playing back to back at fluctuating volumes. The staff service is pretty slow in my opinion though dont see other reviewers complaining about it.

The place serves north indian, continental, bengali cuisines but i love their north indian food a lot. The prices are a bit on higher side going by the food quality but being an admirer of their view, i dont generally complain about it. The kebabs are really nice especially the seekh kebab which is my favorite. I once had a sizzler here long time back which was really good though dont remember the name. The garlic bread is very nice too. For main course, dal makhani, paneer makahni, koftas are very good. Biryani is very nice with a big generous serving. For deserts, i love their nolen gur ice cream.

Pros: 
1. Lovely location and view
2. Polite and courteous staff
3. Amazing variety of food on offer
4. Great food 

Cons
1. Prices could have been a bit lower
2. Music needs to improve
3. Service is slow

5/5 for the amazing view overlooking Saltlake. If you hapen to be there during a rainy day, I can bet that you will not come out of this place.
when it comes to food, they serve excellent bengali food. I had the best Chitol fish item here. The special lobster starter still brings water to my mouth.
A place where you must go.

First off, this place scores a 5/5 for the view. Its so cool to get up to the top floor and enter the restaurant, and if possible get the window seat. This time around, our group of four decided to get one of them, and with our choice of poison, decided to order some starters. The servers suggested a lovely mixed grill, because we were a group and while I wanted meat, my friend wanted prawn, and we did not like each other's selection. With that we also ordered a fish malai tikka since it is a table favorite. 

For the main course I was looking for an old favorite, stuffed chicken breasts with a yellow creamy sauce served with rice. I actually brought out the picture from my camera archive and showed it to the server when I failed to explain to him what I wanted, and he told me that the dish was no longer served, but he could try and ask the chef to make it (I am actually attaching my year-old picture here because I still cannot forget that dish... sigh). However, I declined politely and went for the roast chicken, while my friends went on the other end of the spectrum and ordered Kashmiri Pulao, Dum Aloo and  a chicken dish  which I frankly don't remember the name of. We were sort of bursting at the end of it, and my roast chicken was quite tasty, albeit with a tad too much more salt than I would prefer. 

I would like to say that this place actually serves a pretty decent daab chingri, one of the better ones I have eaten, as well as the Lobster Thermidor, which is nice. 

I can never leave this place without dessert. I chose what I order virtually every time I come here - vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce. The chocolate sauce was slightly disappointing. It tasted of cocoa and had a slightly chalky texture. However, otherwise our meal was great.

Job Charnock is a big name which undeniably holds a very important (and debatable) position in this city's history as the founder of our metropolitan hometown.
Likewise, the restaurant Charnock's stands tall and famous as one of the oldest landmark eateries in Salt Lake's sector 3. It also proved to be the perfect place for the quintessential and most awaited Pujo dinner with my kin on Shashthi night. 
 
After visiting the most talked about FD Block's Sarbojonin Durga Puja (which did capture all the attention with its theme of women power and destruction of evil on both Heaven and Earth) we reached Charnock's at 20 minutes to 11. 
The spacious dining room on the ninth floor of the building was almost full except for one long table just right for our group of nine people. Being a rooftop restaurant, the view that surrounds it, is total eye candy. Gaze out of those colossal glass windows and it will offer you a breath-taking panorama of the vast Salt Lake Stadium (or as we Bengalis proudly call it Yuva Bharati Krirangan) and the city lit up in festive lights. Looking inside, the decor lived up to the cheerful mood of the guests and the soft Rabindra Sangeet instrumentals completed the soothing ambience.
 
Next comes the most important part; food. Our orders for the tandoori appetizers consisted of the Malai Maahi Tikka and Murgh Malai Kebab. The plate of Maahi Tikka had big chunks of fish marinated in Indian herbs, spices and cream cheese which gave the fish fillet a perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture. The creamy consistency of the sauce and the overwhelming flavours made this my favourite dish for the night. The Chicken Malai Kebab was equally gorgeous in texture, delightful in taste and the best cheese-y kebab I've ever had.
For the main course we ordered Mutter Pulao (for the "bheto" Bengalis in us), Plain Naan (for the more health conscious ones), Rara Gosht and Hari Mirchi Mutton (boneless). The saffron flavoured pulao was light, tasty and was a perfect match with the rich Rara Gosht. The pieces of mutton in both the dishes were distinctly flavoursome, succulent and tender. Now, even though I swear by rice, the mutton dish with green chillies paired much better with the soft and chewy naan.

Time came for us to commit one of the seven deadly sins; GLUTTONY, when the bowls of dessert reached our table. The demands were different, so some grabbed a bowl of Tutti-Frutti, some went for Chocolate ice cream and the ones with impeccable taste (like mine ;) ) reached out for a bowl of Nolen Gurer (Date Palm Jaggery) Ice Cream! The two generous scoops of the nolen gur ice cream felt like Heaven in my mouth. Naturally made, the ice cream was filled with nolen gur flavoured malai and lavishly adorned with the thick molten jaggery syrup. The other ice creams were quite ravishing too, especially, the chocolate one, being a bit on the darker side.
 
The bill came to be something around 8000 rupees which was absolutely justified given the quality and quantity of the food.
Another highlight of the night came when I got to stare at the gifted theater personality and actress, Sohini Sengupta (a family favourite) for a whole minute while she was leaving Charnock's. My exquisite dining experience was nicely wrapped up with a cherry on top. :)
I would definitely recommend this place for a reunion with friends, dinner with family or just a quiet and classy date near the enormous French windows.
 
P.S: Couldn't help but write a LONG review for this one! :)

Charnock's - This is a nice restaurant to spend time with your friends. Visit in the daytime & make sure to grab a window seat so that you do not miss outside views. Nice food, great interiors, spacious cover, awesome outside view. We tried Lamb Sizzler's out there & it was delicious. Only if the bun would have been softer to sink my teeth in & not to crackle like cookies!! Anyways, the choice of paintings were interesting & the bar was beautiful. I checked on this restaurant's reviews on Zomato & almost none praised it's service quality. Well, unfortunately, It's true.... To start with, service captain just kept on pushing us to order for Hilsa preparations (Hilsa Festival was on) & didn't even given us the menu card... The chilled beers were not 'chilled'... Waiter spilled beer over brim while pouring... Constantly annoying for repeats between conversations.... etc etc etc. Though the food was good & any food lover should agree on this but one of the great turn off's was the price...!!! If Charnock's management can be bit bolder about pricing, it will soon cross many of the 4-5 starers in the city...!!! Also, the restaurant is very easy to miss while driving past it. They can spend some bucks on outside illumination it seems... Overall Verdict: Recommended to Visit

This place makes for a nice change from the regular city restaurants that I usually visit. Ideally its great to drive down on a Sunday afternoon and enjoy a lazy lunch with a great view in relative peace and quiet. Try to bag a window table as that actually enhances the ambiance. My usual dish there is the Lobster Thermidor .... which is well made and served with buttered rice.... very light and delicate flavors. The Bengali food is also quite good .... I have sampled the Chingri Malai Curry which was well prepared as well as the Mutton Kosha which was average. Its a nice place for a date or a cozy lunch to catch up with friends.

One of the best bengali menu they do serve near salt lake area as wel as few undoubtedly good continental (Lobster thermidor, Hungarian Goloush etc. for example). Indian is also good here, specially the prawn tandoori, awesome. After all the experiments with Oh Calcutta, Kewpies, 6 Ballygunge place, Bhajohori Manna etc, I stopped here and always take my friends from other countries or other provinces to this restaurant for a Bengali dinner. Maybe not very authentic, little more spicy in some cases (mochar ghanto, patoler dorma etc), loittle overdone in some cases (Bhetki paturi), Excellent is some cases (Dab Chingri, Nalen gur ice cream), and okay but overpriced in many cases (Postor bora, Hilsa), but, overall, taste, ambience, view (best view in salt lake, Afraa maybe number 2), staff courtesy and decor, this is a best place for a fine dining of bengali food. My own special  recommendation.

Pro: Tasty food not restricted to any genre. So Bengali "daab Chingri" was proper, along with the continental Cream of Chicken soup and PunGabi Chicken gravy dish.
Cons : Price vs Quantity: Very moderate servings including that of rice and Roti. Daab Chingri @INR700 had only 4 pieces of medium sized prawns. All veg and non-veg dishes comprised of 4 pieces. A meal for 3 sans alcohol cost INR2700 with all three being moderate eaters.
Service was sloppy. The naan was served with daab Chingri, when rice was specifically ordered with the prawn dish. Our mineral water was topped up with regular water even without asking.
The view and ambience was good, however the place can do with a little more lighting on the outside to make sure people notice it.

Best thing about this restaurant is it's ambiance. Located just opposite the stadium with a view of Kolkata and greenary all around. You can reach the restaurant in a glass walled lift which although has some space crunch, does give you great view.

The food is good. I have visited this restaurant multiple times, sometimes with my family and also in large group. Their dish Murg Pa Lutf is one which definitely needs to be tried. Also, fish items are good. Generally we go for Luchi and Mutton curry.

The service is average and found it not upto the mark when we went there with a considerable group. It took a long time for the food to come to the table. The cost is a bit on the higher side.

Overall, if you want to have lunch sitting at a place with great scenary and views, this is the place of choice.

Charnock i have visited at least twice once for an official meeting with my doctor friends from apollo. I must say the ambience at charnock is awesome. The view of the whole of kolkata from the restaurant is amazing and i found the place romantic. The place was well lighted up with blue light. The bar at one side of the restaurant that was well done created a good ambience. Well we ordered mostly snack item and washed it down with some cinzano wine. The prawn items that i had was crisp and taste. 

I actually like the dab chingri in this restaurant which i had one before well that i consider is the usp of this restaurant. The service was prompt and quick too. Definitely would like to visit. The only problem is the distance from the main city is too far and lot of people do not know about this place. What is feel this restaurant needs is some more publicity. Definitely the rates are too high although for me it could be affordable but for the middle class this place will not suite their pockets it more for the up market.

You can indeed have a clear view of the 'Charnock's City' from this restaurant. And that is exactly where it wins most of its customers. The view from the Charnock's City restaurant is simply great! The ambiance is artistic and aesthetic. I personally like their choice of paintings and also the music that they generally play whenever I have visited the place. Charnock's City sets the mood. Service tends to be good to mediocre, depending on the kind of pressure that the staffs face at a particular day of business. And when it comes to food, I have had two kinds of experiences; the good and the bad. Let's start with the negatives. I happened to consume an under-cooked piece of fish fry. That kind of an experience can turn any foodie off! Sometimes, the drinks that they serve aren't adequately 'prepared'. The chilled beers are not 'chilled' literally. That's another turn-off to be noted. But, there is always a good side to every unpleasantness. I should say that their continental main courses are not bad, their shorbas are good, their 'jhinga' (shrimps) preparations are delectable, and most of their Indian dishes are quite appealing and scrumptious. Yet, the menu is pricey. Nevertheless, you would like to come here again and again.... Just for the view from the top and a dollop of food's goodness!

Service is good,and the food is great.The ambience is wonderful as well.This place has an aura of dignified grandeur..An absolute no nonsence approach by the staff towards their job.Something that is only seen in five star hotels. The food is good.Specially their indian section. Once,when i had ordered a traditional hilsa preparation,they actually brought over the pieces before cooking,asking whether i approved of the portion sizes!!! Food here is a muted treat. And an unique feature of this place is the unique panoramic view of salt lake that yoe get from their glass panelled walls.Truly a "room witha view". Prices are a bit on the higher side,but given the quality of service,its well worth the bill. So next time you fancy an enjoyable night out wth your family,why not come to Charnock's? With their high rise view,You might just feel a bit closer to the stars.

When you are entering Salt lake from the Beleghata connector, you will notice this tall building on the right of side of the petrol pump. You can then avail the lift to go to the restaurant located on the 8th floor of the building. I have visited Charnock's several times and I always appreciate it for its quality food and ambience. If you can manage a table near the glass windows, you can have a good view of Saltlake and Saltlake stadium!!! The wooden ambience gives you a royal feeling. The chairs and tables are well arranged making you comfortable. Most of the time I have tried North Indian but the Bengali cuisine deserves an applause as well. The menu has a variety of soft and succulent kebab's to offer. I especially enjoy the range of breads that they have. one of my top favourite is the rogani naan!!! There mutton raan needs a special mention too!!! Overall, I would say its a great place for good food and a nice view.

Pocket pinch- 1200 (for two without alcohol)
Suitable for family gatherings and children.
Parking facilities available

This place is just opposite to SAI ( sports authority of India). The restaurant is located on the topmost floor of charnock city with an awesome view of salt lake. The quality of food is good. They also serve Bengali dishes like Loochi, Begun Bhaja, Posto Bora etc. 
My personal favourite is the Baked Chicken with Saffron Rice which is mainly a chicken preparation wrapped inside pasta, baked with cheese and served with Saffron Rice. I would recommend everybody to stay away from cocktails and mocktails. Tried Blue Lagoon once but it turned out to be green instead, with a milk base. 
I was amazed by the way the staff argued to prove it to be a blue lagoon! 
Even the Bloody Mary was watery and contained too much Tabasco sauce. 
Apart from these little things, this place is good and recommendable.

ambiance : 4/5
food: 4/5
staff: 2.5/5
price: 4/5
