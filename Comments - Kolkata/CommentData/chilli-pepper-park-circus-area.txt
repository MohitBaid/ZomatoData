My meal was OK but it took ages to be seated, my wife ordered two courses but they were both sub standard, OK if you want a drink there at the bar after seeing a movie at the near by movie theater

As a frequently visit this area I had noticed this shop multiple times. Due to the shabby exterior I stayed away from it. But after reading reviews in Zomato I planned to try once.

It was an utter disappointment! I had ordered for Boneless Chilly Chicken and Egg Hakka Noodles. The preparation was disastrous. Excessive soya sauce was added to both the dishes. It was not even edible.

The shop being only five minutes away from my home has always been very significantly special to me. The rustic flavours like that of a road-side Chinese food stall, in a very affordable price, allows me to enjoy their food whenever I want to. My personal favorite would be their Chilly Chicken and Chicken Steamed Momo.

This little place is a stone’s throw from my house and we often call for delivery (which comes pretty quick). Chilli Pepper is really affordable. You can order like kings and still not cross Rs. 300 on a meal for two.

My favourite dish here is their gravy chowmein. I generally order a side of dry chilli chicken to go with it—this is tasty but a little heavy on the soy (usually) and also on the batter. If you are looking for a gravy-based side, they make a nice shredded chicken with mushroom and baby corn. Their fried and steamed momos are quite good as well. I love their hot and sour soup too, though it can be too high on the chilli for many people.

Note: This is not a fancy place, but if you stick to the basics, they serve up decent food without leaving you feeling broke.

Really good Chinese food at an extremely pocket friendly prices. Foods tastes authentic (almost).
Like the Hakka noodles, its authentic taste can afford to challenge any of the restaurants in Kolkata in its class.

Had requested them to deliver at CIT road to which they refused so had to go to pick the parcel. Anyways place was not much difficult to find its in the lane opp to Quest mall and  first right from there. Sitting area is not much impressive even cleanliness of the utilities is not pleasing to watch. Staff was friendly and assisted me while placing the order. Coming to the order it was
Veg Chowmein: Was good 
Szechuan Chow Mein: Was better than the above
Veg Fried Rice: Was quite nice the quality of the rice was good
Crispy Chilli Babycorn: Best of the lot
Hot garlic chicken: Impressive
Stir fried veg: Nice

Total bill amounted to 365 which is quite cheap and totally worth it. As the food is exceptionally good and tasty. Only suggestion they should maintain a bit more cleanliness and a better decor at the dining area.

Chilli Pepper is a purely Chinese restaurant located at 104/1 Ustad Khan Avenue, Kolkata just a stone throw away from Park Circus Market. It is a very small restaurant which initially started as a road side Chinese counter. Gradually, it expanded and along with the take away counter (which is its original outlet), it opened an AC restaurant just on one side of the take away counter. 
This is not a restaurant that can be compared with other top grade or medium grade restaurants, but still this new restaurant has gained huge popularity in the Park Circus area where there are already a large number of big names in the world of Mughlai and Chinese restaurants like Zeeshan, Arsalaan, Chinese Bowl and more. I think the main reason behind such popularity is the availability of quality food within nominal prices along with the friendly behavior of the staff. 
I am sure you will be surprised to see the rate chart when you glance at it for the first time because the same thing happened to me. I remember the first day when I went there to place an order for take away. I could not believe my eyes when I saw the rate chart, and while going through the chart, I won't lie, the first thought that came to mind was - how will be the quality of food be at such low rates?!? So, as an experiment, I placed an order for Mixed Noodles and Chilli Chicken for four in my family. But after tasting both the preparations, I have returned to this place so many times for more. The last time was probably a fortnight ago, when I had Ginger Capsicum Rice and Threaded Chicken and both were delectable. They always provide freshly prepared dishes, and you will also understand this, because if you make a late visit here (like after 9.30 PM or 10.00 PM) on weekdays, you will often end up hearing that many choices are unavailable as the stock of raw ingredients (like fish, chicken or prawn) has finished and you have to place your order from the limited choices that are left. 
Besides dinner, often, I visit here (almost every week) to have a plate of Steamed Momo's which are so scrumptious that you won't feel like paying more for the same lip smacking taste at other renowned Momo centers. It is very close to my home so whenever I feel the urge to taste the flavors of Chilli Pepper I walk down. I have almost become a regular diner at this restaurant. 
Decor is simple. The small restaurant is painted in bright romantic colors and decorated with soft illumination. All the tables are set very neatly and one can enjoy every service here that a big restaurant usually provides. The take away counter is always over crowded but the restaurant remains comparatively less populated except during special occasions, festivals and weekends. Chilli Pepper also provides home delivery in time and I have tried this service also and I don't have any complaints about this service as well.
