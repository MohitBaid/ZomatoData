Small doesn't necessarily points to unpleasant experience... There are exceptions like this joint. Liked texture and taste. Loved warm gestures of staff... they are obliged to offer service despite established long ago.

Located next to Jugal's, this place opposite Priya cinema has been there ever since I can recall. With seating for hardly 3-4 people, the space here is a bit less no doubt but it is more than compensated by the quality of the food and the homely atmosphere. The place is quite clean as well.

A very old food joint just next to jugals sweet shop. Love their snacks and chilli chicken.  Good food at a reasonable price. Knowing this place since childhood always had a takeaway from this place

Okay the hygeine of this food joint is very low. Practocally no place to sit. I mostly, took the rolls and meat chops from this shop during my tution recess. I would say the quality of the stuff was okay. You can drop in if you are very hungry and have no other options.

For me this place is not an ordinary place where they serve some brilliant rolls at a very reasonable price. I have been here on couple of occasions and didn't notice the name though but suddenly some day noticed the name and from then I have recommended a lot of people about this place for quick bites as their kabiraji and fries are quite alluring.

Located near triangular park this place is not really easy to find of you don't know about it. Service is quiet fast and serves you happiness and delight with their food.

This is a small shabby eatery located a few yards away,on the opposite footpath of Priya Cinema, near Jugals, can accommodate hardly 4-5 people but you can find people from all walks of life here. Located this place using the location map in Zomato. Menu Card is Attached in my reviews.

Very well behaved staff and fast service.
Low on budget for lunch and the Zomato nearby search had this in its list , while my way back from tuition in Desapriya park
This is more of a Bengali cum Indian cuisine food shop.
The Chinese dishes like Chilli Chicken, F. Rice, Chowmein has that bengali tinge with Indian Spices, which gives it a different, but wonderful taste to the delicacies. The place is average in hygiene, the rest is up to you how you judge.
Orders:
2 Veg Fried Rice (Rs 40 Each)
4pcs of Chilli Chicken (Rs 12x4)

Veg Fried Rice(6.5/10)
It was just average as it had a faint taste. They are more into Bengali food so, just vegetables, oil and a bit of spices(needed more for better taste) but cooked well together. Low on salt and quantity is sufficient at this price.

Chilli Chicken(8/10)
WoW. It has that very 'BENGALI GHAR KA KHAANA' essence. From the taste to the covering of the pieces, it was cooked in the Indian way, the gravy was less thick as you find in Chinese outlets and accurately cooked in spices and not so rich either. It was palatable. It tasted Bengali which I loved. It was Bangalir Ghorer Chilli Chicken, thus, the name of the restaurant is appropriate and stands up to its name for sure.

DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT BUDGETS, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES AND THUS, READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR BETTER CONCLUSION BEFORE INVESTING FOR THE LOVE OF FOOD. KEEP GOBBLING.

Its a small eating joint. They have only one table and can seat 5 people roughly. There is sitting arrangement upstairs but its mostly closed. The place is run by an old couple. The food quality is good. We had egg roll, egg chop and fish fry. The old man running the restaurant is very convincing and soft spoken. The roll was large and tasty and very filling with loads of onioins. The fish fry was also very tasty with solid fish fillet. The egg chop was quite moderate.
Its a very good and affordable place to have quick munch. A must visit for all.

Mayer Cabin is one of the lesser known food joint that is in existence for decades. It's basically a shabby old eatery located near Priya Cinema on Rashbehari Avenue. The place deals in typical old days street food such as Fish Chop, Chicken Pakora, Rolls and stuff like that.

I have tasted their Chicken Lollipop which is tasteless, it has no salt added and tastes flavorless. Nevertheless, the lollipops are good in size and contains hefty amounts of chicken. Their Fish Fingers are good, brings the typical old taste of Kolkata's fish fingers and can be enjoyed with kasundi.

Location: Rashbehari Avenue.

This is a place which should be visited with a wish of flavorful food rather than hygiene.
It's a hole-in-the-wall located near Jugal's at Rashbehari Avenue.

For the non-vegetarians, it's a place to definitely try (as stated by my colleagues).
However, sadly there isn't much of an option for the vegetarians out here.
I tried out the Paneer roll which definitely made my taste buds happy.
The Paneer was soft and succulent. The paratha was thin and flaky, and overall the roll was crispy and tasty.

The staff here are friendly and definitely quick to process your order.
The prices wouldn't burn a hole in your wallet. 

A good experience. :)

Durga puja often gets me wandering on the streets... Exploring the bamboo structures that are soon to become pandals etc. 
The Bengals ode to loitering on the streets in kind of incomplete if one does not talk about all the tele bhaja (deep fried goodies). 

Most people from my generation are too busy singing songs about dilkhusha cabin and north kolkata . freds from south kolkata swear by this food joint. Their Chops and Cutlets are to die for. so i decided to pay a visit. They have mainly snacks . the also serce chicken curry / mutton curry/ and eggs ... Again i re-iterate that when you come to such place, please leave inhibitions behind. concentrate on flavor and freshness rather than hygiene and appearance . 

have had fish chops here before and my father swears by them .... 

What i ordered today 

1 fish chop ( brilliant as always ) 
1 egg chop 
1 mutton chop 
1 chicken cutlet 
1 egg chicken roll 

all of them were very good and the roll paratha was flaky and crisp. generous chicken .  well seasoned  and very juicy 

Pocket pinch rs 92... BRILLIANT ! 

also was quite enticed by the paratahs and the chicken curry ( next on the agenda )

Stuck in office today, and watching it pour outside, I am suddenly craving the good old Kolkata Fish Fry. And automatically I typed Mayer Cabin in Zomato without even realizing. 

Mayer Cabin is a hole in the wall in Deshapriya Park, near Jugal's. It makes one of the best Fish Fries in the city. It has a fat and fresh fillet of fish coated and fried to perfection. They also make a fabulous Mutton Chop. Tiny little balls with a thin coat and a filling of spicy boiled potatoes  and minced mutton.  

The staff is friendly like your local shop owners. They recognize regular customers and actually know about them and their lives. I have actually witnessed them having a conversation with my aunt ranging from how her day was, what her son is upto and her diabetes problems. 

There is not much of an ambiance as expected, but to me it has a charm. A charm of the local snack shops and roll corners which are fast disappearing and getting replaced with  new-age cafes. Places were tasty food surpasses every other aspect and serving good savoury food is the only focus like it should be.

I just cannot believe it...Mayer cabin is listed in zomato???? :O
Well it is a very small joint and have more or less always had food there or packed something for a small party with friends when I was in my school days.
Yes Mayer cabin has survived years and stands still majorly because of the friendliness of the owners and the fact that they said that "till I am alive I will try and run it since it is all we have".
So they try and take care of the fact that the food they serve is of good quality.
It has a lot of options for a small sized joint. The rolls are like it should be light and tasty and not the laccha paratha filled with oil ones and they used to take proper care when I used to ask for low oil stuff.
The chicken pakoras are a must try. The cutlets are fine, nothing great though.
It is of course locaed near Jugal's sweet shop in fact maybe one or two shops further which is very close to deshapriya park.
The chilli chicken is pretty good especially for a light snack though I have not gone for the regular combination of chowmein and chilli chicken.
I have never tried the kebabs here. As far as I remember they were not there when I used to be a frequent visitor also.
Another must try is fish finger or the fish fry.
They also serve Bengali meals though I have rarely seen anyone eating that. Of course that can be because I have rarely been there at proper lunch or dinner time.
It's a nice small cabin which you could maybe give a try if you are low on budget and want some good food.

Located just adjacent to Jugals sweets is this small roadside roll corner type shop , I wouldn't personally call a restaurant.  The offerings are typical to a roll corner- 
Egg / chicken/ tikia roll
chicken pakora 
fish finger
kabiraji etc .
Things I like here includes rapid fire service, not bad taste especially for fish fingers and kabiraji and low cost .
Cons-  small place with not so hygeneic atmosphere .

I was pretty surprised to see no one really reviewing this hidden gem of Deshapriya Park. It is one of the few places in Kolkata where my "roll-snob" friend actually like the chicken roll. And what's not to like about it? A light paratha wrapped around pieces of well-seasoned chicken, with sauces and other condiments added as per your choice... and the best part is - reasonable to a fault. Another hot favorite of mine here is definitely the fish fry... and they actually do give some fish rather than slivers of things that smell like fish, something most other fish fry places do. 

Ambiance is not much, but the service is fast, brisk and attentive, so definitely a good place to go when the odd craving for fry hits.
