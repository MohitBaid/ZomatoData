I Came Here For The 6th Time On 1st January 2018  To Celebrate New Year With My Friends Shiv Chetan And Tapan Bhai. At Their Offside Sports Cafe, Bhawanipur. And I Ordered 1 Veg Pan Fried Noodles For Rs. 130/- And KitKat Shake For Rs. 150/- They Were So Delucious. After That I Played With Their Lovely Dogs Chip Scrappy And Oreo. This Cafe Screams For More And More Music's With Entertainment And Enjoyment. In Bhawanipur There Are Two Places That I Visit The Most And They Are My Favourites As Well. 1 Offside Sports Cafe And 2 My Big Fat Belly. Happy New Year To Offside Sports Cafe And Their Entire Team As Well. #SWAGSEKARENGESABKASWAGAT #WOHBHINAYASAAL2018MEIN #TIGERZINDAHAI. Thank you Offside Sports Cafe For Making My Day Sensational.

I went to Offside Sports Cafe with friends. It's a very secluded and quiet cafe. I feel if you want to celebrate a birthday party in a place which isn't too crowded , without having to book the place , this should be your go to place . It's pretty pocket friendly . I have tried their crispy chilli baby corn which is served piping hot and is pretty good . Their chicken sandwiches are so so. Other than the food , this place plays music , has a screen for the videos , a rock climbing wall and a small kiddy football goalpost . I'm reducing the rating because I feel that this place can be made more engaging. Perhaps they can introduce a harness to make rock climbing actually feasible.

This is a sports themed cafe with a huge projector screen where they screen matches live. A very good place to visit if you want to hangout with your friends. Add to it, they serve very good food within a reasonable price. We had Pizza, Oreo Shake, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Hookah. Both Pizza and Baby Corn were excellent. The Oreo Shake was okay. The hookah wasn't bad either. 
The cafe is decorated with things related to different sports so I, as a sport lover, loved it. 
The staffs are very polite and owner himself came twice and asked us if the food was okay.

This themed cafe screams Sports and as a sports lover I did like the ambience.
Coming to the food;
♤Basa Crispers; these were very fresh. The crumb like texture on the top and juicy fish on the inside was impressive. But I think the coating needed a little more seasoning.
♤Drums of Heaven; these were hot and crispy. I would describe them as ideally cooked in the ideal sauce.
♤Oreo Shake; it had the distinct taste of oreo, was adequately creamy and we loved it. I think I would prefer the presentation of the shake to be a lil more beautiful though. Just saying. :)
Service was okayish.
But one complaint I have, as a non-hookah lover. They had a separate dining space before but now we have to sit in the musty smoke filled hookah room. That shall prevent me from frequenting the place further. Btw, I loved the two doggos. They were adorable.

I've been going their since day 1 and the place never failed to impress me. From the interiors to music, everything thing is really good. Their food has been the main attraction for me. And the best part is you get really good food (quality and quantity) and its not at all expensive. I've been recommending people to be there and experience the place and I'll keep doing that.

Couldnot try the food as we only had starters which was juat okay. Therefore 4 stars.

Smoking allowed. Hookah available
Board games available.

Choose Netaji Bhawan Metro or Drop down at Purna Bus stop to visit this place.
The ambience was good but the food and the service was just satisfactory. I had heard a lot about this place, but it didn't turned well for me.
I alongwith my friend, went there for lunch.
When we reached there, we saw two street dogs inside.. Jumping on the sofas and barking loudly. This was a disgusting thing to see! Nobody else was present there. Just the dogs and the waiter.
After seeing us, the waiter helped us to enter the place by locking the dogs inside.
Meanwhile we ordered Mix Sauce Penne Pasta, Farmhouse Pizza & Cold Oreo Shake.
They took around 20 mins to serve the pasta. Pasta was sweet but we managed to finish it.
Oreo shake was good.
But, the pizza was not good at all. It was half-cooked and the taste was worse.
Also, when we asked to change the plates, the owner was sweet enough to do this himself, when the waiters were busy.
They need to work a lot upon the maintenance and the pizza thing!

This cafe justifies its name as the task of finishing the place is a bit challenging the first time round. The food is reasonably priced and I simply love their pasta and chilli chicken. Their pizza bites and death by chocolate is insanely good too: decor is right up there and the sports items on display are really amazing. Must visit for those who are looking for a place with really good crowd and reasonably priced food. Big congratulations to them :)

This cafe is located near Purna Cinema Hall (Bhawanipore), the nearest metro station is Netaji Bhavan, its a 5 mins walk from there.

This cafe is a sports themed cafe, right from the entrance it will give u a sporty feeling. There are frames hanging near the stair case area with the famous qoutes of famous sportsmens. Coming to the restaurants area the walls are well decorated with different kinda sports gloves i.e boxing, cricket, football & golf along with famous quotes.
The other attraction is the world clock which shows u the time of different stadiums from famous places.


Now coming to the food & service:-
Well we ordered a sheesha Grape+Rasna it was good & the smoke was pretty well.
As far is food is concerned we tried Cheese corn rolls & Pizza bites in startes which was yummy, specialy Cheese Corn Rolls its was awesome with every bite i had i have felt a never before experience.
Later we ordered for Kebabi Pizza, Chicken Pan fried noodles, & Death by chocolate (Dessert), both Pizza & Noodles were well cooked. They serve a thin crust pizza which is my favorite, Noodles was also good, finally the dessert I had tried Death by chocolate in other places also but one cannot match the caliber of it the way they make it.
The service was good, staff were very friendly & co-operative, they were ready to resolve any issues if any, & always have smile on their face.
Overall it was a great experience, will surely come back & recommend others to visit this cafe & trust me u gonna fall in love wid this place.

This is a sports themed cafe which is located in Bhawanipur, near Purna Cinema Hall. The nearest metro station is Netaji Bhawan and it is a five minutes walk from Purna bus stop. This cafe was previously named TBB-The Blu Banana.

The place is very spacious and the walls are decorated with gloves, t-shirts and quotes related to various sports. You can also play different board games and darts here.

The food here is reasonably priced. One of my absolute favorite dish which I try almost every time I go there is the Death by Chocolate which is amazing. I have tried out different starters and also the KitKat Shake. Quite satisfied with the food, both quality and quantity wise. The sheesha is good too and there are a number of available flavours.

There is also a giant screen for the sports fanatics. Offside Sports Cafe also let out their place for parties.

Visited this place twice but haven't received good hospitality.
On my first visit, there were issues with the air conditioner and I wasn't very comfortable in my seating.
I had ordered cheese sticks, which were good.
Shisha , I had ordered teen paan rose, unfortunately that wasn't very good.
On my second visit, the place was shut since a meeting was going on.

They have a mini-rock climbing wall, which as you climb up leads you to a screen with a projector where you can watch sports. The ambiance is cool and calm, and a peaceful background music adds to its beauty. A perfect place to hangout with friends and family.  The restaurant staff were extremely polite and assisted us in all aspects.

There are very few themed cafes in calcutta offside sports cafe is one of them.This palce is located on the first floor and as one enters they will be welcomed by some of the legendary sports figures and there quotes written on the walls.The ambience is cozy enough. They have a typical dart board and also a goal post for those free kicks.The place is quite innovative and attractive at the same time.
Coming to food,the food was delicious and was served wonderfully.
The quality of hookah was average.
The only con of this place is the food and the  drinks are not served along with the hookah.
The staffs were well behaved and the service was good enough.
The place is pocket friendly.

It's a sports themed cafe but it didn't quite live up to my expectations..
It's reasonably priced and i guess this might be the only reason people visit this place.
AC wasn't working at all the day i visited around a month ago..The shisha choked , the cheese wasn't visible nor crossed paths with our taste buds in the so called Cheese Garlic Bread ... Though the mocktails were very nice ..
It's spacious and in a great locality, should improve and be a amazing place to chilllll.....

WORST PROFESSIONALISM EVER. 

I called up and made a reservation for a late night football match on certain conditions. But on the day of the match, they simply refused to accept the terms and conditions, and hiked the rates twice. And they gave a lame excuse of their concerned person not in station. 

Learn how to do business, man.

Went there today for the first time. Ambience is great. Food is also good but shakes? Nah. Heavily disappointed. Ordered oreo shake and kitkat shake both of them felt like 100% water. We complained and they did try to improve and serve but it still felt a lot like water. Also no food or drinks allowed where hookah is available and that is kind of a weird rule. Like who leaves hookah in between to go and have food? Total waste of hookah.. pizza and garlic bread was great... Wai wai was okayish. 
Quality of hookah was average. (Should provide for cold pipe) flavours were not so prominent and response of the staff at the start was not good, we had to complain 3-4 times to have someone listen and solve

A fine place to visit. Simple interior. Simple place. But fun to be in. You get all kinds of board games which you can enjoy to your extent. Hookah was also good and so was the food. Went there with a little coupon(PS: Info on little app is wrong, you better call them up and ask all the details). Cons: Pure Veg, you can't have hookah and food at the same place(different rooms for both). Very unfortunate! Though it's the rule provided by government. Strict with age limit(>21) so everybody had better carry their identity cards. When asked on call they didn't even mention the need for an identity card. So be a bit more careful about these small things. Because after traveling from laketown to bhawanipur if you get to hear "We are sorry we can't provide you hookah" just because on person in the group doesn't have an identity card is far more disappointing than you can think! Its good to be strict on rules but be more careful when you provide details on call and see to it that you provide every condition required! And Servicing could have been better. We asked for food after we are done with hookah but they I don't know why just got the food prepared on the table outside when we were only started with the hookah. Staffs were bit rude too when there wasn't even a need of it.

This cafe is located Near Bhawanipur PostOffside, It is difficult  to locate  unless you have Google Maps. We went there with a little app offer. The food was qualitatively good but quantitavely could have increased. They are offering hookah at normal rates.
The main disadvantage is that food and hookah aren't  allowed to take at the same place. You either take  hookah in the room or have food outside the hookah room. It is a theme based cafe which has various  types of game. We firstly took hookah and luxurious  played Ludo and Uno. Ofcourse, there are other games too. :) I found the staffs a bit rude. Then we went outside the room to have food. All over it was a good experience. 
I Recommend  to  Visit this place atleast once.

বড় পর্দায় বন্ধুদের সাথে বসে ফুটবল খেলা দেখার মজাটা লেখায় বেক্ত করা সম্ভব নয় । পছন্দের প্লেয়ার গোলের সহজ সুযোগ নষ্ট করলে আমরা যে হারে গ্যানের পরিদর্শন করি এবং  সেই প্লেয়ারের বদলে নিজের ওই মুহূর্তে , ওই স্থানে মাঠে অনুপস্থিতির জন্য আফসোস করি  সেই কথা মাথায় রেখে এবং উত্তেজনা কে বসে না রেখে অবিকল ভাবে গোলে বল মারার জন্য ফুটবল এবং গোল পোস্টের সুব্যাবস্থা আছে ।  রক ক্লাইম্বিং থেকে বোর্ড গেমস আর সাথে চমৎকার স্বাদে পছন্দের কফি , এই সব কিছুকে একসাথে ভাবতে সাহায্য করে অফ সাইড স্পোর্টস ক্যাফে । 

খাদ্য তালিকার স্বাদ নিতে গিয়ে বেশ কিছু পুরন স্মৃতি আবার মনে করিয়ে দিল বড় পর্দায় নাদাল আর ফেডারারের ফাইনাল ম্যাচ । যোগ্য সাথি হিসাবে সাথে ছিল ক্যাপাচিনো । 

আমাদের যাত্রার শুরু মজিলা চিজ সটীকস , চিজ কর্ণ রোল , ক্রিপ্সি চিলি বেবি কর্ণ এবং মাশরুম মিক্স দিয়ে ।  জেগুল প্রতেক টি স্বাদে এবং মানের বেশ উচ্চ মানের । যাত্রার শুরু এরকম ভাবে হলে বাকি টা বলার অপেক্ষা রাখে না । 

এরপর মোক্ষম জায়গায় প্রবেশ আর কি , আর তার শুরু তেই আমাদের জন্য অপেক্ষা করছিল   ভেজ মাঞ্ছুরিয়ান আর চিলি পনির । নিরামিষ এই পদ গুলি যে জিভের জল আনতে পারে তা না খেলে বোঝাই যেত না । এরপরে হাজির হল ভেজ হাক্কা নুডুলস , যা একবার খেলে বার বার খেতে ইছা করবে ।  রান্নায় তেলের পরিমানের দিকে বিশেষ ভাবে নজর দেওয়া হয়েছে । প্রত্যেকটি পদ সুস্বাদু এবং স্ব্যাস্থের পক্ষে বেশ ভালো আএ উপযোগী । এছাড়াও সাথে ছিল ভেজ লাসাগ্নে প্রত্যাশার শেষ বার্তা এবং দারুন সুস্বাদু । 

আমাদের খাদ্য যাত্রার শেষ পাওনা হিসাবে হাজির ডেথ বাই চকলেট , চকলেট কেক সাথে আইস ক্রিম মিলে এক অসাধারন মেল বন্ধন , এবং  স্বাদে স্বর্গীয় । কর্মী দের ব্যাবহার ভালই এবং সহযোগিতা মুলক । 

খেলা প্রেমি মানুষদের সময় কাটানোর আদর্শ জায়গা । বন্ধু বান্ধব নিয়ে আড্ডা দিতে দিতে এল ক্লাসিকোর ম্যাচ দেখতে দেখতে কফি , জম জমাট একটা ব্যপার হতে পারে । 

বিশেষ ধন্যবাদ -

Offside Sports Cafe is located at Bhawanipore,  near Bhawanipore Post Office. It's a sports themed cafe, which is very unique.

It mainly offers Italian, Chinese dishes.

We went on the occasion of their NO MEAT MENU launch, pure veg menu to protest cruelty against animals, would be served till 31st of march .


Ambience & decor is very interesting, with enjoyable artificial rock climbing, board games, live sports screening,  pictures of famous sportsperson , sports accessories along with  karaoke and wifi. 

It is well spaced with cosy sitting arrangements.

Staffs are very amicable and service is prompt.

In starters , we had the following - 

1)Hot cappuchino
2)Cold coffee
3)Mozzarella cheese sticks 
4)cheese corn rolls
5)crispy chilli baby corn & mushroom mix.

In main course , we had - 

1)Veg Manchurian
2)Chili paneer
3)Veg Hakka noodles 
4)veg lasagne 

All the dish were well cooked, tasty and not too spicy.
 Coffee were refreshing and enjoyable.
Mozzarella cheese sticks &  cheese corn rolls were palatable
 and cheesy.
Crispy chili baby corn & mushroom mix was very savoury.
Veg lasagne was very nicely made and cheesy . It's a treat to the taste buds.
Noodles and chilli paneer were well cooked and light, could have been better though. Chili paneer could have been more spicier.

Finally we had dessert - Death by chocolate , which was heavenly. Chocolate cake & icecream combo was terrific.

Pocket pinch is reasonable. Quantity is sufficient.

Conclusion - A decent and enjoyable place for hanging out.

Thanks Rajdeep Da for your invitation.

A nice sports cafe located in Bhawanipur. The place is just amazing with lots of activates to do, while enjoying delicious mouth-watering preparation they have to offer. The innovative decoration of this place is really amazing.  As you climb up there is a mini rock climbing wall installed and inside there is big screen with projector where you can watch your favorite sports. The ambiance is very attractive, with background music, comfortable seating and friendly staffs. A perfect place for hanging out with friends. 

Coming to the food we had Mozzarella cheese sticks and Cheese corn rolls as starter. Both starters were, crispy nicely fried and stuffed with cheese and delicious. Just perfect!!

In the main course we tried Veg Manchurian, Chili panner , veg Hakka Noodles and lasagna. Every items were very much tasty, not to spicy and nicely cooked. Though the noodles and Chili panner could have been little bit spicier. 
Lasagna was the best among the main courses we had in my opinion. A very famous Italian dish. It was one of the ultimate one-pot meals,  layers of vegetables, sauce, and cheese between sheets of pasta. Loved it.   
In the dessert section we had Death by chocolate and Darsaan. Both deserts were very much tempting. Death by chocolate was their best dish I had and absolutely loved it. Perfect combination of chocolate cake with ice cream, a real treat for your taste buds. 

Well if you want to spend some quality time with your friends while enjoying good food and games then this will be your perfect destination. 
Pocket pinch is quite reasonable as per quality and quantity they serve.  
Thanks a lot

Location : Very conveniently located near Purna Cinema (Bhawanipur)
Staff : Very courteous and well behaved.
Ambience : There are two sections. One is the smoking section where hookah is served and other one is the next smoking zone where food is served. There are projectors in both the sections. It's the perfect place to be for football, cricket or tennis matches. The music played is not too loud and the songs played are really good.
Food : I have tried their baby corn, chilli garlic noodles and Manchurian. All the three items were good. Their soda based drinks are also good.
Games : They have several board games like monopoly, stock exchange, the strategist, UNO which one can enjoy with their friends. You can play a game of darts as well. If football is your passion too, there's a mini goal post as well .

The dual giant screens with dolby sound systems has made me a regular here. The recent veg menu is a brilliant introduction and the food taste is like never before. Do try the Chinese, Melting Brownie and Lasagne. 
The Capsule coffee is also a must try.

Offside sports cafe 
This is a good place for sports lovers - interactive place, good vibes , watching matches, spend good time with groups playing board games. The big screen inside is a perfect place to watch a match with yummy food.  
This cafe talks sports with its interiors . The race tracks in the stairways, the rock climbing wall , and lush green turfs with golf balls set the mood right while entering the cafe. Small details like the ceiling , table tops wall decor , even the wall clocks are thematically done. Not only does this place look attractive but also promises good food that is well priced. 
A must recommendation to all those who havnt been here. 
My personal favourite being the wantons, hot and sour soup, and the chilli garlic noodles.

One of the few sports cafes which serves a "genuinely" good sheesha. Two big screens to make sure you don't miss out on any part of the match even while playing darts or mini soccer. The cheese corn rolls and the baby corn mushroom are a must try (Ask the waiters for suggestions according to your taste-buds). Good music, an array of board games and more to keep the place bubbling with life! Good value for money - and I could hardly say the same about any of the other sports cafes in town. Check it out!

Off side sports cafe is one of the few themed cafes in the city. The interiors are done brilliantly and I can even try ye hand at darts or practice a few penalties. The ambiance is good with comfortable seating. 

They have just launched their new all vegetarian menu, which is a brilliant move considering the location of the place. The new menu is pretty reasonably priced as well.

I tried the cheese corn rolls and the fries basket. The cheese corn rolls were brilliant. 

Must try if you want good food at light on your pocket prices.

M glad they are now an all vegetarian cafe for first quarter of this year. Mozzarella Cheese Sticks, Full Chinese Range, Cheese Corn Rolls, Farmhouse Pizza and Capsule Cappuccino are a must try.
The projection in the restaurant area is too good and things only get better after they upgraded their sound systems recently. There is no better place to see a live sporting event. 
Staff is well informed and courteous. Pricing post the new menu is super friendly. 
Not to forget the darts corner, wall climbing and the mini penalty are those areas that will make anybody freak out. You can try a hand at all of these here.

There are a few themed cafes in Calcutta but Offside Sports cafe literally takes it to the next level. It's not only well decorated but it's interactive as well. With an usable and fun artificial rock climbing setup to a goal post for those free kicks. They also do have the typical darts and a whole array of board games as well. All of this is well complemented by their scrumptious food offerings and great service. Plus parking here isnt a problem as well. All of it adds on to a delightful and fun cafe going experience. Plus they have two separate zones for match screenings as well. All in all the place is aces!!!

Previously The Blu Banana.  

The is very fitting and the Ambience is well made up with different indoor sports.  Well decorated. 
The place is cheap and reasonable considering the Hookah. But a little overpriced when comes to Food and Mocktails.  
The place can do a lot better. 
Service is Good and attentive.  
It was a fine visit.

No 1 point of eating out is Food - Great mix of starters to a variety of main course ensured all of us had something great to eat. The fries were crisp and the burger is huge to go with, the pasta was delightful and you could feel the spices tingling in every bite and mostly the human factor (the owner's) is worth applauding, gentle and calm they'd help us select a great combination in terms of sufficient quantity and varied dishes. 

2) Service - I've already talked about the human factor but these guys have a way in comforting everyone, while we were juggling with our orders they were patient enough to help us decide, the team checks up on everything right from the point you enter to the coal refil for the Hooka( ask the owners the recipe for making it look so easy, they say Attention To Detail)

3) Ambience - As you step in you'd find the inspiration wall which is full of quotes from Sporting legend's across every game. There are not one but two projectors to take care of IPL as well as EPL. The sound is delightful and the feel of the place gives you and your friends a good time.

Overall Great Food, Great Service and Great Ambience (these can be bought) but in all sincerity Wonderful owner's who'd ensured we were not just happy but delighted. Thanks for making our day.

A great pocket-friendly sports cafe to hang out for watching matches or just to chill with friends. Good food - interesting menu, loved how they have used the richest sportsmen in the world to segregate the dishes on the menu. It's a good mix of finger food and mains. A good selection of SHISHA with interesting specials called match day wonders. Reverse swing is a must try,with an iced tea base. Absolutely loved it! The service is good, warm and hospitable. The decor is nice and innovative focussed on sports and popular sportsmen. The place has variety of board games you could play, two full-sized screens to watch all the matches as well some unique things like darts, a goal post and a rock-climbing wall. 
Uniquely designed and thought of, a great place to hang out with loads of things to do over some good food and SHISHA. 
Absolutely loved the experience and has become a regular hangout for me and my friends.

Its good to be back to writing reviews after quite a long break. I visited offside this Sunday. This place is located on the 1st floor and as you enter you are greeted by some legendary sporting personalities and their famous quotes. The wall is done bright yellow and I absolutely loved the entry. As you climb up there is a mini rock climbing wall installed at which you can try your hand.

Offside is a sports cafe and the interiors are done brilliantly. Love the large screens in the two areas. The ambiance is nice and cozy. We ordered for a couple of sheeshas and they were decent, good smoke and flavor but i still feel they could be better.

Moving on to the food we ordered quite a few items. We had chicken wantons, pan fried chilli fish and fish fingers for starters. The wantons was crisp and good with their sauce. I loved the pan friend chilli fish but the fish fingers got a little extra fried according to me and were too brown for my liking.

We had veg fried rice and schezwan noodles. The noodles could have been spicier. We ordered for chilli chicken and schezwan chicken. The chicken pieces were tender and juicy and the gravy was good. 

We ended our meal with Death by chocolate which by far is their best dish and I absolutely loved it. It was so chocolaty with brownie and ice cream and chocolate bits sprinkled on top. It was sinfully indulgent and the best way to end the meal.

Pocket pinch for two at this place would be around 700. You should go and try out the place if you still haven't. It great value for money and they have great offers going that one can avail.

This place has a relaxing atmosphere where one can spend long hours by enjoying their food as well as play different board games, a hand on the dart, penalty football shoot out while their order is being served. The staffs being very efficient, polite and friendly generate a very warm feeling that makes one come back again n again to this cafe...
Try out their Mixed sauce pasta, Chicken Club sandwich and Barbecue chicken with mushroom sauce. The cafe has 2 giant projectors showing live sports. It also has a separate sitting area which at other times can be booked for private parties and gatherings! So....friends visit this place yourself ASAP!!!

Last time I checked Calcutta had sports cafes, their "sport"-iness was just limited to the logo or name of the cafe.

But here's a cafe that's got the name, AND the GAME! Like literally! Right from the entrance to the walls to the tables to the menu, everything is sporty. So its safe to say, they have the ambience taken care of! Its pretty engaging too as every corner you look at will have some element of sports that will quench those sport-needy eyes. By the way, they have an actual real life rock climbing wall too!

They have really friendly staff and their wide range of coffee and tea is flattering. What I really liked was that the owners take direct interest in serving their customers and one of the three partners is always there to make sure every table is walking out with a smile on their faces.

Among the cuisines, they serve continental, chinese and many more. Chinese is to die for as the chef is from a very famous social club in Calcutta. Pizzas are awesome too since they are thin crust and the cheese seems like its been imported from Switzerland itself as it seems very fresh. They serve hukkah too with a wide variety of flavors.

Thanks Cafe OFFSIDE for living upto the name of a sports cafe!

Erstwhile known as "Blue Banana" this cafe got more awesome after all the renovation stuff..This place is solely dedicated to sports lover and specifically football lovers(like me) can hardly make the mistake to miss this place...The staff remaining the same provide a great hospitable environment. Food and hookah are up to the mark. In short a great place to enjoy with friends...
P.S-ISL matches in giant screen, I am in love with this place...

Fabulous place and a haven for all sports fans! There is a super fun rock climbing wall to begin with - followed by great hookah and cappuccino! The ambience is great and there are lots of things to do including a net to practice scoring your footie goals in! A must visit!
