This is not one of the sophisticated caf√©s but the food is really good. We ordered pasta in red and white sauce and cheese and corn Maggi. I didn't find the ambience good due lack of sitting space. And there weren't any tables either. Since this place is near one of main tourist hubs of Kolkata, I'd suggest to add few tables so as to accommodate more customers.

Located in the busy lane of Jorasanko,this  is a pocket friendly fast food serving place.They have AC seating arrangements for their foodies and the good thing is they don't charge any extra penny for it.Tge host is also very amiable.Coming towards food,its good and yes it is hygienic and a value for money.Mostly it's a good hub for students like us who are having their classes in and around thakurbari area.Oviously who wouldn't love to indulge into some good affordable food after long classes.

P.S:- Try their cheese vadapao,its yum in tum.

I visited the newly added air conditioned section of the Cafe. The prices are still very reasonable. The host is also friendly.
This is absolutely value for money.

Small local food joint in the Jorasako Lane
Generally adda kinda place for tuition goers there.
Sober Staffs though service may get bit delay
Nothing about ambience as it's just that few sitting stools are there... nothing else
I was there with a friend of mine
On our first visit, We ordered pasta, pizza... Well cooked and fresh.
On our second visit Tried their cold coffee with ice-cream... Tastes good.
Pocket friendly place.
Recommendable ‚ù§

It's among one of the addabaji cafes for tuition Center students and others. However, the food is good and suitable for an evening snack time. Sitting area is not too big and it's more of a casual visit with no other option.

Situated near my coaching center. So whenever we have long classes we went here for feed our hunger. They serve good quality, healthy n tasty snacks. Always get satisfied by taste but service is quite slow. Staff was very friendly.
