Decent food. Have ordered delivery couple of times. Chinese is surprisingly better than the north Indian here. 
Their combos are value for money

Me and cousins went there for dinner couple of days ago . It's was an average experience for me, the ambience was good,the quantity and the quality of the food was also good and the staffs are also cooperative and I would like to recommend the mutton biriyani they made it light as well as tasty.
I will say it is a nice place for dinning at a low price .

Food is good however service is too slow. We had to wait around 40 mins to get a plate of biriyani. They are yet to learn multitasking. All seems to be confused taking orders. Small things require their attentuon like once the cust leaves someone should clean the table immediately. They left it as it is. Good for take aways.

2mins walk from my house. So a regular takeaway place for me. It's a start up in the area. In my opinion needs improvements in menu and professionalism. Dine in place is small but ok. The problem is the service time. It takes ages to get 1 item served at table. Their kitchen is tiny after all.

Food quality and and quantity is good.
Healthy food without ajina moto.
Biryani, phirni, chilli chicken, pan fried chicken , crispy chicken r nice.
Price is reasonable.

Fried rice and noodles need improvements.
Availability is sometimes an issue for tandoor items

Now the sad part their hot and sour soup is out of the world fiery hot can cause u ulcer in a minute. contains microscopic dots of chicken. The taste is ok.

Worst part is professionalism. The cash counter lady is the most unruly, arrogant and unprofessional woman I've ever seen in life _ disappointment for regular visitors. She would create confusions among the waiting que. Otherwise others are ok.

This is a new place. We went there during Durga Puja . The place is decent with respect to the decor.But almost 50 percent of the menu wasn't available, waiters were taking orders without noting them down somewhere - hence they were mixing up one order with the other . They also made us wait over an hour before serving food.
The food was quite average but the overall experience was disappointing.

I ordered chicken rezala and laccha paratha. The chicken rezala was too oily. The paratha was okayish! I hope they improve in the coming days, I wish them best of luck for the coming days. Kudos for the effort!

This place is very near to chetla agrani. After a pandal hopping we decided to visit this place. We ordered lemon chicken and mixed fried rice. I tried lemon chicken from many places, this one is one of the best. Mixed fried rice also very good , quantity can be improved. A cozy place for lovely dinner.

The best thing about this place is,it is one of the good places in the vicinity which has almost no competitor around.Prices are ok,ambiance quite good.If this place can maintain their quality and quantity of their food this place has good exponential growth.

A nice cozy, sublime interior with well behaved and polite staff. The taste of the food is also good but needs to cut down on the oily part cause it is chinese . Expecting a lot more from you guys cause you have the potential to do better.

Rolls are good.But not all food are available at times, which are in the menu.And I would like try the Chinese items next time hopefully that would be great.Till now the food which I tried is good .But the area of the restaurant is very odd I don't know it will get success or not ... overall it is average.
