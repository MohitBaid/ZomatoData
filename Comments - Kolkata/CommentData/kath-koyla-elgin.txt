One of the favourite destinations for veg cuisine in all types like Thai,Chinese and continental.
 From kiwi hookah to deserts, all had its own speciality n can't be compared with any other.
  Starters - tandoori ki aloo
                    Dahi ki kabab
      The aloo had so good stuff n the grilling was done very nicely. Dahi ki kabAb had a different taste with sauce and salad.
           Cottage cheese in chilly basil sauce
           Crispy mushroom in hot garlic sauce 
    I must say they were spicy and damn tasty with varieties of spices and flavours.
  Main course -Shezwan fried rice
                       Exotic vegetables in hot garlic sauce 
                      Chilly potato gravy. 
The chilly potato was sweet n.spicy and I loved the taste. The fried rice was very delightful.
    Thai - paneer butter masala 
             Aloo do pyaza
            Dal makkhani ( damn tasty n creamy)
  we also had amazing pizzas like multani mushroom pizza and paneer makhani pizza.
  But the tiramishu special dessert took away my heart when I saw the amazing way of designing and the taste was yum. Cheese cream n chocolate together got fused to melt my heart.

This place is located right in between Bhawanipur College and Forum mall . It's a pure vegetarian restaurant which promises to serve you a variety of delicacies of different cuisines and to my delight - It didn't disappoint . 
The ambience is good, I liked the interiors . The lights should have been a bit more brighter . The seatings are very comfortable . 

We ordered Tandoori Aloo and Dahi ke kebab for our starters and lived both of them . Specially the Aloo was spicy and had a unique flavour to it . 
Next we ordered some Cottage Cheese in Chilli Basil sauce which was good , and the crispy Mushroom in Hot Garlic Sauce . We were half full and decided to move on to the main course . 

For the mains , we had 

Schezwan Fried Rice with Chilli Potato Gravy and a plate of Exotic vegetables in garlic sauce . Not great , I would say , but my friends loved it . Though I fell in love with the rice . Smoky flavour and slightly spicy flavour made it better . 

For Indian Cuisine we ordered Dal Makhani , Aloo do pyaza with Masala Kulchas and Butter Naan . Mindblowing will be the right word to describe these above delicacies . 

We were full by then so we moved on to have some hookah . The kiwi flavoured Hookah was well prepared . We also had the Multani Mushroom Pizza and the Paneer Makhani Pizza along with the hookah . The Mushroom one was the best mushroom pizza I have ever had . Truly FANTASTIC . Recommended* 

Dessert : We had the Kahlua Tiramisu to end our meal which was just perfect . It had the amazing coffee flavour and was also creamy unlike other Tiramisu's . Full points on presentation too . 

Non veg lovers like me will be a bit hesitant to visit a pure vegetarian restaurant , but this is what sets this place apart from most others . You will be an instant regular here . 

RECOMMENDED :-)

Located beside bhawanipore college this outlet wasn't hard to locate. The place as a good ambience with dim lighting.
Coming to the food we started with hookah and gum flavours. In the starters we had Paneer Makhani pizza and Multani mushroom pizza. Both were delicious.
The other starters were Tandoori aloo, cottage cheese in chilli basil sauce, mushroom in hot garlic sauce and Dahi ke kebab. 
For the main course we had a thali with paneer butter masala , dal Makhani and aloo do pyaza. Also we had schezwan rice with exotic vegetables in hot garlic sauce and chilli potato gravy. The rice was simply amazing. Despite being spicy it was good.
For desert we had the Kahlua tiramisu. It was plain awesome. I'll be looking forward to my next visit.

Kath Koyla is a hookah parlour cum pure vegetarian restaurant in Elgin Road offering a good array of Indian, Chinese and Italian food. The restaurant is not very big but the decor and ambience is beautiful and sophisticated. Try their Chinese starters, Italian Pizzas and Indian Thalis. The variety of flavours and bases of hookah they serve are really good. This restaurant is definitely worth a visit.

We were blown away by the wonderful ambience, the dim lighting and the soothing decor right when we entered this restaurant. Located right beside Bhawanipur College, this place is a vegetarian's paradise. 
We ordered a kiwi hookah. For starters we took the Dahi Kebab and Paneer in Chilly Basil Sauce.
For mains we had the Paneer Makhani Pizza,  Schzewan Fried Rice and Exotic Vegetables in Hot Garlic Gravy. Didn't have any space in our tummy for desserts.
The hookah was quite good, with a wide base and refreshing kiwi flavours with spring water.
The Dahi Kebab was succulent and bursting with robust flavours. The hung yoghurt dip complemented the kebabs perfectly. The Paneer in Chilly Basil Sauce was bursting with Oriental flavours, it had the heat of green peppers and the tang of lemongrass.
The pizza was a unique marriage of Indian and Western flavours, with the chargrilled paneer cubes coming together with ooey-gooey mozzarella cheese on a super-crunchy base.
The Fried Rice was one of the best I've had,PERIOD ! It had a unique smoky flavour that really worked. The exotic vegetables in Hot Garlic Gravy was a tad bit too hot for my palate. Had to wash it down with copious amounts of water, but if you are a fan of spicy Chinese, this is what you should order.
I would definitely recommend Kath-Koyla to vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.

Good vegetarian restaurants are opening up in Kolkata for a long-needed change. It's reason pay a visit to one when its opened at the heart of the city. It's situated beside Forum and wasn't hard to locate.
The place is decently furnished and is done in warm tones.
We started with hookah in apple and gum flavours. 
For starters we had Paneer Makhani pizza and Multani Mushroom pizza. The mushroom pizza tasted great
We also had Dahi ke kebab, Tandoori aloo, Cottage cheese in chilli basil sauce and Mushroom in hot garlic sauce. The Mushroom in hot garlic sauce tasted amazing.
For the main course we had
Thali which had assorted breads and Aloo do piyaza and Dal makhani for sides. The Thali tasted great specially the dal makhani
Schezwan rice, with Exotic vegetables in hot garlic sauce and Chilli potato gravy. The schezwan, though a little spicy, was very well made.
Lastly, for dessert we had Kahlua Tiramisu. It was presented very well and tasted heavenly too

Kath Koyla is located very near to Forum Mall at Elgin Road.
The name will surely make you think that it can be anything but not a cafe or a restaurant.
This small looking outlet has a well decorated ambiance with huge tv screens and quick and fast service as you can get.
Tried few of their dishes and they were..

1. Paneer Tikka - Colourful and hot came in the stick. Tasted very well.

2. Multani Mushroom - Their is always a dish which will stole the show and this was the one. Beautifully marinated and cooked brilliantly that made this dish ao special.

3. Chilli Garlic Noodles - Yellow noodles came in a black bowl filled with veggies.

4. Vegetable Manchurian - I have always liked manchurians and this was also a decent one.

5. Gajar ka Halwa : Lesser in sweet and tasted nice.

A beautiful dinner sorted.

Visited this place with some friends of mine earlier this week. It is located near Bhawanipore College, just above Sumo Dough. It is a pure vegetarian caf√© with a seating space of upto 40 people. For all the hookah lovers, I think this is the only place in Kolkata that serves shisha with natural wooden coals. This helps in preserving the flavour and a longer hookah session. We tried the 5 Paan flavour and it was awesome.

For food, we tried American Corn Salt Pepper, Multani Mushroom Tikka, Crispy Chilli Potato and Veg Chelo Kebab for starters. Out of these I would definitely recommend the mushrooms and chilli potato.
Also ordered the Vegetable Manchurian with Chilli Garlic Noodles. Not bad if you are in mood for some oriental.

Chocolate Darsaan is amazing for a dessert. I really like its classic flavour but this chocolaty twist was divine.

Very conveniently located at Elgin Road (walk straight from Forum toward Bhawanipore college), you will spot this place on the 1st floor of Sumo Dough.

This place serves vegetarian dishes only. My recommendations would be -

American Corn Salt Pepper
Chelo Kebab
Kulcha Platter
Chilli Garlic Noodles
Vegetable Manchurian
Chocolate Darsan

Price is quite reasonable. Service could be better.

This place almost year old but not so well known in the town but after today's visit I must say this place is a hidden gem.Located just 2-3 minutes walking from forum mall opposite the bhawanipore college.This place is epitome of tasty vegetarian dishes.
 Interior is done meticulously & the ambience here is totally magnetic.This place well lit with it's yellow lighting & it has cosy sitting arrangement.
Service is promt & well behaved but need a little more efficiency.
Now lets talk about the food now..
American corn salt pepper-this is crispy & tasty(recommend)
Virjin mojito-refreshing & mood changer(highly recommended)
Multani mushroom tikka-this was totally awesome.Chessy & succulent (A must try)
Paneer tikka-paneer was also too good
Kulcha plateer-this is unique dish with it's unique taste.Kulcha were so soft & lip smacking
Pindi chana along with assorted breads is perfect combo(recommended)
Vegetable Manchurian-it was tasty & spicey
Chilli Garlic noodle-spicey & quantity was huge
Though dessert section was bit let down.
Gajar ka halwa was not that good.
 All total my 1st experience with kath koyla was pretty awesome & I must say this place definitely  worth a visit .

This space located on the floor above Sumo Dough is going to change your opinion if you say you don't like vegetarian food. 
The interior is nicely done with plush couches and comfortable chairs and soothing yellow lighting. It's chic and suave and looks more like a diner than a hookah parlor. Perfect for a hang out with your gang with hookah if you're not a fan of the dim lit, stuffy and smoky hookah places. 
Coming to food : 
1) American corn salt pepper : a good munchie. (4/5)
2) Multani mushroom tikka : quite the winner. Juicy button mushrooms in a creamy, cheesy coat. (5/5)
3) Chelo Kebab : Potato and Paneer kebabs with butter rice and onion salad. The potatoes were crisp outside, pillowey inside. The paneer was nice with the creamy rich sauce. Another great dish. (5/5)
4) Pindi Chana : Pindi Chana so good like you've hardly ever tried before. Soft, smooth chana and aloo in a tangy, perfectly balanced masala. (5/5)
5) Chilly Garlic Noodles : Spicy. Might be good to spend some time with. (3/5)
6) Vegetable Manchurian : the sauce was thin enough to pass as soup. And pretty spicy. (3/5)
7) Chocolate Darsaan : crispy fried noodles dipped in chocolate sauce served in a tumbler over vanilla ice cream. It's quiet a good finger-dessert. (4/5)

The service is courteous and attentive but does need a little more efficiency. 
Overall, a good experience. Quite a good option for chilling out over hookah in a spacious and well ventilated place.

Kath Koyla is situated in Elgin Road,near Bhawanipur Education Society.It's basically a vegetarian restaurant with hookah.Visited this place¬† in this evening with bunch of friends.

American corn salt pepper was perfect to start with,it's crispy and awesome.
Paneer Tikka and Multani Mushroom Tikka were amazingly tasty,highly recommended of them.
Crispy Chilli Potato was enjoyable.
Have you ever tried Veg Chelo Kebab?Try it if you want to taste something different.I have never thought that it would come out so well.
In main course,Pindi Chana went well with the Assorted breads.
Dal Makhni is a recommended one of them with the Kulchas,terrific in taste.
One can try the Chilli Garlic Noodles with Veg manchurian,the manchurian balls were small and delicious with the gravy.
Finally in desert,Chocolate Darsan was wonderful and yummy,but Gajar Ka Halwa could be better.

Overall had a terrific dinner today at the Kath Koyla with good food, wonderful service.

This is located just beside bhawanipur college, just above sumo dough, on the first floor . 
The ambience could've been better for sure . 
Spacious, and good lighting. 
We ordered, virgin mojito which was refreshing.
For starters we had American salt and pepper corn, fried potatoes, multani mushroom Tikka and paneer Tikka. The mushrooms are a must try. Others too tasted decent. 
For main course we settled with chello kebab, the gravy and rice complimented each other pretty well. 
Then came, assorted bread basket, which is a huge portion . We had pindi chola along with it. 
And to try few of Chinese, tasted the chilli garlic noodles and veg Manchurian. They were prepped decent enough. 
I was a tad disappointed with the desserts. 
Chocolate darsan was good but gajar ka halwa wasn't to the point. 

The place sure is worth a visit. üòÅ

Horrible service. Charges extra service charges of 10%  though waived off after saying. This is total fraud and says thos is our company rule. Poor staff behavior. Total waste of money. If you ask for normal water dey wl say that tap water is very dirty. God know do they cook wid which water . Dirty plates. For dinner staff giving quarter plate and telling we provide this nly. No serving of food also. Just kept on table and went. Have to tell everything to staff to do dis and dat.

Located at the upper floor of Sumo Dough, Near Bhawanipur College, Kath Koyla is a quite a good place for hookah. We already had our stomach full, so we just had hookah. That was nicely prepared. Give a try.

I went last night to Kath Koyla for a takeway..I was waiting in the car and checking out the menu to order the same..Then someone from the restrau came and told to go inside and order when there was already a person there to take the order for the takeway. They were so immature that they dint even ask for the order again since we restrained to go inside and order. Then we left and there was no one to stop us and wait.
This rude and immature behaviour shows the way the restrau is running and the kind of people working there.
Its a strict no when the people only are not professional then how will the food taste good.

The service is pathetic and they don‚Äôt have half the items on the menu. They are running a hookah parlour but they don‚Äôt have a bottle of mineral water.
The bill is attached can‚Äôt even print the bill properly what the hell !!

New place n a part of Sumo dough in 1st Floor.. Spacious bt sitting arrangement is a bit awkward.. N d tables r too low to hav food or anything as u hav to bend a lot.. Staff was new so Der was a bit of confusion n delay..  Italian is realy delicious n is made in d kitchen of Sumo dough ..  Along wid Italian v can hav North Indian also n V tried black daal n paneer.. All were tasty along wid Shisha.. At last waffles were realy d 1 to try.. Quantity of d North Indian veggies needs to b improved as compared to the charges.. Many improvmnets needs to b done bt still should try..

This place is located near Bhawanipore Collage, its on the 1st floor, the reason behind my giving 2 star is just for the interior.
We have ordered fr 1 sheesha Kachchi Kairi+Lemon which was ok. After a while we ordered for 1 lemon iced tea & we had to wait for so long, we asked a waitress that what happened to our order & she sent the hookah maker to check the hookah i mean what the hell, The hookah maker said that the waitress is having a knowledge of hookah only thats why she got confused, though after 10 mins of that incident finally lemon iced tea came which was good in taste.
Then I ordered a hot chocolate which took too long to be served & after a first sip i found it cold as good as regular water, i ask them to heat it up & then it came in a proper way but i must say they need to improve in every department.
The service is pathetic, the waitresses doesn't have the food knowledge & service is slow too.
It was the worst experience.

The restaurant owned by the same management as Sumo Dough. They have mainly North Indian cuisine along with Italian cuisine which is from Sumo Dough itself. Prices are nominal. Staff was courteous. Music and feel of the place is insane. Food was lip-smacking. Quantity of the food is poor.

The place is extremely understaffed & has very poor service. We had to call out for the waiter atleast 5 times to place an order or go upto the kitchen door before anyone even attended. Kath Koyla, the signature hookah they serve was very disappointing as there were problems arising with it for the first half an hour. Food was also very average.

So a place with an authentic bengali name 'kath koyla' serves only vegetarian. How does that even make sense? Bengalis are almost 100% non vegetarian.

Ambience isn't that great. You might feel like you are sitting in an office's waiting area.
Music played was pretty decent. Not so loud noise.
Hookah is very nice.
Italian food which we ordered was by Sumo Dough:
Cheese Garlic Bread- nothing great.
Veg Lasagne- Very good in taste, had lost of cheese and vegetables.

Unfortunately, the standard at this lounge was very poor. Where do I start? Having entered the lounge, we had to adjust ourselves in the huge seating arrangement , which is very uncomfortable to sit and talk when you are a group of 3-4. We wanted to shift to the private glass area with TV , once we saw its empty we asked the waiter to shift us in. After sitting there we saw the Tv remote and we switched the channel to something else. The manager indirectly argued with the waiter and we were asked to behave the way he wants us to and watch what he decides to. We were served horrible hookah which was not even worth a penny. To add it up food was served after ages and plate had ants crawling to our misery! Thankfully there was enough oregano to add up to the tasteless pasta. Don‚Äôt take it personally. It isn‚Äôt about you, it‚Äôs about your restaurant. Someone dined at your restaurant and had a bad experience. Sit back, take a deep breath and look at it objectively. Read the review thrice if you need to, and address every single problem.

Had been to this place, along with my friends during the afternoon. We wanted to try the new Kath Koyla hookah. It had intense dense smoke, but it kept choking in regular intervals. So this is something upon which they really need to work on. The food here is amazing with absolutely no complaints. Most importantly, what requires special focus here is the seating arrangement. It is really uncomfortable with limited capacity. Moreover, staff communication is good and they're helpful, but need more professionalism. Overall, a good place to visit. Hoping for better changes next time. Cheers!

A good place with a great ambience to be in. The staff is very friendly and caters to all the problems calmly and with interest. We ordered paneer makhani pizza, mixed sauce pasta, blueberry cheese cake and strawberry shake. There is nothing to complain against any of the dishes as all of it was great to taste and the quantity is also apt for 2 to 3 people.
Coming to sisha it is also great. Keep the good work on. Looking forward to another visit.

Kath Koyla is a newly established cafe that mainly specialises in north indian food and along side also serves italian cuisine.Not following the trend this place focuses more on taste of the food than its presentation.Its a 30-40 seater place which has got quite a calm ambiance but a slow service.We also didnt like its seating as you will find a much gap between the table and seats.Now coming to food we had-

1:Oreo Shake
2:Kitkat shake
3:Chelo Kebab
4:Paneer Tikka Pizza(Too oily)

Among them the must try was their "Chelo kebab".

Food-4/5
Service-3.5/5
Ambiance-4/5

Their Italian Dishes are from Sumo Dough.

The ambience of this place as good as its food. I liked the food and the dessert. The hookah which they serve is even good. This place is perfect to hang out few hours with your friends. The only disadvantage is that the tables are clubbed together i.e no segregation between two separate tables and hence during rush hours you end up sitting bedside strangers.

The minute I learnt about the restaurant owned by the same management as Sumo Dough, Kath Koyla seemed irresistible.
The interiors have been done brilliantly with a very limited seating capacity. What is queer about Kath Koyla,apart from its name, is whether it wants to exhibit itself as a cafe or a proper fine dining restaurant. The menu sticks to the North Indian cuisine along with the Italian line of dishes from Sumo Dough itself.
We opted for the Veg platter which was absurdly priced at Rs 595+taxes, absolutely not worth the content it carries.
The Chelo Kebab was a different story altogether!
It was simply deliciously amazing! The best curry dish I've had in ages. The steamed rice accompanied with rich paneer and aloo curry was a stellar. Undoubtedly the best dish we had.
For main course,we had-
Paneer-topped pizza which was quite good.
Dal makhni was yet another impressive dish we came across,perfectly cooked to perfection.
Aloo masala was good as well but the Pindi Chana was a let down.
‚úî Food- The food was lip smacking and lived upto my expectations by all means!
‚úî Staff was courteous but there is scope for improvement to make the process a bit faster.
‚úî Prices are nominal apart from the Price for the platter which I found very unreasonable.

‚úñ I found the seating a bit uncomfortable for a restaurant which serves North Indian food,the low tables just don't go with cuisine somehow.
‚úñ Quantity was surprisingly poor, or maybe we couldn't just have enough of the good food placed before us!

P.S.- Do try the Chelo Kebab!

This is one of the best places for North Indian! Had their Chelo Kebab, which was absolutely amazing. This is definitely going to give Peter Cat a run for the money (Only for vegetarians though). The Paneer makhni gravy is outstanding. 

The music and the feel of the place is insane! Looking forward to my next visit already.
