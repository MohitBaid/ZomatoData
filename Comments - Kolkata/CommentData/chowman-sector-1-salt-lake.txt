I have ordered food from Chowman a zillion times (like literally). It offers the best Chinese for a reasonable price. The delivery is fast and efficient. The restaurant has a nice ambience and the service is good too. This restaurant is definitely the best for Chinese takeaway in Kolkata for me.

An awesome authentic Chinese restaurant to try out near salt lake area . Decoration, service , food all were pretty awestrucking . The Chinese theme and the decorations along with the budhha statue and budhha bells sort of things were eye-catching. 
Now comming to the foods :

Garlic peeper chicken-  The first thing you'll notice in the dish is the patterned garnishing of the dish. The dish was enough tasty as anyone would expect from any authentic Chinese restaurant. It was a medium spicy and is mostly consumable for anyone who has a issue with spices.

Schezwan hakka mix noodles: If you're the person who likes spicy dishes,then surely it's for you. A tasty combination of spices, schezwan sauce and perfectly cooked noodles will probably make your day.

Chilli Garlic hakka mix noodles : It's a perfect blend of noodles and chilli sauce along with a seasoning of garlic. It's a medium spicy dish that tastes pretty good . 

Chowman special rice: It's a rice blended with a schezwanny sauce containing good amount of prawns in it. But it's mostly for rice lovers. I will not recommend it to the people who like noodles also. Noodles over here is a much better choice than rice. 

Manchurian chicken- A 12 piece of tasty chiken pieces along with a great Manchurian sauce. This is one of the best Manchurian chicken I've tasted so far. All things about this side dish was perfect. The spices were good and consumable for anyone. I'll recommend this dish to take as a side dish to anyone out there. 

It was a pretty good experience over here. All foodies should try this restaurant at least once. And if youre a Chinese food lover and didn't visited this, then probably you should visit ASAP. 

Ratings as per me for Chowman would be :
Food: 4/5
Decoration: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5

After a hectic day at office, me and my cousin went to Chowman to satiate our taste buds. Unlike our other visits, we decided to go light this time.

Chowman, like always had the perfect ambience, well mannered staff. While it's true that there are several restaurants out there which serves Chinese food, what sets apart Chowman is the manager who personally visits each table to inquire about the quality of food. Moreover, the authenticity of the food is an unparalleled match. 

We had ordered- 
1. Chicken Schewan style meifoon
2. Chicken fried rice 
3. Crispy Baby corn with button mushroom

A pretty Chinese¬†restaurant in Kolkata which serves authentic Chinese food has excellent ambience and pocket-friendly¬†food items. The staff crew are helpful and helps you choose the perfect combination of main course and sides with them. The manager visits your table and takes a note of your experience and is very friendly. Coming to the food we were extremely hungry hot and fresh food was served to us within ten minutes.

1. CHILLI GARLIC NOODLES-- A semi-spicy noodle item which was extremely tasty and will definitely satisfy every noodle lover out there. Went perfectly with the Kung Pao Chicken.

2.¬†CHOWMAN'S SPECIAL RICE-- A spicy yet very tasty rice item which was loaded with strips of chicken, vegetables, shrimp and topped with an egg wrap. The quantity was enough for two people and try taking a less spicy gravy item with it.

3. KUNG PAO CHICKEN-- An exotic Asian¬†chicken recipe which is extremely tastebud soothing and pairs up well with almost every noodle/ rice dishes. The nuts used in the preparation was the secret to the amazing flavour of it.

4. ROASTED CHILLI PORK-- The best chilli pork dish I have tried in Kolkata. It was spicy and hot and the pork was extremely well cooked and tasty. Loaded with spices and exotic sauces it was the best item and was their top recommendation. If you have not yet tried out their chilli pork then what are you doing still?

TOP RECOMMENDED DISH-- Roasted Chilli pork.

Awesome ambiance, 10/10. I have uploaded quite a few pics.

Let me come to food directly. We ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Mixed Hakka Noodle and Roasted Chilli Pork and crunchy nuts with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. My feelings with the food is mixed. The babycorn was less crispy but more hard, however the sauce it was tossed in was good. The noodle was very very ordinary. It read as wok tossed on the menu but there was no hint of wok at all. By crunchy nuts all they meant was baked chassew.

I must admire the roasted chilli pork. It was on their suggestion and I was really very happy with it. The pork was tender and juicy, the sauce was nice and tasty and overall 10/10.

Yestersay my family went with me for having chinese cuisine at dinner time.We ordered a Manchow Soup, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Fried Veg Coins and Schezwan Rice but none of the dish satisfied us on taste basis as it has been earlier in several occasion.
Basically desire of being in Chowman ended yesterday bcoz not a single dish was upto the level of what we went for in Chowman.

The flavors of star annis was so strong. I would suggest dont use too much star annis. Otherwise good restaurant. Peaceful ambience. Nice decor.

Located in Sector 1 near WBUT, in an area that has become Diner's paradise. Once inside the ambience is sure to grab your attention and has very cosy vibe to it. We ordered Chicken Wanton soup, pan fried chilli fish and sliced chicken schezuan noodles as starters. The fish deserves a special mention here, having the right balance of flavour and spice definitely worth a try. In the main course we ordered crab meat in chilli basil, chilli chicken wine, mixed meifoon noodles and wok tossed chicken Hakka noodles. The crab got polished off in no time, the meifoon has always been their flagship dish and it was expectedly good, the Hakka noodles and the wine chicken was pretty good as well but nothing extraordinary about them. To finish off we order the tutti fruti ice-cream as dessert and it was surprisingly good with all the fruits and the jelly.
We had a wonderful time and would definitely like to visit again. The only problem however is that the place remains closed down a lot and that has spoilt a lot of our visit plans in the earlier days.

This place has an amazing vibe coupled with dim chic lights and a casual vibe on the hearts of Sector 1, Salt Lake. Amazing chinese and family dining go hand in hand here. The interior portrays the class of this place. I gave this outlet a try and was definitely impressed with this one!

The meal started with :

‚Ä¢ Chilli Pan Fried Fish ( Starter ) : The fish was marinated with a diced and spiced up layer of chilli and was delicious. The panfried fish was well tossed and the aroma turned out to be great.

‚Ä¢ Mixed Shanghai Noodles : The noodles tasted good and the chicken, egg and prawn
with it made a wonderful combination. The noodles is just another variety that you have in other chinese cuisines and there is not much of a speciality.

‚Ä¢ Sea Food Fried Rice : It had an aromatic base and turned out to be quite soothing. I absolutely loved the shrimps in the rice which tasted good.

‚Ä¢ Kung Pao Chicken : This one was a bit watery but the gravy made up with spices and vegetables was decent enough. The chicken gave it a texture against the gravy and tasted average enough with the noodles.

‚Ä¢ Hunan Chicken : It tasted fabulous and the soft cubes of chicken which was well cooked with spices and herbs, made it a perfect side dish to the Fried Rice.

‚Ä¢ Meifoon : It was loaded with flavours. Loved the prawn which was mixed with it. I developed a liking for the prawn they serve. Fresh and juicy , the prawns are definitely blissful. This dish is a perfect delicacy to go with any other side dish from their menu!

I must say, the service is very good and the pricing is reasonable. The quality of the food is top notch but the quantity is okayish.

Head here for a scrumptious and delicious splurge - worthy Chinese meal!

Ambience : 4/5
Taste Quotient : 4/5
Service : 4.5/5

This food junction needs no introduction and it's also featured in great Chinese in zomato.
Located near baishaki,salt lake city.
We visited this place during puja time.This place has a dim light ambiance which creates a soothing atmosphere. Their staffs were courteous and the foods were served quickly.
We ordered Szechuan fried rice, Kung pao chicken, garlic chicken and American chopsuey.
Each items tasted brilliant in their own way.
Specially if you're an American chopsuey lover then you need to visit this place again and again.
I would recommend each Chinese foods lover to visit this wonderful place.

Chowman has been one of my forever favourite Chinese restaurants ever since I visited it for the first time. The soothing ambience and decor is one of the best attractions! üíï
I have tried out mostly all the items but some of my personal favourites which I‚Äôd love to mention are the Fish pepper salt - The perfect mix of spicy pepper in finely cut slices of fish! 
Pan fried chilli fish/chicken - Pan fried items are so light yet very delish so these have to be my favs!
TomYum Soup - This soup has been the most filling soup I have tried, it has the perfect blend of spices which doesn‚Äôt make it too spicy nor too light! 
In main courses, you should definitely try Schezwan Fried rice, Cantonese Noodles, Kung Pao Chicken to mention a few! 
Coming to desserts, I had the Nutty delight which is vanilla ice cream with nuts and choco chips and chocolate sauce, it is served in a cute bulb cup which is like a cherry on the top. ‚ù£Ô∏è
Overall the food is very good, very filling and a perfect affordable brunch. üíñüò¨

Chowman is such a great brand that it doesn't need any review for its promotion, and I am not promoting this brand at all!

Really the taste of foods, quality, good portions of dishes, ambience, hospitality everything are optimized to claim 10/10 score.

Especially, if you love pork, please don't miss their pork dishes. Such a nice level of cooking with a perfect blend of sauces can just remind you the feel of heaven!

Have eaten Chowman food several times, but am reviewing for the first time.
Ordered home delivery of Drums of Heaven, Tofu in Black Bean Sauce and Wok Tossed Hakka Noodles Pork. The portions were generous and the delivery timely and cheerfully handed over.
The Drums of Heaven were indeed initially heavenly as also the other items till I got my little shock. Apart from the Tofu, the two other dishes were generously laced with Star Ainse, which you either like or you don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt and certainly not in the quantity present. The first photo shows only a portion, the balance remaining with the leftovers in the fridge, which I shall have to dig and take out,¬†before finishing.
Star Ainse reminds me of nutmeg and I think of it as an appetite depressant.
I have never before come across this ingredient in such quantity, hard and very piquant if you bite on it. Removing it hastily from the mouth is not the way one wants to eat, and removing it by searching before beginning is off-putting.
Let those who like Star Ainse eat it. I suspect many would like to be spared.
I pined instead for bamboo shoots, which I rarely find anywhere these days.
Despite memories of past very good Chowman meals, for the present one I cannot give more than 3.

If there is any rating below this, I would give this place that. Awful service to begin with. They were in so much of hurry to get rid of us that we were wondering that that why we came here at first place. Food is okay. Chilly pork is a must try, although you can skip this place at all costs and head towards another Chinese eatery.
They gave us a wrong bill. After telling them they made corrections on the same bill twice but when asked for a new bill, they were unable to do so and gave a bullshit excuse to do so.
The icing on the cake was giving us a Mio-amore brownie along with one small scoop of ice-cream and charging us 220 bucks + taxes for that.
Awful!

I usually visit the outlet near the Salt Lake Swimming Pool. I love the food over here. They have struck a perfect balance between the authenticticity of the Chinese preparations and the right amount of twist to make it palatable to us Kolkatans. Some of may favourites are as follows:

1. Salt and Pepper prawn: Mildly spicy, perfectly seasoned, with a subtle garlic taste. It's lovely
2. Lobster: They take all the meat out and cook them into mildly crispy tender balls of lobster. The sauce leaves a pleasant tangy aftertaste. The lobster shell is preserved perfectly and served with your food, so the presentation is amazing.
3. Roasted chilli pork: Just the right amount of crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, bathed in a mildly spicy chilli sauce. My favourite starter at this restaurant.
4. Mixed Fried Rice: The superiority of this dish lies in its simplicity. They haven't tried to do too much, simply stuck to the basics and let the ingredients bring out their natural flavours. Amazingly good.
5. Mixed meifoon: A change of taste from your regular hakka noodles, these rice noodles are finer and simply melt in your mouth. Preparation is pretty good, but should be just a little less oily to be amazing (in my humble opinion).
6. Lamb in Oyster sauce: Any kind of meat in Oyster sauce tastes good to me. But what makes this dish so special is the fine slicing of the pieces of lamb which totally soak up the amazing Oyster sauce flavour and melt in your mouth. The little mushroom slices also taste good. The gravy is mild and slightly sweet.

I should mention a few cons about this restaurant (not with the food, but with the service).

What I love about this restaurant is it is one of the few Chinese/Asian restaurants in Kolkata that provide chopsticks on the table (as well as disposable chopsticks if you order takeout), and it is always fun to have Asian food with chopsticks. What I don't understand is why the waiters keep coming to your table and asking you whether they may remove the chopsticks from the table. I mean if you want to remove them, why put them there in the first place?

Also, for some reason they are always very late in serving you your drinks. If you order a soft drink, you will probably get served some time after you are done with your soup and starters or half-way through main course. In fact, there was one time I was served my drink after my meal was over!

However, the lapses in service are easily overcome by the taste and quality of the food over here. Prices are pretty affordable too. Chowman is currently my favourite Chinese restaurant in Kolkata.

I have visited chowman but this time I ordered from zomato and gave instructions of less spicy but the food was spicy as hell.  Just utter disgusting . Just ridiculous.  Just felt as if my instruction was not forwarded at all.

Chowman is Chinese served to perfection... I am fond of their interiors.. specially the part with the Buddha..we ordered mixed meifoon, prawn Singapore noodles, fish chilly and prawns in hot garlic sauce... The portions were good enough and the taste was satisfying.. it's a paradise for Chinese lovers and I intend to pay many more such visits.

Went to chowman based on the reviews from zomato had the most disappointment evening...
We ordered for sea food meifoon..that's basically is rice noodles which should have consisted of shrimp , squid and crab meat but unfortunately we did not find any crab meat ...the order taker said it must have melted with the rice ...he thought we are idiots as he is the one who knows about sea food...Ok...agreed....then we found there was fragmented fried egg which was not supposed to be the part of any sea food ...while raised the innocent query he said ...he forgot to mention that....it was a complete mismatch with the GLORIOUS menu book....oh yes...just to add ...we also ordered chicken tai pai...it was also not ready....Hence we were bound to go for another option
GREAT......I hope debaditya is listening
Long live lakkhaichara...but chowman...I doubt if they run in this way

The starters were not so drooling 
For a change we ordered baby corn with honey which was super sweet.
Then we ordered tofu which was supposed to be spicy but was not that satisfactory.
Coming to the main course we ordered shanghai noodles and chilli garlic noodles. 
Both were perfectly cooked and spicy.

The food was excellent, I dare say among the best Chinese I have had. The ambiance, delightful. The price, far less than any other restaurant of similar stature.
We ordered the lamb in oyester sauce, and the honey chilli pork, the lamb was soft juicy and the gravy busting with flavours, the pork was a bit bland though, and since all 4 of us have huge apetites, we had to get another entr√©e so we chose the chowman's special chicken, which was wonderfully cooked. For the main course, we chose the shanghai noodles and the chowman's special. For rice, we decided to go with the chicken fried rice.
Overall it was a very satisfactiory experience, and I would encourage anyone to try out their food.

Sorry to say that the quality is degrading day by day.  The pork item is beyond my minimum expectation. Over coocked and juicy nature of meat was gone and even charred. Professionalism is lacking. Before visiting the place I called and specifically asked for the availability of Sizzling Chocolate Browny, and they assured me. At the restaurant they told me it is not available instead I was given a hot browny with chocolate sauce, which is basically a choco lava cake with almond chips and a scoop of ice-cream. They redefined the concept of browny in their own way. Terribly disappointing. It was one of favourite restaurant now I have to rethink whether I would like go their at all.

Absolutely pathetic food. As an amateur chef, even I cook better than this. This restaurant has no clue about flavour. The only thing their food tasted was spicy. We faced a stomach ache for almost 24 hours after eating here. 

Service is poor as well. With little to no regard for their customers throughout the course of the meal. 

You‚Äôre better off starving than having lunch here.

We ordered food from Chowman for 8 people as take away. The bill amount was Rs 2381 including tax which is not very cheap but yes for a branded outlet it was OK. However, the quality wasn‚Äôt upto the brand‚Äôs level hence it appeared to be unworthy of the price. Our ordered items 

Mixed Hakka Noodles 
Chilli Garlic Noodles chicken
Mixed Meifoon
Mixed Meifoon in Thai style 
Shrimp schezwan noodles 
Pan fried chilli fish
Pan fried chilli chicken 
Pepper Garlic chicken 
Chilli Chicken gravy 

The food was only average and as mentioned not up to CHOWMAN level. Szwn Noodles were broken into small pieces as it was quite wet and tasteless . Meifoon again was too oily and all stuck together like lumps. Fish & chicken was OK.

Even the person taking order over the phone was not quite responsive. Delivery was as per request and before promised time. My rating break up below.

Food Taste : 2.5/5 
Quantity: 4/5
Quality: 3/5
Delivery: 5/5
Customer Service 3.5/5
Packing:3.5/5 (some containers were not even properly closed)

Not a happy customer this time. Will rethink a lit before ordering atleast from the Salt Lake branch.

From the time I entered till I didn't decide to leave, I faced arrogance and bad attitude from their staff. 

While the full restaurant was empty for lunch on Wednesday (2 tables occupied), we requested to be seated in a bigger table as we wanted to order alot of food and try this outlet (as we frequently eat from the Ballygunje outlet). To which a gentleman with the name of Anandi Sahu arrogantly refused our requested with a rude tone which felt humiliating. 
He went on to say bluntly too bad even though the restaurant is empty I won't let you sit there. 

Such bad attitude from staff of a good renowned restaurant is not expected. 

Strongly recommend him to be taught courtesy and strongly recommend noone to visit this outelt.

The waiter who took the food order could not even confirm if it can be made to our preference.

Very bad experience and had to leave the restaurant without further time wastage. 

In asking Anandi his name he refused to write it and give it and said why should I tell you my name. Finally somehow we managed to get his name. 

Harassment and worst experience at Chowman.

Pretty bad experience just now@chowman salt lake. We ordered quite a few number of items as takeway order . Requested to divide one garlic chicken into two containers ( we were ready to pay extra for container ) but the person at the entrance ( with moustache and spects ) denied roughly , we requested to divide it into 6 pieces each into two containers (total 12 pieces ) but I am quite stunned by the stubbornness of the person . Also when I asked for fork and spoon that person replied that due to puja rush  there are no spoon  and fork ! Iave been here quite a few times and had pretty good experiences regarding food . But after this I will think twice while visiting this restaurant.

One of the greatest food experiences I have had in the past 12 months. Simply memorable. Even the service was top notch. We ordered a prawn item as a starter. A lot of places, starter simply implies something fried but not filling so one craves more food. But here it wasn't the case, instead it was sumptuous. We followed that up with the soup and then of course the main meal. The brilliant part is that each item looked and tasted different. There was no dressing up with the same gravy as a lot of places tend to do.¬†A must try.

Been there for the first time only yesterday. Every dish carried a distinct taste. We ordered quite a lot including Thai soup, lung Fung or chicken soup, Thai fried rice, Cantonese noodles etc. What we are all still gushing about is the garlic butter fish. It's a must try if you are  up for trying something exotic and subtle with your regular bhetki or basa. Thai soup was spicy and a bit saucy but chicken soup was an absolute comforter. I liked their fish preparations more than chicken, that's because I'm mostly fond of the former. Must mention the chinese-budhist decor which adds to the goodness of the ambience. All in all, a great gorging experience. And most importantly , easy on the pocket too and sumptuous. We ordered almost 8dishes for 6 of us.  Pinch on the wallet was 2500(with GST).

Whenever I am in Calcutta,  I visit this place at least once. An added bonus is the fact that this place is at a stone's throwaway from my residence.
Interiors are done nicely. Though be prepared for long queues if you are visiting during Dusherra etc.
Coming to the food, the quantities are generous. All its dishes are a treat for the taste buds - specially the pork dishes. The Orange Schezwan Pork and the Chilli Fried Pork tops the list. Overall a good experience.

For the main course we ordered szechwan chicken fried rice and lamb in hunan sauce. Ambience is pretty good. Staffs are very well behaved and efficient. Could have given 5 rating but had to wait a long time before we could get a table. If you are in sector 1 area, go for this restaurant you wont be dissapointed.

Firstly we didnt have to wait much and got seats without any issues.
We ordered Hot and Sour soup,Kung pao chicken dry ,Chowman's special noodles.
All the item was so tasty (only felt mushroom in noodles was not that good) that for sure u will plan for next time visit. Along with quality they maintain good quantity also. 

And the same time they provide best service and informing us with the information about the dish without even asking. Loved this place and
definitely will visit soon to taste their Fish varieties.

I was looking forward to this for so long after hearing all the craze about it. It was a beautiful ambience but the tables placed so close to each other, that you can almost hear the other table's whisper. Food was nothing extra ordinary compared to the 'Calcutta' standards. Its was good/average. The most funny part was that Pork ribs were not ribs! They were some boneless fat (not from the ribs) and maybe 1/5th of the portion had rib meat. It was not only disappointing, but a complete flop. I wonder what people love so much about this place. Certainly over hyped.

Dry Tai Chin Chicken - Chicken tossed with Dry Red Chillies & Bell Pepper with Five Spice Flavour.¬†
Chicken Chilli Wine - This was a awesome side dish. Really loved it.
Mixed Fried Rice - I am fan of Mainland China for its simplistic Fried Rice, but after that Chowman is just the place.
Darsan - Nothing to say about this explicitly, hope there was ice cream with this but there is always a next time ;)

This is a late review as I went there for atleast a month ago with my friends, but I just had to write a review on Chowman.This is probably one of the best Chinese restaurant in kolkata. I have visited this place twice and planning to go there sometime soon again.
The ambience is classy and elegant,but the staffs seemed in hurry as they had to close the kitchen at 4p.m.
Now everything can be forgiven if the food is delicious.
We ordered Mixed fried rice,Chicken hakka noodles,Chilli Pork and Garlic Chicken.
Every single dish was really really good,especially The garlic chicken.
I'm going to visit this restaurant only for their garlic chicken.
Maybe a little costly but the quantity is enough for 2-3people.
Give this place a try and you're not gonna regret it. :)

LOCATION: Situated near salt lake swimming pool it is very easy to locate. One may miss a glimpse of the signage which is painted in bright red with Chinese lanterns hanging around but it can be navigated quite easily due to the persistent crowd of people lining up to grab a table.
AMBIENCE: The place is done in the shades of black & red with occasional touches of gold. Chopsticks are now placed at every table & is very much a welcome addition.
SERVICE: It is okay but the staff seemed quite in a hurry to pack us off so that can make space for the huge crowd jostling outside to get a table.
MENU: It covers various kinds of Oriental dishes with also some thai available. The dessert sections needs to be more creative though.
FOOD: The roasted mandarin chicken was sliced of roast chicken & shitake mushroom in an onion based gravy. The mixed schezuan Hakka noodles were first hot & spicy & was tantalizing for the taste buds. The Hong Kong chicken was quite mildly spicy with the gravy having a sweet nutty flavour to it. The darshan with ice cream was great as the darsan was crispy & hot drizzled in honey with sprinklings of sesame on top which provided a crunchiness which perfectly complemented the creaminess of the ice cream.

Located in saltlake sec1 a great place for authentic Chinese food. We have ordered
starter- chicken Manchow soup, Double fried chilli fish, Drums of heaven.
Main course- Mixed meifoon and General tao's chicken
Desert- Tuti fruti and hot chocolate brownie.
I would like to recommend you ta drums of heaven and meifoon and the brownie also. I didn't like the chilli fish starter, and the tuti fruti contains too much fruit more than ice cream other wise it was delicious.

This was a very bad quality food prepared by chowman. I knew chowman for a long time but never had such bad experience the chicken fried rice was just plain rice without any kind of preparation done with it. it was dry very dry and the accompanied chilli chicken was mentioned as gravy but they gave dry the pieces were very small. How on earth does someone have dry chilli chicken with Dryer un-fried rice.


I am totally pissed with the order never going to order from Chowman and that too shall share this review

I have been a frequent visitor of this place. This is one of the restaurants which is an all time yes for me. Let me break it down in detail:
1. Ambience: Themed as per its cuisine, Chowman has a very peaceful and serene setup. For me, its a 9/10

2. Service: Professional attendants, chefs and managers, together they deliver a service worth an applaud. 9/10

3. Food: Authentic chinese food. The seafood and the Pork is worth a try. The Chowman special noodles is their signature dish. This time I ordered Chilli Pork, Stir fried seafood noodles and hot garlic chicken. And everything was a treat for the tastebuds.

4. Value For Money: The pricing is done little higher than market standards but the quantity is more than other restaurants so, I can give a 7.5/10

Overall, its a yes for me and a must go. Great going Chowman.

Main - Mixed fried rice, sweet & sour prawn, chilli garlic chicken with red pepper

Food was tastey. The quantity was adequate. Only let down was the prawn as coating was more. Staffs are really helpful and provide good advise on what to order though we overruled them considering my daughter's taste bud.

For 4 people they gave the table the size of which is so small that every moment we need to very carefull about plate and glass. It should  be comfortable  enough  so that people  enjoy their food.

Even though located at a very good place, I wish I could say the same about their Jumbo Prawns in Pepper Garlic Sauce. It was suggested to us by the man who took our order as their signature dish. But the experience was not at all satisfying. The prawns were dipped in cornflour with very little or no flavour or taste of prawn at all. The garnishing was really pleasant but the taste was not good. We did try another starter Green and Red Pepper Chicken which was much, much better than the prawns. We ordered Mixed Fried Rice and Five Spice Lamb for the main course. There was very little amount of shredded chicken or prawns in the rice, instead it was full of spring onions, though the taste was not bad. On the other hand, the Lamb had a succulent taste, the strong flavours of the spices had an overpowering effect in the mouth.
The ambiance was really good with soft music. Overall it was an average experience.

Nice decor, family-friendly, excellent choice of items and easy access all work to make this restaurant a popular place for folks to satisfy their craving for Chinese food, which may be the most popular cuisine for Indians who eat out. The popularity results in a rather noisy atmosphere, and the food tends to be rather heavy with sauces, although quite tasty.

Eve was of 15th Aug that too working in office.
As of the food joints were very busy,hence tried this restaurant which is quite far from UNITECH.
But if the delivery amount is good ,they dnt mind delivering that far.
We ordered veg rice, shrimp rice,mixed rice, tofu in bean sauce, double fried lamb,garlic chicken and few other veg preparation which I dnt remember.
The impressive poi ta were,they were bang on time, the food was hot and properly packed. The food was very taste and in proper quantity.
Maybe a little costly on the Pockets but very good Chinese and I will recommend to try the double fried lamb...just amazing.

From food quality to ambience, from service to decorations..everything is PERFECT to the 'T'.
We had ordered pan fried chilli fish and mushroom salt n pepper as starters, and then went on to have burnt garlic rice and hunan chicken in the main course. Oh my god! The fish was so delicious. The burnt garlic rice was the best in its class. We were super full at end, but, I really wish we could try out some other dishes. Next time, definitely.
   Even the choco brownie with vanilla ice cream that we had for dessert was great. So as I said, the overall quality and quantity was perfect. Not to mention, the price is also reasonable.
    We had to wait for 20 mins before we got a table..but the wait was worth it. üòä

Definitely one of the best places to have chinese food when you are at Kolkata. Starting from the decor, service, atmosphere to the food itself I was completely blown away. The food is reasonably priced so you won't have a fear of burning a hole in your pocket. The staff here was more than courteous to suggest what to have. Would love to recommend some of the must haves when you are here. Try the pan fried fish, fried squid in oyster sauce,Krispy konjee baby lamb. Please go visit ASAP.

Happy dining !!

This place is in salt lake swimming pool area. The interiors and the ambiance are really great and truly a family outing joint. The hospitality and service quality of staff are great. Now let's  ome to the menu options....there is a lot of variety in the selection but show I felt that the items are more indian is ed version Od chinese cuisine@ and lacks imagination or uniqueness. We ordered wok tossed noodles and munchurian chicken . The quality and quantity were too good and we really enjoyed the food. Pocket pinch...not much as compared to the quantity they serve. Overall a very nice place for family dinners and will recommend to all to visit at least once. Giving 4.5 because I expected uniqueness in the menu.

Yesterday, 9th of August, 2017, I have ordered three dishes from Chowman sector 1 outlet through home delivery. I am a regular  customer of this outlet and I like their food always. But It's very much dissapointing to share my experience of yesterday's. I found a worm in one of the dishes (rice noodles) ordered by me. It was almost 12 o clock night so we couldn't  make a call to the outlet. It is not at all accepted that a reputed restaurant like Chowman is not maintaining the simple food hygiene. Seriously  I am very much dissatisfied. Also attached the picture of worm inside the rice noodles.

Located at BF block the restaurant is somehow the most happening ala carte since the day it has been inaugurated.
I visited countless number of times and I will keep visiting till I have tasted all the dishes. The ambience is calm added on with the soft tunes played,gives u a monastery feel. The food is simply wow. My all time favorites would be crispy baby corn,Hunan chicken,schezwan fried rice, chicken in oyestor sauce and lemon fish.
While I am putting the review I can still feel the taste of the delicacies.

Right at the heart of Salt Lake, Chowman serves the delicious Chinese food that no one can account for any hate. The Staffs are well Taught and have a decent sense about the Menu. Their recommendations are top notch, time taken can be improved by some subtle changes. The best time to visit in weekend is just between 7 to 7:30, anyone coming after that would have to wait up in a long line as Chowman doesn't have the facility to book a table. 
Tha ambiance is quite good with just enough decorating to see each other and the food but not to blind some one away. Most importantly the expenses is quite reasonable and is fully in the worth of the food being served.

Went for a family lunch after hearing so much about it from my friends. The place was full, so had to wait for around 15 minutes for a table of 5. The restaurant is not very big with the tables set quite close to each other.
We were in a hurry and hence did not order many items. But I was impressed with whatever we had. The crispy chilly babycorn was good and the pepper chicken was delicious. Both veg fried rice and mixed fried rice were according to my taste - not too oily and not too salty. Chilli pork was good, although I personally prefer a little fat with my pork, and not just the red meat. My mother-in-law being a vegetarian, the waiter had recommended exotic vegetables in basil sauce. However, my sasu did not like it as the smell of the basil was too strong! And oh, the quantity is worth mentioning! 2 plates of rice were sufficient for 5 people :)
Overall, a good dining experience. I would definitely like to visit again!

Sorry I will have to edit the review after 2nd visit.
The best thing about this restaurant is its look, feel and decoration and the worst thing about this place is food. Its 2 times in a row I was served with rotten food. Previously there was a smell in chicken preparation. They changed it though after complaining. 2 nd time the mushroom was rotten and I was about to throw up as soon it fell in my mouth. As it was a mixed fried rice I simply opted to put aside remaining pieces of mushrooms rather than complaining. We ordered drunken chicken and chicken in chilli wine and they were also not tasteful at all.

Food-2/5
Ambience-3/5

My all time favourite authentic Chinese restaurant. If you want to get a very authentic taste of the Chinese cuisine, it is it. It's ambience is quite soothing. It will calm down your mind. Buddha collection is just awesome. Now coming back to the food, I ordered 2 soups, 2 starter and a dessert. Soup and starter's are very authentic as I said earlier but the dessert was out of world. It was walnut vanilla ice cream. A simple vanilla ice cream with walnuts roasted with honey. It's just like heaven to me. I would like to suggest every one to taste it.

Have been visiting this outlet since it opened in salt lake but rarely reviewed it in zomato. Being a frequent customer i visit chowman every now and then for any occasion. their authentic chinese food attracts me. i have tasted their starters,soups,noodles,fried rice, non-veg gravy items. crispy konjee lamb, smoked pork,chicken lat me kai is my all time favourite. they also charge pretty reasonably ¬†without burning a hole in your pocket. the service and ambience is quiet upto the mark!! happy dining!!

The occasion was special.. It was a treat from my research guide.. A much awaited treat.. So after a day of hard work in the laboratory, me along with my labmates n guide reached the saltlake branch of Chowman in the evening.. I've got to mention that this was my first visit after been subject to positive vibes about this place from many sources.. So my excitement knew no bounds when i stepped in to a warm welcome by the manager who kindly requested us to have our seats in the waiting arena as they had to relocate the tables since we were 8 of us.. But what was striking was the ambience.. the fragrance all around was soothing n was punched with flavours of China all around with chinese bells n paintings on the wall which were highlighted by dim lights.. Soft chinese music went well with the ambience.. the waiters were smart n well dressed n pretty polite in interactive phases.. The menu card, well well well, i have visited very few restaurants providing such wide variety n range of rich chinese delicacies.. We ordered Green n red pepper chicken which had a unique taste of lemon, green leaves n pepper, along with Chicken in banana leaf with peanut sauce, which according to me is one of the better starters i have ever tasted.. For the main course we ordered Chicken Schezwan, Chilli Garlic, Shanghai Fried Rice, Chicken Singapore Hakka Noodles, Kung Pao Chicken, Tsing hoi Chicken n Roasted Lamb in Oyster Sauce.. The Fried rices had authentic chinese taste n would suit idealy for the ones having a knack for spicy items.. The boneless chicken pieces of Kung Pao chicken were soft n juicy n the tsing hoi chicken with its subtle sweet taste n with presence cashews is recommended for infants or ones loving non spicy foods.. The service here is really upto the mark n the food is value for money.. This makes a visit to chowman worth of spending a beautiful evening..

Well i have visited this outlet twice and both times the food didnt dissapoint me. We ordered Hakka noodles...chilli garlic noodles..manchurian..american corn pepper salt and even tried crispy chilly american corn. Well everything tasted good except the veg manchurian. It could have been better.
Well my only concern is the service which is very very slow. I guess they take time to serve vegetarian fare as we noticed that even late occupancy were served very promptly. They should look into this.
Otherwise a great place to try out chinese food and great ambience too.

I love the seafood fried rice. The crab meat fried rice is good too.
Do try the konjee crispy lamb for starters. 4/5
The double fried lamb is a total winner too. 5/5
We also tried the roasted schezwan orange pork which was a nice tangy twist to the normal roasted pork. Nice innovation. I'd give it a 3.5/5
Ambience 3.5/5
Overall 4/5

If you want to taste some authentic and good chinese delicacies then you need to visit this place. So good hospitality and the ambience is that it will be hard for you to understand that you have been here for so long. The pork starters and the manchow soup is what you can look forward to. And the quality is as well worth mentioning.

Chowman's been a favourite since the day it opened in salt lake.the last two visits were satiating as ever.beautiful decor, polite n courteous staff n awesome food n large portion size..definitely a plus point.we had squids n chilly shrimps, drums of heaven, crab meat rice, burnt garlic rice with egg,chicken in wine,honey fried wantons, roasted lamb, pork with orange n schezwan sauce..yeah yeah we got carried away..happens at chowman..we also had tutti frutti, icecream with toasted walnuts, brownie with hot chocolate sauce..we really missed not getting strawberries n icecream..something the procuring team has to look into.the only nag is the unisex small bathroom, constraint of space they said, maybe they should've reduced the covers n included another stall.getting back to the food, variety is the winning mantra here.you have enough of the traditional indian chinese to keep the conservatives happy.u also have enough cosmopolitan chinese.never really get tired of chowman food.am sure to visit or order again

Wowman!
The very entry to this place was exotic. As we passed through the doors guarded by a pair of lion-statues, it seemed time froze and we were travelling to the times of some dragon emperor... The decor was pristine and primitive as the ethnicity and culture of China seemed to come alive with antique looking curios on walls, stone Buddhas and Bells all around the red-black decor. The service included warm courtesy, detailed attention, expert handling along with an honest briefing up of the preparation of the dishes to be ordered and finally guiding us well so that we could finally decide over the menu for our Sunday dinner with Chicken Satay in peanut sauce, Hunan fish, Kungpao chicken in wine sauce, Basil Veg Fried Rice and Shanghai Style Veg Meiffoon. We went heads over heels not only over the taste but also over the magnanimous proportions of food that we found difficult to finish without coke. We were too full for desserts which gives us another happy reason to visit there again....

One of the best Chinese crusin in town when it comes to food quality and quantity both. The interior is very pleasing. It's a very busy restaurant I must say. According they charge pretty reasonably. Thought I personally didn't like one of the Waiter's attitude since we were taking a bit long time to order our dinner God knows what picture of us did he drew if us. But apart from that my experience in chowman is really good

While billing, they took the charge for ice cream too, when I asked them why they charged for ice cream when we didn't have it, they said that darshan comes with ice cream. My point is they could inform me about that before taking the order. A lil disappointed. Anyway, the restaurant is not very spacious. Food quality is okay types, can be better.

The restaurant looks amazing and the service is amazing. Food is more expensive than any average restaurant but it's worth it as the food they serve cannot be got at any of the average restaurants. You will love the environment and the importance they give to decoration. Overall a middle class family can afford this restaurant and can have something new on their plates rather than the old fried rice, nan and chicken.

Went to this place with my husband on 29th May on my birthday, so this is a late review. I had tried there food from delivery before but this was the first time I went there. The overall look and feel was good. Subtle hint of Chinese decor with dim lighting.

First we ordered Chicken Sui Mai but was informed by the waiter that it will take a lot of time to make, but then he can running back form the kitchen with the good news that it will be done in a lot less time. I was certainly good news for me as I was really looking forward to trying this. And yes, we loved it. Then we ordered crab fried rice and orange roasted lamb. The tests were subtle and quite good. Not too over powering, specially the crab rice. For dessert we ordered Darshan with Ice Cream and we loved it as well. I specially liked the hint of salted butter with syrupy crispy fried flat noodles.

I would also like to mention that the servers were very well mannered and attentive. Moreover we had an amazing experience and I am looking forward to go back there again...

Service is pathetic compared to other Chowman branches. 
They are known for good quality food once, hence I gave it a try dining and home delivery . Ordered home delivery a 5-6 times but today they said you need to order food for minimum for ‚Çπ2000. But they were considering it to ‚Çπ1500 since we had previously ordered and they had no such clauses. The order I was placing was coming to ‚Çπ1365 but they refused to deliver it even though they have ordered in the same address for lesser bill amount. We were ordering for 2 people and the order was already too much for us. But they dint budge saying they have changed the policy. So the service is definitely worse. 
For the last order I had specified that I don't want the flattened prawn in my order and the person assured me of it. When the order arrived it was the same flattened prawn. When I called back the restaurant they dint even apologise for the mistake. 
But I will never order or recommend this restaurant. Service is so sad that please think twice before spending any money there at all.

Chowman is probably one of the most consistent outlet in terms of food quality. Whichever outlet I visit, this place never lets me down. Went here for lunch on Saturday. Despite of being very crowded, the service was prompt. Waiters are very helpful. For a group of 6 people, we ordered double fried fish, pepper garlic chicken, burnt garlic coriander rice, pan fried noodles, fish in chilli wine sauce, hot pot hunan style chicken and chicken with cashew nut and dried chilli. The cashew nut chicken was not that good. Except that, everything was mind blowing.

I love dining out at Chowman, my fav dishes are : Moon Fan Fried Rice (The prawns are awesome in the rice and the size of those are the biggest also most succulent I've eaten anywhere else), and Butter Garlic Fish (They use Basa fish, and the hint of butter and burnt Garlic over the fish is divine). I am looking forward to try out their Lobster dish, will share the experience of that later on :)

I love the food of chowman very much, but there's one problem with the home delivery option, they should not be calling it home delivery if they can't deliver food from saltlake sector 1 to Newtown, that's far distance they say. And even the zomato online food delivery system didn't work, this is very bad for foodies who lives in Newtown and decides to have some good Chinese food.

The food was decent. Nothing extravagant to make you go crazy. But a must try.

I can safely say that chowman has the fastest service... We ordered pepper garlic chicken for starters and hakka noodles and kung pao chicken for the mains... Our appetite was fulfilled to its epitome with a marvellous hot brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert... Loved the ambience... Would visit again definitely

Well this place have one of the best chinese dishes in the city. This place is located in sector 1 salt lake in the BF block.. it's nearest land marks are Santa's fantasea and sharma tea. The ambience is beautiful and serves quickly. The restaurant serves delicious chinese foods among which roasted chilli pork is it's signature  dish. The price is a little high but still it's okay. @ So if you are a chinese lover this place is definitely for you.

All the marks goes to the decoration and hospitality. Expected some mouth watering food but alas I was disappointed. The lamb starter was awful, the rest two orders were ginger pork and chicken hakka noddles. The pork was average, the hakka noddles was good.
Ps- the pork dish contained chicken into it along with pork and we didn't complain as free main chicken khana is always relishing. 

Overall, I had a bad lunch.

I order from chowman for the very first time and it was not up to the mark. I ordered just one serving of schezwan style meifoon and it pretty much disappointed me. It was oily but that is still acceptable to a certain degree but finding stones in your food is not. It just makes me think about the hygiene level of the restaurant. I would be very cautious if I have to order or visit the restaurant.

Chowman is my go-to place for Chinese in Salt Lake. The ambiance is very peaceful. I have always had a delightful experience with them be it ordering food, asking for suggestions, getting ¬†food served or home delivered. You can always stick to the basics here as well as explore their duck specials(it is not a regular item, have had it only once).¬†
I have tried most from the menu, my all time favourite being Crab meat/Chicken Lemon Coriander ¬†soup, Chicken Basil Rice and Kung Pao Chicken. Every item is tasty and light at the same time.

I have been looking for an opportunity to dine in this restaurant serving Chinese and seafood since I heard that the food was good. 
Recently  I ordered chicken hakka noodles, fish in oyster sauce and chicken in hot garlic sauce. The food was below average. It wasn't really satisfactory, I'm extremely dissapointed with the food.

Chicken Hakka noodles: The taste was very average. The veges were raw and not even boiled, were large sized which wasn't a good feeling. Its didn't taste well at all.
Fish in oyster sauce: In simple word please stop serving this dish. It was extremely sweet. I have tried Oyster fish many a times but this was disgusting. Though the fish was well cooked.
Chicken in hot garlic sauce: This was the only dish which was good. I liked this alot. It was spicy, well cooked.
However my all over experience was bad. Their packing was good. It was a costly experiment. On the basis of the quality of food they served it was overpriced. Highly disspointed with their food quality .
Try their food if you want to drain your money!

I have been to many restaurants including many outlets of chowman but this one is my favourite. The very first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the name " chowman" is chinese cuisine.  I am a big fan of your food. Food is no doubt delicious. It tickles your taste buds. If you ask my favourite there i would say devils‚Äã chicken. No matter how many times i eat but i still love it. But please keep a hankey beside you , because you may get tears eating it. Infact i am not trying to exgravvate but devils chicken there  is my favourite in all over Kolkata. Its all about when i hear the word " chowman" . But when you enter chowman , if you are going there first time ,you might get taken by its decor. Decor is dark , lights are dim accompanied with background chinese music but it is so perfectly maintained that rather looking depressed it seems quite lavish. Not to overlook staffs, they work superb . The manager always comes to your table to take feedbacks from you personally about the food and ask for improvement scope which is quite enthusiastic and waiters are on their heels every time when i see them. Sorry I can't tell anything about dessert because whenever i go i shamelessly eat upto my mouth. I don't have any space for desert. If you are one of the peri peri maniac you would love this place. There is a lot of variety to tickle your mood and fill your desires. The restaurant offers you a variety when it comes to sea food . It won't be wrong to say sea food is one of their speciality. I would say please have a visit. You will surely love it!

I visited this outlet of chowman a couple of days back with my friends,as I had heard a lot about it's delicious Chinese food and its ambience. The ambience sure was great enough,but the food wasn't that good as other people applauded it. For the main course we'd ordered mixed moon fan fried rice which wasn't up to the mark and also the american chop suey's gravy was very sweet while we had asked it to be medium spicy. Rest all the dishes were finger licking good. The service was pretty quick and the staff extremely courteous.

Ah, this place. ‚ù§ Whenever a big adventurous day is planned, a huge argument follows over where to go for lunch. After a day of restaurant hopping and finding new places on Zomato, Chowman is the safe back-up plan. Food is filling and service is good. A little pricey, but good worth for quality and quantity. I love the varieties of mouth fresheners with the cheque.

After visiting the Behala outlet, we are chanced upon visiting the Saltlake outlet of Chowman. Once more, this Chinese food chain stole our heart. The decor and food, both are major plus points of Chowman. The hospitality is also notable. We ordered pepper garlic chicken and double cooked crispy chili fish as starters. Both were superbly yummy. For main course, we tried Singapore noodles, hotpot human chicken with shiitake mushroom and steamed crab in ginger wine sauce. All the items were made to perfection. For us, Chowman is now synonymous to utter satisfaction.

I had visited Chowman on Bengali New Year and I was bowled over by the quality of food. The food was just delicious. The Kung Pao prawn and the chicken sczehwan fried rice in the main course were the highlights. Each of the dishes had good portions that were available at an affordable price. Also the decor of the restaurant was eye pleasing.

Well, my stint with Chowman, Sector 1 begun 2-3 years back on my 1st visit to them ‚Äì a dine-in. And today, ordered an office delivery from them. Considering the bulk order, they did take some time to deliver ‚Äì which is justified. The following veg items were tasted by the tongue:-

(i)	Veg Shanghai Noodles - superb ‚Äì slim noodles with decent vegetable mix (babycorns, onions, capsicums ‚Äì yellow and green, spring onions and what not!)

(ii)	Ginger Capsicum Flavoured Rice - Fine, not great though ‚Äì also contained decent boiled vegetable content.

(iii)	Veg Coin in soya sauce gravy ‚Äì more popularly known as Manchurian - Pretty tasty, great on quantity as well ‚Äì a very balanced gravy preparation ‚Äì and full marks for food presentation.

Packing as well as quantity served is fine and prices are somewhat high ‚Äì which is still justified.

Overall, a good experience and a RECOMMENDATION.

Over priced bad food. Ordered - egg chow gravy, pan fried chicken. Chow looks pretty so is the chicken. I think that's not the point. Chow was very bland. When I am mixing chow with gravy, it's not mixing. Seems like I am eating separate chow and gravy. And chicken, after eating 1 or 2 piece, I had to give it away.

I would say chowman serves the best Chinese, oriental dishes in Calcutta. You'll love the ambience too. 
I went there with my family today for lunch.
We had ordered:
 shredded lamb soup with celery and mushrooms- loved the taste totally! Fresh celery takes the soup to another level.
For the starters we ordered mushroom pepper salt and barbeque chicken, personally I loved the mushroom pepper salt more. It was crunchy and fresh.
For the main course , we had ordered chilly garlic prawn noodles, wok tossed veg Hakka noodles, jumbo prawn in chilli wine sauce and five spice lamb.
The jumbo prawn undoubtedly stole the show. The way it was served and the taste was perfect. 
We liked the taste of lamb and fresh spices used in it.


I can go back anytime again for the mushroom pepper salt. The taste has stayed back in my the memory.

Overall we had a great food experience with great hospitality. :)

This is undoubtedly one of the best establishments in the city to serve Chinese food. I have had a lot of discussions with friends about how Chinese cuisine in Kolkata differs from the same in any other city. I have been told that real Chinese food is kind of bland, lacking spices. But I cannot tell about the taste or the flavour. A lot of culinary arts in Kolkata originated elsewhere and found a different shape in the city. Take for example the Arsalan biryani. To put a potato in biryani in any of the cities of the Nawabs is considered blasphemy. But this is the only biryani we love. I have been to Hyderabad and Lucknow. But I will come to Lucknow biryani when I am talking about Oudh 1590.¬†

Chowman‚Äôs quality of food surpasses that from any other Chinese restaurants by far. And it is not only about the food. If you order from home, they will provide some beautiful chopsticks and a variety of sauces in small tubes. 

And their food is awesome. The last two times I threw my birthday party in office, I ordered food from here. I will just list a few of their dishes I just love ‚Äì Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Lemon Coriander Thick Soup, Roasted Chili Pork, Double Fried Pork, the Meifoon noodles, the gravies‚Ä¶let me just stop here. I love all their dishes that I have had. There is not a single dish that I can say that I was not satisfied with. I will post photos as soon as I get the next chance. I regret no having taken photos earlier, but I was not carrying my camera. And I will add more to this. Please enjoy your food at this excellent place and keep watching this space.

13 May, 2017: Here are pictures of Mixed Fried Rice and Chicken Chilli Wine. The pics did not come as well as I intended. Next time I will post better ones.

25 May, 2017: Today's order was Chicken Meifoon, Mixed Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, and Sliced Chicken with Veg (forgot the actual name). Yummy! Pictures from 3 through 6.

Dear Friends,

I have been ordering food from Chowman regularly and had been their loyal customer since many many months/years and never given anything less than
5 Stars for the quality of food they used to serve. 
In fact I advised and recommended my family members and many friends to order food from them.

But let me tell you, today just an hour back I had ordered food and due to the very very poor quality and quantity of food I received from them I wanted to share a serious feedback. 

I had ordered two plates of Pepper Garlic Chicken which I always did but the quantity they served today was just pathetic. It was like they prepared just more than one plate and divided it into two containers. Also this item used to have very very tender chicken pieces but not anymore.

Also I ordered another item named Chilli Shrimps which again used to be hot, fresh, and tasty but this time it was hard like rubber.

I called the restaurant and the manager/person at the other end put me on hold.
When I rang the next time/multiple times nobody picked up the phone.

This is really very disappointing and I feel very bad to write this review but I had to as this was my favorite restaurant to order chinese food from but it has NOW just become in word - WORST.

It seems they have grown so much and multiplied their revenues it doesn't matter anymore to them to look after customer satisfaction.

----------------------------------

To the Management,

Really disappointed and dissatisfied. I know it would not matter to you as you would still get many many customers.

1. You have increased prices and decreased quantity like anything.

2. If I order two plates you cook and divided one & half plate in two containers.

3. If I call your restaurant the people their keep me on hold and then never pick the phone.

What kind of service you are giving to your customers.

I had been ordering food almost once/ twice a week from your restaurant but now you have made it a joke.

I love this place as one of the best Chinese food in Kolkata but during our last ordering couple of weeks ago we found out that some of their dishes are very very hot. Although they marked those dishes as spicy in the menu card but it was hot beyond the limit. For example I had chilli garlic noodles from many places across the country; however I literally sweated when I had the same here.

Very calm and serene with a strong china feel . The staff, especially, the gateman is extremely courteous. The manages as well as the waitors are ever helpful, and courteous. 

Serves great food in acceptable time frame. Mouthwatering noodles, wantons and chicken items are what I have tried everytime.

And another thing, the washroom is beautiful and has a very homely positive vibe about itself. Surely give this place a try if you are a Chinese Food lover.

Wow! Where to start. The food here is awesome. The waiters are very courteous. Ambiance is very "Chinese". The music sets the mood right. Decor is also very good.

I went on a Friday night for dinner. So had to wait for 30 minutes to get to the table. But gladly they made up for that with the delivery time. It was fast, prompt. And the food, where to start, we ordered garlic pepper fish as starter. The fish was soft in the inside and spicy on the outside. Cooked perfectly. Kung pao chicken and chilli garlic rice. The chicken was very good. Instead of regular peanuts which are used in traditional Kung pao chicken they used cashew nuts which was a nice touch. They rice was very flavourful. The crispy fried garlic sprinkled on the rice added a nice texture to the dish.

All in all it was a very nice experience. And the bill brought a grin to my face as it was quite less than what we were expecting. So definitely we'll visit this place soon.

And that, my dear folks, is the apex of Oriental cuisine in Kolkata. No exceptions, no contenders. It had really been a long while since I had an experience as good as Chowman. Kudos!

Ordered Wok tossed Hakka noodles, Devils Chicken, and Fried Chili Squid. The noodles were delicious and very light, something you don't really get with Indianized Chinese. We had requested for any spicy Chicken dish and the server recommended Devils Chicken which truly was hot and spicy. The best thing of the lot was undoubtedly the Squid preparation. A little crunchy, a little rubbery (in a good way), full of flavours,  and really worth the money.

It was a perfect weekend dinner tonight at Chowman. It was in my wish list for a long time. I was amazed after watching the crowd outside this place. The interior was really impressive. Very warm service by the staff. Now comes the food. We tried all the new dishes in menu. Starting with Chicken in banana leaf, which was just amazing. Then we had the Chowman special fried rice and chicken with cashew nuts, orange float. We loved all the food.

This place is easy to find. They do not have any parking lot. The food was served hot. We had ordered chicken in banana leaf, fried rice with seafood and chicken in black bean sauce. Chicken in banana leaf was something new. Not up to the mark though. But the other two items were really good....Will visit again.

It goes without saying that this oriental chain of restaurant have always maintained their standard in terms of quality, but however in the recent days the quantity have been squeezed down specially if you observe the size of the containers going down during home delivery compared to the prices.

And that, my dear folks, is the apex of Oriental cuisine in Kolkata. No exceptions, no contenders. It had really been a long while since I had an experience as good as Chowman. Kudos!

Ordered Wok tossed Hakka noodles, Devils Chicken, and Fried Chili Squid. The noodles were delicious and very light, something you don't really get with Indianized Chinese. We had requested for any spicy Chicken dish and the server recommended Devils Chicken which truly was hot and spicy. The best thing of the lot was undoubtedly the Squid preparation. A little crunchy, a little rubbery (in a good way), full of flavours,  and really worth the money.

The ambience and the service is top notch. We had servers checking up on us constantly to ensure that we had a good time. The decoration of the place is amazing and so is the choice in music. Highly recommended.

The last time I visited was last year September but my experience in chowman few days ago wasn't that pleasant. We ordered for:
- sichuan hakka noodles: had a peculiar smell.
- roasted pork in hot garlic sauce- it was alright but I wish it had some more fat on the meat 
- prawn in garlic wine sauce - this tastes good 
- seafood fried rice - tastes alright 
- chicken steamed momo - again, had a weird smell from the meat. Didn't like it.

However, the service was good but the quality fell.

My go to place to satiate my Chinese cravings. The meifoon here is to die for! And so is the roasted chilli pork or the double fried pork. For appetizers wanton or the chowman's favourite soup are a must along with fried chicken wings or drums of heaven. I love the burnt coriander rice too. But for dessert I like to stick to sizzling brownie with ice cream, as I don't like the other options.
The ambience in one word is wonderful. The light and shadow work, the witty placement of artefacts and the background music helps one transcend to a world of mysticism. With the help of very efficient and generous staff dining here becomes a memorable experience.

Finally I have been able to tick this restaurant off which was pending for a while now. It's easy to find, you can follow the Google navigation to reach there. The location is very close to Santa's Fantasea, walking distance I would say. There isn't any parking available, so if you are taking your car you'll have to park it infront of it on the road. Not very well spread out but compact with good number of seats. We were a group of six and were warmly welcomed. A table attendant showed us to a table and waited patiently while we took some time to discuss and place the orders. Our orders: prawn sui mai, chicken momo, teriyaki chicken(little sweet), pan fried fish(basa), drums of heaven, Jumbo prawn schezwan style, prawn meatball soup, chicken clear soup, Chowman special fried rice, butter garlic fish, wok tossed hakka noodles and Sizzling brownie with hot chocolate sauce. We tried to cover as much as possible but missed having crab and pork preparations. Most of the dishes were good except the Chowman special fried rice. There's nothing special in that except for some extra veggies and mushroom. Not much egg, chicken or prawns in it. Prawn sui mai needs some improvement as it tasted a bit bland. Momos were large sized, just about okay. The other starters are pretty good. The soups were alright and light. The table attendants were diligent, cordial and served us well. Ambience was quite nice with oriental music playing softly in the background to create the mood. Hygienic and neat cutlery. The final bill had only service tax, so they don't include service charge(tips). Please feel free to tip the table attendants if you like their service. A little bit of encouragement in this form will surely boost their morale which, effectively, will result in a better service. I'll surely return to this place to try out their recently launched Thai menu as well as the crab and pork items.

If you're looking for chinese food then this is the best place. We went there yesterday. The staffs welcomed us very nicely. The ambience was beautiful. Now, I come to the main point that's food. We ordered drums of heaven and konzee crispy lamb for starters, chowman's special rice, mixed Shanghai fried rice, Cantonese noodles and oyster chicken with vegetables for main course and walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert. All of the starters and main courses tasted so yummy. It's not so spicy. The dessert was awesome. Though the price will pinch your pocket lightly. But your taste buds will be satisfied.

We were a hungry group of six and we decided to pop into chowman as we were in the area.
The ambience is beautiful,the waiters were a bit slow...you had to call for their attention many times before they responded. We started with meatball soup and lemon pepper soup. Meatball soup could be better,the lemon pepper soup was good. We also had roast chilli pork which was lip smackingly tasty.
The mains,however,disappointed me...the meifoon and the noodles tasted nearly same,the Hunan fish had an obviously thickener-used gravy,the devil's pork could be spicier.
I've not tried their Thai preparations, but considering the price,I've had much better Chinese.

If you want delicious Chinese coupled with a great dining experience without burning a hole in your pocket, Chowman is the place to go to! The affordable rates and amazing quantities make it a favourite for students, who are tired of oily Chinese food in shady restaurants across the city. 

Also, the ambiance is quite nice and the service isn't so bad either. I would definitely recommend it!

Its located near swimming pool gupta brothers. 
I had been here a few months back n had absolutely loved the food. 
Had ordered veg hakka noodles n some gravy dish (don't exactly remember what it was). Both were amazing! Tasted perfect. Have been dying to visit this place again to try other dishes. 

My only problem with this place was that when we went there, there was a staff meeting going on. All the waiters n manager were involved. So we had to wait quite a bit for the waiter to come to take our order. They could have either closed the restaurant while the meeting was in progress. Or they could have spared a waiter or two to take the orders of the waiting patrons.

We love Asian food and so when in Kolkata, we decided to satiate our cravings with Chowman. Ambience was exquisite - complete with larger than life Buddha statues, laughing buddhas, Chinese scriptures and the likes. 

The place is cozy and the menu is exhaustive. One huge reason we came here were for the dimsums. Unfortunately they got over for the day :(

We ordered for lemon coriander soup (since I'm a big fan of clear soup and hello, they are so low on calories!) and honey glazed chicken - sweet chicken has always been my favourite. We had our niece with us, who despises spices so for her we ordered plain Hakka noodles for her and butter garlic fish. The fish was a hit with all of us - since it very buttery and melt-in-the-mouth kinds. Our food was overall good but the only qualm we had was that the service was a little slow. However, it's a good value for money if you want delicious Chinese food!

Three of us at office ordered Lamb in Oyster Sauce at lunch. This was the first time I tasted lamb. The meat was soft, boneless and the gravy tasteful.  The weirdest part was that, to all of us, (including a one who had tasted lamb previously from other restaurants) the gravy tasted more like a fish preparation. Was that lamb meat dipped into a ready chilly fish gravy? We were sceptical. It's difficult to draw a conclusion until I try lamb from another place, may be at Buddha Bites..any recommendation friends?

Food:starters were great. We ordered crispy chicken,sweet corn soup and chicken drumsticks.drumsticks were more liked by friends and me , the soup was extremely sweet.the restaurant can surely work on that.in main course,we ordered Shanghai fried rice and chilli pork, funnily the Shanghai fried was chilli and not spicy and the taste of chilli pork was mediocre.
So a 3.
Ambiance: the outside of the restaurant isn't very eye catching and glamorous .I wouldn't even have picked this restaurant if my friend hadn't recommended it but surprisingly the inside ambiance is pretty well.chinese encryptions on the wall and soft music really sets in the mood for some Chinese food.
So a 4.
Service: the waiters are well trained and respectful.the service is undoubtedly great and deserve a pat on their back.
So a 4.5

I believe they know how to handle fish and prawns. Though I didn't like their lamb or chicken as I think It was a bit overcooked and chewy.my all time favorite is crispy noodle salad,fish pepper salt,chowman special rice,kung Pao prawn.

Another of those Chinese dine-ins with a proper blend of Chinese culture. Located in CF Block of salt lake, it occupies a prime location for foodies to hop in. 
When you enter the place the first thing you notice is a marriage of Chinese decor with some Chinese music. With lanterns,dim lights and Chinese wall hangings a true Chinese culture has been brought up,  topping it up with the Chinese cuisine.
Talking about the food, well it's quite delicious and well cooked by the chefs. The menu has got a wide range of starters starting from mushrooms to corn to shrimps to fish to chicken to pork and to lambs and the main course too has a lot of options. I found shanghai fried rice topped with tsing hoi chicken to be quite delicious. Adding to this, the menu is basically on the cheaper side. 
The management was quite generous and welcoming. The service was prompt and left no scope for any complain. 
Overall the experience was delightful and would recommend people to visit the place if they are looking out for a Chinese lunch or a dinner.

this chinese restaurant  was in my wishlist for long!
finally decided to visit this place on Bengali Valentin's day! :D
once you enter the restaurant, the dragon statue  that mask of budhha gives  you a typical chinese restaurant vibes! 
coming  to the food,we as per zomato reviews ordered  crispy honey fried wantons! which satisfied our taste buds! 
for the main course we ordered  pan fried noodles, shrimp fried rice,roasted lemon pork,general taos chicken  and schezwan orange lamb.
all were moderate spicy yet tasty.
however lemon pork deserves  a special mention,this taste is going to remain with me for quite long! 
over all I give chowman 4 out of 5.

It's one of the best places when it comes to chinese food. The ambience is really pleasant and with a touch of Buddhist monastery. Well decorated and comfortable sitting arrangements. I'll highly recommend the American chopsuey. The gravy was well prepared and had an excellent use of spices. Accompanied by a perfectly prepared sunny side up. If you're into an appetizer first, you can try the hot n sour chicken soup. The service could have been better though.

I loved the package because of the touch of chinese dinning i.e. pair of packed Chopsticks. We had a wonderful meal and wish to visit this place again. Soon!! :D

Heard great reviews about this place. After few years outside India, had a tremendous craving for the Indo-Chinese cuisine. So, last Sunday, ended up visiting the Chowman Salt Lake.

Nice decor, dimly lit but sufficient for the family around a table. We were 4 adults and a 3.5 years old. We were shown a 4 seater table which we had to refuse. Even the airlines provide a separate seat for kids of age more than 3 years. The person insisted that the 6 seater is for a bigger family but at the end had to accept as we would not budge. The space inside is quite small and a bit claustrophobic as there are no views around.

Lets talk about the food. The place does not have a bar so you are restricted to mocktails and fizzies. For starters, we ordered - Garlic Pepper Fried Chicken, Drums of Heaven, and Lat Kai Mai. Food came fast and the presentations were good, quite good. The taste. Garic Pepper Fried Chicken is ok but I know some Tyangra joints that do it even better. Drums of Heaven was quite good. Lat Mai Kai came out as a mildly spices succulent boneless chicken pieces in a bed of finely chopped and sauted onions and spring onions. I have heard about this dish but could not get overly excited although it tasted different.

For the mains, we ordered a Veg Hakka Noodles, Chili Garlic Chicken Noodles, Hot Garlic Fish, and Hong Kong Chicken. This last dish was recommended by the person taking our order. He said its a new dish that they introduced. The Chili Garlic Noodles was quite good. The chef confused the order - first it came as Veg then after our polite protest mixed with Chicken. Hot Garlic Fish was ok, no surprises. Hong Kong Chicken looked exactly same as the Hot Garlic Fish except it is chicken and a bit more spicy with red chili flakes in the gravy. The taste was almost same as well. It could have gone out as a Hot Garlic Chicken as well.

Over and all, its a nice experience. It felt like that the restaurant is positioned somewhere between Mainland China and Tyangra joints in terms of taste and prices. Will I go to Chowman again? Probably, if I am in the area. Would have given 4 but deducting 0.5 for the episode with the seating arrangements.

Used to be one of my favourite Chinese restaurant in salt lake area. But recent visits just before Durga Puja with team was not so pleasent. Fish quality of wine fish was not up to the mark. Even corporate discount was not applicable due to some reason.

One of the best Chinese, seafood restaurant. Been here many times with family for dinners they will never disappoint you in anyways. My favorites are sweet corn soup, teriyaki chicken and schezwan mixed fried rice. Really large portions. They make you feel home on each and every visit.

My go-to Chinese place.
I've ordered quite a few times and it's mostly always been Dry Chilli Chicken and fried rice, Drums of heaven and a chicken gravy dish, and this place has never really let me down.
A little spicy, though. But that just ups the flavour.
Loove the packaging! With the chopsticks and everything. :)

Reached in afternoon during closed hours but still the manager was courteous to serve. Since the kitchen was about to close, I was asked to order the main course. The stir fried seafood noodles with Fish in Oyster sauce was out of this world. It was perfect and as per my expectations. Couldn't have asked for more authentic chinese. The ambience was good as well.

This place is located a few metres away from Sharma's in BF block , near Bidhannagar Swimming Pool , and is easily noticeable from the street . The ruddy interiors remind one of a typical China Town restaurant, complete with elaborate flowery wallpaper in deep hues of red , and complementing music to add to the experience and ambiance. The staff are extremely courteous , and the service is excellent. The food here is served pretty quick. The sweet and spicy crispy chicken was great for starters . The Mixed Shanghai rice tasted average . The Hot Pot Hunan chicken had too much tanginess that put off my taste buds. The mixed Phad Thai or Thai style meifoon had as zesty edge to it . The Lamb  in Chilli Plum sauce was great to taste , though it might seem a tad sweet to some . Overall we had a wonderful meal and wish to visit this place again soon!

I've been here thrice, and each time, I was quite impressed. The quantity, especially for fish, is substantial for the price of dishes. The Chilli Basil Fish and the Pan-fried Fish is quite delicious. They're really soft and well-cooked. The meifoon noodles are light and well-flavoured. The chicken dishes are usually good, however, the meat (both in the soup and starter) was not exactly tender. Ambience is amazing. 
Would recommend for Chinese and Thai food lovers.

After a long walk and an appetite as big as our city, me and my friend walked in to Chowman. It is a nice and cozy place. The decor is well executed. I loved their use of red. This place has the perfect balance of red and black. The dim light, the Chinese music playing in the background, the Buddha sculpture everything added to its theme. We ordered one chicken fried rice, one pork fried rice, and one chilly pork. The chilly pork was Yum! The other two dishes were also good. Most importantly the quantity was more than expected and was at a very reasonable price. The waiters were prompt at their service. We never had an empty glass. This place is quite affordable and very very good at their food and services. I highly recommend this place. I'd definitely go there again.

Ordered Chinese food from here in my office at PwC, Sec-V. Though the delivery was done on time, the quality of the food was not at all up to the mark. Chicken items were half-cooked and so were the noodles. Even the baby corn was hard to bite on & eat. This is not the quality of food one would expect from a brand like Chowman.

I don't like Chopsuey much, but this was good.
I liked their Devil's lamb the most.

Situated near swimming pool, the restaurant hub of salt lake,this is a really nice place for lunches/ dinner with your friends or family if you're opting for Chinese cuisine. It is lil bit  expensive, but they do serve good quality food. We ordered a couple of dishes, but among them, golden fried prawns,mixed wok tossed hakka noodles and chilli garlic chicken in red bell pepper sauce was really good. Totally worth the money.

I was in the are for an errand and i saw chowman and instantly my chinese loving taste buds were activated and i found myself sitting in a table with one of my friend. 
 It is located near gangotri at bf block. So its easily accessible by any auto. 
Comming to the food....
Chicken hot and sour soup - the soup was nice and spicy. Though the portion if the chicken could have bern a bit more. 
Lat mai kai - they said that it was one of their house specialities but it was nothing extravagant. The taste was okay and it was a little under seasoned.
Chicken schezwan noodles - i personally didn't like the noodles and thought the protion of chicken was very very little.
Fried chilly pork - this dish is the only dish that was good. The pork pieces were soft and succulent, the gravy was rich and spicy.
The waiters are very courteous and helpful but somewhere i think they need to increase their quality of food.
Thank you 
Cheers

Their catchphrase is somewhat along the line 'Think Chinese, think Chowman.' Well, gotta say, it seems quite true. Located near the Saltlake swimming pool, this restaurant has a cozy atmosphere, successful in creating a really good Chinese decor and ambience. Staff's courteous, and the manager also visited our table at a point of time.
Now comes the essential part, the food. As a whole, the items were absolutely delicious! We ordered crab meat soup, mixed hot and sour soup and konjee crispy chicken as starters. Soups were quite good but the konjee crispy lacked chicken!
As for the main course, we ordered Singapore noodles, chowman special mixed fried rice, Hong Kong style fish and hot garlic lamb. The rice was excellent and so were the fish and lamb dishes. Hong Kong style fish was absolutely top notch! The lamb was quite easy on the mouth and perfectly cooked. No complaints about the noodles too.
Prices are okay, and the quantity and quality of food is quite good!
Overall a wonderful foodie experience, and would recommend this place for sure for some awesome Chinese cuisine!

Chowman -  a new chain of chinese restaurants sprawling around the city. Tried to order something out of the box but felt overly disappointed....Tai pai chicken, pepper garlic lamb, fish in chilli wine, bell pepper chicken and mixed hakka noodles. Now mixed hakka noodles felt like any roadside food joint with a degraded quality of noodles. Tai pai chicken and fish in chilli wine felt like same salsa used. Lamb didn't have the desire quality and was much stiff than usual. Now coming to the ambience, nice decoration and courteous staff at the service with fair amount of feedback facility. 

Won't advice not to visit, but some part of the food can be considerably improved because of their potential. Eagerly waiting to pay another visit to try something other and to improve my rating. 

Cheers!

~ THE BIRTHDAY SYNCHRONICITY ~

The coincidental coup of my 100th review for my birthday lunch on Christmas day reminded me of TBBT's latest episode of the same nameüëÜ.I wanted a fuss-free lunch with my family and zeroed in on this particular outlet of the restaurant.

Location: Honestly,even after some detailed research on Google maps,I failed to convey the exact location to my driver and eventually got lost(we were coming from New Town).This outlet is a minute's walk from Santa's fantasea,Salt Lake.That's the landmark which got us back on track.

Ambience:Dim lighting, beautiful red and gold based chinese wallpaper and Budhdha figurines adorn the place.The decor is elegant,serene and beautiful.

Food:We were 4 people and ordered the following items-

PAN FRIED CHILLI CHICKEN(3.25/5):8 rectangular pieces of chicken breast pan fried till slightly crisp and then tossed in a chinese sauce with bell peppers and onions.Likeable but the chicken was a touch too dry.

VEG FRIED RICE(3.75/5):Ample amount of good quality rice tossed with carrots,beans and corn. Understated yet flavourful.

MIXED RICE NOODLES(4.5/5):A huge portion of thin rice noodles with a hearty amount of chicken,egg,shrimps and veggies.No distinctive overpowering flavours,so marries well with any strongly flavoured Chinese gravy-based dish you order along with it.

KUNG PAO CHICKEN(4/5):12 medium sized pieces of chicken tossed in a tasty gravy.My only complaint is that there were just 2-3 cashew nuts in it and I love kung pao majorly because of the crunch from the nuts.The best part was that there was almost no flour coating on the meat and you could taste the perfectly cooked chicken.

Service-The manager is really courteous but the waiters are a bit clumsy,well-behaved and competent nevertheless.The food didn't take much time to reach our table.

Price: Quantity and qualitywise very reasonable.A 3 course meal for 2 shouldn't exceed 900 bucks with a lot of leftovers.

Verdict:Think light, flavourful Indianised Chinese, without synthetic colours or grease, jam-packed with subtle yet clean,lip-smacking flavours and Chowman would be the front runner in that category.

This place is a heavenly delight for pork lovers for it's pocket friendly delights!
I mean, it's one of those Chinese places which serve pork! What else do you need?
The pork fried rice and noodles portions are enough for 2 people.
For starters, konjee crispy chicken is brilliant.
The chicken side dishes are equally good. However, I was unhappy with the shrimp preparation.
The momos are also delicious. I was quite unhappy with the service.

I used to get Chowman food home-delivered all the time till the delivery food dived in terms of quantity and quality. So when a friend asked me to have dinner here, I went in with low expectations. The place was crowded with the typical Chinese restaurant ambience in reds and bronze.
For starters, we ordered two plates of Roasted Chilli Pork and one plate of Baked Chilli Fish. The Pork was an absolute winner, even though a tad too spicy. The fish was soft and slightly sweet which soothed our tongue after the pork. For mains we ordered two plates of chicken fried rice and one Kung Pao chicken. The chicken was yum, and the cashews in the curry tasted great. The quantity was large enough for 5 people and some more to be packed for home. 
What I deduced is that they have good service and good food if you sit and eat there, unlike their horrible quality of delivery (which is mainly why I did not mark them a 4 or 4.5).

Hot garlic chicken Hakka noodles -very good.spicy!
Veg Hakka noodles - very good indeed.
*Noodles quality is better than rice.
Beverages was fairly well.

It's was my birthday dinner! üéÇ
Wanted to try Chinese cuisine and what better than Chowman after hearing and reading the reviews!! Located near Salt Lake swimming pool, it's small and cozy, dimly lit,lovely decor and not sure but Chinese music? ! üòù

For starters, we took Crispy Honey Fried Wanton Chicken .. Too sweet there! But loved their Pepper Garlic Chicken..thoroughly enjoyed.

Main course had mixed fried rice with Hunan fish and Hong Kong style fish! Good quantity each.. Enough for two! Quality is again worth a mention.

For dessert, Darsan with vanilla ice cream sealed my treat on a happy note. üòä

Also, the staffs are friendly and polite. Quick service offered, you'll have the manager by your table in sometime asking how to serve you better!

The restaurant is cosy, dimly lit (which is a good thing) and you have to weave your way through other tables and peoples legs to reach your designated table. Lacking in space - you've to wait for at least 45 minutes if visiting on weekends. No doubt the food is great and a good chopsticks experience.

But liked their starter items .. pan fried chili chicken and pepper garlic chicken.

Chowman can definitely be the hunt for the lovers of authentic Chinese cuisine. The creative way of decorating the place is simply amazing. The inscripted Chinese wordings on the wall along with the statue of Lord Buddha has successfully created a perfect ambiance to enjoy the delicious Chinese dishes. 

The last weekend‚Äôs outing with my dear ones became fruitful due to our visit to this marvelous place. Our order consisted of Manchow Soup, Shanghai Fried Rice, Schezwan chicken & Chilli Fish. Among all these dishes, I must mention the Manchow Soup, the rich flavor of this particular dish can make you visit this place again. Chilli Fish was another remarkable dish, which I must recommend you all to have. The juicy and tender pieces of fish will automatically melt in your mouth. The quality of the Shanghai Fried Rice was enough for me to call it a grand dish. 

Overall, this is a must visit place for the genuine lovers of some lip-smacking Chinese Cuisine. Awesome surroundings along with some grand dishes are what all the foodies want to cherish.

Visited this place for Sunday lunch with wife and family. Ordered Meat ball soup (prawn) and Konjee Fried Lamb as starters - both of which were excellent...particularly the soup, which was out of this world. For main course, we had Mixed Shanghai Fried Rice, Hunan Fish and Lamb in Oyster Sauce. The delivery time was fairly standard, and all the food items were light, fulfilling, and absolutlely yum! my personal favorite was the fish preparation).

We also ordered some takeway - Kung Pao Chicken (gravy) and Hot Garlic Lamb, which were also very good. The staff were courteous and helpful (our waiter advised us to pick Hot Garlic Lamb over Devil's Lamb, as the latter might be a li'l too spicy).¬†

The decor is interesting, the lightings are nicely done, and the music added to the mood (although it was slightly difficult to hear over the noises of the Sunday crowd). All in all, an excellent joint...one we would LOVE to visit again!

Good decor and ambience. But when it comes to the actual thing that matters , the food, Chowman really falls short. 
We ordered konji crispy lamb as starters and American chopseuy as main course. What both the items had in abundance was cornflour. The crispy lamb was so heavily doused in batter , it could be differentiated from onion fritters. We got no taste of the lamb. And as for the chopseuy the gravy had very amount of chicken or prawn in it. It was also mainly a broth thickened with cornflour. Frankly I have had much better within this price point.
Not worth the money.

Location: 3/5 Thanks to Google Navigation system.

Ambience: 4.5/5 Creative way to utilise the ground floor of an house and the impacts are very amazing! The Buddhas on the walls and other decors, the music and that Chinese and Thai feeling.. excellently dealt.

Hospitality: 5/5 The manager seeked our response too.

Hygiene: 2/5 Despite the ambience being proper, the authority needs to pay attention to the hygiene factor of the restaurant. I found a hair on my tablet mat and my brother found one on his spoon.

Food quantity: 4/5
Food quality: 4.5/5
Food taste: 3.5/5
We ordered for Veg clear soup, tasty and extremely healthy. Next, veg Singapore noodles and a Chinese maincourse side dish of Mushroom and corn. The noodles tasted better. The gravy of the side dosh was good too, but slightly more garlicky. Next, mixed fried rice and Kung Pao chicken. Both tasted amazing. The prawns in the rice were big, fresh and tender.

Value of money: 4.5/5
Price menu is very much appropriate.

Overall, a good experience. I'll definitely want to visit this place again, when I don't need to depend on veg foods.

One of the best chinese food I've ever had. 
A dimply lit place which automatically gives you a feel of chinese atmosphere. 
Buddha's face was the mark of the place which really enlightened it. Alongside, chinese cravings on the wall.
Friendly staff there. 
Our orders began with pepper garlic chicken, konjee crispy chicken and fresh lime soda. Liked the presentation and taste of both. Perfectly done fresh lime soda. 
For main course we had chicken schezwan noodles and chilli chicken. It tasted simple, yet great. 
Bill was around 1750 for 4 of us, quite a pocket friendly one. 
Sure to come back.

Finally chowman and i have been utterly disappointed by it. After hearing so much about their cuisine, thought of giving it a try and was expecting some real amazing chinese flavors and the expectations were never met.

We went for a delivery. Full marks for the person who was on the other side taking orders and to the guy who delivered as he was courteous enough and patient and apt with the delivery. The items were properly marked and beautifully placed. Still confused as why they provided us with one chopstick only. Loved the packaging of theirs.

Coming to the food, we ordered the following

Roasted Chili Pork

Roasted Chili Lamb

Double Fried Pork

Tai Chin Chicken Dry

Dragon Chicken dry

Chicken fried rice

Mixed Pan Fried Noodles

Teriyaki chicken

Fish in Chili Mustard Sauce

The quality of the food were good although we did have some difficulty in setting apart the flavors, and also the portions were pretty less than what was promised or heard of. The Fish in Chili Mustard Sauce were the best of the lot followed by the chili Pork and Lamb.

The pan fried noodles was a disaster, as it did went pretty cold, and was almost uneatable, and from someone of chowman's stature, we expected more from them. Nevertheless, i would want to give their dine in another chance, but the delivery was below par for most of the food items.

Visited this place less than a month ago. The decor is pretty impressive and located in an easily-communicable location, but the food was not so impressive. Crispy Chilli Babycorn was pretty good but the same can't be said for their Crispy Konjee lamb. The lamb was overcooked and a bit dry. Also tried Hunan pork, Shanghai rice and devil's chicken. The staff was proper and polite. All in all a moderate experience. With

I¬† THINK THEY JUST DON'T¬† KNOW¬†¬† HOW TO COOK CHINESE FOOD.TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING AND WASTE OF¬† MONEY.

Heard a lot about CHOWMAN so thought of exploring it today.¬† I ordered some food and after it was delivered i¬†¬† went through a horrible experience.
As i heard that salt is the most important ingredient in cooking. But in the food salt was missing. We had ordered oyster chicken with veg but¬† what¬† we got is full of veg only no chicken at all and i can't¬†¬† describe how bad¬† its taste¬† was!! Now coming to the noodles , we ordered pan fried noodles it was just over cooked ,dry,too much oil¬† just like an elastic and the most important ingredient was completely missing and the quantity of the noodles was totally inappropriate and unacceptable like a mountain in labour and a mouse be result.¬† Yeah i am taking about salt ,noodles without salt..!!!!!!

Crispy lamb was delightfully crispy, better than I expected. Chowman special chicken was a bit of a let down however, too bland and too little chicken in it...

Chowman should be renamed as spice garden.All the items were so spicy  that literally bought tears into the eyes.Coming to hospitality,it was way too disappointing.I could see the place heavily crowded but that nowhere justifies not so humble behaviour of the staff.we ordered lemon chicKen was nice,shezwan chilli babycorn was different,monchow soup was basic,fresh lime soda was decent,konjee crispy chicken was red chillI chicken-spice was intolerable,sanghaI noddles was more spicy than Singapore or shezwan noddles of any normal restaurant.Overall chownan is land of redchillies.If u eat medium spicy you should order everything with no spice.The place can be called cost effective if they reduce the spice in the food.Overall it was a bad experience,They serve spicy food in the name of authentic chinise food.Only plus point of this place is the decor and the ambience.

I have heard about this place from my friends and gave a visit on a weekend for lunch. After I entered, I realised what I have heard from my friends about the ambience of this place was absolutely correct. Very impressive Chinese themed decor with dark colored furniture and dimmed light. It boosted up my appetite.
We were welcomed with warm greetings and that was nice. In starters I ordered momo however that was not available the stuff advised me to try wanton instead. As I was not aware of that dish, he explained how it is made and I ordered. Even thou he said there might be some delay to get this item delivered, they managed to serve it within 10 minutes. The wanton was good with the hot and sweet red sauce. Then I ordered some mixed Cantonese noodles along with pepper chicken. Both of them was very good, streaming and well cooked with good quality ingredients. They served both the dishes midium spicy as requested.
I have really been impressed by the price range, quality of food and mostly, the hospitality of the stuffs inside. The manager came twice to check if everything is alright as we were eating slowly haha. This is something really exceptional if you visit restaurants of Kolkata in this price group. Highly recommended for all the foodies with heart for Chinese if you are around salt lake BF block. Cheers!

The place is near Baisakhi Swimming pool.I went for dinner there with my family.
The Decor is nice,dimmed lights were soothing for the eyes.
Now lets come to the food.At first we ordered "Crispy Chili Baby Corn" ,"Stir fried Chicken With Basil" and "Konjee Crispy Lamb" as starters.They were really good,specially the lamb, went well with the sip of ¬†Lime Soda.
In the main course,we ordered Chili Garlic Rice and Chowman Special Noodles accompanied by "Chili Garlic Baby corn and Button Mushroom " , "Chowman Special Chicken" and " Chili Garlic Chicken In Red Bell paper". All of them were good except the Chowman Special Chicken.The white sauce based gravy didn't taste good at all.
At last we had "Darsan With Ice cream".That was awesome.

Verdict- Food overall was good but as a Chinese food lover,expectations were really high from this place and that didn't get fulfilled.Hope to visit again and taste some different dishes next time.

Very nice and cosy place to have yummy chinese food. Have ordered chicken lollypop in starter which wasnt good at all. In main course i wanted to order thai red curry with some chinese rice but the staff recommended to have it with plain rice as it wont go well with chinese cuisine and i actually find it very tasty. The chef had prepared the plain rice with basil which gave it a different taste. The experience was good except the starter would definitely like to explore their menu again.

This is one of my all time favourite go to places in salt lake! If youre in the mood for some good chinese food this is the place to be! The ambience is pleasant and the staff is prompt and helpful with the orders. They have some specialty items and you may need help with them!

My recomendations:
1. Basil Rice (very unusual and yet easily pleasing)
2.chilly pork
3. Fish in chilly mustard sauce
4. Mushroom
5. Pan fried noodles

I would recommend that you go there personally with family and or friends instead of ordering in... ive tried both and theres just something about eating at the restaurant in that atmosphere.

Thats what it was. The restuarant seemed small from the outside but when we entered it was a completely different atmoshpere. Situated near the salt lake swimming pool 5mins from santa s fantasea...
The ambience is very nyc.. gives you a feel of china. The food was one of a kind too. We had the thai rice along with lamb and chili pork. It was too good.
The restuarant staff were courteous enough. And kept a tab, and came forward to serve whenever required.
The pricing of the food was also okay. Overally loved the thing altogether. Would love to visit again.

Been there once and had a couple of home deliveries. This place near Swimming Pool in BF Block is a good mid-ranged place for quite good Chinese food. They can surely give competition to Mainland China. Their dishes are quite authentic Indo-Chinese, the kind you would want and their prices are also not too high. It is a good place for frequent visits. Also, since there aren't many mid-ranged dedicated restaurants serving Indo-Chinese fare, Chowman clearly stands out when considering restaurants in Sector 1 of Salt Lake.¬†

The disappointments I had till now was that the wantons were a little dry, and their spring rolls were too thick and heavy.

Slightly overhyped. The restaurant has got a nice ambience and an elegant oriental feel but the food is not at all good. We ordered hunan chicken( by mistake) and ended up leaving the bowl untouched because of its horrible taste and texture. It's way too bland than the actual Chinese dishes are. Service was fast and fine. Even the prices are moderate but some dishes that the waiters suggest,never try coz u will end up leaving the bowl untouched. Therefore an OK kind of a restaurant to dine.

Tried American chopseuy,  chilli fried pork and barbeque chicken. 
Barbeque chicken was very tasty. 
Chopseuy was not good at all. 
Chilli pork was awesome. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all. 
Interior has oriental look and enough spacious and comfortable accommodation. 
Service was quick.

Clean and elegant decor with oriental touch. But the food was not upto the mark. Though the starter of Barbeque Chicken was good but the mains were disgusting. The Chilli Pork was great but the American Chopsuey was awful, too sweet for my taste. The quantity was fine. Loved the quality too. But would try something else next time. That Chopsuey disaster will be keeping me away from it forever though.

We order regularly from Chowman. My one of the most favorite Chinese Restaurant. Today ordered Chowman Special Chow which is loaded with exotic veggies with chicken and prawn topped with an omelet. I love the crispy baby corn with Honey and I order this every time. Kung Pao Chicken is great along with Chicken with Celery and Wine. Loved the dishes.¬†We ordered 2 plate special noodles which should come with 2 omelets.. However there was just one. :( Since I am an omelet lover I deduct 0.5. Yes.. I love omelet badly.. :P Enjoy. I highly recommend Chowman to all.

Truly madly in love with chowman. Authentic Chinese food with great taste.
Ambiance- Very nice ambiance.Wall decoration is very beautiful. Lights, sitting arrangements are perfect.
Food- Ordered Thai Ching chicken and chicken in basil as starter. Both the items are month watering. specially the Thai ching.
As main course we have ordered chowman special noodles. It's made of chicken, prawn, veggies etc. Next item is Thai rice noodles which is made of rice noodles, chilli flakes, chicken etc. It's taste is typically Chinese. As side dish we have ordered sweet and sour fish. I am not fond of fish but this fish item which is recommended by the staff is so good in taste. We have ordered aerated cola which is so refreshing. Guys please come to this restaurant for once at least and experience the Chinese.

But they were really quick and we got the table soon.We tried the Pepper Chicken for starter,Yummy!!! For the main course we had Pan fried mixed noodles. It's a gravy...it was tasty but lacked a bit of seasoning....But that is jst fine and negligible. However the Roasted Chilli Lamb is THE best side dish I've had. It's just a 5/5
                    Overall it's a must visit for all!!

Chicken Meifoon Fried Rice,Chicken in white garlic sauce,Mixed cantonese Chowmin

CHICKEN MEIFOON FRIED RICE was not at all tasted good the ingredients the spark everything was missing in my first visit i was also dissapointed with the fried rice section only.CHICKEN IN WHITE GARLIC SAUCE was good but it could be better its gravy i found it to be too mild the gravy could hav been a bit thick then it would be a brillant side dish,MIXED CANTONESE NOODLES was the best gravy noodles i had in my life everytthing was perfect it gravy it is full of veggies and had a perfect blend to all its ingredients nd it comes with a good quantity as well 

If u visit this joint u should go for Gravy noodles section it there speciality i assure u that u all will be delighted with there food and hospitality cheers!!!!!!!!

Went with my office colleagues. Even though the strength was pretty large still their service was quite slow. Starters, main course and desert all were good. Only thing that I didn't like was when we asked for a prawn dish they suggested lobster and insisted to have it. We agreed to it but later found it to be 1200 per plate. While they were insisting for something they should also be mentioning the cost. Well the lobsters tasted quite good but if you are thinking to have it keep an eye on the cost as well.

Today had the chance to visit the place for lunch.  We ordered Green and red pepper chicken for the starter and it tasted really good. Then for the main course we went for mixed hakka noodles and mixed Cantonese noodles along with honk Kong chicken and hunan chicken. I was a little disappointed with the hunan chicken cause the taste is not like what I had at other places. But overall the food was delicious. Keep up the good work. And the staff was really polite and helpful.

When you are looking for a hearty chinese meal but do not want to spend too much, go to Chowman. Just stick to the popular dishes and you should be fine. Chowman special rice/noodles is good. They also make a mean chilli pork. Never found the soups any good! Their decor is quite nice.

Pocket-friendly place.
They serve huge quantity with quality food at much cheaper price.
Except the Chicken Konjee all items were good.
I had Chicken Konjee so many items @Mirch Masala and they provide shredded pieces with enough chicken quantity in them, however the one provided by Chowman are so tiny that you gett the feeling of biting fired corn flour with nothing in it.
Apart from that Corriander burnt garlic fried rice, Mustard chilly fish(best of all) , noodles, chicken wanton anpepper fish were delicious.
Dessert is too costly compared to food items.
So have lunch there and walk out nearby to grab an ice-cream or lime soda form outside.

I have been to this place a couple of times, in small or large groups. Mostly it has been a good experience. The first thing that strikes is the interior. Not planned in a dining hall, but more out of a big apartment, with the oriental Buddha theme everywhere. The gigantic Buddha face on the wall is so imposing.

The food quality is value for money for the quality, and everytime we ended up ordering more than we could finish. Special mention goes for the starters of king and jumbo prawn.

Heard a lot about this outlet of Chowman and a couple of days back we decided to go lunching there.

The decor is beautiful and the staff greeted us warmly.

For starters, we had ordered double fried pork and chicken spring rolls.
The pork was tender and succulent and the spring rolls were spicy and crunchy on the outside. We loved them both.

For the main course we had ordered Chilly Garlic Chicken Fried Rice, Devil's Chicken and Jumbo prawns in chilly mustard sauce.
The fried rice lacked the flavour of garlic , had too many chunks of carrots. After a couple of spoons it tastes very dull.
We were looking for a spicy preparation of chicken and we're recommended the Devil's Chicken. This was the biggest disappointment of the day. Let alone spicy and rich flavours , the chicken was undercooked and the dish was way too mild. The flavour of the rice was easily dominating the taste of the chicken.
The prawns nonetheless tasted really good. The tang of the mustard sauce and the rich taste of chilly was perfectly balanced. The prawns were very soft.

Great food! was wholly satisfied with the ambience and the food and the service. The prices were okay-ish not too high. Hungry 13 people were easily satiated with just 4000 bucks!! The best thing is the ambience, you will find a great Buddha fresco-ed on the wall as soon as you enter. the lights were very soothing.

The negatives: we had to wait for a long time to get a table on a weekday, wednesday. Our bad, since we were 13 people and did'nt even care to book a table. But most of the 4-6 people tables were empty. That was the only minus point which held back from giving a 5.0 rating.

Their chowman special noodles/Rice is a must try .. and and those who love pork.. the rosted chilly pork it's really well cooked and the taste is simply fab.. but again I'll say they were better 1 year back.. the taste and quality isn't the same anymore.

I have always been an ardent lover of Chowman and been ordering their scrumptious pork and prawn dishes for years. I always make it a point to order in from the joint when I am in town. This I ordered from Crispy Konjee Lamb and Hot and Sour Soup from their Salt Lake outlet. The lamb was very soggy and very far away from crispy. When I called back the restaurant to ask them what it was about there was no apology or replacement coming my way. I was told that this is how Crispy Konjee Lamb was supposed to be. My dear restaurateurs the name implies crispness ¬†and if your Crispy Lamb is not served crisp maybe you should review your recipe. Secondly, I have already tried the dish last time and it was perfect. This time the tactic was changed to the kitchen is closed. Again no apology from the restaurant. It may have been your last order but such a half heartedly prepeared dish was uncalled for. It would have been better to not have taken the order at all.

The hot and sour soup was decent but did not taste as good after my encounter with the staff.¬†

Very very disappointed with their food and lax attitude.

Now coming to the food..a single dish of any food is more than sufficient for two person.. extremely happy with the quantity..as of taste the lamb was bit too hard and cold..chicken meatball could have been better..Kung pao chicken and friedrice was good.. specially the friedrice was excellent..the most impressive thing about this place is the attitudes of the staffs.they were extremely courteous..the manager came across to our table for couple of times to get a sense of our experience.. overall a good place to hang out and eat.. recommended..

An impressive entrance with a Buddha bust at the waiting area , the place's ambience is pretty impressive along with the food which tastes oh so divine , one must definitely try the orange chicken , it simply melts in your mouth , had been to this place a couple of times and have never been dissapointed .

Now, why am I not rating a higher star then ???
Well for start i have this big mystery related to this place ,which i think even sherlock is incapable of solving , I have this big question as to why the food which is up for home delivery tastes so different from the one which is served at the dine in and this is not the first time it has happened thrice , compelling me to believe that food on home delivery comes from a very different chowman , which perhaps exist in a parallel universe to provide such tasteless, poor quality food , otherwise nothing else answers this mystery .

So if anyone is actually thinking of ordering a home delivery from here based on their experience at the dine in , then be ready to get very very dissapointed for that person is going to be in for a jolt .
NEVER, I REPEAT NEVER ORDER A HOME DELIVERY FROM CHOWMAN , INSTEAD GO FOR THE DINE IN .
BUT IF YOU ARE THE BRAVEHEART THAT YOU THINK YOU ARE , AND YOU THINK WHATEVER I AM SPEAKING u
IS UTTER BALONEY, THEN BE MY GUEST AND DONT COMPLAIN LATER ON .

A great place to devour on Chinese platter. Went on a sunday lunch. A good light and dark ambience. Service is prompt and quite fast. And the food is delicious to the zenith. I had a cold on that day and the hot and sour soup cured all. The chilli garlic rice is well made. I would love to mention about devil's pork- a hot jot spicy dish with soft pork but a gravy that makes you feel the chilly very best. Even the pan fried fish was well prepared, soft and tender. Will visit again for sure.

I went to Chowman for dinner with a friend after she suggested that they have the most chinese food. I am a huge fan of Chinese cuisine and the ambience was spot on- the traditional Chinese music was playing , lighting was dim and decor was filled with figures of Buddha and other Buddhist elements. There is a very peaceful vibe about this place. For starters we tried the pepper garlic fish which was an absolute treat. Fish was cooked beautifully and served with some sauted vegetables and it tasted perfect. For main course we tried the pan fried gravy noodles- the dish was gravy noodles mixed with prawn, chicken and lots of vegetables like broccoli, mushroom, cucumber . The noodles was quite heavy and tasted good but the flavour of soya sauce was a bit too much . Overall they serve generous portions of food and service is excellent. Would definitely love to visit again and try the other stuffs .

The ambience is quite appealing with soothing  Chinese music playing in the background. The staffs were very courteous. Coming to the food - tasted delicious with authentic chinese flavor. 
We ordered lemon coriander chicken soup, chilli garlic fried rice and kung pao chicken. The soup tasted a bit sweet but the aroma was too good. The rice was excellent with adequate amount of spices and the best was the chicken kung pao. It had generous number of cashew nuts and tasted awesome. The quantity was huge for 2 people, - 1 plate rice was enough for 3 people and the chicken dish had 12 small pieces. 
Definitely will visit again.

Went to Chowman when my foodie friend recommended me. We ordered main course and I was disappointed with the food. The veg manchurian smelt of oil and did not taste good. We ordered chili fish and it was also not as per our liking. I request Chowman management to look into this matter.

Ambience is up to the mark.Very well decorated with ample lighting. But the food is not what i expected.
Too much of lemon grass and other accessories in the noodles dampening the actual taste.The roasted chilli pork was good among the starters and the schezwan fried rice was good.And worst experience with the lemon and honey chicken..it was a dessert in the main course.

Good place if you are looking for some light chinese. They have a good variety on the menu and is a popular joint which is evident from the number of people even if you are going on a weekday night. I like the food here, its full of flavour at the same time light. The decor is also nice, though a bit dark i feel. Good place for a hearty meal.

I went to this place after a gap of almost one and a half year. It was my birthday evening and it went really well. The service was excellent. Right from the person at the entrance to the waiters. The manager personally visited every single table and asked for their feedback. Each table had a dedicated waiter who was right at his service even before the tinkling on the glass. Each and every dish was served within a very short span of placing the order, and the plates and cutlery were promptly changed after every course of the meal. The service deserves a 5/5.

The decor was simple and minimal. Nothing beyond ordinary. The chairs and the sofas were very comfortable with adequate amount of soft light throughout the place.

We had ordered, double fried pork for the starters, mixed chili garlic noodles and crabmeat rice for the main course with hot garlic lamb as a side dish. For the dessert we had toffee-walnut on vanilla ice cream. The noodles was perfect; amazingly balanced flavours, with chicken, egg and shrimps in abundant quantity. The pork and the lamb did taste good however that thin coat of cornflour on the meat could have been avoided. That was barring the succulence of the meat to hit the taste buds. The crab meat rice was a let down. It was just rice with scrambled omelette. I had discovered two very tiny thin flakes of crab meat in the rice, that's all. The toffee walnut was the undefeated winner. This was an amazing preparation.

I would have given a 4.5/5 considering the the flawless service, however the food could have been better. It definitely wasn't bad (except for the rice), however there is a huge room for improvement in the meat preparations. 4/5 hence.

Just when you thought that Chinese is getting too mainstream, Chowman changes your perception. Easy to find, chowman provides you with authentic chinese. Swashbuckling starters and enticing main courses have been their forte.Roasted chilli pork is delicious and filling combined with tom yum soup. Wok tossed Hakka noodles are simple yet appetising. The thing which makes this place an absolute go-to is the variety of menu it provides. Though chinese, from kung pao chicken to Hunan fish, the menu itself will leave you in splits.

Chowman is the answer to all our Chinese and seafood cravings. Situated near swimming pool this place has the perfect ambiance of a authentic Chinese food joint with large Buddha wall arts.The price is quite affordable and the waiters are extremely polite and friendly. We had ordered a mixed fried rice with chilli duck,chicken in oyster sauce and hot garlic fish. The duck was very soft and tender.The fish had no stink at all and was extremely soft. We had done a take away once and they had packed the food quite tactfully and there was not even a little bit of spilling. This place is recommended for the authentic oriental taste :)

Pathetic food quantity
I ordered first 2 plates of veg Hakka chowmein and then 1 schwesan fried rice
They are following fraud and malpractices
I was provided only 125 % of one portion of chowmein at price of two
When asked the server he said that's the size in puja and if 2 different bowls are required, it's not possible for a single order
We ate
I thought they might have reduced portion size
But after finishing we ordered rice
The portion of 1 seemed like it was last we visited
When contacted the manager he was adamant and did not want to show courtesy to answer my questions
He said the portion size cannot be challenged as per their policy
And was not keen on proving his point and told that I was misbehaving
From one of my favorite restaurant to a nightmare
It would have taken a minute to prove me wrong and I would have loved it
Behavior of the manager and server was not up to the mark
Would recommend to order in 2 separate dishes if you value money
Learnt the theft of food industry which is a great policy to loot people of their hard earned money
If it was possible, would have given negative points
The manager told that he is not affected if I give a negative feedback on Zomato
Amazing restaurant and amazing staff
Hope management is not like the staff and take action against the same

A visit to Chowman was long due and we were really eager to try this place. To start with the decor was excellent. Though I think strategic use of lights in some places could have made it even better.

The prawn sui mai was decent, though a little more seasoning would have made it better. The prawn fried rice with star anise was average. It was not bad, but nothing to remember even. The Schezwan Orange Roasted Pork was a real disappointment. Don't know how a dish with such a name tasted so bland. 

In all it is a pretty average place with food really low on flavours. Am not sure will return here soon.

Dropped by for Dinner this eve on a whim after reading some mixed bag reviews.

On the whole the venue typically gives you a glimpse of the Orient and lighting is ambient.

Had to request for an order taker so service isn't exactly prompt but doesn't totally disappoint.

We ordered

Pepper Garlic chicken: Flavourful and succulent pieces of Chicken in a brown sauce however the sauce was a bit on the saltier side. Portion size works for.02 pax

Fried chicken wanton was completely bland lacked any flavour or Seasoning and the accompanying sauce was more of a combo of tomato ketchup and some chillies.Rather disgusting honestly.

Mains

Initially ordered the

Hong-Kong chicken which is a ridiculous combination of star anise lots of.sweet chilly sort of sauce no distinct flavour. We requested it to be taken away as wasn't palatable at all and lucky for us we just tasted the sauce first so the portion was untouched.

VEG Shanghai Meinfoon noodles were a joke. OVERLY DONE AND CHEWY, nothing special.Basically these are Rice Vermicelli noodles which when not.done right taste downright rubbish and doughy.

We had to send the above 2 items and then simply ordered a basic

Veg Schezwan noodle which was nicely done

Chicken manchurian was okay chicken felt chewy nothing special.

Overall ok nothing out of the ordinary, easy on the pocket but somewhere.in the midrange cost wise.

The CHEF REALLY NEEDS TO WORK ON checking if his food is properly seasoned before dishing them out.

Mixed feelings about coming back.

Never reviewed a single restaurant in my life but had to review this one.  Dining here just changed my mindset for Chinese food and just got my taste buds craving for more.  Visited this outlet with my boss just for a quick lunch but as soon as i entered inside,  it just clicked on its own,  the theme, lighting and the music just took me straight to somewhere in China.  
Now coming to the food, we ordered Sliced Chicken schezwan style and doubled fried lamb.  The schezwan chicken was delicious, the chicken was tender, would have loved more of the schezwan sauce, but still a lip smacking starter,  the lamb was also good but was probably a bit fibrey,  and then we ordered Shangai fried rice and chilli garlic rice and fish in wine sauce and prawn chili.  The rice dishes were good,  the quantity was excellent and the main part of the whole dinner was the fish.  Ohh damn!!! That was so good i probably finished it in about 2-3 minutes and ordered another one alongwith the prawn dish which was good but nothing matched to the fish. We just finished eating came out and stated planning for our next visit here. A must on every Chinese food lover out there coz it might just change your view on Chinese cuisine.

I don't know why, in possibly three years, I haven't reviewed this place. Probably because I thought I shouldn't because I've only ever had food delivered from Chowman; I've never actually dined in there. 
But that's all in the past.
As far as Chinese restaurants go, Chowman serves quality Chinese food at very reasonable price and that's why it's one of the best places in Salt Lake to satiate Chinese cravings with. 
One of my favourites from Chowman is the Oyster chicken with vegetables because I love oyster sauce and I love mushrooms and it has both. The fried rice and the moon fan fried rice are both good. Chicken and fish based main courses are in general pretty good. However the lamb here is a bit chewy. And the steamed momos have too much oil on them, no less delicious though!
Their delivery is usually on time as well.

I went to Chowman in Salt Lake for a family dinner on a Sunday evening. Most of the tables were taken so a reservation is recommended. We ordered Pepper fish, chili pork as starters along with hot & sour soup. The soup came first but the starters were served a little later and not along with the soup. The main course was crab meat fried rice, Chowman Special Noodles and Red Pepper Prawns in gravy. The crab meat rice didn't have a good portion of crab meat. The prawn tasted okay. The service is efficient and the decor tasteful. However it looked like they were trying too hard to clone Mainland China.

>> non veg fish starter : awesome. 
>> non veg lamb starter (crispy lamb) : awesome 
>> non veg chicken starter : satisfactory 
>> special noodles : not at all satisfactory 
>> non veg main course chicken : satisfactory 
>> fresh lime soda : waste of money..  Lime water and sugar..  That's it... 

Hope this will give an idea of the food.. Nice ambiance and preferred place for some Chinese bites..

I always used to prefer Budha Bites over any Chinese place in kolkata. But Chowman changed my preference with the first bite of their starters. We were really hungry and so we ordered 3starters and 1 noodles with 1 side dish to go with it. They served the dishes real quick. Really appreciative! The starters were finger licking. The Krispy lamb stole my heart ‚ô•! While coming to the main course, since we ordered Chowman's special noodles I was expecting some special flavours. Truth be told there was nothing special about it. Lastly one tip for all of the foodies looking to try this restaurant, DON'T order the lime soda. It's not worth a penny!

Chowman is a place I have come to love. Want Chinese? Well, when in doubt, go Chowman!! 
Quality Chinese food which tastes delicious. 

You'll love the ambience as well. Yeah Yeah no surprises there. The decor is in red and black. Typical Chinese!! 

So I was craving for some good rice noodles, ordered in Singapore style rice noodles and chicken in red pepper sauce. Well, I was expecting the rice noodles would be thinner, with a different texture and a bit on transparent side as rice noodles generally are, but this one was no different from normal noodles. So that was a bit disappointing. 

Well, the chicken was delicious. Soft, succulent pieces of chicken that melts in your mouth. Loved the hot gravy. It's become my second favorite after chicken with vegetables in oyster sauce.

This is the best place to order Chinese food from when you are ordering in. The food is just right , hot and great as it should be. For starters the crispy chilli babycorn and mushrooms are a must try. However the momos were just alright nothing to wow you (be it fried steamed or pan fried) .Just standard. What will wow you is their Thai style veg rice. The smell of the basil wafting from it will transport you into a trance and the taste exceeds all expectations. The exotic vegetable in chilli basil sauce is the star among veg mains , yumm is an understatement. However the vegetables chilli garlic sauce was quite a disappointment with a cornfloury sauce and chilli flakes thrown in. Avoid. The thai gravy is also reccommended.(green /red both were good) . The chilli garlic noodles , hakka noodles though staple at every chinese restaurant , chowman takes the quality to one bar higher. You gotta eat here!!

One section of the restaurant was closed due to renovation and we got a 6 seater table in front of the kitchen. Everything was going good as usual ... then I observed a waiter/kitchen staff picking up few pieces (maybe scrambled egg or prawns) from a bowl of noodles, before serving . He ate it in the corner of the kitchen . This is unacceptable and unfortunate... I didn't raise any complaint as it was already late and I was not in a mood for any altercation... hope management takes strict action about it.

It's a conventional Chinese restaurant with clean and sophisticated interiors. Placid ambience and quite popular as well. 
Coming to food,
Tried soup which was not that great. It tasted me like knorr packet soup.
Noodles was decent and properly made. 
With noodles had ordered veg gravy which was again really well prepared.
Service is quick and its well managed. 
The best thing about the place is their d√©cor. I find it v soothing to my eyes.

The ambience of this place is really nice. Lighting, presentation and everything. But the food taste was pretty horrible. We ordered about 6 dishes, out of which 2 were delicious, 2 were okay, and 2 were horrible. The pan fried chicken noodles were an absolute horror. The chicken in it tasted like rotten meat. Overall, it's an overpriced place, as against the food quality.
P.S: You can go ahead and order "Mango Juice" for 90 bucks, and they'll serve you with Slice mango drink in a glass. We don't mind spending a few bucks on food, but it has to be worth it. This, was definitely not.

As we were 7 people therefore we had booked a table in advance. However on reaching there they insisted us to sit on a comparatively smaller table. We had to literally push them for little comfortable seating. Initially they tried avoiding but soon had to give in as we could prove that we had booked a table in advance. This was the only unpleasant part.
When it comes to food I would highly recommend this restaurant keeping the following aspects in mind:
1. Good quality of ingredients.
2. Quick service .
3. Value for money.
However needless to say that vegetarians might not have the best of options.

This place is the perfect destination for authentic Chinese food at an economical price.The ambience is perfect with soothing and mild Chinese music and excellent decor.The food was equally good.We ordered Chicken Manchow Soup,Schezwan Noodles and Chicken Teriyaki.All the dishes were perfect,especially Chicken Teriyaki which was very crisp and had an offbeat flavour.The staffs too were very cordial and service was excellent.Thumbs up for this place.

Ambience is awesome. I've always been choosy about my food, the food was nice and high in quantity, hospitality was up to mark. It was sweet lime soda whereas we ordered sweet and sour lime soda and they took care of it well when asked. They have done a great job utilizing the space. This is my last day in kolkata and my visit to chowman was worthy enough. :)

10/28 update: Chowman helpfully included a bug cooked into my momo tonight (photo attached). I suppose the extra protein makes up for my earlier experiences with them.¬†¬†Earlier review:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†My current order took over two hours. At 1.5 hours, I called, and they had no explanation for the delay, just said that it was out for delivery and I'd get it any moment. It took another half hour for it to get here (I live five minutes away from the restaurant). If your delivery people aren't going to deliver in the rain, why not turn off home deliveries and stop pretending you're delivering?

Previous two orders: the steamed momos had completely disintegrated. There was (literally) not one momo that still had it's stuffing inside.

Previous in-person meal: Asked for extra noodles for the manchow soup twice, was completely ignored both times. Ordered a Thumbs Up. It never arrived. They offered to bring it when I asked for the bill and they realized they'd never brought the drink out. No chance of getting anyone to bring us more water, ice, etc.¬†

Chowman used to be one of my favorite places in Salt Lake. Their management / service / execution these days has been a complete disaster every time I've ordered. Some of the their dishes are still great, but I'm going to start exploring other options for Chinese in the para.

Two main things that are synonymous to all Chowman outlets are their smart utilization of space teamed with acceptable interiors and obviously the quality of their food. 

I have always had an issue with the quantity of food served. A single plate of fried rice strives too hard to fill two ''proper Bengali sized'' bellies, but fails miserably. 

The flavors on the other hand are intact and clean. The spices and sauces used to curate the dishes are well balanced and strike a  subtle, likeable taste. If you are visiting, the must tries, from the menu are prawn ka seong, pepper garlic fish, drums of heaven, devil's chicken, fish in black bean sauce and schezwan prawns.

Heard a lot about this place before I had a chance of visiting it. But my personal opinion is not that impressive. 
Summary of my experience : 
Mixed Manchow soup - Salt was on the higher side. Tastes okay.
Steamed Chicken Momo - The coating was very thick n chewy. Experienced a very bad smell when d momos were cut open.
Chilli and garlic rice - The attendant briefed us on the same to be medium spicy but in reality, it was too spicy. Taste - Below average.
Hot garlic fish - The quality of the fish was just awful. Taste also was below average.

Would like to mention that the service too was not up to the mark. The wait time was much more than normal.

Ambience - 3/5
Taste of food - 2/5

(21.06.2016)

Chowman!such a great Chinese restaurant. Firstly I wanna say that location,ambience, service were A grade. Each and every person, from the watchman to the boy who served and took order-everyone was too systematic, as well as the service was. And the food? Oh gosh! I've never had meifoon like that level anywhere, such  a tasty dish. Ordered Singapore style and sanghai style meifoon, and orange roasted lambüòç. All dishes were just wow! üëå Have been there today to celebrate my birthday , was a lil treat to my better half from me;and we both were very happy to visit there! It was such a great celebration of another year of my life.


**************************************

Based on our second visit
(17.08.2016)

Visited second time here. The management is really getting better. We ordered-

Double roasted pork, by the Zomato suggestion. Really delicious it was. If I was at home, I'd certainly licked the plateüòã

At main course, we took crab meat rice üçö. The smell was a bit loud that it was spraded all over the entire room, and obviously it increased our hungerüòÇ 

The orange roasted pork was damn good too!üëå we loved that when we both got a little piece of orange at the dish when we were at the last stage of that delicious food-journey üòã. It was like such a cherry on top.üòç 
We also liked that the waiters' well mannered behaviour, nowhere we've seen that when you complete your dishes, they are asking you if the food wasn't good or not. Not professionally, we found them a bit touchy. We're really impressed. The manager was as usual decent and was checking everyone's table.

Such a lovely birthday treat it was!

Located near swimming pool island , saltlake. Spacious, well decorated and well lit.
When I entered I could smell the amazing fragrance (probably could be some insence sticks) which felt something divine and complimented to its ambience and the music altogether created a different charm.
My orders included a fresh lime soda( a perfect balance of sweet and salt) , crab meat soup, roasted chilli pork, moon fan rice, wok tossed prawns in chilli garlic sauce , toffee walnut ice cream. All the dishes were equally good and tasty.

Ambience 4.5/5
Ambience is really nice with ancient Chinese theme. Decorated with ethnic wallpaper and Buddha statues. A little bit gloomy but make you feel good with oriental background music.
Food 4/5
Food quality is up to the mark. We ordered sea food soup, which was okey and crispy chicken as starter. Chowman special noodles, schezwan chicken hakka noodles as main course. Both are good. I found schezwan noodles better than chowman special. As side dishes we ordered Chicken in Chilli Wine, Devil's lamb and sweet and sour fish. Chicken in chilli wine was okey though I didn't like it much. Best parts were Devil's lamb, which was spicy as hell but really delicious and sweet and sour fish, which was melting in mouth. Quantity was sufficient.
Service 4/5
Service was quick and overall good & employees were well behaved.
I learned and used chopsticks successfully for the first time here. üòÉ Nice experience.

One of the best places in the city for an authentic chinese experience. Started by Debaditya Chaudhury, a name familiar to rockheads in the city, this place does offer a wonderful ambience. Though the service tends to be a bit slow, but that's cool keeping in mind the food quality.Personal Favorite: Double fried chilli pork and Chilli garlic noodlesHave tried imitating the chinese and eating with chopsticks every single time I visited, and failed miserably every single time.

I was so excited when an authentic Chinese restaurant opened in Salt Lake. I have both eaten at the restaurant and ordered home delivery. The rice and noodles are all well made, specially the basil fried rice. The spring rolls are miss or take. The main course is good, the gravies are well prepared. The highlight of this place is the glass noodle salad. Unfortunately it's not available at zomato delivery option. But overall a good place to have Chinese food.

Located near Saltlake swimming pool, this place - let me convince you: food from this place talks way loud than any Chinese places I have visited.
It was few days back on a normal office get together and we ordered for "Egg Fried Rice" with "Cicken in chili wine sauce" and "Chilli garlic noodles" with "Tai Chin chicken - chicken with noticeable bell papers and spicy sauces" and a platter of "Chicken Mapo Tofu - minced chicken and tofu tossed in spicy sauces".
All food ¬†items had that perfect balance between spices and freshness along with yumminess that made our taste buds crave even for more (but unfortunately, we were tight on budget :P).
Anyway planning on visiting this place again soon to taste other platters as well. Have heard that their Chicken Wanton is commendable - will definitely try that out.

Highly recommended!

Indo-Chinese cuisine is rumoured to have arrived (and eventually popularized) in India by a small Chinese community based in Kolkata. Though the Chinese food we eat in India bear little resemblance to the original one we get in China, it is colloquially called Chinese food only, and I shall refer to it as the same in my review (and the blog title).

            Truth be told, I have never stepped foot inside the restaurant, but I have heard rave reviews about the ambiance from my less-indoorsy friends. But I have ordered a great deal from Chowman and therefore, would only focus on the food items in my review:

1.	Chicken Spring-rolls: I love, love, love the chicken spring-rolls at Chowman and would definitely recommend you to order this from the menu options. The spring-rolls are quite regular and thus, reliably tasty. 

2.	Prawns in Honey Chilli Sauce: If you like the taste of honey alternating deliciously with chilli sauce, you would surely like the yumminess quotient of these juicy and succulent prawns in honey chilli sauce, which in all honesty, works wonders on the prawns. 

3.	Chicken and Vegetables Pan Fried Noodles: Another absolute favourite, the restaurant mercifully provides the noodles and the other items in separate containers so that you can add up the ingredients and fix yourself a hot and fresh (and not soggy) meal. Apart from a one-time experience, I have found the pan fried noodles to be highly recommendable.
                                          ...

This was a much awaited dinner as I was recommended of Chowman being reasonably priced. Apart from being a paradise for Chinese cuisine lovers it is essential to mention the amount of food that they serve(for 2) is quiet a lot (which might be a good thing for foodies like me haha).
Ambience is really good , dim lighting complemented with Buddha statues gives a serene feeling. The Chinese music however might get a bit monotonous for the ears but one soon gets distracted from it once the food is served.
For starters we ordered
1. Coriander lemon chicken soup- slightly sour creamy soup.. nothing extraordinary but subtle to taste buds
2. Pepper garlic fish - a must try. Fish was of awesome quality
Main course :
1. Chowman special fried rice : medium spicy with prawns : good enough
2.prawns in black bean sauce : just enough salty mild flavour to set off with the spicy rice
. Great preparation. About 8 big size prawns.
3.chilly garlic fried rice and kung pao prawn : deadly spicy combination. Was too hot for my taste. Would not recommend trying these two together .
Service was good .. waiters were very polite and prompt with their services.
Overall I would give a thumbs up and a definite recommendation to visit this place !

The food was really good. Their popular dish Devil's Chicken deserve a praise. Not to mention the soothing Chinese music while you're eating Chinese delicacies is a win-win. Overall my experience with Chowman has been really good. I would return again to have some nice Chinese.

Finally Chowman is in Saltlake and i love their cooked noodles and veggies . I love the ambience anyways in south so the same pattern is kept. The only problem is its in swimming pool it should have been on main road where its easy to locate. I love their singapore and rice noodles. Crispy baby corn is to die for ! Vegans should try exotic veg in red sauce if you like spice in your food ¬†Though im sure this place is great for non veg lovers !

Chowman is that all-time-favourite place of any Chinese cuisine lover in town. You can't have enough of their roasted chilly pork and those mouth licious rice noodles. Today I tried the kung pao chicken for the first time here and I LOVED it. The chicken drumsticks on the other hand could have been better. You always love this calm and divine ambience that Chowman has with its antique decor. Those golden decorated wall and the Buddha idol at peace. The staff here are quite courteous and they dont keep you waiting much. The one with a great Sunday dinner at Chowman!

Had heard gret things about this place but was mostly disappointed . But here goes the detailed review

Ambience: Great ambience with the right deco, lights and music.

Service: This was overall satisfactory .

Food : Not up to the mark . The food did not live up to the reputation . Ordered Veg Fried rice which was average . Chicken in black bean sauce was too salty (" Nune Pora" if u are a bengali) . Did not find the prawns to be fresh though the red sauc was okayish . The only saving grace was the cantonese gravy chow .

Chowman is one of the finest Chinese food hut in the city.As I'm a too fond of Chinese cuisine,it's one of my favorite spot.
For more of a good two reason.. great chinese food with a normal budget but with a abnormal quantity.

LOCATION- At salt lake sector- i,just beside BF Ground.

AMBIANCE AND DECOR- The interior is nicely done with typical red black Chinese decor, Some Buddha idols and bianzhong.The walls are filled with Chinese calligraphy which is enchanting.

The Chowman chain of restaurants is owned by Debaditya Chaudhury, the famed musician of the popular Bengali rock band Lakkhichhara. Even deceased acclaimed film director Rituparno Ghosh was known to have takeaways from Chowman. Serene Budhha faces and statues, flowery watercolor-like murals, attractive Oriental walls that look like they've been wallpapered, dim lighting and soft, soothing Chinese canned music greet you as you enter this restaurant and are seated at your table. Ambience is praiseworthy, giving you an almost tranquil Zen feeling. Hospitality and servings of waiters and staff are swift, efficient, amiable, warm and welcoming. We ordered the lemon coriander thick chicken soup for starter, followed by prawn Ba Mee (Thai-style noodles), shrimp and veg. fried rice, and chilli chicken (dry). The Thai noodles were quite spicy and tasted different, not like the regular Chinese noodles or chowmein, but with a distinct fresh aroma. The chilli chicken was awesome, soup was excellent with a unique taste and fried rice smooth, buttery and tasteful. The best thing about Chowman is the five star quality food served at one-star cost, meaning they offer helpings of their items in sufficient - in fact more than enough - amounts at affordable prices. For a family dinner of six, the bill had amounted to a mere Rs 1305 only including the extra charges applied. For fresh, exotic, authentic and scrumptious Chinese and Thai food, Chowman is a must visit for lovers or connoisseurs of Asian cuisine.

After hearing alot finally had the opportunity to visit this place, now it calls for a detailed review . 
 The first thing that impressed me was the d√©cor, loved those Buddha faces on the wall, the warm ambiance, oriental music in the background and chopsticks on the table ; they clearly haven't left any thing to be perfect ( at least close to it ) 
 The service was prompt, staffs were courteous. 
 Now the main part FOOD!!! 
We had a lot on our plate like literally 
Coriander burnt garlic rice : I wanted to begin with this as this caught my eyes on the menu first. The subtle flavor of coriander with burnt garlic created magic. 
Wok fried hakka noodles: as all of us you can never go wrong with this. The best thing I liked was the moist homely taste it had. 
Chilli garlic noodles: this is again another amazing dish that we tried. 
Kung pao chicken: 12 pieces in a bowl is clearly an amazing thing I say, tasted good too 
Devil's lamb: this was a spicy affair really. But the quality of lamb was really really good and cooked to perfection. 
Chicken in oyster sauce: this was taken to sooth our taste buds after the lamb. 
Sweet lime soda : I loved the presentation. Actually .
 The place is amazing, value for money  and deserves more visits. 
My verdict: a big thumbs up.

Came back to Kolkata after 2years and miss a lot of things from my previous city which is not here. One of them was a good Chinese restaurant I was fond of there. 
However chowman made up of that now. Quite good Chinese. I tried the Chopsey which was yummy. And prawn dish also good. One can also try for good pork there.

After all the amazing things I've heard about this place, I'd say I was pretty impressed still. 
Great quality, good quantity, great prices, amazing ambiance, reasonably fast service- all together a great place for a good meal!
I must say I was blown away by the authenticity and uniqueness of their taste, given the fact that most Chinese these days all taste the same. And all of it for an utterly reasonable price just makes it even better. Great place for family dinners or otherwise. Will definitely go back.

Went to Chowman for a team lunch and as usual, we were not disappointed. We were three of us. Had ordered the Lat Mai Kai as the starter. For mains we had the Singaporean mixed Meinfoon, Chilly Garlic Chicken in Red Bell Pepper. One of my team mates was vegetarian and he ordered the Veg Cantonese Noodles and requested it to buy fried a bit and exclude garlic and the restaurant was more than happy to oblige to his request. The manager was really courteous and visited every table from time to time to check if we were comfortable. All in all a great experience!!

Chowman is one of my most favourite resturants. I've been there more than 10 times. To be honest, i can't suggest any particular dish, as i have tasted many of the items and loved each and every one of them. Not only do they maintain quantity, they remarkably maintain the quality simultaneously. Definitely a happy place for chinese cuisine lovers. :)

Chowman is one of the authentic chienes restaurants in town. So our expectation was high from them. But after visiting to their place i might think twice before going again as i am very much fond of chicken preparation. For veg lovers the restaurant is heaven. We were confused between Chowman and Budha bites. But then we set our mind and 1st choice won. We ordered chilly paner, chispy chilli baby corn, drums of heaven, mixed fried rice, veg hakka noodles and mixed gravy noodles with garlic chicken. Quantity wise huge. One plate can be easily served to two people. I prefer veg items over non veg. I was dissapointed with drums of heaven. It was like someone sprinkle some masala over a coated bolied chicken. Baby corn was perfectly cooked,crunchy from outside and juice inside.aprt from drums of heaven all other dishes were good.

Warning! have at least an hours time if you are going on a Sunday. located in the food hub of salt lake - swimming pool. it has nice dimly lit ambience. sraffs are cordial. coming to the food we had:
starters:
*pepper garlic fish: if you are visiting this place then it is a must. it has a vert balanced taste and the fish quality is soooper.
*lat mai kai: decent
pepper chicken: usual and nothing special.

main course
*chowman special rice: spicy fried rice with a layer of egg. it also has ample pieces of chicken and prawns. one plate is enough for two people. tasted very good.
*kung pao chicken: very balanced taste
*fish in chilli wine sauce: white gravy and slightly sour but spicy. would be better with a regular fried rice.

not a cheap placr but considering the quality as well as quantity, its a muat try.

I am a regular visitor of Chowman Ballygunge and I am a great fan of the restaurant. The quality of food is exceptional and it is very reasonably priced. I was in Salt Lake 2days back and decided to go to the Salt Lake Chowman with family. We were 8 people including 2 kids. We had to wait for about 45 min before we got a table. When we went to the front desk ma√Ætre d' to enquiry about when we will get our table after waiting for 30 min as we had kids the answer was astounding he told us you all will have to wait and we can't confirm a time line. If we are not comfortable they can't help. So we waited. Food was as usual good that is why I am rating them 3. But service was pathetic. Salt Lake Chowman management team needs to look into it. I would rather go to BallygungeChowman than go to Salt Lake.

Food was very nice. Liked the Chilly garlic Fish and the Devils chicken. Though the Devil was too spicy, we enjoyed it.
Crispy chilly baby corn, Pan Fried Chilly Paneer & Burnt Garlic Rice were the other things we had. They were pretty much up to the good standards.
Special mention about the hospitality offered by the staffs.

Had been to this restaurant few months ago and trust me I don't have words to express how pathetic I felt after leaving this place. The food was not at all good, we ordered 2 chicken starters, one rice and one side dish and to our dismay nothing was good. Chilly chicken is something which even a roadside vendor can't go wrong with I'm sorry to say that chowman needs to improve a lot or else I don't think they'll survive for a very long time. The staff was very rude and not at all cooperative.  They need to improve a lot !! Not recommended at all.

Its nice. reasonably priced fine dining. Warm chinese decor and soothing ambience. with light chinese notes playing. food options are great. go try their smoked pork chilly and crab in garlic sauce. But all dishes seem to have salt in excess. Probably thats their recipe. Thats one drawback they need to work on. Otherwise its in one of my favortites list.

If you still have appetite after all this.. Choco brownie is not a bad bet here..

Serves the best Chinese in the neighborhood but quality of service is most unpunctual and sometimes downright irresponsible. I live one block away from the restaurant with a walking distance of less than 5 mins but still any kind of order takes well over an entire hour at any time of the day. Sometimes they cannot deliver an order due to unavailability but "accept" the order on the app yet don't inform the ordering company (Foodpanda, Zomato etc.) until I enquire about it - they just sit silent about it while I even after advance payment online have to sit hungry. This with the price of food being a premium even after online discounts. If a Chinese restaurant with even half as good food and variety opens nearby I would be strongly inclined to switch to it.

A must visit for Chinese cuisine lovers. Although, this was my fifth visit to this place and unfortunately the quality of food has not really been the same. The whole wow factor which I had on my first and second visits was kinda missing. Ah well, they have a wide selection to choose from and is definitely not gonna disappoint you. This time, we chose to stay with starters only. The pan fried chicken was pretty good, they kept it medium spicy as requested. The American pepper corn is a favourite, though it has become a bit dry from the one that my memory serves. Pepper fried crab was the winner of the evening. Perfect blend of spices and accompanied by the shell crackers. We ordered a sweet n salty lime soda , which was also good (most places don't get the sweet, salty n sour balance right, if you know what I mean). All in all, pretty good, will come back more with friends. Oh n yeah, most people might find this place a tad bit expensive, but I think it is a value from for money. The decor of the place was also nice I am the music definitely went with it.

A Chinese dinner date with my wife..opted for this as it was very near to my place and also had heard great feedback.
The ambience impressed me, was dimly lit, with a large Buddha statue in one of the section. The restaurant has been made out of the ground floor of an house, and the rooms have been converted into various sections of the restaurant.
The staff made us comfortable and helped us select a table not too near the air-condition.
The menu is quite elaborate with choices of Thai dishes thrown in. We ordered for chicken meatball soup and stir fried chicken in basil. The soup was good and the chicken was very tasty. The flavour of basil and garlic made a great combination. For mains, we ordered Chowman special noodle and Fish in sweet chilli sauce. The asked the waiter to not add prawns to the noodle though it was a part of the recipe. The noodle was quite good and the fish was very tasty.
The restaurant is a total value for money proposition. It's cheaper than most restaurants who serve similar food in a similar ambience. Quantity served per dosh is quite good. One dish can easily be shared between two or in case of medium appetite it can be shared between three. We had to ask them pack the remains of our stir fried chicken, noodles and fish. 
Liked the food immensely and is already shortlisted for our prospective lunch order when our friends come visiting us next week.

I am a frequent visitor of this branch of Chowman. I also went to their Ballygunge outlet once. Chowman never disappoints me. They have a wide range of starters, main course and desserts. Special mention : Double Fried Pork, Pepper Garlic Chicken, Konjee Crispy Chicken, Lat Mai Kai, Chicken/Pork in Oyster Sauce, Rice noodles of any style. Quite reasonably priced items comparing with the quantity they served. Ambience is great, the Buddha-statue, long hanging bells will make you feel a special Chinese atmosphere while you eat. The waiters are very courteous, humble, explains all the dishes thoroughly. So if you want to give treat or taste some good Chinese cuisine, you can always depend on Chowman. The mouthwatering, lip smacking dishes and the ambience will always attract the Chinese cuisine lovers.

Chowman is been one of my favourite Chinese restaurant from a long time.But I always used to opt for home delivery from them.

This is the first time I visited this place with a high hope of good food with my colleagues.

I really liked the d√©cor and ambience of this place.

We ordered couple of starters and main courses and those were very tasty as I expected.

I can confidently say that this is one of best Chinese restaurant in Kolkata and every time they prepares same tasty food.

I am sure I will order Chinese food many more occasions from them in future and also will try to visit them couple of times.

So if anyone is interested in having good authentic Chinese food at an affordable price then this is the best place to choose from.

Our table waiter had no idea wat we were ordering he forgot everythng wat we ordered but the food is quite good to make on that. Chowman special rice and some of the starters were very tasty

Well, Chowman is a familiar name for me when it comes to office get together lunch. Been here several times as it is in a walking distance from my office. So this is an altogether summed up review.

Located at Swimming Pool, a minute walk from the main road in the Dominos lane.

Ambiance is dark themed, Chinese language inscribed on walls with a huge Buddha face on the wall. Quite nice, I don't like the music they play along the theme, song Chinese tune. It gets annoying unless you are in a group. Again, a personal preference. Seating is good for couples and groups.

Staffs are gentle and polite, not in a hurry, careful about the orders placed. Once they misheard the order and replaced that immediately. Good one overall.

Food, the main part. The first thing you will notice an enchanting aroma over the foods. Every item is well cooked and tasty. The Chinese feel is greatly present. It means you will be certain in all your senses that indeed you are in a Chinese cuisine restaurant

I tasted Crispy babycorn, Stir fried chicken with basil, konjee crispy chicken, Lat mai kai and pan fried chilli fish among starters.

Chowman's special rice mixed fried rice, crab meat rice, sea food fried rice, chilli garlic rice, singapore noodles along with Chill chicken Devils chicken, devils lamb, and Hong Kong chicken are worth mentioning. Kung pao chicken felt pale. But Devils chicken, devils lamb catches the prize. Awesome to me.

Food is overall overall and within budget. If in a group sharing is possible as quantity is good.

For a good Chinese cuisine lover, its a joy treat. For others like me, its good food treat.

Chili chickn was tasty and nicely cooked. 
Mixed noodles was great.indeed.. 
But somehow i ddnt like the veg wok hakka noodles as i felt it was too dry.

Great food, great ambience. I've been there around twice, and have mostly ordered home. Food, of course, is great for someone like me who usually prefers a milder and tasty dish, with a bit of spice every now and then to mix things up. 
I'd recommend: 
Moon fan rice
Burnt garlic coriander n egg rice
Coriander fish
Fish in chilli mustard sauce
To be honest, the fish and the rice dishes are all excellent at this place. Can't say the same about the noodles, chicken and lamb though. I failed to appreciate the chicken and lamb mostly because of the rather chewy texture- seemed overcooked or maybe refrigerated for too long. Besides, I really missed the signature chowman light, breezy taste in those dishes. 
Loved the veg items. Haven't tried many, but the mixed veg and a paneer item were melt in the mouth. 
Iverall a great experience. Also, I must warn, avoid this place in the festive season. Too much rush and you will be handed platefuls of mostly uncooked ingredients. But if you are going for a nice dinner date and don't wish to burn a hole in your pocket, go for it. You'll love it.

Chowman has v consistent chinese food.i felt it was th best in and around saltlake.but of late i find some dishes are being cooked more like the small stalls n not in chowman's uniqie way.chilly chicken for eg, was a hearty dish with smaller pieces more in number without all those irritating onion capsicum slices overpowering the taste.now its a mash n indistinct from stall chilly chicken.their green curry is to die for as is the chicken in wine.

I came here for office lunch. Food was good, but our starters were served late. The feedback form has three categories - Best, Good and Average. I had marked Time taken to serve as Average, the waiter kept asking me the reason for my rating. He wouldn't leave our table, so I changed my rating. If YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE HONEST FEEDBACK FROM YOUR CUSTOMERS, THEN PLEASE DON'T ASK FOR IT! Please don't provide feedback forms for formality.

It was one of my friend who suggested this place and bought me here... The restaurant ambience is similar to what you get to see in a typical chinese restaurant with dim lit lights and a mild hummming song playing in the background 
Anyways the service was good and the staffs were knowledgeable too they let us know the quantity as well as what all variants will be of what sort when we got a bit confused in their noodles category 
The food was good as well and so was the quantity.... Service was prompt as well.... Will recommend this place whoever wants to have chinese food without burning a hole in their pocket and stayin in the vicinity of salt lake

Been there many a times and ordered many a times and Chowman never disappointed me.
Right from their soups, especially manchow soup, starters, especially the salt and pepper chicken to their pan fried chowmein which is topped with loads of prawn, chicken, eggs and veggies, everything is perfect.

The ambience as well as the staff both are good. Also the food is pocket friendly.

Located just near the swimming pool on saltlake, from karunamoyee, take the right turn to dcpl.. :)

Now ambiance is pretty good. Yes was lot of expectation from here. Main disappointment was really the time they took to serve the food.. It's take a long time.
We tried the following:

Wanton chichen soup.. It's good .. Pretty good
Drums of heaven.. Good.. Expected to be a litter btr :(
Chowman spcl noodle.. It's bang on in taste.. Superb in a word.. :)
Kung pao chicken.. Very disappointing.. We ordered the gravy one.. But it was not that good..

A mixed reaction actually.. Some dishes are that good.. But some are disappointing.

Cost: 1000 for two person

We visited this place on a busy Sunday evening and were relieved to have found a table! Three vegetarians in an authentic Chinese restaurant, we were surprised that this place had so much to offer! We ordered crispy chilli baby corn,manchow soup and sweet lime soda and for the mains we gorged on Shanghai noodles with Devils choice veggies. Were were impressed by the baby corn but the manchow soup tasted a bit bland.  The noodles with devils choice exotic vegetables was also satisfactory. The quantity and quality of food served was pretty decent. The staff was on their feet and listened to us patiently. The interiors are a tad bit stuffy but then it makes a cosy den for special conversations.

If u r luking for some economical chinese food, u r at the right place..n i underline the word economical.. the variety s gud..taste s above average.. But i wud call it, ' Poor man's Mainland China'..a striking thing about the place s its decor n ambiance..really liked d interiors though in d outside, it luks like just any other normal chinese joint.. So though i rate it 3.5 out of 5, i still say for authentic chinese taste, its Mainland China for me..

Sometimes ago, ordered food from CHOWMAN. Heard their name so many times, saw so many good reviews. But the food was simply disappointing. The crabmeat fried rice had a couple of small crabmeat pieces and was basically an expensive egg fried rice. Lachu lamb was not upto the simply because didn‚Äôt bring out the flavor of the lamb, and not the spices only. Szechuan Chcken Hakka Noodles was too dry and indifferent, with guest appearance of chicken. Overall, it was a disaster. ¬†Things were edible, only high point

I am guessing Calcutta Club Chinese is also serbed by Chowman . A very mixed experience here . 
The Chicken - Kung pao was a so- so one ; lacked in peanuts/ cashews which are usually given ; otherwise flavours - nice 
The rice ( vegetarian ) was a disappointment- too oily and the carrots seemed rotten ones , 
The prawn in hot garlic sauce ( customised to a non- gravy one ) turned out okayish flavour and spice wise ; but wish the prawns were cooked better . 
Overall - an okay - although would love to try again .

My recommendations based on various visits:

Moonfan fried rice(Must try!!)
Double roasted pork
Konjee crispy lamb
Hot garlic fish

The portions they serve is a lot and is worth the price.

Well, I never actually visited this place, but ordered for a delivery. So my review is restricted to their delivery time and food only.

Firstly, we received our delivery well before time, thanks to Chowman's time efficiency. The Second thing, which caught my attention, is their packaging. It was very well done, and to top it all, they had also provided ketchup and vinegar in separate containers, which was well packed. This is something which I never got to see in any other Chinese Restaurant till date in case of Delivery.

Now comes the food. We had ordered Cantonese Chicken Noodles, Wok Tossed Hakka Chicken Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice and Hunan Chicken. The staff was thoughtful enough to provide us a pair of Chopsticks, for the gravy Noodles. :-
) The quantity of the Noodles/Fried Rice is sufficient for two people, unless you have a big stomach or is utterly hungry. The Chicken Noodles/Fried Rice had generous amounts of Chicken and Egg in it. Very well cooked... Hunan Chicken was mildly spiced, as it is supposed to be. It was a side dish with shredded Chicken.

Overall, a thumps up for their food, packaging, and time efficiency. I would give a rating of 4 and not 5, so that I can leave some space for the ambience, staff behaviour rating next time when I actually visit the restaurant.

Ummm.... Where to start from? Mythical lions on the gate or the warmly welcoming host just behind the door? The interior design of the restro was indeed beautiful with the soft light and Chinese music üé∂ played in the background. Now coming to the food üòã. We ordered Lat mi Kai and roasted chilly pork for starters. The chicken delicacy was marvelous but the pork let us down because of its bland taste. For main course we ordered Moon fan fried rice , Chowman special rice, devil's chicken and kung pao chicken. Each of the dishes were great except for devil's chicken. It was overly hot for our taste buds. I am not complaining about that as it should be that hot as it is suggested by the name. We wanted Chinese desserts like honey glazed wanton but did not find those in the menu. Overall the food was good at a reasonable pocket pinch. I would definitely visit again. Last but not the least if I would have been given chopsticks to use,  I would have rated the restro a 5 star. I was a little let down by the change of table setup. But at the end a big thank you. I could have said arigato gozaimazou but that's Japanese üòú.

This is a restaurant with a pretty ambience.. But then there's a saying.. "Don't judge a book by its cover.." 
Starters in form of "Lat Mai Kai",  an improvised chicken fry was very average.. The roasted chili pork was a disaster.  The roasted pork of tibetan delight is half priced and tastes atleast 10 times better..
Now about the main course.. 
The Kung Pao chicken and the moon fan fried rice was awesome.. And the devil's chicken was BAD. 
Overpriced, Average food,  nice ambience. Chowman checked all the wrong notes. :(

Really one of the best Chinese food joints in Kolkata. What we tried? Chicken clear soup, chicken honey fried wanton (worth every penny!), roasted chili pork, konjee crispy chicken, moon fan fried rice (again a very distinctive taste), and devil's pork (that's too much devil's!). It gives a very unique experience, the whole restaurant. The service is good. Even for a small joint, they were able to manage a good crowd of 10-11 in one single place. But trust me, the food is good. One need to try all the dishes I just mentioned. I loved every one of them. the devil's pork is the best in my pick though. Also a must revisit will include honey fried wanton. Way to go!

Ordered a crab meat soup and mixed non veg Cantonese noodles online. The app showed 5 mins to close, but because of ease of ordering from the menu could do so in 2 mins flat. I was half expecting the restaurant to call saying sorry we are about to close etc etc ( in Salt Lake they don't like doing last hour deliveries ) but was pleasantly surprised when the confirmation call came promptly & the delivery was well in time. 

For Rs 421 it was a good value for money meal for two. The Cantonese noodles were bland. But then its Cantonese, and that's what the accompanying sauces are for.

Chowman, as a matter of fact comes with a pleasant surprise & will promise to want to go back for more. It is indeed one of the best places to have Indian Chinese (Not truly Authentic Chinese) to break the monotony of either expensive joints or roadside Chinese! Go with your all your friend, especially your enemies as will indeed enjoy the food & forget about the wrongs in life!

Nyc ambience and food... They do skimp on the amount of chicken, veggies etc. but taste is very nice. The staff in their eagerness to serve you better, tends to rush you! But, they were helpful when we asked for separate bills for takeaway and the food ordered on spot! 

Their meifoon is very nice, prawns had a nice taste and the momos had a nice smoky flavor! 

Overall a nice place to go if you are craving chinese in this locality!

Would have given 5 stars if we were to rate a restaurant on the quality of its food alone. The joint serves lovely vegetarian Chinese food. However, the ambience is quite okay and staff quite rigid. They were not willing to change anything from the menu tad little bit also. A simple request for some chopped onions also went unheard. Go here for food and food alone... the pocket pinch is not that big as well

In Saltlake area there are no other typical chinese restaurants. Their internal ambiance and location is very good. Whenever we ordered got disappointed with their main course. Their starter or soups are exceptionally good.
Must try their conzy crispy lamb if you visit them.

Being my first visit to this outlet after lots of good things about this chain..but it didn't disappoint...decor wise the Buddha murti on the inside and the art and music creates a Chinese feel .the seating arrangements is ample considering they have a strong take- away network.
Now coming to service and food , we ordered american chopsuey,double fried lamb,pan fried chicken ..the chopsuey was very good ,lamb was also tender and tasty ,the chicken was okayis ,could have been better with choice of sauce used ;but certainly not bad. All in all food quality was very good and service was very prompt and accurate . Cheers to chowman ..keep it up .

Amazing Chinese food... Awesome place for eating out, and is reasonably priced.. Impeccable ambience and flawless service.. Doesn't matter what you order, it will definitely be mouth watering :) We had the krispy konji chicken, the mixed rice noodles, crispy chilli baby corn, bhuna paneer and the shredded chicken... Every dish was worth it's price... Be aware of the amount though, cuz one serving was more than enough for two people in our case and we ended up having left overs... Highly recommended restaurant :)

Ambience wise excellent.The decorations are good and brings a feel that You r somewhre near China especially the Buddha statue .700 for two written here is without taxes would round upto 900 including taxes if not more.The staffs have a good sense of hospitality.In a phrase this place is "all in one" kind :) Would love to visit again.

I had gone with take away from this outlet. First and foremost i would like like to appreciate their hospitality and quick response to their customer. It took 30 mins to reach my home and surprisingly food was still hot. Now coming with the taste and quality it was quite satisfactory. I ordered mixed fried rice and chowman special rice, the second one was bit spicy but mixed rice was too good to taste added with a good Chinese aroma. Chicken Manchurian was also upto level. Altogether i want to go there again..

Like I wanted non-spicy gravy noodles..so they made it as i wanted.if you ask for different flavour they will do so.it is applicable to other dishes as well.

Chowman was a great experience. It's been around a month since I went there but I still have the aroma and the taste on my taste buds that I'm coming back here to review it.
The service was good. The ambience up top for a Chinese restaurant , with the appropriate music and the typical chopsticks kept on your tables. And the food inexplicable. 
I've lately become really fond of Chinese food and this place is surely responsible for the same!

Heard about this place from many,but did not have the oppurtunity to go till now.I ordered a Chowman speacial noodles via Swiggy.The food was impressive.They serve the noodles with an omlette.Good chunks of chicken and shrimps in there.Not oily at all.
I tasted the crab meat rice and the lamb in oyester sauce.The rice was not that appealing.Boiled rice and only 2 to 3 pieces of small crab and filled with eggs.The lamb was in generous portions,nice sauce and soft lamb.Preffered if there were no coating of cornflour on the lamb though.

As the name suggests this is a nice destination for foodie's looking for Chinese cuisine. The interior is quite attractive with dim but adequate lighting. Staffs are very courteous & eager to serve. We had Drums of Heaven & Double fried pork as starters and both were quite good . The DOH comes with Szechuan Sauce and it tasted heavenly. Pork too was nicely cooked . In the main course we had Mixed Pan Fried Noodles with gravy which was really praiseworthy & Veg Szechuan Fried Rice which was up to the mark. Chicken in Black Bean Sauce was mildly spicy & tasty while Lamb in Orange Sauce was on the sweeter side. Overall nice eating experience & quite pocket friendly too. Last but not the least , unlike some other restaurants, the washroom was nice & clean adding to the feel good factor.

Wanted to get a home delivery done to our place but they said that we have to place a min. Order of ‚Çπ1000. So we had to go all the way to sector 1 as we really wanted to try out chow man. Must say the interiors were quite like mainland China, especially the main entrance. Food was ok but what made me give them 2.5 was their service which was very bad. The waiters had no idea of the food they were serving and took wrong orders as well.

the interiors and ambience is too good. the dim light and subtle music adds on to the solace and calmness. The food as all knows is no doubt good. the starter as well as the side dish (schezwan chicken) were too good. but we didnt like the main course rice ( shanghai rice). it was totally tasteless. apart from that the overall experience was good.

PS- loved their "heart shaped" spoon <3 :)

To start with, this place has got an awesome peaceful ambiance, just the way I think a Chinese joint should be. The place is bit dimly lit that gels so well with the decor. Being an art lover myself, I would say this interior decor should be the model for any upcoming Chinese joint, it's a great source of inspiration for someone willing to setup one such joint.

This is the place to be! Be it the decor, the ambiance or the quality of food, they've got it all right. I'm in love with the low key lighting! It's close to the swimming pool in BF block and we reached there in no time! Service could have been better! Order your main course with the starters since they take a lot of time in bringing the food! If you're looking for authentic Chinese, this is the place to be!

Been here many times. Food is of very good quality and service is very good. Price is also fine.

Speciality is the starters.

Just one complaint, the noodles need to be better. I mean most of the different types of noodles taste the same in Chowman. Could do better with variety in taste.

Overall very good resturant, recommendable to chinese lovers :)

The location isn't that prime though, it was a little hard to find and we had to ask a lot. Recommended to anyone who wants quality Chinese cuisine at a more or less reasonable price.

Unlike its tollygunge branch ,this branch has a decent sitting arrangement.
We ordered Meat ball soup,drums of heaven,mixed fried rice and hong kong chicken.
I felt all the dishes lacked flavour. üòï
Service is nothing great to talk about.
I love how the music is played ever so lightly.
Decor is great,they have maintained the theme of this place in every possible way.
Price is on the mid range. (Neither high nor low).
I'll revisit though.

Location : not so difficult to find. apt location
Courtesy: the staff and the waiters were very courteous
Food : we took crispy chilli baby corn,Ba mee (thai noodles), & chicken with chilli wine.
The crispy baby corn was good to taste. crispness was apt.It was very delicious.
I am novice in Thai food but the bee we was of different but good taste with betel leaves on it. The aroma and taste was very good. It was little spicy, may be people who don't spicy at all should not take it.
Chicken in chilli wine was also good but infront of the bee we is was not able to bring out its flavour.
Overall delicious food.
Cost : very pocket friendly. can cost around 900-1000 for two. cause any dish is of such a quantity, its not possible for one to finish if off. Two can easily share a dish.
Ambience: very nicely decorated with slow music.
Overall nice restaurant to go with friends or some one special(He or she will be impressed ;-) ) . Family dinner is also not a bad idea.
Worth trying more than once.

Pepper garlic prawn
Barbeque chicken
Chowman's special rice
Chilli wine Fish
All the dishes were good and served in good proportions. Personally I found the prawn to be the best among starters and the rice was also good. Coming to the decor the place is dimly lit with oriental music playing in the background. Quite spacious with a nice ambience and good food this is a place one must visit for good chinese food when their tummy craves for it üòã

Sunday afternoon with friends and I couldn't help but call up chowman for the purpose and they didn't fail me again....Cantonese noodles , burnt garlic coriander fried rice , chilli garlic noodles really made me fall in love with chowman again....teriyaki chicken is a mist try for all..the dressing topped with sesame seeds added an extra glory to the dish...mandarin fish was good ..and my all time favourite prawn in red pepper sauce was really up to the mark...Not only the food was good and brought smile to our faces but yet again it proved to be pocket friendly...only thing that makes me rethink about order is that they do not serve an order less than 1500 for delivery....

Has been a regular to this joint for quite some time now, however the recent experience is not so good. The food quality is inconsistent , same dish would be great at one time and below average the next. In my last visit a few weeks back, the pork and the pan fried noodles was a showdown .. The pork pieces were not that great and it missed the caramelised soya flavour typical to chilli pork. The pan friend lacked the flavour too, these two were the stars during our last visit. Will not give more than 3 unless they bring in more consistency to their cooking standards.

I have tried crispy chilly baby corn, double fried pork, konjee crispy chicken, lat Mai Kai, veg Manchurian, mixed veg with babycorn and mushrooms, chowman's special rice (there was nothing special about it), chicken fried rice (this one is better), hakka noodles, oyster chicken with vegetables, hunan chicken and Cantonese noodles.

Being close to my house, its been a frequent option for dining out with my family and friends . The interior is well decorated keeping in mind the chinese theme.
Over the many visits I ve tried pan fried chilli chicken, fried chicken wantons, konjee crispy lamb, pepper garlic prawns, prawn seong, mixed hakka noodles as well as mixed meinfoons, honey chilli pork, fried chilli pork, devil's lamb and lamb in oyster sauce.
Of the starters the pan fried chilli chicken is worth mentioning. They provide generous amount of chicken pieces in a delicious tangy sauce. The prawn dishes are also tasty. However, I have always found the lamb starter to be chewy here. Honey chilli pork is a bit too sweet though they mention that while placing the order. Fried chilli pork is quite good on the other hand.
Considering the price they charge its a nice restaurant of choice.

Visited last night with 2 friends.. This is the 1st time i visited any outlet of Chowman. Ambiance and decorum was good and well maintained. Stuffs are courteous and very helpful. Coming to the food, we ordered crispy chili baby corn and crispy cronjee lamb for starters. baby corn was pretty good and tasted nice. The lamb was pretty tough though crunchy. We didn't like it much. This dish is prepared the best in Bar-b-q restaurant. Though it tasted good the hard lamb pieces made it quite difficult to chew. For main course we ordered wok tossed hakka noodles, fried rice, teriyaki chicken and fish on oyster sauce. Both noodles and rice tasted good, and there was sufficient amount of chicken shreds in it. Teriyaki chicken was the best of the lot. It had a tangy flavor and tasted awesome. But didn't like the fish in oyster sauce at all. It was very very bland in taste. The gravy was like a thick soup without any salt or pepper or any spice in it. The fish tasted good though.Lastly, coming to the service, it was pretty fast. I was surprised to see how they served freshly prepared dishes in such pace. The waiters are very nice as well. They are helpful from the beginning and will give you a cosy and comfortable environment to enjoy your food. They served each and every dishes not only once, but whenever even one of us had our plates empty, they were appearing to serve more food keeping an eye on us! This is not seen in most of the even top restaurants in Kolkata and earned an extra 0.5 rating from me ;-)¬†
Over all a nice experience. Would surely visit again as the main outlet is near my home only in Bhowanipore :-)

We had ordered Devil's exotic vegetable which was so spicy (jhal) that we could not eat it though we eat spicy food. The level of spice was not mentioned by the person taking the order which would have warned us. The Chicken in oyster sauce was a reddish gravy and no taste of oyster was available. It was like a normal gravy with no special notes.
Even the Shrimp fried rice was bland. The quantity was ok compared to the price. But the food was not as per expectations.  The service was in time and food was delivered hot.

It was warm and welcoming.

Food: ordered Chicken in Basil which was awful and tasted as stale.
Pan fried fish was good rather the best.
Then we ordered Golden Fried Prawns which was completely awful, we just could not eat. Then the manager came and told that he would change and then he gave us prawn pepper salt, which did not have salt and was dipped in oil. 
Then for the main course we had ordered chowman special noodles and fish in wine sauce,it was good the noodles was awesome as the name suggest.
Overall the service need to improve and change drastically and the food quality making it with less oil. 
Thank you, hope to see some changes soon.

The most satisfying thing about dining here is that no matter what you order, the waiters always serve you quality. Chowman stands out when it comes to good food on a standard budget. It is almost impossible to fault them in terms of food quality and service -- the waiters do an incredible job!

I've dined at this outlet of Chowman twice, and I can't remember tasting a bad mouthful of food. From every grain of rice to every strand of noodle, everything is spot on! Their Lemon Pepper soup is absolutely fantastic -- clear as day and the prawn they serve are beautiful! As much as I love a good bowl of soup, the real star of the show is their Signature Noodles, which I will say, gives restaurants of good repute like Mainland China a run for their money.

I haven't had the opportunity to taste their crab, because I always end up ordering lamb and pork -- which I do not regret one bit.

Perhaps the only fault I can muster up is with the lighting. Decor is good, their cutlery and crockery are polished, but their lighting falls a little short for my liking. Maybe it's done for colour allure -- increase appetite and all that jazz. It works.

In conclusion, Chowman is my go to restaurant for Chinese -- nothing else in the same price range comes close! Do not miss out!

Thanks for readings and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made. :)

Wow!!!  Lovely!!!  If you. can't afford to go Mainland China always,must visit this pure Chinese food joint. Tried to eat with chopsticks, awesome experience. Rating of quality n quantity... 8 on 10. Rating of ambience 8 on 10 though less light for taking pictures. I loved the black Buddha statue n pure Chinese music so much. Took mango juice for starter,then mushroom soup, american chopsey,mixed schezwan fried rice n sweet n sour fish. Couldn't even imagine price wouldn't reach to rs 900. For the moderate rate n very good Chinese food,its a WOW restaurant.   Must visit for Chinese food lovers.

Ordered for a delivery. Service was fast. Food was hot. Quality and quantity was great. We had ordered for manchow in soup with fried noodles. American corn pepper salt in starters( pepper was too much). Haka noodles, schewan rice, and manchurian in main course. They also provided Chilli sauce and Chilli vinegar, which is not provided in other delivery of restaurants. American corn was little soggy. 
Most of the times I have the outlet, but thought to order for lunch today.

Chowman! I am a self-confessed non-lover of Chinese cuisine. But things have reached a stage where I have to admit Calcutta has converted me. Chowman only added to that. The crispy noodle salad had it all; crunch, freshness, tang. I could have had another plateful. The egg fried rice and broccoli corn in garlic sauce were both good; more so, the rice. While the sauce was a little weak, it was loaded with veggies. Points for that. Candied walnuts and ice cream for dessert. Candied nuts, what can go wrong! It was a great finish. 

Ambience ‚Äì fully committed to the theme yet low key. Nicely done.¬†Service - super quick.

They serve a huge quantity and considering the quality and quantity, the price is moderate. Their service is also note worthy. 
A highly recommended place if you want to have Chinese.

CHOWMAN is where I go for morning walk 4/5 days a week. Often thought of visiting the restaurant for dinner. But missed every opportunity for some reason or the other. 

Yesterday, we finally decided to go for home delivery. Ordered for¬† 2 plates of Wok Tossed Hakka Noodles Mixed and 1 plate of Chilli Chicken Dry. It was delivered exactly at the time I asked for it. The bill amount was Rs. 646.00. But I swear ; I never ate so tasteless Chinese food anywhere in the country. Let alone Kolkata, the city that prepares the best Chinese in India. 

To be honest, there was nothing Chinese about it but for the looks. The heavenly aroma, that you get even in the Chinese food available on the streets of Kolkata - was completely absent. It tasted more or less like home made atta noodles prepared by someone in a hurry. Though it had plenty of boiled pieces of chicken and a couple of prawns as well, there was hardly any vegetable in it. No wonder, it was flavourless. To be frank, we couldn't do justice to even half of the quantity delivered. 

As regards the Chilli Chicken, well, this too disappointed us.¬† From outside, the chicken pieces looked identical. Taste wise, they didn't.¬† No semi fried vegetables like capsicum or onion slices...nothing...absolutely nothing. At least, nothing was visible. 

All that @ Rs. 646.00, in Kolkata, is high by any standards. 

But as I told you, the delivery was bang on time. And the packaging was also as good as it could be.

Loved the ambience and food here. Good food and great staff service at a very reasonable price. One can take a note of this place for trying out good chinese cuisine. We had ordered for lemon coriander soup, steamed wantons, spring rolls, American chopsuey, pan fried noodles, schezuan style mefoon, 3 side dishes each of chicken, fish and prawn and darsan for desserts. Every item served was excellent in taste. Surely looking out for another visit.

We had roasted chilli pork which was a recommendation of the manager and pan fried chilli chicken. Both the dishes were delicious. For main course we ordered chowman special fried rice and chicne in red bell pepper. superb i must say. The quantity is very good and the pricing is so reasonable. Total value for money.

In main course american chopsuey was excellent. It was good in all measures. The paneer was also very good. Foods were medium spicy .¬†
The ambience was good. Soft music and proper service won my heart. Would love to visit again.

Located behind my house it offers excellent cuisine ,great hospitality and friendly guidance on what to order and what not to when children and the elderly are around. Great value for money . Only negative is that it hurts the pocket since it can turn out to be a weekly affair being located on my backdoor :) . The signoff sweetmeat makes it particularly a great draw with children.

Located in the middle of a quiet neighbourhood, Chowman Salt Lake drew me towards it for a hearty delicious Chinese meal on an ordinary autumn night. We ventured into the Crabmeat rice, which did not let us down, then the famous Pan fried Chilli Fish, (which is a speciality here in my opinion!) and the Chicken in Chilli Wine. The food here is not too spicy or oily, yet the taste is never compromised with. The ambience is as usual serene and peaceful. Hoping to visit there soon.

This was my second visit in chowman as last time I went for a take away. I will not be much elaborate rather concise.
1. Ambience is excelleant, perfect for a nice dinning after a tired working day.
2. Authentic Chinese dishes at their best.
3. Quantity is well enough.
We ordered soups, fried chiken, prawns , fries rice, gravy noodles, chilli garlic crab, kung pao chiken, lamb.
Among all the dishes every thing was perfect except the lamb which should have been better.
But overall it's quite good.
I will give a big thumb up to chowman.

Chowman the restaurant I have been waited for to taste, it's 10 minutes from my house. Though I had ordered for home delivery but the decor was nice. I ordered chiken noodles and chilli garlic with bell paper, noodle was good and side dish was regular spicy . Quality of chiken was soft, but nothing extra ordinary to my mouth.
I wish to visit there again.

Well... If you are ever coming to Chowman...Never EVER order Prawn Wontons....They use minced prawn and that too just like 1 teaspoon of it... And the worst part.. They don't even mention the use of minced prawn in their Menu.. So it is quite actually cheating...They should pay major attention towards their transparency towards the customers.. The other food items were quite good ..The overall experience was good !
Okay.. My 2nd visit onwards... I have been treated to some amazing food and the customer service has improved by miles !! My thoughts about this restaurant has changed and it has become one of my favorite restaurants in town ! Great job Team Chowman !! Keep it up !!

Went to this outlet once for dinner with high expectations after reading the reviews. But was quite dissatisfied. We had ordered chicken Taipei and honey prawn wantons and sweet corn soup for starters. The chicken item didn't taste good.. It was salty. And the wanton was one disaster. The taste of honey was not going good with the prawn inside and also the amount of prawn stuffing was quite less. In the main course we took Hakka noodles and hot garlic chicken. Hot garlic chicken was OK. Didn't like the noodles at all. It tasted bland and did not have any flavors. We were quite happy after entering the restaurant for its beautiful ambiance but the food was the big let down.. After all in a restaurant the food mainly matters.

Location- near baishakhi salt lake sector 1. Not so far from ultadanga..take an auto from ultadanga. Stopage is Baishakhi..from there u have to walk for 5 min..
Restaurant- the atmosphere of the restaurant is very good. Well decorated well management well behaved staffes. Sitting arrangements are also nice in view wise. They can easily beat any park street restaurant by their management. Truly. Am not joking at all.
Food- I tried Chicken Wanton soup as starter. Then we orderd Chowman Special Fried rice (mixed with chicken fish prawn pork egg mashroom vegetables etc) and Chilli Wine fish.
Food quality and quantity is good. Taste is obviously very nice. Soup is good lyt juicy. But watons r not too soft.
Main course are good in quantity. Thet serve an omlet with rice. Wine fish is very good in taste. But one thing they serve basa fish..why not original vetki? This question is for management.
Cost- for two 700 is ok.
Oh ya one thing that I lyk most they serve chop sticks :) :)

went there on the 7th day (saptami) afternoon of durga puja 2015. and was disappointed to have to wait for quite a long time in the queue. i was impressed by the decor and ambience of the place with small lights here and there.¬†

we were 4 friends and we ordered a pork dish (which turned out to be awesome), manchurian chicken, 3 mixed fried rice, 1 hakka noodle, 1 lamb dish. regarding the lamb dish we were quite confused what to take as none of us had tasted lamb before and the waiter suggested us a certain dish (whose name i have forgotten) but the dish turned out to be too sweet and orangish colored (tasted a bit like firecrackers chicken) and we couldnt eat it ravishly as we hated the taste.¬†

i must talk about the quantity though. first we ordered 2 mixed fried rice, and we were served 1 bowl of rice. the rice was for the 3 of us, and we ate it all and was waiting for the 2nd bowl of rice, when the waiter informed that the 1st bowl contained 2 rice amounts!!! we were disappointed by the small quantity they serve and had to order for the 3rd bowl as we were still half hungry. :(

As someone who is not a big fan of the Chinese cuisine, Chowman turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The d√©cor and the overall ambience was soothing and somehow, authentic. The service was prompt (probably coz it was a weekday) and the food was delicious. All in all, one of the better Chinese places I've been to.

Visited this place with my family on a Sunday Evening. 
Firstly we were told to wait for 2 minutes which turned out to be equivalent of more than half an hour. Upon entering,to our surprise we found empty tables to which we were not made to seat beforehand. Upon questioning the management they gave a lame excuse that since we are 4 we can't provide you a seat of 6,I mean they can accommodate 5 in a table of 4 but not 4 in a table of 6.
This is gross negligence of customer value. Those few tables (4-5) remain unoccupied before we entered and during the time we ate our dinner. This is not at all acceptable and more so when only 2 groups(including us) we were outside. Not that we would have sat on the table for 2 hours and kept it occupied.
This is highly inappropriate and a set back for the great quality of food they serve!

It is commendable that even during such maddening rush they maintained the same level of hospitality and food taste. The staff were extremely courteous and even patiently helped us select our items. The food was as usual delicious.. no complaints at all... ¬†Chowman is the place you can trust over and over again and will not be disappointed.

Highly Recommemded!! :)

This joint of chowman located near swimming pool block of Salt Lake City. The restaurant is not huge in terms of seating capacity & that's why queuing time is quite long if you visit in any weekends or holidays. 

I have visited this restaurant during Durga puja ostomi in recent times & it's my 2nd visit to the chowman brand. What I find that they are not serving proper quantity of their regular dishes during Durga puja. It might be their strategy to earn much during this peak season. We have ordered special chowman Hakka rice which is quite less in quantity despite of the fact we have ordered 3 portion. And then the main course side dish of chilli garlic chicken in red bell pepper sauce was also not as expected in terms of the size of chicken in it. The taste of the food is good. And the service & ambience is also good. 

I would suggest them  to take care of their quantity at the time peak season as the regular customer also visit at that time & if they found the quantity is not matching with the regular one, they will come to know about their strategy to earn more by somehow misleading the customers.

One suggestion, maybe, you should keep arrangements for group dining. I went with family on Mahalaya and got a table for 8 while on Shasthi, I was shocked when they couldn't arrange for 12 people to sit together. Disheartening. I felt bad cause I was the one who suggested this restaurant. Conduct could have been better.

I went here on a busy nabami evening with family.With warm ambience and dimly lit interiors this place welcomes you.

We ordered :

Starters:

Lemon Pepper Chicken Soup : clear soup which definitely did justice to our appetite.

Pepper Garlic Fish :They served Basa fish but it was mouth watering. Amazingly cooked fish which melts in one's mouth.

Stir Fried Chicken with Basil : Slightly stiff chicken ,but the dish was tasty.

Mushroom Pepper Salt : another amazing dish, soft mushrooms with a fried coating ... a must have.

Main Course

Mixed fried rice : could do with a little more seasoning ....

Pan fried mixed noodles : this dish had a lot of shortcomings . With hardly any seasoning ... the noodles had no taste whatsoever .

Roasted Chilli lamb : a crispy chinese dish which deserves a second helping.

Pan fried Chilli chicken : A complete disappointment with stiff chicken and sorry taste.

On the whole we left the place with mixed feelings, whie some dishes were amazing ,others disappointed us .

Please look into this matter and ensure a standard which matches the price charged.

We agreed thinking they dont have any option,but after entering the resturant we saw a table for 8 person & they were almost finish. So we asked the manager to shift us to that table. Supprisingly the peraon was very rude and asked us to leave the resturant if we dont want to seat in 2 seperate table. Disgusting. Would suggest the owner to be more carefull before hiring this kind of stupid mannerless managers. 

P.s: The food was just awesome. So rating it 4 Star.

I never went there but once I was planning for my B'Day treat and I ordered Szechuan Noodles and Chilli Chicken from Chowman salt lake.

I must say it was really tasty and good in quantity. They sais one plate of noodles is enough for one but I found that one plate can be shared by two. and 12 pieces of chicken in one chilli chicken plate.¬†

Good food and good quantity.

My first visit here. The ambience was good, calm and soothing. The service was good, waiters were friendly. I ordered the thai noodles along with chilli chicken. The portions were gernerous, no complains there. The noodles were slightly over seasoned. Overall, a nice experience.

So,finally I got a chance to visit this place today after a lot of plans being made. I visited this place with four of my friends and gave my long due birthday treat here. We reached here at 2:40 and had to wait for around 10 minutes owing to the queue. We soon got a place and the staff made quick arrangements for a table of five which was impressive. The decor is pleasing to the eyes with soft Chinese music in the background. I loved the Laughing Buddha they placed at the entrance and sculptures of the Buddha on the walls. They added to the ambience all the more.

Coming to the food,we ordered mushroom in pepper salt and barbecue chicken as starters and both pleased our taste buds. We then ordered Chinese chopsuey, button mushroom and baby corn and spicy garlic chicken in red pepper sauce as sides along with wok tossed hakka noodles and schezwan rice. The fooding experience was really nice! Chowman definitely provides its customers a mind-blowing fooding experience and goes with its tagine 'think Chinese..think Chowman.'

The prices are decent and our bill was around 1723 INR for 5. I loved the sweetners they offered at the end of the meal and also those lovely chopsticks! *heart*
The only drawback was that the place is a bit clumsy and the crowd is bit noisy but all of that can be forgotten when the food is so gooood. :P

Coming back soon!

If one is looking for delicious Chinese food with flamboyant Chinese ambience then Chowman is the desired destination.Situated in the heart of SaltLake this is the must visit for every Chinese food lover.From the statue of Lord Budha, the background music to the splendid Chinese wall hanging, this place has an aura of its own.

Amongst the variety of food it provides Crispy Honey Fried Wantons are a must try(P.S- If you have a fetish for Bengali sweets, then this might remind you of 'JIBHE GOJA')We had Soup, Crispy Honey Fried Wantons, Chowman Special Noodle( another must try), Corainder Rice( we didnt like it much though) , Manchurian Chicken and Lemon Fish.
The waiters were also very friendly and surely I cannot find a reason to not visit this place again.~Cheers :)

I was here today for lunch. For starters we ordered prawn ka seong, it was awesome to say the least. In the mains we had pan fried mixed noodles and chicken in chili wine sauce. Both were good, in good taste and quantity. The ambiance is also nice.
To top it all, the service was not bad at all.
Overall a good experiance, will be back here again.

At last I have visited the place but not at all impressed with the food quality and behaviour of the staffs. Staffs are confused and also they make customer more confuse. We were repeatedly asked by our option of water again the same happened in choice of soups. Though decor is very impressive but not reflected same over the food quality. 
We have ordered different dishes of chicken but almost they taste same. I am not satisfied with the food quality also.

Comfortably tucked into Salt Lake's BF block, Chowman offers some delicious Chinese food at very reasonable prices. I had visited the place for a family lunch. The place wasn't too crowded and we got a table immediately.

With the dimly lit interiors, the pentatonic music playing in the background, the various images of Buddha and the meticulously layed table with the spoon and fork on either side of the plate and the chopstick behind, it was a very inviting ambience.

We ordered fresh lime sodas and a crispy chilli baby corn for appetizers. The cool,fizzy soda with just the just balance of salty and sweet was delicious. The appetizer, with its crisp, tangy, flavour packed nuggets of corn, were a perfect way to start the meal.

Not being much of a fan of gravy dishes, we decided to go for 3 stir-fries from the starters section along with Chicken Hakka Noodles for the main course. The noodles were quite disappointing, it was bland and clearly overlooked. Among the sides, the barbeque chicken seems overly sweet and had a flavour of ghee which did not seem to go well with the rest. But the other two dishes were absolutely delicious. The pan fried chilli fish with its delicate, fall-apart pieces of fish and the salty, savoury double fried pork were incredible.

I had never had a proper Darsaan before, and when I was told it was on the menu, I jumped at the opportunity, and boy did it deliver! Crisp fried flat noodles tossed in honey and sesame served with cool, smooth vanilla ice cream. There was nothing over-the-top about ice cream itself but with the combination of the cold, smooth ice cream with the warm, crisp noodles and the delicate flavour of honey and vanilla, the meal could not have ended on a better note.

The dishes themselves are plated on beautiful curved plates, adorned with flowers made out of vegetable carving, which looked beautiful. I particularly liked the idea of serving the end-of-meal refreshments in a fancy wooden box, a beautiful touch indeed. 

The staff was extremely courteous all the way through. The helped choose the dishes and served the food whenever asked, with a smile on their face.

Overall, it was a wonderful experience. Whether to have their pork or darsaan for another time or to try out some new dishes from their menu, I will be coming back to this place time and time again. A must visit in my opinion for all Chinese food lovers.

I have been in many places but it's just the best place for Chinese and Thai food in salt lake area. It's not once but I have been here many times since my first visit. May it be colleague , friends or family , best place to have a fine dining was always Chowman . Nice ambience , the dishes I liked most are sea food soup , I always ask for a second bowl if having 1/2. Chilli pork, not a big fan of having pork but this one is just irresistible. Cantonese is my all time favourite. Conclusion is just one word q«êng m√†n y√≤ng ( Have it slow ) and enjoy the ambience as well.

Im writing this review after my third visit to the salt lake outlet of chowman. Each time i have been here i have been pleased with the food and satisfied with every other thing.
The decor is purely eastern, with two dimly lit sections and oriental music setting the mood.
On my third visit we had the following: pan fried fish, pepper garlic chicken, hong kong chicken, chicken fried rice and chicken moon fan rice. The pan fried fish although red was not tangy, and just the right amount salty and crispy. The fish was fresh. Both the chicken dishes were tasty but i liked the dry pepper garlic chicken more although the hong kong chicken was equally good in its own right. The presence of star anise in a majority of their dishes adds a very authentic flavour. The moon fan rice had the typical aroma that moon fan rice has, nothing special. The lime soda however was flawlessly made, being perfectly sweet and salty.
I have no complaints about the service and the prices are actually not exorbitant considering the quality and quantity of food.
Chowman offers decent Chinese cuisines, something which varies from typical china town Chinese without burning a hole in the wallet.

Visited for lunch, enroute to the airport, so I can authoritatively say that waiting time for food is ridiculous. Irrespective of what you order, don't expect it before 30 minutes.
For food, ordered a single serving of chix momos, steamed, one serving of crab meat in ginger wine sauce, and prawn hakka noddles to go with it. Absolutely marvellous, with generous portion sizes. The momos, however, were just fine. Will recommend for the seafood, over the oriental.
Ambience is purposefully darkened, with hues of red, a la stereotypical Chinese.

Have tried this place a couple of times but honestly I am disappointed. The recent experience was of today and it was so pathetic, I am literally compelled to write it down right now.

Called up the restaurant to place a Take-Away order. I was told that they do not accept take-away order over the phone. One needs to come down and do it in person. It failed my logic why would a restaurant do so and cause inconvenience to their customers and make them wait for 20-30 minutes minimum to get their order.

Reached the place and ordered for a Chilli Garlic Noodles (Mixed), Pan Fried Chilli Chicken and Drums of Heaven. The order was delivered in half an hour approx. While, I didn't mind the waiting time, it was one of the food item that disgusted me to the core. While the Noodles was decent, the Pan Fried Chilli Chicken was a complete disaster. In no way, did it look like 'Chilli Chicken' in the first place, rest alone it being Pan Fried. It was tossed in some other sauce. The Chicken was hard and cold. So hard, that I couldn't even bite into it with my teeth. The entire dish was soggy indicating that a refrigerated product has been served on the payment of some 195 Rs. + VAT. I could get a much decent Chilli Chicken from my local market at one-third of the price (Minus embarrassment in front of my family members)

The Drums of Heaven was on the decent side with it actually being close to be a Chilli Chicken sorta thing. It was accompanied with onions and capsicum. Honestly, I have never seen this particular dish being served with Onions and Capsicum ever before. A new experience for me. But then, it was the only dish which could compensate for the not-so-good Chilli Garlic Noodles and the catastrophic Pan Fried Chilli Chicken.

Going by some of the past reviews, this restaurant seems to have a history of serving stale and cold food to its customers. If this is what you guys are inclined to do, please mention it in your menu card crystal clear. ¬†There is no point in spending the hard earned money to get third graded food.¬†

@ the Management: Please do not come up with your standard reply, as I have seen earlier in most of the reviews, saying how sorry you are and you would look into this mistake. Clearly you do not. So, the next time you serve stale food to someone, tell him/her in the face that you are not going to serve them fresh food.

Really heard good reviews about the place so went to give it a try!!! Really nice ambience gives u a feeling of a very premium place...  The soup was stupendous and starters and drinks were perfect but the sore point was the rice... The rice had some sort of dirt in it it wasn't washed properly I guess on complaining the manager gave us an explanation that it is imported from Japan and it is supposed to be like this... We r such educated fools from a village who will eat shit if it is imported... Sorry but really disappointed by such stupid reasoning I have been to Japan and they don't eat dirt with rice... The worst experience I cud have at first visit.. Don't think I am going there any time sooner..

CHOWMAN stands as my favourite chinese destination in the city, and this outlet has the advantage of being spacious and larger than the other ones. The warmth , service , decor , the lovely chinese instrumentals and most importantly the food is as good as the the ballygunge counterpart which i savoured few times.
We had ROASTED CHILLI PORK which was an amazing starter , probably one of the best pork dishes i had . i also recommend to try their pan fried chilli fish which was terrific good the last time. We skipped the regular noodles and fried rice , and went for FISH IN CHILLI MUSTARD SAUCE with MOON FAN RICE
This was altogether a new combination , the star anise and five spiced flavoured rice was pretty nice to taste with the pungent¬† chilli mustard gravy , cleansing our palate several times with the freash lime sodas in between .
p.s. the washrrom is also done keeping the typical chinese concept in mind. some clicks attached as well.

one word for chowman - BEAUTIFUL .

I have heard a lot about this place. This was my first visit. The food is good and reasonable. Each of the items are unique and one can differentiate the taste. The quantity is good enough for two people. The menu card is filled with variety. Any fish lover who has allergies to prawns can opt for fish. The quality of every ingredients is notable. I personally liked the prawn pepper salt. The food were beautifully decorated. No chance of disliking anything about it.

Ambience is soothing with Chinese instrumental being played. Making it more China. The interior is filled with Chinese decor. No chance of missing out the chopstick. The service is good. They has been available to serve the food. A good place for family outing. I would love to prefer going to this place again and again.

P.S.If you are a chinese connoisseur like me mate then you may feel a bit disheartened.

Spiritual place to indulge yourself in typical Chinese and Thai food. The decor, service and the ambience lives to the expectation. Try the Hot and sour Soup or the Wanton soup. Apart from the regular starters Fried Tofu in Hong Kong Sauce is a must try. Moreover dig in for some Thai main course like Baa Mee together with a gravy side dish like Bean Curd ( Chowman's special). The gravy includes a perfect blend of vegetables like palak, tofu, cauliflower, asparagus along with a semi spicy sauce base. A perfect place to dine in the area.

It was when one of my friends suggested that we try out this place, we finally came to the Salt Lake outlet of Chowman. 
It was a huge party and the quantity of food we ordered was huge as well. Usually restaurants tend to mess up when the quantity is large,  but they didn't. The chicken cooked with white wine perfectly complemented the delicate flavours of the rice noodles. The crispy chilli babycorn was superb and so was the chilli pork. However,  when one of my friends started to hum a few lines on his own,  the manager intervened and told him to stop since it was supposedly "disturbing"  the other diners . Very rude. Never knew that good music can "disturb" people. Cheers.

This place has been a hit and miss for me. 

The restaurant itself is very well done up. It's pretty well located for being in Salt Lake. 

Eating in the restaurant was a better experience than my delivery experience.  

The Chinese fare was not exciting. We ordered Schezwan chow and it was barely edible.
I will admit, however, that the pork Penang curry was delicious. I'd definitely order that again. 

Be careful on what you order here. You can't expect consistent quality. Bon app√©tit.

The quality & the quantity is so good that u won't mind spending some extra money out of your pocket. We went out for a lunch date and ordered Chilli Pork, which was tasty and yummy, I am not a big fan of pork but now surely I am. And then we ordered Shanghai Chicken Noodles with Sweet n Sour Chicken, which was again really very delicious. The noodles are a must try. I enjoyed 2 things the most, 1st was the ambience, ofcourse. 2nd was the chopstick experience (thanks to wikihow). This place did not disappoint us at all, it was a good experience. Highly recommended place for Chinese food lovers. Planning for your next date? Surely visit this place. üòâ

Real good Chinese is all about its lightness and feathery taste, chowman gives you every bit of it. Starting of with those cracking starters such as Honey fried crispy prawn wantons to Chicken stir fried in Basil really boosts up your appetite.Then some fresh Lime soda with a cherry afloat. Coming to the main course we had Chowman special Noodles,this thing beats every other noodle in the menu with its tangy taste ,mild spicy flavour wrapped up with fried egg.I'm a Lamb fanatic to be specific so Lamb in Hunan sauce is my favourite and Honey and lemon fish,Pure sweetness! To end with desert, toffee flavoured almond vanilla ice cream. Bon Appetite.

Sweet & sour fish is excellent and Mandarin fish is ok. Crab meat in black bean sauce is not upto the mark.  Packing of containers is innovative but more than one chopsticks need to be given.  Food was warm when delivered.  Overall the first time experience is very good.

Since i have visited this resturaunt it has become one of my fav place for eating chineese. Proper chineese feel n they also provide u with chopsticks. The food is amazing. i just loved it. I orderd spring roll, baby corn n brucolli in chilli garlic sauce, potato n american corn in hot garlic sauce, cantoneese, sanghai meifoon, capsicum n burnt garlic rice. All the dishes were worth ordering. The place is not expensive. A must visit. We also orderd darshaan which was gud

No wonder they received the "Best Regional Chinese Restaurant Of The Year 2015".
I visited their Salt Lake outlet today for a lunch with my wife and daughter. Couple of things I really liked about that place .
(a) Courtiers behaviour
(b) Very nice ambience ( no loud music :) )¬†
(c) Comfortable seating arrangements

Food were really¬†delicious and the amount for each portion is really good. We really liked the "sliced chicken with oyster sauce" and "hunan fish".¬†

We had a good time.. Thank you - Debaditya Chaudhury :)

Had the worst experience, sad enough to walk out of the place without ordering. Had planned a family lunch for 10, and the managers were too stubborn to adjust tables in spite of the availability of empty ones. Have never seen such a snobbish, disrespectful and rigid attitude in hospitality industry. We were greeted by a bald guy with a moustache, who happened to be saying no to all our request. We even offered to adjust the tables ourselves, and yet the guy wouldn't budge. Will not be stepping inside the place again, and recommend everyone else to do so. If the people serving food are so bland, I cannot imagine the kind of food that will be served. Had to give 1.0 rating coz the rating system does not accept a 0.
The nearby Smash Street was a much better experience, and I am so glad we went there. Hope the owners take a look at the ongoing mismanagement.

Chowman has been my favourite for quite some time now. I often dine out at either Salt Lake or Ballygunge, and I've loved it thoroughly.

However, my brother in law, who stays in France, just came home for his vacation a few days back, wanted to have good Chinese food last night. I could obviously only think of Chowman, and settled for a delivery option. We ordered for Thai Soup, Chicken Drums of Heaven & Tai Chin Chicken.  Little did I know, that it would turn out to be a disaster. The food was definitely not from the kitchen of Chowman ( I'm sure as I've dined there more than a dozen times ). It was horrid, almost like any random local restaurant or even worse, maybe a pavement shop. It was disgusting in taste. Only then it occurred to me that zomato does show a different delivery menu altogether. And I'm sure to the core that this food is procured from elsewhere, packed in chowman's branded containers and sent out to fool us consumers.  This is sheer cheating!! And I'm doubtful if I may ever again refer anyone to eat there, let alone pay a visit myself.

Let me begin by saying that this is the only outlet of chowman I have been to. So my opinion strictly reflects the experience I have had over here. And I must say that it has been a good culinary experience. The first thing you notice when you enter this joint is its marvellous ambience. They have a soothing music that really goes with the mood. They have a very elaborate menu which will appeal to both vegetarian and strictly non-vegetarian like me! For the starter I had barbeque chicken. And it is so delicious that my friends and I ordered it again after we had the main course. For the main course we ordered mixed rice noodles and prawn in black bean sauce. Though the rice noodles was really good, the prawn was just above average. The staffs need a special mention as they were really courteous. Overall a must visit place for all food lovers like me! @

Delicious Asian food! The place is easy to locate. We'd ordered for honey chilli wontons for starter, clear soup with prawn balls, crab meat fried rice and shredded chicken in red pepper sauce.. The wontons were crisp and tasty. The soup was great too. It had lime leaves and ginger which soothed me . The rice was good with bits of crab meat and egg. The chicken was great. I am very eager to try the lychee ice cream and pork belly roast here. One thing I hated ,the temperature was set at 16 degree celsius !! I asked to increase it.

Nicely put decor & cozy atmosphere with soft Chinese music playing, this place offers a lot to take back....

exhaustive spread with explanatory notes against each, good taste & decent quantity, It's quite easy to fall in love with Chowman, one such place for which you would always like to buck dinner back home every fortnight without much pinch on pockets.

This was our first visit to this restaurant. The decor and ambience were very nice but the food was disappointing. We ordered Talumein soup, roast pork and Chinese Chopsuey. The soup and the pork dish could be rated 2 on 5 but I wouldn't give the Chopsuey more than 1 on 5. Absolutely pathetic. 

I have been very fond of Chinese Chopsuey for the last 45 years. I  normally benchmark a Chinese eatery by the quality of its Chinese Chopsuey. Chowman badly disappointed me on this score. 

Maybe I'll give this restaurant another chance and try some other dishes because it is not too far from where I live.

extremely rude staff on telephone. We have ordered home delivery numerous times but last weekend when we placed an order the staff said we need to place an order of atleast 2000 whereas everytime the min billing has been told to be 700. on telling the waitstaff as well as speaking to the manager that we have always ordered earlier for min 700, they were extremely gruff and said it was not possible anymore and just hung the phone. Such rude behavior from a reputed brand towards a regular customer is extremely uncalled for and not expected.

Yesterday had a horrible experience from Chowman Saltlake. 
Placed order at 6pm along with payment and a request to keep it ready by 9pm.
Went to collect at 8.45...they had mixed it up...got it at 9.25pm.
Returning home, found they missed putting in one of the items...Kung Pao Chicken.
Called them and had it delivered. 
Last but not the least...the special gift item: one  small bolt in my Rice Noodles.

Have been planning to share my review of this restaurant for a long time but could not manage time. Finally could make it... This place is just wow! I visited their first outlet in Golf Green about 5 years back when they just started and since then have been a huge fan of this place.. I am also a chinese food lover as it is light on the stomach. So have tried all renowned joints of chinese food in the city and i must say that only chowman lives up to its promise of serving authentic chinese food.. What i love the most at chowman is their pork dishes.. all of them are just yum.... I have visited all their outlets (they have expanded rapidly in a span of just 5 years) and must applaud the consistency that they have maintained... the food is just the same everywhere... Their food is always fresh is what i can say by the taste of it and a perfect blend of all flavours.. Lovely place

I had earlier visited the Chowman outlet at Golf Green and had expected this outlet to be very similar. However, on entering the restaurant i was really taken aback by its spaciousness!! The outlet at Golf garden is quite small with only a couple of tables...but this one is in stark contrast and is easily one of the biggest and most spacious restaurants in its class. Food quality is awesome and most of the items
 are overtly delicious...staff is well mannered and courteous.. However, seats were not that comfortable as most of the sofas were booked and had to manage with the chairs. But overall a decent place with ample amount of space and great food!!

Been meaning to visit this place for quite a long time. I'd heard good reviews from my friends about Chowman, and it has lived up to its reputation.. The decor, the behavior of the waiters, and the music, though a bit too loud, give you a good vibe even before you take your seat. The lamb and pork dishes are really good. Will go again to get a taste of the fish and prawn dishes, which I'm told are equally lip-smacking..

Chowman used to be our safest bet to satisfy our crave for chinese cuisine. But my last visit was one of those days when nothing was right. We reached a bit late for lunch, and after agreeing to place our last order before 4pm, we were alloted a table for 5. We ordered manchow and sweetcorn soup, along with american corn pepper salt and spring roll for starters. Sweetcorn soup tasted way too sweet and  american corn was stale. Spring rolls were just about fine. Meanwhile, we could easily notice the servers getting restless to take our final order, as clock was ticking towards 4. Our maincourse consisted of American chopsuey, Burnt garlic rice, Hakka noodles, exotic mix veg gravy and fresh lime sodas. Most of them didn't live upto our expectations. Lime soda was made out of rotten lemons. Toffee walnut with icecream lit up our mood, and hence we ordered for its second serving. But to our dismay, they ran out of icecream stock!! Above all, as stated by the ONLY server on the floor, its their management rule not to play music post 4pm. Sigh!! We had to leave with incomplete dining experience. The final shocker was seeing one of their captains sleeping away to glory at the restaurant's exit. I hope management pays a heed and do not allow these silly mistakes to dilute its brand. Cheers.

Being a vegetarian, i hardly visit any non veg restaurant as they do not have much of variety for the vegetarians. But after hearing a lot about Chowman and its wide variety of vegetarian dishes i thought of giving it a try.¬†

So there i was with my family. I must begin with how amazed we were at the decor and ambiance at the place.. mindblowing... the staff were also very courteous and helapfel.. they have a lot of options for vegetarians and we were actually surprised that an authentic chinese restaurant serves such variety of veg dishes as well. We had lemon pepper soup and veg spring roll for starters and they were very very nice... very well made... for main course we ordered for chili garlic babycorn and button mushroom, exotic vegetables in chili basil sauce, devil's exotic vegetables along with moon fan fried rice, shanghai style meifoon... all of the dishes were lovely.. loads of vegetables and so perfectly flavoured.. we all enjoyed every morsel of food... my parents are still all praises for this restaurant. All vegetarians out there must try chowman... we are definitely going back again and again :)

Superb!! From its interior, ambiance, comfort to its delicious food. Everything was simply amazing. I went there with my friends and had a great time. 

The service was quick and the food was amazing. It was exactly how it should taste like. The flavors were not too over powering as thai food can be too spicy. I liked the whole menu. 

Would definitely like to recommend it to all. It is a must try. I would like to visit it again for sure.
 And the dish that still lingers is their sea food fried rice... so full of flavour and so amazing...

it was a goodbye treat from my aunts, and it was raining a lot that's why instead of going somewhere far away we decided to go this chowman which was about 15 mins away from my aunt's place.the food here is decent but not as good as the chowman in golfgreen.
i had basil rice and double roasted pork and honestly i found it quite authentic and intense. i would love to go backto this place when i go back to kolkata.

Also they have maintained their quality and service.. I love their crab meat rice... Thai noodles..kung pao chicken... Crab...fish and prawn as well... Recommended to visit .. Also the USP is their pricing its reasonable and requested not to increase otherwise it will be a problem to survive in market... Keep it up...

The ambience need to be more manageable.  As we had gone in weekend, rush is there. Overall experience is good. Food quality is good but not up to full marks. As I am very selective, I must need to say that the lamb wasn't good enough to get the appraisal. Btw the chinease instrumental music hovering beside ur ears is enjoyable. Please dont order ny Thai cuisine here. I would prefer a rating of 6.5 out of 10 overall.

We went to this restaurant today. So far as the ambience is concerned it was typical Chinese style and was giving a positive vibe but after that everything was bad. We entered around 3:15 pm - 3:20 pm and they said that we will take our last order by 4 pm which was fair enough. We asked them what all special they have in beverages and the reply was coke thumsup Fanta... It was hilarious....then We ordered for american corn pepper salt, manchow soup and sweet corn soup initially. We couldn't eat anything, it was a disaster. Sweet corn was extra sweet, manchow was extra thick and tasteless. Then we ordered for main course, but to our surprise everything was pathetic. Only food which we could eat was Hakka noodles. And out of everything the worst was there fresh lime soda which was without fizz and was like sugar syrup in water. Our main course came at around 4 pm and by then they switched off the music and all, it was so weird!!! We told them to switch it on but they bluntly said no sir we cannot, its our managements rule. The washroom is badly made, no one can sit there of my height as it has a wall right in front of it.... When we were leaving the manager was sleeping on the seat next to the main gate... All in all its my last visit to such a terribly bad unprofessional restaurant...

This is the place that serve Excellent Chinese Food. 

I have been to there Salt Lake branch.

Ambiance is very nice.Nice decor.
Very well behaved and nice staff.

Food is simply awesome...
Quality and Quantity are very nice..
Hell lot of options in Veg compared to many places i have been, Lots to choose from Soups, Starters and then quite a decent spread in the Main course.
One can try out the Coriander rice,Crab meat Rice which i found really well made.. Other dishes are equally good..

My personal favs are ...konjee crispy lamb,double fried pork/lamb,Jumbo prawn,roasted pork,lat me kai...
One can try out the variety of Prawn,Pork and Crabs here..

I keep on visiting here for the excellent food and do recommend this place for others.

A Must try !

We were indecisive about where to order Chinese from and finally decided upon Chowman. As this was the first time we were ordering from here, so we decided to keep it simple with fried rice and chilly chicken. Coming to the delivery time, they kept their promise of delivering within 45 minutes though it was raining outside. The food was nicely packed. Quantity was quite good. I didn't like the rice that much. It tasted like plain rice with some chicken pieces. Chilly chicken was good enough. Overall, I will rate it 3. But I would want to taste other items in future too.

On a weekend the resturant had only two staffs handling around 8 tables, they kept hurrying us to place our order and then took close to an hour to bring the food. The staff put the food on table and left, no one came to serve the food even after repeated request and finally had to help ourselves. The manager upon complaining apologized and disclosed that half of the staff was on leave. Poor management aside the food is very average, nothing Chinese about it, same taste  as the numerous street stalls around the city serving deep fried Indian version of noodles and cornflour gravy in a tibetean styled monastery ambience.

Pros- decor is impressive, chinese frescoes, buddha heads, twin 'shis' at the entrance, dim lighting - all very nice. Service is quick and courteous.
Cons - Food is just about OK - neither authentic nor innovative.
My Order - 
Chicken Tai Pei - average, could be chilly garlic chicken, could be lat mei kai, could be shredded chilly chicken - no distinctive flavor or taste. I was told I should not eat the carrot used for the plating, as it was 'not fresh', and only an embellishment - the funniest thing I have heard in sometime!

Pan fried chicken noodles - was good - noodles tossed in a soya gravy - very palatable!

Mixed Fried Rice - pretty plain - more of rice and less of anything else - a tad disappointing.

Chicken in Black Bean Sauce - lacked flavor, and there was coriander to make things worse...and a strange lemony tang, which ruined it for me.

Pocket pinch - About 650 for 2. 

Verdict - Go for it if you craving indianized 'paara' chinese at a premium price.

I visited this place on a Sunday, and it was pretty much filled with diners. We had Prawn ka Seong and Pan Fried Chilli Chicken for starters. The prawns were huge and yummy, and the chicken was juicy and awesome. Then we ordered Mixed Moon Fan Fried Rice and Devil's Lamb. The rice was good enough. The Lamb was super spicy and very delicate. The food arrives pretty quick, and the service is commendable.  Overall, very good dining experience.

Chowman is my go-to restaurant whenever I am in the mood for Chinese and don't want to travel a long distance. I have been here innumerable times . The ambience is stunning! It kind of gives one a positive vibe when one enters the place. The food quality and quantity are really good. Of the many things in the menu that I have tried so far, I feel that the mixed Singapore rice noodles,chicken in oyster sauce, Hunan prawns,double roasted pork and pan fried chili chicken are served best here. Their home delivery service is good too . Once I had ordered food when it was raining cats and dogs and they delivered the food at my residence without any complaints amidst  heavy rain!

I must say the food was awesome, in terms of quality, quantity, packaging etc. Tasted their thai style fried rice, pan fried chilly fish and oyster chicken. All of them tastes so good like authentic chinese food. Less spicy, less oil and excellent flavor. A must try for every chinese lover.

One day when I went there with my friend and I feel really happy to know that it is present in my home area. I do not have any comment about the food because it is always very good in taste.

I was quite surprised at such reasonable pricing of chowman even after offering such amazing food... And their menu is so so vast...you have a whole lot of options to choose from.. and the other best thing???? Tell them your taste and they suggest you the dish or even customize it according to your taste. Now thats what i call true hospitality... Chowman has won my heart too :)

The meat ball soup was delicious as usual we all liked the pepper garlic chicken the most for starters among the other dishes. Their sea food fried rice deserves a special mention when it comes to main course.., It is so flavourful and delectable... everyone went ga ga over this dish..

In love with some authentic chinese? If so, Chowman at Salt Lake can surprise you with the impeccable quality of food. Being one of the finest restaurants in Kolkata you will find that it is worth a visit. They offer some amazing soups (chowman special soup is my personal favorite). The portions are big and filling. ¬†For starters - seafood lovers should give a try on delectable crispy honey fried prawns and pan-fried chilli fish. We had chicken in sweet chilly sauce and roast lamb made in devil‚Äôs style for our main-course. The staff is courteous and gives you a very good service. They even suggest you the type of sauce you should take with Rice/Noodles

I loveeee chowman!!!! Chowman is one of the best restaurants that Kolkata has seen in the last few years. I first ordered from chowman, on my birthday, although they had screwed up with my order, but their food was great. I went to the restaurant later on. It's right on the main road in CF block. The decor of the restaurant is beautiful. Transforms you to a place of culture and comfort. The main thing I love about Chowman is that there is no ajino moto in their food. Also there are soo many options with regard to vegetarian food. We ordered the sweet n sour vegetables, veg fried rice & a chicken dish (can't recall the name). The food was exceptionally good. The chicken was not coated in a thick layer of cornflour & the vegetables had a delicate balance of sweet & sour. One bowl of fried rice served three people easily. The soup was something I distinctly remember because, it was heavenly. It was not a thick mixture of cornflour but a delicate balance of tastes. No cornflour in it at all. I was very Pleased with the food. There was a long queue outside the restaurant by the time we finished, and there was no occasion, it was just a plain Saturday evening. The service was also very good, the waiters were polite and hospitable. In short, me and my parents had a great time at Chowman. It has changed the scenario of Chinese cuisine in Kolkata. Hats Off!

It is a rainy night, were on a confusion, either to go out and have food or order for delivery.. Since the rain was pouring cats and dogs, we decided to order food for door delivery. Initially the idea was to try Something Italian but we couldn't get proper response from them we ended up with chowman. We ordered a chilly golden fried babycorn, Egg fried rice, and I asked for flat noodles but they gave me Thai noodles. They assured delivery within 25 mins and I got it in 25 minutes. I must appreciate them for the prompt delivery.  
The baby corn was crisp and very nice. The rice was very blunt not much of taste. The Thai noodles was good. The fried rice could have been better.

Very disappointing Chowman. Ordered home delivery for mixed and chicken fried ¬†rice,noodles and chilly chicken. Simplest of orders. Now when I said fried rice,I expected the rice to be FRIED. It was almost plain bland rice. When I asked for mixed rice,I expect pork to be there(they serve pork),which wasnt there. And I counted, 3 pieced of prawn in the total rice and some 6-7 pieces of finely shredded chicken. Really?And the chilly chicken,even I can make better chicken than that and Im a very bad cook. Im giving 1.5 stars only because the delivery was prompt and the delivery guy was so happy with such a small amount of tip I gave. Good soul. Disastrous food.

Paneer was too sweet in taste, noodles were just ok today n mushrooms were too hard (felt like it was not fresh). Normally Chowman food has never disappointed me.. May be I just had a bad day..

I visited the place today and the first thing that impressed me was the ambience in the restaurant,the dim lighting,the music as well as buddhist statues gave a soothing feeling and reminded somewhat of chinese.The staff was friendly and cordial.For starters we ordered pan fried chilli chicken and barbeque chicken both of which attacked my tastebuds with a huge range of flavours.We also had sweet lime soda which was refreshing.For main course we had chowman special noodles and hunan chicken both of which were yummy.The chinese was light and one of the major thing is that there was more than adequate portions for the price offered.Definitely one of the fine restaurants if you want to eat pure chinese.Would love to visit again.

Ordered food from this outlet of Chowman for an office party last week and it was horrible. I never ate at their Saltlake branch but had high expectations since I am a regular customer of Chowman's southern outlets. 
It was a simple order of fried rice and chilli chicken and it was terrible!
The fried rice was disgusting and the chilli chicken was just eatable. I will not recommend anyone ordering from this outlet,unless you are craving for tasteless food at high prices.

I liked the ambience a lot.
The price is also reasonably low so it didn't weigh too heavily on our pockets.
We ordered "The chowmans favourite thick mixed meat double flavoured soup" which was served piping hot and every one was gratified.
The pan fried chilli fish was another delight and had all of us debating whether we should have ordered another plate but alas we sufficed with what we had.
The chowmans special rice is nothing extraordinary but it tastes just fine.
The only food item that irked me and I had to eat forcefully since we had already ordered it was the Meifoon cooked in thai style.
It had a strange odor and tasted limp.
If ambience is on your cards with not too much too spare and your looking for a chinese joint, go check this place out.
They do not serve food that would have you gasping for breath but the experience would be nice nevertheless. :)

I went to Chowman recently with my cousins for dinner. The interiors had a beautiful Buddhist-Chinese infused theme and was mostly dimly lit with ample light at the respective tables. The Chicken Lung-Fung soup was served within 10 minutes and was delicious. It was followed by Roasted Chili Pork and Drums of Haven. The drums of haven were very soft and crunchy; totally loved them. I would especially recommend the pork which was beautifully cooked, had bite sized portions and was very flavorful. Next for main course we had Schezwan Hakka Chicken Noodles and Chicken Fried Rice with Vegetable Manchurian and Chili Garlic Chicken in Red Bell Pepper. My advice would be to give the noodles a miss; it didn't have any taste as such, it was just hot and had a weird pungent flavor. The rice on the other hand was much better. The chicken tasted standard, nothing out of the world but pretty good. However the vegetable Manchurian was to die for, it was amazing and I would definitely recommend it. On the downside, the place was congested and stuffed to the fullest with tables. The tables too were small and there wasn't much space to keep most of the containers. However the staff were very courteous. All in all it was a very good experience.

Coming to the food part - the crispy Thai chicken in the starters was pretty good. Thai chckn curry & thai noodle was also pretty fresh. Couldn't finish it all as we were only two n the quantity was much.
Overall the experience was wonderful and they do take care of hygiene which we came to know by touching their warm/hot cutlery. one thing they did not use mono sodium glutamate if u made a prior request to the staff.¬† 
Keep up the good quality!!

If you want to give your taste bud an exotic chinese taste then chowman is the right place for you. It remains very crowded during durga puja festivals. We had to wait for more than 1 hour in the queue. The food quality is yumm and there are lots of varieties of each chinese categories, be it noodles or rice or chicken.
Overall rating:
Food: 5/5
Ambience: 4.5/5
Management: 3.5/5
Price: 4/5 (It will not burn hole in your pocket, though i thought so before entering as it is located near the posh areas of salt lake)

I've heard about chowman from several of my peers. So on 21st June, 2015, Sunday I visited the place. First of all I love the location. Swimming pool area is one of the most serene area in salt lake. It has diverse strata of stores mostly food joints. The location is unlike any other in salt lake. Let's come to chowman review.

Pros:
1. The ambience needs special mention. The wooden structure of Chinese talismans produces a wonderful feeling. The menu books are as big as diaries. I was quite delighted to find out a Bengali guy's initiative is chowman.
2. The service is good. They always suggested me what could be best for my group.
3. The food tastes authentic Chinese. All the items were delicious. But as in authentic Chinese the spices are less. So it depends on one's taste bud, if he would like that or not.
4. Price is very reasonable in today's standard.

Cons:
1. The amount of food in one portion is not much.
2. We ordered 3 types of fried rices but all tasted similar. 

Overall I loved my first time at chowman salt lake.

Went there today. Must say awesummm ambience and liked the Chinese theme nd d√©cor. The service was very good.
Now coming to the food, I ordered konjee crispy Lamb  as starter .I must say it was the best lamb fry i ever had nd I wud highly recommend to try out this one. We also ordered mixed fried rice along with famous kung pao chicken and schezwan chicken. There was nothing special about fried rice,it was a normal one.Kung pao chicken was delicious but it could be more spicy.And schezwan chicken was worth trying there.It was a perfect mix of spices.
So concluding if u have few bucks to spend fr good food, then must give a shot here.
Hoping to visit again.

Fish in chilli wine sauce seems to be delicious... Alongwith pan fried noodles...

For starters, Taipei chicken and chicken lollypop are worth trying... But the seafood fried rice should not be missed out if you are an ardent seafood lover like me..

After a long wait on a Saturday night, we finally got into the restaurant. A group of seven, we ordered red and green pepper chicken,along with tai pai chicken for starters, which were good! Nice tender chicken...For main course, we ordered mixed fried rice, chilli garlic noodles and meinfoon. The chilli garlic noodles was not quite standard. It was sort of cold and not so tasty. The rest were good! We also tried kung pao prawn, hongkong chicken and shredded lamb...and all were good. There are some problems in management though, for example, the lime sodas we ordered came after a lot of nagging, begging and frustration! Apart from that, all great!!

Hi foodies!

I went here for dinner on the 14th of June, 2015. Although this was not my first visit here, I was still excited, primarily because this restaurant certainly falls in my list of Top 5 Chinese Restaurants.

The ambience is lovely. With just the right amount of light and artefacts and music, it creates the perfect effect. Although the voices from the other tables could get loud, the staff aptly reminds them to settle down. 

The first thing you should order is the soup. We ordered the Chowman's Special Soup (picture provided). The unique thing about this item is that it is your choice to have it spicy or non spicy. 

For the main course, we ordered Shanghai Rice, Cantonese noodles, Kung Pao Chicken and the Hot Garlic Lamb. 
Apart from the Chicken, I enjoyed each item. As for the quantity, I believe they could increase it for the noodles, considering the rice is more than enough for two persons. 
Also, I would suggest going for the Pan Fried Noodles instead of the Cantonese noodles because they prepare it better.

As an endnote, I would give a thumbs up to their sweet offerings provided with the bill. 
Step in here. You won't regret it. 

-Bon Appetite. :)

Chowman has a quaint, dimly lit and peaceful ambiance. The service is impeccable and the food lip smacking. This is a much delayed post though and i intend to visit them again very very soon. It is the perfect place for a romantic date over delicious food.

In love with some authentic chinese? If so, Chowman at Salt Lake can surprises you with the impeccable quality of food. Being one of the finest restaurant in Kolkata you will find that it is worth a visit. To start-up they offer you a traditional Chinese Soup. The portions are big and filling. The Chowman‚Äôs Special soup is really good and most of seafood tastes authentic, preserves the flavors and is not overdone or stinks which is typical in other restaurant. For starters - seafood lovers should give a try on delectable crispy honey fried prawns and pan-fried chilli fish. We had chicken in sweet chilly sauce and roast lamb made in devil‚Äôs style for our main-course. The staff is courteous and gives you a very good service.

I have spent most of my childhood days in Salt Lake specially around swimming pool.. So it's almost customary for me to drop by here everytime I am in Kolkata i.e twice a year.

Over the years, Salt Lake had changed a lot and had received its fair share eateries among other things. This time I landed up at Chowman as my friends were in the mood to try Chinese.

The place is quite well done and from a first impression I was quite pleased. Thanks to my mobile lifestyle, I have ended up eating at restaurants most the last few years and this restaurant still made me feel good.

Since my friends are vegetarian I did not get swayed by the ample options available under non-vegetarian dishes. We ended up ordered chilly potato, veg noodles and manchurian in gravy. Basically the tried and tested Chinese food. My friends do not experiment a lot with food unlike me. The food was average but nothing that you would complain a lot about. A lot of road side stalls in kolkata do serve better noodles but we were having a good time so there was nothing to look down on. The service was decent.

Post this is when things went absolutely wrong and turned this OK experience to a sour one. I wanted my friends to try something new and ended up ordering my favorite Pan-fried noodles with gravy. After a pretty long wait, the noodles turned out of be undercooked. I called the server and told him my concern to which his first reaction was That's how Fried noodles are supposed to be. I told him to taste it or take it back to the chef and ask him to try it. They took the dish away and cleared our plates... We did not hear back for about 15mins and then the same server started laying new plates. On asking if they are serving us again, the waiter quite rudely said to wait as the same dish was being prepared again.

When the noodles re-appeared, they had basically removed all fried noodles and added so much oil that we couldn't even manage to have a proper bite. On asking for the cheque, the manager came forward and instead of trying to understand that the dish was insulting to us, he added further insult by saying that the we do not know how to order and have ordered something that does not match our taste. First time itself there was nothing wrong in the dish and they did a favor by re-serving us. On complaining about the high dose of oil in the second serving, he told us that's exactly how it's meant to be and since we have never had Bamboo oil.. We can't really judge the amazing dish!!

Seeing that the management did not really share the views we held and did not respect us as a customer we asked him to simply give the cheque. The manager after shouting all this while stomped away. We waited for 10 mins for the bill and then called the server. We asked him to get the bill and this whole time manager was simply standing in the corner. When we really persisted, the manager rudely asked the server to give us the bill so that he can get rid of us. We immediately stood, waited at the door for the bill, paid and walked away!

I have eaten in places where the chefs have been more than happy to fix dishes, get feedback and appreciate criticism. And then there are absolutely average places like this one which are full of arrogance and do not really know the value of a happy customer. Just coz today they have a healthy stream of customers does not mean they have great food. Hope they understand it someday!

This is an not so popular name among Kolkatans but the one who have once been there or ordered there will come here many times. This is authentic chinese restaurant with lots of starters and main dishes of choice. This was the second time ¬†I ordered from my office from Chowman Saltlake branch and I will repeat more times for sure.

They have huge variety of starters of which Pan Fried Chili Prawn , Pan fried Chili Chicken, Prawn ka Seong, pepper garlic chicken from ¬†non veg I really liked. I have also tasted chili garlic baby corn from veg part and it was very much upto the mark like the non veg dishes. I think they prepare starters better than the main dishes. From main dish Meifoon, Wok Tossed Hakka Noodles , Schezuan Fried Rice was special. Side dish I tried Honey chicken both the times but second time We didn't liked it much coz of too much sweetness. I think they some how put the honey twice, else it is a good dish to taste.

I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone to try it once. If your office is at sector 5 or even at Unitech or Ecospace , they provide delivery. Keep in mind they only accept CASH in home delivery.¬†

Cost: 4/5
Service : 3.5/5
Taste: 4/5

Zomato should really provide users with option to rate between *.0 to *.5. Right now I am doing a helpless injustice with Chowman by rating them 4.0. They deserve 4.3! But not 4.5 either.

This was my second order to Chowman but first order to this outlet in particular. My first experience at Chowman was at their Golfgreen outlet. That was good. But this is far better!

Nice cooperation over phone while taking the order followed by delivery on committed time started with a good impression.
We ordered 4 chicken appetizers (garlic pepper chicken, pan fried chilli chicken, tai chin chicken and tai pei chicken) one plate each, 2 chicken main courses (tsing hoi chicken and chicken in black bean sauce) two plates each, 2 plates of thai fried rice and 3 plates of shanghai fried rice. These much was more than enough for 6 of us (4 big eaters and 2 average eaters) which is fair enough with respect to cost. Each of us contributed 460 bucks including tax and 6 extra containers.

Food was a wonderful showcase of fine cooking. Indianised flavors, but cooked with good ingredients and care. Worth mentioning the chicken in black bean sauce where presence of black beans was clearly visible which is rarely experienced at the chinese restaurants in the city. All the items were excellent with fantastic aroma and flavor. Only I personally feel Tsing hoi chicken could be better and was not up to the mark of the other dishes they cooked. Taste was no doubt good but it could be less oily.

Packaging was excellent. No spilling out, perfectly placed containers in plastic bags and sufficient spoons and forks. Only negative was they forgot to provide tissue.

Overall experience was excellent. Since last few months we have been searching a quality chinese restaurant that delivers to Unitech without hassle. At last our search ends here. I would like to call again soon for doorstep delivery or given an occasion and opportunity, would like to dine in with my family or friends at this outlet.

This is yet another Chinese delight . Good food served with great ambience around is a fine combination for supper. Too many choices from the menu card somewhere leaves guests in confusion as the name does not explain the thing guest is ordering for. Else food and hospitality is good and for two person bill will be around 700-800. Bon appetite!!!

They have the most appropriate title.
Chowman proved themselves to be one of the best Chinese eatery in this area,Asia in the box lost the game and 47 Tyangra road got knocked out by them.

The way they deliver the food was commendable.Food was Hot and no spill took place.Quantity was sufficient for 6 of us.Containers were so lucrative that I carried them home.

Coming to the food we had - 
Pepper Garlic Chicken
Pan fried Chilli Chicken
Tai chin Chicken
Tai Pai Chicken
Chicken in black bean sauce
Sing hoi chicken
Thai Fried Rice
Shanghai Fried Rice.

To tell you, all of them were delicious.Especially the starters.To notice we found Black beans in Chicken in Black bean sauce which denotes that the sauces were prepared not brought.Tasted Authentic.Thai Fried Rice reminded me of Phuket Cruise where I had the best Thai fried rice of my life.

Felt like the chef caressed and cared for  the dishes and the consumers.Use of each sauce were so apt.We finished the food in no time.A quality of food is at times judged by the intake from the lowest consumer.Our team's lowest consumer also ate like a pro and think about the pros , they were all smiling. A smile which comes out of satisfaction of enjoying the sheer brilliance in culinary skills.

All the best Chowman!! We will be back soon, but this time in BF198, not in Unitech SEZ.
Keep up the good work. 

Best Regards,
Deboprio

Very good ambiance for a ¬†zesty Asian cuisine at a very affordable price, a contrast though lies between the dine-in and the delivery, otherwise the dishes are exquisite especially the chicken and basil, Lamb was too spicy, although that's what I had ordered, overall a fine establishment. ¬†Does not pinch the pocket but leaves you with an urge to try newer things on the Menu.¬†Hope they improve the quality of the Delivery.

Some how all the times I tasted food from Chowman it was either a takeway or doorstep delivery.
Anyway, we decided to keep it safe & not experiment with all the dishes which we might have done if we visited the place.
For starters we ordered,Prawn pepper salt & pan fried chilli fish. Both of them was very soft & well cooked & tasted great as well, being a prawn fan, i totally loved the crispy & perfect prawns!

For main course, we tried the wok tossed mixed noodles & the chilli garlic prawn noodles & crab rice. Both the noodles were on the drier side & mixed noodles had less of prawns & chicken & more of egg. The crab rice didnot have any traces of crab meat in it! Atleast not me or my friend could find any. It was pretty disappointing.

We also ordered, garlic chicken,Fish in garlic sauce & prawn in oyster sauce. All of them were very soft & thus pretty delicious. Though we ordered more on the garlic side but all of them were more on the sweeter side which was a disppointing for my friend who is not too fond of sweet in gravy & the gravy was actually pretty much sweet. Otherwise all of them were very well cooked & people with sweet tooth like myself didnot find anything to object.

I would definately try out more from their menu & update it!! Till now, I would defiantely recommend the place & it has become one of my favourite chinese joints in this area which badly needed an authentic chinese restaurant!

P.S. They only do doorstep delivery for orders above 2000.

This place is very strange. They for some reason serve u amazing food when u go to there restaurant to eat and when bad food when u order the same thing for home delivery. I visited this place with my friend just after it was opened last year on a weekday evening. The place is beautifully and tastefully  decorated. We ordered our food and was very delighted with the service and the quality and quantity of food they served. So after few days I ordered from Chowman and to my horror it took them over 1 an half hour to deliver the food even though my house was just 5mins away from the restaurant. We ordered for crabmeat soup, egg fried rice, shredded chicken in chili garlic and devil's fish. The portion of soup was ridiculous and wasn't even enough for 1 person. And then they sent us chili chicken in place of devil's fish even though they charged us for devil's fish and the egg fried rice had now seasoning at all. I called the restaurant and complained about their food being bland and the fact they have sent us the wrong item, to that the manage said and I quote ' our egg fried rice is suppose to be bland ' !!! üò≥üò≥üò≥
And rather than offering to replace the dish which they have sent by mistake he said that ' the money will b adjusted the next time we order from them'. 
So post this incident it is very obvious that we never ordered from them üòúüòúüòú.

Authentic Chinese is hard to come by but these people come pretty close to it. I located this outlet quite by chance one day when i was driving by. I had been to their original Ballygunge outlet before and so i was happily surprised to find a Chowman closer to home. I took my parents along for dinner one evening and we were quite delighted by the food! The dragon chicken is a must try if you are here as is the kung pao chicken. They make good prawn dishes too so you could try them out. In  totality it is a great restaurant which makes salt lake proud!

Yesterday night I went to Chowman with my cousins. Firstly ambience was peaceful and with the AC at 17 degrees, it was literally cool to be there. Now, speaking of the food, it just got better with each item. Started with the Manchow soup (highly recommended) and Barbeque Chicken, tasted great. For main course we had Mixed Fried Rice,Pan Fried Noodles,Chicken in Chilli Wine and Manchurian Chicken, all of them was nicely cooked without being too rich or spicy and with that authentic chinese taste surrounding them. Finished the meal with Fresh Lime Soda, which was equally refreshing.....Coming to the service, it was prompt and very co-operative......Overall a joyous experience and much needed relief to our taste buds......Hope to be back again soon!!!!

So on one summer afternoon when the temperature was peaking at 39 degrees I decided to visit Chowman with two of my roommates. The place was nice and pleasantly cool from the unbearable heat outside. We got a seat immediately and regular water was served. I was hoping that the water would be cold enough as I was thirsty from all the walking, but it was not, it was normal temperature. Now none of my roommates likes pork or lamb or crab or prawn so the choices were limited for me as soon as I started looking for things to eat. Finally, we ordered Green and Red Pepper Chicken for starters and then for main course Moon Fan chicken fried rice along with Chilli wine fish and Kung Pao chicken. I felt that the Green and Red Pepper chicken could have been cooked a little more as the chicken was not soft enough. The Moon Fan Chicken fried rice which is basically like normal chicken fried rice but made with five different spices was good and I kind of liked the coriander taste in the dish. The other two side dishes were well prepared and the fish and the chicken were very soft and juicy so no complaints. Overall I would like to visit this place again to try out the other non-chicken dishes and my first experience here was pleasant enough.Recommended!

Visited the place on a Saturday eve, just wanted to have some starters as we didn't had much time and appetite. The first thing to mention about thus place is the ambience it offers. Really good decor, moody lighting with mild Chinese music in the background. We ordered Crispy Baby corn with Honey and Grilled chilli pork and the combo was killer. Food was pretty well prepped and the pork was really juicy. I do recommend this as it gives a nice mix of sweet and spicy taste that will lighten up the taste buds. The red sauce they serve is a must with this one. Haven't discovered the main course delicacies yet.
Although pretty satisfied with the food quality, service of this place was a bit of concern. On weekends it gets really crowded there. We were lucky to get to get tables without waiting but when we came out there was huge queue. The service staff were not able to manage the demand properly. So I would suggest to visit this joint on weekdays to really  enjoy the meal. Budget wise it is super picket friendly though not compromising on the food quality and ambience which is a big thumbs up. All over a nice experience although not mind blowing.

Just now had dinner at home with Chinese delicacies from Chowman Salt Lake.
Packaging was good for all items including sauce , vinigar etc. and presented in a nice way.
Quality of food was also good. Quantity seemed to be matching with price.
Overall, a nice experience.

On 5th July '15, I had lunch with food from chowman, salt lake. The food was good.
I ordered through foodpanda.
The price list available at foodpanda is different from that available at zomato.
Menu card available through zomato contains muchore items; also the price is more than the price available through foodpanda.
Why the difference ?

The food derserves a even special mention because it is so different from the usual chinese that we get in the other chinese restaurants in the city.

We went there on 1.6.2015 and our experience was not pleasing.
Ambience: The place has great decor and attracts the right kind of people. 
Food: We went there for lunch and our 1st setback was there wasn't any fish items available. A real disaster.
I always liked their seafood.
We had ordered crispy babycorn and barbecue chicken. Those were really yummy. For mains, we had ordered special rice and honey chicken.
 My plate wasn't clean and i had to ask them to change it. The prawn in the rice wasn't cooked well. These things are so not expected from Chowman.
In a neighbouring table the waiter took fish order only to cancel it after 5 min. How well informed that waiter was! Lol
Overview: I had a great time at Chowman outlets in golfgreen and ballygunj and surely won't visit the salt lake outlet again.
THIS OUTLET of Chowman is a thumbs down from me, sadly, although I am a lover of Chowman and love their food.

The waiter insisted us for ordering lobster which we thought a bit costly for us but yet ended up ordering it. The taste was quite good and ample quantity for 3 of us. We ordred meafoon, mixed fried rice, chilli garlic chicken and mandarin fish in the main course. We are impressed by the quality and service and looking forward to visit again.

Good food but there are better places around in Salt Lake.. the price is little on higher side given the quantity served.
Prawn dishes are not so good, chicken is better and you need to be careful when ordering lamb dishes here.. never tried fish in this place.. so no comments :)

With my good experience in Garia, we visited Chowman salt lake recently.
Our bad, the power went out the moment we entered the restaurant.
The food was good but the lamb we ordered had to be returned because it was not thawed properly. It tasted like ever  chewable rubber.
One question, doesn't non AC restaurant have a different service tax (or no service tax) rate ? I think we owe you that money ;)

I liked the food. But I found a piece of a sewing needle in the mouth freshener(saunp) which I was chewing. Fortunately for me I did not swallow it. After taking it out I demanded to see the manager nicely. The waiter smiled. Then I showed him the needle. He still smiled. Then I went to the counter and demanded to see the manager again, they smiled at me and said the manager is not on the premises and he is coming. I waited patiently for 5 mins and asked again. They started laughing at me. My patience got the better of me. And I burst out...
Now they noticed, everyone else noticed. Meantime the manager came in, and said they will do something about it. No apologies, no offer to take up the tab. I felt that day that this "chalta hai" attitude is too deeply embedded in us and that no one cared. Everyone was eating and that was that...Some may have thought may be I am a trouble maker or just an imposter. I never meant to write about this but then thought everyone should know.
Once again, I liked the food, except for the fact that all fish was "Basa" which I never like, due to potential contamination scare, and because of the salty rubbery taste of it etc.
But after that needle I forgot what I had eaten there. I was scared. If you go there ask them if they have done something about needles in the food. And if so what have they done...

A rather late review. Had been there a month back with friends who had come from Bangalore. We planned for some nice chinese and on the recommendation of a few close family friends went to Chowman. We all were amazed from the moment we entered. The decor is of the kind that you do not get to see in Kolkata. It is so chique. I dont remember all the names of the dishes we had but what we just loved was the roasted chili pork. It was truly lip smacking and we ordered 3 more portions of it even after having the rest of the food. We thought that so much of food would burn a big hole in our pockets but the bill also amazed us. So reasonable the place is!!!!!!!!! Truly a memorable experience for all of us. My friends want you to also open in Bangalore..so much did he love the food.

This place served the worst Chinese I had in a very long time. I can proudly say that my neighboring local noodles-wala also make chinese better than these people.
So lets go one by one,
Ambience : Good, seemed promising !
Menu: Options are many, but availability on a Sunday was only chicken and stale, 1 week old prawns.
Servicing: Aweful, they take your order to come back after 15 mins and say the item is not available. Next comes a man who either could not hear us, or was determined to not assist us in any way.
Food: Thai Soup was good.
Then came Fried chicken wantons with miniscule chicken drops inside it, you need to go with a magnifying glass to see it there.
Double fried Lamb not being available, the waiter suggested konjee fried lambs, well we believed him that it was lamb in there, but in no way felt it ! Hard fried black something was served, only God knew what was inside it.
Next we ordered one Chowman's special fried rice and one Mixed Sanghai fried rice, to our convenience both were same, not by name but taste. They happily gave the same thing (charging differently though) to us.
We took Kung Pao Chicken, a little something which we could have in the main course.
And Finally came the show stopper Prawn in red pepper sauce ! The whole dish was a waste because the prawn was stale and seemed so old that anybody with an olfactory organ could have ran from that very location. We tried to complain about this, but then again nobody came to hear us, the one who came was determined not to help in any way.

I had one of my worst restaurant experience, and I earnestly request nobody to go there ever. Not to forget, four of us paid 2600+, not quite cheap too !

Never visit this place on a Saturday or Sunday evening. It is very crowded. Waiting time is more than 30 mins. To top it all, food that is served is very poor compared to what is served during weekdays. Maybe it is due to the rush. Most of the items in the menu were unavailable. We had to choose from whatever little dishes that were available for the day. Food had no taste and a certain crispy chicken dish smelled of eggs. Bad experience altogether!

Today I visited chowman of saltlake with my office colleagues. It was a party given by our team lead. Okay. Now coming to the ambience of chowman. It was very good u would feel like you are in china the background music was also some chinese music playing. Service was also very good and polite and quick. Now coming to food. We had so many things that I could hardly remember.  We had 4 types of starters, 2 types of noodles and 3 types of side dishes. We had lamb, pork, chicken, fish, mushrooms , prawn everything . We wanted to try every types so. The food was good specially fish with chilly wine was the best. The pork and lamb should have been more cooked but it was not bad also. Overall we enjoyed the dinner a lot. Thank you and I would recommend everyone to visit once.

was at Chowman a week before...great food i must say...but the staffs u hired they are worthless and not trained i think.... only a waiter knew to talk properly... some other people were angry over some issues and your manager was not coming to calm down them... the ambiance was spoiled... i think you should take customized orders also... today we were there...we asked for ginger chicken...i dint know your chef cant make ginger chicken without tomato sauce...as i have some stomach problem i was thinking to avoid tomato sauce n spice...so my husband asked them to be lil low on spice n avoid tomato sauce...they denied to deliver... how is this possible???? i really don't know...as we r also from hotel industry we never have heard such strict replies from a restaurant... if this continues m afraid you will loose your clients...cause all we long fr a classy place not a rigid one ....... we are gonna give one more try .... only for the food ....

I don't usually write a review but the experience i had yesterday at chowman could'nt stop me from writing one. It was saturday evening when i and my office colleagues decided to hit the place for a small farewell party. The ambience and the food was good. But what the disappointing factor was the service of the waiters and the attitude of the manager towards us. We visit a restaurant in order to be served well and leave the place with a word of appreciation in our mouth. But that was missing at chowman. The service of the waiters is very slow. When we called for the cake (which we had brought) after finishing with our food, the waiter took more than ten minutes to bring the cake. And all he brought was the cake and just 1 small plate and some tissue. Now how do you expect seven people to be served the cake in one plate. We asked the manager for small plates and waited. We didnt receive it in the next five minutes. We didnt wait further as we knew we wont receive it and finished with the cake. Later we called the manager and asked him what happened to the plates we asked for. He showed us the one plate which the waiter brought in the beginning. We were furious and said him to keep his plates with him. He pounced back on us and said 'Kya bola?' as if we were there to serve him. Considering that the place was crowded, we were courteous enough to not reply to what he said. Later the waiter told that he had given us tissue for the cake to be served on. Oh thank you Sir for that but we didnt bother to use your tissues. Our hands were enough. Yet i like the fact that we received our bill within one minute. The attiude of the manager towards us was completely negative. He behaved as if we had come to have the food for free. I am never visiting this place again in my life.

I had visited the place on the first week it opened. Quality and taste was awesome at that time. Visited 6 months later , staff untrained on how to serve ..they leave the food on your table and walk away ecpecting you to serve youself. Very dissapointed.
FOOD:
Ordered Chilly prawn..too little quantity and felt it wasnt fresh.
Schezwan noodles not too great as well.
Chicken dish was ok.
AMBIANCE:
Dim lighting and cant see your plate.Had to ask the staff to switch on AC as if it was optional service.
CLEANLINESS:
Table had grease and left over food sticking to the table mat on which they placed the plates. Was put off by the very sight of that.Imagine eating over greasy and soiled mats whilst.
WAIT TIME:
Waited 40 mins and had to chase them before finally getting the order. Also note visited a fairly empty period when they had 3 tables occupied in the restaurant.Not impressed.
Overall quality, quantity and service has declined sharply. Go only if you dont have any other choice.

I took my family to this restaurant on my father's birthday. It was my first family outing, after I had started earning. We ordered the Chowman special soup which was wonderful, followed by Lat Mai Kai. The main course was not mind-blowingly delicious though. Although what really impressed me was their walnut brownie desert. Pretty economical for an upscale restaurant! It was a good experience for us :)

Well my first experience wasn't nice,maybe because I went there after 10 pm which is their closing time so the food was cold and the behavior of the people was "Why you came bothering us." 

As there are many other Chinese restaurants in town, I won't bother chawman people anymore.

I am a big fan of Batman, Superman, Spiderman and I literally worship Hanuman. Thus one can expect a lot from what ends with man and which is meant for a man's stomach. Unfortunately Chowman doesn't come close to be a superhero in serving Chinese cuisine. Starters were cold (temperature wise). No wonder it was served within 2mins of placing the order. Roasted chilli pork had no pork, instead they served chicken in the name of pork, though I decided not to make an issue out of it bcz I knew they wouldn't pay a heed (evident from their body language). And where was the chilly???????
Main course took 20mins to be served, happy that it was warm and edible enough. However I would like to point that the quantity of the portion they serve is huge and reasonable on the pocket. Overall, decent food with dark ambience and the crowd can also be loud. Don't keep your expectations high from the staff, they will be least bothered about your presence.

Good Chinese food, good assortment of dishes on offer, nice ambience. The place looks rather small, but is not. The decor has been thoroughly thought about.
If you want to have some decent Chinese, without the fare being too tough on your pocket, this is the place to go to.

Chilli Garlic noodles - good
Chicken in hot garlic sauce - amazing
Honey chicken - not so much

Wanted to try this outlet as suggested by Zomato as good place Chinese and momos on 5th of May for my aunts birthday. Sad but true had a terrible experience for a dumb delivery man and could not experience the food in the proper manner. Writing this review to remind chow man food and prompt delivery is equally important for proper customer satisfaction so pls focus that part also. The delivery boy even after proper direction given by us or the people whom he was checking out in the road was going haywire and delayed the delivery for atleast 1.5 hours by this our food was cold ordered wanton which stuck to each other a complete mess. Hope they look into this problem and will have a better experience next time.

This restaurant has ambiance which will charm you. You feel as if you have stepped inside a spa!! The place soothes you and the service as well as staff makes the place worth a visit. Everyone from the doorman to the servers are polite, smiling and nice to talk to (Maybe it was one of those days :) when everyone was happy!!!) 
The food was also nice, albeit a bit bland. I wasnt entirely disappointed with the food. Do try their Hakka Noodles they are not very oily and struck the right chord with me. I am vegetarian but I believe even their chilli chicken was decent. So were their prawns. I loved their dumplings. A must for romantic dinners if you want one ;)

Serene ! Yeah the ambiance was better than the food for me . The food looked fabulous but was rather bland.The starters were disappointing , barbeque chicken was not hot ( temperature wise) and  the pan fried chilli chicken was the biggest turn off, lacked the punch.  While the chicken dishes tasted good , the one that was referred to as the spiciest one(Devil's chicken) was nowhere near spicy  ! Noodles tasted average , you can get better at the other chinese places of the same standard. Overall I think I'll have to visit again before I completely tick the place off my list.

This place is located near Swimming Pool in Salt Lake. As the name says they serve Delicious Chinese ¬†and thai food . Ambiance is good and looking at ambiance you will feel it must be at a bit higher side w.r.t its price but you will go wrong on that as they are reasonably priced and a complete value for money. Good option for chinese starters and Main course but very less options for Drink and Dessert.

One of my recent favourites in Kolkata...Chowman serves great Chinese cuisine. Add to that the reasonable price and this sure gets a big thumbs up from me. I have visited it twice now and it hasn't disappointed me both times. This time we ordered Stir fried chicken with basil and pepper garlic chicken for starters. The main course comprised of chicken fried rice, chicken rice noodles, oyster chicken with vegetables and schezwan chicken. The food is really good and the ambience and service is also decent. The only drawback probably would be the small sitting area, so it can get crowded at times. Overall, Recommended!

This place serves Chinese and is worth of money. Peaceful ambiance with the China touch and a soothing atmosphere. They also play good music in the background.  The food is very well done with great taste. We ordered for prawn ka siong as starters, and it tasted quite tasty. The chicken items and rice also tasted well. The price seems to be a little higher than the patent Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, but its worthy off.. The location of the restaurant is also proper. I will definitely visit this place again.

This place is a must visit for casual dining. The decor, the music and the ambience gives the chinese essence.We went in on a rainy day, started off with manchow and chicken soup, both tasted good. Mashroom pepper salt i thought was a little too crispy, could have been a lil softer nevertheless tasted good. For the main course we ordred capsicum and burnt ginger fried rice and fish in mustard sauce, main couse was delicious and a must try i must say. Overall a big thumbs up!

What I like about them is that the quality they maintain even during festive season. Love their chinese but be sure to try out steamed rice with chicken in red curry. They serve the most authentic thai food in the city. Also roasted chilli pork is worth a taste.

Chowman is a wonderful place! Hidden in some random residential area, we were surprised to find it. Further more, the ambience stunned us! The gorgeous Buddhist statues, the Chinese bells and the mild Chinese sounding music transported us to China land. 
The waiting staff was extremely courteous and knowledgable about all the weird sounding dishes. Service time was pretty quick too. 
Now the food: simply delicious. We ordered the crispy baby corn starters, Singapore noodles and the Shanghai noodles with some gravy. The noodles are a must try. 
In all, a nice experience. Will definitely try to return, maybe with some 'chopstick' training so that we can use the ones here!

Had been recommended this place by a cousin! It's surely one of the finest Chinese restaurants in town. Lovely ambience, very amiable hospitality. I specially enjoyed the chopstick experience. Price is slightly on the higher side but the quality and quantity of food are so good that you won't mind shelling out some extra pennies out of your pockets. Must haves would definitely include prawn ka seong, fish in red wine and Singapore noodles. Chowman doesn't fail to satisfy even post meal. The super cute box of sauf and other refreshin masalas are just too lucrative!

We ordered home delivery today. The food was nice nd delivery fast. But the experience was bad...I had called up a couple of days back to know whether they would deliver at my location. They said yes nd the minimum order should be 1000. Today when I called to place order, they said the minimum order should be of 2500. After much arguing they agreed to deliver but at the end told that I should be careful from the next time!!! I was shocked at this...very disappointing experience. Wont order again.

I wanted to give this restaurant another try after reading good reviews of this. So, again this Poila Boishakh we decided on a takeaway from this place. When we arrived, a queue was already starting to build for either dine-in or takeaway. We ordered our food nd the person taking the order told us that it would take around 30mins. So, we came out and waited for our order. After 30mins, we saw that there was no sign of our food and the people who had come for dine-in after us were being called! At around 45mins, when I went in to ask the person just said that it will take more time. We waited for another 15mins and then again we went and asked. The person just said that there is too much rush and it will take more time. After some time, we just said that if this was supposed to take so much time, then why weren't we informed before. We got our food after 1hr and 15 mins of ordering it!!
The food we ordered was equally disappointing. The crab meat rice didn't have any crab meat nd just smelled and tasted of coriander. The Hakka noodles was bland and didnt have any salt. The teriyaki chicken was stiff. The two decent items were chilli wine fish and lat Mai Kai.

My questions to the management:
1. Why was there no set expectations for people ordering takeaway?
2. Would you have kept us waiting for an hour if we chose dine-in?
3. Since you are running a restaurant, you know that there would be rush on any occasion. So why was there so much mismanagement?

Clearly your thought process was that since you guys make us pay beforehand for takeaway, you could make us wait as long as you wanted. But, dine-in people leaving would mean losing out on revenue so they were called in on a priority basis. 

Highly disappointed and disgusted!

Heard about this place a lot!! Was very keen to dine here.. Earlier visited once but cudnot make it inside after waiting for 1 hr. 

Finally went to have dinner with my friends around 10pm.. The interior is lovely.. 
We started with the starter crispy chilli babycorn.. Completely loved it.. But the soup.. Chicken sweet corn was so sweet that it seemed like a dessert..
Rest of the food was good and quantity was great.. 

Loved the ambience and the staff was good.

One of the best Chinese/Continental restaurant in Kolkata. And the vicinity is also very good near the Salt Lake City Center (CC1) - Swimming Pool Bus Stop. The ambiance was really quiet and enjoyable with very soothing traditional Chinese instrumental was playing on. The stuffs were courteous but a little slow in taking the order.
We had ordered Stir-fried Chicken with Basil & Green and Red Pepper Chicken in starters and Chef's recommended CHOWMANs Special Noodles as main course and CHOWMAN's Special chicken as side dish (though it was a bit blunt per my taste). And 3 Fresh Lime Soda. The bill amount is Rs. 1206.00 (may vary per VAT and other taxes). The tastes were so good and chickens were real juicy and tender with perfect blend of the spices. It was one of my best gastronomical experience in recent days.

I go gaga over tasty Chinese food in any city I go too and Chowman is another addition to that set.. Having visited Salt Lake, my friends and I thought we could order from Chowman. 
We ordered Schezwan fried rice( hot!! ) , Pan fried Chicken ( hot but great taste ) , Prawns in pepper garlic sauce ( decent but could not get the luxurious taste of prawns )..
A little on the expensive side but a must try for Chinese!!

Chowman is one of those places with good ambiance, good decor and very reasonable food rates for decent quality and good-taste food. The pan fried noodles to chicken starters all are fine. The dishes wouldn't make you go wow in your mouth but then its the place for Indian Chinese.. We went couple of times in very big groups of 30 to 40 ppl and they accomodated.

Calm serene amazing Chinese and wonderful service, I visited Chowman on 28th of March as it was my Husband's bday. We were looking around for good Chinese and so immediately checked the reviews on Zomato and made a quick decision. The quick decision was worth it. I loved the ambience, it gave me a very Buddha monastery feeling, the lights were calm and the service was genuine. 
Must try: chicken thick coriander soup and prawn pepper fry!!

The ambiance and decor of Chowman is a treat to eyes. The soft music playing in the background is an add on. The meaning of "dining" is clearly understandable here.¬†

We started with Lung Fung Soup and Roast Pork as starters. The Pork tasted good and was surprisingly soft which was a delight to taste buds. The Lung Fung soup was tasty but not that thick. It surprised me a bit as the thickness of this particular soup is its specialty.¬†We had Chowman Special Noodles which was bit spicy. ¬†As a side dish we had Prawn in Oyster Sauce which was an absolutely delight to the Taste buds. The quantity was more than sufficient for two.

I must add here that the service was excellent and very professional.

Hello FOlks!!
I have been to this particular Outlet with my partner for over 50 times(at least).
Whatever the Occassion is I olwes take my friends and family out here. I'll be covering every aspect of this restaurant to the core. :). 
P.S.- I AM A BIGTYM FOODIE!. So u have to be patient, its a LONG and DETAILED review.
--> InTeriors:- 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† There is a Big buddha statue and U will olwes get the feel of a chinese restaurant as soon as u enter here.
They play Various chinese instrumental tunes on the loop. I now even know which songs comes after which one( though at first every tune seemd ol d same).
The seats are comfortable and the tables are big enough to accomodate all the dishes u order unlike in some places where it gets congested.
There is a Reddish feel in the place with the lighting complementing the decors.
-->> STAFF:-
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Very friendly I must say. Let me give u all an instance. Once we complained about the SeaFoof Rice we ordered which tasted a bit "tasteless". They instantly offered to replace it without an ask. But we being a little shy refrained. :P
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They provide Free WIFI also though the manager who knows the Password happens to come in the Evening. So better luck next time if u visit in the afternoon! And most important thing ....They happen to reccommend the dishes very aptly unlike in some other restaurants where we got trolled by the staff.
--->>> FOOD :-
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Coming to most important aspect of any restaurant, the FOOOOOOD!!...
I have tried olmost ALL their chicken dishes in the main course (if not all) and most of their starters as well because of my more than frequent visits over the past year. In general All their dishes are VERY WELL COOKED.. CHInese dishes are all about the timing as to how much to steam and and how much to boil. They get it done with aplomb! The chicken (watever dish it may be) are succulent and very juicy from the inside. lOOKING AT THE DISHES U GET A PREMIUM FEEL. :D
Now to the specifics:-
1. Schezwan Chilli Baby Corn:- Tasty and medium spicy . Very well cooked! Must for Veggies.
2. Konjee Crispy Lamb:- Very Crispy as per the name. In fact more than crispy. Personally It wasnt my favrite although my partner happend to like it very mch. The chicken here is not soft. Rather it got a very munched feel to it
3. Sliced chicken SCHezwan style:- Nothing to describe. Age old dish . Spicy
4. BarbeQue Chicken:- This is my favrite chinese dish. The sauce with which they cook deserves a spl mention of its own. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
¬†¬†¬†¬† 
¬† ¬†¬† U can try out rest of the starters and In case u r confused and wandering in the dark ... the Staff is more than happy to help!!

Among the rice section, right from the Traditional Schezwan fried rice to the very new Basil Fried rice, every single dish STANDS out against each other. I often wonder what if I had one of their cooks as a friend of mine! :D :D
SPECIAL MENTION to the SEAFOOD FRIED RICE and CRAB MEAT RICE...I tasted Crab for the first in this very restaurant and as usual it did not dissapoint me.. Very soft and tenderly cooked with just the right amount of salt and spices. Personal favrites ...these two dishes.!

NOODLES:- the quantity looks more in the rice section than the noodles section in my opinion.Pan fried noodles comes in gravy. ALL the others ..NOT!
RICE NOODLES:- A very unsual dish from an INDIAN point of View. U should try it just to know what they are. I wont be delving into details here. All iI can say is the same old line...U 'LL NOT be DISSAPOINTED... :D

CHICKEN(MAINS) and LAMB:- The recommended dishes are :-
1. CHilli Garlic Chicken in RED BELL PEPPER( A Personal Favrite. Tastes Perfect)
2. Kung Pao chicken: comes with cashew nuts
3. Chowmans spl Chicken:- comes with extra vegetables and spices. Try it ONCE!
4. Teriyaki CHicken. Though I dont remember how does it taste( Been there many times..so....i cant understand) but all I remember is I have tried it more than once because of its Taste!
¬†¬† If u r a regular or more than Often visitor, Try out the other dishes as well like SWEET and Sour CHICKEN, Honey CHicken, Sliced Chicken in Oyster Sauce etc etc.
N.B. -THEY ALSO SERVE THAI!!! 

---->>>>CONCLUSION:-
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I got to know about this place searching through Zomato and now Its my Favourite food destination. The COST IS VERY MUCH POCKET FRIENDLY. Quantity good. Quality- Do i even need to say ?? :D...
They even give u chloroMints at the end along with Panmasal and ol that stuff!

BOTTOMLINE:- ¬† ¬† IF u are a chinese food lover U NEED to..in fact U MUST VISIT this PLACE. TRUST ME.. U will leave this place WITH A SMILE AND A SATISFIED BELLY!
I RATE THIS AS 4.9 outta 5 because NO ONE¬† IS PERFECT!

Chowman is clearly one of the best Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. ¬†As soon as I entered the place, the ambiance and the smell of good Chinese food made me realize that I was in the right place.

The Chowman's Favorite Soup and the Pan Fried Chilly Fish was very tasty and I gobbled them up within minutes. :D

The Schezwan Chicken Noodles and the Prawn in Black Pepper Sauce was equally tasty. The food was perfectly cooked and the service was good. The quantity was also very good.

Overall I loved the food @Chowman and it is a must go for Chinese food lovers.

Chowman; It's one of the finest Chinese restaurant in the city. Being a regular one, I don't get bored here. The food is extremely tasty. Ambience is perfect & one would feel as if we are sitting in a restaurant of China. A beautiful statue of Buddha, soothing lights & alpha music... It's really a good place to have a very reasonable dinner. Waiters are very courteous and are always very patient. They suggest you with the choice of your taste.
One must go for pan fried chilli fish, lat mai chicken, mixed fried rice & fish Manchurian... I loved them all here.
I would just like to add pinch of salt to the dishes as we Indians love to add & have Indo-Chinese always.
Overall a great place to fill up your appetite.

Thank You

Had a super awesome time with friends.it as raining outside when we reached, the staff were outside our car door with their large umbrella. Once inside the ambience was lovely, soft lighting,spacious sitting arrangement, the decor is really well planned, and soft Chinese music playing in the background that is sure to do good to your mood and your hunger. The place is large and well planned out and can accommodate large groups quite comfortably . The staff is extremely courteous right from the moment you are seated. They help you in selecting your dishes and their suggestions all went right . Also they have a good knowledge of the menu and the dishes which is not a regular feature in Kolkata restaurants.
The serving time was really short , the food preapared with really short waiting time but with no loss of taste. The soups were excellent, the thick lung fung soup light and thick , the spicy Thai soup just right without burning the palate. The starters were well prepared, both fish and chicken . We had rice noodles and fried rice, both were good. The main dishes were good in quantity and 2 is enough for three people.
The pricing was reasonable, as you will expect in a restaurant of its class. Didn't have dessert this time . Just gave 4.5 and not 5 so that scope for improvement remain. Looking forward to visiting again as well as the other branches and also to having desserts the next time.

No doubt Chowman is one of the best Chinese cuisine restaurant in salt lake. Nice ambiance, decent service, good food and not so pricey! I have been to this particular outlet few times, and was never disappointed. They have quite a no of tables to accommodate about 40-50 people. But may be crowded during the weekends. Ambiance is nice,it is quite dark inside, they have imposed a black and red theme but lightings are enough to do the main job. I have tried Konjee Crispy Lamb, Pan fried Chilly fish, Sanghai Chicken noodles, Singapore Chicken Noodles, Chowman special chicken and Chicken Manchurian. Pan fried Chilly fish and Chowman special chicken are my favourites, and would be my recommendation. Chowman special chicken is prepared with white sauce and exotic vegetables, and very light in taste like a typical Chinese dish.¬†

Overall its a great place for Chinese lovers.Food - 3.5

In saltlake, if anyone is looking for good food, I must say Chowman it is, in chinese. Everything from the decor to the food was in one word, awesome. The only con I felt was that the tables are a bit small, but everything else stands out. 
The food was great, tasty and well garnished, with the quantity no short. 

If anyone is looking for good Chinese,  Chowman it is.. It outclasses many other restaurants by a distance.

The American chopsuey is worth a mention. The cost was very reasonable coming to around 340 per person with taxes and tip. Recommended?

Chowman stands out from the crowd because of its ambience and food. me and my two friends visited here recently and I was awestruck to see the deƒáor. We ordered one noodles and one rice dish for the mains and two side chicken dish. along with that we had cold drinks and mocktails. The quantity was so much that we had to pack some at the end of the meal. The food was delicious. kung pao chicken is a must try. The bill came a little less than rs. 1300 for 3 people ordering 4 items plus non alcoholic drinks. quite affordable. The top of the cherry was the behaviour of the manager and other staff. They were extremely polite and even asked us, while we were having the food, wether or not we are comfortable with everything.

The Chinese and Buddhist backdrop is really beautiful. Coming to the food, the menu boasts of a variety of Chinese dishes along with Thai cuisine as well. If you are a fish lover, then definitely try out Prawn Ka Seong, kits absolutely sumptuous. The rest of the main course was also delectable. The staff is very vigilant and helpful. All in all a nice place to go for a quite dinner with family and friends.

Chowman is a great place for good Indian Chinese food. A bunch of us went there for the first time around December, and didn't stop. Great chicken and pork dishes, double fried pork, roast chilli pork, chicken gravies and good sumptuous rice and noodles make sure you get a value for money. In the weekend after 9 it gets really crowded, but their service is quite prompt, and they have enough waiters ensuring a quick turn around time! Worth a visit every time!

Cannot complain much about this place, based on zomato review went in to this restaurant with family a month ago. ambience is good, service is prompt and adequate, menu is quite elaborate , need few more visits to actually sum up a review, so my this review is purely based on my first visit and a regular chinese food order.
pros- ambience, service staff, menu, cost effective, location with respect to my abode
cons- the fried rice and the special chicken dish were not such so as to attract me to this place again for it.
having said that, every place has a special dish of its own,so may b i have got to explore some more stuff there to make a good opinion, nonetheless would luv to visit it again and would recommend ppl 2 visit the restaurant.

Been there on valentines day..space not that big. Food was awesome. Must try:: prawns in starter(don't remember the exact name..prawns seong something..),chilli fish tossed in wine(try this in main course).
Ordered crispy cronjee lamb in starters. It was not at all good as the lamb was not well cooked.
In main course we ordered Cantonese noodles ,Chowman special noodles and Kung Pao Chicken.
If you want to try out gravy based noodles then please go for Cantonese noodles.
Chowman special noodles did not taste speci to us. I seriously dont know why they call it special because I found it pretty mediocre.
Kung pao chicken was awesome because of its cashew based red gravy.
The only thing I did not like was their management. They really struggled to allocate tables for us. 0.5 deducted for that.

Later when we wanted the food to be delivered at home they refused when my home was just 3 kms from Chowman saltlake. They said very rudely that we wont deliver you can do what you want...

After a long wait finally the day arrived when we got some time to explore Chowman. Lots of great reviews heard and read over Zomato, and mine will happily add to the count. :)
Located in Salt lake, near swimming pool area. On road parking is avialable around the restaurant. 
Food was delightful, and so was the decoration. Whereas not heavenly costly, I would say food was worthy of the price. 
Ordered american corn, pan fried chilly chin, Wantons and Pad Thai for lunch. Finally darsan with ice cream for dessert. Everything was so well cooked and fresh. 
Small word of caution: pad Thai seemed little over chillified, so next time will ask to make it not-so-hot while ordering. 
I loved this restro on my first sight. Would love to come back and explore more!

Located near Swimming Pool, it is one of the best Chinese Restaurant that I have visited till date in Kolkata. It serves Authentic Chinese cuisine.
1. Wanton Salad - Great in taste and large portion.
2. Chilly garlic noodles - It had a good flavour.
3. Diced potatoes with american corn - Delicious is the only word.
The service is quick and good. It is a restaurant which provides a calm and peaceful atmosphere wanted by most of us. The decor is apt as per the Chinese cuisine, for example it provides Chopsticks unlike other Chinese restaurants. Reasonably priced. It excels in providing quality food. A must visit.
Great Experience. Going to visit again very soon. Keep up the good work.

Was jst passing by wen i noticed this plc... So thought of tryng it... And it must b said tht this plc didnt leave me dissapointed at all... Good chinese food, prices not too high and the restaurant is nicely done up.  Salt Lake needed a place like Chowman badly since i personally dnt lyk most of the food joints out there but the great food makes up for it. It has an authentic taste which is very refreshing.. Not the typical chinese food.. We had ordered crispy chilli babycorn fr starters which was mouth watering.. Fr main course we went in for chilli garlic chicken in red bell pepper, kung pao chicken along with a veg and a prawn fried rice.. None of the items dissapointed us though... This plc is not only recommended fr good food but also fr its interiors along with the service it serves.. Overall an excellent place !! Waiting frwrd to visitng it agn !!

After a successful Puja festival, the four of us decided to celebrate dinner at Chowman. It was my first visit here, so I left the job of ordering to the others. 
We entered at around 9.15pm on a Sunday, and got a table in a few minutes. 

Barbeque chicken was taken as the starter. The pieces were tender and the entire dish was superbly done. Undoubtedly, it was finished in the flick of an eye! 

Our main course included Chilli Garlic Chow, Chicken Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken and Chicken in Oyster Sauce. That was quite enough for the four of us. The entire meal was a happy one, with the tantalizing combination of the tangy and spicy Kungpao Chicken with the delicious Chicken in Oyster Sauce. We couldn't have Darsaan for desserts due to our respective deadlines (its preparation takes about 40 minutes). 

The soft lights make it a very good dining place for all occasions. 
Special thanks to the staff who tolerated my rants of clicking photos of every dish being served, that too with a wide smile. 
Looking forward to visiting again soon. :)

Good place, good ambiance and but as a Chinese restaurant nothing more to offer rather then those schezwan, stir fried and chilli garlic sauce preparations. But enjoyed the place a lot and experienced how to gorge in on Chinese food with a pair of Chopsticks, done it like a pro. 

Service is also good and value for money place, don't make deep cuts your pocket much. Must try the full roasted duck and prawns. Will try to go to this place once again.

* I decided to edit my review and give higher ratings; just cause I absolutely love this place. *
¬†The first thing that I loved about this place was the ambiance and decor ( and also the music that always plays softly) . It really brings an oriental vibe, which sets the mood for great food.¬†
The people are very hospitable, polite and helpful, always with a smile on their face. If youre there during the peak hours , you'll have to wait long for your dishes though.¬†
Coming to the main thing, the food is absolutely delicious here. And at unbelievable prices. The singapore noodles, teriyaki chicken, shanghai noodles, wantons, chicken tossed in chilli garlic sauce, the chopsuey are a few delicacies I would suggest.¬†
Only thing that had gone wrong during our first visit was, they brought us the wrong order once, but they changed it immediately.

Visited this place after reading positive reviews, but unfortunately this outlet is not as good as the Ballygunge Place outlet,  at least not for us.

It all started from that sudden craving of Chinese food you have during weekends. I had already seen and heard quite a number of positive reviews on this joint and so couldn't think of any place else to relish an authentic Chinese platter. 

The location might be a tad remote for those living outside Saltlake but I can guarantee you that once you step in, you'll not regret. Call it the staff service, the plush interiors (that Buddha statue is mesmerising!) or the quality of food, everything was just too perfect. I even loved the menu booklet and spent time reading the first page which shows the amount of dedication these guys have towards making your outdoor restaurant meal extraordinary. Both my fianc√© and me agree on this and are looking forward to celebrating more moments at Chowman in the near future.

Now coming to the food we had, I have to say that I regret the fact that we didn't have that big an appetite yesterday. So, we had to go for a short meal instead of our usual gigantic ones. Here's what we ordered:

1. Chicken Meat Ball Soup - Tasted just like a soup should taste which, am afraid, tastes more like rice starch elsewhere. This one was light, had equal proportion of all tastes and yum meatballs. The veggies were boiled to perfection as well.

2. Shanghai Style Chicken Meifoon - Rice noodles that blended every taste beautifully. You might as well try it with some gravy but we preferred eating just the noodles. I liked the mushrooms more than the chicken though (*personal favorite)

3. Darsan with icecream - Again a personal favorite and the best way I can consume extra calories. The Darsans were too crunchy and tasted superb with the icecream. Nothing special about the recipe but the fact that it tasted right was all I wanted. I believe some recipes are best when you don't experiment with them.

Okay, that was my biggest review on zomato till date. Given the plans I already have of revisiting the joint, I think this list will stretch even more.

Wandering to visit there for a long time but didn't make it. Today had the chance so utilized it. Its not that hard to locate. Now starting from the ambience. Its was really one of the best ambiance i have ever had in my life. The ambiance tells that its a classy place.  Now about the food. We were just 2 people & were not so hungry. So just ordered a soup fried rice & dragon chicken. Didn't take so much time to deliver the food. The taste was really good. My friend even told me that its one of the best Chinese food she ever had even i also felt the same. The food was really something. Well hope that they keep providing us these kind of good food. Seeing to visit there very soon.

One of the rarest Chinese restaurants of Kolkata, where there is the availability of pork.
A sheer heaven for pork lovers like me.

Now, if you are visiting Chowman for a true gastronomically delightful experience, coupled with a magnanimous Oriental interior design, you are definitely at the right place!
For the starters, Dragon Chicken and crispy wontons are a must.
For the entr√©es, Meifoon and any pork side dish is pure nirvana for me.
Don't waste your money in useless soups.
Eat wisely.

Only turn off: Reservation for the seats, in advance.
And the service needs to be quicker.

I haven't gone to this place to eat but have always ordered in. Didn't like it very much. The wantons are one thing I love about Chowman. The noodles are okayish. The crispy chilli babycorn we ordered wasn't  crispy at all. Maybe all the glowing reviews are regarding the non-vegetarian food. The vegetarian food is average. But, the wantons. *_*

I understand it is a good restaurant. I had been there today. Ambience is very good. However food quality is really bad. It is terribly hot and overdose of vinegar made the veg dish and chicken dish impossible to consume. Hope it is noted for improvement.

Chowman at Golfgreen made a so-so impression on me , still I paid a visit to their Saltlake branch, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed.

At the happening block of saltlake swimming pool, opposite the CCD, resides the saltlake branch of Chowman. I entered expecting nothing much and was pretty surprised to see lovely d√©cor, ambiance and soothing music welcoming me. I must stress on the d√©cor and congratulate Debaditya Chaudhury for nailing the concept of how a Chinese restaurant should feel, look and be.Their new card which looked like a book impressed me as well. Now coming to the food. Much much better than my golfgreen experience. We ordered pork, soup, pan fried noodles. Well, to be completely honest pan fried noodles was disappointing as it was not really pan fried but mostly Cantonese style. But the pork dish made up well for it.Price is not too high.Saltlake Chinese lovers do pay a visit, and the place is huge so a huge party ??? not a problem !!

---- Changing rating: It's been quite sometime, the quality of Chowman is degrading by the day!!! Be it the home delivery food, take out food or dining food, disappointed for the last 6 times, now that's some count!! Not expected!¬†
If you detail, well the noodles are too dry and tasteless, the momos are blaah! , the gravies have too much cornflour which makes them too thick!! and many more.... I am changing my rating !

Who said good food cannot come at affordable prices.
Chowman is it's perfect example
5 people gulping down authentic Chinese cuisine
And at a cost of 2000
That's about 400 p.p
And the food wow
You can't complain one bit about anything
Well to now I didn't have to
Just one problem small seating space if only restaurant could be bigger 
Then wouldn't have to wait so long in queue

visited this restaurant on Christmas Eve. went there at around 9 pm with one of my friends and there was a loooong queue but got our after 10 minutes because we were group of two. Ordered Konjee crispy chicken, Cowman's special mixed noodles, honey chicken and a crab meat item. crispy chicken, Cowman's special mixed noodles and honey chicken were very good in taste but the crab was just ok. Excellent food, but not that excellent service. The food is some of the tastiest Chinese you will get! The only con I would say is that the place is a bit small.

Good chinese food, prices not too high and the restaurant is nicely done up. ¬†Salt Lake needed a place like Chowman badly.¬†
located near the swimming pool Dominoes, the place is a bit difficult to get to. but the great food makes up for it.
its a refreshing break from the usual "chili-chicken-chowmein" staple that most bangalis adore.
amazing pork , chicken in teriyaki sauce and yummy noodles are just some of the things one should try out.
although the staff is usually polite, one instance left a bad taste in our mouth- that is when we were handed our bill even before we asked for it. it wasn't even like there was a huge line waiting, infact, it was around 8 pm and there were a couple of empty tables around us. and we weren't creating a ruckus. so that was a bit uncalled for. but other than that, cant complain!
hope the prices, quantity and taste remain the same !!

This is the first time I had dinner there, the ambience is good but a little bit congested. Quality of the food is excellent (3 points to the quality!). Reasonable price along with fair serving (.5 points to that!) made our purse happy :D. But, the reception was too cold towards us. Manager was rude and arrogant. The service was not so good (can be considered as a bad one). Did not find them polite at all!! They take too much of time to prepare and serve the food (had ordered a cold drink when starter was served and got it at our table while we were half way through the main course i.e. 30 mins later! ). Over all, will I go there again? NO. Will I go for a home deliver? MAY BE.

Went to chowman on 30th December 2014 after learning that they were having duck festival.Nice ambience , plenty of options in a nicely designed menu-card. Ordered veg Singapore noodles, mushroom pepper salt and ¬†Spicy Hunan Roasted Duck with Basil. The last item was priced at 520+tax! Mushroom and noodles were served quickly and the staff were polite.Noodles tasted good and serving size seemed fair. Mushroom though tasted good but quantity was not satisfactory.
Then came the real shocker! The duck item arrived in a medium sized bowl.......mostly bones with little bit of meat attached here and there(2 pieces were entirely bones)......paired with few slices of different-coloured capsicum. There were hardly two pieces of duck-meat altogether......it took a lot of effort to detach them from bones....and to do that we had to forget all our table manners. Duck meat tasted somewhat like chicken though lot more greasier. Not complaining about the taste since had no prior experience in duck meat.¬†

This whole DUCK FESTIVAL thing is a HOAX......a nasty trick to attract people and dupe them with exorbitant pricing. Feeling robbed of and infuriated after paying 600+ for two peaces of meat.....what else to call this except DAYLIGHT ROBBERY.Please don't encourage them by visiting.

Nice spread of duck, lamb and pork, nice reception and good ambience. What more to make a family dinner pleasant!! The pocket pinch is also moderate. A dinner for 3 will set you back by approx 1400. (They dont accept tips) However, there is a space crunch specially in d weekends. Overall, recommended and you will want to visit Chowman again!!

Yes...ever since i had set foot at Chowman and tasted the food there, there is no way that i can be taken anywhere else for Chinese. My recent visit surprised me when i got to know that they have their Duck Festival on for the Christmas New Year season, so gave that a try as well. And i must say it was amazing, ¬†lip smacking.. the duck was so well cooked and the flavours infused so well that i could not stop raving about it ¬†for the rest of the day. This is something truly different that they have come up with. Chowman takes the cake yet again...

Take away lunch experience started with a big disappointment, they didnt have prawn today, lack of waiting arrangement, for whom, who came for take away the lunch like us...etc!
The 'food' came with a very impressive 'attire' , in well packed container.
We had, chilli garlic noodles (it was ok, but I think they need to add more sauce components), chicken fried rice (as we don't want to experiment with rice, we ordered it....but unfortunately it came with a disaster, it was like boiled rice with few shredded chicken), kung pao chicken gravy (yummy) and last but not least at all, but it was a best.... pan fried hot garlic fish!
Overall I would say, '(chow ) Man you need more polishing'

Located near salt lake swimming pool, Chowman is one of the best Chinese restaurant in whole of salt lake area in my opinion. 

The place might look small once you enter but due to various small sections inside, it accommodates a good number. The decor and ambiance is the only let down as it gives a very small and congested feel inside. No matter how much I was liking the food here, I could feel the urge to complete my meal and leave. The staff is warm and polite. The pricing is pretty reasonable though serving sizes are fair, not so much on  generous side. But a good thing is that they are open all day so one need not visit only during lunch or dinner hours.

Coming to food, soups were pretty good and I loved the clear soup. The stir fry tofu was superb for a starter. The burnt ginger fried rice and stir fried veg in pepper garlic sauce tasted very good. So food wise, they are excellent !!!

Overall, superb food, reasonably priced, all day dining, not so great ambiance !!!

Went to Chowman since they were having the duck festival, but by the time I reached on Sunday evening all of the duck delicacies were sold out, so had no option but try their regular menu.
But I would say that it was also pretty awesome. The menu was quite elaborate which gave the choice to choose between chicken, fish,crab, lamb & pork. In the starters had Prawn ka Seong which was very tasty. For main course had two different varieties of fried rice, one being thai styled and chili garlic hakka noodles. Along with it we had Chicken in oyester sauce and Devils lamb. Both went very well with the rice. So overall a nice experience even without the duck but will be visiting soon to try out their duck delicacies.

CHOWMAN, BF Block, Salt Lake, 20.12.2014, 9:30 pm

Having ordered home deliveries four times before, we were confident our visit to ChowMan would be a better gastronomic experience. Most of us (2 vegetarians and 5 non-vegetarians, 3 of them under 10 years) were excited about their ongoing ‚ÄòDuck Festival‚Äô. Unfortunately ChowMan is changing ... already. And it seems the road ahead is downhill.

First the prices had been revised. And a pretty steep revision at that. But who minds paying some more for good quality and wholesome quantity, right? That‚Äôs what got my goat. One plate of a duck starter that costs Rs 560 minus taxes had eight microscopic pieces ‚Äì two wings, four assorted sections of ribcages and two indistinguishable bits of bones. But the capsicum and the onions dressing all around it was tasty as were the soup and the other starters we ordered. I summoned the manager and said politely how I knew that the duck was a small bird but surely there would be two legs and two breast pieces in its little body. To not find one good piece in a plate was disappointing. What was even more disappointing was the manager immediately fishing out his cellphone, saying Hello to whoever it was or wasn‚Äôt on the other side and simply walking away.

I strongly wished to pursue the matter, especially when I realised that he was not coming back to make amends, but the children were tired and we had to leave.

ChowMan may still find patrons who will happily pay Rs 600 for a plate of bones to chew, but I doubt if I‚Äôll be one anymore.

This was my 3rd visit to chowman and 2nd visit to salt lake outlet of this restaurant,my experience here was mind blowing as was my previous visit. I went there with my family,and i assured them that they would love this place as i loved it and they were ready to take a shot on my reference,and as was predicted,they really loved this place just like me. The ambience here would really take you away to china,though i haven't visited china myself yet i can imagine what it would be like over there and this place made me really feel like am in china:-P:-P
They serve you in an atmosphere where they play chinese tracks,the decor,the wallpapers,the buddha statue,the big bell,everything is so perfect and 'chinese'. They even put chopsticks on your table,in case(unlike me) if you can really use them for eating. Their service is really quick,their behaviour really hospitable and welcoming and their food totally upto the mark,though the price is a bit on the higher side. Why i deducted 1 mark is because of their quantity,i feel like they should increase a bit more quantity,especially their desserts. Only 2 scoops normal vanilla ice cream with a few walnuts cost me 170 bucks which i feel was a waste of money. Moreover,they don't really have much choices of desserts,and in the variations they have,most of the items aren't available. They should stress a bit more on the desserts. With a bill of rs 2013,though it was bit of a pocket pinch,still that was worth it. I would really love to visit this place again!

If you want a good chinese meal at a good price along with a delightful ambiance then chowman is the place.
After trying out ballygunge's chowman twice this year, I finally decided to try out this outlet and I must say I was not disappointed. Infact this outlet is better. It is spacious and well decorated.
Today we ordered konjee crispy chicken, kung pao chicken, shrimp fried rice and my must have fresh lime soda.
The starter was crispy and perfectly cooked. The kung pao chicken was really tasty and the fried rice was so good. But the fresh lime soda was not chilled..still It was ok. I had a great time...wish to come here again.

If you happen to be in Salt Lake Kolkata, and are craving for some good-old Chinese cuisine to munch on without burning a hole in your pocket, this is the place you come to. This was one of the best Chinese I have had in this city. It has all the right elements you need for that dine out with family, that get together with friends, or a dinner date!

Serene ambiance
Mouth watering Chinese food
Quality Service

Starters are ammazing, they give you that sly hint of whats about to come next.
Main Course will introduce you to a whole new level of food-induced-satiation.
Desserts - Well desserts are desserts, who hates 'em?!

This place is definitely a must go for everyone atleast once, if not more!

PS: They have a book-size menu, so do consult the waiters on the bests and specials, they are jolly good fellows and will help you with a smile!

Tried their egg riced noodles and Chilli Mustard fish. Both the dishes were really good and complemented each other perfectly. The rice noddles could have been less dry. It seemed that they had been reheated too much due to which they had lost their moisture. The Chilli Mustard fish was tangy to just the right amount. The delivery was also prompt.

The place is all about good tasty food and relaxing environment. If you are looking for an ideal place for sea foods then this is your must visit restaurant. I and my friends were there to dine and we were satisfied fully after a hectic day. I can‚Äôt do without rice wherever I go and was happy to find their good offerings of rice items. After taking little time in discussion, we ordered prawn Thai style fried rice. This one I tried for the first time and it was truly worth a try. With that lemon chicken was good; the gravy of the chicken was simply delicious and tempting. Surely I will try that again. Also one fish item was must, so we ordered steamed fish in any sauce, though my friends ordered fish in chili mustard sauce. I tasted little from that and it was mouth watering. Also we had the yummy mixed vegetables in white sauce. This spicy item was simply delicious with rice. All the vegies were cooked nicely in the masala. We had one crab item, the very popular steamed crab in ginger wine sauce. Lastly we had lychee with vanilla ice cream. Every item was appetizing and irresistible. They not only focus on the taste of the food, but also on the whole presentation of the food. All my friends are waiting to go there again and again as the place is unique with its offerings. Each one has its own individual taste and flavour.

Statutory Warning : Spicy words (written under the influence of a red chilly powder coated stomach)
If you are in love with authentic Chinese cuisine then this is a place you should avoid. But if you are a Indian food Craver who thinks Chinese food to be bland, then you'll love the food here. Unfortunately all the dishes I ordered tonight were red... Chicken Tai Pai, Chowman SPL rice and noodles, Chilli red wine fish ... All of these. And red means ample amount of red chilli powder. Surprisingly ( luckily for me ) the rice and the noodles were so sweet that I passed up on desserts.

The ambience was good and the staff were courteous. The quantity of the starters were OK, but the main course had hearty portions. The pricing is reasonable. But I have seen my share of red and will not visit again.

Chowman....Best Chinese Restaurant in Salt Lake area...
Have been there atleast 10 times and ordered home delivery couple of times....
The ambience is very cosy and has great feeling.¬†
Waiters are helping to choose the food..Menu is interesting...
I simply love their pork preparations..whether its roasred pork chilly or pork thai red/green curry or roasted pork in variety of choices of sauce...
Chilly chicken is awesome...but need to work on their garlic chicken...not so fancy n tasty...
Meinfoon(rice noodles) is simply yum, hakka noodles r best, Kung pao chicken is to try for...nice one..Mixed fried rice, I think all thier fried rice is great..
Home delivery is good too..nice packing...
I always go Chowman for their Pork preparation..
I wish they can provide us ROAST pork with barbeque sauce...just like sizzlers...
My fav chinese restaurant in Salt Lake.. :)

Cheers!!!!!

Went to chowman for dinner today and was very impressed. Every thing was perfect interiors were warm and chic. Coming to the food 
1. We ordered manchow soup which I liked very much properly cooked was simple and light.
2. We ordered crispy american corns which is a favorite and it was good nothing great though.
3.in the mains we ordered fried rice which was good rice noodles which was amazingly good and it's rare to find them at every Chinese joints it was very nice and light also. We also ordered devils choice vegetables and it was amazingly good and I m sure it would definitely tickle your taste buds if you are in for something really spicy yet simple. The hot sauce provided with the condiments was also good.finally a great Chinese joint at salt lake which prepares Chinese for which its popular simple and light. But the major highlight of the restaurant is the service and the staffs which make u believe that guests are king. Lastly the prices were reasonable and portions very generous. Keep up!!

I had the worst home delivery experience, they didn't get the whole order, when told they missed the order they completely denied that It was a mistake from there end. Even after having a conversation with the manager we didn't get the order. The worst service I ever got from any restaurant. As I can't give negative or zero so one.

Hail ho chowman. I am a regular customer of chowman and yes "it's awesome!!" ease please please if you like bland Chinese food then you must visit chowman. food is super awesome, quantity to very good. i have tried most if the dishes and a quick note from my view; rice prep is much much better than noodles. so please if you visit chowman, hava one crab meat rice and coriander fish or fish buckchoy. ( i think i misspelled it :-P ) So, once again. hail ho.. Chowman!!! :-)

Chowman has successfully changed the food scene of Salt Lake, especially as far as Chinese restaurants are concerned. Done up in the regal colours of black, red and gold, the decor of the restaurant is understated yet grand.¬†
But, Chowman is the place which prefers to talk through its delicious food: whether its home delivery or a eat out, Chowman is the perfect place for a leisurely meal.¬†
In the starters section, the must-haves are Prawn ka Seong, Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Konjee Crispy Lamb. The quality of the food is top-notch.¬†
Also recommended is the Manchow Soup, the hot and sour taste, along with the crispy fried noodles on top give it a very different taste.¬†
Though all the items on the menu are delicious, Chowman's forte clearly lies in the seafood. Don't miss the Fish in Chilli Mustard Sauce, Hong Kong Fish (on the home delivery menu), and Coriander Fish. Chicken in Chilli Wine, with its subtle hint of wine, is clearly among my list of favourites on the poultry section.¬†
Even if you go are attracted by the good old Hakka Noodles, you could try out the Chicken Chilli Garlic Noodles, or the Shanghai Noodles, which are very different from the staple fare of Noodles served in most Chinese restaurants.¬†
All in all, Chowman is a restaurant that I keep returning to, because of the food, and the courteousness of the staff who make every dining experience a special one.

Chowman means Chinese with a twist.... It cannot vouch for authentic Chinese cuisine..but whatever it serves is certainly a delight for your taste buds.. The ambiance is good but a bit congested during the peak hours! We tried the teriyaki chicken.. Singapoori noodles.. Red & green pepper chicken.. Thai mixed rice.. & all were superb in taste.. Overall it's a nice place to dine in with friends & family.. Without burning a hole in your pocket!  
Decor : 3/5
Food : 4/5
Service : prompt 4/5
Overall : 4/5

Went to chowman for a family dinner and my  experience was strictly so so.
First of all I loved the decor of the place. The walls, the lighting, the chairs and most of all the mats on the table and the little circles of paper with the chowman logo beneath your glasses that gave the impression of the chowman logo floating on top of your glasses. Nice.
We ordered a herb veg fried rice, egg mein foon, lamb in devil's sauce and honey lemon fish. The egg mein foon was good but the noodles didn't have the glassy texture expected of rice noodles. The honey lemon fish was delicious and perhaps the best dish of the 4. Its gravy was silken and flavours were just right. Thumbs up. The herb rice was decent enough again but the lamb was absolutely horrible. The sauce was ok but the lamb itself was tough, stringy and quite inedible. When i brought it to the waiter's notice. He promptly agreed to change it. He informed that they had no better lamb that night and replaced that with a kung pao chicken. The replacement arrived in 5 minutes time but it wasn't good. The gravy was too thin and pretty tasteless. Dissapointed.
The service is cordial and fast. But there needs to be a lot more coordination between the kichen and the waiters. I should have been informed that lamb wasn't good that night!
The portions of food were decent and the cost is decent as well. A decent place for chinese but nothing special.

Amazing home delivery service ! Yesterday I had a family get together and ordered from the delivery menu given here ! It was a quite a big order for 6 heads. My home is about 8/9 kms from Chowman, Salt Lake and to my surprise, they delivered in barely 45 mins ! Now the food...Real value for money ! Must recommend Shredded lamb in oyster sauce and thai styled noodles ! that lemon-leaf flavoured thai-styled noodles is so very south east asian !!! And yes, packaging is very attractive ! Good job, Chowman Salt Lake

Visited yesterday for a friend's birthday treat and I must say Chowman is by far the best chinese restruant I have ever come across. Better than couple of restruants I visited at China Town (Tangra). From ouside itself it feels like some typical restruant of China. The ambiance and decor inside is awesome with classic Chinese instrumental being played and walls filled with chinese decor (pics of dragons n feng shui.) Talking about food it was by far the best chinese food I ever had. Ordered one soup and a grilled pork for starter. The soup made me feel like I am sitting in some chinese restruant in china itself and the pork was good too. Coming to main course we ordered two rice items and one fish n chicken items as side dish, sincerely didnt remember the names. The food was great and well prepared with various spices and herbs, the taste of which I could feel genuinely. Overall it was a great experience and ofcourse a treat to remember for a long time. Thanks a lot to Santadeep.

The best Chinese I have ever eaten in and around Calcutta. And, mind that I am a complete foodie. Service time was reasonable, food tastes awesome, ambience excellent, fits your budget, and quantity is more than sufficient. More important, food is not too oily and properly cooked. So if you are a health freak, you will be surprised. I will recommend the special dishes. They are really good. I will also recommend pan fried chilli fish, chilli wine fish, red and green pepper chicken. 

Surely, going to be one of my favorite haunt.

Its highly surprising that the hotel does not have table reservations wherein zomato itself recommends that we reserve a table and go. I called up the hotel once we left home to reserve a table however the staff says that you have come in front of the restaurant show your face to them and then wait for whatever time it takes and then only you would get a place to eat.¬†

Given the high ratings of this place we went there and to our surprise we were made to wait for more than 45 mins to get a place, it seems like each and every staff is doing, like laying the tables, cleaning them etc. which took another 5-10 mins to get us settled. They have no value for other time.

The staff seemed quite disinterested in serving food, taking orders etc.
 However the ambience of the place is good. However this place being a Chinese only food joint but does have chopsticks... Wow!!!

Now coming to the food, i have had the worst hot and sour soup of my life, american choupsey is something that you shouldnt order as well, i guess the chef does not know how to prepare the same. Chilly garlic noodles and Fried rice was edible.

I am surprised given such high ratings the experience, people should be think twice and just not rely on the ratings before heading to this place.

In terms of atmosphere, decor etc, Chowman is definitely one of the nicer restaurants in Salt Lake. But that's about all it gets brownie points for. Incredibly slow service can be excused for quality topnotch food. Alas, not only did we have to wait over 30mins for our starter, and our mains another 30mins after that, but their food was the poorest of poor quality food. Whilst some starters are decent, their "Thai" which is nowhere near Thai! Passing off a chow mein as a Pad Thai! And a yellow curry as a Massaman curry??? If it wasn't so close to our house, I'd probably never go, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone coming from afar.

Located near the Swimming Pool Area in BF block, this is a Chinese restaurant which delivers big time on money and quality. Awesome decor, fantastic ambience and a friendly staff add to its awesome plethora of food. 
Being there around 3 times, I have specially liked their chicken and fish items and the starters are amazing. The top of the list includes : chicken cooked in chilly wine, kung pao chicken,  pan fried chilly fish, devil's chicken. The coriander burnt and capsicum burnt garlic rice are a real treat. 

Recommended for people who want quality Chinese food for affordable prices and have a good time in a quality restaurant.

This is a new place in Sector 1. We went there for some evening snacks.
The ambiance is very impressive. Lot of seating area. Nice lighting. Decorative walls. The staff is good and helpful.

We had Golden Fried Prawns, which were decent. The coating was a bit too thick but then the dish was decent and the prawns were tasty.
Crispy noodle salad was unique and I somehow liked it very much. Kept digging into it.
Lat Mai Kai was also nice. The quality of chicken and the spices were good.
Would have main course and give a better review.
For the time being,
Quantity 3.5/5

To be honest, i didnt like the food here that much. Chinese food in India is the complete opposite of what it is around the world - it is extravagantly spicy when it should be extremely bland. But going by the demand of our tastebuds here, it is just fair. Yet, Chowman disappoints on several grounds. First, the food is oily. No good chinese food is stir fried in vegetable oil; olive oil has raised the taste bar higher. Besides, no other chinese place adds peas to their curry. Why indianise it so much?! And spice it up to no extent! Also, the service was slow and took longer than it should have taken. The drinks menu is tiny and Chowman must learn from other restaurants to serve jasmine tea with the food.

The pluses: rice (which again, was too oily, but tasted right) and the ambiance (although it smelt more like a massage parlour). Not worth a revisit.

After seeing through all the much hyped reviews, i visited this particular chinese cuisine during lunch interval from my office. Coming to that of chinese food, i felt if extremely ordinary with a restro of such reputation. Garlic noodles was the pathetic dish. The quality of noodles was not upto the standard. They say it like hakka noodles, but trust me it was like some roadside stuff being served in a decorated plate.
I would rather reccomend Blue poppy if any one asks me about Chinese cuisine.

This is my second review of this eatery. I visited during the pujo. And we were a group of 10. We had soup and chicken item in starters. Both the types of starters came good. Followed by rice niodles , rice and pan fried noodles. I loved the pan fried noodles. I had it first time. And it was a superb stuff. Overall experience is good. My friends who visited for the first time also liked the food and ambience. Even in peak hours their services and responses were pretty fast. The only small request is next time we go in a big group kindly join the tables :-)

I went with my family and its a perfect place for family dine-out. The quantity of food here is pretty good. So be carefull that you do not order extra.
If you are looking at a chinese restaurant with excellent value for money, this is the place to be.

Chowman has come as rescue for a good chinese restrau in this area. The ambience is soothing and the management is quite sorted and courteous. The offerings are limited for a vegetarian like me still the dishes are tweaked with some flavours and ingredients.. to offer a different taste and experience of the typical Chinese cuisine. A good effort to relive the authentic flavours with contempory twist! 
A good visit and my recommendation is the soups and the burnt garlic rice.
An initiative - Please ask the management itself to resolve the problem, if you face any, before making it to the social media.

I recently visited the saltlake branch during the pujas , and as expected I had to wait about 40 mins to get a table for 2. The ambience was top notch, serving was decent but was quick. We had ordered chilli garlic and schezwan noodles with chicken in black bean sauce. The quantity of the dishes is sufficient and the food is quite delicious. Personaly i expected a few more amount of vegetables in the noodles since we ordered VEG. The chicken in black bean sauce was a bit salty and spicy and had shredded pieces of chicken in it. The prices during the pujas, were a bit elevated which was a partial deal breaker. Overall, it was quite a pleasant experince and we hope to visit here again :)

visited chowman saltlake sec 1 outlet on 30.09.14 at night.the ambiance is good.as chowman is a much talked and over hyped resturant.so my expection is high.
we ordered chicken hot and sour soup
then chicken fried rice and and chicken sweet and sour.
soup's teste well but the fried rice is testeless and too much light.
chicken piece in sweet and sour gravy was good.
i think the price is little bit upper side.
and not a value for money as all item's price is set higher side.
decoration was great.chineese music played nicely.

so overall rating is 3.5 as nutural.

I had read some great reviews of Chowman here at Zomato, and went there tonight hoping for some spectacular food. Well, I was disappointed. 

The decor is magnificent, no doubt about that. The lighting is brilliant, the walls have beautiful wallpapers, the Buddha theme is subtle, and the splashes of red brighten up an otherwise muted restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they serve Octopus and Squid, alongside pork, lamb, fish and chicken, and maybe one of these days, I will go back to have those. But food tonight was nothing to write home about. 

First, the person taking the order had messed up, and instead of Shanghai Noodles, we got Shanghai rice. I ordered Phad Thai, but what arrived was anything but. I have eaten Phad Thai not just in Thailand, but in India as well, and it is always served with a side of red chilli pepper, palm sugar and lemon, and occasionally a wedge of lemon. What I got was an incredibly hot dish with rice noodles that were more than just al dente. There were very few shrimps in it, and practically no eggs. 

The Basil Rice my friend ordered was very dry, but the Shanghai noodles that arrived later was okay. The Teriyaki chicken was...I don't know, hard. Is it really supposed to be so hard that you require considerable muscle power to cut a piece? The Kung Pao was good though, and in spite of the really big slices of chili, wasn't hot. 

But yes, the food is served in huge helpings. I brought most of mine home because you have to be a big eater to finish all that food, and I am not! The bill was decent at 1100, though I imagine the food wouldn't be worth more than 900, with taxes. 

The service staff was polite, and refilled my glass of water without even being called to do that. In fact, the whole process of clearing the table and presenting the bill was done swiftly, which is a definite plus. oh, and the water we were served was just the right temperature - perfect even. 

So yes, even if the food tonight was disappointing (actually very disappointing), the number of positive reviews here, the decor and the availability of octopus means I will go back again.

Had visited this place on two different occasions and was'nt disappointed on either of the two! :)¬†
I 'll quickly get down to all the dishes that i had ordered on both the occasions.For starters i had tried the crispy konjee lamb. Absolutely marvelous! The quantity provided is more than enough for two people.Just go for it.
In the main course I had american chop suey, Wok tossed hakka noodles, Schezwan fried rice, Chowman special fried rice.. All of them have very good quantity and the quality of the food is unquestionable. Specially the chowman special rice is a definite recommendation if u plan to visit this place. The others were excellent too.As a side dish i had Roasted pork in schezwan sauce, Kung Pao chicken, Devils chicken.
First thing first. The pork was simply out of the world. Never had i tasted such succulent,soft pieces of pork that were so well cooked.An amazing dish really.U got to try it!!
Apart from that the Kung Pao chicken and Devils chicken were great too.That is the food.Coming to staff and service.. One of the best services that i ever received in an restaurant. Right from courteous staff to speedy serving. U cant raise a single issue against them. As for the decor.. simply fantabulous! From Oriental chinese music to wood crafts! Everything is just perfect at this place. Every lovebud is gonna enjoy dining out here ;)
To sum up i did'nt have a single bad review for the place.Even the price was very cheap for the amount of food served and for a restaurant of this class!
Thumbs up chowman! (y)

visited the place with family for dinner. its located near swimming pool which is quite convenient to reach. nice decor as well - created a good ambience with chinese music played in the background. the waiters were polite but a bit pushy as in they were trying to suggest stuffs while i did not want them to. however, that did not bother us much. we ordered for fish salt and pepper and some soup for starter. both were good...the fish was juicy inside and crispy outside which i like.
for main course we went for mixed cantonese noodles , chicken fried rice , tsing hoi chicken and fish in chilli mustrd sauce. again the fish was really well done. the chicken dish and noodles were okay - though the chicken was a bit more sour than i had expected. fried rice was bland but did not taste bad though. overall we liked the food.

for all these orders the price came 1300ish with taxes - which i think value for money as compared to other places in salt lake (no corporate or other discounts offered in this place - still it does not pinch the pocket)

Have been finding some mixed reviews on Zomato as well as in foodie circles about this one. So, walked in on a Sunday evening for dinner with mixed expectations. As per my objective rating system, let us say we walk in with an assumed rating of 3 and score up or down on parameters - Location and Ambience, Menu Spread, Taste and Quality, Service, Value for Money.



Location and Ambience

The place is located near the Salt Lake swimming pool, one of the hotspots of Salt Lake, but not in the league of City Centre. Ample paid parking available. The interiors are nicely done in an Oriental themed style but the seating is bit cramped and not much privacy for the diners. You can actually overhear everything your neighbours are discussing without even wanting to. This adds to the noise level when the place is full. So a 0.25 added for location and another 025 added for interiors. 



Menu Spread and Availability

Lot of options on paper and apparently everything was available. I am using phrases like "on paper" and "apparently everything" with a reason which I hope will be clear to you as you read rest of the review. Anyway a plus 0.5 for the menu as it presented good variety.



Taste and Quality

We ordered Golden Fried prawn (suggested by the waiter), Shrimp rice noodles, Chicken fried rice and Lamb in Oyster sauce. The first thing that struck me was the speed of service. Being a Sunday there was "waiting" and the service time seemed to be aimed to minimize this. The food was being served in less than five minutes from order - I didn‚Äôt think it was sufficient to actually cook the items as per order and the results were as expected. There was no distinctive taste for any of the dishes. The starters were stir fired in a sauce that seemed strikingly similar to the gravy of the lamb dish. The rice and noodles were bland. Readers may now appreciate the reason why I framed the menu review above in the way I did - it just seemed that you would get the same thing no matter what you ordered.



Quality was poor - the shrimps in the the rice noodles were microscopic but what was worse was that the Lamb was stinking. Leave alone "fresh", this was definitely stale. I could not recall a similar experience in recent years. The Taste and Quality deserves a BIG MINUS 1 and that is what I give it.



Service

The queue management was not efficient - the designated person was not able to forecast the waiting time properly and quite a few guests complained about the transparency though I think it was more to do with the inefficiency of the captain rather than any intentional manipulations.



At the table, servers were polite but ill-informed. My wife is allergic to eggs and I informed the same at the time of placing the order. Accordingly, we had to discard quite a few starter options as these would be "batter- fried" and the batter is not eggless. I also mentioned that I want a crisp starter and not a stir fired one. Accordingly I was recommended the Golden Fried Prawn but when it arrived it was stir- fried in a black sauce and the prawns were anyway batter-fried as well - so much for recommendations.  Also, catching the attention of your server is bit of a task. A Minus 0.5 for the service.



VFM

The value for money would have been good if the food had been near to decent. The bill for our above order came to around Rs.1100 which is reasonable. I would have added 0.5 for VFM but the quality does not justify the same. Hence no points here.



The total score comes to 2.5 (assumed rating of 3 + 0.5 +0.5 -1 - 0.5) which is okay as per my subjective rating as well.

One of those restaurants in Calcutta, a chain actually as I get to see they've opened up multiple outlets that has an authentic Chinese ambience along with the food they serve. I was so impressed with this place that I ended up visiting two times in the same week. They have a good offering in the menu covering chicken, fish, pork etc. (I'm not a fan of pork) and the price is a bargain for the food, service and the ambience. Yes, you get to have chopsticks too instead of the usual cutlery. From outside the place might look really small but it has a huge covered area inside.

Decor and food is excellent and so is the service. However the restaurant is a bit crampy but let that not be a reason for not going there. Didn't try much in my first visit so can't say about the speciality. Anyways go pay a visit and you wont regret it.

So I went to CHOWMAN over the weekend with my family of four.. The gate is flanked by a couple of lions and there's a watchman to open the gate for you...Very reminiscent of the Park Street Chinese eateries. 

The decor is done in muted dark grey, black and golden brown tones...with splashes of red! Very elegant and vibrant. There is ample seating for a large number of people...and comfortable seating at that‚Ä¶with couches available for those who prefer it. The straight back chairs are surprisingly comfortable and light‚Ä¶so no more pulling with all your might to get out of your place! I cant find fault with the decor. It is comparable with Mainland China.
The menu is wide and lots to choose from‚Ä¶fish, chicken, crabs, pork and lamb‚Ä¶and a lot of veggie options as well. The pricing is the BRIGHTEST SPOT here considering it‚Äôs a Salt Lake eatery. A good thing about this place is they provide chopsticks without your asking..yay!¬†

For starters we order for fish with salt and pepper, 10 pieces for Rs 215. Great Value for money‚Ä¶ The pieces were crispy, adequately flavored and delicate tidbits. Good start! 
For the main course we ordered, chicken and egg fried rice and mixed pan fried noodles with lots of veggies and black gravy‚Ä¶and the side dish was a unique Chicken in Chill wine sauce and a Fish in Black bean Sauce.. All I can is YUM. The noodles were very well cooked, most probably in olive oil which is what gave it unique bordering on a sweetish flavor‚Ä¶not unpleasant but takes a bit to get used to. The portion of veggies were generous but the meat and/or fish was not up to the mark. Rice was adequately flavored and good in quantity‚Ä¶nothing to write home about. The Chicken in Chili wine sauce was sweetish sour in flavor (more sweet than sour, but definitely the sour kick of a white wine was in there)‚Ä¶The sauce is white in color and there were nice bits and bobs of red and yellow peppers‚Ä¶the chicken was shredded in style. The Fish was the Highpoint of my evening‚Ä¶a delight with its depth of flavors and slight kick of heat at the back‚Ä¶the pieces of fish were succulent and just rightly done. There were delightful pieces of the black bean in the gravy which as logic dictates is dark in color. There was a bit of texture to the gravy which I enjoyed as well. The side dishes were served in pretty boat shaped dishes which I liked. 
We also ordered some colas and FLS‚Ä¶Rs. 45 and Rs. 50 each respectively so very well done there CHOWMAN by not overreaching on the Est. Charges. 
Now coming to the not so good points, the waiters were not very attentive and we had to call several times for our drinks which should have reached our tables at 10 mins tops but took half an hour. The service of starters was slow, half an hour but the main course reached our table before the last of us had even finished the starter. Oh well never mind! My suggestion would be to order drinks and starters/ soup and order the main course later. 

No liquor license yet so no tipple folks! 
The bill amounted to Rs. 1390 ish.. And tips took some more. I‚Äôll be going back for more and would definitely be recommending it to people wanting some good Chinese food in SL.

Ever since this place has opened.. its among the wishlists of all the chinese food lovers! It has a very big advantage of its location. A very prime location of saltlake - swimming pool.
Me with my brother and sister planned to go for a dinner out there and truly speaking I was excited.
As we reached there, I liked the entrance gate and the watchman opened the gate for me with a warm greeting.
As I entered the manager there came up to help me and got the place where my sister was already sitting..
The table was clean and properly set.
I liked the interiors - dim and everything was in a combination of black and red. It gives it a chinese restaurant ambiance.
The menu was elaborate (good for non veggies) but as my sister doesn't like non veg we stuck to ordering veg food.
We ordered for manchow soup and shezwan chilli baby corn.
The soup was a little tasteless, lacked some spices - so I had to add some salt pepper and little vinegar which brought it in an edible state. The fried noodles were not so crispy, still it didn't bother me much..
The baby corn was nicely cooked and had a smoked taste, which made a perfect blend with the spices.
Then for the main course we ordered for chilly garlic noodles and veg manchurian
I wanted to have phad thai.. but in the menu it was written it would be having rice noodles and there was jhad thai which would be having flat noodles.
But as far as I know, phad thai is made with flat noodles. So I dint think much and called the steward, I asked first what is veg sui mai, he first of all didn't know what's that? He felt out of the world. Then the other Steward told me that its not available. Then I asked him do u have phad thai? He said sorry flat noodles are not available too. This pissed me but I then I ordered for steamed rice and thai green curry.
The order preparation timing was pretty fine with so many tables running that time on a weekday.
The noodles tasted good with both chillies and garlic in perfect amount but the manchurians were not so great and didnt please me much.
Then the green curry and steam rice was mind blowing. The presentation was not so great but the taste SUPERB! I had told him to put more of broccoli and he paid heed to it. The taste was really close to what you get originally in Thailand.
We also ordered fresh lime soda which also left me with no complaints.
After the content thai food, they asked me if I wanted to order for some desserts and I also wanted to order for darsans but I didn't want the green curry taste to go from my taste buds and was too full to have those.
Next time gonna order for that surely.
Finally before giving the bill they brought us a box with mouth freshners. I liked the box too much.

So as a conclusion - please train your staff with what's there in the menu, coz this holds a big importance.
All in all it was a good experience, will surely visit again to try non veg and I hope I get phad thai next time.
Good place to be. Recommended by me!

Few days back, i got to know from here only that chowman has set up a branch in saltlake, swiming pool area. so, the next to next day we had a office party and i decided to bring the food from here. 

we ordered bar be que chicken, chicken schezwan  noodles, chicken / shrimp fried rice, hong kong chicken, chili wine fish, fish manchurian and schezwan orange roasted lamb. all of the items were superb and everyone in my team were totally overwhelmed. i liked the chilli wine fish and lamb prepartion most, but the remaining items were also equally tasty. i have visited the ballygung branch multiple times and i would must say that they have maintained their consistensy in quality. 

one point i should mention separately that we have ordered 22 dishes of the above combinations and they have delivered the food in sec v with 35-40 mins, really super fast. their packaging was also very good. the food was quite hot while having after 20-25 mins more. so, as a whole i can positively recommend this place to taste quality chinese food in quite reasonable price. even i am planning to go there within next week...

Chowman is in my wishlist for quite a long time. The interior is truly nice, the decor the music everything has Chinese touch. We ordered roasted chilli pork which was  quickly served n tasted very good. For main course we opted for mandarin fish (suggested by them) and veg sanghai rice. After making us wait for quite a long time they finally served it. Though The rice was full of mushroom and babycorn it didnt taste anything special. It was a real average one. But the fish looked really good, it had red gravy(the quantity of gravy is very less) with shredded chicken. It was really awesome. The fish was crispy from outside bt was really soft at inside. The bill was 669/- only. 
So it was a good lunch. Hope to go there again :)

My first visit to this restaurant was delightful. The first thing that you will notice is the beautiful decor of the place. It creates an impression. Now coming to the food...crispy schezwan baby corn is ¬†okay types....not very tasty. You can try something else instead. Food was very good...specially the Hong Kong Fish and the capsicum burnt ginger garlic rice. The meifoon was well cooked too. The dessert too needs a mention- darsan with vanilla ice cream is a good try. Serving and timings are also good. Overall this place will steal your hearts.

Cons:- Management can still be a bit better.

Long ago i visited the Ballygunge outlet ..... which was quite less in space inside as u know ....... but liked the food though ...... and after getting news of this outlet, being much nearer to my home , i paid it a visit a couple of weeks back .......
The first thing u notice entering inside ,is the great ambience ...... overall environment a bit dark but sufficient light just to light up your table (which i liked)...along with some chinese music playing in the background .......its quite spacious inside for a change ....... :) 
Coming to food ...... quality is standard ...just like they have it in their main outlet in the South ...... We ordered Double Fried Lamb ....... Barbeque Chicken ....... Kung Pao Chicken ..... Khao Phat Thai Fried Rice ..... Chinese Mixed Fried Rice .......¬† Barbeque chicken and kung pao chicken was good ........ Khao Phat Thai rice was an experiment again ......being red and spicy ..... i had once tried that in Tandoor Park (jadabpur) before .....thought maybe here it might suit my palate ..... but neither i liked it then ,nor did i like it here :( ........¬† i liked the chinese mixed fried rice though ........ Double fried lamb had excessive salt in it ....i am not sure if thats the way this particular dish is actually made or if it was a mistake for that day only ....... either ways i ain't trying out this item again ......
Prices are standard i would say (considering its location and the name/popularity it has already acquired in the south) or maybe slightly on the higher side ......
Overall , u might not find anything special in here in terms of food items ..... but for standard good quality chinese food at a standard rate(not very high not very low) , this is surely one of the¬† better restuarants in the city .......

Well, this place will give you the feel of Chinese environment, as the interior of this place was decorated with Chinese lanterns and¬† the typically Chinese music was playing in the background. The food was good and the quantity was quite enough for normal human beings. We ordered chicken sweet corn soup, thai soup, chilli garlic pepper chicken and schezwan fish as our starters.¬† Schezwan fish¬† was tasty and the chilli garlic pepper chicken was crispy and spicy. In the main course, we ordered chicken fried rice (Chowman spl), garlic chicken and schezwan prawn. The quantity of one plate fired rice was enough for two people. And it had a lot number of chicken pieces. Schezwan prawn was tasty, however the garlic chicken was not so good.¬† Staffs were really good and well-mannered. They always wanted to know the taste of the food. This place is a bit costly. For some special occasions you can try but for regular visits you need to rethink.

Had a disappointing experience here, over all. Went once only but don't feel like going back any more. 
First of all, went without a reservation and had to wait 40 mins to get a seat. We literally walked back home, sat awhile and returned, it took that long. 
Secondly, the food was average. The starters were good, the dragon chicken a bit too spicy and hot. But the main course was pretty horrible. The schezwan noodles were not up to the mark. And the prawns were pretty undercooked. The garlic chicken had so much garlic, it tasted of nothing else. Not even chicken. 
All in all, a bad experience.

Since, I had heard a lot about chowman, I decided to visit the place..the interiors are good..I visited the place on Sunday so it was full and had to wait for 10 minutes to get a seat..

The service provided by both the managers and waiters was good and prompt..food was served very quickly..all food that was served looked good and delicious..the food was luring customers towards itself..

We ordered Crispy noodle salad, crispy chilly baby corn, barbecue chicken, vegetable clear soup, veg manchurian and coriander burnt garlic rice..all the items were good..food was mild spicy as per our instructions..the barbecue chicken was average..the manchurian was average too..it was too hard and dry plus it lacked gravy..the coriander burnt garlic rice was too good..one must go to this place and try this for sure..

Overall the place was satisfactory

A very cosy and nicely set restaurant which compliments the type of cuisine that is served. It offers a wide variety of options for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. The food retains a lot of the authentic chinese flavour. The restaurant offers very prompt service and makes its guests comfortable. The pricing is such that it gives good value for the money spent. A definite must visit. Infact could become a repeated visit joint.

At Saltlake .. This is a small restaurant near Coffee Cafe Day. Parking is at the road. On Sunday evening the restaurant was full with some waiting. At first glance -  The waiters were not very friendly rather indifferent would be the right word. 
Compared to Golden Joy or any other restaurant in Tangra or Barbeque at park street  - the amount of food is served in lesser quantities (almost half) compared the cost. 

Steamed Wantons were served cold - not acceptable at all!  It was a dampener. The quality if noodles was different - not to my palate  

Apart from the fact that his is may be the only restaurant that serves Pork in the area- I did not find either the service or the food at par with restaurant serving Chinese Cuisine... May be today was a busy day for them ... Will try (not sure though) once again during a week day.

No doubt that the location gives it an advantage and hence the footfall at this place. A lot need a to improve at this place for example - the menus were not given to children, table was not laid properly , cleanliness was not upto mark!

After ordering for home delivery a couple of times, I decided to visit this place for a weekend dinner with family. So I checked the reviews on Zomato to check what people are saying. Once I stepped inside the restaurant, I was surprised to see the lovely d√©cor. Attention has been paid to every detail of the place to give the visitors the feel of being in China. 
The service is equally impressive. The staff members seem to be ever ready to help you with your selection of dishes. The food though I had tasted earlier when I ordered for home delivery, seemed tastier in the ambiance. A great dinner is what we had. Will definitely come back.

Visited Chowman for the first time to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday and was so impressed by the restaurant. The interiors are so well done with Chinese d√©cor and motifs. The Chinese music that keeps playing in the restaurant will give you a feel that you have steeped into a restaurant in China. 
The food too is fantastic. Everything was just perfect. The taste, the flavors, the aroma, the freshness and the one thing that gets special mention-the price. So reasonable and compared to the generous quantity that they serve, it‚Äôs unbelievable. Wonderful experience.

In the mood for Chinese,we walked over to chowman for some. At around 1 o'clock the place was empty and we were probably the first people in there. We went through the menu and ordered the following - roast chilli pork, burnt garlic fried rice and broccoli and baby corn in chili garlic sauce. The roast pork came in quickly and it was soft, mostly lean meat coated in a soy sauce based baste which was what I was looking for. Our main course took some time to come. But the fried rice was light and simple and the vegetables were perfectly cooked and retained their crunch while not being too raw. Our bill was around 600/- and worth every cent.

Got a good response from the front desk manager - extremely courteous and helpful in giving me the order in close to 25 minutes as I need to travel back to Howrah. I miss the ambiance though and to get a photo in front of the  golden Buddha fresco.
Food was awesome tried KungPao Chicken and Chicken Sweet and Sour with Mixed Rice.
Looking forward to go and dine inn some day with family

fantastic. the menu, the ambience, the food, especially szechwan flavored roasted lamb in orange. were too busy to take pics. kudos to the chef/restaurateur. in fact, it is a bit of nostalgia also. it reminds me of my friend's joint, China Haus in Tangra. wonderful. a word of advise though. the serving crew needs to be a bit more training. otherwise, what they lacked in up market preppy attitude, they more than compensated with their helpful, pleasant a ready service. well done.

I had ordered yhe side dish to be less spicy specifically over phone. Unfortunately the exotic vegetable dish was so so so sooooo spicy that even I, who loves spicy food was taken for a big time shock! Big time dissappointment! Had heard such good reviews about Chowman and such a big let down!

Great great great place, one of those few times when i actually rate 5,this place is the best if you have a tight budget but u still want to enjoy your lunch or dinner
The place maybe not too big, but the Decor, ahaaa its marvelous,the food was mouth watering, n the quality was awesomee,its really hard to find a resturant this good which is also pocket friendly.
PRICING----
It will cost around 650for 2including taxes which includes Starter,main course n side dish one of each
P. S - Do note the pricing on zomato is old, as the new menu shows an additional 10-15rs for almost every items on the list..

AMBIENCE----
I really like those Chillout Chinese tracks which they play, which calms down your brain n will really help to feel n enjoy the ambience along with the food
The place is a bit dark which mix perfectly with those Chillout tracks

HOSPITALITY----
Now comes the hospitality, they have excelled in this part,no matter how much the place is crowded, they will keep an eye on everything,you dont have to call them to serve you,as soon as your plate gets empty they will come on their own to serve
and i think they have a tradition to give a pair of chopsticks as a gift, i was with my girlfriend and she got one,and they had a great built quality.. 

CONCLUSION----
Great food, well behaved staffs, great ambience n pocket friendly, what more do we need for a perfect date with our loved ones on a special day
Everyone should have a shot at this place, i can bet you wont be disappointed..
I was really not sure about this place before, specially after the experience which i had at the branch in Golfgreen which was worst, that branch had the worst manager in the history of restaurants..

SUGGESTION TO THE OWNER----
Should update the new menu list on zomato.
And nothing more, this place is perfect
cant wait for next visit

As it was my first pork (in ma lyf) ..i really loved it,,The roasted chili pork.But a slight overfried..
Main course the sanghai chicken chowmein was good but i loved the chicken preparation.it had a tooth breaking name.(Cant remenber)
Coming to the envrionmnt,,ambience is excellent . as soon as we got dere it reminded me of the KUNG_FU_PANDA music.A soothing music was played at the background...its relly refreshing from the old dinkchak hindi songs.
Waiter reponse was very decent.

For excellent Chinese taste by home delivery. 
Order Chowman. ( if you are not living in salt lake drive up It's worth the effort)
The menu looks pricy but a single dish is served for two people minimum.
Small quantity eaters carefull 
Especially if you are ordering for the senior members of your house.
Pork and Lamb lovers will keep coming back for more.

I have both been to the place and had a take away done.
So, being there inside places you along a few places where chopsticks are placed for you. A nice try to get you in mood for Chinese. The food is nice, and I particularly liked the pepper garlic chicken. 
Take away was wonderful as the make time was really less. Overall they could do with a little less salt.

Good for some of the best oriental starters in the city .  The main course needs to be worked on , especially on the stir fry stuff which seems to be bit too oily .

I was pretty apprehensive about this place in the beginning, because seldom do you find good Chinese restaurants in Salt Lake. An intense Chinese craving took me to this place and bingo I had found one of the best Chinese eateries. The ambience is excellent and the decor is quite oriental.  Hardly restaurants take up so much effort to create an ambience corresponding to its cuisine. Coming to the food, it was an early dinner and the place was already quite full. Since I was having major hunger pangs, we directly ordered the main course, the rice noodles was perfect and the chicken in oyster sauce was above average. Though their drinks were a bit of a disappointment though, it was too watery and the fresh lime wasn't cold. Their service is also upto the mark. Overall this place is a must visit for all Chinese food lovers, I'm sure you will not be disappointed!

After seeing so many reviews in Zomato about this place i decided to give it a try...and i must say that i regret not going to Chowman earlier... however better late than never... Lovely food served by lovely people and in such a lovely ambiance and all this is without burning a hole in your pocket. Chowman is now my only destination for authentic chinese food

My first visit to this place and i am already a fan of Chowman... Their kung pao chicken and roasted chilli pork is mind blowing... Quality and Quality-both are exceptional given the reasonable pricing of the place. they very well live up to their moto 5 star food at 1 star cost

I live close by to this restaurant and order in their food quite often! The good thing about this place is that their quality never disappoints you! Every Sunday if I am not going anywhere else to eat we order from Chowman! The pan fried mono is a delight to eat and my grandpa and mom just love it!

Chowman salt lake recently opened its gates to food lovers, offering authentic chinese food. To start with, the ambience is wonderful, with chinese tunes playing in the background. The staff courtesy is commendable and the food is authentic and reasonably priced! This is a really nice fooding experience if you have the buds for chinese! :)

I have only ordered home delivery from chowman but i've always enjoyed their food. Their green curry is fabulous and their portions are fairly large. Prices are slightly more expensive compared to blue poppy or wok anthems in salt lake.

I came to know about this place through Zomato so thaaaank you once again...
The place is near from my house and serves great food.Last week I visited this place and it was crowded.They keep us waiting for 45mins to provide a table.Finally we orderd the food.
We orderd Chowman special soup,chicken wontons with honey,pan fried noodles and honey chicken.
Seriously food was out of the world and worth waiting 45mins.
I really liked the honey chicken and the pan fried noodles.
The dacor of this place was like a buddhist monustry.I loved the giant bell and painting near the front door.
Really great experience .... Reservation recommended...

I am writing this review with a heavy heart. And that is because my rating has dipped for Chowman Salt lake branch compared to their oldest branch at Golf green. I am very sure with my conclusion, as before writing this review I have had food for at least 3 times in the Salt lake branch. The recipes are the same, the look remains the same, the quality remains the same, but the taste is one grade below the original. Eyes can be fooled, but not the taste buds. They do like the taste but end up craving for somewhere like 10% more.
As an experiment I had almost the same set of dishes in both these branches at a quick succession (around a week). The results were exactly what I feared. Again, I am not saying that it is bad food, but anything less than excellent from this restaurant is not acceptable. Their rise has been phenomenal in the last couple of years. it has been so close to my heart, that a slight deterioration in performance is unacceptable to me.

My third visit to Chowman and I just couldn‚Äôt stop myself from sharing my experience there any longer. It is the only restaurant in Kolkata that serves the best Chinese. I still have to try a few items in the menu but the ones that I already have are just delicious. The quality of food that they serve- be it the chicken or fish or prawn is so good and is always fresh. Really impressive!

This was my second visit to this place on the occasion of my birthday. Earlier we had been there to celebrate my son's birthday. It was a weekday but there were good number of people at the restaurant when we arrived. The ambience resembles Chinese culture for example there is a laughing Buddha at the entrance...a big black bell with engravings on it...,the walls, the dominance of red and black colour and everything else about the decor. The lighting is just perfect for a cosy ambience.  The sitting area is however very small. There is only one place where 10-15 people can sit together. Other places can seat a max of 4-6. We were 8 adults and 2 kids and we had to wait a good 35 mins because sitting area for 10 people together was not available as the other big area about which I spoke before was already occupied. They do not take pre bookings either as I had earlier called to book the table. 

Coming to food....it was just too good. We had ordered sweet corn soup for the kids. For starters we ordered Fish Pepper Salt which was just awesome and we indeed relished. For the main course we had Mixed Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken and Hot Garlic Chicken. The mixed fried rice was white....just the way I like it....and I don't like normal mixed fried rices coloured. 2 Portionz of rice can serve 3 people well. The curries also had good number of pieces...around 10-12 counts. For the price per dish it was generous servings and good quality food.

In a place around Salt Lake, there are hardly good Chinese eateries at affordable prices. I definitely recommend anyone to drop in to taste some real good food but make sure if you are 8-10 people...you keep wait time in hand even of it is weekday dinner.

We ordered a home delivery on 21.06.14. I wish we hadn't. We ordered the food at 8-30 pm which was to be delivered in 45min.However,we received the food at 10-15pm.We ordered veg and egg fried rice,hakka noodles, veg manchurian, chilly paneer, mushroom and corn in hot garlic sauce. Now, when we received the order we did not find mushroom and corn item, so we called them, their person came running with PRAWN IN HOT GARLIC, when we again complained they send us mushroom pepper which was dry and not a gravy item we wanted. 
Now, comes the food quality, trust me, it was too bad even my dog would refuse to eat. It was stale, smelly, just boiled without any taste., the same goes out to each and every item. We a group of 9 people just had a bite each and the rest of the Rs. 2100 dinner was thrown into the bin. Even that single bite was enough to upset stomach of 3 people. 
When we complained to the restaurant, they said that the regular cook was absent so a standby cook made the food leading to such pro lem, next time it will be ok.
 C'mon!! What the heck of an excuse was that! 

I am never ever eating at Chowman. Worst food, worst service.

CHOWMAN...for a long  tym  it was on the wishlist...but now i "marked it as been there"...nd thanks to my friend's birthday treat for this...as we entered, the ambiance soothed my mind...the overall china feeling was there!
now coming to the food part...for starters we ordered CHOWMAN'S favourite soup and a other chicken soup,a mushroom dish and also a plate of chicken lollypop. Both the soups were served hot and really good in taste and the lollypops and mushrooms were also as expected. Then for the main course we ordered cantonese gravy noodles,konjee crispy lamb,chicken in chilli wine,fried rice and a veg dish... from all of these i liked lamb dish the most...the noodles were also very delicious. the veg dishes dissapointed us a li'l bit...bt the all over experience was good.
it's one of the best chinese restaurants in the town...nd quite pocket friendly...hoping to go there once again!

Tried this place today with a close buddy of mine. Nice inviting and warm ambience with an oriental theme to it. Courteous staff and quick service. No hesitation in rating this place as the best Chinese eatery in and around the salt lake area. The crab soup was nice ,albeit spicy they go their flavours absolutely nice. One of the better versions of the golden fried prawns I have had , the batter touches perfection. Very well made Mein Foon with the right quantity of meat and vegetables. The same goes for their Mixed Fried Rice. We also ordered for a Roasted Pork in Chilli Wine sauce which was very well made and so was the Honk Kong style Fish.  More than Worth the price charged. Their steamed Wantons although need improvement in both taste and quality. Overall a recommended place.

Chowman being a favourite place, I (along with my family) were there y'day night (Sunday! Again!). It is as cosy as it was mid last year! This is probably the 4th or 5 visit in last 7 -8 months.
The food quality has gone to a little basic. Chicken preparations are not that mouth-watering. Chowman team should focus back to the taste of the food for which they are so famous.

But overall, still a fantastic place to spend the evening with friends & family for a decent dinner. Still one of my favourites.

22-June-2014: Just been there this evening. We ordered soups, starters and main course. The menu prices given in Zomato is probably the older one (as on 22nd June 2014), but prices are very reasonable.  Today being Sunday,  it took a little longer to serve,  but well worth the wait.  
Lemon Coriander thick (Chicken) soup was great.  So was the Lemon pepper chicken clear soup. As a starter,  pepper garlic chicken was very tasty. 
Mixed fried rice was good and teasty as well.
Ambience was just great, but do not expect a quiet place as the too many people were there on Sunday evening. 
Total bill value was around 1500.00 for 3 adults, but money well spent. 
Definitely suggest this place for families and couples.

A place for authentic Chinese cuisines that doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. The soothing, oriental decor and delectable food certainly creates a pleasing experience. Pan Fried Chilli Fish and Tai Chin Chicken deserves special mention. In short,this place doesn't disappoint.

Chowan is located in salt lake BF block .
When you enter the place you'll find the place to be calm and quiet.
The walls are decorated with wallpapers of buddha.
And the place dimly lit.
The service is really great.
We had egg fried rice , hong kong chicken , one fish preparation from the starters ,gravy chicken chowmein and teriyaki chicken.
Teriyaki chicken was dry awesome .
They even provided us chopsticks.
The food were delicious and in the end we had ice cream .
Vanilla ice cream with roasted chocolate walnut.
And the spoons were heart shaped.
The ice cream was delicious too.
The price was reasonable .
A great experience .

Chowman. I was skeptical from the beginning how my taste buds would respond to oriental cuisine other than Mainland China or Chung Wah. But I was surprisingly happy that Chowman makes it's food TASTY, TANGY, SPICY, LIGHT & INEXPENSIVE. I paid a visit to have lunch with a colleague. Ordered Chowman's Favourite Soup, Chilli Garlic Noodles and Roasted Pork in Chilli Garlic Sauce (surely I'm a Chiili Garlic fan...!). 
The food was great, service was spontaneous, ambiance was elaborate. What else would you need in a mid budget restaurant? Moreover, cloakroom was spik-n-span, dry & scented. 
So, was it all fairy tale for this joint? Well... no. The only hitch I found was the temperature of the joint was on a warmer side. Big deal...!!!
Go, have fun in Chowman. 
RECOMMENDATION: YES SURE

My first visit to chowman has ensured that I will be coming back a second time. Considering I don't live too far away its surprising that it took me this long to pop a visit.
The first thing you appreciate about chowman - the salt lake branch - is the decor and the interior design. Wonderfully wallpapered rooms, hard wood tables and chairs, wooden mats. There are three rooms, one leading to another, which gives the restaurant an air of privacy. The cosy dim lighting helps as well. 
Moving on to the food: each dish that we ordered was perfectly presented and tasteful. 

For starters we ordered chowmans special soup - thick, heavy and teeming with bits of brocolli, prawn and chicken- along with a fried preparation of chicken and spices  - lat mai kai. The main course consisted of gravy chow mein ( a dish whose exact name I can't recall) which was not my favourite considering how oily it was, and the fact that I could distinctly taste mustard oil even through the gravy ( a personal opinion considering most of the other people with me couldn't. ) accompanied by a fried fish preparation that was good enough. The last dish was plain boiled rice along with chicken in green curry - my personal favourite. The dessert menu had several options as well, with the darsons and vanilla ice cream competing with the date pancakes and ice cream on my to-eat list. 

The menu was extensive enough with both Chinese and Thai dishes on the lists. The meats offered - including lamb and crab preparations will definitely bring me back a second time for a taste. The ambience is good, the staff friendly and helping, the prices not too high. If you still havent- you should definitely give it a try.

I've had this place on speed dial ever since they opened. They've replaced my pizza order-ins with their yummy Oriental menu. The crispy honey fried wantons are sublime and perfect. So are the Sui Mai and Konjee Crispy Lamb. I'm a Mein Foon person. I usually get one or more of Chicken Teriyaki, Tai Chin Chicken, Lamb in Hunan Sauce, Schezwan Orange Roasted Pork. Mightily pleased with their standards. Haven't had a bad experience till date. Highly recommended for dine-ins and take-outs alike.

Well, the look and the whole set up is just amazing, with two dragons porched outside the restaurant , it is very impressive at first look.As you enter, you seem to be walking in a ancient oriental China, the music that plays all day long is another very appealing thought the owner has put in.
Now, let me come to the food, I ordered very simple food to check on their food quality because if you can get these basic things right you can any food right, let me tell you here I work as a  Trainee Chef at JW Marriots, Dry Chilli fish, Chowman special Rice and Honey chicken. The fish was very good indeed , but the rice was very spicy and not very appealing to the taste bud, and finally honey chicken, simply a disaster. The chicken was not hard to bite, the brown gravy made of honey, was just too sweet.Then, I ordered a simple Chicken Fried rice., it was very very much ordinary nothing out of the world.Over all its chinese but not very authentic.

Well first of all.. a big thank you to the owner(s) for opening a branch in Salt Lake which has been devoid of good chinese restaurants for decades now. Well unless you count Haka and Red Express in Sec V which are pretty decent too.. but for something as reasonably priced and qualitative as Chowman, it is a boon. Their menu is huge!. We tried Crispy Honey Fried Wantons which went really well with the spicy red chilli sauce. For mains, we took Fried Lemon Pork, a Thai Lamb preparation which was splendid, Meifoon and lastly some ice cream with pineapple for dessert. The food here is simple, balanced and reasonably priced. I was reading the usually ignored and overlooked owner's mission statement given on the first page of the menu card which expresses his endeavour "to serve 5 star quality food at one star prices" and impressively, I feel that he's pretty much there.

Not only does this place serve amazing food, but it goes very very easy on the pocket and gives you a great ambiance to enjoy it all.

Let me elaborate. We went there on a friend's b'day. The ambiance impressed us as soon as we got in with a dim lighting and wonderfully soothing temperature.

We ordered almost 3 varieties of non-veg in the hope of trying out new things. Crab, lamb and pork.

All the preparations were lovely. People who tried pork for the 1st time did not find it anything amazing, but still it was great none the less.

The lamb could have been boiled a bit more. But the preparation was great.

As for the crab, no words could explain its delicacy. Not only was the meat amazing, the preparation surpassed our expectations as well.

Coming to the quantity, its absolutely a standard quantity and 1 plate of rice or noodles along with 1 side dish is sufficient for 2 people with a normal appetite.


Overall If I am asked if I am ever going there again, I would respond with a loud YES.


Ohh and let me tell you, 3 soups, 3 noodles and 3 side dishes cost us only 2000. Its a huge value for money. People who usually do not prefer chinese food (Me being one of them) will also be bowled over by this resturant. I do not know whether this is the right thing to say, but it is Mainland China if not better at almost half or lesser the price.





I missed something in my original post. So the edit follows.

They give you chopsticks to get the authentic feel of Chinese. Although spoons are there, but still get a practise coz you cannot use the sticks for a swordfight. :D

We ordered the prawn meatball soup and the chicken momos they were lovely. The chowman special chowmein and the fish in oyster sauce was also nice. What was not nice was the lamb . It was overcooked and hard. Overall a nice place to visit for authentic chinese.

Visited Chowman yesterday for dinner with my cousin brother and sister and can I just say.....Wa-oh!! I am impressed to my very core....I,for one,was bored of the same Chinese food joints near my house and well,Chowman is an interesting change.The ambiance is just lovely...specially the low light and the distinctive Buddha. We had a rather lovely time. Ordering the roasted-chili pork as the only entree,we were worried if the pork would be rubbery and oh my,my,my it was anything but.The crab fried rice and the mixed pan fried noodles were falling in the main category.For the side accompaniments,we had chili wine fish and lamb in a subtle chili garlic sauce.I'd have to say that the lamb was a disastrous fail since it was overcooked and the sauce was too salty.For desert, instead of trying the monotonous Vanilla Ice Cream with Darsan...we decided to go old school. So,we just ordered Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and, how could that be a fail?The hero of the night was definitely the pork.The silence and good time were accompanied.In the end of every review,i would like to ask myself whether I would come back to that place or not, and this time my answer is...uh...YES!!!

Amazing food thought I had veg. Amazing ambiance without any doubt. Service was excellent and above all pocket friendly go for it. Though I was a bit late in trying this restaurant but I must say a nice place for Chinese lovers.

One of the new restaurants in Salt Lake, serving good Chinese food. We have visited this place a couple of times and we recommend the following items.

1. Thai Soup- This is little different from what we had at other restaurants across the city but this soup is pretty good.

2. Chilly Pork Dry- Portions of lean meat cooked in Oriental style. This may be treated as the signature dish for this restaurant.

3. Meifoon in any type tastes great here. Its little differently cooked and tastes good for a change. But its not authentic Meifoon

4. Chicken/ Lamb/ Pork cooked in Devil's sauce-

Its a red hot item that tastes nothing special. Devils Chicken is a favorite pick for me which didnt satisfy me here.

5. Cantonese Chicken-

It is indeed another signature dish of this restaurant. The dish has an X factor that appeals anyone. Its a must try.

6. Mixed Fried Rice-

Its plain and simple. No specific taste nut better than their Schezuan version as we tried earlier.

Pros-

1. Very good ambience and extremely well decorated interiors.
2. Service is really good.
3. Food tastes well and is a welcome change.

Cons-

1. Overpriced considering the quality n quantity.
2. Quantity is very less. A single plate of fried rice/ meifoon/ Chowmein doesnt even half fill two persons.

OVERALL VERDICT- Worth visiting.

Dear Food lovers !! 

I was going through all the fantastic reviews that have been written for this restaurant . And respecting all those reviews i decided to go to the salt lake outlet of Chowman. First thing that i really liked was reading the first page of the menu card which gives us a little bit of insight into the founder's vision. I'd also like to mention that this evening was a very very special one as this is the first time after a very long time that i went to dine with my whole family ! Well that just includes the four of is though ;) 

We ordered for the manchow soup, and some chowman special soup ! The manchow soup is usually my classic choice so it was good ! I would not comment on the special soup that my mother took because i never tasted it ! For starters we ordered for the fried honey chicken wanton, konjee cryspy chicken , prawns pepper salt and chicken steamed momos ! Over all they were great ! Really good quality stuff ! The momos were very well seasoned ! And i loved the wontons ! The flavour combination was very comfortable ! 
For mains we ordered for chicken fried rice , chicken noodles , mandarin fish and devil's chicken. I must make a special mention of the devil's chicken as it was out of the world !! Not too spicy, not too sweet. Just PERFECT!  Although we did not take desserts because we chose to have kulfi somewhere , so i don't have much idea about the same. However, i had a look at the menu . So it did not look like a very tempting menu for the sweet tooth. 

One thing i'd like to mention is that i was pretty close to give this place a total 5 on 5 ! But i was not really happy with the quality of service in this place. The service man who was taking our orders was very unpleasant and unwelcoming . Well he was not rude or anything but me being from the hotel industry itself , we are taught to be as warm and cheerful as we can no matter how much rush there is ! The management should buck up a little !! 

Other than that, its been a beautiful experience ! Thanks ! 
Happy Eating !

If I would give more than 1 it would be really injustice. I ordered for home delivery I wait for 10.45pm but order dint delivery even they don't think to contact the person  and said order would not be delivered due to some reason.me and my family wait till11pm and called them up that time due to power cut off kitchen is closed. How could they do this kind of behavior with customer. 
Only good food is not enough, customer retaintion and satisfaction is major part. I won't suggest to anyone to go further

Visited last Monday.It was really nice experience.
Decor:Decor was very nice.Chinese theme with a large budhha.Nice chinese music and wooden chopstick..Loved it.
Service:Service was good.Staffs were well behaved
Food:It is not a very costly restaurant.We gave order of Lat Mai kai and Double Fried Pork in starter.Pork was well cooked and delicious,but Lat Mai Kai was not as per expectation.In main course there were Mixed Chilli Garlic noddles(a bit spicy),Mixed Singapore noodles,Chilli Garlic Chicken in Red bell Pepper,Shredded Lamb in Chilli Garlic Sauce.
Noodles were very smooth and perfect and so the side dishes were.Lamb was soft and well cooked.
I am very happy with their service and foods.Will visit again.

To start with the interiors .. It has got a buddhist monastery appeal. I went there with my bf.. We had a lemon coriender soup and honey fried chiken wanton.. Both were really good.. Then for the main course we had the panfried noodle mixed. I felt it had a little more salt than usual. Nd with that we had hunan fish.. The fish was really soft and it tasted really great. The food was also reasonable.. Over all it was a good experience. :)

I had a sudden urge for Chinese food last Friday and on the recommendation of a friend I decided to try out the Salt Lake branch of Chowman with my husband. Before going, as is my habit, I checked out the user reviews for the place on Zomato and even decided on what I would order. Going by the high rating and good reviews, I had really high expectations but unfortunately I was not THAT impressed.
We reached the restaurant quite early in the evening and were promptly seated. The interiors were tastefully done but we could have done with a bit more lights. Had to call the waiter to place our order, who first came without a pen and paper; once I started ordering, he stopped me to get a paper pad :) In starters, we tried the Konji crispy lamb - the sauce was  quite tasty but the meat was very tough. In mains, we had ordered for crab meat fried rice and fish pok choy. The fish was light and good, but we could hardly find any crab meat in the rice :(
Overall it was a satisfactory experience. I might visit the place again to try out some of the other items on the menu and give it another chance.

Had a great time over here. Had Chicken Barbeque, Shanghai Noodles and Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce. Now I must say that each dish was special in its own way and the tastes were so unique. They all were outstanding. Hoping to visit this place again. The ambiance of the place is great. The serving time is also excellent. The decor of the place is beautiful.

Recently we wanted to order food in office for dinner and thought of having Chinese. We zeroed on Chowman and the result was really good. Though they take orders only till 10.30 PM, they send the food really quick. We ordered for Roasted Pork, Chilly garlic baby corn & mushroom along with Rice and Chilly chicken dry and Shredded chicken with garlic. We had real tough time in segregating the pork and shredded chicken and they did not help us by not marking the pork. Overall the food was good. The quantity served was wholesome and in the end it was always going to be extra for us.

In one line a nice place to dine. This was my first visit in this salt lake outlet n I am more than impressed. Firstly this is not a food joint to have only so called typical Chinise dishes (dishes revolving around chilli, ginger, n garlic), the menu varied enough to make this joint way above the ordinary ones. The ambience is quite serene n relaxing.

We ordered- mixed lung fung soup, deep fried crab claws, Chowman special noodles, fish pak choice. The soup was excellent with authentic lung fung texture. The crab was good but I wud suggest to cut it into smaller pieces and de-shell a bit more. Noodles was awesome with an unique red color. Fish pak choi was cooked into perfection.

Overall a place worthy to be revisited :)

P.S: To all the guys keep your eyes wide open to enjoy the beauty both in n out of the restaurant

I really loved this restaurant and ended up going there thrice. First of all the place is not that difficult to locate and secondly the decor is mention worthy. I really liked the way they arranged chopsticks on each table and though i liked the concept of dim light but my friends complained saying that it was too dark. The service is not too fast but again one cannot really complain because the food they serve makes up for that delay. I think the price is quite reasonable with respect to the quantity they serve ( i.e the quantity is good and 1 dish  can be shared among 3 people easily). In starters we ordered crispy konjee lamb and pan fried fish and i must say both were lip smacking and in main dish we tried moon fan fried rice, thai rice, chowman special rice/noodles, pan fried noodle. One thing which disappointed me was that in mixed rice the prawn they served was not cleaned properly and the black threads were prominently  visible. We also had chicken in hot garlic sauce, lamb in hunan sauce, lemon and honey fish. All of these were great but the fish preparation was awesome as it just melted in my mouth and i literally closed my eyes while having that ( i am not joking!!! ). Overall experience was good and will definitely go back to try their other items and am giving them 4 because of their mixed fried rice having prawn which were not clean.

This was long due. 
And I had forgotten Zomato listens to very honest opinions and make them heard too!

So first let's talk about the food. Its Salt Lake; devoid of any standard Oriental give-away or take away or chopsticks or relishes.  And we are the lazy denizens who have a finicky habit of ordering every now and then. The 'good food' fanatics have a sharp nose, ears, eyes and 'taste' for what substantially goes on in the gourmet corner. And I am one. 

Chowman opened a third home here. In my hometown. And their menu looked impressive, as it wasnt restricted to the general garlics, gingers, honeys and chillis chickens or fishes or prawns. It was a lot more than that. The Orient was just brewing its broth well enough. It was a ray of hope and so, I took to the laziness and ordered. 
Voila! There was the whammy. They are lousy. First thing that you should ensure about Chowman? Make sure the person who is taking your order is not a complete douche! They will assure you that you are selecting a delectable 'starter', while serving up a side dish that's definitely not the crispy starter you are looking for, but a very gravy addition to your Chowmein or Rice. The delivery boy would probably be all the more slack in doing anything efficiently (something as simple as carrying a change after being told to do so while placing the order!)

And, I should mention, I might have been way too unlucky to have faced such sluggishness and stupidity. Twice, that is!

Nevertheless, I am looking at the silver line! Them? potential indeed! You want bland Chinese, Spicy Chinese, Wok fried noodles and all that is good for the salivation and gustatory reflexes? This is gastronomically enticing in a way that it is diverse in what it can cook up! Try their starters, or side dish, it would probably not really disappoint you. 

Why 3.5? Because they need to girdle up their slacking loins maybe!
Why '3.5' still?
I was satisfied. With the food. 
Room for improvement: I would like a pleasant surprise next time!
 PS:- Oh yeah, they serve your delivery with chopsticks!!

being tempted by the reviews in zomato decided to head there one evening. a 5 mins walk from the baishakhi auto-stand, or you can take a rickshaw. its near the dominno's outlet there. the atmosphere is awesome, too soothing, it seemed like we have come to any chinese/nepali monastery. the decoration is very nice.
they have a huge variety of chinese food. so can see that from the menu posted here in zomato also. what i liked is that they even serve delicious crab preparations also. crab is one of my favourites. we ordered for a schezwan hakka prawn noodles (Rs. 150) and a chicken garlic chicken in red bell pepper (Rs. 195). the food is lip-smackingly good, trust me. i can still feel the taste of their spicy yumm noodles in my mouth. if you are in search of a true good chinese food then this is the place, this place is any day better than the big chinese-joint of park street. i just feel in love with the flavour of their noodles. they serve good amount of medium-sized prawns in their noodles. the chicken was a bit spicy and hot which i prefer as you can get to understand from the name of the dish itself. the amount they serve is also pretty good. its enough for 2 people to have in a dinner.
the staffs are good and well behaved, they served us a variety of mouth fresheners (which includes chloromint also) in a square wooden box with four squares in it. our total bill was around Rs. 460 with a mineral water including tax, vat.
do visit this restuarant once to quench your chinese taste-buds and i assure you won't repent. your search for good quality chinese food (other than in china town) will end here. the pricing is also moderate.
highly recommended, will definitely visit their again! :)

Firstly i never thought i will get a restaurant in salt lake with such a good ambiance. the total interior and the environment will give you a  feeling that yes you must have Chinese foods here only.
Now here comes the main part , the food ..... we ordered pan fried fish as starter which is really  awesome. The fish was soft quiet juicy and above all testy. Then as a main course we ordered chowman special fried rice, chicken noodles and hong kong chicken. Now after having the starter i expected a lot from the main course , so i was little bit disappointed. The rice was way too spicy which is not expected from a Chinese food, noodle and the chicken side dish moderately ok. You can give a second visit to the restaurant for the starters.

I have visited Chowman and taken so many home deliveries during get togethers not just from their Saltlake branch, but even from their Ballygunge and Tollygunge branches! I have also dined in at the Saltlake branch on a weekend. The quality of food is overwhelming and it never really disappointed me. However, very recently I had ordered home delivery where I found that one box of noodles was less than what was ordered. I had ordered 5, and there was 4! Since it was a get together, I did not bother counting the boxes in front of the delivery boy! When I discovered that a box of it was less, I called up the Saltlake branch to inform about the same. They said they would get back to me after enquiring. I don't know what the enquiry was about, no one really got back! No phone call ! Nothing! This is definitely dissapointing!

This place doesn't disappoints. It is one of those Chinese restaurants that does manage serve you authentic Chinese without burning a huge hole in your pocket. Ambience wise this place is great. Two Chinese lion statue rest at the doorway. Light is just right. 
The staff is very cordial and friendly. You actually rely on the waiter's choice of food. A must visit if you want to experience of authentic Chinese food without going to China Town. I would say it is at par with Mainland China at 1/3rd price.

The first time I've heard the name of Chowman was during the demise of Rituparna Ghosh as it was reported that his last supper was from this place. And then I came across the Saltlake Chowman joint while I was crossing the swimming pool area. It has almost 6 months gone since then, and at last today I've got the first opportunity to taste their food. Simply put, this is an awesome place with real delicious chinese food and excellent ambiance/decor. 
Ambiance - It is a quite spacious area which can sit a large crowd without even affecting the privacy of smaller groups. The wall decor begins the calmness you would see in yourself once you come out satisfied. The Buddha statue and the just-ample lighting reminds you of any Srilankan or Himalayan monastery.  
Food - We ordered Roasted Pork in starter with Lung Fung Soup. The soup was so absolutely balanced to my taste that it is the first time I did not apply any extra vinegar or salt/pepper.  The pork was little hard on the surface, and that has actually caused a quarter point cut. In the main course we ordered for Cantonese noodles (gravy chow min), burnt ginger fried rice with red and green pepper chicken. The gravy noodles was for my 4 years old son, and he enjoyed it. I found it perfectly bland in taste, the way it should be. The fried rice was very light and freshly prepared with very less oil, and was yelling the pleasant smell of the burnt gingers. I would certainly like to try this once more as the scent of the bowl is still on top of my nose. And the chicken was a little dry and was not probably a good side for the fried rice, but it tasted so soft and nice that I did not mind the dry part. Overall the food they served was absolute delicacy. 
Service - Last time I had a food, was in Chrome hotel and we had waited for 15/20 (on average) mins for every plate we ordered. In comparison to that, here the service was lightening fast. The soup and starter were served so fast that we could not even got ourselves settled on the table by then. Now as the pork was not very soft, I presumed it was made ready earlier and served after heating a little. This assumption has caused another quarter point loss for Chowman. 
However, given an opportunity I would certainly vists Chowman leaving all the famous Kolkata based chinese places including the giants in park street area. People were very courteous here and they were very careful about our need and were almost always available to serve us the next portion.
Value for Money - Probably the 2nd best part after the quality of the food. This certainly meets the goal of the founder as it is mentioned in the first page of menu card. They really serve great food at cheap price. All the items I mentioned above, did cost me Rs 920 (inc VAT & ST). Unbelieving huh ! But the menu put in Zomato seems to be older, as almost all the items are raised by Rs 20/25.
They have a Thai section, but as I am not a great fan of Thai food; I didn't taste that.

I was eager to visit Chowman, Saltlake since its inception and after my Chowman , Tollygunge visit, I decided to have a bite over there.¬† We visited the place on 30th April to have our dinner over there. 
When we entered into this joint, the first thing which attracted us was its beauty and soothing decoration inside. It was quite spacious enough to accommodate a large crowd.  We also noticed that they have a Thai section and we decided to try out Thai cuisine from there. We had Talumein Soup (Veg), Thai Style Fried Rice (Mixed), and Chicken in Red Curry. Before going into the details of each food, I like to mention this fact that we both were immensely satisfied in terms of quality and quantity. The Talumein Soup satisfied and tempted our taste buds from the very beginning. There were mushroom and noodles in the soup. The Thai Fried rice was well cooked and the Chicken in Red Curry was truly awesome and succulent. They used coconut milk and basil in Chicken Red Curry and I liked it. It was a nice experience to visit Chowman, Saltlake. The staffs were really cooperative and courteous. 
Our net amount was Rs.585/- (included VAT and Service tax).  A special thumbs up for Chowman for serving us such a nice food.

The salt lake, chowman joint opened up recently, just few days back. the quantity of food they serve is quite good. pricing very reasonable. and taste is not bad. its a typical Chinese restaurant and not a multi cuisine, so expect all kinds of Chinese delicacies. among meat they serve pork, lamb, chicken and also fish and shrimp. their home delivery service is quite good, and delivered hot. packaging is excellent and delivery is quick. the drums of heaven are good, in chicken in cashew nut and dry chilli is also a good preparation. I personally did not like the honey chicken. overall its quite a good restaurant and with a pretty good interior a ambience.

We had gone today. Myself, my wife and my sister.

The ambience was good. There was a Chinese music being in the background. Chopsticks were laid out neatly on bamboo mats. Water glasses clean.

We ordered Chicken Wings Fried, Shanghai Noodles, Thai Style Fried Rice and Honey Chicken.

The starter came after 10 minutes. It was good but not something to drool for. The next items were great. The lemon flavoured Fried rice was excellent, specially the aroma.

Overall a great experience. A must visit. Give this a try.

Second visit
Experience: horrible

First they came with noodles where as we placed order for rice. Then the chicken preparation they served had a hair in it. Next , the bill they gave had two plates of rice mentioned instead of the ordered number which was one. Finally after having the bill corrected, when i got my card out, they informed their card swapping machine was not working. 

This was my second visit. I wouldn't deny my experience was good the first time,the food was good too. But this later experience spoiled it all. I will probably never return to this place ever again.

Chowman! Heard so much about this place. So finally went there today. Won't say it was a bad experience but wasn't totally thrilled either. We ordered for some crispy chilly babycorn and crispy tofu in hongkong sauce. both starters were absolutely delicious! We then ordered a chilly garlic mixed rice in which the quantity of chicken was very less, it was more like a egg garlic rice. The chilly garlic veg noodles was again good and had a lot of flavor. But the side dish, prawns in oyster sauce was a total fail. the prawns were covered with a very thick batter and it was pretty hard. So it was like a mix of good and bad. The vegetarian dishes were indeed good but the prawns were a huge disappointment. 
I definitely liked the whole decor, the lighting and ambiance. I would go there again for sure and may be stick to ordering veg.

2017 review update
üò≥total disappointment, this outlet has gone.down in service and food quality. The menu is new, with bumped up prices but the food is no longer what it used to be.
Momos were bad, huge but not cooked well. Instead of charging 180 ageing the earlier 130, number of pieces could have been increased... But the momos have become big with thick cover and uncooked stuffing.


Dined at Chowman on the occasion of our anniversary. It was an awesome experience and can't wait to visit again.

The Budhha statue, the huge bell creates the WOW ambience complemented by the buddhist theme wall decorations. For a while we landed up in Sikkim..

The food is tasty and served real quick. The Talumein soup was brilliant. The starter barbeque chicken tasted different, a little salty but was tasty. Main course Prawn in black bean suace was very tasty - great presentation and the prawns were very inviting. The seafood fried rice was done very well. Pad thai was minus the flat noodles and turned out spicy for our liking, we packed it and had it later and relished it all the same yesterday.
Soup and the fried rice were the best of the lot that we ordered .

This is a new branch - opened in Feb 2014. Got their delivery menu also :)
The staff is very courteous and helping.
My daughter was gifted a chopsticks set along with the bill and condiments.

Overall great place, great food, great portions and VFM. Can't wait to visit again.

Thank you Chowman!

Last visit a few weeks back was pleasant as well. The fish items taste cool, would like to try more of them in our next visits.
We got the same table in the buddha "room". The soup - lemon corriander was just ok but the rest of the items compensated for that low :)

Yet another visit and the wow feeling stays! Thanks again Chowman :)

Went couple of weeks ago with an expectation of their south Kolkata reputation of establishments. Not only the aesthetic value is good, but food in taste and quality, quantity, service, pricing are appreciated. They had hit the bingo in this part of  the city.

They deliver on time and the quantity exactly matched what they guided over phone. I will soon visit their restaurant in saltlake.

I and my brother and mother had gone to dine at chowman tonight.... Firstly the moment you step in the ambiance was mesmerizing.... All the chinese environment is created around you in an instant..... And the fact that a sweet chinese instrumental plays at your ears and all those big bells wooden walls Buddha statues just makes the ambiance more life like and perfect ..... Now talking of staffs.... They were well behaved and polite too.... And lastly the food seriously took my mind off and put this restraunt straight into my wish list ..!! I completely loved the food.... The veggies were crunchy the prawn was tasty soups were clear and did not contain any extra cornflower.... And the starter was brilliant too...... I personally loved chowman a lot and am looking forward to dine there once again.... :)

I have been hearing all the good reviews of CHOWMAN from all my friends from years who stays is South Kolkata but as I stay in Salt Lake, could not visit the restaurant till they opened in salt Lake area. 1st time we ordered food and it was a home delivery at a friend's party and we all were quite impressed by the quality of the food. The chicken, fish, rice, noodles all were so perfect that we all were really happy that we have got a great place to go for in Salt Lake. So we again visited there (for the first time, before it was a home-delivery). First of all I was quite impressed by the interior and then the soup, starter, food --- everything else followed and fell into place. So automatically I LOVED the place. So finally on the eve of Poila Baisakh, we planned to visit the place for a dinner with family &Y then the tragic happened. 

on 15th April'14 we were their for a dinner with lots of excitement coz we have boasted about the place to our family. By the way, It was a planned family dinner. As it was Poila Baisakh, we had to wait for 1 long hour(even though my brother-in-law made a call last night to book and they said we don't need to wait as they have written our name). Anyways we had to wait. That was still oka as we could see the rush. And finally we got our place. So we ordered 1 soup and 3 starters. The soup came almost 30mins later but without the starters. When we were almost done with our soup, then 1 starter came and we were already pissed of by the service. We keep telling them repeatedly about the food but they were adamant. We waited for the 2nd one and in between they had a power cut and eventually they have declared that they cant serve anymore because of the power cut and their kitchen was not operating due to the incident.. We went with our family, there were my pregnant Sister-in-law, and aged MIL & FIL. We all were so pissed of by the incident that we could not thought of anything else at that point of time, later on we zeroed on a small food joint and went there.

My point is, how come someone open up a restaurant when you don't have a proper back-up and system to run the show. It was definitely not a normal day and the restaurant owner should have expected the huge crowd so keeping that in mind it was complete mess from your end. It was so disgusting that we decided not to visit the place again. It was 10 at night and with all 6 people we had to move to some other place for the rest of our dinner.

I would really like to visit this place again but now it has become a point first to ask about you arrangements and then to visit.

CHOWMAN .. It was not expected.

Have heard a lot about Chowman and at last we went to try it out with my spouse. To find it out is bit tricky for those who are not aware of Saltlake maze. Direction given in Zomato map is perfect.
From outside this looks a cute Chinese den but on entering I was taken away by the d√©cor and ambience. Nothing was overdone and everything is there as much required and at the right place.
Staffs are very courteous and just by looking at the group they can understand which corner to offer to the guests. 
We ordered Konjee Crispy Lamb and Pan Fried Chicken noodles. Food was there on the table within 10 mins or so. Starter took my breath away with its taste and texture. It was crunchy yet not too oily. Meat was succulent not rubbery. Noodle was fine but I found proportion of Chicken was less compared to the vegetables tossed on to it. Taste wise I can still feel it. Another observation was the waiters need to understand to serve starters first and then the main course. Taking away half point for this scope of improvement. Very much cost effective and bill amount was just INR 450.
Presentation is very good and even they serve varieties of mouth fresheners in a small wooden box. As a souvenir they presented my wife a pair of chopsticks.
In conclusion at last, yes at last my quest for quality Chinese food in town comes to an end!! Thanks to Mr. Debaditya Chaudhury for bringing Chowman among foodies like us. We will support you at this cause to give 5 star food quality at the price on 1 star. Hats off to the effort given by you in bringing Chinese sauces and spices all the way from China and Thailand to ensure authenticity of Chinese cuisine.

--------Update 26 April'14-------------------
We went to take away Cantonese Chicken Noodles. The kitchen goofed it up and got Cantonese Friend Rice. Had to wait 30 mins for the same to get correct order. People ordered after me got it prior to me due to this mess at kitchen. Taste was impressive and so was the parceling hence taking away only .5 mark and 4 out 5 as average rating out of two experiences.

I am very impressed with Chowman Salt Lake. I mean first of all it is a restaurant owners by a musician. If that is not reason enough, the food is. Three of us went there that evening and ordered Chicken Hakka Noodles, Schezwan Fried Rice, Chicken in Chilly & Wine and Fish Mandarin. Reach and every dish was wonderful.. The noodles bright memories of China town (although I'm atad biased about China Town). The chicken was true to it's moniker(and I love wine). The fish was the best dish. Soft juicy and fresh fruits fish in tasty sauce. The schezwan fried rice could have been a bit more spicy. 
The best part about the place was the service because in fifteen minutes our food was ready. I was impressed because the food was fresh.
The decor is just like other chowman eateries. The service and behavior of the staff is very good.
My brother's girlfriend was gifted a pair of chopsticks after her meal. :)

At last a proper Chinese restaurant in Salt Lake!! Thanks to my friend who treated us here!!!  The ambience created is serene and soothing. We ordered roasted pork which was delicious.  The Chowman special soup was also very authentically Chinese. I loved the fish item made of black beans. The gravy noodles and the fried rice we ordered also met our expectations from the place.  All in all a great place to dine out with family and friends.  The staff were very polite and gave us a great service.

I am always skeptical about trying new places when it comes to food, but after hearing a lot about this place from friends, I decided to give this place a try. And I must say that they impressed me a great deal. The moment I entered the restaurant, I felt as if I was visiting a place in China. The d√©cor, the music, the feel is so Chinese. Their staff members also deserve a special mention. They helped us with our selection of the food and also specifically asked about any food allergies (something which we do not get to see in any other restaurant in Kolkata). 
And now the food- The one word to describe the food was delicious. From the starters to the main course each item was so so delectable. Chowman is now my only choice when it comes to Chinese.

"Chowman" is quite a catchy name. I have been there recently and being a dietician I must say their food is "healthy". :)

I had basically went there to order for parcel but the ambience attracted me so much that I was longing to sit and eat there. 
I had ordered for Chicken Fried Rice, Hunan Fish & Kung Pao Chicken. The fried rice was tasty, fish was extremely yummy and the chicken was good (soy sauce was a bit more according to my taste which I personally didn't enjoy much). 

In total I loved eating from here. Food is less spicy and very yummy! All those who are health enthusiast and diet conscious, Chowman is a perfect place to eat.

Went to this new outlet of Chowman in Salt Lake and was mesmerized from the time i set foot. The interiors, the feel and the courteousness of the staff  is commendable. The food was equally great. We ordered roasted chilli pork and pan fried chilli fish for starters. For main course we has coriander burnt garlic rice with kung pao chicken. I must say Chowman left me craving for more. 
We relished every bit of the food! Keep up the great taste and service.

I had heard a lot about Chowman from my friends who stays in South Kolkata and so finally when I saw the new Chowman at Salt Lake I decided to visit for dinner. For the first few minutes I was just zapped to see the fantastic interiors and then the elaborate menu. We ordered for Kung Pao chicken, mixed noddles, crab claws and fried chilli pork. The food taste and the portions were just amazing. It is really one of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever visited in the last few years. My best wishes to Chowman and I will definitely recommend to all my friends and family members.

I keep hearing about Chowman. I wanted to give my first 2 dining experiences benefit of doubt but after the third I was resloved to give my rating. The chain markets itself brilliantly. Right from the fancy decor, interiors, furniture to the home delivery packaging, not bad, I say to myself only to realise that the price you pay for the food is more because of the extravagance surrounding it and not so much the food. The chicken hakka noodles and the chilli garlic noodles were overcooked and definitely not al dente (if I could use the phrase for chinese food) the roast chilli pork is dry and tough. Strangely all the food seems heated in a microwave prior to serving. Salt Lake is still devoid of a good chinese resturant and most of us still have to go to China Town to get a decent bite.

Recently been here with one of my friends. Both of us were vegetarians.
The decor is good and the lighting is nice.
We ordered momo, chinese chopsuey, chilli garlic noodles and paneer chilly. Bill came upto 700, which is decent.
Momos were okayish.. chopsuey was excellent. Chilli garlic noodles were great too. Very delicately done, without much spice. The biggest flop of the day was paneer chilly. It was horrible and sucked to the core. Paneer itself was not that good as it felt hard. Dono what was their style of prep, but as far as I could recollect, no one does paneer chilly in that way. One other guy was complaining about some starter as well. Need to improve A LOT on paneer starters. Otherwise its good.

I heard quite a lot about Chowman and the reviews were rave, so we decided to go there for a meal last evening. The service was quick and the ambience great....the servers are pleasant and well informed. 
We ordered a Lung Fung soup, Hakka Noodles, Steamed fish in Coriander Sauce (our servers recommendation), and Lamb in oyster sauce. Our specifics were that the food be absolutely non spicy and no seafood, and therefore the soup and mains were recommended by our server.
When we took a sip of our soup we realised that it was quite spicy, there were chunks of green chilli floating in the soup!  Our server was informed who told us that the rest of the food would be non spicy...(there was no offer to change the soup..). We somehow finished it with difficulty, though it was tasty. 
The mains arrives and the fish also had green chilli sprinkled on top which i removed prior to eating, I told the server that I would return it if it was spicy. My idea of steamed fish is that of chunks of fish in a light gravy, this was quite the contrary, the fish was coated either in flour or cornflour and then steamed on a bed of cabbage which resulted in a gloopy mess that refused to come off the cabbage. One mouthful of it felt like eating semi raw flour with bit of fish somewhere.....very gluggy and unpleasant. The lamb too seemed to be coated in cornflour but not fried till fully crisp and that too left a residue of cornflour in the mouth. The only saving grace was the hakka noodles. I ordered a toffee walnut ice cream as dessert which was tad overpriced since it was two scoops of vanilla ice cream with about 8 pieces of walnut on the top. 

I would give them the benefit of doubt, since it was a sunday and it was overcrowded, but still no excuse to send out raw gloopy dishes and ignoring the specific requests of the customer. Steamed fish a big big let down, Mainland China or Orient also execute the dish to perfection....I think the chef was trying to "dimsumize" the dish or something, overall it was disastrous! I may go there a second time to check out if they can churn out the classics such as chilli chicken and fried rice properly.....if not then I guess Ill stick to just about any other place but this one......

My First Ever Visit To This Restaurant Chain Was In The New Salt Lake Branch, In Swimming Pool.
I Enjoyed My Visit, The Ambiance Of The Place Has Been kept very traditionally Chinese, which is good.
There are 3 Separate Sections Allowing us to choose between 20 Or So Different Tables.
Our Order was slightly Standard, Tried the Rice, Noodles, Veg & Non-Veg Main Course Dishes.
The Menu Was Quite Elaborate, A Lot Of Choice's. The Service Was Good, Took 20 Mins For The Entire Order. Which Is Good Enough.
The Food Was Of Very Good Quality I Must Emphasis. All Items Tasted Good, Above Par.
Any-day A Better Taste Than 'Hakka', Cheaper Than 'Mainland China'.
Considering the Prices, Quantity & Quality, It was a wonderful experience all-together.
A Must Visit. Good Work Guys.

Was shocked to find the huge difference in quality between a dine in and home delivery from the same restaurant!! Went there for lunch on 2nd April'14 and ordered pan-fried chili fish, manchow soup, Singapore Meifoon (rice noodles) and chicken in oyster sauce all of which were yummy albeit little spicy!
Ordered the same menu on 5Aprl 14 via home delivery (bill number D128) and was shocked to find a pathetic tasting trickery for which I was cheated out of INR 700+. The manchow soup was not manchow but tasting oddly sour with no noodles. We had ordered mixed but there was hardly anything except rubbery, tasteless and stale smelling pieces of chicken in the soup.
Next was the rice noodles had the same rubbery stale pieces of chicken and was smelling of turmeric instead of any Chinese spices.
Lastly the chicken and vegetables in oyster sauce was a complete disaster, with the chicken being hard and tasteless, the vegetables being tasteless and stale and the gravy being too thin and sour to be oyster based gravy.
Wonder why the home delivery was a dump of stale and cheap Indo-Chinese type food.
Very bad experience team Chowman

Ordered again on 22 July 2014. Chicken momos were really good, garlic chicken was also good. The veg-Hakka noodles however had a strange taste and smell of burnt oil.

We ordered for our office function today after hearing very good reviews from freinds as well as Zomato of this outlet. In fact we even saw the review in the daily The Statesman also. We are extremely dissatisfied with the food as well as the service. We took parcel of Rice noodles, Chilly chicken (and fish) and fish pepper salt. The food is very very ordinary. Any chinese made at any of the local unnamed street stall makes tastier chinese dishes. Moreover they are dishonest in the sense that last week when we ordered we asked for the total bill value for 28 number of parcels of the above things and they told us to give them a reminder this morning and they will state the total bill value then. Today when we called we found that they are charging Rs 700/- for the parcel which they didn't make any whisper at the time of placing the order. Moreover even after specific instruction for sending plastic spoons and forks they didn't send anything so we had to eat these messy foods with our fingers!! The total experience about the restaurant is very very bad both in terms of food quality as well as service. In fact after getting such good reviews in my own locality, I told some of my friends and my son that we shall go there soon one day. I didn't know the existence of it in Saltlake. But my today's experience makes me take fresh decision to not to go to such untasted places ever!! And the same will be my advice to all the readers of this post if you like them( for whatever unknown reason!!!) then only you venture at this awful place. I shall never advice anyone else to venture here at any cost.

It was high time salt lake came up with another authentic chinese food joint and it seems like Chowman is the answer. I had heard a lot about this place which was situated in southern part of Kolkata in the Golfgreen and Ballygunj area and has recently opened up in salt lake. Again I got the food home delivered so I wouldnt be able to comment on the ambience and service quality but only on the food. I ordered for a konjee crispy lamb, chilly garlic chicken fried rice and chilly chicken dry. And surprisingly the order was delivered within 30mins of me calling them which was super fast and I was very impressed. The amount to be paid was 625 which is good enough. None of the dishes disappointed me, the konjee crispy lamb was the best, it was well made, crispy and spicy. I am truly impressed with this restaurant and am sure they will do well here and I cant wait to dine in. I would recommend this place to all Chinese food lovers as it wont disappoint you. Happy eating :)

Frankly speaking I was not known about chowman and thought that it's a small unknown types restaurant and serve good Chinese food. 

From zomato taken inputs from all food lovers and today plan was to visit chowman @ evening...

It's a superb interior in newly open @ salt lake . I love that decoration, color, lighting everything....

Not taken huge food as previous to that I'd taken momos from hamro momo. So just taken chicken Hakka noodles with kong pao chiken.

Food was too good as per quality and quantity as well...

Plan to visit next week once to check wanton chicken and momo...

Trust today's evening was awesome only for chowman...  

As my Xperia was not there with me taken with 2 meg so pic clearity was not there... Another funny things I was forget to take snap for food as I was soooo hungry that time haha

I am very sorry to be sharing a negative experience I had with Chowman Salt Lake.

I had ordered for home delivery last Saturday around 8:15 PM. They promised to make the delivery in half an hour. I waited till 9:30 PM and called them again. They said that the delivery boy was on his way and would reach any time. I kept calling them till 10:30 PM and the answer was the same. I even asked them to cancel the order if there was any issue with delivery but they replied with the same stance. I lost count of how many times I had called them. Every time they said that my food will reach me shortly.  I stopped calling after 10:30 PM.

The food finally did NOT arrive at all. Neither did  I receive any call from them to say that they had failed in their commitment.

I called again the next day to ask them the reason. They had no answer for this behaviour. When I wanted to escalate the issue they said that their GM would call me later. That call too has not come in the last 7 days.

I am amazed at this kind of indifferent attitude.

How can a business afford to do this with a customer ?

Finally let me say I have not experienced such a behaviour from any other outlet in Salt Lake.

Rubbish delivery service, never on time, takes at least 2 and half hours to deliver, on top of that the receptionist(jha as he said his name was) simply disconnects the phone when you state your discomfort. I did see the impunctuality and rudeness review prior by someone else, but still wanted to give them a chance but trust me they dont deserve a wee bit of opportunity...  real let down... as i said before, etiquette is more important than ambience so its a simple non no restaurant for now.... and now that i recieved the food they screw up royally with the ordered items. I ordered a mutton konjee, pork roast and 2 noodles. They gave me 1 Konjee, 1 roast mutton and 1 noodles with one chicken side dish(so forgot about other noodles). 

Now as per the quality of food i could not take more than a spoon full. Its blunt and gautams at bypass cooks better sidedishes than these posers. Bottom line 950 rupees wasted, i wasted mine... dont waste yours.

I had my first taste of Chowman food yesterday from their Salt Lake branch. Since it was for one person, it just had

1. Cantonese noodles(Egg)
2.Chilly fish in gravy

They delivered the food before time, which is always welcome. The noodles were definitely above average and the fish was insanely good. It was soft, the spice not overdone, the gravy not too thick or thin, and it melts in one's mouth. 
I loved the food. I apologise for the short review, and the fact that I've not actually been in the restaurant. Therefore, the rating is purely based on the delicacies I had :)

Updated review March 2017:
Quality of food has improved quite a lot from the last time I visited Chowman Salt lake outlet. Increasing the rating. I ordered 
Chicken chilli garlic noodles which was quite tasty. 
Kung pao chicken: This one was very well balanced in terms of flavour! A must try. 

My first visit to the newly opened Chowmans Saltlake branch(have eaten at their south kol branches earlier)...n I must say I am a little disappointed.
Let's start with the good things first... The decor inside is very nicely done... With dimly lit tables and comfortable seating arrangement. Now let's start with the food...
We ordered
Veg manchow soup which was nice and Thai prawn soup. The Thai soup had a lovely coconut milk aroma... however I found the soup very runny almost clear...I guess Thai soups should have a little more consistency to bring out the flavor of the coconut milk.

For main course we ordered Chilli Garlic noodles... which was OK.
Chilli babycorn mushroom... I found this way below expectation. The gravy had too much of chilli sauce which had not blended well and the mushrooms were tasteless . The next dish we ordered was Fish in Oyster Sauce which was good but again had a little to much of oil.
The quantity served (both chowmein and sides) were quite handsome... one dish more than adequate for 2 persons!

It gives me great Displeasure to write this review, I have been a loyal chowman fan and have ordered food from their Ballygunj outlet. I was also one of the first ones to write a review for their salt lake outlet . The Food on my first order was brilliant but what we faced yesterday was nothing short of appalling.

Have loved chowman for the fact that their veg food is as yummy as their non veg food . and  yesterday  they made sure my father' Birthday dinner is ruined . 
 
Our order was as follows..... 

Pan fried Chili Paneer 
Veg Manchurian 
Mixed veg in chili garlic sauce 
basil fried rice 
veg momos 
veg hakka noodles 
pan fried veg noodles 

--First and foremost , the order was placed at 8.08 and we received it approximately at 10. 15 . after repeated calling and also we weren't informed that so much time will be taken  

-- secondly, the veg momos seemed to be missing 

-- thirdly, horror or horrors .....The pan fried noodle we received  had chicken in them . 
-- The veg manchurian was hard and there was no gravy it seemed to tuned  into a large lump 
- the panner and the veg were so spicy , and we had categorically requested them to make it mild . 
- the rice was tasteless and the noodles were strictly OK ! 

One yelling over the phone and making calls to the ballygunj outlet we got the number of the chowman manager who managed to send the balance order and we finally began the meal at 10.30 and were purely disappointed with the taste . 
 
Chowman has been a favorite for the last 2 years and sadly i will not order from their salt lake outlet again . We well make sure we get food picked up from ballygunj ( if we order that is ) 

when we told them to take back the non veg pan fried noodle .... the delivery guy bluntly asked us to give it to the gate 
keeper 

PURE SHAME !



----- 21 Feb, 2014 -----

THANK GOD ! FINALLY ! 

Now I don't have to go all the way to Ballygunj ! For the last two years, Chowman to me is what happy meal is to my 4 yr old niece ! I had the most stressful week and deserved a good meal, and while looking up for places to order food from, I saw Chowman ... then I scroll down and see salt lake . and my expression was like !!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I had the biggest grin , but just to make sure I don't have high hopes I called up Ballgunj outlet and confirmed, and did my Little happy dance . 

My poor taste buds have had enough of torture from salt lake Chinese and i am so glad we now have chowman ! The food i ordered was my all time favourite . 

Chowman specials noodles . The mildly spiced  goodness topped with an oemlette and had brocolli and mushrooms 

The konjee crispy lamb was yummy . Every time i bought it from ballygunj by the tie i got to salt lake it always got soggy , but yesterday , it was crisp ! 

The kung bao chicken had always been brilliant and It was as always . 

I love the way Chowman takes good care in packing their food. Be it the little bottles of condiments or the chopsticks and the coxed double packed in cling film to avoid spillage . 

I have always been an ardent Chowman fan .....

This was one place I always wanted to try, having heard of the good food from friends and family, however it was just not happening. The other day while returning back I saw the home delivery bike guy with the Chowman box and noted the number down. Yesterday when I went back home, my mom had a pleasant surprise for me , she was int he mood for Chinese and had ordered in some from Chowman. The food came promptly on time. We ate vegetarian meifoon, vegetarian noodles and fish. It was just excellent in terms of taste, quantity and look and feel. The meifoon was not oily and just yum, we finished it within no time. It's a great place and I would recommend it to those who do not want to venture out and a fantastic option in Saltlake.
A huge thumbs up..

Hmm what to say... Went to this place after having many fabulous eating experience in their Tollygunge branch but today this place really let me down. We were 9 in number and so had to wait a little while for them to set the tables for us. We ordered a lot dishes which are as follows-
1 Mixed schezwan noodles,2 Chicken schezwan noodles, 1 Pan fried noodles, 1 chowman special rice, 1 chicken lollypop, 1 konjee crispy chicken, 1 tsing hoi chicken, 1 kung pao chicken, 1 schezwan chicken. All these orders except(chicken noodles) took 20 minutes to reach our table. The order of the chicken noodles took a lot of time to come and we were getting restless. The kitchen staff were not able to handle the busy schedule of the restro and were facing problems in getting the dishes ready in time. But the worst thing that happened was that one of the prawn piece of the Special Chowman Rice had a insect inside it and one of the Chicken piece in the rice became black and a rotten smell was coming out of it. So overall I am sorry but I cannot give more than the rating I gave.

The service is absolutely bogus !! People don't pay attention while taking orders. They also have a very rough attitude towards the customers. They make customers wait un necessarily for their own mistakes. 

Overall i will strongly not recommend anyone to visit them. Very badly managed.  Shud hv given negative rating!!!

Aft having lots of gr8 reviews in zomato we r in chowman for exploring it's cuisine.
We started with crabmeat soup with prawn wanton.soup is awesome but wanton isn't worth.in main course mixed rice is good but not enough prawn/chicken.chilli fish wine good but prawn in black bean sauce is too disappointing.prawn quality is damm bad.
Plz it's necessary to write original reviews for foodies like us.

Tonight, we again had a take-out from the Salt Lake outlet. The Kung-Pao Chicken was fabulously good. But the Cantonese Mixed Chow had 2/3 pieces of Prawn with their back veins intact, that was gross and disgusting, and lastly to our horror we discovered a tiny string of steel-wool inside the chow mein container along with bits and pieces of the food left. This was really bad. I immediately notified the  outlet about this incident, the person who took my call was courteous and assured me that he will see to it.  I am sort of disappointed.

Finally a good place to eat Chinese nearby my place. Haka is there but on every aspect of eating out and take away Chowman stands out. Great job, keep it up!

Good food nd peaceful environment. First visit. Great interiors. Welcome addition in salt lake.  My husband found the dark interiors bit claustrophobic.

Wonderful and 'thank god' something not inside the City. Chowman solves our Chinese food cravings and how. Great decor, love the way the lights light up the tables while keeping the rest dark and private, gracious (though with some start-up jitters) service and of course finger licking soul food. The best thing about Chowman Salt Lake though is its location, i don't have to beg/threaten my husband to drive me into the congested city to satisfy my cravings for decent Chinese food that doesn't burn a hole in our pockets. Really happy to eat here and hope to take all my friends and family there in the near future.

To start off Chowman was always my favourite....n m glad dat its now in Salt lake.Mixed fried rice with Hongkong Chicken and Chilli Fish....the mix was awesome.And how to forget my all time favourite Pork in Oyster sauce...its was insane as alwayz.The pork with stirred veggies is jus yumilicious and its really hard to resist the taste which soothes your taste buds like anything.Its definitely a must have when u hit this awesome place with the authentic chinese taste your just lookin for.

My search for a good Chinese restaurant in Salt Lake ends here. Awesome and cosy ambience, very good service and excellent food. The varieties in the menu were good. I recommend Golden fried prawn, Fish pepper salt, Kung pao chicken and Chilly wine fish.

Awesome! Salt Lake needed a decent chinese resturant and finally we have it. I dont think I will tread anywhere else for chinese. Here is what I loved-
1. Ambience-relaxing, spa-like, quiet, calming, cosy, secretive, special, a different world...
2. Service-attentive & poltite and courteous...
3. Menu- specialized yet extensive
4. Konjee Lamb- crispy yet not oily, yummy to the core...
5. Pan fried noodles- noodles are actually different and the sauce is mind blowing! Mushroom excess....
6. Devils chicken- tomatoey yet not sickningly sweet, light yet spicy...
7. It makes me wish i had 2 stomachs, the portions are huge
8. I cant wait to try their Thai..
Dont wait, go eat.... :-)
