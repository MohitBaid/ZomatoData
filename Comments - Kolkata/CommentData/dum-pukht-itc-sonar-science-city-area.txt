First visit with family at Dum Pukht, ITC SONAR on a special occassion and the experience lived upto the occassion. Mr Aktar was a perfect host in suggesting delicious dishes and narrating the story behind it. So was the other staff at the restaurant.

The ambience at Dum Pukht is extremely welcoming and keeping with the cuisine theme. The ambience at Dum Pukht is replete with rich Onyx cladding on the walls with finely veneered timber columns and plush furnituring. The traditional Indian manner of serving by courses has been revived by Dum Pukht, and a silver Dastarkan at each place setting acts as a base to the specially designed crockery.

We were warmly greeted by ‚ÄúAkhtar‚Äù who happily explained about Awadhi cuisine and Dum Pukht. As a part of their 15 years celebration Dum Pukht is having a set crystal menu which is a celebration of the flavours of ITC Sonar‚Äôs signature kitchens.

We began our meal with ‚ÄúMahashir Dumpukth‚Äù (fresh river fish marinated with cumin and fresh yogurt and cooked in dum) and ‚ÄúDumpukht Kakori‚Äô ( a delicate melt-in-your-mouth kebab of finely minced lamb flavoured with cloves and cinnamon wrapped around a skewer and chargrilled). Dum Pukht is known for its Kakori Kebab which is an all time favourite. It has an outburst of exquisite flavours once you have it.
For the mains we had ‚ÄúSubz Miloni‚Äù ( a melange of seasonal vegetables cooked in a smooth green puree of spinach and fenugreek), ‚ÄúDal Dumpukht‚Äù ( arhar lentil cooked with yellow chillies, yoghurt and exotically tempered with caramelized garlic) and the star of the show ‚ÄúDumpukht Koh-e-Awadh‚Äù ( chefs recipe for qorma of elegantly exposed lamb shanks. Dum cooked in their own cardamom tinged juices and marrow, finished with saffron)
Dum Pukht serves not just cuisine, but an experience that you will cherish for a very long time

This gorgeous fine-dining restaurant at ITC Sonar has to be one of my favourites. The ambience literally transports me to the royal Mughal palaces. Coming to the food, the Kakori Kebab and Galauti Kebabs are heavenly. The Dum Pukht biryani is one of the best I've ever had and why not? The chef hails to the family of the royal kitchen and that very much reflects in the Food. The Shahi Tukda must not be missed. 
Special thumbs up for the courteous staff and wonderful hospitality.

The start was not quite food as i went with pre table booking but when i reached they didnt find my reservation . I had a confirmation from zomato as well
.. okay ! So next they compensated with the best table located and also allowed us to enjoy some time of our own followed by welcome drinks.

As it was during durga pooja time- ashtami, the crowd was quite high and it was festive mood ambience throughout.
We ordered as recommended by the waiter according to our choices .

The best ever kakori kabab- mutton glides in the mouth and it is so soft that you definitely need nothing with it.
The main courses of course includes dum pukht biriyani which was full of ghee and soft fresh Dehradun rice cooked mutton and several of them!
Another thing which was very tasty and to dive for was the ribs platter..

A must go once a year ... Lucknowi food served..

As you step in,the classical music and soothing dim light purge off the hustle and bustle of the city and you enter into the luxury and  .....of the by-gone era .
It won't be sufficient to say that the restaurant  presents the Awadhi cuisine at its best.Rather it re-creates  that era of unique delicacies.Lately, we went there for our Panchami dinner (during Durga puja).As appetisers we ordered Dora Kebab Rehmami and Dum Pukht Kakori  kebab.The foremost one had that signature uniqueness of Dum Pukht. Specially Marinated Boneless chunks of lamb were again wrapped with minced lamb with herbs and spices like mace and dalchini.It was then  roasted in charcoal flame to give the smokey flavour.Dum Pukht   Kakori was the original kakori kebab with a finer aroma of dalchini and saffron. Both of them just melted into mouth leaving a  delicate taste and feel of a royal cuisine. Then came the  house speciality "Dum Pukht Biriyani ".Simply speaking, it's one of its own. We had it a couple of times  before and never had it failed to match our expectation. Nowhere else we have found such a Biriyani with smooth flavours of spices and the subtle aroma of kewra and itar gently merging with the light basmati rice.The lamb piceces just fall off from the bones with even a gentle stroke .The dinner ended with Shahi Tukra: another exotic re-creation of Dum Pukht.The rich saffron flavoured Rabri and the softbread together transcends any food lover to a world of surreality.How can simple bread and milk turn into such wonder! 
Last but not the least I would like to mention about the honest and prudent guidance of the waiters and waitresses of this restaurant specially. Every time we visit this place,they help us in choosing the menu by giving expert suggestions and realistic estimation of the quantity that we should order ....something that we miss in some other top notch restaurant of the city. A good dish of a restaurant can lift your mood, proper ambience with it soothes your mind but this honest judicious guidance  gives you the feeling that you are experiencing something of the finest quality. Here in Sonar( be it in Dum Pukht or in Peshawri or in Pan Asian ) this seems to be the most beautiful thing that I ever experienced.

Dum Pukht in ITC Sonar is always on the list of must visit places for a foodie in Kolkata !

I visited this place on the Diwali Weekend to celebrate the birthday of a friend ! We had made prior reservation for a table for two, and thus even though very crowded we weren't made to wait, but ushered in and given a comfortable corner table !

The ambience and the decor of the place is exemplary and justifies a luxury dining experience !

We ordered Daawat and Nazaaqat respectively ! These are pre set menu of a list of items at a given cost, however they are customizable without additional cost ! (The listings about price are not completely updated in Zomato). (Complimentary papad is served while your dishes are prepared !)

We were served two pieces of each starter in the said menu and special mention for the Dudiya Kebab as it was excellent !

(We got to explore both complete set of veg and non veg cuisines as my friend was a vegetarian)

In the main course for Daawat both the meat preparations were exquisite ! The dal preparation however was lacking ! The biriyani was by far the best I had till date !

For Nazaaqat the Panner dish was excellent but the other dishes didn't live up to the benchmark set by the paneer and hence were disappointing! The veg biriyani though was pretty good! My friend had customized the spinach dish with a dish for cauliflower , but sadly it left a bad taste in the mouth !

Coming to the dessert section , we asked what would be the best of the lot, and were ably guided by Priyanka (Thank you !) ! I would recommend diners to trust her judgment on the dessert ! The dessert left a wonderful taste in the mouth !

They also served an eggless cake for the special occasion of the birthday , which indeed was very very well baked ! Would definitely like to give the confectionary a try some day !

It being a diwali weekend , the promptness of service was missing , but quality of service never lacked which is commendable !

It was a pleasure dining at The Dum Pukht , and definitely recommended !

At Dum Pukht I had the best Biriyani of my life!¬†So it all started a few years back when I first heard about the gem from fellow foodies . Something or the other had always kept me from having a great dining experience at this restaurant , but it all came to an end on the 13th of October 2017 , which also happened to be my Mom's birthday!¬†
We had made a reservation prior and was immediately seated on entry . Our server for the evening Ms Priyanka took us to the table and soon we were seating comfortably and looking at the menu. So what to order at the speciality Awadhi cuisine restaurant ? Most definitely the Dum Pukht Biriyani , and another thing I was told not to miss was the Kakori Kebab.¬†The service was quite prompt and soon a plate of masala papads , with four choices of dips arrived on the table . The dips were interesting - a sweet papaya chutney , roasted onions , a flavoursome garlic dip and pudina chutney .¬†And soon enough arrived the delectable Kakori kebab along with her well suited consort , the gracious Sheermal !The kebabs broke immediately while coming in contact with the knife and melted in the mouth at the first spoonful ! The sheermal delightfully complimented the spicy kebabs . And with this we had completed the first course of the meal .¬†Next arrived the Dum Pukht Biriyani and from the moment the lid was open I was in love with the celestial aroma! If the smell enticed us , the taste delighted us endlessly! The aroma of saffron matched up with the spices brilliantly and together infused with the delectable rice and the mutton it created an unparalleled experience , that cannot be replicated in most places! The mutton was soft and fell off the bone at the slightest pull with the spoon , filled with flavours and would be any meat lover's delight!¬†On coming to know it was my¬†Mother's birthday , they had very sweetly arranged for a delicious Chocolate Mousse cake ! We were very touched by this kind gesture and the cake only added to the experience and our celebrations!¬†The decor was tastefully done , though the lighting was a bit too dim for my liking . The staff were extremely courteous and¬† the service extremely prompt ! Satisfied , we thanked Asst. Master Chef Md. Zubair Qureshi and Ms. Priyanka who efficiently served us all evening¬† , as we left with a smile on our face , thinking about returning soon for another great encounter with Awadhi cuisine at Dum Pukht.

My family and I visited Dum Pukht for my postgraduation dinner. The interior is simplistic but decently decked with an air of sophistication, with big vases adorning corners. I found the glasses noteworthy, fashioned regally to suit the Awadhi cuisine.
We tried the Dum Pukht Biryani, and the Murgh Khushk Purdah and Murgh Handi Qorma as per the server's gracious suggestion. The dessert consisted of Shahi Tukra.
The biranj or biryani was one of the finest biryani I've ever tasted. Made with basmati rice simmered with the softest lamb in mace, ittar and kewra, and finished in a sealed handi, it was too good to taste and nothing like the conventional biryani we get to taste elsewhere, except perhaps a few gem of a places. The credit for their biryani goes to their master chef Imtiaz Qureshi who was awarded the Padma Shri for his culinary skills.
The Murgh Khushk Purdah is one of their specialties and a must try. It's a resplendant boneless chicken dish, drier and with lesser gravy than Handi Qorma, cured in star anise-scented marinade, grilled in a tandoor, and dum-cooked with an assortment of vegetables and sprinkling of mace behind a purdah of puff pastry. This was the best item made up of some of the juciest and most succulent morsels of soft chicken, along with the delicious biryani.
The Murgh Handi Qorma consisted of drumsticks of chicken simmered in brown onion, garlic and yoghurt gravy, perfumed saffron, rosewater and garnished with almond slivers. It tasted well, specially the mild spicy gravy.
Shahi Tukra is served in quite a few restaurants. The Dum Pukht's one is an exotic dessert of saffron rabri spread on a slice of syrup-soaked homemade bread and garnished with silver leaf, pistachio and almonds. Served piping hot it is a good warm dessert to end a delicious North Indian dinner.
We had a highly satisfactory gastronomic experience at Dum Pukht. The ITC hospitality and service are par excellence and absolutely praiseworthy. Those looking for a hearty Awadhi meal or simply to taste some delish North Indian food should visit Dum Pukht. üëçüëç

We came to this place not knowing what to expect. What a delight it was.  The food prepared by chef md. Zubain was excellent to the T.  Had a brilliant experience which transported me to lucknow - great food, meticulously prepared, Light to the stomache yet aromatic and tasty food. Difficult to find tasty meals even in 5 star hotel nowadays. However, dum phukt beats them all and I am fan now.. Thanks to the chef and his Team. Real magicians.  Special mention to our server Mr. Akhtar. He gave us his time, and effort to make us feel comfortable and genuinely interested to serve us good food. His service and care and hospitality was impeccable.

Specializing in Awadhi food, Dum Pukht is located in ITC Sonar in Kolkata. If you like dum cuisine, this is the place to head to: Dum Pukht epitomizes the 200-year-old-plus legacy of specialized cuisine from the kitchens of the nawabs of Awadh. Traditional dum cooking is done on slow fire in sealed deghs to catch the subtle aroma of spices for rich and flavoursome results. While their signature Dum Pukht Kakori served on the Ulte Tawa ka Paratha is highly recommended as well as the Murgh Rezala, Koh-e-Awadh or the Chef Special Lamb Shank Korma, Jhinga Dum Nisha, Murgh Khushk Purdah, the delectable Dum Pukht Biryani and Shahi Tukda, you can order any of their preparations and rest assured it will be a meal fit for the blue-blooded. Both d√©cor and service are excellent.

Coming back to Dum Pukht after quite come time. Last was in Delhi. And boy was it a feast. 
Lovely ambiance and warm service like always. Would be disappointed if it wasn't. The mutton was signature. Juicy and perfectly cured. Dal Makhani was creamy. Quite a filling dinner post. Happy tummy!

Dum Pukht mixes ambience with taste in an exquisite manner. Though we had selected a fixed menu platter quality and quantity truly gives you a 7 star feel. One must try is it's house specialty mutton kakori kebab. You can also try the jumbo prawns and lobster which is just yum. To quench your thirst of dessert you can try the melting Sahi tukra. To sum up it's a true luxury dining combined with excellent food.

An excellent and fulfilling experience at Dum Pukht. We went there with family to celebrate our anniversary and had a lovely one. Right from the time we entered every member of staff greeted us. We started our dinner with the murg chandi tikka which had 4 sizeable pieces of succulent chicken in white drizzled gravy.  We ordered the famous kakori kebab which came along with the shirmal paratha.  Both the kebabs were awesome and melt in the mouth. We followed this up with mutton dum biryani which was accompanied by raita. Food was delicious and sumptuous leaving no room for desert. The service was praiseworthy with special mention of Ms Priyanka who paid special attention since we had the celebration. The complementary cake was also yummm. Definitely look forward to the next visit.

simply put;the food was delectable that will tease your palate.I along with my wife went to this place after seeing great words about this place and oh man! the place was more than the words.The staff there were well informed and very much hospitable.we ordered Habibia kabab which was well prepared and spices were rightly put.As this dish takes tym to prepare mean while we were offered kakori kabab on the house and it was impacble in taste.kabab was so soft that it realy melted in the mouth.for the main course we ordered shahi nihari and khamiri roti.the dish was perfectly prepared.To sum up the dinner it was shahi tukda which was the only thing which i personally didnt like very much as i am very critical about sweet dish.But again that was on the house so what the hecküòâ.The best part was the hospitality of the restqurant staff.they are most courteous ppl i have met in hotel industry.Mr Rahul(the restaurant manager) is really nice person who took immence care in providing good times for his guest.so in the end i would only say that this place deserve a michelin star rating for there great work in kitchen and on floor.will visit again soon.

Its a over hyped place with absolutely no value for money.... The worst food that i had experienced in any of the five star restaurants in India... Avoid this place... Though the staff and ambience is great but you need to look at the taste of the food as well... The 2 rating i gave is solely for the courteous staff and ambience....

Dum-Pukht, this was my 2nd visit to the restaurant. Went in there with my family, had an amazing experience. The food as expected was tasty, specially the "Murg Chandi Tikka". We booked the table in advance so did not had to wait as it was a sunday night. The staffs were very courteous as you would expect in ITC hotels. Priyanka one of the staff member was very helpful in getting us seated and was always on her toes in getting us whatever we need. She also arranged a pillow n shawl for my new born as it was cold inside. This is what you expect when you visit a brand like ITC. Thank You so much everyone for a memorable evening, would love to visit again.

Have been to this place many times but just got a chance to write a review this time. Dum pukht is one of the best Indian restaurants in the city , serving awadhi and afghani cuisine. 
We ordered drinks like fresh lime soda , and I ordered the fatal attraction which had the dominating flavour of lychee. They served complimentary papad with four types of chutneys , there were fried onions , garlic achaar, sweet mango achaar and green chutney. The green chutney was delicious with the sourness of curd. 
For starters we ordered the kakori kebab and murgh malai tikka for non veg and the hara kebab and dudhiya kebab for vegetarian. The hara kebab was a bit higher on the salty side and it was dry like it's supposed to be. The dudhiya kebab consisted of two slices of cottage cheese with a filling in the middle. It tasted very good and the flavour was perfect. Coming to the kakori kebab , it's a must try at this restaurant. The meat had been minced so well that it had the melt-in-the-mouth consistency , and was spiced well with cinnamon , clove and bay leaves. It was served with sheermal, which is a sweet saffron bread usually to be eaten with kakori or galouti kebabs. The murgh malai tikka was very presentable , with a silver work on top and the marinade creamy and soft. The chicken was well cooked inside. 
Whenever you visit dum pukht , you should never miss their kakori kebab. The other dish in this list is the black dal. The dal was absolutely perfect , having a rich texture and having the flavour of tomatoes mostly. We also had assorted breads and they all were well cooked. There was lamb and aloo kofta too , which I found to be okay. 
Next we had the biryani. Although the vegetarian biryani was good , the non vegetarian seemed overcooked and the lamb pieces seemed hard to tear. The flavour of rice was not very distinct and the it seemed more moist than it should be. 
Later for dessert we had the shahi tukda , which was basically a soft fried bread drenched in sugar syrup with a malai topping. It was adequate in sweetness and was very good to taste. 
Dum pukht had always been one of my favourite restaurants. Their kakori kebab and the black dal are to die for. The service is prompt and the ambience is amazing.

Amazing service,  brilliant indian food.  A little on the costlier side compared to its competitors like Sonargaon or Guchhi.  The ambience is very nice with a feel of privacy in every table.  

If go there to celebrate any occasion,  they treat with a cake from the bakery which is with compliments from them and acts as an important part of the celebration.

Biriyani could be a little better. Overall a good experience.

This is one of the restaurant of ITC Sonar Bangla. The food at the Dum Pukht is outstanding. The starters included the Kakori (mutton) kebab and Chandni (Chicken) kebab. Both are just mouth watering options! Followed them up with a light, fluffy mutton biryani - topped with a lovely kulfi or faluda. Great food with good ambiance.

My favourite restaurant at the ITC Sonar. The ambience is lovely! The service was excellent. We tried their speciality, that is the Dum Pukht Kakori...and that was superb! The harra kebab didn't suit my taste though. Then we had Dum Pukht Biryani and Murgh Khushk Purdah. The chicken side dish was so good! It was grilled in tandoor and was served with an assortment of veggies.

This restaurant in ITC Sonar Bangla never fails to keep up to your expectations. Been there numerous times. The Black dal is the best thing here. You won't get Dal Makhani better than this in Kolkata. Quantity is fine. Service is great. Though only open for dinners. You may spot some great personalities here. We were 6 people and our bill came around Rs.5000-6000. there's an open kitchen to peep into. Nothing to say about the ambience(ofcourse you will be at ITC Sonar Bangla ).
Great experience!

Dum Pukht, ITC Sonar boasts of some of the best Awadhi cuisine in the country, and boy do they deliver. The food here is to die for. Imtiaz Qureshi and some of his family members, overlook and ensure the high quality and impeccable taste and standards are always maintained. The decor and a service, ensure that you have some of the best fine dining experience in the city, and it greatly compliments all the delicious concoctions of the chefs in the kitchen. Price maybe a little steep but who cares. Good things in life do not come cheap!

I am platinum ITC one member and a regular visitor of ITC hotels and restaurants. Dumpukt at ITC Sonar has been on the decline for sometime but my experience last night with family consisting of 23 people was the final nail in the coffin. The food, service was absolutely terrible. The signature black Dal was un delectable, a simple ice tea was similar. The starters were a far cry in terms of taste of what it used to be. If one had the breads then the curries were missing or if the curries were there then the required breads were not there. Dumpukt at ITC sonar is a fine dining and costs are commensurate to any fine dining restaurant. A big let down in terms of experience and the money spent pinched you because the experience and food were just not okay. Wanted to change the black Dal but they delayed the whole thing so much that I had to refuse the replacement. However they ensured that it was part of my bill. I insisted that they take off the Dal charge and they did it then along with a ice tea charge as well. I wanted to redeem my points but even after waiting half an hour they could not get th connection. Captain Akhtar at dumpukt first refused that points can be redeemed and captain Ranjan wanted to pack me off once he realized that he was not able to connect to their server for redemption. Finally Amrik Dey came to rescue and he offered some discount once he also realized that even after my wait they were not able to solve it. I had no choice but to leave with what discount he thought it best for the occasion. Overall experience was poor, food offered by Chef Zubair not great and service below par. Think hard before you want to visit this restaurant which badly needs a facelift overall.

The ambiance is just amazing from interiors to cutlery. The atmosphere is beautiful with the soothing background music. The food was sopper delicious.  Little experience bill for 2 was 4000rs. The only thing i didn't like is the service. The person who was serving was very rude and in a hurry which i had no idea why. It was Mr Aktar who served us. That can be improved. 
Food 4.5/5
Ambiance 4/5
Service 2.5/5

A milestone in our life always calls for a celebration and cant be better than availing service of ITC Hotels. Parking was like a breeze through valet. However on reaching the door of the restaurant we were told our reservation was not showing in the record. Thankfully we had mail copy with us. Not a good sign of service one can expect from ITC. We were directed to our table at the corner. The table was decorated with ruby red wine glass and silverware cutleries. Elegant indeed. 
The menu is perfect balance of vegetarian and non-vegetarian Awadhi cuisines. In starters we had Dum Pukht Kakori Kebab. The delicate finely minced lamb melts in your mouth. Can be best enjoyed with sheermal served with the dish. Quantity is less though. Number of sheermal served is not in proportion with kebab quantity. Taste can't be better, best kakori kebab ever tasted.
We thought to opt for an entr√©e before going to main course. What can be better than their signature dish Raan-e-Dum Pukht. A full leg of lamb marinated in dark rum, stuffed with onions and pickled garlic cooked on dum or slow cooking. Portion was huge and can easily feed 3-4 adults. A true innovation in cooking with minimal simple ingredients by MasterChef Imtiaz Qureshi.
Now time for main course and you can't avoid ordering Dum Pukht Biriyani. Basmati rice simmered with lamb in ittar and kewra cooked on dum inside a sealed porcelain handi. The biriyani was neither having any artificial yellow colour nor drenched in dalda. It's was light and flaky and one can taste each and every spice in the menu. Light fragrance of ghee and basmati rice was like an icing on cake. In my entire lifetime till now never got chance to witness such taste of biriyani. Bravo..applause !!
In desserts we were served complementary cake on table to celebrate our occasion. Quite a personal touch indeed!¬†

Having food here is a gastronomical experience but service was complete let down here. At first they goofed up with reservations then it was quite a challenge to get attention of servers for refilling water. Table where we were made seated was extremely stuffy as the air-condition was not functioning. In spite of repeated complaints the situation didn't improve or rather servers were not paying any heed. Price was INR 5835 inclusive all. They don't levy service charge.

If you want to explore the art of Mughlai food (Awadhi style) cooked in slow, low flame over a long period of time then this is the place to go. Longer duration of cooking ensures that the rich aroma of the exotic spices gets blended with the food.  I have been there at least a dozen times and finally I get the chance of writing a review about this awesome place.

The ambiance is very calm and serene. The ideal one for a quiet and pleasant dinner with the family. The staff are very cordial and friendly. However, the food takes considerable time to be delivered. But, that can be easily overlooked if you take in to account the style of cooking and the excellent taste of the dishes served. The cost might seem high but the food is definitely value for money.

Recommended Dishes:

Kakori Kabab: Must have. Finely minced lamb with aroma of exotic spices served with small ghee fried parathas.  The moment you put the pieces of kabab in your mouth it just melts. No need of chewing it. 

Mutton Dum Biriyani: Typical Awadhi Biriyani, very light and easy to digest. The fragrance of the Biriyani will make you salivate. The mutton pieces are very tender.

Jhinga Dum Nisha: Although I am not a prawn fan, but I like this one. If you are a prawn lover you will just love this dish.

P.S. Make sure you inform them at the time of booking if you are visiting on a special occasion like Birthday or Wedding Anniversary. A delicious complementary cake is provided at the end which is the ideal dessert after a sumptuous meal.

The kebabs are really tasty here and this place is famous for Mughlai cuisine. I really liked the prawn and mutton kebabs. Biriyani was also good and quite light. Service and ambience are good. Quality wise it is fine, however , I would recommend more variety and more quantity ! Overall a happy experience.

Let's keep this short.

Possibly the best Lucknowi cusine in Eastern India.

Visited after some time and things are better.The decor remains the same for about a decade now but service is improved and attentive.

The five yardsticks I follow in a fine dining establishment are

Ambience

Welcome

Comfort

Service

Food.....quality and preparation.

This place scores 5/5 in all except maybe the service time which at times is inordinately long.I love the understated elegance and the faint piano playing old Hindi songs.....superb.

We asked for Jhinga Dum Nisha ( Tandoori prawns ), Dora Kebab Rahmani ( Rough mince mutton sheekh kebab ),and Habibia Chops ( lamb chops ).

The prawns were a little tough,else it was sheer heaven in your palette especially the Habibia Chops.Its a must have.Lamb chops perfectly marinated,slightly sour,slow cooked melting in your mouth in a thick gravy.Perfect.The Dora kebabs also perfectly capture the roughness of the sheekh kebab and whole spices.

We also had the DumPukht Biryani and Hyderabadi Nihari.Both were consummate examples of slow cooking perfection.

The Biryani had the taste of ghee,the meat was' just right ' tender with moisture intact and the rice was perfect as well.You could actually feel the Dum.....

The Nihari was silky,flavourful and perhaps the best meat dish I have had in a long time.

We finished with the koolfi which also was the very best that we have tasted recently.Rich,creamy,not very sweet.........Happy,very happy!!!!!

‚ÄúSublime experiance of slow cooked food‚ÄùThis brand of signature restaurant from the house of ITC is a particular favourite of mine. What's not to love? The delicate dum biriyani, made in a clay pot in the Katchi style where the rice and meat all cook together. The melt in mouth kebabs the flaky and soft parathas. I could go on and on. If single diner and hungry, try their set menu. Great value for money (relatively). This offers an opportunity to sample a wide variety in a single meal.I remember the time when I was privileged to eat a meal here ‚Äécooked by the legendary Chef Imtiaz Khureshi. He insisted that I try the garlic kheer. While my innate sense of taste protested at a sweet dish made from garlic but truth be told it was divine. Shall never forget the taste!!

By far one of the best Indian food experience ever of me. In was staying at ITC Sonar Bangla for a night and I just knew where I wanted to have dinner. Missing out on this food would've been a sin. I walked in with my colleagues and we were warmly welcomed. The ambience is amazing and regal. The table setting is beautiful and the service staff was warm and friendly. It has an open kitchen so u can watch the cooking as well. We ordered Galouti kebab, Seekh kebab, Fish kebab and a veg version of galauti kebab that's made of wheat and tomato. I must say the kebabs were so soft and tender and the starters were amazing. For the main course we ordered Khameeri roties, Dal dum pukht, mutton nihari, mutton dum biryani, chicken dum biryani. The food was amazing, Dal was out of this world and the biryanis were so fragrant and meaty in the best way imaginable. I am looking forward to visiting this place again.

Dum Pukht is one of the finest joints in the city situated inside ITC The Sonar. No doubt the ambience is delightful. The moment u will enter u will feel good automatically. The seating arrangements were nice with long tables and the kitchen can be seen from the seating area as it is covered by glass. We ordered a starter with lamb biriyani and chicken kadhai as main course. Sahi tukra as dessert. The taste was classy and perfect. I went with family and it was a treat from my grandfather so it was Very special for us. It's definitely not pocket friendly in fact it was very heavy , around 10 k. It was a once in lifetime experience .

Dum Pukht is a restaurant located inside the Renowned 5 Star ITC Sonar Bangla situated on the busiest EM Bypass. The decor and ambience of the Restora is quite impressive. It has been my first to Dum Pukht. Based on some reliable recos I tried the Kakori Kebab along with Sheermal. Both the preparations were magical. The kebabs are really soft and succulent and melts in the mouth easily. Needless to mention the hospitality and service. These are the two things which determine the pricing of the foods. On the flip side the foods are really pricey. Though I have tried in Hyatt and Taj but personally I felt price wise ITC is on the higher side. Anyways if someone is reading my review he/ she should definitely give a try to this place. Though I did not try the Dum Pukht Gosht, I shall try this one very soon.

This is one of the most revered restaurants I have ever been to. If ever anyone said, "You cannot eat only dal with naan"; they LIED. You can literally just eat naan (butter or otherwise) with the dal makhani they serve. It is sinfully delicious. Their mutton dishes (tikka, platter & rogan josh) are simply too good to describe. If I were a don, I would have simply kidnapped the chef. And yes, they are outrageously expensive.

This place hardly disappoints. Well appointed staff, beautifully decorated place, well lit and easy on the eyes with soft background score and live see through counter where chefs are hard at work, it's easily one of the most romantic and best places to celebrate any special occasion or if you just want to gorge on some super delicious food.  
What I absolutely love about this place is that this one is a quiet place, I can easily have a conversation while enjoying my food. So far thankfully I have never encountered any wailing or curious kids who just wanders around to see what's on your plate. The cutlery is top notch, super fine and scratch free! Now that's a rare sight these days. 
I have not been very experimental whenever I have visited this place, mostly started with a freshly squeezed watermelon juice, followed by some kebabs and then the main course mainly comprising of chicken rezala  or some boneless chicken in some nicely simmered spicy gravy, my family swears by their lamb preparations. I love their super succulent chicken kebabs and their assorted bread basket is also quite nice. The variety of breads especially the parathas are to die for. 
Good on portions I have only good things to say about their food.But what I find brilliant is their dessert section, authentic Indian desserts ranging from gulab jamuns to phirni with chopped almonds, every person with a sweet tooth should try them out. 
Dum Pukht is one of the speciality restaurants of ITC and undoubtedly one of the best they have got. 
Will be back soon!

Went to Dum Pukth with high expectations knowing full well that it is one of the best¬† restaurants in Kolkata serving North Indian food and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. The food prepared in their own slow cooking style was truly awesome. I would like to especially mention those melt in the mouth Kakori Kebabs and also the Koh-e-awadh containing some of most tender pieces of mutton that I ever had. The raan too was good and the Biryani flavourful. The only things that disappointed were the rotis and naans, which I guess is not their speciality. They were very ordinary and nowhere near the standard set by the other dishes.

The staff were courteous and the ambiance nice (although it could have been better with the place more brightly lit).¬† Overall a great experience.

Conveniently located inside the ITC Sonar near Science city, Dum Pukht is strictly for special evenings - unless you are loaded with your dad's black money! The ambience is understated, could be more royal for the money they charge. ¬†the Apparently the Kakori Kebab melts in the mouth and the accompanying sheermal is delightful. Have your single malts with ease and the evening would be a good one!

Food here is good, but not as per the standards of the original dum pukht in delhi. The kakori kebabs are really soft and melt in your mouth. The mutton shorba is very tasty. Biryani is average. Keep going back for the kakori kebabs. :) staff are sometimes not as sharp as you would expect at an ITC hotel.

‚ÄúExcuse me‚Ä¶. can we have some water please ? ‚Äù and that‚Äôs the phrase we kept on uttering hopelessly in our gastronomic adventure in Kolkata‚Äôs one of the most celebrated Awadhi Restaurant- Dum Pukht, ITC Sonar. The journey is of ups and downs, happiness and sorrow, much like one can expect from Indian cuisine (not from a 5* super luxury hotel though‚Ä¶.. ). Let‚Äôs start. 

How to go and When to go:

This is at THE ITC sonar hotel- its landmark venture for awadhi cuisine. For the lesser-known mortals, the hotel is situated at the crossing of E M Bypass and Park Circus- bypass connector. Open for Lunch and Dinner on all days- closed in between. 

Experience:

We entered ITC, took a left and the third restaurant is Dum Pukht (Considering the board for Peshawar as one). The sitting is excellent- table is so full with crockery and cutlery that lesser mortals (my son for example) got really confused for which one to use when and started poking me‚Ä¶. Water was served to us. The steward took the order and all went well for the time being. Shortly, we were served the chutney bowl (the sweet papaya chutney and garlic chutney was brilliant and soon disappeared) and those cone shaped tandoori papad platter- complementary of course. 

The mocktails came and we got the first shock of the evening. We ordered for Ginger Ale and Shirley Temple. ¬†

In the Shirley Temple, the cherry was missing as well as the slight amount of ginger ale‚Ä¶. And in the Ginger Ale, the ginger flavor was missing. Probably a bad day for the bartender- its ok we thought and the first kebab was served. ¬†

It was the famous Kakori Kebab and it simply blew us off. Its brilliance on a dish. Once we put it inside our mouth, it just melted, yet didn‚Äôt break when held by the fork. The sheermal (complementary) which came with it was little sweetish bread ‚Äì complementing the kebab nicely. 

‚ÄúWaiter, can we have water please ? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ‚Äú

The second item was Murg Chandi Tikka. Large chicken breast cubes marinated in subtle spices , a creamish texture on top and had the smooth silky texture. Pretty good. ¬†

‚ÄúWaiter, can we have water please ? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ‚Äú¬†

Next came the Fish Tikka. Kolkata Bekti chunks marinated in standard masala and tandoored- ok-ish, nothing special. And, the next item was Jhinga Dum Nisha. We touched the prawn with fork and it came off- not because of its tenderness, but staleness. Probably, the prawn was marinated a week back and its good days were over. Stale prawns in a restaurant of such a stature, is it real ? Sadly, it was. We called the steward. He listened to us patiently, called the head chef, he listened to us patiently and we asked to cancel the prawn dish. We were given a reply that it can‚Äôt be cancelled as its served but can be redone and replenished on a chargable basis. We had no other option and went for it. A good 30 minuted went by. The next set that came was probably marinated 2-3 days back and didn‚Äôt fall of the fork. Not the freshest prawns but ok ok-type. 

‚ÄúWaiter, can we have water please ? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ‚Äú

Next, was Mutton Biryani. It was just heavenly. The rice, the meat, the aroma- every damn thing was perfect and heavenly. Agony regarding the prawn was gone by it. The quantity per portion was little less, but ok- who goes to ITC to gorge on food ? Others are there- na ? 

‚ÄúWaiter, can we have water please ? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ‚Äú¬†

Final dish was Shahi Tukra. And it frankly was a disaster and how we wished we didn‚Äôt order anything after that heavenly Biryani. Smallest portion I‚Äôve ever seen for Rs. 450/- . Probably, they‚Äôve run out of it and sold us the leftovers. ¬†

As the experience was not so good and it was apparent from our faces, AND it was my sister‚Äôs marriage anniversary, they gave us a slice of a cake as complementary.It was good. A biiiig slice- but a slice ? Probably they could‚Äôve given a small full cake or chose not to give it at all- but a slice ?¬†

‚ÄúWaiter, can we have water please ? ‚Ä¶..‚Äù

Overall verdict:

A definitely must-visit-place if you can afford it (21K for 7 adults and one 4 year kid), but but but order only Biryani (1 portion per head) and that‚Äôs it. If you crave for Kebabs, probably you should not venture beyond Kakori Kebab (they make it really nice). And DO NOT order for dessert (especially if its past 1030 PM- else the portion size may decrease)‚Ä¶.. And do not expect water to be filled up when its over, the water tumbler is nice though.

One of the biggest issue with the restaurant chains is that the branches always get compared to the main restaurant but are mostly not able to live up to the standards. Such is the case with the Dum Pukht in Kolkata as well. As a standalone eatery, the place is quite good, but if one compares them with the Maurya then it does fall short.
Awadhi is a cuisine that is not that common and thankfully gives you more options than the Shahi, Kadhai, Lababdaar versions of Paneer! The Biryani and Saalan is highly recommended and seems to be the specialty in vegetarian atleast. Was disappointed by the Dal Makhani and even the breads.¬†
The service is good, the staff is courteous, helpful and does try and cater / suggest as per your taste. The ambience is very average. They should have maintained the ambience like in Maurya.. it gives a very royal feel. Here it felt like any other restaurant. Still.. a decent experience at the end of the day :-)

The ambiance was as usual good, the service team was very comforting specially Mr. Akhtar who was extremely cordial. Well we ordered Shorba timatar & some think with Lamb, Timatar was good but Lamb was somewhat clear soup with too little tiny balls of lamb (4 No.s If I'm not wrong) , The veg Kebab was really good but the murg kebab was somewhat average.
The laccha Parantha and the Rotis that we ordered was small in size but cooked over charcoal so had the dehati flavour and was different in taste.
In the Main course we ordered Mahi curry (ROHU FISH Curry), kali daal & biriyani, I'm sorry to say ,but the Mahi Curry was too disappointing because of its taste and the curry itself was very normal. The Dum Pukht Biriyani was the only dish we liked because of its aroma & I would recommend if anyone is a dieheart fan of Biriyani then he/she must give a try.
We ordered vermicelli with ice cream & Gulab Kheer as desserts, the most disappointing part is its quantity and its was nothing special as compared to a city which is famous for its desserts and sweets. In a Nut shell, the quality of the spices and the ingredients were excellent but the quantity was too little as compared to the price they charged, for example, desserts were priced at 445 + taxes but the quantity was too little, rest of the items were also premium in price but again the quantity and the taste was of nothing great except the Biriyani.

Sister establishment of its namesake at the Maurya in Delhi, this is possible the premier and exclusive restaurant in the city. While the food is excellent and the service is fabulous, some of the prices are a bit overboard. Probably why the Peshawri in the same establishment is a lot more popular that this place.

The food here is simply amazing. North Indian moghlai at it's best. The kebabs are mouthwatering. Perfect texture and the right balance of flavor. Their pita bread is the best I've ever had. Do try their kakori and galautti kebabs. And dare not leave without trying their awesome biriyani. The mildly decorations and lighting gives a perfect ambience.

My first time to this place has been really memorable and indeed I was present during the opening day of the grand event 'Dawat-e-Biranj'.
Well this event stressed mostly on Mughlai food and it showcased an awesome display of 12 types of Biryanis.
Before I talk about the event and all of the food I had gobbled,I would like to describe the beauty of this place.

Dum Pukht is basically a small restaurant inside the palatial city hotel ITC Sonar Bangla,situated off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.
The layout of the tables and interior decor is something that is worth talking about.Even the spoon and fork designs show elegance in curtilery craftsmanship.

Now for the food....on this particular day I had tasted various Biryanis.It is literally impossible to remember all the names and what were the exact spices mixed,but here are a few that I can recall.
The Metiabruz Murgh Biryani was one such speciality which derives its name from a locality in Kolkata.This biryani is served with Chicken,potato and two eggs;and spiced up with dried apricots.
Cheemen Biryani was the next on my list and this speciality hailes all the way from Kerala.This Biryani is the Keralite version of Prawn Biryani served in Kolkata.
Lastly I tasted the Biryani which is a speciality of this restaurant and goes by the name of Dum Pukht Gosht.In one word it really gives your taste buds a royal treat.Comes with lamb and rice flavoured with green cardamom and mace,and is indeed the chief's masterpiece.Thank God I didn't miss this one.
After so much of Biryani I rushed for the sweet rosogollas to give a grand finish to my royal treat.Although the desserts section looked pretty handsome,but owing to a full stomach I had to give up this one.

This grandeur taste of the Biryanis enhanced my knowledge on food a lot.I would take this opportunity to thank the entire ITC Sonar Bangla Management Team who have come forward to make this event a success.
Would be really good for me and other foodies if this event is held every year.

A classic, stuck in a time warp. Decor and music stuck in the mid 80s (think instrumental Bollywood Muzak)- stuffy and very slow service....

But this place still deserves a 4 for the sheer quality of the food- delicious, ghee soaked goodness. 

Has the potential to become quite an institution if they update the decor and brush up on the service...regardless, would definitely come back.

Sometimes you are in a mood to spend a lot and get a hearty meal which is fulfilling to your senses, then Dum Pukht needs to be on your radar. Food served here is North Indian . They use to have a Flexible Menu but now they have a Fixed Menu .
Despite , that the food they have to offer you is Yummy!!. They serve North Indian .
 All the dishes from appetizers to main course is amazing. Food they serve here is truly sumptuous to be honest.
Going to a five star hotel , you should not think about how much you spend rather enjoy eating .
The dal makhani as well the mixed veg don't remember the name was amazing. The breads offered have enough variety to fit everyone's choice. The desserts are  exotic with a tinge of royalty to it.
Now the ambiance should never  be a problem in case of a Five star, its  decorated luxuriously  . Service was also good with friendly staff.
Now does it worth your precious money, I must say for those who can  afford it surely does worth your money and for those who cant no need to feel miserable  check my previous reviews and go with any of them with a  high rating!!

A recent sojourn to Dum Pukht had me raving about the place. What added as a bonus to that culinary experience was Masterchef Imtiaz Qureshi's personal touch with which he crafted the menu. Marinated in a thick date sauce and embellished with walnuts and almonds the raan-e-huzoor was a universal favourite. The jhinga qureshi,  which had jumbo prawns, dried apricots and cheese filling rolled and covered by puff pastry was impeccable, both in concept and execution. The dal badami bowled me over with its subtle balance of flavours. The koh-e-awadh was a Chef's specialty. Rarely have I had meat that is so soft, tender and juicy. The dudhiya biriyani, pristine white in colour, studded with tender lamb morsels, was less of food and more of an experience. This was the only item in the menu that I had to take a second helping of, and I totally didn't mind the extra calories that were coming free with it. The garlic-infused raita that went with it brought a sudden burst of refreshment into the meal. The fare ended with Shahi Tukda and Lab-e Mashooq.

A recent brush with the legendary Imtiaz Qureshi led me to Dum Pukht, and I sampled a few of the dishes specially constructed by the man himself. The meal was extensive, and out of the dishes I consumed, the ones that stood out included the Raan-e-Huzoor, tender chunks of shank meat that melted in my mouth, Jheenga Qureshi, where beautiful prawns were covered with a light, flaky pastry and baked, Koh-e-Avadh - mutton cooked with ginger and spices, and a Dudhiya Biryani - white, fluffy, and absolutely divine with chunks of mutton in it. 

Update: just had dinner at dum pukht last night. The stunning mutton biryani and melt-in-your-mouth kakori kabab was fantastic.

You need a very special place to celebrate a special occasion, and when the service is excellent and the food is utterly delectable it becomes a memorable experience. I last visited Dum Pukht before Zomato was born. Today to celebrate a special occasion we visited Dum Pukht for dinner. For starters we ordered the Kakori Kebab (Served with Sheermal) and Mirch Kebab (Veg). These were accompanied by a quirky but delicious invention the Mango Martini. For the Main Course we ordered Daal Bukhara, Murg Khushk Purdah and a layered Ajwain flavoured Naan. At the end of it we had no place for desserts, but we took a small bite of a 3 layered cake (sponge, mousse and crumbs) accompanied by a live violin recital to celebrate our special occasion.

Special Mentions:

1. Service - Excellent service, very attentive and caring without being intrusive. Full marks.
2. Dum Pukht Kakori Kebab - If you are not sitting at a Dastarkhwan of a Nawab in Lucknow, this is by far the best Kakori Kebab anywhere! And the Sheermal just adds to the sheer gastronomic pleasure!
3. Murgh Khush Purdah - My wife suggested I try this even though they said it would take 45 minutes to prepare it. And it was worth it. Every bite of the succulent chicken with the 'Purdah' a think layer of Puff pastry was delicious!

Con:

Just the one - I asked for Daal Bukhara (which they could have got from the neighbouring Peshawri, but didn't), instead they served me a rather bland Kaali Daal. That was the only Con I could think of in the evening's experience. I guess I should have ordered Daal Dum Pukht instead!

Overall a sublime experience and I am grateful to my friends connoisseurs and Big Foodies of the "Kolkata Food Fanatics" group who suggested that I choose Dum Pukth for our dinner tonight.

The most amazing kakori kebabs you can ever have! The nihari gives Sufia stiff competition. The food is amazing. Bring anyone who thinks they know their Mughalai food and trust me, you will bowl them over with this restaurant. No item on the menu is not worth trying. Thumbs up for everything they serve up.

Dum pukht is the ultimate place to go for the best north Indian in the city. It makes my mouth water when i think of the food there. ( Yeah, seriously! ) 
I went to Dum pukht to celebrate my brother's anniversary. We reached there pretty late yet they agreed to take our order which was really of them. 
The ambiance was great and the waiters were really good ( Yes!). The food that we ordered was absolutely delicious. It was the best north Indian that I have ever had in Kolkata. You absloutely have to try the Dal tarka there. It was different and good. 
Overall Dum pukht was a great experience and I am absolutely looking forward to visiting this place again. 

FOOD- 5/5
AMBIANCE -4/5
WAITERS- 4.5/5

I HAVE to begin by saying that ITC gives you the opportunity to taste the most divine black lentils ever!! (also called the Dal Bukhara at other ITC properties) .. Since I am a vegetarian (and 'cuz no one else ordered any meat or poultry item), I wouldn't be able to comment on the non- veg food selection.. The paneer cooked in fresh tomato and cream gravy is another delicious wonder which will elevate your culinary experience..The biryani was very flavorful and so were the different varieties of breads which we ordered alongside..Definitely one of the best meals when it comes to Indian cuisine!
PS: I was totally floored by the tableware- everything from the beautiful fleur-de-lis cutlery to the red crystal glassware was tastefully selected..

The Dum Pukht at ITC Sonar is one of my all time favourites - the food is just heavenly. The kebabs are absolutely fab - the Gilafi Sheekh kebab being outstanding. The biryani (both chicken and mutton) are very well prepared.

The service and behavior of the staff is as always impeccable, as is the standard of ITC. Will always recommend.

I am sure to visit soon and one thing that will be on the ordered menu will be the RAAN.

Although expensive but Dum Pukth definitely serves the most delicious biryani in town. The rosewater, ghee and saffron aromas of the biryani are really inviting. Also their kebabs are extremely tender and sumptuous. However I found the lamb and prawn kebabs more appetizing than the chicken kebabs. Also ask the sommelier's suggestions for wine pairing with the kebabs. The parathas are always soft and moist.  Personally, I thought the decor was fantastic but on two or three of the few occasions that I have been there on weeknights I have found the ambience to be a bit noisy, which is also the case at Eden Pavillion. Desserts from the royal kitchens of Awadh are also worth sampling.

The Dum-Pukht serves excellent Awadhi Cuisine ... some of the best in Kolkata .... both the ambience and service are pretty good and the overall experience makes for a delightful evening out. I love my biryani and kebabs and that is pretty much what I order there .... don't miss out on the superb Mutton Kakori Kebab served with the delicious little Tawa Parathas ... delicate and delicious , if you prefer Chicken then sample the Murg Makhmali Kebab which is succulent and tender. For our mains we ordered but of course the Mutton Dum Biryani which was amazing ..... every single grain of rice was soaked in all the wonderful flavours and the mutton inside perfectly cooked. Simply writing this review makes my mouth water when I recall the delicious flavours !

Couple of things before I come to the food. I have been here twice. Earlier, back in 2010 and recently last week. Firstly the ambience seemed a little poorer. There has been an instance where a person shouted at a waiter to catch his attention. I reckon, you'll find such people everywhere now regardless of the restaurant class. There has also been a drastic change in price. Well, this is usual, we have to expect these things from such star restaurants. Cant be helped. 

Now, not much to say about the food here. They have been very consistent with their standards. My friends who came along with me, had biryani and reportedly it was outstanding! I had other Indian dishes; food tasted really good! I was also very pleased with their hospitality. In fact this is something which I feel has improved since my last visit. Their service itself sets its mark for 3.5 stars.

 Overall, taking the good food into account, I am rating it '4.5'. I again look forward to dine here as soon as my wallet gets refilled! If you have money, don't ever hesitate in visiting here. You'll love it!

Yesterday went to this place for the first time... Experience was Awestruck.. It was my mother's birthday and had prior reservation for table...

First thing: Being a vegetarian and that too Jain, cuisine options become less.. But the staff being courteous, well knowledge helped us in giving a memorable experience...

Each and every dish they suggested us was prepared to Jain which had great taste but also well presented...

Kababs were prepared Jain and they were excellent.... 

Got a complimentary Chocolate Moouse Cake from the Hotel... 

The staff is excellent in the knowledge as well as behavior.. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice with dim lights and silver cutlery with red candle stand glasses which is also a plus point..

The only thing they lack is the variety of deserts... Only 5 options available.. 

Be rest assured.,. You going for a royal treatment with excellent menu, par beyond excellence service ambiance and experience...

This is my favourite restaurant at ITC Sonar.the kakori kebabs are out of the world. If you plan your dinner in advance please do call up a day or two earlier, and if the chef agrees he will serve you the best Galauti kebab you will ever get. The shahi Tukra is my favourite dessert there. I love the attention they pay to each diner is amazing. I simply LOVE it

In a nutshell:

A memorable experience in a 5 Star Restaurant with excellent food, good service, good ambience & of course 5 star prices.

Short Description - in case u r in a hurry:

My first experience of Dum Pukth was at ITC Maurya Sheraton many years back & it was fabulous. The amazing interiors, the elderly & knowledgeable staff, the grandeur, the opulence, the cutlery - almost everything had impressed me & of course the food. I have always found this to be much better than the over-hyped Bukhara (in the same hotel). Have eaten at Dum pukth few more times & experience has been similar. 

Last month we went to Dum Pukth Kolkata & found the experience to be quite different. The staff members were modern day young Hotel Management Graduates, the grandeur was not at all comparable, the 'Royal' feel of the Delhi restaurant was missing, the interiors were much darker than the Delhi one & that is one of the reasons I am unable to share great pics with u - it was too dark for even a good camera to get good pics. 

We were a group of 6 people & hence had the opportunity to share the food & taste many different items on the menu. 

The menu card was pretty long & it had detailed & very well worded description of the food. Looked to be work of a good marketing agency.

Food was excellent in most cases with a few exceptions in which they were 'good' but short of being 'great'. A great place for taking ur expat colleagues, friends, a date (with a foodie), to celebrate with family etc.

Detailed Description - In case u have the Time to NJOY reading:

We started our evening with Himayati Shorba Rehmani - It was a Lamb extract flavored with coriander, clove & cardamom, laced with yoghurt & spiced with yellow chilli. Not very thick, not very thin, this shorba (soup) had a very good spiced flavor to it while not being over bearing. It was pleasing to the senses yet far from being bland. It had a character of its own. I rate this 4/5.

For starters we had a vegetarian dish - Dudhiyan Kabab. It was Roundels of cottage cheese stuffed with spiced mashed potato, shallow fried & finished on the dum. Super soft outer layer that had a mild charred effect, with a spiced up mid layer that tasted very good. The dum effect was not that evident but it came out to be an outstanding dish as well. I rate this 4/5 again.

Then came the famous Kakori kabab - minced meat spiced up ,wrapped around an iron rod & sigri grilled. Awesome is the word. Intense, jaw dropping, flavorful, fabulously tasty & perfect texture - it made us speechless for few moments. We were looking into each other's faces & expression. This gets a straight 5/5.

Next dish we had was Jhinga dum nisha - Jumbo prawns marinated in hung curd & spices, served with a saffron flavored seafood chutney. The prawns were juicy to a certain extent & surely very soft. Taste was very good & so were the flavors. Loved this as well. I wud rate this at 4.5/5. Seafood chutney was very enjoyable as well.

For main course we had Mahi Kaalia dum pukth. It was marbles of rohu fish cooked in mustard oil gravy enhanced with fenugreek seeds, soaked in lemon juice, served with garnishing of juliennes of ginger & freshly chopped coriander leaves. This was good but just did not match up to the standards of Dum pukth. The fish balls were good to taste but I have surely had better. The gravy was good but pretty plain Jane as compared to the other items we had here. I wud give this a 3.5/5.
 
Dum Pukth Koh e Awadh. This was 'Chef's recipe for Korma of elegant exposed lamb shacks dum cooked in its own juices & juices of the bone marrow , tinged with cardamom' as per the menu card. Loved this dish. Succulent pieces of lamb that fall off froom bones at the slightest provocation, yet not too soft to the extent of losing texture. The gravy was intense but refined. I give this a 4.5/5.

The second last dish for the evening Raan e Dum pukth. It was Raan of goat marinated in dark rum, stuffed with onions, pickled garlic, sealed with flour, cooked on dum. When served, it looked like an European pie. The outer flour layer was layery, not khasta but mildly crispy on the top & soft within. 

As we broke in the layer, the meats popped out from the center. Dry, spicy, not that hot, robust taste, pickled effect. Just too good - with the layer as well as without the layer. I rate this at 4.9/5.

The last dish was obviously Gosth Dum Biryani. It had long aromatic grains of rice that were independent but melt in the mouth. The rice had infused the flavors of the spices, the meat & course its own. The meat was again super soft  & very tasty. Loved it beyond words. I rate this a 4.9/5 again.

The last dish was Muzaffar - it is a semia (vermicelli) based dry sweet dish. The last time we had this at Dum Pukth Delhi, we were floored. At Sonar, it was good but nowhere near the greatness of the Delhi one. Dry vermicelli sweetened, with loads of dry fruit & flavors. I rate this a 3.5/5

The rating of food at Dum Pukth averages out to 4.3/5.

I wud keep going back here to benchmark my taste - maybe once a year / once in 2 years.

I celebrated a romantic evening at dum pukht. Firstly, ITC Sonar is a fabulous hotel.The ambiance is luxurious and chic. Dum Phukt is my favorite restaurant at ITC Sonar.The food was good though I'm not that into Indian cuisine. Paradise for north Indian cuisine lovers.We tried their Kebabs,bread and kheer for dessert.Greats drinks and traditional Indian desserts. They also got us a complimentary cake and flowers to celebrate that evening. Servers were very warm and courteous.
Definitely recommend to all the foodies :)
Life is a beautiful journey..Live it well..

Riya.

Not really meant for vegetarians. Very limited veg choices. If one eliminates brinjal, cauliflower and mushroom you are left with only one paneer, one sweet kofta and one stuffed aloo option. Dal makhani is good, though. Good choices for breads also. 
Need to work on soups too (only one option of tomato soup for veggies). The starters were alright. We like the dudhiya kebabs in their appetiser spread. 
The serving staff is very friendly and proactive in suggesting options. Good ambiance.

DUM PUKHT  needs no introduction.. They serve the best Indian food in the whole world in terms of quality and taste...the ambiance is good and the staff is extremely courteous and helpful..
The best kebab is the kakori kebab which simply melts in your mouth along with the shirmal..once u get taste the kakori kebab here you are not going to try it else where because they cannot match this standard.and another kebab u shouldnot miss is the Murg Makhmali kebab. the biriyani is to die for..the taste is subtle and its light cooked in pure dum style and u get the flavour in every spoon..very light for the stomach.. last year we had some guests from USA , they also claimed that the Biriyani is the best in the whole world..the list goes on from naan to kebabs to lentils to the main course like mutton roganjosh,etc everything is just excellent..not to miss the desert section firni and shahi turdka again the best in the whole world..i can spend days eating their food and i know i will never get bored of them and can go on and on...

We visited the restaurant last week for a family dinner. The decor is simple but graceful with a view of the live kitchen. The food was a mixed experience. The kababs are very good. Try the Mutton kakori kababs served with the small tawa parathas , they are just fantastic. Also the Fish kabab was also nice. The dum biryani has a very subtle taste, quite different than the regular Awadhi biryani served in other places. The mirchi ka salan goes very well with the biryani. The Raita served with it was also very nice.

When it is in an ITC hotel, do we even need to tell how amazing this restaurant is....Dum Pukht is probably the best Awadhi cuisine i have tasted in Kolkata. We went for basic stuff, Kebabs (Mutton kakori kebab, dahi murg kebab) a mutton side dish, an amazing biriyani and different varieties of naan and tandoori rotis. The kebabs were succulent and so soft that they actually do  melt in your mouth and they are served with mini parathas which are so light and so aromatic that it makes u salivate. The mutton gravy dish was light and mild with an aroma that can make u dizzy, the mutton pieces were chunky but so juicy that you would keep on licking your fingers after having it.The Biriyani, was as best as it can get, light but it hits you at the right spot, its like a cupid's arrow, I can keep on writing a long essay on how good the food was, and how perfect the decor and ambience was, but it is to be felt and cant really be described in words. Ofcourse it is an exorbitantly priced restaurant, but its an ITC restaurant, if you are ready to spend, they wont let you down....

This is definitely the place for all biryani lovers. It also offers a variety of mouth watering kebabs. Attractive interiors with the open kitchen catching all eyes. Dum pukht has maintained its 5 star status with good quality and service.

Its a place worth going. 

Do not waste time on trying everything on the menu. Focus should be on kakori kebab, dum pukht biryani and nalli nehari. For all biryani lovers, this is the place you should definitely try out.

The open kitchen adds to the brilliantly done interior. Extremely warm behaviour of the staff and soothing music makes this place ideal for a family get together.
