This is not a proper restaurant,. but a street side roll and fast food stall. As there are not much roll stalls around, the place remains pretty crowded. But everything tasted below average. 

The egg roll paratha was undercooked and it was stuffed only with onions. Not at all worth the Rs. 25 it costs. The fish fries had almost no fish inside, but were made thick with layers of onions only. At Rs. 35 each I was not expecting a fat fillet of fish, but atleast the masala stuffing could have been tasty. But here it was plain onions and nothing else.Â  We do not expect quality ingredients in stalls like these, but atleast the food must be tasty. Avoid.
