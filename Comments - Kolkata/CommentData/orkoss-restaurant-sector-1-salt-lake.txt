Orkos has been around the city for quite some time now and it has been known for all the good reasons. I visited the restaurant as well as the lounge bar which is situated in Salt Lake city center. The Restaurant has a setting capacity of around 40 people and the lounge adjoned to it has a sitting capacity of around 15-20 people. The whole restuatant is in an oval structure so one is able to view every inch and corner of the restaurant when the person enters. in the middle there is a private kind of  a  space with ambient light filling up the space. behind while the is a long vertical sitting space.
                                                                ...

well decorated, well maintained place .. good hospitality ... services time is pretty fast ..  
prawn salt n pepper : 5/5
mixed gravy noodles: 5/5
chicken Manchurian: 5/5 
the prices are in the higher side. .  another issue is that the waiters are not well aware about the availability of food items .. there is room for improvement

Orko’s is probably one of the most oldest bar cum restaurant of City Centre and its still stable in the same place. Located on the 3rd floor of E Block in CC1, this place is available for family function, birthday party, office party or even casual lunch.

This place isn’t very big but every bit of this place is well utilised to fit maximum people comfortably. Sittings are comfortable and ambiance is quite nice with decorative wall & celling lights. Buffet is spread a side of the dining.

Their Mocktail and Cocktails served with Cristal LED Ice Cube looked very cool. Other than that below items were available in Sunday buffet options…

Salt & Pepper Corn : Nice and crispy salted corn with sprinkle of pepper.
Fish in Honey Sauce : Fish tossed into sweet and tangy sauce, this one tasted really good.
Veg Shami kebab : Small veg fried patty with green veggies inside.
Tandoori Chicken : Nicely grilled small Tandoori Chicken pieces, unfortunately with bones.
Chicken Biryani : This Biryani looked very nice.
Chicken Do Piyaza : Chicken in rich gravy.
Fish Amritsari Masala : Fish pieces in red hot thick spicy gravy, well shuttled with rice & naan.
Paneer Butter Masala : Makhmali paneer in red spicy gravy, again fitted with naan.

Personally I found this buffet to be bit expensive comparatively at Rs.750. If you’re looking for a space to through a small party then Orko’s is one of the popular place to choose from.

This restaurant is a known name, among people, and has been there for a long time. Located in 3rd floor e block of city centre, this place offers their space for family functions, and also for casual lunch. It accomodates around 50-60 people. So we had the sunday buffet lunch priced at Rs750. 
It consisted of Crispy Chilli Corn, Veg Shami Kebab, Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Do pyaza,Naan, Fish Amritsari, Paneer Butter Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Gulab Jamun and Vanilla Ice Cream. The food was of good quality, and is a safe menu if you are wanting to try out birthday parties or anniversaries. We were also served with some 3d lighting cocktails, which were good.

Orko'ss is operational in Kolkata for 10 years now and is a famous place among kolkatans.
Located very conveniently in City centre 1  Block-E,3 rd floor,this place is really amazing.
They have two separate dine in areas one is the lounge which is spacious and can accommodate 50-60 people at a time and another is their bar which is comparatively small but popular among people who loves loud music and thrilling atmosphere.

Now coming to the food we tasted.
We took their Sunday buffet which is priced around 750.

MENU-
1.Chicken biriyani-Fragrant rice slow cooked with marinated chicken pieces.
2.Chicken do pyaza-Chicken cubes cooked with onions,capsicum in an indian style gravy.I felt that it was a bit bland in taste.
3.Fish amritsari-Deep fried fish pieces cooked with assorted spices and condiments.Taste nice.
4.Paneer butter masala-Paneer or cottage cheese cooked in buttery gravy and garnished with fresh cream.
5.Crispy chilli corn-Corn kernels coated with flour and tossed with finely chopped onions and spring onions.The corn was crispy and tasted delicious.
6.Tandoori chicken-Marinated chicken chunks charred with coal. It was totally cold but on request they re heated it but the chicken was a bit hard and chewy.
7.Veg shami kabab-Small round shaped kababs made it mashed vegetables.The kabab was flavourful and yum.
8.Naan

For desserts we had Gulab jamun and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.
Gulab jamun was hot and had a soft texture.

We were also served with mutiple mocktails inlcuding 3d Lighting one .

The staff was helpful and courteous and we had a great time here.
All in all a great place to hang out and try delicious items.

Located in one the most happening malls in Kolkata, Orko'ss is a charmer in terms of location as well as food and hospitality. The ambience is tranquil and cozy. I loved the aquarium as a piece of decor. Coming to the food, we tried their Sunday lunch buffet which is priced at around 750 rupees. The spread consisted of a number of Indian delicacies among which the following deserve a special mention.
•Chicken biryani
•Chicken do piyaza
•Fish amritsari masala
•Paneer butter masala
•Crispy chilli baby corn
•Veg Shami kebab
•Tandoori Chicken
For dessert, there was Hot Gulab Jamun with Vanilla Ice cream and choice of your sauce. Along with all this food, we had some lovely 3D cocktails which I  thought was a really innovative concept. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience with the delicious food, lovely ambience and courteous service.

Scoff with avidity!

Any bidding is always tantalizing, and if it's for cuisines then God may bless your breadbasket. And being a barbarous food venator, I did the same as described. Stuffed down every preparations they had presented. This time setting was on Orko's.

Ring-shaped eatery has ample space to cater for ton. Despite that diversification of food was more expected, nonetheless it had been fulfilled by their heterogeneity of drinks which included multiple mocktails and cocktails together with a 3D lighting one.

Besides edibles were vegetable Shami Kebab, which was soft to consume as made up of a combination of mix vegetables and nuts, served as tikki; Tandoor aloo, where small sized potatoes were gracefully baked in clay oven and it tasted delicious. Tandoori Murgh, served cold at first later fresh preparations were obtainable. It was a platter of tender spring chicken marinated in spiced curd and delicately cooked in clay oven; Crispy chilly fish, best in all where pan simmered fish fillets were tossed with chopped onions, ginger, garlic and green chillies. However, served once and wasn't repeated after also being craved for.

Furthermore in main course options were Paneer Butter Masala, a delish ashet where cubes of paneer cooked with rich and spicy onion gravy; Chicken do piyaza, where pieces of chicken were good in rich gravy of spices and onion. Pleasant to taste that. Besides, Machli Amritsari Masala where Bhetki fillets were fried in North Indian style with onion and tomato gravy, also was delightful to gulp it down. Moreover, Murgh Dum Biryani was alluring and Vegetable Polao was appetizing. As well, in dessert section, there were hot served gulab jamun and ice cream with sauce of your choice.

The entirety was fetching though expected additional aid and varities. Will anticipate, they will harmonize it soon. Nevertheless, it costed 750 bucks. Long way to go.

Our team of Munching Monks was invited for a food tasting at Orko'ss, this generously sized restaurant on the 3rd floor of E-block, City Center 1. We were invited for the Sunday lunch buffet which is priced at INR 750. We witnessed the birthday party of a 3 year old prior to our event which looked like a lot of fun. Our menu mostly comprised of Indian dishes accompanied by a swirling number of mocktails. The food tasted good but for the fact that most of it was cold due to the busy-ness from the birthday party before it. On our menu was: 
An assortment of mocktails including the 3D mocktail
Vanilla IceCream with Cherry sauce

American Salt and Pepper: This was probably the best of all the dishes
Veg Shammi Kebab: This was over before I could reach it
Chilli Fish: This genuinely tasted good. The fish was succulent and perfectly seasoned
Chicken Tandoori: They tasted good, the meat was well cooked. But they were not boneless which is a major disappointment. I needed to pick bones from my mouth constantly

Chicken Biriyani: Could not eat it because it was cold when I reached it. But from the others who did, it tasted pretty good.
Paneer Butter Masala: The taste was inviting but the paneer pieces were too small and dry
Fish Amritsari Masala: This dish was delectable, and took away all our complaints from before! 
Chicken Do-Piyaza: Tasted more like the normal chicken curry. The taste was quite well if you don't consider the name of the dish

Hot Gulab Jamun: This is a classic, and they were perfect. They were warm and dripping with juice and flavour.
Vanilla Ice cream with Hershey's chocolate syrup

3D Screwdriver

The place is good to have a friendly meet up or a lavish grand party, both. If you just ask them to turn down the high volumed music, you can enjoy a nice meal at a lovely decorated restaurant.

Orko'ss is located on the 3rd floor of the E block of City Center. It is a spacious restaurant with a small lounge. The Munching Monks team was recently invited to sample their goodies. We went for Sunday lunch and witnessed a toddler's birthday party in full swing. We had the lunch buffet which consisted of a number of items. The starters had salt and pepper corn, veg shammi kebab, chilli fish and chicken tandoori. We also got to sample some tandoori aloo. Although a non-vegetarian on principle, I rather enjoyed their veg starters, particularly the corn. The main course had tandoori roti, Amritsari fish, veg pulao and Chicken dopiyaza. The fish items- both in the starter as well as in the main course- were particularly tasty. The chicken was okay, but none of it was boneless, which was a bit of a let down. Dessert consisted of hot gulab jamuns and vanilla ice cream with Hershey's chocolate sauce. The gulab jamuns were great. You can also order ala carte at Orko'ss. They have a large variety of mocktails. They also serve alcoholic beverages. Priced at Rs 750, the buffet is a tad expensive, but the place is rather convenient for meeting friends and hosting small parties.

Located on the 3rd floor of the e building at cc1, ORKOS happens to be one of those hidden gems that take an extra bit to find! Literally! 
They have been in business for very many years now and recently have come up with a few new additions to the menu, especially the Mocktails.  
Branched out separately as a restaurant and bar lounge on the same floor,  this place serves quite a few good things!  

3D : was an Ice cream and syrup based drink.  3D is named so due to the dramatic effect of the ice cream melting it's way through the syrup. 

Blue lagoon: blue curacao and soda, simple and traditional! 

For all the Tea totalers 

Pinacolada : yeah! A Pinacolada on a winter evening,  a virgin version of the drink.  

Screw driver :yet another virgin version of the drink. 

Cosmopolitan : this had chocolate in it which was different ,again a virgin version!  

We also had the authentic cosmopolitan and it wasn't the best one I've had but wasn't worst either! 

Food:
 Dragon Phoenix soup : a spicy lemon grass infused soup, a really good Asian bowl of soup! 

Buddha jumps over the wall: this soup was very pretty looking,  a whipped egg cloud in top depicting the wall with a mellow soup under neath.  Look for the pictures!!  

Nam jo Kai : a chicken satay preparation with a sweet mint chutney on top . Delicious! 

Tandoori angare :another tasty starter of tandoor Cooked pieces of chicken. 

Biryani : very beautiful Cooked Biryani,  perfectly spiced with raita.  

Kadhai chicken : on the spicy side,  this was a chicken preparation to accompany the Biryani.  

Fried ice cream for dessert which was bomb! 

All in all,  a good experience.  Would surely recommend others for the Mocktails. The cocktail game could be stronger! 

Good job guys,  cheers!

Orko'ss is a name that needs no introduction. They have been here a long time and serving us delicious spread. It has both lounge and a bar. The lounge is really spacious and can fit in 50-60 people at a time with dim lighting and splendid décor. The bar is smaller compared to the lounge. 6-8 sofas are there and can accommodate up to 30-40 at a time. Loud Bollywood music play in the background.                      A couple of us friends visited them a few days ago. We were really impressed with the décor. 
On our menu was:
The Munching Monks were invited to sample some of the best dishes of Orko'ss and the afternoon couldn't be more grand. 

On our menu were-:

Mocktails:
●Mocktail Pina Colada- A Pineapple based beverage. I quite liked this one. 
●Mocktail Screwdriver- This one was punched with orange and lime. Couldn't have it more than a few sips. 
●3D- Blue Lagoon topped with ice-cream. The taste of the ice-cream overpowered every thing else. Still, I really enjoyed this one. 
●Blue Lagoon- It was a bit too strong for me. But quite refreshing.
●Mocktail Cosmopolitan- The best of the lot. Cranberry juice topped with chocolate. I loved this one. 
●Humpty Dumpty

Cocktails:
●Cosmopolitan- It was my first cocktail. So can't comment how authentic was this one. According to my friends, the alcohol content was low. But I found it nice enough. 

Food:
●Dragon Fonix Soup- The Soup was frothy on the top. Taste nice. I liked the bite of ginger that came with it. 
●Buddha Jumps Over the Wall-The warmth of this soup just overwhelms you. 
●Nam Jo Kai- It is a chicken satay strung in the thin stick. The chicken was delicious. And the peanuts just added to the taste. 
●Tandoori Angaar- One of the best dishes of the evening. Loved the flavour of it. The kababs was juicy and tender. 
●Chicken Biriyani- Really Light in flavour. It came with Raita. The chicken pieces were huge. But a bit dry. 
●Kadhai Chicken- One of my favourites of the evening. Loved the spicy tangy taste of it. The citrusy flavour of capsicums added the zing to it. 
●Sizzler- This was by far my favourite. It was piping hot. I found it difficult taking it in my mouth. But as I took it in, it felt so tender and moist. I was bowled over by it. 
●Orko'ss Special Veg Sizzler
●Jafrani Malai Kofta
●Butter Naan

Dessert:
●Fried Ice-cream- The outside was crunch and the inside like a proper ice-cream. My mouth got frozen trying to have this ice-cream.

The Munching Monks were invited to sample some of the best dishes of Orko'ss and the afternoon couldn't be more grand. 

On our menu were-:

Mocktails:
●Mocktail Pina Colada- A Pineapple based beverage. I quite liked this one. 
●Mocktail Screwdriver- This one was punched with orange and lime. Couldn't have it more than a few sips. 
●3D- Blue Lagoon topped with ice-cream. The taste of the ice-cream overpowered every thing else. Still, I really enjoyed this one. 
●Blue Lagoon- It was a bit too strong for me. But quite refreshing.
●Mocktail Cosmopolitan- The best of the lot. Cranberry juice topped with chocolate. I loved this one. 
●Humpty Dumpty

Cocktails:
●Cosmopolitan- It was my first cocktail. So can't comment how authentic was this one. According to my friends, the alcohol content was low. But I found it nice enough. 

Food:
●Dragon Fonix Soup- The Soup was frothy on the top. Taste nice. I liked the bite of ginger that came with it. 
●Buddha Jumps Over the Wall-The warmth of this soup just overwhelms you. 
●Nam Jo Kai- It is a chicken satay strung in the thin stick. The chicken was delicious. And the peanuts just added to the taste. 
●Tandoori Angaar- One of the best dishes of the evening. Loved the flavour of it. The kababs was juicy and tender. 
●Chicken Biriyani- Really Light in flavour. It came with Raita. The chicken pieces were huge. But a bit dry. 
●Kadhai Chicken- One of my favourites of the evening. Loved the spicy tangy taste of it. The citrusy flavour of capsicums added the zing to it. 
●Sizzler- This was by far my favourite. It was piping hot. I found it difficult taking it in my mouth. But as I took it in, it felt so tender and moist. I was bowled over by it. 
●Orko'ss Special Veg Sizzler
●Jafrani Malai Kofta
●Butter Naan

Dessert:
●Fried Ice-cream- The outside was crunch and the inside like a proper ice-cream. My mouth got frozen trying to have this ice-cream.

A nice place to hang out with your friends and family.
They have a nice range of mouth watering starters and main courses starting from indian,continental,mughlai. They even serve alcoholic beverages. The prices of the beverages are on a higher notch.
The ambience out here is quite rocking.
Love the place for hangout.

Excellent ambience and Great Food. So many new completely new items and unmatched taste. Must try Indian here. So much variety and great taste. Pulao with Patiala Chicken is a must try. Also among their Chinese items I loved their Hunan Fish.

A buffet restaurant that won't serve unless there are at least 10 people in your party and would insult you by offering a "discount" on the à la carte!! Not going here again!

10 years of Orko's!Orko's is a renowned name in the food & beverage scene of kolkata. Having visited its kasba outlet years back, i was tempted to give the salt lake branch a visit too. It houses a restaurant and a bar separately, one beside the other, to manage the ambience better. 
● Location: E block, 3rd floor, City centre 1.● Ambience: the main restaurant is quite spacious; can accommodate 50-60 people approx; has a nice decor; dimly lit; comfy seating arrangements. While the bar isn't too big. It's a tiny bar lounge, playing loud bollywood music, having a low light and comfy sofas to lounge into.● Beverages: ◆ Mocktails:* Pinacolada: pineapple based Mocktail.* 3D: * Mocktail cosmopolitan: Cranberry juice topped off with some chocolate syrup. This one is Recommended!* Mocktail screwdriver: Orange & lemon juice punched mocktail. * Blue Lagoon: blue curacao based mocktail.* Humpty Dumpty:The mocktails couldn't really win over my heart.◆ Cocktail:* Cosmopolitan: Vodka punched with Cranberry juice. Wasn't the best i've had till date.● Food: * Dragon Fonix Soup: frothy soup. Smooth on the palate. Ideal for a chilly wintery afternoon.* Buddha jumps over the wall: a little spicy soup.* Nam jo kai: a chicken satay. * Tandoori Angaar: boneless tender succulent chicken pieces grilled on smoky charcoal tandoor. RECOMMENDED!* Chicken Biryani: a lighter version of the oily Biryanis that we get everywhere. the best part was it clearly had no dalda/ vanaspati as it didn't turn hard, whitish or greasy even when the rice cooled off. Recommended!* Kadhai Chicken: a little on the Spicer & tangier side. I thoroughly enjoyed. Recommended!* Orko's special veg sizzler: it had a well prepared rice, some paneer kebabs and some stir fried veggies.* Jafrani malai kofta: Paneer balls cooked in cashew nut & cream gravy. Sweet in taste. It would have been better if the koftas were a bit softer.* Butter naan
● Dessert:* fried icecream: Vanilla ice cream scoop coated with desiccated coconut and fried to perfection. Must try!
Enjoyed my meal. Would definitely recommend this place.

Very few restaurant chains afford to have both – a decent restaurant as well as a good lounge – and Orko’s is amongst those few. While you can check into their restaurant for a fine dining experience, you can also storm into their lounge and enjoy hardcore music, ambience and a few drinks, of course.

Fine dining experience at not so high prices is what defines Orko’s, based out of City Center, Saltlake, Block E – 3rd floor, with their counterparts being based out in Kasba! Size of the place is huge, and presumably accommodates 50-odd heads, with the centre portion providing round table seating arrangements! We, a group of 7 friends walked into this place and had the following:-

(i)	Orkoss Special Veg Sizzler – A 5-in-1 sizzler - Fried rice with coriander toppings served with French fries, paneer tikka kebabs, aloo patty topped with tangy sauce, a dollop of cheese as well as sautéed vegetables! This was the only dish amongst all I had, which tickled my taste buds! This was simply the pick of the sizzlers range they offer! It is a complete meal in itself and 1 portion can satiate the hunger of 1 person!

(ii)	Zafrani Malai Kofta – Small to medium sized but of uneven shapes and sizes, these were pretty much a let-down. The sweet dry fruit gravy failed to impress either! Presentation with grated cheese topping and butter however, did impress!

(iii)	Raita - Tasty

(iv)	Butter Naan – Atta based, aptly thin - well prepared!

(v)	Onion salad

(vi)	Fried Ice cream – Breaded scoop of ice creams quickly deep fried, however, fell below expectations, as the fried layers did not quite stick to the scoops! They almost could be peeled off.

(vii)	Blue lagoon – Great presentation, especially with the LED ice cube and the pineapple and cherry topping, but offset due to the excessive ice content, which overpowered its taste!

(viii)	3D – A 2-in-one ice cream scoop atop 3 distinctive layers of mocktail, high on presentation but low on taste!

(ix)	Pinacolada – Prepared in pineapple base, this one did not manage to tickle our taste buds!

(x)	Screwdriver (MOCKTAIL) – Seemed more like an average orange juice based drink!

(xi) Cosmopolitan (MOCKTAIL) – Cranberry juice based, with a chocolate layer topping, this was the pick of all the coolers we had. Literally, we the foodies were fighting for a sip or two of this!

Currently they are serving only a-la-carte but buffets can be served for a dine-in group of 30 or more, on request!

Quantity served is just moderate, and service is fine. Ambience is okayish, somewhat too dim! Overall, a fine experience!

I was searching for a good restaurent in zomato near/inside the City centre mall.I really thought it will be so good place to visit and the experience will be memorable.

This restaurent situated inside the City centre mall E block 3rd floor.The ambience of the restaurent is really good.

I checked on zomato that suggested item was Chicken Tai Pai(0/5).So I ordered that.It came to my table and I realised it's basically a useless something I ordered.The decoration wasn't good,the quantity wasn't good and the taste was also not good :/ over spiced chili.I don't have any idea why people order this item here.

After this weird experience I thought to experiment with the dessert first,then move to main course lol.So I oredered their Malpua.And when this order also came to my table I was highly dissapointed.They just played with the emotion of a bengali.I never ate such disgusting malpua before.The Chef should learn how to make it properly.They just added this item to their menu without even knowing it properly maybe.

At last yes,somehow the stuff behaviour was average.

When the food is not good,everything doesn't feel good.So,Orko's Restaurent just made my day bad :/ :/ I visited there with expectations.

Orko's is a very old place in Saltlake, running since 2003-04 - almost along the launch of Kolkata's first City Center Mall Plaza. They are celebrating Pan Asian Food Festival (4-30th of November) on lunch and dinner, and as a part of Team #MunchingMonks we were invited by Mr. Arnav. 

With the Pan Asian Food Festival, Orko's is offering authentic asian cuisines. The buffet offerings are priced at Rs 499 + tax (on weekdays) and Rs 599 + tax (on weekends) which I think quite competitive. 

Located at 3rd floor of Block E, CC1, this multi cuisine restaurant has two seperate part - one is for family and second one is the bar lounge. The dining house or the family section is vibrantly lit, and spreads over quite a large area. You can't miss the wooden furnitures and wall hangings. But the round table on the right corner definitely is for friends/family gettogether. 

The lounge is just beside it, quite dimly lit but the sofas are very cosy and would give you the fun with ambience. The bartender shows off his skills with fire while you may dance with the live DJ mixes.

Now coming to the food, Orko's had a management change very recently. The change is obvious on the food menu of Pan Asian Food Festival. Authentic Asian cuisines are actually not heavily spiced or full of sauce, but the perfect mix of spices and herbs with the main stock, which will definitely satisfy your tastebuds. I really like their Chinese or Asian dishes. 

The cocktails we had offered: 3D Mocktail, Ambush, Pinacolada, Humpty Dumpty, Ginger Lemon Cooler

The main course: Dragon Phoenix Soup, Nam Kathi Rice, Bihun Goreng, Vegetable Dumka, Clay Pot Chicken, Burmese Soup, Yam Woon Sezn, Nam Jo Kai

Desserts: Fired Ice Cream

Are you searching for real Asian buffet at best price? Orko's is the answer for you!

At 3rd floor of E block , in City Center 1 , is located this renowned multi-cuisine restaurant Orko'ss . In city there are many other food joints serving Chinese , Asian and Indian cuisine , but as we all know that many of them lacks that authenticity . 

Pan Asia festival is going on at Orko'ss which started on 4th of November and will go on till 30th . If you want to try the authentic taste of Asian delicacies then you must not waste your time thinking and just step into this restaurant with friends , family or colleague . I must say Asian food at its best . Not at all heavily spiced , but perfect mix of spices and very light in taste . 

Its very spacious , can accomodate almost arount 100 people at a time and its also available for party bookings . Interior is grand , with false cilling , perfect mix and match of lights and wooden sittings giving it a classy touch . At the extream corner of the restaurant there is the best table to have some private time with your gang . There is a round table which can accomodate around 8 people and dimly lit up with a vibrant red colour light .

Orko'ss is also having their lounge and bar section which is separated from the restaurant part with live DJ . Generally the have their buffet option which is Rs - 499/- + TAX ( on weekdays ) and 599/- + TAX ( on weekends ) .

Now coming to the food ..... Pan Asian Food Festival Dishes : 

{The dishes we had }

● Dragon Phoenix Soup : Dragon phoenix soup is a thick soup , almost similar to chicken clear soup , containing egg white and you just need to sprinkel some crushed black peeper and you are all set to go .

● Nam Kathi Rice : This is made with Miniket rice along with coconut crush which gives a fine smell and taste.

● Bihun Goreng : Thin rice noodles tossed in less oil along with chinese veggies diced chicken and egg . It is served with a pouched egg on top .
● Vegetable Dumka : The dish is made of bread crumble coating which is deep fried and crisp in taste and stuffed with smashed potato , beetroot and other veggies . Garnished with deep fried crispy noodles and chinese cabbage .
● Clay Pot Chicken : This is something innovative. Small pieces of chciken slices are cooked in low flame with coconut milk and chinese vegetables which gives a fine taste to the dish. This dish very healthy.

● Burmese Soup 
● Yam Woon Sezn

● Nam Jo Kai

● Fried Ice Cream

◆ Drinks (chef's special drinks) not included on Pan Asian Festival :

● 3D Mocktail

● Ambush

● Pinacolada

● Humpty Dumpty

● Ginger Lemon cooler

Thank you Mr. Arnab Chakraborty, for inviting Team Munching Monks . Looking forward to visit this place soon in near future .

Nostalgic…!! Recalling some good memories after being at this place after 9 long years. The place where I tried out my first beer of my life.. That time with my closest buddies and now with my big foodie group. We went there for special “Pan Asian Food Festival”. Basically Pan Asia food means the cuisine from across Asia. They are offering it from 4th November till 30th November 2017.
                    

As I was there for Pan Asian Food festival, I tried the items from the new menu. Trust me it had exceeded my expectations. Never thought it will be too good. Thumbs up Chef.

The highly recommended dishes from my side are Clay Pot Chicken, Dragon Fonix Soup, Bihun Goreng and in mocktail it is Humpty Dumpty.
                                                                ...

When Quantity grows, sometimes quality degrades. Yes, this is a true fact which is applicable on every matter of case and when it comes about food, it is very much true. Here in The City of Joy, the popularity of Chinese, Pan-Asian, Continental dishes are so high that you can a restaurant in each area that are serving these cuisines. But sometimes you can see that the purity of the food gone due to the high demand! So to regain that old authenticity, Orko’ss is celebrating their Pan-Asian food festivals, which was started from 4th Nov and will continue till 30th Nov.

Location - The restaurant Located at the CC1 (3rd Floor of E Block). So very easy to find.

Ambiance – The restaurant has a huge space to accommodate almost 60-70 persons at a time and the best past is, it has its own separated bar section. So you can choose between two sections according to your mood.

Decoration – The most part of the restaurant is covered up with colourful false ceiling which is really attractive and the wooden table sitting arrangement looks amazing with their lighting.

Now come to the foods, that they introduced to us, from their special authentic Pan Asian festivals –

Food -

1. Dragon Fonix Soup

2. Burmese Soup

3. Vegetable Dumka

4. Nam Jo Kai

5. Nam Kathi Rice

6. Yam Woon Sezn

7. Bihun Goreng

8. Clay Pot Chicken

Mocktails (Chef’s special items, Only for promotional purpose, Not included into the food festival) -

1) 3D Mocktail 

2) Ambush 

3) Pinacolada

4) Humpty Dumpty

5) Ginger Lemon cooler

Desserts -

1. Fried Ice-cream

We tried some of their dishes like –

Dragon Fonix Soup – Lite flavored soup with nice diced chicken into it. The foam touch over the soup is made of white part of the egg. Just add some pepper into it and you are ready to eat.

Vegetable Dumka – Another ved cuisines straight from the middle asia. The item is the deep fried form of potato mash with little bit root touch and bread crumble at the outer part. The dish was served with fried noodles.

Nam Kathi Rice – Lite rice with coconut flavor touch in it. Goes well with any mid spicy side dish.

Bihun Goreng – Thin rice noodles gently cooked in lite nature. Less amount of oil was added into it. An egg poach served into the top of the noodles looks excellent with the dish.

Clay Pot Chicken – Another authentic dish from Mid Asia. The dish was slowly cooked in charcoal taking into a clay pot. The gravy was lite in nature but goes excellent with the rice and noodles we tried. Small diced chicken with baby corn touch makes the dish super yummy. The clay pot fragrance that comes with the dish feels excellent. Overall must try item here.

Thank you Mr. Arnab Chakraborty, for inviting Team Munching Monks for the first look of some of the dishes from your festival.

So in conclusion, I will say, Orko’ss are proving till now the best Pan Asian cuisines in the city. So when you are getting such opportunity, why miss it? So go to the Orko’ss and taste the authentic Pan Asian food.

Orko'ss one of the oldest restaurant and lounge which i have noticed on City Centre 1. They offers different varieties of menus and bring in different food festivals to treat their customers based on their tastes.

Located at CC1 E block 3rd floor. Good ambience and can welcome about 80 to 100 customers at a time. Pretty decorative resturant ancient paintings, a big aquarium, different seating places.
The entire restaurant can be booked on demand to celebrate birthday parties, get together, any events, etc. They also have a bar just next to it. So one can hangout with their friends, family or colleagues for some relaxation.

Orko’s brings an award winning repertoire of culinary traditions from across the East and South East of Asia to Kolkata to savour the flavours.

“Pan Asian Food Festival” is the celebration of authentic asian cuisines and is about sheer indulgence into the lip-smacking delicacies offering  rich flavours for your tastebuds to remember.

About Orko’s restaurant & lounge,it’s located in the 3rd Floor,E-Block of City Center  1,Salt Lake,Kolkata and offer’s a fine dining experience,the characteristic feature being the vibrant ambience created by the flow of colourful light’s playing with shades of wooden table,curtains and decors.

It’s spacious and could fit a big crowd but if you want some privacy for your squad,they have that special segment with a round table,though that corner of this restora is “too red” and vibrant for my liking.

The Lounge is attached to the restaurant on the same floor but is separated by a wall to offer an option to the crowd and on the basis of their mood,they can opt for dining or partying.

The lounge is dimly lit but with a twist of neon light’s to bring up the party mood but if you’re mood to relax,that too won’t dissappoint you as the seating arrangement’s are cosy and comfortable.

They have the DJ Console to the right of the bar counter and the DJ guy surely offer’s some amazing beat for your earbuds to digest.

The moctail’s which were offered to us are as follows :

•	3D Mocktail

•	Ambush

•	Pinacolada

•	Humpty Dumpty

•	Ginger Lemon Cooler

Menu Card :

•	Burmese Soup  is a rich and indulgent curried bowl of coconut soup that is cooked with noodles and served with a delightful melange of garnishes.

•	Dragon Pheonix Soup ,is a thick seafood or gou rou soup made with lemon, chili peppers, chicken and Chinese vegetables.The flavours of the fresh veggies perfectly coordinates with the fibres of the chicken to bring out the overall vibrance of flavours.

•	Bihun Goreng is the story of medan stir fried vermicelli garnished with veggies and flavoured by chicken,topped with an egg poach to stitch the flavours together.

•	Vegetable Dumka’s were served with fried noodles and the dumka’s were basically made of potato with the sweetness and colour coming from the beet root 

•	Yam Woon Sezn is a salad quoted in thailand and is the combination of ingredients and seasonings making this dish delicious. The fact which’ll make you fall in love with this salad is how the bland noodles absorb the hot spicy sour dressing while the peanuts add the nutty, crunchiness to the salad.
 

•	Nam Kathi Rice is all about the characteristic flavour of coconut nourishing the taste of the rice,thus offering your tastebuds a soothing taste to rejoice.

•	Clay Pot Chicken is a traditional dish, the cooking is done over a charcoal stove, giving the dish a distinctive flavour and thus offer’s the essence of the clay pot blending perectly with the flavours of the veggies and the diced chicken.

The Other member's this beautiful squad of food were

•	Fried Ice Cream
 and
•	Nam Jo Kai

The food festival will last till 30th November,so if you want to indulge into some authentic asian dishes with the twist of flavours of our city,you already know the address then,start off already and get yourself prepared for the gastronomical ven and let the flow of flavours do the talking.

Located in CC1 Salt Lake. I was really amazed by the comely ambience and style out for the dining experience with calm serene environment. Moving to food and service, though really don't have much points to add under these column. The taste was kinda okay (nothing remarkable) and the service was quite good enough.

The lemon flavoured "Dragon Fonix Soup" with a beautiful combination of Chicken, Prawn, Mushroom, Bamboo shoots and Egg White, actually happens to be a sheer bliss that eventually calls for some "Princess Prawn Fans"(flattened crumb fried prawn served with Chilly Plum Sauce) to pamper your taste buds!!

Though it is always the best way to kill your stress with some awesome 'mocktails' that the restaurant is expertised at...
When it comes to the delicacies of the "Pan Asian Wonders", some 'Nam Kathi Rice'(coconut flavoured spicy rice) and 'Bihu Goreng'(Singaporean noodles topped with fried egg), along with some 'Fish Mayo(sizzler plate)', 'Vegetable Dumka', and 'Malaysian Cottage Cheese', is something that's worth giving a go...
Obviously with some 'Fish in Mome made Laska'(Fillet fish steamed in Singaporean Laska sauce served on a bed of rice)!!

So far the year of 2017 is concerned, the "Pan Asian Wonders" menu can be availed from

4 November-30 November,
12:00 noon- 11:00 P.M.

Note : The regular menu is available throughout the year.

Happy Eating 😊

What catches your attention when you walk into a Restaurant? 

Most people would agree its the decor, the ambiance of the the restaurant that sets the mood right or completely off. Orko'ss aces out in this area. The decor of this place is just amazing. Its on the 3rd floor of City Center Mall at Salt Lake. A dining area with a lounge next to it. 

Coming to the food, Its an experience of a wonderful kind.  I was invited to try some of the dishes of  PAN ASIAN WONDERS curated by the chef at Orko'ss as the Restaurant is launching some of the authentic Asian cuisines. 

First tasted some beautiful mocktails, each unique and different in taste.. Then started with the following- 

The Burmese Soup and the Dragon Fonix Soup and  Yam Woon Sezn Salad. 
The Burmese Soup- Dal soup with coconut, basil herbs and exotic vegetables.. It had a wonderful texture and feel to it.
 
Dragon Fonix Soup- A chicken and prawn with bamboo shots, mushroom  and egg white lemon flavor soup. A white frothy soup. 

Yam Woon Sezn Salad- Glass noodle with cabbage, celery &tomato pineapple chili pepper dressing. Loved the salad. it was something unique i tried for the first time. 

In the Non Veg Starters, we had Nam Jo Kai Sizzler, a grilled marinated chicken skewer served on sizzler plate with tangy green peanut sauce. 

Moving On to the Sea Food (Starters), Princess Prawn Fans and Fish Mayo on a sizzler plate was served. 
Princess Prawn Fans- Flatted crumb fried prawn served with chili plum sauce. Crispy and light. 
Fish Mayo (Sizzler) Tangy batter fried fish bed of fresh garden salad served with chili garlic mayo deep. It tasted like heaven. 

In the Vegetarian Starters, Vegetable Dumka was served-                                                                          
Vegetable Dumka- Vegetable dumpling stuffed  cheese  clotted of poppy seed deep fried  served with tangy sauce. 

Then came the Main Course- 

The Non Veg Main Course had the most unique possible dish. 

Qi Guo Ji- Steam Cloy Pot Chicken, Its and ancient dish that i found to be very unique with an interesting history.

In the Vegetarian Main Course section- 

Malaysian Cottage Cheese- Malaysian Curry with cottage cheese and bell pepper. 

and the sea food in the main course section, Fish in mome made laska                                                    
 a dish that comprises of a fillet   fish steamed with Singaporean laska sauce served on bed of rice. 

The Rice and Noodles were 

Nam Kathi Rice- Coconut flavor spicy rice. 

Bihun Goreng- Singapore noodles soft rice noodles as top of fried egg. 

For Dessert, Maphrapo was served, A scoop of Vanilla ice cream with exotic sweet dressings. 

You can have all this delicious and wonderful cuisines in their Pan Asian Festival which will be from 4th November to 30th November 2017, and timing are 12 P.M. to 11 P.M.

I was really happy with the food and service at Orkos's today. The staff was very courteous and the food was amazing. The Ala carte menu is actually very nice and lots of interesting dishes to choose from. I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place. Few pictures of the buffet menu. Trying it the next time around.

The restaurant located in the 3rd floor of CC1( salt lake) has a restaurant and an adjacent lounge. The restaurant ambience and the service is just perfect for a good dining experience. Apart from this, the restaurant is also planning to recreate some authentic Asian cuisine. I was invited to try some of the pan Asian wonders. The dishes presented were unique in taste.
To start with they served the "Dragon Fonx Soup " , which a non-veg soup prepared with chicken, prawn , egg white infused with lemon white.
Next came the starter " Nam Jo Kai", chicken skewers served on sizzler plate , with rich tangy  peanut sauce.
Princess Prawn Fans is prawn prepared with perfect crumb served with chilli plum sauce. As I am a prawn lover I loved this dish.
Fish Mayo: This dish spells 'love' for any fish lover. Here is a dish which has fried fish coated in perfect batter presented with fresh salad and mayo dip.
Vegetarians must try " Malaysian cottage cheese" , this is authentic Malaysian curry prepared with cottage cheese.
Tried two types of rice "Nam Kathi Rice" ( coconut flavoured spicy rice)
"Bihun Goreng" (Singapore meifoon topped with fried egg)
Apart from the beautiful dishes you can try some brilliant mocktails.
You can try all this dishes in "Pan Asian Festival" ( nov4th- Nov 30th, timing: 12noon to 11pm).

We visited during the festivals, there was a long queue and it was quite late. They gave us complimentary drinks and were really very warm and friendly! Upon requesting they arranged for a table pretty fast, thank god. We ordered a lot and hogged like crazy. The pompret, kebabs were sooo good, melt in your mouth! The food was delicious and the service was one of the best we got recently! Loved the kebabs, Chinese and continental items the most.

We were so tired, hungry and the dishes looked so great that we didn't even click all pics, just started eating right away lol. We were so impressed with the quality, quantity, taste and the sheer variety that we decided to visit again last week. This time we did click photos, also tried other items on the menu too.

We had tried the buffet earlier, lots of items, loved the starters, non veg main course and at such a great price. Kebabs are must try as well as mughlai dishes. My friend loved their Chinese a lot. This time we tried the fish and the Conti items. We didn't know they would make that good Conti, which was a surprise.

The pompret items on the menu are must, must, must haves. Delicious, fresh and soft, you can actually feel the flavours melting in your mouth. Same goes for kebabs, tender, juicy and so very flavourful! There is one tandoori type pompret that is the best, absolute best item on the menu. 

What made our experience so good and we decided to go back is however their service. Awesome service and great recommendations as per our preference which we loved. Both times during and after the meal the manager personally came to each table and asked if we needed anything, how was our meal and our feedback. 

Even during the festival the service was great which we loved and despite the queue we didn't have to wait much for food. We were bowled over with the food though we are yet to try many others.

My friend enjoyed the DJ nights and weekend events and the wed/Thurs ladies night. Still raves about it. I am yet to try. I Loved the lounge bar, music and the mocktails. Though a bit on the  expensive side, the amazing ambience, great setvice and of course the food more than make up for it. Since buffet is cheaper and with great variety and amazing food, those looking to lower their pocket pinch can try it instead of a la carte. Though personally I am a fan of their a la carte. 

And its a great place to celebrate birthdays, parties too, saw one being celebrated last time...nicely decorated and awesome celebration in a separate section without hindering our privacy.

 Planning to visit next month mid , they told us they have a Chinese food festival coming up and the dishes looked awesome.
Thanks a ton for this great hangout , we are going to be regulars now and thank you for the awesome experience.

Had the misfortune of going out there few weeks back on a team lunch. When the entire team reached there it was communicated to us that they had no intimation of our booking and no food is prepared. When we informed them that the booking email was sent they acknowledged it but they said for some email issue they didn't receive the mail. The entire team had to wait around 40 mins when they could start the starters in the buffet. Even then the quantity was insufficient for the team and many had to wait long to get some food. Even the main course was inadequate to feed the group. The entire staff was unprofessional giving different versions of the reason for the mismanagement. The situation demanded somebody in the restaurant to take some out of the box measures but sadly that never took place.

The quality of the food was not bad however the above scenario soured the entire mood. With so many good restaurants around the vicinity i don't think I'll ever recommend this for any group outing.

Experience this time was much better at the outlet, considering very heavy rush in the Durga puja festive season. The non veg platter was excellent, with mutton kabab being top notch. Kulcha was also good. However, the most improved performance was in the area of service and courteous staff. Overall very satisfying experience

Very average place but exorbitant price. During festive season even more expensive. Food is not upto the mark when compared with the price they charge. 
We had ordered raan masala which cost us 1100 approx. Preparation was good but again too pricey. Other dishes ordered were rara mutton, biryani and nun. All were average. Veg pulao was too sweet.

Went here on a Saptami afternoon. Didn't have to wait for long. Ordered chicken tai pai and murgh malai kebab. Both were good. For main course chicken patiyala and chicken rara were suggested by them. Chicken patiyala tasted good but the other preparation was okayish. Polao was bland. Delivery is a bit slow. However pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side. But staff are very well behaved. Moreover an average experience.

This place saved us when we were out pandal-hopping at Salt Lake yesterday. There were long queues in front of each and every good restaurant, so we thought it would be a safer bet to go to a mall. We were wrong. There were long queues in every restaurant at City Centre 1 including Orko'ss, but it was their warm hospitality that made us wait despite the fact that we were starving. We were even served complimentary drinks while we waited.
We ordered from their Indian menu : Murgh Malai Tikka, Plain Nan, Navratan Polao, Maahi Amritsari Masala and Mughlai Murgh.
The Nan was soft and flaky at the right places. The kebabs were succulent and perfectly grilled. The fish and chicken gravy items were rich, but not very heavy on the stomach. They were perfectly flavoured.
The star of the dish for us though was the Navratan Polao which was unlike any Polao I have sampled before. It was a treasure trove of fruits, dry fruits and nuts and cream. Even then it was not sickly-sweet, but perfectly balanced.
The place may not be affordable by students and it does have more of a family dining feel about it, I would recommend this place not only for their brilliant food but also their warm hospitality.

Orko'ss is literally one of those restaurants where you eat and everything tastes fine but there is something missing and you cannot pin it down to what. 
We were hungry, tired, wanted something to eat and wanted some beer along with it. Orko'ss seemed to be a feasible option since we were already at CC1. Confused between the lounge and the restaurant, we ended up walking into the restaurant and the staff was really polite. Their food turned up pretty quick and it all tasted okay. Expect the Sichuan fried rice with seafood that was a bit soggy. Loved the fish chilli too. The chicken in their Taipai chicken was a little tough but taste was okay. 
We really liked the nolen gurer ice cream but let's be honest, who doesn't like nolen gurer ice cream. 
Then came the bill and it was really high for the amount of food we received. And none of them were worth it. There are places where you go and you are so charmed that no amount of money is too much and there are places that you go to which leave a weird taste in your mouth- Orko'ss belong to the latter. They might call themselves fine dining restaurant but there is nothing "fine" about it and their food is pretty average.

They don't know how to prepare a cocktail. The staffs and Manager are worthless. They play loud music and you can't hear the person sitting opposite to you. The food and drinks menu are so high that you will like to get out of the restaurant at the same time. The ambience and class of the restaurant is poor.

Horrible food, rude employee and very small dance floor. Only few food items. Starters were not eatable. In main course 3 non veg item. 1. fish manturaian - you can take batch in gravy, 2. mutton kasa - full of bones, very salty, 3.chicken curry- again you have to put lots of effort to find chicken. only desert was gulab jamun - how can anybody make that sweet non eatable. They assume that drunk person's taste buds are inactive. For my case I was not drunk and had to taste their mess. They need to really work hard to improve service.

Located on the 3rd floor of CC1, this lounge bar provides an wonderful ambience. The fluorescent black lights and the semi circular seating arrangements is perfect for a chat and catch up with friends. The staffs are courteous and helpful. Cash and card accepted without any hassle. The food ordered was also pretty tasty. However, the cost is a bit on the upper side. But the ambience makes up for the extra cost.

I don't know why, but this joint has almost always disappointed me. Please don't get me wrong. The ambience is pretty good and the postion size is also good. But, the taste ..... Maybe, it's because of the reason that I've opted for their a la carte items almost always (my sister loves them) and not for their famed set lunch or buffet. Also, I've almost always tried their Indian items and they are mostly be called as average at best. The kebabs were okay-ish and the chicken bharta (from our last visit), though pretty heavy in portion size, was otherwise bland in taste. 

If somebody is looking for a good ambience in CC1 and are not too choosy or finicky about what they eat, this is a good choice. 

Will I go again ? My family somehow loves this place after their shopping spree- so I might just have to

We went into the bar on 1 January 2017 because the restaurant were fully booked.
Good music.
We had chicken patiyala with butter nan and breezer.  
The patiyala is awesome with warpped omlets.
I don't know how the food actually looks because of the lights in the bar 😂 but the food is yummy. ❤️
I broke one glass over there but they didn't charge a single penny for it. 
Attracting one funny pictures of us because i don't have any other pictures over there.
Hope to visit again. ❤️

Being a hardcore foodie,i love to explore different types of cuisines and to taste different types of foods. There are few restaurants in my wishlist where I prefer to eat.”Orko’ss Restaurant & Lounge Bar” is one of them. Located at the 3rd floor of City center I , Saltlake . Extremely awesome ambiance with finger-licking foods. Around 36-40 people can seat and eat at a time.Interiors quite classy with comfy sofas as well as very well maintained.

We went there on a office party and had lunch buffet there. Good varieties of starters and main courses with respect to the price they charge. Quite spacious and good ambiance, no complaint about the quantity or quality, may be they can work a little more on the spread of dessert to make people more happy....not sure about the Ala cart service

This place is below average. We had ordered for sizzler and it was poor in quality. The staff had to be reminded in our moctail, after waiting for half an hour after the order was placed. The lights and AC were put out after 3:30 PM. The presentation of the food was bad. The place is overpriced in comparison to the food they provide.

Overall the place is not advisable to go for a good lunch or dinner.

This is a restaurant which should be marked for its inconsistencies. I had had absolutely fav meal here. However, My experience have not been very favourable in some other occasions just like today. 

Today we went for a late lunch. I prefer the bengali dishes in orko's. However, the waiter told me that the dishes will take around half an hour of time. Accordingly we went for chinese. The main course came after 30 mins (??? Yes). And the food was just disaster. Completely tasteless. The mutton in mixed meat fried rice was stale. The chopsuye over fried and sticky. And as I already told mark the restaurant for inconsistencies, the starters were fav. 

As a final word I would say you will have a good meal here if it's your day.

Don't know why this restaurant rating is low but I will suggest to my friends and family one you should test food here. It's having lots of choice . Chinese , Indian and continental all variety of food are available in this restaurant.

I will come again and try Chinese and other food once .

Coming to food, the staffs suggested me try out the tangri kebab which is stuffed with mutton keema inside - very innovative mughlai cuisine and tasted delicious too along with the mocktail cooler. Rates are reasonable and the service is very good with staffs being courteous to the guests.

City Centralitesss!!!
When you are in North Kolkata, you cannot miss City Centre 1 to eat and sit over available avenues. Loads of options to eat and hang around, wherein I found Orko's  a very decent dine-out place. I am all praise with the decor vibes. So I love sea-food and found its  golden fried prawns permeated with chicken chilly garlic noodles simply  delectable! The snag is the preparation and serving delays where you keep checking your watch and a pricey checkout at the counter...

Don't know why this restaurant has such low rating but I thoroughly enjoyed our outing here on valentine's day. It has separate restaurant and lounge section, we entered the restaurant part, it was wonderfully decorated for the occasion. Service was good. All the food items were excellent. Ordered valentine's special kasturi kabab, sarson wali machli tikka, kabuli naan, murg patiala, caramel custard, and some mocktails. All of them were truly wonderful. It is no doubt very costly restaurant, per head cost was rs 1300 but quality and quantity were up to the mark. overall enjoyed the experience..

Orko's restaurant and lounge bar is located in the 3rd floor  of city centre, salt lake.
Ambience and interior décor is stylish and fantastic. Multi coloured lights adds a beautiful view.
As starters , we ordered chicken manchau soup as appetiser , which was hot and spicy and delectable. Chicken Tai pai was awesome. Dry Schezwan chicken was tasty. Both had perfect tanginess to arouse the taste buds. Blue lagoon mocktail was enjoyable and refreshing .
For main course, we ordered , fish in hot garlic sauce, kum pao chicken , chicken Hakka noodles and chicken fried rice.
Spices and flavours tingled our taste buds. Chicken fried rice and fish in hot garlic sauce combo was amazing .kum pao chicken tasted average .
In dessert , we had Darsan with vanilla , which was enjoyable.
Finally we had fresh lime soda, which was good, it aided better digestion.
Overall a nice experience.

Below average quality of food, average service. Tried grilled fish sizzler which was not that good to taste, not well prepared, and certainly not worth ₹650+tax!

Sitting arrangements at the restaurant was a bit weird (semi circular). Service was slow, not very attentive to our requests (had to repeat twice to refill glass of water, had to reorder drinks which was misunderstood by them while placing order initially, lights being dimmed around 4pm as their service was closing even if we were still to finish our lunch, delayed primarily because it took them 45 minutes to prepare sizzlers!)

Overall a very expensive place for below average quality of food. Not worth a second visit.

Orko'ss happened when a friend of mine decided to treat us on her birthday out here. It was a redemption of 4 coupons from Little, as we were a total of 8 people altogether. 
It is located in the City Centre Mall, Sector 1, at the third floor of E block. The entrance is lit with blue something LED lights, with a receptionist just at the entrance. We were welcomed inside, and on entry we showed the coupon and took our seats at a round table. The place is  big enough, good decor, well lit with various colored LED lights in red, blue, pink and green, and warm lights of yellow. The ambience was good. The waiters were sober and coordinated, knew what we wanted and service was moderately on time.
We were given the menu, to choose the options of the drinks, appetisers, soups and main course. The drinks were unlimited. We went for Fresh Lime Soda, and some of them went for cold drinks. 
In appetisers, we opted for Sweet Corn chicken soup, which was okay in taste, as the soup was much on the sweeter side.
In starters, we opted for Chilli Chicken Dry and Chicken Tai Pai. Both the dishes more or less tasted the same. The only difference was Chilli Chicken had more of capsicums, and the other one had onions.
The starters were good enough. Liked the taste!!
For main course, from among the options, we opted for Chicken Fried Rice, Kumpao Chicken and Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce. 
The chicken fried rice was okay in taste, with very little amount of chicken. The rice grains were soft, but it was oily and somewhat greasy. 
The Kumpao Chicken tasted good, the gravy had a tangy flavour. Liked it!
The Fish in Hot Garlic sauce was not a good choice! Didnt like the taste at all, as the sauce used had a weird kind of a smell and taste! Bad dish!
For desserts, there was Vanilla icecream with some chocolate sauce over it. Good enough!
Liked the place, decor, ambience was good! Food was nothing great, quite average!

My friend acted as a saviour when he suggested this restro for dinner. Initially we went into the lounge but out of the disturbance caused by over loud music we moved to the restro section. 
Location- City Centre Block E 3'rd Floor
Cuisine - Chinese, Indian, Thai etc
Pocket pinch - 1100INR for two
My opinion- Quality of food is good. We took chicken Taipei for starter, chicken in butter sauce and chicken fried rice for main course. Chicken in butter sauce contained less spice but tasted great. Overall I liked the decor and food and the concept of complimentary snacks.

Went for a office project dinner. In the buffet, the starters are really awesome and good. But the main course food is of Ok kind. They served chicken rice in the name of chicken biriyani. The only food in the main course that had some quality was the noodles that they served. In the dessert, the sweets and ice cream are ok. 
Have been to the place earlier also but it seems that the quality of the food has gone down. They need to improve on the quality of food that they serve.

Orko'ss is like my second home. Ram da and Riyaj da are my two favourite servers there. The place has great lighting and music. The service is bit slow but the ambience, staff behaviour and food quality makes up for it.

Good place to be with friends. Happy hours are good. But the place is too small but cozy. Good loud music , you can enjoy the beats.

Seats are well cushioned, staff were active and polite. I am happy with the service.

Food are also good. You can try it once for sure :)

Had dropped in with a friend long, long time back. Been 10 years atleast, me and my buddy was in search of a place to sit and have some drinks. That is when we decided to try Orko's. If I remember correctly, the bar area was very small. A tiny room, not covering a big area. The sitting options were comfortable though, with large tables being placed in between. We made ourselves comfortable and ordered for Vodka. In there came two kinds of munchies. One was premium quality of peanuts and the other I do not remember. We had also ordered for a Tandoori Chicken. The quality was good but the quantity was quite less. Hence, it did not justify the price tag (Perhaps was 300 or 350 bucks). The music was pretty loud then which did not made us be comfortable for long.

It's decent, easy and pocket and a very cozy place to spend the evening dinner at 

I liked the staff courtesy and promptness very much. 
We were offered very good seats with complimentary Papad and the services were at ease. 

I would recommend this place to everyone to try once it can become your daily restaurant and it had 1:1 offer on drinks.

We ate veg and no drinks and was happy with it in every aspect.

Orko'ss is one of the oldest places operating in the City Centre mall. It has a steady & loyal clientele which keeps the business flowing despite an astounding amount of negative publicity. The restaurant is large & spacious though the lounge is a bit small but cozy nonetheless. The food is good & their Indian items are much better than the rest on offer. Try the Mahi Zatuni or Murg Ka Sula. The drinks are not cheap but they have happy hours (the 1+1 offer is very good). The service can be lackadaisical but once you've become a regular customer, it's easier to draw their attention. I have come across two of the most knowledgeable bartenders/mixologists here, Amit (who is working elsewhere) & Avinash (who is now the manager). Dimly lit it may be but a few hours in this place would certainly brighten up your day.

Worst Restaurant we have ever visited! We went for a corporate dinner party last night with 45 people. The Dinner was supposed to start from 7 PM. We reached there by 6:55 pm and they made us wait for at least 40 mins and then the disaster started. Non Veg Starters are more of batter, less of non veg thing. We got free COCKROACH VIEW along with the food. The Crispy Chilly Corn was giving the feeling of chewing plastic. Now coming to the Main Course Part. I had to ask it for at least 5 times.  I was super hungry. So I had to had Veg Fried Rice,the only eatable part in the whole dinner buffet. Even the vanilla flavored Ice cream had an awkward smell. As a whole it was a disaster.

Went there for our office party. We had beer towers, 3-4 Chinese starters, Chinese main course ending with ice cream and darshan. 
- Environment is comfortable and seating arrangements are cleverly done with big crowds sitting in the middle and others diners at scattered tables
- Coming to the food, it was disappointing, I do not know whether it was for the office party or if its the same when dinning alone but the food was not good at all. Like the dry chili chicken was really spicy, you could throw in a competition on that like who ever finishes the plate wins! and crispy chili babycorn was overdone and hard to the point that you cannot use your fork to eat them anymore
- Food taste was about average
- Final verdict, they sometimes have good deals running, you can check those out to try this place for cheap

On this last Saturday (30th April) I went to have lunch with few of my friends in here. Honestly I was in dilemma whether to have lunch in Orko'ss cause it was completely new for us. But to tell you truth, the meal and the ambiance was surprisingly good and we had a nice time over there. 

We ordered, Chicken Lahsooni Malai Kabab, Lachha Paratha, Butter Nun, Mutton RoganJosh, Chicken Patiala, Sweet Lemonade & Chilled Beer. 
Out of all those, the winner was the Chicken Patiala. It's unique and super tasty. And there is one good option for people who want to have some hard drink over some Indian spicy starters. Happy Hours are there (For Drinks) where you will get one free with every bottle of beer or every peg. :)

Keep this quality up all the time..:)

Tried their food at an acquaintance's suggestion. Had their Tandoori Phool, Basmati rice, Narkeli Chholar Daal, Navrattam Korma, and Dhaniya Murg. Food was so-so, but liked the cauliflower fritters. I've heard someone suffering from food poisoning after trying out their prawn item. Personally I wouldn't want to taste their food again.

This is the worst restaurant I have visited so far. Apparently, there was some birthday celebration going on, I and my friends walked and asked for the buffet menu, they fooled us into saying that the birthday party feast was their buffet. We paid 1400/- each and the people who had come to celebrate the party looked at us with a question mark on their faces. Later, we realized the trickery but as we were getting late we didn't say anything. The food was absolutely horrendous, if you are a hard-core non-vegetarian and you want to try non-vegetarian food here, kindly don't.

The decor is good the staffs r good the ambience is moderate , but wen it comes to the food section its ordinary , i dnt know why but it did not stand to my expections 
We were a group of 8 & the bill was about 9000 inspite of fact that half didnt booze and who boozed had 1 or 2 pegs and the main course was shared. Its not about the price but the food.

Orkos has two section one is the restaurant and the other one is the bar with lounge.

First coming to the restaurant..
The thing which is most important for a restaurant is the food. To be very frank they don't really move up on my food o meter that much. I had visited this place in number of occasions but was failed to be impressed with the food. 
Otherwise the place has quite a classy look and feel. Improved food taste can make up for the lagging

The lounge is very popular among the youngsters. Yes the place is quite lively .
Drinks and dance is fun here but the dance floor is quite small. Well never mind as long as you have good company.

The ambience is pretty good and the restaurant is on the higher budget side. The food though costly makes up with the quality. We had ordered both Indian and chinese. The noodles was pretty decent though not excelent , quantity wise good for 2 people. The signature dish Rara Gosht is simply mind blowing. The mutton is very well cooked nad the minced meat gravy enchants your buds. Its best supplement with butter naan or some thing of that family. The quantity is actaully good enough for 3-4 people. Its a must try dish. the butter naan @ 70-80 INR is really over priced. Overall it will pinch your pocket but will make up with quality and quantity.

I have been to this place once with my family. We had biriyani on mind and thats all that was ordered. It took around half hour to prepare the dish, though we were the only guest. The reason was that they do real dum biriyani and not the "jhatka" (kadai ) types. The biriyani we got at last was completely worth it. I have had biriyani all over the country and this one was very good by any standards. My little sister just loves biriyani and she doesn't order anything else anywhere. She loved it. The mutton pieces were really flavourful but the chicken pieces could have been better. The chicken was a bit dry for some reason. That said the rice flavour was perfect.

Great ambiance, beautiful seating with match on and very good service. Really great staff who cares for you. Will try other dishes soon. But great first time experience.

Nice interior - poor food quality- very few options in buffet and poor combos- plus there is a red bucket from where your water will be served
This is a detailed review where I will be the listing the pros and cons. I visited the restaurant section so I will be sticking to that

Pros
1. Good location
2. The place though small had nice interiors and seating was comfortable.

Cons(Quite a long list)

1. We went for the lunch Buffet and there were very few items for selection.
For starters there was only Chicken Tikka and some oil soaked deep fried things they gave fancy names and taste was very disappointing. 
2. My vegetarian friends were impressed by a few items  but overall they had very very limited choices.
3. In the main course there was mutton biryani, nan and chicken Butter masala and its paneer equivalent , nothing much to write home about.
4. The dessert section was just gulab jamun and normal run of the mill Ice - cream.You get better options at your para's wedding.
5. And the thing that really turned me off was There was a big red bucket right near the counter from where the waiters were pulling out jugs of water and serving. That was so not expected from a place that claims to be high end
I will have to try ala -carte for that analysis but as far as buffet is concerned I wont be visiting again any time soon

After reading the zomato reviews I was very apprehensive about going to this place, but had to go since it was an invitation. But on reaching the place my views changed. The interior was good. We'd taken the buffet. All the items tasted really good- the fish in salt n pepper, fish in chilli garlic salt and the tandoori chicken deserve special mention. The desserts were a bit disappointing. They had only three- gulab jamun, gajar ka halwa and vanilla ice cream out of which the gulab jamun was really tasty while the others nit so much.
But apart from that, I had a good experience and would recommend others to go visit this place.

First time visit only because Kix was blocked due to some private party down stairs. When you enter the place you just can't see anything its so dark which is quite unusual for a pub like this in a posh place like cc1. However seating arrangement is comfortable and cozy. We got the happy hour so, we got three beers in cost of one two smirnoff red and one plate of pan fried chilli chicken. Coming to food its good fresh hot and tasted fine. Cheese chips accompanied with the drinks are very oily. But the ambience is not good at all loud music was making it worse. And the place has big time hygiene issues we saw cockroches roaming around. Not excited about the any more visits.

We were looking for a decent place for our office party. Orko's provided us that. The service is really commendable and they are willing to go that extra mile to satisfy the clients, which is much appreciated. Firstly, they did not have a dinner buffet but for a group of 20, they were willing to design one for us. 
We had a dedicated circular space in the middle of the restaurant which had 4 tables and 8 sofas, so the seating arrangement was good. Though they could rethink the orientation of this place because every time we had to go from one table to another, we actually had to come out of the circle and go around the other tables. There could have been a easy-to-go passage within this space to make things more comfy. 
The items in buffet spread were to some extent limited, but all of them were tasty enough. They had 2 non-veg and 2 veg starters but for a drinks party like we had, I felt they should perhaps have at least one more. The Chili Pepper Fish was one to mention specifically and it went well with our drinks. 
Regarding drinks, they are probably one of very few places where you can buy a full bottle, thus paying less than per peg and the whole budget for the party becomes somewhat easy on pocket. Also not to forget all the soft drinks and soda complimentary with drinks. This concept really helps planning and organizing parties. 
Coming to main course, well, after 3 full bottles of drinks and abundant starters, we were not really in a mood for trying out all the main course provided in the buffet. We had some plain rice, noodles, naan, tandoori roti etc and some side dishes. There was Mutton Biriyani too. The Chicken Dopyaza was good to have with Naan. 
Now, for the atmosphere, the restaurant was quite sober. But they had an adjoining lounge area for smoking, dancing (with loud DJ music) where the young people could really get loose. One thing worth-mentioning is that the sound-proofing of the original restaurant area where you could hardly get a sound from the dance floor. 
Overall, a 20 people party costing ample food and drinks coming at around 25K ... corporate teams would love that I guess. We will probably have our next parties at this place only.

Average ambience... But the prices are definitely not worth their food quality and variety... There are hardly 4 oriental starters or appetizers... Besides their liquor prices are also quite high... Almost double the price of normal restaurants
For starters we had Taipei chicken and pan fried chilli chicken.... Both their gravies tasted the same except that pan fried chilli chicken had green chilies in it...
Utterly disappointed with this place

So the receptionist told we have to pay for all 11 which was a little odd to hear then they said we can't move in until we pay for all 11 people.. made us pissed off and after that cockroaches flying everywhere and even pest in our food .. It was just disgusting.. I wish I had a minus rating.. I would surely had give to this place..

We went Orko'ss because the Hushh restaurant was closed at that time for some unknown reason.. My baby was with me, but they didn't have any baby chair/ kid chair. The interior was good, specifically the central round area. But the food items are unnecessary expensive. We were welcomed with a complimentary snack. We ordered cream of chicken soup and crispy chilly baby corn as our starter and mutton biriyani and chicken patiala as our main course. The cream of chicken soup was really tasty. But the other items were ok type.. The chicken in chicken patiala was hard enough.

For the food - not much of a variety. We wanted to have only chicken starters -the reshmi Kabab was not as delicious as how reshmi Kababs generally are.  The other starter the name of which I don't recollect was also of a chicken dish which I didn't much enjoy .

They had that big standee near the entrance, promoting sizzlers and we thought of giving it a shot. the ambiance was cosy with few tables occupied. the time was around 7.30 evening. mutton sizzlers were not available and we had to order grilled chicken sizzler. taste was great though it took a time to arrive at our table. the staffs were courteous. helped me putting my drained cellphone on charging. prices were not steep and portion size was good. we also ordered for a Chinese fish starter. for drinks we had beers and couple of whiskeys. 

worth trying after all. also serves buffet priced at 500++ .

Located in City centre Salt Lake, this place serves quality food at a hefty price. Went here last Saturday at around 3.30pm for lunch. The restaurant was closed so we were seated in the lounge. It was dimly lit, obvious for a lounge, not at all crowded. Ordered for orko'ss special tangri kabab, kesari murgh and butter nan and beer. Service was prompt. The tangri kabab was really tasty and the kesari murgh tasted heavenly. The food was cooked perfectly, no extra oil. The main let down was the price. The quantity served is appropriate but shouldn't be this pricey. Would recommend the place for the food but beware of the prices.

I  mainly go here for their buffets..... the food quality is good and they have ample variety... the best part is the dessert section of their buffet... ala- carte is not preferable here since it will make a big whole in your pocket... moreover as per as quality Ala-carte is over prices.

A very small place with very expensive stuffs.. Ambience is okayish. Can go if u you wanna try it for the first time. But surprisingly in a bar , where people mostly go to grab a drink, what fascinated me was ots nolen gurer icecream. It was realy very tasty but again, very pricy.

Wow! I'm astonished to see that it has even managed to get an average rating of more than 2. Not only is the food quality below standard & scant arrangement in buffet but also the people are discourteous.
We went for a group buffet dinner and they wanted to charge extra because there were a few absent (I mean who is that stupid to reserve count in a buffet). Also they had the audacity to suggest trying paneer masala with hakka chowmein as there were very few veg items. I ate there 8 years ago and not a single thing changed except they now have a smaller dining area for obvious reasons.

Our order comprised Malai Kofta, Mausam ki Sabji and breads. The malai kofta was sweet to the point of being inedible. The other subji was a fairly random green paste. While it tasted fine, no vegetable was distinctly discernible given how the name set an expectation. On a positive note, the breads were pretty good, soft and of humongous size. I have no complaints about the service. This outlet of Orko’s is probably their most upscale. Hence, the rates to go with it. Expect about Rs.600 per head. With so many options just in City Center, forget Sector 1, I am guessing the going is pretty tough for Orko.

The restaurant is not that of a great place because of unjustified high rates and lack of quality. The restaurant section looks decent enough for there's nothing special about the place. The lounge however is an annoying place in many ways.

The charges are too high for a place like it and the music is so damn loud that you'll get headaches in sometime. The place is not ideal for a good time but can be considered to start the night.

Located in one of the busiest and happening shopping mall in Kolkata. Went for a la carte and it was good. With light instrumental music being played in the background and good service, this place is not bad. Having said that, some of the other options available in the locality are far better than this one. Try this only if you do not manage to find a seat in the others.

Went to their Lounge and Bar recently. Seating and lighting moderate.. They offers only kingfisher and fosters in happy hours. Apart from this two all are very over priced for only 30ml. Food is also not so good in taste. If you are only in a mood of having drinks then its better to go to Opium or Mehek e punjab. music was very loud but we enjoyed as at that moment no one was there and drinks, music and good friends are enough to shake ur legs. We had enough fun but that is not enough for giving them extra points.

No idea about the buffet @ ₹475 they offer because I didn't tried it. But ala carte order also managed to pick ₹700 per person to us.

I went there last night to celebrate a colleague's birthday. This was my maiden visit to this place.The restaurant part and the lounge bar part are completely separated. The ambience is nice and the central round structure is a delight. We were welcomed with a complimentary soft drink. Coming to the buffet menu, the starters had 2 veg item, veg shami kebab and one potato mixture, 2 non veg ones, chicken tikka and chicken malai. Both the non veg starters were brilliant, I didn't taste the veg ones. Coming to the main course, I have ignored the 2 veg side dishes. I had veg noodles( yummy ), fish in garlic sauce ( clear winner), chicken biriyani ( ok- ish) and chicken kosha ( tasty). The dessert consists of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce, gajar ka halwa ( pathetic), hot gulab jamun ( delicious). There was a salad counter also with green salad, potato salad and sprouts. Mutton was not there in the buffet menu which was a big disappointment. The staff's were good, they were very quick in replacing the plates and refilling the food items.

Its small. I dont think more than 20 can enter it. The non veg kabab platter was delicious.  I hit the place with my wife for a casual evening snacks and before moving to Kobes for dinner. 
However I do not know what the restaurant policy is but You cannot allow smoking in a restaurant. We were there for an hour when a group of guys and girls came in and started smoking without any intervention from the staff and the whole room (my living space is bigger) was filled with toxic smoke. That was bad. We finished our plate fast and moved out.

Orko’s Restaurant & Lounge Bar is located within the ‘E’ block, 3rd floor of City Centre, Salt Lake. The interiors are stylish and unique – tables have been arranged around a circular dome in the middle of the restaurant, futuristic looking overhead lighting fixtures cast a multi-coloured glow around the space as diners tuck into their meal.
The place was not too crowded so we could just sit back and enjoy our food. We had ordered ‘Chicken Manchow Soup’ soup as appetizer, followed by ‘Chicken Tai Pai’ & ‘Schezwan Chicken’ for starters along with ‘Blue Lagoon’ mocktails.  Chicken Manchow Soup was just too good, hot and spicy. Among starters dry Schezwan Chicken was tasty but Chicken Tai Pai was excellent. The food just simply amazed us with its boldness of flavour and lip tingling peppers. Don’t get me wrong anyone who had followed my reviews knows I love some finger licking dishes that aren’t always the most healthy but oh so good! 
In main course we ordered ‘Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce’, ‘Kum Pao Chicken’, ‘Chicken Hakka Noodles’ and ‘Chicken Fried Rice’. The spices and flavours in Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce played with our taste buds. Chicken Fried Rice & Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce combo was truly an interesting pleasure. Kum Pao Chicken feels bit out of touch, taste just average. For desserts we tried ‘Darsan with Vanilla Ice Cream’.  Darsan was delightful, crunchy and so delicious!  It melts in our mouth, so soft and yammmiiii. Finally we had ‘Fresh Lime Soda’ to end our meal. Overall a pleasing experience, food was pretty good, nothing extremely special, but I did enjoy this place.

A typical example of what we call, 'Naam bade, par darshan chotte.' Been here at the new year's eve and typically worse scenario, no entry to the club lounge for boys but girls are allowed. Thus decided to take a dig in the restaurant but the same scenario prevails, hiked pricelist. They almost doubled the price ofall the items on menu which they serve on a regular basis. Price for drinks and food are so steep. 

The quality of the food was not that good and neither the service. All together a bad experience, though the new year was well spent.

The food was likable and the company i had was great. We were cordially served mocktails, soup and starters. The Fresh Lime soda was good, the manchow soup was like regular as expected. we had pan fried chili chicken for starters , they were rather good. Then we were served Chicken Hakka noodles and mongolian fish. We enjoyed the desserts of darshan and ice cream.

All in All, a nice place for family dinners or a cozy romantic date. Pocket Pinch from alacarte is a bit much but again its a restaurant in City Centre providing a lush ambiance. So, select your priority and pay a visit. I vouch you won't be disappointed totally.

The food over here really did impress me & make me visit the place again with my cousin in the last week...we had ordered Orko'ss Special Tangri Kabab n Fried Chilli Chicken as starters. For main course we had Rice, Butter Nun n Afgani Tangri Masala.

Orko'ss is somewhere you'll find some awesome kababs ... Particularly 'Orko'ss Special Tangri Kabab' will definitely pamper your taste buds!!

Last but not the least this place has a great ambience & half the credit goes to the soft instrumental music.

Though the food is a bit over priced but I'll prefer visiting Orko'ss once in a while for having a great time with friends n family !!

I have not visited this particular branch, but the Orko'ss express food court stall in Mani square only. They don't have a Zomato account and so I am posting here, as it's the nearest sister concern. I went during the Puja- 30th September, 2014.
Service is proactive but food is a bit confusing.  We ordered Bouthakurani'r hate'r boRa - on their recommendation and they were four small boRas - but they were really tasty, some mix of vegetables were used- couldn't identify. But the kosha mangsho luchi was a big let down.  The mangsho was just a thicker version of a curry, not tasty enough too. And it's difficult to imagine Bengalees messing up Luchi!  But they did it- they served me two Bhaturas. Got really surprised. 
Anyhow it was an okay experience - the boRa cancelled out the other item. It will be a bit risky to venture here if you need an authentic bengali food I guess.

Orko's has a good, plush up scale ambience and courteous staff. But, over priced, the food they serve has every thing except taste. What ever they serve, be what ever it may be, the taste is blant. The buffet spread has nothing... not even a single thing to mention. Blant food, over priced menu, upscale ambience is some thing how we may define Orkos.

Food not so good.... We went on a friend's birthday treat. Ambience and decor was good. Food was somewhat bland to taste. I ordered pan-fried chicken noodles, which had lots of vegetables and chicken pieces but partially cooked noodles. My friends ordered rice items with gravy, which was large in amount but not so tasty. P.S. going in pairs will ensure that your money isn't going down the drain, as the items have high rates and amount is for more than two people ;)

Place was okay; but too congested. Have gone for an office party and the group was big so hardly get space to stand in a queue! Food was good. Price was okay. So if given a chance I will visit again, but this place is not certainly meant for office parties!

First thing to mention about this restaurant is Chicken Patiala...an amazingly different dish made in combination with omlette..definitely a must try with butter nan. Food menu becomes limited during Durga Pooja times. The ambience is really good to take your family with. Mutton kebab really tastes good here. Nice place to have an adda with good food.

Visited this place recently with family members. Service is very poor...food quality is ok but way to costly compairing the service. Only good thing is their ambience. If u r more for ambience than the food and quality then only i wud recomend this. People dont have any idea how to maintain service in rush hours. Had ordered a fish dish and found bones in a FISH item...comone..even roadside foodstalls make bonless fish and chicken items nowadays...overall very poor and bad experience...will not recomend anyone...thete are plenty of better places around.

Nice place to hangout!
            

Good and helpful management.

Their pitcher is the thing which you can go for always. Music at all depends, mostly hindi songs are played when DJ is not available or else if DJ was there than you will find this pub rocking.

Cons: less dance space, sitting arrangement is narrowed.

But their adjacent restaurant besides bar is good for family.

The first thing came into my mind while writing this, why did I choose this place for dinner, horrible would not be enough to spell out. We had gone gor dinner and opted for buffet, all four were truly dissapointed as there was only one dish-malai kebab was well made. All others were either not cooked properly or poured into salt water. I cant imagine paying 600 bucks but could not swallow most of them. Only thing was the ambience that was good. Else its a full waste of money. I would recommend please do not go there if you love to have good food.

I visited Orkos with my family after a gap of almost 7 years. I used to be quite a regular there when it first opened and was impressed by the quality of their food, the service and the interesting decor.

Tonight to celebrate Rakhi we visited the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised to see that the quality of food (except the Beckti) had not suffered. The ambiance is still pleasing but the service has slackened a bit. 

We ordered Sarson wali Mahi Tikka and Tandoori Prawns for starters. The main course consisted of crisp, thin Butter Naans, Dal Makhni and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. The food was quite appetising except the Mahi Tikka which was evidently not Beckti (although they insisted it was).

The Tandoori Prawns and the Dal Makhni stood out. I am glad they have retained their standards.

This place is by far the most famous place when it comes to dining out at one of the restaurants in City Center. The ambience is good with a variety of options on the menu. I tried their Chinese and it was good. Found the prices to be a bit high though. Can be visited once in a blue moon not on a regular basis.

Just finish my dinner at Orko'ss. Heard a lot about this restaurant. All friends  said its over priced and reviews are not good, but honestly my today's dinner experience change my thought. 
from the beginning very warm welcome. Before giving the menu they give us cold towel which makes really a wow factor. water bottle served in cane basket gives also a nice fine dinning touch.
About food 1st time i tried Dahi kebab which sound surprising  but its really out of the blue, i think no other restaurant has served in Kolkata. After they have served orko's special Tegri kebab. which served with melted cheese which so much mouth watering. 
about other thing of the restaurant 
Decor very soothing
good instrumental music.
service very prompt
Quantity of food  decent enough.
tastes mouthwatering (specially kebab)

At the end i can say..... may be this restaurant is little over priced but if you pay 30to 40rs extra than other all restaurant in saltlake, you surely enjoy the best kebabs of kolkata. i want to give 5 of of 5 for their kebab.

To start off with, decent ambiance with soft instrumental music that hits the right notes. (Unlike a couple of other restaurants in city center mall which seem to think it pertinent to have  thumping discotheque music for their patrons).

Service is reasonably good.

Had the manchow soup which happens to be my soup of choice. Chef did a decent job. It was slightly better than your average manchow soup in kolkata.

The tandoori kabab was a real surprise. One of the best cooked and spiced kababs in more recent memory. It was tender, soft, cooked perfectly and had a melt in your mouth feel. 4/5 stars for it.  (The mint chutney accompanying it could have been a little better though.)

One down side: they have a noisy lounge next door that can irritate some patrons once in a while, when the common door is ajar.

I would recommend this restaurant as a 'can try'. I have had mixed reviews from friends but personally am quite willing to come again and explore more!

Bonus: They serve Fresh & Naturelle's signature Nalen Gur ice cream!

Went there only once some years ago and never again. Reason, they served rotten crab, when we complained, they taken back and returned after so much time (this time overcooked and taste was like only rat poison was missing) The big plate was decorated like we were in a heaven of food. Other items were below avarage in taste. Overall food, price, decor are big thumbs down. Do not go there even you are hungry..

I went to Orko'ss for dinner with my family on a very rainy night. All the other places were full so we had to try the new place in the block. The restaurant is spacious, well designed, the wooden furnishing add to its elegance. Also, next door was the lounge bar. You could go there for a quick groove while your food gets served. We requested for the sheekh kebab, pan fried fish and smirnoff large to go with the starters. I loved the fish, but they had done something really wrong with the kebab. The main course was a plain fried rice and noodles along with chilly chicken. The food seemed quite average to me. However, the quantity was great. Wouldn't mind paying another visit.

This place gets 2.5 and not 2 coz the ambience was somewhat appealing.

Food was OK but is SERIOUSLY overpriced for the quality. Service for me was OK. Just to costly for some place tucked away in a mall. The starters were nothing to write home about. The only thing that brought me in is the convenience factor as I was already in the mall and the quirky name.

Would avoid in future.

The decor in the picture is misleading. Its very small restaurant. We got Groupon voucher used at Orkoo's. The waiters don't know what is covered as part of Groupon and whenever they hear Gropuon their attention towards guests deteriorates. They needs to be educated that even in Groupon one need to buy these vouchers.
Coming to food, buffet spread is nothing special to talk about. It's pretty average. Food lying over there was ice cold. They need to arrange something to keep it warm. Also the tray was empty and one have to scrap bottom of the utensil for food. Most horrible dessert choice and lack sweetness.
Mocktail was the only positive and refreshing thing.
Will surely avoid this establishment in future and not recommend at all.

Bit surprised to see such low ratings ...may be in course of time the quality has been deteriorated. I visited almost 7 years back with my clients from US and colleagues   from my company (an IT giant in Sector V ). All of us enjoyed Indian cuisines (Biriyani,rotis and paneer as I can remember) accompanied by IMFLs! Our client seemed very happy ( we compensated our technical incompetence with this great dining experience !!!!). After diner I went to see them (the client) at Hyatt, where their accommodation was booked, and comfortably slept inside the the car after the heavy diner and booze, without wishing them good night. Such a embarrassment for me next day in the office !

One word that comes to my mind to summarise my experience : LOUSY!!!!!
We had decided to meet up for lunch on a weekday at City Centre. Zomato reviews helped us to decide on Kaafila. As luck would have it the joint was closed due to some unavoidable reason.Thus dragged ourselves reluctantly to this joint since they also serve drinks.
Ambiance and Decor: Pretty nice decor, dim lighting, piped music which was way too loud,comfortable seating.
Service: Not at all up to the mark.They have no idea about the dishes thus do NOT expect any recommendations from the staff. Certain items on the menu were not available.A BIG SHOCKER for a joint that charges fine dining prices and yet provides road side dhaba -take it or leave it service.Moreover they take ages to serve the food and even to serve the drinks.
Food: 
1. Mutton moghlai gosht: A light yellow coloured  thick gravy, garnished with boiled egg, slightly sweet in taste and comprised of 4-5 pieces of medium sized pieces of mutton. Or i prefer to say bones.Priced at Rs Rs 389/- the quantity was not adequate for two persons and taste was ordinary.
2. Mutton sheekh kebab: Minced meat cooked in tandoor. A traditional kebab .This was the only saving grace of the whole saga. Priced at Rs 399/- the dish had six pieces of kebabs.
3. Sarsonwali Mahi Tikka: This dish was another let down. It comprised of beckty(supposedly, maybe basa who knows) fillet marinated in our good old bengali kasundi(mustard sauce) and cooked in a tandoor. Sounds enticing but believe me it was not.The flavour of the dish was somewhat lacking.At Rs 419/- the dish comprises of 5 cubes of fish and was another waste.
4. Butter naan and the roomali roti was thankfully well made and not chewy.
The Margarita cocktail served in a salt rimmed cocktail glass was spot-on. At Rs 350/- glass i would say it was pretty reasonable.
To sum up , a place not worth a visit at all. Do drop in only when you have no other option and tons of cash to blow over a lousy dining experience.

 But for the big team size we have(50 plus) i think it got bit chaotic. For smaller group it is just fine.
Coming to food, it was fine. Nothing like out of the world, but with the price they charge, i feel it's value for money.

This is the most pathetic place to visit.I would like to share an incident with everyone.
We were 5 friends who went out there to enjoy a weekend.We did not order for any food items.Only taqilla shots and whisky.
They billed us Rs 15,000.

When we checked the bill we found that the taqila shots which we had they charged double as they provided us the Large Ones,although we never ordered that.The waiter also did not inform us.and we told them specifically while ordering that whatever is there in the menu card we will have them only.
The staffs were rude and forced us to pay.The manager was the worse.He don't know English properly also and how to behave with customers.

I will never ever go there or will refer any of my friends.

If they provide free food or drinks also,I wont go there.........

they are cheaters in one word

Had heard a lot about this place. But it somehow could not make its mark. We went there for the buffet and were disappointed.. The food lacks consistency.. Few dishes were good but the others not worth it.. Some comments on the items - The Chicken Starter had bones, the soup was not at all good, naan was hard to chew.. The chicken preparation was a failure.. Smelled of excessive vinegar.. I suppose.. The only thing I liked was the Gulab Jamun and Gajar ka Halwa. Decor is good.. Instrumental Rabindra Sangeet was being played..which is good.. but did not suit the ambience. Overall, an average exprience.. Not worth the money..

The decor is average and that was the best part of the lunch buffet. The starters were average chicken starter was with bone. The salt and peper fish was good and thankfully we did have much of an appetite left for the main course. Main course was mutton biryani which had a very strong smell of spices, chicken curry was poor quality and i did not have the heart to try rohu fish in mustard. I had roti wiith dal but that is something for which i would advise you to spend around 500 bucks. Overall a very tasteless experience.

Orko's, when it started, back then it was a place to rejoice for quality food and ambiance. Last time when I went there with my friend who came to Kolkata for the first time actually had a mixed feeling about this place. At first they took the order but kept us waiting for a long time to serve the food. We had Pomfret Tandoori and chicken kebabs in starter with vodka which was delicious followed by Murgh Roganjosh with Nan which was very spicy in the main course. Price is quite on the higher side so it's not that pocket friendly tag you get to see here. Over all a so so place with big hefty price tag on their menu as compared to the food.

This is one of the few restaurants that turned out to be a big disappointment for me and my family.  To put it reeeeally simply: The waiters don't know how to talk or behave politely. The food isn't all that great. ...but the amount you'll end up paying for practically appetizers could get u tickets to a cricket match. Waste of time, appetite and money.

Orkos is a good place for Mouth Watering Kebabs. The combination of cheese with authentic Kebabs makes it a good kebab joint. It is nice place for a laid back dinner and drink. You can make your self comfortable in the cushioned sofa. The interiors gives you a feel of private dining.However, the place is a bit expensive as a joint for Indian food. The biriyani is a bit too spicy ( for not so spice lovers). Nothing to complain about the service and the ambience. Good location for people living in and around salt lake. 

Pocket pinch (1600 for two persons, without alcohol)

Recommended for its starters

I wish there was negative star rating on Zomato because this restaurant deserves it. I  never had such pathetic Chinese food in my whole life. The roadside stalls serve better Chinese than this place. More than that, the price they charge is abnormally exorbitant (almost similar to that of Mainland China). The service is pathetic. I believe there should be a board hanging outside: "If you are an idiot, enter at your own risk"

It was just horrible to be there. The management has cheated us by serving the disgusting food on the table though they were supposed to have buffet. The behaviour of the staffs were as if they were doing a favour on us by serving the food. Overall the quantity, quality and taste of the foods are all much below usual standards. Chicken kabab with bone and only one variety of vanilla scoop ice cream was just a way to harass. Lastly cards were not accepted an we have to arrange for the cash itaelf. If someone planning to have their food out there please donot kindly waste your time n mood.
