Delicious icecreams and superb thick shakes - as fresh and as natural as it can be.. Drop in and satisfy your taste buds.. 

Two news flavours launched today - #IMLI & the exotic #BLACKTRUFFLE .. They both are yum!! 

Thanks a ton #KunalPabrai for your gracious hospitality and that big gift hamper of icecreams that I am probably going to feast on for weeks to come.. 😅

Journey of an #EpicureanCineTrotter continues..

One of my favourite ice-cream hub ! Their ice-creams are silky smooth. Offering you a huge range to chose from my favourites are nolen Gur ice-Cream, tender coconut and sitafal ( seasonal).  If you love ice-cream as I do , Pabrai's is a must visit.

The place of real flavours.
Before pabrai’s I was always very skeptical on picking up ice cream flavours apart from the very safe chocolate or vanilla but this place made me go cray over the other flavours.
Pabrai’s is a heaven for ice cream lovers If they want to stick to the original flavours. They offer flavours ranging from the very famous nolen gur to coconut to gondhoraj to lemon grass to strawberry to chiku to south special filter coffee and many more. And with a blind fold on you you can tell the flavour with one one bite.
Brownie point :
Pocket pinch is just perfect 
Also they have come up with their shakes and coffee range, which is a must try .

A small outlet located near paddapukur. There speciality nalen gur ice cream is worth mentioning. Besides, gondhoraj ice cream was fantastic too. South indian coffee and rabrai malai was good enough but not fantastic. Staff was friendly and helpful. If you are an ice cream lover, do visit this place to taste their innumerable flavours at cheapest prices.

I totally love their ice creams...its smooth and light. The flavours are subtle and just a right balance. 
My personal favourite is Gondhoraj lemon. 

If you have not tried this place you should take out sometime and definitely give this a try.

Just the way, we all love to 'scream' for 'Ice Cream'... delving into a spoonful is perhaps the best way to treat the cravings for the same,  so as to pamper the tastebuds with some mellifluous masterstroke, which not only leave you mesmerized but let you linger with some pristine delight, and utter euphoria!! 😃
And to opt for the same, what one can't give a miss,  is to walk-in at 
"Pabrai's Fresh & Naturelle Ice Creams"

With the assimilation of 100% Fresh & Natural ingredients, they do stand out of the crowd anyday, eventually being a pioneer when it comes to the art of crafting a wonderful scoop of Love....😃
Yes, that's what exactly the other name of the Ice-Creams they have in their store!! 

While the patrons bearing an affinity for the tangy taste is sure to fall for the 'Tamarind/Imly' flavour anyday...
the sweet-toothed afficionados are sure to find their ultimate palate in some 'Strawberry' and 'Natural Chocolate' indeed,    eventually indulging in to some perfect justice to fulfill the cravings for the same. 

When it comes to some perfectly balanced subtle flavours, the ones that deserve a standing ovation are 'Gondhoraj Lebu(King of Lime)' and the 'Tender Coconut'..
the smooth and consistent subtlety being the perfect reason to leave the tastebuds bewildered with joy and a flattering glee on the face alongwith! 😃

To experience some real dark flavour, the 'South Indian Filter Coffee' is a sheer bliss for sure, and a must have anyday, specially if you are a coffee lover! 
And to get a real burst of tingling and refreshing notes,  nothing beats the 'Paan' flavour, be it to conclude a meal with some sweet anecdote or to simply have some rollercoaster that your tastebuds deserved so long!! 😃

And amidst all the other mouthwatering flavours, here comes the signature one that makes the brand a kind of its own...

"Pabrai's Special Nolen Gur Ice-Cream"!! 
Perhaps, a taste....words are not enough to explain!! 😍😃

Talking about the latest feather on the cap of the brand.. they have launched "DARK TRUFFLE ICE-CREAM"...
A signature flavour,  and the most expensive Ice-Cream till date(300INR/scoop,Taxes as applicable). 
And so far the Indian Ice-Cream brands are concerned, it is available only at the Pabrai's outlets currently! 😃

Note : Apart from the Paddapukur outlet, they have three more branches in Kolkata at 'Prince Anwarshah Road', 'City Center 1' and 'Bangur'.

Happy Eating! 😊

I can't resist giving 5 to this outlet. Ice- creams are something that none can resist , and Pabrai' s is the name to reckon in the world of ice creams with stores all over India. But it all began in Kolkata. They owned the famous Tulika ice cream brand and the Pabrai's brand is mostly associated with ice creams that are made with fresh and natural ingredients and seasonal fruits. They are continuously experimenting with new flavours . 
Nolen Gur Ice cream is something that has almost achieved cult status and is something that everyone needs to try.
I tried a new flavour, tamarind or imli and really fell in love with it. This was indeed something totally out of the box.
They are also introducing ' black truffle ' flavour, the ingredient is being imported from France and by far will be the costliest ice cream available there. ( ₹300/- per scoop), having a very distinct taste, you can try this.

Pabrai’s is the best place to have ice creams that are completely natural and organic. You can feel the natural essence filling your tastebuds with its natural goodness. There are some amazing flavours to choose from like South Indian Coffee, Paan, Gondhoraaj lebu, Imli, Dark Truffle, and my pesonal favourite- Natural chocolate. feel the chill of Natural Ice Cream in all weathers and all seasons.

I must say I have never had better tasting and creamy ice cream before. Visited the outlet near my big fat belly. Tried two of their signature ice creams which were:
1. TENDER COCONUT-- A white scoop of heaven was the very phrase I used while having this. Filled with lots of small and tender pieces of coconut made the experience tastier. 
2. NALEN GUR-- This was my first nalen gur ice cream and I absolutely loved it. Extremely tasty and it definitely reached foodgasm level 101. They topped it with nalen gur which made it even better.
This particular outlet has a good seating area. Also their staff were courteous and their service was very prompt. 
RECOMMENDATION-- Nalen gur ice cream.Refer to my account for more pictures and reviews.

I went here in hope of finding good fruit ice cream like the famous Natural' a ice cream. Ordered Kesari Rabdi and Sitafal Ice creams. I was surprised by their price, Rs. 81 per scoop!! That's far more than Bombay's Natural Ice cream. Anyways, I would not have minded if the taste was exceptional, but Sitafal ice cream was average and too hard. And Kesari Rabdi was good but had a Hair in it!!!! I was shocked..they replaced it but didn't even say Sorry once.

I recommend it's tender coconut ice cream.

I tasted the tender coconut and nolen gur flavours, and both were great. If you have a sweet tooth, pabrais is a must visit place for you. Sad they don't have many outlets, but it's definitely worth travelling some distance for it.

For all our late nights, mood swings and bittersweet conversations, ice creams at Pabrai's have held an important ground! From the delectable Nolen Gur and the Tender Coconut flavours to the Paan and the South Indian Filter Coffee, the ice creams are a constant source of innocent joyfulness! A brownie point for the folks who tend to you with all smiles even when you are a little Saturday night high or when you simply wanna taste two dozen flavours before taking your pick!

They have the usual flavours like chocolate hazel nut and chocolate brownie and also natural fruity ice cream like the watermelon. If you are a nolan gur fan then should go there as it is famous for its nolan gur ice cream. Apart from that I also really liked the south Indian coffee flavour.

The best thing about this ice cream parlour is that the ice creams are made up of natural things. When we went there we were just clueless about what to taste. The staff was so good that he made us taste 9-10 of their flavours and they genuinely tasted so natural. The coconut malai, paan, gondhoraj lemon, custard Apple, nolen gur are some of them. We had brownie with ice cream and chocolate fudge and they tasted awesome. Ambience is good, staff is friendly and lastly you can leave a message for them which you can stick on their wall.

nalen gur- the best flavour indeed and yes its their signature flavour extracted from jaggery , they are proud to tell you about the flavour being  a monopoly....i highly recommend this one.

paan - this was also one of the bestest flavour and yes you will find finest crushed paan filling inside your icecream.it will give you a feeling of paan as u start having it.  this has to be in your list too.

mascarpone cheese and candid fruits-this flavour had minute pieces of fruits alike tuty fruity. had higher expectations from this flavour but it was a normal one...

anyways there were lots of varieties in their list and wanted to have more but i think prices are too high for just one scoop around 70 to 100 bucks with taxes.   no doubt they have made a benchmark but they should get a cut in their prices.
     i definately recommend nalen gur and paan flavours here.....

As we are foodies and we love to have different cuisine and desserts.
I found this place at par with naturals ice cream chain
We had tasted 2-3 flavours before finalizing it.
But then we tasted Nalen Gur .
It was out of the world.
The best indian flavor I ever had.
Will definitely visit the place again whenever I come back to Kolkata

I will rate this place 4.5/5

I had heard a lot of good things about this ice cream chain with a difference but I could never make it here. We went from office as boss suggested a dessert outing on a Saturday. He is a big fan of this place.

The ambience is bright, modern and colourful, typical of an ice cream parlour. The space is large. A space on the wall carries patrons' feedback on stick-it notes. That's cool and Imaginative!

Four of us ordered four flavours. Nolen Gur, Rabdi Malai, Tender Coconut (myself) and Natural Vanilla (boss' favourite). One may get it served in paper bowl or in-house waffle cone (costs extra).

The huge line-up of flavours is overwhelming! A new visitor will have a difficult time to zero in on a flavour. They have a wide selection of natural fruit flavours and Indian flavours (which is their USP) apart from other categories.

I heard a lot of praise about Tender Coconut and it lived up to it. The large scoop (one serving) was full of tiny pieces of tender coconut. It's way better than what I had of Rollick's.

I regret not having ordered Nolen Gur. Maybe I didn't because it wasn't the season. But I had one spoon of it from my colleague and it was sublime! I felt the granular nolen gur and that made a difference. I realised why my boss says nobody makes it as good as Pabrai's. They pour real nolen gur on the ice cream too and I have heard one can request for a more generous pour. I would definitely like to have it in winter for the finest taste.

Boss ordered one scoop of Natural Vanilla in cone for each to carry as we went out. It's good and not high on sugar but not worth writing home about.

I would definitely like to come back for the natural fruit flavours and some other select flavours (like South Indian Filter Coffee and Paan).

Our favourite when it comes to ice cream. They serve the best natural flavoured ice cream and what innovative flavours they have come up with. Superb! Our favourite so far has been jamun and melon. Even their south indian coffee flavour is to die for. Highly recommended if you visit Kolkata. And the best part is that they are open till midnight which makes it our absolute favourite for late night saunters like us. :-)

Can Ice-cream BE any better?😅 Pabrai has certainly been on my bucket list for quite a while now and yes, I have been waiting to visit this place earnestly... It has absolutely matched my expectations.. When u get bored with the chocolate, vanilla, black forest and strawberry monotone, do visit pabrai... It offers flavours which make ur palate go overboard in joy. I tried these flavours...
Nolen gur- Hands down, this flavour will bring out the bangali in u who craves for fresh gur on a chilly winter night. It is served with a generous helping of nolen gur in the liquid form itself which sweeps u off ur feet.
Paan-- To anyone reading my review, please have this if not anything else at pabrai. It is the minty and refreshing taste of mishti paan which cleanses ur palate and makes u love food itself. Beautiful innovation😇
Tender coconut -- Another flavour which is out of this world. Ideal to name it tender coconut because the one adjective to describe this flavour is tender. This flavour has a taste of fresh and delicate coconut. This ice cream was truly a touch of pure and pleasant sophisticacy.
So yes.. Full marks to pabrai. And definitely this is going to be my much frequented spot. Looking forward to tasting all of their wonderful flavours😬

Been here 1st time and tried different ice creams, Specially liked their nolen gur, daab and gandhoraj lemon ice cream. It's completely different experience to try their delicious scoops of ice cream. Moreover pocket friendly :) Go ahead and enjoy!!

Ice Cream is a dessert which is Grand. I love the concept of ice cream parlors. A lot could actually happen over ice cream as well. And this place celebrates ice cream. With unique natural flavors, it is loyal to being natural, seasonal, and Kolkata. From experiencing brilliant Pan and Filter Coffee flavors to very mesmerizing Alfonso, Gandharaj Lemon and Falsa (sorbet). The Salted Carmel is brilliant. The service is great and the staff bonds well with you and helps you a lot to identify what you are looking for. You are more than certain to find the right pick. My favorites (other than the above) Lemongrass, Anjir, Caramel Crunch, Jamun and the Nalen Gur.
Don't just go for the usual chocolate pick, try the brilliant natural flavors.

This paddapukur outlet of Pabrai is a bigger one than the other outlets and it has seating arrangements. While passing through it we decided to end our meal at a sweet note with their icecream. I have always been a fan of their nolen gur ice cream but in this summer season we decided to try out the fruity flavours as they add fruit pulps into ice creams. We ordered alphanso mango and watermelon flavours. This time to our surprise we liked the watermelon one more. But the Alphanso mango was creamy and melting in our mouth. One thing to mention: I loved the decor of this outlet, they decorated a mirror with colourful sticky notes of the icecream lovers.

Ice cream was excellent but we had ordered here and the delivery was terrible. The packet with the ice cream cups had dry ice in it only. DRY ICE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHED. But the ice cream was with the dry ice and while taking out, I got hurt. Dry ice is supposed to be packed separately. Please look into this. It's a serious matter.

Your tastebuds would thank you for making the visit to pabrai's. One of the best very best icecream joints in the city, where you get a unique variety of icecreams flavours at affordable rates. You have flavours starting from pan, chikoo, tender coconut, nolen gur, kesar pista, mango, rose etc. Must try are Pan, Tender coconut, Nolen Gur and Kesar Pista.

Have you ever desired to visit a world full of ice creams? This place is synonymous to that desire.
Yes,I'm not exaggerating a bit.The ambience is so colourful and do is the ice-creams over there,with huge range of variety that will soothe your taste buds.
If you are a ice-cream lover then it's a place you should visit.The nolen gurer ice cream,bubble gum and the brownie ice cream were the ones we tried and none of the flavors were disappointing.But the nolen gur flavor was the most delicious one.
To sum it up!

Pabrai's is a brand that has become synonymous with Ice Cream for the fresh and tender creamy goodness with so many varieties on the plate! I personally love their Nolen Gur, Paan, and Tender Coconut flavours the most! Also, if you're a lover of caffeine, try their South Indian Coffee flavour. If you haven't tried these at this place, you really need to rush soon, especially with the temperature rising pretty steadily!

Are you a Ice cream lover?? Still not have been here?? Believe me guys, you are missing something, that is really worthy! been there few days ago. The store located near the Padmapukur Bus stop. Come, lets explore a whole new Ice cream world!

Positive point -

1. Freshness - All the ice creams are made of natural products, which is really rare nowadays.

2. Flavour - They had a huge varieties in this field. Some flavours are like old time classical and somes are like rare, that you hardly found in a normal ice cream parlour.

3. Pricing - Price tag of all the flavours are quite decent one. So you can try as much you desire.

Negative point -

Seriously speaking, I don't find any negative point there.

These are the some flavours we tried -

1. Paan - Woww, in one word. Awesome in taste, too much refreshing. Each time you give a bite, you feel like a having a 'Mitha paan' orginally.

2. Orange basil - Feels like orange ice cream but the basil leaf in it, adds some different taste in it. Tastes good.

3. Lemon Grass - Very refreshing, quite different in taste! Go for it, if you like some flavour beyond regular flavours. We take it in a waffle cone and it tastes too good.

4. Kesaria Rabri Malai - Ice cream in Rabri flavour! Wow, these guys really did a hard homework here. Tastes like original rabri and tastes heavenly with waffle cone with chocolate dip. Sweet in nature, yet too unique in mouth. very much recommended here.

In conclusion, I will say Unique taste and good pricing is the main UPS here. Come here and have the ice cream of your own demand, I am sure that these guys will surely melts your heart down by their natural flavour.

Located close to elgin, this place was in our wishlist for so long! One scorching afternoon we could finally visit this place and satisfy our icecream cravings to our heart's content! We tried the following 7 flavours from here-

1)Nolen gur (4/5)- the signature flavour here! One can not miss out on this one! They serve it with a drizzle of real nolen gur, making the taste even more flavourful! Recommended!

2)Tender coconut(3.5/5)- I would recommend trying this one out first ,if one is here to try many flavours,as it's taste is really light just as a real tender coconut has! Since I tried this one after the nolen gur flavour, I couldn't enjoy the flavour in my first spoonful!

3)Gandharaj lebu(4.5/5)- I bet there can't be an icecream with a stronger flavour of the gandharaj lemon than this one! Lemon fans can surely go for it!

4)Watermelon(2/5)- this was disappointing as I could hardly find any similarity in taste with that of a watermelon! I was heartbroken because the nolen gur and godhoraj lemon had set really high standards... Nevertheless let's move on to the next flavour

5)Paan(5/5)- full marks to this icecream!! This has got to be my favourite icecream ever...no toppings added, no add ons- no flavoured water- just the icecream in itself will blow your mind away and take your heart with it!! It's pure love and no words can Ever describe the freshness of the taste! Actually, I found it even more flavourful than a banarasi pan!!SUPERB is the word!

6)kesariya rabri malai(2.5/5)- another disappointment !That too after a flavour like paan! I somehow feel that the flavouring was alright -just that the icecream could be sweeter!When I had my first spoonful, I don't know why I got the taste of biryani, my friend told me it's the flavour of 'kewra jal' used in biryani! So ,I feel had the sweetness been more I would have actually enjoyed it...and guess what ?They also have a sugar less variant of the same flavour! I can't imagine it getting any less sweet!!

7)caramel crunch(4/5)- a really good flavour to end the day with! The flavour is strong- tastes very similar to a caramel chocolate! "Mahalacto" was the first word that I had uttered after tasting a spoonful of it! Caramel lovers must try this one! Pabrai's is really good at this!

What amazes me is the strong flavouring of the ice-creams ,sans any toppings(especially the paan,g andharaj lemon and even the caramel crunch)!! Having said that, their price range is extremely affordable compared to the other natural icecream selling brands! Really enjoyed myself a lot here and would love to visit them again and again to try all their flavours!!

Their ice cream has redefined the flavour of paan. Nolen Gur in a hot and sultry summer afternoon never tasted  and felt so mouth watering and sumptuous. Well in my childhood days I had Tulika's Ice cream but this transition  is mind blowing.

Being, in all probability, the best ice-cream parlour in this city, Pabrai's needs no introduction. We had this place on our wishlist for a long time and finally, we could make it here. It is located opposite to Hotel Samilton near Forum Mall and hence, it is very easy to spot. We had ordered Gandharaj Lemon, Paan, Pabrai's Nalen Gur, Tender Coconut, Watermelon, Caramel Crunch, Kesaria Rabri Malai.

Gandharaj Lemon(4.5/5): It had a strong flavour of Gandharaj Lemon. The ice-cream was of a very good quality which made it even better. Highly recommended!

Tender Coconut (4/5): This one was a light flavoured ice-cream. It tasted so similar to the raw coconut kernel. Just a tip, have this before having a stronger flavour, otherwise, this might taste bland. Recommended!

Watermelon (3/5): The only disappointing thing I experienced here was while having this flavour of ice-cream. It tasted somewhat syrupy and lacked the original flavour by far. It did not taste like a watermelon at all. Hence, this flavour won't be a recommended one.

Caramel Crunch(4/5): It tasted exactly like Maha Lacto. Irrespective of your liking or disliking the toffee, you are surely going to like the ice-cream flavour. Recommended!

Kesaria Rabri Malai(4/5): This one tasted so similar to a Rabri Malai. The presence of Kesar and Nutmeg was evident. Recommended!

Pabrai's Nalen Gur(4.5/5): Probably the best nalen gur ice-cream of Kolkata is being served here. It was a perfect blend of sandesh, ice-cream and a lot of nalen gur on top. It tasted heavenly. Highly recommended!

Paan(5/5): A must-try flavour. It feels as if you are having chilled mishti paan. This was seriously the best out of all the 7 flavours we had tried. Don't miss out on this flavour at least. You don't really visit Pabrai's and come out without trying the Paan flavoured ice-cream.

In this kind of scorching weather, this is the place to be. All the flavours are 100% pure and natural. It is way cheaper than the Mama Mia or Gelato Italiano outlets. The flavours available here are somewhat more in number and better too. Hence, this place is a must visit for all.

Pabrai's ranges up to a vast variety of flavors and the quality is pretty good considering the price being quite reasonable. I prefer the chocolate macadamia and da natural chocolate. It's for the chocolate lovers. The pan flavor is quite a controversial one and is a pabrai's special. The chocolate hazelnut is also recommended...

In recent times,our 'City of Joy' has witnessed a flurry of ice-cream parlours but 'Pabrai's Fresh and Naturelle' stands above all of them.

This outlet of Pabrai's is located near Paddapukur just opposite to Azad Hind Dhaba.This outlet is spacious and fully air-conditoned which is in rare contrast with their Saltlake outlet.

We went here on Tuesday at 2.30 pm. We got two seats immediately. The decor was nice and the walls were adorned with laminated paper cuts highlighting the store's success till date.We tasted 2-3 flavors and placed our order.

We went for nolen gur ice-cream and chocolate hazelnut in chocolate dipped waffle cone. The nolen gur was delicious. We felt as if it had actual nolen gurer rosogolla in it.It was topped with nolen gur which made it even more delicious. The chocolate hazelnut was also delicious. The combination with the cone was a fantastic one.I loved it.

The staff was well behaved and cordial. All in all,it was a great experience and I will definitely visit again.

Small ice-cream parlor with limited seating options. We had opted for flavours tender coconut, alphonso and mescarpone cheese with candied fruits. Among these, tender coconut was a clear stand-out for me. There is nothing like the flavour of 'dab' on a hot summer afternoon, nesting in the creaminess of an ice-cream. It was both delicious and refreshing. Alphonso was also pretty good. But a big let-down was mescarpone. Despite of being the most expensive among the three scoops, it was lacklustre. All I could taste was the over-powering sweetness of the candied fruits.
This place has a variety of interesting flavours like gondho raj lebu and pan. Might be back to check them out.   
Update: the gondho raj lebu is a must-try. It tastes like sweet lemonade. Also the almond one is pretty good.

This place is located beside AR Digital in the paddapukur area. Decided to get some ice cream on my parent's anniversary, but when it comes to choosing ice cream flavors they're quite old-fashioned and love to stick with the conventional vanilla, chocolate and 2in1s. So initially I was in dilemma but managed to buy 2 flavors -
1) Bru South Indian coffee rich in its aroma {goes well with some chocolate sauce on it to make it sweet} which my loved it
2) And my dad was fond of the Mango flavor

Flavors are original it's an ice cream and not a frozen dessert (like walls containing vegetable oil as preservatives) So quite healthy as well since 
they serve some sugar free variants for the diabetics. Would be visiting the place soon to try out the other flavors as well!!

Oh how much I had heard of this place before actually visiting it on Saturday night! A must visit for all the ice cream lovers in the city!!
Our orders- Paan,Trendy Coconut,Kesariya sugar free and the Queen of all the flavors served here,the Nolen Gur.
My personal fav' was the Paan but all the rest were equally good. The Paan flavor would keep you perplexed between "if it's an ice paan" and "if it's an ice cream".
The Kesariya sugar free was absolutely balanced in the sweetness.
The trendy coconut would entirely woo you with the flavor of coconut and as it melts in your mouth you would get actual grated coconut.
And finally, as the peeps out there say: the Nolen Gur one is just DIVINE!! Before serving, a spatula of molten nolen gur would be spread on the ice cream.This adds color and enhance the taste.
Ambience- A small tidy dessert parlour with seating arrangements.
Service- Very streamlined, no complaints, polite staff and definitely quick despite of continuous rush.
As we savour the richness on a hot n' sultry Sat night the Rain-God decides to surprise us with a sudden heavy shower. The felicity just got doubled!The moment was just perfect with ice cream inside and rain outside.
Would be back soon to Pabrai with my Beau! :)

Being an ardent lover of ice cream, Pabrai would be any dessert lover's paradise. I was already in love with them since I tasted some of their flavours first at the City centre outlet. Recently checked into the Sarat bose road one which is quite spacious. Normal decor. They have a huge variety to select from including fruit flavours, bengali specials and top flavours. Had their paan and caramel in a cup along with the friend. The paan ice cream simply bowled me over. Apart of the strong creamy delight, there were tiny pieces of paan leaves blended with the ice cream which tasted magnificent. Surely going to taste their other flavours one by one. Just go and grab some!

I am a dessert-nut. And ice cream is one of my top favs. But unlike most people, it's not simply the sweetness and coldness of this ubiquitous favourite that gives me the kick, it is the variations you can do with it. And so, Pabrai's, with it's shockingly varied range of flavours, has been a place I have been wanting to go for a while. And so I did, with a group of friends, just as the mercury started rising and the ice cream craving started building up within us. 
We tried an array of flavours, focusing mainly on the unconventional. Of the flavours we tried, some of the standouts were the Gondhoraj and Daab, which were amazingly refreshing. We also loved the rose flavour which was subtle but not overpowering. The salted caramel ice cream was just as it should be, not too sweet, with a touch of savouriness. The apple pie too was amazing, with a dominant cinnamon flavour, and I'm pretty sure I felt some shortbread crumbs in it as well to mimic the crust of the pie. The vanilla and wasabi however, were a letdown. The vanilla ice cream did not have a strong vanilla flavour as I had been expecting while the wasabi ice cream lacked the punch needed. 
There are still a lot of flavours left to try, including all of the chocolate ice creams and their famous nolen gur ice cream. Nevermind, that's all the more reason to go back to this amazing gourmet ice cream parlour over, and over, and over again.

Breach of trust.

I had placed my order through Zomato for home delivery.Firstly I received my order half an hour late more than the estimated delivery time.Second most important thing on opening my order I saw there was  one item missing i.e I ordered for 2 Bubblegum scoops but I found only one scoop.Till the moment I could have returned the order the delivery boy left my place.
Then I gave a call to the resturant they told they would credit my money back to me.After sometime I got my money back but that isnt at all what I expect from such a esteemed company.
Its my sincere request to all that please check your orders carefully before you allow the delivery boy to go.If such things would happen then no one would like to place home delivery.
I being a tourist if gets such kind of review then its just heights.Its just a shame for such a renowned company.

A straight 5 from my side on an outlet after many days ! And it's for none other than Pabrai's - the place that makes the best ice-cream in Kolkata by my standards. 
Myself along with my wife, while coming back home last week after having dinner in a nearby place, tried out their one of a kind ice cream flavors - Chandan and Gondhoraj, which we wished would never end. We were dumbstruck figuring out that such desserts existed on earth which would give you an aftertaste and smell of pure sandlewood and kaafir lime.
Also, to mention, the owners of the place were courteous enough to bear my request to let me taste many of their best flavors like the Nolen Gur, Mango, Strawberry etc to name a few.
To conclude, in plain simple words, for me if it's ice cream from now on, it will only be from Pabrai's.

If you are in Calcutta, you should know that Bengalis are very finicky about food specially desserts. We are always looking for something new in desserts but we can't compromise on quality. Some good people came up with this ice cream parlour. The flavours are simply amazing. Must try - NolenGur ice cream, Pan ice cream . The quality is brilliant & the quantity is quite succulent.

Heard a lot about their nolen gur iceam, so choose to visit this place. Having a sweet tooth,  I loved it, while other's found it too sweet. Other flavours we tried were crunchy caramel, chocolate brownie,Chocolate macadamia, Chocolate fudge Sundae and Salted caramel.
One must try Salted caramel,paan flavour, nolen gur flavour along with crunchy caramel, chocolate fudge sundae.

Amazing place for ice-cream lovers. They have variety of flavours ranging from hazelnut chocolate to nolen gur to ginger and honey. I have tried the nolen gur, coconut n paan (a must to try) flavours. They also arrange for good packing if you want to take it home (I traveled for an hour taking the ice-cream but it didn't melt).

Pabrai......  This is a place where we visit whenever possible.. the flavors..the rawness...the texture of the icecream.. highly appreciable!! To capture the raw taste of the fruits or paan or gur or whatever..thats not easy..its not just adding fruit pieces to it.. 
its just something too awesome to experience that kind of thing..
My favorite.. Nolen Gur icecream *_*
Others flavours which i loved.. Paan,watermelon,tender coconut and obviously gaandharaj and chandan :*
Rest which i had.. south indian coffee,wasabi,orange basil, bubblegum.
All of them are worth having..:)will have to taste the rest..

Vanilla, Chocolate Chip, the fruity flavours like Anjeer, Muskmelon, paan, mascarpone and cheese, then bubblegum, nalen gur, chocolate brownie icecream, chocolate macademia are some of the ones of my choice (photos not attached though) What I liked about them that they don't get annoyed if you want to try out the flavours before ordering a scoop. Both taste and look wise all the above mentioned flavours have pleased my taste buds and eyes. Well lit spacious appealing decor, servicing is also satisfying. Among the two sundaes- the brownie with ice cream has been customised by me with a scoop of chocolate brownie ice cream which tasted even better. But the hot choc fudge sundae has more indianised flavour with the cashewnut toppings. This place has always satisfied my sweet tooth and I would recommend all to try out this place many a times.

My favourite being paan, coffee, lemon grass, tender coconut. My friend tried the apple pie flavour which felt like eating an apple pie per se. If you haven't tried yet please visit it soon!!

I had brought sugarfree kesaria rabri malai ice cream from this outlet. Every member of my family enjoyed having it. The ice cream was very tasty and so rich in flavours. It was creamy and you will love it when you will have it. I will definately try their other flavours too but whenever i will visit this place i will make it a point to have this flavour. This kesaria rabri malai won my heart.

This is the best place to go to for ice creams now in Kolkata. A shop with amazing variety with healthy options and very reasonably priced choices. The nolen gur ice cream is the best, and the South Indian coffee flavour is brilliant as well. The paan and bubblegum both were extremely tasty as well.

This particular place has taken the ice cream experience for Calcuttans to whole new level! Their innovative flavours and delicious natural ice creams is a treat for the taste buds. The first outlet they opened is this one, the Chakraberia one.
It's a tiny place with a few stools scattered around, but tbh I have never seen it empty.

Some of my absolutely favourite flavours are:
🔸Nolen Gur'er Ice Cream
🔸Paan
🔸Salted Caramel
🔸Lemon Grass

If you haven't tried yet, go ahead. Enjoy! If nothing else, do try their Nolen Gur one. It's top notch.

My top picks are -
1)Mascarpone cheese & candied fruits.
2)Tender coconut
3)Anjeer
4)Paan
5)South Indian cofee

Pabrai's was in my wishlist since long. I was in the locality yesterday and in spite of being quite full, didn't want to miss a chance to try their famous Nalen gur flavored ice cream.

The shop is a small one with few stools and a large display counter. The ice cream scores 5/5. I was quite apprehensive about the flavor of "gur" in an ice-cream but boy! how wrong I was! Loved it totally!

Service and decor both have rooms for improvement.

Price: Little on the higher side.

Recommended!

Gist : Good but not extraordinary. Service should be far far better.

I visited this place on 22.12.16 around 2.00 PM. Easy to locate. Small place, max 6 people can eat while sitting, standing 10 more. Had 0.5 L Anjeer Ice cream. That was given in a prepacked box. We were two persons so asked for another plate or bowl for sharing but they denied. Service was colder than the ice cream! Also ice cream lacked bit of materials at that price (Around INR 300 you can get branded ice cream of 1.5L). Will try other flavors and update rating again if required.

Truly a heaven for ice cream lovers. Wanted to try Pabrai's ice creams since a long time and finally got the chance today. A cute little kiosk near Lansdowne paddapukur. Tried their sugar free rose ice cream, nolen gur ice cream, gandharaj lemon ice cream. My mother just loved all of them. I haven't been able to make her this much happy before with any other ice cream. The price was pretty reasonable too. The staff at the counter was very courteous and helpful. A beautiful experience. Made my day.. :D

I went there on a summer evening with 2 friends. And if I need to describe this place in one word , it would be ' Fantabulous' . There are varieties of flavours available from unconventional flavours like lemon grass, tender coconut, paan etc to traditional flavours like vanilla, chocolate etc .
I tried 14 kinds, according to me the best were - 1) Mascarpone cheese & Candid fruits , 2) Tender coconut , 3) Anjeer, 4) paan, 5) Bubble gum, south Indian coffee , nolengur etc.

Though price is on the heavy side, but food lovers must try it once to enjoy the uniqueness. I can guarantee that no one would regret.

After having lunch we thought of having Ice creams and decided to come here....

Located at the opposite of Pantaloons outlet near elgin road crossing..

Tried r types pf flavoured "natural" ice creams.

"Nolen Gur" is the finest of all. Mouth melting excellent flavour. A must try if you go there.

"Paan" flavour is also excellent...

After having those two flavours we wanted more and tried....

"Chocolate Hazzlenut" which was very good and tasty.

"Bubblegum" was also a nice flavour if you like the sweetness more..

Pricing was good but quantity need some improvement.

A must visit place for ice cream lovers. It closes at 1pm, a boon for late night food hoppers . A lot of variety is present in their stock . The cost is a bit on higher side but you can shell out that much for the quality. The pan flavor is exotic, one can u can crave for. Tried pan lemon grass, coconut nolen gur which is their signature ice cream. Also chocolate macadamia is fantastic, my favorite one.

This place was long overdue for my visit. Came here yesterday after dinner with family. Tried two of the varieties - the signature Nolen Gurer Ice Cream and Tender Coconut. Also had the Wasabi one for sampling.
Nolen Gurer Ice Cream - It was excellent in one word. Tasted like the country side home made Nolen Gur and was treated with the Jhola Gur as well. Divine it was!
Tender Coconut - Very nice and subtle flavours of tender coconut while bits of coconut will fall in your mouth. A must have!
Wasabi - I was particularly interested as it was a really unique flavour. But it was okayish at the end although tasted great when you try it first.
Overall a good experience. Nice flavours to try from. Have take away systems as well. Pricing moderate. Packaging system is nice as I saw someone taking a tub home. Recommended. Happy Dining! :)

Best ice cream in the city and the cheapest among the boutique ice cream parlours. Love the nolen gur , banana toffee and the pan flavours. Though do avoid this outlet later in the night because of the crowd that you wouldn't want to mess with. The Punjabi aunty who tries every flavour for free before she settles on old favourite is the least of your worry. Last night witnessed a brawl here between  a family who had inconsiderately parked their car in front of the neighbouring garage , and the name calling that followed was unparalleled. The parlour staff couldn't stop or handle the heat. And maybe a security guard could help.

One of my childhood fond and luxurious memory was to go out with my brother and have an Icecream! It used to be Tulika's always.. Three scoops of Sundae in the biggest vessel.. Yummy Ice pops and flavours that melts in mouth.. I miss that! On my recent trip to Calcutta i visited Pabrai's.. Din't even have the slighest hint that Tulikas is now Pabral's.. One word for what i felt when got to know about it all: Nostalgic! Thank You for flooding in me those memories! Gracious! So lets start the gupshup on Pabrai's Fresh And Naturelle Icecreams..
First Up is The Ambience: Located on Sarat Bose road, is a small ice cream parlor.. Always running housefull.. the place needs to be huge given the crowd thats flocking to you! Loved the board and the history behind the 'Mehnat'(hardwork).. i wish i could write something on that tissues like others but couldnt.. so here i am posting a review!
The IceCream Wallahs: So i tried Nolen-e-gur icecream which actually tasted like nolengur.. the melted gur that oozes out right from the crux.. and looks tempting too! 
Tried Sitaphal cone which was nice! Tasted Paan flavour which was good too.. Couldnt have the paan flavoured cone coz i was full.. so maybe next time when m back to Cal again.
Finally, The Service and Pocket Pinch: The staff are courteous and served me well! However it does pinches one when it comes to spending on the icecream.. 
Do leme know whats your take? Keep me posted.. thanks!

We always love the dessert from this place.They serve an extensive variety in dessert.You just name a flavour and they have it.From chocolate to fruits to Sugarfree,they have it all.They were the first to introduce natural flavour ice cream and if you haven't given a try to this place then you are majorly missing something good.

Service-The service at this place is praiseworthy.The staff is too friendly and cooperative with their customers.

Food- The variety and flavours they serve is commendable.We have tried most of their flavours but what we liked the most was-

1:Paan flavour
2:Rich Chocolate brownie
❤3:Chocolate chips(Flooded with choco chips)
❤4:Nolen gur(Motley of jaggery syrup and icecream)

Food-5/5
Service-4.5/5

This place is highly recommended and if you haven't visit this place then soon give it a try.😄😄

Located opposite to Hotel Samilton i walked into this small ice joint after a heavy meal at a nearby eatery. The interiors are colorful with 5-6 small chairs. Well, I ended up having 3 whole bowls of their NOLEN GUR ice cream - and yes I wanted more, but ended up being cut-off by my friends. The ice cream is everything that it posits to be and much much more. Slightly sandesh, slightly ice cream and lots of actual nolen gur toppings - PURE BLISS. 

Next time I visit I probably won't be trying out anything else either. :P 

P.S : You can get it packed home as well, or even travel with it. They guarantee the packing with dry ice will last for more than 24hours.

Among fruits muskmelon ,watermelon,jamun & falsa are my favourite.
If you wish to surprise yourself go for Mascarpone cheese with dried candies.its an adventure your taste buds will never forget.tastes as exotic as the name.Kudos to the team for bringing out the flavour of cheese in an ice cream so well & blend it with just the right candies.love you guys for this one!!

On a sudden visit to the landsdowne area, i decided to visit this place with a friend, and it turned out to be the best decision for that evening :)
They have so many varieties of flavours to offer, and by the look of it , I could say that each would be delicious.
But, due to shortage of time , I could try only three flavours - Salted Caramel, Paan flavour and the Gandharaj Lemon. And no doubt , it was amazing. 
The Paan flavour was good, with the regular paan taste, Gandharaj Lemon was different and you would definitely want more after having it. Lastly, the best was Salted Caramel- Pure Bliss :)
I would love to go there for more, as there are still so many flavours left to try ;)
Do visit !

The best Icecream of Kolkata. I try to visit this place anytime am near its outlet. Strictly they are the one with these huge options of icecream, flavours such as jamun, black grapes, chandan, anar, banana caramel, Cinnamon, green tea, lemon grass and many others are hard to find it at other places, was shocked to taste some, as how these can be turned into ice creams and taste these good.

Though some favours are not available round the year, but so many interesting flavours tried and many still left, I find a new favourite everytime I visit there.

Not to forget the tender coconut and nolen gur. The nolen gur syrup over the cup makes it taste heaven. No one can make a better nolen gur then its inventor's

A heart full thank you to the team behind it. Love you❤💓❤

What I love about Pabrai's is that they're not afraid to experiment with exotic Indian flavours. They have a galore of choices for every kind of taste, young or old; modern or old-school. 
I love their Nalen Gur & Paan flavours such that up you could even say that I swear by it! The texture it just right, it's got chunks of the real product in it and it feels like you're having an even more flavoursome version of the original thing. 
Their fruit flavours are just as good, without giving you the feeling of consuming something that's artificially flavoured. 
A thumbs up to them!

This is a place opposite to Samilton which serves ice creams in unusual flavours such as Nolen Gur, Paan, Kesari Roso Malai among others. This makes all the difference for our generation who grew up on Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry and may be Butter scotch from ice cream parlors prima facie.  I am not sure how fattening their ice creams are, but I  can vouch for the great taste and freshness that melts fast in your mouth. Personally my favorite is Chocolate Macademia .  Good luck Pabrai!!

Pabrai's ice creams remain one of my most favorite frozen desserts till date. Their ice creams are simply fabulous, gorgeously scrumptious and totally to die for 😍
Visited this outlet on a few occasions as some work had led me to the area.
Their Nolen Gur ice cream is made from nolen gur as the name suggests and is infused with a terrific flavor of authentic jaggery and creamy heavenly bliss. It reminds me of the awesome Bengali pancakes called "pithé," "patishapta," "doodhpuli," and "shoruchakli," and frumenty grandma used to make in winter, as well as the variety of lip-smacking sweets and confections the renowned sweetmakers of Kolkata and almost all sweetmeat shops in the city offer during the cold months such as notun gur er rosogolla, norompak/korapak er jolbhora talshansh sandesh etc.
The Gondhoraj Lemon flavor is one of their best creations, a unique fusion of lime and chilly ice cream that not only is laced with tantalising taste but also a refreshing lemoney aroma.
The Paan flavor consists of artificial flavor but feels very much like the authentic Banarasi mishti paan filled with sweet masala and spices or the betel leaves wrapped in gold or silver leaf served in Bengali weddings.
The Coconut ice cream makes me think of fresh coconut water on a hot summer afternoon sold on streetside corners; the Lemongrass is nice too but I felt the dessert had a very odd grassy taste indeed. It wasn't like any flavor I've tasted, very exotic yet not quite ordinary.
There are other unique funky flavors that I haven't tried but I'm sure they're as lip-smacking and luscious as the ones I've tasted. For ice cream fanatics if you haven't already tried the lush frozen desserts from Pabarai's Fresh and Naturelle Ice Cream do so ASAP!

Really tasty natural flavoured ice creams. They have so many flavours and I want to try them all. As the name suggests many of them are natural flavours, reminds me of the natural ice cream in Mumbai. 

Have tried and loved the nolen gur, bubble gum, ras malai, jamun and watermelon.

Ice creams has been always in my list after a good party or delicioua dinner and if I am in South, Pabrai's is the place. Nkthing much to say....the ice cream served by them is liked by many. Its remains open till late night and they relentlessly serve you the best scoop. Nalen Gur has been my all time favourite, if you want to try off beat taste, try the pan supari flavour kr the mint one. 
One of loves now and then, must come here. Aftera, a good desert completes your meal....!!

My next stop on my list of ice cream parlours was this fine outlet of a really popular chain in Kolkata. 

I went with a friend of mine to try their really popular Nalen Gur and Gandharaj Lemon. My friend tried the Kesar something (don't remember :P) ice cream. 

The Nalen Gur was fabulous! Really delicious! It was absolutely amazing and one of the best ice creams I have ever had!

The Gandharaj Lemon was a wonderful ice cream as well! A very different flavour and the lemony zing was really refreshing! 

The Kesar one was good. It wasn't anything special or different so was overshadowed by the rest. 

What makes this place so good is their reasonable pricing! They really are in a league of their own and there's no wonder why they are so popular! 

If you are one of the few to have not visited their outlet, then please do yourself a favour as soon as possible!! 

Happy Dining!!

This place have a variety of flavors to offer but my personal favorites are the tender coconut and the gondhoraj lemon. But if you are confused between flavors they let you have a taste of  the varieties on display and then take a call.

I love their ice creams! They revolutionized the entire concept of flavored ice cream! The flavors are countless and the taste is so good. They even offer home delivery options. I personally love their paan, nolen gur and daab ice cream.
                    
On a recent visit to the outlet, I was floored by their newest flavours - Imli and Black Truffle ice cream. I thoroughly enjoyed their seasonal - strawberry flavored ice-cream too! I belong to the Salt Lake side of Kolkata, even though there is a kiosk at CC1, I would love to have a proper sit down place to enjoy their ice cream :)

Want to smother your palate in B.E.A.UTIFUL , creamy sweet delicacies. Look no further. This is it.
We happened to visit this place by chance and O.M.G THE ice creams were mmm...mmmmmmm.. *fading away*
Anyways , almost all the flavours (and do try the Nolengur ) are fabulous. Another unique flavour is the paan. 
Try it out cuz you'll be creamed up and comment which flavour you've tasted. 
Happy dining.

After seeing the 1st and the only review of Ayan Chatterjee  at that point of time I called up Ayan da and ask'd weather I should visit this place or not? It was an ABSOLUTE YES from Ayan Da !!
After quite some time I was  finally successful of visiting this place. However on that day, 15.06.2016 which is damn special day for us we were coming from a restaurant which till date I've given the lowest rating on Zomato (1.5, Sharma Dhaba) with a pathetic experience.!!!!!

Well my mood changed instantly with their SERVICES! While I was confused with which one to take as I didn't had any sort of experience with such Versatile and Various flavours of Ice cream, they offered me to taste many flavours without any cost! I loved it! Thank you  Pabrai's Fresh and Naturelle Ice Cream. (Yes I was now even more confused as there were so many flavours! I toh even put multiple flavours in my mouth all at once!!

Eventually we had one Vanilla Orange ice cream (quite an unique combination) and another two flavours! (Sorry nam ta mone asche na)
Price e toh 5 OUT OF 5 debo! It's very #sosta. 

I WILL VISIT HERE PRETTY SOON. AMI AASCHI ABAR....

* P.S - Jai hok 15th June er sesh ta bhaloi hoyeche. Ice cream was tasty, fresh amd jaega ta toh #Posh area. Baap re!

Looking for something different try the Nolengur and the lemongrass ! The salted caramel is a personal favourite though I must say ! 

Definite worth a visit and convenient parking at night definitely adds to the overall experience !

Pabrai, a name synonymous to Ice Creams, has been ruling our hearts and tastebuds since long now. A sole venture by a young entrepreneur, this brand is a reincarnated and revamped version of the erstwhile Tulika which did not fare well according to the expectations. But then here is Pabrai, after 8 long years since 2008 and undoubtedly it is one of the popular and best –selling ice cream brand in this entire country. Their USP is Ice Cream made from fresh and natural products, and this has worked wonders for them. 

My first venture in their store was a couple of months back. The space opposite to Inox at City Center-I, Salt Lake has always been home to numerous stores. People keep coming and going. So, one fine day when I saw a icecream shop having come up there, my inquisitiveness tickled me inside, and there I was after a few minutes tasting heaven within my mouth in the form of divine Nalen Gur Ice Cream. It didn’t take much time for me to fall in love with this brand and their products. Since then, I have tried multiple products here and other outlets spread across Kolkata, and I must say, when it comes to fresh and natural Ice Cream, nothing can beat their likes.

One of the first brand to produce Nalen Gur Ice Cream, please do not be surprised, if I tell you that many of you may have already tasted it, without even knowing the brand name. Talk about the big restaurants and posh hotels, Pabrai has long been associated with numerous of them supplying their irresistible and tempting brand of products to be served to the customers. Much to surprise, this course of positioning their name has worked for them to wonders. The brand never went into aggressive expansion, but instead slowly built up their base. It wasn’t until mid 2009, that Pabrai launched their first outlet and has slowly been planning their expansion since then.

The Paddapukur branch is one of the fewer branches which you would find in this city. A small little outlet, but wonderfully maintained. As you enter the store, the left portion on the wall highlights all the newspaper advertisements and the accolades while the right portion holds a plain mirror and a rectangle shaped space with small colored leaflets stuck on to it. And to your front would be a delectable array of various flavor of Ice Cream ready to beckon and tempt your soul and lead on to you a path of awesomeness. We were cordially invited by the management for a tasting event, and I must say, no other news would have made me feel the luckiest guy in this earth than a tasting event for Ice Creams, and that too at one of the finest and elegant Ice Cream brand around this country.

It was hard to dig our palette to all of them, so we selectively made our choices and tried whatever seemed to tickle our senses. It is almost next to impossible to try and describe each of them, as the number was many, and honestly we weren’t in our right senses. The Vanilla, as I heard somewhere is still one of the finest in the country and is imported straight from Madagascar. A fine hint of Vanilla with the finest milk, it was a pure delight. Be it the Chikkoo, Jamun, Gandharaj Lemon, MuskMelon, the infusion of fresh fruits was just about right. With a silky texture and yummy taste, I would not even dare to choose my favorite. 

The Litchi was just as fresh as it could be. The luscious strawberry, the fresh watermelon, the thickened Rabri, the icecream with the perfect hint of South Indian Coffee, every bite against each of their products speak of elegance. If I were to choose two favorites, they would probably be the Chocolate Brownie and Nalen Gur. Dark Chocolate, mixed with rich brownie, you wouldn’t need anymore excuse to devour into the richness of chocolate infused with brownie. The Nalen Gur, their flagship product, needs no introduction. Just ask the serving person for a spoon of their finest Nalen Gur to be served on top of the Nalen Gur Ice Cream and I promise you would ask for a repeat order.

 Intoxicated within the fine flavors of around, here is a list of all the flavors we tried:

1. Natural Vanilla

2. MuskMelon

3. Orange Vanilla

4. Alphonso Mango

5. Anjeer

6. Bubblegum

7. Toasted Almond

8. Tender Coconut

9. Chikkoo

10. Jamun

11. Gandharaj Lemon

12. Watermelon

13. Lemon Grass

14. Strawberry

15. Salted Caramel

16. Litchi

17. Natural Chocolate

18. Rich Chocolate Brownie

19. Chocolate Chips

20. Kesar Rabri Malai Sugar Free

21. Rose Petal Sugar Free

22. South Indian Coffee

23. Mascarpone Cheese and Candied Fruits

24. Paan

25. Nolen Gur

For those still wondering what heaven looks like, have a view of these pictures. And if you want a direct address, drop into any one of their stores.

The undisputed king of Ice Cream at least in kolkata ... 

Though they are famous for nolen gur icecream and to be presise with the liquid nolen gur topping..there are some other mind blowing ones in stock ... 

Few must try : 
CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT  : 5* 

 GANDHARAJ LEMON ( ITS MORE OF A GANDHARAJ SMELL ... BUT THE TASTE IS JUST MILD WHICH MAKES IT SO AWESOME.) : 4* 


KESARI RABRI : AGAIN 4.5 *  ( KESAR TASTE AND SMELL IS OVERPOWRING) 

BANANA CARAMEL : 3.5*  SOMETHING NEW  FOR SURE . 

MOCHA ALMOND FUDGE : 4* NOTHING NEW .. BUT   VERY NICE 

 AND 

TENDER COCONUT : 9/5 ( YES ITS THAT GOOD ) 

WAFFLE : 1* ( ITS NOT GOOD EVERY DAY ... INFACT TWO TIMES IN LAST MONTH IT WAS SO UNDER DONE THAT IT CAN'T  BE EATEN TILL THE END ) 
COMPLAINED THE SAME ... NO REPLACEMENT DONE .. JUST A SORRY . 

Happy Fooding :)

I heard of this place through a Facebook post of one of my colleagues.

Thought of giving it a try.

I will be honest, this place is a miracle find. Loved every bit of flavourful and mouth watering ice creams available here.

Nalengur,Tender Coconut and Gondhoraj lebu is their own invention which they take pride in .

I believe they have taken ice creams to a whole new level.

Do visit this place for your, you are sure to fall in love.

A legend this brand has become in its own right, Pabrai has been known to serve Natural Ice creams before anyone did in this city. Their products are filled with flavors and tastes exotic as well. My favorite here being their Nolen gur variety. Delicate and smooth with a good infusion of real Nolen gur, this is a heavenly concoction of love and erotica! Prices being cheap, this place warrants visit at frequent intervals!

After a lunch from diya bati I visited this outlet of Pabrai's. I had the nolen gur flavoured ice cream while my friend opted for the coconut one. Can't comment on her flavour but mine was good. It is on the sweeter side so if you like your dessert too sweet this one is for you. 
There are a variety of option to choose from. To fresh fruit flavours to innovative paan flavour.

It was a few blocks away from where we were staying at Kolkata, and we dropped by late one night for some ice cream. To our surprise, the parlour was tiny, but crowded even so late into the night ! The ambience is really good, and I felt that the scoops were slightly overly priced, but the flavour of ice cream was indeed very rich and tasted so good . We had a lot of their signature flavours - South Indian Coffee, Nalen Gur, Rose, and Chickoo. The staff were really friendly and the taste tingled my taste buds for a long time! They also have various other sugar free and natural based ice creams, and are definitely worth the try !

A favorite of mine for amazing ice creams! This outlet is situated in Sarat Bose Road near paddakpukar- Lansdowne. 
The place is small but can accommodate 6-7 customers. 
The ice cream flavors here are pure delight!
From the seasonal gondoraj lemon and mango to the classic chocolate, macadamia, and brownie ones. My favorites are macadamia, chocolate hazelnut, brownie, nolen gur, filter coffee and the coconut. 
Each and every scoop exhibits pure craftsmanship!
 Beautiful taste, flavor and texture and it feels like you're actually tasting the core flavor in its true form! 

A lovely place for mouth watering ice creams.

Love ice creams?? And haven't been here... Trust me guys you are missing something worth a visit..

Pabrai - the best at serving you ice creams with a difference. Difference when I say that I mean they have their own line of variation in the products.

**Location**
Bylane on the main road from minto park towards the Hazra crossing. Its located in between that road on the left side if you are coming from minto park just after crossing jai hind dhaba.

**Products**
I guess I talked abt ice cream with differences and I mean that.
Flavours that creates all new era in ice creams..
Like :
Fruity flavors, spices and fun flavours available.

I tried two flavors here
1. Gandhoraj Lemon : Very very tasty and awesomely Refreshing.. Recommended strongly

2. Coconut flavor: Exotic, rich,creamy and very much flavored loved it too..

What I like they gives you quality cones as well. Nice one:)

**Service**
Thus small outlet is alwys crowed specially later half at night when people decides for their desserts here aftr dinner or may be an ice cream while on a night drive.I liked the good wishes note on their mirror walls looks nice.

Staffs are really quick to take orders and presenting it to you in at a nick of time. Much appreciated.. Very courteous and well behaved indeed...
Strongly recommended...(Y)

This place is literally heaven on earth. After seeing a wide array of flavours, we were very confused about what to choose. So we decided to taste a few flavours that caught our eye and decide thereafter. After trying Gondhoraj Lime, Salted Caramel, Tender Coconut, Watermelon, Nalen Gur and Lemongrass, we opted for Tender Coconut, Nalen Gur and Watermelon. Everything tasted heavenly. I went there with my sister, and we literally had to drag ourselves out from the parlour after gorging on scoops of happiness.

As I was walking towards Pabrai's on a hot, sweltering April afternoon, I came across a coconut seller, but since I didn't have enough time to stand and enjoy some coconut water under the blazing sun, I quickly went inside and ordered the Tender Coconut ice-cream. Also ordered were Gondhoraaj Lemon, Alphanso Mango, Mascarpone cheese with candied fruits. 
The tender coconut and the Gondhoraaj lemon was the best of the lot. Refreshing and creamy, with numerous bits of coconuts present, Tender Coconut is now a new favourite of mine. Gondhoraaj lemon was citrusy n very, very refreshing with the tart lemon flavour cutting brilliantly through the cream. The Alphanso mango was average, and I didn't like it that much and so was the Mascarpone one where the flavour of Mascarpone was missing throughout. 
Nolen Gur,  Tender Coconut and Gondhoraaj are the best flavours at Pabrai's in my opinion and shouldn't be missed.

We make annual trips to Calcutta and this is the first time we tried Pabrais. This is now going to be a regular place to visit. We tried nalen Gur, mascarpone cheese and candied fruits, paan, chocolate macadamia and black grapes. And the flavors, oh the flavors! The nalen Gur was sublime, wonderful texture and the mascarpone cheese was like actually eating cheese. The paan, black grapes and chocolate macadamia were the best I have eaten. It's a feast for the senses, if you are in Calcutta this is a must must try.

Pabrai's Fresh and Naturelle is a brand, launched last year, that makes highly unique and exotic ice creams with natural flavours, without using any artificial colours or preservatives. On visiting this outlet near Chakraberia with two of my friends, I tried three flavours - paan, caramel crunch and rabri malai. Caramel crunch was nice with a crunchy unique texture and a nice taste. The paan flavour was amazing and tasted so natural that it was difficult to distinguish between the taste of original paan and that of the ice cream. The taste was overpowering so it is recommended to try this at the end, else the other flavours might taste dull. The rabri malai, though good in taste, was comparatively inferior than the other two. Each flavour was divine and tasted very fresh and natural, with sufficient quantity served in each scoop. Would be trying out the other flavours in my next visit !

It's a nice ice cream parlour. We had caramel crunch , South Indian coffee and coconut ice cream. The coconut ice cream was really good , with bits of daab in between , the caramel was good too and the South Indian coffee one was my favourite as the coffee aroma and flavour was very strong. They have many other flavours like anjeer, noleen gur, lemon grass , watermelon. I didn't like the watermelon but I really liked the lemon grass one. They had a bubblegum flavour too which tasted just like the pink bubblegum we have.

Had the chikoo flavoured ice cream. Was pretty impressive. The fact that the parlour is open till 1 a.m. on weekdays is the biggest thumbs up.

Didn't had a good time at this place.  Somebody told me to try the Nolan Gud flavor. It was below average. Then I tried the Chocolate Hazelnut one. It was average. So my experience was not a good one.

Have been going here for a while. So your tender coconut ice cream has actual pieces of tender coconuts. The flavors are mind blowing. Can never seem to get enough of the place. And the friends whom I have taken over, have become regular customers. The pocket pinch is reasonable too. Great stuff!

Delicious natural ice creams available at this outlet. Do try the nolen gur flavour, pan flavour. You might also go for the banana truffle, rose sandesh flavour, chikku and anjeer. A natural taste in the ice creams is a plus point for this franchise. I think the cost should be a bit less. But overall I would suggest its worth a shot.

This is our calcutta's All fresh n naturally made ice creams... Whatever color u see of the ice creams are natural, no added colors....I have tried their nolen gur, choco brownie, filter coffee and pan... All are exceptionally good and tastes very natural as well....my favourite being choco brownie cuz I love chocolates.... Their pan flavour is something that really stands out though.. It actually gives u the natural pan taste and its always recommended to have that pan flavour in the end if ur trying to eat more than 1 scoop of different flavours....u wont get the correct taste of the other flavours if u eat pan flavour 1st, its cuz of the nature of the pan....chocolate lovers like me can blindly attack on choco brownie, u won't be disappointed...
My recommendation: choco brownie, nolen gur n pan

Specail info for those who don't know: the ice creams which are served in Taj Bengal are supplied from pabrai's ;)
Don't know which all flavours or all of it but yes its supplied there...

Located just around Chakraberia crossing very near Jai Hind, its a small ice cream parlour. It has a lot of unique flavors. I would highly recommend the nolen gur flavor and the chikko flavor. They provide a nice syrup with the nolen gur ice cream which is amazing. This is very close to naturals ice cream flavors.

They were generous in giving samples to taste. They had a decent collection of flavours of ice cream and I also liked the fact that they had 3 flavours of sugar free ice cream. The South Indian sugar free coffee flavour was a bit strong. 

The main issue we encountered was that I found a piece of plastic string like object in my ice cream which totally spoiled my mood.

Ice creams take away my heart... Visiting to Pabrai's for the second time today made me rate it a perfect 5! All the distinct flavors coming out of those frozen creams make you crave for more! Being a bengali, my all time favourite is Nolen Gurer ice cream... but several of the other flavors is a must try, namely, tender coconut, black grape, kesari malai, paan, caramel crunch, watermelon, etc. After a meal, or just as a snack, this ice cream parlour can serve you a lot to savour! By this a sure revisitor signs off ^_^

The ice cream served is so fresh and perfectly frozen that you can't help but go on and try different flavours as soon as you finish your first scoop. A visit once in 2 days is necessary because of the craving level this place's ice cream tends to have. The nall n gur, I'm not sure if I have spelt that right is invented by them which makes it all the more better for gur (sugar and ghee mixed lumps) lovers. I highly recommend it after dinner or a place to end your Sunday date with.

Visited a couple of times a few months ago. Came highly recommended and didn't disappoint. It caters to a market which was hitherto untapped in Calcutta. Without a Natural's outlet in the city, people so far had been banking on packaged boxes being brought in from Mumbai and other places. While catering to the same genre of natural ice cream as other chains, Pabrai's offers a better range and variety than most others. Would recommend a visit.

Believe it or not, took 12 children with me to the place. Before going, one kid told us that it's his favorite joint. That raised the expectations. 

The place is small but a powerhouse of flavors. Whatever flavor the kids were asking was there. There were ice creams like Pan, Gandhraj lemon, Nolen Gur, rose etc etc etc. 

More than the ice creams we were impressed with the calmness and demeanor of the staff. They were so cool and nice to a loud group of 12 kids. That was impressive. 

Great going guys. All the best and keep it up.

While returning from Jai Hind after a heavy meal, one of my friends said that there's a new place that serves ice cream that tastes similar to Natural Ice Cream (Mumbai). This got us all excited and we ended up visiting the store. It didn't really match the standards of Natural but it wasn't bland at all. Tasting a bite of Tender Coconut Ice Cream was enough to judge the difference.

Loved their Chocolate Brownie Ice Cream. It had real Brownie in it. You feel the brownie in each bite of yours. Luscious I must say. 
I didn't find the Paan Flavoured Ice Cream all that great. But it wasn't bad either. You get the taste of gulkand (Rose Petal Jam, an ingredient of Paan) too. Paan Fusion Ice Cream at Icy Fusion is better than this.

Had been waiting to visit this outlet for quite long. So decided to give it a try after dinner. Located bang opposite 'The Basement' on sarat bose road the outlet was quite easy to find. The space is quite small with sitting arrangement for about 6, but its enough for an ice cream parlor i guess. Tried sitafal,pan & nolen gurer ice creams. Sitafal was good, nothing extraordinary. Pan was a bit of surprize, we really didnt expect such a good proportion of ice creamy paan flavour. But the nolen gur one! man! it sent the ball out of the field. The ice cream felt like freshly prepared gurer kachagolla. in fact one of us found himself comparing the same to 'ratatouille', it actually brought us such good memories.
will definitely visit again.

We often go there to fulfill late night cravings for ice cream. This place is open till 2 in the morning. Even then it gets crowded in occasions like Puja, Diwali etc. You'll have to probably fight your way to the counter and place your order. We generally taste a lot of flavors before making our order. The people at the counter are also very patient and friendly. Be sure to try the Paan flavor and the South Indian coffee flavor - I like them the best. My wife's verdict is that the Nolen Gur ice-cream beats every other one.

Whether an ice-cream lover or not, this place must be given a try at least once. There are high chances that you'll keep coming back again. Have tried quite a few flavours here. I liked these flavours more - Paan, Vanilla orange, Bubble gum, and Caramel crunch. Yet to try the much appreciated tender coconut and sitaphal flavours. Nolen gur is their most popular flavour, I found it to be way too sweet though.

Waffle cones are also good. They also have provisions if you want to take the ice cream home. :) :) This place leaves me wanting for more!

Location: Opposite Pepper Chino; Near Laxmi Narayan Mandir.

Fresh and Naturelle is a small ice-cream parlor serving a large variety of fusion flavors of icecream. This outlet is the second of the upcoming brand. Certainly true to its name, they serve fresh and naturally flavored ice-creams. But, sadly this outlet similar to the former one at Russel Street, suffers from a space constraint and can only accommodate around fifteen people at max; post that, it would feel too cramped up and claustrophobic. Have been here a couple of times already and look forward to more.

The fare on offer was widespread and as their flavoring is from natural ingredients, unavailability of seasonal flavors are acceptable. From the available flavors the following was sampled:

- Chocolate
A balanced flavor of chocolate. Neither too sweet nor too bitter. But, had a slightly synthetic feel to it. Just about decent.

- Kesaria Rabri Malai
Had a creamy texture and subtle flavors of dry fruits and saffron. Tasted good.

- Falsa
Sweet and balanced flavors of the ripe Grewia Asiatica (Falsa) fruit. Also had chopped pieces of the same. Tasted nice.

- Tender Coconut
Among the best ones of the lot. Felt as if coconut water was served in a frozen state. Refreshing and great to taste. Recommended.

- South Indian Coffee
Had an authentically strong flavor of the famous filter coffee. People who love Filter coffee would surely love this. Recommended.

- Paan
Flavors of the Magai Paan mixed into the ice-cream. Had balanced flavors as well as chopped pieces of mint, supari, betel leaves and gulkand. Was good to taste, yet, have had better ones.

- Chocolate Macadamia
Hawaiian Macadamia nuts chopped and mixed along in Chocolate flavored ice-cream. One of the best chocolate flavors available out here. Tasted good.

- Hot Chocolate Fudge (Sundae)
Brownie Crumbs topped with vanilla ice-cream, hot chocolate sauce and cashew nuts. Tasted good.

The person on the other side of the counter was polite and friendly.
Prices were found to be inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall was an above-average experience.
- Plus 0.5 for the great range of flavors. :)
- Yet to try the other offerings and the much celebrated Mocha Almond Fudge & Nolen Gur flavors, comments due.

We went in with a lot of expectations, and every bit of it was justified! It was one hell of an experience...pure, natural and fresh flavours scooped over super crispy waffle cones..we ordered for a nolen gur and tender coconut...nolen gur was topped with jaggery syrup wich made it a little too sweet for me, it was still out of the world,..tender coconut was no less either,,super creamy and tender coconut pieces along with exceptional flavour..after having our share we tried many other flavours, they had some cheese flavoured ice cream which was delicious as well..if you happen to like lemongrass try their ice cream version of it and you'll be taken by surprise!
I'd like to specially mention about the staff at this particular outlet, perfectly trained, aptly friendly and extremely humble! Drop in if you are in the mood for deserts, it'll just be the perfect choice!

Thank you Pabrai's for opening up this gem of a place near my place. I love those colourful array of post-its near the entry on the mirror with awesome comments on them!! 

They serve a delightfully high number of flavors ranging from the normal ones, to the special, Indian ones and the exotic ones.

I have been at Pabrai's twice and have tried out two unique flavours- being a true blue bong I could not resist Nalen gurer ice cream. Awww it was lip smackingly delicious with the real nalen gur on top of it! I bought a tub of it back home as well.

I tried, much to the persuasion of my cousin the Lemon grass flavour as well which though I did not like at first- it slowly grew on me. 

I would love to visit there again and try out more interesting and yummy flavors!

The first thing that captured my gaze was the 'nolen gur' ice cream! In one word, it was HEAVENLY!! 
I later came to know that Pabrai's was the only place that makes this ice cream falvor and then sends it to various places like 6 Ballygunge Place, Bhojohori Manna etc.

I have also had their Custard apple, jamun and litchie flavors. These have real fruit chunks in them. And if you love fruits; you are in for a treat!!
Last and definitely not the least, the Sugar-free South Indian coconut flavor that they have is absolutely out of the world!!

Location: Right on the main road (Sarat Bose Road) . you can clearly see bright Red Glow Board with Pabrai's written.-------------- Ambience: Small and cozy. May Get crowded on weekends and evenings. But very nice and courteous staff. --------------- ICE-CREAM-: in the truest sense, this place stole my heart! I went in as early as 11am , and what a start to the day. Ordered Litchi and Mascarpone cheese with candies Naturelle and Boy! Loved the texture, the taste, the consistency, the service, everything. This place is surely a #MustVisit . they even have a dry ice packing of you want to take away your ice cream somewhere far. Just trust me and give this place a try.

The place is located right in the middle of saeat bose road , close to dugout and nepal sweets. Visited pabrai's on 16th september with two of my frnds at 1 am just as the store was being shut down. It is a small outlet decorated in white and red. I was in a hurry and couldnt check out the place properly , although there wer small sticky notes pasted on a wall , maybe feedbacks from customers .

 We tried the sitaphal, tender coconut and narel gur. I must say the narel gur is superbly amazing . You should defenitely try it. The sitaphal flavour and the tender coconut are just good, but it all depends on taste of different people. Overall its a decent place for natural ice cream.

Hype

Overhype

Huge expectations have mostly hurt establishments than help them really.

I have had Pabrai icecream in Delhi which is documented in Zomato.

Hence went in here with huge expectations which were not met.

We asked for coconut,litchi and mango in cups and cones.None were really mouthwatering.A little ' pheeka ',a little rough,a little something desired for....

Service was energetic and very helpful,prices were moderate but maybe our expectations did us in....

Will come back.

Good companies evolve, based on customer feedback, and I have been greatly delighted during my last visit to Pabrai's, that it has, in fact, improved immensely. 

During my last few visits to Pabrai's, I have consistently had same issues -  (a) the texture has been grainy and coarse, and not as creamy as it should be (b) the ice-creams are too sweet and (c) most of the flavours are not really as authentic as the best in the natural flavoured ice cream makers offer.  While the older range on offer still suffer from the same flaws, (the coconut was closer to the real flavour with chunks hidden inside, but the watermelon wasn't close. The Nalen Guur is way too sweet, but the Paan flavour is one of their better offerings), it is the newer range of six ice-creams that have significantly improved on all these grounds.

The Gondhoraj flavoured ice-cream is creamiest that Pabrai offers, and extremely well balanced in sweetness. The taste is subtle (often with a bitterness underneath that lemon jest is supposed to have). And boy ! what an improvement it is !

After my last few visits, I was concerned that Pabrai's may last as long as superior players like Naturals enter the market ( since it has been working mostly on the novelty factor in Calcutta). Of course, I was wrong, as Pabrai's has proven it is here for the long haul ! I have upgraded the rating by nearly 1 mark - because there is nothing more valuable than a versatile company which constantly changes and improves ! I am going to keep visiting this place.

On Lansdowne road to be precise.

After an early meal.. Drive out wid friends... This ice cream centre calls out to you to make a stop and have its delicacies.
Most aought after and one of its best is Nalen Gur(Fresh Dates Jaggery) flavoured ice cream. Unbelievable that how well they could fuse and reproduce the flavour of the gur in the ice cream.
Try other flavours at ur will and do them with the waffle cones.

It's often a wonder how some people can manage something while others can't. This is just the emotion one feels when one stands in front of the menu of Pabrai's. How can there be such flavours?  One steels oneself and then orders only to be surprised afresh. The melon flavour is so..... melonny. And Gandhoraj lebu flavour ice cream is such a fresh surprise. I never would have believed that such strange concept can actually be ethereal. In short bravo.

When Pabrais first opened up in paddapukur sarat bose road, I was privileged to be given a voucher to taste their various flavours from zomato. After my first visit although the review has been long overdue,due to professional reasons,I have visited this place multiple times and each and every time I have had an enjoyable experience.

The inventors of the much acclaimed Nolen gurer ice cream,Pabrais have come up with many more unique and equally intriguing  new flavours. Among the many that I have tasted, firstly,the fresh fruit flavours are sublime. They are unbeliveably fresh and refreshing. The Tender coconut is my personal favourite.There are other innovative ones like the sitaphal and the chikoo. Among the spice flavours the wasabi ice cream is marvellous. The spicy taste of wasabi in the form of an ice cream is something truly fascinating. The pan flavoured ice cream is another huge hit and quite understandably too. I personally am not a big fan of pan but I loved the pan ice cream. The mascarpone cheese ice cream was nice and subtle and sophisticated. And not to mention the original nolen gurer ice cream which is absolutely sinful.

The wonderful thing about the ice creams here is that you can taste the flavours without them being overpowering .Even flavours you dont normally like that much you would end up liking. The staff are nice and courteous and helpful. They also have the option of taking home 500ml boxes of various flavours.

Pabrais is a place I absolutely loved and would recommend whole heartedly. If you have not tried this place yet,do make sure you try it at the earliest,especially in this summer and monsoon months. You are sure to have a great experience.
Enjoy! :)

Went to their outlet on Lansdowne road. They have some wonderful and new flavours. I had their nolen gur ice cream....which is also their speciality....and it was fantastic. Loved it. The staff ...there were only two of them there...were courteous and greeted us as we entered which set the mood for an amazing ice cream experience. Will keep on going back again and again to try the other flavours that they have.

Pink, green, white, velvet! 
Kiwi, rose, coffee, coconut! 
Trying to figure the odd one out? Well don't even try!
These are some of the flavours and colours of the ice-cream that they sell at Pabrai's! 
I walked into their Paddapukur store the other day and took an instant liking to the empty space inside the store! No large advertisements on the walls, no furniture cluttering the space inside; just open space to stand and savour the different colours of ice cream arrayed in front of you. And the colours reminded of the excitement I had felt as a kid, when our house was getting painted; the cans of paint had looked so alluring. 
The ice-cream of today is getting such a great makeover!  And Pabrai, with a range of flavours that are not only varied but natural to boot, is a welcome addition to the new age stylised ice-creams!
I got talking with the lone friendly staff manning the counter and was told that the USP of their ice cream was that none, barring two flavours, we're artificial. Natural ingredients  were always used to flavour the ice-cream.  In their fruit based ice-creams I could, I was told, always find chunks of real fruit to add to the flavour. 
Which was their best selling product, I asked the man. 
"Nolen gur" was his instant reply with a slight tilt of his head sideways, as if in a bid to stop me from any thoughts that I might develop for challenging his statement. 
I, however, ordered for a southern coffee flavour, polished it off and then, with a cooled, satiated mind and body, went out to face the stifling Kolkata heat once again!

Pabrai's - Fresh and Naturelle Ice Cream.
=====
Intro + Location : Pabrais has opened it's door in Lansdowne Road and is famous for serving fresh and naturelle ice cream. It has also opened another branch at City Center, Salt Lake and one at Russel Street recently. I had got to visit Pabrais as i had got a complimentary voucher from Zomato (Thanks for that!). I came here with my family to try out their ice creams.

The place is a bit crampy as they are a small outlet and is most of the times crowded in evenings as there are a lot of loyal customers here. The cashier handling the bills is a bit slow due to slow working machine which shall be taken care of. Nevertheless, after glaring at the ice cream outlet, i continued with my order.
=====
What i ordered: I ordered a couple of ice creams here in cup. They are as under:-

1) Paan Ice Cream - This was a green colored ice cream. It had authentic flavour of Paan. It tasted as if you got a tinge of paan in your mouth without that chewing experience and i would highly recommend this.

#musttry

2) Nolen Gur Ice Cream - This is one of the most selling items at Pabrai's. I would not say much about it as it's the pure natural nolen gur ice cream. #musttry

3) Anjeer Ice Cream - It had that anjeer flavour in it. It tasted good too. If you like the flavor of anjeer, you can go for this one.

4) Orange Vanilla Ice Cream - I really enjoyed this as orange and vanilla makes a really good combination. #musttry
=====
Ice Cream for two: I got a voucher worth 500/-. Well, per ice cream cost is near about 80 bucks. Ice Cream for two would come around 250 bucks.
=====
Pros:

1) Despite being a small outlet, they have parking facility.

2) Serves fresh and naturelle ice cream as they claim it.

3) Place is clean and hygiene is maintained.

4) A different concept from usual ice cream outlets.

Cons:

1) Serving time is a bit slow and same goes for the cashier handling the bills. This improvement can help in serving the customers in a much more efficient manner.

2) Can accomodate more chairs for people to sit and enjoy the ice cream even at outside.

3) Hospitality can be improved much more.

=====
Expert Suggestions:

1) Make the billing machine faster.

2) Get offers for the customers so that they would love to come back.

=====
Summary:

Ice Cream Quality 4.3/5

Ice Cream Quantity 3.8/5

Taste 4.1/5

Hygiene 4.1/5

Hospitality 3.8/5

Value for money 4/5
=====
Conclusion: Pabrai's is a very good ice cream outlet but there's always scope for improvement. Would love to visit again. :-)

I just can't have enough of this place! being one die-hard ice cream fanatic, this place is a refreshing change from the regular ones. I have tried almost all the varieties but my all time favourites remain the paan, Nolen gur and tender coconut. Each of the ice creams have their own distinct flavours that hit your taste buds and leave you craving for more. Simply divine! Cheers to the owners for coming up with such an amazing concept and introducing flavours that one never imagined before . Kudos.

Forget Quality Walls and Amul, Pabrai's is the new ice cream joint with a swagger in the world of ice creams. They melt in your mouth and are just so amazing 😍  besides this, they have some unique favours which one must try such as the nolen gur flavour, paan, chocolate hazelnut, and the coffee flavoured ice cream. Superb !

In my opinion Pabrai's Fresh and Naturelle Ice Cream is the best ice cream parlour in Kolkata today. Though they are famous for their Nalen gur ice cream, I would suggest all of you to try the Mascarpone cheese & candid fruits (MCCF) ice cream. The smooth and creamy texture of the MCCF will give u a heavenly pleasure. Thanks Pabrai for MCCF. Wish u all the best.

Pabrai's has been a sort of revelation in the frozen dessert domain in the city. They are still pretty new to us and as a matter of fact many have yet not heard of them. If you really love some ice cream after your meal or maybe just to beat the heat then this is the place to be. Here you will get those flavors which you won't find anywhere else in Kolkata, and each flavor is absolutely distinct from the other. They use absolutely fresh ingredients and the overall product is very light and flavorful.

LOCATION - - - - Located at Paddapukur just opposite the Pepper Chino restaurant. It's right on the main road and pretty easy to locate. You can park your vehicle right in front of the shop.

AMBIANCE - - - - There is nothing much to say about this since it is a pretty small and cramped up place and you might feel uneasy if you stay in there for long. This is the only negative which I found about this place. The ice creams are so delicious that the place remains filled to its brim for most of the times and sometimes it might even be hard to stand or go ahead to the counter to place your orders. There are 4-5 small stools in there but it's tough to get them free. So I found many people were enjoying their ice cream outside or opting for take away.

FOOD - - - - Now coming to the area of our core interest. There are numerous unconventional flavors you will find here like Bubblegum, Lemongrass, Tender coconut, wasabi, anjeer, etc. And several popular ones like the Paan, Nolen Gur, etc while you can always opt for simple conventional flavors like chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, etc. We tried scoops of: South Indian Filter Coffee, Paan, Nolen Gur, Tender Coconut and Alphanso Mango. Then we carried home one 500 ml tub of Tender Coconut. South Indian Filter Coffee was smooth with real dark flavors, perfect for a coffee lover, absolutely loved it. The mango was nice but not so great as the other flavors I tried. Paan ice cream is one of the best flavors you will get at this place, creamy delicacy with real bits of Paan in it, it is just awesome, you just can't miss this. Nolen Gur is their trademark flavor, it's so pleasing and soul satisfying, made from fresh jaggery this is sure to touch your heart. And I loved the Tender Coconut flavor in the end, so much so that I decided to carry one tub home. It's a soothing treat for your tastebuds, the unique flavor with soft coconut bits is simply awesome, something for which I'll keep coming back to this place.

SERVICE - - - - Service was pretty prompt considering the huge rush and the space crunch in there. The servers were more working like robots which the situation demanded and lacked the warmth or smile which if added could have been really awesome. Found that billing process was smooth as well.

OVERALL - - - - The prices are bit on the higher side but it's seriously worth every penny. I was lucky to get introduced to them and I thank Zomato for this, for this complementary treat. It was really an awesome gesture from Zomato and Pabrai's, thanks again. I will keep coming back to Pabrai's everytime I feel like having some great ice cream and I'll spread this word for sure. If you are still not trying them out you are surely missing out something! :)

Cheers!

A long due review - thanks to #zomato and #pabrai's for the 500 rs coupon. It was well-worth the experience. I tried at least 10 flavors in the outlet, and had a hard time picking 2 tubs for home. At last I zeroed in on Rose (the sugar free variety) and banana caramel crunch. They were heavenly!
I have tried muskmelon, chikoo, tender coconut, nalen gur, roast almond fudge, paan, rose - and am dying to try their apple pie. The range is awesome - from fresh and homely to subtle and exotic - all priced pretty damn reasonably. So go ahead, take your pick. 
Here's hoping that pabrais do a pan-india branding soon. They are our very own, home-grown Ben and Jerry's! Cheers!

At almost half the price of Baskin Robbins, and with comparable quality, this one is surely in for the long run! And an additional thumbs up for their packaging for takeaways!

The store people were very welcoming, gentle and well groomed. They made us taste so many of the flavours without even being asked! We had caramel crunch and chocolate hazelnut ice creams with waffle cones. The quantity was very good and the satisfaction too! Have to visit there again and again to try the other flavours out!

The store is already quite popular and bustling with people! The location is prime and the inner decor is bright as well as inviting with little dainty seats. The little place is a great charmer indeed!

They have quite unnatural flavours and the ice cream is not gooey and neither does it melt easily. After you finish one, it feels like a complete meal!

With so many choices, you may up eating more than one. In a group of eight, we tried many varieties, all of them were fighting with other to be number one.

What more... It is located at a very convenient place walkable distance on the opposite side of jai hind dhaba, bhawanipor,  Sarat bose road 

And not to forget... It's open till late night....

They serve 24 varieties of ice-cream. Nolengur ice-cream being their specialty.. 
Alert for Nolengur lovers, the ice-cream tastes & feels just like the sandesh. So, I recommend u check out the other flavors.

Located at Sarat Bose Road opposite Pepper Chino restaurant this small outlet houses array of flavours. 
After sampling few recommend flavours by them narrowed down to Nalen Gur and Paan flavours. Have tried these two flavours in few fine dining restaurants but must confess this is best taste I came across till now.
Paan had finely chopped beetle leaves and paan masala mixed with ice cream is unique itself. Had after taste of minty masala. While Nalen Gur will give impression of new jagerry one will get in sweet shops during winter been served chilled. For best taste must top it up with warm jagerry given separately in a small container.
Price is not that cheap for a 500 ml container but you can't avoid it. Thanks to Zomato for introducing them to me and for the voucher.

Not too fond of Naturals icecreams. I tried the Tender Coconut flavour and i surprisingly loved it! It was the perfect flavor for a hot sunny afternoon! The tender pieces of coconut inside the icecream was an added bonus.
Cost me 70/- for a single scoop.
Looking forward to trying other flavours in days to come :-D

It is an amazing place. The wide range of unusual flavours are a refreshing change form the mundane flavours that we are used to. The fact that they are derived from natural extracts of fruits and other things, and aren't just artificial flavours is all the more endearing. You are spoilt for choice in choosing only one flavour from a myriad of tasty flavours and quite often end up being confused or having more than one. It has a few sugar free flavours, so that the calorie-conscious don't go on a guilt trip after having them. This place should not be missed by anyone who has even a remote liking for ice creams.

After reading about it in the newspaper, ended up at their outlet the next night. Their range and varieties of ice creams are highly commendable. Like most ice cream parlours one can taste the ice cream before deciding on it. We tried various flavours and ended up on filter coffee, watermelon, mango and paan. All were really good. filter coffee was my favourite. They really know the importance of human touch and connecting with the customer. We were made to feel so welcome here. These two traits along with their delicious ice creams will take them a long way forward. Prices are reasonable. Definitely a must try!

Awesome flavours. . !!
The best natural ice cream ever . 
Nolengur and Paan are MUST must haves. eat and take away too.

Heard so much about this outlet from a friend that i decided to drive almost 15 Km just to try out their ice cream and to be honest it was worth that much effort. A refreshing change from the likes of Mama Mia and Baskin Robbins. Kolkata really deserves this outlet. The interiors are simple but yet very catchy. On one side they have printouts of articles wriiten on them and on the other side they have a wall full of Post It stickers of feedbacks. Now coming to their ice creams, Nolen Gur flavour is just heavenly. Served with liquidy gur as a topping, this is far best the ice cream i have had in ages. Also try their Pan flavour which i found really good. Besides that Naturelle Chocolate is the simple old school chocolate which i tried and liked. Even their waffle cone is very tasty, fresh and crispy. I would love them to rate 5 but still would like to try out some more flavors before that. Overall very satisfied and i would recommend everyone to try some of their flavors for sure.

Rating 5/5, no less can it be.
Pabrais are the pioneers of nolen gur ice cream. They supply variety of ice creams Pan India. The owner Mr Anuvrat Pabrai has immense knowledge and love for food and the same passion goes here in making his ice creams!
Probably the best ice cream parlour in town, so many varieties, each one different from the other and having its own distinct identity and treatful taste! They don't say no if you ask for a spoonful of tasting! Rather they are ever ready to assist you in trying.
I have tasted from nolen gur to faalsa to jackfruit to paan but my favourite is lemon grass.... What a heavenly taste it has, and lingers for quite some time in your mouth! Prices are justified at an average of Rs 70/scoop.
The timing of the store is 11am to 1am midnight that makes it an ideal post-dinner outing.
If you haven't tried it yet... DO IT !!!

This place has been around for a very long time, but since they shifted in lansdown people have started noticing it.

amazing ice creams i must say. for people who like fruit flavoured or some other flavoured except chocolate this place is good.

there paan n mint and nolan fur ice creams were very good. its a must try.

what i didn't like is chocolate flavoured ice creams, which they don't specialise in.

They are the same people who used to run legendary TULIKAS. Unfortunately it closed down.
They had a desert called "chocolate Castle" it would be great if they could start that here.

This is a cosy little ice cream parlour situated at Sarat bose road. This place has brought a revolution in the field of   ice cream.
You won't find a single usual flavour here, even if you do it will definitely have an extra oomph.
The flavours are so fresh and real, all because of the natural ingredients they use for the ice cream. You could feel bits and granules of the real natural thing..of the respective flavour.
Though the paan flavour is really hyped but each flavour has its own grace. Paan lovers would love paan flavour,whereas the fruit lovers would love the fruit flavours.
Lemon grass has the strongest flavour and has a great after taste.
Litchi,kala jamun, watermelon,rabri malai,chikoo are my favourites.

The staff is really cooperative and help you with tasting as many flavours you wabt before selecting the one you want to have.

The rates are pretty decent, on the cheaper side.
I myself have tried almost all the flavours and still feel like going back again and again.

This ice cream parlour rejuvenated my childhood dream of having an ice cream shop of my own.

If you are missing the taste of gourmet ice cream you can have in some of the ice cream parlors in Delhi, Ahmedabad or Mumbai, and want to taste the same in Kolkata.. this is the place to be. 
Easy on the pocket, and heavy on taste, they have a wide range of flavors you can choose from. As an avid chocolate lover, I had all the four or five chocolate flavors they have.. and it is really something that would bring you back for more. I have yet to try their nolen gur and paan flavor, but I am saving it for the day when I am in the mood for an experiment. But, from the other reviews, I can say it would certainly not disappoint. Overall, I can say, I am going to be a regular here.

The first name that comes to mind for natural flavoured ice cream in Kolkata. Great to see it open up in Lansdown making more easily accessible. Alphonso and nolen gur are my all time favourites but the new madras filter coffee flavour and pan flavour are equally brilliant! Must warn you that the taste and flavours are so addictive, you will keep coming back for more! For those who have not yet tried it, believe me you are missing out something truly special. All the best to Kunal and hope you are able to maintain the high quality, taste and standards.

I have always loved ice cream. After shifting to Bangalore for higher studies, my school friend took me to Pabrai to taste Nolen Gurer Ice cream. Away from home and the rich taste of nolen gur not only made me happy but it became my regular place to hang out and have ice-cream. Whenever my parents used to come I used  they would order tender coconut. After seeing the shop in Calcutta I was immensely happy and this place is sill my regular hang out place for ice-cream. Gandhoraj Lemon is another flavor I have fallen in love with.

Went in with a friend casually and it turned out to be a Ben&Jerry's of kolkata.I've had better Ice creams elsewhere but this is where it steals the deal-the rates...super cheap...in fact naturals will be put to shame... Plus the flavours are authentic too.
Try the Nolen gurer ice cream... The claim to be the inventors of the delicacy... I'm not quite sure about that. But it's served with nolengur on top. I liked the caramel crunch too...not to mention the pan flavoured ice cream. It's something I had never tasted anywhere....but I found it to be overpowering with the flavours.maybe the quantity was too much for something like paan...which is best had in small quantities.
But anyway if virat kohli could come here and get anushka as his muse...perhaps we all could try this place...;-)

It serves nonveg. So it is misrepresentation on zomato. People looking at pure veg options will surely disappointed seeing red marks item on the menu. However we have  to appreciate honesty of enterprise by marking nonveg items with red mark.

Excellent attention to detail. Every flavour is amazing and feels rich! Once you start eating this you will never touch those vegetable fat artificial ice creams. Their natural ice creams are more natural then Natural's in Mumbai (pun intended).

Located at the Sarat Bose Road, the place instantly catches your attention with its vibrant interiors. It offers a wide variety of ice-creams made from natural/real fruits etc, hence the name 'naturelle' & one can easily feel the presence of real fruits. The quality of ice-creams is good & interiors are cheerful. A recommended place for ice-cream lovers!

I have tasted the Nalen gur (date palm) flavour ice cream before and it is perfect. Today I tasted few other natural flavoured ice creams such as paan vanilla, muskmelon, chocolate, lemon grass and all were brilliant. They have a certain aroma that is enticing. The flavours are authentic. The owners were friendly and welcoming. I definitely recommend it

Finally, Pabrai's opens its first COCO (Company Owned, Company Operated) shop in kolkata! 

Those who have been relishing the Nalen Gur ice cream at different establishments in Kolkata may not know that Pabrai's Fresh & Naturelle are the INVENTORS of the NALEN GUR ice cream. (Their Nalen Gur ice cream is the one that is popularly sold at all Bengali Restaurants including Bhojohari Manna, 6 Ballygunge Place, Oh! Calcutta etc., and the 5 star hotels).

While the Nalen Gur is indelibly one of Pabrai's crowning inventions, you must not miss the other flavours.

Their Fruit ice creams are made from only fresh fruits. No canned or preserved fruits. (Try smelling their ice creams - e.g. Muskmelon. I am told natural ice creams give off an aroma which is not usually found in artificial ice creams.)

Their chocolate range is to die for. Made from naturally processed cocoa, their chocolate ice creams will satisfy all of one's cravings for rich cocoa. Try their rich chocolate brownie and chocolate hazelnut flavours.

The spice flavours and exotic flavaours like Mascarpone cheese & candied fruits, Lemon Grass, Black Sesame are quite unusual and equally mindblowing.

Good news for diabetics, Pabrai's has a range of no-added-sugar (sugar free) ice creams as well. I am told that they are made using plant extracted sweetners, which unlike asparatame, are pro-biotics and help in digestion.

The Hot Chocolate Fudge Sundae is one of the best in town. Reminds me of my childhood when I used to crave for the Tulikas hot chocolate fudge sundae.

Apart from ice creams, their waffle cones are a must have as well. Very crunchy and flavourful.

All in all, a must visit parlor.
Bonus: its open till 1 am.

I have to say that Pabrais Fresh n Naturelle's ice cream is the best I've had. They genuinely stick to their claim of using natural ingredients which becomes very evident once you have it. A big thumbs up to the outlet as well. Clean and organised ! Very friendly and passionate owners ready to serve you with ice cream and information even at 1 am.

My personal favourites are the paan and nolen gur followed by tender coconut. The fact that they keep coming up with innovative flavours like the spice flavour or lemon grass makes me eager to see what's next. Reviewing it, I feel like hitting the store right away! Excellent n innovative. Keep it up!

Who doesn't love ice cream ??? This place is recently opened in bhawanipore and is really good. Its a small place where you enter order loads of ice cream and preferably walk out. There are a few stools in case you feel like eating inside. Their ice cream is really great. I tried the rose flavor which was good but their cheese and mascarpone was out of this world. I really dont have words to describe how good it tasted. 

I need to go to this place again and try their famous nalen gur ice-cream which is also their speciality.

A big thumbs up to this place and if you havent tried it yet you dont know what you are missing out on.

It was a Sunday evening (The week this outlet opened) when I visited this ice cream shop with my family. Its located almost near the corner of the crossing for chakraberia. I had the Chocolate Hazelnut Flavour,as suggested by Nishant Pabrai(He told me it is one of his favourite), and ya it was amazing.. I liked it too! Looking forward to try some more flavours ;)

@1am at night I couldn't have asked for a better place to have ice cream. There is a hell and heaven difference between what I had earlier with other ice cream makers and what I had experienced in taste today. Ice cream served at its best.... a must visit for all ice cream lovers.... the pan flavored ice cream was the best.... its simply awesome..... :)
