I went there last month and I absolutely love it there. A teacher of my college who is also our mentor introduced us to this place. We ordered a few beers at first. To start with the food we ordered Bamboo Chicken and Jade Chicken to have with the beer. Both tasted amazing and we ended up re-ordering it. For the main course we ordered Chicken Rice Noodles, Shrimp Rried rice, Hong Kong chicken and Dragon chicken. Everything we had was amazing.

Food - 9/10
Ambience - 8.5/10
Staff - 8/10

Located opposite to the Lalit’s, this restaurant has become a destination for many of the Chinese lovers, I too got to know about it from a friend of mine, who happens to share his sheer love for Chinese.
Don’t judge a book by its cover, the red building might appear worn out and boring, but as soon as we entered we were already amazed by the ambience.

Tried a variety of Starters starting from Crispy Chilli baby corn, Chicken drumstick, Fried Jade Chicken, I don’t remember the names of rest of ‘em. Fried Jade Chicken deserves special mention.

In the main course I ordered Mixed Fried Rice along with Garlic Chicken, Chicken Cantonese Chowmein along with Manchurian Chicken. Taste was good, and quantity served was enough for one. Some people in the group got ill because of the shrimps used in Mixed Fried Rice, hence avoid dishes containing shrimps.

Best part is the booze, they serve alcohol at a very lower price than other Chinese restaurants, and one could find the 2:1 offer if lucky enough.

Ambience is pretty good, but too dark for one to click pictures even 😅

Bill came around ₹5900/- for 11 people including Alcohol and Tax.
Recommended.

Quaint little place in the heart of the city. Extremely pocket friendly but without compromising on the quality of the food. Drop by for a quick round of drinks or an after office catch up. Drinks are cold and food is warm. The servers know their craft and suggest well. They house most of the good brands and you wont be disappointed. Sure they lack the glamour of latest fad of upmarket places, but they more than make it up with their pocket friendliness and food. Do visit for they still carry on the old kolkata feel that the city grew up with.

Just loved this place.. a beautiful ambiance.. you can visit here with friends, family or even your date.. the atmosphere is somehow perfectly set.. coming to food.. excellent food at best prices.. really affordable price.. and equally good food.. been there quite a few times.. though forgot to capture the main course pictures.. :p
The price is really really low and it's perfect for everyone seeking pocket friendly bar cum restaurants near dharmatala..

Ambiance not good some kinda gloomy dingy 
Service not at all good staffs are lame asked them for salad which was complimentary but initially they didn't  pay any attention later on they did
Food quality is good and for this giving the review anyway ordered Chicken Manchow soup value for money quality quantity both good and next fried chicken, a bit of sweet kind of dish it was although good. But its just that zomato is a platform where we judge quality of the food not the service that's why 4 out of 5 otherwise it would have been as lame as their service!!

Yes  i went there on my friends suggestion..  And did find it to be worthy of recommending to someone else..  As for drinks we didnot offer any..  But as per food it was really good and moreover cheap..  One thing to remember its not a place for loud hiphop music and dance bars.   But rather it is a place where you will take the booze and the so called 'nesha' will ascend slowly and steadily and finally will hit you at the end...  We ordered drums of heaven which was little dry..  And in main course we ordered mixed singapore fried rice chicken hakka noodles and ginger chicken.     Food quality is so so..  But overall a very entertaining place..

Decent food in a pocket friendly budget, mainly crowded with Office goers & teenagers which makes the ambience little noisy. Drinks are also available in reasonable price. We ordered Songhai Special Chicken & Chicken Sweet Corn Soup in Starter. Soup was little blunt in taste, Chicken was less spicy & crisp was perfect.In main course we ordered Mixed fried rice, Mixed Cantonese Noodles & Bamboo Chicken as side dish. This dish of Chicken was suggested by staff which actually became the show stopper. It's oval kind of  shape with a stick inside it formed a different look & taste was good as well.Rice I found little less in quantity whereas noodle was ok in quantity with ample ingredients & taste was good.
In brief This is a budget friendly chinese eatery which has also launched few Kebab items as well, will make  another plan to visit & have a taste of them.

The staff members here is a real disappointment. We asked for water. They said, "Ekkhuni toh chole toh jaben na"(you just came, you won't be leaving soon, right?). We asked to change the TV channel and they simply switched off the TV. We asked them to switch on the AC but they refused to do so since it was winter.
The food was great though. Service is on the quick side. But they suck there too. They brought orders from other tables to our place and served our orders to different tables! It was a chaos. I had Chicken Hakka Chow and Dragon Chicken. The quantity is sufficient and both of them tasted great.
If only the staff member matched the excellency of the chef!

This place tucked away in Waterloo Street , being The Lalit Great Eastern is a paradise for beer lovers. You can hangout with your friends and family over sone chilled Beer and delicious chinese cuisine . 
We just tried their Crispy Chicken and Shrimp Rice Noodles . Both of them were yummy . We had loads of beer and other domestic drinks . 
The servers though need a bit of grooming. Also the billing was slightly incorrect . 

So yeah , overall it's a nice place to hangout and have a nice lunch in this pretty looking restobar .

Well, the location of the restaurant is quite convenient. We visited there on the 25th December. As expected the place was fully packed. Finally, after 20mins we got a table of four, where 6 of us had to adjust ourselves. After waiting for a long time we had to ask them to serve us water, where they served only 3glasses of water for 6 people. Coming to the food, dragon chicken and pepper chicken were good but schezwan chicken really disappointed us. The quantity of veg fried rice served was very less. Also, the shrimp noodles was a heart breaking experience. The behavior of the staff was unfriendly and very bad.

A nice and cheap place to grab drinks and snacks. Located just beside The Lalit Great Eastern. You can reach by esplanade metro or chandni metro. One of my friend recommended this place. This place is one of the cheapest bar in kolkata having nice decor and good ambience. Drinks are priced cheap as hell and food is cheap and good. We had Budweiser, Bacardi White Rum, Signature along with crispy babycorn and spring chicken. The babycorn was better than the chicken dish. They also sell bira which is not listed in the menu, the bira blonde costs 155 and bira white costs 177. A must visit and I think this should be listed in the hidden gems section.

Located in the lane beside The Great Eastern Lalit, Manthan Songhai offers a wide variety in terms of food ( Chinese ) but unfortunately the same can't be said about the drinks. Drinks menu is pretty basic with no cocktails or high end alcohol on offer. We ordered a Mixed Fried Rice and Pepper Chicken. Food was really good. Pepper Chicken is recommended only if you like something spicy as the dish is not mentioned on their menu card. We had a BIRA beer and Smirnoff vodka too. One plate of Rice and Pepper Chicken is sufficient for two people. Place has a nice decor and all in all, provides a quite, soothing dining experience at really affordable rates as my total bill stood below Rs. 600 including the drinks.

Pros:

2. Staffs are well behaved 
3. Service is not late 
4. Prices of the foods and drinks are really affordable 
5. Foods are Tasty 

Cons:
1. They don't play any kind of music 

Final thinking: 
If you love music while drinking any alcohol you will not like this place...
I loved this place becz i carried a Bluetooth speaker with me which became saviour to me...
We tried their chicken drumsticks(very satisfying taste) , chicken pepper fry (saucy and spice and I loved it), Singapore mixed fried rice  (okayish taste ) , bamboo chicken (they told me it is spicy bt trust me if you have spicy tastebuds don't try this becz this is not at all spicy ,bt tastes good )

Last bt not the least,  I love having some mouth fresheners after eating so much food ,bt they don't provide us any mouth fresheners  ...

Good place for a dinner date with your loved one...

PROS- Good ambience, Drinks are quite reasonable, well trained staff, well stuffed bar and great place for clicking good quality photos

CONS- Bad food, less quantity, the prawn in the mixed fried which were served to us was rotten and smelled awful. We were so busy in our banter no one noticed this carefully and 7 out of 11 people are suffering from diarrhea now. Including me. The food is not at all reasonable considering the amount that were given to us and still it shows 700 for two.
Another worst place that I have visited in 2017.

One of the best places for  having a quiet Lunch with your friends and family. 
A great soothing ambience, courteous staff, affordable prices and finger - licking Chinese food makes it one of the best places to eat in Central area. 
Recommended dishes :
Manchow soup - a thick and refreshing soup.. Goes best with beers. 
Hakka chicken chowmein - a simple but extremely well-prepared dish with a price of just 122 rupees. 
Dragon chicken - one of their best dishes with a heavenly taste! 
Pepper chicken - another of their signature dishes made with big chicken chunks in a peppery gravy. 
The alcohol prices are affordable too with a pint of kingfisher Costing at 99.
A must-visit place if you are in the central - esplanade area.

This place is considered one of the oldest & authentic chinese eatery in Kolkata. Originally it was run by the Chinese and few years back it was taken over by Manthan group and now days popularly called Manthan Songhai. It is just opposite to the bakery outlet of Lalit Great Eastern Hotel. I have been hearing about this place for quite sometime, but ultimately got the chance to relish the food in this week twice. 

First was on Tuesday 26.09.2017. It was a lunch, and we all four colleagues shared a mixed hakka noodles, a mixed fried rice, a chicken fried rice, a songhai special chicken and a garlic fish. We thought two main dish would be sufficient for all of us, but to our surprise we had to order an extra main dish as chicken fried rice(the reason not to order mixed rice was, the mixed rice & noodles were both having foul smells. And after enquiring with the attender we came to know it was due to use of frozen shrimp in the dish.) 

Second visit was on Thursday 28.09.2017 with my family for dinner. This time we choose to sit on the first floor. It was a little bit crowdy due to puja celebration. We reached there around 6.50pm and easily got a place for us. We started our dinner with Chicken sweet corn soup & Veg noodles soup, accompanied by a starter of Golden fried prawns(5pcs).Now for main course we ordered a Egg rice noodles, a Chicken rice noodles, a Chicken fried rice, a Garlic fish & a Manchurian chicken(this time we also ignored the mixed rice or noodles due to my last experience of the foul smell. Also ordered three main dish due to the quantity issue.) Lastly we ordered four Tutti fruity ice creams. 

Now coming to my observations 
Location: Good 
Ambience: Newly renovated property with sufficient sitting arrangements. Cosy chairs with appropriate lighting and decor. 
Staff: Need to be a little more organised and professional. 
Service : Slow on my second visit, need to keep pace with growing crowd.
Price: Quite reasonable with respect to the location. 
Food: In both days the Garlic fish was the show stealer. Highly recommend for non veggies. May avoid the mixed noodles or rice due to the stale smell of frozen shrimp. The soups were at par with other Chinese restaurant. For the Golden prawns, the prawns were fresh & soft but the coating was uncooked from inside. The Rice noodles were properly prepared and appreciated by our taste buds. The Chicken Manchurian was a set back and really disappointing, we expected whole chicken pieces instead it contained about 50 small shredded pieces and totally tasteless. The Tutti Fruity ice cream was good but the only fruit present was sliced pineapples to our surprise. 

Lastly could not rate it five due to use of stale frozen shrimps, small quantity of food,  indifferent and clueless staffs and baby cockroach running helter-skelter on the table.

Will visit again and will be happy to give more rating next time. 😇😈

It is just opposite to the bakery outlet of Lalit Great Eastern Hotel. I have been hearing about this place for quite sometime, but ultimately got the chance to relish the food in this week twice. 

First was on Tuesday 26.09.2017. It was a lunch, and we all four colleagues shared a mixed hakka noodles, a mixed fried rice, a chicken fried rice, a songhai special chicken and a garlic fish. We thought two main dish would be sufficient for all of us, but to our surprise we had to order an extra main dish as chicken fried rice(the reason not to order mixed rice was, the mixed rice & noodles were both having foul smells. And after enquiring with the attender we came to know it was due to use of frozen shrimp in the dish.) 

Second visit was on Thursday 28.09.2017 with my family for dinner. This time we choose to sit on the first floor. It was a little bit crowdy due to puja celebration. We reached there around 6.50pm and easily got a place for us. We started our dinner with Chicken sweet corn soup & Veg noodles soup, accompanied by a starter of Golden fried prawns(5pcs).Now for main course we ordered a Egg rice noodles, a Chicken rice noodles, a Chicken fried rice, a Garlic fish & a Manchurian chicken(this time we also ignored the mixed rice or noodles due to my last experience of the foul smell. Also ordered three main dish due to the quantity issue.) Lastly we ordered four Tutti fruity ice creams. 

Now coming to my observations 
Location: Good 
Ambience: Newly renovated property with sufficient sitting arrangements. Cosy chairs with appropriate lighting and decor. 
Staff: Need to be a little more organised and professional. 
Service : Slow on my second visit, need to keep pace with growing crowd.
Price: Quite reasonable with respect to the location. 
Food: In both days the Garlic fish was the show stealer. Highly recommend for non veggies. May avoid the mixed noodles or rice due to the stale smell of frozen shrimp. The soups were at par with other Chinese restaurant. For the Golden prawns, the prawns were fresh & soft but the coating was uncooked from inside. The Rice noodles were properly prepared and appreciated by our taste buds. The Chicken Manchurian was a set back and really disappointing, we expected whole chicken pieces instead it contained about 50 small shredded pieces and totally tasteless. The Tutti Fruity ice cream was good but the only fruit present was sliced pineapples to our surprise. 

Lastly could not rate it five due to use of stale frozen shrimps, small quantity of food,  indifferent and clueless staffs and baby cockroach running helter-skelter on the table.

Will visit again and will be happy to give more rating next time. 😇😈

It's a good restaurant for chinese. But one problem: You cannot take your family there because of the open bar. Otherwise it's decent enough to go with friends and enjoy some good chinese cuisine.

No doubt that Songhai brings you perfect  combination of phenomenal foods and Drinks with reasonable price. Ambience is also quite good and believe me, you don't have to be on que as the bar has big sitting arrangement.

Ideal for both friends and family. Went there twice. The best part is that they provide alcohol and food at such a low price which is arguably one of the lowest prices for such a well themed family restaurant. Ambience is good. The other thing I felt good is that they provide separate sections for family and stag. Service quality and delivery time is also pretty fast. The place is also easily accessible both by road(Great eastern stop) and Chandni Chowk metro.The only con I found here is that the food was a bit more spicy than expected.P.S. - Keep up the good work.

Song Hay was a heritage and popular bar located on heritage road Waterloo Street beside the then Great Eastern Hotel. For any reason, not known to us, it vanished into the blue. Now this bar has taken it's place. Liquor is cheap. You always get an offer of 1:2 on any one or two brands. Food quality, decor, service is good. It is very popular. Difficult to get table, if you visit in the evening. Long time ago, there was a bar named Sip & Bite in South West corner of Great Eastern, which was very cheap and popular. It had entrance on Waterloo Street. This Manthan Songhai is located just opposite to that place across Waterloo Street.

Food is awesome, we ordered for a pepper chicken, chicken noodle rice and schezuan fish. Also it being a bar cum restaurant , one can order for some alchohol as well.

Went there on a Sunday night. Compared to the other restaurants in that area this place was not overcrowded. Good Ambience. Good Service. Food was good as well. We ordered Jade Fried Fish, Pan Fried Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Garlic Fish and Summer Cooler mocktails. The summer cooler mocktail is actually Aam Panna and was good in taste. The Jade fried fish tastes like Fish butter fry(batter fry) and it was also good in taste. Pan fried chicken was also good. The rice and garlic fish was okayish. So I would recommend this place if you don't find a table in the well known restaurants nearby.

Well,Monthan songhai,we were finding a pocket friendly restaurant for a get together with bar and found this spot in zomato.here goes the review:
 *Location-easy to find whether from chadni chowk or esplanade metro station.
*Ambience-cozy.comfortable seating.first floor is for customers who were there for the booze mainly.And second floor is family area.we were in the 2nd floor as there were girls with us so the 1st floor didn't quite looked comfortable.
*Service-ZERO out of ten.0/10.really frustrating service and ignorant staffs.we had to wait 10-15 mins for a bottle of beer.Food was delivered after  all the delay they could manage.
*Food-which was good in taste and reasonably priced  but again delayed service.
  #Overall,it is a good place to hang out.pocket friendly.good food.but to visit there again I need a strong convincing reason because of the frustrating service they offered.

I think Manthan Songhai is the perfect place of chilling with friends or any special one. This is a very pocket friendly place with a gloomy ambience. It has 2 floors with amazing decoration and well behaved stuffs. They serve a good quality of Chinese food which are very tasty & quantity proportion is enough for anyone. I wanna visit it again. 😄

Finally found the perfect family bar having cheap booze and good chinese food!

Noticed this place while surfing zomato and immediately decided to give it a try. Yesterday saturday evening three of us went there. Place is located near amber resturant, just beside the lalit great eastern. You can either take the lane behind chadni chowk metro gate(exit only) and walk straight, or you can take the next lane left of  paradise cinema (esplaned) and walk straight. 

We entered around 6pm and the place was jam packed. Ground floor is stag section and 1st floor is family section. Ambience is good, dimly lit hanging lights and old chinese decor, tables having chinese zodiac written paper mat. Now the spacing between tables is kind of less, so lots of seating are there. We took seat in a corner having sofa. Now this is a family bar and not a gastro pub, still keeping the old calcutta charm. This place is not for fancy cocktails and loud music, its a place for slow hangovers and addas. 

Staff are polite and helpful. Only negative point is slow service, however to get anything we had to remind the waiter only once. That is acceptable considering the weekend rush. We wanted to have scotch, so the waiter informed us that Black & White scotch was having 2:1 offer but only 2 rounds were available. We happily ordered 60ml each and later ordered BP 30ml each. Black & White 60ml price is rs 262 and BP 30ml is rs 72, which is dirt cheap! Also the booze came with complementary peanuts and salad (with jaljeera and lemon), what more we could ask for! For food we took songhai special pan fried chicken and chicken in chily oyster sauce. Food tasted awesome with booze, had 10 pieces each and cost rs 299 each. In final bill vat was added only on food and service tax was added on all items thus total bill was around rs 2050, total value for money. Had a really great time there. The ground floor stag section might not be that good but the 1st floor is highly reccommended for friends and family. Will definitely visit again and again.

If you want a very good ambience in a bar cum restaurant in a cheaper price this is the place for you.
You can go with friends or with family.
Service is very generous.
Food was parfect.
They serve alcohol with salad and salted nuts.
And the place is not crowded and you can enjoy a calm hangover there.
Last but not the least it is cheap.
(Alcohol-vat incuded price is shown in bar menu
Food-14.5%
Service tax- 6%)

LOVED IT

This place is just perfect for anyday. Located adjacent to The Great Eastern, this bar cum restro has an incredible Chinese décor with dim lights n Feng Shui vibes! The first floor is family section nd we sat there. I was amazed by the service here. Undoubtedly good quality hospitality.
Now, the best part is the food. We'd ordered mix fried rice n chicken mushroom baby corn veg. Each tasted better than the other. Dry chilli chicken was also worth mentioning. The liquor was quite cheap nd so was everything else. Perfect budget friendly hangout!

After a tiring 18 hour bus journey, famished and looking for a shade in the scorching Sun, a group of us friends decided to drop by at the nearest affordable and decent restaurant at Esplanade. And then this name came up. If you're familiar with Amber, walk straight along that lane and you can find this place to the left.

Now, I don't know my way around this area much to be aware of the restaurants tucked in the byplanes, but from the looks of it, it was a fine dining and probably the only place which would have allowed us to walk in with our luggages. We ordered for a hefty comprising of 
1. Crispy Chicken and Chicken Drumstick,
2. Dragon Chicken and Garlic Fish along with Mixed Fried Rice and Mixed Hakka Noodles. 

The food was so comforting and exactly the thing we needed right then. It won't bowl you over, but if you're looking for a nice ambiance with an easy budget, you can check in, and the place won't disappoint. Also, it serves really cheap booze.

I have always been a regular Fan of the original SOG HAY which once ruled and boasted of fab chinese food at authentic prices . I have been going back to this place for the past 10-12 years regularly . Ever since they closed down I was heart broken .
Recently I found out that they had once again opened out under the wing of Manthan which is a next door Indian restaurant . 

I was over joyed and immediately dropped in with my spouse to bring back lost memories and was kind of feeling nostalgic about the whole thing . Manthan Song Hai ( yeah that whats the names changed to ) has retained three or four of their original staff - but I was shocked to see they are under staffed and its like there is only one attendant to every 6 tables . Arijit the earlier attendant has been promoted into the floor in charge was finding it difficult to handle all the tables together . Shamsher who was an attendant earlier has been  made into the Bar tender ( I wonder why ) He was the fastest and the best attendant they ever had at the original Song Hay .

Anyways the food is not bad but not as good as the food the original Song Hay used to serve ( So I guess the cooks have been changed too ) The quantity of food has also deteriorated . I used to love the Veg Manchurian and the Mixed fried rice here , as they were to die for , but now it is just as normal as what you would maybe order from any other restaurant - Nothing special !!

The Pocket pinch is not much for what you order , I would suggest some more floor service boys and attendants and also people with a cooler mind frame ( I do not really blame any of them as a person under pressure any body will offcourse snap and be irritated )  but I would suggest that they offer the same service and the same food thus re creating the ambiance which was once upon a time so famous at this place . The staff did offcourse recognize me which was a good thing but then obviously they would because I was  a regular there every saturday and sunday for 12 years at a streatch

This restaurant is located in the streets of New Market(precisely the back side of the market) near Amber Restaurant. This place serves authentic Chinese cuisine and when you enter from the main door, you will get the feel of being in the streets of China. The dim lights and Chinese lanterns and the interior decorations seem soothing. The seating area has sofas and chairs and are comfortable enough.
I went with 3 other friends after a long journey and had to eat something light yet filling. We ordered-
1.Crispy Chicken(starter) - The chicken pieces were crisp from outside and juicy inside. The pieces were quite big and filling. We shared it and the quantity is good enough.
2. Chicken Hakka Noodles- I love Hakka noodles more than the gravy one. The quantity is really good and two of us shared a plate. Typical dish but it tasted good.
3. Chicken fried rice- This also has a great quantity and two of my friends shared a plate. The rice was well cooked and it was giving that authentic smell of Chinese cuisine.
4- Manchurian Chicken - Thick chicken pieces coated with Manchurian sauce and the covering was soft. It was perfectly cooked and it's medium spicy. Perfectly goes with Hakka noodles and fried rice.
5. Garlic Fish- I always have Garlic chicken,so this time thought of ordering Garlic fish and I wasn't disappointed. The fish was soft and tender and tasted really well. The garlic portions were perfectly mixed in the dish. It is medium spicy.
The presentation of the dishes are fine enough, can be improved. The service is commendable. The quantity is really good and the food quality is remarkable. The food tastes really good. The price is reasonable inspite of the location of the restaurant. I would definitely suggest everyone to visit this restaurant.

We ordered beer. 2 portions of chicken in hot garlic sauce, 2 portions of masala chips (innovative option), prawns. They served peanuts as complimentary with drinks. Total bill Rs.1800. What more can one ask for. Am I delighted, yes. Am I going there again, yes.

If you are looking for a place, which serves booze at cheap price and offers a calm and cozy environment, this is your place. Ideal for romantic dates, as the place does not experience huge crowd.
Highly underrated in terms of low price of booze and food.
It is located near Chadni Chowk metro, walkable distance, 10 min walk.
Coming to the food, we ordered pepper chicken, pan fried chicken and finger chips. Food was awesome, especially pepper chicken.
Beers were served cold. Staffs were courteous, and friendly. However, the service was not prompt. We had to wait 15 mins to get our order placed.

Otherwise, it was a good experience..
Will visit soon...

Located beside Lalit Great Eastern, in the lane opposite to Raj Bhavan, Manthan Songhai is one of the most underrated restaurants of Kolkata. It has a nice, quiet ambience with a wonderful decor. It is also a very unpopulated place and the food is delicious at a very cheap rate. Even the booze is cheap over here. We had Chicken Hakka Chow for main course and felt the quantity could have been a tad more. The Pepper Chicken was delicious. For drinks, we had Royal Stag to cap off a nice lunch. 
P.S. One of the waiters is a bit forgetful.

A chicken meifoon soup which was really light. The fish fingers and the fried szechwan chicken for starters were amazing. Soft and huge pieces of starters. The fish was flaky and had no smell. The fried rice and dragon chicken for main course was good as well.the quantity and quality both are really good. The bill came to 1028 for so many items. Highly recommended.

Ordered food via another delivery app. Delivery was smooth and on time. Was a bit skeptical about ordering but went ahead and ordered. Loved every bit of the things ordered. A chicken meifoon soup which was really light. The fish fingers and the fried szechwan chicken for starters were amazing. Soft and huge pieces of starters. The fish was flaky and had no smell. The fried rice and dragon chicken for main course was good as well.the quantity and quality both are really good. The bill came to 1028 for so many items. Highly recommended.

I came to this restaurant cum bar with a friend yesterday.The decor was quite classy with low placed lamps,red walls and Chinese artworks inspite of the cheap price tag of booze and food.2:1 offer was going on for few brands of whiskeys.We settled for a 3 large pegs of signature premier whiskey with a big glass bottle of thums-up each alongside a plate of French fries and schezuan fried chicken.The chakna of badaam,jaljeera,salads and ginger slices were also given.
The snacks were well made and they were a good accompaniment with the drinks.The schezuan fried chicken were not what we expected.Big strips of fried chicken were given with a schezuan dipping sauce.We expected something like dry schezuan chicken.The dish tasted good though.
Service was efficient and waiters were well-mannered.
It's a place of choice for having alcohol and good food in a nice ambience without burning a hole in pocket.

Good food at quite reasonable price. Service is good. Interior is nice. They even offer foods beyond the menu according to customer's taste.
Today was my second visit there. One of the staff recommended chicken in oyster sauce and pepper chicken. Both of them were spicy and delicious.

Been there for the first time for a bhai fota treat given by my sister to her three brothers including me. It was recommended by our father since he had their meal before but we didnt get the chance. A nice nd cosy place with huge sitting arrangement in two floors( ground nd 1st). A very reasonable place to have calcutta style chinese along with drinks. Our big bro had a Blenders which costed just Rs.128 excluding taxes. We had ordered 3 mixed rice 1chilli chicken 3 mongolian prawn 1 american chopsuey. Quantity and quality was nice but the one thing that needs improvement is their service, too much slow. There were only three or four tables that had customers but it was soo slow of them to serve food nd even slow to provide the bill. That is y i have rated them 4 instead of a 5 in 5.

Low price,good food, brilliant service, decent ambience but expect some crunchy insects, grilled cockroach in your food. Today I was there with my best pal to celebrate Mahalaya.. discovered an insect swimming in the sauce with the french fries. Later again with my peg of vodka..

Manthan songhai is located just opposite to the lalit great eastern hotel. It is very easy to locate. 
The place is well decorated and quite spacious. 
I went there with my family so we were seated on the first floor. The ambience was average. 
Coming to the food.... For starters, we ordered songhai special fish which tasted fine..it was soft and well cooked... And bamboo chicken which tasted good... It was a little spicy and was well cooked and juicy. The for the main course, we had mixed meifoon and chicken pepper fried. The miefoon tasted good. Although it was mixed, we rarely found any piece of prawn. And the chicken was yummy. It was well cooked, a little spicy and tasted great.

Been there for a friend's birthday treat. It's easy to find and is a 5 minute walk from the Chandni Chowk metro and is in the opposite to the Lalit great Eastern. 
It boasts of unbelievably cheap alcohol which is a plus point and cheap food too. The food is decent and the prices are great for a meal and booze. 
We ordered lots of food and booze and it summed to just around 2900 for a group of six people. The staff is decent as well and the decor is good. 
It can get a bit shady in the evenings but do visit this place for a lunch maybe to avoid the weird crowds.

Good place for some nice food along with some booze.
But still not recommend for the foodies as its just casual dining here.
Yet if you are around and hungry and don't want to burn a hole in your pocket come here and have some relaxed time.

Tip for management:- ambience can be a bit more pleasant. (I know its a bar cum restaurant still i felt so).

Slightly difficult to locate, but then, totally worth the effort.
This place is impeccably organised, clean and well decorated, but do not be fooled, the good and the alcohol are not expensive at all ! There also is a dedicated smoking area, which is really cool because you don't have to go out and smoke in between your drinks. 

The food was lip smacking.

Two thumbs up for the service and food !

Just opposite to Lalit Great Eastern on Waterloo Street is this small patch of Chinese delicacies. You open the door and a plush red and black embellished decor welcomes you.
It was a Sunday afternoon and hence the staffs were mostly roaming around and this lead to a delay in delivery of services. However, this drawback was veiled by the taste and aroma of the food. The order consisted of Crispy Chicken, Fried Jade Chicken, Hong Kong Prawn and Singapore Fried Rice.
Authentic Chinese flavour was what we were served with. Steaming and flavourful food will definitely make your taste buds  happy and justify what you spend on the food.
Ambience, food, novel menu and price makes it a recommendation for a happy lunch with friends.

A sultry Sunday noon when hunger struck the chords, Mantha Shonghai came in as an angel to save the souls from dying. This is an age old restro which serves Chinese food and cheap booze. This stands unaltered im the backdrop of changing kolkata. Well, I am quite nostalgic about this joint where I used to go as a young child with my parents. So relieving all the moments, thus I begin my journey.

Location : this is located near the lalit great eastern. The easiest way to reach is, getting down as esplanade metro, walk towards paradise cinema hall. And then take the left to loacate amber. A minute's walk straight from amber and you locate songhai on the left foot.

Decor : on entering , I was mesmerised to see the joint. Typically old kolkata restro, with chandeliers hanging down from the ceiling on each table. A typical dimly lit restro. The wood patches drawn to form a false ceiling. Since we were seated on the first floor family section , the bar lay open. I wish the bar had tall chairs for us to be seated.

Ambience : the ambience is quite decent. The dim light, the cosy sofas, quite a place where you can sit and chat on a Sunday afternoon. 

Staffs : the staffs are ever courteous. They were short of staffs on Sunday, but the service was not even an inch less. Anirban da served us well, with all smiles and suggesting the signature dishes of manthan. Anirban da will solely be the one reason  I will go back to manthan.

Food: and this was about sufficng two hungry souls, so just food could not have fixed it. Good food was the solution to end this.

Beverages-
1. Tuborg Strong
2. Smirnoff with lime cordial
To be real honest, such cheap booze is kind of hard to locate in Kolkata pubs. From now on, manthan is THE place for me.

Food-
Starters -
1. Crispy jade chicken - now this one seemed quite innovative in the Appetizers section. The order came in another 8-10 minutes . It was crispy, buttery, tempura batter fried chicken Marinated in green chutney. The chicken was succulent and this tasted heavenly. A sure recommendation.

2. Chilli shrimp - this took a bit of more time than was expected. The shrimp was properly minced and the chilli flavour was really felt on the tasted buds. However I believe a lot more garlic would have helped that typical smell of the shrimp to wear off. This was needed for sure.
Mains-
1. Mixed fried rice- coming to the portion, it was decent to serve 2 people. The amazing aroma coming out of the rice, it had huge portion of chicken and prawn which is rare these days. It tasted heavenly. I do not mind commenting it as one of the better rices in kolkata.

2. Red pepper chicken - this eas anirban da's suggestion. Indeed , this complemented the fried rice really well. This dish also stands out by itself due to the rich taste and aroma of garlic and paprika. Definitely a favourite for people loving spicy treats. The chicken however is really well Marinated, soft and wholesome.

Value for money : I believe this is one of the cheap great restros of kolkata, given to the quality of food they serve. Ultimately, the money is worth spending over here.

Well this is a place a place, a major discovery for me. I will keep on visiting the place - Anirban da, cheap booze and amazing food that they serve. Why wait? Just jump in to manthan the next weekend and experience the world of aunthentic chinese cuisine at nominal rates.
Cheers!!
Happy eating!!

I have been an ardent fan of this place for quite a long long time, say it for its awesome dishes or for the offers they give on drinks..  The staffs are very courteous & pocket pinch is quite friendly. I love the 'Bamboo chicken', I repeat it each time I go there. They give 2:1 offer on drinks most of the time. Lastly, about the ambience, it's very cozy.

VALENTINE'S DAY SPECIAL 2016
LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: After hopping for so many restos around the city joy this was my first ever visit to a Resto cum bar on the Valentine's Day with friends. The feeling was very mixed as i never had an experience like this. This place falls at esplanade near the bentinck street one min walking ahead from the well known resto amber. it has good amount of fame and name at this particular place. the look from the outer gate will keep you guessing until you move in.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: Ambiance is not a huge one on the lower tire where we were sitting. But its looks quite decent and well interiored. The looks somehow made me remember Mocambo. Sitting was nice and good with well furnished comfortable chairs and sofas. Lights are just perfect for such place and a LCD tv hanged for your entertainment. there is a side bar too for your quick service as well as chinese zodiac signs are placed on the table for your knowledge and time pass.  Staffs are polite and well mannered. Listens to you quickly and understands what you want.

FOOD:
After dinning in it has to be some wines, beers etc when you seat with people who loves to drink. Thou that was not my part. I was all interested in the food stuffs here. We started with the Dragon chicken which was very tastey indeed. The chicken marinated very well. It was soft and juicy. Breaking easily with fork and spoon. Second starter was Crispy Chicken which was indeed very crispy. The sweet and sour taste was very good in it. Thirdly we had the Garlic and Sezwan chicken on the table together. Both of them just did fabulous justice to my tounge. The garlic chicken was nicer as well as the sezwan was on the top of it. With all the four of the starters i was highly satisfied and happy until and unless we had the fifth which was Songhai Special chicken that completely threw us in deep dilemma after having such wonderful dishes. It was very pale. The was just like having a chicken fry in fish flavour. Disappointed with it.

FIRST FOUR STARTERS: 8.5/10

S SPL CHICKEN: 6/10

QUALITY AND QUANTITY: Quality of the dishes was no doubt very nice. thou a bar so the quality has to be above average. the quantity was decent, good for three. prices are fine as per the Resto cum bar. But thou i think the prices are quite less if we talk about others.

CONCLUSION: Didn't Expect the evening to be so wonderful with those amazing starters. I guess how would be the main course here. Definitely will be coming here again for the main courses.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Been here for the first time with my wife for working lunch. Food was mediocre, rather below average. Had ordered egg Hakka noodles and corn & mushroom side dish in red garlic sauce. Noodles were okay but the gravy of the side dish was sour and tasted stale. 

Restaurant interiors were pretty ordinary and staff cared the least.

Went there today afternoon to grab a couple of beers with my buddies, while browsing through their menu settled our minds on dragon chicken (being a great fan of dragons :p ) and ordered it. It was really good the taste was grt and service is really good the place is nicely decorated although there is place for improvement...newys lets not get nit picky over here all n all the overall experience was good and the cherry on the cake is the price which is killer...so if u r looking for a place to have good fun on a budget dont wait up...

It makes great sense to go here ........but ONLY IF   your office is located in dalhousie , esplanade, chandni chowk  or new market area .

For more fortunate ones , having office at sector 5 , park-street , exide , elgin , or AJC bose road ............ there are loads of better options  available .

Now let me explain why this place gets such high stars .  Cheap Alcohol clubbed with good-enough chinese spread does the trick for them .

Coming to the location & my first impression about this place when i visited along with a friend today .

LOCATION  :  Lalit  GREAT EASTERN Hotel in dalhousie  ??? ... take the adjacent lane to that , also known as waterloo street . walk 3 mins you'll find the much famous WILSON'S PUB of lalit great eastern . Bang opposite to that you'll find manthan group of restaurants ........ including manthan songhai , manthan banquets & manthan chinese . Make sure you enter Songhai & NOT Other Manthan restaurants .

FIRST IMPRESSION :   Horrible   !!! ........ waterloo street is nothing but a narrow dingy bylane of dalhousie .... infested with rats  .  I walk up towards Songhai ........ Again a dilapidated building ..... probably 100 years old .......... my heart sinks ..... " what a Mistake " i thought to myself to come here with a  Friend .

& THEN .......... THEN ........... I ENTER   !!   ........ Believe me or not ............ the interiors are CLASSY ( to say the least ) ........ it can even match the decor of  Moulin rouge  or trincas of park street ....... no kidding !!! ......... the seating area of Ground  Floor can accommodate  80-100 people ....... No joke !!! .... & Yet You Cannot believe this Till the time you ENTER ..... which i did..... thankfully .

we Got a seat just beside the BAR on the ground floor . The Bar is pretty well stocked .... considering the location .... it even  has some RARE Single malts .   

Me & my friend however decided to play it safe . I ordered  1 Large peg  ( 60 ml ) of bacardi carta blanca ( white rum  ) .... my friend ordered 2 Small pegs ( 30 ml  each ) of the Same ......... along with 2 bottles of sprite ...... Not to forget we also ordered a plate of chilly babycorn in starters .

Service was quick ...... chilly Babycorn was Good enough ..... after finishing our drinks we  felt a bit hungry ... so thought of exploring the food menu ......... after much deliberations we settled for 1 plate of Shrimp Cantonese Noodles  & 1 plate of  Hot & Sour garlic  Fish .... the items arrived in 15 mins ..... .... cantonese noodles ( gravy )  was real good ..... can compete with Tung Naam or golden joy  in taste ..... Hout & sour garlic fish ( gravy )  was good too ....... but nothing out of the world ..... it had 11 -14 small diced fish pieces ... which was a new thing for me ..... as  I had diced chicken dishes before but never diced Fish  pieces in a chinese restaurant .... needless to say we finished them off real quick ..... overall a satisfactory lunch ....

Coming to the bill ......... It came At a reasonable 972 Rs for the two of us .

the break up is as follows 

1 Large peg bacardi white :  Rs 128 

2 small pegs bacardi white: Rs 68 X 2 = Rs 136 

2 bottles of  sprite               :  Rs 35 X 2 = Rs 70 

1 plate chilli baby corn         : Rs 132

1 plate shrimp cantonese chow : Rs 126

1 plate Hot N sour garlic fish  : Rs 249

-------------------------------------------------------------

Total :  Rs 841   + VAT + Service tax  = Rs 972 

Overall verdict :  Great decor & Ambiance ........ But SHITTY LOCATION ........ Most well stocked Bar in Dalhousie after  lalit great eastern ........ Alcohol is Cheap ...food is NOT 

SO .... Should you Go   ????? .............. Only If  you are the KIND which prefers ......... Tung nam ,  Eau Chew  or  Crystal Chimney ..OVER BAR-B-Q , Tung Fong .... or the Kind which prefers  OLYPUB , OPIUM , .....over ......Someplace Else , Roxy ( park hotel one ) .

 Hope I am clear ......... decide for yourself ..... 3.5/5 from my side .

Today I have been here with my friends. Foods are delicious. we had Singapore fried rice, singapore noodles, bamboo chicken. Drinks are available and pocket friendly too. Lovely space for Couples. Service is good. But some care should be taken of washroom.

Ambience is great for the price!
The Fried Jade Chicken is a great non spicy option. Battered and fried.
The Chinese main course is like any other standard restaurant.
Thumbs up for the service and price is cheaper compared to restaurants of this stature.

Manthan Songhai, formerly known as Song Hay - Double Happiness, used to serve some of the best pork dishes in Calcutta, and for the several years that I was stationed in Calcutta, I would visit at least once every week to satisfy my craving for chilli roast pork with a couple of bottles of Foster's. I happened to be in the city after nearly three years and was passing through Esplanade when I felt that familiar craving and headed straight for Song Hay. I was in for a rude shock. The folks over at Manthan had taken over from the Chinese family that used to run the place. Song Hay had been renamed, the 'Double Happiness' had been done away with. Ominous, but that craving for chilli roast pork made me enter nonetheless. The ambiance was brighter, some familiar faces were sighted, and I settled down at one of the tables on the ground floor near the bar. First turn-off: a group of waiters were squabbling at the bar, apparently over sharing tips, completely oblivious to the fact that there was a customer eagerly waiting for service. The waiter's tip just got slashed in half. Then came the knockout punch: they no longer serve pork! No, no chilli roast pork, no pork rice noodles, no pork period. And no explanations were offered even! I don't think I have ever rushed out of a restaurant like that before. As I walked towards Chung Wah on Central Avenue, tucked away behind the Chandni Chowk Metro Station, where they still serve chilli roast pork, I felt sad, like as if I had just become aware of an old friend passing away... goodbye Double Happiness! Your pork dishes will be sorely missed.

Was introduced to this place by my bro who works in esplanade and is a regular here.We just went for a couple of drinks.Nice cosy place where we could sit down and watch the IPL final..The starter items..crispy potato and Shredded chicken were plentiful and was tasty and also affordable.The cosy seats and the neat ambience coupled up wd prompt waiters and service is satisfactory...Will I bring my friends here again? Definitely :)

Well 1st of all the place is located near great eastern in esplanade...the ambience is good...shows ipl matches while u crumble away the food..and coming to the food it is of ok quality..me and my friends went there and ordered drumsticks,some special type of prawn rice going with the drinks...the food was ok quality although the side dish of schezewan chicken was good...the service was very good and prompt and the waiters were friendly..overall if u want cheap booze and good food...don't expect overwhelming quality and quantity though...surely check out this place once.

'Manthan Songhai' is located at Waterloo street near Dacer's Lane,Esplanade.It is just opposite of The Lalit Great Eastern Hotel,beside the Manthan Hotel & Bar.Today I've visited here with my friends for lunch.Ground floor is Bar & Bachelor section,Family section is on the 1st floor.Ambience is very attractive,huge seating arrangements are here.Full wall is decorated with chinese show pieces,pictures etc.We've entered here at 3:45 pm.Atfirst we ordered here one plate Drums of Heaven & one plate Schezwan fried fish with 2 peg Signature.After 10 minutes the food has came.Drums of heaven is tasty,it has 6 pcs chicken marinated with sauce.Schezwan Fried Fish is also delicious,It has 8 pcs.Then we ordered One plate Egg Hakka Noodles,One plate Egg Fried Rice,one plate American Chopsey,one plate Dragon chicken & one plate Schezwan Prawn.Egg Hakka Noodles is delicious.Egg Fried rice is average.Dragon chicken is not so good,Chicken pieces are too hard,gravy is good.I don't taste Amercian Choupsey & Schezwan prawn,because I don't like both of them.Waiters are very friendly & well behaved.Price is very reasonable.Food quality & quantity both are good.We have spent here almost 2 hours 30 minutes.

Located in Waterloo street opposite the Lalit Great Eastern this is a decent place for cheap booze and decent Chinese food.They have two sections-the ground floor is mainly the bar cum restaurant while upstairs is the family restaurant.We seated ourselves in the ground floor.The ambiance and decor is quite decent.The seating arrangements were nice and comfortable.Probably they have revamped the place recently.

Coming to the food,we had a chicken lolly pop,mixed chowmein and a dragon chicken to go with our drinks.The mixed chowmein and the dragon chicken was pretty average.The quantity of the dragon chicken was good but the quality was a let down.The chicken did not seem to be marinated and just seemed to have been dunked into the gravy which again was rather tasteless.The Chicken lolly pop though was quite good-nice and crisp and tasty.

The drinks are extremely cheap and that is one major attraction of this place it seemed.Many locals streamed in for a quick drink as the evening wore on.Hence the crowd might not be the best at all times.The service was more or less swift.They also have a giant tv screen which showcases ipl matches while they are on but at other times some stupid hindi serial was on which irritated the life out of me!

Overall this Chinese restaurant with cheap drinks and a decent ambiance does give the feel of China Town Tangra right in the heart of Kolkata.But the quality of the food needs improvement and also there was no pork on the menu which is sure to disappoint many like me.

There are really very few decent places in kolkata which will serve U alcohol at such a pocket frndly price .. D decor is quiet decent .A few chinese dishes like dragon chicken nd chicken lollipop goes quiet well with beer ..But, dey dont play music,nd always keeps showing some stupid tv channels,which sometime even ruins d ambience .But overall its a nice place to get high at a very nominal price ....

This place is situated at 3, Waterloo Street. From esplaned walk straight beside K.C Das till New Aliah Hotel and then take left, after walking 5 mins, it will be on your left. Also its near to great eastern hotel.

This place is superb for dining. Specially their Chinese cuisine. Staffs were polite and quick service.

Now coming to the food, we ordered chicken hot and sour soup, which was good, then we tried their dragon chicken, which was excellent (a must try) in my opinion and shrimp rice noodles, and again they surprise us with good quality and quantity.

Pocket pinch: 500 for 2

Ambience: well decorated with a bar.

If you want to spend some quality time with good food with your close ones, then this is the place.

Lastly, here alcohol is very much affordable.

I really liked this place... The decoration and ambiance of this restaurant was very nice, dimly lit place... We ordered mixed fried rice and dragon chicken... Dragon chicken was awesome and mixed fried rice was nice... Staffs were very polite and helpful and service was very quick... Price is very pocket friendly... Overall, nice place to spend your time with your partner... I would like to visit this place again....

Intro: On entering I felt " wow nice place"
Really nice ambience dimly lit,  yet not too dark , liked the red dining lights, it gave enough light on the things that are most crucial " food" and ensured a dimly lit up feel for the foodies! Really liked the interiors. 
Food :
Dragon Chicken - Really fiery , really Dragon like ! ...Naturally...Spicy , yet tasted superb. However I found the chicken a bit hard,should have been much tender.The use of onion was perfect in the gravy - liked it . Overall good 3.5/5
Chicken Fried Rice - I really enjoyed the fried rice ,it tasted yummy, adequate chicken , veggies well used , not very oily - 4/5
Qty - Dragon Chicken -  Decent , Fried rice - a bit on the lesser side
Service - Helpful,smiling staff , food came very fast 4/5
Overall 4/5 - Good place, good ambience, good food ,good service

I really liked the ambiance here, dimly lit place. The light is perfect to take pics/ selfies. Food is good, at least i like it. If you consider the ROI, its very good, friendly to your pocket. Even the hard drinks are priced very competitively.
Location is also decent, 5-7 mins walk from chandi chowk metro station, just opposite to Great eastern hotel, Very close to my office :). Nice place have your lunch or to start off weekends immediately after office.

I specially liked the dragon chicken and mixed Hakka noddle there. Overall its a nice place to fill your tummy.

A chienese restaurant situated in the office para of kolkata, at Dalhousie area. After renovation, the ambience of the restaurant became a plus point. Food not at all costly. But the quality and taste varies day to day. Good and quick service. Cheap booze and bustling crowd of the office para. Intellectual discussions after office. All are plus points. But I won't recommend this restaurant if u njoy Chinese cuisine. It is a mediocre restaurant suitable for after office stress relief. Cheers....

This place is tough to locate, and the crowd is erm...but people come here to drink, coz booze is really cheap. Predictably starters aren't too bad, though quality cannot be guaranteed. The chilly chicken wings was decent, and they serve reliable alcohol. The portion size is neat, but the food is not at all cheap like one would think with a nameless place like this. Also, if you are a woman, make sure you have a man to accompany you, if you happen to visit this place.

One of the best secrets Esplanade has to offer, the place has become all the more appealing after renovation. Be it a couple of drinks with friends or a cozy dinner with your loved ones, you are bound to enjoy the good food the place has to offer. Be it the garlic prawns, Or the golden coins, and one should always try bamboo chicken, though its not featured in the menu, it's the best chicken dish they have. 
Great ambience, good food and above all affordable price, makes this place a winner.
