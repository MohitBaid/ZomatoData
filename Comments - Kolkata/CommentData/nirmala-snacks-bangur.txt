Used to have rolls here for a long time when I used to go for coaching in bangur. The rolls were light , and soft but the stuffings could have been better.

This is the place from where I start my 1st home delivery. This is a local restaurant from where I mainly took rolls and chowmein for evening snacks. Now the taste and food quality were decreased gradually. There rumali roti and tawa roti is good till now.

Place for home delivery... The best thing is their rumali ruti... Some of the people says its over priced but come on at this moment of inflation one rumali roti at 5 is fine

Overpriced. Food quality is below average. Service is good. Ambience not so great. Not a treat to the eyes. Doesn't seem too hygienic. No special dishes. Just the place to catch if you're really hungry and this is what is at your dispose. If you do want to get something from this place, my suggesting would be chicken roll if non veg and tarka of you're veg. The only two things here that look and taste good. But try to get parcels as the place would make you sick of you opt for eating there. It stenches.
