Whenever I go to esplanade for shopping I make sure to eat here. This place is nicely decorated with dim lights , a cozy environment it creats. Coming to the food, it is highly affordable and set its own standard when comes to quality as well as quantity. This place is underrated but if you are looking for authentic Thai food this place needs a visit. Only 5% get with no service tax the bill was around rs1200 for 3 of us.

Visited this restaurant on 31st Dec. The ambience of this one is unique. Located just beside the scoop. Dont know for what reason this restro always remains vacant.
We ordered their bang bang dish as starter along with beer. Price of the drink menu is pretty affordable.
And quality of food is good as well as quantity. Staffs are courteous & service is good. Lastly we had khai dao, which tasted like nornal fried egg, nothing new.

I visited this place for my birthday and it has made my day even more special. I had a sumptuous birthday treat over there with some really mouth watering dishes, excellent service and wonderful ambience. Soup has always been my most favourite and primary   dish to start my meal with and at Spice Project the special creamy Thai soup was one the best soups I ever had.

Located just beside the scoops..The ambiance is nice and cozy.. The food tastes amazing.. I just love the dessert.What's better than having a cup full of freshly baked brownie with the layers of vanilla icecream n fresh cream?? oh mustn't forget the caramel sauce on roasted nuts n the cherry on topüçí.  I totally loved it.. Main course n Starter were great too.. Quantity was pretty much fine..The price was reasonable..Hope to visit it again..

Went for dinner tonite. Good ambience. The fried pepper chicken was okay, the chicken was not soft. we then had the red curry with rice... and it was not good. i think either the thai curry paste or the coconut milk they used had a pungent smell which i did not like... though it was not like it was not eatable.

This place has become one of my favourite. I have tried quite a number of dishes whenever I wander in new market. All the dishes I had were surprisingly amazing. A Thai cuisine with a pocket friendly budget. Anyone can indulge into some good prawns and fish after some shopping. The music, the interior designs and the arrangement is spectacular. Keep up the good work.

Ambience 3/5
service its 1/5 
Food 3/5 ...  
I orderd Tom yum soup and some fish with basil in starter.. and for mains we ordered for hakka noodle with some chicken sidedish .. we didn't like the sidedish so we told a server kindly take this with u coz it taste horrible... and we cancel that and order for some other side dish....  but the server was forcing us to have that sidedish which was pathetic . Thus , we left the place very disheartened and even gave tips to that server... which he didnt deserve at all.

It was a sudden visit. To my surprise the experience was pretty good! The restaurant is located in the core of the city in a small lane at esplanade. The ambience was bit of mixed graphitic‚Äã and ethnic. We ordered for pan fried chilli fish in starter and in main course we opted for pan fried non veg gravy noodles. The quality of the starter was not bad. The taste was amazing. The pan fried gravy noodles had lots of vegetable and chicken which was really nice. The quantity was enough for 2 people. All in one a small place to hang out at any time. The decor and the ambience will make your experience a little better and it won't burn your pocket also üòä

Well this small nook serves great food. Just beside scoop, this place serves asian food. the ambiance created with flowing white drapes, crude lights and high ceiling is romantic and calm. the Sa te Kai was chicken on sticks similar to the ones available in the streets of Bangkok. it was non spicy perfect for children. The crunchy prawns were good too. Burnt garlic fried rice and Sam Rot fish preparations tasted well. Try the spicey mango, Man now and Khing Ding are good accompaniments!

P.s-Do check or rather wash your glasses before you serve drinks in them.

A small but well decorated restaurant in New Market. The staffs are well behaved. Now coming to the food we ordered Chicken with basil leaf, Sam tah chicken and Thai mixed gravy Noodles. It tasted really good no doubt and in gravy noodles there were lots of chickens, veggies and shrimps. Quantity is enough for two people. Overall it was quite good experience. Would love to come here again.

Stopped by this restro in new market area for a quick lunch after a hectic shopping parade. The place was empty to be honest but due to the heat outside the place looked and felt heavenly. It has a lounge beside it which looked nice. Ambience was good and sober. Not the usual shallow crowd that you bump into often in this area. Staffs were prompt and presentable.
Now coming to food- we orderd for crunchy prawn which was yummilicious. Quite big the prawns were which was unexpected as the price was 300/-. The taste was really nice with a crunchy exterior. Next we had the chicken hakka noodles which was good but personally i felt the salt component was on the higher side. They need to balance the flavour more. Price was 175/-which again was reasonable and the quantity is good for 2 adults. With noodles we had bang bang chicken gravy which was good but not that great or out of the world. It was priced at 195/-.
Price wise the restaurant serves good food quantity and quality wise. I think its a good place if you are on a budget and yet want to go to a nice fancy restaurant.

Spice Project is a new addition to Esplanade. Situated beside Scoop Spice Project is mainly a Thai Restaurant. The decor and ambience here is very impressive. We had Aunty Pipo (Crispy Fried Babycorn) for starters. It was very good and one of the bests I ever had. For the main course we had Mixed Jasmine Rice and Bang Bang Chicken. I fell in the love with the Jasmine Rice- full of flavours and interesting taste. Compared to that Bang Bang chicken did not impress me much as it lacked the thickness and taste. Overall the experience was good and I could have given it 4 but 3.5 for the service. The staffs were friendly but service was too slow and they barely were even visible around us. But I wull definitely give it a visit again just for the Jasmine Rice.

Been there one fine afternoon. Located just in the heart of new market. The interiors of the place was quite attractive as it was decorated with white curtains and graffiti on the walls. Ordered sun dry lamb for starters. This dish was a sure disappointment. The quantity was too less and the meat pieces were too hard to chew and was served with raw vegetables which was not edible at all. Then for main course we ordered, chicken hakka chow and chicken jasmine rice. The chow was like any other normal hakka chow but the jasmine rice was way too good. It had a different flavour and aroma to it which was quite new to me, along with it we ordered bang bang chicken which was good too. The quantity is perfect for two.

Located in the narrow alley connecting Lindsay street and New Empire this Thai delite serves you mouth watering dishes. They have an exotic taste o food that will bring you back here again n again. The Amazing decor with grafiti n feng shui show piece makes the ambience breathtaking. Still I wouldn't rate this place above 4 because o the quantity o food they serve. Well, it's undoubtedly a place where you get budget Thai food but in a negligible quantity. I am really not happy with the quantity o food they serve. Rest is all in place.

Just for a change from regular Indian and Chinese cuisine one should try the thai food served here... the food served here is delicious  and so is the ambience. There is a fine mix of flavour and spices in the dishes and one might feel them easily. On top of everythng service was good and on time. The place is also not overcrowded unlike other restaurants in the region.so one should try this place if they are planning to have food in the Esplanade region.

It took a bit of time to figure out where the restaurant was. Attempted to call up the restaurant for directions using the Zomato app but calls went unanswered. We reached around 1200 and figured that the "Closed" signage meant that it would be a while before business started. Worked through some errands around the area and then returned back. The restaurant was open, in business but had not started off in full swing (one could hear a staff joshing about and such).

Menus were quickly put out and we selected a small set of things. Thai Herbs Mixed with Lamb and Spicy Crunchy Prawn as starters; Spicy Mango Juice on Crushed Ice as drinks; Spicy Chicken (marinated with chilly paste and garnished with kaffir lime leaf) along with Basil Spicy Fried Rice with egg as the mains.

The Lamb starter turned up incredibly quickly ¬†- it took us by surprise. The rest of the items though, came along in a sort of haphazard manner. I would recommend almost all the items except for the mocktail - it would receive 'A' for effort; but it is really a humdrum execution. I'd specially recommend the crunchy prawn - it did make for an excellent choice. The food portions were sufficient for the 2 of us. And notwithstanding the lurching and unstable nature of the table - the meal was enjoyable.¬†

The property has paid great attention to the interiors and while it at first appears to be kitschy - it is not. The high ceilings are a nice thing to have. The staff were attentive, mostly let us be - and for that they receive praise. I wish the establishment would choose to keep a board of "specials" or, "recommended for the day" - that often helps set a guiding path on what to choose.

All said, I think we were too early today. It is likely that it picks up a lively pace later in the day - so table reservations might just be good to do.

At the very outset, let me set the tone for this review (if my rating hasn't successfully done it already) ‚Äì I was really REALLY disappointed with the service!

My friends and I had checked in to this restaurant around 4:30 in the evening and the place was mostly empty. Since only one of us was actually hungry, ¬†we just ordered¬†a bowl of soup. Within 15-20 minutes of the arrival of the soup, they just dumped the bill on the table without us having asked for it yet, and despite the fact that our friend was clearly not done eating. Following that, they kept pestering us every two minutes till we settled the bill and left even before we could finish the hot soup. ¬†¬†
¬†
I think it is pertinent to add here that a majority of tables there were unoccupied at the time. Furthermore, when the waiter came to collect the bill, which was within 7-10 minutes of the bill having been presented to us, he was extremely rude and said that they don't allow a table to be held for so long for just a bowl of soup. While I get that it's a valid argument during rush hours, it made zero sense on a day when they hardly had any business. And, in any case, why is it so revolting an idea to let us spend just a measly 30 minutes on a bowl of soup?¬†

Anyway, our moods were effectively ruined and we couldn't enjoy our time there. And even though the soup wasn't bad, we're never going back there ever again!

In addition, the music from the adjoining disc was messing with the ambiance of the place.

Located beside Scoop... ¬†Ambiance is good..
Went there for lunch.. Ordered Chicken Garlic Peeper salt, veg fried rice and chilli chicken.. Food is average..
But what was most annoying for me was their service.. They are very slow.. After serving starter we had to find them to serve main course... ¬†same case happened at the time of paying bill.. Otherwise it's not a bad option..

We had ordered for..
Crispy chicken...The chicken was juicy, crunchy and less spicy..
Chicken Hakka noodles... It had the perfect Thai taste...little burnt and less spicy..
Fresh lime soda...It was also good and tasted wow!!
To end of...
A must try for all Chinese lovers and also a great attraction for the alcohol lovers because the price of alchohol is unbelievably low!!!

So, Oriental Plaza is back in a new avatar.. better foods and upgraded service and a whole new addition of Thai dishes.. The most attractive proposition is defintely the location of the place at the back side of New Empire and an array of authentic and flavourful dishes served at such an Economical rate.. Well the ambiance gives you a bit rustic feeling, a dark themed interior with lanterns hanging from the high ceiling and metallic finishes, an elevated inside dining area with comfortable sofas.. and a bit unsual spray paints done to decorate the Walls..
Service was good, appropriate and timely..also the servers are well aware of their special preparations..but what turns our mood down was the fact that majority of the Liquor menu was not available,not even Lime Soda.. Coming to food:
Thai Hot and Sour Soup: Finished with coriander leaves on top, a fiery, red hot preparation.. loved the aroma of lemongrass and the tanginess of the sauce..
Thai Chilli Garlic and Basil Fish: A thai twist to the pan fried variation.. though not much thai in flavours but the 8 pieces of moderate chunks of crispy, fresh fishes were well cooked..
Thai Style Fried Chicken: This was different and tasteful too.. This more like a Chicken Wings dish sauted in a thai sauce.. loved the crispness of the Chicken Skin.. shows the expertise of the chef.. also the pieces were huge in size..
Mixed Chilli Garlic Noodles: The portion was generous.. not too oily, a bit on the hotter side and ample presence of veggies and proteins.. Only thing they seemed to serve a bit thinner noodles, more like Rice Noodles..
Pad Thai: Lovely..won't comment on the authenticity but the presentation was a treat to the eyes.. Topped with crumbles of peanuts.. the lime accompanying the dish when sprinkled over the flat noodles actually elevate the dish..a word of caution for the Fain-hearts..this might not be your cup of tea..
Prawn cooked in Three Flavour Sauce: 6 pieces of tiger prawns cooked in a three flavoured sauce.. the pieces were a bit too small and the sauce was watery,lacked consistency..
Overall it was a whole some meal..the BEST PART..all this food for just Rs.1613/-(all incl) for 4 people!! and to add more, you get your whole bill deducted during your next visit..You just can't eat once..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

I WAS DUMB FOUNDED AFTER SEEING THE BILL. LOTS OF FOODS AND DRINKS....BILL WAS SO LESS.....JUST AMAZING!!!

* Location : Just located @ opposite lane of Lindsey st Sreeleathers, beside Scoop, formerly known as Oriental plaza.

* Ambience : We didn't have any intention of visiting this place, only wanted a peaceful place and a good drink. Didn't find any and lastly THIS HEAVEN!!!!
Beautiful decor, peaceful ambience on the busy street of Esplanade. Just you enter,you ll see beautiful paintings painted on the wall, chains hanging around the doors, red colored iron doors impressed me very much and the colour of the walls are quite different ; it seems that you enter into a castle. The theme is quite different, but impressive one.

* Food : As a starter we took
1. Drums of heaven (chicken item) bit oily,but chicken pieces were big. (rating 7 on 10)
2. chilly peeper lamb ( 8 pieces of lamb....liked it so much) (rating 9 on 10)
And as main course we ordered
1. Prawn mushroom soup ( smell of ginger was huge, not up to my taste bud; though size of Prawns were very good. (rating 7 on 10) 
2. chilly fish. I liked this item best. Smooth,juicy n pure fish item; very good. (rating 10 on 10)
3. Mixed Fried rice. As usual, nothing impressive in taste. (rating 8 on 10)

* Price : As I mentioned above,it was really fascinating. You have taken some pegs of alcohol and this much less billing!!! Quite impressive. (rating 10 on 10)

* Management : Almost empty inside, very much peaceful and calm and quite cool ambience ; nothing much was there to do by the staffs; (only pouring waters, ice cubes etc) 
* Recommended : 1. You cant even imagine this kind of cool,peaceful restaurant is located in always busy street of Esplanade. Very refreshing.
2. Price is amazingly lower.
3. Most amazing thing is....IF YOU BRING THE PREVIOUS BILL WITH YOU, THEY ARE OFFERING A GOOD AMOUNT OF DISCOUNT ON YOUR 2ND BILL. Its quite good policy for promotion.

I had visited the place few years back.. Located just Beside Scoop.in new market.they have the same ownership.. The food was tasty. Their manager guided us to this place as scoop was full that time due to Puja season. The servicemen are extremely courteous.The ambience us nice and the decor looks elegant.

Went there today, situated beside scoop restaurant. I liked the ambiance specially the curtains and lantern type bulbs and dark theme.
Service was good but they didn't serve water to us, it's a bit of disappointment.

Ordered below:

Hunan Chicken: Salt was little less.. taste was good.

Spicy fried rice with basil: No spice at all, found some chopped green chilies. Flavor of the basil was good though.

Sweet lime soda: Taste was unusual because they used some kind of jelly for sweetness in it. Which I preferred.

Need some improvements in service and quantity section also. Otherwise average experience.

Hidden behind Scoop, this is a gem of a place. Absolutely love the interiors. High, black ceiling, brick walls, ceiling to floor white curtains, black leather seats, and cool lights gives it a modern look. 
The food is brilliant. Their Tom Yum Koong Chicken soup is one of the best I've had. The starters are pretty good as well. 
Music suits the ambience of the place. 
My only complaint is that the service needs to be taken care of in a better way. They should be more responsive.

Situated adjacent to New Empire cinema so very easy to find.
Cool and peaceful place. A really nice place to enjoy your food as well as a relaxing one to enjoy yours gangs gossip.
Clean and sophisticated.¬†
Decor is really good,¬†especially the way they have designed the inner room with curtains and hanging lanterns, its really cool. Creates a dramatic ambience.
Quite a good variety of food as well as soothing drinks. Chicken Satay is the one to look out for.Seats are quite comfy.
Service person are really cooperative and well mannered. Don't go for their Chicken Lad Naa, its simply designed for patients with tummy problems(its so so plain)
Looking forward to visit again.

Its the same place where Oriental plaza used to be , the owner renamed and renovated the space , keeping the cuisine and menu almost same.
The interiors done really good,  the circular entrance, rustic brick walls and hanging laterns , chairs in the outer section and black sofas in the inner section and white curtain separaring them adds a bit of romance with the ambience.
Music was boring.
Many items listed in menu were not available, however , we had THAI STYLE PAN FRIED CHICKEN PIECES in starters , which had 6-8 randomly sized chicken pieces most of which were bony , but tasty.
And then wd had CHICKEN THAI JASMINE RICE and LAMB MASSAMAN . The rice was distinctly flavourful , the curry was delicious but again the lamb pieces were on the tougher side.
Food can be way improved which should have scored not more than 3.5 , however an extra .5 goes for the lovely interior set up.

this place is located in the new empire building just next to scoop, specializes in chinese and thai preparations. i am a regular here and i must say, the food is excellent. the decor is minimalistic and soothing, the incandescent bulbs light up the place and the bare bones nature of the restaurant brings it alive. if u decide to visit this place, the fried lamb in thai herbs is a must try and the jasmine rice too is delicious. the servers are very courteous and friendly. but the consistency of food quality is missing. tried the same dish on 4 different occassions and out of those 4, 2 times, i did not like the quality of the dish served. now dont get me wrong, its just that after getting a 10/10 dish the first time, i didnt expect to be served with a 5/10 dish the second time. but all said, i would highly recommend this place and am personally looking forward to visiting  this place again and again.

They have a descent decor. The interiors are nicely done. The food is good but can be better. Though the Chinese authenticity of taste is quite good. Should seriously improve their service as waiting period at the table was more than 40 mins...hope to see some improvements.

The name of this restaurant is justified by its menu. Most of the items in their menu contain lots of spice and MIRCHI... Ambience wise its good. Taste wise the items we choose was not up to the mark. Prawn was half boiled. And i love their chicken's preparation. No doubt pocket friendly.
