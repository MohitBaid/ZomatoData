Had Paneer dishes, desi Chinese from them. And the food okay. A small outlet. A very old restaurant. According to their past, it was opened by Suruchi Canteen of All Bengal Womens Union. And the building is Government's property. However now it has been take over by an owner and run privately. But the name remained the same.

If anyone wants good quality food in less expense then it is one of the place to visit. Biriyani is good as per the price. But the place is not very hygenic.

Suruchi is a very old food joint near karunamayee auto stand. I have been trying their foods since my childhood when I was in class 3 or 4. Every Saturday and Sunday I used to go near karunamayee for my dance class and every day my Maa used to pack some or the other food from them. and till now I am having food from Suruchi. So the stuffs from Suruch really know me well!! Wh your pocket is low and you want to have some biriyani to suffice your biriyani needs then you can senurely try out their's. They really serve a good quality biriyani with a great quantity. They give one or two big portion of chicken with a aloo and an egg which is really amazing. I tried their all types of pakoras, chicken kabiraji, chowmine, chicken preparations, prawn preaparations and they all are good at per. At this price you can't expect more than that. They really try to keep their name up. The behaviour of the stuffs are very genuine and wheneverc you go to suruchi this place is always full. As this is a roadside food joint which doesn't have a hygienic sitting arrangement so I prefer to order foods from them. Last sunday I ordered mixed fried rice and chili chicken and the fried rice was good but I liked the chili chicken more. The should add less quantity of pepper on their fried rice. The chicken was soft and the quantity was just wow!! One should definitely try out their snacks items and biriyani. Really love this place.

Even though the restaurant is located just beside my office (Vidyut bhavan), I had never ventured to eat here as seemed too unhygienic. But due to the good reviews at zomato I decided to check it out. There were two of us and we decided for takeaway as it was too hot to eat there. Those looking out for ambience please stay away. We ordered for chicken kassa and roti. A bit too salty but nevertheless tasty, we liked the chicken. It was quite oily but was prepared fresh and extremely friendly on our pockets. On a month end, that was quite a relief ðŸ˜‰.Overall those who look forward to street food can try out.

First of all your biriyani is not a biriyani and I cannot describe the biriyani.Actually the biriyani which is available in unitech and dlf food stalls are better than your biriyani.The chicken was like some white boiled meat without spices and you gave me a total half cinnamon in my biriyani.You can watch this photo also.Finally I found a piece of hair or fur or anything in this biriyani so I couldn't eat your biriyani.Thanks.

A road-side food stall situated opposite karunamoyee bus stand with a few outdoor and indoor seating arrangements.
The food offered at the given price range is really commendable.
I often visit this place while returning from college to grab a quick bite.
They have a variety of chinese and indian dishes to choose from.
Great for students to eat who have their colleges and schools in and around karunamoyee as the food is really cheap.

It is one of the oldest food outlets that I have known and is located at the heart of karunamoyee, salt lake...It has been there since the time when there were no fancy restaurants and cafeterias crowding salt lake...

Pros :- 1.Almost all standard indian and chinese dishes are available 2.It is very very economic 3.Compared to the price, both the taste and quantity are appreciable...

Cons :- 1.A roadside outlet (consequently can be considered unhygienic) with very limited seating area and mainly a takeaway outlet..

I used to be a big fan of their chicken roll during my college days...the roll is thick and the stuffing really spicy....yesterday i tried their dry chicken manchurian...it was as good as you would expect in a fancy restaurant with a quantity sufficient for 2 at just rs 100..Hence I'm honestly surprised to see such low ratings on zomato and I understand that people may have usually written it off for being unhygienic...in my view, a place where you can satiate your taste buds completely and still find your pockets intact..

Its been here for ages, but recently they have tried improving on the food, and failed. Prices are higher than the quality offered. Should get a reality check. 
Fyi, chicken tadka does not mean chicken kassa with dal.

Located at the Karunamoyee crossing. It is a small roadside food joint. Tried their Biryani, Mughlai paratha, Chicken roll and many other items. They are very inconsistent with their food quality. This is a pocket friendly place and always remains crowded in the evening. Service is decent and staffs are friendly. Though this place might look unhygienic but the food is decent enough to me, but you can always pack your food.......

This is a small fast food joint for quick bites... I had rolls and biriyani from here quite sometimes..also chowmin as well .. Their chowmin is served with salads in full on desi style ;) . Yes the quality differs, not very consistent with the preparations but they are edible okish as per the standard... Dnt have a proper sitting area in that way tables and chairs available though. If u wanna have here dnt go by the reviews or expectations. Just go and have it..  :)

This restaurant also is just in front of our office gate, but you can call it a road side food stall along with some sitting arrangement.

This place has lack of tidiness and a rode side cooking and serving. So lots of traffic runs by this shop. Naturally dirt, pollution,dust always your companion in this shop. I came here mostly for buying cold drinks and mineral water bottles. There Biriyani and rolls are popular, But biriyani contains a lot of dalda and can lead you to digestion problem.Â  But the customers of restaurant also have to tackle the flies wondering around every where.

But you can surely buy rolls from here and take away. They makes good rolls, but puts coocked potatos inside egg-roll. If you don't like this please tell them prior. Because once it is made, they will force you to take that. But otherwise the stuffs are prompt and helpful and price is in the lower side.

The fast fiod joint place is in between Benfish and the newly opened Mongenis at Karunamoyee. Though the place might look ugly and unhygienic, the food is decent enough for me. The seating is all outside in between heat and dust but it's almost full every time of the day. The delivery is fast and that's what people living nearby prefer more. It's not that great however, good for a roll or a quick biriyani anytime.

You'll be pretty shocked when you try their Biriyani ! It's amaaaazing. It is dalda free, good quantity, 2-3 pieces of chicken/ mutton and a proper size, super tasty aloo. Even their mutton chap is mouth watering. . Must try !

Try the egg veg roll or chicken moglai or plain tarka and rumali roti. Very helpful and quick staff, no place for sitting, but treat this as take away. Not bad for a quick meal, not some thing to remember too. A mediocre, pocket friendly joint just beside Benfish in karunamoyee.
