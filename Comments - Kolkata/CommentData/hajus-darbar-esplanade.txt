Avoid at all costs. Dirty, smelly and definitely worth the money... was sort of forced to be there as couldn't find any better place. But GOSH, the street side eateries are better in terms of cleanliness!

We had Haju's Darbar as the caterer for one of our parties.
First of all they arranged it beautifully and the range of items was immense.
Secondly the food:
1. Kababs were succulent. One of the best.
2. Drumstick, babycorn, paneer were also up to the mark.
3. Dinner items were nice, only concern was that the chicken in chicken masala was shredded instead of pieces.
4. Dahibara was good.
5. Malpua was excellent, they also put a dash of kheer sauce on it before serving it.
6. Drinks like Mojito, Blue Lagoon were also up to the mark.

Overall excellent food quality and taste.

Not All Good Things Comes in Big Packages & Haju`s is surely a Good Example of that.
Very Small Place but with Great Food.
At first you won"t even notice that there"a any Restaurant there.
Price quite affordable. 
You can even arrange micro parties of 10 to 15 people.
Chicken Lollypoo is a must try item.

I totally love this cozy Chinese restaurant. The food is absolutely amazing, there is no tax, and the service is quite efficient! Located just 5 mins away from the Chandni Chowk Metro Gate, this place is a must try out for Chinese lovers!

It's really easily to locate this place, just opposite of tahir mansion on bentik street.
Coming on the food, the taste is really good especially the crispy chicken and it's chicken momo.
The quantity they give is really something that you won't find everywhere where 2 people will eat easily.
Overall, a really good and cheap place to visit and very much pocket friendly also. Would have rated more if they improve their seating and ambience.

I did not go to the restaurant but i have tried their caterer at a party. The food was really good both veg and non veg but I felt they served very late for dinner. They did not even laid out the table when it was 8.30. So there was lack of time management on their part. Need to improve on that front
