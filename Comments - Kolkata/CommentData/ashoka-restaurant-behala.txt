Used to be a feather on Behala's crown because of their famous Mughlai Paratha and Chicken Kasha and the courteous staff. But for about ten years now, they've been on a downward spiral. The items are overpriced, the quantity is stupidly less and they use ghee for almost every dish (including Chinese) which doesn't go very well. The owner is kind of ignorant and doesn't want to improve on quality. If you're hungry after a movie at Asoka Cinema , you might want to try their Mughlai. Sadly I can't see any other reason as to why one should visit the diner. There are better alternatives across the road. Look around!

Food quality and quantity is very satisfying.. acceptable prices but quiet neglected service available and the structure is pretty but more sitting arrangements would be appreciated. Recommend to visit the place

Yesterday I visited there wid my wife and faced my worsed experience. After standing for 40 mins in queue at 10:49 pm they did not attain us. Worst management and worst behaviour of their staff. We forcefully leave their restaurant for their bad behaviour and management.

One star? Where's minus 5 star zomato? Why is this "sarak chaap" restaurant listed on zomato? Who are those nomadic people who even rated 2 star? Who?
Ami bangali..... banglay khisti marte iccha korche kintu thakk...bhadro bhabe nijer onubhuti ingreji te bojhabo apnader..

People who praise about their fish fries it's for them.....since birth have you ever had fish fries from a roadside stall? Cuz they serve ten times tastier fish fries than them.
I ordered one fish fry and one fish butter fry. Both were absolutely tasteless.
The waiter. The stupid waiter. The idiot waiter. The bloody *******..... let it be orelse I'll be blocked from zomato forever. But i should tell the truth. The waiter was rude. He seemed to be angry as if i asked for dowry to marry his daughter. XD. He served water in a glass along with his biometric credentials. I mean his fingerprints. XD
Next came was egg fried rice. Never ever try their fried rice for God's sake guys and girls. Never. Its like having ghee bhat with low quality chawal.
Then came the main course. The ultimate disappointment. The garlic chicken. Hahahahaha. What rubbish. It had garlic pieces but tasted like clear soup. The chicken pieces contained besan more than chicken flesh. Yes i swear on god I'm not making a word. Each and every item was overpriced.
This was all we ordered.
Now the main cons im listing below:
Waiter rude AF and dirty.
On entering the restaurant you'll die of suffocation because all the chicken smoke and smell was all over the eating area which will make you puke.
The egg rice had hair in it. Proof attached . check pic.
We wanted the leftover rice to be parcelled so we asked the waiter to pack it. He charged rs 10 for a normal "mistir baksho" and asked me to pack myself.i even requested him to pack the food but he didn't. Like his parents were too lazy to teach him good manners and etiquette.

Please, it's my humble request to you people please never ever visit this restaurant for any purpose. The crowd here is cheap who chit chats at top of their voices. The place is filled with mosquitoes and will bite you all the time. This place is a piece of shit. If you're so called "changra party" please visit this place because this is definitely for those group of people. I will never visit this restaurant again. Thanks!
I really wish i could slap or chokeslam the waiter. I really wish i could. Goodnight. Take care of your precious money. I care about you all. Eta ekta chotolok der restaurant. Yeh restaurant sarak chap logon keliye hai.

Its a very small restaurant, ok sort of everything, not very clean restaurant but ok clean, price of food was not too high nor too low, taste was ok ok again nor too yummy nor very bad, staffs were well behaved
We ordered:-
‚àÜ Special Moglai Paratha, which was hard and rubber like while chewing
‚àÜ Chicken Reshmi Kabab, it was very dry not at all tasty
‚àÜ Chicken Butter Masala, this was the only dish we enjoyed eating n its was tasty among every thing we ordered
‚àÜ Mutton Biriyani, smells perfect but tastes bland
‚àÜ Hongkong Noodles Mixed, was ok sort of but the prawn had foul smell
‚àÜ Sweet and Sour Chicken, this was a good item, tasted good, this was also a tasty food we had
Over all my experience was 'OK' üòÉüòÉüòÉ

This place is situated just opposite to the Asoka Cinema Hall. The place is small with zero ambiance. I tried their Veg Fried Rice and Garlic chicken. The Garlic chicken was too spicy, actually Garlic chicken should be sweet in taste not like Hot Garlic. The Veg Rice was normal. So from me they deserve 3

This restaurant is located at Behala , opposite of Ashoka Cinema Hall.

Small space , average interior & decor.

Service is good.

Tried Butter fish fry & Mughlai Paratha. Fish fry was average. Mughlai paratha was nicely made and tasty. 

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

following the good reviews of this restu i decided to have fish fry , butter fish fry & mughlai paratha's

starting off with the fish fry it was just average!! nothing special!!! specially looking at the price and the size!
butter fish fry - disappointing! not a single drop of butter or smell! the outer coating was made of just plain besan! though fish was good! again price comes rs 100 for this is just shit!!
lastly mughlai paratha's - average!! the alu torkari was pretty bad! though salad was good lol!

in total i would give Ashoka Restaurant 1.5 stars out of 5!
¬†full money wasted rs 330 for this!! could easily had 2 plates of chicken biryani from haji saheb :(( :'(

It is just opposite ashoka cinema hall. You should definitely try their fish fry and mughlai paratha, they are so good. It has been hangout place for me for quite some tike now. The space inside is very small and there is nothing much to describe about the decor but the food they provide is very good and tasty. I have had their noodles and it was really nice. Did not taste biriyani or other indian dishes but these are definitely in my bucket list.

You can always judge how good a restaurant is by the quality of food they provide even in times of rush and Ashoka sets a benchmark when such circumstances prevail. A light Mughlai Paratha whose recipe, I'm told has been coming of ages paired with the light, crispy fish fry is all you need for you stomach's as well as heart's fill. I didn't really care to try the new items on the menu, I went with something I could not go wrong with and I came out satisfied. Well priced, well placed and well air conditioned. I would definitely recommend it to the folks out there in Kolkata.

The place is located opposite to Ashoka Cinema Hall.  The mixed fried rice was just finger licking good.. We also tried Chili Chicken and Chicken Do Pyaza and it was equally good. It is not a very big restaurant but the food they serve is amazing. Even the Biryani.. Its awesome! The service is good and the place is not pricey at all.

Please please avoid this place if you want privacy and an entire table to yourself. This restaurant is more famous for take-aways and evening snacks like fries and Moghlai. 

You will often be asked to share tables and it's more of an open roadside eating place than a restaurant. It is good enough if you decide to take parcels.

No additional taxes.
Prices are inclusive of taxes.

Beware of this restaurant - they are thugs and unscrupulous. I ordered for 25 Chicken Biryanis for a party yesterday but got 7 of them without any Chicken pieces - on telling them, they sqarely told us that we are lying and denied any misdeed from their end.
I am greatly pained by this, this coming from a place which we have patronised since my early age.

Moreover, the phone nos. printed on their box as also in Zomato are wrong, so that you cannot contact them, when you want.

Ashoka Restaurant in Behala is another restaurant which is running for years now and can be considered as one of the oldest restaurants in Behala. This place is just opposite to Ashoka Cinema Hall. Its quite easy to find as its on the main road of D.H.Road. The place is not very big but not small too. It has a decent sitting capacity. The place is spacious and is clean and tidy. Cant talk about the decor much as its too simple with nothing great about it.

Service:
I found the service to be on the slower side. The staffs are not well trained but they are well behaved. They are working in that place for a long time and knows its regular customers.

Food:
I haven't tried much of their dishes because from childhood I have been said their Mughlai Paratha is speciality. They make really good Mughlai Paratha to be honest with a wide range of variety.
I have tried few Chinese dishes as well which turned out to be ordinary.
The Chicken Cutlet is another dish you can go for at this place.

Last words:
Overall a good place to visit with a reasonable price tag on the food.

3/5 for this place

If u go after 6.30 fish fries will be over. Another yummy thing they are famous for Mughlai Parothas which is a kolkata speciality. A wide variety of menu is available. We tried mix gravy noodles and it turned out to be equally good. A must visit place for foodies. üòä

An old-school restaurant, recently turned air-conditioned. They have oflate extended their menu to the Punjabi dishes, Chinese and Indian, but sorry to say none of them impress. Small place, seats about 20 odd people. Service time average. Helpful and attentive waiters. Good for trying snacks like moglai, pakora, fish fries, etc.

However I would remember this place forever for it's Mutton Braised Cutlet. Stupendous! Fish Kabiraji is a must try.

I am only going to review on the evening snacks as I visit this place for that purpose only. Let's start with their speciality the mutton brace cutlet, something one should try once they visit this place. The fish fry, chicken cutlet and mughlai are the other items worth trying. Poor hospitality as there is only one attendant but that doesn't  matter till the food is tasty.

A restaurant with lots of nostalgia attached.One of the places where our entire gang used to hangout after tutions in those bygone days gorging on mutton braised cutlet and Moghlai parota. But very sad to see the current state of affairs. The quality of food has deteriorated.Although they have made the place air conditioned I won't be going there anytime now otherwise I will not be able to preserve those good memories of a lost era

Ashoka Restaurant on the opposite foot  of Ashoka Cinema Hall  was once Behala‚Äôs Mecca of Moghlai Porota and Chicken and Mutton cutlets, but after they renovated and installed A.Cs the food just doesn‚Äôt taste the same any more 

Moghlai Porota :  Rs 50.

Very heavy and greasy, but tastes okay. Definitely not what is used to be years back.

Chicken Cutlet : Rs 60.

Boneless chicken marinated in ginger, garlic and green chillies, in a perfectly crispy coating of bread crumbs, served with ketchup, kashundi and a never enough salad on the side. I love the chicken Cutlet here.

Mutton Brace cutlet : Rs 65.

What should be spelled as Mutton BRAISED cutlet is spelled as Brace cutlet on the menu but that doesn‚Äôt deter the cutlet from being yummy, which is also served with ketchup, kashundi, and salad.

The place doesn‚Äôt smell very pleasant because of the constant non vegetarian food going in and out of the kitchen into the dining space. It seats about 20 people I guess, and the other food on the menu like noodles, rice, egg curry, chilli chicken is of average taste. Go there only if you want to eat a good chicken or mutton cutlet or else skip it.

Food : 2/5

Service: 2/5

Ambience: 1/5

Value for Money: 3.5

'Pretty awful' are the two words which first comes to my mind when I think of this age-old restuarant! Though its far from being a restaurant but still lots of memories linger in this shop!! Their once famous Moghlai Paratha & Mutton Kasha has turned into a disgusting bowl of god-knows-what dish...however moghlai paratha is almost the same with less stuffing! 
           Only uplifting the front look doesn't change how pathetic you are! Grow up & become the food joint we once boasted off!!!

Earlier this used to be a bland looking roadside eatery until the made a facelift a couple of years ago. But the quality of food hasn't bettered with the bettered looks of the place. More or less this is an average sort of restaurant serving food of very average quality and taste. The prices are on the cheaper side you may say but I try and avoid this restro coz its better to get food from other better restaurants located nearby.
Overall its AVOIDABLE...

I dont know y the hell i went there.... they are the worst... hits the rockbottom of disappointment.... i was disgusted.... i dont even know wether the one man army was either a waiter or even the restaurant manager ... he is such a dumb.... we ordered for friedrice along with sweet n sour chicken.... after nearly 15 minutes he arrived with two plates of NOODLES ... and arguing that we have ordered noodle ... how can someone order something that he can never eat....then another so called roughian... or u may say a wellwisher asked him to replace one of the plates with rice ..... but we dint accept his kindness 
... the worst of all ... egg shells are getting finely crisped in mouth present in the noodle

PLEASE AVOID.....the most nightmarish experience that i ever had with any restaurant in my life. We had arranged a small birthday party for my nephew's friends at our place and decided to take home 5 plates of veg fried rice. We collected the same from the restaurant at around 5:30pm and on reaching home immediately had taken out the rice form the packed containers and kept in in different vessels. Imagine our horror, when we found out that when we were serving the same at 8:30 - 9:00, it had become stale and started emitting a foul smell.We immediately arranged for alternatives and somehow managed the situation. To add to this, when we went back to the restaurant and complained to the so called manager - a guy wearing specs and having a ponytail, he simply disowned his responsibility and refused to take any blame whatsoever. he clearly denied taking any responsibility for the items and started shouting saying¬† it is 5 hours since we have taken the food, he cannot do anything about it. He simply refused to admit it is the fault of the restaurant.When I pointed out it is not 5 hours but only 2.5 - 3 hours later only when we found the rice had gone stale, he again started shouting that he cannot do anything about it. 

This is indeed the most harrowing experience that we have ever faced---no proper service, lack of respect for customers, no attempts to help the customer and totally irresponsible. PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE.....

This restaurant is an extended kitchen of people around Ashoka movie hall.They cater the needs of the 'paras' in the vicinity (Jadu Colony, Arcadia etc.). Mughlai paratha over here is worth mentioning. This falls in the league of restaurants which are suitable for takeaways or casual evening snacks with 'para' friends. These are not meant for family dine ins. They do not spend on interiors, ambience, well behaved waiters. This place, along with a few similar only bet on cheap offerings in large quantity. They maintain an average quality, and an affordable rate.
People like me who were born and brought up around this area, have seen the evolution of this place. They used to make the best vegetable chops and fish chops in Kolkata and were strictly limited to chops and cutlets. Now they have separate chinese and Indian menus.

Fish  fry , Indian  Fried  rice , Punjabi  Aloo  Dam  , Mutton  Kasha , Chicken  Kasha  and  Curry , Mughlai  Paratha ...these  are  some  of  the  items   I  have  tasted   from  this  restaurant  ,  which  is  located  near  my  house... It  is     well  known  in  the  locality  for  the  mughlai  paranthas  and  the  mutton...  the    meat  was  to  die  for  a  few   years  back...just  a  couple  of hours from  noon  and     the  food used to  be finished...  However   over  time  ,  and  opening  of  other  restaurants  in  the  vicinity the  craze  oves  Ashoka   Restaurant   has  faded ...the    quality  has deteriorated    and   the  prices   have  gone  up,  though  nothing   drastically !  Overall  a  nice  little  restaurant  serving   decent  Indian  food  ,   haven't  tried  their  Chinese  much...but  their Indian  items are   good!

Have been having food from Ashoka restaurant since childhood..the quality of food has been constant..the look has only changed for the better. The cutlets are definitely worth a try ..and am sure you would have it again. The Mughlai parathas are just great. Be sure to reach early before the stock is over
