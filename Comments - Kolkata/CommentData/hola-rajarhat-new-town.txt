This place has good food with simple n fancy ambiance..
Food was delicious and good people around but need to be careful while cooking food, located near rajarhat and very easy to find and chill out with friends.  Worth visiting

I am totally dis satisfied.

This restaurant is located inside Rosedale complex, next to Reliance Mart. Last sunday me & friends decided to visit this place for breakfast..we reached at 8:15am and the place was empty...1st we ordered masala tea & tea was on our table in 5mins & it was really tasty...then we ordered upma & poha & it took them more than 45 mins to prepare...I don't know why...and to top it up....both the items were pretty below average in terms of taste...I would definitely not recommend any1 to try their upma or poha....price is definitely on the higher side...they charge 50rs. for masala tea & 120rs. each for upma & poha......so, I feel this is not a ideal place for breakfast, However I will not be able to comment on their main course as I have not tried any item yet...

Will never order from this place again!!!

They were worth the price when they opened. Now its a ac dhaba which is pricey. Beware of food quality. I got sick last 2 times when I had food from this place. 
They give onions, lime & chilli with every order. They forget that sometimes too. Their present prices are so not worth the dhaba style food quality.

We did not know that such a hidden gem was there at rosedale plaza in Newton. It's veg and serves good food. We tried aloo ka paratha which tasted pretty good,the idlis were soft and moist. The masala tea and the filter coffee they served in large cup was enough fa decent price of 30. Overall this is a good place and I am looking forward to visit it again.

Very poor Service. Nobody to supervise service boys. Food Quality deteriorated. Rates at part with reputed restaurant.No wash room or wash Basin.Did not returned the Hakka Noodles in spite of testing and accepting poor quality by them . Charging GST @18% in spite of Govt reducing it from 18 to 12%. Poor  service once you are served the order. We need to remind them for water or clearing the plates.  Overall very poor experience.

Location is a bit far away but with the ongoing development , that wont be an issue. A nice small Veg restaurant. Ambience is good out there. Staffs are also very cooperative. The important thing is that food is really good. Paneer Tikka is good. So is veg manchurian. Although they could add more varities in their menu. One can definitely try here. Its reasonable as well.

A nice decent eatery in Rosedale Complex(near Unitech) which makes it very convenient for people staying around Newtown and Shapoorji. The view of CCD and the beautiful complex adds a point to the place. 

We ordered Pizza Dosa and its an excellent fusion of Italian and south Indian food (a must try) and Bar BQ Paneer along with chaas(chaas again can be given a try) 

Overall nice place to go out with friends and family for a quick meal.

The food quality is not upto the mark. Very bad service. They do not believe in customer centricity. The waiting time for serving food is around 40 minutes. They just opened the shop but completely focusing on making more profit rather than taking care of customer comfort as well as satisfaction. They do not have the sincere desire of correct themselves. I suggest my neighbours of Rosedale, Uniworldcity, Sukha Bristi, Elita Garden Vista not to explore this outlet for dinning. It’s sheer wastage of time, money and energy.

Had a pretty decent dosa and onion uttapam here recently. The chutneys aren't that great but the sambar was surprisingly good. The uttapam reminded me of some great uttapams I've had at other places. Overall, not a bad option at all given the limited non club kachori breakfast choices. Just frightfully expensive though.

I have tested veg dishes very less time. Today I tested again in hola.
Food is good enough to have. Test nice. Suggested dish "Tawa biriyani".
Quantity is not enough for all dishes.

Service us bad. Food serve after more than 20 min from order.  Waited too long.

No washroom in the restaurant.
 All over not a bad experience. If you are in near sapoorji then you should test the food from HOLA!

For those who live in or near Shapoorji, this is a decent option to enjoy south indian food make with hygiene (hopefully)

A small joint in Rosedale plaza which has opened some time back only. The Dosa preprations are good but the seating is not comfortable. The size of the dosa does not fit the table. Garlic bread is good. Masala chai is decent.

Price to quantity ratio is good. Overall a good option for Action Area III residents. Not worth for someone to travel all the way to eat here.

This small joint is located in the Rosadale garden complex.
The ambience is okay, cause when its crowded, it becomes really loud because of its small area. Tables are too small. One table is barely enough for 2 people to dine.
The food is superb, but a bit spicy. We had peas pulao which smelled and tasted a million bucks. Dal fry was really good and its texture was superb. Mix veg was yum and super spicy. Chappaties were cooked properly and of pure flour.
A nice place to dine. It has a good variety in the menu, Ill surely try more and update the review.

A new food establishment located opposite UEM College. We ordered for two Masala Chai and a Butter Cheese Masala Dosa. The sambar and chutneys served were really good and it had a lot of cheese too. The quantity of chai served for 25 INR was huge but it tasted like normal chai with no masala flavour to it whatsover.
The service needs to improve as while ordering the waiters were clueless wether their kitchen was ready to serve us food or not.

An absolute treat for a vegan. Just flip through the menu and you'll know that there are people who can work wonders with vegetarian recipes and with equal precision. 

One of the best bets be it lunch, dinner or evening snacks. The quality of their food is just top notch and the taste second to none. Be it North Indian, South Indian or Chinese everything is just perfect. Love their range of Dosa’s, Chole Bhature, Chinese Bhel, Paw Bhaji from the snack section ! Even for lunch and dinner they have extensive every imaginable vegetarian choices. 
Prompt service and a cheerful ambiance. Will always be at the top of my list of eateries. :) Do give this place a visit - with family, friends or colleagues.  

I would really like to see them opening another outlet especially in the Ballygunge area!

It stands out from other eating joints in that area because of its multi cuisine food. The cosy atmosphere and the floor to ceiling glass walls makes it the perfect place to eat and bond. The area outside the restaurant is also very open and positive. South Indian food and Chana Bhathura are must try.

Right now, there is absolute no reason to go to this place. 50% of the items mentioned in the menu are not available, takes a long time to get food/drinks, card payment not accepted ( though paytm is there); on top of that, overpriced like crazy.

Not going back anytime soon. Sincerely hope it improves.
