Very tasty food, made with lot of love. Kuddos to the chef who has made this possible. Quality and Quantity of food is upto the mark. Especially the continental dishes makes you feel as if you are having it in a five star chain of resturant. Packing is also very nicely and neately done.

Chinese dishes are also very heart felt and treat for your tummy.
