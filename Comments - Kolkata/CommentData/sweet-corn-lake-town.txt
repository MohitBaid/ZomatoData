I am having their food since 2013 and they are my favorite restaurant. Whenever I feel like to have some spicy food, I always order from there. I have tasted almost all the dishes from menu but my favorites are chicken kosha, chicken biryani, chicken lollipop, fish pakoda, peas pulao, mashroom jhalfrezi, keema kulcha and many more. This restaurant is good option to fulfill the appetite of spicy food lovers like me.

A small shabby looking small roadside restaurant in laketown. Looks pretty unhygienic and shabby from outside, as well as inside, the food nothing great to talk about.

Ordered online via Swiggy tonight for dinner after one restaurant decided to ditch me. Thankfully this one didn't ditch me and came to my rescue at 11 pm at night. I had ordered for Tandoori Roti, Chilli Paneer and Dal Fry. The dal fry was superb! One of the best I have had. I wish I ordered for one more dal fry. It was amazing.

Havent visited the place, but order food from zomato delivery. The food taste and qwality is very good. They do take a lot of time to deliver. But finally when it arrives its hot and fresh. Awesome taste. Recommendations would be mushroom butter masala, handi chicken...

Ordered through FoodPanda, their delivery was on time and the food quality is below par, I can say that for their Biriyani only because that's what I had. Though their mixed raita is awesome.
- Got the food delivered to me, three packs of Chicken Biriyani and a mixed raita, delivery was nearly on time
- Taste of the food is not as good, according to me if I can compare it to Arsalan Biriyani for Rs 175 then this one should be not more than Rs 80. I personally consider Arsalan to be overpriced
- The only good thing was their mixed raita, would like have it again 
- Final verdict, try them once for their raita atleast

If I could've given lesser rating, believe me I would've. Among the worst kind of things you can put in your mouth, comes the food provided by this restaurant. My stomach, heart, kidney, brain said to me, "Dude, hume rakhna nai chahta, organs donate karde, torture kyu karwata?" 
They have written the delivery is around 50 minutes, I DOUBLE DARE YOU, they won't be seen before 150 minutes. And someone please invite a Health Inspector over there, and make him/her close down this restaurant.

Ordered Chinese from here for home delivery.  The fried rice and chilly fish tasted good. However chicken drumsticks were too hot and spicy. Delivery took more than an hour.

A small restaurant which many people don't know off. However the food was average. We had ordered home delivery. The delivery was a bit long. Took almost 1 hour

Another home delivery option for me...the food is average...both veg and non veg...the prices are affordable...i always find the place empty maybe a small group grabbing a bite or people like me waiting for their orders to be prepared.

Ordered online. The final bill showed 290. When the person came he asked for 320. Don't know what the thing was like. The prices needs to be updated on Zomato or what the restaurant people are doing. The food was good and good in quantity also. Delivery should have been a bit faster.

I went there on a weekday at around 8pm. Wanted to parcel some items home. I was surprised to see that the entire restaurant was empty (not a single customer). Their menu card looked quite extensive. I order for two plates of chicken lollypop and a plate of veg pakoda. They said it is going to take around 30 minutes and they can deliver it to my home if I did not want to wait. I agreed (I was returning from office, dead tired and waiting 30 minutes was a bit too much). 

They did send it over (home delivery) which came around 45 minutes later (as against promised 30 minutes). All the items were extremely spicy and we could hardly have them. True I did not tell them to make it less spicy but then they never asked! This restaurant is definitely not on my revisit list.

Although the name is Sweet the food is far below average.

It is Located in the lane beside Hanuman mandir , opposite to the north point day school .
One might be tempted to try out the dishes here after a visit to the mandir.

But i seriously recommend that you do not.
 They donot have much room with the kitchen just in front of your eyes for you to see how messy their work is.

Further despite  serving  fast they fail to provide you quality food .
I has ordered simple mixed fried rice parcel  and nothing else .
They quickly carelessly served me a rather bland plate of undercooked rice.

I never dared to eat there again.
This  happened a long time ago so i am eager to get some latest feedback from you guys if u have been there recently.
If not then simply Do Not.
:D
