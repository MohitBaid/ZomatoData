All my recent orders were excellent so I'll recommend my friends and family to try from here . I'll say their non veg items are seriously good and mouth watering ...

Mark my words—plz plz plz do not order food from E Kitchen , if u want to spoil ur mood , waste money,waste food then u can well order n eat from here.but my suggestion is DONT even THINK of this restaurant.
Today I had ordered Kashmiri aloo dum I had specifically called them up n had mentioned them to send me white gravy KASHMIRI ALOO DUM but still I found out that they had sent us the wrong order that was punjabi aloo dum. 
Then I had ordered Kashmiri pulao ,it was so pathetic ,tasteless and dry,that it literally chocked my neck n I had to vomit immediately.
Kaali daal was dry and tasteless, total waste of money n food. 
Had to throw the entire dinner into the dustbin n sleep with an empty stomach.
Didn’t expect such a mistake of sending the wrong order firstly from their side n such HORRIBLE,DRY,TASTELESS food.
So a big big suggestion my fends don’t even think of having food of this place.Total waste of money.
You can see the picture downloaded below ,the dustbin is full of food which has gone for a waste now.
