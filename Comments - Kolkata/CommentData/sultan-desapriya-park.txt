Hopped into Sultan few minutes back with my parents. Let me tell you calcuttanz, it's a overated over hyped restaurant. Ordered both chicken n mutton biryani which were served cold and not at all sultani/ nawaabi style. Road side biriyanis r much better than these. Let's come to the fish gandharaj tikka which had no essence of gandharaj n fish was not at all fresh. Prawn malai n roti served at least better than the above two. Lastly never tasted such bad sahi paneer in my life. I wasted my money and hunger, would advice others not to waste theirs... Extremely disappointed with Sultan.

Went here on 25th of Dec. Really liked the ambience of the place. I expected this place to be crowded on that day, but we 4 were the only guests. Talking about the food, tastes heavenly specially the Biriyanis. The service personnel suggested the side dishes as well which were really perfect. We wanted to order Phirni as desserts as well, but it wasn't available. But overall  a good experience. Hope to visit more at this place and would suggest all of you to have some good Biriyanis. 
Thank you. 🤠

Howdy mate I am not a big fan of going to restaurant as I also have a dog which will not be allowed by the restaurants I want to go so today I ordered a few dishes from another restaurants and thought of having chicken biryani as side dish from sultan...delivery was super fast, the food was warm enough thanks to the Zomato delivery person he was very fast and intelligent too. Now about the quantity of biriyani it was humongous one person probably cannot eat the whole biriyani at least the chicken piece was of 300 grams it was properly packed and had egg and one potato but was without spoon, moving over to the taste it was bit mild and not at all spicy and the chicken was cooked properly... love every bit of it... if you want spicy chicken biryani that dada boudi of barracpore is you spot, but today I love my mild chicken biryani of sultan as it was yum.... see you friends shortly to tell you some other story of some other restaurant.

A joint situated near Jugals at Rashbehari serves awesome Mughlai cuisine without giving you a pocket crunch.
Among the dishes we savoured is :
🍴 Non Veg sizzler platter which consists of Murg Tulsi, Gandharaj Machli Tikka & Seekh Kebab. The Murg tulsi has an obvious mild tulsi fragrance to it which itself makes it unique. The Gandharaj Machli tikka melts in your mouth and being an ardent 'fishtetarian' this was no doubt my favourite of the lot. Seekh kebab was well made.

🍴 Vegetarian Sizzler Platter consisted of Tandoori Gobi, Bharwan Aloo with Poppy Seeds, Paneer Kasturi Kebab. Never did I think I will enjoy veg sizzler so much.. It was like venturing into a total awesome undiscovered sector. The Bharwan Aloo was perfectly spiced & the poppy seeds gave it a crunchy finish. The Gobi bharwan and Paneer kasturi was equally good.

🍴Chelo Kebab Platter - It consisted of a bowl of fragrant rice and array of delicious chelos topped with golden fried egg. I can simply define it as best Chelo in the city, the chef knows his thing 👍

Also we shared a Mutton Biryani and undoubtedly it makes one of the best biryani in the city, a perfect balance of spices and least oil used. A mouthful of awesomeness in short.
I am not much of a fan of Mughlai dishes but I would surely love to visit Sultan time and again to this place gives you a mughlai foodgasm ❤️

A very awful place for dining. There's hardly any people in the restaurant, also it smells badly and then comes the food with a below average taste. This time I am very surprised with the fact that Zomato has featured this place in their 'brilliant biryanis' collection and it turns out to be that their biryanis are tasteless. It is actually a very poor effort on the part of Zomato and for this people like us have to suffer by going to these places. Not recommended at all.

Sultan is located near Deshapriyo Park which is famous for its Indian and Mugal dishes.
It is a place to be there with your family and friends enjoying the authentic taste of Indian dishes.
Other than their normal Indian dishes they are also offering three new platters during this Christmas making it merrier than before.
The three new platters are Veg Sizzler Kabab ,Non Veg Sizzler Kabab  and Chelo Kabab Platter.

Veg Sizzler Kabab platter contains Tabdoori Gobi,Bharwan aloo with poppy seeds and Paneer kadturi kabab.These dishes are so tasty that would even instigate even a non vegetarian person to indulge in its taste.

Non Veg Sizzler Kabab platter contains Murg turki,Gandharaj Fish Tikka and Chicken Sheekh Kabab which is soft and delicious making you carve for more and a must taste too.

Chelo Kabab platter contains steeming Jeera rice,topped with omlette  ,butter and the chicken kababs.

Other than these do try their Mutton Biriyani which is delicious and contains mutton ,egg and also potato.
The authentic taste of Mughal dishes is a must try for all at a pocket friendly price.
Dig into this place near Deshapriyo Park and enjoy Mughal dishes to the best.

Sultan in Deshapriya Park is nice little place to have Awadhi and North indian Dishes. They have a superb reputation for Biriyani and now they have introduced a few splendid sizzling Platters.
Though the place is quite small and holds a capacity of around 10 people , it should not be a concern , as here you get to have awsome delicious food & of course it’s pocket friendly.

The food we had were:
•    The Veg Sizzler Platter : Tandoori gobhi, Bharwan aloo with poppy seeds and Paneer Kasturi Kebab. A culmination of flavours that will make even the most ardent non veg foodies appreciate its magnificence .

•    The Non Veg Sizzler Platter: Murg Tulsi, Gandharaj Machli Tikka, and Seekh kebab. A platter full of juicy chicken , marinated beautifully & tender fish . Smoky flavour with spicy zing , each bite is an emotion itself.

•    The Chelo Kabab Platter : With hot steamy jeera rice and a golden omlette on top with the above mentioned chicken kababs. A platter so tasty and grand that you just cant have enough.

•    Mutton Biriyani: To bring an end to this wonderful eve , we dived in to the all time fav , the mutton Ghost biriyani.  Dum biriyani at its finest . Specially loved the rice .

Overall it was a good experience here . The food quality  is unquestionable  , and the quantity is more than ample . Hope this place expands the seatings so that more and more people can enjoy their meal here .

Royal Salvers!

Regal feasts are always an utopia for all. Not only they metes out some implausible cuisines, however, also the ministrations of theirs' are extolling. And, we have a same sensation of their aid in SULTAN. A tiny eatery palace that can cater for ten people at a go. Nevertheless, a marvelous place to get the taste and the wisdom of Awadhi and North Indian dishes.

It was their new table d'hôte launch day, consisted of Non-veg sizzler platter contained of Murgh Tulsi, Gandharaj Machli Tikka, and Seekh kebab. And this platter sizzled me up to hang in Seekh with its Gandh in the base of Tulsi. Cherished every smoke and bite of this cuisine. Chelo kebab platter, contained of all above mentioned meat pieces with jeera rice and an omelette. Delectable! Besides, there was Veg platter which contained Tandoori ghobhi, Bharwan aloo with poppy seeds and Paneer Kasturi Kebab. Now this plate tandoored me up with the caress of morphine in a soft deer-musk. Adored every 'munch' of it. Furthermore, we decreed for Gosht biryani, prepared of cooked mutton pieces in Dum Pukht style and layered with rice and laced with spices. Squashy, it was!

Esteemed every moment over here. Go for it guys you will admire it too.

Thanks for reading.

Sultan is for people like me who are in constant need of food delivered late nights.This joint at Deshapriya park is the answer to all those late night hunger pangs when the city falls asleep.The restaurant which has an otherwise minimal decor speaks volumes with its mouth watering array of North indian dishes.

On my plate for a sumptuous dinner was

🍁Gulabi Paneer tikka--Marinate in beet root juice and yoghurt overnight the paneer is grilled to perfection.Soft and succulent served with a beetroot raita makes for a interesting choice
🍁Tangri Mumtaz--This one is a definite recommendation for people who are meat lovers.The chicken leg is stuffed with mutton keema and grilled.The char grilled flavour gives you a lingering after taste.
🍁Murgh biriyani--A good bowl of biriyani that makes for a wholesome meal.The fluffy long grain rice with a chicken and a big piece of aloo.Dig in and enjoy
🍁Nalli nihari--Cooked overnight with their signature spices ,the nalli nihari has a flavourful broth
🍁Lachha paratha--the paratha was a little too oily as per my taste but soft .Dipped in the nalli nihari this for a bite from heaven

Sultan offers a delicious meal that is absolutely lipsmacking

As royal as it sounds, 'Sultan' serves food that lives upto the name. Yet again a hidden gem in the Southern Avenue area, this one will meet all your sudden cravings for Mughlai food - be it for a grand lunch or some midnight hunger pangs. A wide array of food they provide with a low pocket pinch is something one cannot give amiss. I was absolutely surprised with their quality and quantity on my recent visit there, where I tried few of their signature items :

∆ Gulabi Paneer Tikka (5/5) >> While I was not at all thrilled by the idea of a vegetarian Tikka, this particular dish took me by surprise as the grilled cottage cheese was so perfect in both texture and taste with a balanced marination of beetroot and hung curd, that it melted in my mouth right away. Served with a sour beetroot chutney and a side of salads, this was a great starter.

∆Tangri Mumtaz (4/5) >> Innovative with the mutton keema stuffing inside a roasted chicken leg, this was amazing to taste. Succulent pieces of chicken with spicy minced meat is all you want to devour on a cold evening.

∆Murgh Biryani (5/5) >> I don't think Sultan's Biryani needs any introduction as they're already famous for it. Flavourful rice with a tender piece of chicken and boiled egg, it will surely tantalize your taste buds with a soothing and calm effect. The deep fried onion garnish adds that extra punch to the whole dish.

∆Laccha Paratha (5/5) >> I'm not a big fan of Indian breads, yet this one managed to impress me quite a lot. Soft parathas with no greasiness, fried to the right extent. Must try with Indian gravies or curries.

∆Nalli Nihari (5/5) >> Definitely the winner of the evening, this slow cooked mutton stew amazed us. Bunch of flavorful spices with a handful of well cooked mutton is sure to make you fall in love with it.

And with that we ended our feast, which literally left us feeling satisfied to the T. Do visit this abode of great 'Mughlai khaana' if you still haven't, I'm going back for sure!

Located inside a bye-lane beside Jugal's in Triangular Park, Sultan is a hidden gem for all Biriyani and Kebab lovers. I still cannot forget that particular taste of this Kebab we tried yesterday, named Tangri Mumtaz, which was simply outstanding. The Chicken leg pieces were grilled to perfection with a very decent amount of Mutton Keema stuffed inside. The chicken absorbed all the spices and aromas making the entire  experience fantastic and delightful. Gulabi Paneer Tikka, is another Kebab which I highly recommend for all vegetarians just for all the flavors it entails. The pink colour and the flavor derived from  marinating it in the beetroot marinade made the dish taste so well. Now coming to the main course, The Murg Biriyani with Nalli Nihari and Lacchha Parathas. I am not extremely fond of Biriyani apart from the ones we get at Arsalan or India restaurant , but here, the Murg Biriyani made me rethink. Quantity wise it was very good, and taste wise even better. Served with a Raita, the flavours in it were really nice and it really lived up to my expectations. Nalli Nihari, as we all know is a deliciously smooth flour based stew with slow cooked mutton and a myriad of spices. It takes at least 3 to 4 hours to cook and the end result is almost always extremely worth it. At Sultan too, we were not at all disappointed as the Nalli Nihari they served was divine in taste. It was hot and medium spicy and it hit the spot right away. The Lachha Paratha was the perfect accompaniment being very crisp and light. Overall the experience at Sultan was mind blowing and I am definitely going back to try my favorites soon.

Located just in the lane beside Jugal's sweet shop, the stoppage just after desapriya park., this place is a hidden gem!! Sultan serves the most authentic and delicious kebabs of all times. This a small little hub, mainly for takeaway, and they can accomodate 10 people at a time. The best thing about this place is they are open till late night so u can drop anytym here and take away your parcel!!
Now coming to the food. The food is too good here, and price wise it was pocket friendly!!
They never compromises with their food quality.
The food i tried were
Tangri mumtaz - This was the absolute new dish to try, leg pieces of chicken were served with mutton keema stuffed in them!! A authentic dish, with a new concept!! A must try for tandoors and muglai lovers!!!
Paneer gulabi tikka - The best thing about this dish was its pink flavour, and the way it was garnished!! Taste wise it was good! For vegeterians this is a must try!!!
Lachha paratha and Nalli Nihari-Mutton nalli nihari was served with laccha paratha!! Nalli nihari was great in taste! And the flavours were in right proportions!!
Murgh Biryani served with Raita - Biriyani is always my favourite!! And the biriyani tasted good!!
Overall the quality and quantity of food was too good!!
Ofcourse will visit this place again and again!!
A must visit for muglai lovers!!

Another great budget delivery that is available in this locality.  Kolkata. Had ordered Chicken Biryani - Very well cooked and a good quantity which can surely fill one stomach if not two.
Chicken Champ - A perfect side dish for the Briyani.  However it was a little sweet so make sure you tell them to avoid it of that's not your taste.
Tandoori Chooza  - An amazing appetizer, very delicious specially when eating it with the side chutney that was provided. For a price of around 300 bucks it was really worth it.

Taste 4.5/5
Delivery 5/5
Value for money 4/5

I think local friendly customers have been kind to push this place high on ratings, although they don't deserve that at all.

Bengal ki jaan, Bengal ki aan – SULTAN!

Yes, you read that right! Tucked away inside a bye-lane near Jugal’s at Desapriya Park, Sultan brings to you exceptional North Indian, Awadhi as well as Mughlai cuisines! Size of the place is not big, and can accommodate a dozen-odd heads only, primary reason for this small size being that they are more of a takeaway / delivery outlet and not the regular fine dining ones! So, don’t expect too much of an ambience, but do expect great food!

We gorged upon the below menu:-

(i)	Masala Cola – Who opines that great starters comprise only soups and shorba! Those who do, I personally advise them to visit Sultan and have this mocktail!

(ii)	Achari Paneer tikka – A regular starter, but taste way better than the regular ones, a great kick-start to a dozing meal!

(iii)	Sabz Miloni – I did regret the high quantum of oil in it, but my anguish was satiated by the high taste, the dry spicy gravy – the babycorn content deserves a special mention!

(iv)	Garlic Naan – Served piping hot and fresh, it assumed a nice complimentary role with the Subz Miloni! Mind the huge size, I could barely finish a single piece of it!

(v)	Veg Biryani – Above expectations, with generous boiled potatoes and giant cottage cheese cube content, can be had with any gravy or even plain!

(vi)	Burhani – A ton of thanks and indebtness to the chef for serving the perfect appetizer to end the above heavy meal on a light note – my 1st experience with Burhani – and a moment to cherish! Just the perfect blend of spices with yoghurt and topped with tulsi leaves, this one drink can digest the most behemoth of hungers!

Service is fabulous, and prices pretty reasonable!

So, I suggest a walk-in anyday to this place to relish authentic Mughlai and Awadhi cuisines! For those who don’t have enough time for a personal visit, order home delivery –

Fridays and Saturdays – 1 pm to 3 am (midnight)

Other days – 1 pm to 02:30 am (midnight)

Keep munching
!

If you want to dine like a Sultan,come to "Sultan". "Sultan" is a hidden gem and is located conveniently near Deshapriya Park.  This Diwali,this is the place to be.

Thank you Sudipto Karmakar for the invitation and thanks to Mr.Tanmay Basak for leading us.

The ambience though not a grand one,the food here will make sure to give you a grand feeling.On the food menu,we had :-
 1) Masala Cola(4/5)- Chilled Coco Cola with Jal Jeera and a hint of lime. Refreshing drink for the parched soul and is an absolute necessary with Mughlai food items.

 2) Chicken Firangi Kebab(4.5/5)- The Chicken Firangi Kebab was a fantasic dish. It consisted of perfectly cooked reshmi kebab with malai on top. It was served with salad and green yoghurt chutney. This dish was an absolute delicacy and I highly recommend it.

 3)Garlic Nan(5/5)- Absolutely delicious,piping hot Garlic nan was one of the stars of the show. Tha nan had chopped garlic in it which is a rarity.

 4) Badami Murgh(5/5)- Hands down my favorite North Indian gravy item from now on. The mixture of spices with chopped peanuts made the dish a grand one. The aroma of this dish can make a person go mad. The chicken pieces were soft,succulent and delicious.
 
 5)Mutton Biryani(5/5)- This is the best biryani that I have ever had. The rice was perfectly flavored and was cooked with ample amount of spices which made it a heavenly dish. The mutton was softer than cotton and was sinful. Highly recommended.

 6)Burhani(4/5)- Gujarat's Chas and Punjab's lassi mixed with Middle Eastern Heritage has produced Burhani. A spicy drink to ease the digestion process after the whole meal was a good idea from the management. I loved it.

 Other food items included Achari Paneer Tikka,Sabz Miloni and polau which were delectable. I will definitely visit again.

Finding Sultan is so satisfying for me.Thanks to my food journey guide,Tanmoy Da.This time,It was a Pre Diwali Bloggers meet.
Heard about their unique time of service from 3pm to 3am.Yup,they do serve and deliver till 3am at midnight.And the delivery experience is mind blowing.An Air Conditioned restaurant is just adjacent to this Hidden Gem.
Our dinner comprised of the following dishes...
1.Masala Cola.
2.Firangi Kebab.
3.Achari Paneer Tikka.
4.SabZ Miloni.
5.Garlic Naan.
6.Badami Chicken.
7.Mutton Biryani.
8.Burhani.
Lets share my honest experience.
Masala Cola just complemented with all the dishes,a must order for such highly rich food to get down.
Paneer Tikka was slice,yet diced paneer roasted with tandoori spices in charcoal oven with diced onion and capsicum.Firangi Kebab was way different.Its unique.The cheesy malai on the top of the kebab was superb.The tender chicken with all white tandoori masalas made the kebab mindblowing.
The Garlic Naan was superb.Hot and fresh,best complemented with the Badami Murgh.
Now the Show Stopper,the Badami Murgh.
6 peices of boneless chicken kebabs,dum cooked with Secret Sultani Spices,in an yellow gravy with sprinkled Cashewnuts.The gravy was consistant throughout,and it just touched my soul.
My dinner was sorted,but there came another screamer.Mutton Biryani.I peeped into their kitchen to see the way the prepare their food.There i saw an unique way,Biryani getting cooked in a thick aluminium Wok.After i tasted the biryani,i was liked out of the world.No comments,just visit them and order a plate of biryani and get your meal sorted.
At last,The Burhani.A spicy shake of curd with a minty flavour.
To all the crazy owls over there,indulge your tastebuds with the magic of Sultan.
Highly Reccomended.

It's very easy to locate this place but it's my request to everyone please don't judge it by it's appearance.Man this place is just a mere understatement to the term 'Hidden Gem' . The best Mughal dishes in this town without a doubt.
Achari paneer Tikka and Firangi Kebab are my personal favourite. Although it's hard to stick to a favorite in Sultan. Each food item is cooked to perfection.The price is so reasonable that at times it's hard to believe how they offer such food at such cheap rates. Eating here is bliss full experience. Garlic naan and murg badami go well with each other. The burhani they serve is a bit spicy though. The masala cola they serve is a very refreshing beverage. The staff are prompt and service is relatively fast. I simply love this place from the core of my heart and I would just not recommend but request everyone to do have a meal in Sultan. And I might sound a bit biased but I felt the food was even more tastier than in Oudh. It has a very busy take away counter and  they deliver food till late nights. One of the busiest outlets in the locality.

Sultan at Lake View Road is mainly known as late night serving restaurant. Apart from their delivery they also have a small ac dine. We were there for bloggers meet in a small group. Then we were served some of their signature dishes. Not only the taste of this dishes surprised us also their garnishing impressed us well. So here is our menu...

Masala Cola (3.5/5) :
------------------------------------------
Cola with Jal Jira always tastes good, even better when enjoying with Kebabs and Biryani. Little bit spicy and costs Rs.50.

Firangi Kebab (4/5) :
------------------------------------------
This dish was made like Chicken resmi kebab with hot liquid cheese sauce on top. Very nicely served and garnished with salad and green chutney it was made in traditional style. The smoky flavour and grilled hard chicken with cheese sauce tasted very nice. Not the softest chicken but liked its flavour. Its one of their signature dishes available for Rs.230 and recommended over here.

Garlic Naan (4/5) :
-----------------------------------
First of all their Naan smelt great, secondly I saw real chopped garlic on it that isn't very common in every other place. Garlic Naan with its smoky burned flavour felt decent with Murg Badami.

Murg Badami (4.25/5) :
------------------------------------------
So, It was something new. Awadi Chicken dish garnished with crushed peanuts on top. This dish was butter smooth & tasted brilliant with Garlic Naan. Chicken pieces dipped into the yellow gravy with the mixed flavour of traditional rich & mild spices were great to taste. Available for Rs.220 one of the bestest option with Naan over here.

Mutton Biryani (3.5/5) :
----------------------------------------------
This Mutton Biryani was really rich and spicy in nature. It was served in true awadhi style in a handi with layes of rice, big potato, boiled egg and 2 big mutton pieces. The colour texture of the Biryani with brownish fried onions gave it an authentic look. Mutton pieces were soft inside and little burned on layers that gave it smoky burned flavour matching the Biryani. Priced at Rs.160 it is for the people love to have rich spicy food.

Burhani (3.5/5) :
----------------------------------
In Gujarati and Urdu language its known as Chaach, In Bangladeshei its Burhani. Formally known as butter milk this spicy white drink helps to improve body metabolism. Priced at Rs.50 it is a must needed drink after their rich & spicy food.

Conclusion :
----------------------------
If you love spicy Awadhi & North Indian food this isn't just good delivery option till midnight, also you can visit this place for simple dine experiance.

After hearing lot of good reviews and recommendations went to Sultan to try out their food but honestly I was disappointed. 

Located at Desapriyo park area this outlet is not hard to find can be spotted easily. Parking is not an issue as well.

As its a small place and the decor is nothing to mention I would not waste time to describe the ambiance. Coming straight to food we ordered Murg malai Kebab and Chicken tandoori Chuza as starter. Both roasted decent but didnt really impress my tastebuds rather the chicken was a bit stif to be frank.
Next in the main course Biriyani, Murg lababdar and Butter nan and tandoori roti. Biriyani was very dry and didnt really taste good as well. Mughal lababdar tasted good but the biggest disappointment was the breads. Both nan and tandoori roti was very stiff and rubber like chewy taste.
I took friends along who love Indian and was quite excited for them to try this place but they cleary let me down. Only good part was the service the but serving was really good at work and this adding .5 star extra just for him .

Good Indian food ...Have been there for few times and it always has charmed me with its good quality food.The owner was particularly very approachable and charming.He personally supervised our dinner and advised us about the best offerings of the day.Hats off to Sultan for such quality mughlai dishes.The only con I found was that the space was a bit constrained and the decor needed a bit of upgradation.But I'm sure Sultan wud soon overcome these shortcomings in future and rule our tastebuds for years to come.

Specially chicken Badami and Paneer Lababdar... Service was slow but i can understand that because it was very busy place on that time... Prices are pocket friendly because all prices are inclusive of GST...

On nabam ni8 at about 2a.m i visited this restaurant with my friends, in search of a pocket friendly restro. At that time we were in baallygunge cultural so We firstly searched for nearby restaurants and after seeing SULTAN'S menu we were quute satisfied with their prizes, but after entering the restro and seeng their menu, we found that they have increased their prizes by about 50rs, which made us dissappointed, but still we ordered from there as it was late ni8. We ordered 5plate mutton biryani, for 5of us. The time they took to serve the food was also tyring, and quantity is also very poor but tge quality and taste was good. At that time because of huge hunger we were not satisfied with their quantity, it cannot satisfy a hungry belly.

Sultan is located in Lake View Road just beside the Ballygunge Cultural Pujo Association. We visited the place during the Durga Puja and almost missed the restaurant as it was obscured from view by the puja pandal. The place is quite small and has 2-3 tables of four seats each. We had Egg Biriyani and Murgh Tikka Lababdar. The Egg Biriyani tasted as usual. The Murgh Tikka Lababdar had six pieces of chicken along with a curry which had a tingent smell. We were glad by the fact that we found a good restaurant which was bookmarked by me for a long time during the pujas and did not have to wait outside. The food quality could be better.

An amazing mughlai delicacy in Kolkata. Easy to locate. The eatery is a bit shabby . We ordered kasturi kebab, Mutton biriyani, tandoori butter roti, chicken chaap and burhani. The biriyani was amazing and the flavor was light, so one can easily binge on it. Chicken chaap was heavenly good, the big pieces were beautifully cooked. We were a bit disappointed with the kebab as it wasn't served hot, but the taste was good. Service can be better..

After hearing so many good reviews about this place, I decided to give it a visit. The place is really small. They can accommodate 12-15 people at most. Coming to food, we ordered Zafrani Pulav, Badami Murg, Roomali Roti and Chicken Kasha ( which the staff suggested that they can make instead of Chaanp). Most of their dishes were unavailable.  Zafrani Pulao is average. There was no sweetness and tasted very bland. Chicken Kasha had two pieces of chicken and the gravy tasted mainly of red chilli powder. Again an average dish. The Roomali Roti was like normal. Murgh Badami was good. There were 6 pieces of boneless chicken and gravy was thick and tasted of cashews and almonds. Overall, a very average place. Though they took almost 1 hour to serve the food, the staff were polite and welcoming.

Here comes the hidden gems of South Kolkata " SULTAN ". Just opposite to Desopriyo park there is a " Jugals " sweet shop at the corner of the Lake View road , take this lane by the sweet shop and just a 2-3 mins walk and by your left you will find this hidden gems of awadhi delicacy. Thought the place is small , don't have much sitting capacity but as we all know " GOOD THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES "😋

Now coming to the food , the bestest part of this restaurant... The quality , quantity and the taste is not at all like any other normal restaurants but much much better , I would rather say one of the best . And I think everyone one should visit this place for having a quality food and true awadhi delicacy...

Chicken Kasturi Kebab - soft , juicy , chicken kebabs coated with the white part of the egg , creating a fluffy cover around the kebabs . It was one of the best I have ever had . I would have marked it 10 out of 5 if possible...

Chicken Malai Kebab - the Kebab pieces were very tender and perfect mix of spices and topped with Malai ( fresh cream )..

Masala Kulcha - Stuffed with chopped veggies , potato , and paneer . Nicely baked nd was very tender.

Sabz Takatin - Mix vegetables , sweet corn , nd paneer made in spicy red sauce.. Truly it tastes awesome... Being a meat lover I am saying this , this particular veg curry has stolen my heart.

Goshth Briyani - Now this is what I say true love. For those who r briyani lovers, you need to visit dis place at least once. The Briyani was still one of the best in Kolkata. The Mutton piece was very tender and juicy nd there was a perfect mix of spices in this briyani- true awadhi I will say .

Chicken chaap - This is also one of the best I ever had in Kolkata. Brilliant mix of spices , very well cooked and the pieces of chicken were of good size , soft , and alluring. Not like the traditional one where the gravy remains in one place nd the oil floats around nd sometimes the chicken pieces remains dry as well. The texture of the gravy was perfect to have it with briyani , having some fried onion toppings over it .

Last but not the least comes Cola Shikhanzi , and Burahni - this was aslo awesome . A glass full of creamy milk like drink almost tastes like masala chaas , was like blessing for the stomach after having so much of oily food...

In short a many many thanks to

Big surprise may often come into a small box, but when some awesome quality Awadhi dishes come to your plate, I’m sure some gastronomical reaction already started to happen before you finish this line. Yes, Welcome to SULTAN, the Hidden gems for North Indian Cuisine.

The restaurant located at the Lake View Road. If you are coming from Kalighat Metro or Gariahut, take the lane besides of the iconic sweet shop Jugals. Take a 2-3minutes walk and you will find the restaurant at the left foot.

Been there yesterday with my fellow foodie friends for a Bloggers’ meet. So let’s come and explore this place. Here are the food we were introduced –

1.	Kasturi Kebab (4.5/5.0) – Something different than other traditional kebabs. The chicken part was coated with the egg and then it was grilled. Wow, what a concept. Love the puffy texture and the chicken fillings were so great, it will surely makes your day. Highly recommended.

2.	Malai Kebab (4.5/5.0) – Six pieces chicken were served with fresh cream and the salad. The presentation was really eye-catching and taste was almost perfect. Perfectly grilled, love the aroma.

3.	Masala Kulcha (4.0/5.0) – Personally I’m not a Roti fan, but this dish really keeps me astonished when I get some real paneer fillings inside of a Kulcha. Wow, what a concept. Love the taste.

4.	Sabzi Takatin (5.0/5.0) – Frankly, this dish is the example what a full vegetarian dish can be, when it is cooked perfectly with some simple ingredients. You simply have no idea a paneer dish with some spicy gravy made of corn, spring onion and veggies could be so great, unless you have it. With Kulcha, it goes absolutely perfect.

5.	Ghosth Biriyani (5.0/5.0) – Biriyani is not just a food, it is kinda emotion for every Kolkatan. Yes, as a Biriyani Lover, I will say this one of the best Mutton Biriyani I’ve ever tasted. So forget about the Brands like Arsalan, Aminia etc. and try Sultan. Two pieces soft and juicy mutton pieces were served with aloo and egg. The rice quantity is more than sufficient for one person and it was cooked perfectly. No sign of excess oil but perfect blend of spice and craftsmanship make this emotional dish a heavenly one. Super recommended.

6.	Chicken Chaap (5.0/5.0)– Big soft two pieces of chicken pieces were served with lip smacking gravy. It is not like traditional chaap, where the chicken part remains sometimes dry or the gravy to oily! The chicken pieces were cooked slowly with right amount of Indian spices and the fried onion touch at the gravy was just like cherry on top. The dish is simply mind blowing like its texture and goes excellent with the Biriyani.

7.	Masala Coke & Burani (4.0/5.0)– Masala coke was served with our biryani. Nothing special about it but the Burani was really awesome.A glassful of lite creamy milk may sometimes tastes like Chaas, but taste wise it was far better than that one. After consuming so much oily food, the drink is really a blessing to your stomach.

So in conclusion, I will say Sultan is one of the blessing for Awadhi Cuisine, South Kolkata have ever gotten. The restaurant may seems a little far from the other part of Kolkata, but have their biryani and I will say it will be worthy trying.

Special thanks to Mr.

Kolkata is currently going through a revolution in terms of gastronomic delights. Cuisines from all over the world has entered our pallate. International cuisines like Thai, Japanese, Portugese, french, Mexican, Spanish have become a household name, and who can forget the good ol' Chinese? But it's gratifying to see that our own cuisine, our own food has not lost it's charm. All the continental dishes in the world can't beat the bliss of a plate of Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Chaap. And Sultan has kept the flag of North Indian cuisine flying high with all it's might. Located in Lake View Road, near Deshapriya Park and Priya Cinema Hall, this restaurant has already created quite an uproar in the foodie community. And my 5rating is a proof of that.

Here are some of the dishes that we tasted yesterday.
*Kasturi Kabab- The first dish that was served was already a match winner even before it was brought to us. The sight of the kababs coated with egg was a treat to my hungry eyes. The taste was nothing short of heaven. The faint smoky flavour was amazing. The kabab was soft and moist and everything that a kabab should be.

*Malai Kabab- This one's highly recommended too. Juicy soft kababs with malai spread on top of it was delicious. The malai,especially, made with fresh cream and sugar, tasted really great.

*Kulcha Roti- Even though I am strictly a rice person, the Kulchas managed to impress me with it's softness and generous stuffings.

*Sabzi Takatin- The name itself peaked my interest though I am a hard-core non-vegetarian (Bengali, you see). And what a dish it was!!! Made with Paneer, corn and peas, the dish just blew me away with it's taste. It was simply outstanding. Such simple ingredients could be transformed into such a masterpiece, I had no idea.

*Mutton Biriyani- It was really one of the Best Biriyanis I have ever tasted. Actually make it THE BEST. I don't remember ever being so impressed with Biriyani and regretting that I am not able to squeeze in another spoon more. Rich and aromatic and oily. It was all those things that make a foodie's heart beat faster.

*Chicken Chaap- Now let's get one thing straight. This is not your everyday Chaap with barely any flesh attached to the bones. These were fleshy big chicken pieces that makes you hungry just by the sight of it. The Chicken pieces was brilliantly cooked. It was soft and juicy as hell placed in a plate of spicy thick gravy. What more can one want?

*Burhani- It was a thick milky masala drink meant for proper digestion. I loved it. After all the greasiness of Biriyani and Chaap and kababs, this came as a gust of fresh air. It tasted more like a Chaas, but more delicious and refreshing.

The length of my review should be an indication of how much I loved the place and it's food. So, don't wait. Go and have a meal. And don't forget to review.
Thank you Mr.

The eatery is located near Ballygunge Cultural Puja venue. It is a very small joint with a sitting capacity of 12 people. My first disappointment was with the ac as it was not working though present there.
We were served special mutton Biriyani and murg Malai kabab with fresh lime soda. The quantity of biriyani was not satisfactory and the aloo which I consider to be very important in biriyani was very disappointing. It had no taste and was stiff. The mutton pieces were average in size but pretty soft.
Malai murg chicken pieces were not very soft or juicy and the beverage was masala sprinkled on juice at room temperature.
I would have given this place 3 max but the staff was extremely polite and cordial. 0.5 for that.

Sultan has been an absolute favourite for North Indian food at affordable prices.
Kastoori kebab: the fluffy egg white coating is the primary feature of this starlet.
Malai kebab: the Malai cream is too good.
Their kebabs are succulent and perfectly cooked and the malai toppings are a treat.
Sabz Takatin: This vegetarian dish impressed me so much... especially having with the Masala kulcha was a delight!

Mutton Biryani: the mutton pieces were soft and that is a delight.
Chicken Chaap: This stole the show for me today I have never had such a well spiced and delicious looking Chaap before.
The Burhani drink that they served was perfect this time.

Thanks Mr

This is my first visit to this small food joint. With room for not more than 10-12 people, this is a pretty nice place. However, my experience is a mixed bag. There were quite a few highs alongside a number of lows. The biggest drawback for a place which serves North Indian/Awadhi cuisines is the unavailability of Biryani. The fish items and drumstick items were not available as well.

Among all those they could serve, we opted for Firangi Kabab (instead of Tangri Mumtaz which was our primary choice), Masala Kulcha, Rarra Gosht and Cola Shikanji. Now the biggest disappointment was this cola shikanji. It wqs high-priced and it wasn't cold and it tasted pretty average. So a complete no-no for my next visit here.

But the rest of the dishes were delicious, particularly the firangi kabab. Even the Rarra Gosht was really yum!

The hosts were courteous and they kept checking regarding anything that we needed. So that's a real thumbs-up for the food joint.

PS: The restaurant authority allows you to celebrate birthdays as I found a group celebrating with a cake bought from a different place. (It annoyed me a bit because they were too loud within such a small enclosure, but I feel there was not much the restaurant could do probably)

Essentially, this review will tell you about two different experiences I encountered in this restaurant. The rating could easily have been 4 to 4.5 if it was only about the food. Alas, everything comes into consideration and takes that away a bit.

This is a small eatery with a capacity of 10 to 12. With a birthday celebration going on when we visited(who were allowed to cut the cake, as we noticed...something that is appreciable), the place did feel a bit noisy. The staff were cordial and tended to our needs appropriately, from multiple summoning to get drinking water to enquiring whether the food was as per our satisfaction. Well, flying colours till now.

So, we ordered two Cola Shikanjis(a real mistake on our part), Firangi Kabab, two Masala Kulchas and Rarra Gosht.

1. Cola Shikanji - Oh dear! All the stars to follow it but this was the epic dud! The drink had no freshness and it wasn't either cold. Also, with 60rs being charged, the quantity could have been the double of it, easily(no, I'm not doing the comparison with actual cold drink prices...just saying that the other dishes have such generosity in price that this is a vivid bummer that makes a stark contrast).

2. Firangi Kebab - This is indeed special as they advertise. A controlled lathering of cheese atop the juicy kebab pieces creating a fusion of the tender and the gooey uniqueness. The dipping sauce accompanying it is also mild with a flavour that invokes a vibe of sweetness but not quite exactly that! Yes...it was something new for the taste buds! The name is undoubtedly referring to the cheese used in the dish!
SADLY, this wasn't our first choice! It was TANGRI MUMTAZ. As we came to know, rice items, fish items and drumsticks weren't available at that time! A bummer, for sure since Tangri Mumtaz and Mahi Hariyali Tikka were in our wishlist.

3. Rarra Gosht - The gravy is a tad bit tangy for my taste but that's my personal qualm and not a dig at the dish itself. The pieces were indeed cooked to perfection and it tore apart along the grain with ease. The spices entered the pieces perfectly! It wasn't heavy and thus quite enjoyable.

4. Masala Kulcha - The kulchas had a stuffing of tenderly cooked julienned carrots(small pieces), cheese and some other stuffs. It was really light and indeed, a treat! Two kulchas were enough to calm the wolves, for both of us!

Now, this is for the management team. Running this establishment successfully do cover the time crunch. We had to wait quite a long time(yes, we appreciated that you informed it will take 6 to 7 minutes for the mains to arrive, without even us asking you). The kebabs appeared around 15 to 20 minutes, at least, after the shikanjis and the mains 15mins after that! The food is impeccable...the service time, not so much!

Lastly, the pocket pinch is a real bliss! All the food and drinks came under 800rs! Great food, okay ambiance, polite staffs...slow service... This sums up the review!

When Biriyani is the ultimate love
The restaurant is located in Kolkata near Deshapriya Park. It’s a outlet having a seating capacity of 12 only. The main thing about this restaurant is that if you feel hungry at night you can really opt for this restaurant. It use to open at 3 pm and close around 2.30 am midnight on weekdays and till 3 am in weekends. Another main reason that opted me to write a write up is the quality and the taste.

Delivery was decent. Food is also tasty and delicious, they cook good biriyani with proper aroma. Customer support is also good for eg, i ordered one ghosth biriyani and one murgh badami but at first place they delivered two biriyani instead of one later it was replaced.

Heard about this place for serving awesome Biriyanis and for them keeping their place open till late at night.Was courteously greetd by the Owner,so suggested their specialities.

We ordered.
Firangi Kebabs - Chicken Kebabs served with a Cheesy sauce.

Special Gosht Biriyani - Speechless,Such a light yet flavourful biriyani.Felt like having the full plate to my self hence ordered another one.The meat was tender and succulent as well.

Chicke Chanp-Fell for this dish,Undoubtedly one of the better tasting Chicken Chanps i have had.The gravy tasted super and took to a different league.

Ended on a fizzy note with Cola Sikanji.

Awadhi cuisine is all about aromatic essence and royalistic flavours, and Sultan stands out to be outstanding in both. The aroma of mughlai dishes can make any person forget their diet plans, it has such strong essence. Sultan can be counted as hidden gem, since it is not known by many. However, once you discover this place, you know for sure where to head next time for awadhi cuisine. Beside the lane in Jugals Sweets in Desapriya Park, this place is easily locatable. With the sitting area which can accomodate 10-12 people, the interiors and ambience is quite and eye soothing.

Most horrible experience ever.... ordered at 9pm.... delivery happened at 11 pm that too after n number of follow ups. And adding to the surprise, incomplete delivery.the desserts were missing. Ask them for a solution....they say we will deliver it tomorrow....I mean seriously...!!!! You order food for today, and get it the next day!!!!! Horrible

Now after dashing them with messages...they bring the dessert....and this time half of what I ordered !!!! Seriously!!!

' S U L T A N ' A Mughlai Cuisine just near Desopriya Park. One should drop by if you love mughal dishes. A cozy resturant with great ambience.
A pocket friendly resturant.

The Appetizer section

● Paneer Achari Kebab (4/5) : The paneer was so soft that it actually melted in the mouth and the flavour of 'Achar' was perfectly blended with it. Absolutely amazing.
● Murgh Badami Kebab (5/5) : Small chicken pieces perfectly marinated with the badam paste. Every bite will give you rich badam taste to your tastebuds. Personal favourite. Strongly RECOMMENDED.
● Murgh Tulsi Kebab (4.5/5) : First try and it was delicious. Really surprised to believe the flavours of tulsi with succulent chicken kebabs would be a great combination. Strongly RECOMMENDED.

Moving to the main course

● Garlic Nun (4/5) : The nun was really soft and nicely blended with the garlic flavour. Garlic Nun with DaL Dum Phukt (veg) and Gosht Sagwala is must try for everyone.
● Dal Dum Phukt (4.5/5) : Perfectly cooked. Simply delicious. Though its a veg dish but it has the perfect Mughal flavours in it.
● Gosht Sagwala (5/5) : At first i had a second thought about the dish. Gosht (Mutton) with Spinach (Shaag) how would it taste ? Umm ! But i felt in love with the dish as soon as i had it with the Garlic Nun. The spinach was perfectly cooked and mixed with the mutton. Mutton was too soft. This dish is absolutely mouth watering. ❤ Strongly RECOMMENDED.
● Murgh Biryani with Raita (4.5/5) : It comes with 1 egg sliced half on the top , 1 potato and 2 Big pieces of Chicken and quantity of the rice is perfect to be shared by 2 people. It is cooked in Awadi style. I cant get over this because biryani is love, its an emotion. One of the best biryani served in Kolkata by 'Sultan'. Strongly RECOMMENDED.

Coming to The Dessert section

● Sahi Tukra (5/5) : Just wow! Its a royal treat to the tastebuds. 2 slices of bread toasted nicely and mixed with milk and butter with almond and safron toppings. Personal favourite. Strongly RECOMMENDED.

A must visit for everyone to try something out of box.

Thankyou Mr.

So glad to introduce this, hidden gem to my foodie friends out there! Sultan!
This is one of the best places, to satisfy your mughlai food cravings, at a pocket friendly budget! And well if you live in the southern parts of kolkata, then you just got lucky! Because they serve till 2'o clock in the night!
Now coming to the food, Mr. Sudipto Karmakar, the owner, presented in front of us an array of mughlai dishes,and well it surely had us salivating! 😋
For the starters we had:
Paneer achari Kabab: Big chunks of paneer tikka, having a achari flavour, which melted instantly with the bite! Absolute delight!
Murgh Tulsi Kabab: This was rather an innovative kabab, that tasted awesome! The slight flavour of basil in the aftertaste of the succulent chicken kababs was delicious!
Murgh Badami Kabab: The best of the lot! Juicy pieces of kabas well marrinated in badam paste, this one made my inner soul happy :) Must try!
Next in the main course we had perfectly made garlic naan with dal dumpukht! Now this dal is a must try! Though it is a vegeterian dish, but will satisfy you no less! Perfectly made,totally recommended, and goes really well with the garlic naan!
Next came the gosht saagwala, at first I was a bit sceptical about the combination, but just one bite of the mutton changed my thoughts! The mutton was beautifully cooked, which melted in our mouth, and the saag curry was a finger licking affair!
And finally, came the Murgh Biriyani with raita! Perfectly made awadhi biriyani, and this surely beats some of the well known branded biriyanis of kolkata! Huge quantity, can be easily shared by two people, with decently sized chicken pieces, and an egg! A must try!
Finally in the desserts, we had sahi tukra! Which was agian a masterpiece! Completing the sumptous awadhi dinner!
A big thanx to

Visited this place yesterday and was quite happy with the behaviour of the staffs and also the food .. nice place + pocket-friendly .. the quantity of the food was also good .. we ordered biriyani both murgh and mutton .. but the only problem was that the mutton pieces were small ... like really small 😑 ... otherwise the food was tasty and was also quickly served to us  😊

Hey Sultan..!! After having a proper dinner at this restaurant I can really say “Hey Sultan… Apko Salaam”.

The restaurant is located in Kolkata near Deshapriya Park. It’s a outlet having a seating capacity of 12 only. The main thing about this restaurant is that if you feel hungry at night you can really opt for this restaurant. It use to open at 3 pm and close around 2.30 am midnight on weekdays and till 3 am in weekends. Another main reason that opted me to write a write up is the quality and the taste. I can say it’s a hidden gem in the city.

The food we had for the dinner were Paneer Achari Kebab, Murgh Badami Kebab, Murgh Tulsi Kebab, Garlic Naan, Dal Dampukht, Gosht Sagwala, Murgh Biryani, Raita and the most delicious “Saahi Tukra”.

Now let me describe some of the items:-

Murgh Badami Kebab– The chicken being marinated with nuts and other ingredients and then roasted in a hot oven. The taste was perfect and the chicken was perfectly cooked and roasted.

Murgh Tulsi Kebab – The chicken being marinated with basil leaf paste or “tulsi patta” and then being roasted. After every bite you will find a hint of coldness due to this tulsi patta making it a much delicious kebab.

Dal Dampukht- One of the best dal I ever had. The dal being cooked and being put on dum. The taste was just fabulous making a must try one at this restaurant.

Gosht Sagwala- The mutton being cooked with spinach. The mutton was perfectly cooked and even the quality was much better than any other restaurant I must say. The mutton pieces was soft as anything. Even the recipe was much better of adding spinach in it. Thumbs up to this one.

Murgh Biryani- If you are health conscious then you should visit this outlet for biryani. The biryani was good enough. Cooked in an Awadhi style and the fried onion was there for garnishing making it a good factor whenever it goes into you mouth. The biryani is cooked in a less oil making it a less oily biryani with a good taste. A perfect option for health conscious biryani lover. By the way at midnight it’s a heaven for biryani lovers.

Saahi Tukra- The bread being fried deeply having been mixed with sugar syrup with toppings of kheer and dry fruits. Loved this desert a lot. One should must try.

 

Frankly speaking being a big foodie and being a big choosy of foods. I will really suggest every food lovers to visit this place. Really good one.

Had such a fabulous Mughlai meal after a long time and I was stuffed till my throat even after 4 hours while I penned this article! It has a small & cozy interior, accommodating up to 12 people at a go. It’s a Kebab lover’s paradise and a must try for every Mughlai cuisine lover. ● Location: Near Priya cinema hall. Go straight inside the lane beside ‘Jugals’ and walk for a minute; it’s on the left-hand side of the road.
                                                                ...

Sultan-Deshapriya Park,is all about understanding the authentic "Awadhi Cuisine" and what makes it so special.

From the delectable and delicious kebabs to the Biriyani-Flavours of which convinces your tastebuds for good.

"Paneer Achari Kebab" (4/5) offers you a tangy treat with the surprising flavours of the "Achaar" blending perfectly with flat and soft fibres of the paneer.

"Murgh Tulsi Kebab" (4.6/5) is one such dish which offers you calmness and a cool sensation to your tastebuds.The flavours of tulsi perfectly settles in with the juices of the perfectly marinated and cooked chicken.

"Murgh Badaami Kebab" (4.5/5) has a rough textured outer layering with the flavours of "badaam" lingering your kebab journey towards the succulent and soft inner lining of the kebab.The smoky flavours slightly dampened by the rich essences of badaam.

"Dal Dum Pukht" (4.5/5) cooked over a very low flame, generally in sealed containers with very less spices,when teamed up with "Butter Naan" or "Tandoori Roti",offers the eater with lip smacking flavours.

"Gosht Saagwala" (5/5) Succulent mutton pieces blending with the buttery spinach gravy,creating ceremony of flavours.
Yes that's what Gosht Saagwala tasted to me.
I believe,it's one of finest experiments of "Sultan".
The unpredictability of this dish is what makes it so special.
(RECOMMENDED)

"Murgh Biriyani" (4.5/5) the smell of which is mesmerizing and the flavours are tough to forget.
Perfect flow of spices,calculative marination of the meat, distinctive flavour and aroma and the blend altogether,brings out the taste of the biriyani in full harmony.

"Shahi Tukda" (4/5) is the ultimate offering to your sweet tooth,an awadhi dessert which'll shake awake your senses and will give you that perfect conclusion to awadhi food journey.
What makes "Shahi Tukda" so distinctive and delicious is still a mystery! 😍

Located somewhere in between Desopriyo Park and Triangular Park, this place has a blink and a miss appearance. Mostly a takeaway food joint, there is nice cosy seating arrangement for 10-12 people. As the name suggests, Royal Mughlai food is their usp and they do live upto that expectation to a large extent. Mutton Biriyani was good, a bit different from the Kolkata style biriyani, which we are accustomed to, more towards awadhi dum pukht style. The@ Mutton white gravy to go with it, was the best of the lot. Chello kebab was tasty but a bit costly. Overall a good experience.

Ohkay. I have heard a lot about this place and my expectations were sky high. :D
Also the fact that they deliver post 12 am was amazing.
The food was good, portion size could be a bit bigger probably!!
The kebab was delicious. And so was the Nihari.

The Naan had gotten cold over the travel so became a bit tough to bite into but that's cause of the heat, so ignored! :)

Enjoyed. And thank you :)

We went to sultan for a late night dinner on 15th August. The restaurant was small. We started with their signature starter dish of Firanghi kabab and the chef choice murg tulsi tikka. In the main course, we had their famous gosht Biriyani , keema nun, garlic nun and murg lababdar. The owner Sudipto was courteous and helpful. The food and service was excellent. Highly recommended for mughlai dishes in Kolkata.

The Sultan review was pending for such a long time and i finally decide to pen it down simply for the sake of the good people who had served some excellent mughlai dishes on June 3rd 2017 . In the current scenario I believe having a good North Indian Restaurant which serves good food in decent budget to your table consistently is a rarity . The Arsalans , Aminias and oudhs are household names now with crowds enthusiastic more about brands and less about food . Sultan breaks that stereotype like a boss . It's a tiny place where you can get exactly what you desire . Good quality North Indian , Awadhi cuisine without much fuss and glitters . If you read all the reviews of Sultan , what you will predominantly see is sentences that praise food and nothing else . My experience in Sultan was blessful,  we were 2 hungry guys coming out of a movie theatre late at night ( at about 10.30 pm ) and had already pre-planned to visit the restaurant because guess what , it had a good reputation and also serve food till 2 am.

° Location :- Okay so Sultan is located at Lake View Road . And if you are coming from Lake Mall side via Rashbehari Avenue you will take the lane that exists exactly after the Sarat Bose Road on your right which is a few yards after you get Priya on your left . If you have problems decoding what I said just see the maps and you will get to know that i am right .


° Ambience & Service ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- This is a very small restaurant but still they will manage to serve a large group by arranging their furniture so don't get disheartened if you see the repititative mention of it being small in all the reviews . Tables are mostly arranged in a capacity of 4 so that's the best number to go in . Inspite of being small it is not that cramped and the best news is they have a basin to wash your hands . Service is not the fastest and if you are visiting quite late at night you won't find most of the mocktails and desserts available but when it comes to their usual offerings you can be assured that they will be served without much fuss.

------------------------------------

FOOD : I have rambled enough and i am truly glad that I am done with the usual location , ambience and all other options stuff because now I can write about food . I was so impressed by the following dishes that i can still pretty much say what I really had even after 2 months from that experience.

1. Firangi Kabaab ( 5 / 5 ) :- Okay so this is their house special offering and it is a truly a masterpiece . I don't know why the name is like that but i will just assume that the intervention of cheese gives the meat a firangi touch maybe ? Anyway you have had cheese malai kabaab before and most of them had a layer of cheese melted on top of them forming an upper layer . This is nothing like that my friend . Here the kabaab is bathed in hot melted cheese such as they almost soak the cheese into themselves . As a result when you bite into the kabaab , you get the cheese and the beautiful meat within the texture . If everyone is saying this is a good dish , there must be something in it and I just described you the reason . If you someone who has not tried the Firangi Kabaab from Sultan , you are truly missing something my friend .

2. Masala Kulcha ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- It's in the bill with that name keema naan but we had actually ordered masala kulcha . Please ignore that part from the bill pic . People talk a lot about keema Nan  from here so it must be good . But we went for masala kulcha and it was stunning . Served deliciously hot and fresh the kulcha had a super tasty filling of potatoes and cheese . We absolutely loved it . Please do order , you will love it .

3. Zafrani pulao ( 5 / 5 ) :- This is best zafrani pulao that I have had till date on record . Firstly it was served steaming hot which automatically rewarded the dish with a fine smell. Secondly the amount of saffron added to the milk was just expertly exact such as that nothing in the rice was overpowering . What you will have is clean long grained rice with clear distinct saffron and cream flavours hot in your mouth and there is nothing more exciting about that . Flavorful pulao at it's best . If ever you are thinking about having something other than a Biryani , this pulao will be a fine replacement .

4. Murgh chaap ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Probably the most underwhelming dish in the table but still good enough . The issue I found was that there was just a single leg piece of chicken for a dish with a price tag of 230 .It needs another piece of chicken to be honest . Other than that the meat was tender and the chaap masala was perfect for me . Spicy and flavorful , the chaap will do well with kulcha and rice .

5. Nalli Nihari ( 4 / 5 ) :- I was very inquisitive as well as apprehensive going into this dish because of its history and obviously the making . And I am glad that they very much got it right . As much as I remember I think there were 4 pieces of mutton with the nalli evenly spread in the gravy . Unlike other nihari their gravy is not that rich . Rather a soothing one , one which can easily have via a spoon after you are almost done with the dish . I found the nalli Nihari just perfect to go with the kulcha . The mutton was tender and the gravy with the richness of the nalli just fantastic . Highly recommended from my side .

----------------------------------------

° VERDICT :- Sultan is one of the finest places to have North Indian cuisine and very few people will doubt it . Take a break from your usual mughlai choices and come visit this restaurant . Take a break from your usual choice of dishes and order the ones that I have mentioned and I guarantee you will have a fine experience . If you don't , I want you to let or the guys at the restaurant know what u found wrong . My guess is you won't and even if you do , the guys will definitely  improve upon them . By the way a lot of people like their biryani too so now you don't have any reason to bunk it .

This is a small restaurant serving North Indian and Awadhi cuisine. Located in a lane near Priya Cinema, Google Maps comes in handy for exact directions. A take-away counter gives way to the main entrance.The interior is impressive with paintings and soothing lights. The staff is very courteous and efficient. They come up with good suggestions if you have trouble deciding what to order with a particular dish.
For starters, we had Firangi Kabab and Kasturi Kabab. Both kababs were too delicious! Well marinated and roasted to perfection.For the main course, we ordered Mutton Biryani, Chicken Chaap, Garlic Naan, Mutton Pudina Pasinda and Subz Pulao. The biryani was AMAZING! The chicken chaap went perfectly with it.The Pulao and Mutton Pudina were excellent as well!
We were informed that they take stay open till 3 AM and take home-delivery orders upto 2:30 AM, too! I definitely plan to visit this place very soon to try more of their dishes.

Mughlai and awadhi cuisine during monsoons is pure  bliss and when you have some amazing people to accompany you.

Located in desabpriya park just walk down the lane of jugals and you will reach this small joint. Yes, the place is small but let me tell the food speaks a lot.

So we order 
1. Ferangi kebabs 
2. Kasturi kebabs 
3.fish tikka gondghoraj 
4. Boti kebab- badani 

I am salivating actually while  I am writing about the kebabs. They were marvelous specially the fish tikka gondghoraj. The fish was fresh and full of flavours. 

For the main course we had...
1. Mutton biryani - unlike other biryani which is oily and rich I found this one to be less oily and full of aroma. Tasty indeed. 

2. Chicken chap- you should definitely try out the chicken chap out here, you won't regret. 

3. Mutton Pudina pasinda - something new I have tried and I liked it very much.

4. Keenan nan

The place is located in the lane of Jugals in Deshapriyo park.
The place is small but the food speaks volumes of it. 'Sultan' as the names suggests is the next best place for mughlai and Awadhi food!

Some of my favourites and recommendations are :
* Mutton Biryani
* Fish Gandharaj
*Keema Naan
* Mahi Dumphukt ( Vetki cooked in gravy)
* Mutton Pudina Pasanda

This place has the added attraction of delivery upto 2:30-3 am in ballygunj and areas around it.

Use Coupon Code ' SFOODS ' and get Rs 75 off on your next Zomato online order(online payment).

Located in the lane going in beside Jugals(Lake View). Is a small restaurant serving sumptuous mughlai/North Indian dishes at quiet a reasonable cost.

Service is very good! 9.5/10 and you get services till 2.30-3am with home delivery
Ambience is splendid! 9/10

»Starters«
★Firangi Kebab(10/10) : A brilliantly delicious starter in the menu, soft and juicy chicken with it's flavor sprouting on the tastebuds is a steal deal!

★Fish Tikka(8/10): Found a small bone, which I consumed mistakenly, lord bless it didn't get stuck. The taste was 'Dhuadaar'! . Unique and exemplary!

»Main Course«
Mutton Biryani(8/10): 2 pieces, huge quantity of rice can be shared easily. Comes with an egg and presented beautifully. Pleasant aroma and palatable.

Garlic Naan(9/10): I love garlic naan and having this after quiet a while. They're crunchy, soft and flavorful.

Mahi Dumpukht(10/10): Delicious and well cooked, and Kono kotha hobena boss(Enough Said!)

Chicken Chaap(9.5/10): 1 huge piece. Can be shared. The taste is overwhelming and it's isn't as oily as you see in moat restaurant, but that oil less thing doesn't compromise even a bit of taste! Biryani er sathe Chicken Chaap sobar baap!

♡Burahni♡ 10/10
Ended our meal with this chaanch like thing. It's good for your health. Sour and spicy

The famous Mughlai cuisine evolved in Medieval India during the Mughal Empire. Mughlai cuisine is generally quite spicy, rich and heavy marked with a very unique aroma. Influenced from mughlai, Awadhi has over time remained one of the most popular and favourite cuisines among foodies across India.

Sultan is now one of the trending Awadhi restaurants in Kolkata.Located in the Lake View Road Sultan delivers till midnight across the city.It's a small place but who cares if you are getting the unique use of combination of ground and whole spices and the distinguishing aroma that gives each dish a unique and exotic taste.Late night dining is also available there and that's one of the key points of Sultan.

Awadhi food does not make use of hundred-odd spices to produce each dish but a blend of handful but not so common spices.
Road House Blue drink is a pleasant choice to start.

Kebabs were superb,Firangi kebabs (Sultan special) was mouthwatering with creamy cheese sauce.The sophisticated Kasturi kebab was brilliant.The soft and juicy Boti Kebab Badami is highly recommended of them.Fish Tikka Gandharaj was nothing but the Calcutta Vetki marinated with gandharaj lime,I loved it the most,you just can’t miss it.

In the main, Chicken chanp was properly cooked ,the gravy was rich enough.

The different Sultans of the Delhi Sultanate who ruled various regions of India from Delhi that include the different Turkic and Pashtun (Afghan) Muslim dynasties introduced the use of Tandoor, Kebab, Keema and Naan prior to the Mughal dynasty.

The Keema Naan was tasteful as well as the garlic naan.

Mutton Pudina Pasinda was our choice with the naan,it was spicy and flavoured,but mutton can be better in taste.

We have tried their Subz Pulao cooked with vegetables in dump pukht style.You can have it with Mahi Dumpukht,again the calcutta vetki and the creamy saffron gravy takes it to another level. You know what,in India,Fish, to taste right, must swim three times -- in water, in butter, and in gravy.

The fish was properly cooked and taste was flavorful ,fish lovers must try.

Biriyani of Sultan is a true winner. Extensive use of milk, cream and butter in various gravies and curries makes the dishes even more appetizing with foodies ending up licking their fingers.Sultan is not an exception in this case.Biriyani was truly amazing. The way you cut your meat reflects the way you live,mutton pieces were soft and heavenly taste.Garnishing was wonderful.Truely recommended Biriynai of the city,after all nothing can beat the happiness of having a delicious biriyani.

Burahani is the traditional spicy yogurt drink.It balances the spiciness of the main food as it has ingredients like mint,cumin,yogurt,it will help you in digestion.Must have it at the end.

‘Sultan’ justifies the meaning of it’s name ‘holder of power’.

Sultan , as the name says truly has a very rich style of  dining .
Service is good here and the quality and quantity of food is good too.
Also this place stays open till 2.30 am at night and they offer home delivery service to a wide area even till this late night .You can drop in at this place at midnight if hunger descends upon you all of a sudden ! 

I started off with their starters :-
Firangi kebab
Kasturi kebab
Boti kebab badaami
Fish Tikka gandharaj
Alongside Roohafza lemonade 

Fish Tikka Gandharaj was just ah-mazing and the other kebabs closely follow there after .

In main course -
Chicken chaap
Mutton Biriyani
Mutton pudina pasinda
Mahi Dumpukht 
Subz pulai
Keema naan and Garlic naan .

I couldn't get enough of Mahi Dumpukht it was so yummy , delicately prepared .Biriyani is good too.
The after taste of Keema naan is still with me and as I am already a garlic naan lover I shut the deal here .

Burahni which is a drink I tried for the first time , surprisingly is one of the best digestive liquid I had not tasted in all these years . It's a must try .

Pros- I had truly loved the fish items and the garnishing on top ! Do not forget to try their Biriyani.

Cons- The place is small and the mutton dishes can be worked on for a better experience.The seating  area seems a little congested as well .


I will definitely recommend you to visit this place for the good quality of food .

You walk straight I to the lane of "Jugal's" and to your left is this mughlai restaurant.
Let the small place not bring your expectations down. Because the food is amazing.
We got down straight to business , with boti kebab-badami, fish tikka-gandharaj and firangi kebab.
They were presented well and tasted really tasty.

For main course we settled for keema naan, mutton biriyani, mutton pudina pasinda and mahi dumpukht (fish) .
The fish was extraordinary, and also loved the quality of meat they served.
We ended with burhaani, and it was just what we needed.
Also a quick note, this place stays open till 2:30am on weekdays for both dining and delivery. And sundays till 3 am. I think that is amazing! 
Visit the place asap ✔

It was a very small restaurant,  upto 20 people seating capacity at Max.  Coming to food, 
Food:- We ordered Mahi Gandhraj Tikka ( lemon fish tikka)  with garlic naan.  Fish was awesome and naan was soft n good too.  They gave us a strawberry juice as complimentary drink. Service was slow.  Overall a good place for good food in budget.  ( 3.5/5)

Ok.. So The place is not pretty far from the main road. Outside area is not that subtle but inside of the joint is pretty decent..
They took some time to serve the food but it was ok if u visit with frnds..
Now the food...
Ordered firangi kabab, tandoori roti, murg tikka lababdar and rarra ghosth..
Firangi kabab and lababdar was just outstanding in one word.. These two will really surprise you for sure.. The mood was set high from the first 2 dishes but the rarra ghosth just ruined it.. The mutton was very tender but it had that bad smell of mutton that really wasn't good. Also the mutton pieces were very small and inside of it is cold like it was not properly microwaved.. ;) .. I will recommend only try chicken there not mutton.
One more thing the price shows here approx 550 for two its not that. A little high like 700-750 for two men.. All over a so so experience.

Horrible to say the least... We ordered for home delivery as we had couple of guests coming over after going through manipulated good reviews through known people.. But kindly don't fall into this trap.. Food is just shit & wack.. They just don't know how to prepare Indian food.. We ordered for Galawati Kabab, Mahi Ajwain for starters & Garlic naan, butter naan, laccha parata, dal dumphakt (dal makhani), chicken lababdar & Dum ka gosht . Everything was horrible & at the end u would feel ur hard earned money has been snatched by a fraud Sultan. Now coming to the food : Galawati Kabab - dry Mahi ajwain - no flavour of ajwain and had many bones. Garlic Naan - it's a 10inch rubber with sliced garlic pasted on it. Just they have no idea what a naan is .. Laccha Parata - seemed like a thick Bengali attar roti Dal Dumphakt - they have no idea bout the difference between dal makhani & dal tadka. They feel if I drop a bit of cream and butter on top it becomes a tasty dal makhani but unfortunately it's not the case. Trust me a dal tadka from any of the late night dhabas tastes thousands time better than this shit. Chicken lababdar - so much of red food colour that ur hands were getting coloured. Tangy horrible taste . And to beat it all - Dum ka Ghost- supposed to be a delightful dish in white gravy with less spice. But unfortunately it tasted like Mutton Kheer malai.. as if I am having s sweetdish with unimpressive mutton pieces.. Sums it all. Pls don't waste ur lunch/dinner & ur money in this so called Sultan.. Hope this kind of restaurants shuts down soon.

Lately, I have developed an additional affection for Biryani. So, while it rained that day, I hopped to this place for a Biryani dinner. This place is approachable from several points, near to desapriya park, but if you are going through lake road then you can take the turn beside dugout. The place is small, with 3-4 tables stacked closely. 
We ordered for a Chicken Biryani and a mutton side dish- dum ka gosth. The serving person was very humble, perhaps a little nervous type. Food was served hot in some time, and just then while I took a bite of my Biryani aloo, I understood it was kind of rotten. The staff soon changed the aloo and the new one also was similar in taste so I left it. The Biryani otherwise was tasty. However, I just have a different emotion for that aloo in Biryani. The side dish was good in taste too. 
Price is reasonable and worth visiting. I would like to revisit to taste the kebabs.

This is a very small joint with sparse accomodation. However the interior is neat and clean. We ordered Burahni, rooh afza lemonade, tengri mumtaz, firangi kebab, goshth biryani ,rarra goshth and shahi tukra. Burahni and the lemonade was somewhat good. Tengri mumtaz is chicken tengri kebab with rich mutton stuffing. Taste was okay but they used excessive salt which dominated our taste buds . The kebab and biryani was just average again with much salt. Shahi tukra was okay. They do not accept cards.

So I visited Sultan yesterday with some friends. It's a small eatery tucked away in Lake View Road. The restaurant is cramped with accomodation only for around 15 people, I think that is the only problem with this place. Welcome drinks were on the house, and they were perfectly suited to beat the summer heat. We ordered firangi kabab, chicken biriyani and gosht biriyani. The firangi kabab and mutton biriyani were delicious, especially the tenderness of the mutton piece is worth mentioning. I didn't like the chicken biriyani much. I'd say it was just average. They served us a lip-smacking chutney along with the kabab and raita with the biriyani. The staff were extremely courteous and taking care of each and everything. I'd say this place has a long way to go if they can expand to a larger space.

So this was 1st June when I visited here with my friends... And it was my birthday so after a lot of search in Zomato I selected this one seeing such
ratings.
Now, when we visited the place there was a power cut and it was too hot but they told us they will manage it with some backup and they actually did...it was not that uncomfortable though. First of all it's a very small place...can accommodate max 15 ppl but place is nice,hygienic, clean and the decors are ok
Now come to the food...we ordered 2 plates of chicken biriyani,1 firangi kebab and 1 chicken tikka lababadar. There was an offer going 'beat the heat' for which they offer complimentary drinks and we got jalzeera drink.
1. Chicken biriyani was a bit spicy but tasted very good also coz I like extra spices and both pieces of chicken were very nicely cooked and they serve it with raita which tastes even better
2. Firangi kebab is their speciality...kebabs soaked in thick cream tasted very nice specially with the dip they served
3. Chicken tikka lababdar was the star of the table...it just stole my heart and if I had a little bit place in my tummy I'd have ordered one more...it had the best proportion of flavours and tasted really nice with biriyani
Staffs here are very polite and they keep asking you if u need something and also they ask you how is the food every time they serve something and listen to suggestions carefully also what I can't forget to write is the bill. It was so pocket friendly... All of these cost only 750 so I'd love to visit here again and again

Visited 4times . Last time this month.. i was utterly disappointed. I regreted why I came here. Biryani was a disaster. Even the mutton chaap too. Waste of money waste of time.. waste of our taste buds too. This is the problem with small restaurants.. they can't keep their consistency. I had been there more three times earlier. It was good. Value for money. It was really good. I gave 4.5 rating. With that expectations I went there again..with a new friend. He ended up abusing me and questioning my tastebuds.. for bringing him to the restaurants.
Quantity was also very very less. I guess it was their left over biriyani. It was half of the quantity of what they regularly served earlier. We say some home delivery orders came. I guess they delivered all there. We had white rice mostly. Tiny.. a piece of mutton. Total..bone.. I only sucked the juice of the mutton bones. Mutton chaap was a kind of weird dish.. as I ever ate. One piece of mutton. With lots of onion fries which were burnt..and oils.. absolutely no taste. We left the food. It was like we can't eat it anymore. We went for dinner. Spent 700bucks. Then ate again after returning home. And found my mother's home cooked meal is far far better than those white rice.. bone of mutton and burnt onion. We were empty stomach almost.
We ordered
Some Chicken kebab
Mutton biryani
Nuns
And that so called mutton chaap
We ordered butter nun.. it came dry. Not a single pinch of butter. Not even the smell. They told us that butter nun is not in the menu card. Only the plain nun. But they can prepare butter nun if we order it. But they didn't.
No raita with biriyani. As they used to serve earlier..
Kebabs? O they were dry... Tight.. not at all soft. They were Hard and cold from inside.
We bites them took the juices and threw the hard fibres.

I still feel like to demand my 700bucks.. and go to some good mughlai restaurant and at least have some good biriyani.
But I don't even want to be there even in my dreams.

To the owner,
I loved your restaurant..
I had been there 3times earlier.
I rated you 4.5
Your restaurant was among my top lists in budget friendly and quality food restaurants.
I hope you can check my earlier review.
Now I hate your restaurant.
I don't want to come here again
I will suggest people to not to come here again.
For those who are coming to your restaurant.. and will come... Please serve some quality food. And please keep your consistency.
What you did to us .. may not harm you money. Because you already earned the money by treachery.
But you made your restaurant's fan.. your Hater..

I was hurt. I promise I will not spend a pie of my hard earned money on your restaurant. Never.
Bye. Thank you.

Ordered Mutton Biriyani online when i saw a 4.0 rating
But the food was not up to the mark
The Biriyani was too oily and the Mutton was not well cooked.

This is a tiny eatery located at Lake View Road, but do not go by the size cause their menu and the food they dish out are big enough to take on the lions in the hotel industry. Ordered the Firangi Kabab... This was an excellent rendition of the age old kabab... consisting of tender pieces of chicken kebab coated with cheese sauce. Next were the Mutton and Chicken Biryani, which were done pretty well... Both had healthy pieces of mutton and chicken, cooked soft to perfection.Also on the order list was Nalli Nehari and Murgh Tikka Lababdar. The dishes were good to taste, the one common drawback being that both were a bit too oily for my liking. Overall... a nice dining experience, one that left us craving for more.

Having good is, by far, important. But, having an on board humble staff is  a  bliss.

Home delivered food. Was promised a delivery time of 60 mins, and the promise was kept. 
The food -

1. Garlic Naan - Soft beautiful naan breads (Goes to show the effort put into kneading the dough and the time the dough was kept in the freezer for the cold fermentation process)

2. Rara Ghost - So much of good quality mutton on a plate (Was asked to buy this dish by the staff while over the phone and was worth every penny.  Good size mutton pieces with minced mutton)

3. Tandoori Chooza - Just Buy it (Says its 6 week marinated chicken. Didn't believe at first, but the taste and the tenderness of the chicken beats the best Tandoori chicken I have tasted back in Mysore.)

Overall, a big thumbs up. PS- To the quantity and the quality of each dish, the menu is well priced. Would definitely call for an order again.

Had our lunch at Sultan. Nice place small seating area 3 tables only. The food was really nice... very testy and lite. 
We had murgh malai kabab, zafrani pulao and chicken tikka lababdar... all 3 tested great.
Also took special mutton biriyani as parcel which was also lovely (less spicy less salt lite).
People working there are very polite they served us refreshments as complementary..which we loved the most to beat the heat :D 
Overall very good experience. Loved their quality of food at affordable prices.

Sultan is a small reastaurant and serves pure mughlai food. The decor is good and the ambience is usual. Coming to the food we had Chicken Firangi Kebab which is a special dish there, it tasted good and the cheese sauce was new to me with kebab. In the main coursr we had Masala Kulcha, Chicken Tikka Lababdar and Mutton Biryani. Kulcha was soft and tasty, Chicken Tikka Lababdar was delicious and the Mutton Biryani was good,mutton was well cooked and I was happy to see that it came with an egg which is very rare now in other restaurants. They also gave us complimentary drinks as an o@ffer was going on. Staffs are well behaved, service is quick. Price is very reasonable and compared to that quantity is impressive. As the cherry on the cake, it is a tax free food joint! Overall it was a nice experience.

Ordered at 8.35 . Food got delivered at 10.45. I had ordered for firangi chicken kabab , chicken lababdar, nan and rumali roti. They called at 10.10 to say that chicken had gone bad so they were replacing the dishes with mutton. I had no other choice but to agree as it was quite late. They ended up providing one mutton in white gravy which was completely bland , some mutton kabab which had absolutely no salt , nan that was burnt and rumali roti that was undercooked. As I type this review most of the food is going to the bin.What a terrible experience that too on mother's day ..

Also they served a complementary drink, which was much needed in the summer.

This restaurant is nice for a meal which you want delivered right to your doorstep.
The restaurant however, messed up with the order when they sent 3 plates of Biryani instead of a chicken gravy dish. They also made us wait two hours for the order to be completed.
We had Mutton Biryani, Chicken Biryani and Badami Murgh.
The biryani was extremely tasty and the chicken dish was brilliant with the soft chicken pieces and the nutty Badaam adding a beautiful blend of textures.
The added 10% discount on Zomatoand the fact that their dishes are cheaper than the leading biryani makers like Arsalan, are also an incentive.

Now, coming to the food we ordered 1 murgh biriyani ,1 ghosht biriyani and 1 subzi biriyani.
The quantity is sufficient enough for 1 person who eats well and 2 people who eat somewhat well .The biriyanis were amazing in taste .It was flavourful ,aromatic ,the rice was like melt in the mouth..the chicken and mutton both were extremely soft ,well flavoured and heavenly .I am satisfied after a long time with my biriyani .Thank you Sultan .Keep up the good work

Placed order for delivery through zomato at around 9:20 pm which promptly gets confirmed by the restaurant and estimated delivery time displayed is 11:02pm which is acceptable considering the rush due to poila boisakh...it's way past the delivery time and there is no single update from the restaurant which is not picking any calls....got in touch with zomato and got informed that restaurant is not picking their calls either....I don't know who is at fault here but would definitely want explaination for the harassment.... order nbr 21927698...it is still showing status as confirmed and not yet delivered!!!!

Located in a lane opposite to priya cinema hall this is a small joint. The ambience is okayish trying to give a hint of the nawabi feel. We ordered gosht biriyani murgh biriyani and chicken lababdar with which we were offered a complementary raita. The biriyani was different in taste , not very usual as we find everywhere , the mutton piece was tender , juicy with a big piece of aloo. I personally did not like the biriyani very much. And the side dish chicken lababdar was recommended but I dint like the taste of the gravy much . Service was good though and very pocket friendly.

Such a bad experience. I went to this place along with my mum after reading so many good reviews on zomato. But alas! Goshth biryani was pathetic. We waste half of the quantity. Roadside biryani is far better than this. I dont know why it was tasteless and full of spices. Firangi kebab was ok ok type. Not finger licking good.

Went there with high expectations but was only left wth disappointment. It is a small restaurant near deshapriyo park.. we order for masala kulcha, butter nan and rarrha ghost( as suggested by the waitr) .. the nan and kulcha was soft and nice.. now the rarrha ghost.. 4 pieces of bone without any meat literally.. the gravy was not good.. when we complain about the meat to the waitr, he was lyk "mutton e toh bone thakbei". OK I understand we didnt ask for boneless mutton nd yes mutton e toh bone thakbei..
BUT " only bone without any meat is not expected".. out of min 2 piece could have been better... but NOOO... ONLY BONE.. it spoil our entire mood to have food.. I went thr with my mother n i am upset to choose dis restaurant nd couldnt mk my mother happy with the food..

What a gem of place this is. Absolutely an amazing spot in by lanes of southern avenue. Today i had the oppurtunity of visiting this place for a small lunch with my pals. Its better to follow the google maps in case you are not familiar with the area. This place is nearby paranthe wali gali.

The dining area is small with just 3 tables of 4 seats each. The kitchen is adjacent to the dining place. We took our seats quickly due to the heat outside. After going through long menu we ordered the following:-

1. Firangi kebabs - One might be curious with its name but that is due to a simple reason i.e. addition of melted cheese over the kebabs with additional cheese dip. 6 pcs of succulent kebabs were served coated with melting cheese,cheese dip & shredded salad. The kebabs were simply wow. This certainly lives up as sultan's special kebab dish. Recommended.

2. Kasturi kebab - A rather different presentation from the firangi kebab. Again 6pcs of succulent kebabs with a egg coating over the kebab. The chicken kebabs weren't different in taste but still made our tastebuds happy. Pudina chutney was provided with this dish which was fresh & tasty. The egg coating deserves a special mention.

3. Keema naan - An unique naan which one might not find in every restaurants providing north indian cuisine. Naans were flaky & soft with generous amounts of keema stuffed in between. 1 single piece of naan was divided into 4 pizza like slices which would suffice a single person.

4. Gosht biriyani - Huge quantity of spicy biriyani was served with 2 pcs of mutton, potato & egg. The use of basmati rice gave an aromatic unique taste to it. A plate of biriyani would easily suffice 2 average eater. Half bowl of raita was served as well which was well prepared. Recommended.

5. Murgh tikka lababdar - This was the star of our menu. 6pcs of boneless chicken cooked in non spicy gravy. The gravy was a great condiment with our naan & biriyani. We enjoyed every spoonful of that gravy. It was just yum.

The service was good considering there was a lone service boy. The cost was on the minimal side with the cost around 300 per head. They dont charge additional taxes. They don't accept cards but cash & paytm mode is available for payments.

After hearing a lot went to this place to have biriyani with my biker friends, and apart from the love for our iron machine another common love between us is Biriyani. This was a reiki visit as only three of us were present so first we order their Special Cheese Kebab, soft marinated chicken kebab dipped in cheese sauce  and it was awsome, but the big disappointment came with the biriyani, and specially from a place which features among the Biriyani collection in Zomato, it was bad, there was no aroma of the spices , the mutton had a distinct smell of the cream, but the quantity was good, two plates were more than enough for three of us. Visit the place for other dishes but not biriyani

In the by lanes of lake road this small restaurant is located, I visited there today with a friend after reading the rave reviews on Zomato. I was really hungry so ordered for one chicken biryani, mutton biryani and one hariyarli Mahi kebab. The food tasted just about average, I felt this restaurant to be a bit over hyped. My chicken biryani had complete essence of mutton which I disliked, the pieces of bhetki in the kebab was clearly not fresh had a weird smell. But the kebab was very tender and perfectly marinated, the quantity of biryani is also huge! I liked the servers attitude, though service was very slow. This place can hardly cater 12 to 15 people at a time, the interiors are clean nothing else is great about it. A reasonable place for biryani and kebabs is all this place has to offer!

We tried this restaurant after reading such high rated reviews on zomato but it didn't turn that well for us.
We took away our food so can't comment on their decor and ambience.
We ordered chicken firngi kebab, mahi ajwani kebab, gosht biriyani, chicken badami and one butter naan. 
Chicken firngi kebab was served with a cheese dip and it was really awesome in taste.
Mahi ajwani kebab was also good.
Chicken badami was a okayish dish. I felt it was a little bit more salty.
Now coming to the gosht biriyani. It was our biggest disappointment. The mutton was not succulent enough. Taste wise also it was not that pure or hevenly. basically far away from a perfect awadhi biriyani.
Overall expected a lot from this eatery but found it so so.

Sultan transcends a unique concoction of Awadhi cuisine into a sheer brilliance. Located very nearby Ballygunj Cultural Durga Puja venue on Lake Road, it is a small joint, with 3-4 tables. But the food they serve is bigger in taste and uniqueness. I ordered a zaffrani pulav, chicken chaanp and masala cold drink. The zaffrani pulav was absolutely amazing and the chicken chaanp was just finger licking delicious. The masala cold drink was refreshing enough to have a second order. My experience here at Sultan was great and I recommend it to all Food lovers.

Do you find yourself ordering Reshmi kababs and chicken butter masala every time you visit an Awadhi or North Indian restaurant? If yes, then sultan is here to change just that. Located in Deshapriya park with minimum glam and dećor the restaurant has a small seating area. But let that not fool you because their menu is full delicious food items. 

For starters I ordered...
Firangi kebab: it is served with cheese sauce and onions on the side. It's a creamy preparation and the kebabs are very soft.

Murgh Malai tikka: similar to firangi kebab they serve it with a creamy sauce as well as onions. It was well prepared.

Kastoori kebab: the kebabs are tucked under a light egg blanket and served with pudina chutney. This is the creamiest when compared to the other two and melts in your mouth. Do give this a try!

For main course...
Murgh Badami: the look of it will increase your hunger pangs. It has such a pretty colour and is garnished with sliced almonds. The chicken pieces will absolutely melt in your mouth. Perfect for people who don't eat spicy food, it's creamy and not at all piquant. Yummy!

Zaffrani pulao: yellow and pretty, garnished with strands of saffron. Smells and tastes delicious. Each grain of rice is separated and the quantity is sufficient for two. 

Naan: these cloud like naans amazingly soft and fluffy tasted even better with the side dishes. The only disappointment being that it gave slightly a bitter aftertaste when eaten by itself.

Chicken Biryani: the spices were perfectly balanced. Nothing was too overpowering. They served it with two pieces of chicken, one hard boiled egg and half a piece of potato. 
 
From their drinks menu which is very limited, I had ordered daab shikanji which was a disappointment since the spices in the drink were too overpowering and the taste of the shikanji was somewhere lost. 

Service is not so good. The waiters are a little clueless about the order. But maybe they are used to takeaways. 

If you love such cuisines and you need more variety do give this place a try, it's quite easy on the pocket too. Enjoy!

I would have been happy if zomato would have given an option for chosing 0 point rating... i have been to this resto 3 to 4 times... initially i had given a rating of 4.5 n that was nearly a yr back but now after being to this place for the last two times, i am feeling bad that y did i atall on this platform post such good reviews... u guys know what? They serve rotten chicken n mutton preparations... this did not happen only once but it happened twice and everytime they replace it and again they given those same rotten stuff... out of 6 pieces they serve 2 or 3 rotten pieces... thats disgusting... this happened during the chaturthi day of durga puja too..when we protested they simply said "aap ke wajah se mera customers choot raha hai" ..this is the attitude of the resto manager... everyone turned out from the resto after eating such grave food... hope one fine day the food dept raids this shop n gets this place locked forever... utterly disgusting... thumbs down !

Awadhi cuisine is such a gastronomic experience which can easily take away your plan to have diet food and become slim and trim. Awadhi and Mughlai food here at Sultan, comprise refined, delicately flavoured dishes created with royal touch, influenced by Indian, Central Asian and Middle Eastern flavours. Intricate, very skilfully made kebabs are a speciality of Sultan, along with biryanis and kormas. There’s plentiful use of cream, nuts, saffron and aromatic spices. Aromas from the fresh tandoor envelope us as we approach the stretch. The kitchen beside dining area sporting shiny kebab skewers. Cuisine from Awadh isn’t unknown to many. It comes with a legacy from the Nawabs and the kings. With heavy influences from the Mughal cooking techniques such as dum, Awadh cuisine bears striking similarities to those of Persia, Kashmir, Punjab and Hyderabad. It’s essence lies in its richness with liberal use of exotic spices including saffron and sandalwood. We started off with a cool refreshment, followed with starters and staples that catered to both the vegetarian and non-vegetarian taste buds. Co-founder Mr. Sudipto Karmakar walked us through an array of dishes on the menu they had to offer at our bloggers meet for the evening.

Yesterday i visited this place for the first time on the recommendation of a friend of mine. The place is very small. There are only 3tables  and seating is available for only 12 people. Coming to food we ordered Boti Badami Kebab, Firangi kebab and Mutton Biryani. Both the keabas were brilliant. They were soft and succulent. It just melts in your mouth. The Biryani  was good but nothing extraordinary. They also serve complementary Raitas  with the Biryani. If You visit this place Do try their Badami and Firangi kebab. Prices are moderate and they dont charge any taxes. Indeed a memorable experience for us and will surely visit this place again.

Had heard a lot about this place finally decided to opt for some home delivery . We ordered 
Chicken lababdar tikka 
Chicken biryani
Veg puloa
Paneer kofta
Mushroom masala 
Masala kulcha

All the items were excellent .. chicken pieces just melted in the mouth.. the only negative I found was that the options for vegetarians are limited and the veg pulao didn't was slightly on the sweeter side was expecting some masala in it ..

The name suggests the place serves "Awadh" like food. I had the mutton biryani and I would say it's pretty different from the Kolkata style. I can call it more lucknowi since it was "ghee" ladened but missed out few of the spices that makes a proper lucknowi biryani. The quantity of the rice and the texture of the meat was decent. It was far from a dry taste. I will definitely come back to try out their signature dishes.
I would recommend it to my friends and peers who wants to experiment from the banal Kolkata style biryani if it actually can be banal.

We ordered Tangri Mumtaz as starter, chicken tagri stuffed with cheese &  mince meat, soft succulent as a tangri should be.
Then we had Rarra Ghosth with butter nan.a regal experience i must say..stepped mutton cooked with perfection.
Pinch on pocket for two approx 500/-
& best thing no extra added taxes.

Ordered from here via Zomato in search of perfect Biryani. The Biryani wasn't outstanding, it was too oily. We had ordered their recommended dish, chicken afghani tikka which was very tasty. Creamy, spicy and the chicken was melt-in-mouth. We had also ordered chicken lababdaar which was 2 pieces chicken keema stuffed in chicken leg. Not as good as expected. The flavours of the 2 didn't blend well and the chicken leg wasn't flavourfully marinated.
Pricing was quite good. 

Overall affordable average mughlai cuisine.

Newly added in Hidden Gem, so I was quite interested to visit this highly rated restaurant.

Very easy to locate on Lake View Road.
Interior is decorated with mughal wallpapers.

Very reasonable pricing for all the items.
We ordered their speciality Firangi Kebab, Mahi Gondhoraj, Kasturi Kebab, Chicken Lababdar Tikka, Chicken and Mutton Biriyani, Butter Nan & Keema Nan

Firangi Kebab is little innovative but not so special in taste.
We ask them to suggest any fish kebab. They suggested Mahi Gondhoraj but unfortunately that was raw from inside. Flavour of Lemon also missing. We have to return it due to raw fish.
Though they are repeatedly offering to prepare it freshly. But we are not ok to try again their fishy innovation. They didn't charge for the fish.

Chicken Lababdar was sooo good. Probably one of the best. soft chicken inside of awesome thick gravy.

Interestingly they don't charge any tax.
So it was cheap for our pocket.

I went again, this time experience was better. They improved a lot.in all aspects..Food, service became good. I specially want to mention about Chicken Lababdar and Keema Nan.. seriously considering Lababdar is iconic here..Best in town. 

I took kastoori kebab and mahi gandharaj as parcel. My brother loved it, so I am.

I would love to go there again, to try something new variety very soon. I will recommend my known people, just to have q visit to this nice place.

As the name suggests, this restaurant serves Awadhi food items. It was a dinner invitation through Paanch Phoron group.

It's a very small outlet located near Jugal's, at lake view road. It can hardly accommodate 7-8 people. It may better be considered as a take-away joint.

The items we were served that day -->

Roohafza - A refreshing cool sarbat helped us to get energized though I found it a bit high on sugar.

The starters -
1. Achari Paneer Tikka - Soft paneer cubes mixed with spicy pickles having a sour flavor and tasted good. It was served with green pudina chutniand salad.

2. Murgh Tulsi Tikka - Chicken pieces seasoned with curd, spices and paste of basil leaves. It tasted great and was garnished beautifully.

3. Firangi Kebab - Soft and delicious chicken kebabs. The kebabs were topped with mayonnaise and served with white dip and salad.

4. Galawat Kebab - Originated at Lucknow, a nawab special kebab. Minced mutton mixed with spices and then cooked. As the name says, this kebab is so soft and tender that it melts in my mouth. Succulent kebab was served with small paratha, pudina chutney and salad.

Now the main course -
1. Garlic naan / Plain naan - Indian bread soft and went well with all the gravy.

2. Sabz Miloni - Mixed vegetables with spinach cooked with minimum spice and the flavour comes from fresh vegetables. It was served with fresh cream on top of it.

3. Murgh Badami - Chicken pieces cooked with thick almond paste, yoghurt and spices. It was scrumptious.

4. Goshth Biriyani with Raita - Mutton biriyani served with egg and potato. It was light, well balanced on spices and less oily. It tasted amazing with plain raita.

5. Murgh chaap - Chicken pieces perfectly blended with spices and tasted great with biriyani. Though chicken was slightly stiff but flavour was amazing.

In dessert we had Shahi Tukra - A royal mughlai dessert prepared from crispy toast and rabri with saffron. It was well balanced on sweetness and delectable.

Overall it was a very nice experience. I enjoyed all the items thoroughly.

Location – It is located near Desapriya Park, Lake view road , 3 min walking Distance from Jugals sweet shop .

Space- relatively small spaced with seating arrangements of about 12 people. 

Ambience & decor – its so so , with some awkward paintings !!! I dont know that what is the propose of that crueal Mughalian pictures in a restaurant!!! Because its a restaurant not a History Class !! It can hurt somone if he/she is a religious person . 


1) Roohafja Lemonade –

Review-  indowestern flavour  , fusion of Roohafja and fresh lime soda !! It was good .

2) Starters – 

Murgh Tulsi  Tikka

Review-  they used Tulsi ( Indian Basil ) leaves for marinate the Chicken . It was properly Coocked,  Smokey  and tender with balanced  spices. It was delicious!! Highly recommended!!

Firangi Kebab

Review-  its taste like Chicken  reshmi kebab but its sereved with bones. It was juicy & soft ! Taste good .

Galwat Kebab

Review-  authentic Galwat kebab. It was good  But i think its not the best !!

Achari Paneer Tikka

Review -  soft, succulent, flavourful  and well cooked.  Cottage cheese marinated with some spicy indian pickle flavour!!

3) Main Course – 

Garlic Naan 

Review - It was well made and soft authentic Indian Bread . 

Sabz Miloni – 

Review - a mixed veg dish , which had a thick gravy was a treat to the tastebuds, and went very well with the naan served . Its a mix veg served with a Indian twist! 

Murgh Badam – 

Review- here is the  superstar , which was terrific, a nutty creamy gravy along with tender shredded chicken was absolutely mouthwatering . Boneless chicken served with a royal indian curry which made with creame , almond & some Scrate indian spices!! Yummy..   Highly recommended !!!

Gosht Biriyani –

Review- kolkata style biriyani with potato  & mutton!! it was well cooked, aromatic with tender meat pieces, only flaw I found was that the boiled potato was salty.

  Review - again a hot item, beautifully cooked with very yummy gravy and succulent meat .

Raita –

 Review- Indian souce,  made with curd and chopped Veggies .

Raita was well made and was nice.

Aroma of Awadh @ Sultan..!

The richness of Mughlai cuisine lies in the variety and aroma of  spices like cardamom and Saffron to name few. The Bawarchis (Chefs) and Rakabdars (gourmet cooks) of Awadh gave birth to dum pukht which is the art of cooking over a slow fire and that’s how the taste persists on our taste buds for a prolonged period.

A new addition to the food map of Kolkata in the Mughlai delicacy is Sultan. Sultan is an Awadhi or Mughlai cuisine speciality restaurant bringing to you gourmet dishes hand picked delicacies from the land of Sultan (Awadh).

Location : This is located near Deshapriya Park. From Jugal’s walk straight towards Southern Avenue and you can locate on your left hand side.

Decor and Ambience : Despite of the space crunch, the decor is well-defined with Mughal paintings to set up the ambience. A casual dine-in couldn’t have been better than this.

Food: Serves Mughlai delicacies specially curated by chefs to fill in your desire for great food.

Starters-

1. Murgh tulsi tikka – An innovative infusion of boneless chicken pieces marinated with yoghurt and basil leaves is worth the eat.
                                          ...

I have a special attraction for Mughlai cuisine, for this attraction whenever I get some time I try to visit any Mughlai restaurant I found near to me, and day by day this love for mughlai cuisine is increasing. Recently I visited a place near Deshapriya Park, South Kolkata known as Sultan. It was a food tasting event and I with my fellow foodie friends were invited to experience some delicious lip-smacking mughlai dishes. When I got the invitation I was very much excited after all it is a Mughlai restaurant.
Well to be honest the place looks very ordinary ,  also very small, max to max 10-12 seating arrangements, in the front they have the roll counter with the kitchen, the ambiance and decoration was also moderate but the preparation they offer were simply amazing. I must say this place serves really good Awadhi and North Indian foods, better than some famous mughlai restaurant in Kolkata. They served us various types of signature kebabs as well as side dishes, main course and desserts. Every dish we tried absolutely delicious. At first we were welcomed with Roohafza Lemonade, which was delicious and very much refreshing and after we tried various dishes as follows;
Mouth watering Kebabs:

Murgh Tulsi Tikka –Boneless chicken pieces marinated with different spices, yogurt and basil leaves then grilled to the perfection. Chicken was nicely cooked, very soft and juicy. The color was greenish and smoky flavor makes it a perfect starter.

Firangi Kebab –
Sultan’s special signature kebabs.Boneless chicken pieces marinated with spices and grilled with perfection and served with cream cheese sauce. One of the best kebabs preparation I ever had. 

Achari Paneer Tikka-
Big cube size pieces of cottage cheese marinated with various spices, pickle, bell paper and onion and grilled perfectly. It was served with salads and coriander dip. Had a delicious tangy flavor. 

Galwati Kebab- 
Galouti kebab is a dish  made of minced goat and green papaya, traditionally used to tenderize the meat. After mixing with herbs and spices, the very finely ground meat is shaped into patties and fried in pure ghee until it is browned and served with small paratha. Like Lucknowi biryani and Kakori kebab, it is a hallmark of Awadhi cuisine. Simply amazing. 

After the starter it was time for Main course and Side Dishes.

Garlic Naan –
 Indian flat bread cooked in clay oven. Had a nice garlic flavor. Perfect with any side dishes. 

Goshth Biryani-
 Basmati rice and potato with various spices and mutton are cooked in ‘dum pukht’ style. Beautifully garnished with egg. The combination of spices gives it a distinct flavour. Superbly delicious. A perfect main course item. 

Murgh Chap-
 Murg Chap is a traditional and a very delicious side dish preparation. Chunk pieces of chicken cooked in a spicy gravy and decorated with fried onions from over the top.Very aromatic and perfect with biryani or paratha or naan. 

Murgh Badami - Chicken marinated with different spices and cooked with thick paste of nuts and also garnished with broken nuts. The yellowish gravy  was very spicy, aromatic and delicious. Chicken pieces were nicely cooked and very soft. 

Sabz Miloni-
Different vegetables mixed with spicy and thick gravy.  Garnished with cream. 

Dessert: 

Shahi Tukra-
 It is a bread pudding dessert of fried bread slices soaked in hot milk with spices, including saffron and cardamon. Garnished with dry fruits and nuts. Very soft , this dessert is a perfect delight for your taste buds. 

I can say this place is a hidden gem for mughlai lovers. Every preparation we tried were cooked very well and were absolutely delicious. We enjoyed the food as well as warm hospitality of Sudipto Karmakar (Owner) very much. If you love mughlai definitely visit this place. You will not regret. Pocket pinch is also very reasonable.
Thanks

This place is a gem indeed...the place is small with simple decor..the staff is courteous..
We ordered Firangi kebab(Sultan's special)was the dish of the day for me..juicy tender marinated well cooked kebab served with malai was just yummy..melts in your mouth..
Garlic nun was good enough.
Next the gosht pudina pasanada..ah well..the mutton was well cooked but the gravy was lacking salt..otherwise it was smooth and creamy..
However as soon as the waiter came for feedback...he was very eager to replace the dish..or atleast the gravy..but we were almost over with the dish..nice gesture indeed..
The cola sikanji was average...
The shahi tukra was perfect..one of the best i have tasted..
The best part..no added tax...economical good food..Sultan is the destination..

One of the best indian food i had in a while is here at SULTAN . The restaurant is small and clean with three tables for four , decent enough for sit and dine in , but our main focus had to be on their servings. We had a CHICKEN FIRANGI KEBAB, this is a must try dish here , the most tender morsels of chicken topped with cheese sauce and served with a cheese dip , a heavenly affair all together.
The sultan special Mahi Hariyali kebab , Butter Naan , Garlic Naan and Chicken Lababdar were superb as well. The pricing wont hurt your pocket. Only con , dessert wasn't available that day.

Unlike the movie Sultan, this is not surely a blockbuster. But the price is pocket friendly and the food quantity is okay. The space is very small and we were the only visitors on the evening of 8.3.2017. 

We, a group of eight people ordered Boti kabab Badami. The starter is delicious and best among the items we ordered. We followed it with Goshth Biriyani, Murgh Biriyani, roomali roti, naan, murgh tikka lababdar, rarra Goshth and Kundan Kaliya.

Gulab Jamun ended our outing. Staffs were humble but the service is really slow. 

Still wondering though why this is in Zomato's collection of Brilliant Biriyanis. Not upto the mark with Biriyanis.

Been there on 4 march 17 for some take away items. Was impressed by the rating in zomato.
I took biryani and chicken lababdar from their menu.

But one word i can tell here for my experience..."disappointing"
Biryani was not at all upto the mark, and chicken kebabs used in lababder was very hard and blunt.
And the kitchen is not at all hygenic.

'Sultan' is located at Lake View Road near Desapriya Park,just beside road of Jugal's sweet shop.I'd visited here with my lover for valentine's day dinner.The manager told us wait for just 10 minutes,but after 45 minutes when I asked how long we'll be waited,then he told us just 5 minutes.we wait more 10 minutes,but then we left away from there,they ruined us our valentine's day.Then the next day we again decided to go there for lunch.Atfirst we ordered 'Cola Sikhanji' for beverages,it was good.Then we ordered 'Chicken  Kastoori Kebab',chicken coated with fried egg,it tastes different.Atlast we ordered  'Gosht Biryani' & 'Chicken Biryani',both are good not excellent.Quantity of biryani was good.Food service was little late.Price is reasonable.

Sultan Restaurant - A good restaurant serving lipsmacking awadhi food. 
=====
Intro: 

I had been to Sultan Restaurant long ago and it was not running well that time. Recently, they have come up again with Awadhi and North Indian Cuisine. I had been there twice with my friends to try their food. 
=====
What i tried:

○ Chicken Roll - The Chicken Roll was good. The Chicken Pieces were well marinated and they had made the roll flaky. I loved it. 

○ Chicken Biriyani - The Biriyani was aromatic and tasted good. The chicken piece was succulent and so was the aloo. 

○ Chicken Makhmali Kebab - I fell in love with this particular kebab. It was super soft and melted in the mouth. 
=====
Pros:

○ Good Food
○ Good Hospitality
○ Reasonably priced
=====
Summary: 

Food Presentation  3.6/5
Food Quantity 3.6/5
Food Quality 3.6/5 
Taste 3.6/5
Ambiance 3.4/5
VFM 3.5/5
=====
Conclusion:

I will be surely coming back to this place as it has recently renovated and has great scope of improvements. They have changed their ambiance too. 
They should have a feedback form too as it's a new restaurant. It will help them in knowing what works and what does not work for them. 
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

The restaurant is located in a good location.If you take the road beside 'Jugal's'near Desapriya Park then you will find this place at your left side.It's a small joint, newly come up with some delicious kebabs and Awadhi cuisine.They provide really mouth watering food,with very reasonable pricing.

We Ordered : Tangri Mumtaz and Mahi Hariyali Tikka.

Tangri Mumtaz was yummy.Two pieces of Chicken drumstick stuffed with minced meat and cheese and cooked in a tandoor.
Mahi Tikka, as the name suggested this was a fish kebab and the Six pieces of fish were marinated in a green spice mix and cooked to perfection. 

They took a bit time to serve the food but the behavior of the staffs were very good.
Overall we had a wonderful experience at Sultan and looking forward to go back and try some main course from the menu soon.....

Located at Desapriya Park, the restaurant Sultan serves delicious north Indian & awadhi dishes. Very small one, can accommodate around 12 people. As we entered it was empty, getting out seats we ordered

1) Dum ka Ghosth: 4 chunks of mutton in a light whitish gravy. Mutton was really very tender & delicious. We loved it. Rating: 4.5/5

2)Naan: Well made, good with that mutton dish. Rating: 4.5/5

3)Zaafrani Pulao: It was good, but the Zaafrani flavour wasn't my personal favourite. Rating: 3.5/4

4)Lababdar Chicken: 4 tender chicken pieces in a red & spicy gravy, heared about this dish & expected it to be delicious. It was good, but I didn't like it that much. Rating: 3/5

Quantity was more than enough for two of us, we were staffed and took the remainings home. The guy serving us was very well behaved & helpful.
The pricing with respect to the quality & quantity of food here is surprising to me. That delicious & meal was of 585 only!
So this one is a great one for awadhi cuisine lovers and I would like to visit it again to try other dishes.

If you’re a biryani and kebab lover in awadhi style then you have to visit this joint.

The Name tells everything,after hearing the name the smell moving all over my nose,the pictures came inside brain and I was very happy,

Few days back I went to a small joint over a food tasting session with my fellow foodie friends.

This place is located in Lake View Road,Desapriyo Park.walking distance from Jugals sweets shop for about 3 minutes.

Around 10-12 people can seat and together at a time.The staff is amicable, welcoming , courteous and makes sure you are well attended to.

This place serves really good Awadhi and North Indian foods.They served us various types of signature kebabs as well as side dishes and main course.

So we start off with it!

Drink : 

Roohafza Lemonade - So we were served with Roohafza Lemonade , Genuine and refreshing taste, nothing less than a thirst quenching drink.

Kebab Platter :

Murgh Tulsi Tikka - Kabab is always my favorite .Came here n didn’t taste kabab no it’s not gonna happen.
Boneless chicken pieces marinated with yogurt and basil leaves. it was grilled very well. Very Very Tasty it was 

Firangi Kebab  - This one is Sultan's special signature dish . Chickens were cutted very well, the grilling portion was good. Soft from the inside the quality was good,the best part quantity it was very good,after that it was given a nice touch with creamy layer. Served with creamy cheese sauce. One of the best kebab I have ever had. 

Galwati Kebab -  This one is lakhnovi nawabi kebab,specially i loved this one.finely minced mutton chopped very well mixed with the ingredients.
 I was mesmerized by the texture as well as by the flavour,they made it very heartly it was melt inside the mouth within a sec,eating with green chutney dip taste went to another level. For the gulawati kebab lovers must try. 

Achari Paneer Tikka - Dice shaped paneer marinated, and attached with bell peppers and onions on a skewer.
 Well grilled and a spicy layer on top, this dish is served along with pickled onions and coriander dip. 
 Soft Paneer and the tangy side-kicks makes it a wonderful combo. 

Main Course & Side Dishes :

Garlic Naan - It was big in size,full of butter all over the naan,flavour was good and they served us normal hot it is good to have with the side dishes.

Sabz Miloni  - good one as a veg preparation,full of flavour mixed with spinach bell pepper carrot beans . The gravy was very thik, 
 All the vegetables boiled and cooked properly. Smell was awesome. 

Murgh Badami  - A different by not that way different,peanut paste used along with the chicken . cooked perfectly it was very soft and flavourful the spices ingredient very well mixed with the gravy,

taste was extremely amazing,you can eat with Nun or with biriyani.Chicken was cooked very well you can easily take out the chicken portion by the help of your finger.

Goshth Biryani - It’s a must try for everyone who loves to eat biriyani. ,the smell whenever served over the table,
 the aroma when hit inside the nose automatically feels like let’s eat. flavorful basmati rice cooked with spices,comes with four portion of mutton. it was delicious,aromatic full of spices,nuts and herbs.  Eating with raita taste was extremely good. 

Murgh Chap - A well-known side-dish, almost prepared in everywhere. Tender chicken pieces marinated and cooked with precisely selected ingredients.
 It's a semi-dry preparation which is slowly cooked to bring out the best taste. As expected, it was a beauty. 

Dessert : They served us one type of signature and famous dessert.

Shahi Tukra - One of their best dessert.after eating too much can’t able to eat anymore.
This dessert complimentary by the restaurant.Made by rice bread pudding with fruits n cardamom powder. Very soft n flavourful n full of dry fruits there. 

Overall it was a very good experience. All the foods they prepared for us good in quality as well as good in quantity,good enough for two people.

I would like to thank to Rajdeep Bhattacharya,Panchphoron , the management , the owner Sudipto Karmakar for inviting us as well as thank to the chef for preparing such a lovely dishes.

heard a lot about this place from zomato . hence visited the place on 1st of march at around 3 pm . the place was completely empty with a small sitting arrangement . no complaints about the ambiance and service . now coming to the food . ordered ghost biriyani which was served with raita, garlic naan and murg tikka lababdar . the food looked delicious and most importantly it tasted great . naan and the side dish were almost perfectly cooked but i have a slight complain about the biriyani. the potato laked salt hence tasted bland . the quantity was huge with good pieces of mutton and an egg . lastly wanted to try their kulfi which was sadly unavailable . will surely go back to try their firangi kebab as well as their zafrani polao which are their most recomended dishes. cheers

One of the finest restaurants I have ever visited (in terms of Food)! Seriously, Sultan, You have the taste and the variety and there is a long way to go!

Positive Points:
1. Food - Just fabulous! The quantity, the quality and the taste, the perfect mixture!
2. Serving time - They served within 15 mins of placing order which is really good!
3. They will make your ordered food in that time and will serve you hot!
4. Waiters behaviour are good and they will make you understand which side dishes goes well with your main course! At least they made us understand!
5. No Tax included in all over bill and Paytm payment accepted.

Negitivity:
1. Space, which they really need to enlarge as soon as possible! they only have 12 seats!
2. Ambience and Decoration, they can make it better in respective of their theme.

Our orders were:
Starter:
1. Sultan's Special Firangi Kebab - It is a must try if you are a kebab lover!
Main Course:
1. Rarra Gosth - I am a mutton lover and the waiter did the job for me choosing the perfect side dish with Masala Kulcha. Specially, the size of the mutton pieces and the quantity will make you happy!
2. Masala Kulcha - Soft and Tasty! Enough big in size to make you full!
All of them costs only 500/-! Isn't that pocket friendly? Give it a try if you are a "North Indian" lover!

Do you have a soft corner for Biryanis and Kebabs ? well i know very well most of the people will answer yes.any kind of biryani i just can’t stop myself from eating. being a hardcore non-vegetarian, i do like veg biryani’s,the aromatic flavour and the succulent taste attract me most of time.few days back i went to a small joint over a food tasting session with my fellow foodie friends.this place is located in Lake View Road,Desapriyo Park.walking distance from Jugals sweets shop for about 3 minutes.around 10-12 people can seat and together at a time.but,this place serves really good Awadhi and North Indian foods.they served us various types of signature kebabs as well as side dishes.Awadhi cuisine is a cuisine native to the city of Lucknow.the cooking patterns of Lucknow are similar to those of Central Asia,Middle East,Northern India with the cuisine comprising both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.the Awadh region has been greatly influenced by Mughal cooking techniques.the Chefs and the gourmet cooks of Awadh invented the dum style of cooking or the art of cooking over a slow flame.the richness of Awadh cuisine lies not only in the variety of cuisine but also the ingredients used like mutton,paneer and rich spices.

Lets start with Services of sultan it has been really good. the person who was serving us.  he was really awesome he didn't got irritate with our installment orders..
We had ordered Firangi kabab as starters.. oi bole na "First Impression Is The Last Impression" the proverb has been proved by the joint. The Pieces  of chicken juicy,soft and succulent . Its like melting in your mouth so easily..
Now in Main course

One of our pieces of kulcha was raw but they changed it then and there,they were also sorry for that their behavior was admirable. Mutton Pieces were too soft and juicy. The Taste is all in of perfect. you will never get disappoint with any of their dishes.
 The briyani was good not overpowering.. Overall taste was perfect

A very small joint to enjoy some north indian dishes, which i found to be lil bit on the oilers side. We went for-
•Murg Malai Tikka: a very succulent kebab which truly melts in your mouth. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
•Murg Biriyani: usual biriyani but served with aloo and egg slightly oily as i felt.
•Masala Kulcha: thick bread stuffed with mashed potatoes and herbs.
•Murg Tikka Lababdar: cubed chicken cooked with too much oil in red gravy.
Accommodation is one of the cons of this place, but their service will greatly satisfy you. The main attraction is the amount they charge, very affordable in that area and items are inclusive of VAT.
P.S. "Food hain tera tasty; tasty hain tera food, Upar kulcha niche firni; beech mein tera vasool" :p

Another visit pending...

Big thing so comes in small packages... This was my instinct  the minute I mounted upon those sumptuous  soft Firangi kebabs.. The melting cream tossed over the roasted meat gave real salvation to my taste buds.. The Dum pukht biriyani blended with the true aroma of 150 spices in murg nihari made my crisp visit to Kolkata  a true bliss..The only thing that I found missing were some classic tunes of royal awadhi heritage..but at the top of all, it's truly an amazing place  when you have a crunching pocket but yet your cravings don't let you eat any simpler food other than Biriyani at Sultan..

This place was in my head for some long, last day couldn't help it any longer and paid a visit there,ordered murgh biriyani, chicken lababdar and laccha parantha, total bill was very cheap and food was tasty as well. This is one small restaurant in Deshapriya Park where they serve some good Awadhi  dishes that too with reasonable price. Must visit.

Sultan is a sure respite.. Amidst the sprawling food streets of Deshapriya Park and Purna Das Road, this is one of those rare places serving authentic and pure Mughlai and Awadhi cuisines instead of going the conventional way of being multi-cuisine.. Probably they are more inclined to be the Master of a single entity rather than being the stereotypical Jack of all cuisines.. Located close to Ballygunge Cultural Durga Pujo location, its easy to locate and sink into some drool-worthy Kebabs and Gravies..

Not much to speak about the ambiance, a small eatery with 4 tables and primarily a take-away joint.. This place is all about the food rather than the eye-catching décor and set-up.. We opted for a take-away since and the major pain point was indeed the service.. They took way longer than the stipulated delivery time they mentioned at the beginning and towards the end we literally had to drive them through our order.. Other than that it was indeed bliss to try out the following:

Boti Kebab Badami: Boneless mutton cubes marinated with almond paste and char-grilled.. Sadly the marination was uneven and to cover it up it seemed, they sprinkled almond on top.. Would have loved to feel the presence of almond more in the Kebab itself..

Mahi Gandharaj Tikka: More of a fusion Kebab where gondhoraj lime infused with fish tikka to plate up a pleasant concoction of tastes.. Mildly spiced and aromatic..

Mutton Kundan Kaliya: Mutton chunks immersed in a golden gravy cooked to perfection.. Loved the creaminess and the rich assortment of spices in the dish..

Rarra Goshth: One of the cornerstone dishes of Awadhi cuisine with the magic of traditional spices.. Mutton chunks in minced mutton gravy, spicy, tangy and adequate heat to get you going..

Murgh Rezala: Quite different and unique in taste from the one we are used to in Kolkata.. This one was way less sweeter, the gravy tasted different with more presence of black pepper and the treatment of yogurt was also unique.. Definitely one of the better dishes served here..

Goshth Biryani: A major disappointment.. Being a hardcore foodie, we Kolkatans are always particular and critical about our Biryani.. Sadly this biryani comes out as a confused entity with no particular alignment to either Kolkata style or Awadhi style biryani.. Also it felt something lacking in terms of flavor and aroma while having it..

Overall, a decent enough experience and surely a winner based on the assortment of dishes they serve.. But definitely they have a long way to go on the basis of taste and surely will see an improved version the next time I visit them.. Good thing was the economical pricing as the total cheque comes to Rs. 1540/- (all incl.) for the food adequate enough to feed 6 people in dinner..

Food: 3.5/5

Pricing: 4/5

Service: 3/5

Ambiance: 2.5/5

This place is just SUPERB!!
Very small cozy little hub with super yummy food and extremely well behaved staff...
My weekend has been so sorted and i literally relaxed while my lunch.
Specially sashi and rajesh thank you so much for the complementory drink and your courteos behavior.
Coming to the food...
Kastoori kebab,murgh tulsi tikka,zafrani pulao,garlic nan,rarra ghosth...each dish is so delicious that it made me literally write my ever first review on zomato.
After a very long time i have had such a balanced flavoured lunch...especially,the zafrani pulao is made with milk and could have just gone wrong anytime but rather it was the show stealer.

You cannot expect such a pocket friendly place without any extra tax and so good quality anywhere else!
Deducting 0.5 only for the space.

Big bang in a small box. Thanks to zomatianswe to help me find this place. one way to the restaurant is the lane beside the Jugals triangular park,another way is the southern avenue road,opposite way to the new garbage station.
 Now coming to the restro,its a small place with good royal type wall art decor. we were the only one in there. We ordered - Firangi kabab- chicken pieces were like melting in my mouth,it was so soft and moist,but the one thing I didn't like that much was the white sauce with it,it was too sweet for our taste.then we had the Masala kulcha-it was bang on,The Best Kulcha I have ever tasted,I am not a nun-roti fan,but I could eat it without any side dishes, it was that good,loved it.Zafrani polao and chicken lababdar-both iteams were so good,polao was full of fragrance and flavour, chicken was good too.we also wanted to try the desert,but it was not available, I read in other reviews, the deserts are not available most of the time,they should look into the matter. Will definitely go there to try other things also.

Well... We have a saying all that glitters is not gold but sumtimes... Sumthing that doesn't glitter can be a gem as well. This suits perfectly with this tiny food joint. No stunning exterior and lavish interior...A small place with only three tables and 12 chairs... Some Mughal pics on d wall... That's it..
But wait till d food arrives on ur plate and changes ur view completely!
I had for d starters d house special firangi kebab and hariyali macchi...Both were good enough to ask for more. For the main course we had Keema nun..Murgh biriyani...Badami murgh... Narghisi kofta... D biriyani was amazing... It was light yet flavorsome and a very balanced taste. Badami murgh is sumthing I tasted afresh. D gravy was a bit on d sweetr side..And almond and nuts were d base of d gravy. I had narghisi kofta after a loooong tym and loved it. To gulp down everything we had cola shikanji..I liked d taste..its kinda jaljeera made with coke.
The stuffs were very courteous and attentive,service was a little slow but no complaints on that. Am just deducting 1 mark cause dey could not provide d shahi tookra that we asked for...Guys plz look into this matter,cause I think desert is a thing no restaurant shud ever go run out of unless it's in a very high demand . I hope it would have tasted just as good as the other dishes
All of these food with a whooping 1200 rs.for 2.
Enuf said..I think everyone should hop in atlwast once to this hidden gem. I'm definitely gonna come back very soon.cheers! :D

Finding the outlet was easy, its just beside the road. The number of table is 3, though I had rung them earlier for a table of 2. Parallel to the dining space is kitchen and one sees the kebabs to his/her delight. The wall has beautiful paintings of medieval scenes. Coming to food, we started with Firangi kebab and Tandoori Chooza. The kebab was good but the chooza it was just melting in mouth, absolutely loved it. Then we ordered for Zafrani pulao, Chicken Tikka Lababdar and Keema Naan. These were all recommended dishes by expert of Desapriya Park and they justified why they are experts. The dishes were fabulous. Still after such a voracious appetite we could just create an amount of 725. To utter dismay, the non-availability of dessert problem was still existent and the management of the outlet must address this. In a nutshell, the experience was outstanding adding a vibrant lunch with my valentine

On seeing this being featured in Brilliant Biryanis, I desperately wanted to try out this pocket friendly restaurant located in Lake View Road just few metres away from the Jugals Sweet Shop. Locational advantage is okay. The outlet is a small food joint with a small Dine-In Facility available with Limited Seats and perhaps that's why they do pre bookings. Interiors are nothing special or innovative but to an extent looks quite eye catching. The Base Kitchen is just beside the main door of the restaurant and the billing counter is a small table just on the opposite side. Eventually I was given their Menu Card which was surprisingly having quite a variety of Items that were quite interesting. Proper description was given with the individual items and I was keen to try out their Biryani with a side dish. The Staff Behaviour was Quite Cooperative and Humble to be honest. The Main Coordinator and the Owner of the Shop Mrs. Suchitra Pattanayak personally guides and looks after the chefs and the staffs in the Base Kitchen. I ordered Gosht Biryani along with an Unique Side Dish of Fish item named Mahi Sultani. It was the first time I would trying out an unique combination of Biryani with Fish as a side dish. I even ordered Onion Salad with these items. Bill Amount was feasible as they don't charge extra Taxes on the bill. The Food was packed with proper garnishment before sealing which was something Innovative I saw till date to be frank enough. It was properly packed in a container and was given to me within 20 minutes from the order. Quite late but still manageable. Coming to the Main Point of my post now, as I got back home.. I was hungry to serve it soon I got freshed. The Quantity of Biryani that they gave was honestly more than expected along with one boiled Egg which is rare in Normal Biryani nowadays. The Aloo piece was a Huge One with spices wrapped up all around. The Thing which I surprised me was the garnishment of Onion Sprinklers on top in the Biryani but to be honest, I didn't smell any Essence of Biryani as the Biryani has to have a sweet essence which is it's particularity. Owing to the quantity, I was quite disappointed with the Taste of their Biryani because of quite a few notable reasons. Firstly, The Biryani tasted Bitter as it was over spicy that made it tasted bitter. Secondly, The Biryani was quite saltless as it tasted somewhat awkward but okay. I felt like I am an high-pressure patient eating saltless food. Thirdly the Mutton needed to be much more tender and cooked. Rice was fine but the Aloo also needed to be a bit more cooked. This made me give them the rating downwards because expectation of the Biryani was not at all upto the mark. The Side Dish that I took was much better with the gravy being quite interesting along with the big pieces of the boneless fish (Vetki) that was Something rather delicious to taste. The salad was interestingly sprinkled coriander leaves with Chaat masala to have added better taste but was quite irritated to find that amount of onions was less. I told them to serve actually Onion Salad with only few pieces of cucumber. They just did the opposite. Anyway, featuring this Restaurant in the Brilliant Biryanis in Zomato isn't a problem but they need to honestly change their Biryani style or else the Calcutta Biryani Freaks like Me will surely get disappointed with the Taste as my Expectation from this Restaurant was not upto the mark owing to the rating given in Zomato. Overall a dissatisfying experience but hope to see them improving their taste in future as I may plan to visit again to try out some other dishes from this Restaurant..!!

Perfect 5 stars for the quantity and quality of food. Truth be told, this restaurant is FAR FAR BETTER and pocket-friendly than Oudh 1590. A person may find the interior and decor a bit shabby (the restaurant do has some major space crunches too) but the wait for getting inside the restaurant is worth it. The hospitality and behavior of the staff is very very pleasant and polite. The food is simply mindblowing, super tasty and it leaves a long lasting good taste in your tongue.

This restaurant doesn't charge any tax or extra hidden charges. And the food dishes are very very reasonable.

A small food joint which is a real hidden gems.Decor of this place is decent.Not a place which will accomodate large number of groups.
Now coming to the food part I had zafrani polao and murg badami.The aura and flavour of polao was just awesome.The gravy of murg badami was thick and super tasty.
Service was quick.Staffs are very cooperative and friendly.
A very affordable price for the food and excellent quality of food makes this place a must try for lovers of mughlai cuisine.

Tried chicken lababdar, zafrani pulao and a creamy kebab, all were just perfect!!! You have to come here if you want awadhi food and that too balue for money. So what are you waiting for??? Come!!

Sultan is one of the best and very affordable place in Southern Avenue. I went here with few of my friends and I was surprised seeing their quality.
We went for lunch and here are the things we tried.
Firangi Kabab as starter. This was brilliant. The chicken pieces were so soft and juicy.
Keema Naan was basically Naan with mutton keema stuffed inside. This was something new to me and I liked it.
Murgh Badami : Chicken with yellow gravy with badams spreaded above. Very good in taste.
Zafrani Polao : Excellent to eat at just Rs.90. The Zafrani gave out beautiful flavors of Mughal Era rice dish.
Foods were very impressive. Prices were more, around 6-7 items we took and the bill came out to be around 750.
Interior and ambiance : 8/10
Food : 10/10
Service : 9/10

Located at the lake view road.  
Walking from jugals towards lake view road it place is 2 - 5 mins walk.  

Less space and little seatings. 

Food - 
Always a fan of this place.  
The firangi kebab are the best from here.  
The chesse sauce makes the dish absolutely delicious.  
Murg biryani-
Very fitting and tasty.  
Tender chicken and good rice makes the taste loving.  

Service is good but little slow.  
Pocket pinch is very good and less comparatively.  
Happy visit.  
Recommended for sure

After watching srk's raees,today i went to have lunch at salman bhaijaan's reataurant😂(as its named after salman khan's cinema sultan)!its a small place which can accommodate 12-15 people at a time .the walls are decorated with mughal and pattern wallpapers. But the food they serve at this price range is simply out of the world and surely a win-win deal for the customers.Had firangi kebab,mahi gondhoraj kebab,zafrani pulao,murgh lababdar and keema naan.all the items were brilliant.now murgh lababdar and firangi kebab are love!😍kebabs were so soft and juicy that one will keep longing for more.gondhoraj kebab was good but i felt it had a little more salt in it.zafrani pulao was like biryani only with little less flavour and minus the potato and meat.but it was so light!!!Truly i felt they are actually Sultan as far as food is concerned!!
P.s.prices mentioned in the menu are inclusive of all taxes.

Sultan was on my list from long. Finally paid a visit here for lunch and I am in lack of words to appreciate their wonderful dishes, their quality and the price tag.
Coming directly to the dishes.
For the starter we ordered,
• Firangi Kebab : Chicken Kebab with cream on it. This was wonderful to strat our meal with. Just Rs.200
Mains,
• Keema Naan : This was first stuffed naan I tried. Regular Naan stuffed with Mutton Keema inside. If you want to try Naan order it, you will love it.
• Naan : Regular Naan good in taste just for Rs.30
• Zafrani Pulao : This was brilliant, long rice with saffron and the quantity was enough to feed two person. Very good in taste.
• Murgh Badami : This was a Chicken dish with Yellow gravy and coated with broken nuts above. It wasn't spicy and went excellent with the Naan we took.
• Murgh Tikka Lababdar : Another master piece from Sultans Kitchen. Bit spicy and came in red gravy. We had it with the Zafrani Pulao and the combination was excellent.
Well after all this we weren't left with a single space in any corner of our stomach to try their Firni, which I heard is good to try.
Service was good.
Prices are damn cheap. We 3 people had lunch and the bill came out to be Rs.790 only with a Coke bottle with was Rs.50
Much Recommend.

Had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant a few days back and I had a blast. This is a small restaurant on lake view road that serves mughlai cuisine. The seating arrangement is small as there are only three tables that can accommodate up to 12 people at a time. But that's where all the complaints end.
This is one gem of a restaurant. For starters we went for Tangri Mumtaz and Firangi kebab. Firangi kebab is a house special and it is straight out awesome. It is just the right amount of moist and tender. Tangri Mumtaz is their take on Chicken Drumsticks. A plate contains two good pieces of drumsticks and the spices the use are great. It too is really tasty.

For main course we went for Ghoshth Biryani , keema naan, and to go with these two side dishes: Murgh tikka lababdar and rarra Ghoshth . The biryani is good in quantity and is tasty. One would not find any problems with the biryani. But the keema naan along with Murgh tikka lababdar stole the show for me. The later has a thick gravy that is oozing with flavors. Rarra Ghoshth is also a great dish. Not one item was disappointing among all the things we ordered.
Sadly they were out of kulfi so we decided against having desert.
So all foodies out there, this is one gem of a restaurant. Do visit this one :)

A hidden gem. A must visit place!

Went to this place yesterday evening after reading great reviews about the food.
Chances are there that you might miss locating the restaurant. I suggest they light the signboard up.

It is a small restaurant with 4 tables, accommodating around 12 people. However, they have put wallpapers and tried their best to make the place look good. 

Coming to the food, we ordered - 

Sultan's Special Firangi Kebab :  A shout out for this amazing preparation. The dish was served with creamy cheese sauce and the yummy kebabs literally melted in the mouth. Too Good! Do not miss this one. 

Sultan's Special Mahi Haryali Tikka : The kebab was soft and tasted good, however we felt that it could have tasted better.

Keema Naan : Cooked in clay oven, the naan is stuffed with minced mutton. Tasted great but the portion of the stuffing could have been more generous. 

Murgh Tikka Lababdar : Undoubtedly the best Tikka Lababdor I've had so far. This dish deserves a thumbs up! The gravy was rich and finger licking. The tender chicken pieces were yummy. Loved it! Another must order item.

We ordered Firni and Shahi Tukra for dessert but we were informed that none of the desserts were available. Now this is a regular complain. The management had replied to many of the previous reviews that they will definitely make the desserts available next time onwards, so we were expecting the desserts to be available. However, we were quite disappointed when they said they don't have any.

Service : Great.

Price : Quite reasonable, rather cheap. Total value for money.

Recommended!

Okay so this was unexpected! Sultan opened just last September but there food tell you otherwise. We visited the place last Tuesday at noon. The sitting area is rather small having two or three tables. The decoration attempted to bring a theme. 
But all these is not important. What's important is the food. I was truly overjoyed. We ordered Murg biryani, Keema nan and Shahi Murg korma. The chicken biryani was topped with khoya Kher and fried onions. It had great aroma and tasted aslo very good. Only problem was the chicken piece was dry. 
The Keema nan was also very good. Now the the Murg Shahi korma was surprisingly delicious. It had a thick gravy with soft chicken pieces. I could not leave a bit of this in the plate. The amount of love and care they put in making the foods is only comparable to the some of the bigshot restaurants.
The staff is very helpful. They will help you with your order. Overall the experience was splendid and I can tell this place will gain popularity in the city in no time. I hope they will continue with the quality. 
Lastly do not miss the drinks. They are great after or before a filling meal. Definitely give this a try. You will be delighted.

A small cozy joint in a convenient location. Stuffs are very courteous. Service is fast. Coming to the food, its lip smacking and mouth watering. Felt like a party in my mouth. We ordered mahi hariyali tikka, Nargisi Kofta ki salan and garlic nun. Quantity was enough for 2 people. The fish just melted in my mouth. Nun and kofta were equally amazing. I really loved the utensils in which the food was served. Above all the place is very pocket friendly. I would definitely go back to this place to try the other items.Aniket Mallick

Looking for joints serving amazing kebabs? You've found the right place. This is one of those rare places which serves finger licking kebabs. 
 We had ordered Firangi kebab and Kastoori kebab. The first one was served with creamy cheese sauce which was amazing, it actually enhanced the taste. The second one was so soft that it actually melted as I put it in my mouth. I wanted to have more kebabs but the mains were equally attractive and I ended up ordering Rarra Gosht and garlic naan. 
Rarra Ghosth had really soft pieces of mutton and the gravy was made with mutton keemas, which was equally amazing. This small little cute place will not disappoint you. 
Thank you.

Sultan - as the name says!! Have been reading reviews about this place for a long time so decided to visit this place for dinner with my special someone! Coming to the review part :
Location: located in a very popular place and very easy to find. Get down at Jugal's stop and take the by Lane. Walk for 5 min and to your left u will find Sultan. There is a FL shop rite before it.
Ambiance: its a small cozy joint or outlet with 4 tables..not a big shot place but gives you a cozy and comfortable feeling.
Food: nothing can beat the taste of the food served here.. Lips smacking ,fingerlicking!!! Just loved the taste of it. We had mutton biryani which was perfectly cooked and served warm, along with that we had masala kulcha n dum ka gosht....where we found the mutton perfectly cooked n very tender... Kulcha also tasted awesome...only disappointmnet was we were looking for shahi tukda which was unavailable that day. Nevertheless, good food at good price!! Would like to visit again and try other dishes also. :)

You might just get stunned by what this small little joint has to offer. The perfect example of the Hindi proverb - "chhota packet, bada dhamaka"

The location is very simple. This is located in the lane which houses the very famous Ballygunge Cultural Pujo. Located at a stone's throw from my place.

Last month (yes, the review is coming up late. I'm in my Zen mode) I decided to pay a visit to Sultan with my mom in tow. We were craving for some Mughlai food which would be easy breezy on our pockets, and Sultan came to our rescue.

The place is very small, can seat around 12 people, so you can understand. The seating arrangement is quite comfortable despite the space crunch. So no issues regarding that. The interiors are done up brightly, with medieval wallpapers which adds to the mughal ambience of this place.

Now coming to the food straight -

• For kebabs, we decided to go for Kastoori kebab. Oh my god it was soooo good. The chicken was so tender that it was melting in my mouth. Moreover it was cooked in egg batter so, cookie points for that.

• Next, we decided to stick to the combination of keema paratha and chicken tikka lababdar, which proved to be a clear winner. The keema parathas were soft and had ample keema stuffing and tasted divine with the chicken side dish. Coming to lababdar, it was really lababdar. The appealing look, the rich gravy, the tender chicken chunks - I'm salivating already. The taste was excellent. I can't really explain how fabulous it was. The portions were good too. In fact we were really full by the time we were done with the whole meal. Strongly recommended!

We also wanted to order kulfi and Firni for dessert, but unfortunately they had run out of it by 8:20 at night. Understandable. So no issues there as well.

Coming to the service, it is swift. The behaviour was very good. And so was the food. Definitely worth many visits.

Pocket pinch - 480! It's very affordable as well. A total win, in my opinion.

When i saw the name of this restaurant first time,only one thing came in my mind "Koi tumhe tab tak nahi hara sakta ... jab tak tum khud se na haar jao"..A very small place with capacity of serving 12 people at a time.we ordered MAHI SULTANI , RARRA GOSHTH , MURGH TIKKA LABABDAR ....taste wise mutton item and lababdar were awesome,,mahi sultani was also good..meat quality was amazing,in both cases it was very soft..but must say about their masala kulcha and keema nan,both was not upto the mark..specially keema nan was a waste,no taste at all..The service is a bit slow ..Ambience was decent..The prices are very very reasonable..Our bill was of Rs. 1125..no extra charges added..

This small restaurant is located in the lane beside jugals towards the ballygunge cultural puja club at lake view road. A very compact place with maximum capacity of serving 12 people at a time. Though the space is quite small but nicely arranged. As we stepped in for our new year eve special lunch, we thought to try their kebabs first. They have a wide variety of mughlai cuisines. We chose murg malai tikia kebab in starter followed by murg biryani in main course. The service was very prompt. Firstly they served the kebabs. Six medium pieces of chicken served with malai oozing out of it.. 🍗 I just loved every bite of the soft, tender, juicy kebabs which were just perfectly smoked. Next the biryani was served and it consisted one piece of potato, egg and chicken. The rice was perfectly cooked and the aroma of the biryani was just awesome to smell as well as to taste. The biryani itself was not at all dry so we didn't feel the need of having a gravy dish along with it. The chicken piece served was also tender. Quantity and quality both was truly maintained. The price is very much reasonable and inclusive of taxes. Our bill came only 330 Rs. So one can enjoy a variety of yummy foods without getting a hole in his pocket. So absolutely recommended. Cheers to Sultan..! 🍻

First time at this place, at the lane of Balligunge cultural..small place with nice decor .. Accommodation is not so big but arrangement is cool..
Main speciality is Moglai cuisine, specially lots of kabab items..We ordered Murg malai tikia rabab and chicken beriany... Soon they served that.. I must say about the test of the kabab.. That was too good..juicy and soft.. That was melting in your mouth... Next coming to the beriany... Simple chicken beriany was the best that I ever test..chicken of the beriany was also soft and testy.. Not dry at all....
Price is reasonable and including tax..
Over all that was an awesome experience..must try it...

Sultan is a small restaurant with hardly 5 tables...but I must say that won't stop me to visit them frequently. I loved their biriyani and kasturi kebabs. Food is served in good portions and pocket pinch is also very reasonable. Highly recommended.

we visited this place. This place is quite small..
We ordered :-
* firangi kabab( sultan's special) :- kebabs served with white creamy sauce but kebabs was little bit dry.
* gosht biryani :- it tasted was great & they served with a bowl of raita.
* rarra gosht :- rarra gosht was amazing, mutton pieces were soft and juicy.
Over all ambience was good and food quality & quantity also very good..
Staffs are friendly and helpful..
Service is the only problem... They are took too much time to serve anthor dishes...
Otherwise nice experience 👍👍👍

The chicken biryani was great, but with comparatively lesser quantity of rice. Kababs were decent. Service was sufficiently adequate. Seating area is really small with only 3 tables available at a time. My over all experience was good because of their food quality and taste.

Located at Lake View, in the lane beside Jugals.
A rather compact place accommodating a max of 10-12 people.
Previous reviews by my fellow foodie friends spoke greatly of the food served here and hence we thought of giving it a try.
Ambience was decent.
Staff polite and friendly.
We had:-
Murgh Malai kabab- decent. I would prefer this a bit more soft and moist though.
Firangi kebab- cheese infused into chicken kebabs makes this a delicious one. 
Chicken lababdar- again, delicious.
Lachha paratha- this isn't quite the usual one, it was very much unlike what we call lachha paratha. Not very happy though
Zafrani pulao- madly in love with this one. The perfect tinge of sweetness too. The quantity was good enough for the two..
By then we were quite full for desserts, planned to skip that.
The service is a bit slow, improvement on that should be helpful.
The prices are very very reasonable.
Coming back for more.

A new place is ever populated area of desopriya park,wanted to come here for some time,saw their Facebook page and zomato reviews all were good.

Its a venture of la fiesta catering , the place is small has 3- tables max 15 people can sit at once,coming to the food i ordered a gosht biriani and chicken tikka lababdar,they served in time, the quantity of biriani was very good for 160 bucks,it tasted yumm,a mix of kolkata and Hyderabadi ,with spice's and rich flavor,there were 3-4 small mutton pieces instead of one,which i liked very much,they were soft,it had an egg which i Always adore and aloo was a bit small but good,  coming to chicken lababdar it was tasty ,6 big pcs of ckn tikka,but they were not soft, i was disappointed. The gravy was spicy as i lyk but i found too much black pepper in it,and the biriani too had it a bit much.

Was too Full to try dessert,will try tandoori and dessert next time. The biriani came with complementary raita,i dnt like raita that much so had a bit it was oky.

A new one in town, this place flaunts of a high rating on Zomato. Thanks to the tantalising taste of the Firangi Kebab. A must have if you visit this place, the Cheese layered succulent pieces of reshmi kebab definitely did set the bar high up.. Followed up by the Tandoori Chooza, the starters were indeed scrumptious on a pleasant Sunday afternoon. The chicken tikka lababdar tasted fine but was a little too oily. Nevertheless, the service was excellent and the waiter was very courteous and diligent. The cola sikanji was unmistakably refreshing at the end of the main course.
Coming to the ambience, it was nothing special. A tiny layout with minimal seating arrangement can be inconvenient or you might just find the peace you crave for if you are the only one occupying the place. Lucky for me, there wasn't anyone else. This cosy comfortable place right at the middle of Lake View Road is a Star in the making! definitely recommended for Kebab lovers and Mutton Hoggers. Cheers!

Dropped there on one evening at 10:30 pm when the staff were not expecting any more guests. The place is small but has courteous staff. We quickly ordered our food- Chicken Tulsi Kebab & Chicken Malai Kebab as starters and Chicken Lababdar Tikka masala, Garlic Nun & Masala Kulcha as main course. Though they took some time to serve but once the food was served, we almost pounced upon it. All of the above mentioned dishes were lip smackingly tasty. We were also served complimentary Mishti Doi as dessert. Finally we left the place at 12 am. Will get back there for sure

I've been here for lunch with two friends.Its located in the lane beside Jugals.The place is very small.Its ok for small groups.But food they serve is excellent.We ordered a 2 burhanis and a bottle of thums-up for drinks.For starters we ordered a chicken malai kabab,1 chicken biriyani and a mutton biriyani.

Burhani-It was a refreshing yogurt based spiced drink with herbs in it and ginger shavings on top.It was something unique..I've never had such a drink before.

Chicken malai kabab- Wow! Kababs were so tender,juicy with a perfect note of smokiness.Malai was oozing out of it as we gorged on it.

Biriyanis-They came with a bowl of raita.Its one of the best biriyani I had in recent times.It comes with a aloo,boiled egg,a piece of meat.It garnished with caramelised onions on top and they use roasted cashews in biriyani which is a bonus.The rice had rich aroma and flavour which are trademark of a good biriyani.The piece of aloo given was big which will bring smile to any Bengali who loves their Kolkata style biriyani.The meat pieces were soft too.Raita was a refreshing addition to the biriyani which balances out the richness.They didn't take the raita for granted and did an excellent job with it too.

Service was efficient.Pricing is very pocket friendly.
But my major complain was unavailability of desserts(I asked for the shahi tukda and the server apologised that desserts are not available then).It was lunch time then and for me meal is incomplete without desserts.I hope next time when I'll visit I won't be disappointed and have a full course great meal.

It was bookmarked went there with high expectations as soon as we entered there was only 3 tables with 2 pairs of chair. It is a small joint with a simple wallpaper. As the owner mainly has a catering services known as la fiestas so he made this awadhi joint for us. 2 families were there to discuss menus for their marriage. Unfortunately,  people were discussing in a loud voice which we didn't enjoy at all because it was not the right place to discuss all these when the food joint is small. Coming to the food half of the kebabs were not there because of leg piece. We ordered :
* Kastauri kebab 
* Masala Kulchas 
* Nargisi kofta ki Salan 
* Green salad 
Once we have ordered the served it after 15minutes too slow service.Chicken kebab was chewy so it was flop.
Masala Kulchas were tasty. 
Nargisi kofta ki Salan - I know what does Nargisi kofta means boiled egg covered with grounded mutton ball. And they served 2 full egg curry with a thick gravy and charged 230/- only. It was absolutely flop dish..
They served stale fish cutlet to the next table..
Bad experience.. I would like to tell the owner not to discuss your menus in the restaurant it cause inconvenience to others..
Thank you! 
Won't visit again.. 🙏

From the pages of history, to the silver screen celluloids, the arabic abstract noun "Sultan" always suceeded to take us back to the time/era that highlights Strength, Authority and Rulership posessed by the rulers of the time, and the way they administered the respective 'sultanates'(kingdom).

And even today, the perceptual image of the term "Sultan" remains the same, and creates exactly the same impact as mentioned just above.
But have you ever wondered about a restaurant named exactly the same??!! What one can expect from a restaurant named "Sultan", so as to fulfill the gastronomic calisthenics??!!
Let's have a look!!

No matter how brave the Sultans were, and despite of how efficiently they managed to mark their era with glory and pride, the aroma and taste of 'Awadhi Cuisine" was never been prevented to continue its presence in the 'rasoi'(kitchen) of sultanates, and the legacy continued to consistently maintain its presence even in this era of modern day cityscape, the restaurant "SULTAN" being a live evidence in the city of joy.

Located on Lake View Road, near Deshapriya Park, the restaurant "SULTAN" brings you a wide spread of Awadhi Flavours, from time immemorial, so as to treat your palate the "Sultan" way!! Though a bit cramped up in space, the design in the interior completely synchronized with the theme all through!

To start of with, it is always a sheer moment of joy to get refreshed with some fizzy, replenishing "Rooh Afza Lemonade", rolling down your tastebuds!! Not only its refreshing, but also an age old legacy being enjoyed since ages!! And the royal treatment continues to a glorifying journey when your tastebuds get the taste of some amazingly delicious "Tangri Kebab", "Boti Kebab Badami", and "Mahi Gabdharaj Tikka"!!
A sheer moment of joy and delight is sure to capture anybody's heart, when such beautiful notes of delectable taste gets itself treating your tastebuds!! Even avid food aficionados like

The restaurant is in a prime location, with some delicious kebabs and Awadhi food. We had Murgh Tulsi Kebab which was very succulent and the marination was done perfectly. The basil and yogurt mix made the kebabs delicious. Now, to the main course, we had mutton biryani and Nargisi Kofta. I am fond of Nargisi Kofta and this was made to perfection. The mutton piece in the biryani could have been a bit bigger but given the fact that this is a new place they are always improving. The important point being the prices are kept at the minimum so this is quite a pocket-friendly place as well and the quality of food that they are providing, this is absolutely a value for money restaurant. 
The owner Mr. Karmakar is always present and he personally takes care of the quality of the food and the customer satisfaction. All the best for making Sultan one of the best in business.

Sultan, the name transports you to a Bedouin world, the images drift by...imageries of sand, mouthwatering kebabs...and you land at Lake View road. This one is right behind the Ballygunge Cultural Pujo Association. What a brilliant time to open such a gifted place. The owner already runs a successful home and corporate catering service. With his previous experience and his close aid, his chef, they create magic in the kitchens. 
For once, do not judge a place by their decor. They have kept it to the bare minimum and concentrated more on the food. 
We were scouting for places when we decided to try Sultan. It was a fairly big, and we occupied almost the entire joint! Simmering hot tangri kebabs greeted us with some rooh afza lemonade to kick start the dinner. This was followed by mahi gandharaj tikka, the fish was so fresh and cooked to perfection. The fish melts in your mouth. 
For main course we tried their chicken lababdar, rarra gosht, mahi sultani with an assortment of breads. The gosht was tender and full of spices, it tasted excellent with the kulcha and the zafrani pulao. The pulao as a standalone dish stood out, could not get enough of the rice.
the evening closed on a sweet note with some freshly prepared shahi tukda! 

Kudos team Sultan, they relentlessly provided excellent service throughout the evening. The owner, kind and humble shared his experiences. This one needs to be looked out for, and is sure to be a pujo hit!

Location is at its best as it can be just near the Desapriya Park alley road of the Jugal's Sweet shop. Heard about the Place for quite sometime and decided to go there with some of my friends. Its a new opening and just at the right time for them when Durga Puja is around the corner. 

Dont keep to much expectations with the ambiance to be honest as its a quite tiny one.  If you are looking for a dinner or lunch with a huge group better to skip the dine in and Opt for their awesome food as Delivery. From the service part it was fair enough to say that it was decent and quick, so no complaints on that.

We got our seats instantly and being greeted with the Welcome drink in form of Rooh AfZaa Lemonade.  Which took the tiredness away with its all time divine taste. Refreshing!!!

Started with the Starters on the first place ordering with the following dishes

1. Tangri Kebab : Big and huge 4 Leg pieces of Chicken on the plate. It was roasted well, marination was very nice which made the things a soft affair. Juicy inside and well cooked.

2. Boti Kabab Badami : This sounds like anything related to veg starter as Badam is being mentioned here. Make no mistake its a mutton starter. The dish was as interesting as the name is. Soft juicy and cooked well, still were some obstacles with small bones inside but its was the part of the dish.

3. Mahi Gondhoraj : This was another kabab which hits the table but with the attire of fish mixed and well compiled with the Gondhoraj in it. Small pieces of fish well made kababs for the offerings but the strong flavour of Gondhoraj lime was a bit absent in it. Though it didn't disappointed me with the taste.

Done with the Starters which were worth the time and money, just loved the way they were presented and made. So here we go we walked towards the main course.

Three gravy  and One Rice in the Main course were served on the table in form of

1. Chicken Lababdar

2. Rarra Gosht

3. Mahi Suntani

4. Jeer/ Zafrani Pulao

5. Naan

Chicken Lababdar is one of my most loved dish so had a huge expectation with it and seriously it didnt disappointed me at any way. The flavour of spices was soothing well in the tongue. Though being spicy it was not too oily and had some  good amount of chicken in it that was way good with the Nan and Zafrani Pulao. Rarra gosht was simply amazing with its taste. It was a mutton based item. The texture was very appealing in the kadhai and quite spicy too. Being serving mutton  in bengal then it has to be spicy and oil need to pour down the  mutton to be make it looks hotter. Mahi Sultani was the pick of them all. A golden textured fish based main course . Gravy was thick and tasty and going very well with the naan. Zafrani Pulao was certainly one of the best till date, So light and less in oil. The flavour of basmati and saffron was of no match.

Done with a delightful and unexpected dinner which was really bang on. Being a sweet tooth myself when i saw the Sahi Tukda on the menu cards i could not resist myself. 
Had a try of the shahi Tukda and i must say i give it a 4.5/5.

Walking in here was sure but having such a great experience with the food was truly unexpected. Kudos to the management and chef for serving such well made dishes. People Hopping Pandals this Puja, This is a must visit place for all those North Indian Food Lovers. Recommended.

When you get some delicious food on your table, you just dont need anything else but to focus on and this is exactly what you will get at this place. This place has been a gem of a finding. Not only does it serve great quality food, it doesn't give much stress to your pocket too. One of those places where I enjoyed almost everything from the food to the great hospitality, and when you get good service it always stays in your mind.

***Location: Its in the by lanes of Deshapriya Park, walk straight from the lane beside Jugal's and you will get this place in your left.

***Ambience & Decor: Well, nothing much to say about the decor. Small place for limited number of people to sit and have some lovely food.

*** Food and Decor:

#Rooh Afza Lemonade
#Tangri Kabab
#Boti Kabab Badami
#Mahi Gandharaj Tikka
#Chicken Lababdar
#Rarra Gosht
#Mahi Sultani
#Assorted Breads
#Zafrani Pulao
#Shahi Tukda

Well its a tough choice to criticise any of the items as they were made just perfectly.
Starting from the welcome drinks which was just perfect to freshen things up, the starters were lipsmacking. The tangri Kabab was juicy, had right amount of spice. The Mahi Gandharaj Tikka was just too good with its flavour.
But the star of the evening was the Rarra Gosht, well you have to try it to get the feeling. It was just amazing nd was just going brilliantly with the Zafrani Pulao. And to end things up I had one of my favourite dessert, Shahi Tukda which was apt to end things perfectly.

So never miss on to this place. This place is one of the go to places during pujas.

Location: If you're coming from Gariahat or Rashbehari side, get down at the "Jugals" more. Enter the alley and keep walking until you find a small restaurant named "Sultan'!

Firstly, This restaurant can earn so much brownie points just by their hospitality. Form the owners to the waiters, everyone was very courteous, polite and well-behaved!

Food tasted :

* Rooh Afza Lemonade : This was the welcome drink and what appealed to me most was its rich red color. The drink was absolutely refreshing. This is your regular Rooh Afza with a lemon-y twist!

*Tangri Kebab : Chicken drumsticks marinated in tandoori spices and then charcoal-grilled was served to us. This kebab was absolutely yum. The presentation was fantastic. Finely julienned vegies was served as salad and the green chutney was actually served inside a piece of scooped out cucumber!

*Boti Kebab badami : This was a Mutton kebab and was an instant hit. The kebab pieces were extremely juicy and very well cooked. I could literally see molten fat oozing out as I was ravishing the kebabs. Loved it!

*Mahi Gandhraj Tikka : As the name suggests this was a fish kebab and was unanimously declared by us the best! The fish pieces were absolutely well-cooked and were very well infused with ;gondhoraj' lime flavour! Absolutely delish!

*Chicken Lababdar : Chicken tenders cooked in a spicy gravy was served. It was very tasty and I polished it off with naans!

*Rarra Goshth : This has to be my favourite. The mutton pieces were so well cooked and the gravy was thick, creamy and spicy. It had bags of flavour in it and I absolutely loved this dish!

* Mahi Sultani : This was a spicy Fish curry and this was mind blowing as well. The fish was well cooked, the gravy was moderately spicy!

*Assorted Naans : 2 types of naan and laccha paratha was served. All of those were very soft and tasty and went well with gravies!

*Jeer/ Zafrani Pulao : This was a white pulao with lots of crispy fired/brown onions('beresta') in it. The quality of the rice was so good!  The rice was not at all over-cooked and each grain was seperated!

*Shahi Tukda : Shahi Tukda can be loosely called as a bread pudding! The shahi tukda was good as well. The bread pieces were fried in ghee till crispy and was laden with that beautiful thick and creamy 'kheer' and was topped with nuts. It was pretty good!

Once again, The management was extremely humble and courteous.

Dont let the size of this place fool you, for the food here is a class apart! Sultan is a place where I tasted some of the best side dishes and pulaos in a really long time. So frankly, I don't eat a lot of red meat. I hate the meaty texture. But when I tried the Rahra Gosht here,  just couldn't stop! The meat was so tender and the gravy was rich and aromatic. Thats one dish you MUST try when you are there. Also worth applauding is the Zafrani Pulao, which is a surprisingly pleasant change from the regular biryani. This dish is loaded with dry fruits, ghee and fried onions and a rice lover like me can polish of an entire serving by itself, without needing any more side dishes! Some other dishes I would like to recommend here are the Gandharaj Mahi tikka, a fish kebab with the fine fragrance of Gondhoraj Lebu and the Shaahi tukda. Service is quick and efficient. Overall I had a wonderful experience at Sultan and I am looking forward to go back and try some more items from the menu soon.

Sultan is a newly opened small but elegantly decorated restaurant located in a posh locality of South Kolkata and run efficiently by two dynamic, energetic young entrepreneurs.

The lunch I ate along with my family was tasty and delicious. I saw a lot of local customers also taking away parcels. I wish the restaurant well and I'm sure if they maintain the standards they will have a roaring business. Best of luck to Sudipto and his team!

Being an event company we do party all across Kolkata. This is the place @ Lake View Road, just one step from Ballyganj Cultural puja mandap. We had our client meet on 24th September at this place. Just incredible food. Must try "Kababs" and all mutton items. The best part is that it's absolutely affordable. Must visit...

"Great food and cordial reception"... the least way I can describe "Sultan".. From the cheesy Firangi Kebabs to the Dam pukht tasty food bombs , from the plates to the platter. ... they have amazed me in every way ... . They...have redefined Awadhi cuisine.  ..A must visit is recommended to surprise the taste buds. .. :)

Awadhi cuisine in kolkata has so far been biryanis, chaap and few kebabs items, at Sultan there is whole new range of kebabs and handi and lagan items which is going to titillate the taste buds of calcuttans, items like Kakori Kebab, Murgh Tulsi Kebab, Tangri Mutaz, Mahi Gandharaj Tikka are kebab specialities of "Sultan" and Ghosth Byriani, Murgh Lababdar are another hit items, This restaurant is highly recommended for Mughlai food lovers.

i went to this place when it was recently opened as it was close to my house. It comfortably suits the pocket pinch and is a great place for a small party. I saw it renovated and opened again. M looking forward to give it a try once more..

Since this place is really close to my house and we were too lazy to venture out,  we decided to give it a try. We ordered special mutton biryani, chicken makhmali kebab and roomali rotis. All of it was home delivered.  
Mutton biryani was a little on the drier side and the mutton could have been more tender so 3/5
Makhmali kebab was nicely done although there's scope for improvement so 3.5/5
Roomali roti was alright 5/5
It can potentially become a good restaurant offering amazing mughlai cuisine.
