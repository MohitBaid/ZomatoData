~Authentic bengali food is what you get in here. Dark & cozy place, which adds fun to eat. Loved the crunchy alu-bhaja and the quality of rice they serve. A must try for all.

I rated 3.5 because of the good food, and the (nominal) pricing. Apart from the above mentioned, the place is a bit cramped & they can hardly accommodate 25 people at one go.

A small blink and you miss restaurant at Jadavpur super market near 8b bus stand. Got food home delivered. Food ordered - shukto and khejur amswatto r chutney. 
Both the dishes were a bit bellow expectations. Shukto was more gravy and less veggies. That too, veggies included mainly potato with a very few bits of drumsticks and kanch kola(green unripe banana). Just similarly, chutney had scattered few pieces of khejur(dates) sinking in red liquidüò£ and God bless those who can find amsawtto. After all, you don't serve sub standard quality of these two dishes to a bongüòú.
The quantity is substantial, one plate enough to serve two. Service is prompt. Despite the not-so-good( poor would be too harsh) quality, the food did manage to make a few deprived-of-home food-for-long bong souls smile.

I have not visited their outlet but we tried a number of dishes from their stall in the recent food festival "Ahare Bangla". I must say each item was delicious and the quality of the ingredients was good.
Topshe fry- The fish was very fresh and tasty. The batter could have been made crispier.
Ilish polao- This was the ultimate delicacy . Each grain of rice was infused with flavour of ilish. The piece of fish that came along with it was also delicious.
Ilish vapa- Cooked with fresh mustard seed paste, the pungent gravy will really make your eyes water. Needless to say, the fish was exotic.
The staffs were friendly but a little disorganised.
Price was pocket-friendly.

The decor is not up to the mark however it's accessible from 8B bus stand in Jadavpur. The food is okayish and I would suggest they give extra caution go presentation as well as service. We ordered Ilish thali which included a number of dishes like ilish bhaaja with maacher tel, macher matha diye kochu saag, daal , Ilish bhapa with Rice.
All in all the taste was good but nothing was deliciously prepared and there was complimentary chatni, papor and mishti doi. The prices are really pocket friendly and the array of dishes are a change to the palate.

Rice was sufficient for 1 person , topse fry was crunchy and literally a new one to taste.. kacupata bhapa chingri was heartmelting though am not fond of so much chingri .. bt I disappointed with their mutton dish..it was rich , thicky gravy but very sweet to taste.. and mutton pieces are so unjustified .. overall its good ... pocketpinch

At jadavpur super market near 8B bus stop..it is a simple Bengali cuisine restaurant.. Today went there for lunch.. 
Luchi with alur dum..
Polao and mutton kosha..
Soft drink
Taste was ok.. Alur Dum was good.. But polao was not that good. Mutton was ok but they served only 2 piece for 2( we had a little coupon).. Polao was enough in quantity..
Small and simple outlet with little decoration. Food can be better..

This small restaurant is hidden at the first floor of an old building in Jadavpur Super market. Visitied here today for lunch around 12 pm and it was fully empty. We had a little coupon worth 349 RS of Bengali meal for two people. The menu includes 2 Pulao, 1 Mutton Kasha, 4 PCs Luchi with Aloo Dam and 2 fresh lime soda. The decoration inside the restaurant is simple and the place is not so big. They also don't have any washroom. Ambiance is nothing mentionable. The food took more than 15 minutes to be served. Luchi and Aloo Dam tasted good. Pulao was not tasty at all. The flavour and the sweetness of typical Bengali pulao was missing though there was ample of Cashews served. 2 PCs of Mutton was served in a thick but not so yummy gravy. Mutton was not very soft but it was okaish type dish. Lime soda more seemed like lebu chini jol. So the food quality overall wasn't up to my satisfaction. Not recommended. There are far better eateries in this area.

We were searching for a new bengali restaurant near jadavpur, and came upon this suddenly. Now, about the review.

Food- The food is lipsmacking, though they did not have any starters available for a sunday menu, which was a very big let down. We ordered basanti pulao, and mutton kasha. The cold drinks we ordered came after 1 hour. 

Ambience- The decor is pretty nice. The restaurant is situated on the first floor, the way to the restaurant is very dirty though. But the inside is nice and clean.

Staff- The staffs are friendly.

The mane suggest a typical bengali restaurant. It do offer bengali dishes also. Location is kind of wired on the 2nd floor. It won't seems to be nice from outside. Interior was not decorated rather kind of collapsed. Only the food is thing that gives u satisfaction here. Dishes they offer taste really good specially the lachha paratha and kosha mangsho. Overall a moderate one.

Ordered a single veg thali on a weekend afternoon and after ordering they show a delivery time of 135 min! On calling the restaurant as to how they need more than 2 hrs for a thali they did not respond and I finally had to get the order cancelled by zomato, which also could contact the restaurant after multiple trials, as they said. Poor service is worse than poor food!

At first I was taken aback by the average rating of this place here. But, somehow I decided to pour in today. I had ordered a Maxi Thali(Basmati Rice, Moong Dal, Sukto, Veg Curry, Aloo Bhaja, Tomato Chutney, Papad, Mishti Doi) coupon from Nearbuy app. I must say, the food was no more no less. Just the right portions served. Moong Dal was impeccable. Since I have a craving for Bengali food so I will say this deal was more than satisfactory. Only thing I am concerned about is the cutlery which were not as neat as polished. I would love to see them serve something more authentic like Mochar Kofta and the like. Cheers!

At 11 am today I placed an online order through zomato . The order was a bengali cuisine for lunch. Payment method is cash on delivery . Its 4 pm now and I still haven't got my lunch yet. Guess these guys forget their orders . Anyway I didnt lose any money. So no damage done .

We had spotted this place while going to the Jadavpur coffee house.
It is located in the same building,beside coffee house.
We dropped in here for a sudden dinner.
This place has some really tasty Bengali food.
Prices are pocket friendly and inclusive of taxes.
We had Rice,Moong Daal,Chhanar kopta,Parshe sorshe and Kosha murgi.
Each and every item is delicious and quantity is sufficient for two people.
Service is prompt.
Interiors are like any normal restaurants but neatly maintained.

I have ask for a home delivery and after 1.5 hours it did not reach home. Even after multiple follow ups they continue to say that the delivery man is on the road and he will reach me. Then after 10:30 they stopped taking calls. They did not have minimum courtesy to inform that they cannot deliver. Pathetic service.

Edit: Management taken corrective action and connected me and given me free dinner. Food was great and really liked the way management handled the whole situation

Bhooter Raja Dilo Bar is an average Bengali food restaurant located at Jadavpur. I opted for take away and ordered: chicken kosha (chicken in a thick gravy), chingri bati chochhori (spicy pulverised prawns) and egg curry. The delivery was fast, but the food was not  as per expectations. The chicken was very chewy and the prawns were too less. The egg curry was good. Their packaging was impeccable.

This Bengali restaurant is located at Jadavpur with nice ambience and ample sitting arrangements.

Service is bit slow and most of the dishes mentioned in the menu were unavailable.

Tried luchi, alurdom & Bhetki Paturi. All were well cooked and Bhetki Paturi was awesome . 

Pocket pinch is bit high.

Bhooter Raja Dilo Bar is a restaurant which serves Bengali dishes.

Ambience is nice with sitting arrangements.

Service is average.

Tried Peas pulao, alurdum & Chingri Malaikaari. All items were nice but still nothing to rave about. Quantity was less and prices were a bit high.

Dingy little place with incompetent staff and horrible food!!! Can it get any more worse? Have opted for take-away from there twice and each time have been utterly disappointed. The Pulao rice was over-cooked; the Mutton was too hard to chew and the Chutney was overly stale by more than a day, I presumed, going by the look of it. Would definitely not recommend it to anyone who wants to have a decent meal; forget authentic Bengali cuisine.

Nether Zomato Nor myself could connect them. Barely the restaurant is 10 mins walking from my place. I think I need to place the order somewhere else...Foodies beware of this place as you might have to starve if you are ordering from here.

Bhooter Raja Dilo Bar. I was quite hesitant to go there at first after reading the reviews on zomato but then decided to give it a try anyway. Went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant is located near 8B bus stand. On the first floor of an old building. The d√©cor is pleasant. Maybe they renovated it recently. We ordered peas pulao, luchi, alu dum and mutton kosha. The food was ok. Average I would say. Nothing to rave about. However I found the peas pulao to be a little too oily. Would I go there again? Probably not but if you're in the area and like this kind of food then why not. Give it a try.

One of the disastrous and worthless food destinations in South Kolkata. A Bengali cuisine restaurant that does not have the slightest know how of making Aamer Chatni should shut shop with immediate effect. I have never tasted a more horrible aamer chatni than the one bought from this place...I was not feeling like giving even a 1.0 rating to this place. I am quoting the VAT number of the order (49621312485), Bill No: DU6 dated 30.06.2016 so that i am not considered vindictive or have any malicious intention other than purely expressing a transparent opinion

It took 1 hour for delivery , the packed containers were not packed well there was leaking of curry.
When I opened the containers found the quantity far less for the pricing and gravy was too less not there at all. The parathas were too oily and so was the food. The chicken dishes couldn't differentiate the taste
Was disappointed

Bhooter raha dilo bar is the outlet of Bawarchi catering to people who loves authentic bengali cuisines. On the eve of bhaidooj I ordered from this bengali outlet for lunch of 16 persons in my house which is just 1 minute walking from this outlet. The menu we suggested was Pabda Shorshey , Chingri Malaicurry , Basmati rice , Mung Dal , Aloo bhaja , Papad , Dhokar Dalna and Chutney . The taste of all the items were really good. No doubt in that. But they lack in understanding the requirements of the customer. They are very polite to you while you place the order but they are extremely ill mannered while delivering the items at home. 
Swapna madam was the one who took the order but Mr. Purnendu Mandal is the one who delivered at home. Please beware of this person as he is extremely  ill mannered guy i have ever seen . Not only he supplied the items late by 1 hour to my place even he was creating trouble during payment. 
P.S : The food were really tasty but the size of prawns were small compared to what they had suggested.

Located on the first floor of the market near the 8B bus stand in Jadavpur, it wasn't so easy for us to locate the restaurant. Though the space is small, it is cosy and has a feel good ambience. The food was fairly good but there is hope for much improvement. The bhetki paturi, chholar dal and alur dom tasted delicious. The staff were warm but needed more of a welcoming smile on their faces. I liked the experience as a whole. :)

Rice was of bad quality,papad was not fried properly,chutney was watery. However i liked their DAL,only dal. Half of d things on menu r not available n d manager is least interested on taking review. I went there only after reading the review of other people but pls dont get misled like me.

This place is a saviour whenever our cook is on leave. :p
They have pretty decent service and tasty food. I have tried out a number of dishes and they were decent. Their latest dish which I tried out was illish bhapa and it was nice. People in love with authentic Bengali food can try this out.

Very disappointed with this place. The food and quality was very bad. But most importantly they cheated us. They had come to city center salt lake at the chingri ilish utshab. We had ordered for 5 ilish polao and the amount was very less and fish pieces were broken and tiny almost like one piece was divided into two. They divided two plates into five and gave us. They are Cheating their customers!

This place is one of the best place to serve u mouth watering bangali ranna in Kolkata.

I tried ilish pulao with ilish paturi n ilish fish finger.All of them was at their best specially I want to mention about the Ilish Paturi. It was soo soft n well cooked with a perfect combination of spices.

with an obscure blink and u miss location beside the jadavpur coffee house the place serves bengali food at affordable prices...but lesser price means quality is also downplayed when u compare with the bhojohari mannas and others...sitting area is small and the chital maachher mithya was not a good experience at all...the fish was dry and hard...the polao and chicken was ok though...but inferior in quality when compared to the others

Went to this restaurant couple of days ago. The restaurant is situated just opposite of Bwarchi restaurant in jadavpur. It's mainly good for take away purpose but we opted for a dine in. It's a small joint with little bit of decoration. We ordered steamed rice, dal , jhuri alu vaja, one chicken and one mutton preparation. The quality of the food was nice and also it could certainly feed two hungry people. Chicken curry was much better than the mutton curry. Though the mutton curry was not that bad. Prices are also on the lower side. After coming out from the university if you feel like to try some good Bengali food then this is the place you should visit.

This place is our address for our yearly New Year's gathering.It's now been a ritual of three years that all of us at work celebrate New Year's (1st Jan) with a lunch at BRDB! Simple and authentic bengali food.But they are not consistent with their dishes- sometimes it's super tasty,other times just average.And non availability of most items on the menu is another negative.Slow service and cramped place.But since it's a special place for me,I will be fond of it anyways.

The delivery is very poor. Had to chase them twice and still they were not sure how much time it will take to deliver, that too on a Monday afternoon. The portions are very less. Mutton pullao was not even one box full. Posto bora was full of dust. Mutton kassa was pathetic. Overall, I am not happy with their service, quantity and quality of food.

Why haven't I been here earlier! !! I have gone far to taste bengali cuisine but the best one was nearer which I missed! 
Each and every time was beautifully tasty and I kept on eating till I couldn't move.
We ordered one mini veg meal and one maxi veg meal; along with pabda jhal and katla kalia from fish.
Wish I had a bigger stomach, I would have stuffed some more on the menu. 
This eatery deserves more visits. 
Better and more economical experience than bhojhohori manna.

Good place with good Bengali food. Also prices are quite reasonable. However, better lighting must be installed in the seating area. It gets so dark that sometimes its virtually impossible to know what one is eating. Especially for traditionally non fish-eating people this could get little difficult as they are not so experienced in sifting out the bones from the fish.

Went there once on a weekend. It was crowded and we had to wait for a while before we got a place to sit. Its a tiny restaurant with very leads seating space.. The food is very good. Had chingri malai curry and chicken kosha with rice. The menu is extensive with a wide variety of non veg items . The price is very very reasonable and that's one of the reasons the restaurant is always filled. It's a casual dine - in.

Bhooter Raja Dilo Bor was one of the most affordable places for having original Bengali food. 4 years back the prices were so unbelievably low, that if our Bill would even cross Rs.250, we would be quite surprised and thus Bhooter Raja was then a daily affair for our group of 4, always eating to our hearts content. 

Cut to the present, Bhooter Raja still continues to fascinate us with its fresh preparations of Bhetki Jhal, Bhetki Sorshe, Chicken Dak Bungalow, Chicken Jhal, Parshe except the Tel Koi, but its prices have been so drastically increased that even a weekly indulgence at Bhooter Raja is now planned after much deliberation. 

The ambience at Bhooter Raja is nothing much to speak about, what with the small place, dripping ACs and smelly hand wash basin. 

Diners are advised to carry some cash in their wallets as backup, in case the Credit Card machines are dysfunctional, which is a pretty frequent occurrence at Bhooter Raja. The Waiters & attendants are helpful & courteous. 

Bhooter Raja will always hold a special place in our hearts for its modest appearance but great food.

located in jadavpur just beside the coffee house. small sitting place which is somewhat tidy. the place was full. Water was served in small earthern tea cups. We decided to order and as i ordered i was shocked. bEcause i told him 4 5 things next to next and he told they dont have that. then he finally said that ¬†they dont have anything in the non-veg sabji portion!!. they onli had 4 dishes!. In a sunday afternoon they have onli 4 side dish(that also veg)!! 3/4 th of the menu they didnt have!.(I didnt try fish, they said they had some fish items ) Next i thought the restaurant special dish might be ¬†mutton bhooter raja! the waiter himself said taht it was not a good dish so told us to try mutton dkbnglw. we ordered asking him what could be better. So ordered ¬†basmati rice, echorer dalna, mutton dakbunglow and aam doi. Echor dalna was ok. mutton dakbunglow was not at all good. I have had better than this! But 1 thing i must say is that the thing which i liked the most was the aam doi. It ws really good!!!.
total was 394/-. Not a good option taking taste in consideration but could be tried as price is not that much.
and 1 thing i forgot to mention was that the water in the wash basin tasted horrible!!!!

Though it's a small outlet it is air conditioned. ambiance is not so good. service is okay type. but the bengali food is very good. you can feel the aroma. it seems like " maa er haater ranna". and of course it is very cost effective. if you are on a hectic schedule or in a hurry in jadavpur, i suggest you to try this one rather than bawarchi.

It is situated on the first floor of a crowded marketplace near 8b bus stand. The dining space is very small and washroom facility is limited. The food is traditional bengali style. The size of fishes in the normal bengali dishes is commendable. Every dishes mentioned in the menu are not available. But the dishes cooked everyday are written on the board which varies on a regular basis. I recommend not to order mutton dishes from here as they are not worth it.

Initially we had a tough time finding this address. It‚Äôs a warning for those, who expect car parking anywhere near this place. Forget it ! 

Well, nothing is great about this place. The service is really sluggish and the staff looks under trained. The ambiance is not that great and the congested seating might cause you little irritation.

In spite of a wide range of menu, nothing stands out really. We ordered as per the attendant‚Äôs recommendation ‚Äì Laal Chicken & Chicken Pulao along with Bhetki Paturi. Must say, very ordinary food ! The price is exorbitant compared to its quality & taste. As compared to other Bengali restaurants in city, this one is no where in the competition.

Overall, not an experience to remember !

But we were quite surprised when we got our old Bengali Khana called Chitol Macher Muithya, Dav Chingri n Vetki Paturi over here, which made me nostalgic in remembering my grandmother and the unforgettable taste of the foods of Bhooter Raja Dilo Bor pulls me every week.

It is located on the 1st floor near Jadavpur. Its not hard to find but the entrance is a little creepy. The place isn't very spacious. 
We ordered Mutton Pulao and Laal Chicken (as the waitress suggested).
The service here is terrible. We were really hungry that day and repeatedly reminded the waiters to get us our food but it was brought an hour later. 
The food was good though. Pulao was nice, chicken good. The quantity was average. 
Visit the restaurant only if not in a hurry.

14th February is my birthday and so my wife took me to Bhooter Raja Dilo Bar for a treat. Boy I was amazed by the whole ambiance of the place. I am really impressed by the interior of the restaurant, and the lighting arrangements. I really admire those who maintain balance between food quality and the hospitality. Bhooter Raja Dilo Bar got full marks in my meter for their totality. If I can remember correctly our bill was somewhat around INR 320, but the treat that I had was really great. For sure people should come in this place and that too in lots of number.

But the space is not enough. only 6 table is with in the resturant place. serving was good and price reasonble.
