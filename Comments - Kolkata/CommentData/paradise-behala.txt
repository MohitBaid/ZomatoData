Place located on James Long. The service is good. The take out is okay-ish. The food is good.
Not much of a family diner. But you can go for a casual dinner.

This small Chinese joint(not authentic Chinese cuisine) is the one place I turn to for a quick solution to 'what should we eat when I'm with my friends at home and don't wanna spend much on some decent food to fuel up the adda session'. It has been quite some time since I've ordered from this place and I'll be ordering soon but when I used to, the default menu was Mixed Fried Rice/ Mixed Szechuan Fried Rice with Chilli Chicken(Boneless)/ Szechuan Chicken/ Manchurian Chicken. This place is one of those local default takeaway/home-delivery options everyone needs and as long as the purpose is that and nothing fancy, this place delivers. Their delivery timing is standard, just like the quality and quantity!

Not at all a standard eatery. I think the very best in behala is now Chowman if 1 is willing to spend few more bucks. Once a regular customer im now vry disheartened by their approach. Vry less quantity, rude behavior by 1 of the guys, not so good quality r their trade marks now. Furthermore their food is not at all authentic Chinese but Indo Chinese.

Paradise is really a paradise for food lovers. Located at Sakherbazar, it offers a wide range of chinese food items. I have tried here drums of heaven and dry chilli chicken. Drum of heaven was heavenly!! Dry chilli chicken too was very tasty but the size of the chicken pieces were small. I have heard a lot about momos and other starters from this food joint. Prices are moderate. The only con here is the ambience which is very average. Service, I found it slow on my 2nd visit.A single boy was attending all the tables and hence took a lot of time in providing us the bill. On my first visit,the service was prompt.
Looking forward to visiting again to try steamed momos!

Located on Sakherbazar Jameslong, almost all their food items are pretty good, tasty, satisfying and at par with their affordable (read cheap) price range.  The place is small and as I live quite near, I opt for home deliveries. Their home deliveries service is quite prompt. You should try their specials, Chopsuey, Mixed Friedrice from the main course. Their starters and side dishes are all too good to pick out in particular. Always ready to order from there.

Since the days of my school I have been visiting this place .I have seen it grow and change.For young people who run on pocket money,I feel it's a great place.They serve fairly good chinese,by fairly good I mean better than the fast food centres and the restaurants of similar category.It's an affordable place ,something that you call"Sasta and tikao".Though I feel that previously their food quantity and taste was better.

It is situated at Sakher bajar James Long Sarani crossing and is known for its Chinese dishes. Tried their mixed fried rice, sweet and sour chicken,and mixed hakka noodles. All the items were good. For me mixed hakka was better than the mixed rice. Quantiy of both the items were more than enough for a person. The chicken dish comes with 8 pcs of boneless chicken. It had a distinct taste and i liked it. Ambience is average. They have installed glass facade overlooking James Long Sarani which gets us a nice view. Overall it was a nice experience.

And also it doesn't juiced out ur money. Order only what u likes, good for experiment. Don't go for the foods which isn't their speciality. Loved it from my college days.

It is actually situated on the James Long crossing of Sakherbajar.
The food is average. The plus point is that the place is not over crowded except for during festivals. 
It is cheaper than neighbouring restaurants. 

Carry around 500 for two people.

Paradise has been around since my childhood, and I have visited this place many times for a round of evening snacks with friends.
Although I have rarely tried the main course dishes, as a general statement, I would say, the balance between quality, quantity & pricing is a major plus point of this place.
Negatives - lack of space, hence congested seating & slow service.

I've tasted their Chinese food quite a number of times. They make super tasty noodles. I love their chilly chicken much more than anything other on their menu. 
Would like to try out their momo sometime.

Been a superb restaurant over the years but quality and quantity, both deteriorated since last year. Schezuan dishes are nice though. Drumsticks of Paradise are my all time favourite.
Updated on 24.11.17 : Had steamed momo after a long time. The service still sucks but the momo, oh my my! It filled both the tummy and the heart! Authentic, jumbo sized, juicy delicious momos.

The only shortcoming was the fact that the menu was significantly reduced because of the pujo rush. Otherwise, it's a really pocket-friendly place. The management is far more polite than so many more refined and elite establishments. 
I would highly recommend the Pepper Chicken. Large portions, and surprisingly good taste.

Paradise is located in an unassuming part of the city and IS unassuming in its appearance. I visited the place today (10th Oct, 2016) relying solely on Zomato ratings, burdened with my and my sweetheart's expectations for good, pocket friendly food. We were pleasantly surprised with the portions, quality and taste.
We recommend for decent food at very affordable prices.

Well, Paradise is a very popular Chinese joint for people living in around behala chowrasta and James long . I myself have been here many times since my college days , gorging on the ever so popular " pan fried momos " . But never managed a review , so here is finally my detailed view on how to experience cheap good quality Chinese food in one of the most underrated joints in Behala ,I.e Paradise .

Â° Location :- Those who are familiar with the location of Barisha Club , this joint is located just across the street from the place . 

Â° Ambience & Service ( 2 / 5 ) :- Now this is really an issue here . This is a small eatery so the place us very limited . Moreover in weekends dinner time there are mostly families which make it more crowdy and noisy which makes very irritation to sit and eat . On the top of that due to the  huge number of deliveries and take aways , they take a lot of time to serve the food. This is something they really should look into . You gotta serve your patrons first , the basic rule of every restaurant but it seems they are still uneducated of that belief . So, the best idea would be to order or take away the food from this place .

------------------------------------------

Â° Food :- The real reason i keep coming back instead of experimenting new places all the time is due to the quality of food they serve . And the quality and quantity of food is absolutely fantastic . Last time we had the following :- 

1. Crispy chilli chicken honey ( 4 / 5 ) :-  We were tired with the same type of starters everywhere so we decided to experiment . We went with sweet and spicy and this dish was perfect for our wish. There were 8 crispy and tangy sweet chicken fillets . The size was good and the sauce was perfect for us . We loved it .

2. Chicken chilli garlic noodles ( 5 / 5 ) :- This absolutely deserves a 5 star rating.  You have to have this noodles from here . Especially people who love to have spicy dishes , this is the dish for you. You can easily make out with the color that it will be a spicy affair and we loved it.  A must recommended dish .

3. Egg fried rice ( 3 / 5 ) :- Very basic dish and basic preparation.  Nothing much to say other than the fact that the flavor was okay and the quantity was good.  

4. Green dragon chicken ( 4 / 5 ) :- a perfect side dish.  There were 8 pieces of medium quality sizes with a green ginger garlic spicy gravy . The perfect to go with your fried rice .

A lot of items were not available which we really wanted to try because we were accustomed to them but surprisingly they were not available.  We were really dissapointed by that . But it is recommended to try the following items :- 

1. Panfried momo
2. Sangtu main rice 

-------------------------------------------------------

I was willing to give a 4 star rating . But the ambience , service and unavailability of items prevented me from doing so . But the quality of food cab never be undermined. The food here us really fantastic . 

Following are the main points :- 

1. Awesome Chinese at cheap reasonable rates .
2. Best for takeaway .
3. Pan fried momos are delightful .

People living around behala can  surely try their food and trust me they won't be dissapointed a bit.

Had been eating their momos n the usual indian Chinese fare for yrs ( it happens to be very close to where I live and they do home delivery) Used to absolutely looooove their momos in chicken clear soup till one day I happen to see I open up n ooze out all this (what I assume to be) chicken fat! Stopped ordering their food since then. Most of the food is  pretty decent. Not outstanding nor mind blowing, still good enough for an average day wen u don't wanna cook n don't wanna step out of the house.

Review for Paradise will include the fact that it is the nearest eatery to my house, with seating availability. Food is fantastic starting from their starters, soups, fried rice and noodles. I would especially suggest one to have their Mandarin Fish once in their life, without fail. More a place for ordering home delivery but during Durga Puja, better to sit and eat.

Really love their food .
It's been more than 8 years now since I started eating from here.
I still remember those afternoons where my mum and I ate lunch from here and had a gala mother-daughter time.
However the new staffs seem rude so that's not good.
But the food quality is still amazing.
My favourites are : Steam momo , crispy chilli babycorn and drums of heaven.

First impressions would give you the idea of a restaurant that is in the attic of some room, but once you are inside the restaurant, the ambience is good enough. The chinese cuisine is really good and the pricing is reasonable. Try and order the chicken lollipop/drumsticks when you visit this place. Its really delicious. Giving it a 4.5 coz I think the place is a little small.

Located at Sakherbajar and James Long Sarani crossing, this restaurant serves delicious Chinese cuisine which is sure to water your mouth and increase your appetite any day. But the main issue with this place is the interior space is very small and congested. So whenever there is a rush of people, or all the tables are filled up, the environment becomes very claustrophobic which hampers the comfort level to some extent. But apart from that everything is fine with this place. The service is good and prices are reasonable. 
The interior decor is not a very mesmerizing one but its neat and fine.
A nice place to fill in your hungry stomach and treat your taste buds with some delicious Chinese food as well.

The best place for home - delivery of decent Chinese food if you stay around Behala Chowrasta and Shakherbazar. Very reasonably priced. Wise variety of cuisines on offer. Though constrained in sitting area but prompt in their home - deliveries.  A place you can always fall upon if you have unannounced guests at your place.

I STILL REMEMBER PARADISE HAVE BEEN THE FIRST OUTLET IN BEHALA TO HAVE A VARIED CHINESE MENU.
MOMOS,STARTERS,NOODLES,FRIED RICE,CHICKEN AND PRAWN PREPARATIONS HAVE BEEN ALWAYS GOOD.I DO HAVE COMPLAINTS AT TIMES REGARDING THE QUALITY OF FISH.
GOOD SERVICE ,SOMETIMES FOOD IS SERVED LITLLE LATE,AS THEY HAVE A SMALL KITCHEN COMPARED TO THEIR DEMAND.

This outlet is located in James Long Sarani (Sakherbazaar bypass). To be honest I have never been to this restaurant myself but have ordered Home Delivery multiple times as its near to my house.

So I wont be able to review the ambience / decor / staffs of the restaurant so let me directly jump to Foods which they serve.
I have tried Drums of Heaven, Crispy Chicken Chilly Honey and Golden Fried Prawn in Starters. Normal Chicken Fried Rice, Sezchwan Rice and Hakka Noodles in main course. Chilly Chicken, Manchurian Chicken, Hunan Chicken, Sweet 'N' Sour Chicken in side dish.
I would say they do a very decent job in preparing Chinese Food and there menu is quite full and consists of standard Chinese dishes.

Price is quite reasonable and I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

It's a small restaurant which offers good Chinese food. It's a pocket friendly restaurant too. Their soups are somewhat special. I have been there for many a times and this restaurant didn't lay me down. Their noodles is not that good though they offer good starters. For some quick eat you can definitely go there.

The restaurant is located in sakherbazar near James long sarani. First of all the ambience is okay. Not too good. But its air conditioned so that's a plus! We ordered take-out from here. Service was fast. Didnt have too wait for long. The staff is very well-mannered. 
Now coming to the food, its pretty good. Really good Chinese. We had ordered Veg Noodles and Chilli chicken. Noodles was awesome! Probably the best I've had in a while. Chilli chicken was good too. But the chicken pieces were really small. I would advise them to increase the size of the pieces a bit. Otherwise no complains. Would love to eat here again. Highly recommended to anyone who wants good chinese.

This restaurant is in my locality and we went to have dinner with family. We ordered chicken manchurian but to be very frank i didnt get a single taste as the food was extremely salty. The amount of salt was soo great that it literally made me complain the owner. But the quantity was quite good. The chicken drumsticks and fried rice was up to the mark. The food didnt take long to come and so was quite satisfied with the timings. The place is a small one still the seating arrangements are good and the ambience is soothing with dim lights. On the whole experience was above average by the standards of a local restaurant.

Paradise is an extremely nice restaurant in terms of food quality. I have over the years liked all that I have tried here, starting from a plate of simple pan fried chicken momo to the main courses. However the biggest area where they can improve on is their service time. They take forever to serve the food. I don't what takes them so much time. I can grow a mustache waiting for the food post ordering! :-)

Great location, prices are fine. Overall satisfactory.

Paradise used to be my favorite eating zone till about two years ago. Their food was always bang on. I would love their dry chilli chicken which tasted just perfect. Fried Rice and Chilli chicken from Paradise was like comfort food for me and on almost every second weekend we would order  Chilli Garlic Hakka noodles for home delivery.

But off late I have noticed, that the quantity of food has reduced, and the prices have increased a lot. That would have still been okay, but they also have compromised on the taste. My last visit (my first after its renovation) was a bad experience. Firstly, the wall of the first floor and only seating area facing the road is entirely made from dark glass, so on a hot, burning afternoon it felt like a pressure cooker. The a.c was switched off initially as there were no other guests there and was switched on once we were seated, and then we were told that the only a.c there was not functioning properly. It was about 1.30 a.m in the afternoon and we sat there, sweating. We order just fried rice and chilli chicken because I knew that would never be a letdown but I was wrong. The rice tasted very bland and the quantity was not even close to enough for two people. There was very little gravy in the chilli chicken and I felt that the size of the pieces had also been reduced. We ordered some fizzy drinks which were chilled at the right temperature so that was one positive factor. The a.c did not manage to remotely cool the room, and I think they should install one more to cool the 20+ seater space. Overall we were disappointed as we have had a way better experience with paradise previously.

Food: 2/5

Service: 3/5

Ambience:1.5/5 

Value for Money : 2.5/5

yesterday's dinner came from paradise !! 
we ordered 1 Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice (Mixed) and 1 Kung Pao chicken !!! for takeaway

ok let's me start with the Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice (Mixed) in one word Awesome!!
the rice was well cooked !! pieces of prawns chickens eggs with pieces of ginger hmmm just wow!!! ^_^ i didn't find capsicum though :P i thought it would be some ginger type rice or so :v anyways it was much better than the normal fried rices !!

next comes the Kung Pao chicken !! it was good but the chicken pieces were little bit on the harder side :/ it tasted good but the hard chicken played the role of evil :3 the gravy that was provided was awesome!!! all was good expect the chicken hardness :3

in total i would rate paradise 3.5 out of 5 !!

Located on James long ,sakherbajar, this restaurant (but more of a street side take away) serves Chinese exclusively. I have had their steamed momos before (rs.80) and it was quite decent.
Today I ordered a home delivery of mixed chowmein and honey and lemon chicken. The order came at precisely the time they promised.
The mixed chowmein came in a pretty good quantity with respect to the price (rs.110) and was delicious too.
The honey lemon chicken (rs.140) was a huge disappointment. It was one of those unlucky days, both for them and for me. The chicken was bitter. Yes bitter due to the bitter lemon, like old lemon getting bitter, yeah you get the drift. It was inedible. So I called them up and they promised to replace it, not with the same dish but something else. I had to be happy with that as I had no more energy to quarrel.
I appreciated the fact that the replacement was prompt (within 15mins of complain). Although I am not sure what the replacement food was. It looked like chilly chicken but was sweet, with a distinct tomato puree taste. But it was okay so I don't mind so much.
Overall it was a 'could have been a good experience' gone wrong. The cook is to blame may be, but the service and management were commendable.

I have been frequenting this place since they renovated it.

I hang out near this eating joint and never really thought about eating here until a friend suggested me to try their momos.

So I went there with my boyfriend, one fine evening to grab some momos.

The seating area is on the 1st floor. the decor is nothing extraordinary and not really boring as well. it was clean and comfortable.

We ordered a basic steamed chicken momo and Pan Fried Crispy Chilli chicken.

It took them close to 30mins to serve our food.

But when the food came, we were surprised to see the quantity. biiiiiig momos and biiiiig pieces of crispy chilli chicken.

when I took the first bite of my momo, I realised the fuss my friend made when I told her unconvincingly that I will check this place out someday.

the momos were very tasty.

and the chilli chicken was just yummmm... 

2nd visit was paid when we were craving for that sweet and spicy crispy chicken. and this time it took them 15 minutes to serve our food.

Yes, you might have problems regarding the time they take to serve but once the food comes, your problem will fade away.

I plan to have dinner here someday. 

Go visit this place. :)

Coming to the point...for starters we took chicken drums of heaven which is no less than "heavenly"...(which is why i wl visit here again in a few days) :p then coming to the main course...I tried their schezwan mixed rice & shredded chicken garlic which is awesome!! My friend took mixed fried rice with chilli chicken which i have tasted & it also tastes a 1000 bucks!! Even their dessert section which is very limited is also a marvel!! hope to visit here within a week!! :D

Hmmm...so these is synonymous to comfort..if u r thinking about soup chicken obviously in Chinese side then its a worth to try for..its chicken items, specially the dry ones are just yummm...if you order a shop like monchow and honey chicken sesame seeds on top of it....arghhh!!! Its devilishly good..there all chicken siders are ginger lickingly good..now if we come to min course that's where they lack....the biggest draw back is their fried rice though the noodles are slightly better but not up to the mark..for me if u go there have soups.chicken and fish siders...though I heard they serve good chop suey but I never tried that..so no comments...now the price its obviously reasonable and with the new sitting arrangements renovations the ambience is another thing to attract u...and its a fee mnts walk from my home it pulls me again and again...and yeah they provide home delivery too....

Earlier the place was pretty small and claustrophobic but after the renovation they have improved the interiors. Always used to get home deliveries of the lip smacking delicacies on their menu. Pan fried chilli chicken and momos have always been my personal favourites. As for noodles and rice each portion is sufficient for two people with normal appetite. Both in terms of quality and quantity the food is satiable and moreover it is also reasonably priced. There can be further improvement in terms of service to adequately complement the food they serve. Overall a pretty decent experience.

Paradise is a place you must try if you want good quality food, that you'll remember for a very long time. They have a small set up, so I would suggest you to go for TAKE AWAY / HOME DELIVERY. My all time favorite dishes would be -Â 
1. Drums of Heaven
2. Momo (Steamed / Fried, whatever)
3. Crispy Paneer Chilly Honey Sauce
4. Crispy Chilli Baby Corn
5. Lat Me Kai

Others are also equally good...

Paradise? Oh really! Then should be paradise of small pieces of extra soft and small pieces of chiken. I have been to here for several times each and every time chiken were so small in pieces. Ambience is not that much well managed as per the rates of the foods. But they are selling best hakka noodles in behala I guess. But one of my friend said they noodles were not so tasety. So here comes the question of maintaining the quality of the food? Guys please be consistent. Oh yeah that was a funny experience being a fan of seafood I ordered the hot and sour fish.... How was it? That seemed good to me.

Small yet well managed...this is the first thought that came across my mind when I first visited this hotspot at Sakherbazar. As a takeaway I ordered for Chicken Hakka Noodles. TheyÂ  served the food within 10 min as they estimated the time to be. The food was appetizing....and it was super delicious and super awesome. Specially the sauces they provided along with the noodles gave this dish a unique taste which is worth remembering. Another reason to visit this place for the second time is because of its price. Reasonable and pocket-friendly.

I have been a very old customer with them. Started visiting and ordering from them since the year 2006 or so. The quality of food used to be awesome till a point, however since 2009 or so the quality of food has gone down drastically. Also the rates have also gonew up quite a bit. I used to recommend this place to a lot of friends and relatives but lately I think the overall experience has become very sorrow. The delivery service has also become quite sad as compared to before. Overall not satisfied with their present strategy of getting business as the quality has taken a very big hit.
Luckily there are a few other options available for home delivery or to eat out these days in that area. Â Not satisfied !!

This  is  a  small  place...nothing  very  impressive  to  look  at  ,  but   serves  good  food! Have  friends  who    swear  on  this  place  as  a   place   that  serves  good  food  at  reasonable  rates...Had  tasted  their  Drums  of  Heaven  once a   few months  back ,  and  was  not  disappointed!  The  food  tasted  quite   good ,  and  the  quantity  was  fine...  the  seating  place  was a  bit  cramped ,  so   a  take -out  might be  a  better  idea! However   the restaurant  is    now  under  renovation and   there  is  a   number   for  home  delivery  facilities....  Hope  they  shall  be  back  with  a  bang  soon    ,  with  some   more  delicious food  to  offer  and  some cozy interiors for  a  good  dining  experience !

Paradise - A Good place in Behala as compared to the other eateries. 
------------------------
Brief:
I had been to paradise during the Durga Puja time. It is not a huge place to eat but a very small place where you can grab a meal and leave. Not a very extraordinary place but a very simple place which serves chinese food at a good speed ( Not Rapid). However, this place works really well.
------------------------
Food Ordered: 

1) Chilli Chicken - It was tasty but oil content was high.
2) Fried Rice - The fried rice was still you can say okay. 
------------------------
Summary:
Food presentation 3/5
Food quality 3.5/5
Food quantity 4/5
Hospitality 4/5
------------------------
Conclusion: 

For non vegetarians, a very good place as its pocket friendly too. :) Vegetarians: Sorry, Not recommended from my side.

FOOD "PARADISE" IN BEHALA!
3.5 out of 5

Paradise restaurant in Behala is definitely a food paradise. It is one of those restaurants where you get not only pocket friendly but tasty Chinese fare. For those on a tight budget, this is one option that will never fail you. This is a simple and uncluttered establishment. Though the place is plain and simple looking; it is neat and clean. The place is also a great option for take away and home delivery. 

Though it is a small food joint, the place exudes coziness and comfort. The food takes very little time to be served; this is because of the efficient and well trained staff of the restaurant that this is so. 

Their vegetarian and non vegetarian options as starters and side dishes are many and varied. To begin with, their veg and chicken momos as snack options are not only tasty but filling as well. Equally popular are their other veg and non veg items like drums of heaven, lat Mei kai, pepper chicken, golden fried prawns and many more; and veg starters like chilli mushroom, chilli baby corn and chilli potato. They make some of the best well seasoned food in the whole of Behala.  Their soups (like tom yum soup, hot and sour soup, and manchow soup) have the power to drive away all your blues. The broth is not only well prepared but the flavours of spiciness and tanginess in the soup are well balanced. Their rice and noodle staples are scrumptious and stomach filling options. 

The well priced food is not only tasty but generous in quantity as well. One person might face a problem in finishing the dish that he has ordered for himself. At the same time, the quality of food can be compared to those being served by high end restaurants.

People who've stated about hygiene here are pretentious bourgeois's who can't afford a stereotypical decked up restaurant with moderate food and yet grumble about quality with whatever they afford. For the kind of food at the price at the locality it is in its wonderful. Its a little shady but good food. The soups are amazing. 
P.S: its a rear place in behala which serves pan friend chow! Enjoy.

It was because there was no other choice in that area that I entered Paradise. A small and insignificant restaurant. First time I went there because I did not find any other place to eat around that area but right after the meal was served I realised it was quite a discovery. The food was just excellent. And this was 6 years back. Since then I have enjoyed meals at Paradise on a regular basis. I have tried almost all their dishes and liked every single one of them. I have taken my friends along and they have all appreciated their food. I have had meals at some of the good restaurants in Kolkata and abroad, but the food at Paradise will always keep you enchanted. Believe you me!

Excessive chilli added to any given dishes making it very hot for normal palate. Rice used in fried rice is of very poor quality. Soup is better as compared to other dishes.

I am surprised that no one reviewed this restaurant yet.  This place every is very small and mainly for home delivery.  I have been over here more than once. I can guarantee you that you will never get a better Chinese food in this budget. The people in this shop are passionate about cooking. There are numerous mouthwatering dishes to try for. 
If you reside in behala and have never been to this place then visit it once, you would never repent. 

The restaurant is now closed.
