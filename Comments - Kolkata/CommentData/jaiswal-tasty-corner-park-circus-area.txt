Their puri bhaji is great!
Crispy puris with a hint of asafoetida served with potato and chana gravy packed with spices will win your heart the moment you taste it!!!
Jalebis are big,crispy not too syrupy but tasty for sure!!!
And their Gulab Jamun!!!How can i not mention it?? It's meltingly soft,spongy dipped in delicious flavoured sugar syrup..I really like the way these jamuns taste in the centre..that part is a little stiff and tastes very khoya-ish and I find it heavenly lol it's really hard to describe what it's like in words so please go and eat some as I believe their jamuns are as delectable as the ones you would get in the famous sweet shops of the city!!

I have know this place since childhood.
Our Sunday breakfasts were incomplete without their kachori, sabji and jalebis.
I might have grown out of the kachori phase but the jalebis are still a constant. The kachori and sabji they serve might not be the best in the city but it still lives up to its reputation.
Also, if you ever find yourself in this little outlet don't forget to get a taste of their Gulab jamun.

This place have had garnered a goodwill for its kachori - jalebi. Well and they justify it!

It is located few blocks from Syed Amir Ali Avenue on Beckbagan, being very near to Quest Mall and Mithai Sweet Shop. It is situated below a residential complex taking full advantage of it.

I have tried both the kachoris as well as jalebis and you are sure to like it. Even the gulab jamun are worthy of praise.

A very much recommended outlet!!

Gud place for a evening snack or a kachori breakfast
Gulab jamun is a starer.
Jalebi is great too.
Coming to kachori 
The alu veggie is awsome. 
Kachori is okayish . If not eaten warm it will.be hard . The rava containt makes it heavy.

Location: Opposite Quest mall, take the lane beside Mithai and head straight till u find a junction, you'll find this shack right at the corner.

I eat here often whenever I'm low on cash or I feel like having kachoris and gulab jamuns.

Their kachoris are delicious. Perfectly what we call 'khasta' and the 'aloo matar subzi' served along side the hot kachoris is yumm!

But what steals the show, for me, is their gulab jamum. O my God! I cannot ever have enough of those. Perfectly soft and warm, just melts in your mouth. Those are to die for.
Do give this shack a try. 

Kachoris - 5 bucks per piece
Gulab jamun- 5 bucks per piece!

One hell of a hidden gem shop in Kolkata. With multiple upstarts coming up almost every single day, there are still some restaurants which has been able to retain their share of glory and popularity and this is one of them.

Located near Beckbagan Market, I happen to be a huge fan of their hot Kachoris and Sabjis. Though a tad bit oily, the Kachoris go very well with the delicious and tasty Sabji. You have them as much as you like and then for a sweet ending, dive into the hot and crispy Jalebis.

There has hardly been such a sweet ending to a fairy tale and there hardly would be any such, ever again! Does it deserve a recommendation? For sure, it does!

Passing by this place regularly and noticing a crowd always, I wanted to try this place once.i reached there on an evening and called for a place of kachori, the kachori was oily but the sabji with it was quiet nice. I finished my meal with yummy jalebis :) satisfied enough I decided to carry home some gulab jamuns which were quiet decent.

Hidden gems are something, people are either unknown of or tend to forget in their pursuit to fit in the upcoming trend. Such so, because most of these hidden gems are by far one of the oldest ones standing the test of time. But, when these hidden gems are linked to memories, one would never be able to forget them. Jaiswal Snacks Corner is one such place which slowly with the onset of the healthy era has experienced a shadowing effect. It has been overshadowed by the healthy alternatives that people have started opting to.

Going back in time, JSC has been here for ages now and has in the literal sense stood the test of time. Serving the people of City of Joy with delicious snack-type items (available at their adjacent outlet), jalebis, gulab jamuns and hot kachoris accompanied along with Aloo Sabji (potato curry), this place hasn't lost the charm yet. Though there are lot more places adjacent to Jaiswals offering the same fare but, this place has been the most frequented one.

After years, happened to cross by this place and it was a definite drop by.
Called for a plate of Kachoris which weren't fluffy enough but, definitely piping hot. Served with a flavorful Aloo Sabji, the oily kachoris did taste nice. At times, the oil content doesn't hurt much but yes, the greasiness could be lowered.

The staff were as usual friendly (and kept forcing me to take a couple more; nostalgic) and the service was prompt.
The prices wouldn't pinch your pocket at all.

Though the experience was a decent one, the nostalgic element does make me smile.

It was around 12 pm and i was wanting to eat puri sabji because its winters and whether its morning , noon or night your puri sabji sets the foodoholic mark always up and mood uplifting .
That's what happened with me at least this time cause I usually eat my sandwiches or other english breakfast of corn flakes , porridge , milk, fruits and other heavy nutrition based meals , but I wanted to give a change and I always love experimenting with the right food so this time I decided to head to this puri sabji shop which is located exactly near park circus market area to be more precise if you are near quest mall then locate Mithai shop and walk straight towards the lane and you will spot three puri sabji stalls ( jaiswal ,bhagat one more i forgot the name ) lined up nicely with the men outside surrounded with puris in the basket and sabji in the utensils below .
The one I went was Jaiswal tasty corner and he had his shop kept very clean which is really a very good thing because hygiene is very appealing if you want to eat foods like this on street , so i had some puris firstly and to be honest the very first puri i ate i immedietly went back to get more puris as well as sabji cause it was really delicious , hot and fresh which you usually don't get everywhere , it was something different from the regular places where you stand and eat but don't get the perfect stuff.
Then after that lovely food I I saw some nice sweets in those big steel drums like gulab jamun and jalebi floating in the sugary syrup which is all made hot and hot so you can imagine how good it is to eat those .
After trying this place I am definetly coming back here for a tasty puri sabji experience once more.

It's located near park circus market, the bhaji puri and gulab jamun are tasty. It opens quite early on the morning. It tastes best when you eat hot puris standing there. It's not a dine in, so family people need to get take away.

Love the place. One of the best place to have bhaji puri. I always eat bhaji puri there whenever i pass from that place. It's a must try. Apart from that the sweets are even tasty and at last the tea served there is just exceptional but the taste is always not the same but that's ok with me.
