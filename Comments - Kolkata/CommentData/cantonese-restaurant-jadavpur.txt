Located near to Jadavpur 8b bus stand, this place is a hidden gem. Extremely good ambience coupled with delicious food...maifoon noodles, roasted chilli chicken, devils lamb, garlic pepper chicken for starters...each item was delicious. The only negative was the time taken to serve the food...very courteous behaviour by waiters as well. Would love to visit this place again.

Located opposite to Jadavpur University, Cantonese Restaurant is an attractive spot for Sea food delicacies. Apart from enjoying the advantage of easy access to the main road, Cantonese is hailed for its speciality in Chinese, Thai and Cantonese cuisines. 

We ordered Phuket fish, Exotic Mushroom Pot rice (chicken) and Samurai Chicken. 

The Phuket fish was served as two pieces of bhetki tossed with veggies which turned out to be exquisite. Strongly recommended!

The Exotic Mushroom Pot rice served in an earthen pot cooked decently with chunks of mushroom and chicken. Tasted okay. 

The Samurai Chicken : Chicken pieces cooked in moderately spicy gravy with bell peppers and onions. This was nothing unique, just an amalgamation of few flavours. Tasted fine.

Safe to call it a dimly lit average décor restaurant where one can enjoy tasty food without burning a hole in pocket.

So,
Food: 3.5/5
Ambience: 3.5/5
Cleanliness: 3/5
Service: 3.5/5
Value for money: 4/5

I did not expect this to be as good as it is. For starters it is a dimly lit cozy place with really well behaved hosts!!! Now the all important food, there is a lot of really awesome dishes for you and we were really happy to try out roasted chicken wings, sumptuous nasi goreng and tasty thai chilli chicken!!!! One thing that is for sure is I'm coming here soon!!!!

This place is situated in Jadavpur near 8B bus stand. They serves good chinese food. We had momo, chilli pork and noodles. Food was really nice. Quantity of noodles was more than sufficient but but quantity of pork should be increased compared with the price.

One of the best in town with their seafood delicacies. 
The appetizers are great. You might fill yourself up just by having them. 
They serve a large variety of noodles, meifoon,rice etc. to choose from. 
If you visit this place try and have things which you don't have on a regular basis. 
Go for squid, octopus,lamb,pork, prawns. 
They make it really great. 
I would like to suggest them to add more choice from Squid and Octopus. 
Also they should keep the price and quantity at this range. 
They'll have more customers and more customers. 
If you are from JU come here today itself. 
It's just opposite to 8B gate.

We have ordered the following dishes French Kiss and Virgin Mojito - These were the two mock-tails and out of these French Kiss was just Wow and other one was so soCrispy Chilli Babycorn and Drums of Heaven - it was good in taste although not good as Bawarchi , specially Crispy Chilli Baby CornHakka Noodles Chicken and Noodles s/z style Chicken - s/z style was not at all good in taste and was very rich and noodles were very thin  Sweet&Sour Chicken - It was good in taste Regarding the ambiance it was good for couple or family both although it is a small restaurant with a dim light (which makes it more romantic ;) )Restaurant stuff was also very nice and helpful .In summary it is good restaurant and you can check this out and value for money My only suggestion to the hotel crew is to take more importance in food quality, it need to be more testy and less spicy.  Below is my review rating  in each section.

On 1st January 2018, me and my bae 😋 went there. After waiting for approx 45 mins finally we got a chance to get a table. We ordered Drums of heaven, pan fried cantonese noodles, samurai chicken and darshan with icecream. The quantity and quality is very good and Pan fried noodles is a must try for everyone. The only thing it lacks is the prompt service of waiters. We waited for 20-25 mins for each item we ordered. I recommend this restaurant provided get enough time in your watch as it is a slow mo service.

First of all, apologies for sitting on this review for weeks.. I am really getting lazy. Now down to business, went there for a family lunch and was blown away by their food. This was TASTY to the T!! This is easy to locate (just beside NIIT in Jadavpur). 

We ordered the following :
Pan Fried Chilli Fish - Phenomenal!! This was the best. The taste, the softness of the fish, the gravy, everything was awesome. We ordered another plate for takeaway.
Oyster Chicken - Very good. Not very spicy, yet not bland (most restaurants tend to serve bland food in the name of non spicy food). I loved it.
Pan Fried Noodles Cantonese Style - One of the best gravy noodles in town. The veggies and pieces of chicken were in plenty. Yum!!
Veg Fried Rice - Old but gold!! The fried rice was good too!

Notes- The quantity is pretty good. It serves two.
Also, the much fabled Prawn Chips (complementary) is a bit over hyped. It is good, but it's like any other prawn chip available in your local store.
This place is value for money. One of the best and underrated places.

Located at a very accessible area of Jadavpur but slightly difficult to locate. They serve complimentary Prawn Chips which is nice. Did't go crazy ordered the usual Drums of Heaven, Korean Fried Rice and Roasted Chilli Lamb. Chicken Drums were good. Rice was nice and different but the Lamb was less in quantity and okayish.

Ambience is normal type though, but the food and the hospitality takes the cake.
Ordered chicken fried rice, roasted chilli pork and samurai chicken.
Let me tell you, if you are going to a place for the first time, then fried rice is the safest thing you can order 😜
Fried rice did not have a generous amount of chicken though, but it was amazing.
Samurai chicken went too well with that and it was light as well. 
And now talking about the roasted chilli pork, oh my god!! IT TASTED LIKE HEAVEN!!
Pork lovers please. Do not miss it!!

Going to visit again. Highly recommended!

The Thai grilled fish is so so. The complimentary prawn chips and sauce is also very good. The mixed fried rice and chicken Hakka noodles is standard. The roast chilli chicken is truly nice.

Sort of difficult to locate if you don't know 8B well, but ask around and it'll suffice.
Considering there is no dearth of Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, still went there because we couldn't get a seat anywhere else on Nabami. So my review is based on that sole visit (no pictures because we reached at around 4, famished).
Stuck to the usual chicken fried rice and garlic chicken.
Chicken pieces were not adequate. Fried rice quantity was also very, VERY less. Usually one plate fills 2 of us up very easily, this time it failed to. And the money is high considering their quantity or quality neither were too great.
The Calcutta Bistro that's 5 mins away is a much better option, so this place can be given a miss. Unless your luck isn't favouring you like mine didn't that day.

This restaurant is a relatively new one near Jadavpur 8B bus stand. It has plethora of sea food in its menu so sea food lovers must give this place a try. I went to this restaurant on my birthday to treat my friends and we all were very impressed by their food quality ,taste and ambience. I would surely recommend the babycorn,mushroom and spinach dish as an accompaniment with burnt garlic fried rice or meifoon. The chicken fried rice ,chilli wine fish and devils chicken were delectable. Also ,my friends tried sweet and sour chicken for the first time and loved it. They had offered us prawn chips as complementary food. For refreshing drinks ,we ordered french kiss and virgin mojito. Both were soothingly fresh. The songs were serene,the interiors simple and calm. Do give this place a try for hanging out with friends and family.

Amongst the few good eateries near Jadavpur 8B, this is indeed one of them from the perspective of good food and value for money. Specialises mostly in chinese and oriental cuisine, even got a touch of seafood too. To get our fork & knife running we settled for,
•French Kiss: not as tasty as the name but will surely quench your thirst.
•Pan Fried Dimsum: 6 pieces of fully stuffed chicken dimsum of good size tossed in a tangy sauce.
•Exotic Mushroom Pot Rice: definitely the name did the justice, served in a earthen pot the aroma will surely bring water to your mouth. Chuncks of mushroom was distinctive, had some sweet corns too.
•Roasted Chili Chicken: no mercy shown on the exotic rice, poured water in all the expectations, should have went for any other option.
Floor space is a bit on the smaller size, need to work on the interiors alot. This is amongst those budget friendly deliveries as zomato likes to call, this will go easy on the pocket. No fancy stuffs can be expected out of this place, you came to eat, have the food and go home. Even though some dishes will surprise you quiet often.
P.S.: complementary prawn papad is served to get things started.

Located at jadavpur 8b. Been there for the first time at asthami night. This place has some extremely delicious food with less oil and good quantity. We ordered Malaysian pepper chicken as a starter, mushroom mixed pot rice, mixed fried rice and samurai chicken. Malaysian grilled chicken tasted so good that all the flavours and ingredients had been tasted. Both the mixed fried rice were so good and different from other Chinese restaurants. Samurai chicken contained 10 pieces of chicken and taste was heavenly.
Beyond this all, the thing which has to mentioned is their service. The staffs over there waited for us to complete our photo session and then came to serve us and each time we completed one dish they immediately came. For their service I will give them a review of 5 :)

On Navami , we decided to have our dinner in Cantonese when we were passing by. I never had anything from this joint before but, I knew about this place from my friends . So we opted for it. When we got into the place, there was a queue , we waited for near about 20 minutes. 
When we entered into this joint, i really liked their simple decor. The Staffs were extremely cordial. 
We opted for mixed Lung fong soup, Devil 's Lamb, oyster chicken, Mixed Meifoon and Cantonese Pan fried noodles. We all were satisfied with the quality and quantity,  Cantonese pan fried noodles  and Devil's lamb both were awesome in my view.  
I liked this joint even more because, even during this Puja crowd, the quality and hospitality remained top-notch. I would love to come back here.

This restaurant is located near 8b bus stand. 
We decided to have yesterday's dinner there. This restaurant was open last year before Durga Puja. I had tried then once. And this was the second time. 
The best thing about this place is they don't let  customers get bored  waiting for the food. So they provide chips in a cute bucket with a great sauce to go with. 
We ordered prawn tempora first. Usually prawn tempora is a little crispy but it wasn't there !
Next we had pan Fried fish which was still good.
We ordered pan fried mixed noodles which according to me was perfect with enough mushroom, prawns and sliced chicken. Right amount of fried noodles and right amount of gravy. But the quantity was very less. Wasn't even enough for two people to share one plate. 
They recommended us to have grilled chilli chicken with the noodles. Grilled chilli chicken sounded a bit different from the normal chilli chicken that we have. So I wanted to taste that. It was really good but nothing great. The pieces were too small.

They garnish their food very well. But what is  saddening is the food quantity is not at all sufficient.

 This isn't an expensive restaurant. But yet again I'd say the quantity of food is very very less.

Located near Jadavpur 8B...This one's a nice place with some tasty dishes under their hood... :)
Went there on Saptami with three friends...Had a nice lovely dinner...
Dishes we tried :-

Thai Grilled Fish --- This one was surely the showstopper for us that night...Delicious...perfectly cooked...so soft...so tastyyy... 😆😆
The housemade sauce served with it deserves special mention too...It certainly kicked the taste of the fish up a notch!!! 😀😀 So this one's a must try dish out here.. 😎

Pan Fried Noodles Cantonese Style(Non-Veg) --- This one also tasted lovely...much better than any hakka noodles out there...Was full of chicken pieces and veggies...Had some crispy fried noodles on the side as well... Do try this one out if you're having noodles here :)

Samurai Chicken --- Yeah this interesting name caught our attention and we ordered it...It had sliced capsicum pieces(green n yellow as well) and onions as well and looked much like any chilli chicken kinda chinese dish...But the twist lied somewhere else...It had some kinda sliced mushroom pieces in it...
Now mushroom haters like me myself...No worries required here...It doesn't make the chicken taste bad or something...The dish tasted fine..in fact quite yummy... Went well with the Burnt Garlic Rice we took :)

Burnt Garlic Rice(Mix) --- And this one was also fine...Had chunks of prawn chicken and egg as expected...In one word it was Flavoursome :)

Blue Lagoon --- The taste was nice n fine...Just the size of the glass was too small 😂

So overall it was a nice dining experience here...😀
Cheers!!! 👍✌😎

The place is very easy to find, located beside the xerox gully... The place is quite spacious and the ambience is so nice.
Now let me come to the main attraction of this place.
Food here is the best. Literally the very best. The quality is sumptious too. 
We ordered a crab meat soup (which we dint expect to get  during pujo but it was available) that was so delicious with butter garlic squid as an appetizer.  It was really a very good appetizer and it made us eat even more...you could actually feel the delicate tastes of butter and garlic in your mouth.
Then we opted for a mushroom pot mixed rice which was served very hot and it is the best fried rice i have ever had. There was a certain flavour to it and it will keep you addicted. From one fried rice..we took three helpings each for two persons.
And also the chilly prawn in oyster sauce..with really soft prawn which melted in my mouth.
Even after that i had brownie with ice cream which was served with utmost care... 
Extra points for the polite and curteous stuff. 
The food may seem slightly expensive at the first glance..but believe it or not.. PAISAVASOOL!!

Went there for lunch yesterday. The place was almost full when we reached there at around 3pm. We, however, got a table within 5 minutes. We ordered the veg hakka noodles and oyster chicken(as suggested by the staff). Food arrived after 15 minutes waiting but was worth the wait. Both noodles and the chicken tasted well. One plate of noodles will well suffice for 2 medium eaters and the chicken dish had got 10 pieces of chicken in it. Overall satisfied.

I visited Cantonese today and I wasn't very hungry when I was there. So, we ordered the following:
1. Veg Noodles: Firstly, the quantity was huge. It tasted just fine. I just hope that they serve the thick Noodles. I personally don't prefer the thin ones.
2. Chicken Tom Yum Soup: It's served with mushroom, chicken and thai herbs. Initially it tasted good but eventually the thai herbs turned out to be very spicy and didn't taste very well.
3. Roasted Chilli Pork: I am a pork lover. So when I saw the menu card with pork and lamb section I got excited and wanted to try this dish. The taste was pretty good. The quantity was very less. They didn't serve much fat. It was more of meat. They need to find out the right proportion of the meat and the fat.

I would definitely want to try out other food items here and then come back and maybe rate it a little higher. The seating is comfortable and is perfect for the ones who need food, AC and when in 8B ;p

Really had a lovely experience in this chinese cum thai restaurant located in Jadavpur 8b bus stand area. The decor is nice and staffs are courteous. The gesture of welcoming us with complementary prawn chips was lovely. We had virgin mojito and soft drinks as coolers and malaysian grilled chicken as starter. Its a unique type of grilled chicken prepared in a spicy Malaysian sauce- very tender and tasty. In mains we had non veg fried rice with samurai chicken. The rice contained plenty of prawns and chicken pieces and quantity was adequate for two of us. Samurai chicken is a unique dish tasted first time and heard first time as well.10 soft chicken pieces prepared in a brown medium spicy gravy with bell peppers. Loved this item with the fried rice. Will like to revisit this place to taste their plenty of chinese dishes.

Located in Jadavpur, near 8B bus stand.
Not very spacious, minimalistic decor.
You get a basket of complementary prawn chips with your order.
Tasted the much talked about pan fried chilli fish. I like my pan fried fish a bit crispy and crusty. This was a bit too soft to my standards. The fish was fresh and its tasted good though.
Chicken hakka noodles and Hunan chicken was good. Nothing extraordinary. Quantity was good.
Would like to try the sea food here as well.
Staff courteous and service fast.

Full marks on food ; no doubt about it. But the main problem is they lacked punctuality. Ordered a chicken clear soup, 2 chicken fried rice & 1 chicken with oyster sauce. After giving away the starters they took freaking 30 minutes for the arrival of the main course. Staff is friendly & courteous and the ambience is also good.

Located near Jadavpur market, Cantonese, a new restaurant around 10 months old is all set to give tough competition to other dine out restaurants in the area. Its not a very big restaurant but it serves food that tickles your taste bud. This was my second visit and I am overwhelmed with the quality,quantity and the taste of the dishes that they serve. For starters we had Bar B Que chicken,sizzled chicken and pan fried chili fish. Each one excellent. We also tried Lung Fung soup it was amazing. Main course comprised of exotic mushroom pot rice,meinfoon noodles,garlic chicken and roasted chili pork. Each of the preparations would make you more hungry. As per our requirement the pork that was served was fat free which you hardly get in any restaurant. Cherry on the cake was virgin mojito,best till date. Keep up the great service. Guys make sure to visit this place if you are around jadavpur.

If you have quality, you will certainly make your mark, and the rest will just fall into place. A small restaurant this, but do not take them for their size. The food is top class. We had ordered Chicken Lollipop, Chicken Meifoon, Hunan Chicken, Chicken Korean Fried Rice, Lat Me Kai, Diced Chicken in Chilli Sauce.We were gut-foundered by the time the food had arrived and it certainly did not fail to satiate our hunger. The Lollipop and Lat Me Kai were ambrosial. The others were equally up to the task and the Hunan Chicken certainly deserves a special mention. Highly impressed by the food and what's coming up next is certainly a visit to this restaurant in order to experience the ambience and the service. Never compromise on quality and you will be around for ages.... Look for short cuts and you will be another one lost in the mists of time.

If you opt for fish, fish cooked in oyster sauce or yellow bean sauce, chilli wine fish are worth mentioning. The fried ice-cream is okay-ish, the skin is a little soggy and almost resembles a gulab jamun.

Cantonese Restaurant, well, this is relatively a new kid in the town compared to other legendary / well known Chinese food joints in the town. But, it does show the potential to become one for sure. 

Located beside HDFC bank near Jadavpur 8B bus stand, this food joint provides more than descent Chinese delicacies in the town. It is situated on the first floor of the building. From outside it might look like a small joint. But, inside it is quite specious. The décor is nothing fancy overall a nice, comfortable & smoothing ambience. The service is reasonably fast & the staffs are well mannered.

 Coming to food, we (two of us) opted for a chicken Dimsum as starter and the mains & side dish we decided on Burnt Garlic Rice & Roasted Pork Chili. Now, first thing first.. they serve complementary prawn chips with fish sauce before your actual order comes to your table. Regarding the dimsum, the  presentation was super as they came in a covered basket. They tested fresh & moist.  The riced was flavorful & the chili pork was super tasty. Even if I would have liked the quantity in the Pork item a bit more (that’s might be my problem also.. as I can’t get enough of Pork anywhere). The quantity of other items was more than decent. A big thumbs up.  

Verdict, make a note to visit this joint if you feel like having Chinese once you are in & around Jadavpur area. I would definitely like to visit again. And yes, it does have the potential to become a well-known Chinese food joint in near future. Keep up the good work.

Pleasant & Refreshing!
I ordered home delivery from this restaurant & got my taste buds drown in ecstasy!
For starters we had
1)Malaysian grilled chicken(order MUST , it's too delicious) and
2)Crispy octopus takrai style(this was my first time trying octopus & if not awesome but taste was very nice at that ! Only negative point that it was slightly on the oily side ).
Main course
3)stir fried chicken with exotic vegetables (light gravy ,non oily, not spicy, yet the moment you mouth it, becomes a DELIGHTFUL bomb to your palate!
Noodles
4) Mixed meifoon noodles (Believe me,it works wonders as it rises as the HERO & complements any-simply any... sidekick dishes you want it to accompany you with)(1 plate/serving is perfect for 2 people if you are normal hungry, help yourself to more servings of this wonderful dish as your appetite would boom as you become greedily hungry while feasting on it)
That's the end(rather a halt to) of my mouthwatering adventure for NOW! I Will be resuming soon! So you better DIG IN everyone!
P.S: Value for money! It's a light pull on your pocket too! And won't weight on your guilty pleasure treasury! Happy Eating!

I just returned home after a delectable meal here at Cantonese and I simply cannot resist the urge to pen down my experience here.
First off, the ambience is quite nice, simply decorated and perfect for hanging out with with friends. No doubt it has gained quite the popularity among the young crowd. The staff is extremely well behaved , helpful and courteous. After ordering ,while you wait, they serve you prawn chips with garlic sauce. This was something different and fresh in a restaurant that I haven't noticed elsewhere.
Coming to the food, I had ordered the Pan Fried Cantonese Noodles only since I was alone. The dish was served with fresh vegetables containing capsicums, cauliflower, baby corn, mushrooms, prawns of amazing quality and equally tasty chicken and succulent pork along with zucchini and spinach. The noodles were crispy on the surface and soft under it. The flavour was outstanding with perfect blend of meat and veggies. The oil used was of high quality. To sum it up, this was definitely one of the best Pan fried noodles I've ever had. Dying to go back and taste the other dishes as well. Loved it!!

Located near HDFC Bank branch Jadavpur and at the Jumbo Xerox Goli, this restaurant has become quite popular among youngsters. Though the restaurant looks small from outside, it is quite spacious and comfortable to be at. The décor is simple yet nice. The staffs are extremely courteous and friendly. I hope they keep up such a good level of hospitality. Their service was quick. And, their washroom maintenance should really be appreciated.

The moment you enter and take a seat, they offer you not only water and the menu card but also a small basket-full prawn papads and a small bowl of spicy sauce. We ordered Chicken Fried Dimsum, Korean Mixed Fried Rice, and Roasted Chilli Chicken. The food tasted sooo well! The rice was soft and smooth and the other two dishes were equally delicious. The prices were reasonable. Would like to visit this place again.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: Rs. 600 for two (apprx.)

The resturant is located on the first floor beside the HDFC bank/ 8B bus stand Jadavpur. The resturant is well light with ample seating, usually occupied by young adults.

I've eaten here a multiple times, but everytime it's been just average. The chicken Takrai and the Seafood soup is very good, but everything else is ordinary.  

It's pocket friendly and fast service. but there are a lot of better eateries around.

Jadavpur is a place which have experienced different kinds of food joints and Resturant's but Cantonese have added something extra to the taste buds of the people. The place is cozy, the music and the ambient light makes it a bit more cozy. Their service is just great, their way of serving and taking review after serving every food or drinks (mojito's). Coming to the main part FOOD, this place have a mouth watering food menu. The food, specially the the fish, the prawns, the neat they are so fresh you will feel u are at home. It's just wonderful to have such a fabulous resturant at your favourite place. I will visit again and again... keep it up guys.

The service couldn't be any worse and the handling skills of the crew is not at all good. You see 4 people sitting in seats for two and the opposite.The food is also subpar. And nothing is even remotely good except the complementary prawn chips they serve. Usually empty on weekdays because of the poor quality of food and service, if you are going on weekends,prepare yourself to wait pointlessly cause the waiters are not even remotely qualified or adept to handle the crowd.

Their complementary prawn chips with dip is really nice.
I had ordered pan fried chilly fish, hakka chowmein, sweet and sour chicken , konjee crispy lamb and diced chicken in black bean sauce.
The pan fried chilly fish was THE BEST. It had huge chunks of fish which were cooked to perfection! It beats some of the best Chinese restaurants we have!
The diced chicken in black bean sauce had a very new taste and we loved it.
The noodles were as usual good and one plate is for three people having average appetite. They definitely serve good portions.
The konjee crispy lamb was very nice and very tasty.
The sweet and sour chicken was average in taste.
Overall an amazing experience at this place. Definitely going for more.

This restaurant located opposite to 8b Bus stand, Jadavpur, can accommodate around 30 people. Interior is basic. Do not expect a great ambiance or soothing music at the background.

I had tried a number of their chicken, lamb and prawn items. The Crispy konjee lamb was disappointing. The Crispy Octopus tasted somewhat like crispy baby corn.  Other than that all the items were good. 

Service is fast and efficient. Price is quite reasonable too.

Its located near 8b opposite jadavpur university gate no 3.
Its a small place which is unnoticable if you dont know the restaurant.
Though its size is small but the quality of food is very good.
We ordered 1 mixed fried rice,one gravy noodles amd 1 meifoon with two side dishes and a starter.
The quantity of food was more than what we expected.
We were 6 and that was more than enough for us.
The bill was around 1200 bucks amd thats very cheap.
This place is a must for students

My PhD life in IICB will always be incomplete without this place. Probably this place will make its place in the acknowledgement section of my thesis too. But before that let me pen down the review here. 
Located near 8B bus-stand, this restaurant with the budget friendly and regrading menu has become a popular name among the students and locals of this area. If it maintains the quality it will definitely become a crowd-puller.
Let's discuss all the aspects one by one.

Ambience and interior- I love simple, peaceful interiors and this place makes me happy. The white walls with soothing pictures, the big windows that makes room for the sunlight makes this place cozy and comfortable. Definitely a refreshing ambience.

Stuffs and service- The stuffs are polite, helpful and very friendly. They make sure that you feel comfortable and love the food. I want them to keep up this attitude in future too. The service is a little slow but I don't mind waiting. However I hope they increase the number of kitchen stuffs so that they don't have to keep people waiting for long. 
 Food- The food is tasty and not the typical heavy kolkata styled Chinese. They serve authentic food, with the right dose of flavour and quantity is always enough.
 
Chicken dimsum- I am a crazy fan of this dish here. The stuffing is super yummy and the garlic sauce compliments them perfectly.
Chicken lollypop- The crispy coating is not thick and the chicken is fresh and soft inside.
Squid butter pepper garlic- The right kick of flavor on the freshly fried squid. A must have here.
Konjee, crispy lamb- The usual crispy one with a little dash of sweetness.
Sea food Manchow soup- loaded with sea food and acts as a perfect appetizer without making you feel too heavy.
Sea food noodles- Not too oily or heavy. Goes well with any side dish and the fresh sea food adds loads of flavor.
Egg pad Thai noodles- This refreshing Thai noodles will be your choice if you love South Indian food (try it out and know why)
Schezwan and roasted chili porks- both the fish tastes good with soft pork meat. I wish they added a little more pork fat to the dishes 
Oyster chicken- Well cooked chicken in fresh gravy 
Fried ice-cream- A perfect way to end your day (or meal!) 

Well, I had all these over multiple visits and over the next 5years I will definitely cover the entire menu card. Each dish is enough for two (or more)and it's budget friendly too.
Will keep updating as I explore more. Happy dining 
P.S- I am going there today too 😂

Went there on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty empty. Tried non-veg fried rice,sweet and sour chicken and fried ice cream. The fried rice tasted good and one plate is enough for two, the sweet and sour chicken was too sweet and runny though there were quite a few chicken pieces. The fried rice ice cream could have been better. It's easy on pocket and the staff are well trained. They even asked for feedback about the food. All in all a good experience.

This restaurant located opposite to 8b Bus stand, Jadavpur, can accommodate around 30 people. Interior is basic. Do not expect a great ambiance or soothing music at the background.

I had tried a number of their chicken, lamb and prawn items. The Crispy konjee lamb was disappointing. The Crispy Octopus tasted somewhat like crispy baby corn.  Other than that all the items were good. 

Service is fast and efficient. Price is quite reasonable too.

This is my new favourite place in Jadavpur. Small space with elegant decor offering cozy sitting arrangements. There were hardly any sea food restaurants in jadavpur area, hence I had an eye on it since I spotted it. Had gone there for a family dinner and tried out quite a few of their delicacies. Fried chili octopus, Thai basa fish curry and their variety of rices are my favourites. Prawn wafers come complimentary. If you want to try seafood on a budget this is your place to go.

Located near Jadavpur university, right next to the Golpark auto stand. Heard a lot about this place so we wanted to try out some of their dishes.The restaurant is on the first floor of a building. It's nice little place with 20-30 seat capacity. As soon as we settled in the waiter served some prawn crackers to us (Complementary).

We Ordered : Mango Cooler, Mongolian Grilled Chicken and Pan Fried Fish.

# Mango Cooler was nice, nothing extraordinary. Basically it was Aam Panna.
# Next came the Mongolian Grilled Chicken. 6 Pieces of thick perfectly grilled Chicken Strips with proper spices and seasoning.
# After that we tried Pan fried fish. 8 pieces of fresh,juicy and meaty Fish served with some sauteed​ bell peppers and onions. This is a must try dish for all

Staffs were very polite and courteous. Prices were also reasonable and​ they do charge all sorts of taxes.
Overall a good place to try some quality Chinese food in this area.

This place is very near to 8b bus stand,though the entrance is a bit difficult to locate as it is on the sideway lane.The restaurant is on the second floor.As we entered the place was almost empty.It is a very small place with about a seating of about 25 to 30 people.The staff is very courteous,they make sure to suggest you dishes according to your needs.But the service was extremely slow,it took about 30 mins for each dish to arrive, in total we almost had a waiting time of 1 hour in the restaurant.

We ordered,fresh lime sodas,for starter they suggested the Phuket fish,we also had an extra order of french fries and for mains mixed cantonese noodles and since crab was not available we settled for Konjee Crispy lamb.

 They offer a complimentary basket of prawn wafers with a delicious chilli garlic sauce.Make sure you try spoonfuls of that sauce,it is amazing.

Phuket fish: This dish was very delicious.Two big chunks of basa coated and fried and then sauteed with exotic veggies  a sweet spicy sauce with a perfect balance.The fish was very fresh.I was impressed with the suggestion.

Cantonese pan fried noodles: Quantity wise it was not enough for two person.Though it had quite a number of chicken and prawn and lots of veggies.

Konjee 'crispy' lamb : They made sure of maintaining the crispy factor of this dish.The coated  lamb 'strings' were so overfried that they were almost burnt.It was literally tasting bitter  fried batter,no way I could locate any lamb their.The sauce that coated was good tasting though.

Though the starter amazed me,the overall experience considering the time factor and the other dishes I am not willing to return to this place for another try.

One of the best places in and around jadavpur in my opinion. Food is really good and so is the quantity. And it is pocket friendly as well. Though the service was not upto the mark( they took quite some time to serve the food we had ordered) yet it was a good experience all together.

A small restaurant in Jadavpur,opposite Jadavpur university..Today was our very first visit there and it has ensured some upcoming visits too..The food was pretty good..The staffs polite and well-mannered..We ordered drums of heaven which tasted alright..In the main course we took Korean fried rice which was a tad bit different from the regular fried rice and had a nice distinct taste..The roasted chilli chicken along with it was not at all like the regular chilli chicken that we get..It tasted really different but really good..Will sure go back again..Keep up the good work :)
P.S their complementary prawn papad and garlic sauce was the icing on the cake.

This cute little food joint has newly opened near 8B bus stand, Jadavpur. I went there on last Saturday and I'm quite impressed with the quality and quantity of food they served and the way they behaved with us!! It is a small but well decorated restaurant. I have noticed two amazing facts about this restaurant- 
1. they do serve hot, crunchy and crispy prawn chips as a complementary dish as soon as you have your seat.
2. This restaurant will not make a hole on your pocket as soon as you get your bill after filling your stomach with amazingly tasty foods!!
It was a hot day so we decided to try only their starters. So we ordered- Malaysian grilled chicken and pan fried fish.
Malaysian grilled chicken- 6 flat grilled pieces of chicken filled with flavours and it was really hot. I liked this dish soo much!!! It was hot tasty, juicy, tender, perfectly grilled. 
Pan fried fish- oohh myyy goodd!!! I just fell for this  dish as soon as I had the first bite of it. The fish was soo fresh!! One bite of fish and I was dying to have the second bite of it. It was that tasty. I really recommend this item to everyone. It contained 8 pieces of soft, juicy, fresh, flavoured fish with bell peppers, onions and other things.
 I really loved this joint soo much. I didn't expect this level of satisfaction from this restaurant!! But they proved me wrong and I'm really happy that they did so. 
Next time I'm looking forward to try their main course and hope to love them as well.. Really, you guys are doing a wonderful job. Hope to return there real soon.

We went in there yesterday for dinner, four of us after a quick study on the reviews. We ordered crispy chilly baby corn and konjee crispy lamb as starter. Both were very yummy. They have more beverages on actual menu. We took fresh lime sweet, virgin mojito and a shocker. All delighted us, though amount of fresh lime was a bit miserly.
For main course, mix Phad Thai noodles, American chopsuey and creamy cheese chicken were chosen. Chicken dish went well with noodles but not with chopsuey. But each one of them tasted great. 
We thought of ordering desserts, but we were already full, so cancelled it.

From the point of view of flavours, we found the recipes very good.
Service was good too. They kept asking. The complimentary prawn fries were awesome too.
Pocket wise?? Just head towards it without a second thought. They won't upset you.

We thoroughly enjoyed.

We went there the second time and ordered manchow soup which was sided by fries noodles. Amidst that we were surprised by the warm welcome and the complimentary prawn chips and garlic sauce. We were very glad by such a surprise.
The soup was thick and creamy. Loved it immensely.
For main course we ordered Gravy mixed noodles with fish in oyester sauce. The noodles was good but expected a bit more gravy into it while the fish was fresh and teder and loved it.
The staff behaviour is extremely polite and really encouraging. The place is small and cosy an it I a must visit in Jadvpur. Pocket pinch is okay. Food up to the mark of the price.

A small restaurant on the 1st floor, near 8B bus stand. I went there with my friends because our usual place for lunch was closed. It has a simple decor & ambiance, good for people who like calm & quiet environment.
Coming to the food, we just ordered a veg hakka noodles & chilly chicken. But to our surprise, they served us papad with a spicy dip as starters (that too for free). Then came the main course which is enough for two people. Although the quality of noodles is not like those served in premium restaurants. But it's good enough compared to the price. Chilly chicken had 10pcs of chicken in it and tasted good enough.
Overall a nice place for couples & friends to have a good time.

Cantonese Restaurant is a new suitable choice for pocket friendly restaurant in Jadavpur area.They uses to serve variety of quality chinese dishes.
Starter:
Complimentary Prawn Chips: It's crunchy and enjoyable with the sauce.

Garlic Peeper Chicken: shredded and fried chicken with can vegetable,it's awesome in taste,quantity is for two people per plate.

Drinks:
Fresh Lime Soda is cool and refreshing.

Electric Shock:It's a drink contain Thumps up upon Maaza and ice cream on the top,it's different from the other contemporary drinks and you can try it.

Main Course:
Mix Meafoon Noodles:noodles are thin and mixed,it's delicious,quantity is huge,one plate or bowl is enough for three person.

Stir Fried Chicken:it's mixed with plenty of sea foods,excellent in taste,highly recommended item of them.

Mix Fried Rice: it's simple and enjoyable contains chicken and prawn,if you want to go for a simple and less spicy menu go for it.

Samurai Chicken:Vegetables are not properly fried and dish is not so interesting,there are other plenty of options in chicken,so it's better to avoid Samurai Chicken,but if you like gravy you can give it a try.

Thai Chilly Fish:One of their signature dishes,i loved it most,it's extremely tasty and mouthwatering,fishes are soft,it's just wow,fish lover must try.

Ambience: It's cool and calm,a peaceful hidden gem in the busy streets of Jadavpur.

Give it a try.

The restaurant is situated near 8B Bus Stand. It's an ideal location specially for the college students of Jadavpur for hanging out. The waiters are very well behaved. Service time is a bit slow. The food quality is good, although avoid crispy lamb. You will not understand what you are having. Recommend trying out fish starter, specially Phuket Fish. It is really very good.

I got a Fish Thai curry delivered and frankly, wasn't expecting much. While the delivery time was around 40 mins, the food was delivered hot and was extremely delicious. 

Although it was a simple dish, I really liked how the fish was cut and cooked very tender and not at all bland.

After hearing some really good points about the food and service of this restaurant, i finally decided to visit the place today. Located very close to jadavpur 8b bus stand, Cantonese lies at a very convinient position. Well its a small restaurant with very decent and eye catching interior. The music, lights and the seating arrangements are very comfortable and adds an extra star to the ambience. The next mention goes to their service. The restaurant provides a heart warming service to the customers, the staff members were very helpful and cordial. Not only this, they even  provide complimentary prawn papads with garlic sauce as appetizer ,which was really impressive. Now coming to food,  we ordered Drums of heaven, chicken burnt garlic rice, chicken in oyester sauce. The burnt garlic rice and chicken in oyester sauce was very tasty. The drums of heaven was juicy and more or less good. Pocket pinch is quite reasonable. Moreover a very good place to taste some delicious food items at a very reasonable price. Would definitely visit here to try more dishes! Good work. Keep it up.

Situated just beside the main road near 8b bus stand Jadavpur. It is indeed a gem of a place for college Students. They had complimentary chips with sauce at first.We ordered lat me kai, which was boneless chicken crispy fried starters, delicious in taste. Quantity was a little less. Then we had veg Hakka noodles and fish in Oyster sauce. The main course quantity was good. 8pcs fish with good amount of noodles. The main attraction we would say is the wonderful taste of food, really appreciable. There was no tax. Service is good. Ambiance nice. Good instrumental music was playing in the background.

It was great to explore this nice place. It is situated just beside the 8B bus stand near Jadavpur University. It's a great place to be with friends in a sudden hangout. The place is very pocket-friendly, we had a great lunch at about Rs. 200-250 per head. The decoration and ambiance was also very nice. The service was fast and good.
Now coming to the food, in starters we had Drums of Heaven which were okayish, in main course I will recommend everyone to try the Pad-thai Noodles, it was very delicious and the taste had a nice mixture of spice and sweet. They also provide complementary prawn chips. It was really great to experience the food here.

The first thing that strikes about this place is its wonderful decor. The waiters are very active and respond well to any queries. We had taken the nasi goreng platter, pan fried noodles chicken schezwan rice and chilli pork. All of them tasted beyond expectations and the portion they served was huge. And the best part was no service charge was added hence, the extra joy. Will definitely visit this again

Quite possibly the BEST Chinese food the whole of Jadavpur/NetajiNagar/Bansdroni area has to offer. I've ordered/dined in at this place nine times in two months. That's right, NINE times. 

If you decide to dine in, the interiors are fantastic. The service is extremely gracious, in fact too gracious - your glass of water won't be empty before they come back to refill it. The prices are kind of too good to be true. Special mentions go to, Burn Garlic Rice, and the Malaysian Grilled Chicken. 

If you order in, they themselves have a fantastic delivery service. Apart from that, Swiggy makes life easier. 

Definitely, and highly recommended.

● Roasted Chicken Wings: 3.6/5

● Veg Fried Rice: 3.5/5

● Oyester Chicken: 3.4/5

with some coke. Food was good, but I didn't like their complementary snacks!!!

Ambience: Dark themed, framed pictures on the wall, glass windows. Nice & simple. 3.5/5

Service: 4/5

Price: Reasonable. Our meal was of 571 Rupees only.

overall a good experience.

It is an authentic chinese restaurant. Food is very good to taste. And behaviour of the staff is also very appreciatable. We have tried Chicken Garlic Noodles Soup, Crispy Noodles Salad, American Corn Salt n Pepper, Chicken Balconic Rice Platter, Honey Lemon Chicken and Fresh Lime Soda. Each n every dish is very good. Quantity is satisfactory. We can recommend everyone to go nd to taste it, hope all of you will enjoy those.

This was our second visit to Cantonese. We are very disappointed this time. And we won't be visiting this place again. We are just roaming about and planned to get some evening snack from there. Ordered a plate of Thai grilled fish. They served the complimentary dish , prawn chips. They were good , no doubt. But the took too long to serve the thing we ordered. Another customer who came after us were served before. Maybe because we ordered just one dish. The man who came to take our order told us that the dish is semi gravy when he took out order and then when finally our order came , they had just 6 small pieces of fish fry 😑😑😑😑 we felt that they have served a wrong order , intentionally or unintentionally. And what's worse is that they had some Cole slaw salad kind of thing along with it which they took away without serving. 😂 Utterly disappointed. Will not be recommending this place to my friends anymore.

Went there on a quick visit just to try out a dish or two to see whether this eatery which is a 5 mins walk from my home is as good as I have heard. To tell the truth, I wasn't disappointed at all and they did live up to my expectations which is sometimes a rare thing. We ordered Phuket Fish and Sizzled Chilli Chicken. The later was recommended by the over-enthusiastic waiter. Yes, the staffs were over-enthusiastic which isn't a bad thing as long as they seemed amicable and made the right suggestions, which they definitely did in my case. The Phuket Fish, which is supposed to be their signature dish, was served with an assortment of veggies divided into 2 big pieces of bhetki (i hope i got the fish right) which again was quite filling. The sizzled chicken is basically a sizzler as u can guess from the name itself. We didn't order much since we were on a short visit but would come back to try out their other delicacies definitely. :)

Visited this place yesterday after seeing reviews in zomato. Had read so much about complimentary prawn crakers that i was really looking forward to it. Well, I was bit dissapointed bcz they did not serve me those crakers.We ordered Drums of Heaven for starter which was good but spicy as hell, for the main course we had exotic mushroom pot rice with samurai chicken as a side dish. Exotic pot rice as the name suggest was indeed different than the other fried rice which was good in its own way. And one pot rice is enough for two if you had starters.For dessert, we ordered fried ice-cream which personally I did not like it. I've had better fried ice-cream, here I think the addition of coconut just spoils the taste. So I ordered sweet lime soda and my friend ordered mango cooler, both the drink was refreshing and nice. When the server came with the bill, out of curiosity I asked whether they've stopped serving complimentary crakers, he fumbled but the another staff who I think is the manager, quickly responded by saying that "actually the old stock is finished so we are frying the new stock" and he would pack those fries for me. Even I had already declined the offer he insisted. I must say all the staffs are well behaved and above all they know how to make a costumer happy.

Have been watching this restaurant come up while I passed every day on my way to work but never thought of visiting it. Thanks to my friend who insisted we try it out and damn am I thankful to her. The food taste and quality is superb, fresh ingredients and awesome taste. We had Fish Samurai and Prawns in Butter Garlic something. And in main course we had mixed thai pot rice and a fish item(don't remember the name). What stole the show was the dessert, the fried ice cream.  It was so delicious that we repeated the order. I'm so happy that a good oriental/thai place is now just around the corner from my place.

Have been to this restaurant like a million times already. The food is delicious and,best of all, well prepared. The behaviour of the staff and the ambience of this quaint little joint is also fantastic. You can literally speak to the owner of the restaurant anytime you feel like, and regarding anything you want. 

Have had a great personalized experience whenever I've come to this place and I'm sure this trend will continue in the future too..

A hidden gem in Jadavpur. It isn't as popular as yet as nearby restaurants. But with the kind of food they serve at reasonable prices they'll soon be a favourite amongst the students. Most of the dishes are good here but special mention must be made of the Fukin fried rice(a gravy rice dish loaded with veggies chicken and prawns) and Samurai chicken.

Yesterday we wanted to go to a restaurant located at Golpark but due to the storm we had to change our plans and I'm glad that happened. We went to Cantonese restaurant at jadavpur 8b which was comparatively near to our house. The restaurant is on the 1st floor of a building and is cozy and well lit. We settled down and ordered our food. After ordering the food they gave us a basket of prawn chips along with a sauce which was complementary. We devoured it in few minutes.

Then our order came, we ordered bar- b-que chicken for the starter which tasted really good. Then in the main course we ordered chilli garlic noodles, exotic mushroom pot rice and Korean rice and for the sides we ordered creamy cheese chicken and samurai chicken. Each of the dishes had its own unique taste. The two dishes that I liked the most were the chilli garlic noodles and the creamy cheese chicken. I think they make their dishes after the order is placed which is just fine 👌. Lastly we ordered two fried ice creams for dessert and that was the most unique thing that I tasted in a while, an ice cream inside the coating of which seemed to be coconut.YUM. 

I must say that this restaurant is a real gem. I would highly recommend this. The staffs are also polite and friendly. No cons spotted for this restro.

The best part of this restaurant is the complimentary dish that is prawn chips and sauce. It's a really nice marketing strategy but an even better gesture. We ordered:

Crispy fried squid: Heavenly, literally. Quantity is enough for two people if you're having it for starters like we did.

Padthai Noodles (Non-veg): Delicious, really spicey and VERY filling. Enough for two people with normal appetites.

Devil's chicken: Chef's recommendation, delicious and very spicey. We did a blunder by ordering two spicey dishes to go side by side though. Nevertheless the quality was excellent.

Fried ice-cream: The ultimate exotic dessert. A brown fried covering giving way to a burst of ice-cream. The outer fried layer smells a lot like coconut though so I'm guessing that's what they use to fry it.

The interiors aren't bad and the staff is very courteous.

It was our 1st time at Cantonese. We were a group of four friends. 
As it is a new restaurant so it is tax free still, bt i don't know how long it would stay. 
Coming to service, they gave their 100% to satisfy us.

After giving the order of starter they gave us a small bucket of prawn chips with a dip , it is a  complementary time pass dish and a free service from them. 
Coming to food, we ordered chicken sweet corn soup and Bar B Q Chicken as starter..

Soup -- it was good as it tastes. 

Bar B Q Chicken - the quantiy is enough for two. First time i was tasting this dish, they made it so well that definitely i will recommend this. 

Coming to main dish we ordered-

Mix Hakka Noodles - it was tasty as usual, their was nothing special in it .

Chicken Fried Rice - also a okay dish .

Hunan Chicken - i liked it as i was tasting this for the 1st time.

Diced Chicken. C.O.S - it can be made far better. It was not up to mark!

All over i love this resturant , the decoration ❤
And foods too :)

Seriously a great restaurant. Both the quality as well as the quantity of the food was great. Although the service wasn't​ that prompt. Anyway the place was nice and clean very minimal decor.
We had stir fried lamb, butter garlic pepper squid, mushroom pot rice and schezwann pork. All the dishes were nicely cooked had great flavours to them. All though they didn't have the crab with cell which had me tempted to go to this place, that was a bummer.
This place is highly recommended.

We had Cinderella and French Kiss (Mock tail),, BB Q chicken was awesome... We added Korean fried rice and Chilli chicken.. Maifoon noodles will be a special addition for me whenever I will visit this place again.. The gravy chowmein is a wow one... Loved it.. 

The only problem is they dont have card payment process. 
I will request them to arrange the same as its easier to pay through card for customers like us...

I regret why I went to this restro after seeing its rating in zomato..Just why????
Went a day before poila boisakh..
Welcomed us with complimentary prawn papad and a dip,it was really good
Then we ordered non veg fried rice and roasted chilli chicken..
They took around 45 minutes to serve was which was just toooo late
The chicken was of small cubes of roasted chicken.. Hardly visible..
The rice was below average..
The quantity was very low..
One bowl of rice is not enough for 2 people..
The taste was also not at all good
The food had filled only quarter of our stomach..Nothing of having a heartily meal
Neither the food was good nor the quantity..
Very much dissatisfied..
With quarter filled stomach and half hearted we left the restro..
Will never visit again👎

I have noticed this place before also but didn't know it serves food this great. It's very neat and clean and minimally decorated. They serve prawn chips with a dip as complimentary dish. I don't like prawn chips but this one was mind blowing. We wanted to try the crab but unfortunately that wasn't available. So we ordered stir fried lamb with soya green chilli and butter pepper garlic squid in starters. Quantity is huge. Both the items tasted equally good. The lamb was amazing and it just melted in my mouth. For main course we had mushroom pot rice and schezwan pork. The rice was amazing. Very mildly flavoured, full of sweet corn, mushroom, broccoli and zucini. The schezwan pork could have been a bit better. I found it to be a bit sour. The place is tax free. Service was slow. May be it was because of paila baishak rush. Also they didn't accept card.

The only thing I would like to point out is, they should have a better and more prominent sign marking the entrance of the restaurant.

Complementary prawn chips with sauce is a nice gesture..the sauce was garlicky and i liked it v much..the prawn chips were also good..
The lemon coriander chicken soup was very good indeed..the flavour..loaded with good quantity of chicken...made me happy..
The drums of heaven was heavenly..spicy carribean flavours oozing out from the cruncy pieces of chicken..lovely dish..very hot indeed..
The korean non veg fried rice was another surprise...smelled good..looks appealing..fresh veggies..a big thumbs up from my side..
Devil's lamb..oh wat a dish...the tender lamb slices accompanied by the right combination of spices made it a win win dish for me...mindblowing...best part is they did not overdo anything...
The fried ice cream..well i had better than this one..i expected the crust to be more crunchy..the honey didnot go with the chocolate sauce andthe coconut was a total turn off for me...average for me..
No added tax yet..pocket friendly..worth every penny..loved it...

This bistro is located close to 8B bus stand near the Taratala auto stand. The first floor of an apartment has been converted to this small yet amazing restaurant. We were being greeted with a complimentary Prawn Chips with a spicy dip. The quality of this complimentary item will assures you that this place serves you amazing dishes. We had ordered Virgin Mojito, Crispy Chicken Takrai, Drums of Heaven, Padthai Noodles Mixed, Hunan Chicken, Fried Ice-cream.


Virgin Mojito: A cool refresher. Although, I have had better Mojitos elsewhere, this wasn't bad in anyway. Just a run-of-the-mill drink. It had a distinct yellowish orangish tinge.


Crispy Chicken Takrai Style: This dish was extremely tasty and was comprised of 6 boneless chicken pieces. The taste was really similar to the usual chicken lollipops we have. The sauce in which the pieces were tossed was amazing. This dish is recommended!


Drums of Heaven: This was definitely one of the best Drums of Heaven I have ever tried. This dish has become really common and makes its place in the starters list of almost every restaurant. But what this place serves is something really tasty and you would definitely love it. The chicken pieces were succulent and very spicy. This too had 6 pieces of chicken. A highly recommended dish!


Padthai Noodles Mixed: We had ordered this dish on the recommendation of the waiter on the demand of a spicy dish. This dish was not really spicy, rather it was a bit tangy. It tasted good with lemon sprinkled on it. It comprised of ribbon noodles with ample of chicken and prawn pieces. The quantity was definitely too much for 1 person to finish and would be sufficient for 2 people. It was a decent dish. People who do not prefer spicy food must go for it. This dish is recommended!


Hunan Chicken: This dish too was ordered on the waiter's suggestion. This dish too wasn't spicy at all but it was delectable. A light coloured gravy with soft pieces of chicken was all it had. A good dish if you want your food to have a low spice-quotient.


Fried Ice-cream: A must-try dish. Not many restaurants serve this dish and hence, our eyes lit up as soon as we found this item in the dessert portion of the menu. It is a solid ball-like dish with an outer warm covering of fried and crispy layer of dough with the inside filled with vanilla ice-cream. It was topped with hot chocolate sauce and nuts. The quantity of chocolate sauce was a little low but otherwise, a superb dish. This dish is highly recommended!


The prices of the items are reasonable and quality of the food is really appreciated. The service was prompt too. I would visit this place again for trying out their other items.

Located Close to the 8B auto stand,this small restaurant did surprise me!
They served us complimentary prawn chips with a spicy dip! It was delicious...now coming to the food we ordered, they are the following items-

1) virgin mojito(3/5): Just the regular virgin mojito-nothing different! It was refreshing and had a distinct orange colour.

2)crispy chicken takrai style(4/5): It comprised of chicken balls that taste almost like chicken Lollipop-the only difference being it was boneless...we really wanted to note the difference between this dish and drums of heaven so that's what we ordered next.

3)drums of heaven(4.5/5): juicy ,extremely hot leg pieces of chicken that came with gravy and yellow green bell peppers! Drums of heaven here is awesome! People who avoid spicy food should stay away from this one.Highly recommended for the rest!

4)padthai noodles mixed(3.5/5): this dish was taken under the waiter's recommendation,its more of a pasta(ribbon) with ample quantity of chicken and prawn! It's low in spice quotient but tastes good especially when lemon juice is sprinkled on it-a decent dish to try!

5) Hunan chicken(3/5):we had asked for a spicy side dish to which the waiter had suggested this dish,unfortunately this dish didn't turn out to be spicy at all! It has a light coloured gravy with tender pieces of chicken that taste good! No doubt a great dish but not spicy to the least...

6)fried icecream(4/5): this dish is absolutely a MUST try! Not many restaurants have fried icecream in their menu and I was ecstatic on seeing this! This ball like dish has an outer warm covering of crispy layer of dough with a filling of vanilla icecream! It is further topped with chocolate sauce and nuts! They have options of vanilla and chocolate icecream but trying this dish with vanilla icecream is recommended!Its a great dish just that the quantity of chocolate sauce should be increased! Nevertheless they do a superb job and its highly recommended!

An affordable restaurant with a great menu,amazing dishes and fast service! What more could a foodie ask for? I will be frequenting this place for their marvellous dishes for sure 😊

1) virgin mojito(3/5): Just the regular virgin mojito-nothing different! It was refreshing and had a distinct orange colour.

2)crispy chicken takrai style(4/5): It comprised of chicken balls that taste almost like chicken Lollipop-the only difference being it was boneless...we really wanted to note the difference between this dish and drums of heaven so that's what we ordered next.

3)drums of heaven(4.5/5): juicy ,extremely hot leg pieces of chicken that came with gravy and yellow green bell peppers! Drums of heaven here is awesome! People who avoid spicy food should stay away from this one.Highly recommended for the rest!

4)padthai noodles mixed(3.5/5): this dish was taken under the waiter's recommendation,its more of a pasta(ribbon) with ample quantity of chicken and prawn! It's low in spice quotient but tastes good especially when lemon juice is sprinkled on it-a decent dish to try!

5) Hunan chicken(3/5):we had asked for a spicy side dish to which the waiter had suggested this dish,unfortunately this dish didn't turn out to be spicy at all! It has a light coloured gravy with tender pieces of chicken that taste good! No doubt a great dish but not spicy to the least...

6)fried icecream(4/5): this dish is absolutely a MUST try! Not many restaurants have fried icecream in their menu and I was ecstatic on seeing this! This ball like dish has an outer warm covering of crispy layer of dough with a filling of vanilla icecream! It is further topped with chocolate sauce and nuts! They have options of vanilla and chocolate icecream but trying this dish with vanilla icecream is recommended!Its a great dish just that the quantity of chocolate sauce should be increased! Nevertheless they do a superb job and its highly recommended!

An affordable restaurant with a great menu,amazing dishes and fast service! What more could a foodie ask for? I will be frequenting this place for their marvellous dishes for sure 😊

Small place but a great place to relax with friends. The service is quite prompt.
The dishes are fairly good, especially the garlic chicken. Also try out the brownie and ice cream for dessert.

P.S.: The prices are inclusive of taxes.

I have just returned from cantonese.. its my first visit there.. this was really unplanned. After tried so many restaurants in jadavpur i was not satisfied.. we visited here in the evening. The staffs are very polite in nature.. they welcomed us.. we ordered mixed friednoodles in cantonese style and chilli garlic crspy potato. They gave complimentary prawn chips with sauce.. and it was simply awesome start.. they took time to serve our order.. but when the dish came on the table it was worth .. the noodles is amazing with kota of exotic vegetables, babycorn, bellpepper, brocolli,musroom, backchoy chicken and prawn. And the dish is awesome . The crispy potato is the another one to get mentioned. They both go with each other very nicely.. its the best easteries in jadavpur according to me as i am local here.. surely will give visit number of times

It being a para restaurant i literally didnt have much expectation from it,but in one word i was spell bound by cantonese.Starting from their food to service everything was top notch.The waiters are really attentive and paying heed to each and every single detail.After each item we tried they were asking for our feedback.Infact they gave us complementary prawn papad which was certainly the cherry on the cake.We had roasted chilli pork,phuket fish,electric shock,mixed nasi goreng platter and fried icecream.All were excellent specially the phuket fish is highly recommended.Nasi goreng platter had 2 prawn papads,one poached egg and 2 chicken skewers.It had ample pieces of prawn and chicken and the smell of prawn was prevalent which was making it all the mose delicious.Electric shock will literally give u shock at the 1st sip- it had the perfect balance of spiciness,sweetness and tanginess.Definitely will try out their other delicacies .

We were greeted with complimentary prawn chips with a dip. They were unique and tasted good.

Crispy octopus: this was the starter we had. The octopus was cooked soft enough and was not overcooked to make it rubbery. The outer coating was crispy and the core was soft. The best octopus I had in the city. It had a tangy lemony flavour. It was wonderful.

Nasegoreng platter (mix): this has two prawn chips, a poached egg, two grilled fish and the rice with chicken and prawn.. It was delicious

Samurai chicken: it was average. Well cooked and good.

Exotic mushroom pot rice: this rice had an assortment of mushrooms to it. We also had prawns and corns in it. It had a mild sweet flavour. Was good..

The place is good and so are the waiters who are courteous.

Nice and a quiet restaurant amongst a bustling and chaotic Jadavpur 8B area. 

Ambience and decor is nice. Humble stuffs add to the ambience. Price is reasonable. Food is served in good quantities. 

Squid butter pepper garlic, crispy chicken takrai style was our starters. Both were excellent. Chilli Oyster fish, Hunan chicken, mixed fried rice, Hakka mixed noodles and pan fried Cantonese noodles were in our mains list. Chilli Oyster fish and Cantonese noodles were best of the lot. Downsides are the errors in the menu card and the time they take to serve the food, so have patience or be in a nice company.

One of the best in Jadavpur area. Cantonese provides a nice cozy atmosphere. The ambience and the decor is perfect. The place is mainly visited by a group of college friends. Prices are quite reasonable and the food is amazing. Don't miss out on the Tempura Prawn, truly it is one of their speciality.

Visited this place on Valentines day with a friend. This was my first visit. It's located between gate2 and gate3 of JU ,on the opposite side of the road.

We had ordered chicken meifoon and oyster chicken as the side dish. The portions served were more than enough for two people. We were too full and decided to go in a group of 3 the next time. The quality was kind of okay though I expected better but then given the price, of course you can't expect it to match Mainland China standards or even Chowman for that matter. Actually I wasn't that satisfied with the meifoon. The one in mainland is different in fact (okay no more comparing 😐) The oyster chicken was fine. 
Service was nice. Ambience was great too. We didn't have to pay tax. We were told from March'17 VAT+service tax would be applicable.
The bill amounted to ₹360. 
According to the price; the food, service and ambience were just great and one couldn't ask for more. 
We plan to visit this place again, it being so close to college and pocket-friendly, of course!

It was my first visit to.this restaurant.located just opposite to gate 2 of JU..Behind the jadavpur market. The restaurant displays a superb ambience all together. The staffs are very well behaved.and guide the first timers very well as to what should be the best to taste.
Now coming to.the food. All the dishes in the menu card are tax inclusive.so.you get to no.what you need to pay.
We were 4 in number..So.we ordered a plate of Malaysian grilled chichken and another plate of chicken in takrai style as the starters both tasted amazing. Malaysian chicken had around 8 pieces and the other 6 pieces.
We ordered sweet lime soda and virgin mojito at drinks part. They donot serve hard drinks.
Main course included Korean rice mixed with prawn, chicken ..The prawns were clean and well cooked..Chicken tasted very juicy too.
Along with it we ordered samurai chicken it had 10 pieces.which was sufficient for us. Also.ordered dry chili chicken to add a spice to.our taste buds. Overall it was so.reasonable that all these was of 1400 ruppees only. 
So a good impressive restaurant. And a must visit for me  once again.

I came at this restaurant close to my workplace with Anamitraa/The Gut Filling after her classes.Ambience is pretty decent and service was efficient.
We were not in plan for a full course meal.Hence we settled for two starters.

•Pork dimsum-I was surprised to see it being served in a cane box.After the lid was lifted 6 pork dimsums emitting steam made us eager to try it out.The dimsums had a juicy filling with a decently thin outer coating.I loved the sauce served alongside these.It had a tangy flavour with heat from red chillies cutting through it.

•Steamed octopus butter garlic- This was a winner dish! Octopuses were cooked perfectly.Cooking seafood can be tricky.Overcooking makes it rubbery and unpleasant to eat.Here it was amazingly tender.The sauce was too good.Addition of pepper in it elevated it from being a blande sauce of butter garlic.The sauce was beautifully subtle which showcased the delicate flavour of the seafood itself.It was one of the best seafood dish I've tasted.

Surely going to come back here to taste their other dishes owing to it's pocket friendly rates and being in close vicinity to my workplace.

When it's a Saturday and you are with your special one and dying to grab something to eat around 5:00 PM pretty much anything and everything would be heavenly but then again when both of them have different choices of food it becomes difficult to pick just any place...

So couple of days back near Jadavpur 8b we saw this place and immediately it just popped up in my head cause it had Thai food... Me being a Thai food lover and her who is big Chinese fanwe decided to pay a visit to this place... Ambience was pretty decent, we liked the decor and simplicity of this place. Now the food... We ordered for a Mix Lung Fung Soup and Crispy fried squid. Soup was okay, I mean we have had better Lung Fung Soup than this but the oysters were really good... Perfectly fried and crisp, it was yummy. Well now for the main course he wanted Devils Lamb and me obviously wanted to go for Green Thai curry... Out of my astonishment even he opted to try Thai. So it was his first time trying Thai and I personally wanted it to be a good experience.. We ordered Chicken Green Thai Curry and steam rice (best combination). For me now his opinion was much important than the food, well he liked it and relished every bit of it.. And as per my opinion is concerned the Chicken Thai curry was good would have tasted much better with some broccoli and other veggies in it. Overall it was a nice experience... Look forward to visit again for trying the octopus...
Thanks Cantonese for being a lovely host to us yesterday evening..

I completely am in love this place. Cozy ambience and great dishes. I loved the #Crispy_chilly_squid and #Butter_pepper_squid in starter. Pot rice is a favorite in Main course along with a dish of Pork. They don't have much choices in dessert but I still love fried ice cream. Service is good and their food is commendable. I already have visited thrice and won't hesitate to go for the next time.

Small sized Chinese restaurant serving decent starters. The main course staples (sea food rice and burnt garlic rice) were also good. But the side dishes (devil's chicken, Samurai chicken and crab meat balls) were disappointing both in quality and quantity.
Service was prompt.

Well someone said it right don't go on brands and names of places, even the smallest of them can do wonders. Cantonese was a surprise last night, me and my sister went to have dinner. So this place is on first floor of the building and quite visible when you are at 8b bus stand facing jodhpur park, you see the red signboard.
The place is well lit and decor is very minimal with neatly placed tables. Service and servers both are apt, suggestive as well as concerned about feedback.
We had ordered for pork dimsums, chicken gravy noodles and Malaysian grilled chicken. Servings were of generous portions, pork dim sum was soft and meaty but juicy was missing. The noodles had crisp veggies and shredded chicken in plenty, just the way I like. The Malaysian chicken was man of the match although, perfectly seasoned and rubbed with Malaysian spices. The essence and taste of it was lipsmacking. 
All of it and the bill was only around 430 bucks! Definitely returning for more meal! Hope they continue service like this.

Stunning decor! Well furnished! Nice service!
Because Jadavpur is more a student zone, I felt the price is bit high compared to the quantity! 
No issue with the quality of the food! 
Quantity should be raised or price needs to be dropped! Other wise there are fully functional restaurant in this zone with are pocket friendly,might face a tough challenge in future!

The second edition of one of the finest Chinese and Continental cuisine specialists in the city, (including the likes of Mainland China).. it's a place where after having the food you actually might want to kiss the chef..! ;)
A place where humility meets taste; it's hygienic and easy on the wallet as well. 3 years it has been, have seen this place grow from Taste of China.. Its a journey filled with taste and friendship with the owner and the staff.

Spotted this restaurant when it was all under construction. Cantonese is located just beside the Jadavpur- Taratala and South city auto stand.. It is on the 2nd floor and has got cozy and comfortable interiors.. Today 3 of us, visited this restaurant for the first time.. As we were the only ones at that time we were greeted very well. What attracted me towards this restaurant is their seafood preparations.. They have a good menu in a reasonable price. Now coming to the food.. We ordered
1) DRUMS OF HEAVEN as the starter
2) EXOTIC MUSHROOM POT RICE in NON VEG and
3) CHILLI PORK for the main course and
4) VIRGIN MOJITO
Drums of heaven tasted good.. nothing extraordinary though.. The chicken pieces were soft and very well prepared.. Now coming to the main course.. The exotic mushroom rice was served in a small pot and it tasted pretty good.. Quite flavourful and tasty.. But the only problem is that there were just a few pieces of chicken.. Nevertheless the quantity was good.. Now coming to pork.. It was good, very soft and juicy but i found the pork to be a little bit over cooked.. But the flavour and softness of the pork was pretty delightful.. Last but not the least.. We paired up our dishes with a virgin mojito.. Now, i dnt know whether to call it a mojito or not.. It was yellowish brown in colour with a faint smell of mint.. But whatever it was.. It was extremely tasty.. Very well prepared.. Overall, i had a good experience here.. Surely coming back to try out their seafoods... :)

This place has a good ambience nd is cosy nicely decorated. The service is very good nd they do have knowledge abiut the dishes they serve. As it was our 1st visit we tried the basic dishes except chicken takrai style as suggested by them which was good really but a bit sweeter dish to try as a starter followed by chicken drumstick which was quiet decent less spicy though looked spicy nd i like spicy. The food was good, they do maintain a decent standard nd its expected that they will continue to maintain the same in future. All over the experience was good wl dfntly visit again.

Was there last night with 3 friends in the quest for momos.. Ordered chicken and pork steamed momos and a fried pork momo... They were decent, only lacked the juiciness expected of the best momos.. Very impressed with the way the momos were presented.. In little wooden steam boxes with steamed veggies... Another scope for improvement would be the sauce that came with the momos.

We also ordered exotic mushroom clay pot and butter squid garlic and were totally blown over both these dishes that complemented each other perfectly.. We were already pretty full from the momos but couldn't stop eating these dishes coz of how good they tasted... Little bits of shiitake mushrooms were the icing on the cake.. 

The best part though was the price.. A bill of 910 Rs for 4 people for food of this quality is difficult to imagine...

If you guys perfect the momos to make them juicy, this place will be the best place for momos in town..

I better not say how long have i been waiting for the restaurant to show up in zomato. It is newly opened and work-on-progress Chinese serving casual dining restaurant located beside jadavpur NIIT. Anyone familiar with the name 'taste of China' would recognise the flavour of their food.
Brilliant in one word. to my amusement they didn't compute extra charges in the name of vat or service tax. I heard complimentary prawn chips were given in the beginning that is unanticipated. Inside has a serene feel. equipped with sofas and comfortable chair without making the place congested enough to peep into adjacent table.
First day we went for bar-b-q chicken as starter and egg rice with roasted chili chicken. I would like to place Bar-bq chicken at the top of my recommendation list.
Its just the smoked octopus that disappointed us. Lets not try anything like octopus and squid in cantonese where you have pretty good options in the neighbourhood.
Tempura prawn as a starter was the best choice made. Mixed rice quantity was optimal for two. Samurai chicken served in light mashroom gravy has distinct taste of its own. We nearly got exhausted finishing the dishes.
Courteous well behaved stuffs, happening place, reasonable price, limited crowd that pretty much sums up all.

Okay, writing a review for zomato after a long time..so this new restaurant opened and I was really eager to check it out.. Cantonese restaurant is located just before 8B bus stop, inside a lane, but is visible from the main road, so is easy to find..inside, the decor is simple and elegant, with dim lighting, providing the perfect ambience f@or a meal..only the music seems to be a little too loud for my liking..
Coming to the main reason, the FOOD.. we started off with Dim Sum, and Stir Fried Pork with Bok Choy..the Dim Sum was soft, hot, and i really liked the fact that it came in a bamboo basket..the Pork was the dish of the day..it is quite difficult to get tasty succulent Pork, and i have been disappointed in places like Hatari and Wise Owl Steakhouse, but this dish blew me away.. for mains, the choice landed on Pad Thai noodles, Szechwan Crab and Cantonese Style Mushrooms.. the noodles were not exceptional, but the Crab, oh it just blew me away.. cooked perfectly, and the right amount of spice, and the best part was that they even provided a Crab cracker to break open the Crab, a tiny but important detail missed at most seafood restaurants..points also for the mushroom, because one would expect only button Mushrooms on the menu in Kolkata, but we were served a dish with button, shiitake, and i think chanterelle Mushrooms..these unexpected surprises really has made a lasting impression on me..
On the downside, what could be improved is the co-ordination in the kitchen..the Crab was served a good 15 minutes before the noodles or Mushrooms arrived, so by the time we dived into it, it was quite cold..one may hope that these things will improve over time..also, they currently take CASH ONLY..I would have given a 4.5, but 0.5 deducted for these two..
The courteous staff, good food, and excitement to try out the other items on their menu, like lamb, octopus and squid, will definitely draw me back to this place again..looking forward to it!!
