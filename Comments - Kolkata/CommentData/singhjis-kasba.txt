Service is good & Food quality is Medium. Rate of drinks are moderate. Ist floor service  is not up to the mark. Ground floor service is comparatively better.

Visited there on 1st of Jan 2018. An underrated bar cum Restro located 1km away from acropolis mall near GST bhavan. On that day when all the restaurants and cafes were fully packed we wanted somewhere to chill, away from the crowd and this was the perfect place. It serves not cheap but pocket friendly drinks and some delicious food dishes. We ordered chicken lolipop which was good. Nice for a few visits.

I loved the food especially the daal makhni, beautiful texture creamy & makhnas in it. The kababs are soft & juicy.Would love to go back once again.

I went to singhji's with my friend , simply because we didn't want a fancy, over priced , over hyped place to grab a pint of beer and simply chill.
The ambiance is ideal for those who believe conversation is stimulation and doesn't matter if you have loud music and amazing decor which works as an aphrodisiac for you . This place offers cheap booze and quick bites which is worth the quality and quantity. Do drop in and be a judge for yourself . We had ordered beer , and full plate tandoori chicken and Irani kebab. Plus point , you get really cheap Uber pool from there back to wherever you wish to go.

Happened to be a regular visitor during our Kasba days. Now since we have moved out to a different locality visits have become infrequent. But the care we still get from the manager and the staff is unparalleled. No where else did I ever get such personal touch.
Food and drinks are quite reasonably priced. Service is good and timely. Quality and taste of food quite good. We always have relied on the manager's suggestions and had never been misguided. Lighting is the only thing that needs some improvement. In every other respect this place is one of the bests in it's price group.
