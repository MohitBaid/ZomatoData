A decent place.

Pros:
Music
Ok ok price.
Staff behaviour
Alcohol collection

Cons:
Dance floor is too small
Overall space is not quite big..

The place is a good one to grab a drink but their music is spot on.
Tried tender chicken and drums of heaven with Heineken. Loved it.

Had gone their with a great expectation. But it didn't meet our expression very well. First of all the place is very very loud as chit chats between ourselves couldn't be heard. Secondly after 9pm maximum lights gone out. After asking the waiter he said that was a rule their which seems very weird to us. Thirdly food quality wasn't so much out of the world frankly speaking. Chicken kebab was good but mutton sheekh kebab was not so soft. The menus seemed to be a bit overpriced. Overall not a very good experience.

I had been here on the 29th of November along with 3 other friends of mine.There was some sort of construction going on in the ground floor, this place is located near the main road so on can easliy find it out. The place has a wonderful ambiance so we ordered Rajasthani Murgh Ke Sholay, Sham Sheer-e- Murgh Flambe and shots of vodka.Prices are a bit on the higher side in comparison to the other pubs. Thus this place can be visited for parties and stuff and its a one time go.

Last Friday I have visited this place for an office party. ¬†They have offered a package with unlimited food and drinks. We were very much excited for spending some fun time over here with great food. But it was a huge disappointment. They had very limited options for drink. Food was not at all worthy of the money we paid.¬†

Starters: Only 2 non veg options were there. One fish finger and one chicken lollypop. Fish finger was really fresh and good but chicken was just mediocre.

Main course broke all the barriers. Here also only two non-veg items that too very ordinary in taste.¬†

They had only 2 desserts. Ice cream and Pastry. I can't imagine they did not serve any Indian desserts.

I was not very sure about the rate we have paid but it was around 1200 ¬†bucks. Food and drinks they offered for this much money is just a disappointment.

I will not suggest anyone who is looking for good food beside alcohol.

Renovation going on, but the actual party is on the first floor. Backstage, dude. Backstage. Firstly the ambience and the lighting, sooo soothing. We took 3 of the 1.25L pitchers, 1 hookah (2 refills), drums of heaven, kebabs, Bruschetta with chicken, chicken salami and sausage pizza and sizzling brownie ice cream (evilishly dark and delicious). So perfect. I will be back here, again.

Before the food review i would like to say the ambiance is really good here, it is well decorated with a rustic theme. 
Coming to the food, we have ordered 1.25 ltrs draught beer, Chicken tenders, Drums of heaven and crispy chicken wontons with spicy sauce. 
The draught beer was good and all the food tasted great. The chicken tenders comes with french fries and mayo which goes really well together and the wontons were crispy, tasted great and the sauce was really complimenting its taste. 
P.S- Apart from bar menu i find the other snacks or dishes to be slightly overpriced.

Though I was at Bakstage for an event, me and a couple of my friends did enjoy some time when the event got over. Bakstage has got this massive spread, having a two floor seating area along with a pool table, private room for events and a dedicated bar area. They played some amazing music in the first floor. I found the service to be very average. Coming to the food section we had the corn and mushroom pizza which was good and the Rajasthani murg tikka which was okaish but came with a lovely green chutney. Their mojito and red wine sangria were decent. Bakstage was a very okay experience with nothing really making a mark.

Not going to write a big review. 
Utterly disappointed with this place. 
The ambience is good but the service was not satisfactory at all. 
The shisha was too bad and I had to ask the waiter 3-4 times and after the first coal change the waiter said that ‚Äúkhatam ho gaya hai sir‚Äù. 
Like I didn‚Äôt understand how come the hookah is finished just after one coal change? 
Either you guys are serving old hookah or you need to change your hookah man. 
If it was a year back I would recommend this place but definitely not now.

Their food options are varied and almost everything in their menu from starters to desserts are well prepared! 
Their ambience is nice but it's crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings.

Been here quite a few times now. Like visiting this place. Only thing is I feel they should make it a bit more spacious - not all the seats are comfortable. Also, the section upstairs feels a bit clumsy, Food wise I'm not too happy as far as value for money is concerned. Alcohol is okay, I like the theka hour concept. People here are well behaved - I mean no one has misbehaved with me so far. Thanks for the hospitality every time I visit. Again, if u revise the food menu, nothing like it. Really like chilling out here.

Mumbai girl in Kolkata. I went to this place a few times for sheesha mainly. I come here atleast once whenever I am in Kolkata now a days. It's safe as the food, sheesha and the staff is really good.

Tip- go upstairs with you want to drink as the ambiance is a little dark n live music and live matches are generally on specially on the weekends. Downstairs is more like a family sitting or if you want to go for a proper dinner.

Food here is amazing I liked everything which includes Nachos, babycorn starter, Hakka noodles accompanied by mojito and few pints.

 plates and service was also very slow. On presentation of bill they charged     10 % service charge which i refused to pay as their service was below standard & as per GOVERMENT NOTIFICATION customer is has option to refused payment of service charges . EVEN AFTER I REFUSE TO PAY SERVICE CHARGE THEIR MANAGER FORCFULY TOOK SERVICE CHARGED FROM US.

It's as pathetic as it can get no good food with drinks no cooperation from the staff & the most important thing is the DJ ( so they call it) plays song for his own entertainment as we told him to play songs from few other artist he jst refused. Coming over to the crowd it's a empty place people are smart enough not to land here. So please be smart and don't try experimental thing.

One of the big pub in Sector 5, Kolkata, my experience had been not so good. The Bira price had been 300 plus GST while the MRP stands at 110. Besides this, the service had been too slow and also a started item got missed by the waiter. Food had been not to good based on the price. The ambience is although okay, the service was too bad. There are other better pubs in the area. Not recommended.

Visited this place several times as my office is located in sector v. The ambience is quite good and munchies are also good. They have an open balcony where you can smoke and carry your booze along. 
The negative part of this place is the waiters are not customer friendly. Many a times it happened with me that right after placing the order, we requested them to change the order and they refused. Once we placed an order of a few beers and within 5 mins asked for changing the brand. They refused and started behaving very badly. 
Once we ordered chicken pizza and they served us paneer pizza. When we informed them the same, they refused for replacement and also pressed us for adding this in the bill. 
Overall, good decor and ambience, but the service is not professional. The behaviour of the staffs is very bad.

Although the beer had to be replaced because of its extra watery nature, the food was quite good in taste. The beer was replaced with bottles of Kingfisher premium. Another bacon/ham pizza was ordered as the food was fantastic in taste. Overall, a great dining experience.

Visited this place yesterday with couple of friends. The ambience was exuberant. Spacious enough. Service was fast but the staffs need more basic training of attending to one person at one time. The staff was busy doing other works while taking our order which he should refrain from. 
Coming to the menu, it was a surprise to us for having come across so low priced menu in Place like Backstage. It was fairly low priced wherein liquor started @49 Rs. The Hookah was surprisingly nice and lasted long. Food was also tasty. The new menu makes it a must visit place..

A major issue with this place is that they levy a service charge of 10% on the bill (in addition to the prevailing GST rates @ 9%) which is illegal. On being asked about a clarification about this: the manager proudly claimed that he doesn't believe in the media reports and failed to show any government mandate (when asked for one) that makes service charge mandatory for a guest/patron. We were dared by the manager to make any claims regarding this issue. Is this what you call service and also charge 10% for it? 

Bakstage: You cannot ask a patron/guest to pay a fixed percentage (10% in your case) to dine at a restaurant. It is clearly up to the patron to pay a tip/pay money for the services offered by a restaurant and this is a government mandate.

Hanging a handwritten board that informs patrons to agree to this precondition before ordering is also tantamount to violating point 4. of the circular No. J-24/9/2014-CPU(pt.), effective 21/04/17, via the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution (Department of Consumer Affairs). This is forcefully tipping customers for services offered by Bakstage. Well, you're offering your services for a price anyway, not out of charity.

Its surprising how a restaurant at the heart of the city is thriving without any implications, given this malpractice.

This is the only place where Service charge is Mandatory. They are charging 10 percent as service charge and and they say it's mandatory. No one is charging service charge and even if some resturant  is charging you ask them and they remove it. But in Bakstage they are willing to write on bill that they will charge. Attaching a pic of the same. I Will take the issue with relevant legal forums. This is cheating.

This place need no introduction if you are familiar with sector V.. this  place was happens to be one coolest pub in salt lake  but not anymore. 
went their with my friends for boozing during their Thekha hrs.. 
The price of the drinks are starting at Ra.49 for 30ml. 
They do have a pretty impressive variety of liquor in this price range. 
And the best part was they serve LIIT at just 149. 
Blue lagoon at just 99.. 
Cool ambience classy decor and comfortable seating arrangements makes this place a cool choice for never ending addas..
The only thing which I really want them to change is their food menu... the options are really limited and the food they serve is not even close to delicious . 
The service is bite slow for food we had to wait for more than 50 mints  for the staters to serve ..

Been here with my friends. We ordered shisha, beer and a few starters. The ambience is really nice, the staffs were polite but the prices are a bit overpriced as compared to the quantity of the food. Overall, had a good time.

We had a booking for 3 people ,the staff(Mr Mac) didn't allow us to have a seat ,he kept us  waiting for 45 mins.
Next, when we asked him that we were waiting for 45 mins and need a seat .
He said that they don't have any seat(astonishing part was we could see 5-6 tables were vacant) and that we have to stand,inspite of pre booking and confirmation for 3 .
His behaviour was disgusting too.
This is the worst pub in the town i have ever visited with no courtesy(Mr Mac).

Checked in here at 11.30 as the place was to be opened till 1am ad per Zomato! At 1215pm the waiter came and asked for final order. 3 people had ordered a tower with some snakes and then we ordered a pitcher with a plate of chicken tender(undoubtedly tasty). I started falling in love with the place. Exactly at 12.50 the manager came up to us and started misbehaving with us asking us to leave! He wasnt aware that his waiters had asked us for the last order very late. Basically the quality is good but the service is poor. The waiters will try to deceive you towards the costlier items and definitely give you the wrong information about the timings and stuff. Basically play safe, the manager is highly disgusting. He will be extremely sarcastic and would spoil your good high to a bad one. Basically if you dont want to spoil your mood, avoid this place. In the end you shall find it horrible üòí

Had gone on a Wednesday night. Apparently it was their Sufi nights along with a Jim Beams specials. There were special offers on Jim Beams drinks which we happily availed. After all, one cannot commit the sin of ignoring Jim Beams. ;) Also ordered a topped fries with cheese and chicken. The music being played initially were all Sufiaana tracks which was later replaced by a live band. Nice place to chill if you are with friends. Would definitely love to visit again

It's near my office so we often go here for drinks. IT's a bit on the upper side of the wallet but the experience is worth it. Though I am not a fan of closed bars, this place does let me have a drink in it's open balcony. I will mention the food specifically - it is amazing. Not that bars are expected to have great cuisine, but only snacks to go along with the drinks, whoever the cook is, you will want to kiss his hands :) Especially the cheese-potato balls thing, it is the best I've ever had and it goes brilliantly with any drink.
Another mention will be the rooftop set up they had during New Year 2017; it was one grand place. The environment, the night sky and the booze - nothing beats that!

Used to Love this Place when it was incorporated, and did continue to visit for a year or so.
Since Last year (2016-2017) the place seen immense decline in terms of their Food, their music, and the worst of all their Service (staff). Visited this place in Jan-2017 and also in March-2017 and had repeated horrid experiences.¬†
Both the times  the service was not only extremely slow but also extremely unpleasant . The staff seems to be working for free, because they behave with customers as if they too are eating for free. They mess up with their Happy hours deal and create more chaos than joy. Staff picks up food and drinks from the table even before its finished and WITHOUT even asking ! I wanted to slap three of the waiter specifically But i thought at-least I should maintain decorum. The food quality has gone DOWN significantly and so is the presentation !!

Hate this place NOW and feels worse because it USED to be really good once upon a time !!

The last time I reviewed this place was when some of my acquaints got beaten off for challenging incorrectly billed amount. Zomato removed the review stating that it should be according to personal experience. I did not really wanted to visit this place ever, however I had to for a business discussion along with two other people. The ground floor looked pretty. This place used to be one of my favourite bakeries, On The Way, long time back. We headed towards the first floor. The LED board displayed that it‚Äôs a Sufi night, however what they played were some popular Bollywood tracks, half of which were no way close to Sufi. The volume was deafening and we could barely say a word, let alone discuss business. Why would a pub sound like a discotheque? The entire setup was extremely dimly lit.

Now let me focus on the service, booze, and food.

The waiters took forever to respond on being called. They had no idea about the menu. Every time we ordered something, they had to go and check if it is available. Half of the things on the bar menu were not available. I asked if they serve jalape√±o martini. The waiter went to ask and informed me that it‚Äôs not on the menu however they can prepare it. A partner of mine ordered ginger martini, and the third person on the table ordered hookah. The hookah was nice and smooth. The ginger martini was okay-ish, though there was no olive in the glass. My jalape√±o martini went for a toss. Forget olive, it did not have any bare minimum flavor of jalape√±o. To top that, it did not have enough alcohol, and tasted just like sugar syrup.¬† Amongst the food we had ordered chicken pizza and dahi kebab. Dahi Kebab tasted like gram flour. I understand that dahi kebab might require a little bit of gram flour for binding, however in this case, this is the only taste we got. The first one or two bites of the pizza were okay, however within a few minutes the cheese turned rubbery and almost inedible. The menu is extremely pricey in comparison to the quality of service, food, and ambience. Shall never visit again.

Loud music .. a bustling crowd and some kickass cocktails .. backstage is not at all subtle and is a no nonsense pub in the heart of the IT sector in kolkata.

There is food for nibbling, the cocktails are good and there is great music along with sheshaah.

The pizza here is quite good. 
Recommended to go during the happy hours as pocket pinch could be huge..

Well I have to give bad ratings because of the unprofessional behaviour of the waiters and average food quality. There were a time when people were used to shitty service but now with all the competition a restaurant must change themselves. I went with my girlfriend yesterday and it was 9:30 pm. The restaurant downstairs was pretty much empty. We had to ask for menu after waiting a long. Then they took order. We asked for mineral water. They provided a unsealed bottle after we complained they provided a bottle but no glasses! We had to ask for glasses again.... About the food it's average. I remember. When this place started it used to be a good place to hang out with outstanding service.... But now its not up to the mark. There are better places nearby. You guys have a good potential. Don't ruin it with bad service!

Located in the heart of the IT hub in Sector V, this lounge has got all the essential elements to become one of the best places to chill out in Kolkata.
The liquor prices are a bit towards the higher range but happy hours are saviors. Though bit expensive, be assured you will get a great crowd and ambience.
Food is interestingly priced. Tried Sharabi Kebabi Flambee and Dal Makhani Nazza. Sharabi Kebabi Flambee was simply lipsmacking; the way it was presented and for its taste/flavor.

You get some really exciting mocktails to choose over.
They do have a good collection of rock music that rolls on and sets the mood right, but as the night gets darker the commercial numbers start pouring in. 

Bakstage has a good old charm and you feel really good after entering the place. Overall a good experience.

Horrible service...the person who was taking the orders he needs a proper training...he was terrible..i went with my two friends and as the 1:1 offer was going on so we ordered 2 margaritas with mixed fruit juice..and as per the offer we suppose to get 4 glasses so we told the waiter to serve 3 of them at first and the last one we will take after a while...but when he served the margaritas those are classic margaritas which we didn't order and when we asked him to change that we have been told to test the served ones if we liked it...so I took a sip which tested like a disaster so I request him to change it as per the order and that time you should look at his attitude towards us..afterward when we asked him to serve the last glass which was left..he came and give us 3 margaritas instead of 1 as he thought we had order 3 margaritas instead of 2, so he served 3 at first n rest of 3 now...and the worst part is he was forcing us to take that...
what kind of service it is you are doing mistakes and forcing us to accept it..ok for a while if I admit that is very normal to do a mistake but there was only 1 table which was engage along with us and rest of the tables were empty so just think what will the guy do if he would ask to work in a rush...he was so mannerless that he picked up our plates during the argument..n telling us that why we were mentioning his mistakes in front of manager..he is the black mark of the whole evening cause if we ignore him the ambience, food n the music were good...this type of people with unethical behavior ruins the image of well known places...

A very dark pub with some really loud Bollywood music. The place is quite huge and can accommodate many people together. It's on the 1st floor of the building. We have ordered for some beer but unfortunately they don't have anything except corona and bira. When we asked for some cocktails same trend continued as they said they could not provide almost anything. Finally one Jalopeno Martini and one ginger martini they could serve and trust me, they only could serve one jalapeno and one ginger, as those were the last one and all these at 8 PM only. Fortunately they had Smirnoff. Now coming to the most ridiculous part, that jalapeno martini was the worst cocktail I have ever tried. It was really sweet in taste and not at all good. Rather i like ginger martini. We got 1:1 offer on cocktails and Smirnoff which was a good deal. Now coming to the food, we tried dahi kebab which was good although nothing outstanding. The second item was bar-b-q chicken pizza (thin crust) which was really awesome with generous cheese and toppings. We asked for some paan rasna sheesha which was great again. Altogether it was a depressing pub because of the unavailability of drinks and we didn't like that really loud music although song selection was not bad. The crowd was OK type mostly office going people. Pocket pinch was moderate (slightly higher you may say). I don't know whether I 'll visit this place again or not as there are some other better pubs nearby.

Went their with my one of friend n boyfriend and luckily arrived during their happy hours which was 1:1 on all food items. We ordered beer n martini for startup and then ordered beer battered fish fry and lamb steak for the main course. Martini was very refreshing.The beer battered fish fry was great. The fish was tender and tasted good too and it was served with white sauce. Then coming to the lamb steak, it was served it mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies. The lamb was a bit hard and not tender which was a bit disappointing. Nevertheless the staff were very courteous.

Was very excited to visit Bakstage but the experience turned out to be quite dull. We ordered mojito, pinnacolada and molten chocolate. The food was good and priced reasonably and music was awesome but the service time and staff behaviour was a total let down. It's really weird if you are eating and one of the waiters are standing at the head of the table continuously as if keeping an eye on you. Also, 500+Tax for 30 minutes at the pool table? Wow, that's a first time for me. I've never seen any pub charge for pool tables so I don't know how that works out for them. So an okay-ish experience and not too keen on going back.

what to say..Me and my fiance decided to throw our pre wedding party for 17 people here at backstage.We already had a reservation for the same.Never thought Backstage could disappoint us like this. I mean how could you call a place A Lounge without any music and ambience. When we entered they said the music system is down and they can't help with it.We entered at 4:30 pm the lounge was almost empty with 2-3 attendants,all busy in there own world.We had to constantly ask for arrangements for 17 people even after pre reservation.
Finally they somehow managed with a boring music by 6 pm . Frankly we did not get the feel of a lounge at all throughout.
There were no proper lights for our table..we literally had to struggle to see our food.When we asked for some help ..an impolite reply came from an attendant stating "This is a pub and the lighting in a pub will be like this" --As if we people have no idea how pubs are supposed to be and the funny part was after such response that attendant somehow dropped his own tray accidentally breaking few glasses as he missed a bar of a chair which was blocking his way. What an irony!¬†

Anyway we were not at all pleased with their service and attitude.Food was ok but it does not justify their prices. We have been to backstage before and that's why we were shocked to see
pathetic condition.

Was there in my first office party. 

All the drinks were good. Starter items were just too good. Main course were moderate. 

All the staffs are very good in behavior and helpful too. Nice experience.

This was when it had no such competition one of most happening pubs in town.
People used to come from all the parts of the city to attend the parties and live music events here.
Situated on the main road of sector 5 - ideally located and easily accessible
Food - worth the price
Sheesha - good
Service and hospitality - i would say as the rest but better somehow

It was almost an hour past mid night when we went in, a gang of 8.. The service was really quick and no compromise with the taste at all. The charming decor will surely attract the young corporate crowd. It's one of best quick booze places I ve ever been to.

If you stay in Salt Lake or work in the Sec V/Rajarhat area, I‚Äôm sure you have heard about Bakstage, the Resto Rock Pub.¬†It came as a blessing for people who work in that area because till then, apart from a few restaurants, there was no place where you could go to after work to unwind, have a few drinks, listen to good music and also eat¬†good food.¬†Bakstage changed all that three years back and even though a few similar places have opened since then, the original one still rocks!

Went on 31st night to spend time with family. Service was so slow and poor that we have to wait for almost 45 minutes to serve with drinking water, forget about the food. Have to returned half-full stomach as there was no one to give you menu to order food. Further, to pay bill, we have to go downstairs and authority asked to pay without printed bill. On insisting, they give us handwritten bill. To the most shocking of us, at very next table to us, they serve pizza with chicken toppings instead of paneer toppings. So, BEWARE before visiting BAKSTAGE.

We were hoping to have the lunch buffet. But sadly we were told that it has been discontinued. I was with a friend who kept asking for different brands of beer but none of those were available. Since I dont drink I ordered a fresh like soda. But a good offer was going on which  was buy one and get one free on food only. We ordered "nimbu mirch ka kalmi" (It was basically a tangri kebab in a Malai kebab marinate). It tasted okay as there wasn't enough char on the meat as you would expect in a kebab. We also ordered a thin crust grilled chicken pizza. And needless to say we got 2 of both the things. The staff was helpful and efficient.

The place used to be the only place for sector 5 but now it remains deserted. The concept of happy hours all day (drinks were priced at double rates anyways), however the food is good over here. 
The music is okay, it used to be great earlier. 
Staff has changed and so has the service. It's falling.

This has been my second visit to Backstage, last one being almost 2yrs ago. It's safe to say this is clearly one of the best boozing places in Kolkata as it offers not only a wide array of liquors but also cocktails and really tasty good food. Top it up with a 1:1 offer on Sunday night and your weekend is complete!
The ground floor is cafe cum restaurant. Complete with modern decor and wine bottle racks and a bar too. 
Now the first floor is where the real deal is. A huge pub. The bar is stocked up with all kinds of Alcohol you could think of. Go ahead , get your drink, puff on the hookah and realx ! Great for hangouts with large group of friends too. The entire balcony outside is the smoking zone   
To the food now .
We took #Beer Batter Fish ! It's a must for starters. It was so good we ordered a repeat of it. Then we had some basic dry chili chicken which really goes well with the whiskey! 
A Chicken tandoori pizza was ordered as well. Lots of  chicken diced, lots of cheese, thin crust perfectly done. One of the best pizzas in town :) 
I would really have loved it, if it had a dance floor too with the neon lights and all. Bt nevermind, it's still a hip place to go!

Went to this place last night with my friends. We took a table for 6 at the pub in 1st floor. The place looks good as in ambience and lights but they couldn't get us any beer other than corona. Food was not dat good. Crowd was like too much sophisticated. There is not much place if you want to shake a leg.

Nice place and location is the plus. Went for drinks with some of my childhood friends, met them after almost 2 decades so wanted a place for a long round of goppo (bengali phrase for gossip)... my first visit and it did not disappoint me, it was less crowded being Nabami early evening hours... drink and food choices are great, what i felt was that they play music very loud at the second floor bar so if you are in for real "goppo" then that's a interruption and you may feel annoyed but not a factor if you love loud music and drinks. Wine bar on level 1 surely felt much more relaxing.

Backstage is now evolving as a proper nice pub, but the staff mentality is still cheap.. request the new manager to educate the staff please.... 
They are playing best songs... above expectations in a Kolkata pub 
Food is okay...
The Oktoberfest snitzlel was absolutely lame and horrible, but their normal menu pasta still rocks. ...
Mixed feelings... bad staff... worst and absurd "snitzel" .... but awesome music... drinks price above normal, but on the whole not bad...
So the backstage stuff...pls read the review... overcome the short comings... and i will visit u regularly for your music... u have the capability  to become awesome

Poor service, misleading advertisement on drink offers. They will tell you Corona one on one free, but each Corona will cost you Rs.780. They have put a big advert in front of shop as buy 2 beer get 3 free, but on your visit they will tell you, offer not available. There are no complementary "chakhna" with drinks. Ha ha

One point I want to mention, they are serving ¬†Rs. 55/- Foster ¬†pint beer @ Rs. 250/- so you can easily understand ,it's not a pocket friendly at all. For rest of the things, thumbs up :)¬†

Backstage is a nice place to hangout and chill with friends. You get awesome music, booze, dance floor and all that you need to make your weekend happening. Food is good here but I tried only a couple of dishes. I primarily went for drinks and loved them and the ambiance is pretty good to. You also have an open area for chilling. Overall, it was a nice experience.

Though the review comes quite late but no wonder this place has it all. Sector 5 is soon gearing up to be like Park street and Bakstage proves it. Being invited for a bloggers table I witnessed these guys have mastered their culinary skills so well. I loved their desserts as well as sizzling starters. The ambience suits well well for all those who love to party to the core.
Would love to visit again.

I was interested to see the 'longest bar in the city', so I dragged my boyfriend along for our anniversary date. First of all, the people at the reception weren't exactly welcoming. They took down our details including where we worked (which I thought was totally unnecessary).
The pub is in the first floor. It also serves hookah, so be prepared for a lot of smoke. That night was a Sufi night with a terrible band (and here I was in the mood to dance). The only good thing was that the pub staff was great, and there was a B1G1 offer on beer. The decor is quite nice with vinyl records and posters on the wall, but not much to show for the longest bar.

Went here on a weekday with two of my colleagues.  The place is really made with an effort. Thumps up for their decor and ambience. The ground floor and the upper floor made intentionally different to reach out to different mindset. 
Was shocked after gone through the menu card.....it's really too costly. 
The chicken salad we ordered was decent and we ate without complains. Service was good and employees were very courteous. But prices are really way too high and when international brand like Chili's , TGIF etc are here in Kolkata with more decent pricing.....work on it guys.

Backstage is one of the best pubs in Sector 5. In the ground floor the ambience is very cozy and calm. You can sit by the bookshelf and order a drink. You will have the best time with yourself. As you go to 1st floor the ambience changes completely. The place is dimly lit with quirky decors on the walls. There is good music and staff is extremely friendly. The bar is done up very nicely.  The hookah is quite good and the taste of the food is really tasty. The alcohol is a bit costly. There is a smoking area as well which is basically the balcony. In the weekends this place has a great party atmosphere. Though a little pricey this place is a must visit for everyone. :)

I went here casually on a weekday after I returned from work early and was bored for the evening. There is not much room for parking, so one might have to arrive rather early to find decent parking. Really chilled out place, cool interiors. Felt really relaxed, until of course I saw the price tags on the food and drinks. We sat by the book shelf and grabbed a book each. Their ground floor is super relaxed and calm, whereas all the fun and pubbing happens in another place. So one can choose the ambience. Great thinking really by them. 

Coming to the food, we ordered a Caesar salad and some chicken salad. Caesar salad met my expectations, bland in the right places, tangy in some and crispy in others.¬† The basil really added to the flavour. The chicken salad was decent and we ate without complains. The bill, a little hefty for what we had ordered arrived in a small guitar case.

I really look forward to going back there sometime soon.¬† I have experienced the relaxed, now would like to see the pumped up!

The evening there was a great pleasant occasion..
The beer was icey cold..to be served in a chilled glass would be a welcome innovation.
The food we ate was very well cooked and presented, and most importantly, wonderfully tasty.
The restaurant and bar area has a nice, clean and modern appearance and a comfortable atmosphere.
I would unreservedly recommend this establishment.

UPDATE.. 9th March 2017..
On my return visit to Kolkata, I simply had to return here for more..
BUT NOT TO BE. !!!!
The service was sloppy and disinterested.
Trying to order beer was a complicated ordeal....specifically, although on the menu, when we tried to select brands of beer, we were told "beer is not available here, but we can get it for you from upstairs, on a 2 for 1, Happy Hour deal.
When the final bill arrived we were charged 696rp (including taxes & Service charges)..for EACH bottle.....where on their menu we ordered from, it is Iisted at 375rp each....they then tried to explain by showing us a menu we had not seen, or were shown, previously, which dispayed a higher price.
They refused to adjust the bill accordingly and insisted on full payment!!!
I consider these practices to be highly immoral and most unprofessional.
This is most disappointing as the food and atmosphere of this establishment deserve much better service and ethics.

Recently Bakstage organised a bloggers meet in association with Communication 2.0, where they invited the best of the best bloggers of the city to try out the food they serve. Was lucky that I was among the privileged few who got the invite. First thing first, even the invite was mind blowing. A vintage vinyl record & an audio CD containing some of the evergreen English hits, it was a simple peek of what the Bakstage experience was going to be.
Located bang at the webel more of salt lake sector V, Bakstage itself is quite unassuming from the outside. Sure the logo & name gives you a hint, but the ground floor section behind the glass walls are nothing like what it is upstairs. It‚Äôs after you take the elevator to the first floor, you are literally floored by the ambience. A dimly lit d√©cor perfect for a pub, with great music playing in the background, you are half intoxicated already. The walls are decorated with vinyl records, guitars & rock band posters which complement the setup completely. There‚Äôs live screening of matches, & even a pool table for the interested. The space has been divided into various sections . I particularly liked the idea of the balcony being used as the smoking area. Specially since you are allowed to bring your food & drinks outside & enjoy it while looking at the busy street below.

Sure the logo & name gives you a hint, but the ground floor section behind the glass walls are nothing like what it is upstairs. It‚Äôs after you take the elevator to the first floor, you are literally floored by the ambience. A dimly lit d√©cor perfect for a pub, with great music playing in the background, you are half intoxicated already. The walls are decorated with vinyl records, guitars & rock band posters which complement the setup completely. There‚Äôs live screening of matches, & even a pool table for the interested. The space has been divided into various sections . I particularly liked the idea of the balcony being used as the smoking area. Specially since you are allowed to bring your food & drinks outside & enjoy it while looking at the busy street below.

Lipsmacking food and drinks served at Bakstage!

If Music, Fun and Enjoyment ever went out missing at the same exact time, Bakstage is the place where you would find them all. Down under the same roof, this is the place where happiness meets the culinary world, and promises you to take on a never ending cruise, to another world, where some soul pleasing tunes would keep you mesmerized, while you would probably be feasting upon some lipsmacking delicacies. Located in a busy area at Salt Lake Sector V, this is one place, which has received all the buzz since they have been in operation. And rightly so, the d√©cor, ambiance and their service is top-notch, and gives you the perfect return of your well spent money. The place as such, can easily be spotted from the main road, while on your way from College More to SDF/Infinity Bus Stoppage. A transparent glass laden building, the very sight of people sitting inside comfortably and relaxing themselves over a glass of drink, is enough to tickle your senses and tempt you to rush inside leaving everything behind.

The place is divided into two separate sections. The ground floor is called as the Wine Room, while the first floor is where the main restaurant-cum-bar is located. I have been to this place countless number of times in the past, but all of them were for take-away. The menu here seems to have undergone a complete revamp and change, but in the good old days, dishes like Clay Pot Chicken, Jack Daniels Chicken and Pot Roasted Mutton were some of my absolute favorites. Very recently, I got the very first opportunity to get a dine-in opportunity, as a sudden warm invitation came knocking at my door with a lovely Vinyl record, with some good oldies and classics, and a Audio CD, with evergreen notes. It was a invite to Bakstage for a bloggersmeet for an extensive food and drinks tasting session. Without a shadow of the doubt, my foodie and liquor bones inside me got pretty charged up and kept counting the days till finally the date arrived.

It was my first time to the actual restaurant. Took the lift, which guided us upstairs. A dimly lit place, with having probably the largest bar counter in Eastern India. Comfy sitting options all around with quirky posters and picture frames adorning the walls. Besides various musical instruments, records, snaps and quotes from some well known musicians, names of popular bands were found scribbled on the walls and floors all around. The low light ambiance was in much contrast to the sharp tinge of light at the bar, and created a magnificent hue to keep your dumbstruck and intoxicated. For those wanting to try their hands on some sticks and balls, while having a shot of Tequila, one could have the Pool Table at their disposal. For smokers like me, there is a open area space at the balcony, with yet some comfortable looking couches. Looking across the busy and packed stretch roads, the Jack Daniel marked ashtrays elevates the mood to a different level.

Coming to our food expeditions, following were the food items and drinks we tried:

Vegetarian Starters:

1) C4 => Corn, Crumb, Cheese, Coin.

Undoubtedly, one of the best starters for the evening. Had a seamless and well mixed combination of corn, crumb, cheese and coin, all put together and wrapped in a batter, and fried till light brown. The mixture had the perfect sprinkling of spices. The inside was oozing with flavors and complemented with lovely mozzarella cheese. Each of these fritters was topped with a small dollop of tartar dip, olives, pickles and some herbs. 

2) Backed Potato Jacket, Baked & Stuffed: Two large portions of potatoes,  which was used with their skin-on, and had a nice large scoop of stuffed and flavored mozzarella. The potatoes were then bakes to perfection, with a cheesy flavor all around. Topped with some mints and herbs, and served with some vegetables on the sides, a single order of this dish, is sufficient to fulfill your desire of having a nice and fingerlicking starter.

Non-Vegetarian Starters:

3) Beer Battered Fish Fingers: Move over the traditional Bhetki Fry or Topshe Bhaja, this new concept of Beer Battered Fish Fingers is clearly one of the many things, which has been taken from the west. The addition of Beer, made the item crispier, tastier and fluffier. Not sure what was the fish which was used, probably Basa, but it was pretty fresh and flaky. The fingers were long and elongated in size, and were brunched together inside a fine quality conical paper, something which one may have seen while purchasing Jhaal Muri or Bhel Puri from the roadside vendors.

4) Nazza: A never ending tale of a romantic story, where Italy and Punjab fell in love with each other. Inspite of their cultural and social differences, with varying tastes and likes, with different complexions and colors, with their own unique culinary likings and preferred staples, they still managed to remain close with one another, and finally reunited with their soul partner in the form of a ‚ÄòNazza‚Äô. A modernized version of their neighbor ‚ÄòPizza‚Äô, this one has a Tandoor‚Äôed flat and thin sized Naan, which is used as a base. The upper surface is segregated into two halves, where both Italy and Punjab has got a share each to occupy the heart. One part has a usual spread of tangy Chicken Tikka portions, while the other, reminiscing of the long and lush green fields of Punjab, has a authentic and lipsmacking preparation of Dal Makhani. A common liking to both of them, Mozzarella Cheese holds and binds them together, and makes them stand out as a unique couple altogether. 

5) Sharabi Kebabi: Supposedly filled and stuffed with cheese, this was served on a platter, which later had one of the captains light up a flame upon a liquid and pour it all over, on top of this dish. The fire got hold of the entire area, and kept illuminating the chicken portions, creating a mere spectacle and a wonderful sight to behold. Unfortunately, this was one dish, which had disappointed us. Going by the catchphrase ‚ÄòSharabi‚Äô, this one missed the toxic quotient. Furthermore, the chicken portions as well as the cheese had gone hard. Not sure what was wrong here, hoping for an improved version of this during my next visit, whenever and if that ever happens!

6) Rocking & Smoking Fish Soola: More lika a Fish Maahi Tikka, this was a sheer treat to our tastebuds. Soft and succulent portions of boneless fish, marinated and then grilled to perfection with light char marks on the edges. The fish probably had a touch of cheese or cream too, but whatever the ingredients were, the flavors were bang on the target. Served the same way as Sharabi Kebabi, this too saw a flame being lightened upon a volatile liquid, which was then poured all over the plate, to create a smoke and fire of awesomeness. 

Cocktails: 

Not much of an alcoholic person. So will keep this portion a bit short and crisp to the point.

7) Sangria: Served with white wine and splash of juicy fruits, the senses of sipping in the liquid, with the sweet fruits touching the tastebuds, was a different experience altogether. Honestly, this was my first experience with a Sangria, and I couldn‚Äôt find anything to be disappointed about.

8) Beer Margarita: Had an inverted pint bottle of Kingfisher Beer, kept on a glass at a slanting angle. The glass was filled up with tequila, ice cubes and lemon wedges. A separate short glass consisting of some sweetener was also provided to counter the alcohol, if found meddling with your senses.

9) Akhir An Nahr: Was more like a Breezer with very slight indication of being anything distantly related to alcohol. This one felt like a Strawberry Mojito (Cocktail), with lemon zest and mint to give the drink a tangy touch. Deriving its root from Iran, this is probably one of the few places in India, where this drink is served.

Main Course:

10) Thai Green Curry: Ordered this one on insistence of one of my co-blogger. A bit less aromatic, the consistency of the ingredients did not seem right to me. Although, tastewise, the spices were up to the mark, but ingredients like basil leaves and others which basically enhances the aroma, were not¬†
put in the right proportion. Served with steamed rice, a single offering should be sufficient for two.

11) Half Roast Chicken with Jack Daniel BBQ Sauce: This dish has always been one of those of my absolute favorites at Bakstage, and rightly so, this one still keeps ruling over my heart. Juicy and large sized chicken portions, sauted in a mix of Jack Daniels and tangy and sweet BBQ Sauce. Served with vegetables on the sides, and a small bowl of the flavorful sauce, this is one dish which you shouldn‚Äôt forget to order, if you happen to be around. 

Desserts:

12) Melting Bak-lava: A round shaped Chocolate Ball, where the outer layer was filled with fine and rich dark chocolate and the inside or the core was filled with Bak-lava. More like a dome, the center part at the upper portion completely cracked off, when Chef poured some hot Chocolate Sauce on top of this structure, revealing the inner self. The Baklava portions were mostly creamy, chocolaty, nutty, buttery and a bit sloppy. The sugar content was slightly high, but then when you are having something sweet and killing as this one, you shouldn‚Äôt really mind about the content of the sugar used. Ideal for a large group of four, do not try this one if you are alone.

Several other drinks like Long Island Iced Tea, Chocolate Kit-Kat Shake, a couple of other mocktails, some shots and a fine and strong hookah were also served for the evening. The entire saga was concluded wherein we were handed over a fine box of nice round shaped dark chocolates. Speaking about these chocolates would be yet another trip to wonderland. But then, for the evening, we could not have been more pleased, happy and satisfied, being treated to such a nice splash of drinks and exquisite spread of food. There is absolutely no doubt, that I would drop in again, real soon. For this is one place, which keeps continuously drawing me towards itself, no matter how many times do I pay this place a visit!

This is the worst place I have ever been in my entire life! Seriously this is definitely not a place for young girls and guys for hangout or party. 
We party all the time and spend a lot, but never regretted this bad for spending 20+k for 5 people in this horrible place and the pathetic service provided.

Me and my 4 friends visited this place on 08/19 night as all other places we wanted to go in sector 5 were packed. had no other choice than getting in here which we did regret later. 
we friends met after a year and wanted to have great time. We specifically wanted to have some shots which we asked the manager initially whether they have or not. He trapped us in there saying they have it. But later when we ordered food and settled down they apologized saying they did not have that specific drink sufficient and arranged from upstairs (this is what they kept saying), we got it for only once. Now i cant trust may be they gave us something else. 

1. We had beer, vodka and Whisky followed by 6 different kind of shots including absinthe(I hope i have spelled that correct) and tequila shots. All i can say is it felt like we had flavored water and nothing else. We all drink and we know how it feels after taking 4-5 shots. not 1 or 2 but all of us felt this.
When a person who gets high on 2 beer was walking and talking fine after all this , you know something was goofed up.

2. We noticed 27% WBST tax in our bill. I have visited several pubs in Kolkata and had never seen this before.
We asked the manager about it, he said their restaurant policy imposes this tax as per state govt rule. Seriously? 

This is a heads up for those who plan to get in to any pub when no other choice- Please pick up drinks and party at your own house than ending up in some horrible place like backstage where your hard earned money gets wasted in a wrong way.

Owner of this place should seriously read all the reviews here. You are doing business you better be concerned about what customers say, train your staff and teach them some manners.¬†

This is the FIRST time I ¬†have been to this place and this is the LAST. Experience was horrible. The restaurant was not only overpriced but also full of fraud and cheap people with no etiquette. ¬†I am just trying to write down our horrible experience...¬†

We 5 friends visited this place on a Friday evening for boozing. Before settling down we made sure some specific drinks are available.

-- Firstly, When we ordered for that specific drink.to our surprise,the waiter said drink was not available. But when we asked the manager, he somehow managed to serve it only once.

-- Secondly,they took at least 30 mins to serve any drink we ordered. The restaurant was not crowded either. And every time excuse being- checking the availability -"It was not available in the bar, so went upstairs to bring that".

-- Thirdly,every drink was diluted. Even after drinking hell lot of shots and vodka and what not, we were NOT at all drunk !! ¬†I mean c'mon ¬†Who can stand still after drinking that much !! We could not even feel the throat burning sensation.¬†

-- Fourthly,the behaviors of the staffs were very rude. Whenever we were asking for the menu card he was like "TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT. I'LL GET THAT" with a face with lot of ¬†irritation.

And finally when we asked for the bill ,to our shock the "WBST @ 27%" was taken for the foods we have ordered. And when asked for the reason, the waiter was literally yelling at us !! And the conclusion was "restaurant policies!" ¬†They could not even give a proper justification for the bill amount. After arguing for long time, we finally paid the bill.¬†

Surprisingly the hookah we ordered was not included in the bill and they took Rs 500/- cash for that which was supposed to be Rs.300/- as per the menu.

At the end of the day our weekend was spoiled and so was our money.¬†

This place should be banned. They are robbing people in the name of Govt.

I just hope this place closes down as soon as possible.Had been to the pub few days back , ordered for cheesy French fries, instead they gave a ruined dish.Returned it and ordered for french fries only.By the time it came ,it was too late and my beer was over, however in the end when I got the  bill in it was mentioned cheesy french fries .Complained to the waiters ,they said its an error in billing and extra amount of Rs 100 will be adjusted with some other food but bill cannot be changed or rectified.Then I spoke to the manager , he was drunk and a complete non sense.I was with my wife hence didn't want much trouble , so after few arguments I took a cake and left by paying the amount.My point is today it's matter of Rs 100 only but if they make mistake of Rs 5000 then also we will have to take stuff of same amount even if we don't want it.Why should customer suffer for their billing fault ?

This place offers a dance floor, a long bar counter, a pool table if you want to have a game with your drink. Shesha is equally brilliant as the drinks and the food. A must visit place for everyone. .

Bloggers Meet over Food tasting session at Bakstage

First of all, I was floored by the invitation that I had received through post from Bakstage. It was an invitation to attend the Bloggers Meet at their place over some great food and beverages. The invite contained a vintage Vinyl record which I‚Äôll cherish for the rest of my life and an amazing CD with evergreen numbers like Hotel California, Coming back to life, Summer of ‚Äô69, etc. So, after receiving this invite I was certain that the meet is going to be great especially with so many bloggers being invited under one roof. And my prediction was perfectly on target. 
I had been to Bakstage numerous times previously, since it is in the heart of the techie alleys of Kolkata (i.e. Salt lake Sector-5) where I have been spending a major part of my life for professional reasons. This place surely has got the zing to bring people back, especially at the pub with the longest bar counter in Kolkata. The ambiance is amazing with some of the best rock numbers being played all the time, things are bit shady with a dimly lit surroundings which somewhat helps you to unwind real fast. You will find lovely posters and framed pictures related to rock music on the walls. Also the walls adorn some musical instruments and accessories like vinyl records (like the one that I had received), guitars, violins, etc. Also you will notice a lush green pool table in front of the projector screen playing some television channel round the clock. Also you will be amazed if you sometime get to see this long bar counter being lighted up with flames; well, we had planned for it but never really got the chance to stay back and enjoy that sight. Also there is an outdoor smoking area attached with lovely JD themed ashtrays and comfy couches in that balcony overlooking the busy traffic of Electronic complex.

I am disgusted by this place and sincerely hope it shuts down. Let me explain why. Backstage, at sector 5 is located near my college and I have visited it several times. Over the years I have witnessed the service deteriorating gradually at first, and then by leaps.
I will highlight my experience today as this is the final time I will be visiting this place. Two of my friends and I decided to visit the pub on the first floor of Backstage. We were unpleasantly surprised at the high mark up on prices of alcohol. Anyway, we opted for the 1+1 offer and ordered 3 Fosters pints and were supposed to get 3 pints free with it. Within fifteen minutes of placing this initial order, we did not wish to have 2 of the pints ordered and requested the waiter to amend our order to reflect 2+2 instead of 3+3. He refused and said the bill had already been "punched in". We requested him to allow us to speak to his manager. The manager was "busy in a meeting" and we were made to wait for half an hour to speak with him. Finally he arrived and that's when the disgrace began.

We calmly explained to him that we wish to slightly amend our order and we no longer need 2 of the pints we had initially ordered. He told us there was no option of changing the order. I highlighted that we were not told this before or while placing the order. He became defensive and abusive. He started telling us we have no choice but to pay. That he has other problems and our order was definitely not one of them. We asked him for an explanation as to why it was impossible for him to accommodate our reasonable request when every other restaurant we visit would allow the same without an issue. He retorted that's not his problem. He kept citing the excuse of having to pay excise tax. We happened to tell him that we are lawyers by profession and understand what he means but it still doesn't explain his claim. He informed us that we cannot be lawyers. Subsequently, after this barrage of vitriolic behavior, he said he has no further time to spare and disappeared. We were compelled to pay for the remaining beers which we did not want. I have the following suggestions for the management:
1. Kindly try to be polite to your guests. We are the reason you exist.
2. Get a new manager.
3. Change your billing system which doesn't allow customers to put forth reasonable requests for modification in the order.

Pathetic place, and never visiting again. Strongly recommend everyone to NOT waste your time or money by visiting.

Drenched and tired me and a couple of friends went to Bakstage to chill for sometime before leaving for a movie. We had called them up initially to make sure if they have happy hours. On reaching the place we 3 ordered beer (fosters) (1:1) so technically 6 beers and plate of spicy chilli chicken. Later however we decided that we would get late so we asked the waiter attending our table to take away the 2 untouched bottles of beer and that we'd change the order from 6 to 4 beers. Since the beers were unopened and we had taken 2 rounds of 1:1 beer so we asked them to charge us for 4 beers instead of 6. At first the waiter simply refused to do so saying that they had already punched the bill in the system and no alteration of the liquor order was possible. We kept on persisting that we had not taken a packaged deal so..1:1 would mean 2 beers and since we had drank 4, we should be charged for 4 and not the initially ordered 6 beers. On asking for the manager, we were told that he was in a 'meeting'. He got back to us 10 minutes later and kept on persisting on the same point. I kid you not, I have never had to speak to a more rude manager in my life. He spoke to us in the most demeaning manner and even questioned our education. On saying that we were all lawyers, he countered us by asking what L3 and l4 meant. Lol. He expects a law graduate to be aware of every law policy and every clause under the sun üòÇ He said that punching the bill after the person is done eating is not an option, we HAVE to pay for the beer which we have not drank/ canceled. Ultimately we ended up paying for the canceled order. While coming down the stairs we found the manager standing by the door not in any so called 'meeting'. This place is the least accommodating place I've ever been to. It's overpriced and the manager is rude. One of the worst experience of my life.

Been here for lunch with a group of cousins and friends...
Not a very big space still manageable and the interiors are nicely done...
The buffet was good but lacking variety...
Should be trying their pub shortly...
Management was good and helpful...
They even have a live counter and the white sauce pasta was the hit of them all...

Backstage is a place for those who love to drink than eating. It's basically a pub where they offer live music and a good ambiance too. Chicken platter are really good, their captain chicken offers good taste too along with nun, but please do not try for pork chops there. It's horrible in taste. Chilly Pork are so so

This very is definitely very famous and I can see what the hype was all about. Although, the service people need to be a little more attentive and lively. They are making this wholesome experience of music, liquor, food a bit dull. Amazing food and really liked the music at the end after our intervention to change it. Last thing, dude nobody is going to pay 500 just to play half an hour pool game.. come on guys. Cut us some slack and make it 100 per half an hour max. Cheers!!

Bakstage is very easily accessible opposite to the famous webel more. Being a lounge as well sports bar gives a bit of nostalgia to music lovers with pics of John lenon,  Kurt Cobain, Elvis to name a few. It is great when it comes to weekend parties with friends for booze and drinks. I have been there and yes had a great time dancing to some party tracks. Great crowd added to the fun. During happy hours yes 1 on 1 pint üçª. Food is decent but pricey. Dahi ke kebab, chilli chicken were good.

Bakstage is well located, opposite webel more in Sector V, Salt lake. They have a lounge with separate PDR, a Cafe and banquet facilities under the same roof, visited with a friend couple of months back and ordered a mediterranean platter and a few drinks, the quality of food is good but service is a bit cold, need to have more warmth for this kind of elite outlet.

I have visited a lot of pubs in Kolkata and this place is by far my favourite. The crowd is always nice and the drinks are well-priced. They have a good variety of pizzas and snacks available here and most importantly, the music is very good. They play a variety of genres ranging from Classic Rock to the Pop Hits of the 80s and 90s as well as contemporary music. The ambiance is very relaxed and the service is decent. Keep it up guys !

Bakstage is relatively a new destination for the  Sector5 foodies in the prime location of Webel More.. 
The service has improved everytime I visited , though there are rooms for improvement , the dishes they suggested were good and unique.Diversity of dishes is something to watchout for. Also one of the restaurant in Sector5 where u wl find Hukka and Beer Tower. 
Ambience of this restaurant give it a edge over the other average bars around.There are few sections of this place , so ask for availability and choose your best seat..
Cheers !!

Bakstage is prominently located in Sector 5 area and is known for its quirky interiors and party vibe. I have been here a number of times and enjoyed the appetizer menu as well as hookah. My orders:
(1) Dahi ke kebab
(2) Chilli Chicken
(3) Trio of Hummus
(4) Falafel Chips

All the items I have had are served fresh. However, sometimes a lot of food items from the menu are not available, which I feel is my biggest concern. Other than that, everything else about Bakstage is decent enough.

Biggest blunder was made by us last night. After dinner we wanted to have desserts at some other place. Landed at Bakstage with out checking the rating on zomato. Was surprised how they even have a 2.4 rating. Should be much much lower. Pathetic everything, except the d√©cor. The staff seem like they are doing you a favour. Disgusting attitude and behaviour. Long long wait for everything. And was surprised how the others were OK with this. Kolkata definitely needs to wake up and outright ignore such black moles.

We went on a Thursday and almost none of the cocktails were available! They claim is happy hours - but all they could offer was Mojito! And the Mojito tasted like a mocktail!! 
And worse is their music - its so loud and thumping, that too on the normal seating area, thete is no way you can relax and drink let alone talk to your friends! If you want to make it a dance floor do so, but don't keep the seating area so close to the supposed dance floor so that our ears are blown away! 

Ambience -  2 (Loud and bad music gave us headaches)
Drinks - 1.5 (Worse drinks, almost no alcohol, most drinks not available)

Been to Backstage once with a friend. Its located at Webel mode and its impossible to miss it. Ambience wise it was 4 out of 5. The music was pretty loud and really didn't see anyone using the dance floor. They have happy hours throughout the day I guess. Its one on one on beer and standard drinks. The food was not that bad. What I loved about the place was it's smoke zone. A long open airrd balcony where they have couches to sit and enjoy your smoke. Found it to be an expensive place.

Want to have some amazing fish and chips? Please visit backstage! It was mouthwatering and a must try for all foodies out there. I liked the chilli chicken as well but fish and chips was the best. Also, they have happy hour on Sunday evenings...so what more do you need to make it the best adda joint to catchup with your friends and loved ones?!

There is a quite big sign board that tell us about happy hours, what is the meaning of happy hours ?? we are not happy at all neither ¬†of the services like the presentation of food nor the bill, we order some fruit juice with some chicken kebab and paneer ¬†kebab simultaneously, they just served the drinks after 30 mints, and food are served just after waiting for another 45 mints after completing the drinks. But i must say the ambiance is good.

What should be one of the most happeneing and classiest places on calcutta is a disappointment. I visited bakstage on a Wednesday, the much talked about 'sufi nights ' and was bitterly left asking more from this place.

It has 3 seperate sections, two floors which is a resteraunt area which you can come and have a quiet meal and a lounge area where all the action happens.

Ambiance : On Entering the pub, you will instantly be pleased with the the decor and how everything just fits in seamlessly. Gold lights and wooden furniture compliment each other well. Loved the ambiance. Totally classy.

Service : Pathetic. You might as well eat at a roadside stall and they will probabaly give you better service. The staff couldn't care less about you. We waited for one hour for the staff to take our order where he came to our table and left multiple times. Drinks arrived but without ice. Service time is not great either.

Drinks : We ordered whiskeys. Nothing great about the presentation of any cocktail either.

Food : The naan pizza was quite good and is quite an innovation. The platter is quite decent.

Music : I was looking forward to the much hyped sufi nights. Was disappointed. A live band played till 10:30 and I just didn't like their genre of music. A few good songs were played later but I can honestly say, it will not wow you.

It is not worth going. Too expensive for what they are offering which is just the rich ambiance and a classy crowd.

You will always find something interesting or other happening here. Be it some artist from out of town or a karaoke that is more home grown.  
Fun crowd and very attentive waiters. 

A special word for the owner who is the passion behind it all. You will catch him from time to time oversee the service and take personal care that everyone is comfortable. 

This personal touch is why I feel they have no competition.

I had an awesome experience with friends here... The food is invariably delicious. They serve hookah and alcohol as well. The ambience wonderfully done and will give you a party feel with some awesome music and DJ. Dance floor is also available. Highly recommended for party goers!

Bakstage is mostly known for their wine room and pub experience but this place also serves you food at their restaurant as well.

I was here for their lunch buffet on a Monday afternoon. The pricing was really attractive as it's 499 including taxes but unfortunately left me disappointed with the whole offerings.

Caution
-> No Ice cream for dessert
-> No Mutton
-> No Prawn

**Location**
Bakstage is located at one the major part of the city at saltlake sector v.  It can be easily located as it's at the crossing of webel more can be seen from the road. Parking at their own place available.

**Decor and Ambiance**
The smart choice of interiors and very classy furniture makes this place a perfect choice of hang out place with your friends and loved ones. The stairs added in has defiantly increased their style quotient in the Decor. 

**Food**
Starters were average but I liked the fact they were serving very frsh as it was made out of their live counters.

Dry chilli Chicken: was tasty and quite good.
Fish finger- This one was really good and the best in their starters. Loved it
Pizza - was okiash
Pasta- Too much of cream and less flavor
Paneer Kebab: No taste of the spices at all.. Didn't like it.

Mains :
This was the most disappointing part as most of the items served were not warm first of all and also lack of important dishes to make the buffet attractive. Veg variation was decently available though.

Butter Nan/ Kulcha
Dal makhani
Aloo dam
Mixed veg gravies in Chinese style
Steamed rice
Chicken (Indian gravy)
Noodles
Fried Rice
Fish ( Katla or Rui) No bhetki and No Prawn

Desserts:
Chocolate Fudge cake: Was very yummy and perfect for chocolate lovers. Only a scoop of ice cream were missing as a part of its side I would prefer.

Apple pie cake was not as per the taste. Didn't impress me much

Lack of sweets and ice cream in the desserts was a turn off.

**Service**
The warm reception at the beginning had set my expectations up and rising which very soon got spoiled with their slow service. My expectations were really high with the starters as there were live counters available for them but they failed to match that. 
The manager was extremely polite and have his best as a part of customer service but it has to improve in terms of food quality and item selection. Otherwise people will surely opt for thousand other buffet options in that area within that range.
Needs work. Thanks..

Been there a couple of months ago with one of my colleague on a Friday night. The place is a pretty nice one...loud music, crazy disco lights and even louder people. A small dance floor which is more often than not occupied by gang of after-office-partying boys. We tried a meat platter, don't remember the name which was Uber delicious. They have ongoing offers on beers almost all the time, too bad we couldn't avail them. Prices bit on the higher side. Service was okay.

Nice place, probably the only decent happening nightlife destination in Sector 5. A tad too loud sometimes, but hey, you are definitely not going here for a romantic dinner are you! Good quality food, absolutely loved the thin crusts they serve, not to forget the authentic but yet so yummy beer batter fish fries. If you are working around the IT sector, and hoping for a place to dump your weekly professional baggage and indulge in some boozy fun, this is the place. Stays open till quite late, so timing is never a problem.

Has a project Lunch there where we opted for the buffet spread. Though the cost is low, the service is not up to the mark. There were only 3 non veg starters where the chicken are not even boneless. Veg starters do not taste good. Very ordinary. Nice pastas and pizza. The noodles and other main course were nice. Again the desert spread was very limited. Only  pastry and fruits. Overall a mediocre experience.

I wish I could add some pics to this review but I have not taken any as we were all busy drinking and dancing. It was one hell of an office party as we completed one year of operations in Kolkata. The ambiance was electrifying, of course the booze was one of the reason behind it. Nevertheless, it's a good place to be at if you really want to have fun. It will give you a feeling of a discotheque though it is not one. Bottles of whiskey, beer, vodka were followed by Fish and Chips, Chilli Cheese Corn Fritter, Dahi ke Kebab, Thin Crust/Calzones Naaza, Amritsari Macchi with Masala Chips, Chilli Chicken. Food is ok. Service is very good. Dahi ke kebab and thin crust pizzas were specially good. Chilli chicken and some starters contain lot of onions and capsicum. You literally need to search for the chicken pieces among the heaps of onions and capsicums.

If you want to experience something different than a regular overcrowded Disc on a Saturday just be here. It's worth the Drive and Effort. The management is also very friendly and nice. I can say this as I am here every week for one of the weekend nights. Just Love it here.

Went there yesterday after office for the first time and had a wonderful experience. The ambiance is good, only one thing that bothered me was the music, as it was bit loud. Coming to the food it was really tasty. We had ordered Baked Chicken Winges with Spicy Aioli and Beer Batter Fish Fingers as Starters along with Beer (Carlsberg). Both the items were too good. The fish finger was simple but delicious. In main course we took Chicken Dum Biryani, which had a different taste altogether. Though the quantity was less, after tasting we shouldn't complain. Then came Meat Beliram, a dish which had khulcha and nun along with mutton curry. A dish worth tasting. We also had Spaghetti Aioli which was also very good. Overall a very good experience. We would definitely like to visit again. Only scope of improvement is that, the guys need to serve the food quickly.

Went with friends to enjoy the food and watch rcb vs Kol IPL match. Now whatever we were ordering was not available at 9pm !!! Be it mojito or their drink tasty beach or for that matter any mocktail. Then when I ordered for breezer...they could not serve it cold. Fish soola and molten alu kebab was not available and was informed 15minutes after we placed the order. Less items to eat and of that 70% not available. Finally we could eat...fish finger n chips, chicken pizza, chakhna platter and chicken wings. The presentation was good. Really lovely and tasted good too. But that could not make up for the bitter feeling already experienced.

The go to place on a Friday or Saturday night for every one residing in NewTown area. This place has come up fairly well in the time that has passed. Saturdays are a must go for the place, if you're looking for some fun in the IT hub of Kolkata. Hookah adds to the zing as you can let go the tense part of you with the flowing smoke. Open seating is also on the cards if a little calm is what you like. Food options are more than enough and the chef's are clinical in what they serve. A place worth the hype that surrounds it, is the jist.

Open seating is also on the cards if a little calm is what you like. Food options are more than enough and the chef's are clinical in what they serve. A place worth the hype that surrounds it, is the jist.

A good lounge to go with ur frns. But the drinks seem to be way too overpriced. The interior is one of its kind. The upper floor becomes just perfect for party animals after 10 pm. The music plays its charm well enough to attract people passing by. If you want to save some money happy hours is meant for you.

Very very very overpriced. Environment wise and food quality wise its okay...but not worth the money. On top of the overpriced food and drinks there were a pleathora of taxes.  For a meagre bill of 700 rupees tax itself was 230 rupees. I mean where in kolkata do you find such high percentage of tax and service charge ? Not really a place worth visit.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated. I specially liked their balcony which looks amazing at night.

The waiters are unprofessional and lethargic. They are mostly confused and often mess up with the order. Service is extremely slow.

Coming to the food. Starters are delicious and there are lot of varieties as well. But the main course is nothing   extraordinary.

Taking the suggestion from a dear friend, I went to bakstage after college one fine day. At 5 pm, the place is almost empty except for a few techies and pocket money starved students like us.¬†
The 1+1 offer has quite a variety.
The LIIT is good stuff.
We missed the open mic which was later in the day.

Probably the only reason this scores because of its location, otherwise nothing great about the pub.There are many better than this. Yes decor and ambience wise its good but the food is not at all upto the mark. Booze would be only preferred during happy hours.

We didn't enter the disc or what they have inside as there was some private party we sat in the outer section
The foods considering they have mostly finger foods only
We ordered fish finger
They didn't have
Which is very negative point considering they just have 5 or 6 starters
So we settled for chicken fingers
It was just average tasting
We ordered peanut masala
It had kind of a odd smell to it

Not much of a service to be spoken about
All over once is enough
And yes they didn't have the draught
We had to order the pint
Which is like ordering half glass of water

No offer no good music playing
Not much option for food
Atleast they shouldn't name it rock pub
Please not to mention there are better pub in sect v itself with good enough music to be named that

Overall a not again from me

LOCATION:

Situated on the main sector 5 stretch right next to Webel Mode. If you are on the stretch, you cant miss it.¬†

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Its a well done up place housed between multiple floors. The ground floor houses the cafe. It looks young with a good vibe and I personally liked the wine bottle decoration upon entering the place. There is a fuse ball table at the centre which looks cool. I was there for a private party last night so we took the elevator to the first floor which opened up into a nice pub/cum bar area. The private party room was situated to the right inside a glass enclosure. I liked the vibe of the place and it reminded me of the ever so popular old shisha night club on camac street. Dimly lit, with a large screen tv, a small open terrace for smoking and buffet.

WINE & DINE:

I tasted a host of snacks at the party. I liked the pizza they served. It had a good balance between the sauce and cheese. The masala peanuts were also good and fresh and I liked the falafels with dip as well. The bartenders were courteous enough and the music was good and lively. I am not much of a party freak so I would really not be able to comment on the party side of things anymore.

The reason for a low score is because of the service we received outside the party. My friends and myself were leaving and were waiting for our car on the ground floor when we decided to purchase a bottle of water from the ground floor cafe. I was surprised to find a service charge levied on a purchase of bottled water. I have been to quite a few Michelin Star restaurants and I am yet to encounter the same. Upon complaining of the same, the guy selling us the water told us, "its 100 if you take it without the the bill". That sort of sealed the night for us. It left a bad taste about the place.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

I really think the employees dealing with customers at Backstage need a course on customer satisfaction. I dont think it is fair to charge service charge on a bottle of water being purchased when you dont even have to serve it. I found that to be ridiculous !

VERDICT:

The place itself is good. The same cannot be said about the service though !

Located at the middle of hustle-full IT life, this place brings fresh air to the busy lives of us. It's actually lounge, bar and sports pub - all pushed into one. And I just love the music over there; they have one of best tastes (from Dylan to Denver, Jovi to Sufi) of music in the city. Whether go with the office colleagues, or be it a college reunion; it always has been a good experience for me.

This one has a big bar and suitable if you are visiting in big groups and even better if are visiting on the game day.
I was looking for draught beer and was a little disappointed when a bar as big as this one did not have the same. So we went for regular beer, Caesar Salad and Chili Chicken. I must say that the food was pretty good, the only complaint I have is that the drinks are over priced! And even the happier hour is lame coz the drinks are really priced so high that even if you are on happier hour, it still makes no difference.

Each time I have visited Backstage had some issues, either with the billing, or food, or staff. The table next to us were Jains and they were served Chicken Nachos! Imagine.
¬†On our last visit, they added, extra drinks. Once they got us an order when we were almost about to leave.

I will think before going now!

We went there yesterday to watch the IPL. Nice overall ambience, with giant projectors.

SERVICE - Extremely slow! We had to keep reminding them to get our order and serve us the drinks.

FOOD - We ordered Backstage Style Chilli Chicken, which is nothing but like an ordinary road style chicken¬†served with veggies. We also ordered their Veg Pizza - Oven roasted Mushroom, Corn, Onion and Jalapeno - this too was a waste. Could hardly find any corn or jalapeno!

DRINKS - Although Happy Hours were on, they couldn't serve chilled drinks! Half the drinks menu is not on Happy Hours btw! Please check before ordering.

It is a well done, spacious place. Since it is only the decent option in Salt Lake we visit. But one can give this place a miss.

Service was very poor (worst to be honest). Management was also not up to the mark. Though the food quality was OKAY, still variety needs to be there. We have taken the buffet lunch menu. As per the advertisement, it was written in and out side of the restaurant that the price is Rs 499 All Inclusive, but they have charged the taxes and made it Rs 640. Hence, not all the a good restaurant with such high price. And I suggest you, if you really want to have a good variety of food with good service, then you have much more other option than this poor high priced restaurant.

Yesterday we went there to catch kkr vs dd match. Surprisingly there was a championship going on, and we participated in ‚Ä™‚Äékingfishers‚Ä¨ Ultra Max Dart Championship and dart is such a focused game, enjoyed a lot. It‚Äôs a nice place for partying with some good music and nice ambiance n decor. Hospitality was pretty well. Drinks are overpriced, with an option of hookah. The foods were good, especially grilled fish, baked potatoes, salads. Backstage is a cool place to dance n have fun with friends.

Located in a prominent locality in sector V, this place is pretty decorative. The interior is spacious and beautiful. The food is pretty decent but the quantity is large. But one problem is, not all the menu was available on the day we went. (don't know whether that is a regular phenomenon or not). A good place to chill out with friends. :-)

It was a big day Ind vs WI, my partner and myself went in just on time I guess to get a seat. The entire restaurant was booked. It was very kind of Sandip to have arranged a seat for both of us. It's because of the hospitality of the staff whose brings me to this place. Driving from Jadavpur to Salt lake is a quite a distance but as I and my partner always says, good things and good service don't come for cheap. Then came out our favourite person Mr. Subroto. Not coming from a hospitality background and yet having such great hospitality skills makes him stand out amongst the rest. I understand it was a busy day but it's important for the manager to keep a smile on the face, else it becomes difficult for the rest of the staff to carry out a smooth service. Subroto took great care of us. This guy deserves a raise in the position. Great food, good shisha and electrifying atmosphere. DJ plays really cool songs. See you soon guys.

Ambience and decor: sports themed bar and restaurant with a playground themed balcony
Classy and very well managed, looks great and is comfortable

Wats on the menu: from everything to nothing, snacks are more sold and main course goes less

Quality and taste: quantity is satisfactory but taste and quality is a real let down, basically undercooked at times

Service and staff: well these people do a good job and attend and serve fast

Overall verdict: an after office drink shall be good but for dinner go elsewhere

It started off as a pretty good place a couple of years back. Good food and smiling waiters with responsive service. Not sure what's gone wrong. Food is now strictly okay but the service is really bad. We had to remind them for everything multiple times. People on other tables were also were facing the same problem. There wasn't too much rush and they didn't look understaffed so this is unacceptable. Looks like people visit this place only because of lack of other options nearby. Not sure how far they can go with the same attitude.

Must say the decor and ambience is very good. Live music and restaurant becomes a dance floor when crowd comes alive. I was there till late night so around 10pm we all found ourselves on the floor. Hookah is also available. The most amazing part is the balcony of it. You can even sit there in the soft comfy sofa and enjoy your evening taking sip of your favorite drink.
But must admit it is costly no doubt. We live once, so we can try it once.

Amidst the hustle bustle of the IT City, Backstage¬†has a surprisingly refreshing, sun-lit, kitschy ambience, albeit a bit discordant! The wine room is the popular watering hole of sector 5...however I went there for the buffet which was a¬†delightful mash up of Indian, Chinese, Pizza, Pasta¬†and¬†what not...however everything appeared¬†a tad dry and chewy - taste-wise okayish...dessert was pretty good. I missed a drink though! Even a fresh lime water would have been nice! Service was sluggish and left much to be desired...however 499 all inclusive¬†is a good pricing.

They have 1:1 on drinks and even on Breezer! 

This place is a little heavy on your pocket! 

We didn't try food there since we had dinner plans somewhere else! Must visit this place but a little late and obviously with a he'll lot of money! 

P. S. The staff over there needs to be COURTEOUS & POLITE. They are typically ARROGANT & RUDE!

Located at Cream location with decent ambience. 

Food Quality is pretty good. In starters Baby corn,  Fish and Chily Chicken are too good. One can also like the Wings.
In main course Chinese part is good and others average. in Sweets/Desert section there is pastry and mouse each and no other option. 

In sector-5, Within such low budget it is the best option I can suggest.

The decor of the place in kinda nice and the food was ok. However there is no personality. The staff were bored and even though the interior is smart its all a bit boring.I think I would go back to this place only because there aren't many options in and around this area.we had this lamb dish which was served on a skillet which was quiet nice but the quantity was too less.I would recommend other places in the vicinity priced within the same bracket which offer more inventive and tasty dishes.

I had never been here before so he took me to this place.
First of all it is worth mentioning that the ambience was lovely and i instantly fell in love with the bar counter.
We sat at the bar counter and had a clear view to the television right in front of us which was telecasting live Cricket Match of India-Pakistan Asia Cup 2016.
We had great fun watching the match all through the evening with drinks, food n hookah.
The staffs were very polite and prompt at service.
We had a great time together.
We would surely love to visit again..

By far one of the most pathetic places I've been to and regret recommending the same to my friends.

1. Our order is not served even 50 min after placing the same.
2. No staff was interested in attending to our table even though they are serving the adjacent tables.
3. Every time we would manage to get hold of someone, the only response would be "yes, it is ordered, we'll get it when it is ready"
4. We place an order for a beer, only for the staff to come back tell us that the beer is finished (can get that). We then place order for a different beer only for him to come back again and tell us that even this is not available!!
5. Finally after having enough of their pathetic service, we ask the staff to cancel our balance orders and get bill for the beers, they get us the bill without a single word of apology but rather proudly with a smile stating we have not charged you for anything we have not served.

Have vowed never to return to this horrible place and shall make it a point to warn my friends & associates to save them from the horrifying experience they might encounter there.

Went there recently on a friend's suggestion and it turned out this place seriously offers some finger licking buffet menu.
First, the ambience..this place has a swanky decor which makes you comfortable enough to hangout with your friends and continue with your chit-chats while you enjoy some good music and delicious foods.
Second, the staff was very cooperative and cordial. They helped us choose the right food item everytime we were confused what to choose exactly.
Finally, the food... What can I say about the food.. Everything is just so perfect about this place. The food was not just delicious enough to tickle our taste buds but also quite amusing to keep us gorging on more and more buffet items. üòÄüòÄ

Speaking as a vegetarian, awfully less choices available; the dishes are also average in taste. Good only for drinks and music. Have been there once only so can't say much
15/05/16: Just got to know what happened 6 months back, in November. Managers and waiters could not do such a thing without the support of the owner. Whatever be it, no staff can raise hands on the customer; but they just crossed all lines.
Never going there in again.

Well, was there on a lazy Sunday evening. The lounge seems well above average. Was not much crowded & could actually have some chitchats because of not much louder music. Prices are a bit on the higher side with taxes. Had the prices& taxes  been reasonable, this could have been a better & frequent place to hangout.

We went there on a dry day, Alas! Ordered Smoky hot wings (chicken wings), tasted pathetic. The chicken wasn't cooked well, and it tasted sweet given the fact that the menu puts a note below the dish asking for my spice tolerance levels and I don't remember asking for mercy. The bruschetta was good.

The ambience is great too. The service could , the waiters are snobbish.

This place could do better than 3.0 with some improvement in service and consistency in food quality.

Absolutely shocked with the management of the outlet though their shishas and selected food items are pretty good,  one needs to be very careful with the bill,  always remember to cross check their bill.  Not once,  twice or thrice but mistakes in their bill is quite a frequent thing that happens with me and a few friends. Can't say whether actually they have a system problem or their staff are instructed to add on the quantities.

Few frank opinion about this place is as follows :
1. The sound system is wonderful but the choice of music is not the best.
2. The waiters do not disclose the offers unless asked. One should always check the offers beforehand.
3. If you are in a mood to chat and not dance then this is certainly not the place.
4. The drinks are overpriced other than vodka.
5. The valet parking is a great booster here.
6. Try to order maximum drinks during happy hours if you intend to drink for long.
7. The printed table mats are wonderful. I collected two - Jimi Hendrix and Elvis

A Hip place to hop to on a Saturday night !

Last moment decision on a Saturday night and I walked into this beautiful, hip and popular place in town which made my night. Loved the interiors. The music was nice and the crowd was decent. The manager was very polite and welcoming which is not so common when it comes to popular watering holes. The waiters were very attentive and even at 12 at night got us a table to sit without making us wait for too long. The drinks were decently priced and also had the 2+1 offer which made it even better. Did not get the opportunity to try the food but I am sure it would not disappoint. 

I will surely hit this place again the next time I am in Kolkata.

Service is so so, as they weren't providing the basic services like filling up the glasses with water, providing napkins...And really in a winter night, the temperature inside was below the actual temperature outside!

I was very satisfied with this place and I am definitely coming back. There was this dish called Naaza or something like that, which tasted heavenly, one of the best dishes I had in a long time. It was Naan and dal makhni basically in the form of a pizza. It was wow. Exotic paneer platter was decent as well.

The pub culture has always been different in Kolkata than it has been in its peer cities. It was a maiden visit to the place. The ambience was very decent. They had a variety of alcohol and foods. The servers were amazing. Food was very good. The music kept it going and made the evening. 
Oh did I mention that the hookah was excellent.
Beer + hookah = happiness.
These guys made it. And do try their lamb cutlet.

I had went there to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday, coincidently on Friendship Day. We had to pay Rs.1500 (inclusive of cover charge) to gain entry. And ofcourse being Friendship Day it was completely packed. Even though it was a last minute booking, the manager provided us with a table within minutes.

Needless to say that the place is spectacular in terms of Ambience. The d√©cor and interiors are typical to that of any nightclub. Nothing very innovative. The club majorly has a seating area and a full bar, there is also a small dancing area right next to the spot where the Dj springs his beats.

The crowd was decent, mainly office goers, being located in a commercial hub.

Coming to the food, we had Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Au Gratin Nachos, Alfredo Pasta, Jalapeno Cheese Sticks and Pizza. All over the food was quite nice and ambrosial. The shisha was smooth and strong and a couple beers to go with it just cumulated to the feel.

I also had a Flaming Shooter (I guess it was day‚Äôs special) and it was simply the best thing for the evening. You can literally feel the fire go down your throat.

Slight improvement is required on the service part. The food was served pretty quick but the shooter took real long accompanied by couple of reminders to reach us.

Had heard about the 3rd November incident. Servers can keep the rudeness to themselves and on a serious note, guests today have no dearth of places to go and party. But considering it to be some exceptional issue I am not focusing on it.

Still on an Overall basis‚Ä¶A good place to party and Enjoy if one is looking for a classy Lounge in Salt Lake region.

The place is well decorated and spacious. They have sitting arrangement in ground floor and 1st floor, a pub separately on top floor. We visited the place specifically for an offer - "But two get one free", which was applicable only on pub where the price is exactly double. So we had to return to the restaurant. In spite of good decor and interior the place has several drawbacks, The service is bit slow compared to crowd as it is not so crowded. The waiters are though courteous and cooperative. But the biggest drawback is that they don't serve any table compliment which disappoints customers a lot as it is the prime selling factor of a bar. We had few drinks and a dish of smoked chicken with celery, romaine and apple cream sauce. The quantity was quite less and chicken was simple boiled(the one given in ceaser salad) not even smoked or grilled, filled with mayo. There was no apple cream just garnished with few apple slices. It was like a caesar salad garnished with apple slice and cinnamon flavor.

I am posting this review with great regret. Actually I took my wife on my wedding anniversary at Back Stage on 04 Dec 15. I ordered Vat-69 and a cocktail for my wife with a platter of Tandoori. The drinks were served quickly, but we were kept waiting for more than 2 hour for the Tandoori platter, and finally we left the place without having the platter. This was a special day for me but they made it so memorable that I will never forget this for a long time. The manager was polite but the lack professional ability to¬†cater¬†the guest requirements. Anyway I don't about others but, I would never visit the place again and would not recommend anyone.

So much awaited Backstage visit this afternoon. First of all I just fell in love with the ambience and decoration. You don't get to see Vintage scooter and wine barrels everywhere. Best thing a person welcomes you with a smile. Coming to food we ordered a pitcher of budwiser and Nonveg kebabs platter and chilli parathas with paneer and kaali daal accompanied with raita green chatney and tamarind sweet chatney. Hands down food was awesome worth the money. But I would have given it a 5 however few things I didn't like. First, they don't give anything complimentary with drinks one plate of masala pine nuts costed 95/- that's way too much. They're charging so much a plate of slated pine nuts won't do any harm. Then we ordered the desert cheese cake with blue berry sauce. I tasted a lot of cheese cakes previously it was expected to be better but it didn't melt in mouth way too crumbly and it typically tasted of marie biscuits when you're charging around 500/- for one. And the last thing unacceptable they don't give finger bowl I mean who does that even dhabas have finger bowls. So please take the reviews seriously and improve your services paying around 4000/- for one lunch would be worth it once these things get taken care of.

The only issue is some visitors whose perception has changed due to some incident they have heard incorrectly.

I used to this food joint,but after joining zomato i ve visited for d 1st time n felt d difference. 1 thing for sure i agree wid d reviewers that new customers r unwelcome, service boys r pretty rude n harsh even if u talk to them very politely. M not telling anything about the bar cz they ve changed all old bartenders n i didn't like d new ones. Fish items are good than meat. I love cocktails, but here they probably ve forgotten d tastes of common cocktails. However, there r lots of good bars n restaurants in n around Saltlake, so no one ll care to visit bakstage if they continue to make d customers angry.

Have visited this place at least 5 times over the past 2-3 years. Used to be quite nice with good service and decent offers. Now, however, service has become horrible and prices have gone up. Twice, I had to point out errors on the bill due to which they had overcharged us.

I have now stopped going. That's because the thought going to Bakstage is also accompanied by a feeling that somehow, something (service/bill/food/music) will go wrong and the night will ultimately end on a bitter note. Not a pleasant feeling to have when the idea is to go out and enjoy.

So people who I hang out with know my incessant love for this place. At occasions, I had to come up with justifications about backstage not paying me to promote it! The ambience is what had made me fall for the place at the first sight and then rest was history! However, in the back of my mind I ALWAYS knew that I am being overcharged. Somehow, the time spent there always seemed worth it and so I never looked into the bill details to see where the manipulations are being done. It was always about having a good time, simple!

But then, on reading about the horrible incident , I completely lose faith in the whole system. How can the waiters beat up the customers? I want to believe that I am looking at only one side of the coin, but I guess there are enough reasons to accept that Bakstage is one of the worst places we have and is a complete "no visit" for me or any of my friends! With lesser options in Salt lake, it makes me sadder to lose out on such a place but it's a sincere request to the management to change their ways!

Went to Backstage on Shaptami night with some friends. Located in Salt lake, it wasn't very difficult to locate the place. I was completely amazed to see the pub. It was absolutely brilliant. Everything about this pub gives you a great feeling. The decorations were very nice with huge LED screens playing good music. To keep up with the Durga Puja feeling, dhakis were there playing dhaaks. Now coming to the main thing. We didn't order any food items as our main intention was to drink. We order Miller's beer. We were around 10 people and each of us had 2 beers. It is a little pricey as each of us had to pay around 400 with tax. But given that wonderful place and ambience, I wont complain much.

When it opened, it was a good place to chill. A bit overpriced but the ambience is good. Among the food, I've liked the beer battered fish fingers, lamb cutlet with mint mayo and the meeze platter of kebabs. With a variety of wines and cocktails and good music, its a nice place to relax after a hard day at work.

It was one of my favorite places to Hang out with my friends and to take visitors and colleagues from Gurgaon and Bangalore. Food has always been good and great atmosphere. Off late I have seen the decline with horrible cocktails served and also getting mixed up. Servers are rude and only care about the regulars and new visitors are made to feel unwelcome. Quality of food is going down too.

To be honest.. I used to be quite a regular at their place and enjoyed their naanzas,exquisite offers on drinks and also the music and warm and cozy ambience... I always knew that these guys are overcharging us in the name of(service tax on service charge)..but I chose to ignore it as I thought it would not be possible for them to sustain with such a huge setup otherwise.. I was once even denied a proper bill for a green tea which I had ordered after my course of meal and drinks..however on complaining to the manager(the smart guy with black-rim specs),he got it sorted and presented me the bill..the recent incident is quite shocking and you really can't retort to lawlessness and hooliganism in the hospitality industry..this entire episode makes it impossible for me to trust one of my favourite places in Kolkata once again although its just a stone's throw from my office...

The interiors are superb, the ice base hookah's are good, was not too fond of the music earlier but of late they have improved significantly, the food is delicious (even the presentation is worth complimenting) !

So Zomato is deleting reviews now! So beating customers up is okay for a restaurant but protesting against it is not apparently. Good job Zomato and Bakstage.

As for the review, the prices are on the higher side. They charge -

14.5% VAT on total bill.
10% Service Charge on total bill.
5.6% Service Tax on total bill.
5.6% Service Tax on service charge.

Roughly about 31% extra. That for me is reason enough to give a 1.

A place with decent ambience, pathetic food, more pathetic service, serving time is too much, food is overpriced which is not at all as per the taste or quantity of food they serve. Firstly overpriced food, then vat, service tax, service charge and service tax on service charge also. They don't keep any effort less to drag all money u have and if u question, beware to get beaten up. Always carry ur private security while visiting (if you dare to).
Hoping to see Zomato delete this comment also like my previous one. Strange to see from 2.9 rating increased to 3.4 suddenly. This is how money talks.

I sincerely hope you all are realizing what the act of removing posts is doing to your reputation. You all may continue to chant and rant about the so called ‚ÄúNeutrality‚Äù factor and make us believe that this response is the ‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù at Zomato and no external factor is influencing your actions.

Let me be clear, by external factor I mean being paid off by the management of the ‚Äúvictimised‚Äù restaurant.

However, if you still try to convince us that the reason is solely a standard policy, please explain why the Comments on ‚ÄúGinger‚Äù Restaurant are still posted when they too have been raised to protest the act of discrimination.

And now I know, you have no answers.

Shame on you Zomato.

Now my review. I visited the place just so that I could post a review. The place dosent look too bad, staff seemed cordial. However, with the recent incidents fresh in memory, i could not dare to order food as i forgot to bring my personal security guards with me.

Is there any negative rating available? If so. My rating would be minus five star!!!! Reason??? Pathetic place, pathetic overpriced foods, staffs with bad behavior. Myself and 3 of my team mates went to this restaurant in the month of August with 2 of our clients came from overseas. After spending some time, we felt guilty that it was a terrible bad idea to take them here in BackStage Sec V. That was their first visit in India as well as in Kolkata!!!! What a terrible mistake we made!!!

I know what hospitality means if you visit good restaurants. I've spent 1 year in Canada and 2 years at UK and I had many opportunities to have some of the finest dining experience in the world-famous restaurants. But, after coming here I was in great shock to see such unprofessional behaviors and no value for money.

I recommend not to visit this place if you don't want to get disappointed.

SO I am gonna write this one more time. after reading all the "rules" of the neutral platform that is Zomato ( Hi! Ginger Restaurant - please talk to Zomato to fix all the damage they did to you - dont forget to ask for your compensation for them not being neutral to you!)
I have visited bakstage in the past couple of times - usually becuase of lack of options in that area, the food is so - so and alcohol is alcohol. Ambiance is pretty decent - the outside area is nice during winters - but stay away for that area in the night - in case a fight breaks out and you are pushed off the roof.
The music is really really sad. Its one of those places edm lovers and metal heads come together to weep at the choice of music here.
One tip- if you do go here - dont even think of customer rights, You will get beaten up if you even try to ask a clarification question. And then when you will try to come one Zomato to talk about your experience - Zomato will bring those reviews down. I wonder why? No points for guessing the right answer :)

Reviews are being pulled down coz we are rating the service offered by this joint in all honesty. Nonetheless, I had visited this place once some months back, nothing to write home about, the general facade of food & drinks, nothing special, don't remember precisely we had taken some meat dish it was thick and as hard it was tasteless. I generally don't go around rating restaurant unless I really find them great but for backstage I can make an exception. Staff courtesy leave a lot to be desired. You will better smile at the road side dhaba on NH something which aren't even featured in Zomato. Also I WAS LUCKY THAT THE STAFF DIDN'T ASSAULT ME COZ WE DIDN'T POINT OUT TAXES ON TAX AND SHADY PRICING AND RUDE STAFF BEHAVIOR BUT YOU MAY NOT BE THAT LUCKY. Disclaimer: my last review was pulled down coz I supported an incident, this is my experience here, below average food and drinks nothing special, shady pricing but doesn't matter on less valued bills under 2k INR and staff behavior is far opposite of courteous. In service the little things matter, the reason I shell out 5k over meals at Spaghetti Kitchen or Oh Calcutta is service more than the food, not all dishes are done right. If that makes sense to you avoid this place and ask your like minded friends for the same.

This had always been a weird place right from the beginning.
Staffs are as rude as they can get (and you get rudeness right from the lift man standing at the groundfloor).¬†
Charges are HIGH, music is BAD, food isnt worth the price, Cocktails are BAD.

It is one of the worst places I've ever visited.

This is my second review since the first one was pulled down. I agree I shall discuss just about the service for this particular review. The reason being bizarre behaviour of staff members, terrible billing errors and violent behaviour. 
If I go to any food joint serving alcoholic drinks I would like it to be a safe place with cooperative servers and I would expect the whole experience to be a pleasing one. 
This is anything but safe. People have been beaten up with liquor bottles brutally. They have been wrongly billed and charged for way more than they had consumed. All of this taking place at peak hours. Hence I would like to suggest anybody who decides to go there to be careful and if you have the option do visit another place.

Located in sector 5 , bakstage is a well known pub with some exceptional history. I was pretty unsure about the place as well as amused before visiting considering it tends to get a rating of either 1.0 or a 5.0 from any reviewer.

Anyways, one should not judge a book by its cover. There is also a saying that risk and reward go hand in hand. Thus I strongly suggest that one should take that risk of physical assault suggested by reviewers with rating 1.0 and it could work really well for you just like the ones with rating 5.0.

Coming to staff service , the staff are really rational. I appreciate the service charge of 10 % being added to the bill to incentivise the employees to make a prompt recovery plus it saves me time and effort on thinking about what to tip.

Coming to food, the menu is pretty elaborate. There are LOTS OF THINGS YOU COULD GET INSIDE but use of a helmet while eating helps in having a better dining experience. I strongly suggest one to avoid beer in all forms here. Otherwise the eatables are all pretty decent to taste.

I would suggest one to definitely try this place because otherwise your review might get removed from the web!! There are reviews that suggest that this place is run by people who rough up their customers even after billing them wrongly which I think is not possible since I came out safe from this restaurant and the management should release the respective cctv footage immediately so that no one can propagate lies even if it's the victim himself !!

It is not just making a fancy place like this it's how treat u customers and give them service . Very disappointed. Will think thirce before going to this place again.

For me its always better to dine where you are treated well even if the food is not great, than a place where the food is good but the staffs are aggressive, full of attitude and stubborn. This completely pisses me off and is the reason why I stopped going there after a couple of times. The recent incident brought back those unpleasant memories.

Have been hearing about this joint for quite some time and decided to drop in with friends this weekend. It really turned out to be pathetic. Overtly overpriced for the quality of the starters, poor food, and to top it up, the behaviour from the guys managing the place was horrible. Bad decision to drop in.

Being in the hospitality industry,you should have known that we visited your place to have a GOOD experience.We went there to ENJOY....!!! But in return we had the WORST experience that ¬†possibly anyone can give in this industry....!! Did you recruit your staff while you were not WELL and did not get better since then?(otherwise you would have sacked them earlier).Do not worry,we will make you get better.Do not even dare to think that we are gonna let the things get sorted easily ANYMORE..!! We want you to get rid of those two asap.(this will be the first thing you MUST do....!!)

None of us are going back to that SHITTY place where people get beaten and has to pay what the restro demands out of fear of getiing killed by people you have kept as staff.And seeing the reviews I believe we are getting Stronger.SO BAKSTAGE......SCREW YOU.... !!!!

Wish I could give it a 0 ! But unfortunately Zomato is a bit kinder to restaurants than that. Pathetic place, worse managers, even worse waiters. That place needs a renovation of staff. No matter what anyone says, you always call the cops, not beat ur patrons senseless with punches and bottles. We wanted to sit and discuss it, while they only wanted to go home. And obviously who could resist taking out frustration on their customers for the shitty life they have. Right ?
We want #justice ! We want those managers #sacked ! This is a service industry, customers come first. If they have an issue .. Sort it! Why were you guys so unwilling to call the cops to sort it out when we suggested to do that. If anyone goes there and has an issue with the bill please do call the cops before discussing it with them or just pay up and leave, that's only if you find your life precious. Cause those managers don't give two shits about the customers life. 
If those two managers are so important to backstage than their loyal customers then keep them, the customers will go and then you can assess the situation when that place won't exist.

All the reviews must have clearly said why I am reactiing this way! I have been here 4 times and except once all the experience were fine. The reason now I understand was coz we never questioned the BiLL
The only unpleasant experience was when we asked the reason for 4k tax in the bill. In order ti avoid further issues we paid and left thinking let it go. Guess we let it go that night so we are alive today! Else they would have treated us same way with steel bracelets and beeer bottles.
U guys are doomed!

Unbelievably poor behavior by Bakstage staff. People please stay away from this place. 

Me and my friends were wrongly charged in the bill, and when they tried to discuss the issue with the Bakstage managers, they hit my friends with steel kadas and broke bottles on their head, all because they "wanted to go home" and not discuss the bill issue.

WORST PLACE EVER !!

Backstage Sector V For all those who know me, know that I'm not exactly a social media fanatic neither do I create a hue and cry about things unnecessarily. On 3rd November my team and I visited Backstage,Sec-5 Saltlake for an office get together. We were overcharged, forced to pay service charge (this is voluntary by law and is equivalent to a tip) , roughed up by waiters ( beaten by kada, beer bottles smashed on us). Even though we have started proceedings, we are pretty sure there will be a loophole /contacts that will be used to get off. Earnest request to the good folks of Facebook on my/our list is to share this so that everyone knows about the kind if organisation we promote. I know this may not be shared by all but to the ones who do. Thank you.

‚Ä™#‚ÄéBackstageBan‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ ‚Ä™#‚ÄéNoRespectForLaw‚Ä¨ ‚Ä™#‚ÄéCustomerIsNothing‚Ä¨ This is a post to share the shocking turn of events in Backstage on 3rd November. I along with 26 of my friends planned to host a private party in backstage. The event went well till the issue with the billing came up and we wanted to discuss it. We were working on it and discussing it with the managers there. We were not leaving until the matter was resolved. Most of the colleagues had left and we were left with 8 people in the end, including two girls. The bill amount came to about 50 grands and we had every right to not pay more than what they owed us. After a while the manager along with the waiters got frustrated with talking about it when they started using abusive language just because , ‚Äùthey wanted to go home‚Äù. It didn‚Äôt matter that the customer was paying more to them. So to resolve the issue we suggested to call the Police to the venue and resort this. They were not even ready to do that. They wanted to take matters into their own hands and just at that moment things got heated up and one of the managers said, ‚Äúinko dhakka maro yaha se.‚Äù We were peaceful throughout the entire discussion but then we also had to take a stand for what was right, because they were at fault. Just at that moment the other manager came towards me , abusing on the way and along with 5-6 other waiters started pelting me with punches and dragged me into the outer smoking section and kept on hitting and kicking me and two of the waiters had blocked the entrance so that none of my friends could come in. They broke a bottle on my head and hit me with a steel bracelet on his hand. While doing so they kept me hostage and commanded my friends to pay the bill. While on the inside one of my other friend was also getting hit by 4-5 other waiters that surrounded him. Fearing for my life, my friends immediately paid the bill to those uncouth animals. But even then they were not happy with that. They kept on abusing even after it was paid and then the same manager who beat me came out with a rod-like instrument to hit my friend with. The Restaurant is not run by waiters and managers who serve customers. No matter how it is no one is in the right place to raise hands to customers, or in fact anyone. Even if there is any issue the max a person can do legally is call the cops, which we as peaceful customers suggested to do. While they just didn‚Äôt want anyone else involved even. Im not making the mistake of stepping into that place ever in my life and neither should anyone else

It's a really great place to hangout once in a while. The interior looked amazing and the ambience that they created with those wonderful songs and the decorations, all added up to the delight this place is.. The food was good, the service was excellent. Will have to catch-up on that Sufi Wednesday sometime.

Considering how un-happy fellow foodies are on zomato, i bring down my rating. Bakstage, apologies wont be enough.

Earlier - "I loved the pub at first floor. Dj is nice.. Small dance floor though, but we don't have that many dancing crowd in this north part of city. Good to find a place in north kol, which is a nice pub, music, n dancing. Food tasted good too. They have this concept of BOGO on drinks, but drinks are already priced high for a single. Wine room downstairs is a quiet nice place too.. A go again for me"

Back Stage is a pub bang on Webel Bus Stop at Salt Lake Sector -5. Its a stones throw distance from my office. 
We were planning for an evening there since long however, it happened yesterday when three of our school friends visited the place to relive our old memories.

To start with, the ambience is just awesome. The lavish pub type interior ia spread on two floors. Music and ambience makes it a perfect place to hang out. 

Now coming to the F&B... We ordered 

1. Beer batter fish fry- This was the best of the lot. Tastes good..!

2. Beked Chicken Wings- It is the most shocking one of the lot. They definitely purchase old chicken from the market at cheaper rate. The food looks good but smells so much that you wont be able to take the next piece.

3. Mixed mutton jalepeno n onion pizza- Thin crust, adequate cheese and tastes okay.

4. Non veg mezze platter- Yet another tasteless eye candy. The meat n other non veg items were not fresh.

Hence, my rating goes this way-

1. Ambience-  5/5.
2. Food- 0/5
3. Service- 4/5.
4.Value for money- 0/5

Its a perfect nonsense well wrapped in in a decorative packet. Everything except the food is good here. Stale n smelly chicken@ could nt fetch more than ZERO in food category and automatically the Value for money dips to ZERO level.

Hence, AVOID... !!!@

I've been wanting to visit dis place ever since it started. Its this thursday dat my dream came true. Reunion with friends made it all d more special.
Bakstage is situated at Webel Mor, Sector V. It is one of d most happening pubs i've ever been to. Seldom we come across such a place in Kolkata. 1 wall of d ground floor was decorated with wine bottles & immediately caught our attraction. Dis floor was more if u r looking for some conversation. We, in a group, took to d 2nd floor & made ourselves comfortable right in front of d screen. Dey churn out some really good music throughout d day. The decor & ambience is something which i can only dream of. The place reminded me of d famous old London pubs.
Coming to d food, we ordered chicken wings for starters. 9 pieces dipped in 3 different types of sauces. Dey told us dat happy hours was going on so we ordered heineken & budweisers alongside it. Our non-alcoholic friends settled for a couple of mocktails. For mains, dey suggested country captain(paranthas, rajmah & chicken makhani gravy) & chilli garlic noodles wd kung pao chicken. Both of dem were absolutely delicious. With a little help, we ordered brownie with ice cream as dessert & i swear its d best brownie we ever had. The food presentation was elegant.
The prices of food cud have been toned down a bit, but having said so, no one could really complain. The waiters were very amicable & d service time was quick.
They have something or d other special for each day of week which makes dis pub a must go for all beer lovers. So, settle down with ur bottles & just enjoy.
Dis is one place i can never stop talking about. Well, certainly lots more visits to come.

I went to backstage during Durga Puja to avoid rush and crowd. Backstage was a good option for me as it is located in sector 5(just opposite webel) to keep myself far away from Pujo rush. It is having nice ambience and also good food. I liked all dishes but chicken Lasagna is must recommended for all :p

I instantly fell in love with this place! The decor, the colorful wine bottles, the mellifluous music and the food- everything come together to create a beautiful harmony. the music playing in the background (90s music to be precise; at least when I was visiting) stirs up enough nostalgia to drown me in happiness. 

The food was equally good. We had ordered beers, Roast chicken, beer battered fish and two variants of pizza and a drink which was a weird mix of the Indian chaas and a wannabe fusion mix (not to mention- hated it!!. Due to the Durga Puja celebrations- there was only a set menu; therefore, our options were limited. 

The pizzas were quite good. the fish so so, the chicken was quite good too. The beers were served chilled. Overall, the ambiance and the food just went hand in hand and helped offer one of the best food experiences for me, this Durga Puja. Dying to go back again for sure. Already in love with the laid back chic elegance of this place.

Kudos Backstage!

To foodies of Kolkata, this place is an insult! Even roadside cutlets and old fashioned restaurant Kobirajis are better. The Galauti kebab was somewhat better. Fish and Chips was just right to be gulped. Probably the food would taste bearable if gulped down with alcohol...few of the better dishes (pork and non veg sizzlers) were not available...and overall, the forced service charge was the nail to the coffin.

Updated review: You guys are sick!

--------------------------------------------------------------
Surprised I never reviewed this place! The best place for good music, great ambiance and so much energy! I am a frequent visitor and always enjoy this place!
The servers are extremely warm and have always been prompt with my orders!
I have tried their platters and they are good! Though they don't have pizza on their menu they will serve it and with love! ( brownie points )
We mostly go their for booze and music and pizza and I'm always singing and grooving when I'm there. They also open the dance floor ( though small its there) and cmon now isn't that the best thing?

A complete place to unwind and relax or party, whichever is your choice of the evening :)

Pocket pinch: you guys have heard about this right- good things have a price? Well that applies here!
I don't mind the spending because Bakstage is a complete crowd puller and I can only say " take my money" :D

Great going guys!

So there are two parts of this place, and we went to the non-club one coz we just needed a decent dinner. This place is a must go if you're in Sector-5 coz the ambience is classy, and service very good. From what I remember, we ordered pints of Carlsberg and keema burger (don't remember the exact name). The burger was just unbelievable with this different concept. Will definitely stop by here again.

Extremely ill mannered staff and manager. We bought a voucher from groupon where we took the offer of a Chef's special non veg. When we visited the restaurant we were said that our coupon was entitled only to a starter which was present in a small yellow menu card and nowhere it was mentioned that those starters were  Chefs Special dishes. We looked into another menu card where we immediately found Chefs Special platter non veg and when we claimed it, the management was not ready to listen to us. The menu was snatched from our hands and finally we had to take a prawn starter which was NOT what we bought the voucher for. We were charged Rs 500 for the voucher at Groupon and the starter we had was also 500 bucks as per menu card. Dont know what economic benefit we got out of the offer from Groupon. Food is not out of the world.  Backstage is overpriced with ill mannered staff and so I would never visit them again.

PS for all next time visitors I am uploading the dish we had for 500 bucks. 6 plain prawn chops which you might get cheaper at Oriental Plaza in esplanede.

It is actually a lounge, a club and a sports bar all rolled into one. You can chill out on the ground floor in case you are looking for some conversation. There is so much do here - a pool table, giant screens, dance floor. They play a different genre of music each day - my personal favourites are Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. 

What to Eat:
Chill chicken 
Pasta arrabiata 

Expert Tip:
Bollywood music lovers must hit the bar post 10 pm. They churn out some really groovy tracks!

I had heard about this place from my friends and so I gave it a try. It doesn't live up to the hype. The ambience is average and the prices are really high compared to the place.

Oh what a delightful place!!! great location for people not staying in the city. The place has a pleasant ambience. The guest coming here seems very respectable.
They had an in-house DJ when I last went and he plays some really groovy music which is sure to make you move.
They have good variety of poison to offer and they also serve hookas.
Its a nice place to hang out with friends and give your mind a break from the stressful life.

I don't really get to use words like "Brobdingnagian","beatitude",or even "gargantuan" while reviewing most restaurants.It's only a handful of places like the Bakstage pub,that really proves to be a reviewer's delight.After all,a foodie craves¬† food,but what he/she really wants is to be surprised,and in a pleasant way.Saltlake Webel more is the precise location of bakstage,and the pub is located on the first floor.the indoor is dim rubicund,with flourescents and neons glowing all over.We sat facing the LCD,catching a replay of ISL.The crowd doesn't pour in until 2.30 on a sunday afternoon,and the service was flawless and prompt.

We started with two corona beer with a paan-flavored hookah.They have a day-long happy hour offer on alcohol,it's 12pm-10pm or something like that.I usually dig deep with the hookah,and stop only if I feel like having an aneurysm.Then we ordered caesar salad,the chicken tikka platter and chocolate lasagna.I felt the caesar salad,with all its creamy chicken and croutons,was a bit tarnished by the overuse of black olives.However,the tikka platter filled us with a sense of great "beatitude".It was a very nice assortment of three types of kebabs,very fulsome and in every way,utterly delectable.They were served with the right dips,and savoring them elicited a sense of theophany.The chocolate lasagna is merely a giant chocolate truffle,and in posterity,we should have ordered something else for dessert.

The only downside to this place is the excessive tax,adding upto almost 30 percent.

foodie funfact#13-What do people eat in the space?Let's have a look at wikipedia.
For lunch on Vostok I (1961) Yuri Gagarin ate three 160 g toothpaste-type tubes, which contained two servings of pur√©ed meat and one of chocolate sauce.In August 1961, Soviet Cosmonaut Gherman Titov became the first human to experience space sickness on Vostok II; he holds the record for being the first person to vomit in space. According to Lane and Feeback, this event "heralded the need for space flight nutrition.Currently,n the ISS,the Russian crew has a selection of over 300 dishes. An example daily menu can be:

¬†¬†¬† Breakfast: curds and nuts, mashed potatoes with nuts, apple-quince chip sticks, sugarless coffee and vitamins.
¬†¬†¬† Lunch: jellied pike perch, borsch with meat, goulash with buckwheat, bread, black currant juice, sugarless tea.
¬†¬†¬† Supper: rice and meat, broccoli and cheese, nuts, tea with sugar.
¬†¬†¬† Second supper: dried beef, cashew nuts, peaches, grape juice

We had an extremely high hope and expectation from this restaurant when we chose to dine out here on 2nd Oct evening. But we were utterly disappointed with our experince here.First of all, food quality was not good at all. We ordered Roast Chicken Salad with grapes, Cone full of Spicy Chicken popcorn, Chicken dum biriyani, Half Roast Chicken with roast gravy. Chicken in the main dish was stale, same for chicken in biriyani also. mashed potato was also stale.Secondly, servings were not done appropriately. And roasted Chickenn was given with spoon and fork. No proper serving spoons were also given initially. For everything we had to call the waiter and ask for specific thing to be done.Further, prices for certain things were beyond expectations. While prices for food are still OK, we were actually surprised seeing the price taken for a simple drink. We asked for a drink on soda based, the waiter served up a soda based drink with mint flavour in green color. Prices taken as Rs. 600 for 2 qty, which is too sharp a price for such a basic drink.Service charge was taken @ 10% while the service was not up to the mark at all.Overall, we are quite disappointed with the overall quality and service here in Backstage and would not prefer to get in here further.I am not sure if management collects feedback from customer, take a due note on the same and take appropriate action to resolve the issues.

Bakstage no doubt is good for the food and ambience. But the attitude of the staffs and manager was disgusting today. We played pool and the pool cue broke for which we were charged ‚Çπ2100. We asked to call the manager but he didn't appear for the next 20-25 minutes. We paid the charge and asked for the broken cue to which the arrogant staff responded that for that the charge is ‚Çπ2500 (the reason for the premium of ‚Çπ400 best known to them). The manager made a late entry and behaved arogantly as if he is doing a favour on us. There was also another staff with the badge of star performer who was very calm and well behaved and he kind of cooled the matter. There is one pool table which is so damn congested to play freely. It's a big no no to play pool as such. Such kind of response from a place like bakstage team was never expected.

We went to Backstage on a Wednesday evening and were really amazed by the ambiance. We took a table on the first floor (the pub). The staff were very busy catering to people on other tables and did not listen to us when we called them. We ordered a couple of starters and drinks which we got in half an hour. And then when called the waiters they didn't seem to care. We had to finally ask for the cheque and leave (they did not even apologise for their horrible service or try to stop us from leaving, even once). The 1.0 is for the ambiance. The food is okay, nothing special. The place is overcrowded and the staff is cold. Poor behaviour and no hospitality makes this place a no-no!

We went for our team party and the experience is not pleasant at all. The ambiance is good but the service is pathetic. The portion of food is also very less. Food didn't taste great to us. We took Beer batter fish finger and Tender Chicken. Both taste almost same except the material! We ordered one item and that took 30 min to arrive and we discovered it's not that we order. We have to wait another 15 min to find a waiter to report it. Finally we moved out from the place to find another pub to complete our party. Over hyped as it has no competition in Sector V or Saltlake.

I went to backstage with my cousins on 27th September, Sunday at around 8 PM. The place was relatively empty and we grabbed a table near the entrance. After around 15 minutes a group of 3 men grabbed the table next to ours and were continuously staring at our table and talking loudly. We felt that a few words were aimed at our table but did not pay heed. When my sister went up to go use the loo they passed some pretty lewd comments at her. We immediately took up the matter to the manager, Mac. What really bothered us was the response which we got from the management. Instead of taking strong steps to ensure female guests are not misbehaved with, the management simply asked them to shift to the adjacent table. On our repeated request to make that party leave so that a strong example is set and they don't commit such nuisance next time, we ended up being at the end of rebuttal from the management. They were clearly regulars at the place who ensure fat bills for the establishment and hence they were being provided the privilege of eve teasing other guests. I would not recommend this venue to anyone who wishes to spend quality time in a tension free, safe environment.

Except for the rather unpleasant entry through the staircase of a sector 5 building, everything about this place is nice. Cool decor, no loud music, decent floor for the moody steppers. Hookah is good, a bit expensive but can't complain as the place rent is high. Tenders are GOOD! Just the lighting can be made better.

We were looking for to grab a few beers around 4pm. Decided to head to bakstage. There were some special deals on drinks and it was just the answer to our prayers. 6 Budweisers for 699! Along with it we ordered a bacon caesar salad, Grilled chicken sandwich and chicken and cheese kebab. The caesar salad was the best. It was so light and yet so tasty. The service was really good. I am in love with this place and would visit it again.

Last day I encountered a wonderful experience when I was called to Zomato office in Kolkata as a part of their user interaction initiative. Met the lovely energetic young Zomato team who made me feel so comfortable, it was like having a hangout with my old friends. 
After a warm welcome, we talked for hours about Zomato, food and shared a bit of each other's experience with food. 
I was asked what I would like to have. After a hot cup of coffee and popcorn I was offered the jumbo chicken burger of Bakstage. 
The burger was coupled with fresh green salad with mayo seasoning, French fried. 
The burger itself weighed nearly 600 to 700 gram if I guess is right. It consisted 5 layers 2 huge juicy patty and 3 burger bun. The mayo sauce was tasty. Overall it was one of the best burger I had till now. 
A must try, the burger was very filling , very appetizing, very tasty. 
Would like to visit the Restaurant next time to get a whole some experience. 
Here I must thank Zomato for inviting me. My love for the company and its people increased manifold because of their caring nature. 
I love you Zomato and I loved the yammy burger from burger.

Dropped in here on my friend's birthday. The pub is very well decorated with various sitting arrangements, collection of guitars hanging on the wall, a pool table. There is a smoking area where the liquor containers are the astray. The music was good & the ambience was decent and cool. Steal the deal offers are good to go with. We had ordered Budweiser, Miller, Kingfisher Ultra Beers in drink & chilly chicken, chilly baby corn, nachos non veg & veg in food. The beers were chilled. The chilly chicken & baby corn was hot & crispy. The Au Gratin Nachos Wachos were crunchy, cheesy & the Tomato Salsa and Yogurt dips added a scrumptious flavour to it.
I would like to visit Bakstage again !!

The place s really nice...
Environment is pretty awesome..
Good ambience...n awesome muzik and services as well.
Well wondering why I am rating 2.5?
Because it deductes huge amount of taxs..for example if u make a bill of 2000 bucks they add 1500 bucks taxs..
And i have never seen this in any pub...
Weird kinda taxes they add in bills which you can check it self in the bills..
But i never saw those taxes are deducted by any other bar or a pub...
Well one more imp thing...
I have seen few service ppl acting weird.
Taking cards of new ppl visiting there and not giving any explanation of why they are taking..and the moment you ask...they reply as "sir just to secure your seat"
Boss? Why they hell you need my debit or credit card to secure mah place..!

Good lounge bar in Sector 5. Been here few times and food has been a mixed experience. None of the finger food could impress me. ordered Classic Chilli chicken, chicken and cheese kebab, onion rings and tender chicken. Classic Chilli chicken, well it could not even live up to its classic taste. Drinks promptly served but to setup a table created fuss coz we entered as stags but said female friends would join a bit late. Most lounge bars would offer atleast cheeselings complimentary none here. They why a good rating! DJ and his playlist the highlight of my experience.

Hookahs are amazing, food is good and theres always some offer or the other going on drinks so its very much pocket friendly !! The first floor gets too loud on Saturdays or Sundays, but you can't complain if they are having a full house every weekend ! If you want to chit chat with ur friends sit on the ground floor, and if u want to party u will definitely have a good time upstairs !

Would see offers 365 days a year for the people to come in and have fun. Crowd coming to this place is comparatively better than the others in the area. The staff is really very polite and helpful. In short a nice place to spend in the evening with friends and party. Enjoy on the longest bar table, and just follow the beats. And yes the best part...  The wall with those hanging GUITARS.

Pls try to improve. In fact i was charged 3k for cover one sat night by the so called manager over there, saying he din want it to be crowded. Butt when we went to the 1st floor pub it was really desserted. Hence no logic. Pls overcome these problems and i wud giv a ratinf no less than 5 :-)

The experience was not as good as expected. The food took way too long to be served. The wait killed the appetite. We were feeling very hot n even after requesting twice for AC, there was no change.

Last Friday was my first time to a legit pub, and I enjoyed the experience. The food was great no doubt. Be it the Beer Batter Fish Finger or the Classic Chili Chicken - not only the taste, but the portions were also quite large too. The Backstage Hustle Burger, with its double patty, is good enough to satiate any hungry tummy. Loved the Happy Hour offer on the beer. The music was totally in tune with the ambiance. Would love to come back soon, and get my hands dirty on the pool table.

Would've love it even more if the staff members would've been a little more courteous. It wasn't even that crowded for the management to have a hard time. And just a word of advice, keep the drought beer available... it was a major disappointment to stick to regular beers on that night.

Bakstage is the best lounge I have come across in Salt Lake till now. Standing tall as a landmark at Webel More, its located quite near my college and gives me the much required break at times. Its a classy place and not an out n out student hookah joint. So if you  are a stickler for ambience like me, I'd strongly recommend this place. Food is satisfactory and hookah is superb. Grab a book from the shelf and laze away on the sofa or drop in with your gang of friends for a chit chat session.You are surely going to have a good time. However a bigger and better washroom is a thing this place deserves yet lacks. Otherwise way to go! :)

Greeeaaattt Greaaatt ambience! Amazinggg fooood. Although we went on the Independence Day so no alcohol :( But the bar menu was extensive and I would definitely want to go back for drinks! Its a complete party place and super chilled out. The service was slow though. The hookah was amazing as well. Other than that the staff is courteous and I would recommend everyone to go here if u really wanna have a great time with friends! :D

A little far from the main city¬†but totally worth it.¬† One of the¬†best in Kolkata. Food , drinks , sheesha , ambience¬†, music -¬†not many places in Kolkata have a balanced combination of all of these. Perfect place to party with friends. Has a pool table(chargeable) ,¬†Large screen¬†, dance floor.¬†Its quite complete¬†in itself and is well equipped¬†to entertain its guests.¬† You will have a blast here !!!

A pub in the midst of busy sector five. It's open till 1-2am on Saturday nights but they close down by midnight other days.. Ambience is good and music is good. If crowd is less you can dance on their floor. Birthday parties can be arranged by ordering inhouse cake which costs around a 1000 rupees. The only negative point is it is very costly and have high tax rates. So it's a big pinch to the pocket.

Went here on 6th Aug, Thursday.
It was supposed to be a play your own music day but still they give a lost of old 100 songs to chhode from and you u cant actually play what u wish. Therefore music bad.
Food: Good . Everything that we ate was good but the service wasn't.
Ambience very much overhyped. Average place.

I visited this place on Friendship day after having pizza downstairs at Bakstage The Wine Room.!
The quality of service downstairs was very good, and the food was also very good.!

Here the service was very poor. Tables were empty but there was nobody to clean the tables or serve us.!
By the time I had my pizza downstairs and came up in here, their offer for the happy hours had changed dramatically, half the things were kept out of offer suddenly.
After much struggle, when finally someone came to take our order, they misled us with waste stuff to order which again is bad service.!
After experiencing such poor service, I'm not visiting the particular 1st floor outlet.!

Even their valet parking attendants, if not tipped, will talk roughly, which the management should look into.!

Latest review after Bakstage's debacle on 3rd Nov: Beating up customers on Billing related issue, extremely disgusting & shameful act from your Management.

My previous review: Gave 3 Stars
Went on Friendship Day, it was full house then. They gave us a deal of Rs.10,000/- for 9 persons but provided the table only for 6. The service was friendly but slow. The food was good. Had heard good stuff about the place but its little over-rated.

Pleasantly surprised to see a place such as this exists north of The Park in the city. Decent food and drinks, loud music, hookah, attentive service and a hip decor. They played everything from Jim Morrison to Madonna to some bollywood remix that went "Saturday Saturday" !!! Nevertheless,  worth a visit if you are not going to The Park.

I haave visited this place a dozen times before today, it was thru Groupon coupon that I visited and the true colors of the management was there. It was around 130 pm that I got in,  totally empty it was, expected that. I was calling them for 2 days staright to get the reservation done, no one picked!  I showed the coupon today, 6.08.2015 with validity upto 09.08.2015.  The waiter said that the deal is not valid now we have ended up the engagement with Groupon. Upon asking to call the manager he just left and never came back. I called Groupon and made the manager talk (manager was soo worthless that he could not even face to come up and talk abt the matter). He further stated that manager said he dint get any reservation in advance so he cannot provide the service, even aftr talking on my phone to the Groupon executive he asked some other person to get me my phone instead of himself. Ultimately I left, unfortunate for these places loosing customers.  management seems too reluctant of the facts. I dont think this place will improve its behaviour.

This place has grown from time to time. The offer which runs is amazing. Buy 1 Get 1 free ... Normally you dont find these kind of offers on a Friday or weekends.¬†

The music played by Sunny is amazing. Make you pull yourself on the dance floor. Though the dance floor is very small still its you enjoy every bit of dancing there.¬†

The food too was excellent. We ordered nachos, garlic bread, american corn and chicken tenders all ¬†were lip-smackingly delicious.

I have visited this place at Sector 5 only once during one of my project party. The whole banquet hall was booked and the interior decoration was really very nice. The place was big enough to accommodate around 100+ people easily. Like other office parties, here also we had customized menu including unlimited chicken, fish and prawn starters - definitely all of them were very opulent. This was followed by pouring drinks and then there scintillating lights, smokes, grooving bollywood and trance music ¬†- enough to give you a solid thud to get into high.. slowly...
Finally we started the dinner and they served more or less a regular non veg buffet dinner including assorted breads, biriyani, chicken, fish and mutton gravy items, sweets and ice cream parlour. Though I was not in a situation to give my "expert comments", nevertheless it was nice. Overall it was a nice experience, I am not very sure of the items price if taken as Ala carte but have heard that it's bit costly, even the drinks as well. Definitely for a change on your salary day, a place worth dropping in!!

First things first. It exorbitantly expensive. But food quality is very good and killer ambience. Drinks are expensive but you do get offers. Starters are excellent though small in quantity. Same about the main course platters. If you like loud music, great ambience and good food then this is the most happening place in Sector 5. Just that it will make a hole in your wallet. Also forgot to mention the Hukkas.. They go really well with the ambience.

The ambience s ok. There is a cover charge to enter the pub. We had ordered mojito. And the bar tender did not know how to prepare so was using mojito syrup. Before that I asked for margarita they said they will serve in a whisky glass so obviously we did not order that. Vegetarian mezze platter and chilly baby corn which was good. 
But please remember to keep the cover charge coupon in your pocket as we kept on our table and it vanished. When we spoke the people in entry that we had paid and you must have written our name ; they insisted they will not show us their list as well as said our name was not there. Then how did you stamp our wrist; and to that they did not have answer. The gentle manager was trying to check the list and he was also not allowed. Instead his colleagues started shouting on us and pushed one of where we lost our temper and did check the list forcefully and our name was there. 
My whole point is where did the coupon go. Vanished from our table. No for sure did not fall. Another customer came to  refund. ( as told by them) or was it one of the waiter who  slipped . Yes that is what happened. took to

Started going to the place when hardly people used to go... liked the pizza...hookah..ambience...decor...courteous staff...
Felt rly bad with sudden change in the approach of the staff when it was found that entry to the pub was always denied with excuse stating private parties... sorry we understand this...
Stl trying to figure out how u chose n let ur visitors go to which part of the place..
Sad that due to such behaviour of new managers v have to move back to old places like afraa for our wkly visit üòê

Rating is down for ur new managers entry strategy...else my rating for this place has always been 4.5 given the fact that I have not only taken my friends in this place bt have also referred so many that I have been thanked for discovering the place... used to be an ideal after office place.

Another sad part is that y 10% service charge... believe it's on ur customers to decide if they r actly getting the worth of service... 

Instead of following the footsteps of many places like this..If u can distinguish urself..
It's jst like we speak of our state govt to reduce their tax on fuel these days... be different n leave it on your patrons..ur staffs good service will obviously be acknowledged.. atleast reduce it...it pinches a lot when the bill is of a good amount...

Pub grub after long! The caf√© section at Bakstage has a really pleasant and easy going vibe. On a weekday night, it was fairly empty but the ambience was quirky and interesting. The chef recommended crumbed corn and cheese was so sinfully good that we repeated a portion. It was nothing novel but good old cheese fritters done well. What s missing from the Zomato menu is the barbecue veg pizza which was slathered with delicious, sticky barbecue sauce. The pizza itself was crunchy and being a pizza lover, I enjoyed this new take on it. For a pub/caf√©, this place is surprisingly affordable at approx. Rs.400 per head (beer included).

Writing the feedback as I sit in the lounge. Decor - Super, Music - that 70s stuff, Drinks - Great but what I'd really emphasize on is the ridiculous quantity. Just does not compliment the pricing. I understand its all about fine grubbing or micro eating but not for the price you offer. Ordered a plate of fish fingers @275 for six pieces wrapped in a newspaper! Cool thought but very miserly portions. Would request the F&B team to really sit up and take stock of the concern. Rest all good

The lounge based theme on the ground floor and the quasi-HRC decor on the 1st, all of it adds up to make this place perfect for a long lazy saturday binge.
The newly imposed cover charge of 1500 per stag entry is excessive though. After all people in the IT industry might look and act rich, but trust me we're not :(

Second visit
The manner in which some of my friends and colleagues have been handled reminded me of apartheid. .so u know what management guys, screw you.
We still come from Calcutta..The land of values and culture..first learn to behave with respect then all the other things..Being human is not something which can be bought with money ..

First visit
If u want pub experience then this is it and in comparison cheaper than the other stalwarts. .but for the normal person it's a bane..The total tax incurred is just below 40%..that will pinch you for weeks to come

Apart from that the drinks the food is very good..try the salads and platter...The music is of the olden days and sets u in a very happy mood..on Fridays they open the dance floor...There are 3 projected TV showing some good show..of late they started serving hookah..

Be aware if u party hard with a head count of 5 then u might be looking at 18k plus

Decor is superb with so much spaces at the heart of Sector - 5! Music is loud- yes its pretty loud!
Drink prices are on the little higher side, so to compensate they have almost all the time Happy Hours!
Had a few beers and a chicken salad. Then ordered for Chicken Tenders - soft and juicy!
Thumbs up for this place! Will visit soon to explore more!

Alright the IT guys finally got the reason to log off early in Fridays.. Man I swear this is where the happy weekend starts..The longest bar..Yes it is. And my word its gorgeous. Music is mostly Indi-pop or classic bollywood dance numbers played by the in house DJ. Dance floor jam packed and the best part is that the bar tools are mostly empty..
Right that pretty much sums up the ambience. Asked for my fav hookah, the bar tender took care of my JW Black label pauva (180ml @ 1399). Aaaaand it all went down straight like that that that that....hahahaha
Lets move to the 'SHIT' part:
1. Wtf is wrong with your food? Damn terrible they're.. Doesn't worth the price they charge
2. Mind the taxes people. I mean 37%??? No joking..37% it is..37% Woooooow!!!!
Its worth visiting this place once or twice. I Frequent it..but thats me..not far from my office and they let you party until midnight..so thats awesome! Thank you for reading this my friend.. Party hard and dont drink n drive..Cheers !!!

Located in the heart of Sector 5 and popular with the office goers in the area. This place is a must visit for all Beer lovers. Multiple variants of pitchers available. Happy hours run till 10 PM. The music was bad to start off with - they just kept playing Backstreet Boys. Not sure if this has something to do with the name of the place as well. But then with Bryan Adams, Pink Floyd and the others taking over the music, it felt awesome. The IPL fever is currently on and you can watch the match in a big screen. Starters are good but it is better to try the nearby restaurants as far as the main course is concerned. Smokers will love this place as they have a break out area where you can carry your drink as well. Definitely worth a visit!

I went to Bakstage on a Saturday night with a couple of friends of mine. After visiting this place I feel I do not have the audacity to write a review for this place. Everything from the food to the music to the mocktails to the sheesha was at its place,  Simply awesome. The one part which let me down was the management not providing a table to a group of stags like us and giving us a bar top which to some extent is uncomfortable even though there were a decent number of tables empty. But it does not let me decrease my review score.  A big shoutout to the DJ for making it an awesome night with his mixes.

The service quality had detoriated drastically.. 
Aggrogant owner/manager.. They don't allow men in flip flops/sandals (floaters) on saturdays "if you are not paying cover charges". However if you pay cover charges they can make an exception. I think if someone pays double the cover charges they can be allowed in shorts (or swimming costume) as well.

We stumbled on this pub when looking for another. Located on mainroad.
The pizzas are thin crusted and taste very good. Try the version with nan base. 
We ordered two pizzas and three litres of draught beer. The beer is served in a tower. 
Prices are very reasonable. I wish there are such restaurants in Pune too.
Overall a very good experience.

I have been to Bakstage a couple of times before today but only for dancing and chilling out with friends. The food and ambience has always been good. Today I went there for a dinner treat by a friend. We were seated in the dining area which is quite comfortable. 
We ordered a Chef's special vegetarian platter for starters. It was delicious. The planner tikka, crispy chilly baby corn, the corn stuffed pakoda and crispy potato were all in the platter. We ordered a grilled chicken lasagna for main course which was enough for 3 of us as the platter was quite fulfilling. For dessert we ordered the Creme Brulle.
From the presentation to the taste, every item was splendid. The music and ambience complemented each other very well. The prices are fair too. The bill was around 2k inclusive of taxes for 3 people. 
Except for the service which was a little slow and sloppy (maybe cause it was Friday and they had their hands full) I will give a big thumbs up to Bakstage. I had an excellent dinner with a different taste after a long time.

Good restaurant but can be more better. Food was good but service needs to improve more. Can be recommended for continental foods. Overall good but can be more better.

Been here before but it was a Saturday nite nd there was a cover charge of 1500 per person... The items on the menu were pretty expensive and the taxes pretty high... We paid around 2500 taxes on a bill of 8000.... The ambiance is good with good music... But the food was sort of bland..Hookah was amazing... All in all a good place .. A must go... Please look on the food nd get the price on the menu lowered... U will GT more folks then... Cheers

After a lot of browsing on zomato, I settled for bakstage for a nice evening with friends... My mind was set on the BLT about which I had read in a review... and it did not disappoint... the crisp bacon with cheese , lettuce and tomato...  I would liked the bacon slices to be thinner but good none the less... We availed one of the steal the deal and ordered a "pauva" of captain morgan... which went well with the chicken tenders we had placed... I must say I like the salad and dressing they served with thier dishes... and to end it we had a huge bowl of nachos... strictly ok. Overall I liked the ambience... the fooseball table ... the outside balcony and a small dance floor to shake a leg... Minus marks for the poor service ... the place was understaffed. Also, I must mention... I cant place my finger on which of the dishes were not upto the mark or whether the meat was stale... because its been 2 days and my tummy is upset!

This was my second visit to Backstage. First time, we went to the Wine Club and this time to the retro pub. I would say that we had lovely experience in both the places. The ambience of retro pub was very good. It was crowded but managed to get a seat for 2. I would like to mention that the manager was ¬†very helpful. I hope the waiters would have also been same. To place the orders, waiter wasn't even responding but all my rating is for floor manager who took our orders every time and even suggested the specialities. The drink was good. But, the menu has dearth of white wines which my girl prefers. There were only couple of white wines available though the menu card mentions 7 or 8 of them. So, we settled with martini and beers. I would like to see more variety of wines. I would even mention that interestingly the wine club also didn't offered us much during the first visit. We ordered couple of them and none of them was present. So, we settled with whatever the waiter brought to us.
So, just add few more wines in your menu and haan... the naanza was delicious :) :) :)... Cheers!!!!

Bakstage is definitely the coolest and most highly sought after Rock Pub in the city at the moment..Everything here seems to be perfect..right from the decors,the elctrifying ambiance, the coolest DJs to the amazing aasortment of alcohol and super delectable food served..can't get better than this..Period..
The decor is mesmerizing with posters of Rock legends, the retro music played here and the ambiance on special nights is just electrifying..They have a large projector for live screening and a pool table on one side..they also have an outside balcony arranged for smoking..They claim to posses the longest Bar in the city,and I can vouch that indeed the Bar is loong enough..
The service is¬† the only week spot in this otherwise perfect establishment..it gets real slow during the busy hours..Pricing is moderate to high but I would say the food and alcohol served here is totally worthy of the prices charged..also they have a Happy Hour going longer than most other places,so cheers on that front too..Do try their LIIT..one of the best mixer in town..
Coming to the food, now normally in Lounge and Pubs like this it is the food where they lacks a bit which they aim to make up with the ambiance,music and offers on booze..But interestingly I have found here they do cook the food with equal care and expertise if not more..In fact even if they are devoid of the ambiance or the booze selection it would still be a top-rated restaurant based on their sheer quality of food served..Last time we ordered:
Beer Batter Fish Finger: Fresh fish,nicely done,crisp,tartar sauce was excellent..
Galouti Kebab Canapes: Served on mini Sheermals this actually taste better than you find in many mughlai joints..meat was soft,tender and cooked nicely..
Kebab Platter: Nice assortment of fish,chicken,mutton and prawn kebabs..all were equally tasty and charred to perfection..
Grilled Pork Chops: Now I try Pork only in selected outlets mainly due to the lack of quality of Pork served mostly in restaurants..Now the Pork served here is one of the Best..I have heardly tasted so soft and tender Pork,it literally comes off with a fork..also the sauce was just perfectly balanced..
Half Roast Chicken with Jack Daniel BBQ Sauce: Ordered this dish on server's suggestion as was told to be their signature dish..and I must say it was spot on..Now normally BBQ sauce tends to get a lot sweeter but this one was just perfect in terms of flavour..also loved the rendering and presentation of Chicken..beautifully done..
Overall I must say not just taste but the presentation gives aesthetic pleasure..We ordered some Hookas alongwith which was also good and the Cocktails and Beer set up the mood perfectly..Overall our total cheque was Rs.5300/-(incl tax) for 4 of us..but must say it was worth every penny..
Food: 5/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 5/5

Word are not enough to describe this place.I have been there over 20 times and every time i have enjoyed to the core.Awesome music,food and service.Although on weekends this place is crowded as hell but their staff doesnt miss to serve anybody equally.A must visit place for party animals.Spacious enough to chill and relax.Pool by the bar.Widesreen if you are up for some drinks with your buddies on some game night.I would however suggest one to not go for veg platters or dishes.All the chicken items are very yum.
The happy hours on drinks uptill 10pm everyday and also the happy hours on Hookah are a must try.
Little pricey on one side because of the taxes levied.

One of the worst experiences of my life. I had initially went to a different place but couldn't find a seat for my group so thought of visiting this place. trust me, made the worst decision of my life. "HORRIBLE" is the word for my experience.¬†
To start with, the service is slow as a snail or perhaps more than that. I had ordered Hookah and a Nachos Pizza. Hookah which was eventually served to me after about 35 mins and asking the waiter thrice for the same. On ordering Budweiser, the waiter comes and asks me whether or not to open the bottle. I was under the assumption that BEERS ARE SERVED CHILLED but the waiter thought otherwise and opened the bottle without telling me the fact that the drink is not even closed to being COLD, forget CHILLED. On confronting the waiter, he said agreed he shouldn't have had served that one.¬†
¬† Moving on, we had ordered a strawberry cocktail. The waiter shows up with the plain ones. On asking about the same, the waiter says that plain one is better. I was like dude, really ? You are going to change the order on your preference? i was taken aback. we got the drink replaced eventually.¬†
¬† Moving further on, remember i had ordered a pizza alongside? yeah, it wasn't served yet. On asking the waiter about the same, he lied to me that they had a shortage of bread and asked me 15 mins more to serve the same ( had ordered 50 mins ago). Being totally frustrated, i asked him to get the manager.¬†
The icing on the cake is here. On complaining to the manager about the events, the manager instead blames me for not checking the bottle to which i said that it was your waiter's duty to get the bottles inspected by the customer before opening and that it was a common sense that beers are served chilled. Next, i complained to him about the pizza. He asked the waiter and the waiter said that he forgot to place the order for the pizza. I confronted the waiter as to why did he lie to me initially and to his defend, the manager asks me whether or not i wanted the pizza in the most "i-dont-give-a-shit" way. i asked him to cancel the order and to get me a cheque. guess what? the cheque arrived within 2 mins.¬†
i would have rated this place in negative, only if zomato allowed me to. well, this place was a nightmare for me and my friends and the rating , 1/5 is way an overstatement.¬†
would strictly advise everyone to stay away from this place. let them realize that it's the customers who pay them.

I visited this place many times and I really like the experience.

Very classy decor, spaciously arranged tables, long bar counter, pool table, perfect lighting. 
The music was quite lively, though outdated. It was definitely a bit loud but having a conversation wasn't too difficult.¬†

The food was really delicious. Till date I have had Fried Calamari, Chicken and Cheese Kebabs (they melt in your mouth), Non-veg Mezze Platter (quite tasty and interesting), Half Roast Chicken with Jack Daniels BBQ sauce (yummy) and Blueberry Cheese Cake (heaven)

The service is pretty slow and takes quite some time. Also you have to repeat the orders 2-3 times for the waiters to understand. They are not quick to understand client's needs.

My experiences have been quite good and I would recommend this place.

Definitely a spot for the young crowds. Placed at sector 5 gives an easy access to the young students as well as the lively people from the near and far offices. Food and serving is quite ok. If ur an alchohol drinker with a liking towards new gen edm  ,rap hip hop music visit after 8 cause before that its basically old classic pop and rocks which might be liked by certain crowd,but definitely not the young crowds who just wanna have fun and get wasted.

Over priced, loud music(read it noise) ,average food and poor service.
Three of us went there at around 7pm in the evening.¬†

Ordered chicken luvaski and chicken tenders in the starters. Had 1 beer(got 1 free as it was during happy hours) along with 1 fresh lime soda. In the main course ordered 1 kung pao noodles with kung pao chicken and another plate of extra noodles. Then finally ordered 1 round of fresh lime soda for each of us. So, this is all we had which is like very very normal order specially when you are planning to have dinner. Only this much of food costs us 2300rs. So definitely overpriced!!

Music was being played throughout but it was really loud and annoying. We even requested them to reduce the volume but they said that it can't be done.

Each of the orders while they took said that it will take 10-15mins but on an average it took 25mins. We kept on telling almost all of the waiters present there but they were hardly bothered about it. Got really pissed off with their service and loud music.

All these wouldn't have mattered if the food had been amazing. Only this could have compensated for all but this even failed to do so.¬†

Please note that this is not a place to dine out peacefully with your friends/family. This is a place to party out with your friends with drinks, loud music.

Before going there heard a lot about this place but it definitely did not match ¬†up to my expectations.

I don't know whether this was a one-off experience but my first (and probably the last) visit here was one of the most awful & unpleasant experiences I've had in our recent visits to any of the cafes. 
We were a group of 10 and we tried out most of the things on the menu. The service was extremely slow and inefficient and the food was equally bad. Most of the things were just stuffed with cheese including paneer toasties & vegetable curries. ( A suggestion to the management, lesser items on the menu with better preparation would be far more appreciated than ennumerable items with little or no preparation at all and cheese doesn't go well with everything ).
None of the smoothies or other non alcoholic mocktails on the menu were available and as a last resort,virgin mohitos  and blue lagoons were served which too were bad and had to be returned for changes. The quantity of rice served with the vegetable and mushroom curry was laughable even for one person.
And as if that was not enough, the ac didn't work properly and the washroom was devoid of any water. All this on a sunday evening! Only the hookah was of some saving grace but that too is standard at most of the places these days.

Utterly disappointed at the entire experience especially after the hype.

BAD SERVICE AND BAD FOOD
Waste of money!! Over priced!!
For starters the ratings is too much for such pathetic food and service. The worst long island ice tea ever.... We ordered a pitcher thinking it's a safe cocktail which can't be bad. But it had to much of cheap rum smell, they hadn't mixed the ingredients properly so the taste was disgusting, we had to sadly waste the drink because it was inedible. The starters were equally bad. Cheese kurkur something was the worst fried dish I ever had, any roadside snacks wud be better. Hariyali paneer tikka seemed like they put some disgusting green paste on the paneer. Yuck!! Waste of money!! Cost us 1850/- the worst of all was that the ac wasn't working in this hot and humid weather. No music was playing in spit of asking several times, they replied that today it is not playing! So blatant. Every time we had to wait at least 15 mins for the waiter to come and attend to our needs. Terrible experience!!! Never again. Please save ur money for a better place!!

I loved the "Chicken Nazza" (Nan+Pizza)...Beer battered Fish...and Achari Fish Tikka... However, the ground floor needs attention too. Though the interiors are nice and i loved the peace...but the service was not so great.. Once i went there with a friend who doesnt drink alcohol.. and i was really disappointed to have just lime soda...you guys will do much better if you have something for people who dont consume alcohol...maybe mocktails or just plain juice....apart from that...you guys rock. Good to see a fancy place coming up in sector 5.

Yesterday was the first time when I chose to sit in the cafe on the first floor. The service was real bad. Food wasn't very impressive too. Paneer Handi and Veg Nachos were okayish. For the food, I can also put the blame on the bunch of VEGETARIANS who were with me.
Looking forward to having a good time in coming days. :) :)

It was 7th April evening aroung 6.30 p.m. in the evening when we made the grave mistake of entering this place. It was already a very chaotic ride reaching here because it was a rainy evening.¬†

But what followed was something that we could never imagine about this so called bar and restaurant. Just when we ordered our food and they started serving the starters, the power went off. We soon realised that there was something wrong with Backstage's connection and almost all the staff got busy in sorting it out. When we started sweating, we requested them to cancel our order or at least those items which were yet to be served.

They refused it and said that the dishes are ready. Now, when they started serving , most of the dishes(specially non veg items) were half-cooked and poorly prepared because of no electricity . There was hardly anything that could satisfy our taste-buds. Also, there was just one waiter who was available for service and he too was terribly messed-up and sweating like us.¬†

Finally, when the bill came, they had charged about 30% extra on non-alcoholic items and about 42% extra on already over priced alcoholic items. We requested for some waiver on at least the service charge pertaining to the poor conditions, no AC, poor service, half cooked food(mostly wasted). But they were adamant and refused to oblige.

So, that was a situation where almost Rs. 1000 per head was spent and we all kept sweating throughout and returned home with empty stomachs.

Excellent place with great music, great food, extremely warm and hospitable staff, amazing collection of wine, scotch and liquor, and an ever welcoming owner always with a big smile on his face. The only thing that makes you return to backstage over and over again is the high standards of service maintained by the owner himself! The food menu goes very well with the drinks and makes you keep coming back for more. If you wish to throw a private party for your close friends and loved ones, this is the place because all the guests are so well looked after as if they are the personal guests of the owner himself.

Thursday night we visited this place for a friends birthday. Bakstage is located bang opposite the entrance of the electronic complex in salt lake sector 5. As u enter the place u realise its a really well made place with comfortable seating and good lighting. Not too dim not too bright.

We took our seat and since happy hours were going we had drinks by pauva in whisky and towers of beer. 

We did order a lot of food and all of it was really good. The mutton rogan josh specially was really palatable and the veg risotto was very very tasty. The other items that we ordered included nachos, dry chilli chicken, fist tikka, paneer tikka, veg platter, veg and chicken kung pao, veg and chicken sizzlers and some masala peanuts. All of it was really nice and absolutely no complains there. 
The staff was friendly and their service was efficient. 

The reason for not a higher rating is that the hookah they served was not upto the mark and needs to be improved. But they did always attend to us properly for the problems faced. 

In the end they gave a complementary cake as it was a birthday being celebrated.

The pricing is a tad on the higher side with 10 of us the bill was around 22k. But to be fair to them we did eat and drink a lot.

A really nice experience overall.  Kudos to the management!!

"Ignorance is bliss"
We all like to follow, but you heading the pit of death, if you in the customer business.

Backstage, probably a lone wolf in salt lake sector-V, or rather an ignorant cat due to lack of competition, believes in not educating their waiters and

make them belief that bill is everything
.

I like the music, the food is decent, the thing that pissed me of is the waiter and manager ignorance.

How can you not understand, that something is clearly written on banners outside your restaurant

. If you do not yourself, what falls under the promotional offer, and are still charging the full amount, well

you just lost a customer.

Bhaiss ke aage been bajana, what my experience was today, and may be true because your waiters were also wearing black.

My IT people of salt-lake and Rajarhat, I will like to quote someone from your own city : "Arise -Awake and go to Park Street, South Calcutta, to much better places."

Back Stage, I am sure you are ignorant to your social media pages and will be ignorant to this review..

Yet, I am telling you something. Having a playlist, decorating interior a pub like a NCR, Pune Or Bangalore like one will not make you one, but treating and making your customers
¬†will.

THANKS

Their cocktails are horrible so whenever you go stick to conventional pegs and beers. Food is very tasty with immaculate platings on all the dishes. The thing that'll floor you is their hospitality. They are extremely well mannered people and will go out of their way, to make you come back again. Bakstage rocks!!!

The above rating is based on the service predominantly. It was a Saturday, an IPL match was going on & the stuff was too eager to watch the match rather than doing their own work. Moreover, though it claims to be a rock pub, the collection of music isn't at all impressive & it should sport a performance stage, which is a trademark for any rock pub. Food is overpriced, give the amount served. Overall, an average pub with overhyped reviews.

Pros:
1. Ambience. Simply amazing. Right from the lighting to the arrangement to the choice of music. Perfect.
2. Spacious. The tables are set sporadically. Enough room to never feel cramped.¬†
3. Full size bar.
4. Pool table. Duh!

Cons.
1. Food was slightly below par. Tried the starters only as we were there for a short duration in the afternoon.¬†
2. Overpriced with respect to the quality and quantity of food.
3. Service. Drinks were prompt but food was greatly delayed even with an almost empty occupancy.

Overall 3.5 because it happens to be an amazing place to hangout both as a couple or with your buddies in groups of 4-5. The pool, lighting, setup and the bar make for a great combination.

The music is too loud! And it's kinda annoying. Coz you have to literally shout at times and the person who is taking order will never listen in one go. The ambience is good and the food is also satisfying and pricing is descent enough but it's a headache because whatever they play is good but then again it's too loud.

A much needed place in Salt Lake. Both the pub and the restaurant on the ground floor are amazing. The staff is very prompt and courteous. I love the nazzas which is a new concept. The soups here are also great. I like the way they present the food.¬†

I took my parents to the ground floor cafe, and the staff made sure they got the indian dishes they wanted even though its not explicit in the menu. He suggested a raw banana vegetable which all of us were apprehensive about, but it really turned out well. I could never imagine having a raw banana dish even at home leave alone in a restaurant.

The chocolate thick shake is really yumm...¬†

I love the feel of this place and visit it quite often.

I was wishing to visit the place 4 a long time, but I was disappointed, music was too loud upstairs, one can barely hear others, washroom's flush wasn't working properly , food was not upto the mark, place is good for youngsters with restricted pocket money, Ipl offers were ok. Might not gonna visit again.

An excellent pub going down drastically..!!

Pros:

Good location in Salt Lake, easy to locate.

Well decorated

Great ambience

Good food (at least most of it)

Cons:

Music has got lots of scope on improvement

Quite a few items listed on the menu not available

STAFF including the MANAGER!!

The STAFF there is only the reason for me to rate this a 1 star. Wish i could rate it lower. This place has become a place of scam. 

Our Experience:

This is the 2nd time, I went to this place to celebrate my birthday and go out partying with my friends. Ordered whole lot of beers, hookah and food. Most of the food tasted good except Jalapeno Cheese Sticks where i was expecting cheese and not cottage cheese (paneer). When we were served this, we were a bit confused as on taking a bite we realised it was just paneer pakora not cheese nor jalapeno. Upon complaining, we were told by the staff that this is what they serve and refused to cancel or change the order.

Secondly, we were on the closing and about to leave just then one of our friends asked for 3 more beers. As soon as i got to know about it, I approached to cancel that order since we had enough to drink and that we had to drive back home. These drinks were not even on our table when I requested to cancel them n I was refused again saying "We do not cancel orders once it is placed". Unbelievable!! Beer not opened and not even on the table yet and they refuse to cancel. Upon talking to the manager he said the same and walked away refusing to discuss any further on this. Even after I tried to explain we need to drive a bit far off, he still didnt take the drinks back and gave us the bill. Upon checking the bill we realised, we were charged for a lot more items on the bill which we didn't order at all!! Ultimately we came to yet more arguments with the staff and the management there but yet again they refuse to do anything about it and forced us to pay and leave the place. Ultimately we paid about Rs. 5000 extra which wasnt ordered/served to us at all.

In all, the evening was just ruined with all this misbehavior and rudeness of the staff and management here. Guys just BEWARE of this place.. STAY AWAY if you can... There are loads of party options in Kolkata doing better who actually care for their guests unlike this place.

It's a two floored resto-pub. The upper floor is the pub section, where we jumped in, a perfect sophisticate pub in the heart of sector V at webel stop beside the main road. An easy place to find out.

Nice ambiance with wooden American pub style decor and good music. Most likely to tell about their sitting arrangements they are not too clumsy. You can walk freely between tables. Another key point, you can watch live sports on screen which is placed perfectly so that you can be able to view that from both ground and top floor. during world cup we visited over their with office colleagues and client and enjoyed the live match & food & booze. Great atmosphere !!

The waiters are prompt, sober and hospitable however their food service is little slow as they told us they prefer to serve straight from oven dishes. But as the quality of food is top notch so you can wait a little long grabbing your lager or drinks.

As in the mood of boozing, ordered several starters, 

Fish and chips: Crispy outside with soft and juicy fresh fish inside, served with home made tartar. Liked the presentation style and so do the taste.

Chicken qualmi kebab: Perfectly cooked tengri pieces with perfect balance of spice, with soft and tender chicken pieces. thumbs up :)

Mixed kebab platter: Chicken hariyali kebab, tikka kebab and reshmi kebab in one plate served with tamarind base sour sweet and spicy home made sauce. Chicken pieces were good and freshly out of the tandoor. 

And the mains:

Grilled fish in tomato sauce:¬† Honestly, this is one of the best grilled fishes that I ever had. Fish piece was grilled to perfection placed upon the smashed potato with freshly boiled veggies served in a sizzling pan. I personally don't like tomato base dish that much but it's a dish that made me wonder :)

Smoked chicken pizza:¬† While placing the pizza order, one of waiters suggested me to take smoked chicken pizza. It was nice but not extraordinary :)

Endings...

Chocolate rum musse cake: A complete wonder. Loved it :)

As per the quality and service of food it's a pocket pinch place. Apart form the slow food service, this is a nice pub to re-visit with friends and colleagues.

Backstage started a couple of years back and ever since then pubbing scene of salt lake improved quite a lot.¬†¬†

I have visited only the pub, so my opinion is solely based on the pub, upstairs. 

Location: 

Located in Salt Lake Sector V and can be easily spotted on the main road. They have valet parking. 


Ambience: 

The setup is all wooden and spread across two floors, the upper floor being the pub. The setting reminds me a lot like warehouse caf√©, New Delhi. If you liked Warehouse Caf√©, I bet this place wont disappoint you much.

Very lively ambience but yes this place is missing good music. The music doesn‚Äôt compliment the English Pub setting. 

They‚Äôve snooker and foosball table to have some friendly matches. The crowd is mostly young and vibrant. 


Service:

Drinks are served pretty quick but the food takes time depending on the rush, I suppose. With great company and a bottle of beer I don‚Äôt mind to wait a little. 


Food:

They have a full course menu but I have tried only a few of their starters and they are just fine. I find this place more of an afternoon/evening hangout with friends and some chilled beer. 


Drinks:

This is the main reason people come here. They have beer in Pint, Pitcher and Tower sizes and you also have the option of Draught beer. You can expect to get mostly all of the most common single malts, scotch, bourbon, vodka, etc. 

Happy Hours must be properly utilized for a great bargain.

They don‚Äôt serve complimentary snacks/peanuts with alcohol, so there are literally no free lunches here. 

Sheesha:

Must try ‚Äòpaanch paan‚Äô flavor with a choice of base, Ice, water, milk, or alcohol. I prefer the regular base.


Price: 

I‚Äôve always visited here during happy hours with a 1:1 offer so I can say a group of four having beer with some light snacks can easily settle the tab within INR. 4000.¬†¬†A bit pricey, but definitely a nice place to hangout with like-minded people.

An average experience at Bakstage. The place was filled with office crowd trying to bring an end to another long weekend. The way the staff handled the guests, I think they could use more waiters. 
We started off by using the welcomingly empty pool table, but apparently it's charged separately! And what a cost that was! The food was welcoming though. The  jalape√±o cheese sticks and the mezzeh platter are worth giving a shot for all vegetarians. The burgers and sizzlers were forgettable. 
With multiple screens all around the floor, one of the best places in salt lake to watch a match I would say. The crowd (atleast while I have been there) was fantastic. The DJ played some amazing English numbers and some run of the mill Hindi ones too. 
Overall, definitely a fine place to hang out with little pressure on your wallet.

I recently visited this place after my friend came here for a visit, and by far the best pub experience of my life. Awesome ambience, dim lights, the small open floor where you can dance, and obviously the hookah and the drinks. The food is a bit expensive, as compared to the quantity, but that isn't stopping me to visit there again. A nice place in the vicinity of salt lake.

Thumbs up ..?

Yesss ... We needed it. A place with proper choice of music n perfect ambience that jus let's u loosen a bit...
Went there n had long Iceland iced tea... Definitely its worth buying a pitcher... ;)
N alcohol is decently priced.
But I must say u guys needed to introduce more snacks in the foodies menu.. E.g. wen I asked one of those guys about special assorted sea food platter.. They said it's ally of prawns n fish items n it was of 1295/- not a deal... But wats special in it :/
So I went for fiery chicken wings n the waiter reputed to scare me with " it gonna b really fiery look" with a smile of course... But trust me.. It was chicken wings which u eat n can tell the name of excessively used ketchup they had used in it...it was like a chicken chop...dipped in ketchup :/
N finally v had ordered beer battered fish fry/nugget..Nothing special about it... I don taste or smell beer from it n well jus like a normal fish fry n as tasty as a that!

But I got outta all blues of it as I was too happy with 6 Heineken @ 699 ;) :P
Yup now u know y sumbody will go back in there Well it has a cute dance floor of its own kind.. N u ll love to jiggle on it with ur girlies...
They have hookahs n sum kiwi flavor was new for me to try out :D

N the music was lovely.. Crowd was jus lovelier..no complain..

Jus a suggestion..pls do upgrade availability of diff items n the taste a bit too...spclly for foodies like us..
N I m surely going back again n again in there :)

I called the place to confirm about their IPL deal of the month package and they said that the offer might be discontinued before the offer expiry date. Zomato states the offer is till the end of April but the restaurant said the offer might change before that. A contradiction in Zomato and the restaurant's claims is definitely not good for the customer.

To start with the location of this place is the biggest positive. The entire space is huge and is enough for a lot of persons to fit which is a must for weekends considering the locality. The inside is very well done in terms of lighting & seating & decor. The tables are not located close to each other and hence not clumsy. They have a small outside seating area also if you love it. A huge screen is there for catching matches while gulping on some beers. The finger food they serve is awesome. They have a huge bar counter with proper bar stools. The price is on the higher side but they have offers going on which is kind of a relief if you dont want to spend much. Parking is something that they should address.

Suuppppeeerrrrr cool pub..!! Happy hours are till 9:45pm.... just unbelievable! Their hookahs, specially "teen paan", are simply to die for. Great atmosphere, top notch hospitality and super cool waiters. Live sports is always on screen. Pool table is also there, though they charge extra bucks for it. Only drawback is the food amount. It's really small as compared to the price they are charging. But overall, a great place to sneak in with friends. Grab a drink and chillax..!!!!

The place is very unique... Nice decor.Lovely environment.Good crowd.. Good stock of drinks and humble staff will really make your visit a memorable one....

I will surely visit again. After 8 the place totally changes with the DJ playing some nice numbers.

5stars to the team.

One negative thing I found was that the price is on the higher side.If the price can be lowered down a bit also,this will be a Rockstar of a place....

The only place in Kolkata which I can completely relate to and enjoy.. being a Bombay-ite.. and having moved to Kolkata. The ambience is good. The service as well. Music.. Definitely tremendous. Pink Floyd.. Beatles.. Bob Dylan.. John Lennon.. I can go on and on. The entire week.. Right from 20th till the 27th.. It was spent in Backstage and spent well. I mainly come here for booze and music.

A few days back I was at Bakstage at Salt lake sector 5 with a large group of friends and we had a really enjoyable time.The fact that we were a large group,enabled us to sample a lot of their food,drinks and hookah,neither of which let us down.

The food menu is not very extensive but it is nice and tasteful and contains quite a few different kinds of perparations to suit people with varied tastes.I sampled the chicken wings platter which was wonderful.The chicken wing in the honey mustard sauce was the undoubted star.It was sublime.The barbeque sauce was nice too.The Hustle Burger is one of the biggest and baddest burgers available anywhere in Kolkata.Myself being a huge burger lover,I thoroughly enjoyed the humongous burger with a crunchy double patty.For main course I tasted the grilled pork chops which was again pretty good.One of my friends decided to have the Thai green curry and we were honestly skeptical of such a choice at a place like this.But even it turned out to be quite decent and flavourful.Overall I was impressed with the quality of the food.

The drinks menu is nice and extensive.The bar is quite well stocked.The cocktails though could have been a bit better.One of my friends had the Long island iced tea and I felt it was a bit average.I have tasted far better elsewhere.Other than that the drinks were satisfactory and to make matters all the more enjoyable they have happy hours till late at night on weekdays.They also have offers and combo meals on food too which I did not try.

We also had the hookah and it is one area which I felt requires a little improvement.It took a long time in arriving and it was just about okay.I am not really a big hookah person but I felt I have had better hookah at many other places.My friends also were a tad disappointed with the quality of the hookah.

The prices are a little on the higher side.But the quality more or less justifies the price tag.The service could be improved upon a little.The staff are friendly and helpful.But sometimes it was a bit difficult to catch their attention and some of our orders took quite a long time.The ambiance and decor is also pretty classy and likeable.Another thing about this place which impressed us all was the quality of the music.It was extremely tasteful and classy.The volume was also spot on and not overtly loud-one could enjoy the beat and also have a conversation if they desired too.

Overall Bakstage impressed us all and we had a wonderful time.I would surely be back soon.This place is surely worth recommending.Enjoy.Cheers!

Visited this place this weekend with my girls. Frankly I did not expect it to be so good. The food was average but the decor, the ambience and the good crowd makes up for it. Also the waiters were nice and decent. I am definitely going to suggest this place to anybody who is tired of going to the same restaurants/pubs in town. Give this place a try. I'm sure you're gonna like it as much as we did. Cheers! ?

I have been there quite a number of times and this place has never really disappointed me. The best thing about Bakstage is it's location. It's right on the main road. So whether you are going to office or coming back, you are forced to notice it! Love it or hate it, you definitely can't ignore it! So it caught my eye a couple of times before I actually decided to hit Bakstage. The ground floor is the restaurant while the 1st floor is the lounge. So if you wanna party after office or just sit and relax after a hectic day at work with some good food , hookah , drinks and some really good music then this is the best place to be. Their food is pretty good. Though a little expensive if you consider the quantity but they definitely do not compromise on the taste! I would recommend their beer batter fish fingers, smoky hot chicken wings and chicken suvlaki for the non-veg starters. For the mains, they serve really good sizzlers. The vegetarians too have a decent variety to choose from. My veggie friends had ordered corn salt and pepper and veg nachos wachos as far as I can remember! The corn salt and pepper could have been better though! It was too crispy and hard, as if the corn was deep fried. However, I have no complaints against the non-veg spread! The chicken pieces were tender and soft cooked with an adequate amount of sauce. The fish too was well cooked and the batter wasnt that thick, just the way I like it! Coming to the drinks, they have happy hours throughout the day! I mean, WOW, now that's something to be really happy about! Weekdays they have buy-1-get-1 while on weekends they have buy-2-get-1. I personally think that's a very good deal if you compare Bakstage with it's competitors in sector 5 at least! Though the cocktails are not the best I have had but then they are decent. And after office, you dont even need to go anywhere far, and still you are getting 2 for the price of 1! Plus I should definitely mention that the bartenders are really sweet! He gave us a couple of free kamikaze shots making the happy hours happier.. ;)    Ambience is another plus point of Bakstage! I love the high chairs. Also, the decor and lights are perfect to go with your mood after a couple of drinks with your friends.. But if you ask me the USP of Bakstage, I would say the MUSIC! The dj plays some great songs and I would definitely give him browny points for that. Though this place is a letdown for Bollywood lovers because the DJ mostly plays bolly post 10.30/11pm unless he feels like playing old bolly songs suddenly one fine day and you'll get to hear Adnan Sami singing 'kabhi toh nazar milao'..:P However, I repeat again, I love the music. And I dont mind if he doesn't play bollywood, if he keeps playing my favourite tracks in different versions every time I visit this place. ;)

Located at the heart of Salt lake Sector 5 , backstage is one of the happening destinations of the techies . The first impression is the uber cool effect of the pub which is unlike any other pubs in the Sector 5 . The walls are draped with pics of famous liquor brands across the globe. Even the washrooms are decorated with posters of famous musicians like Elvis Presley , Jim Morrison , John Lennon . The pub is flanked by three gigantic plasma LEDs for Live Sports screenings along with a pool table for a perfect weekend recreational juncture . We basically enjoyed Manchester United vs Liverpool soccer match at backstage with drinks . So food is not emphasised here practically. First of all don't be fooled by the exorbitant price of the tequila. The Blancos tequila was a total waste of 800 bucks. Its really baffling that they are providing a "nakli maal" with such a high price tag. Although the attitude of the bartenders are humane but they are least proactive and very lethargic to serve drinks on time . We made full use of the Happy Hours which is a very good marketing strategy incorporated by the pub i.e one drink free for every drink. We tried 2 pegs of Jack Daniels , Jim Beam tagged by a couple of chilled Heinekens. Although the service is of a lil bit of disappointing but I am completely bowled by the mesmerizing ambience , the crowd and the gigantic bar which is decorated magnificently , one of the best in Kolkata. The review points are only for the ambience and not for the service . The management needs to gear up it's service in full throttle.

Hey as heard the place is the most talked about hangout in kol dese days..so even I decided to have a hangout plan dere and after all the possible enquiries and after having a conversation over phome wth the concerned person I went bt to my disappointment the place was very dark and dinjy..half of the available tables are already reserved. .
As per the conversation over phone the happy hours where there bt insteas of 1+1 it was 2+1 which qas again a wrong info I was given..
The DJ was to come at 8 as per the info over phone which did not come till 9.
The menu was also not very wow..as they dint even had coconut qater with vodka which is d most common serve now..very limited options in food and the platter which we ordered was bt dat yummy...
So for me this place is a total no and y do I spend so much jus to have a hokah and a beer which I get it much cheap in any hookah parlours and that too much more beter quality wise...
Please think twice before dropping here...

This place is not that cheap as they say but still people who love drinking, eating and above all good remixes should visit this place.

Let's just b frank, A place so expensive must offer you the best experience at every corner. The music played is not always good and mostly Loud and noisy.
They generally pick good tracks during very late hours though.
The snooker board is at a strategically bad corner with crammed space while they charge 500 INR fr an hour. Organisers... think again!
Once it happened, the waiter attending came up with our bill closed even without asking if we are closing it or no.


Come on ! This is in the middle of a great location... you are earning good money. Ensure better service and time for us the Owners!

Well, I have been regular to this pub for the last 2 years, and i really like the place.Pros:¬†
1. The Hookah is awesome, they know how to make it. Just stick to the basics and order a teen pan-rose or a brainfreezer and your sheesha evening is smoked up!2. The food served is delicious. I love their whole Italian menu.
3. Nice ambience, crowd is good

Cons;
1. They dont seem to change their music. Dont take me wrong, music played here is good but as i have been here for atleast 20+ times, i can almost guess what song is going to come next. Thats not what u expect from a resto-rock pub2. The prices of drinks are exorbitantly high + add 30% to the bill as taxes, and you are shelling out around 2k per person for 3 pints of beer, a hookah and a pizza.
3. Some of waiters/bartenders behave poorly and in an unapologeticaly indecent manner.All said, its still one of my fav places, and i would recommend it. But the management should look at these minor problems as well.

While the food and ambience were really good, what spoilt it completely was the way we were treated. Because the outlet was closing at 12am, the staff switched off the lights even though we were still eating. After that, we were asked, in as many words, to finish up in the next 5 minutes and leave.
Completely spoilt the mood and our initial impression of the place. Would've given it 4 points had it not been for the service.

Good ambience.. not so good food.. prices are on the higher side as compared to very less quantity food..serving boys are average, no compliments no mouth freshners, a very basic paper bill not given in a folder. do not have main course food.. opium a much better place..

I wanted to visit this place for some time ever since I heard of it.So when my friends came over from Bangalore I grabbed the opportunity and went to this place. The decor of this place is just mesmerizing and the outdoor sitting is the perfect place to watch a glorious sunset over the high rised buildings of sector 5.The bar is well equipped and happy hours serve up to their name.We had ordered an american chicken burger which was delicious to our surprise.They have a great music collection for setting the mood.But I was disappointed in the staff,they were laid back because it was a weekday and the service was slow but nonetheless its a great place to hangout with your friends and colleagues if you are planning to spend a little extra.I will surely like to visit this place again on a weekends they have special treats on those days!

One of the best options in Salt Lake with the best crowd. Great music. Great service. Great ambience. The food they offer is really cool. The mongolian sizzler is a great choice coupled with C4 i.e. a cutlet with corn and cheese. And the desert here is also too good. I would personally recommend having the Tiramisu. The chef also has too good suggestions if you would ask. My suggestion would be to improve their hookah. It is amazing at first but it dies out pretty fast.

Bakstage was on my wishlist for last sometime and finally we landed up here last Sunday evening.Location is a 5 on 5. Coming to its ambience I have always been allured to sportsbar and my review might seem a little biased.Perfectly arranged furnitures,pool table and a wall ornamented with guitars accompanied by great english tracks there was an adrenaline rush in me.
Coming to the menu,we ordered a beer tower and a paan flavoured hookah which was escorted with beer batter fish fingers which was great and nachos that was good in quantity.
Their service was a little reluctant and also the price was briefly on the higher side.
But overall my experience was gratifying and would like to visit again.

Cheers..

Walked in to Backstage for the very first time yesterday afternoon.¬†

Over a leisurely three and half hours we indulged in the by now popular Half Roast Chicken with Jack Daniel Sauce , a milk base hookah with one coal change, chicken tenders, Blueberry cheese cakes and ¬†some light beverage.¬†

There are enough reviews around for the food , quality and quantity wise and I would say the food was decent enough. Though I would like to make a special mention about the blueberry cheese cakes. ¬†

All said and done, ¬†I feel you would go to Bakstage primarily for the vibe and ambience . The good food certainly helps. ¬†

For those mindful of their budgets even in a hip pub; I would like to point out that there is a VAT (14.5%), Service Tax (4.94%), Service Charge (10%) on the prices mentioned on the menu chart. So a Half Roast Chicken with Jack Daniel Sauce , which is Rs 575/- on the menu chart would come as Rs 744 /- on your bill. ¬†For regular pub hoppers the above info might be a little old school ¬†:).

Planning to come back to this place a couple of more times this summer !

This place gives all that x-factor to the techie gully of Kolkata. Located in Saltlake sector-5 this place is frequented by mostly techies and travelers all round the year. The food here is amazing and the place has got great ambiance, music and people around. Yesterday I went in there again and this review is based on that last visit of mine -

Coming to the food, we had ordered for -

a). Half Roast Chicken with Jack Daniel BBQ sauce - Two roasted chicken full legs that came with sauteed veggies and mashed potato and garnished with parsley, also had an additional bowl of BBQ sauce. Instead of mashed potato you may opt for noodles or rice as per your choice; though mashed potato goes very well with this, so go for it. This dish is one of their signature dishes and one must try this out for sure. Though it is served in a small place but it is very filling and soul satisfying. This dish alone sets this place apart from the rest to a great extent.

b). Fish & Chips - Deep fried fish fillets that comes with pub chips, it is served with tartar sauce and lemon wedges. The fish was extremely fresh and goes well with some beer.

c). Lamb burra kebabs - It is kind of lamb chops served with onion rings and sauces. Frankly speaking I have never tasted a softer lamb before, it was extremely tender and was just melting in the mouth!

d). Chicken nazza - One of the great appetizers, it is a naan pizza. Broadly speaking it is close to a thin crust pizza filled with toppings and enough chicken cubes.

Service - The service in general is extremely slow, to say the least. We were aware of this fact and so we placed our order over phone which they accepted but when we reached there on time we discovered that they haven't prepared anything. It took a solid one hour for the food to reach our table. Also they were not refilling water proactively in our empty glasses, had to call them out everytime which was surely a let down. The billing process was also extremely slow, it took an astonishing 15 minutes! Overall, though the waiters were polite but the service has to be a lot more efficient, fast and prompt.¬†

Ambiance - You have to be there to experience it, the place is much unlike other average Kolkata pubs. The first floor pub is uber cool, dimly lit and wrapped with images of western music legends starting from Hendrix, Lennon, Elvis to Morrison and more. The place has got a real huge bar counter, huge projector screens, private dining area, pool table and more. Even the washrooms are all covered with pictures of rock legends and are very clean and hygienic.

Overall - A delightful visit that surely left some lovely memories. Only the service needs to be faster and bit proactive. But if you have got some time to spare, do visit this place to unwind yourself and give your tastebuds some real amazing pleasure of life.

Cheers!

Visiting this place was very relaxing for me just after my GATE exam... as soon as i entered the restaurant we were guided to upstairs as soon as the lift door opened the ambiance was eye soothing with dim light and to my surprise my favourite song 'Hotel California' was being played.. but the music was too loud which i noticed after sometimes and the same songs were repeated over and over again.... then we seated to a table near the bar and were given the menu... by looking at the menu book i was a bit disappointed because it was torn :( now for ordering we went with the reviews and ordered HALF ROAST CHICKEN WITH JACK DANIEL BARBQ SAUCE sizzler... ¬†the sauce was just superb perfect texture n flavour the chicken was soft and moist dipped in sauce and the veggies were smoked.. it just tasted awesome... i loved the dish and it actually goes well with beer.. then we settled for a platter of Assorted Bruschetta which were simply rusk biscuits topped with an assortment of cheese and tomato, basil mushroom and spinach.. here the spinach topping was perfect with flavours and tasted better than my expectation the mushroom and basil topping the flavours were very distinct and you could taste all the elements along with the cheese... but the tomato topping was disappointing after the first two toppings the finely chopped tomatoes lacked flavour and lacked the binding element too.. due to which they fall off in first bite... the overall visit was a great experience and would have given 4.5 ¬†for the food but due the these reasons i settled with 4.. i hope to give more in my next visit...

I went to the Backstage 1st floor on the 14th afternoon for a lunch with my wife. I had called them before on the 13th¬† at 09874448334,¬†to confirm if they are serving lunch on 14th, since they have a party in the evening as well. The man on the other end of the line confirmed me of the availability of lunch till 6 pm and also that all the sizzlers does come with a choice of rice/ noodles combo, indicating that with every sizzler that we order we get a Noodle or Rice combo, within the price of the¬†sizzler¬†.On the 14th when we stepped in the Backstage 1st floor of Backstage Wine, we saw that they were more interested in¬†preparing for their evening event than catering to customers. After a wait, a waiter came to us for taking order and without noting down anything, vanished. And then he came back with another waiter and started discussing what does the menu mean and its contents.We by the way, had ordered a simple enough menu -1 Bacon Caesar Salad, and 1 Mix Grill Sizzler with the choice of Noodle that comes complementary in the order as confirmed to me on the¬†telephonic¬†conversation of 13th Feb' 15.The 1st waiter then turned to us to inform that "We only serve Noodles with Sizzlers", which by the way indicates that -They Do Not serve Rice with Sizzlers, which in turn indicates that either the menu set by the owners of the Restaurant -Backstage are lying, or he himself is. We, however, agreed to Noodles with sizzler. To my surprise, the waiter never took the pain to pen down the menu. He instead simply went off. And the 2nd Waiter then turned to us and said -"So you want Salad -is it non-veg? (I believe Bacon is very much non-veg), and you want Mix Sandwich (where on earth did he get sandwich??? or it may be that the owner/ owners of Backstage sells Sandwich on the name of Sizzlers)". To this my wife got extremely sceptical. And I corrected this waiter on the menu that we are looking for -1 Bacon Caesar Salad, and 1 Mix Grill Sizzler. He then to my utter surprise started to tell me that the sizzler will come with bacon and shredded chicken and what not, but no noodles.I got irrittated by then, and asked him why is that since I had already called and confirmed that all sizzlers do come with combo of rice/ noodles and that's included in the price. To this he nodded and said ok.Post that he did not pen down the order and simply walked to a computer, and started diong something. We felt really bad on the whole scenario, and walked out of the place. Nobody even bothered to come and ask, what is the problem that we are leavig post ordering the food. Even though there wad a tall guy, who seemed to be a man in charge, but never cared to ask.I rated 1 since I could not find any option to given negative ratings to this most unprofessional place for spoiling my lunch and valuable time. They alwas seemed very eager to get people to the evening arrangements than to serve their customers. Probably they felt that what will 1 customer order 700 bucks of food matter.I would like to say here, that it does matter. Because this 1 small customer goes far and loud to talk good of your business, and shouts out bad service issues far and loud as well.

We (2 couples) reached Backstage on 8th February (Sunday evening) around 7 pm after making a reservation over phone. On entering the lounge we found most of the seats empty but were told that all were reserved. Inspite of reminding them that we too had made a reservation we were finally offered a table which was the least to our liking. While placing our orders the first disappointment came through in the form of non-availability of draught beer. However, we placed orders for Miller Beers and Long Island Teas with a hookah. The hookah came in about ten minutes later but no sign of our order for beers and LITs. On enquiring, we were told that Miller Beer and LIT is not available. We simply requested to see the manager. This bearer walked up to the Manager and possibly told him of our plight. We could overhear the manager (MAC) telling him that simply convey that these items are not available and I can do nothing about it. The bearer did not get back to us. We decided to leave the place and while starting to¬†get up¬†were told by a bearer that the manager will attend to us shortly. The manager Mac finally reached us and heard us out... I also told him that by this time, we had¬†decided to leave .... he walked away from the table and simply sent us the invoice for the almost unused hookah which was the only item of our order served!!! WE PAID AND LEFT!!!

After a long long time, I was back to Kolkata and at this wonderful pub for lunch and beer.
We ordered the Half roast chicken in BBQ sauce.I would like to go with crowd and give a big thumbs up to the awesome Jack Daniels Bbq sauce.It was something I haven't tasted before.The chicken sizzler was superb and I liked the way its smoky taste blended with the sauce and the veggies. Next we settled for a platter of Assorted Bruschetta which were simply rusk biscuits topped with an assortment of cheese and tomato, basil mushroom and spinach.The spinach and mushroom ones were awesome but the tomato disappointed.However, with the fine ambience ,company and some awesome beer ,I better overlook it and give it 4.5

bakstage had long been wishlisted, finally striking it off last saturday. the ambience is chilling , decor is musculine with wooden high tables and couches, a long bar counter stocking premium spirits and wines and amazing music. however the open air balcony couches lacks maintainance and used as random smoking zone. we had
2 miller pints ( they run 2:1 offer on weekends) as they went out of draught!
HALF ROAST CHICKEN WITH JACK DANIEL BARBQ SAUCE sizzler - awesome! the dish to order at backstage!!
prefer visiting on weekdays 1:1 makes you go easy on ur pocket (y)

Visited this place a couple of weeks back. Went there with lots of expectation. Places around the New Town Office area haven't been a great experience mostly.
First look was great. Really nice ambiance if you just enter. However after a while it gets irksome. See here is the thing - dim lighting is greatin moderation however such dim lighting that you can't read the menu & have to use your phone to go to Zomato to really search for the menu...that kind of cranks you up...
- Ordered Chicken cheese kebab - how can two great ingredients taste so like sawdust is a real wonder.¬†
- Ordered Kalamari,¬†The as fish lovers ordered more of fish platter - were told it would be a lot. The portions were quite funny in how small the amount of kalamari in the mail dish was. ¬†
Overall bad experience hopefully not to be repeated.

Went on a week day and was thrilled to see that Kolkata doesn't stop bringing new places everytime I visit. Great ambiance and super friendly staff. The place was lively, has a huge bar counter, a pool table and a private section for groups. Tried the four cheese pizza, but was not as impressed with it. The four cheese are supposed to be served in different slices but they mixed all of them together which was a little disappointing. They had a rule of not serving smoothies in the first floor but could serve mocktails and cocktails. A kiwi flavour mock tail was served which refreshed my mood and I was ready to other stuffs and didn't regret it. The cheese kurkure surprised my mouth with a unique flavour that one can find in a Kachori. Could not stop eating this. The hookah was above average but I have had much better flavours. Summing up, a great place with even a better potential... Kudos...

Went to this place first when it was only a few days old- wasn't so impressed as such. 
Fast forward to recent days- although initial hesitance did hold me back but thought of giving it another chance and boy I was glad I did. 

The place, to start with, had great music to strike the right cords with your mood. 
Food was good, service apt and the hukka was well made. 
All in all had a good experience. 
Special mention for the onion rings- being an 'onion ring connoisseur', I absolutely loved the way they made em- be it the presentation which is the onions are stacked on a stick or the way they were made. Loved it so much that ended up ordering another portion of it.

15th Jan, had a class after 3 hours and just didn't know how and where to spend that time, we 4 friends decided to go to backstage.
An awesome place with a very friendly and cool ambience (not the cold cool!)
A nice designing tilted towards the music world.. With guitars on the wall.. Cassettes and their covers framed up..a beautifully kept pool table and the most important good food!
We ordered "veg mezze platter" and "roasted tomatoes vegetable sandwich" and both satisfied me. Though the sandwich impressed me way more than I thought that it would, the smoky taste just made my taste buds go crazy and had I not been there with the other 3 (girly consciousness) i would have ordered another one :p

I have been wanting to go here since long as this is near to my workplace and also have got some good reviews.So landed up there on a weekday for lunch. It is now called as Back..to the Desi cafe. The decor is pretty nice. The ground floor looks more like a cafe with cosy chairs and vibrant indoor decorations. We went to the first floor for lunch. There was good old Bryan Adams playing in the background.
I found the service pretty slow but.
We ordered Half Roast chicken as a sizzler. It was wholesome and awesome. The portion was enough for two, the chicken was soft, the sauce was tasty and had the essence of Jack Daniel's as written on the menu. We wanted to order Grilled pork chops too, but was unavailable. We also ordered Garlic noodles with Manchurian chicken.. it was so so and nothing wow, here the quantity was adequate for one person only.
The prices are a bit steep, nevertheless definitely worth a visit.

This place had been on my wishlist for quite some time now and despite being quite near to my office, I didn't have the chance to visit it until last Saturday.

I went there with three other friends and arrived at around 6.30 pm. We were asked if we wanted to go to the back or sit out front, We opted for the back. I was impressed the moment I entered,as it was dimly lit,with a huge bar and properly furnished with a small dance floor.
We were ushered to a 4-seater table and we ordered two hookahs(small ones) of Three Pan flavor,a non veg platter and a cone of chicken popcorn. The food was served within 10 mins and tasted alright. They took a while serving the hookahs but that was ok with us as when served the hookahs had an incredible flavor.
After that we ordered a pitcher of the fabled Long Island Iced Tea and I have to admit that it was great. A while later we ordered another hookah(this time the large one), a chicken wing platter and a friend of mine ordered one tequila shot.
We were not disappointed the second time as well in respect of the hookah and the food but my friend complained about the tequila saying it was low grade.
We left Bakstage at around 9.30 pm and I must say it was a time well spent. The choice of music and the ambiance of this place is fantastic and I would love to visit this place again sometime.

For people who like it loud ! Backstage is right in front, at the heart of sector V. Liquor prices tad expensive but they have some offers running all the time, makes sense to stick to them. Some really nice soups and salads if you are a bit hungry as otherwise it's mostly a den for the holics. Nice big place with a mediocre DJ and an average bar tender. Sizzlers are good and service is very prompt. Best lounge at the moment in sector v.

P.s. Must try the hookah here! ;)

Trust me I had the best sizzler in town yet "Nutty Cottage Cheese Steak with Mustard Sauce"- a ¬†must have for all the veggies. It activates all your taste buds.
As referred in the Menu - the most demanding appetite, do try The Backstage Hustle Burger- you wont be able to finish it all by yourself. You will be in peace after craving these two dishes.¬†
A plus point is the Happy Hours.
That's what makes it a stand out among all the other Pubs. Having such a place in the IT sector of the city is surely a bliss.
It will surely be my at the top of my charts for a fairly long time.

Have been here quite a number of times. One of the super awesome pubs in Kolkata with outstanding music and brilliant ambience.
The sitting arrangement is not quite like the other pubs , which may be considered as a drawback... for who wants to be sitting straight after few drinks ;) But going with the concept they have , its perfectly fine for me.
The happy hours and special offers (vday etc.) will impress you undoubtedly. The food here is awesome unlike many other pubs where food is paid less attention to. Love their BBF, roasted chicken and platters.
The crowd is also good enough..although high chances of bumping into your boss because of its increasing popularity among the sec5 fraternity .

The 4.0 rating is mostly due to the fabulous decor and awesome ambience. Situated right on the Webel More at Sector 5, Bakstage is hard to miss due to the large glass fornt displaying a tastefully done interior cafe that looks very inviting. I have been eyeing this place for quite some time and finally zeroed in on it tonight for a laid back evening of drinking. They have a very much extended and lucrative happy hour policy that lasts till about 10pm!! You get one drink free with every drink you order (except for pitchers and daught beer towers). The standard measure for liquor is 30ml. The happy hour policy makes this place really affordable alcoholwise.
The decor is fabulous. The downstairs area is a combination of cafe as well as bar as they serve both coffee and alcohol. However, we decided to head for the elevator to reach the first floor pub area. This area boasts a very large bar adorned with white formica top and high nar stools. A mix of hugh and low height tables are tastefully arranged around the pub which is pretty spacious. The pillars and walls are wood paneled and you can discern that the theme is RocknRoll. Framed Newspaper cuttings, Vinyl records, several guitars, record covers act as wall adornments. An eclectic mix of music is being played from very good quality speakers. A very large screen lcd/led tv covers one wall at the far end of the floor. A portion of the pub has wood panelled floor making up the dance floor. They serve hookah in this floor and the whole place smelled of it which was nice. The smoking area is out in the balcony overlooking the busy sector 5 street.
We headed in mainly to have drinks. So, we ordered drinks with which we had another free. The martini, i was told is Bond Style with both Vodka and Vermouth. It was well mixed i have no complaints there. We ordered the fried Calamari. It waa crumb coated and fried. Served in a newspaper cone, the calamari was accompanied with spicy aioli and small salad portion. Quantity was very small. Hardly fit for one person. The crumb was over fried and overpowering. The few actual Calamari pieces were done well and i did not find them rubbery. We also ordered the Hustle burger with chicken patty. The burger was good and well proportioned for the price. Taste of the patty was also good. 
Service left a lot to be desired. They were not attentive despite this not being a busy evening. Everytime we needed something we had to wait for someone to look our way so we could attract their attention. One other thing i found lacking was a permanent DJ although DJs perform in the weekends.

I had heard a lot about Bakstage but living in the south side never ended up going all the way to sector 5 but last evening we made an effort to try out this place. As we entered it just seemed perfect and was excited how the evening would unfold. We started off with a pitcher of long island ice tea which was worth every penny. For starters since i am a vegetarian i ordered safe with jalapeno cheese sticks and chilly chicken for the others. I was highly dissapointed with the jalapeno sticks and the chilly chicken seemed ok nothing great. We were still enjoying the feel of the place and good music when a group of 20-25ppl came in and started to demand some yo yo honey music and kept singing and whistling around loud. Apparently they dont have an in house DJ monday-thursday and then all sukhbir and sangeet type item songs were played to entertain these bunch of ppl ruining our evening which we were enjoying. For the mains we ordered cottage cheese steak with jack daniels bbq sauce and half roast chicken sizzler with the same sauce. We chose to select the mash potatoes over the rice and were hugely upset as the mash potato was stale and stinky. The staff immediately changed both without any problem which was nice of them and later we were served with a fresh one which was indeed very yummy. Overall the sizzler was just boiled chicken with the sauce on top and so was the paneer. Bakstage tries to reflect itself as a "british" pub with all the famous elvis, jim morrison and putting up these wall hangings which does make it look and feel like one but then you play hindi music (which we love but not in a pub like this and in our sangeet parties)and ruin the evening of others is not acceptable. Im sure if a group of 20 goes to Irish house and demand changing the music they would not oblige them by playing their choice of songs they would have been shown the door. So if you live in town/south side i would suggest giving¬† this a miss and stick to places this side.

Went to the bakstage lounge with my cousins had a nice experience!! Hookah is really nice. The menu does not have much variety so here you can just chill for sometime but cant have a proper meal. We had ordered for chilli paneer which was good and very tasty, very apt to its name.

Wow Ambiance.. but thumbs down for the drink limitation, I ordered for BP and Teachers but they did not have stock for the mentioned ones had to drink VAT69 still they have happy hours to compensate on this ... 1 drinks free with 1. Hookah was good as other places, but the music selection made it different than¬† the other places. Go for the authentic chilli chicken, always best with hookah and your choice of drinks. If you want to have blissful evening always order boneless chicken or mutton dishes, never chicken wings and all because more than fleshy meat you will be busy with the bones. Hookah was definitely good. Always reserve table because it becomes crowded after 8 PM on Sunday. A bit pricey but would definitely visit it twice.

Backstage being one of d finest pubs in Saltlake attracts a lot many people.The interiors are done quite well with seaters as well as bar stools.
Tha ambience is quite nice with arrangements of hookah at one side.

Three of us dropped n one evening n we were welcomed by happy hours. What follwed were lot s of lip smacking starters liked herbed prawns,chicken popcorn and tandoori chickn wings with a flow of drinks.

The place is a little higher on d price but the total experience is worth it.The service boys are polite and effecient.

I visited Backstage with a lot of expectations after being told that this is THE place to be at Sector V. The first impression was good right from the ground floor ambiance to the first floor lounge decor. Their overall pub/lounge theme is quite interesting with humorous quotes and quirky images all over. It is more on the Irish end with a hint of retro feel. But all this failed to impress me much as I always look for an overall positive experience when I visit any place.¬†
To begin with, the service was pathetic. The waiters moved around the place all confused and lost. They had to be called repeatedly to come and take the orders. We had to wait for about 15 minutes before our first order was even taken and another 15- 20 minutes for the starters to arrive. 

The menu, food, staff and lastly the overall service of the joint are the major reasons why I would not like to visit it again. The biggest disappointment was the food, be it their finger food or the main course. Both were absolutely pathetic. The food was served cold and half cooked even after checking with them a second time. 

The only thing eatable/drinkable to us were the alcohol ordered and the nuts accompanying it. I would give it a 1.5 only and only for its ambiance, decor and space.

P:S- We again waited for another 10-15 minutes for our bill to arrive. :)

It was a spontaneous team party which we had at Backstage one fine evening.Being only 5 minutes away from our office,it was an easy pick for a quick bite after work and relax with colleagues.
The ground floor boasts of an elegant cafe kind of an restaurant.The real story begins when you take the elevator and reach the first floor.
Dark 'rock' decor will invade you along with some 90's English music.I was very happy to hear some Dylan,Marley and Brian Adams.Britney and Kesha couldn't keep us seated for long though :-D We had to scream over the music to make ourselves audible and one of us commented "People come here so that they don't have to talk while eating.."
Oh!I almost forgot to write about one particular waiter who was running about, dancing to the music and taking orders.It was hilarious and added to the homely feel of the place.We had ordered "Chicken Cheese Kebabs" and "Lamb Suvlaki". The chicken was tasty and fresh while the lamb was tender and juicy.The salad served along with it was very good too. But the lamb was not "spicy" as promised by the running waiter!! The cranberry juice was good enough to wash away the kebabs with.Overall the experience was a positive one and I am definitley going back there.

Misbehaving staff members and bad service.
This was a horrible experience in Backstage.
Me and my friends went to bakstage last night and exprience was very very disappointing. We were around 10 friends (6 girls and 4 boys). Dance floor is quite limited to dance, Music was average. We had ordered food and staff member served us a different food item !!
Bouncer started misbehaving when girls had just left the floor. After that I tried to complain,¬† these misbehaving incident to his senior , but they also di not listen to our words. After some time, all staff members and bouncer start the pushing and getting physical with us, no one tried to listen to the actual facts. 
Food was OK , service was terrible and staff behaviour is one of the worst ever I have experienced. In future ,¬† I will never ever go in Backsatge.¬† We also considered , complaining to police , but as mentioned below in one of the reviews that complaining to police did not help at all. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 
I will not recommend this to anyone and especiallyto people who are not going as couples.

I went out there once after a hectic day at the office with my colleagues. The place is no doubt good. We went upstairs in the lounge area and it was quite spaceous. The price is not much keeping in mind the fact that there is some offers or other everyday. The draught beer they serve is hardly available anywhere else in Kolkata and it is quite cheap as well. However the music in the lounge area is much loud and at times it becomes difficult to talk to the person sitting beside you. So, we preferred to enjoy our drinks outside in the open area. This place, in short, is perfect if you are looking to hang out with friends.

When anyone visits a resturant the two very basic things they look for are decent food and decent service. I will say the food out here is decent but they make a mockery of the word service. For example I was there with a few friends on Sunday where a waiter called Amit took our food order. We were kind of hard pressed for time so we just ordered two plates of pork chops. I personally insisted that they get the food a little fast and tat Amit fellow told me it will take 20 minutes. Half an hour on they tell me they had forgotten to book the order. Well 5 cities and 15 years of eating out,the first time such a thing has happened to me. Worse still the management was nonchalant about it. As long as such management and waiters like Amit exist all the hard work put in at the kitchen and the bar will all go to waste. I advice you all please make sure you cross check your order every ten minutes if on a rainy day you have the misfortune of spending your hard earned money at this place. It is disgusting.

I spent the most disheartening and disturbing evening of my life at Bakstage,where I've been a regular..¬†I guess you guys already have a nice review from me.¬†I even decided not to give you a bad review when your food gave me food poisoning and I was knocked out for a week.¬†

But today's incident has given me a life long impression of all of you and Kolkata, the city as a whole.

No security for women, Horribly misbehaved and ill groomed staff. Extremely discourteous, unsafe to be around and highly irresponsible. Prashant, the chef, in particular was the biggest disappointment.
I've informed the cops, but¬†I would like to talk to someone senior. I was not given the contact number of the concerned person even when I came down to tears.

Went there on 13.12.15 night around 30 people. We had a private birthday party and had booked a separate area inside. The starters were served cold, main course was just ok and nothing extraordinary. Service was ok. The dj had not come to the venue even past midnight... We were misrepresented while booking that the dj plays daily.  The person behind the console, probably the Manager (in blue shirt wearing specs) was playing utter rubbish and spoiled the party mood. To add to this he did not play any requested songs, very rude and unprofessional. Haven't seen somebody lacking basic courtesy but this person. A bouncer was stationed near the 'dj'  manager who was literally pushing the patrons away from reaching him and requesting songs... Reasons best known to the manager.... A bad experience overall... We have previously dined there couple of times and had pathetic experiences then too... The people don't seem to be learning at this place.

I don't know why I never dropped in before. It's right in middle of sector 5. The ground floor cafe cum restaurant is nice. Quiet ambiance with quality food. The quantity justifies the price. The decor is classy and crowd is good. But what blew my mind was their 1st floor lounge. What an amazing retro rock decor n excellent lighting and ambiance. They have specials everyday ... like i remember thursday was the Istanbul night n wednesday is the WOW --WOmen on WIne day... excellent offers. Hookah, drinks, good food n great music. I am a fan of their playlist...¬†
Among food their spaghetti carbonara is my favoruite. Lasagne with roasted chicken is amazing but is much more for one. Their coffee n draught beer is also good. I had some amazing time there and hope u visit more. Its excellent for an unwinding evening after a hard days work at office. For people who works in sec 5 , must try guys !! must!

I have visited this place 3 4 times. Ambience is at its best. The crowd was always decent and classy. Food and beverages are deliciously superb. I'd have rated it 5 but the information and services provided are not enough. There's no source you can know that which night is for couple only for dance floor or you have to book your seat before hand on some days, the managers are rude sometimes, pool table packages are not worth money, they even don't have snooker balls. Please beware of Valets they'll steal whatever they could from your car.

May i submit a review for Bakstage Pub. This Pub surpasses any other in Calcutta. The quality of food and service clearly is being driven-up passionately and professionally by an efficient management team. I went there on a Saturday night to celebrate my best friend's birthday. We had a reservation for the evening and was greeted warmly at the entrance. As the lift opens  on the first floor you are hit by the foot tapping music and would want to hit the dance floor immediately. The manager received us with a smile and escorted us to the best table on the floor, from where you can get an entire view of the place.
Though it was a busy Saturday night for Bakstage we had really good service. The staff were very attentive and friendly and it was gracious of the owner to come and check on us. The DJ played some amazing mix of music and we totally lost track of time. The food was awesome and drinks were on happy hours till the very end which made all my friends extra happy! The decor was v retro and i simply loved the pop print bar stools. We even got a complimentary chilled champagne. The crowd was good the music was rocking and the entire atmosphere was simply electric.
I don't know of any other place where the owner takes care of you personally . Thank you Sudhir Ahuja for a very special evening.
Would recommend Bakstage sec V Saltlake, to every single one of you who wants to really have a blast on a Saturday night out.

A very disappointing experience. We saw zomato reviews and came all the way from ballygunge on a sat night to check this place out. First of all the lower section has very limited seating. There was no space. We just kept standing around waiting and noone came up to us to enquire or ask us to wait. After 5 mins we made our way to the first floor on being told that there was a table for two available. However when we reached upstairs we were seated at the bar. Twenty minutes at the bar and still no one to give us a menu or take our drink orders at the bar. The place is an uneasy mix of a hookah bar a pub and a disco with blaring music... which didnt make sense since most people were busy with their hookahs. We decided to leave but when we came down the manager or someone like a manager apologised and seated us in the lower floor which we were ready to do. However we kept standing waiting for a table to get cleared... 5 minutes of waiting to get the table cleared.. another 10 minutes of waiting to get the menu... and then noone came to take our orders for another 10 mins. 50 minutes of a Sat night wasted without so much as a glass of water, forget alcohol.. and we were out. Never again... how do you rate a place which never gave any service to begin with.... A definitive thumbs down. I only rate it one cos there is no zero.

Please don't go by the reviews of this place.. It is one of the most mismanaged restaurant/pub/night club, I have ever come across. They have no sense of responsibility. I had booked this place to throw a party for 30 ppl, all negotiations were done with the manager and everythin was fixed.. Just 2 days before my party, I went to backstage to pay advance n try few starters, but the manager apparently had fallen sick, hence he passed on the details to his asst manager, who in turn disagreed to everything that was in my package. The manager switched off his phone n stopped taking my calls. Hence when I contacted the owner, he said he would sort out everythin the next day.. Now only one day left to my party, the owner said the manager will call me n sort everythin out. After waiting for the managers call for a few hours, I called him and to my horror i was informed that he had quit few days ago.. Does the owner doesn't know if his manager works for him or not? Is he so oblivious towards his business? 
Never ever go to this joint!

Probably one of those places Calcutta desperately needed. It has a nice spread across the ground floor and the first where you could go out for a date or chill and have lunch or dinner or if you're in a celebratory mood you could hop in the lift and go to the second level where there's a pub with a pool table and a small dancing area. They do have a good collection of rock music that keeps on playing all the time but as the night gets darker the commercial numbers start pouring in. A must visit if you haven't

One of the worst experience ever had in any pub..... A place where staff satisfaction  is more important than guest satisfaction. And the staff are extremely rude..... 8 of us Went on a wednesday.... We ordered a quite a few things including sheesha. It was just awful....all of us individually told the waiter that the sheesha was too tight to smoke, but his reply to all if us was that according to him it was fine.The music was extremely loud. So loud that the waiter literally had to stoop down near our mouth to take the order. On requesting to lower the music a lil bit, the manager replied that" if you want to talk then you should go to a cafe"  hearing this it was not possible to spend even a minute in that place. So.... Requesting everyone who wants to spend some good time with your friends....not a good place to be. Coz as suggested we should go to any 'CAFE'

Avoid if u think its a place to have fun without tags around you. Random private parties restricting access to fun you can have. Staff can be stubborn on even ditching d bill in 2 credit cards. Food about OK. Drinks r not made here so no comments. N dey like water more in der cocktails.
Must go place if u have no other choice

It was Friday night and we wanted to chill out over a few drinks and good food somewhere in Salt Lake area. That is when Backstage came into our mind and we thought of giving it a try. I found the elevator quite interesting with humorous quotes on drinking framed all over and it had already set up an expectation on my mind. Once we entered the place it brought back memories of our Bangalore days when we used go pubbing almost every weekend... something which we miss in Kolkata as there are not many options. This place has the typical Irish feel and is very retro ambiance. The first song i heard on entering was Summer of Sixty Nine by Bryan Adams and that was my Eureka moment!!! Though there was an initial glitch on our order of Draught beer,yet the management was ¬†good enough to give us the required service and discount as per their Happy Hour policy. We ordered for Smoking Hot Wings as starters along with Beer. Later we ordered a Half Roast Chicken with Jack Daniel BBQ Sauce sizzler and i must say it was yummy and filling enough for both of us.¬†
Later the DJ played bollywood music ¬†for sometime and i could see the crowd going crazy and dancing to the Bolly tunes.¬†They have happy hours starting from 12 Noon and has different themes for every day of the week. This is quite an interesting concept as they have offers based on each day of the week.
¬†Overall an awesome place to chill out with friends if you are a rock lover and like pubbing. If you stay this side of town you do not need to go down South or Central Kolkata to enjoy the pub experience which was missing. The location is also great as it is in Sector v and one can end up chilling here after a hard days work. The availability of Hookah adds to their advantage of serving young people who are hooked on to hookah these days. We tried one of the hookah flavours and it was kind of good :) The price range is a bit on the higher side but i guess the happy hour offer balances the act. They also have the advantage of Valet Parking so you do not have to worry about finding your car after getting high here :)

The first time when i and my friend bumped into this pub, we were high..Some party was going on and the ambience looked great. Played rock tracks and then house ones. We had the best time. The party lasted till 3am and we thought we just found a new party destination but the next couple of times when we went, it was dissapointing.¬†The place is big and spacious but lacks the crowd and culture. Well there are reasons.. The price of booze is too high and the food is not that upto the mark.

A fine place, away from the hustle and bustle of the city proper, amidst ¬†the IT hub of Salt Lake, is the Bakstage. A nice ambience best for hanging out with friends.What i love about the place is the option of different seating arrangements(round tables,high bar chairs,sofas,etc) they provide and their attempt to westernize the place.Good music,nice hookah, food was okay although quantity was very less,alcohols are expensive.Service is not up to the standards,, me and my friends ¬†were really pissed off with the indolent waiters.Crowd is good,mostly all IT professionals and office workers.
Overall-

It was just a random visit to BackStage but it was awesome place to spend time with your dear ones.
We had Lamb Suvalki which taste good. Price bit on higher side but not too high.¬†
A good visit i must say..

Suggestion: Having all the different night each day you guys can plan for Karaoke Night which is still missing is Kolkata (as per my best knowledge) :)

Lounge bars/sports bars/pubs shouldn't play loud music. It defeats the very purpose of a lounge where people go to drink and have a conversation.  This pub amongst plenty of other pubs in Kolkata is just another pseudo attempt to bring the pub culture in this city. The reality? overly expensive booze, horrible loud music and mediocre food quality.

It is one of those places where you can have a really really good time with your friends, chill and not have a care in the world. The interior of place is done very beautifully. The posters hung on the wall will immediately catch your attention. The ambiance is excellent. Chicken lovers should try out Half Roast Chicken with Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. The meat was so soft and succulent and the BBQ sauce was to die for. The Happy Hour on alcohol was 1:1 , which made me very happy!¬†
If you want a good place to hang out with friends or a casual date, Backstage would not disappoint you.

!!! THEY CHEAT PEOPLE !!! PLEASE NEVER BOOK A GROUP PARTY/CORPORATE PARTY THERE !!!
Never go there. Even I would never think of going to backstage again. Last week we had a corporate party over there. Food was worst . Even we booked the venue a week before, they were not at all prepared to serve us.¬† Everything was very much highly priced and during initial talk whatever they said nothing taken care at the time of actual occasion. They do some false promise. Specially their manager, is a cheater. He doesn't even know how to behave with customer. Doesn't know basic ethics of speaking. At last, when we asked them for a feedback form, this is firs time I heard that such a PUB doesn't even have a feedback form. Bogus way of misguide us. 

Again I would request to everyone, please don't think of going there neither with family nor with a group/corporate event. Instead of wasting your money there, donate that to any charity or to poor people , that will make both happy. 

Below is my review out of 10.

Food : 1/10
Service: 0/10
Drinks: 1/10
Parking : NO

To be precise my rating would be 3.5, but 0.5 goes for their little place outside fancily customised  and allows a lovely smoking experience holding your drink. This place is basically inspired by the pub culture with lovely cozy interiors and old school music. The food tastes good but expensive and less in quantity compared to the price. The happy hour offers 1:1 free drinks, but you will enjoy the location and a lovely drive to rajarhat nearby after you get high. Good place to scoop in once in a month

Simply unprofessional attendants all over. Ambience is good. Food sucks drinks are just not tolerable, everyone there seems to just not be in the mood to attend you, it's like a favour they're doing to you, they're charging you for non sense they don't care about the food or the drinks. This is the first time I am rating any restaurant on zomato and here I am don't ever step into this illogical place.

A Beer lovers den, a place like Bakstage was much needed in the city of Kolkata- your all - in - one and yet not - so - pricy hangout! The pizza could have been better. Shisha was awesome, and so was the service- the stand is friendly and helpful. I had ordered a Peach Slush which was nothing like a slush, but tasted decent.. Mocktails could be better. Thumbs up to the ambience!!!

Went there last Saturday. The ambience is nice. Loved the retro music they played. Service is very very very slow. We had to wait for over an hour for our thin crust margarita pizza, and had to keep reminding the waiters to bring ice and cola for our drinks. The waiters otherwise are very friendly and fulfil whatever you request. Its great if u want to chill for a long period of time and not worry about getting the food on time. Hukka was brilliant, lasted for over 4 hrs without the flavour getting burnt.

It was my first visit to backstage discoth√®que. The ambience was good and I enjoyed the place a lot. However, got a rude shock when the bill arrived. I was billed for nearly double the beer I had consumed. Despite all my clarification the manager refused to budge and I had to cough up the entire billed amount. They are simply cheating their clients thinking that the latter would be too drunk to notice the over billing. It is high time the management mends their ways as they will surely be in trouble sooner or later.

This retro pub has been creating a lot of buzz but I couldn't see what the fuss was all about. Sure they have put in a lot of effort to stay true to the theme. Sure it‚Äôs a great place to catch up with friends over drinks and hookah. And sure their posters are witty and hilarious (special mention about the one outside the washrooms which says men are to the left cause women are always right). But this place comes with a lot of cons as well. There is nothing remarkable about their food. The air ducts running along the ceiling are an eye sore. And it‚Äôs hard to catch the attention of the staff.

 This place may actually surprise you if you walk in without any prejudices. But if you go in with certain expectations (given all the hype), it may not live up to all of them.

By far the best place in sector 5, Backstage is way above the league. I visited on a saturday afternoon post work and went to the lounge bar. The ground floor was brilliant with its cafe setup, and the interiors were very classy and appealing. The lounge also has great interiors and lovely art on its walls. The outdoor seating with smoking and a pool table along with the huge screen and kickass acoustics complimented the long bar. The colors that make up the interiors are also super and the art signage outside the washrooms also impressed me. A lot of people where smoking hookahs but we preferred the happy hour 2+1 with the beers and i tried the jumbo burger. the food was well presented and great on taste and quality. Backstage is brilliant and must visit.

Bakstage has filled that void of a great Bar with good music, great food and drinks in Calcutta. I have been a regular at Bakstage since almost inception and just love going back again and again. First the choice of music is a mix of 60s, 70s 80s and 90s rock and roll which is perfect to my liking. (BTW, if its too loud, you're too old!!) Second, the finger licking food. My personal favorite are the nazzas, a Naan based pizza which I order everytime. My wife had a fish rolled into a banana leaf thingy (cant remember the name) and she loved that. To top it all the drinks.Good selection of beers and a long list of Whiskeys, Vodkas, Mocktails etc etc. The decor of the place takes you back in the golden age of rock and roll; very tastefully done. All this is mixed with all the sports fun all round the year. Want to watch any India-Pakistan cricket clash or Brazil-Argentina football match on big screen, this is the place to be. Two thumbs UP to Bakstage!!!

One of the best place to chill with friends . Plus u get good drink good food and good shisha all in one place and they have a separate smoking zone as well which is really nice . The ambience is good much betta than any other place in salt lake . 
Music sometimes can be lil boring if u are not into rock music . But its soothing .
Highly recommended in foods Paneer Tikka Nazza ,  Bawli Handi , Biryani , Spaghetti with Meatballs, Pizza is nice thin crust and in cocktail Cosmopolitan , mocktail lychee nutini is really yum and virgin mojito with too many mint leaves not recommended . 
1:1 offer is good stuff . 
Its not pocket friendly but ya its worth d money u pay . 
Sometimes the staff is bit slow so i would rate it 4.5.

The best place in town for awesome food and "genuine" drinks. The music is simply rocking. The DJs are just too good with their retro collection, just perfect for a retro music addict like me. The music these guys play just take me back in time! A person who does not go beyond Park Street for his dinners, driving all the way to Sector-V for that perfect night out is rewarding enough. Hats off to my friend Sudhir for giving Bakstage to this city. One request..... Open another one much closer...!

Sector 5 has become another hub for restaurants. New restaurants opening up everyday with the increasing number of people.
Amongst all, one of the restaurants excellent for casual dating or hanging around with friends is Backstage. The ambience is amazing. I went with my boyfriend for one of our nice evenings together where in a less crowded place, but was surprised by what backstage had offered me. We ordered Pizza, Pasta in white sauce, truffle pastry and blueberry cheesecake. We also ordered cocktails, Long Island Ice Tea and Cranberry Vodka. I found it a bit overpriced.
Cost for 2 in my case: 1200 approx (without alcohol), 1800 approx (with alcohol).

Amazing place to be at...had thrown my bday party there n being a vegetarian n non drinker the rock pub customised things for me which was something impossible at any other pub in kol..... Food, music, ambience n the service everything made my party happening.....The only place which also took my order of bulk chocs n cake n gave me the delivery in just few hours at reasonable rates..... The only place that always keep having diffrent kinds of events... So I simply recommend BAKSTAGE to all.... Just be there with or without any occasion !!

Disgusting...that's the first appropriate adjective for this place....first of all, let me tell you this place is not at all cool...no matter the fact that they have removed 'C' (for reasons best known to them)..
I will let you know the reasons for the opinion that I hold and am sure you will definitely agree if authenticity, good taste, amicable and courteous service is what you look for....
We went there (2 couples) on a Sunday evening. The place was quite empty, though it didn't matter to us. 

Ambience and Service Time -
First, of all after all the hype about the ambience being cool, cult and hippy.....it isn't so...just hanging few records on the wall, photos of Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Pink Flloyd, or even them being served below your plates doesn't make it a place of Cultural Revolution...counterfeit...sham...they were playing songs of aqua, backstreet boys and other similar bands,, to say the least...the seating arrangement was quite ordinary...the place where we were sitting had blowers right on our head, making it feel like Mt Kailasha..we requested the staff thrice to reduce the blower speed but to no avail...the people serving were clueless...

Food Quality and VFM -
We ordered for assorted bruschetta, falafel, au gratin nachos wackos veg and a veg mezze platter. Bruschetta was very ordinary to taste, falafel again was very ordinary with the yoghurt dip being smelly....and then to add to it the au gratin nachos-the worst of all...biggest SHAM....they were ITC Bingo Chips...which were served....we felt really cheated to say the least...bruschetta was for Rs 195, falafel for RS 195 and nachos for Rs 175...all not worth it.....the veg mezze platter was the only saving grace wherein we managed to provide some solace to our starved souls...
For drinks, we ordered for 2 fresh virgin Mojito and 2 fresh lime soda....Mojito was absolutely hopeless...these ppl don't know what Mojito....stuffed with Only ice and mint leaves...hardly any soda and no citric component @ Rs 175.....uhh...
We also ordered for a Hookah which was decent and smoke helped to vent out some disappointment.@ Rs 350

FYI...they have a service charge of 10%.....(to add to your woes)......where's the Service???

Earnest Suggestion to AVOID...!!!

Visited once again with colleagues on an evening. The most happening place in the evening for Sector V. Crowd is upmarket. Service was prompt but exorbitant pricing was a huge let down. Nice stock of international brands. Rating update to 3.5.
---------------------

Visited last Sunday lazy afternoon before matinee show. The pub claims to open from 12 noon. We were there around 12.30pm and it was like a dead town. No surprises ofcourse as this expected at that hours but I was utterly disappointed to see that sweepers were cleaning floors. They were surprised to see guests and were not at all prepared to serve us.
Ambiance was dark which goes with the mood and excellent acoustics. Huge projector display is there for special cricket and football events. One will also have option for private dining for a group against minimum billing of INR 20-25K. Staff are courteous.
They have limited drinks option and too very costly which is obvious they have buy 1 get 1 offer almost all day. We requested for mocktail menu and guess what they don‚Äôt have any mocktail menu but they will prepare it for you what you prefer. Any mocktail will be INR 175 + tax.
Post going through menu we finally decided to stick to class fish and chips. Dish was served after 25 minutes but server set an expectation that they were running late. 
Presentation is good and fish quality was fresh too. However the coating is too dark and thick. It has to be beer battered which should be flaky and light. They do have beer battered option for fish finger.
Again billing was pathetic too. They don‚Äôt have option for guests to pay bill using their card at desk. One has to follow servers downstairs to give PIN and top of that servers don‚Äôt know how to use card. Wake up management technology has advanced a lot since last time you checked.
To me its mostly a hype now at Sector V area; still if you prefer recommendation to go only during peak hours with a group to enjoy to the fullest.

We watched the IPL finals here. They had a very good offer on starters (unlimited, including pizza and shots) and happy hours for drinks. Super ambience and decor and the quality of the starters was also excellent viz the chicken wings and fish fries. The pizzas were also super with thin and crisp crust. Alcohol selection is good but stock perhaps limited. Service can be slightly better though.

I have been going to Bakstage since four consecutive Saturdays now, and let me tell you all, that I have never been disappointed.Infact the Istanbul night on 17th May was surely a step ahead for Kolkata's night life !  It surely is the new identity of Kolkata !! Worth for money, drinks for thirst and food for hunger, Bakstage aces in all the departments. 
The long happy hours (1 : 1) surely motivates all the party goers..... Thankfully, i have never seen a bad crowd here and i hope this is maintained.. In my heart and mind I am sure that Bakstage has a woooooping future !! Wish Sudhir & team all the very best for the future ! Cheers !!!

Great music, good ambience...crowd has picked up so not easy to get a vacant table on Fridays now. Slightly expensive but one on one free on drinks till 10pm takes care of it. Price for a couple of starters, a mutton kebab and great juicy pork rib chops along with 3 Coronas and 2 Hookas came@ around 1500 per person. Great place for IPL. Definitely coming back.

Post this experience at Bakstage has been very poor. Half frozen fish in Bhetki steak, diluted drinks and fizzless mixers. All offers gone.

This place has become a hangout joint for us for watching IPL matches . I would love to come back again for any cricket/football match and have a few drinks . The option of Hookah and the loud music (rock and club) makes this a complete package .

But wait , the best part is the Food.The yummy sandwiches and burgers will surely make you want to visit this place again.

Would recommend this place for top class music , food and ambiance .

This is a very expensive place. i have been there with one one my friend on a Friday  evening. this place is right at the college more crossing and on the first floor.
The his fashioned decor and English old classic songs playing in the background makes it a nice place. It also has a outdoor balcony with seating arrangement if you want to have you drinks in the open air and in peace.

how ever we had Chill Garlic Chicken which was very tasty, also had some breaded golden fried prawns which tasted bald, it had no flavor in it. But later when he complained they change it  and it was nice. it was nice gesture from the Chef who came to our table and asked how we would like it to taste and redone it accordingly. We had hell lot of drinks that day. drinks are really expensive here. 

We paid about rs.4500/- for tow people including drinks. Overall it is good place bit little overpriced.

Had visited Backstage day before yesterday. Its just at the Webel crossing at Sec-5. Had visited the pub at around 8pm in the evening. It was a weekday, hence it was mostly empty and a big screen was playing one of the IPL matches. It was my first visit here, and I must say the moment I entered Backstage I knew my evening would be an awesome one. It has a dark ambiance with not too many lights. You can sit at the bar counter but they only serve snacks there, not main course. So that's why we(2 of us were there) preferred to take a table. They serve hookah too, but we chose to stick to only food and drinks.
While ordering the waiter informed us that "happy hours" for drinks were on till 9.45 pm, not sure about the starting time though. They were giving 1 : 1 on drinks. So we ordered amongst starters Lamb Suvlaki & Panko Crusted Chicken Tenders with Ranch Dressing. In main course we went for Half Roast Chicken with Jack Daniel's BBQ Sauce(sizzler). Amongst drinks we took Long Island Iced Tea, Mojito and Shooter. Lastly we finished with Chocolate Brownie with Ice-Cream which was just out of the world. Mojito tasted awesome and the sizzler was good too. Our bill total came down to just 2887. I mean with 2 startes, 1 main course, 3 drinks, and 1 desert, I felt 2887 was too cheap considering the place to be so cool. I guess the HAPPY HOURS helped us ;) Also the staff were cordial and helpful. Would definitely visit again.

This is by far the coolest "get drinks with friends" place I have been to in the 'new' city of joy, or Salt Lake city, per se. Inspired from Hard Rock Cafe, the place reeks of pop and funk culture, with Bob Marley posters, retro cushions and a wall art of LPs. 
The very entry is quite jazzy, with a cocky poster in the elevator, where the authority demanded that since all its stewards were married, they knew very well how to take orders. Being a part of a bachelorette party, it immediately won our hearts, and boy didn't the stewards live up to their claims!
With the right balance of push-sale and extreme care of our demands, topped with happy hours till 10pm, summery fresh sugarcane mogito cocktails, and of course delectable finger foods, the place was a win-win for all kinds of visitors. Whether you want to dance with your girlfriends, puff a hookah with a colleague, sip a cocktail on a date, or plain have a dinner in style- Bakstage offers everything!
The pocket would have pinched a bit too much, but the very happy hours steal the show... and makes us yearn for going back again and again! 
So, if in Sector V, go there without fail! :)

Backstage is the new happening place in town. It's really classy and very pleasing to the eye. The ambiance of the lounge is different from the coffee shop outside but you can choose to be both on the inside and the outside as they serve food hookah and drinks at both places.
I loved the blues and jazz music that they keep playing when you are there. The happy hours on the hookah is brilliant for its price as you get two hookahs for the same price. The prices for the food and drinks are a bit steep but if you are okay with spending extra for a good evening, then it is a good place to be in. I had ordered the pan rasna and grape hookah, it was really good. I also tried the Classic BMT sandwich and i must say it tasted as good as it looked when it first reached my table. Also the long island iced tea and the onion rings are a must if you're visiting. I'm a huge fan of those two things at backstage.
Over all., try out this place as i really liked it and would love to go back again soon :)

NOT Being a rock n roll lover to say the least  ,THIS place made me fall in love with rock music !!  staying in kolkata ,you have a very few options when it comes to good lounges & pubs . Being a hardcore believer in ambiance being factor no 1 when it comes to choosing a good dine- out venue , i would rate BAKSTAGE as no 1 . Had gone there with a close friend on a saturday night & thought of giving the regular night clubs a miss.Must say it was a super decision as this place beats all the leading clubs in the city in terms of ambiance & vibe . The place is huge and as you enter, you are greeted by ever so courteous waiters.The staff is very friendly and will do their best to make you feel at home. We ordered paneer tikka & Dal makhani NAZZAS & ooolala there isnt any place in the city which offers this ! being a non alcohol person decided to team up with breezers & we got to know that happy hours was on we can have 2 at the price of one ,now this was a happy surprise because there was no publicity of the same at the outlet .This is what i call classy publicity - no talk only walk .  But apart from the good service and food, the thing that I loved most about this place is the music. Being a sat night the DJ new the vibe well & started with some awesome rock & roll which i fell in love with because of the smooth selection of tracks,later escalated to romantic & further Bollywood dance numbers.We spotted mostly everybody hitting the dance floor but what i observed for the first time was that stags were not allowed to dance alone without the ladies. kudos for this as this  will encourage family & couples & avoid any kind of unwanted crowd ! 
It was one of those perfect Saturday nights!  keep it up team BAKSTAGE ! you gonna rock a long way
Definitely recommended for all

Very good place. Dark and nice. Good decor (with Kurt Cobain and Jimmy Hendrix being allotted bathroom locations :P). I really enjoyed the Carlsberg and then KF Draft pitchers with a big group. However, what I really enjoyed was the B52 shots. The chicken kebabs that we had for starters were lovely. Moderte in taste was the chicken(pressed like an idli) that had cheese at tis centre.The main course was also nice, especially the Chicken Stake which was really juicy. The Paratha and Gosht was also very good. The only DOWNSIDE was the extremely loud music. My cousin asked the waiter to turn the volume down and he replied that it was a pub (to someone whose band regularly performs in the city's best pubs). Other than the extremely loud music, I found the place to be a hit!

Being close to my office, I keep visiting this place quite often. Although it's a nice place for the crowd that you generally get at Sector-V, there are serious issues with their service. Either they are short-staffed to handle the crowd when at full capacity, or the people aren't trained enough to handle the situation. More than once, they have forgotten to deliver after taking the order, while delay in service is quite regular.

The only thing going for this place is that it currently has no competition in the area! However, I will definitely not recommend this place!

Bakstage is in Back to the Desi Cafe. Its on the first floor, whereas the food joint in on the ground floor.
Bakstage is pretty quirky too. (Even the cushions are)
 There is a wall with guitars arranged on them. Pretty funky. The bar is quite BIG. 
The music is good too. I mean when I was chilling, the music was Smoke on the water by Deep Purple. So, you get the drift right? :P
Haha.

So, my friend and I were chilling with two Budweiser pints and chatting away to glory.
The pub is pretty cool and I must admit, it has a very snazzy feel.
Prices are not very high, again not quite moderate either. Its a two-a-two situation.
Bakstage is good for jam sessions and chilling out with a big bunch of friends over some real good music.
In short, a good place to be. The place has a rock decor and will catch the attention of youngsters mostly. (Opinions vary)

It has a good vibe, I do not know about the food so will not comment. A beer or two and good music keeps it rolling.
Shall be back for more.

Cheers! :)

Ambiance was good but the food was a real disappointment. Ordered the half roasted chicken and the taste was really not up o the mark. More over no one served water or even salt and pepper. Every time we had to ask for this and then wait for 5 minutes and then they would come and give, although there were hardly 5-4 tables booked during our stay.
More over they take an extra 10% as service charge other than the normal VAT(14.5%) and Service Tax(4.94%).
The drinks are also a bit pricey. There are many other options where they maintain the same ambiance and service and facilities and ye charge much much less. By 'much much' I really mean a lot of difference.

The good bits:
Good decor. Good music. Bright and sunny in the ground floor and mezannine.


Now the not so good bits:
Extremely slow service and very average food. We were 6 of us and ordered pork chops to be told that only 2 portions are available.  When we asked for beef tenderloin that also met with the same response. So we ordered 2 pork chops, 2 beef tenderloins and 2 roast lambs. 

Took 1 hour to serve the order. Food was not hot enough.  Plating was good. Looked appetising. 

However, the quality of the meat was another story. Instead of a knife they could given a chainsaw! Have never had meat that was so tough. Lamb, pork, beef - it was the same story. 

This is at best a sandwich and burger place. 

Best avoided on work days when you are in a hurry.

Being a rock n roll lover, staying in salt lake, you have a very few options. I read the reviews about this place and decided to give it a visit and boy, was that a good decision! The place is huge and as you enter, you are greeted by ever so courteous waiters. I went there on a friday night and they had an offer of unlimited beer and snacks for Rs. 799 plus taxes which seemed pretty awesome. The staff is very friendly and will do their best to make you feel at home. Soon after I placed my order, I was greeted with the non veg platter which consisted if two varieties of chicken and two varieties of fish. Needless to say, it was pretty good. But apart from the good service and food, the thing that I loved most about this place is the music. They played Dire straits, Metallica, Guns n roses,  Abba, Boney M and other rock n retro numbers. The DJ was very friendly and played a lot of my requests. Must say, one of the best pubs in Salt lake, in fact, one of the very good upcoming pubs in Kolkata!
Definitely recommended.

Went there with friends because many said its awesome and for kolkata to have something like this was actually awesome. The walls covered with vinyls, collection of best cassettes by famous singers, guitars and a nice frosted glass with band names at the entrance rendered the place a great feel. Specially loved the digital print chairs and the table mats with quotes from famous bands. The experimental ambience helps break away from the usual monotony of Kolkata pubs.
The food and drinks were not that great though. We ordered cheese kurkure which was good but the pizza was very okaish in standard. We ordered thick shakes which turned out to be not thick and very sweet. The hookah turned out to be good though. Our overall bill was 1500 which was a bit too high for the food they served wasn't up to the mark. 
The service was also nothing amazing and the waiters seemed pretty lost and barely knew the names of the bands they had all around the place. And they had only a few songs(precisely "2 cds") to play which was ironical considering the place being surrounded with musical theme!! -.-

Personal rating:
Ambience- 5/5
Quality- 4/5
Taste-3 /5
Experience- great for having loads of fun but not best place to head to if u just wanna eat!!

HAPPY HOGGING! :D

In recent days this place has gained a reputation for being too loud and overpriced, and not just that the people here are uncouth. The servers really don't care if you got your food or if your drink was bad. They know they will  get the service charge in the end so they don't care if your barbecue wings were burnt. Terrible!!!

was at bakstage with my family on 11th oct. happened to my birthday.  couldnt find accommodation in the mains. wanted to b filled with pub surrondings. great time. loud music good ambience. youngsters in a freak out mood. puffing the hookha. gave me a nostalgic feelings. the food was simply good and feeling. courteous stewards. aleays on the run. foot tapping music. started shaking my body so also my wife while staying put in our chairs. lets ignore the price tag. a place like bakstage keeping their price a little high is understandable. lets not crib. will like tio another time. the owners who were also partying harf. their excellent gesture whn they knew its my birthday in a jiffy they organised a cake candle I blew it and then happy birthday to you and a photograph session. they were simply grt. spontaneous reaction. god bless them for their  smiles and prosperity. a must for young , middle aged and a little old people.

Went to Backstage after seeing the rating @Zomato. The total experience was not at all satisfactory. Its written that Backstage has a full bar but the fact is  they don't have liquor license for all days (Courtesy: The waiter serving us). The foods are highly overpriced and was average in taste. Not a single customer was there except our group. The ambiance as well as the location is very good. Expected a better experience.

Bakstage is the dark horse of Sector-5 , a must visit if you are looking for something less crowded than Opium and other regular bars flocked by the Junta.The setting is perfect , very well laid out , good service, a grand projector screen, sexed out rock music,good service and a variety of liquor probably other places in Kolkata won't have.But the catch is the pricing, it is several notches above other pubs in and around the area but spending here once in a while will get you the GOOD FEEL.

Hi all,

Some days ago I had been to Bakstage. I really felt that my decision to go there was good as the food was fabulous. We ordered Mezza platter and the taste was great and aromatic. Prices are little high but according to ambiance and profile of the restaurant, they seems reasonable. Service staff was very client friendly. Chef Prashant is understanding & helpful, who understand our needs & requirements for food. As I am very much specific about my food whatever I intake like calorie  conscious. My friend also ordered Hookah. For her it was a great experience. The theme music "Retro/Rock" are appreciable, it felt like we were sitting in a pub as good as a family restaurant. I would love to go again & again till they maintain these features of the restaurant. They really take care of their guests as we take care of our guests at home...
So best of luck for Backstage staff.. and KEEP IT UP...

Bakstage incited a very rocking vibe within me when I first decided to try out the self proclaimed Rock Pub from Sec V Salt Lake. And to be honest, it didn't disappoint although there weren't live performances at the pub/cafe. The location is of course Bang On!..There's valet parking which is so desirable (thumbs up). There is a burst in energy as you get off at the floor where the cafe is. The music is so powerful that even the ignorant will humm along.
Coming to the food, the pasta was really good (better than I have tasted at most Italian joints). The burger is tempting. The service is quick and efficient. The prices are on the higher side but its ok if they maintain their quality of music and food. The Ambiance is really nice, the gentry was good. They could introduce some variety in the non-alcoholic beverages section. I am anyways definitely visiting again. 4 Stars for now.

Had the potential but not utilising. Too bright for a pub. No dance floor. Limited veg starters. Waiters are untrained and not courteous. My request for complimentary peanuts was refused since I was required to pay for it. When I am paying a bill of 2500.+ I expect it. With such stiff and rigid management I am not going back.

I went to Bakstage, primarily because I was recommended by a friend to try its burger - and the experience was pretty much average. The burger, for starters, was above average, yet fell notches below being good. The triple layered burger made absolutely no sense, for it could have looked and tasted much better without those extra layers of melted cheese... The coffee, however, was well brewed and the lemonade well done. The other friends who had their chicken wrap (don't really remember the name) kind of liked it - so, good marks for the non-veg! Besides, the ambiance was good, with appropriate rock cafe settings, including the music, seating and the bar... The prices are a bit too high, though - a major drawback herein. The staff was pretty okay, they still need a lot of training in lounge skills, because a place such as this needs really good servers who can augment the whole feel to this otherwise good place. 

Overall, above average - with a lot of scope for improvement.

A Terrific Ambience and an Equally Amazing Service to back it up.¬†
Regarding the food, Its been ages since I have eaten such Delicacies. Especially the Chinese & Paneer Dishes were mouthwatering...
Being a Vegetarian, It sometimes is difficult for me to get good food at restaurant and pubs...But not so at Bakstage...Having an awesomely made cocktail at the Bar where in you don't have to be pushed to get ur drink is such a woww feeling... 
To all my friends if you can't find me on weekends then I m definitely having fun 'BAKSTAGE' !!!

GOOD : 
 1. AMBIENCE - SPACIOUS, RIGHTLY LIT , QUALITY OF MUSIC , DECOR , CLEANLINESS
 2. FOOD TASTE - SAUCES WERE HEAVENLY , KEBABS VERY WELL DONE 

BAD
 1. SERVICE - POLITE BUT UNTRAINED WAITERS WITH VERY LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF MENU OR FOOD. 45 MINS TO DELIVER HOOKAH AFTER MANAGER'S ATTENTION TO CANCEL ORDER, NO APOLOGIES , FORGET ADJUSTMENTS
 2. EXTREMELY PRICEY - AT THAT PRICE I'D PREFER TO GO FOR A BUFFET AT ITC SONAR AND HAVE A FULL MEAL WITH 20 VARIETIES THAN 5 PIECES OF KEBAB AT RS.600 AND 5 PIECES OF 'BAGDA' GRILLED PRAWN ( SEEMED STEAMED THO) FOR ANOTHER 700 ODD BUCKS
3. UNAVAILABLE MENU ITEMS 

DID I HAVE FUN - YEAH , 4 BUDDIES CONNECTING AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OVER SCOTCH , HOOKAH AND KEBABS OUGHT TO BE FUN - THERE OR IN LOCAL JOINT 

AM I GOING BACK( STAGE) ? - NO !

Backstage is a well located Pub / Rock Music Restaurant in Salt Lake's business district. By no means is it cheap but then it is very well priced. Cost per head including alcohol is approximately Rs 1500 / head (with tips). The decor is amazing, ambience is very modern and obviously a lot of thought has gone into the interiors and the design. Though the music is a tad loud, one really does not care since all the music is very listenable.  

The dishes are well priced i.e. Rs 350-Rs 600 on an average and all five of us had different items which included, Whole Fish Red Snapper (excellent), Pork Chops (outstanding), Fish and Chips (okay), Fried Prawns (Fantastic) and a Burger which was like any other burger ought to be ! Spotlessly clean interiors and loos, Attentive waiters and stewards (very friendly) and great food all had the ingredients for a great outing. I was disappointed that it was practically empty on a Sunday night - I guess it is more of a lunch-time hangout and I also feel it could do with a dance floor. My Rating is 5 Stars. Go for it ! You will not be disappointed.

Got rather good food at Bakstage, given that it is set in the wilds of Sector 5. The food is expensive, though. The decor is nice and the place very clean. The LP record display is rather good. One hopes, though, that the gramophone displayed might be able to play records instead of remaining a showpiece.

We started off with Roast Chicken, which was arranged for us since the Grilled Pork Chops we wanted weren't available. It was very good. The second item ordered was a Grilled Tenderloin in Red Wine Jus, which was very small, and not particularly well cooked. The sauces accompanying both dishes were very good.

The other two items ordered were the Beach Boys Prawns, which was served with rather iffy-tasting aioli, and the Spiced Risotto with Roasted Vegetables and Ratatouille, which was good. We concluded with Tiramisu (not on the menu), and Chocolate Rum Cake. Both tasted good.

The service was slow, but the waiters were polite and helpful. The chef came over and discussed the order, suggesting items if those we wanted were unavailable. There seemed to be several things not available - maybe that should be remedied. Overall, a good place to drop in for a meal.

i know i rated it at 5, but how can you rate such a place any less than that. One of the only places in terms of a Pub in kolkata that can boast of the kind of spaciousness Bakstage can. 
Imagine walking in to a place with a reallyy looonnggg bar where you don't need to push or be shoved to get your drink and then Sit across a wall adorned with LP records.. Such a pleasure.. it relaxes in measures more than the drink..

The food is excellent and you can keep digging in.. The best part is that unlike some other dimly lit shady joints in the city where you can always find a odd pair of eyes ogling you.. but at this nicley lit place makes you feel so amazing with a great bunch of friends.. rock music in the background and equally good food..

After a visit.. my group of friends say.. on a weekend, if you can't spot us.. we asure you we'll be having a gala time 'Bakstage ' !!!  ;)

Wished to have a couple of drinks with colleagues before heading home and were actually bored withe same old dark shady joints in the vicinity. 
But the someone in office suggested us to head here at Bakstage.... its actually spelt Bakstage .. and its not a spelling mistake or a typo.
The ambience is bright and you get a feel of a rock concert. The cocktails were very interesting with great flavor and accompanied with gourmet starters to the topping. 
Despite their weekend rush i felt we were looked after in every aspect. So head on to Bakstage and you might catch us there.
