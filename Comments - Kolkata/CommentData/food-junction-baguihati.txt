Ordered through swiggy, ended up with Substandard food. 
*Garlic chicken was basically boiled chicken floating in oil and red color(i don't expect proper food color to be used)
*The chowmin was something that you would get from the roadside stalls, only double the price.

Ordered food online. Though it came on time, the food wasn't just up to the quality. Despite mentioning that we would like less oil used in the cooking, it wasn't. The quantity did not justify the pricing. Not really happy.

Tasted their "American Chopsuye" which was ordered via foodpanda. Considering the price, Quality was very average and quantity was less too. It is not logical to rate or give any opinion to a restaurant by tasting only one item. I want to tell a different fact about the restaurant, its about their pricing. In their menu card, the price of american chopsuye is Rs. 155/-, price in zomato is also same. But surprisingly, in foodpanda, the price of the item is Rs. 193/-. Foodpanda is offering 20% off at this restaurant, the price of this dish become Rs. 154.40. So, what is the meaning of this discount offer? Moreover, price of this item is Rs. 170/- in Swiggy. Packing and delivery charges are extra and are not considered in this comparison. Is it justified to state different price of the same item in different places?

I went there yesterday, for dinner with my family (6 hungry souls [Akash Bhattacharya ] ).In zomato it's wrongly listed as seating not available. It's a well furnished restaurant but it's not air conditioned. The menu given here is out dated ,there's a price hike of Rs 5 but what's nice is that the prices are including GST. 
We ordered 3 veg fried rice , 3 chili chicken ,1lemon chicken,1chicken do pyaza, 1veg noodles and 8 rumali rotis.We ordered a hell lot of things but they managed to serve us in 10mins.( The staffs are friendly and they did refill our glass with water a lot of times.)
The veg noodles and veg fried rice both had the authentic taste and were nice , lemon chicken was good too ..but the chili chicken was out of the world with that authentic burnt flavour. Though the chicken do pyaza was nothing extra ordinary . 
The extraordinary point about this place is the price and the amount they serve and the authentic taste of the Chinese cuisine they maintain - on total it's a package ! 
Chili chicken - Rs 130 / per plate ( with lovely 8 boneless pieces of chicken )
Veg Fried rice- Rs 95/plate ( can serve 1.5 hungry souls )
Veg noodles - Rs 70/per plate ( can get 1 hungry soul totally stuffed )
Lemon chicken- Rs 134/per plate ( the salt and sour was perfectly balanced. There were 8 boneeless pieces but the gravy is too less )
Chicken do pyaza- Rs 120/per plate ( 4 pieces but the taste is not up to the point )
Rumali rotis - Rs 5/piece 
Now coming to ambience, you can't expect mood lighting in this place or an extraordinary decor but it's nicely lit and quite pleasant. We were the only ones in that place when we dined in. 
Over all, I loved the place and I wish to visit this place again.
Recommendation - OBVIOUSLY , do visit this place at least once !!

On first time seeing this restaurant, I got happy to see the comments comparing to the price (price was relatively cheap and almost all review were rated 5 stars).
Ordered 3 thalis (2 non veg Chinese and 1 mutton executive). Delivery was good.
But then, seeing the food in plastic trays was disappointing cause it was too small. After opening I was more disappointed.
Although quantity was good but the sides (in my case was chilli chicken and garlic chicken and mutton do pyaza) was very low in quantity. Atlast I even had to eat noodles alone without side. Drumstick was ok. Chilli Chicken was covered in thick battar and very less chicken. Garlic chicken wasn't taste or smell like any garlic and chicken wasn't even at all tender.
There wasn't any roti in Chinese thali yet they provided roti in it but nothing side to eat with.
Noddles and fired rice is like any other street side shop, nothing special. Less stuffings in it.
Quantity was good for me although who eats more might not enough for them.
So thali's review is very bad according to me. Don't know about other dishes.

Don't get taken by the 5 star reviews like me. I don't have a idea how did they got so many 5 star reviews.
Might be fake reviews, with no pictures.

Not to forget, coming to my favourite dish, their chicken dak bangalow was just cooked to perfection. Do check out this place, tummy will surely be happy :D

A perfect takeaway joint. After the usual tiring office returns on weekday evenings/nights, it's nice to order some different food. And the food should sensitise your taste buds. This joint is the perfect example of the saying "looks can be deceptive."
Yes!! This restaurant commits to preserve the old fashioned charm one used to get from our Chinese food. They also have an updated menu. Staffs are courteous enough and helpful to help us out with the new menu. Dragon chicken, chilly garlic pepper chicken are some yummy starters we had.
In the main course we added some new dishes to our monotonous dinner. Mongolian chicken and szechwan prawns were the finger licking good.
