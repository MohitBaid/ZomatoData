Good food, pocket friendly, hygenic. Nice place to have some fast food service is great too the best thing about them is the quality of ingredients they use and the hygenie the maintain although keeping the price of their food as low as any other fast food centre. Definitely not any average fast food centre and absolutely a must visit.

It's a small eatery near Sukanto Sadan catering a variety of dishes. The place is essentially congested and getting a takeaway is the best option. The veg steam momo and pan fried mono is nothing great. Fish fingers are pricey for the quality.  Egg mutton kabab roll was by far the mist annoying of all. How can someone spoil as easy a dish like roll with tiny pieces of charred meat. Chicken drums of heaven were just of poor quality. The only edible thing is the chicken mughlai. 
Would I go back to this place? Not unless all other places are closed and I am famished.

Located near sukanta sadan Barracpore.. Small outlet along with a takeaway counter. Price is okay.. Recently had a visit there. Ordered chicken fried momo, mixed noodles,chicken drums of heaven. Momo and noodle tasted good but chicken drums of heaven was not at all up to the mark.

A very small eatery near barrackpore station which provides average food at really affordable prices. Been here twice or thrice and to my surprise I have always found this place to be crowded even during blazing hot Monday afternoons.

The place looks less promising hence tried very few items here.

1.CHICKEN FRIED MOMO-- they were tasty enough and they provide complimentary thukpa along with their momos. They were very generous when it came to the momo fillings.

2.CHILLI CHICKEN-- thi particular dish was on the spicy side and tasted average. They did provide big pieces of boneless chicken but really lacked the authentic chinese essence.

3.CHICKEN FRIED RICE-- well I would prefer calling it vegetable and chicken tossed rice rather than "fried rice". Again lacked the fragrance and essence of authentic chinese dishes.

Also this place has very bad indoor sitting options. I would recommend this place to students and foodies searching for a momo joint at affordable price. But do stay away if you are determined to try out chinese.

Best place in Barrackpore for lunch or heavy snacks for school students and college goers. Try the Chicken Drums of Heaven, Chicken Fried Rice and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The place is a bit dirty but what would that matter to school students. All in all, a must visit place.

First of all it is situated beside the Barrackpore SN Banerjee Road exactly beside the main road.
Second It's a fast food chain of the famous Dada Boudi Hotel & Restaurant. You will not get traditional Biryani and chaap stuff, you will get fast foods and some chinese stuff.
Now coming to the interior and ambience well it's very small and tacky in space but... atleast it has AC even in that small space.
In food I had Chicken tandoori strip pieces and one DB's special roll.
Strip pieces were nice but little less in quantity & the special roll is basically every kind of roll in once. It is made as egg roll by double eggs then they stuff chicken, mutton and even paneer pieces into it. But honestly speaking it doesn't feel that well when you eat it. It's not bizzare but not extremely delicious. The food quality, stuff everything is nice but chicken, mutton, egg and paneer everything together you just cannot feel each one's taste at a time and that's where it starts to feel not so cool. I'll suggest if you're going to have roll avoid that special one and order something in particular like egg roll, Chicken roll or paneer roll but not the special. But the food was not as bad as I expected. It's pretty much decent.

This is basically a takeaway joint with a little self-service seating area near Barrackpore station. The food is good value for money as portions are big and prices reasonable.

I like their steamed chicken momos. They have a juicy, tasty and adequate filling. Six pieces come for just Rs 60. They pack the soup too and it's thicker and tastier than the clear soup served in old momo joints of Kolkata. I took the mixed fried rice once and liked it. It was loaded with egg, chicken and prawn and tasted decently.

It's a small eatery located near Barrackpore situation, with less sitting arrangements.
Pocket pinch is friendly with nice quality fast foods especially Chinese .
Staffs are cordial.
I ordered Schezwan mixed noodles and vegetable momo.
Noodles was yummy with generous fillings and tangy.
Momo was too stuffed with generous fillings. Soup and sauce provided with the momo was ok.
Overall a nice place.

My first visit to db's kitchen vd my best friend,, was nothing but absolutely lovely. V dodged on the egg chicken roll dere.. vc was vdout a doubt yummy.. nd total bill was just 100 bucks. D roll was less oily, dey added chat masala in the tandoori chicken pieces inside d roll nd didn't sauce it up but added lemon juice vc made it taste really good.. a thumbs up for d roll... definitely vl try other fast foods sooner in dis little joint.

A reasonable place for satisfying your appetite when you want some delicious foods at cheap price. I have taken parcels from here  a few times.  Fried rice and Chilli chicken both the items were equally good. Also tasted their rolls and it tasted simply  great. Only one negative point is that they have lack of dining space.So I prefer to takeaway food every time.

Me and my friend..we were hungry for some good chinese....so i thought of trying a chinese meal at DB's.Frankly..it was praiseworthy...i mean the dry chiili chicken was a little on the crisper side and the fried rice was decent!!!!
Would definetly recommend all of us to try their rolls..they are a delight to eat,considering they make a tikka roll..happy eating ppl

This restaurant serves lip smacking snacks. This could have been a little spacious. The lack of ambience is an issue. But the food is quite delicious which makes me rate it 4 stars.
