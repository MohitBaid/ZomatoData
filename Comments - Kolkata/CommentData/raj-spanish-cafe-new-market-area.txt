It was a hidden gem on sudder street. It serves authentic Spanish dishes.  The wall graffitis are really very attractive. We ordered mango juice, chocolate banana lassi, lasagna de pallo &  nutrella crepe.  Loved the food.  It was pocket friendly too.  Definitely going to visit this place soon.

A difficult location to find if you aren't familiar with New market area. Visually it's trendy and appealing but the taste is generally non spicy and bland, which caters to the foreign tourists who visit frequently. But, having said that, if you like continental dishes without much of the Indian-ised version spice and masalas, this is the place to visit.

This place is just little world onto itself.. you enter into this place and the writtings on the wall will  take you to another place..
The waiter was really friendly..
We ordered iced mocha( a drink that has bitter-sweet taste and if you are a coffee lover you have to try this) , pollo e fungi(thin crust pizza with lots of chicken and mushrooms on it and yeah lots of cheesw) then chicken rost and mashed potato (which was not on the menu) and for dessert soufle di cioccolato basically a choco lave cake..but the cake was already cut open which was disappointing but it tasted good..the food was well served and everyfood tasted heavenly..
And if you are going to this place don't forget to bring your own marker..(they let you write on the walls)

Raj Spanish Cafe is one of the highly rated cafes around New Market Area. We had a Margherita Pizza with add toppings of Onions, Tomato, Mushroom & Spinach. It's one of the few places which serves wood fired pizzas however I feel the pizza was slightly less cooked and less crispy inspite of being a thin crust pizza. The ambience was nice & quiant but I feel the pizza could have been better considering a few more places are coming up on Camac Street which are serving wood fired pizzas who can give this place some serious competition.

Worst pizza i have ever eaten. Just tasteless. Waste of money. The place is also tough to locate. Quantity of cheese and chicken is much less compared to the price and pizza is not at all tasty.

This is one the best open restaurants in town. Ambience might not be it's biggest plus but the food will have you covered. We ordered : 
1. Chilaquiles con Salsa Roja (Mexican corn tortillas) as starter 3/5
2. Pollo Asado con pure de patata (roasted chicken with mashed potato) as main course 4.5/5
3. Coke cause they didn't have mocktails
4. Soufle Di Cioccolato (hot chocolate cake) as dessert 5/5

This is a well known place for continental food, so it was hardly surprising that the food was this amazing. A must visit for everyone.

Hidden in the nooks of the city, this place is literally a Hidden Gem as featured in Zomato. More than once, I've heard of this place from a colleague of mine and her review of the souffle had since made me highly eager to visit this cafe. Finally, this Saturday I went to Raj's Spanish Cafe, with that same colleague and the doodly wall entrance caught my eye. You'll find a lot of paintings on the walls of this place. Moreover, the walls inside the cafe are not painted but scribbled on. This place may not look that great at first, but the menu with authentic names of the dishes and the dishes themselves will make you forget all of this.

Due to time constraints, we could only have the Vegetariano pizza, Souffle and a crepe.

Souffle was obviously the best. You must go and try it out without a second thought.

Pizza was finely thin crust and I love it that way. Veggies were in ample amount but what I missed was the amount of cheese. Being a cheese lover, it was a little difficult for me to have a pizza without much (huge much) cheese.

Raj is a little world onto itself in the bylanes of sudder street near new market. Places where your average city slicker wouldn't be strolling around in. Raj's is quaint and typical of mist backpacker haunts across the world. The cafe has an open plan which is welcoming even to the pet paws. The walls are a testament to the travellers the place has witnessed. We hopped in for breakfast today and ordered the bombon coffee , iced tea and this meat ball marvel which looked great on the plate but was terribly under seasoned. The enchallidas were fun but not authentic. I have had heard great things about the place and it's high on ambiance and the essence of sudder street but the food is milder and more palatable for travellers .

Though the name sounds weird, but the food here is just the very opposite! Possibly the only place in town where it serves authentic Spanish dishes. They pan out near authentic Italian delicacies too! No wonder this place is a smash hit among the 'firangis' (foreigners). Anyway coming back to the point, we were here a few months earlier. God knows why I haven't reviewed it sooner! 

Well to start off, one needs to go through the menu thoroughly. As most of the dishes are written in their authentic names (though it's explained in English). As there were four of us, so we tried a lot of dishes out of which I liked most of them. My friends not-so-much (why?? I'll come to that part later) :p

First we ordered one plate of English Breakfast platter and American Breakfast platter each. English Breakfast was nothing extraordinary. I have eaten better versions elsewhere! But American Breakfast was delightful (baked beans was my fav part)! Along with these, we took two plates of sandwiches. One comprised of Tuna and cheese while the other a regular toast with scrambled egg on top. Latter was ordered by an abomination amongst us!! :D Both of those proved tasty for them. 

By now one must have been full, but, we?? Hell no!! We are a hungry bunch. So we went around ordering more. BTW the waiter guy is a friendly and chatty fellow. He helped a lot in choosing our dishes. Anyway, we ended up ordering Patata (potatoes) Fritas, Fish (Pescado) combo with coke,  Lasagna de pollo (Chicken) & a plate of Chicken meat balls only for me! :D 

Chicken meat balls was the star dish of the day! It tasted fantastic!! Potato Fritas is your regular French fries. Fish Combo to one my buddy, was not so good but palatable. Now comes the fun part! Lasagna de pollo. Everyone just hated it. Though personally I liked it and really have no clue why everyone hated it so much. The revelation came much later, when one of my friends nearly screamed saying "No more continental for today!!" And there you go! Typical Indians... they just can't go without 'Indian' a day! Shame!! 

Lastly, one of us (an enthusiast like me) packed a dish looking like a grilled chicken (but I have no idea what it actually is). He said he was taking it for his mom back home! I am so proud of that lad! And yeah, how can I forget?! A friend of mine did a novel thing taking a Tiramisu. I finished half of it though! It was as sinful as one can get! 

Now, to the Café Management...you guys really did an awesome job running this type of place. I just love it. But please see to it, that the front portion of the café is renovated. It looks really shabby. And possibly speed up the serving time. A signboard on the main road would have been good too! We had to search a lot before finally discovering the place.

Well, Raj Spanish Cafe doesn't need any introduction. It's even popular amongst my friends from Delhi, who probably came to this city once or twice. 
The location of the cafe is tucked away in a hidden corner of Suddar Street. Look out for "Sunshine" shop, and it's right beside that. 

One winter evening I went there, and what's better to order than a cheesy pizza?
🔸The Spicy Chicken Pizza was thinking crust, loaded with cheese and chicken, and of course was delicious. To wash it down I took a sweet lime soda. 

The ambience will simply hook you up to this place - the environment, the songs, the people. And if you're lucky, you might as well strike up a conversation with a complete stranger from a different part of this world about their culture and customs. 
So, enjoy! :)

This is a hidden gem on sudder street that serves the most amazing chocolate soufflé! It’s the prefect piece of sinful goodness that explodes like a chocolate volcano. Also tried the pollo asado, which is basically grilled chicken, and chicken lasagna. The chicken was cooked to perfection but the lasagna a little under seasoned. Would go back to try the pizzas and the amazing soufflé.

This place is sure to make you feel like home. Food tastes great. Anything you order. Yes, I repeat anything. The Pollo Asado, a hot favourite is one of the best in the menu. It also has delicious mouth watering thin crust pizzas. Try out the Tiramisu for dessert. The decor is dim and the walls are filled with grafitti. The people are very friendly. All in all a very nice place to chill out with friends.

Visited the place for the second time today. Best beginning to a New Year with the best kind of breakfast I'll have this year.  

We were torn between the meatballs and the pasta,  but went with the former, amazing preparation as usual.  The sauce is unlike I've ever had anywhere else.  
Followed by the chicken sandwich,  which is an absolute stunner. Will never know how they make that outta plain bread,  and no grill.
The expresso with whipped cream could've been better, though.  
The highlight was ofc the funghi pizza,  the whole reason why we visited today. This place serves the 3rd best wood fire oven pizza in town,  imo.  And it's at such an affordable price! 
The chocolate soufle was the perfect ending to our very sumptuous brunch. 
Can't wait for to go back for the Carbonara, Shepherd Pie and the Tiramisu, which were the specials for the day too.  
This place is complete with it's decor,  and the ambience lives perfectly upto the name, if the authentic cooking doesn't convince you. 

Do drop by,  you'll be highly overwhelmed.

You have to depend on Google maps to locate this cafe, but once you find it you won't regret  Situated in a hidden corner of Sudder Street, this cafe gives you the perfect vibe of an European street side cafe. Tgey have outdoor seating arrangements too, though we preferred to seat inside. The wall graffitis are really very attractive. We ordered Huevo Rotos and Pollo e Funghi pizza. Huevo Rotos is a Spanish dish which basically serves french fries with double egg poach. Pollo e funghi pizza was a huge one fully loaded with tomatoes, mushroom and chicken and it tasted amazing. We were too full too try the other dishes. Definitely going to visit this place soon. Moreover, this is a perfect destination for knocking down themonth end blues as it's cheap as chips.

The cafe is located in the lanes behind the Indian museum,a bit difficult to locate though. it's a semi open air setup surrounded by small plants and owner's pet dog. we ordered veg lasagne,bruschetta and scouffle. The lasagne was prepared in a way that was different from others.it was filled with green veggies and cheese. It was quiet manageable. Coming to bruschetta,i would not recommend someone to try that here. The girl at the place recommend us scouffle,which was extremely well prepared. it was oozing with melted chocolate coupled with vanilla ice cream. The place is neither pocket friendly nor cheap. It's a one time visit place, however if someone loves silence pets and greenery,then this could turn out to be a hidden gem.

The place is located on a narrow lane towards the end of Sudder street(the lane beside Indian museum. The place is nicely decorated and has a nice ambiance. However, the pizza that we had ordered was rather disappointing. The cheese was stale and so seemed the toppings. A clear stale smell was coming from it. We also ordered a souffle, and it was pretty delicious though. The souffle should be a must try out here.

I ordered one plate of Lasagna De Verduras and Pasta con pollo en funghi. Its clearly mentioned in the menu that they offer 'farm fresh veggies' in the former dish. Unfortunately, the vegetables in the Lasagna that we received via home delivery was stale and the chicken in the Funghi dish was half cooked. It overtly smelled of garlic.

They compromise on food quality, specially on home delivery services. Kindly, live up to the words which you mention as food descriptions in the menu.

Went there on a random visit expecting nothing much to be fair, it's hidden away in an alleyway with the walls worn out and the overall feel and ambience of the place is not what you think is "great" at first. But then you start to realise all the grafitti on the walls is from the tourists and hundreds of lucky people who've been there before you, and that you can add to it anytime you want. 

Now onto the service; the waitresses are cute, the food is served super quick and the quick but diverse menu ranging from Italian to Spanish food is amazing. After eating their Lasagna, two of their Pizzas (which you can actually build from scratch) and their brownies and soufflés, I can say this is the best place for a tourist from another country visiting Kolkata. If you're more into the Bengali traditional food with rice and gravy, this place isn't for you, but if you're into Italian, or Continental, it doesn't get better than this.

This is a very famous place at a little walking distance from Indian Museum. They have a seating arrangement outside and inside. You wouldn't refer to this place as very well lit or decorated but it is comfortable. I have been to this place a few times but I have just tried the fungi pizza each time. Well, Raj Spanish is mostly known for the pizzas they offer. Large enough for two or even three people. They have a good enough service as well. Definitely a visit.

If you want to visit a pocket friendly, rustic, and beautifully decorated cafe run by young and enthusiastic people, this is the place to be. If you are a pizza person, then trying out their pizza is an absolute must as they are made in traditional way. This cafe is one of the very few places where pizza is still made in the traditional way.

This cafe was recommended by my friend and it is truly a rare gem. It's a bit hard to locate but if you keep your eyes peeled for an alley right where google maps tells you this cafe is, you'll find it.    

AMBIENCE: As soon as you walk into the cafe, you'll notice the innumerable messages and doodles all over the walls. The cafe allows visitors to scribble on the walls as a keepsake of the time they spent there. It is really beautiful and you can spend time reading the nice messages, anecdotes and recommendations on the walls in different languages written by visitors from all over the world. The interiors are comfortable and homely and the playlist is happy and energetic which is sure to put you in a good mood instantly :)   

FOOD: We were excited to order the pizzas recommended by the foodies on zomato, but we were informed that pizzas were not available. Here's what we did order -   

1) Lasagna de Pollo - this was the dish that stole my heart. Just look at the picture attached. It is a three layered lasagna loaded with chicken mince and absolutely oozing with cheese. The pasta was smooth and silky and oh so delicious. It is quite heavy and filling, and they serve two huge slices, so you can easily share this dish.

 2) Chicken Stroganoff - this dish was very different from what I've ever had. It comes with flavourful pieces of chicken and capsicum in a clear broth with options of rice or pasta. The dish was pleasant enough, though a little too sour for my taste.

 3) Pasta con Pollo e Funghi - a classic combination of pasta in white sauce with chicken and mushrooms. It was really creamy and rich, with generous helpings of chicken and mushrooms. It felt a liitle bland at times, but maybe that's because the stroganoff had overpowered my tastebuds.

 4) Soufle de Cioccolato - It's a choco lava cake with a scoop of vanilla ice- cream. What more do I need to say? Rich, gooey cake, molten chocolate, and silky smooth ice-cream. Pure bliss.

 SERVICE: There aren't really too many servers but the ones who are there are really polite and friendly. The wait for the food is a little long, but the ambience makes up for it.

 POCKET PINCH: they allow customers to make their own bill, which is very cool. No GST or extra tax. Really pocket friendly and generous servings.

FINAL THOUGHTS: I wish I could've tasted the pizzas here, but I guess I'll have to come back for that. If you visit this place make sure you try the lasagna and the chocolate souffle.

I have been to this place numerous times. It is still one of my favourites. The decor, I mean the wall adorned by writings in different languages and beautiful paintings makes one feel in a different place altogether! The ambience is extremely cozy. The service is friendly and quick. I love that you have to write the order. The pizzas are amazing. My favourite is the classic margherita. It is baked in a wood oven and it's fresh! Honey lime soda is very refreshing! Both the veg and chicken lasagna are awesome. From the price point it is affordable. Do visit for cozy experience!

The place is a suprise,the wall graffitis were just lit.
You might bump into many foreigners in this place,there is a place to sit outside for those who wants to smoke and have their food,drink whatever.
The inside part has a comfortable seating with cushions on the bench.
Coming to the food we ordered
1.Burrito-it was good,though i have never tasted a burrito before in my entire life.
2.Pollo Asado-the roasted grilled chicken with mashed tomatoes was an absolute delight to eat.
Quantity will be enough to suffice your hunger
I am sure after your 1st visit you would want to go there again.

Located in Sudder Street, this place is difficult to locate, and we had to spend nearly 15mins in the street to find it, but I can assure you that all the effort was worth it! It is a beautiful little cafe, with beautiful ambience. Open roof dining is also available. We had Lasagna de Pollo(Chicken), Shepherd's Pie, and Tiramisu... All the dishes were brilliant and pocket friendly. Definitely a must try place!

This cafe was recommended by my friend and it is truly a rare gem. It's a bit hard to locate but if you keep your eyes peeled for an alley right where google maps tells you this cafe is, you'll find it.    

AMBIENCE: As soon as you walk into the cafe, you'll notice the innumerable messages and doodles all over the walls. The cafe allows visitors to scribble on the walls as a keepsake of the time they spent there. It is really beautiful and you can spend time reading the nice messages, anecdotes and recommendations on the walls in different languages written by visitors from all over the world. The interiors are comfortable and homely and the playlist is happy and energetic which is sure to put you in a good mood instantly :)   

FOOD: We were excited to order the pizzas recommended by the foodies on zomato, but we were informed that pizzas were not available. Here's what we did order -   

1) Lasagna de Pollo - this was the dish that stole my heart. Just look at the picture attached. It is a three layered lasagna loaded with chicken mince and absolutely oozing with cheese. The pasta was smooth and silky and oh so delicious. It is quite heavy and filling, and they serve two huge slices, so you can easily share this dish.

 2) Chicken Stroganoff - this dish was very different from what I've ever had. It comes with flavourful pieces of chicken and capsicum in a clear broth with options of rice or pasta. The dish was pleasant enough, though a little too sour for my taste.

 3) Pasta con Pollo e Funghi - a classic combination of pasta in white sauce with chicken and mushrooms. It was really creamy and rich, with generous helpings of chicken and mushrooms. It felt a liitle bland at times, but maybe that's because the stroganoff had overpowered my tastebuds.

Located amidst the busy lane of Sudder Street, this place is an entirely different world once you step inside. The outdoor seating option is useful for the smokers. The Earl Grey tea they serve is refreshing even after a stressful day. I liked the Lasagna de Pollo since I have a tooth for cheese. The Ensalda de Pollo is as healthy as it looks and even then the taste is not compromised a bit. The Souffle di Cioccolato deserves special mention with so much chocolate oozing out of it. The place is perpetually happy and so is your wallet after an afternoon at Raj's.

Its a small place with unique ambience and located deep inside sudder street..i went here for the first time and was quite confused what to order..finally my order was
1.cold coffee- very refreshing and reasonable
2.fried ice cream- i had never tasted this type of ice cream before..So i liked it
3. Chicken lasagna- it was okayish to me

This place may not be a very tidy one but is surely one of the best place to hangout with your friends and loved ones..

The place is a bit hard to find; you'll have to rely on Google Maps, as it's nested in a small alley near the busy streets of New Market. 
I ordered Lasagna de Pollo, the classic chicken and cheese combo. Highly satisfyingly! The service was pretty fast. 
The café has a lovely, quaint & worn-out ambience, and it's abuzz with foreigners owing to the international fare it offers. There is a wall dedicated to scribbling messages by customers.

Courteous staff. Their concept of scribbled walls Is peppy. Loved the nutella pancakes and chocolate souffle . Though it's called souffle it's more of a choco lava cake. Prices are real reasonable and for prices that great, the food is even better. Chicken burger, chicken combo and chicken Sandwich are decent. If you're tight on cash, this is the place you ought to be.

Located in a small alley near the busy streets of New Market, this pocket friendly trendy Cafe is quite a place to hangout with friends or grab a quick bite while shopping. we tried huevo rellenos, albondigas enjoyed salsa espanola and my personal favorite dessert chocolate souffle... Do not miss out on the dessert. This time we tried out just their Spanish cuisine but I am looking forward to pay another visit and try out some more dishes on the menu.

Sneaking out of a ongoing class and to land here was the best thing I could ask.

Well, you need a spying eye to find this gem of a cafe cradled in Sudder st. and believe me or not, this simple worn-out place can topple any other aristocrat cafes in town!

So we ordered as the name here suggested.. Spanish only!

First came Huevo Renellos, Egg whites stuffed with Tuna a spicy appetizer... Next chicken meat balls with a unique salsa, named Albontigas, another spanish delicacy...

Lastly which just stole my heart away was that molten chocolate filled Soufle di cioccolata... a must-try for every dessert lover!!!

Worth mentioning their soothing playlist, and the western ambience...

Location - Sudder Street, New Market. Near Sree leathers. Great ambience.This place is usually crowded with foreigners all the time. But is definitely a place which makes you feel like home!
 
 Coming to the food, I ordered Pollo de funghi pizza, Bruschetta and cold drinks. The pizza tasted heavenly. The best pizza I ever had. Thin crust, cheesy with tasty chicken and mushrooms on the top. Just amazing! Strongly recommended!
Coming to the Bruschetta, I didn't like it at all. I haven't tried this before it was my first time. But as far as I know Bruschetta does have a little bid cheese in it which was missing in the bruschetta served in this cafe. It was just French bread with raw tomatoes. A complete No-No!

I have given this place 4.5 stars only because of the pizza!

I have heard of this place long before, but I didn't end up going at it before. There was this article in Facebook, where it said that Raj Spanish Cafe was serving authentic paella on Sundays, cooked by a Spanish chef who visits India during a certain period. After getting to know this, I decided to go there on the very next Sunday, as the cook wasn't going to be around for long.

We were 3 people who went there. The place might be a bit difficult to find, but once we reached there, we were easily won over by the ambience. It wasn't the posh kind of ambience that pleased us, but it was the simplistic nature of the cafe and everything which made quite an impression upon us. There were a lot of foreigners around, and that didn't surprise us, since we had heard that such a crowd visited the place a lot. Also the walls were decorated with writings from different people who have visited there before and it looked wonderful. It was great to be around so many different kinds of people from different parts of the world, not even speaking the same language, eating together at that place.

We ordered two plates of paella, one fungi pizza and one lasagna de polo. While the quantity in paella seemed to be a bit less, it tasted okay. It wasn't as spicy as we had hoped, and also there weren't a lot of chicken in it, but it tasted nice. The pizza was a thin crust woodburn pizza. In these days of Dominos and Pizza hut who serves you oven baked pizzas, I'd recommend you to try the pizza at this place which is very soft and would please your taste buds to the core. The lasagna wasn't anything different from what you get around, and we were quite happy with it.

For desserts, we didn't get what we were hoping for due to the unavailability of it, so we had to be go with tiramisu and cioccolato de souffle (nothing but chocolate souffle). The tiramisu was out of the world. It was soft and the coffee content was a bit high than normal, but it totally made me drool over the taste of it. The chocolate souffle was pretty nice too, though a little bit more of ice cream would have been better, as I felt.

All in all, I would totally recommend everyone to visit this place. This might not be one of the poshest places to visit, but it surely is a wonderful place to go and eat with such a simplistic and peaceful ambience around.

We ordered lasagna De pollo, Iced mocha ,chicken combo, and Tiramisu.. chicken  Lasagna De pollo  was full of cheese.. It was awesome!! Tiramisu was dessert heaven. I have already planned of my next visit to have the other items. The place is very good to hang out with friends.

It is actually more than just a cafe. This is very much different from the standard restaurants or cafes in the city. You will not experience a very formal ambiance here but the warmth of the cafe probably will touch you. 
However the food is good both by its quality and taste. I will recommend the spanish dishes here. These are really awesome. One will not be disappointed with their salads also.

Whatever items that I've tried at their restaurant is delicious! The staffs are a little off tune. Other than the behaviour of the staffs, nothing is weird.

I hope my review will be helpful to anyone who rea
Thank you!

Great ambiance, friendly restaurant. The place, located at Sudder Street, near Khadya Bhawan,  and Sreelethers, is difficult to find. We had to go on to our explorer mode to with google map. A great place to chill out with friends, or a nice date with lover or to sit down quietly with some food. 
The food may not be have authentic flavours but still has a very good option in that price range. We have ordered Huevo Rellenos and Albondigas en salsa espanola, which were hot but a bit undercooked, but Ed Sheeran's voice and a lovely presence made that beautiful. Definitely visiting again. Highly recommended.

Located in Sudder Street ( New Market Area ). A cozy place having nice ambience. The decor is one of it's kind. You can write on the walls if you like. Both indoor and Outdoor seating is available. The service should be a little bit faster. 
I ordered Chicken Stroganoff, their lip smacking dessert Souffle di Cioccolato and Mocha Latte. Everything was very good in taste. The desert mentioned is highly recommended.
I would love to go back again to try their delicious Lasagna de Pollo and Fried ice cream ( which is very rare and can be find here ). One thing that was a turn off was the quantity of the coffee served. So, if you're looking for a offbeat hangout with your friends or with your partner this is the place.

Went for the first time. We were a bit confused about what to order as we found spanish names of the dishes in the menu card. Then we took the help of zomato and other foodies of zomato.  
We ordered  polo e funghi pizza, polo burger combo.
Combo included burger, french fries and cold drinks. Just loved the taste of burger. Pizza was thin crust and good in taste. We'll love to visit again.

This cafe is the perfect place to hangout with your friends or your closest ones. The Ambiance is perfectly apt with the decors of the cafe. When i've been there like 1yr ago, that time smoking was allowed inside the cafe but last time when i went there, now smoking is allowed only in the outside sitting of the cafe. I ordered Insalata pasta which is basically a salad made of veg and loads of lettuce with boiled pasta and served with shredded cheese over the salad. I also ordered a pizza named Margharita which a simple pizza made of loads of mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. The taste of both the dishes was amazing. The way they serve the pizza will blow your mind. The pizza was enough for two peolple.

Located at Sudder Street this cafe attracts mostly the millennials and a lot of foreigners. It has an old world charm, the walls are filled with notes written by customers which range from praises for the cafe to quotes of Kabir Suman songs. If you are in the mood for a laid back adda this place is your go-to. I like their pizzas and chicken lasagna. Chocolate Souffle is a must try. Its unique and is more like a chocolate explosion. Service is fast and the staffs are very friendly. They even tweak the food according to your personal taste. I would specifically like to mention about the owner who is a very friendly man, and personally takes care of the guests and their preferences. This is definitely worth a visit. Till then, happy eating!

Raj Spanish cafe is located deep inside Sudder street, being frequented by foreigners. It’s a small place with a unique ambience , the walls have messages written by all the customers who have visited here. We had fresh lime soda and cold coffee. While the soda was good , the coffee was a bit watery and lacked some sweetness. 
For food we had the spinaci pizza, Patatas bravas, Nutella crepe and tiramisu. The pizza was absolutely wonderful , it’s tomato sauce being garlicky and tangy. The patatas bravas were basically  fried potatoes cooked in tomato sauce and served with a slice of baguette. They were really good too. The tiramisu was creamy and soft , the cake being really moist , and the nutella crepe was really thin and well cooked , a layer of Nutella covering it. 
Overall the place is really nice , serving authentic Spanish food to the people of Kolkata. It is a must try.

Heard a lot about this café. Finally visited it. Just the perfect feel a spanish cafe would give u on the streets of Madrid and Barcelona. The fun being you enjoying the same in you city, city of Joy- Kolkata. Loved the ambience. Has both indoor and outdoor sitting area. 

Best thing about this place is that U make your own bill. And I loved the food here especially the Pizza and The Dessert. Will visit again for sure.

Located at Sudder Street this cafe attracts mostly the millennials and a lot of foreigners. It has an old world charm, the walls are filled with notes written by customers which range from praises for the cafe to quotes of Kabir Suman songs. If you are in the mood for a laid back adda this place is your go-to. I like their pizzas and chicken lasagna. Chocolate Souffle is a must try. Its unique and is more like a chocolate explosion. Service is fast and the staffs are very friendly. They even tweak the food according to your personal taste. I would specifically like to mention about the owner who is a very friendly man, and personally takes care of the guests and their preferences. This is definitely worth a visit. Till then, happy eating!

Discovered this place, thanks to a foodie friend of mine. My review is based on more than one visits to this amazing cafe. Tucked in the bylanes of sudder street, near new market, this place has the potential to take you by surprise. You get the feel of a hippie yet calm place the moment you enter, with some really cool graffiti done on the walls, some foreigners always chilling there..the things I have tasted and the experience -
1. Spinaci pizza- one of the best thin crust pizzas I have had in Kolkata ..perfectly baked..really good crust, decent amount of soft cheese and toppings. 5 out of 5 for the pizza here.
2. Veg burger- they serve this giant sized burger with a portion of fries and cold drink..delicious patty, more delicious soft bread, lettuce and cheese. A perfect burger. Burger lovers must love the burgers they serve.
3. Nutella crepe- out of all the dishes I have tried here, this one is the weakest. Something did not work for me in the crepe, inspite of having Nutella over it. 2.5 out of 5 for this.
4. Chocolate soufle- This remains on top of my list , including every chocolate desert I have ever had. Can I rate it above 5? You crack open the shell of the cake and the molten chocolate oozes out. Pure bliss..served with vanilla ice cream. 5 out of 5 for this.
5. Tiramisu- Iam not a fan of this dish, but we still ordered it since the owner insisted us on having this. It was well made, and looked beautiful. 

Overall, highly recommended for a lazy Sunday brunch. P.s: the owner of this place is a real cool guy, super friendly and personally helps you chose the dishes wisely. 
Keep up the good work

Heard a lot about the place so decided to drop in to experience first hand...nice casual ambience...no ac might make it a bit stuffy during the summers..like blu sky cafe which is at a stone throwing distance this place to attracts a lot of foreigners so the food is designed to suit their pallate...tried the spicy chicken pizza...which was really great much better than the common options available in kolkata...roast chicken was a bit bland...i found the accompanying mashed potatoes to be more tasty than the chicken...would love to try their other items

Ordered a couple of dishes here.Spacini pizza and Lasagna de Verduras. Also ordered lime soda, earl gray tea and Honey ginger lemon tea.
Coming to the teas first, the Honey ginger lemon was the best.It was a new flavour for me but its very soothing. Earl gray is the same Twinnings tea bag.
Spinaci was wonderful with the melted mozzarella and the wood fired thin crust. The crust was well done and the spinach used was fresh.Spinach lent a hint of bitterness which blended well with the cheese and the smoky crisp crust.
Lasagna was OK for me.The only complaint I had was the way the vegetables were stuffed in it.They were cooked in a sort of Indian style with strong hints of spices.It also had lesser cheese inside it.They can go for lesser spices or more cheese or else the lasagna sort of tastes like a patties.

Spanish Cafe is equivalent to home. Raj, himself, is a very hospitable man and the cafe is a beautiful place to spend time in. Last December, people would find me there everyday, throughout the day (well mostly). 
The walls have art, and confessions from people who visited Kolkata for a short time and the ones who live here. The walls carry murals and graffiti and jokes and secrets.
Coming to food, everything is pretty much nice but I will recommend a few things:
1. Tiramisu
2. Soufflé
3. ANY PIZZA
However my favourite pizza combination that I created and order for whenever I'm there is - Margherita with chicken
You can choose the pizza you want and add on from a list of add ons
4. Pasta con pollo e funghi
5. Roasted chicken with mashed potato
6. Honey lemon ginger tea
7. Coffee (any)

Domestic customers are totally neglected and unduly served in the presence of foreigners over the place. Precisely, one of the places where the appeasement of the white skin is still prevalent. We need to come a long way. 
 Food is pretty average. May be a 5.2/10.

This place is very different compared to the rest of the cafes that iv been to till date. Its got that oh-so-perfect Adda ambience. Located in Sudder Streat, foreigners keep visiting here. No fancy air conditoned interiors and decor present. The walls are full of graffiti wich makes the ambience more friendly and not that sophisticated types.
Tried Albondigas en salsa espanola, Lasagna De Pollo, Banana crepe and Bruschetta. Unfortunately did not get a chance to try the famous Paella, but will surely come back soon to try it and some more Spanish dishes.
Being not so okay with dogs, made be a bit uncomfortable as its got stray dogs moving around the place.
Barring this, everything is just perfect.
Definitely a must visit for all. ✅💯

At dashami afternoon I went there with two of my friends. The ambience is not that good. We had ordered lasagna and chicken pizza! The lasagna wasn't value for the money we paid, part of it was hot and part of it cold, may be they provided us the previous day's item, the only good thing was the cheese. Then came the pizza, it was really tasty and filling for us all! Atlast we ordered caramel custard but what we got was something more like a pudding and tasted horrible! Overall had a moderate experience, not going for a second visit, though.

This place was on my list for quite a while now. Finally I got to go there. It's located quite inside Sudder Street and kinda hard to find but once you do...it's a great experience.

It's dimly lit and the walls are filled with graffiti -- cool.

We ordered a mint tea, honey tea and a chicken and veg burger combo each.

The honey tea was really awesome and the burgers were juicy and the patties were really big and juicy. All of these costed us Rs 510. A very good experience.

Recommended.

Tucked in the lanes of Sudder Street this place is a paradise for foreigners with it's subtle music and ambience adding up to the great food .The place is famous for it's Lasagna De Pollo which is their signature dish .The Fried Ice cream of this place tastes lucrative and even their appetizers like the Cola Float and Coffee with Chocolate Icecream .The Chicken Stroganoff Pasta was good as well but The Chicken Spicy Pizza was exotic and rich in it's taste.The Graphitti walls of the cafe allows you to scribble on them and write whatever you want .

Try their Pizzas because that's the best pizza at an affordable rate in and around Kolkata. Pastas and the crepes are good as well. Delightful, amicable staff and owner with a homely ambience and culture. They do away with the concept of fine dining and the place seems to be very uniquely different from other cafes. A lot of varieties for vegetarians too!

I had the Raj Spanish Cafe Special pizza which was non vegetarian and around Rs. 430 bucks without extra toppings. We added cheese, french fries, extra chicken as the extra toppings and it was absolutely perfect. 9/10

One of the finest eatery I've visited in a long time. A place like home. The ambience is such, that it'll make you comfortable in a beautifully soothing manner. Placed away from the hubbub of Sudder Street, it'll definitely make you fall in love. The food, needless to say is great, and prices affordable.

I have been going to this place quite a while. Recently, they have increased the prices but there do not charge GST. The food is decent and one of the main reasons I love Spanish Cafe is it's brownie with vanilla ice-cream. However I went there a few days ago and it seems like the quality of the brownie has really deteriorated. They give you small helpings now and it's really unsatisfactory. I was really disappointed this time.

It's a humble place. With Spaniards and other foreign tourists coming in every now and then. The wood oven baked pizzas here are a must try along with the choco lava cake with vanilla ice cream. It's non AC which is a let down when you are considering the hot and humid weather in Kolkata. Nevertheless, it's pocket friendly and the food is worth the money.

I had my first encounter with wood fired pizza here and I absolutely loved it. We also ordered Lasagne de Pollo, and it was great. It was the lightest lasagne I have had till date. As an added bonus, we got to taste the authentic paella prepared by an experienced Spaniard. Nothing special, but felt good. The amount of chicken in the paella was too less. For dessert, we ordered tiramisu and chocolate souffle and both were lip smacking. Will definitely visit the place again, at least for the pizza.

Mahalaya made 10 of us visit this much talked joint of sudder street , the Raj Spanish Cafe ! Take the lane beside Indian museum , on the right leaving blue sky cafe walk straight and you will find the place on your left ! The quirky decor , the writing on the walls is a real eye catcher ! There are several board games available with a huge space to dine. We settled in the sofa and making ourself comfortable we ordered

SPICY CHICKEN PIZZA - With generous amount of cheese and chicken melting in your mouth you can't make yourself fall in love with this dish.
LASAGNA DE POLLO - This is the best lasagna I have ever tasted , with chunks of chicken and cheese presented in the perfect manner.
ALBONDIGAS EN SALSA ESPANOLA - This is basically chicken meat balls served with a creamy gravy along with French fries and one garlic bread. This tastes nice as well.
PASTA CON POLLO E FUNGHI - This is basically a white sauce pasta tossed with mushroom and chicken . This was bland. Even after adding huge amount of chilli flakes and oregano we couldn't make it taste good.
BURRITTOS - Not a fan of burritos , they tasted pretty much like they should.
CHICKEN STROGANOFF PASTA - This was loaded with gravy which was really flavourful and tasted really good.

*Desserts*

SOUFFLE DE CIOCCOLANTO - This is actually chocolate souffle with ice cream. Molten chocolate peeping out of the crust tastes heavenly. We went completely gaga over it.
FRIED ICECREAM - This is basically vanilla ice-cream with a fried coating. We dint like it at all.
BROWNIE - 4 brownie slices topped with vanilla ice cream in the middle served with generous amount of chocolate sauce . This was again a heart winner. The brownie was fresh and tasted really good.
NUTELLA PANCAKE - This was a complimentary dish served by them for us which tasted really good except was topped with banana cubes which somewhat killed the flavour.
The prices are all inclusive of tax and won't burn a huge hole in your pocket. The service is a bit slow but since a student friendly place , that's acceptable. Will definitely visit this place again :)

Ever visited one of those small eateries on hill stations, with dim lights and minimal decor? Good. Now imagine one of them placed here.
The joint isn't air-conditioned, kinda lacks enough ventilation as well.
However, you won't feel out of the place right here.
It has certain warmth, rather literally.
After a wholesome shopping, visited this one on a fad. We actually meant to grab a cup of coffee or something and vamoose out of the place. Ended up ordering stuff.
Empanadas de Pollo: Wraps in Spanish tbh. Stuffed with chicken and veggies in a thick gravy and served with onion rings on top. A great quick bite.
Albondigas en salsa Espanola: Meat balls, bread and fries. Am really not sure how would I rate it, cause it became cold by the time we had it. Kudos to serving timing. It was kinda insignificant I guess?
Souffle di Ciccolato: Best of the lot. The souffle was spongy and had jelly like chocolate on top simulating volcano, also oozed out some from the inside as we cut through it. Served with cold vanilla scoop, it was a silver lining. Nothing beats good dessert after all.

I'd like two things to undergo improvisation.
Serving pattern- pay heed to customers. Just don't serve everything at a go. Wait for the sequence.
Aeration- Even this place isn't chock-full, it feels crammed and heated up due to lack of enough openings.

The bill was surprisingly low. And no GST bites either. With few updates, this place can surely get waves of moppets to keep it lively.

Visit was long overdue. But the info that Rafael Gimenez Calleja is in town was cooking paella this Sunday meant we couldn't stall it. We had to go or miss his special. Food didn't disappoint we order obviously Paella roast chicken American breakfast fungi pizza and tiramisu. Paella was so full or flavour, the chicken roast is one of the best I have had in kolkata best part its roasted with the skin which very few kolkata eateries do. Pizza was think crust and very sauce and cheese was soggy and not too burnt or crispy and the tiramisu was heavenly I loved it especially cos it had a strong hint of bitter coffee. Service was very good and ambience was relaxing and friendly. Raj came and chatted with us and in fact brought Mr Calleja to our table for directly feedback. We were happy that we could thank him for the delicious food.

Not everything old and popular necessarily has to be amazing. Two contraindications for visiting this place are vegetarian and summer. 
The place might be better for the non vegetarian items but the other items are not at all palatable. And there is no AC. 
There is no ambience, instead you are greeted with senseless motifs and poster art. The servers themselves are confused what to suggest for the vegetarians and they have the ability to convert any non veg dish to a veg one. 
It's worth only if you order pizza. Maybe the place is well known for highly selective dishes. This time it was a miss for me.

When I first came to Kolkata, it was Calcutta at that time, I was surprised to see the glittering set up of Park Street Area. Though I was a frequent visitor to the place because of its extensive collection of extraordinary food joints, the existence of ‘Sudder Street’ was not known to me for many years. While wandering through the area once I was taken away by the total get up of the area. The narrow street, dotted with uncountable hotels & eateries filled with Foreigners of every ethnicity is nothing less than a mini Europe located in the heart of Kolkata. It took me few more years to know about Raj’s Spanish Cafe which serves the best Spanish cuisine in the city and that too at an extremely affordable price. 

There is absolutely no advertisement and branding but the young generation of the city is aware of the place and they keep it crowded throughout the day, starting from breakfast to dinner. The most popular feature of the cafe is its wood-fired pizzas. You can get the widest range of Pizzas here at the most pocket-friendly price. The mouthwatering pizzas have brought me back again and again to the place.  

Then on a rainy afternoon last August I was suddenly introduced to ‘Paella’. I had no idea about it before that and had to do a little googling before taking the first bite. Paella, the signature Spanish dish originated in the Valencian area of the country, is one of the tastiest protein rich foods you can get. It is basically a rice-based food that has a lot of vegetables, meat, seafood in it and that, together with its saffron seasoning, gives it an out of the world taste and flavor. 

The biggest attraction of the Paella at the Raj’s is that it is cooked by a Spaniard. Rafael Calleja is a Spanish cook who spends half of the year in India – January to March and July to September – and during that he cooks the Paella at the Raj’s Spanish Cafe. I was totally surprised to know that this routine is followed by him for more than a decade and most of the city is totally unaware of it. The Valencian magic is available only on Sundays afternoon and you have to plan it well because it does not last long.

The city that splits vertically on every El-Classico night surely has a craze for everything Spanish is surely going to love this magnificent Spanish creation. So, Next weekend should be kept free for a small afternoon visit to the narrow lane of Sudder Street which will end up licking fingers.

Location: Raj’s Spanish Cafe, Sudder Street, Kolkata

Time: Sunday Noon

Dates: January – March, July – September

The most popular feature of the cafe is its wood-fired pizzas. You can get the widest range of Pizzas here at the most pocket-friendly price. The mouthwatering pizzas have brought me back again and again to the place.  

Then on a rainy afternoon last August I was suddenly introduced to ‘Paella’. I had no idea about it before that and had to do a little googling before taking the first bite. Paella, the signature Spanish dish originated in the Valencian area of the country, is one of the tastiest protein rich foods you can get. It is basically a rice-based food that has a lot of vegetables, meat, seafood in it and that, together with its saffron seasoning, gives it an out of the world taste and flavor. 

The biggest attraction of the Paella at the Raj’s is that it is cooked by a Spaniard. Rafael Calleja is a Spanish cook who spends half of the year in India – January to March and July to September – and during that he cooks the Paella at the Raj’s Spanish Cafe. I was totally surprised to know that this routine is followed by him for more than a decade and most of the city is totally unaware of it. The Valencian magic is available only on Sundays afternoon and you have to plan it well because it does not last long.

The city that splits vertically on every El-Classico night surely has a craze for everything Spanish is surely going to love this magnificent Spanish creation. So, Next weekend should be kept free for a small afternoon visit to the narrow lane of Sudder Street which will end up licking fingers.

Location: Raj’s Spanish Cafe, Sudder Street, Kolkata

Time: Sunday Noon

Dates: January – March, July – September

I kinda payed a visit on a sultry sunday afternoon.
Stands in sudder street. This place is kinda a heritage food joint for the city of joy. Serving authentic spanish dishes over the years. 
Was lucky to get hold the Paella which was pretty good to taste. 
Besides this the Lasaga de pollo was the most mentionable one , this dish had almost melted my taste buds to the good. 
I didnt experiment here in a day coz i would love tp come back and try out their pizza's.
The ambience decor and food is pretty good. 
Apt place to land down with a bunch of friends and spend some quality time.
This place definetly gets a 'Must try' tag.

Friendly ambience and great food... You can spend hours over here... They make amazing and authentic pizzas... There are several Spanish dishes that will take away your heart... The tiramisu cake is a plate of heavenly bliss... You must not miss ordering it... The fried ice-cream was also not too bad... The Cafe can be availed even if you are running out of budget.. It's quite cheap

One of my favorite places to hang out. Pocket friendly. The oh -so perfect Adda ambience ( not to expect fancy air-conditioned interior) and great food.
My favorites include honey lemon tea and sandwiches. The pasta is equally good. Located in sudder street,this place is packed with foreigners and also locals. But people who expect fancy ambience, with air- condition, proper seating arrangement, please do not go. Raj is a place which will always be close to my heart. 

The picture below is one of their special dish, I really don't remember the name.

Being from this city, I was desperate to find and feel the presence of this place. Raj's Spanish cafe was on my go to list for quite a lot of time. During my first visit just recently, I was confused by it's entrance as there were no proper hoardings guiding in the direction. That was a big letdown. But as soon as I got there, it was a different feeling altogether. The vibe, the feel of the place etc. were all quite great. The main host over there was very warm and polite. Considering that the place is a hit amongst the foreign backpackers, the host's way of dealing with these people is by talking to them in their language in order to keep the understanding maintained.

This place serves one of the best pizzas in town.

Located in sudder street, this place is a hotspot for foreign backpackers and travellers who live near that area.

The place has a homely feeling.
Although not a fine dine, but The place looks amazing with the graffitis on the walls, books, guitar, and big tables with sofas, which can be shared with other customers as well.
You can write anything you want on the walls, play guitar or even play loud music if everyone is okay.

The place is often loud because groups of foreigners come and chat loudly, some of them were even dancing.

Food: we had wood baked pizza: (pollo e funghi)
The crust was thin and crunchy. Loaded with cheese and chicken and mushroom. One pizza is enough to fill 2 people. Although a bit on the greasy side but it was tasty.

Lime soda which was normal.
Honey lemon soda was not so good.

Service: They generally serve pizza after 1 pm because it takes time to make the oven. So we had to wait. But it did not felt bad because we had those sofa type seats to lie around.
The owner and staffs are very well mannered.
Owner even pranked my friend and we all shared a laugh( cant share the story here)

Price: the price is very very reasonable. No extra tax charged over menu.

You should definitely try out this restraunt.

Our very own Calcutta ‘The City of Joy’ has a rich colonial heritage which is unsurpassable in the entire indian subcontinent..bearing testimony to such a classic existence is this open ended at your face street cafe..located right in the centre of the city’s commercial cum tourist hub between astor hotel and the newly opened townhouse hotel at new market area..this cafe might be difficult to locate for commoners but once u do get in u feel the charm of this place..plz do note that there are no fancy luxuries like ac, cushioned chairs..itz simply the air around this place that sets it apart..frequented by tourists this is a place to spend your quiet laidback evenings over a cup of espresso and some snacks to go with..i ordered machiatto(rich bean coffee with milk froth) to start with..patatas bravas(fried potato in a spicy sauce),tortilla de patatas(egg omlettes with fried potatoes) and huevo rotos..well the difficult to pronounce menu might seem confusing but the delicious nature of the food makes up for it..this is a place for the people who love the city amidst all its flaws..a place to brood over the long lost or just found..love it or hate it but u just cannot ignore it..cheesy it may sound but do visit it for a change..

Lovely place! Has both outdoor and indoor seating. No AC though,but the warmth of the place takes away your fatigue I guess!
We had
*Albondigas en salsa espanola : 4 chicken meatballs with french fries and a slice of bread
*Lasagna de pollo : Chicken lasagna with loads of cheese
*Iced cafe latte : cold coffee
*Espresso : hot black coffee shot
*Tiramisu : coffee cake and cream dessert which was the day's special
The lasagna was so light! Neighbouring Blue Sky Cafe has oil dripping from their lasagna,but this one was surprisingly light and yet SO tasty.
The meatballs were okayish,when eaten with the french fries it gives you a nice taste.
The coffees were normal.
But the Tiramisu was totally awesome! One of the best desserts I have had! Melt in the mouth,having the right hint of coffee and chilled cream and more coffee powder thrown around it,having a huge size,it was dessert heaven. Costed 220. I say keep it in the regular menu! It's awesome!
Total bill was 860 for these items. You can donate in a box instead of giving tips. They don't charge any extra taxes,what's in the menu is what you are paying.
The place was filled to the brim with foreign tourists,yet the people of the cafe cared for us so much. I am going back soon!

This place is a perfect hangout spot with its Spanish cuisine with an Indian touch. The food tastes good, their chocolate souffle is famous and although i didn't find the taste great but it is a proper souffle, with the chocolate melting out of it in the first bite. I liked everything else we ordered apart from the meatballs, that can be better. You will enjoy the ambiance if you like cosy, open and off-beat places. Overall it is a place you must go once to, if you're in Calcutta.

The ambiance is good but a lot of stray dogs move around the table which is a question about cleanliness. Hospitality is quite scarce. The staffs don't know how to pronounce half of the name of the dishes.
The time taken to prepare food is on the higher side. Some of the items were good some of them are on the mediocre side. A lot of foreign people visit this restaurant. Overall it was a mixed experience.

The decor is different from most of the cafes in the city. This place lacks air conditioning.
We ordered Egg sandwich, lasagne, tuna sandwich, mushroom soup, chocolate pancake and brownie.  The egg sandwich was awesome. And the lasagne too *_*
The tuna sandwich is not for the people who don't like the smell of any fish. The pancake and the soup were okayish. But the brownie *____*  it's one of the best in the city at such a reasonable price. 
Must visit :)

The thing that really amazed me was the walls the walls were filled by markers like you can literally right anything on the walls it's really cool you can doodle you can write quotes anything...you can find Chinese and Spanish language written on walls. This place attracts a lot of foreign customer.
Now coming to food the food was nice and no that much expensive. Now this place have their own mud oven they bake in there and that's what many pizza outlets don't offer. The drinks were nice and the pizza was really tasty. 
So overall if you're looking something cool and less expensive place to hangout just go and hit this place you'll love it. 😊

This restaurant is placed at a very obscure place. But it is worth of giving that effort to experience the food at this place. It has kind of a cozy sitting arrangement. We went there at around 5 pm and preferred Italian over Spanish. This place serves wood fired pizza which is one of a kind. This is a bit different from the other pizzas served by some branded restaurants. You must try it to get the authentic taste of the pizza.
We had the following:
1. Pollo de funghi pizza: it was delicious.
2. Fresh lime soda: good but could be better. We ordered sweet and salty one but it happened to be on the sweeter side. It seemed that they used preserved lemon juice instead of fresh lime. It resulted a bitter taste in the beverage.
3. Tiramisu, the dessert of the day: the presentation of the dessert was really nice. I was happily surprised to see the thought of the presentation in such a small food joint. The Tiramisu was supremely tasty. Every bit of it was flavorful and smooth. I had Tiramisu in many places and sometimes in some of the speciality restaurants but the Tiramisu of this place is mindblowing. It made me so happy that I cannot stop writing about it. It had that height.
4. Chocolate souffle: it was more like molten lava cake rather than a souffle. It was mediocre.

This place makes you happy with its offerings, be it the food or music or the ambience​. The best and unusual thing of this place is that noone takes the order from you and you write your own order.
Nice place and I would like to visit it once more to have their Lasagna.

Want freedom to write on walls? Then drop in here. Write, draw, sketch anything you feel like. Show your creativity, make it beautiful, make it messy.. The management won't mind. Raj Spanish is one of the coolest cafe's in town preferred mostly by college students for the chilling session you have with friends here is priceless. ❤️ 
I went with my group to try desserts and it was a big disappointment. An absolute failure. Waiting for more than 40mins would still have been fine if what was served was satisfactory. Never try the pan fried icecreams here because it was not an icecream but a pakora. Yes pakora. 😑 The other desserts had fancy name in the menu but was actually a choco lava cake served with an icecream. 
P. S.  Read other reviews because mine was a depressing, distasteful and disheartening experience.  😟

Being a  fan of PASTA I have not missed visiting this place.The PASTA CON POLLO I FUNGHI or Chicken Mushroom Pasta in White Sauce is my favorite from this place.If you love pasta you are gonna love it for sure.The Chicken Burger Combo is also nice.
The Albobdigas en salsa española or the Chicken meat balls served with fries and bread is a hit.I must say. And the Brownie adds a brownie point to your taste buds.
You are allowed to smoke there and the walls of the café tells a story of their own which makes the place more interesting.
One should visit the place atlest once. Overall a very good café.

Located in the midst of the busy Sudder Street, this place might be slightly difficult to find but a little asking around would help you get here very easily. This being on our checklist for quite a long time, my friend and I decided to visit it for a Saturday lunch. The quirky ambience and the queer location adds to the charm of the place. We had ordered a dish which consisted of Chicken Breast and a tuna dish. I don't really remember the huge names. The food was absolutely delicious. For desserts we had ordered a Soufflé and a Tiramisu and I can assure you, that the dessert here would be nothing like what you've tasted before. The only disappointment would be that this place doesn't have an AC.
We loved our visit to Raj's Spanish Cafe in all.

It is a semi open cafe situated in Shudder Street. We went there because it was hugely recommended by a friend. The ambience was quirky. Red walls with graffiti made by all the customers who visit the place,few pictures,book shelves with old collections of myriad books along with unusual decor such as phone covers,etc was new. The waiters were very courteous. There is an outdoor as well as indoor seating arrangement. We tried the spanish meat balls, polle funghi pizza and the tiramisu. However we were disappointed by the Burrito. The Lasagna was not up to the mark and very small in quantity. The enchiladas where nice but were small in quantity. The fried ice cream where ok. The souffle was exquisite.The food was amazing. The pricing was apt and it is tax-free! The bonus came when they laid down a screen and we started watching the IndvSri champions_trophy'17 match(which Ind lost sadly). The tiramisu was absolutely brilliant. The presentation was nice. The coffee powder added the correct amount of bitterness which was required. And it was melted in my mouth. Definitely recommended for a second visit!

The best thing of this cafe is the reasonable rates(without any tax) of the dishes.We had, Margherita pizza - tastes awesome Lasagna de Pollo (chicken) - too good. Full of cheese. Soufle Di Cioccolato - was yummy. Its the best for the choco-lovers like me.Staffs were good.Fantastic experience! If you are looking for a bit offbeat place, then Raj's Spanish Cafe is a must try.

Behaviour of staff- decent

Food - we had
1) fish pescado with salad,french fries and coke - it tasted good.
2) Pollo Asado Con Pure De Pot - roasted chicken simmered in butter with mashed potato --- the 2nd best roasted chicken i've tasted till now. Chicken was soft,succulent with perfect blend of salt and pepper .

overall - satisfactory. but the seating place is not air conditioned.

They have a lot of dishes whixh are italian or spanish but they are not cooked with the same authenticity. Taste needs to improve.
But its not heavy on the pocket and serves for a nice place to hangout.

Worth a shot. Reading all those comments on the wall makes you so nostalgic and start to wonder where did it all began. Great place for the variety of pizza it offers. You'll forget for a moment that you are actually in India, as in my experience I found myself surrounded by foreigners most of the time. Great place man.

It is a semi open cafe situated in Shudder Street. We went there because it was hugely recommended by a friend. The ambience was quirky. Red walls with graffiti made by all the customers who visit the place,few pictures,book shelves with old collections of myriad books along with unusual decor such as phone covers,etc was new. The waiters were very courteous. There is an outdoor as well as indoor seating arrangement. We tried the spanish meat balls, polle funghi pizza and the tiramisu. However we were disappointed by the Burrito. The Lasagna was not up to the mark and very small in quantity. The enchiladas where nice but were small in quantity. The fried ice cream where ok. The souffle was exquisite.The food was amazing. The pricing was apt and it is tax-free! The bonus came when they laid down a screen and we started watching the IndvSri champions_trophy'17 match(which Ind lost sadly). The tiramisu was absolutely brilliant. The presentation was nice. The coffee powder added the correct amount of bitterness which was required. And it was melted in my mouth. Definitely recommended for a second visit!

I have been there for quite a few times with my friends. Its a perfect attraction for teenagers,especially the students. The best thing of this cafe is the reasonable rates(without any tax) of the dishes.We had, Margherita pizza - tastes awesome Lasagna de Pollo (chicken) - too good. Full of cheese. Soufle Di Cioccolato - was yummy. Its the best for the choco-lovers like me.Staffs were good.Fantastic experience! If you are looking for a bit offbeat place, then Raj's Spanish Cafe is a must try.

Located in the Sudder Street,this place is truly a hidden gem. It is mostly popular among the young generations and the foreigners.With walls filled with handwritten letters and memories by the customers,books strewn here and there and amazing playlists,this place has its own cool quotient.
Now coming straight to the food.We ordered Iced Mocha,Iced Coffee,Spicy Chicken Pizza,Lasagna De Pola.All the dishes were per expectations,be it in quality or proportion.The Fried Ice cream for desert was absolutely melt in the mouth.
Price is quite reasonable.A must go for youngsters!

Quite a surprise find this. Went out with a few colleagues after work and the Spanish meat balls were mindblowing. So we're the wood fire baked Pizzas. They have a quaint wood fire oven in the backyard which churns out the most delectable Pizzas.The salads are a bit heavy on the oil but good otherwise. But the Tiramisu...... Just Yummmmm

If you are a pizza freak ...this is the best place to try it. They make excellent thin crust pizzas. Apart from that one should also try their whole chicken roast...very tender and juicy. I have tried their lasagna, chicken combo which comes with french fries a cold drink and salad...and a mexican dish which consists of fillings of chicken boiled eggs and olives. All their dishes are A class. Prices are reasonable as well.

Really disappointed with this one. Had heard about it from friends and so decided to check it out on our way home from Victoria. The sandwiches were not good, the sweet fresh lime was salty. There was this gross stench all over that wouldn't settle. 1/10. Definitely don't recommend.

Atrocious interiors. No air conditioning. Went there on a hot afternoon, expecting some respite. Was hugely disappointed. There is a stench of cheese, probably, that permeates the senses throughout your stay. The fresh lime soda (sweet) was NOT sweet, and the sandwich was below par. We had to search for some other restaurant to satiate our hunger, as this completely failed to live up to its hype. NOT recommended at ALL.

Though this place is a bit difficult to locate, I'd say it is completely worth the trouble. This little hidden gem gaves us the experience of a lifetime! First off, I was impressed by the millions of scribbles on their walls. They tell numerous stories of people who have been there and loved it as much as I did.
Food:-
We had Funghi chicken pizza which could give the pizzas from any other pizza places, a good run for their money. It was literally the yummiest one I've had! It was loaded with mushrooms, chicken and stringy cheese. The thin crust had a wooden, smoky smell which is because of the wood oven they use. Perfection served on a plate!🍕
Then comes the chicken lasagna. It was three layered, scrumptious and delicious! It sat heavy in the plate and was a winner.
The brownie with ice cream was a slight letdown because I felt the brownies were too dry. Could have done better with two scoops of ice cream instead of one.
It was an unforgettable visit and I'd recommend all of you to visit. Tathagata Bhowmick

Thanks to a friend who took me to this place... This is a gem of a place. Was difficult to find it cause it was not well marked plus very little advertisement's, however the food didn't disappoint us at all. The walls itself are laden with so many writings from people who made a stop in kolkata and fell in love with the city and its people. The dessert was simply delicious, the souffle had molten choco pudding filled in it, is served hot and is supposed to flood the plate. 
If you want to chill with friends along with good food, this place is highly recommended.

No AC, no decorations just a crude place with sone quality breakfast and snacks.

This place is located in Sudder Street and is best for the young generation and an attraction to the foreigners. This cafe has seating areas outside as well as inside. The walls have hand written messages by customers and has a guitar hung on the wall. It is spacious and the ambience gives good vibes. 
We ordered chicken steak and fresh lime soda. The chicken breast was a thick juicy piece of chicken served with mashed potato and veggies. The taste was great and I would suggest everyone to try it. We could write personalised messages on the walls.
The staff is very friendly and very approachable. The ambience gets full marks. The food is equally good and quality is top notch. The price is reasonable and would definitely attract all the young souls. A must try.

This place is really hard to locate. But me and my friend bookmarked it since long. So we called them and they guided us the way. Tried a few things here. 
 1.I will start with the deco. Its quite charming and peaceful. Couches r quite comfortable and so the ambience.
 The dishes we ordered are: 
Burrito, Ensalada Mixta, Lasagna De Pollo, Pasta con Pollo a fungi, Pizza-pollo a fungi, pollo asado and  soufle. 
2. Ensalada Mixta was too ordinary. You will feel cheated for the money u pay for it.
3. Burrito was a simple wrap in tortilla with a bit extra spicy filling.
4. Pollo asado tasted too ordinary again. 
5. Lasagna wasnt hot and the cheese wasnt in melted form. And pasta con pollo a fungi didnt do the justice as a white sauce pasta.
6. But after so many ALMOST DISAPPOINTMENT we had something good. Pizza pollo a funghi was a flat bread pizza with sufficient amount of cheese and toppings. We liked it. All of us.
7. But the show stopper was the soufle. You should really really go there to try just their soufle. I would certainly give it a 4.5/5. And will definitely go just because of this

We have been hearing good things about this place forever and was extremely keen to try out. Located in sudder street, deep inside the lane next to Indian museum, it has an old iron gate as a landmark. There are a couple of shops inside and one of them is Raj's Spanish Cafe. It is a semi-outdoor place, with its gates always open and stray dogs and cats trailing in behind you. There is only one word to describe this place- cool. With walls full of scribblings by the customers, a guitar one one side, some books strewn here and there, the place is buzzing with atmosphere. We tried their chicken lasagne. It tasted good, though we found it a little dry that day. However some of our friends who have been there before said they have tasted better lasagne there itself. We also tried the polo asado con puree de potata, which were told was new on the menu. It consisted of a chicken breast cooked in butter with mashed potatoes on the side. The chicken was soft and juicy and it was absolutely delicious. We had their tiramisu for dessert, which was absolutely melt in the mouth. The base had been dipped in strong, slightly bitter coffee, just the way I like it. We were told that they make the tiramisu one at a time, and the next one is made only when the previous one is sold. So they are available at intervals of half an hour. But as they allow you to sit for as long as you wish to, it is not a problem. 
All in all, Raj's Spanish cafe was a great experience in terms of food, ambience and service. I am most certainly going to be back.

Located in the heart of Sudder Street, this cafe is a real gem. Simplicity and uniqueness being it's USP. It's neither a very luxury chain restaurant nor does it have an AC but the generous warmth this place has to offer will embrace you with arms open.

Being a frequent visitor, when asked to choose a cafe in the area, couldn't miss but drop in. We had ordered chocolate lassi, salted lassi, coke float, iced Mocha, burrito, funghi pizza, lasagna De Pollo, Enchiladas Verdes, Chicken Sandwich, Ensalada tempalada and Chocolate Pancake .

Needless to say all the dishes pandey as per expectations or even faire better. Be it portion of cheese or meat or condiments, generous is all they serve.

Also, being a student pocket pinch is our first look out. Did it burn a hole in ? NOO ! Would I visit again ? Have I not already !

Tucked in the bylanes of Sudder Street adjacent to New Market this not so typical cafe might miss our sight but once it falls on it , it's tough to not fall for it.As it's in the name Raj's Spanish Cafe is totally a Spanish Cafe where it's a hub for the foreigners to come and chill and enjoy the variety of food served here.It's rare to see such a Hippie and a Bohemian ambience of a cafe in the lanes of Sudder Street in our city.The cafe doesn't have an air conditioner but it's own warmth doesn't let you have discomfort.With Spanish Music always playing in the background and the Graffiti walls filled up with people's thoughts in various languages the place has a cool quotient of it's own. Now coming to the food  , Lasagna De Pollo is a signature dish here which you can't simply miss.Then there's their speciality with Pastas and Pizzas. The Spicy Chicken Pizza leaves you in awe as it's really tasty and yummy.Another dish was Chicken Straganoff Pasta which is a gravy dish and the amount is good as well.Banana Pancake was average and Mango Lassi too.But Coke Float takes away the cake and attention as it's better than the Coke Float at many other places.
The restaurant is one of it's own kind due to the not so typical decor and the Graffiti walls and the ambience.
The Cafe is not at a very prime location and can miss the sight of many .
Moreover it's really interesting to read the comments of the other people engraved on the walls that too in various languages which gives us an antique and a vintage kind of a feel.Special mention goes to Fried Icecream which is very rare and can be found here.So if you are looking forward to try something new.Here's your chance .
So if you are looking for something offbeat  and a bit not so typical hangout place then the lanes of Sudder Street are waiting for you to engage yourselves in the land of Spain!

I had really set my hopes high for Raj's Spanish Cafe. I've had this place bookmarked since a very long time. And so, this afternoon we dropped in for a late lunch.

This place is located inside an open compound and not so easy to find. The people there take care of a couple of lovely stray dogs and even allow them inside the cafe. Such a happy place to be in!
The staffs were attentive and courteous.

While the ambiance and service highly impressed me, the food part couldn't as much.
We ordered an Ensalada Pollo (chicken salad) and a Chilaquiles con Salsa Roja (corn tortilla chips with red sauce).
The salad had diced green and red bell peppers, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, olives and sautéd chicken cubes tossed with mixed herbs and served in a bed of medium shredded lettuce and drizzled with olive oil. Very mediocre in taste. The ingredients are very predictable. Expected more variety.

The tortillas were really horrible. It tasted EXACTLY like our Papdi Chaat. The sauce was sweet and sour where I expected it to be something spicy. The chips were topped with freshly chopped onions and coriander leaves and so-called cheese which was nothing but curd. Hated it!

Totally admit that we had deliberately ordered the wrong stuffs. But if stuffs like the Tortilla Chips are present in the menu and if they don't improve on them, they should immediately have such items, in the name of spanish dishes, removed.

The place was wonderful. It's like a mini Spain in the midst of Kolkata. The varieties of Cuisine is extensive,along with a good service and a splendid atmosphere.

Coming to the food, the Pizza must provide the best value for money experience in the city. The chicken dishes were excellently cooked and well seasoned. The desert department has a scope of improvement but the "Tiramisu" is quite perfect. This is not the best place to experiment on beverages but they're satisfactory.

Must try : Pizza , Tiramisu and Lasagna

At the end the chocolate brownie was too good..

If you haven't been out of India to another country for the food they serve then it's probably really good food for you. 
My experience was at best average. I ordered a pizza with mushrooms and chicken. The best thing about it was the crust being that it was Cooked in a wood fire oven. 

The open kitchen would be cool if the food was actually good. I suppose we all want to support a cool place but do it when they actually serve GOOD Food and not mediocre at best.

Everything and anything you order from the menu is pure divinity. We tried the margarita pizza which was really thin crust.. the bownie was yumm. Lasagna is damn good. Burrito and aspegas the polo.. can't miss on any of them. 
The only problem is the location. You need to search a little bit...landmark is the new market fire brigade. And one drawback is they have no a.c. but the decor is good.  Gives you a hippie feel.. and the food is very pocket friendly . So raj Spanish cafe is a must visit..

Culmination of different cultures is what this place is you can find people for every part of the world. If you thinking of going to a fancy place think again. If you want a cheap place to grab good food this is it. We had lasagna and gambas en ajo y something i forgot. Lasagna was ok, gambas were really good. People smoke here so people who have trouble with that will have problems, and the place is a no go during Summers.

A better coffeehouse! The place is perfect for big addas with smoking privileges and a feeling of open space. But its quiet, encourages conversations through its decoration, and manages to retain a casual, outdoor mood. In fact, the ambience of the whole cafe is couched in local tones while being quite obviously multicultural. Raj spanish cafe celebrates IPL, hosts poetry competition, and gives out pizzas as prizes. It boasts of spanish, mexican and italian cuisine and has a wonderfully varied menu, yet the food does not live up to the mark at all(there's a reason we compared it to coffeehouse).

Located in the sudder street. This place is very popular amongst travelers and tourists  as well as localites. 
Ordered pollo e funghi pizza. It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. 
Also ordered Melanzane alla parmigiana. This dish was heavy. I mean it's enough to fill your belly alone. 
However  burrito 🌯 was disappointing.

Oh the ambience! No AC? You won't notice it, with good company. The walls are filled with names of visitors and small pieces of philosophy they believe and wanna spread. It's worth going here to see the walls. 
Iced moca was made perfectly. There was a special chicken dish, the name of which I can't remember, but it was epic! Soft chicken with the stock and some mashed potato. 
Overall experience was warm. They waiters look nerdy and behave well. Also their is a dog if you wanna cuddle it.

The service was average. We had lasagne de pollo which was scrumptious and filling, huevo rellenos- a Spanish dish made of mashed tuna put in egg white shells, it looked gorgeous and tasted pretty well too. We ordered virgin mojito and iced mocha to go along with it. 
The best thing about the place is, it's gives you the perfect space for escapism. Nobody seems to judge you, you have the walls talking to you from across the continents and you have really cool sofas where you can dozz off if need be. This place is a must try, guys..

Coming to know from a college junior, we (me and a couple of friends) went to Raj's Spanish Cafe. We had dinner plans there, so went a bit late.Walking down the Sudder Street, I was wondering where is this famous cafe everyone is talking about recently, and then came the building which hides the entrance of RSC. Quaintly decorated with murals and wall covered with memories and handwritten notes nicely puts everything together, from the sudden smell of oregano and pizza to the lovely open air tables. 
Raj's Spanish Cafe can be easily considered as the spanish corner of the city beaming with tourists and students. What astonishes me most are the price tags. Pocket Friendly cafe with scrumptious food is a rare combination. We had the specials for the day Chicken Stroganoff Pasta, Pollo asado con pure de potatas, Spanish translation of Meatballs, Lasagna de Pollo, Margherita and Spanish cafe surprise for pizzas, and Fried Ice cream, Souffle di Cioccolato, Flan de Huevo. My mouth has started watering as I am taking and rolling each and every name in my mind.Everything is too perfect to be true, but RSC is real. RSC is highly recommended for everyone.

Visited this place one afternoon on a Vespa trip around Calcutta, for lunch. 

First off, incredibly hard to find cafe but once you do find it, the interior's nice enough. Open seating plan and the walls are covered in the names and words of people who've visited before. It's a popular haunt for foreigners visiting the city and has quite the reputation so naturally, I was quite eager to go check it out for myself. 

Ordered the chicken lasagne and the spicy chicken pizza with extra capsicums, pineapple and olives. Also ordered a honey lemon soda and a watermelon juice. 

The lasagne was quite possibly the worst I've ever had. The only good thing I have to say about it was that the pasta sheets were properly cooked. The cheese was barely there and the chicken itself was dry, seriously missing out on more sauce and completely unaware of this beautiful thing we call "salt". Salting your meat while cooking it lends it much more flavour than crunching on granules randomly sprinkled. Decided to pack half the dish but had the waiter spill it over the table instead! 

The pizza while quite decent, also didn't live up to expectations. The pineapples were not sweet at all and the sauce could've used more salt too. I will however say that it had a lot of potential, and is something I will recommend you would be safer ordering, should you visit. The drinks were decent. Nothing to particularly rave about, but nothing to find fault with either. 

A big part of why I'm rating this place poorly is that despite the fact that the waiter spilled a whole uneaten half of lasagne on the table, he had the gall to charge us the full amount for it and when we asked him why we were paying full price for it, he took the money anyway saying he couldn't do anything. That incident completely cheapened the experience for us and didn't really speak too well of the customer service, especially at a place habituated by such a diverse group of people. We ended up spending around 850 on the meal and paid just so we could leave and not ruin our day. 

All in all, my takeaway from this visit was that the restaurant is waaaay more hype than value for money. Sit this one out. You're not missing anything.

Located on Sudder Street, this place is pretty popular among students and tourists, and there's every reason for it to be so! Though it's a bit too hot, but the place has a comforting feel about it. We ordered a chicken burger( that came with French fries and coke), chicken lasagna and a brownie. The food was great! The warm brownie topped with vanilla ice cream tasted like a piece of heaven! :P
This place is worth a try.

Sometimes food is all about the ambiance..if you want to feel out of India where people don't judge you for what you are you should visit to this little place of heaven. It also comes with great food without pinching your pocket. And before leaving you can sign a small note with your signature on the wall for others to read.

We ordered cappuccino, Pollo funghi, a thin crust pizza with mozzarella, mushroom and chicken and a fresh lime soda. They took just 5minutes to serve the food. Thank you Zomato for help us to find a hidden gem in the heart of the city of joy..

A well known place by sudder street, frequented by foreigners for its homely atmosphere and mouth watering Italian and Spanish spreads, Raj Spanish Cafe isn't a place if you are in for a fine dine. But for a foodie like me who wouldn't mind an okayish setup for great food it's a hidden gem. Though the simplicity of decor is again why the place feels so friendly that you can actually laze in for hours and have long conversations. 
We had to put our orders in a paper as the norm here. There was a special for the evening, mouthful of a Spanish name which was half a chicken baked in a sauce which tasted of butter, olive oil and dried herbs served with mashed potato. The skin was crisp outside but not leathery, and the meat was juicy and imbibed all the flavours of the sauce. Then we had baked chicken lasagna which was good. Lastly the chocolate souffle...Ah.. Heavenly...I couldn't be more thankful to the man who waited on our table for suggesting this. And all these for 600 INR!! Pure bliss!!
Lastly the walls of this place painted with the lovely memories of travellers from different parts of world seemed to be the best decor. Wow what an idea sirji !!

Its located on sudder street closer to mirza ghalib end..its not on the road actually..a narrow lane will lead u to a small ground and there it is..the signboard is visible well from road..
In a nutshell:
1.value for money
2.around 5pm fresh baked pizzas become available..impressive
3.each and every corner of every wall is full of graffiti ...no pro thing of course. Spanish english bengali all kind writings are on the walls..a hanging guiter which u can play if u wish..
4.nothing fancy, no ac..
5.full with foreigners, and hippies, and of course indies
6.presence of smoking area may be delightful for some fellows
7.u can gossip at full volume, no one will complain
8.food is good, not exrraordinary..

Though a little hard to find this place totally lived upto my expectations. The ambience and decor is perfect for the young crowd. There wasnt an inch on the walls not scribbled on, which looked kind of interesting to me. Coming to food the waiters are friendly and service prompt. We ordered spicy chicken pizza and lasagna chicken. Both were delicious especially the pizza which was thin crust , filled with chicken and cheese! The other good thing is the place is very reasonable. Would definitely visit again 😃

An open cafe! lovely ambiance, tasty food, helpful waiters!! What else you need in a cafe?? Located in sudder street, people might overlook this place as there is no big banner or tag on the street, but you can definitely ask anyone, people will help you as it's one of the oldest cafes in the area. We ordered Empanadas de pollo and Albondigas en salsa Espanola, both were delicious. One should definitely try this restaurant❤

A tiny little resto tucked in one corner of sudder street. Serving some awesome continental food and frequented mostly by the foreign crowd of esplanade area. 
  They have a good system of placing your own order.
Now the food 
Pasta aglio olio peperoncino - pasta with olive oil and garlic with capsicum and mushrooms and specially added chicken .... Light, tasty and healthy 
Lasagna de verduras - not the typical lasagna served in a dish or bowl but served in a plate ... It tasted okay but when it comes to lasagna i have had much better.
Pasta con pollo e funghi - pasta in white sauce and cheese with mushroom and Chicken .... This dish was heaven the white sauce soo tasty and the mushroom and the chicken complimenting it.
Empanadas de pollo - this was also very good with egg and chicken stuffing rolled around a dough and baked.
Banana chocolate pancake - though it was more of a crepe but it was tasty so no worries.

This is an absolute favourite place for the college students. I visited Raj 4 times and every time it satisfies my taste buds like the way it did on my very first visit.
Their freshly baked 'Lasagna De Polo' is the most favourite one.A tempting, mouth-watering Italian cuisine to which you can never ever say "NO". 
Besides the lasagna i also had "Empenandas de pollo",the Mexican cuisine with folding dough around stuffing of chicken and egg.
One "Chicken special sauce pasta" with freshly chopped corriander and basil leaves.
For dessert i had brownie with ice cream,previously i had "Soufle di Cioccolato" but i was never impressed by their dessert section!!!
The interior is quite homely and unique because the walls are filled with handwritten notes of different languages as people from all across the world come to visit this place and all of them leave a piece of their soul behind in form writing.

Visited after a long period of contemplation...and to nobody's surprise it was worth all the hype... A quaint place with warm ambiance is a rare find in the buzzing aura of New Market area and Raj's spanish cafe is just that. 
Contrary to most places the ostentation with italian,spanish and mexican food is something you won't find here and perhaps this is the USP of the place. The owner's warm congeniality adds to the charm. Tried the chicken lasagne which was as authentic as it gets!  
Recommendation - The speciality of the day
                                 - The chocolate soufflé which can give any fine patisserie a run for its money and the owner promised that it would make me forget my previous experience of five stars and...true to his words it did!!! 
P.s Do try their wide range of pizzas which the owner and the customer persisted is worth a try...as I will, on my next visit.

Not only for it's scrumptious paraphernalia of Spanish delicacies ranging from crunchy Nachos to heart melting Souffles, but for the ambience as well.

👍 Food, seating arrangement, ambience 

👎 Location 

Saddar street is one of the foreigners hub in kolkata, if you want to have real nonspicy, healthy food (definitely those are tasty too !) for your day..this is the place! 

what do you get more?

Well, you get a cozy homely cafe! Not like the commercial café's that you see everywhere now.. a small place for your group to come and relax, to seat for hours. To actually have a long chat with your friends over a just baked pizza 🍕 
Or to read books with sips of your favourite coffee or tea? 📚☕ Or may be read the wall with a choco lava.. 🍮 😍
Basically this is the adda place you were searching for! 😇

We went there for breakfast, ordered :
 PAN TOMACA (bread brushed with garlic and olive oil,  sliced tomato)
PISTO MANCHEGO ( mixed vegetables with sunny side up and toast) 
TORTILLA DE PATATAS (kind of a cake shaped dish with egg and boiled potato) 👌
CHILAQUILES CON SALSA ROJA ( Fried corn tortillas with sauce and cheese) 
CHOCOLATE BANANA PANCAKE 😍
NUTELLA PANCAKE 😍 and TEA
Tortilla de patatas and nutella pancake is best for sure!
Finally this place is shortlisted in my favourite hangout zones!! 😁 Truly a hidden gem !

Ambience is nice with sitting arrangements. It's location is somehow difficult to trace. This place is most of the times crowded by foreigners.

Staffs are nice though service is bit slow.

Tried Spinachi Pizza & Souffle. Spinachi Pizza is very yummy, cheesy and flavourful. Souffle is a kind of chocolate dessert, is very delicious and enjoyable. A must try items.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

A lovely place to dine in.

Was bookmarked for a long time. Though I went shopping in the nearby shop before, never visited the cafe.
Paid a visit today with 2 friends during the afternoon.
It was almost filled up but luckily we got a seat soon.
The ambience of the cafe is very good. The walls with writings by people from all over the world, the oven where pizzas are baked and the crowd adds a special touch.
The place is a bit small but they will be extending soon.
Service is good.
It's a place where you can hop in after a tiring day at college, and relax with friends over some good quality good which will not burn a hole in your pocket.
Now, coming to the food.
We ordered Lasagna De Pollo (Chicken Lasagna), Albondigas en Salsa Espanola ( Chicken Meat Balls, Fries and bread) and Spinaci (Pizza with Mozzarella, Spinach and sauce) and some lime soda and coke
The Lasagna was very yummy and cheesy. Treat for your taste buds.
Meat balls were well cooked and well flavoured. The fries were crisp, the bread tasted very good but they give you only 1 bread :( SAD.
The Pizza ! It was freshly baked and very cheesy. It was a perfect pizza with the right amount of everything !
I loved the lime soda, it was very refreshing. Special mention because it was different than regular lime soda.
All-over it is the perfect place to try out Italian and Spanish food within "college student budget".
Don't forget to write a little something on the walls.Gonna visit again for sure. Anubhav Saha

A perfect place for a casual meal. The place is crowded with foreigners. If you are looking for something fancy, this isn't the place. The walls are decorated with doodles, tables are to be shared with others. Coming to the food, it's mind-blowing. Both quality and quantity is awesome. Price is pretty decent. Haven't tasted continental food this good in this price range. One huge drawback is this place doesn't have an AC. So visiting this place in Summer is next to impossible.Aniket Mallick

However this goes without mentioning that IMO the food are overpriced, so be mindful of that if your wallet is not heavy ;). The ambience is cozy.

Was bookmarked for a long time. Though I went shopping in the nearby shop before, never visited the cafe.
Paid a visit today with 2 friends during the afternoon.
It was almost filled up but luckily we got a seat soon.
The ambience of the cafe is very good. The walls with writings by people from all over the world, the oven where pizzas are baked and the crowd adds a special touch.
The place is a bit small but they will be extending soon.
Service is good.
It's a place where you can hop in after a tiring day at college, and relax with friends over some good quality good which will not burn a hole in your pocket.
Now, coming to the food.
We ordered Lasagna De Pollo (Chicken Lasagna), Albondigas en Salsa Espanola ( Chicken Meat Balls, Fries and bread) and Spinaci (Pizza with Mozzarella, Spinach and sauce) and some lime soda and coke
The Lasagna was very yummy and cheesy. Treat for your taste buds.
Meat balls were well cooked and well flavoured. The fries were crisp, the bread tasted very good but they give you only 1 bread :( SAD.
The Pizza ! It was freshly baked and very cheesy. It was a perfect pizza with the right amount of everything !
I loved the lime soda, it was very refreshing. Special mention because it was different than regular lime soda.
All-over it is the perfect place to try out Italian and Spanish food within "college student budget".
Don't forget to write a little something on the walls.Gonna visit again for sure. Anubhav Saha

A perfect place for a casual meal. The place is crowded with foreigners. If you are looking for something fancy, this isn't the place. The walls are decorated with doodles, tables are to be shared with others. Coming to the food, it's mind-blowing. Both quality and quantity is awesome. Price is pretty decent. Haven't tasted continental food this good in this price range. One huge drawback is this place doesn't have an AC. So visiting this place in Summer is next to impossible.Aniket Mallick

Kolkata’s foodscape is transforming fast. Almost every other day, you would find new places opening up, from gastro-pubs to fine dines to swanky cafes, each of them adding something new to our city. But Kolkata is not only about the mushrooming new restaurants and bars. Delve a little deeper and Kolkata has so much more to offer in terms of food. Take Raj Spanish Cafe at Sudder Street for instance. Raj’s is not new to the city, but in these times when your dress code dictates if you get to enter a certain place or not and the rights of admission is reserved in most restaurants, Raj Spanish Cafe is there to remind you that good food is without rules.
                                                                ...

Nice try hiding the place I say. It was only after consulting google maps and asking around did we finally arrive at the place. The entrance might repel you, but wait, don't give up yet, go in, wait for a seat, get seated. done ? now look around.. aah yes, exactly how i felt fir the first time there.. was their woth my friends and spent some 3 lazy hours there... nice food... really nice ambience.. try their lasagne and pizza. good place to "chill out" with your friends. 

statutory warning: If you are looking for lip smacking food, and fine dining, this is not your place. also no booze. :(

After a day of shopping in new market,when you are really craving for hot pizzas served oven fresh,with a thin crust and an ample helping of cheese; with a topping rich in winter veggies and chicken,here is where you should drop by!Located in a "not-so-visible" area of Sudder Street,this place is definitely a catch. A very comfortable ambience with college-goers sitting and strumming guitar inside...this place reminded me of my college canteen,and i walked in to make my evening extra special with the lasagne served with bread.Yummity yum as it was...i tried their pizza next...thin crust, exquisitely made to perfection with the right amount of cheese and "pollo" on top!I closed my eyes as i savoured the taste of the authentic Italian spread!Flawless!To top it up I tried the chocolate soufflé...soul-filling!

P.S.They have a red wall with graffiti all over!Don't forget to write your name on the walls before you leave!Souvineer!

After a wait of 2 years, finally mission accomplished.

But I was disappointed.

It's a nice, casual hang-out place and very well-ventilated. 

Items ordered were burritos, empanadas and a Contadina pizza.

Burritos were very filling and came in huge portions. Though I personally didn't like the flavour and feel that something more could have been done.

The empanadas were beautiful. Juicy, tasty and filling with olives, eggs and a tangy sauce that just adds the necessary kick. It comes in quantities of three and is enough for one person.

The pizza was okay, though the size was huge. ours had potatoes in it and they lacked flavour and the rosemary made matters worse. The crust tasted like simple roti and even though I appreciate the generous dollops of cheese and tomato sauce, I expected more.

None of the items had enough salt in them.

Overall, a nice place for cheap fare with great quantity.

Among the many joys that Kolkata offers, one of them is its ability to surprise you. Raj Spanish Café is one such place which augurs this ability. I have been here twice, separated in time by almost two years, and on both occasions it's been an experience out of a bag of delight. Located at an unexpected place, nestled within the bylanes, among a bevy of cafés and eat out joints, this place is hard to find. By address, it is on Sudder Street, much closer to the Mirza Ghalib Street end.

If have to describe this place in a few words, I would say it is an European café in Kolkata. With seats laid out on a courtyard with wall graffiti by artists, lit up with fairy lights, it can be an evening full of memories here. Or if one chooses the indoor seating, it can gift you long conversations over some good food. Come here in groups and make the most of your time. It is a open kitchen, non air conditioned place, but then you hardly ever feel the need. On the two occasions that I was here, a small change just added to the charm of being here. On my earlier visit, the walls were adorned with photographs, of Kolkata, its places, its people. On the more recent visit, they let open the walls to the guests to express there imagination. One could just write or draw anything. With the entire walls filled with words and hand graffiti, one can just sit and read the walls. It is an insight into the guests' mind. And since this place is so very frequented by nations from around the world, it is your insight to the world.

Coming to the food, the place has a lot to offer. They are open early in the morning and you can just drop in to kick-start your day here. With pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, rissotos, salads, tea and coffee one is split with choices. They have a charcoal oven for freshly baked pizzas and they are available post noon. The sandwiches are also worth a try.

Well it's not that this place isn't without any shortcomings, and there is plenty of room for improvement, but then I wouldn't want this place to change. It's charm lies in the way that it is. It's vibrant, cosy and imaginative and all at the same time. Visit here to just delve into the ambiance.

As one of the wall graffiti rightly reads, "You can find Kolkata (and Spain) anywhere in the world, if you have the eyes to see it"

Happy eating!!!

Everything about this place was so out of the world! The walls has stories and doodles inscribed on it and it was really a treat sitting inbetween them and having my lunch. I took Roast chicken which gave half a chicken perfectly roasted with butter and mashed potatoes. The Roast chicken was fresh and soft and was just perfect. I was alone so I could not try the chicken lasanga which is a speciality dish. I will surely try that next time when I am out with friends. The visit was just perfect and left me craving for more!!

It's pocket friendly, food is amazing. It makes authentic Mexican, Italian cuisines. No extra vat charges makes this place more attractive. Will surely visit soon.

situated at sudder street near new market area, it is a cozy place to hang out.
service is very good.
i think there are many travellers who live around that area. when we reached, there was not a single Indian present.
well, we ordered sweet honey pancakes and ensalada mixta. both of them were good. we avoided tuna in the salad.
the place is quiet and very nice. they have open as well as inside service.
they offer a large variety of food with so much pocket friendly prices.

This is one of the very 1st restaurants that I had added to my wishlist when I joined zomato.The place is located in sudder street,almost everybody knows the location.We dropped in on 19.11.16 for an evening snack.We had ordered their lasagna de pollo,roast chicken with mashed potatoes(which was highly recommended by the waiter),a cup of cappuccino and their very special souffle.The lasagna was yummy and super cheesy and had a tremendous amount of stuffing.The roast chicken was absolutely delicious.Crispy on the outside and soft and juicy on the inside.A must have.The coffee was okayish.But the souffle topped it all.Brilliant.It's more like a choco lava cake and comes with a scoop of ice cream.Takes you to some wonderland. Exceptional food.And no vat.A foodie's paradise is what it is.

What to say except FATAFATI.  The place is bit odd to locate but once u locate it you will fall in love. It is located behind the house n hotels of sadar street.  But unique. First thing u will notice that its latin style graffiti. To locate the place walk straight beside indian museum before reaching free school street its in left side. 
Now come to food. Its awesome. One of the best continental restaurants of the city the taste of food is quite unique. And price of the food is reasonable. Speciality of the restaurant is mexican food n italian.  The chicken ball preparation is bit dry but taste is good. Once u must try if u like continental dish.  And like to lake south american dish in kolkata a must go restaurant

One of the best food decisions I've made in this city. This place is tucked away behind buildings on Sudder Street but once you've located it the experience is amazing. Some delicious food and a very chill ambience! Had a couple of pizzas and a pasta but the dish of the day was easily they're chocolate soufflé... To be honest I don't even like chocolate but this dessert nearly converted me. A must visit for anyone who likes continental food.

Very hard to locate,the place is just opposite to the Astoria hotels.You may miss the entrance if you have never been there before.The cafe is very cool and mostly occupied by foreigners.Service was prompt and the stewards were knowledgeable regarding the dish they provide.
Coming to the food we were served with roasted chicken,a special menu prepared by them.Aaaahhh the food!!The chicken,the smashed potatoes, melted butter as topping took us to a different world.Though the chicken was bit hard but still the taste of the dish made us forget that.
If you want to chill with friends along with good food,this place is highly recommended 😃

Absolutely in love. 
I wish they put up a board outside, otherwise unless you look very hard, its blink and miss, literally. 
Opposite the Astoria Hotel, there's a dirty entrance , and the Sunshine shop for all things comfy and hippie, and tucked in a corner is this cafe. 
I wanted a light lunch and after much deliberation, ordered a Honey Lemon Soda, and a Tortilla de Patatas. 
The inside throngs of young foreign students and their banter -- there are no qualms about seating. You share seats, you sit wherever you get a seat. 
My food came right in at the 15 minute mark, piping hot. Do add salt and spices - tabasco and ketchup , and this cake of potatoes with egg is low on spices, and absolutely yum. It came with two slices of bread, I didn't really care for that. It was filling, cheap, and I loved it. 
The service is laidback, casual, puts you at ease. Even a solo diner like me was treated well. 
The walls are filled with all the love they'd had over the years, its amazing to read all that. 
My bill came to just around 85 bucks, i was super full, and I'll definitely come back for the burger and the fondant and pizzas :) 
PS please make your prep (know what you want to eat, read more reviews for recommendations before coming here. Toss out the albondigas and pastas, and the lasagna, unless you loove cheese) unlesd the alien menu might lead to bad choices.

This place is old and have a wonderful charm to it. Location wise,it is pretty hard to locate if you are not well aware of New Market area. The food was not up to the mark, as we ordered a variety of dishes. We ordered a Ensalada de patata which was nothing but boiled potatoes with mayo,though the menu said it have tuna,which was not there honestly. The Risotto was half boiled rice with raw vegetables. The Pizza,on the other hand was great,and they serve pizza after 5pm only. The food we ordered,apart from the pizza was not good in my opinion, if you visit the place,go for the pizza and the caramel pudding.

Visited this place on 18.10.16. Hard to find though. Decor is outstanding. Really, this place demand your visit due to its comments on its wall. Ordered Pollo e funghi and Empanadas de Pollo. Quantities are small with respect to price. Pizza was good but not good as Pizza from Pizza Hut. Empanadas de pollo was good but it was simply 'Mangsher pithe'. Also they are charging for water for 20/- per Litre. At least put it in the menu like IRCTC. Staff was cordial. It was a letdown overall.

Raj Spanish cafe is difficult to spot.. though if you have been to Fairlawn and Blue Sky Cafe in Shudder Street it won't be very difficult to find out Raj Spanish Cafe! We ordered Enchiladas Verdes (Tortilla Wraps with Chicken and Chilli sauce) ,it was served with cheese,corianderand onion on top. It was tasty😊

Though half of the items from desserts were not available. We wanted to have fried ice cream. That was a disappointmet!😟

Prices are pocket friendly and inclusive of taxes. 😊

Thanks to a friend who took me to this place .. this is a gem of a place.
The fact that it is difficult to locate and doesn't have air conditioning or is roughly shabby place..let that not bring your morale down. Trust me go have the food there. You'll be blown! Definitely.
I have been there 3-4 times and still cannot get enough of it.
My personal recommendations would be the gazpacho, and the chocolate souffle!
Go taste this, and you'll know why!

Besides we had ordered a non veg wood fired oven pizza (speciality here) . They serve 8 slices and that itself will fill you up. Perfect cheesy and thin crusted.
Okay you should order your pizza well beforehand because they take some time to prepare the oven.

The lasagna and white cheese sauce pasta were perfection. Flawless. No inch to complain about.
Yum!
I also tried experimenting with an enchilada from the Mexican menu.
Tortilla rolls with meat and marinara filling. Tender yet with a bite to it. Topped with basil parsley and goats cheese giving an edge to it. The onions are perfectly softened yet not caramelized. Al Dante.
You have no idea how amazing the food here is. You are really missing on a lot of you haven't yet paid your visit here.

The prices here are just nothing compared to the very fancy restaurants serving global cuisine these days. A very pocket friendly joint. If you have been to fairlawn in New market area, then keeping it to your left walk straight and enter the lane to your left into a garage kind of area.
Trust me you'll overcome all the difficulties just as soon as you have your first bite.

P.s. you get fresh lime soda for 30 bucks. Can you imagine? Get the reality check ASAP!!

Finally this place has been checked from the places I want to go to hog.
The margarita pizza with this crust and properly spread cheese was a delicacy.
White sauce pasta (called by some complicated name that I dont remember) just had a little bit of oregano missing. Rest was just how I would love it.
Watermelon juice was very refreshing. And the ice tea served with the tea bag was authentic.
Since the soufle was not eggless I couldn't try that but it's texture softness and the liquid chocolate inside it looked so so delicious. I wish they had an eggless serving of it too.
So, the long and short of it : Food is delicious. Reasonable rates.

Was introduced to this place long ago... and been there a couple of times now.
The ambience is good . But I prefer to sit in open air.
The inside are charming ... but too small and very stuffy!
The funghi pizza is superb.... and so was the classic baked chicken n mashed potato....
I like the way they make their coffee... latte , expresso or cold coffee....
However.... the salads and the pastas are nothing special.
Overall.... it's a 3.5!

I have been to Spanish Cafe many times over the years. Mostly to grab a drink or a snack.  have always liked the place for its chill ambience and friendly staff. Today, I regretted the fact that over all these years, I had never sampled their pizzas. We had the Funghi pizza with a few extra toppings. I
One word: Brilliant.
So reasonable (a medium sized thin-crust pizza for two @ INR  300 approx. ). They have authentic wood-oven pizzas. The crust was baked to perfect and all the toppings were in perfect proportion. The cheese used was of a good quality as well. Go there NOW.

Another hidden gem not very far away from Blue Sky Cafe...sudder street has its own charms I guess.Very ordinary yet comfy seating arrangements...with overwhelming graffiti all over the walls in different fonts...certainly boasts of the café's legacy.Ordered Russian Salad,the most celebrated Albondigas en Salsa Espanola,Burrito and Soufflé
I really loved the salad...it was just as perfect as a salad should be...
Coming to the star of the show,The Albondigas Espanola,was nothing but a serving of not quite moist meatballs in a thick veg soup kind of gravy accompanied with french fries..something new,definitely,but not quite worth the hype.The burritos were stuffed with what felt like mashed burnt brinjal..yeah kinda like our plain old baingan ka bharta going abroad...The dessert was simply delicious,the Soufflé had molten choco pudding filled in it,is served hot and is supposed to flood the plate and mingle with the accompanying ice cold vanilla icecream scoop,to conjure up a mini heaven...simply fabulous.The experience out here,was indeed unique...

With innovative decor and cool ambience , this spanish hub in sudder street is a gem. Their italian styled pizzas are a must try.. They have this drink called float which is basically vanilla flavoured coke and it was really good. Overall a pocket friendly experience and I will love to visit again..

One of the best eateries in town. Pizza was just awesome, so was soufflé. It's a non AC but still if you are going there for food and the decor, every penny of yours spent there is worth it.

Honestly, it is one of the most beautiful places you will ever find in the city. Although the food served isnt exactly top notch, yet the ambience and the vibe more than makes up for this. The walls are literally coloured with memories; people from all over the world have come and written about their experiences on them. Overall, a great place to hangout with friends and spouses!

We went there today on 5th September and we loved the ambiance. Anyone who has set foot inside the cafe can leave a message on its walls. The walls itself are laden with so many writings from people who made a stop in Kolkata and fell in love with the city and its people. The ambiance is unforgettable. The food is fairly priced and shells out decent taste. I wouldn't call it bang for the buck, because their interpretation of some dishes are just plain bad, including the meatball and sauce: it has a fancy long name on the menu but isn't fancy to taste.  The desserts are nice and are worth mentioning, especially the Iced Mocha, and the tea is just excellent there. We were served Earl Grey tea and it was great! 

Would I come again? Yep: this is a great place to hangout in Sudder Street area.

This truly is one of the hidden gems of Kolkata. The place is actually hidden and you have to look out to enter the mini world that resides within the cafe. It's a non AC Restaurant but a cozy comfortable one. Staffs are ambient and customers are regular out here. People have written messages from all around the world which gives a different vibe altogether. 
Coming to the food, we ordered #Honeylimesoda #IcedMasalaChai #Espresso with whipped ice cream, #TunaSandwich and #LasagnaDePollo. I really loves the espresso with whipped ice cream and lasagna de pollo but the Tuna Sandwich was not at all good. 
But this cool place deserves more and more visits.

Ambience is different,  the good kind of different. 
The choice to write on the walls was a nice touch. 
The waiter seemed helpful and courteous. 
Ordered a vegeterania pizza and a choco de souffle. 
Both were priced a little bit on the higher side. 
The souffle was good,  nothing special. 
Pizza was decent, thin crust with loads of different kinds of vegetables. 
The softdrinks were billed at twice their mrp. 
However,  my girlfriend got food poisoning by the time she returned home. 
Dont know the reason,  may be the pizza.
But would avoid this place in the future.

It was a sultry afternoon when we managed to search for this hidden gem amidst the chaotic alleys of Sudder Street. After all the exhaustions I was looking for a cool and cosy place to chill with my friend along with some lip smacking food. But I was disappointed to discover that there was no AC inside. As we settled in couch the waiter immediately arranged for a pedestal fan to make us comfortable.
We began with Lasgne De Verduras. The very first appearance of the dish was extremely alluring. There were layers of baked pasta, veggies and cheese. It was marvellous and as we slowly consumed, the flavour tantalized our taste buds.
Then came Albandogis En Salsa i.e. meatballs served with French fries and light gravy containing chopped carrots, cilantro and corn flour. The meat was fresh and went well with the gravy which had a wonderful flavour. The third item that we ordered was a bit disappointing . The dish named as Huevos Rotos was nothing but poached egg served with huge quantity of French fries. We ended our meal with Soufflé which was again delicious.
Overall it is an unconventional eatery in the heart of the city that gives us the liberty to scribble on the walls and leave any message we want. Again there is a dog who welcomed us at the entrance and thereafter slept near my feet as we enjoyed our food. The shelf full of books beside the couch would bring me back to this place on some lazy afternoon when I would love to spend some time with myself while reading and relishing the scrumptious food.

In a sultry evening, my friend took me to this place instead of my plan of visiting an AC restaurant. But what I found made my finest discovery in the New Market area - if a cozy and comfy food den is the destination after a tiresome day. Yes, it has only ceiling and exhaust fans but it won't bother you once you sit drawing your feet on your seat for few minutes.

The Honey Lemon Ginger Tea here is an absolute rejuvenator, and the Iced Masala Chai can soothe your soul at point of time. Lasagna De Pollo (Pasta) tastes mediocre but quenched our hunger soberly. The Chocolate Pancake tasted a little sweeter and ended up feeling of having it never again.

This place might turn into a den for any friends as the pro-adda atmosphere is the best thing it has to offer.

Had a very bad experience while talking to a manager in the cafe today. Customer service being the most important aspect of this sector, I was shocked by his behavior. I have always been a regular here but would not recommend it to anyone anymore. He was speaking in spanish to some foreigner backpackers when I happened to ask him how he knows spanish so well. He very rudely answered, how do I know english so well, We got into an argument and he even said I would not get a job because I am NOT "rude".  I think he should be sacked immediately. Horrible experience. Did not expect this from this cafe. I feel he was just trying to show his clout while talking to foreigners. To sum it up, this kind of behaviour is unacceptable. Please buck up guys with the kind of people you hire. I don't know his name or would have mentioned it here. He's fat and was sitting with a laptop and he sucks beyond words.

Raj Spanish Cafe is a lovely place to spend time with friends along with delicious food. It is located at Sudder Street. They don't have any beautiful decor,air conditioner or any good atmosphere but it has got a charm. You can write anything you want on the walls just ask for a marker. Now coming to the food they serve continental food and they are delicious and pocket friendly. From the Lasagna to the mocha latte to float to Souffle everything is perfect but the pizza they serve is the yummiest. Now don't wait and head to this food joint with your friends.

Tucked away at a corner of sudder street. At face value, its not pretty, but serves good food. The people are friendly around this place. And you could spend a couple of hours reading and figuring out the different things people have scribbled on the walls.
Coming to the food, being a regular here, I order the chicken burger and pastas more often.
Also they have a different Pizza menu in the evenings!

Raj Spanish Café is an interesting little place on Sudder street and perhaps a little difficult to find. The food was for the most part healthy and oil free and rather interesting.
We ordered the Huevos Relennos (boiled egg stuffed with tuna, tomato sauce and mayonnaise along with the yolk) and Albondigas el salsa Espanõla (meatballs, French fries and a piece of bread) as they seem to be very popular. Apart from these we ordered the Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp sizzler with 3 pieces of shrimp, yeah kinda oily), chocolate lassi and an espresso.

Although the food isn't mind blowing, it is pretty good and the menu offers a lot of variation while going easy on the pockets. That along with the interior (slightly messy, writings on the wall) as well as the other guests just casually enjoying their meal and having a chat gives this place a rather unique and relaxed environment. The lack of air conditioning (which didn't really make the place unbearable or anything), the open doors, only add to this unpretentious feel of the place. This is, I suppose, a very comfortable place to just talk or hangout in a group over some light food.
Edit: Went again with some friends. We had the spicy chicken pizza, iced mocha, Pasta Con Pollo e Funghi and mixed fruit juice.
The spicy chicken pizza was unpretentious in the sense that it was exactly what it said it would be. Lots of spicy chicken and no vegetables whatsoever. We loved it! The iced mocha with the whipped cream was pretty amazing. The pasta and the juice were pretty good too

It's located in Sudder Street, off the main road.If you are familier with the shop 'Sunshine' then you can find this place very easily.The place is usually crowded with foreigners.Heard quite a lot about this cafe,so me and my friend went there with lots of expectations, but it was a major disappointment.

We Ordered : Affogato,Fresh Lime Soda,Contadina Pizza and Soufflé Di Cioccolato.

Fresh lime soda was the worst thing I have ever had.It lacked the amount of salt and sweet,basically they served just a glass of plain soda to us.
Contadina pizza was decent with  lots of cheese, but the flavour of rosemary was so strong that we barely could taste other ingredients.
The only thing we liked was the Souffle.It was a great combination of hot chocolate with vanilla ice-cream.

The food wasn't up-to the mark.Service was okay.The person serving us was unaware of most of their items and offered us a pad to write down the order.
I don't not really want to come back to this place again.........

Situated in the bylanes of sudder Street. Coming to this place made me realise that I am a foreigner here.
They have an outer seating area and an inner one. All their fans were slow. The walls were scribbled by many travellers. They have an international plugpoint.

 I ordered a chicken burrito here. I didn't like it much. It was basically a roti with a filling of chicken and sauteed onions and some spice. To me it seemed a roti chicken roll and it costed me 200/-. I didn't order further. They had WiFi and on asking for the password they took an ID proof for security purpose I guess but no other restaurants ask for an ID proof. The waiter took my ID card away and returned after several minutes. When I wished to pay my bill via my debit card, they took me to a handicrafts shop just beside the cafe. They said they don't have their own swipe machines. 
These things seemed very fishy to me.

A nice chilled out place at sudder street. Ordered a bruschetaa(misfire: bread toast with chopped tomatoes)  and a veg thin crust pizza(their speciality). Incredible pizza. Will give Domino's pizza Hut a run for their money. Pizza is a must. Sufficient for two. 
The ambience doesn't feel like kolkata anymore. Hippies paradise. Do order right. Go by the one serving you. He'll guide you through. Will come back for the Lasagne and the highly recommended soufflé. A place you must visit. A nice find thanks to zomato.

Rajendra prasad pal's Taverna Vasca or better known as Raj Spanish Cafe is one of the members of zomato's elite hidden gems , and those who have been there might just whole heartedly agree to it . With a wide variety of cuisines ranging from Spanish, Mexican to widely popular thin crust pizzas this little joint has been the heart and soul of dharmatala for years now . Today we were in the mood of a hearty Spanish meal and henceforth we ventured to the ever so busy sudder street for our evening snack .

° Location :- Okay so not really the easiest to find but let me give you a clear idea . Take the lane left to the Indian museum the one which has the zaranj restaurant in the beginning. You will walk straight from there . You will pass the Lytton hotel , the fairlawns and almost at the end of the lane ,inside a gali in your left you will come across this cafe .

° Ambience & service :- Not the best of ambience as it does not have AC. They have tablefans and a small outdoor seating space with a capacity of 10.  Inside is not huge either but not that bad for a couple outing . There is a single cost seating in the middle of the cafe where most people try to take the seats.  But we managed a table for us and it was not that bad . Service is really quick and commendable . Our lassi was not cold, so on asking they provided with a glass of ice .

° Food :- Although it boasts a wide variety of cuisines , it is the Spanish flavor which attracts a lot of attention from all over the city . The place always has a number of foreigners mostly Spanish to get a taste of their native food in this part of the city . We had the following :- 

----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Huevo Rellenos ( 4 / 5 ) :- Interesting the name , tasty the dish.  These are tuna fish mixed with tomato sauce and egg yolk and topped with mayonese . They serve 6 pieces if these , and trust me they are so flavorful that they will simply burst inside your mouth . You could almost feel the fish inside the ohh so tasty sauce and since the whole thing is on too of an egg it is bound to be tasty . This can be found only here and I think everyone should try these atleast once.  

2. Albondigos en salsa esplanda ( 4 / 5 ) :- This is the superstar dish from this place and rightly so . These are 4 pieces of meatballs cooked in a very light but flavorful gravy consisting of coriender , tomato , pepper . The only thing missing from this dish is that it is not spicy.  But my god, it is so damn tasty . The meatballs are just yummy , not heavy served with French fries this dish can just uplift you mood anyday . A must try for every foodie . The toast could have been buttered but still the meatballs were tasty enough to make my meal a pleasant one . You have got to try this to know more .

3. Mango & Choco lassi ( 3 / 5 ) :- Seems to me that drinks and coolers are not their strong zone . They lacked sugar and ice . They good part is they have lots of sugar sachets on the table so you can add that to your liking. And in requesting they will provide you with the ice.  The taste was not bad though but I think a cold drink would just have been the better option. 

4 . Ice cream ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Named ice cream to be frankly are 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream which will leave you happy at the end of your meal .

----------------------------------------------------------------

Following points are to be noted :- 

1. Finger licking and cheap Spanish food.
2. Wide variety of cuisines.
3. Thin crust pizza is very popular here .
4. No taxes , so a hearty meal with minimum fuss in the pocket .
5 . One of the hidden gems you should not miss out.


With so many choices you are bound to be confused at times with you selection.  But since the hidden gems are akways the first choices , this joint with its side variety of cuisines and cheaper prices is bound to attract you . If you are one of those who still have not try , it's a must for you . As for me , i am going back again someday for the pizzas .

This place is a hidden gem. Cool ambiance and the not so common menu is the reason we love this cafe. To begin with we love the Mediterranean salad here. Looks basic. And it is, before you mix the feta cheese that comes as a topping. We ask for an extra serving of feta and the result is amazing.
The pastas here are good too, but a little bland for Indians. I think it is kept that way for the foreigners, staying nearby, who love this place. But you will find condiments on the table. Add them to make it more spicy.
Another favourite of ours here is the Huevo Rellenos. Basically deviled eggs (not the Bengali crumb fried dimer devil) with tuna.
Since they introduced pizzas, this place has become a favourite for pizzas too. Love their perfect thin crust pizzas.
To end on a sweet note their Soufle is a must try. Those big branded places selling choco lava cakes must come and see what molten chocolate dessert should be like.

Tucked away in a bylane at Sudder Street this place might be a little hard to find. I've passed by it several times in my quest for quirky clothes for everyday wear and decided to try it out one day. We ordered sandwiches and a chocolate souffle. The food was great and so was the service. The decor was especially unique. I'll surely drop by again, tired and hungry after a bout of combing through the shops at Sudder street.

A friend and I visited this place this Monday. We absolutely loved the place. Mostly frequented by foreigners, this place serves the best pasta I've had in recent times. We went for the Italian food menu. We ordered Lasagna De Pollo (fried pasta with chicken and mushrooms literally drowned in white sauce and shredded cheese). Plus the iced mocha with the whipped cream on top just won us over! And the cute dog which roams around here and there made me go "Awww..." I noticed the white-in-blue world map printed tent above our heads used in the outdoor sitting arrangement and the wall-arts just said so much for world food patrons. I'm planning to go there again to try their Spanish food.

Heard quite a lot about this cafe but it was a major disappointment. The food wasn't upto the mark. Service wasn't good. The food lacked salt or any kind of flavour. Basically it was tastless. We ordered tortilla de patatas and albondigas. Both didn't live up to the standards. Going through the reviews once again I think it would have been better if we had stuck to lasagne or pizzas.

Placed a delivery order with them online via zomato. Ordering was crisp & simple & i'm confident that many people can use this online ordering system with ease.Though raj cafe is about 5 minutes walk from my office the delivery took about 30 minutes.Coming back to the food,ordered pasta in white sauce with chicken & mushroom.I must admit that the cheese sauce was delicious & seasoning was very balanced.I'm bit particular about cheese sauce since i find it bland if not made properly.In this occasion i was happy with the sauce.There were chicken dices & mushroom in correct proportion to the pasta.Portioning was in sync with pricing.Only i wish if they could provide sachets of oregano & chili flakes on delivery.Worth trying but. Bonn ape tit.

After hearing a lot about this place, I visited with few of my friends. It's basically a place where you can sit down and chill with friends. Also this was probably the first time I tried Spanish cuisine. We ordered Ensalada mixta, Empanadas de pollo and coffee and tea. Food was decent. Ambience was a very good kind of different. I won't really mind going back to this place again. :)

With wonderful homely meals and their special freshly made pizza - raj Spanish cafe lives up to its famed reputation. What really adds to the food is the ambience. As you enter the place your eyes are immediately drawn to the walls adorned with words from travellers who have visited raj in different points of time. What further adds to the experience is the staff - who are incredibly friendly with lots of passion and dedication to their work. They kept on asking me whether the food was good and also recommended items I should consider. They left me with an extremely good experience with a yearning to go back sometime in the future.

This is truely a hidden gem in Kolkata. I wonder how it took me so long to discover this place. The ambience may not be rich like all the other cafés in the city but this one is one of a kind. It makes you feel at home and allows you to sit as you wish and also makes you more comfortable by letting you make your own order bill. The walls are doodled with people from all over the country and also features a book self consisting of books and diaries from many ends of the world. The café is mostly a spot for the foreign tourists and brings out the hippy culture. It's located off the Sudder Street and is famous by a word of the mouth. 
The food here is good too. The lumpsum amount of cheese perfectly baked with chicken and pasta makes the dish wonderful and is also filling at very reasonable rates.
 Do drop in if you're here in Kolkata.

I was in the New Market area for some shopping, while I got a call for an important mail to be sent asap. I briskly took to Zomato to find a cafe nearby and sit and do my job. I found this place, and went for it.
Its located in Sudder Street, off the main road. Its quite an old cafe. It has both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements. However, the inside is non air conditioned. They have tables and chairs for seating arrangements mostly, on one side there are sofa seats too. The cafe has a book shelf too, with various English and Spanish books. They have wifi available for their customers which is a help. I used it yesterday, but they check ur Id card before you are aloowed to use the wifi. The cafe is mostly crowded with foreign crowd and tourists. The cafe is quite spacious. On one side is the kitchen and cash counter area. The walls are doodled with various imageries, texts, tags and all various things written all over in black. Over all the cafe g
I was in a hurry. In a brisk of time, I just ordered for a Cheese Sandwich and an Iced Tea, while I was busy doing my work. The service is quite moderate, and the people serving here knows exactly what the customer needs and are friendly and welcoming.
Liked it! 
The Cheese Sandwich arrived first. They used brown bread, lightly toasted, served with little butter and a cheese layer with shredded cheese all over. It was okayish. Actually I was thinking to order something else, and somehow in a hurry ordered this by mistake. My bad!!
The Iced Tea was served with a tea bag dipped in a glass of chilled water, with lemon flavours and ice. It was little extra sweet! Otherwise it tasted quite decent.
The prices are very cheap and pocket-friendly.
I would come to the place sooner to explore more and try out more of their dishes in the Spanish menu.

A great place to sit and chill with friends. The food is very moderately priced. I love their wood fire pizzas, specially the fungi. Their Lasagne is amazing too. However, their fried ice-cream wasn't very appealing. The soggy cornflakes layer drizzled with chocolate and strawberry syrup didn't really make me happy.

Raj's is among the choicest cosy casual cafes in the city. Located close to the end of Sudder St. that opens into the Fire Brigade Headquarters, the place is likely to be swarming with foreigners at any point of the day. While the thin crust pizza (Pizza Funghi) was delectable, we were informed that they were only available on the menu after 4 PM. The Spanish dishes (Pan Tomaca and Patatas Bravas) stood true to the description, offering a rare opportunity to delve into an underappreciated cuisine at reasonable rates. The pineapple juice and fresh lime soda were worthy accompaniments, but all the fresh juices (read: Orange) listed on the menu should be made available. The Chocolate Soufle was yum and should not be missed. The service is polite, but needs to be quicker, whereas the value-for-money quotient is high.

The walls make for a distinguishable decor, orders are to be penned down, and smoking is (by the looks of it) tolerated. Hip and recommended.

Did not like it at all. Heard about this place a lot so ordered one Ensalada templada salad as I love sea food . . . The amount of the salad was so less according to the price.The taste was bad . They just don't know how to make salad. Gave this place another try .. ordered a different salad again the next time . . Same thing . Bad. Didn't feel like trying any other food. This place is over hyped.

A very cozy cafe with great food, depicting the very vibrance of Sudder Street. You can actually sit with your legs folded, or lay down, or read a book which having a nice brunch or a quick meal. Also they have a nice billboard where you may leave messages. Most of the items on the menu are carefully chosen and are pretty delicious. Interesting breakfast menu with cinnamon rolls, choice of pancakes, sandwiches, toasts, muffins, croissants are lovely to begin the day with with a nice cup of coffee or a smoothie. Banana & nutella pancake is my favourite one. The other dishes that I'd recommend are, the various types of thin crust pizzas they offer, lasagna, chicken and egg wrap, fried seafood salad, guacamole, parfait and souffle. Don't forget to order the boiled egg stuffed with tuna and mayonnaise.

"If you have to go fast, go alone; but if you have to go farther, go together."(from the walls of Raj Spanish Cafe)

Awesome place to hangout wid friends...especially when you are looking for some authentic Italian,Mexican or Spanish food at reasonable rate. The ambience is cool with foreigners crowding in and one liners scribbled all around.Me and my buddy had been planning a visit to this place for a long time...nd finally made it...nd truly speaking it was worthy of it. We ordered chicken lasania...it was the best one till now that i have come across in kolkata. I would say one plate is enough for 2 people...which we misjudged by ordering 2..nd we were so full that we couldn't taste the other dishes which we had planned for. But surely gonna visit this place asap to try out the other dishes.

Souffle nd tiramisu are the best desserts available here and anywhere in kolkata...

Very hard to locate this..Proved its worth as hidden gem..Authentic continental food is available and in true sense..Ambience is so so, a bit nostalgic for some people but for others it's absolutely worthless..I find a dog enjoying it's nap adjacent my chair..Care should be taken about this.. If you don't want to pay 3% extra transaction tax keep enough cash in wallet..I went to enjoy the food and got as my expectation so it's 3.5/5...Otherwise it would be 1.5/5...

Visited this place a couple of times. It lives upto its name.It's Spanish in the true sense of the word. It has a kinda hippie atmosphere.Located in a corner of the anglo-Indian locale of Sudder Street, i.e. the alley just beside the Indian Museum, it serves mostly Spanish dishes. Many foreigners throng this place. The walls are full of cool graffiti n you can as well write anything on the walls from some quotes to marking your visit to the place on the walls.The service is ok. The food is also okayish. I had tuna sandwich, honey pancakes,tortillas as well as cafe latte on my visits. What is unique about this place is its Spanish outlook in a cosmopolitan city which harbours fish-loving Bengalis mostly. If you are passing by Sudder Street, you may pay a visit to taste something new, something Spanish. :)

To be honest, I didn't like the place much. Went there last week, very difficult to locate. The place bears a close resemblance to Israeli cafes in Kasol, quite popular among foreigners. The place had both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements with nothing much to say about the ambiance. Although they had scribbles from visitors all over their wall, which apparently is the only interesting part of my story. 

Instead of ordering food having strange names, we opted for familiar dishes :
Cappuccino and mocha latte - Good.
Nutella Pancake - Tasted okay. 

The only Spanish dish we ordered :
Huevo Rellenos - Tasted good, nothing extraordinary. This is a simple dish of boiled eggs with a twist. 

For desserts we ordered fried ice cream, but they were out of the dish so they suggested us some curd dish (forgot the name). Tasted similar to home made kheer with right amount of sweetness in it. 

Moreover this is a pocket friendly one, but there are definitely better options in new market to fill your appetite without causing much damage to your wallet.

So glad i stumbled upon this amazing place! 'Off-beat' culinary experience in Kolkata that is probably more known to people from all over the world but hidden from Kolkattans :) you will find only foreigners there...and the way they flock to it is proof of how authentic and hygienic the food is. VERY REASONABLE...personalized service by the committed and friendly owner. Have become a fan. Bill for 2 ....Rs 390....do visit!

It was my last birthday when I abruptly stumbled into Raj Spanish Cafe. A cafe with absolutely no Indians was weird for me in the first place but the owner is so damn welcoming, interactive and co-operative that we went really comfortable.He even allowed my friends to get the cake which they all had planned. 

We opted for some weird dishes that actually none of us liked. Mainly cause one of it contained Tuna and I strongly dislike Tuna. What we liked the most is chicken lasagna suggested by the owner which turned out to be awesome. The drinks are more or less okay. There's a buzz in the city that they prepare good pizzas but it is available only after 4 pm so we couldn't try that out.

Totally loved the ambience. We interacted almost with everybody in the cafe and had a fantastic afternoon keeping few dishes aside. Would go back to explore more!

Shopping sessions at Sunshine are often followed by eating out at Raj Spanish or at Blue Sky. I prefer the latter more as they charge comparatively less and also have a wider variety of non veg items which I thinks this place misses out. Though calls themselves a cafe it's more of a restaurant. I have been here just once and I was not much satisfied by the spread. So, I decided not to visit again.
Had the Chicken and Mushroom Pasta in White Creamy Sauce. It was good. The sauce was thick and creamy with ample amount of chicken and mushroom. But I took the points down mainly because of the ambiance and the spread as I didn't like it much personally.

The best thing about Raj Spanish Cafe is the fact that you can see writings by people from all over the world, since this place is visited by a lot of tourists. It is quite affordable for college students on a budget. Coming to the menu, we decided to experiment with a lot of different dishes. Some of them were really good- The chocolate fondant cake, the pizza and the Chicken combo, the Chicken and mushroom pasta. The riso salad, flan, potato salad were not upto the mark.

Disappointing. Location is good and is nearby Blue Sky Cafe. The sitting arrangement is good as well with a quirky wall and painted scribbling all over it. Service is fast but the people serving are mostly unaware of their products and offers a pad o write down the order. Took a Lasange and a Egg Yolk dish for parcel. When I went back home, the Lasagne was all dry and was like a hard and chewy rock. The tuna mixture along with the egg yolk had gone sour. In short, a complete wastage of money.

Located off sudder street , at a nondescript gully, although the place is more famous by word of mouth than its geographical location... Quite an informal place with open air seating arrangements with the walls having scribbled memoirs of foreigners n Indians alike with bittersweet experiences of Calcutta and the cafe. Ordered  burritos, lemon n cinnamon pancake and coffee bonbon, not exactly over the top but definitely  likeable. Be on the lookout for a friendly dog or two ( adorable!!! To say the least and don't be surprised with their friendly overtures , surely a change from the classy hangout places in Calcutta) . Easy on the pocket and would suggest a visit..

This place is located in the Sudder street alley, almost at the end of it. The place looks okay, and is a regular place for many college students and foreigners alike. 

But I would really like to point out somethings here :
*Food*
Things have gone from okay to just bad at this joint. When you walk into this place that you've heard of so much everywhere,  you expect decent good food. But what we got served today was nowhere close to good. 
We ordered The Chicken Oligo funghi pizza,  which looked good, cheese was fresh but the mushroom was old and tasted very bitter. Gave a bad smell to the pizza. That pizza for @me was a complete disaster. 
We then took a Chicken Lasagne.  I have had lasganes in many places,  and this probably has to the worst one. The pasta sheets were too thick, and over baked. In some bites,  it tasted weird and not like what a lasgane should be. 
Next things we ordered were a Chicken Burger and A Chicken salad, and they were just okay.  
The watermelon and pineapple juice we ordered were fresh but had less amount of sugar.  
I don't expect food to be 'out of the world ',  brilliant here, but making fresh stuff would go a long way. I really feel that this place is overrated for the quality of food served.

“Phirangipara” this is the name given in the all colloquial solitude among the desis to the well,,, “phirangis” in the Sudder Street of Kolkata,,, beside the very famous Astoria Hotel... The reason is not reason enough for you to frequent the place or to choose otherwise..... It invites a huge foreign crowd owing to their dominance in the area, which in turn, makes sure the cafe dishes out the best breakfast in Kolkata....
Well, for starters the taste is not Indianised to suit the local palate,,,, nd most importantly you get some of the most lip smacking Mexican nd Italian grub right here in dollops,,,, besides the Spanish Omelette,,,, which is an absolute roller coaster by itself....

Heard a lot about it, finally paid a visit to this joint on my list. Located in the lane of sudder Street, thanks to G-Maps! Now talking about ambience, it has two options to make yourself comfortable, one inside and other outside. Inside decor nothing wow about anything but yes thanks to the lovely people from all over the world who visited this place etched there memories as graffiti on the orangy wall (till you get your ordered served, you can go through the wall,lolz). Talking about food ordered Spinaci (thin crust wood fire pizza loaded with blanched spinach, cheese and pizza sauce), Spaghetti Al Pesto and Earl Grey Tea. Pizza was light, yummy, creamy and tastes so well. On the other hand spaghetti was a bit rough and raw, but mixed well in pesto sauce. Overall I enjoyed the ambience,people and food. Definitely visiting this place again & again. You rock! Serving Hot!

After a long wait had the opportunity to visit Raj Spanish Cafe. After shopping in new market area hunger pangs struck us. It is very easy to locate. Thanks to Google Maps!!
Ambience is very hippie and chilled out. But it's very badly ventilated. Food was great. It compensated the uneasiness of the sultry weather. We ordered Spinaci Pizza, it was a wood fire pizza. Then we had Spaghetti Al Pesto. It's supposed to be Al Dante but I find it uncooked. Pesto sauce was great. We finished it with Sprite and Earl Grey tea. Will definitely come again for some more as they have a tempting and a long menu.

Raj Spanish Cafe is very tricky to spot. Even with Google Maps and Zomato, you need local help to ultimately reach this cafe. Continental foods are the only options, and if you don't know what to order you are in trouble. We took a hell lot of time to balance between the cost and the food descriptions provided and order something. But well, finally went for Banana Pancake and Nutella Pancake as firstly, we didn't know what to order and secondly, high price for not so appealing food description. But we were not disappointed with the pancakes, which were really tasty. You need to write down the order in the bill yourself and they don't arrive to help you choose from the menu either. Ambience was that of a foreign road-side restaurant, walls totally scribbled from roof to floor. Will have to know and learn about continental foods and then I would love to visit this place again in future to try out the continental menu. But till then a rating of 6.5 out of 10 for this cafe.

There are two ways you can make your food experience good here
1. Develop a taste for spanish mexican food
2. Order right. 
Since i did not know much about spanish food, i went ahead and ordered a bunch if things hoping it would taste good. And something's did not disappoint 
For drinks we took iced mocha , chocolate lassi, lemon honey soda. Everything was fine
And for bites we has the enchiladas verdes (mexican) and two spanish dishes hueva rellenos (eggs with tuna and tomato sauce) and tortilla de patatas. Liked the first two but the tortilla de patatas was basically boiled egg and mashed potato with bread. R
My first option was Espinas salteadus which was unavailable. 
The ambiance is cool. You can chill here for hours. The service was fast. You can spend half of your time reading the books available or reading the notes on the wall by people all over the world i guess. I would hope they add more non veg dishes. 
My recommendations : chocolate lassi , honey lemon soda , enchilladas verdes and heuvo rellenos.

Tucked inconspicuously beside a garment shop in Sudder street, Raj Spanish cafe promises to offer a unique eating experience. It is a small joint, with bright orange walls filled with scribblings in different languages. The place had quite a few foreigners, which is always a good thing to see in any restaurant serving serving continental fare. There was a bookshelf stuffed with all kinds of books, some in foreign languages, for our reading pleasure. The place has a self-serving policy, in which we write down the names of the dishes along with quantity on a piece of paper and hand it over to the waiter. Pretty fuss-free in my opinion. And when the food finally arrived,we were not at all disappointed. 

We initially wanted the chikoo lassi but they did not have it, so we opted for pineapple instead, and it did not disappoint. The cool creaminess of the yoghurt was perfectly offset by the sharp flavour of the pineapple. The tortilla de patatas was simple and clean in its flavours, and yet extremely moreish. The cannelloni was lovely, with the richness of its ricotta and spinach filling cut through by the tang of the tomato sauce. The eggplant parmigiana was my personal favourite, with tender pieces of eggplant, tomato sauce and the crispy crumbly texture of the parmesan and breadcrumb mixture (I presume). Although we had ordered the enchilada verdes, they mistakenly served us the lasagne de verduras instead. It was okayish, but not over the top in my opinion, as the flavour of the capsicum overpowered the entire dish.

For dessert, we had the souffle di cioccolato. When it reaches the table, it looks like an unpretentious cupcake with a blob of vanilla ice cream on the side. But once you cut it with the knife, out oozes a hot and rich chocolate sauce, and the dish changes entirely. With the hot, rich chocolate contrasting with the cool, creamy vanilla, it is a satisfying dessert indeed.Now coming to a few cons. The service is not quite up to the mark. They served us a wrong dish and had forgotten to bring the dessert at first and needed reminding. Also, their plating needs a bit of work. But overall the experience was satisfying. The pocket pinch is extremely reasonable. There are a lot of dishes still left untried and I will definitely go back to try them out.

Worst dining experience ever! Thanks to the man at the front! He might think he's some kind of a dude and his words are funny, but he's just a cheap maniac. Never have I ever had a Worse experience anywhere. Oh By the way, they microwave the food. So goodbye to this shit.

REVIEW-I
I've been shopping at  Sunshine stores for quite a while now, but couldn't manage to go to this cafe! However last Valentine's Day we decided to find out if it's as good as it sounds. And yes, it was. The ambiance of a laid back teenager's room with graphiti all over was appealing. The staff is fun.
We ordered the Chicken Burger with was quite wholesome but they used fried chicken breast instead of the patty. It was quite delicious. The Empanadas de Pollo was a bit of a let down. It seemed over fried and under seasoned. The hands down winner was Enchiladas Verdes,with ample filling and ample cheese,this is the go to dish! Their Honey Lemon Soda is simply brilliant.
This cafe has intrigued me,and will definitely come again for more!

A little difficult to locate, but precisely opposite Hotel Maria on Sudder street. The weather was terribly hot today and it was around 3p.m that we wanted to go, so before going we checked on zomato whether the place is air conditioned or not. According to zomato it has a.c, but actually it doesn't. So that was a disappointment! The place is really cool with all the graffiti walls and decors, but we probably went there on the wrong day! To beat the heat we ordered water melon juice which was fresh and refreshing. Then we ordered a tofu caesar salad and enchiladas verdes. The latter was nice while the former one was really dry. Overall, a nice place to hangout on a not-so-hot day! Oh and yes, you get to write down your own orders. Surely going to visit again!

This is a "hidden" gem for sure! Had to walk quite a bit to find it. They have parking for two wheelers inside the compound in which it is located. The place has outdoor seating and the walls are covered with messages from people that have visited. It reminds me of an unkept PG and is quite dirty. I had to wipe my table with a tissue paper and the hallway leading to the toilet is without a roof and ac vents regularly spew water onto the table nearest to the hallway.
 They do not have pizza in the afternoon which is when I stopped by with a friend. So we ordered the chicken lasagne and the chicken burger. Lasagne was filling but the ingredients were not fresh and we could not finish it as it had a rather odd after taste. The chicken burger was a joke. Undercooked sliver of crumbed chicken swallowed by two buns that can be picked up at any local store. No dressing and the fries that came along were straight out of a freezer. And the oil used for frying was stale. The burger came with a coke as well.
We also ordered an iced latte which was strong on the coffee flavour but very watery in consistency. 
We left too disappointed to try desert although the soufflé is worth a try.

Though the first visit wasn’t one I loved, me being a regular visitor of New Market, visited this place many times again over the years. And now I have discovered what I should order here. Their teas and pizza after a long shopping session is what has become a routine now.

The place is thronged by students and travellers and the graphiti messages all over their wall from people all over the world is really interesting. In fact this is a place where you can interact with a good mix of people, and the owner himself is a friendly man too.
                                                                ...

Went there a few weeks back.. It's truly a hidden gem coz you have to depend a lot on Google maps to actually find this place. After searching for almost half an hour I actually discovered this awesome joint which is located in a garage-like area. 
Well, the ambience is quite cozy and comfortable with light music playing at the background. Nothing special about the decor though, there's this wall full of scribblings made my other visitors I guess. 
I ordered a mix of Italian, Spanish and Mexican, the three cuisines for which this place is actually famous. For starter I had Huevo rellenos and a Polo e funghi pizza. 
Huevo rellenos(Spanish) is actually tuna and a bit of tomato sauce mixed with the egg yolks and topped with mayonnaise. It's really delicious as the combination of tuna, tomato sauce and mayonnaise tickles your taste buds. 
On the other hand polo e funghi(Mexican) was a chicken and mushroom thin crust pizza, very tasty and worth the money. 
I also tried pasta aglio olio(Italian) which is simply pasta fried in extra virgin olive oil with capsicum and garlic. 
Will visit this cafe yet again to try out their other delicious items.

This is really a hidden gem in the new market area. Try to enter from the simpark mall side and search for the shop "sunshine". The cafe is in that complex only.  The cafe is absolutely non fussy. You can see thank you notes from travellers in different languages on the walls of the cafe. 
-------
There are a lot of exotic options available in terms of dishes. You get an option to choose from Spanish, Mexican and Italian dishes.
We had "spaghetti frute di mare" , "pollo cheese lasagna", 2 cokes, and a iced cafe latte. The spaghetti was filled with ample sea food and was a welcome for my spice hungry palate. It might seem a bit bland if you prefer spicy food. The lasagna was also tasty. The iced cafe latte was just the right taste. Not too sugary sweet.
-----
Ambience was great... the Cafe had a very laid back feel to it. You get too see a lot of travelers of varied origins hanging out and chilling out there. Service was prompt and the staff was courteous enough to explain us our order.

Certainly one of the best pizza joints of the city. Located at sudder street, this small cafe serves good quality Italian, Mexican food along with mocktails and ice creams. The walls are decorated with interesting graphic art works. The food is delicious and the service is quick. Overall, 4.0/5.0.

This place is truly a hidden gem. Tiny and cosy place with WiFi and outdoor seating the food is awesome the funny thing is they give you a tiny pad to write down your order they don't charge taxes the place mainly caters to the foreigners who come and stay in one of those nearby hotels we had pasta n chocolate soufle! Lip smacking!

Really hidden...but once you find it get busy to experiment with food and pizzas (available only in the evening s) without burning a hole in your pocket... A very interesting place to visit occupied by a crowd speaking different languages and walls filled with doodles and graffitis.. 
I got lucky once when they even had organized a special sushi night long back... 
A place for the ones who love to experience and experiment.

Visiting Spanish cafe has been on my list for quite a long time, and because I've heard enough good reviews of this place, i had my expectations soaring high. Maybe that is the reason why I found it a bit ordinary when i finally checked it off my list.
But let me also tell you that, this is a great place if you want 'real' pizza and spanish mexican dishes.
The food: We ordered ensalada con pollo, lasagna de verduras con pollo, a basic thin crust pizza, spaghetti al pesto and cafe mocha. Not just authentic names but pure true italian, mexican, spanish food. The dishes were delicious; though not as spicy as we are accustomed to (of course) and the pizza, nothing like those of our indianised pizza hut and dominoes. 
The ambience is quite lively, the decor simple yet eye-catching (the orange wall). The service is quick, good; the people very helpful and friendly. Plus hassle-free free wifi.  A warm and cosy place , I'll definitely recommend it and I'll be visiting again soon.

Raj Spanish Cafe is a bit difficult to locate, but the fact that it is located in a populated place yet hidden from plain sight is perhaps somewhat responsible for its uniqueness.  Looking like a completely hippy joint, and with only foreigners smoking, reading or just plain chatting, the cafe looks straight out of a Woody Allen film. The walls have inscriptions and graffiti in varied languages, probably done by it's multilingual and multicultural patrons, that certainly adds to the charm. There are book shelves which however have books written in languages I am not proficient in. The fact that it looks disheveled and slightly dirty further add to the hippie mood. 
 
The food is rather good too. Mostly continental, but they serve a few tex-mex and American junk food as well. Also almost everything from their varied menu is available as well. 
If you are in the mood for some food adventure, this is the place.

Authentic Spanish and Mexican food at reasonable prices. Their chocolate soufflé is like an extra helping of pure bliss. Amazing staff too. My favorite thing about this cafe are the comfy couches where you can make yourself really comfortable while you relish the food. If you're in the Esplanade area, not visiting this place would be a sin.

Not so good.
Went there few days back and it was humid and hot afternoon, and no AC!
One wall painting is there,which will surely attract you. This cafe is bit different, we sat outside.
I found price is over the margin. Pasta with white sauce & chicken makes you to count 220₹ . preparation is good. Non veg items are few in numbers.
May be one should try pizza, one friend told , they are good for pizzas!

After some work at Esplanade, We went to Spanish Cafe at afternoon... Finding the restaurant was most difficult task... So take the help of GPS ...
The place was literally filled with foreigners...
Decoration was not so eye catching... it's a small cafe with a vast variety of typical Spanish , Mexican and Italian Dishes...
We ordered

Burrito (Mexican)
Pasta Con Polo E Funghi (Italian)
Huevo Rellenos (Spanish)
Honey Lemon Soda
Fresh Lemon Soda

Burrito was actually lots of spices & chicken stuffed in Roti and really scrumptious... Pasta was good and filled with lots of mayonnaise and chicken and mushrooms... Huevo Rellenos was egg stuffed with yolks, cheese, mayonnaise and spices... Sodas were average...
But the service was not so fast ... we had to wait for 15 minutes after giving order...
But the price is very low...

Okay so let's it keep it simple. It's a very simple place and you will mostly find backpackers here. It really is a cafe where people are sitting and chilling. Food is basic no frills but some times simple is good. I love their wood burn pizza and would go back for that. Little difficult to locate but call them up and they will be happy to assist. :)

An awesome place frequented mostly by foreigners nestled at a corner of Sudder Street. This place serves authentic continental food. We only tried the chocolate pancakes this time which were awesome. However I am surely trying their pizzas and the lasagna here next time. Food, the ambiance and the staff are extremely good. Prices are very moderate! Loved it!

Another place which has oodles of character. The sheer variety of people and the food transforms this poky little eatery tucked away from prying eyes into something else altogether. The humble and down to earth nature of the owner Raj, the courteous staff, the dog Lulu and obviously the food will keep you coming back for more. The wood fired pizzas are a must have, especially the pollo e funghi and tonne e cipolle if you are a tuna fan. For dessert the chocolate souffle is sublime and you can try the pancakes as well. If you are feeling down the honey lemon ginger tea is an instant pick me up and variety of people you can meet and have interesting conversations with makes it a favourite. One look at the wall and you are sold.

The overall appearance right from the dingy entrance to a (seemingly stray)pet dog puts one off.If you're adventurous enough to brave all this and actually try the food you won't be disappointed.The menu is detailed enough for both food connoisseurs and people new to European cuisine.I had tried the seafood spaghetti,pasta al pomodoro,Spanish chicken meatballs with a side of fries and the signature chocolate souffle.
The showstealer was definitely the meatball dish.The meatballs are such a far cry from the koftas we're used to.The gravy is light,the fries crispy but the dry slice of bread was the chink in the otherwise perfect dish.The seafood spaghetti had enough seafood(prawns and squid)and was tasty but as you're halfway through,the seafood flavour and distinctive smell becomes overpowering.I recommend that one plate should be shared by 2 both as far as quantity and flavour punch is concerned.The simple red sauce pasta was really tasteless and I had to uncharacteristically douse it in mustard to make it palatable.
When one cuts into the chocolate souffle,warm chocolate sauce gushes out and that's the gastronomical equivalent of a baby's smile(as Barney Stinson would say).These people don't concentrate much on the presentation but small additions like presence of various condiments and olive oil on each table are good initiatives.
I say this place deserves a second visit just for the Spanish chicken meatball dish and the chocolate souffle.

After hearing a hell lot of mixed reviews dropped in last evening with a friend who was constantly vouching for this place! The walls of the place is what I liked, though we had to sit outside for our sheer need of smoking! ( pardon ). We ordered lasagne de verdurus and enchiladas verdes and honey lemon ginger tea! Lasagne was the best one I ever had, though it was stuffed with blanched spinach I would love to taste the nonveg variety, and filling too, such generous amount of good quality cheese is what I loved the most! I am not a big fan of Mexican food but yet we tried enchiladas, ( not much different from Kolkata kati roll) topped with ricotta <3 
The tea tasted nice but different! I might visit the place few times more 😊

Must try the soufflé here.

This was one of the hidden gems of zomato that was actually in my list for a long time...
So one day after semester I went there with my buddies... Location is towards the end of Sudder street... Doesn't look impressive at first look.... But actually they surprise you with their menus and food....
So we ordered Ensalada templada in salads..Burrito from Mexican dishes...Chicken Lasagna and Melanzane alla parmigiana from Italian dishes.. Iced mocha in chillers...and an Earl grey tea.
The salad was luscious and healthy... Fried octopuses, squids, prawn tossed over a bed of oil sautéed spinach in such low price! Amazing.
It offers one of the best chicken lasagnas of the city! Alla parmigiana is another form of lasagna with eggplant instead of chicken...quite toothsome!
Burrito has a tangy taste like indi-foods..
Each and every dish was perfect! Loved the cafe. :)

The place is located in Sudder Street and needs a bit of searching but once you are there you can find your self surrounded with foreigners admist lip smacking food.

The servers are polite and good. The menu is vast and contains dishes from all over Europe. I have been here once and tried the sea food pasta. Must say it was a delight. The interiors are pretty hip with messages and graffiti done by the guests.

You can find a very relaxed atmosphere here and bump into a foreigner who would talk to you about the art n music in their country over a joint.

Great time wid great frnds and at great restaurant... Raj Spanish cafe...tucked away in small lanes of sudder street...not so lavish restaurant just simple. From the first minute till last minute we spend there was awesome.
         We ordered chicken lasanga, tortilla De patatas, empanadas De pollo,enchiladas verdes, pasta con pollo e funghi, paneer combo, chicken combo, huevo rellenos and burrito. In dessert we ordered soufflé, brownie, chocolate pancake and hot chocolate. All these items were delicious.. But the must try item is chicken lasanga, empanadas De pollo, soufflé and brownie. 
          At last we ordered hot chocolate, that was very disappointed. It was tasted like a bournvita...so I must appeal to everyone do not order hot chocolate..
At last I can say that if anyone want to tast some unique food and if want to taste other than chienese and north Indian food then raj Spanish cafe must be the great option for them.

Here, the environment is what counts. And of course the fact that you will find authentic Spanish food here, which is otherwise difficult to find in the city. They make nice Italian too, in fact.  If you like dogs, and a nice quite place where you can sit and work using their free WiFi, or have a nice time with friends, over good food, Spanish Café is the place to come to. Not to mention it has Sunshine next to it, so shopping can be an added bonus :)

After so many hurdles we had rest behind everything and should say "Main Hua kamyab"  sorry not "Main" its "Hum" not "Honge" "Its Hum hue kamyab". To reach out this eatery. Since November'15.
After so many mixed reviews in Zomato about this eatery we had decided to "Spent our Pocket Here".

Lazawab khana.. Ohh it's foreigners den and continental cuisine i should say its awesome food they are serving here.. But u have to selective here about ur food here.. Or u can ask from there cashier-cum-server. They are really good about the explanation of ur food. 

We had tried out Mexican,Italian,Spanish all of three here.. Chicken lasanga is must tried out dish there. Every bite u taking inside its like it is melting in ur mouth and reaching in ur stomach.. Felling like u r in heaven ohh its awesome the smell and the quantity of cheese is dominating.. As well as dominating in all of there food... And in dessert 🍨 should try out soufflé de chocolate .. I don't going to write our whole menu here because i think u should choose ur own food after reaching out there..

A perfect ambience what should a cafe actually needs.. And ins pocket friendly too.. 

Earlier many of my friends already reviewed this place its may be a try from my side... 
 
Raj Spanish Cafe ur awesome form changing our taste buds from that old Chinese and INDIAN Cuisine.. 

I don't want to say this but I think I should.. Don't ever try out there hot chocolate plz a request from me.. May be Pizza is there speciality bt we haven't tried because they r serving it after 17.00 hrs.. 
Overall its a nic experience here in Raj Spanish Cafe....

A Saturday afternoon well spent at Raj Spanish Cafe.. This pocket dynamite, tucked away in a shady lane off Sudder Street, provides a welcome break with its wide array of Mexican, Italian and Spanish cuisines and is quite a hit with the foreigners. We, a group of 9 people, were looking to try out something different from the regular staple of Chinese and Indian dishes and this restaurant, featured in Zomato, caught our eye. In a nutshell, we are extremely satisfied with its ambience, quality of cooking and the overall look and feel. A lot of foreigners kept coming; they seemed to be acquainted with this place... we were wondering whether we were in Kolkata!! The comments, messages and scribblings on its walls by countless people from all over the world added to its quaint charm and quirky atmosphere. The orders were written by us in notepads..again quite unique. There are outside eating arrangements too..and the service is quite prompt. 
We ordered a number of Mexican items like burrito, enchiladas verdes and empanadas de Pollo; a few Italian foods such as pasta con Pollo e funghi. Chicken lasagna, chicken combo and chocolate pancake were also ordered. In desserts, we took hot chocolate, brownie and souffle. The food was delicious, wholesome yet light... it was a different experience altogether.
If one looks at the menu, there are so many dishes to choose from the variety of continental cuisines it serves. Each one is special in its own way. I haven't said anything about the pizzas yet. They are a specialty of this restaurant.
The prices are reasonable. We really liked the whole outlook. If anybody likes to break the monotony of the same old regular foods, this little eatery can be ventured into. With its firm grip in the experimental department of continental cuisine, it can 'cook up' nice little surprises right down to the stomach!
Thank you, Raj Spanish Cafe for such an amazing and memorable afternoon.

It was a Monday evening when me and a friend of mine decided to visit this small cafe for the 2nd time. This time, it was easier to locate this cafe in the bylanes of Sudder Street.
We ordered a Chichen lasagna, spaghetti alio olio and the chocolate soufflé. 
The lasagna was pretty good. It had minced chicken topped with good amount of cheese. 
The spaghetti was decent enough. With generous amount of olive oil and garlic. 
The souffle was totally worth the wait. We ate 3 of them! It was baked to perfection. Molten from inside, just as Chef Casper would like it. 

They serve customised pizza's too, made in their wood fire oven. Would definitely try it the next time. 
It's a must visit, specifically for the soufflé.

I have been there twice. I like the tortilla they serve and the brownies. But still I am not at all fanatic about this place like my other friends. To me this place is overhyped. But still a decent food joint and more fun during winters. Staffs are well behaved. But Spain has got a number of dishes to offer, being a Spanish cafe as per the name suggests they don't offer variety.

Got mixed reviews of this place
Still had this urge to visit !
Went on a winter sunday morning
My friend ordered honey pancakes which did not even remotely look like pancakes
They were "dosa" sized with liquidy too sweet nauseous honey spreaded all over
The orange juice was fine , pulpy .
Scrambled eggs on toast was okay.. though i felt it lacked salt. Nevertheless, a sprinkle of salt and pepper was good enough !
Basically after the disappointing pancakes we thought of ordering something as basic a s scrambled eggs
The coffee section wasnt much available to my surprise
So we ordered cappuccino which again tasted shitty!
The only thing i have quite heard of.. and also one of the major reasons we made it there was the much famous chocolate souffle (fondant basically) which was pretty good. Isnt the best i have had though but definitely worth a hundred buck!
Now coming to the ambience
the place is a lil difficult to find.. its in sudder street .. yes where fairlawn is.. you should ask someone to show you the cafe .. since its a little difficult to locate
The place is crowded with foriegners, stray dogs , cats and birds !
Hygienic much!
Would not really want to come back again

Really bad experience. Went to this place with friends today. Had heard a lot about the pizzas here and was extremely disappointed when we got one. We'd ordered a veg pizza which came with an eggplant and spinach topping along with other veggies. It was absolutely tasteless and bogus. We returned it and ordered a pasta instead which was better than the pizza but tasted very drab. We also had lasagna and chilaluquies. Both were very average. Only the chocolate souffle was really tasty. 
So this place maybe good the foreigners but not for the Kolkata crowd.

Heard a lot abt this place and happen to come down today.
The ambience is really like a cafe in Goa. Chilled and relaxed. 
Ordered chicken burger with fries and coke.
Strawberry Lassi and Spaghetti Al Pesto.
The lassi was really good and the burger too.
But Spaghetti was bit disappointing cuz its garlicky basil sauce however there was no taste of garlic. It was soaked in basil sauce.
Assam tea was though refreshing.

This place was introduced to me by my college buddy about 6 months ago, and since then i can't stop myself from going to this place again and again. 
Have tried almost everything they have to offer from Indian to Mexican to Spanish..!! Pan cakes are my favourite. I eat up 2-3 pan cakes each time I pay a visit here..!! 
I have even tried pastas, and other Mexican dishes from their menu, which i can't spell..:p 
Trying to link down pictures of all .. 
And yeah, they offer a choco lava cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. That just tastes superb. I discovered that lately, and you can find it in the deserts section, the last one. 😊😛

Tucked away in a corner of Sudder Street, Raj Spanish Cafe is a delight. It excludes a feel which engulfs you as soon as you enter and sit down on the comfortable seats. A great place to just unwind, relax, catch up with friends while eating delicious food. A must-have is the Chicken Burger. A well cooked crispy chicken patty topped with an entire slice of cheese is definitely value for money. Spaghetti Al Pesto is an acquired taste, delicious in it's own right.
Raj Spanish Cafe is quaint and with it's bookshelves and walls filled with messages and doddles left by guest after guest, it makes a special place in your heart.

Another example of "good things come in a small package". Situated in a very odd and unappealing place, this is one the best places for continental dishes in Kolkata. Great food in a surprisingly cheap price, friendly hospitality, outdoor casual dining, amazing outside artworks and cool interior (you can write your review on the wall, if space available). Must try - pizza (best pizza in Kolkata according to many reviewers), Tortialla De Patatas and Souffle, though others are very good as well. If you have couple of hours to spend and still don't want to weigh heavy on your pocket, THIS is the place for you.

I am a frequent shopper in the New Market Area but was always disappointed with the eating places there. None were impressive with their spread or the choice of cuisine for me, when I stumbled upon this place in a search in Zomato! 
Took along a fellow foodie buddie. The interior is quirky with messages written in various languages probably my happy customers from all over the world.
 We were focused on "Spanish" & wanted a quick bite so ordered 
the Huevo Rellenos ( A dish of boiled egg with the yolk mixed with tuna, mayo & tomato ketchup) & the Espinacas salteadas ( fried sea food with spinach & garlic). Both the dishes were nice & tasted good. The seafood was fresh as well. Great value for money!

I paid a second visit within a week for a quick cappuccino. 
A great place if you are on budget & want to try some continental fare. I am definitely going back for the pizzas, the pasta & everything else on the menu :D

Raj Spanish café is a hidden gem. It is actually hidden as this quaint hippie café is behind a building. But that doesn't hinder its enormous business. Foreign tourists and locals all come to this cafe for good food and fun. Variety of dishes are available in Italian Mexican and Spanish. My personal favorite is  pasta cooked in extra olive oil along with pan Fried capsicum and garlic and chocolate soufflé in desert. The soufflé is worth waiting to as it melts in the mouth with the richness' of chocolate. It worth more than one visit.

Its one of the hidden treasure of Kolkata. An unknown cafe, where you will find most of the foreigners having long conversations. The walls are filled with quotes and scribblings. If I talk about food, you should try spinach & ricotta cannelloni and soufle di cioccolato.

This is a 'World' in its own, in the backyard of a building on Sudder Street, secluded from all the hustle-bustle of the busy New Market !!!

It's a cute & cozy hub of confluence for Spanish, Italian & Mexican food.

I started with "Gazpacho" - a typical Spanish style Tomato-based raw vegetables 'cold' Soup served in a tall glass with a freshly baked piece of bread (all bakery items here are home baked at the oven built at their backyard  !!!).

Being a vegetarian I had to be doubly cautious while choosing - since Egg or Chicken are integral part of most of the Spanish & Italian dishes that are available here; and I preferred going for "Pasta Al Pomodoro" - this is light Pasta, tossed in freshly prepared Tomato sauce & garlic. Cheese was just aplenty. As per your wish you can garnish with Chilli flakes & extra Olive Oil.

The portion was quite filling, however, I could not resist trying their freshly baked Chocolate Muffin ! It was Big, and each bite was just getting melted entering my mouth.

With all these the bill was just INR 225/- !!! 😱

Next time I am surely going to try - "Tofu Caesar Salad'.

"Insala Caprese" - a simple looking yet heavy stuff made of sliced buffalo mozzarella, tomato and basil - was suggested to me by their steward- which would be one more addition to my wish list.

It is a place for cultural confluence as well... People from various countries who have visited this place, left their emotional mark in form of 'graffiti' on their 4 walls in languages ranging from Spanish / French / Japanese / Korean / English / Bengali...

Beside graffitis like  "VIVA MEXICO CARBONES !!!" Or "GRACIAS POR HACERNOS SENTIR COMO EN CASA !!!" I also spotted somebody rightly wrote the last words - "WE ALL SMILE IN THE SAME LANGUAGE".

And what else other than Food can bring that smile ... 😀

Located in one of the bylanes of Sudder Street, this is undoubtedly a hidden cafe and you'll love to visit this one over and over again. You could try the mushroom soup (just about 60 bucks), the pasta is quite tasty, choco lava cake, chciken burger combo or the iced mocha. You'll definitely go home with a happy tummy.

It's refreshing to come across places like Raj's. Not at all like the usual cafés where you end up paying 500 for a small wrap and a coffee maybe and well, don't forget the tax. They might not have pretty furniture or an air conditioner, but you'll go home happy and full!   Their pizza's have super thin crusts and chocolate lava cake is truly divine! You also get to see some pretty looking travellers which is an added treat to the eyes ;)
Good work guys!

A different experience, and that too, within budget, the food were awesome and adequate, We two had our stomachs full within just Rs. 300 ;) this place is mainly filled with foreigners and fewer Indian couples, a different 'not so formal' ambiance is always there. I would love to visit there again.

This wonderful and vibrant cafe located at the Sudder Street serves lovely thin crusted wood fire pizzas on a budget and had been on my list for a long time. The place looks like a haven for foreign tourists and the walls have a lot of graffiti and scribblings on them. We sat in the open air section which was decorated with beautiful small plants, few shrubs and vines.  Next we tried the Contadina pizza (Mozzarella, Tomato sauce, potato and rosemary). Firstly it was HUGE!! It was fresh and smelled of Rosemary and the Mozzarella, unlike any popular chain of pizza. The crust was thin and soft. The cheese was outstanding, it was all gooey and creamy and had the smell of fresh dairy. It was the most memorable pizza I had.

We also tried their Cafe Bombon ( condensed milk, espresso, ice cream). I tasted like indulgence served in a cup. It was all bitter and sweet, hot and cold and delicious. 

So all in all the food is amazing and pocket friendly, the ambience is inviting and laid back. This is a place to enjoy food and company and deserves a place on your food map.

Those who want to deal with "food-gasm" (if you know what I mean), you must try the Souflé here. Hot brownies beside a cold vanilla scoop, lets you taste a molten chocolate liquid as u cut it. Your tongue tastes the hot and cold together, and your mind wanders off to trance. You might want to kiss your lover right there, if you get the curse of the souflé. Its that sexy. Other than that, pizzas are the real bliss after 6pm. All in all, this place is worth the taste and the bait. Go.

If you are a real foodie then you either have already been here or you know about this. small place is literally hidden. But there would seldom be a time of the day when you go there and its empty. Raj's spanish cafe is pefect for a casual eat out with a quality set of continental food. The prices are quite cheap and the people are way too nice. 
Definitely one place in the city you should visit. But if you want a classy continental dinner then obviously raj's is not the place.
Its cheap. Casual. And fun.

This is one of the cafes which serves only continental cuisine and it was hard for us to find it since its hidden inside a lane of Sudder street. I visited with my boyfriend and ordered pasta algio olio pepperoncino which is a pasta dish that tasted well, bruschetta which is served with baked bread and tomatoes, arroz a la cubana comprised of rice, egg and tomato puree, and for dessert we had flan de huevo which is actually a caramel custard. Three of the dishes tasted well and the custard was yum! Well If you are fond of North or South Indian cuisines then I will suggest you to avoid this place unless and until you want to try something new. The place is overall cool to chill out and smoking inside is allowed.

Try the chicken burger combo!maybe the fried ice cream too..or maybe the pizza..really generous portions.. Try this place..its a bit difficult to find for the first time but is worth it!
The only problem i seem to find is it gets uncomfortable during summer,no air conditioning..😓
Other than that..its really good!

A quite popular place for college hangouts, this place attracts quite a number of people from various countries because of its authentic Spanish, Italian and Mexican food.
You can spend your time here for hours without no one bothering you.
The food they serve you is more or less good with average dishes between 100-150 bucks.
An added plus for smokers.
One interesting thing to see here is the wall where travelers from various countries have written their messages. 
Overall, it's a nice place. I'd love to be back!

So a place frequented by the young intellectuals (and the not so intellectual 'pseudo-s') , it's one of the coolest cafes in Kolkata. Not many people know of this place, however, the ones that do never go there just once. It has a weirdly happy effect on you and you'd want to go back there again. As a regular visitor, I am pretty fond of their Nutella pancakes , soufflé, enchiladas, burger platter, sandwiches. The beverages are slightly disappointing. 
What attracts me(and I'm sure all other visitors) the most is the orange wall full of doodles and scribbles, you get to know so many stories. The wall is what makes the place have an aura of nostalgia. 
What bothers me the most about this place is that it is not well maintained, at all. Lolo, the dog, all has free access to this place and that, well, isn't very hygienic. The floor isn't very clean, the tables not tidy. However, I'll always be biased towards this place as it's one of my favorite hangout joints. People don't judge you here for anything you do, unlike most places in Kolkata.
Needless to say, will keep visiting again and again :)

Had heard a lot about this place,so decided to pay a visit post last minute puja shopping at New Market

How to reach:others have commented that it is quite difficult to locate.Not really.walk straight through sudder street,the road beside Indian museum towards east,ie,towards free school street.after 3-4 mins walk you will see hotel diplomat on your left.walk straight for a few more buildings and you have a big saree showroom rup shringar.the cafe in adjacent to that showroom,towards your left,just across a courtyard,amidst shops selling bags and other handicrafts 

Ambience:informal  and inviting.both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements.no Ac.open kitchen.there are both chairs and laid back couches.sit as long as you like and chat/read.no one hurries you.

Food:the most important part of any place.This can make or break.our order was
Albondigas en salsa espanola:Four medium meat balls is a light gravy flavoured with parsley,bell peppers and a little bit of carrots.accompanied by
 french fries and a piece of bread.tasted really nice and easily the best dish we ordered.price Rs.170/-
4.5/5

huevo rellenos: 6  boiled egg halves,yokes removed and replaced with a combination of mayo tunaa and yolk paste.tasted okayish.nothing great.but filling.price Rs.80/-
3/5

Cafe bombon:a cup of layered black coffee and cream,with icecream on top.tasted nice,me being a coffee lover.
Price:Rs.100/-
4/5

Fried Ice cream: 2 scoops of vannilla icecream coated in a layer if crunchy muesli to give a pakoda like appearance.topped with strawberry and chocolate syrup.tasted good.
price:Rs 80/-
4/5

Chicken Lasagne: we packed  this as we were full.it was a letdown.flavour was less,chicken pieces were less.cheese was less.we were disappointed.Give me Mocambo or even.Smart Kolkata version of Lasagne anyday
Price Rs.220/-
rating 2.5/5

overall we were happy and would visit again,this time for the pizza.

Please note that the prices have increased from the menu uploaded in Zomato.

This cozy little place in the heart of the city is worth a visit. Among all the things I have tried here, the burgers are delicious and the burger patties are crisp. The staff is courteous. The coolest part? You can scribble your thoughts on a huge orange wall (which is what adds to the charm of the place). It's an absolute pleasure visiting that place.

Everytime I go, I finish my plate with a chocolava. Other than that you would get a number of continental dishes here. 
The cafe is so beautifully designed that you would love to spend time here. Guitar, books, ludo, card games - several items are available here.

Studying in St Xaviers College has one big advantage which is you get to know a lot of food joints which offer quality food without burning a hole in your pocket, in and around the park street, maidan and new market area. This is one such place. I have visited the Raj's Spanish Cafe thrice. The pizza is a must try. Advantage point : You can choose your own toppings. Thin crust pizza are available and is delicious. We tried the Pollo e Funghi. Secondly, tortillas de patatas are a must try too. It is a filler for one person. Thirdly, the seafood especially pasta and squid are amazing. Fourth and my favourite thing, Nutella Pancake. This one dish is just amazing. You will keep licking the knife. Literally.

In conclusion, very cooperative staff and the cafe is non ac but then its airy and there are huge stand fans to make all that eating possible. A must try for all foodies.

I ve read so many reviews of this place. Had a huge expectation. But it totally disappointed me. Firstly hard to find it.. Located in a gali near sudder street. Then, there is no proper waiter. Some boys not so well dressed serve the food. They know nothing about the food. U will b given a note book to put ur order in it. Decoration z minimum. I ordered for cafe bombon, honey lemon soda, insalata de riso&tofu Caesar salad. Cafe bombon was good. Lemon honey soda was average.. But I didn't like any of the salads. Tofu salad was better of the two, which I could eat. Tuna salad was the most awful food I ever had in my life. It had  such a bad odour I couldn't eat it twice.. Tunas were not fresh and olives were rotten.. So bad experience.. They denied the complaint that the food is not fresh. However the price is cheap and quantity is sufficient.

Raj Spanish Cafe is not so difficult to locate if you are familiar with the Sunshine clothing store, Sudder Street. Nothing much to say about the ambience because it is not at all decorated and there isn't any fancy thing to talk about. But it is a nice place to catch over with your friends. The travellers from all the corners of the world can be seen here and this cafe is mainly dominated by them. :D The food quality was okayish with decent quantities.

Raj Spanish Cafe is pretty difficult to locate if you're walking towards it from the metro station. It's pretty blatantly visible once you've located it, but until you've done so, takes a bit of finding. The Cafe itself is not air conditioned, which isn't a problem because the interior is cool enough and the fans work well. The problem which I faced is that if you're sitting too close to a fan (the upright ones), it's very possible that the sheer force of wind generated from it will blow food away from you.

Raj Spanish Cafe, much like Blue Sky Cafe, is usually filled with tourists -- and rightfully so. I don't remember a Cafe in Kolkata which offers actual Spanish Food. You'll get Italian and Mexican Cuisine in a variety of places, but Spanish Cuisine is a little hard to come by. The food was good, their pastas are pretty decent, and come in very generous quantities. The salads (Tuna, Chicken) were perhaps a little on the dry side, containing large portions of carrots, and little garnishing. The Tuna Salad came with a bed of plain, white rice, which was a little surprising, and uninteresting. The Brownie in Chocolate Sauce in the end was perhaps the best decision we made, hot brownie and cold ice cream makes for a fantastic end to a hearty meal. It is difficult to admire Spanish Cafe because they serve up their food with very little presentation, but I don't think I've had Spanish food of the sort anywhere else in Kolkata. You will be able to find better Mexican and Italian food in other joints though.

Their service was pretty ordinary - take our order, serve our food. There was no miscommunication and service was fast and friendly. From my perspective, diners shouldn't expect much more than that. The food is extremely cheap compared to other joints, and I'll probably keep coming back to Raj Spanish Cafe until they decide to shut down. But I do sincerely hope they install an air cooling unit, otherwise the food gets cold too fast, and the upright fans are a serious annoyance.

Good experience overall, right up there with Blue Sky Cafe! 
Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made. :)

Raj's spanish cafe... Meant for all the foreign travellers who wishes to have a taste of food from their native country.. 
A little secluded place at the corner of sudder street, nothing fancy,nothing decorated. Not at all wiling to stand out. But somehow it will draw your attention  Whether its coz of the foreign crowd,food or the wonderful wall writings. Yes they have a plain dark painted wall that has all memories and wonderful quotes scribbled by the visitors and that is exactly what you will fall in love with.
Coming to the food. 
Ordered- Ensalada pollo- vegetable salad with baked chicken .expected more chicken pieces. average in taste. Good quantity.
Spinach and ricotta canneloni- i loved this dish. Spinach,cheeze, pasta, spicy.
Mixed fruit juice
 brownie-brownie, icea creamm with chocolate sauce  . yummy tummy

The price is soo cheap. We ordered three course dishes and the bill was just 600!! How!! I m shocked and amazed.
Cant wait to go on a weekday so we can try some of their pizzas.

Raj Spanish Cafe is a hidden gem on Sudder Street, undoubtedly.
The orange wall with scribbles on it, the photographs, the guitar and the books add a new dimension to the ambiance and the decor. On the wall, you will find a writing saying 'Thank you for bringing a bit of Spain in India' which is absolutely true. I doubt whether there are any other Spanish Restaurants in Kolkata which is visited by a large number of Spanish tourists.

Needless to say, every time I visit this place, it is only because of the ambiance and the food. I am coffee lover and hence, Expresso Con Panna and Cafe Bombon are my favorites. I like the Ensalada Pollo that they serve. The pan fried chicken that they serve with this salad adds to the real great taste of the dish. Burrito is something to die for but please make sure that you at least have 40 minutes in hand to enjoy this dish. Except these, the Chicken Burger is also out of this world, at a reasonable rate.

I have heard from other foodies that this place is making great pizzas and hence this is on my cards when I visit this place next time.

I got introduced to Raj's Spanish Cafe about 2 months back,thanks to a buddy.It is located in the middle of Sudder St,and is inside a alley,on the left hand side if you are coming from Chowringhee side ( Indian Museum).Has both indoor and outdoor seating..and serves European cuisine..with a lovely chicken burger combo which has a real juicy burger patty.We tried the Burrito which was well made..they also serve pastas,pizzas and quite a variety of Spanish dishes..the best one I found has to be the Choco souffle,which is simply out of this world..they take 30 mins to make it..any time of this day..and its worth the wait..you get to meet a lot of Foreigners at this place..especially Spanish people..makes for lovely conversation over food..They should put more fans outside as Kol is warm and humid a lot of time..they have books on travel and novels inside which you can read..and I think also a guitar is there.Nice ambience,good food,and easy on pocket.

If you want to have delicious pasta or pizza within a pocket friendly amount, bammm u r in the right place.... The ensalada mixta is ok ok, it is a salad with capsicum, carrot, lettuce, tuna and boiled egg. But the Spanish cafe special pizza is a full on hit... The thin crust, the mozzarella and the herbs create magic on ur tongue..... A must try.
The soufle d cioccolato is just aqesone. The hot choco lava cake with a scoop of chilled ice cream taste divine....
I would definitely visit it next time to try tje chicken burger and the other varieties of pasta and pizza.

Today Me and My Sister Went to the place, 

Firstly,  it's somewhat difficult to locate but once found, it looks shabby from the outside, with posh atmosphere unavailable, this place becomes one of the 'simply superb places'.

Secondly, The Restaurant Was Totally filled table to table, and we had to wait 15 minutes until got to share one with two elderly persons , upon having a conversation with they we found out they are from Spain, and travelling India since last two months. They Are in kolkata since last few days and daily eat the place because they feel it 'very homely'. One thing , We Later found out we were the only Indians Eating there that time, The Place was buzzing with foreigners, sometimes i did wondered that did we teleported to some cafe in Barcelona? or to a Bistro in Milan or to a eatery in Mexico?

Thirdly, Upon the Couple's and also the Waiter's suggestions we ordered 'Tortillas'( i heard the term only once before and that was in 'Tintin and the broken year') and also ordered 'Pasta Al' Something , which was of course a Pasta with Tomato sauce and cheese. tortilla Turned out to be a Excellently baked Potato and Egg Cake with Bread. And the Unique Thing is that you have to write down what you are ordering!!

Fourthly, The Food Was Simply Outstanding and Delicious. and at what cost?? its Very Very Cheap!! All these Costed just mere less than 250 Rupees Only and that too in a Area Like Sudder Street!!  Amazing!!

Finaly, The Service. Frankly Speaking the service was excellent, the staff was fast wll manered, The Place was clean and tidy.

Last But Not the Least, this is absolutely a 'Hidden Gem' as Mentioned in Zomato, must Visit Place

Thanks For Reading!!

Raj spanish cafe is a place that provides spanish, italian and mexican dishes at the cheapest rate. The location is not very prominent. The lane beside indian museum is sudder street. Taking sudder start walking and after 2-3 minutes of walk, you will notice raj spanish cafe on your left ( there is a field in between the street and the cafe)

The ambience is not worth mentioning. There is both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement. When i visited the place, it was filled up with foreigners but i was lucky enough to get a table instantly.

I came here to try mainly spanish. So my order was huevo rellenos, arroz a la cubana and i also ordered a lasagna. The food took a long time to arrive. First came arroz a la cubana. It looked very nice. It is rice topped with a fried rice and surrounded by tomato sauce. The sauce was too sour otherwise the dish was good. The fried egg was very tasty and the sour taste got masked when i had rice with the fried egg.

Then came the lasagna. The upper part was very cheesy and the veggies in it tasted good.

Then came huevo rellenos. Looked great and tasted the best! Three eggs halved, the yolk removed and the hollow part filled up with mayo yolk and tuna. This was the best of the lot. If you are into spanish cafe, this is a must.

Overall, if you are in search of some healthy, homely, unique nd tasty food then spanish cafe should be your destination. The prices are too cheap and nowhere will you get spanish food at this price !!

what's bad-it's difficult to find this place in broad daylight with a  pack of army trained sniffer dogs.It's not on the main road,and it's not right on an alley off the main road either.however,when you complete your quest of locating the cafe,you are more than dismayed at the state of affairs of the place.A few table with couches lying around both indoors and outdoors with a kitchen counter and spanish inscribed walls is all there is to see.the setting isn't lavish,but the the pricing is so pocket friendly that savories at that tag might constitute "charity".so we ordered to our heart's content and with a sense of experimentation.Very soon,we found 
ourselves at an unenviable position of facing a enchiladas verdes that smelt quite disheartening.The cheese,no doubt,had ripened beyond the cheesemaker's intent,and yet the chef had prodded on.it was a struggle to finish off two tortilla wrapped mexican fillings,when every bite filled our lungs with the likes of carbon monoxide or hydrogen sulphide.the initial horror show,thankfully, lead to a reprieve when we were served bruschetta and huevo relenos.the bruschetta was too simplistic,just two pieces of garlic bread with tomato and olive oil dressing,but somehow managed to placate taste buds and its refreshing hues were a pleasure to the eyes.the huevo was even more utilitarian,three boiled egg pasted with mayo,but enchiladas had truly humbled us to an extent that snobbery and finicky were beyond us at that point.But,like most instances in life,the worst was yet to come.Pancakes are my favourite.I yearn for them from time to time,and a continental eatout always makes me hopeful.The three of us ordered three different pancakes-banana,lemon cinnamon,and chocolate.what came from the chef's counter was more of a "panjoke".a large tortilla-like bread acutely resembling the base of thin crust dominos pizza with cinnamon sparkled in a design and two suspicious looking slices of lemon at two arbitrary poles-that was their version of lemon cinnamon pancakes!! the banana one was no improvement either,sad custard styled lumps of banana scattered on a similar battered dough.Only the chocolate pancake had chocolate sauce and proved to be the draw of the afternoon,being remotely edible.

what's good-our orders did stem from a spree of continental food hunt,and varied from spanish to italian and mexican and took time and so,we had a nice little afternoon retreat in a quiet little place.we had a time to soak in the the ambiance,cinch on the bonhomie candor and alacrity kolkata's latino population has weaved around the place.we were the only indian customer there and a bevy of spanish ladies kept the place occupied and lively and it felt like a different place altogether.as the European customers kept coming and leaving,I gathered the feeling that they have made this their home,and carved out a little spain in this strange land.the walls are decked with inscriptions,and we could make out only a few english ones,like "thank you kolkata,for having a little spain in your city".the service is laid back but that's hardly inopportune,rather  simulates a sense of levity that encourages conversation and dialogue.we had a hard time with some of the food,but when the spanish throng this place and saunter through the offerings with unwavering smile,it gives you second thoughts on your own opinion.after all,it's better left to the spanish to judge any rendition of their food.

final Word-you can go for the bruschetta and huevo.lasagna and souffle are ordered with alarming regularity by those who seem to be frequent the place,so it might be good idea to emulate that.

foodie funfact #9-today I will tell you the curious case of amuse bouche,and by telling,i mean quoting wikipedia verbatim.ahem,so here it is.An amuse-bouche is a single, bite-sized hors d’œuvre.Amuse-bouches are different from appetizers in that they are not ordered from a menu by patrons, but, when served, are done so free and according to the chef's selection alone. These, often accompanied by a complementing wine, are served both to 
prepare the guest for the meal and to offer a glimpse into the chef's approach to the art of cuisine.

The term is French, literally translated as "mouth amuser".

But the place truly is a gem. They do make some really good European dishes. Actually thats the only thing they make.
Nice place, though mostly packed. Pretty clean, good service.

I had gigantic desires from Raj Spanish Cafe, and I was very disappointed. The spot is a bang on however the vast majority of the things are inaccessible. No staff are there to treat you appropriately... Not only that when we requested the things, He didn't know well what is it. I mean really?

We requested for pasta with white sauce (chicken) and Tuna sandwich and some dessert . I don't have a clue about the odor from pasta was disgusting to the point that in the wake of returning home, I had food poisoning issues. Furthermore, tuna sandwich were similar to 2 cut bread and some Mayonnaise fish blend for 80 bucks!!! Well heard such a great amount about it, attempted it and waste more cash for Specialist/Doctor and other medicines.

Undoubtedly needs a significant measure of progress.

Went there with a friend of mine and ordered meatballs and pasta con pollo e funghi. The pasta was full of cheese,chicken and mushroom and was very heavy .Initially it tasted good ,but later the taste became too monotonous . It is highly recommended you share the dish among two if not three people. The meatballs were good, nothing exceptional about them. Overall it was good experience but not something very fancy, though it is cheap and you get enough worth your money.

Oh my god! This is a heaven for food lovers. The chicken cheese pasta, the browny with ice cream, the honey lemon soda all of these are just finger licking delicious. A cosy and perfect place for evening addas over puffs of smokes and authentic French/Mexican foods. I highly recommend it to all my foodie friends and I can guarantee that whoever visits this place will fall in love with it on the very first visit.

My friend found out from the internet that this is a nice place to eat, so we went there in the afternoon. Its almost at the end of Sudder Street, the street beside Indian Museum.

It took some time to scan through the menu and understanding what each item was as the names were Italian, Spanish, Mexican etc.

My friend suggested Albondigas en salsa espanola, a spanish dish containing chicken meat balls with a light tasting spanish sauce.

I also ordered Pasta con pollo e funghi - Italian pasta with chicken and mushroom in white sauce which tasted good.

My favorite was the dessert - Soufle di Cioccolato - a hot chocolate lava cake served with ice cream.

Overall it was a good experience and will surely try out more items in their menu.

So this evening I went to Raj Spanish Cafe along with the a friend after reading various reviews on Zomato.
Locating the place was slightly difficult for us since we aren't very familiar with the roads there.
After 10 minutes of search we finally found the cafe tucked into the corner of a building.
Neither does the cafe have the most welcoming look nor does it have a good ambience ( we found 2 men sleeping inside and a dog named Lulu loitering inside the cafe throughout our 1 hour stay ) however we were prepared for this.
The staff wasn't very helpful in terms of suggestions as to what to go for so we ordered as we wished.
Then after a short 7-10 mins span we were served the mocktails we'd ordered, the iced mocha. The combination of coffee and chocolate along with icecream tasted great however it would taste even better if the icecream was blended into the drink.
Then came our way a Spanish dish which was 4 mid sized meat balls ( semi-gravy) along with French fries to compliment it. It tasted different, something that I've never really had before and I quite liked it !
After that came the lasagne which was a stuffed very well with cheese, veggies and great Italian seasoning and was YUMM ! It is definitely the best tasting lasagne I've ever had !
Then came the chicken burger that looked great and tasted good as well however it would've tasted much better if the bun was of a better quality.
Then we were served our pizza ( spicy chicken ) and trust me it's one of the best tasting pizzas you're gonna get in the city, and for it's price, definitely the best !
To end our meal we ordered the soufle which was a tastier form of the dominos choco lava cake served along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream ... It was the best ending we could ask for to a great meal :)
With better ambience, more knowledgeable staff and greater visibility of the cafe, it would definitely get a 5 on 5 rating !
So if you're the kind who'd want great food and are not too choosy about the ambience then this cafe is definitely worth a visit.
I'm definitely visiting the place soon and their pizza and soufle is gonna be part of my meal for sure !

Not a very posh area but the food is yummy...
So don't go by it's looks...
Lasagna tasted better than most places I had in,shrimps in olive butter sauce and chicken combo are what we tried...
Seemed quite decent... For many a turnoff would be a dog roaming around the place, but it didn't bother me because the food was good.

I had huge expectations from Raj Spanish Cafe, and I was badly disappointed. This, more or less sums up my experience there.
On a sultry summer afternoon, me and a friend took a detour on our way to tuition and landed here. The ambiance was relaxing, we chose one of the tables outside and settled down.
We weren't really hungry and were low on cash as well, so we just decided to order two plates of Huevo Rellenos and a chocolate souffle. They have a funny way of taking the order, they provide you with a notepad and a pen with the menu card and you write the name of the dish there for ordering.
The Huevo Rellenos was basically six halved boiled eggs, stuffed with a mixture of its yolk, tuna, mayonnaise and tomato. I can't specifically tell you what was wrong with it. It just had a funny taste, along with being a tad too salty. As the souffle arrived, we got excited. It looked perfect. But as soon as we tasted it...nope, disappointment hit us again. The consistency was fine, but it just, as my friend put it perfectly, tasted like chocolate horlicks. It's a pity, I heard such praises about this dish.
The service was a little slow, but still nothing to complain about. This place is really really cheap, and will never burn a hole in your pocket.
Maybe I'll visit again for the pizzas which I heard are pretty good.

Raj Spanish Cafe does not do justice to the items on their menu. The only thing that I liked were the tortillas which ironically is not available anymore. The white pasta which we ordered didn't look appetizing at all. It was dripping with oil and we left it half finished.The meat balls tasted average. The chicken in the burger reminded me of Fish fry. Their pancakes are anything but pancakes! They just pour some chocolate sauce on the flat cake and we were forced to leave it midway too. I am utterly disappointed that this hippie joint which is filled with foreigners and youngsters serves such substandard food. If you really want to sit here for hours and enjoy the hippie environment, just order the Mango or Pineapple Shake they are the only drinks worth having there.

Raj Spanish Cafe or more popularly Spanish cafe is one of the most sought after joints in the city specially amongst the youths..located in one of the hidden alleys of Sudder Street this place offers quite an unique proposition to the foodies of kolkata..it actually adds a different dimension to the cullinary variety of the city.. serving authentic spanish and italian foods at an economical rate this place is difficult to miss for an altogether unique and different food experience..The ambiance isn't quite stereotypical,this place don't even have an a.c. but the mood is set by the people and the food they serve..Here you will actually find the foreign travellers as a majority mainly spanish students, this place has a charming outdoor seating resembling more of an European road-side cafe..Coming to the food venture only for their Continental delicacies and don't bother the Indian menus much..Try the Burrito,Sea Food Spaghetti, Gambas Al Ajillo, Tortilla De Patatas and Chocolate Mousse..apart from this they also serve some interesting and tasty pizzas with avriety of toppings to choose from..If you plan to visit just go early as it gets pretty crowded after 8pm..

First time been highly disappointed by a place recommended in Zomato. It is not ironic that the place is featured under hidden gems cuz it is pretty difficult to locate it. With high spirits I entered the place but was really disappointed at the end. I ordered a Spanish dish which was just OK. Thereafter there was nothing more that they had to offer except the pasta (chicken and mushroom), and trust me it wasn't good at all. I have had pasta at a few places and I do make it sometime myself. But this one was really not up to the mark. I might visit this place again, out of curiosity for the menu, but not with such enthusiasm and hunger.

It's almost like you are out of India while still being in Kolkata. Located at the heart of the city, the café delivers Spanish, Mexican and Italian delicacies only. But please don't go ruining the place if you are not a hobo at heart. Frequented mostly by foreigners, this place is a wonder stop for you to make new friends, eat their self baked pizzas and laugh your heart out. Starting from Pasta and Pizza to Burritos and Empanadas and of course the famous Guacamole and Tortillas, you'd want to eat a different dish every time you hit this place. The Soufle Di Cioccolato is my favorite dessert, BTW.

The ambience is very old school western. Though the heat begs for an AC, but honestly the whole ambience would shudder down if the place was all closed due to the installment of the AC. After all, you need to be in an open place to have an open mind. They have sitting arrangements on the inside as well as on the outside, very European. 

No doubt the food makes me go back to that place almost every weekend but what really attracts me is the people over there. Since I love meeting new people, going over there and chatting up with unknown random people from different parts of the world while enjoying cibo delizioso is all-you-can-ask-for for me.

If you are in town, this place is a must visit. The cost of food is very less especially things like english breakfast tea, earl grey tea, pancakes etc. Pizza is something which i will recommend you and except this restaurant in kolkata it is difficult to spot a brick oven pizza. However the place is difficult to locate.

DIFFICULT TO LOCATE!!

The restaurant is not somewhere you would easily spot walking around the New Market Area, as a matter of fact it’s actually in Sudder Street. The ambience, décor, quality of service is something you shouldn’t be worried about. The things you should notice is that you can put your laptop on charge, pull up your feet on the sofa, stay there for hours and guarantee to get a table.

I had a PINEAPPLE JUICE, WATERMELON JUICE, ICED CAFFE LATTE and EMPANADAS DE POLLO, a Mexican dish which was basically chicken and sliced boiled egg wrapped in a dough and fried. We had an awesome dessert. The call it SOUFLE DI CIOCCOLATO. It’s a hot choco lava cake of sorts with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Well, I have been here with a bunch of my friends who were all praises about this place. But we all got disappointed as the food was really really bad. We had ordered a variety of dishes but all of them turned out to be a disaster. Also when the food is not filling you at least expect it to be cheap. I spent almost 200 bucks with barely anything in my stomach. I liked the ambience though as it is a nice little place where you can hang out with your friends over coffee and music. We didn't try the pizzas over here ,which I heard, are good so if you are going there anytime in the future do try them out.
FYI the things we ordered: Fresh lime soda, Honey lime soda, Americano, Ensalada pollo, Empanadas de pollo, Albóndigas en salsa española, Burrito, Patatas bravas.

First, this cannot be called a Cafe, but anyway, I was not much fascinated by this place. No impression regarding the sitting, interiors, decors etc. Coming to the food, food is not too special, given the prices. The lasagne was not upto the mark, honestly. If one really wants to be here, then one could go for desserts.

I have been going to this place since my college days and i absolutely love the pizzas here! It is one of my favourite places to go to for an authentic Italian thin crust pizza. The Pollo e funghi is absolutely delicious and you might just gobble up the entire pizza all by yourself. 
The staff are very nice and friendly and if you are lucky they let you watch them prepare the pizza on the fire. The prices are very reasonable too, and since this place is a favourite for a lot of foreigners you might end up making new friends too!

This little cafe is a little difficult to find. It's situated in a compound beside hotel Astoria. The cafe may not look much but the food is very good, reasonable and comes in large portions.
1. Albondigas or meatballs in gravy with French fries and bread- The meatballs were tasty and the gravy was silky. One portion was more than enough for one person.
2. Pasta al pesto- Topped with cheese. The spaghetti was drowned in pesto. A little overpowering but if you like pesto, go for it.
3. Parfait- Since tiramisu was not available, we opted for parfait which was a terrible let down. Out came a bowl of fruits topped with yoghurt. Not what we had in mind.
So all in all, despite the desperate hunt required for this cafe, it was worth it in the end.

Also the Pizza is something to look out for.. specially where some tourists have written there that it tastes as if it's in Italy... will be there again soon.

Located on the rear ends of the forever active Sudder Street, I have stumbled upon Raj’s Spanish Café umpteen numbers of times during my days of retail therapy. However it was not until the other that I found it listed under the top 10 Must Visit Cafes in Kolkata, I suppose which was with respect to its affordability. However there was not much to be pleased about it.

Raj’s Spanish Café serves an array of continental dishes with a rather authentic spread of Italian and Spanish Cuisine. It’s a small café that provides an airy outdoor seating and a very informal indoor seating facility. The menu is not easy to decipher. There is quiet a lot they have to offer, though there’s not much guidance you get, to choose your way through the menu. Also the menu is sort of a hotch- potch. Many dishes are not available in Non Vegetarian but are not clearly specified. Most of the dishes usually tilt more towards the vegetarian corner. The staff places an order list on your table which is supposed to be filled with reference to the menu and handed over to them.

The food. 

We ordered a portion of Tortilla De Patatas, a Spanish egg omelet, Chicken Meat Balls in Spanish Sauce, Chocolate Brownie with ice cream and a Nutella Pancake.  Starting from the back, the brownie with ice cream was good and at par with the conventional standards. The same applies for the Nutella pancake but it was more on the lines of the crepe, nevertheless delicious. The Chicken Meatballs were the most delectable things on our table that day; it was perfectly spiced and full of rich buttery flavours. The potato omelet on the other hand, had a very dry texture, really small in portion and not satisfactory at all.  

The ambience.

I guess it’s the atmosphere that keeps an enlivening air sustained in this café. It’s a hippie world around. There is a lot of colour and accompanied chattering that’ll you be witness to. It’s a laid back feel and no one is in haste. Once you’re done with the food, the staffs don’t vex you much bringing the cheque. You can sit back here for hours together; meet new people and gossip over food with not much botheration. The service as expected is tad bit on the slower side, and food is served to your leisure. Nonetheless as suggested, this place is definitely affordable with every dish being reasonably priced. 

All in all, while I loved the quality time I spent here with my friends, the overall dining experience was not much of a pleasure.

It took us approximately 45 mins to locate this place.
On reaching there, I expected this place to be more or less, a replica of FairLawn.
And boy, I was wrong.
This place is nothing short of a culture shock & about the food, well, you don't have to glance into your wallet.
Our appetite consisted of Layered Lasagne, Garlic Flavored Bruchetta & the Pizza, with Lemon Tea.
Every dish worth every penny.

Had read a lot abt this cafe on Zomato and forced my wife to come along. And I have to say for the 1st time I was disappointed with something which Zomato reviewers said was good.

No doubt food was good and it is extremely cheap but what hurt me was the ambience. It is supposed to be a hippie cafe but no sense of cleanliness and maintenance. To our surprise a dirty dog walked in and settled on one of the cushioned seats at the back. The entrance is also a little away from the road and the approach is also dirty and dilapidated 

The names on the menu are complicated and when we asked the waiter to suggest something nice, he seemed lost and confused.

We had ordered a chicken pasta in white sauce which I liked along with a bruschetta which was nothin spectacular. Also asked for a cold coffee but they only had the iced coffee available with crushed ice which also wasn't what I wanted. 

We had 3 dishes and 2 drinks, total bill Rs400/-. Very nice on the pocket but in all a disappointing experience. I may not be going here again

Spanish. Italian. Mexican. Pancakes. Nutella. Souffle. At the heart of sudder street, this restaurant offers you a lot with out making you check your wallet before ordering. The atmosphere, the manager- they add to the experience. In short, dig in.

Located on the hippie area of kolkata this cafe has a good options of pizzas and other items which lures you towards the cafe. 
So my friend insisted me to go to this place and try it which eventually was the right decision while i was in kolkata.

Raj's Spanish Cafe has been like a second home for me and my friends, ever since I moved to Kolkata three years back. The food is cheap and delicious, the people you meet are amazing (including the wonderful Raj himself), Lulu the friendly gorgeous dog, and they let you smoke in peace and hang out for hours and use the free Wi-Fi without a complaint. It's the only cafe I've found in Kolkata that actually has an aesthetic and style of an actual cafe. It's like Coffee House but even more cosmopolitan and with much better food.

And the buttery,cheesy pasta con pollo e funghi (pasta with chicken and mushrooms) and spinach and ricotta cannelloni, and chicken croquetas and huevo rellenos and the flan de huevo and souffle and iced mocha are all superb.

This place is a must visit if you want to explore the charms of Calcutta. It is located on the hippie Sudder Street and it is a bit difficult to find. I agree its a hippie cafe and needs to look like one. But it can do with atleast some restoration and maintenance. The area is frequented by backpackers. The menu card is tattered. We ordered pancakes and some Mexican and Spanish breakfast. We waited with our fingers crossed. The breakfast arrived fast but the pancakes took half an hour. And man!! The food blew us off. It was brilliant and cheap. The pancakes were huge and filled with bananas and nutella. The Mexican and Spanish food was delicious. It is much much better than the snobbish Flurys which is just a kilometre away. We took our time and ate it. This cafe has a laid back atmosphere and time just stops there. The food is so heavy that we had to cancel our lunch and was barely hungry for dinner. Full marks for food!!!

Pasta al pomodoro and Soufle di cioccolato - a must try for all those who have never been here and are planning too.
Pocket friendly rates and a relaxing atmosphere.
Through a bit difficult to locate the place but the food sepcially the soufle was worth the 30mins café hunt.

Located at Sudder street this place has got its inimitable charm and an extremely relaxed ambiance with amazing food at extremely reasonable price and mostly foreign tourists around. This place has the charm of old Calcutta embedded somewhere deep inside it. It teleports you back couple of decades and leaves you there with some great food and people around.

I went in there a week back with couple of Maharashtrian friends of mine. They were absolutely impressed with everything out there, startig from the setting, ambiance, people, menu card, food, pricing, service... everything! To start with, here you will find Mexican, Italian and Spanish food. In the menu card the Spanish dishes have got their actual Spanish names, so it is better you know beforehand what do they actually mean or how are they supposed to taste. We went in for mostly Spanish dishes leaving out a few. You need to write your order on paper slips and hand it over to the waiter, finally you will get back that slip  with prices written alongside each of the dishes and summed up showing your total payable amount. So the initial order slip itself transforms into your final bill. The prices written on menu card are tax inclusive, so it's really easy to calculate your final bill amount. Let's discuss about the food, we had ordered for:

a) Huevo Rellenos - It is one great starter, it is Tuna and tomato sauce mixed with egg yolks and topped with mayo. Served in half egg cups, really a great no-frill starter which will vanish in just no time. Must try.

b) Cafe Bombon - The description explains the drink quite well, it is Espresso and condensed milk topped with whipped cream. Worth a try.

c) Arroz A la Cubana - It is one of the mains having rice in it. It has got fine quality rice in tangy tomato sauce gravy, topped with double yolk fried egg. Really one refreshing dish. The runny egg yolks with tangy tomato and rice has got a great chemistry together. Worth a try.

d) Burrito - The only Mexican dish we tried at this joint. It is tortilla wrapped into a roll having fillings of chicken and beans inside, served with tomato slices and guacamole. Worth a try.

e) Spaghetti al frutti di mare - Only Italian dish that we had tried. It is basically a seafood spaghetti having veggies, squid, octopus, shrimp in it. It looks amazing and tastes great. Though I found it a bit bland which can be adjusted/fine-tuned by adding some sauce, pepper and salt to it. Though the dish is quite filling, so it is worth a try.

f) Tortilla de Patatas - This was one hell of an amazing dish! It is very much Spanish by nature. It is a cake kinda slice prepared with egg having fried potatos inside (you need to refer the picture I have attached to understabd this!) It tastes great (add some tomato sauce and pepper to it if required) and gives some great cooking ideas. It is served with two pieces of bread and the whole dish costs just INR 40. Incredible! Must try.

g) Albondigas en salsa espanola - Another insanely delicious dish. It has got four medium sized chicken meat balls in an amazing spanish gravy (having finely diced veggies in it) served with french fries and bread. Must try.

Only one great dish, the Gambas al Ajillo was not available, maybe because we had reached the place very late, at around 4pm. Overall, the service is very quick, waiters are polite and billing process is pretty simple. Only I guess the hygiene can be marginally improved, but definitely the place is delivering much more than it is expected to do at this ultra reasonable rates! The dishes are prepared to perfection and in almost no time. Frankly speaking it just left us dumbfounded. I would recommend this place to each and everyone. Go try it out! It's a gastronomical wonderland! :)

Cheers!

I am highly disappointed with this place.. Heard a lot about this, so made a visit.. Even for a foodie its difficult to understand all the fancy names in the menu card.. Waiters are pretty reluctant to come and take a order.. Ordered lasagna which tastes like some medicine with creepy smell, with negligible amount of mushrooms and all I could see was few tomatoes and carrots.. Cafe bombon also disappointed me, the serving glass rather looked dirty.. overall not at all a good experience..

Was horribly disappointed with the service..the food..A lay man like me will first be lured by the prices and the names of the unknown mexican and spanish dishes..then when your food arrives, you will see that the quantity and the taste is pitiful. They don't even have enough glasses for a table. Five of our friends went yesterday to see that only 1 proper glass was available, the rest four were provided with plastic glasses. When you see the food in front of you, it will seem that they are doing you a favour by donating some food. I had ordered an Empanadas de pollo. I thought I was having 3 small black olive filled chicken patties like the ones you get in menoka. 
The only thing worth having was the french fries. I cannot opine anything about the pizzas. As they are available 6pm onwards while we went around 4pm. Basically a very over hyped cafe in sudder street.

Intro : Tucked a bit inside a building, a little difficult to locate, no AC .

Food : Had pasta con pollo funghi - pasta with chicken and mushrooms in white sauce - It was fantastic, the white sauce was just yummy. Was alone , hence couldn't try anything else since pasta was quite filling.Preferably good for two ! 4/5

Overall : If you wanna try something different,hit this place! I am coming back definitely 4/5

well...to start off with , the ambience was pretty nice. You can see foreigners around u which actually gives a feel of some European cafe shops. The price are very reasonable n pocket friendly. We started of with Huevo Rellenos which is preparation of egg whites n tuna...n its a big No No. Galtise bhi maat khanna it was a touture to the taste buds but fortunately meat ball saved us. Finally my friend ordered Soufle Di ciccolato...yummy it is!!!! with molten chocolate n icecream, wat more cud u ask for. having that was like having an orgasm. even the chocolate muffins were delicious not to forget the ice coffee which was a constant companion. so overall it was a nice experience!!!! thumbs up...!!!

After seeing a check in by a frnd in facebook i came to know abt this place....so went there yesterday....its a very chilled out n layed back place...very apt for artistic people i think....they've got a variety of cuisines like spanish, italian, maxican in the menu with selected items from each...i ordered a spanish dish which wasn't available, then i ordered for a pasta which wasnt available either, then i setteled for a chicken burger and honey lime soda...burger was decent, it was tasty but the patty was lil hard....overall it was a nice experience....interesting thing was, this small cafe has a bookshelf with quite some books, i guess they've kept foreigners in mind as its located in sudder street...so its a plus point for book lovers :)
So here my rating out of 5:
Food: 3.5
Ambience: 4
Hospitality: 4

I wish they have some music to go with the place....
 
NOTE: i went to this place again to have pizza's... let me tell you... order any pizza you like with extra cheese in it, i bet you'll be experiencing the most authentic pizza in town....they actually make it in burner like its made in Italy which was quite interesting for such a small place... only for pizza i would rate 5/5 :)

Following up on my virtual tour of this place through zomato i went for a lunch .

It happens to be tucked inside on sudder street and we almost missed it.Away from the hustle of the main street it transports  you to an unusual coterie of young students and many a foreigners.It was almost full even at 2 in the afternoon.

We found a seat for ourselves towards the inner side with a book case behind us.Though i liked to casual ambience they created with table tops atop coldrink crates,a guitar and pinboard with paper napkin notices yet i felt a little uneasy.the mattress on the couch was a little to unkempt,the book case hadnt been dusted in ages and bottle of oil and powder kept along with very old books .Street dogs freely roamed about probably following regular customers .

We ordered a watermelon juice,a fresh lime soda and burritoes-1 chicken and 1 veg.Most of the spanish dishes they offer are either potatoes ,eggs or a combination of the two.We did not want to have pastas .And from the look of burgers being carried for someone else we were quite sure we could get better ones else where.Pizzas are available only aftr 6 pm in the evening.

When the drinks were brought the straw bobbed up in d glass n fell on the floor.The waiter was about to pick it from the floor before we stopped him.This act made me quite sceptical about what i was drinking and wondering how my food was getting cooked in the kitchen.

The service was fast and soon the burritoes arrived.It was way below my expectations.Mexican dishes are usually quite tiltilating -tangy and hot .But this was neither.It was more like a home cooked chappati stuffed with boiled capsicum,tomatoes,zuchini with a small portion of avocado based dip.The chicken burrito was not much better.

We did not feel like ordering a dessert after that.

While paying at the counter i noticed the open kitchen was quite clean .I wish theyd keep the eating area as clean too.

Located almost at the end of Sudder street lane, I am relieved to have not missed out on this Cafe. The cafe is located away from the commotion of the street and that works as a great advantage in its favor. This place has turned out to be one of my favorite hangout spots because of the cozy ambiance and the friendly attendants. It is sure to give you a feeling of belonging, like you are throwing a party at your own house or maybe hanging out with your friends at their place. There is a pin board at the back of the room, which has napkin drawings and sketches and notifications of upcoming events and that is an interesting read in itself. The pizzas are baked in a wood oven that is visible to the customers and most of the dishes are served fresh from the kitchen which is of course a very commendable act in itself. 
They charge very little for the tea they are serving and they serve tea packets so its actually a great idea to not charge much for them. The Chillers are worth a try and so is the pizza. While ordering the pizza you should mention the spices you want with it as they make it according to the taste of the customer and so if you miss a topping you might find it a bit tough to adjust. You should try the Soufle (choco lava cake with ice cream), its amazing when you taste the molten chocolate  inside. This is a sure shot success for people who want to hangout or spend some time relaxing.

Located on Sudder Street, this place serves a sensational array of Mexican, Italian and Spanish dishes with absolute finesse. But what strikes me most about this place is the ambience. The scribblings on the wall, the bookshelf that is filled with a variety of books, the softboard filled with drawing, the photographs on the bookshelf, the outdoor seating, the ethnic Indian wear stores that come along with it. The vibe this place gives off is in a different level altogether. The seating, the dim lighting, the people that visit, it gives the feel of what a cafe should be like. You get to share tables with people you do not know, the place is frequented by foreign tourists and you get to sit and chat share stories. The place gives a energetic and funky feel to it all. And of course, there is a guitar there, so if there are musicians among you, you can have a good sing along.

Now coming to the food. They serve an excellent variety of tea and coffee and you will definitely find something that'll suit your taste. The menu gives an authentic feel, the dishes are named in Spanish and it is a pleasure going through it. We had Lemon Tea, Ensalada Pollo, Pasta con pollo e funghi, all of which were heavenly and cooked with a form of perfection. The spices and sauces in the pasta mixed in the right proportion, the chicken salad being healthy as well as tasty. Now I come to what stole the show for me, the dessert, for which we had Souffle di Cioccolato. And that just blew me away. Warmth of the liquid chocolate and the coldness of the ice cream along with the pieces of cake were a delight to devour. It was the best dessert I have had in a while.
Overall I would like to say that I would visit this place again and again just for the ambience and experience alone.

Located nearby at the juncture where sudder street and mirza ghalib street collide, Raj Spanish Cafe is an enigma upon itself...
Spanish,Mexican & Italian cuisine all under one roof is a rarity, this place is an absolute favourite of tourists so you'll see them in large groups chilling and enjoying the ambiance ,the experience is a sheer delight to share tables and chats with people from different places. I really like the whole vibe of the place with its energy and spunk.
The staff are really helpful and multilingual which I'm sure helps in communication,the only thing missing is please put more fans or an AC inside else its getting a tad bit sweaty where the mercury shoots up.

Coming to the food we ordered Albondigas en salsa espanola , Pasta con pollo e funghi and Mango & Banana lassi. 
Mango lassi is real good yummy and pulpy,but the banana lassi was a major let down,it was bland and hardly had the flavour of banana.
Pasta was fab thick white cream topped up with mushroom and delicious chicken shreds are a fab combo,the pasta was real well cooked.  Albondigas was an instant favourite crispy french friend to dig into as you bite the bread dip it into the sauce,as its aroma engulfs you topped up with chicken meat balls well stuffed is a must have.

The pocket pinch will bigtime on the lighter side considering the quality and fab service they provide ,a definte 2nd visit on the cards to try out more of the menu, you can't get enough of this place at all....

Located right on Sudder street more towards where Sudder street meets the former Free School Street currently known as Mirza Ghalib Street this one is a hole in the wall place which is clean, hygienic and comes with a few lovely surprises. 

I will be honest about not wanting to go to this particular place because the other cafe's which offer coffee at such low prices usually disappoint me. The menu and pricing had honestly made me feel this was just another place with all pomp and no delivery. 

I was honestly too quick to judge because as it turns out this place is one of the best cafe's to relax in town. They give you complete value for money . The coffee they serve is not instant coffee and is strong and delightful my personal favourites are Macchiato and Affogato. During my very first visit a sip from my friend's iced Mocha made me realize it was superbly made but the amount of sugar was a bit too much for me. 

I have mostly liked most of the dishes served here which are usually different from what you get at most cafe's. For instance the Patatas Bravas is a much better cousin to a plain order of fries. here thick french fries are sauteed with a tomato based sauce which thankfully doesn't come out of a bottle and is delightful . One of my personal favourite dishes is the Albondigas en salsa espanola where these chicken meatballs in a garlicky lemon sauce is served with a side of french fries. 

The star dish of this place is the Pizza though. The pizzas that these people churn out are one of the best in town. They use fresh delightful Mozzarella and the tomato base is well balanced and full of flavours. 

I would wholeheartedly recommend this place which gives one full value for money and delicious food. 

My only possible complaint is that the pizzas are served only after 7 p.m. and the lack of air conditioning makes it a bit difficult to go to during those sweltering months.

From the very famous pizza to combos. They are very homely. It has a varied range of cuisine and all of them are equally good. You can find a lot of different kind of food at reasonable rates.

Raj spanish cafe. A cafe in apt sense.
Location : located at the end of sudder street. A little difficult to locate. Located a little inside the building , it's hard to catch your eye if you're new in the locality.
◆◇◆◇◆◇◇◇◇◇◆
Ambience: while the outside might disgust you in every way , the garden arch in the front gate will definitely cheer you up. Both outside and inside sitting arrangements. The place is mostly crowded with foreigners.
◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇
Food: Mexican , Italian , Spanish in a single place. Coming to the menu card of which 90% name I can't pronounce and understand. It was really helpful that under each name in the menu they defined the dish in plain English. The plus point , you don't have to pronounce the name. You can simply write it down in the memo they offered .
We ordered lasagna , chocolate soufle and chicken meatballs.
The lasagna was loaded with veges and cheese.. the chicken meatballs were mini bombs. All the flavours will burst in your mouth and will leave you carving for more.
Choco de soufle was a dessert consisting of a scoop of vanilla ice cream and hot choco lava cake. It's the best lava cake I've tasted.
●○●○●○●○●
overall: this place is a hidden gem. The food will definitely leave you drooling

When one's away from home, one often craves for some good company, delicious fresh food and drinks. Raj Da's Spanish cafe offers all of this and more ! 
Its a pure delight going to this small secluded cafe and just chill with friends or alone. Being a vegetarian, I would recommend the tomato mushroom pasta the most, but the food in general is mouth watering. 
The Cafe Latte or watermelon juice were my other staples overtime I went and I strongly recommend going for Watermelon juice to everybody. 

The ambience of the cafe is lovely and bright and due to its location makes it ideal for one to just jam and sing their hearts out without worrying about the city traffic that usually fills your ears. 
Raj Da, Amber, Carlos and the rest of the staff are lovely  people and they make the cafe a home away from home :D

Albóndigas en salsa española, being my favourite food from this restaurant ( I don't understand the spanish names in the menu so i order this dish mostly).
The prices are very reasonable and it's often filled with travelers so you're bound to have someone to talk to if you're so inclined :P

This is one of my most favorite places in town. My college and a pool parlor was nearby which meant I went to this place A LOT. Have tried almost everything on the menu. The nutella pancakes, scrambled eggs on toast, burritos are a treat for the pallet. The place serves authentic Italian pizza and replaces Dominos as my new favorite pizza joint.
It's one of those places which remains packed in the evening everyday even though they could improve the decor. The food is exquisite and cheap. The place is filled with foreigners in the evening.

This eating place is located in one of the most frequented alley of sudder street,aka near the famous "sunshine". It has an open eating place as well as an enclosed one. The first thing that will catch your attention is the number of firangs it is visited by. The place serves almost authentic Spanish dishes. And by aubthentic I mean food without pepper and salt at all :P
So one needs to garnish his/her food to satisfy our Indian taste buds. It also allows one to smoke openly. It has self-service and the people operating the place are very nice. Its a lovely place to hangout with friends and definitely worth a try. The quantity served is not much,but the prices are okayish.

A little yet uncongested multi cuisine cafe , this place really catches your attention at your first go. The food is delicious and the variability unmatched. From Mexican to Spanish to Italian with bits of american food , this place has got it all. Although the service could use a hand though. Out of the dishes we ordered , the burrito was the most delicious. They provide quite generous proportions as well.

This place is a little beauty. Thanks to Zomato for helping me discover this little wonder. If you are looking for a funky looking modern cafe, you have reached the wrong place. This cafe has a classic touch to it with a homely decor. I was quite taken aback because the surroundings of this cafe is quite shabby and at times I thought we have come to the wrong place or the place had been shut down. Though zomato claims it has outdoor seating, but in reality, it has a pretty indoor seating housing big tables of 6 as well as two klinai like seats. Since we were in a relaxed mood, we made ourselves comfortable in one of the klinai seats. We ordered Chicken Sandwich, Ensalada Templada, Burrito, Lasagna De Verduras, Iced Mocha, Fried Ice Cream and Soufle De Cioccolato. The food here is absolutely delicious and can beat most of the cool looking urban cafes that are cropping up at every nook and corner of the city these days. None of the items were too oily and spicy which makes it a favourite for the health conscious folk. I think the Iced Mocha is hugely overpriced. The salad and fried ice cream of this cafe tops my list of favourites.  The staff here may be too lazy to take your order himself and may ask you to fill in the items and their quantities yourself in the bill, but the yummy food will make you forget any grudge you had against them at the end of the day. Service is neither too slow nor too fast. This cafe will be remembered for its food till times immemorial for sure.

Feeling ravenous after a hard day at college, I and my friend decided to grab a bite at this cafe.  When we walked in, it was secluded as usual but gradually more and more people started streaming in. We were presented with the Pizza menu which is available from six in the evening. We ordered a pizza but sadly have to cancel our order when the waiter informed us that the oven will need atleast half an hour to heat up. We then ordered one Ensalada Mixta and one Fried Ice Cream. A salad will fail to impress its consumer without proper dressing and that's what happened with this salad which failed to leave a mark on my mind inspite of its amazing ingredients. We had to make the dressing ourselves with some olive oil, english mustard and some pepper. The ice cream was great as usual.

Very slow service but the food is good. You should only visit this place when you have ample amount of time. 
It's well known for its pizza and you will mainly find all the foreigners visiting this place.

Been here only once on recommendation from a friend. 
Took us a while to find this little place, so it would be good if you go with someone who has already been there before. 
We tried out the chicken combo. It was a within-budget deal considering the quality and variety. We also wanted to try the souffle, but it was not available at that time. So we went for the brownie and didn't regret ordering that.
Would like to see a makeover in terms of interior decor.

The location of this place is a bit hidden and Google maps doesn't help this time. It's inside a sort of a complex on Sudder Street, just before Roop Sringar's Store. Even though it's a non AC restaurant, the weather suddenly becomes a bit cooler here unlike that of rest of esplanade. The place seems secluded and a pleasant change from different restaurants. I went there with my mom and sis for lunch. We ordered Albóndigas en salsa española, 
Arroz a la Cubana and
Melanzane alla parmigiana.

Albóndigas en salsa española is meatballs in spicy gravy with a slice of bread and French fries. The meatballs were very delicious, the bread was fresh and the French fries were crisp. Arroz a la Cubana was a wrong judgment on our end. It's nothing but steamed rice topped with a double egg and tomato puree. Though it was not inedible but I am sure there are lots of good stuffs to try there. Melanzane alla parmigiana was pasta with spinach and cheese filling, more or less like a lasagne. It was the best amongst the three. The pasta was silky smooth, the filling was good and the cheese was generously added.

They only had two options for dessert so we ordered them both. The soufflé di ciocolato was a choco lava cake served with ice cream and chocolate sauce. The combination of hot and cold does magic for me. The brownie was also served with ice cream and was delicious too but the soufflé was the winner of the day. 

We wanted to try out more stuffs but were too full. Well I am definitely coming back again to try other stuff from their menu and especially for their soufflé.

This is the place to be, if you feel you can never have enough of the Bengali’s favorite way of killing time: LYADH. Tucked away in a cozy corner next to the very famous Sunshine store, this cafe emanates its laid back vibes in every way possible making you succumb to its ambience. After a whole day of shopping, we dropped in here and how glad did this place make
us! A few minutes of stretching our arms and legs, checking out the whole place, settling down and we were finally ready to order. A man arrived with the menu and the billing pad itself, to save us from the formidable act of pronouncing out those names. Huevo Rotos (fried potatoes with egg), Albondigas en salsa Espanola (chicken meatballs in Spanish sauce) and Soufle di Cioccolato were promptly penned down.

After a long wait and our hunger reaching its peak, food was served. All that huge amount of fried potato that came with both the items, made me wish we were sitting on a couch and watching a movie instead. Huevo Rotos is synonymous with comfort food due to its much loved combo of the gooey poached egg on top of perfectly fried potatoes. The albondigas en salsa Espanola comprised of some spongy chicken meatballs on a bed of very mild, semi-thick broth with chopped veggies served with a cold slice of milk bread. The meatballs were perfect with the right touch of flavours, neither too mellow
nor too overwhelming. Finally, the Soufle was crowned the dish of the day. A bit dull looking upturned cupcake, which was firm on the outside it oozed out a cascade of scalding hot, soft and buttery molten chocolate at the tiniest nudge by a fork. Teamed with a dollop of vanilla ice cream, the dessert screamed pure AWESOMENESS!

We enjoyed every bit of the food as we wiped off the last morsels from the plates until we were really very happy and full. The bill was extremely affordable which makes frequent future visits highly feasible.

P.S:  Go there to bask in its dreamy languor with the company of food.

This place is very hard to locate. In terms of food i would say it is just up to the mark. The pancakes are flat and bland. The servers are only for serving. We have to place our order by writing. They have got the new clay oven which cooks good pizzas. The lasagna is horrible and is filled with bitter tasting filling. The other pastas are okay. But i had a salad and Chicken,the salad was without any dressing. All over after a lot of shopping you can catch a bite here.

Raj Spanish Café situated in New Market area at Esplaned. This place is bit difficult to find for any first timers (this is in an alley right next to the Astoria Hotel). It has indoor and as well as outdoor seating (around 30 seating capacity). Ambience nothing fancy, very simple with a bookself containing some English and Spanish books (as far I remember) and few photographs along with a guitar. You can spend some quality times with your friends and dear one here with some good dishes.

Apart from Tea, Coffee, Lassi, Sandwiches, Soups and Salads they also serve Mexican, Italian and Spanish dishes. From their menu, I picked Albondigas en salsa Espanola which is basically a chicken meat ball in nicely made sauce along with French fries. It was good and must try.

Please Note: you have to write your own order on the bill and they put the numbers next to it for later billing! Also, they are very adjustable, and can modify any dish according to your preference. Also they offer some thin crust oven cooked pizza after 6pm.

Price: Pocket pinch : 400-600 for two

Will comeback for sure to try other dishes too… 

I went there again with couple of friends of mine to celebrate Nababarsha (Bengali New Year). This time i ordered Cafe Bombon, which is a espresso with milk and cream on top, if you touch it below you will feel hot and cold on top. Like that, it also tatse soo good. I will suggest to try it :)

After that we tried Pizza (read Funghi, the one with mushroom). It is one of the best thin crust pizza in town, with mozzarella on top and tomato base. If you want you can order with your own choice of toppings. Tell you what, it was heaven. P.S. You will only get it after 6 p.m.

At the end, it was time for Mediterranean Salad, and again they suprised us with fresh veg (cucumber, tomatoes, carrot, capsicum topped with feta chesse and lettuce).

And the guess what, total bill came Rs. 440 only :)

One of my friends introduced me to this food joint. It has both outdoor and indoor seating but no air-conditioning. Interior is very simple and there are many photographs present on wall. There is a book shelf having english and spanish books. This is one of the cheapest joint i have ever gone. I have tried ensalada mixta, burrito, espanadas de pollo and all of them are delicious. But what i liked the most is pasta con pollo e funghi though i dont like pasta that much. Honey lemon soda and brownie demand special mention. It is a must visit for pasta lovers.

A little hidden from the busty main road , this place is cooler even without AC.  We had several salads and pastas. All of them are really nice. Service is good , so as the sitting arrangements. Really would love to come back here for more.

An excellent option if you are looking for Spanish/Italian/Mexican food at incredibly low prices! If you are familiar with the Sudder Street area, this is in an alley right next to the Astoria Hotel, and the seating has an open, bohemian feel about it. Their pastas and Spanish fare is excellent, though I am yet to try any Mexican food from here. But their grasp of Italian flavours and Spanish taste is so good that I get the feeling that their Mexican items will be equally good! I like how you have to write your own order on the bill and they put the numbers next to it for later billing! Also, they are very adjustable, and can modify any dish according to your preference. The owner, Raj, is extremely courteous (with a killer grip on his handshake) and the lady taking our orders, Udita, was very friendly too. They have a lot of firang clientele, and I believe that tells you that the food here is definitely authentic global food - or they wouldn't come, would they?

I am definitely going back - this place is wonderful on a rainy afternoon with a plate of steaming pasta before you, or on a charged evening when the FIFA World Cup fever grasps the city!

Whenever its esplanade, its spanish cafe.have been there innumerable times. Cafe bombon and honey lemon ginger tea is one of my favourites. In the salad section try out ensalada mixta as I am a tuna fan. The spanish they prepare is one of its kind. U can try the Albondigas or chicken meat balls, en salsa espanola n the best of the lot is huevo rellenos, as both egg n tuna r my favourites.gambas al ajilo r a treat for shrimp lovers. In the mexican section you can go in for empanadas de pollo. And they prepare the best pasta of the world. Pasta con pollo e funghi.. chicken mushroom pasta.. among the desserts , you may go in for the tiramisu.

Visited this again. This time it was my all favourite pasta con pollo funghi. The white sauce with cheese was tasty as always. I guess the best pasta in white sauce ever. Then we tried the burrito. I did not quite like it. This burrito was made of chapatis rather than pitas. Then the best part was the oversized spanish cafe special pizza. It was amazing in taste , value- for - money and tastes amazing. Without saying I am going back again. This time for the amazing pizzas.

This joint is located in Sudder street... It is mainly visited by foreign tourists. The ambience is nothing to write about, the sofas are damp and a lil dirty too. It is a non-ac place . But one can go their sit for hours without any disturbances. None of the people are interested in knowing what you are doing and how long you have been sitting there.
People generally carry their tabs/laptops, reason being their cheap WiFi. Which is one really good thing.
The food is okay... Their combos are quite nice. But the pancake was a big turn off!!... It was really bad. 
The items are moderately priced.

Okay, finally i had to review this place. The last time i went to this place was in winter & post turning into a vegetarian. Anyways, I'll start with the most spectacular dessert from them - Nutella pancake. The best pancake you can get in Calcutta (former name) & obv. A die hard Nutella lover would agree. Lately they have excelled in cooking up mouth watering pizzas. So you must try them. Ohh yes the good part you get to choose the toppings. A pretty long list though. Next, you can try different flavoured Lassis. Don't expect it to be too sweet. They have upped the ante by re-investing slightly in the decor. And a dog named Ludo is also a great addition. It's specially known for their good sea food. And yes you'll come across a lot of foreigners there. Recommended. :)

A makeover is what we experienced at Raj’s. 
 Had a soufflé desire, so ended up there. First time, out of numerous visits, a big disappointment. 
Failed to serve any dessert except brownie and ice cream. Forget soufflé , even a simple thing like parfait was not available.
No mango juice available in the summer season.
Mixed fruit juice had banana all over it and tasted of artificial flavorings.
got high hopes & expectations. 

happy eating :-)

Last evening, I was at Raj's  with my partner and realized i must give a review.
It has been a year when he took me to Raj's on a sultry summer evening. Fresh back from our amazing food experience at Hampi, we discovered the same feel at Raj's. And we have been going back almost every week since then.My partner is not someone who goes back to the same place over and over again, but we made an exception for Raj's. Here's why.
My experience with Raj's Spanish Cafe is not just about eating. I have literally parked myself here evening after evening, filling myself with good food and having heartfelt conversations. Over our numerous visits, we have tasted almost everything on the menu ( except the sandwiches ) and never really had a chance to complain. We have had our Christmas Turkey here and our New Year Souffle here. Sometimes i have gone back just for the Huevo Rellenos or the Souffle. And i am sure i have put on a few kilos gorging onto their pizza ;) 
Raj's Spanish Cafe is not a fine dining cafe . It is a different world hidden in Sudder street. It offers an amazing array of cuisines , focusing majorly on Spanish and Italian.  Everything is fresh and full of taste. Mama-ji, the cook and his associates do an outstanding job here. Simple dishes taste brilliant, like the Bruschetta  and Gazpacho and the Parfait. Even their caramel custard, Flan de Huevo. My boyfriend never has spinach, but he had it here.. and yay, he liked it !! We have had many dishes outside their menu , some custom made as well :)
A must mention is the pizza. Raj offers a wood-fire pizza, thin crust, fresh sauce and oodles of cheese. We have tasted each variety on the menu and each one has got its unique flavor. Simply amazing. Italian Chef Carlo has created the best pizza in town for me !! 
Coming to Raj, the man behind all this. He is a wonderful person to talk to. Knowledgeable , friendly and he knows how to cater to the crowd. The footfall is mostly foreigners. They come in groups, enjoy the meals and the wi-fi. The food suits their palate. We always wrote "extra chilly" for our pizza order and once a fellow foreigner guy said we are mad :P
The decor is simple. We have seen it change over the year as a lot of expansion and customization is going on.You get to see how your pizza is being made in the big oven live in front of you. The sitting is comfortable.. choose your pick from open air or indoor. I always love the couch. And there is also a collection of books to check out. We even spotted a PADI handbook while we were planning our scuba dive right here :D
This is a great place to be. You can simply sit down for a cup of coffee with a book right off the shelf or you can chat away merrily. Food is good and good hospitality too. It wont dig a hole in your pocket but the hours spent here will always be memorable. It is a cafe in a true sense , one of its kind in Calcutta. 
Having said that, i would mention that the ambiance has changed over time.. too much smoke around and we miss the old days when the food was much more consistent and the service was amazing. A separate smoking zone would be great as it "bothers" the non-smokers.

Situated completely in a corner on Sudder Street, this place is easy to miss. My friends and I circled the place for about half-an-hour before eventually finding the cafe. But the whole trouble was totally worth it.
The ambiance is simply awesome. A total cafe like experience. I don't think I have had that kinda experience anywhere before in Kolkata. The place is extremely popular among foreigners, and as the sun sets, this place is packed with people. Its also very popular among youth in general, mainly due to the quality of food and ambiance.
The menu has variety, from Spanish to Italian to Mexican, and that too without being too heavy on the pocket. We were already partially full, and weren't in a state to have much. So we settled for tuna sandwich, and Seafood pizza (completely forgot the actual name :P). 
I didnt have the tuna sandwich, so I wont be able to comment on it, but by the looks of it, it was pretty appetizing. The pizza was good. Very thin crust, and you dont feel like biting through the dough. Something which I personally loved, although my friend didnt. For him it was too thin. Anyway, the sauce was fresh and so were the squid, and fish. 
That was the first time, I had a seafood pizza, and it was a nice change from the regular chicken pizza.
I am surely looking forward to visit this place again very soon. 
Pocket pinch : 500-600 for two

Second Visit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was waiting for an excuse to visit this place. And I got one last day. I had promised by brother to take him out to a wonderful eatery that offered something different, and this was the one place that came to my mind instantly. Having already visited it once, it wasn't difficult to find. The place was almost empty. After having a chat with the staff, came to know that its not the tourist season, and so business was down, as this place is mostly popular with the foreigners. We ordered lime sodas, Spaghetti el frutti di mare (Spaghetti with seafood), Nutella pancake, and Albondigas en salsa espanola(Meatballs in a Spanish sauce).
I was a bit disappointed when they served Fusilli instead of Spaghetti, but the taste made up for it. No complaints. Pasta with bits of octopus, squid and tuna served in a tomato-garlic base. It just couldn't get any better for a sea-food lover.The nutella pancake which my brother had too was good, as was evident from his face.We wanted to order a fried ice-cream, but as it was off-season, that was no available. So we dumped the dessert idea, and ordered the meatballs.And again no surprise. Lovely juicy meatballs, in a light flavored sauce, served with handcut french fries.The entire meal cost us just 350 bucks.

Rating : 4.5

A must visit for people trying something different.

Its one of those corner food places which people often overlook, but trust me, it's one of the best places where you'll find authentic Spanish, Italian and Mexican food.. I went there first with a Polish friend of mine, who stays at Sudder st. and after that, i went there quite a few times. 
The watermelon drink will do wonders to you, especially if you are  there in a scorching summer afternoon. 

I was there with a couple of friends, and we ordered chicken burger and french fries, ensalada templada (sea-food salad), lasagna and a pasta in arabiatta sauce. everything was fresh and yummy. The sea-food salad was just too good. we were too full to order more, and if you want to have the pizza, make sure you go in the evening.
And your wallet will seem to be smiling, coz the place won't cost you much!!!
happy eating :)

A place to simply go chill at after a long days work. I would recommend going with friends since the ambience is more suited to that. 
plus points. .. food is fresh and tasty and surprisingly cheap.  A great place to meet new people as well. 
Try the pizzas and the vegetarian sandwiches.  Also the pancakes if you're experimental. Do ask for a translation before ordering cause if a fancy name translates to fried potatoes n egg they WILL serve you fried potatoes n egg. 
If you're out to relax and have some great food that's not gonna pinch your pocket. . and if you don't mind smoke in the air..Raj's is the place to be.

After a long day shopping, decided to drop in for some pizza with a friend. They have built a lovely wood-fire oven and was dishing out thin crust pizzas and we decided to share one. Apart from our pizza, we also wanted some coffee - I chose a glass of iced cafe mocha while my friend got a coke. We also wanted some fries, but what's fries without a fried egg on top? Therefore, a plate of Huevo Rotos was ordered too. The idea is to break the egg yolk by poking it with the fries, and then subsequently, eat everything up. Its a situation where you either love the combination, or hate it. I LOVE it. 

The pizza we ordered was simple - a thin crust with a sprinkling of mushrooms, mozzarella cheese over a tomato sauce base. It was done simply, with blistered thin crust, and was quite good. Although not the best I have had in town the crust was absolutely gorgeous. 

At this point, another friend joined and wanted the Seafood pasta. The pasta came with a lovely seafood sauce, and a huddle of prawns and squid with some parsley on top. It was simple, light and delicious. Our bill was under 600/- for all this.

PS: The second picture uploaded is from past archives, for Anuj Sharma who requested it. :D

----- 27 Dec, 2013 -----

After a lot of brouhaha I decided to visit Spanish Cafe with a friend. We went there on a hot afternoon, and spying a Cafe Bombon in the menu, I ordered that along with a number of other dishes. A Cafe Bombon is basically a layer of condensed milk, followed by a layer of espresso, topped with whipped cream here. And yes, it was as good as it looked. I also ordered the Chicken combo, which was HUGE with two chicken cutlets, a side of chopped salad and a huge load of fries on the side. Although I found the cutlet to be slightly too dry, otherwise the food was good. 

After a lot of contemplation, my friend ordered a Mediterranean salad which was also BIG and the key was to add olive oil and red wine vinegar to it, which was kept on the side of the table, to make a vinaigrette. There was also a Canneloni which she felt was too dry. Her iced tea was good, but she needed to add sugar to it. 

My diet coke was chilled, and perfect for a hot summer day. Staff was attentive and caring, and I loved the decor and the books.

Update: did try the Gambas al Ajillos today and it was five crispy prawns in garlic oil served with two slices of toasted bread and salad. Ideally, dip the bread in the garlicky oil of the prawns, and consume. Simplicity at its best.

This place, tucked away in one of the back alleys of Sudder Street, used to be amongst my favourites when I was a student in the city. The food is good - simple and fresh. The tuna sandwich, patatas bravas, milkshakes and pancakes were all superb. Better still, this place offers you great value for money.
The owner of Raj (which, is eponomously named after Raj - the owner) is an extremely affable guy and conversations with him are always interesting. Last I heard, he went on a bike trip from India to the far edges of Europe and back to raise funds for a hospital.

Spanish Cafe has been a regular hangout spot for me and my friends for ever. It is inside a a tiny little lane on Sudder Street. It cannot be spotted from the road. 

My table is the first table which is placed outside. My chair is the last corner chair of the said table. Although sometimes I sit on the opposite side just to review the art work and try to spot as many monuments as I can. I usually end up visiting late evening like around 5 p.m. and stay on till 9 p.m. As soon as I walk in I demand that the switch off the tube lights and turn on the fairy lights and they usually oblige. The staff here is very accommodating and obliging and friendly and jovial.

Now coming to the food. I love their Sea Food Spaghetti and their Prawns in Garlic. The Prawns are served with bread and a plate full of tomatoes, onions, carrots and cucumbers. I usually dip the tomatoes and the onions in the garlicky oil, put it on top of my bread, sprinkle some salt and pepper and have them. They taste amazing. The Sea Food Spaghetti is perfection in simplicity. The put in squids and mussels and prawn in the Spaghetti. I also love their fried chicken which they serve with Coke. I usually request them to replace the Coke with Diet coke and they always do. But then their culinary skills for me reaches the ultimate zenith because they can make ghas phus(read salad) delicious . Their Mediterranean salad is a must have even for someone as strictly carnivorous as me. And no visit to Spanish Cafe can be complete without sampling their Cafe Bombon. It is the most delicious dessert coffee you would have the fortune of having.

I deduct 0.5 marks simply because of the fact that I believe there is some room for improvement in some of the dishes they serve.

The place boasts of serving quality Spanish food at reasonable prices. So like a typical foodie had paid a visit with some of my friends for a weekday brunch. The prices are quite decent and thus it would always give you an opportunity to explore new dishes but beware. The quality is good but the tastes are poor. The Spanish names in their menu does not offer me a chance to   name those dishes. 
One such dish was some prawn dish where it was tossed in garlic olive oil. It was served with just one piece of bread and some  raw vegetables. Some cucumbers, some tomatoes, one or two onions and a big lettuce leaf. I don't know whether the Spanish people actually have such dishes and equally loves this. If yes then I might be the wrong person to have visited the wrong place or if I am wrong the place is not doing wonders. There was also a dish which looked fascinating as it was taken down by a foreigner. So we also had ordered the same. It was nothing much but two sunny sides up on tomato rice. It was tasteless. Yes this might be the place where you get authentic Spanish cuisine. But as a bong I simply did not liked my experience. 
The ambiance is quite cool where you will find a lot of foreign people chit chatting and having fun. The service was not quick either and we had to wait for our dishes for a long time.

It was while Poorna my fellow foodie and I were exchanging notes did I realize that I had not written a review for Raj Spanish Cafe. To be honest as far as most of the dishes go the most Spanish thing about them is their name however there is one dish that stands out in this menu .... the Gambas Al Ajillo which is Shrimp in Garlic fried in Olive Oil which was super. The shrimps were fresh and had just the right amount of garlic flavor ..... the bread served with it was perfect to mop up the garlicky olive oil and it made for an excellent meal. Quantities are not large here we actually ordered a second round of the same dish. But prices are decent. The simple no frills decor is cheerful and bright. The crowd is typical Sudder Street with foreigners mainly. The place may be a bit hard to find so ask around or better still do what I did go with a friend who knows the way !  ;-)

This place is very pocket friendly but if you are looking for good ambience, then this place is not for you. I went there on  Christmas Eve with a friend, it was very crowded and most of the visitors were foreigners. It is located on Sudder Street but it is not that easy to find. The place is very small and hardly has 4-5 tables, it was so crowded that we could not understand whether to enter or rather wait outside. I asked the manager whether there are any tables empty, and he replied in a foreign accent "We don't have tables empty here, we only have chairs empty".

We found two chairs and made ourselves comfortable. Now coming to the menu, they serve Mexican, Italian and Spanish cuisines, most of which are snacks and starters of their respective cuisines. We ordered Ensalada pollo (standard mix salad with boiled chicken) and Ensalada de patata y atun ( sliced boiled potatoes with tuna served with toppings of mayonnaise). They did not take much time to serve and the food was good. The vegetables were fresh, a bit more garnishing would have done wonders. The waiters there don't talk much, they mean only business - they take the order and serve the food. The prices are very reasonable in spite of the fact that the place is mostly visited by foreigners.

Summarising, If you are looking for heavy meals, then this place is not for you. But for foodies like me, Raj Spanish Cafe is worth a go, at least once.

Summary:
Food quality and taste: 4/5
Ambience: 1/5
Service: 3/5
Value for money: 3.5/5

The place is surprisingly pocket friendly considering the people who they generally serve are foreigners and most places will actually not think twice before ripping them off. That is a really point in favour. And the portions are really good and won't leave you feeling disappointed. The food is a bit of a mixed bag. Average is how I would rate it. The prawns were actually pretty nice. Garlickly, grilled with the oil full of flavour. Having it with the bread it really nice. I just wish they went a bit easy on the amount of green they serve. They serve a ton of it. Isn't a bad thing, with it actually being healthy, but does turn out to be a bit of an overload. Also, they could toast the bread a tad bit longer. 

The chicken salad was okay. It did cry out for some bit of a dressing. A little complexity in terms of something with a bit of zing could have really lifted it. The veggies were fresh and crisp and were actually enjoyable on the salad till the point it got monotonous. I really expected more from the iced mocha. 

Two things which really bugged me. The savoury chicken crepe. One, it was bland. Lacked flavour. Doesn't have to be spicy, but it just felt as if it wasn't even seasoned. Also, the crepes were way too thick to be enjoyed. It just got very tiring eating that huge heavy crepe. And then the flan. It wasn't up to standard one bit. The texture was smooth and had a lovely wiggle. But it lacked the sweetness which should be there and on top of that it smelt really eggy. You would expect the vanilla to drive in happiness into you, but you just don't get it. Either the sugar or the vanilla could have masked the other issue, but both were missed, quite sorely if I may add.

The manager/person who took our order, was a nice helpful man and did offer pointers. The place could really improve, if only certain things could be looked into. They aren't difficult to solve, but they just make such a massive difference to the food you eat.

Tucked away into a crook on Sudder Street, this cafe is quickly becoming a Favourite. 
The decor casual and the atmosphere informal, the place is perfect for a hang-out session. No one asks you leave but rarely do you find the cafe empty. A constant stream of foreigners drop by and combined with the bonhomie feeling the cafe gives out, for a minute you might even doubt you are in Calcutta. 
Coming to the food, there is am amazing plethora of choices. Spanish, Italian and a few Mexican dishes thrown in but all delicious. A personal recommendation is the Chicken Burger, which comes with a generous.portion of fries and coke, a yummy Fungi & Chicken Penne formagio and my personal favourite: Chocolate Souffle. The pancakes and brownies rock too.
Pocket Pinch : You hardly feel it. 
So in a sentence, I LOVE it.

Most foodies in kolkata have probably heard about this place and have a vague interest in going there atleast once. I won't deny the fact that I belong to the same group. Having seen it mentioned umpteen times in the newspapers, I decided it was time for a visit. Located on Sudder Street, the place can be called the ultimate hangout for foreigners in the city. We were the only customers of a darkish hue. As is the case with such establishments, the prices are bloated. The space is smallish, with 2 tables out front and 3 inside. Decor is snazzy but minimal, overall providing an international space for the international traveller. The atmosphere is homely. Although the servers are nice, they don't have the time to explain the dishes to the Indian patrons. :( That was a real turn off. Wait time is also a problem area. The huge bread furnace used for making pizza bread is situated just beside the seating area. Though it's interesting to look at, the sense of unease at being seated next to a large oven is a bit stifling. 

There is a choice between Spanish, Mexican and Italian cuisines. In spite of a sufficient number of options, there's nothing really worthy of remembering on the menu. The reason for this is that most of the dishes are snacks and starters in their respective cuisines.  They do not capture the essence of the culinary tradition, serving instead as quick grub for the foreign traveller who are homesick. That's all nice for them, but for the average Indian foodie it leads to a disappointing end as they do not find something which provides them that extra something. In a globalized world, most of us have had atleast a few of those dishes somewhere before. Also, there's the typical tea, coffee, ice creams and snacks on offer, prices of which are absurd to say the least.

Lets move on to the food. We first had the Pasta Aglio Olio Pepperonica. 
Official description : Pasta fried with capsicum in extra virgin olive oil.
Reality : A bunch of uncooked pasta tossed into a lot of olive oil. With no other garnishing or spices, the dish moves steadily on to a disaster. And the almost cupfull extra oil which spills on to your clothes does not help either.

Then came the Huevos Rellenos. This is the point I nearly lost it.
Official Description : Tuna and tomato sauce mixed with egg yolks and topped with mayonnaise.
Reality : Boiled eggs cut into two and filled with salty nonsense. The name of the dish may be a mouthful but the dish itself is anything but so. I did not find any tuna mixture and the mayonnaise tasted stangely stale. :I

Chakraborty Tips : The clientele is definitely not the fine dining type. The pot smoking hippy seated next to you may not be to your liking. But then again, the tattoed backpacker may provide the best of conversations. :) But it's also a great place to meet new people from all over.

Raj's ‘Spanish Café’ is located in one of the hidden lanes of Sudder Street just opposite of roadside stall called Tirupati. It'll be closer from Free School Street side and definitely take your time to find the place, it also sharing stage space with the many little kiosks and shops that sell cheap clothing of retro Indian, trendy and hippy outfits. I went there with my friend Sandipan Banerjee﻿ for having a quick lunch. We are the only Indians there and most of the tables are filled with foreigners. The menu had names written in Spanish & Italian and the orders need to be written on an order sheet provided on the table. Also, a daily special is provided on the side, where you can order the day's special if you like. I was very hungry and ordered ‘Arroz A La Cubana’, ‘Huevo Rellenos’, ‘Albondigas en salsa Espanola’, ‘Flan De Huevo’, Honey Pancake and Chocolate Pancake. Huevo Rellenos is six pieces of half egg whites with tuna, mayo and yolk fillings. Arroz A La Cubana is a classic Spanish dish, the pie shaped double egg poach comes with a generous amount of rice and tomato mash. Albondigas en salsa Espanola is meatballs in Spanish salsa with French fries and a piece of bread. Flan De Huevo is Spanish caramel custards. Pancakes are big as pizzas. I loved all the dishes and they taste quite fantastic. Spanish cafe is an awesome place to spend a couple of hours. This place is worth visits.

If you are looking for something off the beaten path and something that is simple and cozy, Raj Spanish Cafe is just the place for you. I have always told that kolkata has little hideouts scattered all over the city and this small joint is always frequented by foreigners who live in sudder street. It transports me to the era of  flower power, shopps selling jholas, om motif t-shirts etc. 

Although the place is simple and quite essentially a self service outlet,where even the orders need to be written on an order sheet provided on the table.  It has a very cozy feel to itself . The staff is warm and very polite and you can see the warmth with the smiles on the people sitting here . Do not expect any fine dining, this place is quite essentially sudder street on a platter to you, Simple and Homely, It attracts some people even ever day . 

I have been here a number of times and i simple adore their cold coffee and their caramel custard. The custand is not overtly vanilla and the caramel is just right amount of bitter sweet.

I would not recommend the pancaes as they are merely thin crepes with some toppings. I like it simple so i can have it . it can be a little bland for the Indian palette. 

Even the pastas are slightly tough for the indian palette ( with a bite , al dante) as we Indians do tend to slightly over cook the pasta  and its also a tad bit under seasoned keeping the palette of the international people in mind. But i like their pastas a lot . 

The croissants are always fresh as are the muffins and they always have a good assortment of teas on offer. 

Overall if you come during a lazy afternoon with a book, this is an awesome lace to spend a couple of hours catching up with yourself 

Spanish cafe is like a time capsule ( feels very non calcutta ) 

Keep up the good work .

The waiters are too busy impressing the foreigners. They do not pay any heed to " Indian " customers.

The served French-fries with fried egg, which tasted lousy. And I don't even remember the complicated Spanish name they had for this.
Then we had Tuna, which was another disappointment. 
Total waste of money, considering how overpriced the items on the menu are. Disgusting food quality.

Foreign tourists frequent this place NOT for the food, but for the " hospitality ".

This cafe serves nice food.Salads aregood.Raj (owner) informed that the menu  has been made after consulting his (spanish) guests.they have trained his cooks too.
so food served have simple flavour.not as strong as the indian version / take on these dishes.
for those who love strong flavours there is always tomato sauce/pepper/oregano.
coffee is good

Let me start with a word of caution. if you are extremely hungry and need something filling then this might not be a good place to go to.
Located so unusually that the most ideal way would be to visit with someone who has visited the place earlier. 
The cafe has a very informal air about it with long tables, comfy seats, neat decor and the like..and considering the regulars of this cafe, it works wonderfully well.
I went with my friends and ordered the Huevo rellenos which was wonderfully well made and very good and at 60 bucks it is decently priced. The next thing we ordered was pan tomaca. I was disappointed to say the least! It is nothing but diced raw tomatoes on bread. 
We also tried the ensalada templada which was nice and fresh but I think the price was not justified considering the only exotic ingredient being the squid. 
We finished it off with a chocolate pancake. The pancake was very good, nice and soft with chocolate sauce on top..
But in all the dishes the portions were way too little and left us hungry even after our meal.
It is mostly a self service restaurant.
Overall very mixed reactions from this place.. maybe I will go back if I am on diet in the future...

Raj's Spanish Cafe is located in one of the hidden lanes of Sudder Street. Will take you some time just to find the place. Reached the place at around 9:25 and the cafe closes at 9:30 so I must say the owner was really cool to make sure he served almost anything we wanted. The Chicken Combo is nice. Especially keeping in mind the cost factor you have to say it's cheap. The pasta was also nice. We had a chicken pasta with white sauce and it tasted great. The balance of the cheesy flavor with the pepper was great. Generous quantities for a single serving too. Would visit the place again definetely.

I visited this restaurant for breakfast one morning. It was a little difficult to find,given how sudder street is littered with cafes and other eateries. It's not visible from the mainroad so it's best to keep track of the house numbers when looking for it. The locals didn't seem to know of the place. 

It's a low-cost cafe with a relaxed ambiance and an open kitchen. The first impression was that the menu is very limited. There's a huge array of salads and nothing that really makes for a substantial meal. We tried a seafood salad. The quantity was good but it wasn't really appetizing. There was nothing on the menu we were particularly keen to try. The pancakes are mediocre but they have nice croissants. They have a range of pastas which are probably the only really filling things on the menu. There was this shrimp fried in olive oil that we had hoped would be interesting but it didn't live up to expectations. Among their desserts,we tried the caramel flan and it was straight out of the fridge and probably a little stale. What is GOOD about this place is their coffee. Hot or iced,their drinks are the ones that we really enjoyed. 

The food certainly didn't please and there's not much else on offer to make up for the food. I think a more versatile menu and a menu card with only english names/proper explanations could be useful in making the cafe a favourite,spanish or otherwise.

Raj's Spanish Cafe is tucked away in a blind alley off Sudder Street, but is patronized by a number of tourists and locals who are drawn to the cheap food on offer. However, selective ordering is necessary, as not all the items are good.

The ordering system used here is rarely followed in other restaurants or cafes in Calcutta. A pad and a pen are provided, and the customer is expected to write down the name of the item(s) and the number of dishes required.

The service is average. The food is usually good - at least, the items I have ordered and eaten are fairly decent. Since I shy away from ordering soft drinks in restaurants, I have never encountered watered-down drinks. If this cafe follows this practice, they need to stop it immediately.

I liked the Mediterranean Salad and the Tortilla de Patatas. My favourite item is the Espinaca a la Crema, which is rich in cheese and bechamel. To conclude, the Cafe Bombon is a very good option.

A good place to drop in for a quick snack, and its distance from a main road means that it is very quiet. Moreover, it's possible to sit for long periods and chat, a luxury fast disappearing in the city.

What a rip off. The burger is supposed to come with fries and salad and coke. When it came there were only some fries. When asked about the salad the guy had the audacity to tell me that the salad was the leaf of lettuce and singular slice of tomato and onion in my burger.!! And they didn't serve the coke till after i demanded it.

Names on the menu - Difficult to remember, but food that you have - hard to forget.
Tucked away behind some shops on Sudder street, not many know about this place. 
You get good coffee here. the cheese toasts are pretty cool. Looks sophisticated but menu is very simple. Nice place to hang out with friends and gossip. 
Quantity is mediocre, staff quite attentive and the food good to read and eat. 
Pretty chilled out place.

I had heard a lot about this place and decided to give it a shot, but it performed abysmally. Difficult to locate for those not in the know, Raj Spanish Cafe remains hidden away in one of the many dusty by-lanes of Sudder Street, sharing stage space with the many little kiosks and shops that sell cheap clothing. 
I went there with a friend on a weekday afternoon, only to be greeted by the sight of one of the waiters(?) stretched out on the benches, having his afternoon siesta while customers came and left. Granted, it is one of the more informal eateries to say the least, but greasy tables and the general air of neglect does not help its case. 
Ever the optimists, we ordered pancakes (Strawberry for me, Cinnamon Lemon for him) from an impressively diverse menu. 20min later, we were given two semi warm crepes as large as a Pizza, with sickly strawberry jam on one, and two lime wedges with a light sprinkling of cinnamon on the other. It was strictly okay.
I ordered Pasta Al Pesto for the main which was disappointing on several accounts. The chef forgot to season it with salt and the pasta itself was undercooked and tough. I loved the aroma of basil that permeated through the dish, but had to pretty much uncork the salt shaker in order to down it.
My friend ordered the Chicken Combo, which came with a small bottle of coke, fries, salad and batter fried chicken cutlets. The negatives were too many:
They actually diluted the coke with water until it tasted soapy.
The lettuce in the salad was old, the cucumber bitter and the whole thing under seasoned. 
The chicken, while served hot was incredibly tough and fibrous and needed a generous dab of mustard from the clogged, half empty bottles that rested on the counter.
The fries, however, were delicious. Much better than the hyped McDonald's version. 
We didn't risk ordering dessert and wisely left the place after having paid the bill, vowing to never return.
While things are definitely cheap at the cafe, I'd advice you to take all the fancy sounding things you see on the menu with a large pinch of salt.

Wi-Fi is available (which is extremely rare for Kolkata), but they make a photo of your passport,  a photo of youself, ask you what hotel you are staying in, check your visa -- and send it to the Police through a special web form. Hillarious! I have never imagined anything close to this possible.

Besides, Wi-Fi costs 25 INR/hour.

And to access they add your Wi-Fi adapter MAC address to the router rule list. Wow.

Food is OK, menu is very European and deserves applase. The kitchen is a bit scary.

was introduced to this delectable nook by a friend when wrapping up a photowalk. have tried a number of things from the menu and have found them quite appetizing. the atmosphere is laid back, and all that would seem missing are the green meadows. drop in with your mates, get yourselves a few rounds of tea, order some pancakes, sandwiches or anything heavier to eat (from their rather interesting menu) and spend a few hours conversing without burning a hole in your pocket. I would strongly recommend this joint.

A wonderful little haven in the middle of all that is "Sudder Street". For me this place is this wonderful unwinding place after a nice cycle ride with my Ride2Breathe group. Easy, casual and serving wonderful, value for money food! And of course the wonderful aroma of their coffee!
Raj, the owner is a wonderful guy and it's fun to chat up with him. He is well travelled and it is a pleasure to hear him speak Spanish and interact with the numerous Spaniards who throng there! The place offers wi-fi too! Most of the times there is an amazing display of photographs / paintings on the walls.

I really loved the Pasta al pomodoro which I had for lunch once day - which was essentially vegetarian but they added chicken when I asked for it

A perfect place to be. Everytime!

Commonly referred to as Spanish Cafe, I first heard of this when it hosted Spanish supporters during Euro and later the World Cup. I went to this place around a year back and recently, back to back, three times. And, I will probably head here again for more. This place is worth visits.

Quick suggestions :

1.Huevo Rellenos - At 60 bucks, the six pieces of half egg whites with tuna, mayo and yolk fillings is quite worth-it. They are generous quite with the minced tuna. It tastes quite fantastic.

2. Chicken Combo - Pollo, as the Spanish call chicken. Two pieces of fried chicken come with salad and A LOT of fried potato sticks. The chicken is tender and goes really well with the multi-coloured salad. The best part are the potato fries - which easily beats the over hyped McDonalds. It is quite filling.

3. Iced Mocha - Forget CCD, come here. The bitter coffee is well shaken with cream. I think its my favourite drink here.

4. Tortilla De Patatas - A classic Spanish dish, the pie shaped omelet comes with a generous potato filling. It might be bland to the Indian taste, but with the olive oil and Tobasco sauce (both kept on the table), it becomes real good. It is served to you with two pieces of soft bread.

5.Pasta Aglio Olio Peperoncino - This was  real surprise. I did not expect it to be so good. Being a staunch non-veggie, I would skip meat for this. The pasta is    fried in olive oil, and along with the fried pepper, you have a complete Spanish trip of an Italian origin. I loved the fried tasted of the pasta.

All good. However there was one dish that disappointed us massively. Espinacas Saltedas. Our Indian taste bud might be the one to be blamed, I don't know. What sounded promising as sea food on a bed of fried spinach, turned out to be near raw and reeking sea food on an oily bed of a lot of spinach. It was rather bland. I wonder if they could do any adjustments to this brilliantly sounding dish. 

The Mango Lassi is quite a hit too.

They have chargeable Wi-Fi, but they need your passport number for access. Most of its customers are foreign tourists, backpackers and hippy junta. You might also have a few chat with some of them. They also have a mildly well stocked travelers library. I wonder if it runs on 'Give One-Take One policy' - given the number of foreign language books I saw. I've spent one afternoon reading off their stock. They also make very good Earl Grey Tea. 

Locating this place might be difficult. Its inside a compound that is famous for  its shops of retro Indian, trendy and hippy outfits. One of them is called Sunshine I think. This place is right at the corner of the compound. It'll be closer from Free School side.
