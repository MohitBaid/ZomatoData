Excellent rolls. Studded in the busy Gariahat alleys this place serves one the best rolls in South Kolkata. The onion that they add is sauted perfectly. Try the chicken rolls for sure. Will be back :)

One of the best rolls outlets of gariahat and it have been well known to people for years. It is located near Ballygunge A.C. market , just parallel to the street vendors without and seating arrangements but only takeaways.
 Their rolls are filling with accurate prices. This price is quite under-hyped with respect to its quality and years of excellence. 
I had chicken roll while going through some shopping spree. It is always an experience having their rolls.

This was one of the best roll counters I have had rolls from. Try their tikia roll and you should be a happier soul. They generally listen to your customizing requests (like me always asking for très très picquant ... Extra chillies). Overall taste wise nothing to complain. Also the location is favourable, right in the middle of all the mix. Go for it!

It is an extremely small outlet located next to Ballygunge A.C. Market without any seating arrangement.

The rolls are very filling and pretty economical.

However,it can be challenging to stand in the narrow pavement while waiting for the order especially while it's raining.

This is my go-to roll corner if I am in the Gariahat area. I prefer it to other snack-bars for a very basic reason....instead of raw onions, the Parama guys have an option of adding fried onions. It not only enhances the taste of the fillings, but also spares me the pungent odour of raw onion....something that’s quite a turn-off for me!

I swear by their mutton tikia roll. The egg roll and chicken are no less tasty too. Nevertheless whenever I am shopping and hungry, I visit this little shop to give a treat to my taste buds.

One of the places i visit frequently when i go to gariahat and prefer to have rolls. Located on the streetside opposite bazaar kolkata, this is just a small shop, with literally no standing or sitting place. But its a roll center, so i dont mind placing order and then going away with the roll,rather than having it in front of it. I have tasted most of the varieties of roll here and even though it isnt the best, but tastes good with good quantity chicken and mutton pieces. I prefer to take home their tikka,which they fry with onion,served with lime. Overall, if you are hungry and want to spend less, go for this place, it maybe a small joint, but wont disappoint you in terms of taste and price.

This roll kiosk  is located at Gariahat , well known  place for rolls and kebabs.
Tried chicken roll, mutton roll. Both were yummy , soft and less oily with good stuffings.
Pocket pinch is reasonable as per quality and overall a nice place for roll lovers to relieve hunger pangs .

রাস্তায় বেরোলেই মন টা কেমন খাই খাই করে আর সেই মন কে সান্ত করতে গিয়ে প্রথম ঢুকেছিলাম আর পছন্দের চিকেন রোল দিয়ে শুরু করেছিলাম । তার পর থেকে যত বারই  সামনে দিয়ে গেছি একবার করে খেয়ে গেছি । পকেট হালকা থাকলে পেট ভরানোর জন্য নিশ্চিন্তে আসা যেতে পারে । আর বিশেষ করে রোল যারা ভালবাসে তাদের জন্য অনবদ্য ।

This definitely is my favourite roll centre at Gariahat. Have been indulging into their rolls, kebabs since time eternity and the live still hasn't gone. Rather a tiny place beside Mohendra Lal Dutt store. I have also seen people queue up to get their orders.
Chicken roll, chicken tikkia roll both are delicious and that's what end up having everytime.

Well shopping in gariahat and returning home without having a roll its just not me. We were near Pantaloons and thus opted for this small shop as Campari (THE BEST roll corner)is quite a walk from there. But that was the big mistake. I had a chicken roll and took 2egg roll as parcels. My roll was a complete disaster. Greasy and oily to the utmost. On top of that it tasted bland. n pitiful amount of chicken. Basically one may think that rolls in gariahat being so cheap is a great deal but its not. They make their rolls long so that customers think its quite filling but instead they stuff up their roll with mostly salads. However the egg rolls were a big success. They used aloo in it and had a hint of lemon so that it tasted different. Nevertheless I'm not going there back again.😏

Went for some work in Gariahat.... It was raining cats and dogs while I passed by this quaint small roll shop in the street. Though I don't indulge in roadside food much....I was hungry beyond words and decided to try out this place as a no option choice . A lot of people were taking away rolls and I was recommended by one of them to try the mutton egg roll. I was pleasantly surprised.  The roll was piping hot and had a good filling inside. I went back quite full. Considering they took only Rs 35 for the roll...must say the shop is too light on pocket.

My first roll from the shop was when i was in Class 3. It was a Chicken Tikia Roll which costed 9 bucks, I distinctly remember. Prices are still pretty cheap. Must-try!

Never judge a book by its cover. Maybe this idiom is perfect for Parama Roll Corner. A small snacks bar at Epicenter of gariahat junction. First comes to ambience this bar is much cleaner and healthy than other para food joint. 
Now recipe and price....both are extremely reasonable and pocket friendly. And their service is awesome. You don't need to wait in a queue. Must try CHICKEN SASLIK ROLL. It costs around 65 bucks but after eating this concept of so called roll will take a toll I bet. A full stick of chicken shikh kebabs wrapped inside the roll

I tried the chicken shashlik roll from this tiny roll outlet in Gariahat based on the recommendation of a fellow foodie friend and I was pleasantly surprised.This is an extremely small and narrow shop with hardly any space for even two people to pass.But they do make a wonderful shashlik roll.There arent many places where you would get a shashlik roll but this place here nails it.The juicy succulent pieces of nicely marinated chicken with tomatoes and capsicum inside a light yet crisp paratha is an absolute treat.I loved it.I do not know about the other more common rolls but this place and its shashlik roll is definitely worth a try.

Well, to be frank, this outlet has clearly made me understood the concept of the parantha of a roll, in which the stuffing is served to you. And what I deduced is, the parantha needs to be a bit thick, unlike the thin ones which this outlet serves.. Second, prices are higher than nearby competitors, like #Bedouin. And third, the outlet is too tiny.. You have to push others, to place your order.. And the rolls aren't that great either, considering the price you pay... At 60 rupees, you would expect a meatier, tastier and more mouth- filling "saslik" roll. But sadly, the outlet fails to deliver...

Ah... for some reason this is a favourite roll place for me. For years I have looked at the various kababs on display inside the tiny glass enclosure. The narrow shop barely has enough space for two people to pass. Customers stand on the pavement (often pushed to the side whenever anyone wishes to pass). You try to move aside and there is a small passage with a sign not to block it!!! I do not think the regular rolls were anything great. But I wouldn't have them. Coming back to the display. There were two items that caught my fancy. The Tandoori Fish and the Chicken Shaslik. Both tasty to the hilt. The tandoori fish I would have as an accompaniment at times, and even though once I got real smelly pieces, it didn't stop me from trying it out again. The hero of the story is undoubtedly their Chicken Shaslik Roll. Tender chicken pieces (very mildly spiced) skewered with pieces of capsicum, onion and tomato, well grilled. When this goes into a lovely thin paratha and wrapped around it, be assured the premium you pay is well worth it. Give it a try. I have been asking Zomato to include this outlet for ages, and I finally see it listed! They also do the standard veg, egg, chicken, mutton tikia rolls.
