Had their egg rice and chicken Manchurian last day ...it was really very nice  ..satisfied by the taste‚ù§.. Pocket pinch wasn't high.. But by the the time their order arrived it wasn't hot we had to reheat it. Their delivery option should be a little fast.

Tried a panner roll from here, less oily and full of stuff of big panner blocks. The roti was perfect and so as the marinated onions. The only let down was the use of tomato ketchup and chilli sauce at the edges of the roll, which takes all the taste away
