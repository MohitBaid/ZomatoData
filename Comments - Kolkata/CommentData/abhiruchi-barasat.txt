I ordered momo yesterday and it is good enough. The quantity was almost good and the momo was soft and marinating was good. I think people must go for this if they want good fast food.

Veg Gravy Noodles was not so good.
Actually, I think they don't know dish.
Fish Tikka was good and spicy.

Interesting setup for siting, sandwiches are Yummy, Paneer roll is delicious. And I Love the taste of Momo also. But the soup isn't that much tasty.

Chicken Momo was good but the soup wasn't up to the mark and it'll be better if you add some handmade achar or ketchup. And We've to wait a little bit, so if you could make it fast also.

Finally I have found a good food joint whoch delivers through Zomato in Birati and vicinity. They are having seating arrangent outside so it feels great to munch hot snacks in with cold breeze!

We had Fish Fry with tarter sauce and by far this is the best fish fry you can get spending 50 bucks! Fish was fresh, outside crust was crispy and homemade tarter sauce just amplified the overall taste!

Seems this is goinh to be my destimation when hunger hunts you in the evening!

Not that bad. Average food. Need better quality ingredients. The texture of the chicken pakora was basically batter with very less chicken. Maybe provide coriander/garlic chutney with every order to make customers happier.

Average fast food joint. Seating arrangement is outside the shop. Starters and snacks are quite good.  Main courses are average. Pocket friendly. Have delivery which is a plus. However would suggest to eat at the place. That way you ensure quality. Chicken Pakoda was quite good.

Ordered burger,  chef special chicken drums , momo

Delivery was by a riksha puller who came with his ricksha.. who was idiot and illiterate after explaing my address 10 times he couldn't understand my address.. 
On asking explanation they said there delivery man was absent.

Burger was too much salty and completely cold..
Chef special chicken drums are too much spicy and with too much artificial food colour was used my hands become red after eating 
Momos were cold and saltless

Pathetic experience 
They are simply running businesses because no other good delivery service is available in birati...
