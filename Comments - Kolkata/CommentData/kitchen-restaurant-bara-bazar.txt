Finally "kitchen restaurant" was on my list of swiggy and I got to order from here.
ORDERED-
‚ñ™Shredded Kadhai Chicken: small chunks of chicken with layers of onions & capsicum, in a red spicy gravy, cooked nicely with oozing oil :P
‚ñ™Khuska: Well my mother cooks khuska rice & I have had it many times. Just keeping the same thing in mind, i ordered khuska, & this was extremely dissapointing. They just sent biryani rice along with a piece of aloo/potato. Thats it. Idk why they name it "khuska". What my mother cooks is called "khuska" which is perfection.
Don't fool people around :)) 
All in all, the pocket pinch is not much, fits in your pocket, the quantity of the khuska cum biryani was really good. But the kadhai chicken was less in quantity when compared to the price. 
Both the items costed me 235/- including 25/- swiggy delivery charge.
As of now: Recommended.

A small shop but with excellent food. Better to order takeaway than sit and dine as the isn't much of an atmosphere. Yes it's a bit shabby looking but the food is top notch.

Value for money ,the food is regular tandoori fare with quick take away and home delivery options ...For people in the area it's a blessing . The Afghani chicken is a must try. It is not much of a dine in option ,but serves good kababs and curries at reasonable prices.

We also ordered Malai Chicken which was a bit too sweet with was soo juicy and soft... 
Best place for kabab...

But the ambience is not so good but okish.. but if it's only about food and yummmy kababs one should visit this place...

An underrated lip smacking kebab lover's paradise, Kitchen is located in a 'not too hard to locate' Phears lane near Central Metro station.
One bite and I fell in love with the chef's hand! (okay am being cheesy, just to thank my voracious friend, who's a regular here since god knows when.)
The malai kebab, lahori kebab, hariyali kebab and firni are the few dishes one shouldn't miss here. Biriyani is sumptuous and a little mediocre compared to the giants in the city,but that would pass if you're on tight strings.
It's a compulsory bookmark for every broke college student like me.
Don't go by the look fellow foodies, trust the gut (read- the tastebuds) and you won't be disappointed.

To have lunch after a busy morning,my friends and i went into this food joint. Suggested by my friend Arko Roy . Frankly speaking,outwardly the ambience and the decor of the restora didn't impress us at all. Very dim light, old table and chairs,unhygienic kitchen and one or two flies around. But as we always say,food must be the final answer. We ordered Hyderabad kebab,chicken cheese Kabab,mutton Biryani,chicken handi masala. The first item put us in despair while the cheese Kabab restored us. The Biryani was blunt with extra rose water. The handi Masala is an usual chicken curry,no extra mark for that.
At the end we had cold drinks just to avoid acidity problem. Kitchen could not satisfy us at all.üëé

This one is a rather derelict joint which is best for getting home deliveries.. Located in an old alley, it has few seating arrangements and no decor to boast of. I use it because it delivers food to all departments of Medical College and does so in record time... 
The biryani is a favourite of many of my colleagues. I would suggest that u go for the chicken malai kabab, reshmi kabab and hariyali kabab which are unexpectedly tasty.
 Prices are pocket friendly and quantity sufficient. 
Keep up the steady work of punctual deliveries to hungry junior doctors !!!

Hmmm.... This restaurant may be called a medicos ' s canteen outside the campus of Medical college kolkata...we have ordered food from this restaurant for innumerable times .... And "hello kitchen" food have excited our taste buds in most of the occasions of our 5and half years of hostel and college life... Coming to the food... Mughlai section is beyond average for sure...specially biriyani,kebabs,tandoori items are quite good...chicken drumsticks are also very juicy... Cons-chienese dishes are really bad...and the food they serve is very oily and spicy...but mughlai dishes are invariably offers you some more extra calories... So never mind.. Get your phone and order for" hello kitchen food!"...

Kitchen is located at Phears lane near poddar court,just 5 minutes walk from central metro station.Today I've been there with my family.Kitchen is famous for their tandoori & kebab items.I've never seen this huge varieties of tandoori at any restaurant in kolkata.So we've tasted here just tandoori items & kebab items.Atfirst We ordered one full plate chicken kasturi tandoori & chicken lahori tandoori.After 5-6 minutes both has came.Both tandoori items are very tasty,specially chicken lahori tandoori.In Chicken Lahori tandoori,they give some masala inside the chicken,it tastes delicious & unique. Chicken Pieces are very big.Then we ordered one plate Murgh Mumtaz & Chicken Spicy Tikka kebab.Murgh Mumtaz is very soft,but it tastes average.But Chicken Spicy Tikka Kebab is very tasty,it is fully marinated with masala.Atlast we've tasted their Firni.It tastes mouthwatering.Ambience is average,there is no air conditioner.Food service is fast.Price is also reasonable.Next time I'll try their chicken gravy items & biryani.

Kitchen starts with the same monotone of "ELLO KICHEN" when you call them. I have been a regular there to their small but clean outlet near central metro station and home delivery as a medical college hostelite..their mouth watering biryani, chicken chatpata, khuska, chicken butter masala have made them a cult for the medicos and other hostelites around college street area. The mughlai food is tasty and the price low but their home delivery can be late sometimes. Overall kitchen has nourished all medicos: students and doctors alike from the start to the end of their study and through their careers and will hopefully continue doing so. :-)

Whenever I come here , 90% of the time I try their CHICKEN TANDOORI , MUTTON BIRYANI and CHICKEN CHATPATA .

in Medical College Kolkata,Kitchen comes as fate accompli.
Coming to the food.The biriyani is good,the rice is very oily though.The kebabs are decent but their best dish¬†
according to me is their Chicken Chatpata and their firni..
Very moderately priced and the convenience of free hostel/ward/OT/on call room delivery.. Cant survive without Kitchen! :)

Average food quality.....not much innovation... Quantity is less compared to other restaurant serving same kind of dish like food king .....
But is very clean and popular among locals as it is the only restaurant in that locality...

Surprise! Surprise!
Ambience: Well not to talk about much there. Its about 30 seater as far as I remember from my first and only actual visit to this place. The place is shabby but clean. The best thing to do is to order for a home delivery or a take away from Kitchen.
Service: I will talk about home delivery here. Rather hospital (Medical College) and hostel delivery. Kitchen is a favourite among  the College Street hostelites and doctors from Medical College. They deliver upto 2.5/3 km for a minimum order of Rs.250 (subject to change).
Food: Here lies the 'surprise'. Kitchen, in this foodie's humble opinion, serves one of the best biriyanis in town! And that too at 110 bucks! Its light with clear long grains of rice, a well-cooked potato and a juicy piece of chicken (the mutton piece was not bad either).  I love their butter naan and chicken bharta, which was my staple while working at the hospital...yummm!
Recommendation: Chicken Biriyani, of course!

This place serves the best biryani in the city. Period. Be it the rice, the succulence of the meat, the cooking medium or the spices. They tend to get it right every time. and you can trust me on this. The mutton pasinda, kadhai kitchen is pretty awesome as well. The only problem is you cant sit and eat over there. The feel is that of a cramped eating house. And I think the fine mughlai 'karigar' who rustles up that fantastic biryani is asked to cook the chinese as well. Cuz the result is a nightmarish new cuisine. Just stick to the biryani and staple side dishes and you will keep travelling 8 kms to get there.

this is a place which tries to cook everythng but finishes with a total mess up....      now about their mughlai dishes, they make a medium quality biryani,over burnt tandoor,tasteless chap,too much oily kasa or do piaja,and all with a typical peculiar nausiating smell.....i dont know why the try to make chinease...if u ever dare to taste their chnse dishes,blve me or not,you will start hating chnse....i have nver seen boiled noodls in one bowl and gravy in the other!!....     if u ever dare to dine in you will definitely be boiled!! however they have a very wide home delivery system.which is also very effective and eficient....         mughlai-3,chnse-1,north indian-2,dine in-1,home delivey-4...
