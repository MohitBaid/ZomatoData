Went for lunch buffet on Nabami 2017.Ambience was really nice.Each staff dressed in Bengali style for festival purpose.Now coming to food.They have provided their dishes with authentic Bengali style what I liked very much.As drinks they served aam pora sorbot and gandholebu r sorbot.After that they provided the starters plate to us.In which fish kabiraji was my fav.Though it was not a proper kabiraji, it was something like fish butterfry.Also they had chicken chop,veg chop,beguni etc in starter.
In maincourse they had chicken biriyani (okay type),mutton jhol(salty but okay),chicken jhol(fine),Bhetki macher paturi(awesome),Doi Rui(didn't tried).This is all off the non veg stuffs.I didn't tried veg section too much.But they had ghee Bhat,dal,chorchori,dhokar dalna,luchi etc.They had a live counter where they made different chats according to your wish,As we have ordered mix samosa and papri chat(good).
In desert section they had such a good Indian collection.They had baked gulabjamun(awesome),malpoa(awesome),2 kind of sandesh(good quality),hot chocolate(good),chocolate mousie(good),Rice kheer(good),Misti Doi(good).
Ambience: Nice 4.5/5
Drinks:Nice 4/5
Starter: okay type for bengalI buffet 3/5
Maincourse: good 4/5
Desert: Awesome 5/5
Service:good 4/5

When you go to a resturant ,apart from the food,you look for two things...quality and service. Frankly speaking,both lack when it comes to Durga Puja week.
But this restaurant tried to maintain the quality and service with a smile in the face.
The resturant is on the First floor of Hotel Park Prime.
We went in for a nabami lunch buffet which was a bengali style buffet with fish,chicken and mutton.
The staff was dressed in Kurta or "Punjabi" what we call in bengali. They greeted us and showed us to our tables.The waiter were polite and served what we asked as soon as possible which was impressive.
The resturant was well decorated with puja style theme and the plates were replaced by earthen plates and earthern glasses.(looked amazing with a banana leaf on it).
Now comming to the food. The starters had alu bhaja,beguni, vegitable chop ,chicken chop and a amazing fish Kobirajji. The Kobirajji was one of the three items that I found was too good in the menu.

The main course included ghee bhat,dal (2nd item that was good), chochori,alu jhinga posto,DOI potol,DOI Rui(very bad pieces) , alu Dia chicken, Kolkata style biryani and a mutton curry(3rd best item).

The desert was huge with baked gulab jamun,malpoi,sandesh,kheer,sweet curd,mud pie,choco Moose and pan.
Nothing out of the ordinary in the desert part.

So overall amazing service ,nice decor,less crowded, and maybe above average food. Guys you can try this.Pics attached.

The food is brilliant at this place and the service a bit better but once again it needs a lot of improvement like their coffee shop Nosh. If at lunch time one needs to wait for an hour for food when there is no other table occupied in the restaurant it speaks very poorly about the preparedness for customers. On top of that when you find crumbs of the morning breakfast buffet on the tables not yet cleaned again it upsets you and hence the 3 rating which else would have been 3.5.

The food as I said was very good be it the pasta, the spaghetti bolognese or the baked fish. Each dish was pretty well prepared although the spaghetti needed to be a little more juicy. One for the feeling that though these dishes are on the menu the chef is a little more comfortable with Indian dishes. Be that as it may we enjoyed our meal but the service really messed us up.

Cheers,

I have never been so disappointed before. A visually stunning restaurant offering pretty much average quality food which is heavily overpriced. This sums up the review for the outlet. Staff are unprofessional and service is not at all satisfactory. Presentation of food is nice though but taste is very average. Ambience and interiors are top notch. Wish they raise their food quality pretty soon and lower the price bar.

The restaurant is located in the first floor of the hotel Park Prime on AJC Bose Road near Minto Park while going towards Beck Bagan. The ambience is amazing, but somehow it looks that people hardly visits this place with less staffs around, though the food is excellent and the staffs are very friendly with an instant service. Visited on a Sat evening for a quick take away for dinner - luchi and Kasha Mangsho  which tasted very delicious with chunks of mutton pieces - hardly i have experienced anywhere in kolkata.

Been here during Durga Puja special Buffet.  Got coupons from Nearbuy app.  It was value for money as the price was only 799/-. It was dinner time,  lights were dim creating a great ambience. The staff were very quick & courteous. Lets come to the main part.....  FOOD!!!! 
Let me tell you they know how to prepare food making you feel like its made for you specially.  It was a Bengali Traditional Cuisine so as starter we had Alur Chop, Beguni,  Aloo bhaja & so on. As for main menu they had all you can think of; Mutton, chicken, prawn, fish, chicken biryani, ghee rice, dal, dhoka etc etc...... Dessert would definitely make your day. We had rasogolla, sandesh, gulab Jamun, tart, choco mud pie, misti doi, rabri, 2-3 types of ice cream.We definitely had one of our best buffet & would like to visit again next year.

Well well well. What a discovery! Was looking for a few dining options this puja. I settled upon Khanasutra for the family Astami lunch.  Selected it purely because of the chocolate focus of the deserts on offer. But the authenticity of the Bengali dishes they served in the buffet bowled me over. The doi Rui, mutton curry, fish kabiraji, fish Paturi, chola dal, luchi  everything carried an authentic Bengali stamp. Deserts included my all time favourite - Hot chocolate mud pie n Malpua among an allay of other traditional Bengali sweets. The service and the decor were nice enough to keep you the mood. Had an extremely pleasing meal that day.

Being in a hotel, expectations automaticaly rises regarding the ambience, food and staff. But khanasutra crushes all of those. I happened to go there twice both of the times with my friends. Ambience is still ok but food was really bad. We were served breads befre n subzis came 10mins later. 
At 10:30 only the staff started rushing to kick us out so that they could leave early. We were having our meal and they started picking up the napkins and giving finger bowls. As we were the only table occupied on a saturday evening, expected them to serve us with peace and joy but they were more in a mood to just push us off!! 
I definitely wouldnt like to to back to it

Khanasutra serves excellent food but is a bit pricey !!

Located in Hotel Park Prime, I have always heard mixed reviews about the place. The restaurant is big and spacious. The decor was mediocre though it seemed very appealing it the pictures. All in all, it provides a comfortable seating space. The staff were cordial and warm.

Coming to food, I stuck to the oriental cuisine and loved every bit of it. Chilly paneer was superb and one of the finest I have had in a long time. Main course was nice especially the stir fried greens in soy and chilly garlic noodles. Burnt garlic fried rice was decent but lacked that extra punch of garlic. Assorted veg in sichuan sauce was nice. Dessert consisted of chocolate mud pie which was superb.

Overall, I loved the food and since I had a discount voucher , it was all the more value for money. Otherwise it does carry a premium.

A beautifully decorated restaurant on the 1st floor of Park Prime Hotel. I had made a prior booking for dinner for a specific table but when i reached there the manager said the table is reserved but you have to pay 5000 for the dinner service on that particular table but this was not conveyed to me earlier. At last we sat in some other table. We ordered Veg food. The food was served very beautifully & it had a great taste. The food here is value for money.

Do visit the place once & avoid booking in advance.

In one word, PATHETIC! 
This is not at all a place worth coming. Had come to this place a few weeks back. Naans were given as if they were simply dumped on our table, most of those slices were burnt. In pineapple raita, there was no pineapple and it tasted sour and were not at all fresh.
We had to cancel the raita and the behaviour of the manager was also not good. Highly disappointing.

A forgetful experience. It was our anniversary and we had visited the restaurant for lunch. We walked in around 2pm, the restaurant was empty. We were the only guests. We ordered for a Fish Tikka for starters. It was delicious but we had to wait for about 45 minutes for the same. The service was slow and I had to raise my hand every time. I expected better service given the fact we were the only ones dining. For main course my wife ordered Chicken Dum Biryani. I have to say the joints by the street side who serves Biryani at Rs. 70 serves better Biryani that what they served. It was full of garlic and lil undercooked. I had ordered a Grilled Chicken Breasts for my main course and it was a Disaster. It was served cold, overcooked and rubbery. Just after the first mouthfull I had to returned the dish. It was a horrible experience.

Went there for their Christmas brunch today. D complementary wine tasted like gazel's blood mixed with piss ...d food was flat (taste wise).Referring to the service to be slow would be kind of an understatement. I guess they hired some snails disguised as waiters for this occasion. There were about 20 people in d brunch but yet more than half of the items were always empty. They took at least half an hour to refill each item so by the time u would have moved to the next course ( even a refill of vanilla ice-cream took them 45 mins)I guess it would be the most sneaky way of saving buffet food in history. And no, being insistent about refilling didn't help either. Coming to the food, they served stale flat bread, really stiff and tasteless chicken, average shepherd's pie, cheese that would actually make u throwup (I checked with everyone, they all felt that way), shahi tukra that actually made me feel that I would loose a tooth. So all in all a complete waste of money. Take prior reservations and go to barbeque nation if u r going to a buffet for food, or just any place whatsoever except this one. This should be named PatienceSutra as u would be trying ur patience level more than their non-refilling items.

Went for sunday lunch to relax after  hectic week. Took 4 cousins along, to ultimately disappoint ourselves. Worst experience. Bad mocktails and for food I'm short of adjectives. No masala just raw grinded pepper n cloves in kadhai paneer. Dal makhani which is an usual order for anyone having north indian food, was just boiled with minimum salt. In fact instead of using black urad dal, they used masoor dal. No gravy no spices. It was an embarrassment with cousins along, who filled their stomach with papads. Better to stay hungry than go to this place.

Khanasutra is located inside the Park Prime Hotel off AJC Bose road close to the circus avenue crossing..Went there for a Puja Special lunch on Saptami..The ambience is what will leave you awestruck..simply elegant and artistic..loved the way the interiors have been designed to play with lights and colors..An unconventional prism like structure which allows light to percolate through creating a unique vision of lights and shades..The service was just flawless, highly professional and impeccable..won't give you the chance to complain..only thing I felt that when the crowd starts pouring in the wiaters seemed a bit confused keeping up with the pace..Now coming to the food it was basically a Bengali Buffet and the Spread was literally HUGE!!!From starters to main course to deserts,you will be spoilt with choices..Tasted the following items:
Welcome Drinks: Unlimited helpings of GONDHORAJ GHOL and AAMPORA SHORBOT.. Both were refreshing on a hot afternoon and the jaljeera blended to the Aampora provided that punch..
Salads and Chaat Counter: They had a Live Counter serving various combos of chaats..tried the Alu Tikki and it was decent enough..The Salad counter was also elaborate..Special mention to the CHICKEN HAWAIAN Salad..made with mayonnaise,subtle, balanced flavours, dont attack your taste buds..
Starters: 2 Non-Veg and 2 Veg varieties were there..FISH KOBIRAJI was dissappointing..lacked the crispness of egg on the outside,and a bit gooey in the inside..also Basa was used instead of Bhetki degrading the dish..MURGIR CHOP was nice enough..spicy and crispy-a perfect bengali starter..in veg they served BEGUNI and VEGETABLE CHOP..Beguni was huge..one piece is enough to fill your tummy..
Mains: In the Non-Veg they served- MUTTON BIRIYANI which was quite delectable..the rice was grainy,well flavoured and the mutton pieces were so soft,they literally fell apart..BHETKI PATURI,finally used god quality bhetki and the dish stood apart..loved the fact they dont overdo the dish with too much mustard and spices,helping to keep the flavour of fish intact..DOI RUI..standard bengali delicacy,it was creemy, a tad sweeter and authentic in taste..CHINGRI MALAIKARI.. again dissappointed cos it was not the traditional dish are palates are so used to..Firstly they used small shrimps which kind of killed the magic of the dish..also the gravy lacked the punch..way too watery..MUTTON JHOL with ALU was just sublime..much like the Biriyani the quality of Mutton was superlative..and the dish will remind of the special Mutton Jhol we Bengalis are so fond of in the lazy Sunday afternoon..KOSHA MURGH seemed redundant after this sumptuous fare and it was not well cooked either..the Chicken was stiff and dry and the gravy lacked the acidity..
Though I didnt venture much into the veg section they put up some really popular and Pujo special items like LUCHI, CHHOLAR DAL NARKOL DIYE, DHOKAR DALNA, CHORCHORI, DOI POTOL and ALU JHINGA POSTO..Honetsly some other day I could have finished the meal only with this veg dishes but it was hard to overcome the attraction of the non-veg dishes that day..
We Bengalis love our Desert and keeping this in mind the desert spread was a memorable one..prepared with highest expertise it served dishes like MALPUA, BAKED GULABJAMUN, ASSORTED SANDESH, MISHTI DOI, PAYESH, HOT CHOCOLATE MUD PIE, DOUBLE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE and ICE CREAMS..I wont go into the details since all these dishes are so legendary..just a special mention to the Double Choco Mousee..such an inspiring dish..loved the blend of dark and white chocolate..the taste will linger on your tongue for long..Overall the spread was truly a sumptuous one, the deserts stole the show while the Starters failed to match the standards..You can eat your heart out and still cant taste like half of the dishes..a splendid treat for your palate and soul..The place was extremely hygeinic and soft tunes of Dhaak added to the royal pujo mood..Since we opted for groupon vouchers our cost comes to Rs.750/- per head..Surely going back soon to try their a-la-carte menu..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 5/5
Service: 4.5/5

Bhuribhoj was d offer from park prime khanasutra during durga puja this year. I visited the restaurant with my parents and wife. Khanasutra was a very famous restaurant one however it has lost its charm in recent times. 
The ambience was great. Very well decorated, ambient lighting deserves 4.5/5. As part of Bengali bhuribhoj, the plates and glasses were of earthenware. This was particularly nice touch to the menu, ambience and feel. Arrangements  5/5.
Food quality was good mostly except bhetki paturi and luchi. Starters like chicken chop and fish kabiraji were perfectly accompanied by aam panna shorbot and gondho lebur shorbot. My parents loved the starters and mocktails. In main course, prawn malai curry, doi rui, biriyani, ghee bhat, cholar dal and malpua, payesh, doi, sandesh and many more in desserts were good in terms of quality and variety. But paturi and luchi were the USP of the buffet and they were not up to the mark. Food 4/5.
Staffs and service was the part I didn't like much. Though there was nothing bad, there was nothing good about them too. 3.5/5

I visited khanasutra for maha saptami lunch. Really enjoyed my lunch buffet with my hubby and bro as they both are food lovers. Good quality food. Enjoyed bhetki paturi and off course chingri macher malakari. But staff need to be more energetic. A very good experience for a first time visit.

This review is purely based on groupon deals.
I had visited khanasutra thrice in a span of one month all three times with a groupon voucher, once for lunch and twice for dinner. The place is most of the times empty.
The groupon deal is superb and it like more bang for the buck.
Must try Dal Makhani - very nice, paneer angara kabab, subj seekh badami, hara bhara kabab, paneer makhani and kadhai paneer, fish tikka masala - superb, and tandoori roti.
Stay away from soups, alu dum, navratan korma most of the chicken items as i found them to be hard and seemed not fresh. Masala kulcha on first too occasions was rubberish and chewy. Laccha paratha was not so good either.
Food quality is very good but there was no consistency in taste. Only the last time which we went all the food tasted yummy and looked like the chef has really put some effort.
Service is top notch full points for this. Decor and ambiance is also ok.

But again as i said the review was based on groupon deals and in end i don't have anything to complain of.

cheers

It is indeed a good restaurant., located at minto park. The ambiance and decor here is delightful, and the music added more beauty to it. The restaurant was almost empty, n that made feel more comfortable. It was a b'day lunch from my love. Staffs were very cordial with a smile on their face. We had a coupon with us, so i have no idea about the food price but i can surely tell u about the quality (i guess quality is more important than price).
Now coming to the food, we had soup nd kababs for starter. We ordered tomato dhaniya shorba soup, it tastes wonderful, i loved it.. Along with that we had murgh malai kabab (it was yummy) nd angaara tikka ( looked like tandoori but soft). For Main course we had Butter Naan,Fish Tikka Masala, Homestyle Chicken Curry, nd Jeera Rice. I was so surprised with the Fish Tikka Masala.. i just loved it.. it tastes awesome.. soft,spicy,yummy.. Chicken was okay types.. the quantity presented was more than enough for both of us.. Atlast we were provided desserts which we selected was Icecream (chocolate). Overall, our lunch was awesome.
A big thanks to my love

Went to khanasutra for a lunch at dashami. The entire process was completely unprofessional. Restaurant food was bad. The staffs were a little less trained. Service time is exceptionally long. And above all like me, do not get yourself carried over by the name park.

The ambiance of this place will bowl you over. It has a lively romantic lighting setup and decor with options for private dining as well, making it a good option for a visit with your family or loved one. 

★ LOCATION : Located in the first floor of the Hotel Park Prime (previously known as Chrome), near Minto Park.

★ AMBIANCE : Finally, I arrive at the primary reason that made me so eager to visit Khanasutra. The entire place has an asymmetric sense throughout. One pair of opposite walls is full of the circular glass windows visible throughout the hotel, while another is is like a huge glass matrix. The private dining area is centrally located, with the walls and ceiling having the asymmetric shape with designs allowing incandescent light inside to pass. We were awestruck. 

★ FOOD : We went in hungry, for a huge lunch. The food items were presented very nicely.

> FRUIT PUNCH : Delightful. Would love to try it again.

> MURGH MALAI TIKKA : Soft, smoky and delicious. Tasted even better with the chutney.

> MACHHI AMRITSARI TIKKA : This was even better than the previous! Leaves you craving for more.

> PEAS PULAO : Decent pulao with way too much peas. :P

> MASALA KULCHA : It was more inclined towards the lines of Aloo Paratha, but was liked by us nevertheless. 

> DAL MAKHNI : Thick and tasty dal makhni, with just a little more flavor it could have been even better. 

> KADAI PANEER : Standard vegetarian dish, was quite good being teamed up with masala kulcha.

> DUM KA MURG : This was a rich, spicy chicken preparation which had a really, really delightful taste. However, the quantity was equally disappointing - each of the two chicken pieces was smaller than an eraser. The remaining pieces weren't very tender either.

The quantities were disappointing.

★ PRICING : We had a meal voucher with us, but keeping that aside, the original prices were extremely steep (added to fact that it's inside a luxury business hotel) . 

★ SERVICE : The restaurant was more or less empty, and the staff had previously informed us that we wouldn't have needed any reservation prior to the visit. We got the food pretty quickly. Impressive. 

So, overall it is a luxury restaurant with a grand ambiance. On the whole, the tastebuds' experience of the food leans towards the ordinary side.

I visited this place with five of my friends recently. 
The ambience and the interior decor are beautiful. 
The service was a little slow at the start but they picked up their pace eventually. The staff members were cordial and answered all of our queries with a smile. Now six people means plenty of food so we got to taste a variety of dishes. Here goes... We ordered fruit punch and blue lagoon for mocktails, both were pretty good but I have to say the blue lagoon could use some improvement. Among the Indian dishes the kebabs were great, and this is from someone who doesn't like kebabs much. I didn't try the Kashmiri rice but my friends did and they said it was nice. Coming to Chinese now. For starters, the crispy chilli babycorn was a little too spicy for me, but if someone likes spicy they'll love it. The pan fried fish was "perfection". For main course cottage cheese in Hunan style (I finally learned the English for paneer) and Fish in oyster sauce (I'm a stickler for oyster sauce) were both good. The burnt garlic fried rice and the hakka noodles were also better than most I've had.
All in all we truly loved the place and I would love to visit again ❤

Today I visited this restaurant along with my mother-in-law as she desperately wanted to visit this place. The ambience and the decor were SUPPPPPEEEERBBBBB. The staffs were very attentive. About the food, all the items were really good. Let's begin:
Dal shorba- the waiter recommended this item, and I was more than happy to try it.
Murg Angara Tikka- too good
Mahi amritsari- awesome
Dal makhni- its a must try
Peas pulao- nice
Lachha paratha- so-so..
Murg makhni- the gravy was good but the chicken was tasteless
Sarson machhi- another must try.. Lastly Butter scotch ice cream- yummmmyy...
Planning to pay a visit again to try the Chinese cuisine...

I have been there once only because my first visit hasn't been quite thrilling. The ambience and lighting are no doubt very good but the food and service are disappointing. It takes long to serve you with the dishes and the kebabs can improve too. For starters, we had murgh angaara kebab which was juicy and tender but the machhi gandaraaj's perfect taste was ruined by the extra pinches of salt in it. For main course, we ordered navrattan pulao which I loved, dal makhni which could be way better, sarson machhi which was nice and dum ka murgh which was nice too. For desserts, we had vanilla and butterscotch icecream scoops. There is always scope for a lot of improvement on the food and service. :)

The ambience is simply amazing. I loved the dome shaped private dining section. Its a brilliant option if you are planning to surprise your loved one. They even decorate the place with balloons and setup the table for a perfect romantic candle light dinner. The service is a little slow. Mixed emotions for the food served. Crispy chilly babycorn was delicious with just the right amount of tanginess. Spring roll was disappointing. It was oozing with oil as you bit into it. However, the staff were courteous enough to offer a replacement. Very few menu options for cocktails; some of them weren't even available. Overall, it was a nice experience because of the ambience and the well natured staff.

They didn't provide napkins neither had cloth on table.. It ws just tissues on the table for everything.. Secondly the buffet ws also not up to the mark according to the price they charge..

The interiors and the ambience is really good but that doesn't add to the quality of food that they provide.
Well for starters the reshmi kebabs were really delicious but tandoori potato was a disaster.I had these tropical fruit punch mocktail which was tasty and could be tried. Now for the main course russian salad i felt wasn't good enough(though i haven't had it bedore). kulcha was okay but not the fried rice.then we had meethi chicken and mixed veg which were pretty okay.the mixed veg item on the other hand was really good. Anyhow the show stealer according to my family members was the baked rasogollas and i think its a must when you go there.
We basically had north indian dish and since it is a multicuisine restaurant you could definitely try the other dishes.
service was prompt and good.

This is basically a north Indian restaurant. I loved the interiors. Simply amazing.very rich and authentic.  Well there are also cabins which have perforated screens. They are just beautiful with amazing playful lights. Different ambience offered which I loved. The food .. We had ordered quite a variety so I can vouch that the food wasn't great as pricey it was. Or maybe because of the large group the service was damn slow. Not even the crispy chilly babycorn was crispy or had chilly. It was sweet and soggy. The vegetable tempura was offered without any dip. In the main course all I liked was the garlic naan and the malai kofta. The dal makhani was just about average. The staff were quite friendly and polite. Would like to try this place again to change my view about the food for the better:)

Went with my family for fine dining to celebrate a birthday.We asked them to decorate the booked dining area with baloons over ph.When I went there I was overwhemed with the decoration...they placed baloons all around the table and some of them on it..was looking simply awesome.
Now coming to the food...north indian cusine tasted realy "v v gud"...the quantity was even good enough..
Its crispy chilly baby corn was superly amazingly..yummmm.!!!A Perfect one.

first of all would like to share that the hotel has changed its name to Hotel Prime. Now coming to the ambience part of Khanasutra  its nice but there is an ample amount of scope to improve it.Food was nice except the thai red curry we ordered which was really not up to the mark and service was very poor we had to even ask for fork, desert spoon which we didnt even receive . last of all there was even some error in the bill which eventually they rectified and the worst thing is that they were refusing to accept cards which is very unusual for a star rated hotel.

I was there twice. Once with my friends and the second time with family. First time when I went there with friends, it was a weekday and had a pleasant experience. The second time I went with my family was a weekend and had a terrible experience. We waited for someone to attend us for about half an hour but nobody was courteous enough to ask us for even a glass of water so we ultimately we decided to leave. Surprisingly, no one  was perturbed even if we left complaining. Here is my take on Khanasutra -

Good
1. Ambience and decor
2. Food is pretty decent

Bad
1. Very poor service - There is not one single staff looking over your table and hence you have to ask for the same thing from three different people. Staff attitude is indifferent towards the diners need.
2. AC does not work, which is terrible in the summer heat.

Overall I would not recommend it to someone who is looking for a pleasant dining experience.

The Chrome hotel looks pretty weird from the outside.But probably it was only that fact that i had decided to visit it on my brothers birthday!We went for dinner at khanasutra, which again had unusual but good infact excellent interiors.The interiors have many dome like rooms with patterned cuts giving a different feeling.The restaurant is dimly lit.The chair i sat on looked good but had one poor leg, wobbly, making me a little uncomfortable.But no problem i ignored that :)
Our order was indian along with some contintental fare. Paneer tikka kesari,kofta something, dal zevrat along with masala kulcha.We also had a lasagne which was again good. 
We ended our meal with malpua with rabri and a mango mousse and the deserrts were the best!

Our servers were very hospitable and took care of our needs. 
The desserts are a must try here.The food is reasonably priced.

Coming to the food. The food is really tasty. We ordered continental dishes and the food was well cooked. They have a wide variety of dishes to choose from.
The staff is friendly and courteous. 
I would recommend this place to everyone. I would rate it 4.5 if they include some innovative desserts in their menu.

This hotel and restaurant by Rose Valley group has a very upmarket look and feel. The valet parking adds to the luxury feel.
Coming to the food. The food is really tasty. We ordered continental dishes and the food was well cooked. They have a wide variety of dishes to choose from.
The staff is friendly and courteous. 
I would recommend this place to everyone. I would rate it 4.5 if they include some innovative desserts in their menu.

I was lucky to win food voucher worth from radio mirchi. the food coupon was worth inr 1500 at khanasutra. but when we reached khanasutra for the dinner (after making appointment) I was disgusted with the treatment theybdid with us. At every moment we were made to feel that we were lucky to win free food and we were buch of people who had come begging for free food. Even no plates were offered and were only presented after they had served food and that too afrer being requested for. we were offered paper napkin and when I enquired why we were kot served napkins as were served in other tables, I was surprised to hear their reply that we were eligible for paper napkins since were not paying and had come with free food vouchers. My question to them ia aren't the food voucher being purchased? didn't someone pay for those. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. morrover the spread for buffet that they were offering was rubbish. Radioirchi should also look intk this and take feedback of people whom they present free goddies as prize.

This is a place I will never forget. I have visited there once and will remember, so that next time I can avoid this place consciously. Being in the heart of the city and with a huge building, I found this place look very impressive from outside. Story started after we get into and order starter. From starter to desert, I can't recommend a single item that you will enjoy. One dum Biriyani, which is very average in taste, forget about Arsalan, even your local Biriyani shop can deliver you a greater product than chrome Biriyani and do you know, how much the third class element cost you? It is 700 bucks, with/ without a egg or raita. Lack in number of staff will cause you deliver one order to your table, hours after you really need it. Environment and interior looks good, the only thing that I can say good about this place. 
Moral: this should be the last place to be in except only if you have a fat wallet and most of it coming from your father's pocket.

Khanasutra, Chrome hotel is situated in the heart of Kolkata.... It is equi- distance from all the parts of the city..
Khanasutra has beautiful interiors and plays lovely music but the restaurant was pretty empty.... The sitting arrangement was great inside the themed structure, at the center of the restaurant.... The presentation of food is remarkable but the Veg-Food tastes average.... The servers' politeness were killed by their slow service....

Khanasutra.. It is located on the first floor of the Chrome Hotel in AJC Bose Road.
The interiors are good but they could have had more seating space if they had avoided the brown metal sculptures. We were a group of ten and went on a Saturday evening and to our surprise we were the only people present in the restaurant. Oh yes, getting a reservation here was really a head ache and more so when you find out that the restaurant was fully vacant and still they don't give reservation it was real turn off. Coming to what we ordered..
Soups : All were good of which Minestrone was the best followed by Hot & Sour Soup and Cream of Mushrooms, Asparagus and Tomato.
Starters : Makai Malai Tikki and Crispy Chili Babycorn.. Both were okay.
Among the Mains, Spaghetti Arrabiata was the best, Veg Au Gratin was good and the Oriental fare of Noodles, Rice, Veggies in Ginger Wine Sauce and Schezwan Sauce was Passable.
All desserts - Chocolate Mousse, Darsaan and Gulab Jamun were good, but nothing extraordinary. 
The mocktails are were very ordinary and tastes like normal aerated drinks.
The service was very slow. Overall it was a satisfactory experience.
Three stars from me.

Had a three course dinner in khanasutra last week on Saturday. It was average food was good but the service was not up to the mark. Had to get up from my chair thrice to get my table cleared, to get a glass a glass of water and to place my orders. Though me and my wife were in a holiday mood and wanted to spend some quality time together but it was never to be for some unprofessional staffs !!!!! Please try to get some energetic staffs to increase the value of your place !!!!! I know it can be far far better !!!!!!!!

The restaurant provides a selected variety of Indian, Chinese and Continental cuisines. The ambience is refreshing but not exceptionally good. The seating arrangements could have been better. We ordered traditional chinese chicken hot and sour soups which came exactly after 10 minutes. We were pretty much satisfied with the soups and decided to go for Indian cuisines. I liked the taste of macchli gandharaj but the quantity was not sufficient as per the pricing. In the main course, we opted for Murgh makhani and Kadhai paneer along with masala kulcha. All the dishes were attractively presented and cooked to perfection. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.

Ambience is good.
Food is Ok!
However, it was found that the staff was rushing through the meals.
For instance, we were not even through with the soup and they served starters and so on.
Overall, the experience was fine.

Thankyou. :)

The ambience is amazing but cannot compensate for the very average food & service. 
We wanted a different table but were told that they are all fully reserved, whereas after dinner when we left, there were only 2-3 tables occupied in the entire place.
Furthermore they were rushing through. It was like even before we could finish a course they wanted to bring the next course & get us out.
It always felt like we were in a fast food place & not a proper restaurant.

It so happened that while passing Chrome on Poila Baishak we thought of dinning at Khanasutra. Situated on the first floor of a 4 star boutique hotel, the restaurant looks like a maze of perforated wooden partitions. The brilliantly lit restaurant will surely charm everyone entering it.
To compliment the occasion of "NABABORSHO" it was decorated in a traditional Bengali custom. All the tables were done up nicely with a green coconut placed on an earthen jar. We were greeted warmly by the staffs with a glass of complimentary aampora sherbet. On this festive day apart from their regular fares they were offering two types of Mahabhoj thalis - one with the combination of chicken and chingri & the other had the combination of mutton & hilsa. 
Since we were in the mood to have a meal of authentic Bengali dishes, we opted for the mahabhoj thali to pamper our taste buds. The elaborate fares of the thali were served in three parts. First came karaisutir kachuri, aloo dum,dhone patar chop, mochar chop and topse macher fry in a wooden tray. Then the mains were served in a clay dish.  We got the feel of our roots as we dug into the fares like sukto, chanar kofta curry, dhokar dalna, Mutton Curry and Hilsa in mustard sauce in typical bengali marination. Lastly for our sweet tooth there was Misti Doi, Baked Rosogolla and Malpoa.
