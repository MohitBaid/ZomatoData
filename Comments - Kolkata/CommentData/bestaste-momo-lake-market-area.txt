as per my opinion they serves far better momos than wow momo.. we ordered steam chicken and pan fried chicken momo.. taste was very good... and the price is cheap.. wow momo doesn't give the soup.. but they provide.. the staffs behaviour was quite humble.. ðŸ˜Š

I tried momos from here, cheese chicken steam and cheese chicken fried momos. The momos were not that incredible though chicken cheese friend had an essence of cheese, the chicken cheese steam momo was utterly blunt.
I expected a lot from your end.

After a shopping spree at lake mall ,we got really hungry and decided to try out momos from an outlet whose momo we haven't tasted till date. Since we have eaten momos from wow momo previously, this time we decided to try momos from this outlet located in the food court. We took a pan fried chicken momo in schezwan sauce. It was okayish. Neither too good nor too bad. The sauce wasn't very spicy as schezwan sauce is supposed to be but it tasted good.the only thing which I didn't like is that even though the momos were pan fried it somewhat became very soggy after just tossing in the sauce. So inspite of the momos being pan fried it felt like we were eating steamed momos tossed in sauce.
The prices are reasonable and is worthy of one try. ðŸ˜Š

Tried veg thupka which was a disaster, it tasted like noodles in hot water, tasteless and flat.
Then tried chicken cheese momo, quantity is 5 momos/ plate. Tasted just okay.You will have a hard time finding any cheese there. Almost all roadside momos taste better than this. The sauce provided was stale and the soup was like warm red colored water. Never trying this outlet again.Â 
The only positive is the staffs were well mannered.

On the day we went corn and cheese momo was not available so they provided the other variants. Apart from the paneer momo, I liked the rest of the variants. The service was quick and the behaviour of the staff were cordial.

First of all, I should mention that the prices mentioned here on zomato are incorrect. They are far lesser. So the menu needs to be updated. Coming to the food, we ordered corn cheese momo. It was only for 80bucks including VAT and other taxes which is pretty cheap. However the taste of the momos were not that great. The soup looked like spices mixed in hot water and did not seem fit for consumption. The momos had a good amount of corn but unfortunately very little amount of cheese. So, the corn was not softened and was a little crunchy.

Never really wanted to try out anything from the Lake Mall food court, as it never really appealed to me ever. However last Thursday, after watching a movie at Cinepolis, we were stranded due to the rain. 
Because we had to kill time, my friend suggested that we go and eat something from Yum street. 

I did not really want to eat anything so I decided to play it safe with a plate of momo. Bestaste momo was a cheaper choice so I ordered grub from there and I'm surprised.

I really did not have much expectations, but how they changed my views. 
First things first, this place is CHEAP! And is capable of satiating your momo cravings. 

We ordered -
â€¢ Chicken momo which was the usual. Quite good and had 6 pieces of chicken momo. Was served with soup as well. Value for money.
â€¢ Fish momo, which I did not really like. The size was smaller and it had 5 pieces. Priced at 90 per plate, I would suggest give it a miss.

â€¢ Now coming to the best deal of the afternoon. By just paying 50 bucks we got ourselves a Momo rice. It was basically veg fried rice with gravy and 2 pieces of fried chicken momo. I was so delighted with this one. Tasted really good, and was sumptuous enough. I don't think it's a regular thing, we got it because there was some offer going on. But it was really a good one.   
â€¢ Coke of course. Priced at 35 bucks.

Basically I'm quite satisfied with the food. And would recommend it to everyone who is running low on cash. Bestaste momo won't let you down. 

Pocket pinch - 290!

This place is located inside Lake Mall. The pun of their name doesn't go very well actually because the momos are very average. I had the Chicken Momo and Prawn Momos once from here and found them to be pretty average. Not at all recommended. I would prefer the roadside momo stalls to this thing anytime.

This outlet of 'Bestaste Momo' is located in the food court of Lake mall. I went there yesterday as an offer of 'Any momo @ 69 rupees' was going on on the occasion of their anniversary. It was my first visit here. I went for 'Pan fried chicken cheese momo'. The food took seven minutes to prepare. They did not serve the momos with any sauce which was a letdown. Coming to the food, the pan fried chicken cheese momo tasted delicious. My lady found it to be very  spicy. Up next we wanted to try out their momo rice but it was not available. All in all, a good store and I will visit again.

Suddenly Lake Mall is all filled with so many options at the food court. Last time i visited here there were very few options. Surprised to see Bestaste Momo kiosk at this place. Thou a smaller one to serve at the food court but yet not that behind. Tried the Veg Cheese Momo (Steam), From the coating it was soft and smelling good. The fillings were very decent with the veggies but missed out of the cheese flavour in it . Overall the taste was pretty soothing to the tongue and it was good to know that they have some class which can beat Wow Momo and Momore to some extent.

This outlet of the chain is located at Lake Mall. Didn't have time so packed veg cheese pan fried momos. A colleague got the pan fried chicken momo. My order was tasty. Especially liked the sauce enveloping the momos. It wasn't very spicy but packed the right amount of flavours. Though the dumpling layer couldn't be a little thinner, however it tasted good and wasn't chewy.
Definitely trying more stuff from here.

Just wow! I didn't have high expectations with respect to this joint based on previous zomato reviews, but ultimately I guess all it comes down to is ordering the correct dish. What to order? Hands down the pan fried cheese corn momo. It was a bit more spicy than what I would want, but that doesn't mean it's any less good. The pricing is fair, although I wished they gave 6 pieces instead of 5. Momo lovers shouldn't miss this place. If in doubt as to what to order in a combo, try the 3rd combo here(with burger momo).

In a city that promises and serves perhaps the best food in the country (momos included), it takes more than that to set up shop. I have only tried their steamed chicken momos, but they were bland and a little undercooked. Moreover, I don't know if this applies to all momo outlets, but I expect steamed momo to be accompanied by clear soup, which in this case didn't happen. I think this outlet needs to do a lot better to match the likes of the 'Wow Momo' franchise, amongst others.

Located in lake market. I have had their momos quite a number of times. Though they lack the variety offered by wow momo but still they're better in terms of taste and quality. Tried out their nonveg combo pan fried momos. We selected 2 prawm momos, 2 fish momos and 1 chicken cheese momo. All were delicious. However, I prefer steamed momos over pan fried ones. Hence not satisfied that much. Overall, quite good.

Good service but I cant fathom why they have a full blown shop. The momos are plain, flat and sometimes smells of uncooked dough. The pan-fried reeks of imbalanced spices. The latest addition a Momo wanton soup is just plain sad. Very very sad.

Located at the top floor food court of lake mall called as Yum Street, we college goers according to our pocket pinch chose this place. We had ordered Non veg Momo Wanton and Non veg Momo Fried rice. The momo wanton was a veggie soup having four steamed chicken momo in it. The rice tasted delicious despite being non spicy along with three fried chicken momos and a gravy in the platter. Both were being served hot and tasted heavenly . Apart from other common momo centres of the city this outlet's food was not at disappointing. Its pocket friendly too . Try it out :)

Their chicken cheese  steam momo is just amazing... That's a worth tryout item.
Other steam momos are also good.
But they over fry the pan fried momos...and schezwan sauce they use is too spicy.
As I have tasted better pan fried momos...so I didn't like it much.

I am a regular visitor of this place at lake mall. Momos are averagely good. They serve a fish momo which is to be praised for the taste and quality. The soup served with momo used to be good but they have stopped serving soups all of a sudden most probably for cost cuyting but this takes away half the flavour of momos. Thukpas are almost never available. The Pan fried momo needs hell lot of an improvement. Otherwise service is very quick. Not a bad place for having a small snack.

The newly opened food court at lake mall is booming with food stalls and outlets whose brands are quite unknown to us. It doesn't have the typical kfc, subway or pizza hut express brands but contains lesser known but decent quality food. Today when i went to this place , i had a taste from bestaste momo. 

Location -- at lake mall, 4th floor. The stall is really small and has only one staff. 

Ambience -- normal nothing specific.

Staffs -- the only one staff that was there was quite cordial. He even very sweetly said ," didi please zomato te review deben." ( didi please give review on zomato) . 

Food -- to be very frank, not as expected. The chicken cheese momos had literally no chicken. Denzong serves way better momos. The melted cheese which was supposed to be present was also lacking. Overall not an impressive momo at all. 

The thupka was not typical. More noodles than usual chinese thupka and the noodles was not upto the mark. The thupka tatsed more like manchurian gravy less thupka. Not really impressed.

Expectation was not fulfilled. Thats it.

It doesn't have the typical kfc, subway or pizza hut express brands but contains lesser known but decent quality food. Today when i went to this place , i had a taste from bestaste momo. 

Location -- at lake mall, 4th floor. The stall is really small and has only one staff. 

Ambience -- normal nothing specific.

Staffs -- the only one staff that was there was quite cordial. He even very sweetly said ," didi please zomato te review deben." ( didi please give review on zomato) . 

Food -- to be very frank, not as expected. The chicken cheese momos had literally no chicken. Denzong serves way better momos. The melted cheese which was supposed to be present was also lacking. Overall not an impressive momo at all. 

The thupka was not typical. More noodles than usual chinese thupka and the noodles was not upto the mark. The thupka tatsed more like manchurian gravy less thupka. Not really impressed.

Expectation was not fulfilled. Thats it.

Recently had momos at this outlet of Yum Street at the food court of Lake Mall. The momos were reasonably good and well steamed. It was served with thukpa thus increasing the taste. The sauce though was a let down somewhat
....was missing the taste of momo sauce.

It is located on the newly opened food court i.e. the yum street of the lake mall. I visited this place last Saturday with my wife. The yum street food court looks nice, with lots of space and good enough seating accommodation. We ordered a simple steamed chicken momo from here. They served immediately on a nice looking plate with 5 pieces of steamed momo with 2 different sauce and were kind enough to offer me a veg soup along with it. 
The momos were soft,  chicken filled yet something was amiss. The sauces were different; the red momo sauce tasted bitter n another sauce looked like the white chutney they provide with south Indian dishes, didn't taste good. The soup tasted nice, but a bit like sambar. Everything was there but it didn't gel together.
They have to work a lot on their flavour to catch up with their competitor the wow momo.

Visited this place today with friends. Ordered chicken pan fried momos. It was not as good as we expected. The taste was was not at all spicy! If schezwan is not spicy then it can't be called a schezwan momo!

Visited this Area- 14th July,2015 and decided to eat at the Food Court at Lake Mall.
The prices are cheaper than other momo shops ( momore, wow momo)
It was fairly Empty around 7.30 p.m. so we got a table. We ordered many things from different shop and an M.Burger(Rs 50) from this outlet. It was Fairly big and had 2 Fried Momos inside but doesn't have the Best-taste but is very good. The momos were stuffed and big enough and ues, it refreshed my love for momos frm these shops.WOW Momo serves better, but for Rs 15 Extra.
Its bigger than that of Wow Momo's one and was served in 5 mins. Very well behaved staff. And the Orange Sauce isn't good.
The concept of a momo burger isn't too good to be praised but the burger breads, again the momos have a covering.
But, overall it was a good and satisfying experience.

DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEWS, I WOULD POST HONEST AND REGULAR REVIEWS AND PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT INTENTIONALLY. AGAIN, DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES ( INCLUDING EXPERIENCES FROM BETTER RESTAURANTS) SO , DO READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS BEFORE COMING UP TO A CONCLUSION.

If you manage to get a table at the Lake Mall food court and are looking for a quick cheap bite, you can eat at Bestaste. I went with a friend and ordered their chicken fried momo, chicken thukpa and veg cheese momo. We wanted corn cheese momo and pan fried chicken momo, but they'd run out of the ingredients. In about 10 minutes our food was ready. The momos were delicious, the fried momo being very crispy and big, while the cute little veg cheese momos were too smooth to be true!! The soups accompanying the momos are a real disappointment. The chicken soup being simply tasteless stock and the veg soup too red to be tasty. The thukpa wasn't too good either. They should really go easy on the reddening ingredient!

I tried the Fried Chicken Momo. I simply loved it. The momos were adequately sized and had a nice crispiness on the outside. The inside was stuffed full of meat and really soft. The flavour of the momos was a little different from what I have tasted but I really liked the variation they served. I found the food to be quite affordable. The service was really good as we were served the food within 5 minutes. The chilli sauce they served was spicy and quite flavourful. I missed out on the soup as we visited right before 9pm and they were out of it. The staff was polite and I would like to visit again.

Ordered a plate of pan fried chicken cheese momo. The taste wasn't good enough and it was too spicy. The sauce wasn't up to the mark. I don't recommend others to order from here. Wow momo is the way to go.

Its just your average day to day momo you get in the streets. The chicken panfried momo is way tooo spicy for me but I tried it out inspite of the repeated warnings of the personnel there. The chicken fried momo was ok types . The steamed momo was also ok. Basically, they need to improve on quality and quantity of the chicken stuffing. The soup served with it is really bad!! Its filthy you better not have it. The momo sauce... Omg!!!! Please try serving a better sauce... That is an insult to the term sauce it has zero taste and only chilli hot!!!! 
This restaurant can grab a lot of crowd owing to its location but compared to the conpetition around they just might fade away!!

Been here for 2-3 times.The food here is really cheap and taste is really good. Especially the pan fried momos are a must. If you ever stop by the yum street...then bestaste momos are a must try
