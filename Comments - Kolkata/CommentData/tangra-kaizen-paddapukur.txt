My all time favorite when it comes to Chinese food. Their drumsticks are amazing ! Crispy on the outside n juicy on the inside. The mixed noodles n hong kong chicken were equally good. Also, it won't dig a very big hole in your pockets. Definitely recommended!

Went here last Friday for a quick drink. Located in sarat Bose this is one of the oldest bar in south kolkata. It has a no frill look but is air conditioned. Portion size is huge and the taste is good as well. We took one plate of crispy chicken. Best part is they give chanachur on the side. I wish all the pubs and lounges gave as well. Plus they gave ginger slice with black salt , lemon and chaat masala.

This is an ordinary bar Â cum restaurant with reasonable price. The lights are dimly lit and the food available is mainly chinese. The prices are though very reasonable.

Located near the landsdown chakraberia crossing beside Samilton. Visited this place couple of times with colleagues. the quality of food has detoriated from time to time. The entrance is a bit shabby , but we used to visit this place to taste the tangra style chinese food.

Came here long back when I was very young with my parents and their family friends. I don't remember clearly of what we had but I remember that the experience was very bad. The ambience is dark and shady inside. Service was really poor. They bad-mouthed my dad and got into a fuss. Don't know if the situation has changed over time but the Zomato rating doesn't reflect something like that.

Looking for a proper bar with reasonable price ? Tangra Kaizen is the place for you guys. It's nothing extraordinary. But just a hangout place with a couple of friends in a lazy afternoon. The food is okay. It was better few years back. Recently the place has lost its touch.

Nothing extraordinary, a normal bar cum restaurant or rather i would say an affordable bar in proper south calcutta. The location of this place is its biggest plus point situated in sarat bose road near paddapukur.Used to serve wonderful chinese 10 years back. My mother used to love their kaizen chicken. Now the quality has degraded awfully. Went there with a friend whose office is nearby. Tried their kaizen chicken and chilli chicken and both were disappointing. Price wise its an affordable place for drinks and food.

Food quality has deteriorated badly over the years. there was a time when this was my favourite restaurant and chinese was equal to TK for me. but now this place is just a waste of money and expectations.

Situated on sarat bose road, near pepper chino, tangra kaizen is supposed to be quite an old bar which served good food and alcohol at a moderate price. I use the term served because it doesnt do so, at least not last night. We, a team of four went there at around 10, to grab some beer and have dinner. The ambiance wont impress you, neither the staff. The service is unprofessional, food is average, there is not much variety in drinks, overall not a happening place at all. To end it up, we had to pay even before finishing our meal as the manager had to leave early, the clock however showed 10.45. Well, thoroughly unprofessional.
