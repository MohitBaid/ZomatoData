Wasn't at all impressed by the food served here. Although the staff at Sharma Sweets are great, when it came to food, it failed to impressed. The laddoo I ordered were hard to bite into, taste wasn't quite there. I wouldn't personally be visiting them again.

This outlet of Sharma Sweets is not good like their other counterparts. The samosas can be given a miss, but the kachori is decent. Kalakand can be tried.

This was the sweet joint which i have known for so many years. My dad use to buy so many food stuffs in forms of Sweets as well as their mouth watering Rabris. Got very dishearten after the closure of Girish Park branch. But surprisingly i found it again at the Shakespeare sarani near my office. On the crossing just behind The resto The next Level this place really revived some memories. They have got small Fast food and beside the sweet shop which has the ambiance of stand and eat beside.
After joining i went here the very next day and got to taste their varieties first up. Started with their fast food hub which was attached beside the sweet shop. Tried their Veg chow for a quick taste which really pissed me off. It was simply awful. Salt was missing in the first place as well the veggies were all filled up not even cooked properly.
After being disappointed from the fast food we turned to the sweet shop.
Tried their Hing kachori which they made before us and served very hot. Atleast the kachori didn't let us down. Followed by Their hot Gulab Jamun which was very fresh and can't question on their quality.Â 
Still lots of things yet to be tasted in near future.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Nice place to enjoy fresh fried hing ka kachori  or some deep fried delicacies.  Good place to hang out with friends. Sitting arrangements are not there so you gotta enjoy it standing.

Location: At the dogleg of Hungerford Street opening towards Shakespeare Sarani Road.

This outlet of Sharma Sweets was visited by my colleague and me after a meeting. 
The AMBIANCE was quite non-descript with wall-side tables inside and front-opening Savories/Sweet and Juice counters.
This outlet also had South-Indian fare along with the usual savories and sweets. Since we weren't quite in a mood to eat a heavy meal, ORDERED a Samosa and a Lassi each. My colleague ordered a Gulab Jamun as well.

- The Samosa visually didn't appeal me, but, was hot and had the crunch on the outside with a flavorful filling inside. Served with Sweet Tamarind Chutney (I declined for this chutney to be served to me as I do not like it) and Coriander Chilli Chutney.

- The Lassi was overflowing and dripped over the fingers! (Customers wouldn't mind if you pour a little less in the Bhaand, at least their hands wouldn't unnecessarily get dirty).
Served with a generous serving of Malai on top. Tasted good.

The staff was friendly but, served at a slow speed.
Prices were found to be pocket-friendly.

Overall an average experience.
- Service needs to be improved.
- Yet to try the South-Indian fare, comments due.
