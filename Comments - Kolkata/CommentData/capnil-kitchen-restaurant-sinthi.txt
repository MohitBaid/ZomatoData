This is a very popular restaurant in Sinthee area and is located opposite Sinthee fairground. Food quantity is enough for two people and is also very tasty. Service is very good and staffs are friendly. Well the space is little less but I thoroughly enjoyed the ambience here

They have an excellent cook who happens to cook really nice noodle in this part of the city. Located at the extreme North of Kolkata, just beside the Sinthee more bus stop, it's a cozy little restaurant serving some really nice and pocket-friendly food. All their prices are inclusive of taxes. 

P.S :- All their servings are sufficient for two people at least.

Went with my family .. was a favourite eating place for our family but consistency in quality is they should watch out .. a little cramped space but it's ok food is not so great prices are ok you can try ... Once their soups and noodles are good chilly fish dry is what I love the most but was disappointed last time as my favourite item turned out to be pathetic

This place will serve you good quality food with more than enough quantity without burning a hole in your pocketüòÑüòÑ.
Food ordered :- DRAGON CRISPY CHICKEN SHREDDED, MIXED FRIED RICE, CHICKEN MANCHURIAN, SCHEZWAN FISH....
Food quantity :- They will serve you enough  quantity that would defintly serve two people....
Food quality :- Dragon crispy chicken was bit hard it over fried so it could be more soft.... Mixed fried rice tasted awesomeüòÅüòÅ and prawns were well dressed üòÑ chicken manchurian loved it ‚úå‚úå chicken was soft...schezwan fish the perfect fish dish.....though i dont try fish outside but here i simply loved the quality of fish and the dish too
Its just a suggestion that they can improve their decor a bit which would improve their image
Overall a nice place to visit and enjoy food here.....üòÑüòÑ

Gravy chicken noodles was ... decent ! Tasty.. amount was also quite decent. You can say its 70% worth the money !! May not be too popular due its location. But with few improvements in the quality and taste it can be a huge success. But unfortunately not really satisfied with the chilly chicken.. 3 on 5 for the chilli chicken..

They jst not only serves the tasty biriyani but give an "Aaloo" a bigger piece of chicken or mutton.. En egg as well... ‚ù§‚ù§
That's the speciality of Capnil kitchen.. Nd their quantity is too good!! I may be Foodie. But I jst can't complete the biriyani alone... Nd yesterday I was jst panting while eating... 

Their service is good too though I ordered for a parcel.. I jst love this place.. ‚ù§

A small restaurant at sinthi more, and since it is very close to my house i have visited the restaurant a number of times. 
Firstly the ambience is not good and it feels quite cramped inside.But then again taken into the fact where it is located nothing more could have been done. The staffs are friendly and service is quite prompt except for festive times.
As for the food i have tried most of the dishes here , most of them are good but i would like to give a special mention to some of the dishes
Chicken drumstick- one of the best things to order for starter if you are here, The pieces are big ,tender and juicy , and the spicy taste gives it a boost.
Hong kong chicken- chicken strips batter fried and cooked in sauces which give it a sweet hot and acidic flavour. It tastes real good.
Singapore chicken- boneless chicken strips cooked with vegetables in a chinese sauce. The flavours are realy nice
As for the other maincourse dishes like chowmein and rice, they taste good and they give a huge quantity of food.
Overall its so-so restaurant to visit.

Dont go by its looks..rather focus on the food..
We ordered a chinese cuisine..comprising of chicken lollipop, mixed friedrice, chicken friedrice and hot garlic chicken.
Quantity wise it was good..a plate of lollipop comprised of 4 pieces and the taste was sweet and spicy..and the pieces were tender and soft
The rice was tasty and d side dish had 8 pieces of chicken..which was again enough for 4 of us
Moreover its a budget friendly restaurant

Well Capnil was my first love in childhood.But as I grew older their food taste felt very blunt to my taste buds.Be it their chinese or north indian dishes, nothing will soothe your taste buds as well as your pocket in comparison to the food they serve.I have tasted most of their items.But none is up to the mark except their momo and smooth coffee.But whatever they serve is fresh and huge by means of proportion.If u are not a big foodie you may like it.But to foodies like me its a very average place to dine in.

Recently they have started indian cuisine as well but dint got the chance to taste them. The Chinese dishes are delicious and would love to have them soon again.

Ordered lung fung soup which although great with its egg fluff was sour to taste. Prawn chicken gravy noodles and crispy fried chicken were our mains, although the quantity was a lot, taste was bla with no zing. 
Packed a pan fried noodles and that was good with chicken and exotic vegetable content. All in all ocassional emergency eating is good otherwise doesnot make any special mark to go back for specials.

We were skeptic about ordering from this place. Coming from the food paradise north/central kolkata we thought the food would'nt be that good. However Capnil blew our hearts away!! The food is excellent ! We ordered for shredded chicken and dry chilli chicken which was not only of a sumptuous quantity but of of the best dry chilli chicken! There kebabs and chicken bharta was equally at par with the delicious Chinese ! Right now we order atleast once a week and we are great converts in terms of fanfare of this Sinthi Restuarant !

Hugely cramped of space and capacity. The location is also not too attractive, (inside a old market in sinthi more). The interiors are clean and tidy and offers a homely ambience. The kitchen, which is visible from the take away counter is actually bigger the sitting space, and is very clean. It wins your heart straight away.
Coming to the most important part, the food. The food here is just right. Nothing extraordinary, but it just strikes the right chord with you. Since this place is close to my house, i used to be a regular at this place, and have more or less tasted every thing this place serves. The pan fried noodles, the julie fish, the steamed momos, are really good. They give a lot of importance to the quality of food they serve. Over the years, they have maintained the standards.
Special mention to the staffs here, who are well dressed and very polite.

Once upon a time, this was the best restaurant in the locality, but they have become over-confident now a days and started serving garbage. You can hardly find materials in the mixed noodles or rice. The chicken pieces of the chili chicken/garlic chicken etc are just flour balls with little chicken stuffed inside. I feel so bad for this, it was one of my favourite restaurants.

Ambience : 5/5
It is a well decorated Indo-Chinese restaurant.....with a calm and soothing atmosphere!!!

Staffs & Service : 3/5
Very few staffs attend the customers here.....there manager only sits in the desk, takes the order & delivers it himself, which is very unlikely to be seen!!! The order takes a long time to get deliverd on the table......waited for about 30mins for 2 # ButterNans & 1/2 plate #ChickenTikkaButterMasala to get delivered on the table!!! One thing good in here is that the prices are pocket friendly & the VAT is already included in the menu, so extra VAT is not taken here.....!!!

Food Quality : 4/5
The #ChickenTikkaButterMasala was perfect with loads of spices & a tangy taste, and the quantity was way more than enough for a single person to eat, consisting of 4 deliciously cooked boneless tikka kebabs in an awesome butter masala gravy (8pcs-full plate) !!! The #ButterNan was also good, but a lil bit stiff.....!!!

Opted to order food from here based on Zomato ratings , but was shocked to taste the food. Ordered two mixed noodles. The portion was huge, generous amount of egg, chicken and prawn, but alas the taste was way too blunt. Excessive amount of soya sauce put in, the prawns were over fried to brown and the dish had an undesirable burnt aroma. Disappointing, to say the least.

Visiting the Restaurant since I was a 5 year old.
The Chinese Dishes that they prepare with an Indian touch is awesome to say the least.

Must Have: Thai Soup, Chilli Chicken, Mixed Fried Rice.

A small restaurant hard to locate in sithi more,this place provides probably the best chinese food in baranagar.
I ordered hakka noodles,fried rice and garlic chicken for home delivery and I was not disappointed at the quality and quantity.
Prices are a bit on the higher side..
Overall a good experience.

Capnil Kitchen is a small restaurant located in Sinthir more inside the market. You will hardly find this restaurant empty at any time. That proves the popularity of this place.

Decorations : The restaurant was very small & there was two separated dining with small sittings that can have a number of people. It was very simply decorated with posters on wall & colourful glass chandeliers hanging from ceiling. There was 3 split AC in a dining that made it chilling. Quite simple & nice ambience to have dinner with family.

Staffs & Management : Quite a number of staffs were available to serve this small place. They were well dressed & mannered. But they took a long to serve order so be prepare for that.

Foods : There Chinese menu was bigger than Indian once & everyone present over there was having that too, So I went for simple Chinese.

Egg Fried Rice : The rice quality used were not much preferable for fried rice because of its small sized grains. It was very less spicy, less oily & absolutely light. Very less vegetables were their too but nicely diced. Normal fried egg was mixed in big pieces. However the quantity was very good. It tasted kind of sweet to me rather than spicy. Better to say it was kind of Vegetable Pulao rather than Chinese Fried Rice.

Hot Garlic Chicken : Hot garlic chicken was served in a bowl & the same thing copies here too, the huge quantity. The bowl was full of gravy that was tummy filling for 2 people with ease. The gravy was tasted kind of okey but not very hot or spicy. Chicken pieces were of medium sized but it was just fried chicken that was just dipped into the hot garlic gravy & weren't cooked enough. Therefore chicken pieces weren't very soft & the taste couldn't be felt from inside. However it wasn't cooked with perfection, I mean the the dish was full of ginger strings in it that didn't felt good.

Pricing : Our bill for both the items were Rs. 330 & it was more than enough tummy filling. Best part, they didn't add any kind of extra taxes with your bill. It was worth it, I would say.

Conclusion : I would say this place is for pure Bengalies. They don't serve authentic Chinese but they serve Chinese dishes in Bengali accent. And a huge portion in every dish just like Bengalies prefer.

After a long time had tandoori chicken, this small and cosy place makes good food at a pocket friendly rate. The chicken was tender and the service is good. It's overall a pretty decent place in the locality to have food.

The Capnil Kitchen is one of the most consistent quality restaurants I have ever come across. With rather basic Bengali Chinese cuisine one can expect the usual chilly, sweet and sour, Szechwan, etc. varieties and they will not be disappointed. Mostly popular among local people , it serves as a take away spot as well as a small eatery. In all a tasty respite for the tired home-chefs at a reasonable price.

Capnil Kitchen is a small eatery with separate dine-in and take-away counters located right at the Sinthi More inside the New market complex (adjacent to the circus ground). If you are approaching Sinthi from Shyambazar then you need to take left when you reach the Sinthi more, after couple of noticeable eateries like Pleasure, etc you will find Capnil of your left, but bit inside a small alley. Since we were in for a take-away order we were asked to wait at the sitting area in front of the take-away counter which is outside the dine-in area. The Dine-in area is not so big either; it is dimly lit and has about seven small tables. The ambiance is nothing remarkable and pretty humble to be honest. The servers are dressed in their white shirts with Capnil logo and black trousers and we found them to be quite prompt. For take-away orders, you need to place the order and pay in advance; there are several chairs place in a row where you can wait while your parcel is getting ready. 

The place serves Chinese as well as Mughlai dishes. We decided to go for some Chinese for our evening snacks and got Veg Hakka Noodles and Garlic Chicken packed. One plate of Veg Hakka Noodles is for two persons, but I felt the quantity can be increased a bit. The plate of Garlic Chicken had 8 pieces of chicken in it. The food was overall pretty mild which quite surprised me since I expected the dishes to be bit over-done like we find in close-to-road-side eateries. The flavours were very subtle and in the beginning you will feel as if it is devoid of salt or some ingredient, but then it suits your palate within couple of minutes. But I would suggest to make the flavors bit more intense like it should be, also the dishes should have some amazing aroma which I feel was missing. But surely this felt a lot healthier and less-oily than few of the neighboring joints. The garlic chicken had good amount of sliced veggies and the chicken pieces were well prepared, the flavour again was bit mild, it could have been more garlicky and can surely be increased to an optimum level.

I hope next time I can taste their biriyanis and rolls, but the locality and the road on which it is situated is extremely congested and chaotic. Also you won‚Äôt get any car parking there near the eatery which is again a negative. 

But the good point is the price which is in sync with the quality served and is very reasonable, plus they do not charge any additional tax, you pay what you see in the menu card; also they do not charge extra for packaging which is again appreciable. It‚Äôs a nice joint serving Chinese as well as Indian; and the food is overall pretty light. Wish them all the best and hopefully they will grow in the coming years.

Cheers!

Sinthi area doesn't have many restaurants.. Out of the few, Capnil Kitchen is the best of it's kind. We have been there twice or so. It's a small place with a very homely atmosphere. The price tags are pretty reasonable. Food quality is average and quantity is adequate. We had Gravy egg and chicken noodles with Schezwan Fish.. Noodles was nothing extra-ordinary but yet tasteful. Schezwan gravy wasn't as hot as conventional schezwan gravies are. And was pretty good in the mouth. 
Overall, a good place to grab quick bites like momo,kabiraji or fish fingers and also on the other hand you can have a full course lunch or dinner, that also at reasonable and pocket happy price..

Capnil is one of the oldest restaurants in the Sinthi area if not the oldest. Rumour has it that the place started without any capital and hence the name Capnil; I can't confirm how true that is though. You can see the signboard but it's tiny entrance is difficult to locate. The interiors are, however, neat & clean. They still have a loyal clientele & the food is decent enough to deserve it. From a personal point of view, I'd my first taste of 'Chinese' food from here.

Food is great and is definitely ''value for money''. ¬†
My frequent order from this restaurant is Fried rice, veg Manchurian and preparations of tiger prawn. When my mother decides to bunk from her cooking time for a day or two, ¬†Capnil is our rescuer.

Location and Description: Right at the sinthee more. Inside the bazaar. Difficult to find. But this place hai lots to offer you according to your foody need.

Ambience and Staff: Its a very small restaurant with few tables. A.c with decoration.. Place is neat and clean.

Food: The food is average. They serve Chinese dishes with all the variety. Didn't have chance to eat much but the chilly chicken is my favorite here. The chicken was fresh. Marinated well and soft. The gravy was thick with the sour and salty taste complete the chilli flavor.¬†

QNQ & Prices: The quality of the food is very good. but while packing in the container they really make a mess. Prices are according to what you orders thou is average.

Conclusion: Food is quite tasty here with good affordable rates. The take away counter is outside the restaurant.. Till now satisfied.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Nice place in Sinthee and Baranagar area, friendly staff, they have been well acquainted to me thanks to my frwquent visits there. The chinese food is very good - specially crispy chicken, julien chicken and schzechuan chicken - indian dishes are not that bad either.¬†

The restaurant is pocket friendly as well and provides a lot of quantity; my gf and I frequently dine there and truly speaking one started, one main course and one side dish is a lot more than we can consume. So everytime we end up packing the rest and bring it back. The restaurant serves good quality soups as well - a nice rendezvous with coffee and chicken lollypops.¬†

The only takeback is that sometimes it takes a little bit long when the restaurant is full. They also server the home deliveries and takeaways - and the small kitchen is not always enough to serve the numerous requests.

Be there, try it for yourself and you will definitely love it.

The best restaurant in Sinthi More area. Its almost a regular saturday dinner destination for me and my family if we are too tired to go those extra kilometers for the well-being of our taste buds.

Primarily it is known for it's chinese food though now a days they have started serving some indian dishes as well. The restaurant is a small one with minimum decor. So one should not posses a high expectation related to its ambience.  

The service is up to expectation and one would be pleased with the taste of its food.

Recommended : Pan Fried Noodles, Hong Kong Chicken.

This eatery is very near to my home and after they revamped the interior decor and remodelled the kitchen it has become the go-to restaurant for us when we can't travel to far off food joints. The best thing about the food is that it is always fresh and most of the dishes are yum!

A week ago I visited this restaurant for a dinner treat and we ordered the chicken lollipops which had ample amount of meat and a good crunch. We ordered chicken fried rice and one plate was sufficient for the two of us. We decided to try the prawn munchurian which was delicious along with the chilly chicken which my friend likes a lot from this eatery. Their chilly chikcen has nice kick of soya sauce  and whole chillies but I have tasted better ones at other places. The prawns were succlucent and very fesh. So thumbs up for doing a good enough job near at home.

** Location = Opposite Sinthee Circus Maidan. Just beside the Sinthee New Market.¬†

**Brief = This place used to be a regular hunting ground for chinese lovers. I had been there since my school times.
But as the new restaurants developed they could not compete them in such a way and no longer has that craze.

**Ambiance = Its Air conditioned so thats a good point. But the entrance is bit dim. You have to go through the Market, but since the food was great it was not an issue.Quantity of the food served is also pretty good :)

**Recommended = Chinese is what they serve.
They mixed hakka chow is good along with chicken manchurian. Its the place where I had the best Sweet and Sour Chicken. But the quality has deteriorated a way lot in the past few years.

**Purse Check = Not that costly, but who minds the cost if the food is great, which in this case is not that much great !!

**Overall = I hope the management takes some steps and makes this place a great restaurant of this region. It indeed has huge potential.

Cheers :)

Tremendous cost efective. Good place for an evening adda with a plate crispy chicken and coffie. Amount served is more than sufficient.

Been visiting this restaurant for 20yrs now the quality of Chinese food is still great compared to other restaurants in the area. The gravy noodles here is amongst the best prepared in north kolkata.They prepare Indian dishes as well the quality of which is standard. But avoid this place during the puja season and end of year festivities as the quality drops drastically during the rush hours.

one of the best Chinese restaurant in north kolkata...now they have to compete against chowman opened near seals garden ,,,,but if they keep the quality quantity as good as always then there's nothing to worry

Capnil....was one of my favorite restaurant at Sinthee for its soups....but, thanks to the 'austerity' measures of the owners.....this is just a living fossil right now. Dingy place, obnoxious quality of food. It is better to offer the money to greater causes than spending and wasting it in there. Just, don't visit.
