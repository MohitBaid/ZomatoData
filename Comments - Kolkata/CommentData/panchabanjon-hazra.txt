If there is a option of rating 0 then i will do that. We asked for soup, they said 'nei', asked for Chinese ¬†starters, again 'nei', then go for tandoor starters, 'nei'.. now finally we skip to bengali food and hoping for vetki butter fry, obviously ¬†'hbe nah'. we walked out.

Panchabanjon is a restaurant located near Hazra Crossing. It mainly serves authentic Bengali dishes along with Chinese cuisines parallely.

Ambience & decor is simple with ample sitting arrangements.

Staffs are well behaved and service is prompt.

Tried Koraisutir Kochuri , alurdom & Chicken steam momo. 
Kochuri was very nice with good stuffings, alurdom was tasty, flavourful  and well cooked. Momo was nice too with generous stuffings.

Pocket pinch is economical too.

A very nice place to dine in.

This food joint serves authentic Bengali cuisine and some Chinese dishes. The Bengali dishes are better than the Chinese items. ¬†The bengali combo offer with Pulao, bhetki vapa, chicken kasa and cold drink is good option at a reasonable price.¬†
The bengali ala carta dishes are also good in taste and the prices are economical. The decor is ordinary and can be improved.

The place is simple but food is extraordinary. I went in with my friends to check out this place and was not disappointed. We had ordered bengali and chinese cuisine parallelly. The mixed fried rice is best of the lot. The Vetki Bhapa was equally delicious. Home delivery is also available. I often order food and it takes at the most 15 minutes to get delivered to my place. Thanks to Zomato for showing this restaurant.

Thanks to zomato for showing this restaurant from the search results for near by restaurants. I was standing at rashbehari avenue, hungry, eagerly looking for a new place to explore. It was my quick choice and fortunately the food was good.
Just behind the hazra park, after exceeding through some narrow stairs, you finally reach this tiny and cute restaurant. The ambiance is average and as we were hungry, we ordered food and bingo !! They served within 10 minutes ! Plain rice with daal and alu bhaja followed by mutton and parshe maach. The fish item was very good and I recommend that. The funny part was they served the daal in a bucket which was quite a large one ! This place will go great if you come with your family. I will come here very soon to have their other dishes. A good restaurant indeed :)
