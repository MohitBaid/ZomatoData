Have been there during the pujas this year. This is on the Southern Avenue easy to loacte just a lane before Marco Polo. The decor is purely bengali but fairly mediocre. This resturant had very limited menu during the pujas. We had basanti polau which was drenched in the smell of mitha atar which in excessive made it a bit difficult to tolerate. We had parshey r jhaal. The size was large though. Quantity is not that great but okay. Also, chicken curry and mutton curry which tasted good but more or less the same. They need to work hard. And also the quality they serve is not as high as the rate they charge. So that is just a 3 star for now. Maximum one visit recomended.

Inspite of some popular names in the Bengali cuisine circuit, Sare chuattar is quite good. We visited this place with friends during the Pujo, and didn't have to wait at all to get a place. Ambience is pleasantly simple, but the real positive is its food. We had ordered Basanti Pulao, Daab Chingri, Mutton Curry, Vetki paturi ,dhokar dalna and chutney. The pulao wasn't oily at all and had the typical smell of a pulao, very well cooked, all the other items were very authentic in their flavours, the dhoka could have been better, with a bit less use of garlic perhaps. However the overall experience was pretty good, and we ended up going there 3 to 4 times on the trot. Would certainly recommend it if you are looking for a good fat Bengali meal that has value for money tag.

We visited there on 27th September and ordered rice, polao, bhetki paturi, ilish bhapa, chicken, pineapple chutney, rosogolla and they were too tasty. During puja time generally it is seen that the food quality drops. But here I was wrong. They were very very tasty.

Hi,

3rd September 2017, i visited Sare chuattor at around 2.45pm  along with 8 of my friends and ordered rice,dal,alu vujia and some fish items and mutton kasha. The mutton kasha was supposed to contain 4 pieces where we were surprised to find 2 chicken pieces and 2 mutton pieces. After asking the attendant he asked us to put the pieces into the dish on which it was served (probably it was served in the next table where someone ordered chicken kasha).It didnt ended here, the attendant replaced the dish with another bowl mixed with mutton and chicken pieces  :o . Being astonished to the fact it was again replaced with curry and mutton bones (I doubt it was mutton this time). I have been into so many Bengali restaurants  and even sare chuattor before but this was an extreme case of mismanagement!!!! Sorry it cannot be mismanagement , it must b something known as CHEAT.

Visited this place last to last Sunday. After watching the movie "Macher jhol" we were craving for Macher jhol. Hence we went to Sara Chuattar to have some Bengali cuisine.
So we ordered Rice, Chital Macher kaliya, Katla Macher jhol, Chingri mach, Pataler dorma, Muri ghonto (which tasted best) and Mochar ghonto.
Their is nothing to mention about their ambience  (Bellow average)
But if someone wants to have some delicious Bengali cuisine, they should visit this place once.

Sare Chuattor is the go to place for aunthentic Bengali Cuisine lovers. Location is easy to find. The ambience is nothing fancy. A rather homely decor. But the USP of the place is its prompt service. 
Now coming to the food we ordered Sada Bhaat, Pulao, Lau Chingri, Koochu Shaak batta with Elish Macher Matha, Potol er Dolma, Gondhoraj Bhetki and Dakbunglow Chicken, nolen gurer ice cream and yes we also ordered Aam Porar Sharbat.
I loved it all, specially the Bhetki. The quality was superior than any other Bengali resturant. Loved  the entire experience. Pocket Pinch: afordable.

It wasn't a good experience since many reviews from past visitors were good, but my experience wasn't.

It was 1.30pm, 1st May, 2017, no crowd, may be 2 more tables filled.

Ambience: 7/10
Service 8/10

Orders for 4:
4 Fish fries(Vetki Fry)
3 Vetki Biryani
1 Chitol mach er Muitha
1 Plain Rice 1 Moong dal
1 Chana kofta curry
1 plt malpoa

Vetki Fry(6/10): Rs 120 for this size and you get a salty one! Fish was fresh but the excess salt was the problem. 4 pieces 4 were differently sized!

Vekti Biryani(6/10): With reviews from relatives, I tried this but it wasn't up to the point. The fish had a smell, it was dry(frozen stuffs) and the fried pieces of Vetki had a tough coating, so it might not have been freshly made(not hot either). The aroma was that of advertised biryani or polao masala.

Chitol Mach er Muitha(7/10): Decent one. Expected a bit more fish, but it has a mixture, it's not purely fish. You might think it's Dhoka.

Plain Rice: Nothing to specify here. Well cooked rice.

Moong Dal(4/10): This was bland! It was extremely dilute, it tasted like water had been poured to increase quantity.

Chana Kofta Curry(7.5/10): This was nice. Good pieces and on the sweeter side. Goes good with plain rice.

Malpoa(10/10): This is Brilliant! Served hot and delicious! A Plate has 2 pieces, so it can be shared, unless you have a sweet tooth. A must try!

Good restaurant for Bengali cuisine. Not much large, neither much crowded as well. Easy to locate. Decoration and ambience is quite OK and friendly stuffs are there. Now coming to the food, which is the best thing here. Tasted aam pana, rice, mocha, aloo posto,  chitol machher muitha, tel koi and parshe kalojeere. They couldn't provide amudi machher chhocchori though.  All preparations were really tasty, not too spicy, perfect for Bengali taste buds. The total bill for four people was Rs 2033 including taxes which is quite fine considering their food quality. If someone wants to taste Bengali cuisine in Kolkata, can visit this place for authentic and tasty food.

The place is another hidden treasures and will fulfill the appetite of each and every bangali.For non bongs if you want to taste amazing pocket friendly bengali dishes, this place is just for you!
We ordered dab chingri kosha mangsho and bhaat..
Nothing to say about the food,its absolutely delicious, quality and quantity was excellent.Food was fresh.Prawns were soft and chicken was perfectly marinated and with every bite cravings will only increase.
For me the place deserves a big thumbs up!

Amidst the pocket pinching 3-4 star bengali cuisine restaurants in Kolkata this is a gem. A meal for 3 consisting of 2 plates of plain rice, 1 plate of basmati pulao, machher matha diye daal, jhuri aloo bhaja, chitol muitha , potoler dolma, daab chingri and pineapple chatni costed me 1550/- only.

I had tried this joint some 3 years ago and never felt disappointed. Chitol muitha gravy was a bit spicy and the muithas were stuffed with an overdose of garlic. I personally feel that a non veg dolma tastes the best with prawn stuffing but they serve it with betki stuffing. Daal and the pineapple chatni were perfect and the daab chingri was cooked with utmost love and so was the mutton kasha I tasted 3 years back.

This restaurant is located at Sarat Bose Road (near the post office) on Southern Avenue. If you are coming from Lords More, you would take the flyover and then go straight to get this on your left.The restaurant is located just beside a petrol pump and you have to park your car on the road in front of the restaurant. The restaurant is named after a popular bengali movie from sixties and serves traditional bengali food.

We reached there sometime at around 8:30pm. On entering the restaurant, one thing immediately struck me. My expectation was that since the restaurant is named in line with the bengali movie, it's decor would incorporate some scenes or posters from the movie itself. Surprisingly, the internal decor did not have any reference to the movie and was done using items like hand-fans (talpata r pakha) and wooden utensils to give the bengali touch. On asking, the waiters told us that initially for few years, the theme was in place but then it was redecorated. The place is clean and decor is nicely done.

We were the only ones at 8:30pm (happy that it was not crowded). There were seven of us, my family and my in-laws. As we settled down, the waiter came forward for the order. Since it was the first time at the restaurant, we asked the waiter to suggest what would be best and what he thought was their speciality which we should try.

Begining with starters, the option was Fish Fry. There was no other option at starters, no chicken, nothing else!! So we had to go forward with it. The management should definitely work on this.

Sifting through the menu, we could find items which are general bengali dishes. There was nothing which was exception, unique or interesting. Fair enough. We decided to go by the suggestions of the staff. Here is what we ordered:

(1) Vetki Fry - Rs 120

(2) Aloo Jhuri Bhaja - Rs 50

(3) Plain Rice

(4) Basanti Polao

(5) Chanar kofta curry - Rs 110

(6) Dhokar Dalna - Rs 100

(7) Chitol Macher Muitha

(8) Lau pata mora chingri maach

(9) Mangsher Kasha (Kasha Patha r Mangsho)

 

To begin with fish fry was tasty and well done and so was jhuri aloo bhaja. Basanti polao was something which they definitely need to rework upon. The rice was not done perfectly and the distinct colour of the basanti polao was missing (more on the faded side). Chanar kofta was sweet and good and dhokar dalna was ok(the salt was tad more). Laupata mora chingri maach had chingri (prawn) wrapped in lau pata and gravy done with curd. It had a typical flavour of plain yogurt and the taste was good.

Chitol macher muitha and Kasha Patha r mangsho were too spicy. The chitor fish tablet kind of muithas were soft (I have had it a many places where it is not soft) and pieces of mutton were average.

Overall, considering the taste, the experience was average. They should not only improve upon their cooking taste and quality but also need to prep up the menu to include more options. Also, availability needs to be improved. We wanted Pati Shapta and it was not available.

The waiters were courteous and attentive, but then they would need to be much more professional in manner of serving. For sare chuattar to be really popular and crowd-pulling in competition to other restaurants serving bengali food, they definitely need to improve at few of their areas to become value for money.

A must visit whenever my parents are in town. Serves only Bengali food and if you're living away from home, this is where you should go to fulfill your maach-bhaat cravings without burning a hole in the pocket. 

I have almost tried everything in their menu. My favourites being the parantha, khosha mangsho, bhetki fry and paturi, alu poshto, chanar dalna and topshe fry. The vetki biriyani is okay-ish but worth a try too!

My review is coming pretty late, because I had dined here about 2 weeks back. But my oh my! This is a gem of a place! The decor is simplistic and authentic, and the bangali food is amazing. Minus points for the items being a bit too spicy. Now coming to the food, we had gone bonkers and ordered almost everything - Basmati pulao, alu dum, dhokar dalna, dim posto, chitol machher muitha and Chittagong chicken. Each and every item was cooked delectably and I still can't forget the taste of the last two items. Yes, they were that good. And the quantity is overwhelming too. The best part about dining here? The pocket pinch! All of this came down to a meagre 960 bucks. Unbelievable! Coming back again to taste the perfectly cooked bangali khana!

You r not a Bengali if you don't eat বাঙালি খাবার at new year day. So my new year  started with one of the best Bengali food joint সাড়ে ৭৪, nearby Rabindra sarobar lake. Awesome Bengali food....fishes were fresh, mutton kasha was very good cooked n I rate d ambience 10 on 10. perfect Bengali home decoration. Only 1 complain,if u can reduce spice slightly from veg items. Its not at all deserving to taste spicy in chanar dalna....a sweet bengali veg item. We took plain rice, alu vaja,moong dal with fish head,chanar dalna,sukto,murighonto,vetki paturi,bagda chingri malaikari,mutton kasha n chatni. After a long days I ve got super satisfaction taking Bengali lunch here. rating 8 on 10. I cut 2 marks for their extra spice. Try it out,its awesome.

As bengali households in this generation forgets or forgoes the art and exercise of traditional cooking and untraditional cooking there has been a boom of Bengali eateries which have come up all over the city.

Sare Chuattar is the name of a super hit movie of the sixties but these guys have wasted the opportunity of carrying the theme of the name farther in decor and ambience.

This place has two levels and since I was attending a party could travel across the restaurant.It is clean cut and no nonsense.

A statutory declaration is that I know the owner personally for a very long time but this was the first time I visited this place.

Killer Kosha mangsho ( mutton ).......red,hot and chunky as it should be.........4/5

Kolkata bhetki fish fry.......3.5/5

The vegetarian stuff.........3/5

Chutney.........5/5

Service was good and the location is a winner.

Like the movie the place turns out to be a hit as well.

We took plain rice, alu vaja,moong dal with fish head,chanar dalna,sukto,murighonto,vetki paturi,bagda chingri malaikari,mutton kasha n chatni. After a long days I ve got super satisfaction taking Bengali lunch here. rating 8 on 10. I cut 2 marks for their extra spice. Try it out,its awesome.

As bengali households in this generation forgets or forgoes the art and exercise of traditional cooking and untraditional cooking there has been a boom of Bengali eateries which have come up all over the city.

Sare Chuattar is the name of a super hit movie of the sixties but these guys have wasted the opportunity of carrying the theme of the name farther in decor and ambience.

This place has two levels and since I was attending a party could travel across the restaurant.It is clean cut and no nonsense.

A statutory declaration is that I know the owner personally for a very long time but this was the first time I visited this place.

Killer Kosha mangsho ( mutton ).......red,hot and chunky as it should be.........4/5

Kolkata bhetki fish fry.......3.5/5

The vegetarian stuff.........3/5

Chutney.........5/5

Service was good and the location is a winner.

Like the movie the place turns out to be a hit as well.

I DID ORDER FRIED PRAWN TODAY FOR TAKE AWAY WE CALL IT CHINGRI MAACH BHAJA IN BENGALI ..
REPEATED THE ORDER TO THE PERSON TAKING THE ORDER 3 TIMES FOR CLEAR UNDERSTAING OF FRIED PRAWNS..
WHAT I GOT WHEN I OPENDED THE BOX BACK HOME WAS A FORM OF DRY CHILI CHICKEN WHERE CHICKEN IS REPLACED WITH PRAWNS..
SAD !! POOR UNDERSTANDING SKILLS OF THE MANAGER OR LACK OF SENSE OF BENGALI PREPARATIONS..
MOOD SPOILT OF HAVING FRIED PRAWNS.

One of those many Bong themed restaurants that have mushroomed across Kolkata, Sare Chuattar, is located on southern avenue, very close to Deshapriya Park. We tasted sukto & pabda fish curry with rice. The sukto had the usual home cooked touch while the large pabda was fresh and yummy. In all, a very satisfying experience. Recommended for Bong food lovers.

Its an awwsommee bengali cuisine restro..they serves some old bengali foods like "Chital Macher Muitha" etc., which are not possble for everyone to prepare in home, prices of foods are quite high, costs for two, around 800/- min. The name of this restro is also very popular because of a old bengali comedy movie starred Uttam Kumar, Bhanu Bandyapaddhay...

First the caveat: this review cannot be treated as complete,  till the time I eat here during non-puja period. Now to my review... we went to Sare Chuattar for Puja special meal. It started on a positive note as the restaurant gave us a table the moment we stepped in. Most of the Bengali cuisine places were full and had long queues. They had a limited menu for Durga Puja,  but it covered the spectrum well.  The food came fast and everything that we ordered was good. So,  overall it turned out to be a nice experience.

Very bad experience.  I ordered Begun bhaja, Posto diye aloobhaja,  Dim Posto,  And Murighonto and Gondhoraj Bhetki along with Aam Pora Sorbot. The quality of the food is not upto the mark. The Bhetki Mach is stiff and spices given were not at all well prepared.  Further to my dismay the Murighonto was having some serious problem and is having pungent smell. They have even deducted the price of Murighonto from my bill though they disagree the fact that it's punjent. I will surely not recommend anyone. Sheer waste of money.

I would have given a much higher rating but for one drawback- they ran out of Elish dishes (all of them)! The food was finger licking to say the least. I was just too happy to find a healthy number of proper egg dishes on the menu. From the usual to the lesser found matha diye kochu shaak, elish biryani, omelet chochhori ;the menu had a lot of variety. The service was very quick too. The staff however could work a bit more on their way of dealing with customers. Location wise (just near the sarat bose post office,adjacent to the petrol pump) it's convenient. This place is a must try for lovers of bengali cuisine. Just make sure to call in to check the availability options of the food items. We were the sole eaters on a Friday night!

An awesome bengali restaurant located on the sarat bose road. The place gave my taste buds a real pleasure. We had basanti pullao,sorshe chingri,murgi korma. The dishes were so tasteful that i end up having the last bit of gravy from the utensils!! I am not at all a big fan of bengali cuisine but after visiting the place I really felt proud of the taste, flavours and the authenticity of the Bengali food. The staffs were well behaved!! Though the place is not very spacious but I definitely recommend this to all the Bongs to visit once. This place offers a real pleasure to ur appetite. I m definitely looking forward to my next visit.

The most awful food ever!!  The moong dal was a bowl of yellow water, the jhuri aloo bhaaja seemed it was out of a packet.  We ordered mourola chorchori and that came with a thick tomato, onion gravy, but it wasnt too bad to taste atleast.  In fact that was the only good thing apart from the white rice !!! The muitha was a sickening onion paste !! The doi pona was so sweet that even a spoonful of salt couldnt take the taste out of my mouth, to top it, doi pona cooked in thick posto, cashew paste, eww !! Oh and may I also add here, the serving bowls and dinner plates have seen better days.  The lipstick marks on the glasses were a right turn off .. My parents 48th anniversary was the occasion and it was a nightmare to say the least !!

I had never thought of going for a bengali restaurant ever, for I can have it all at home. But it seems God had some other plans. It was ashtami this year at around 12 pm. We were desperately looking for a place to eat. All our preferred places were either jam packed or closed, when we discovered this small little restaurant - Open!
Initially my friends & myself had our reservations as we had never heard of this eatery but we eventually gave in to our hunger pangs!
They had a special menu for puja with fewer dishes & we ordered almost everything on it. Aam porar shorbot, Basanti Polau, masala moong dal, mutton kosha, chingri malaikari, dab chingri, ilish jhal, Bhetki paturi & mishti Doi. All the dishes were so amazing that we ended up ordering 2-3 plates of each. Special mention for the Bekti Pathuri & Ilish Jhal. Great flavor & taste, cooked to perfection & the most important aspect of any fish dish- fresh fish, these two dishes were divine. Even during puja the quality they maintained is commendable.
The staff were courteous & service was very fast. Reasonably priced, this place is a must visit for all!

The disappointment level is absolutely ZERO... good and quick service.. Perfect quantity of spices in the food items. The bhapa ilish and basanti polao are really something you should try. Thumbs up to this bengali cuisine specialist. 

P.S: - Prices are quite low...so you visit without any worries (to all the students spending puja with just their pocket money)

I came across this place with recommendation from a friend. At first look, I was bit dejected by its only picture (as on date) posted on this website; which very much questions your conscience before stepping-in. Oh boy ! I was wrong. This one is better (only in terms of size and space) than its counterparts in the city. Well, it’s a warning for those, who look ahead to a free car parking anywhere near this place. Forget it !

The place looks okay with decent ambiance. The service is sluggish and the staff needs to be more courteous and professional. The pricing of items might look easy on pocket, but they are not. Wait for the additional taxes to be added to your bill, that will surely bug you.

We found the food to be so-so as compared to other Bengali restaurants in South Kolkata; which cannot be termed as value-for-money. Bhetki Paturi & Murgi Korma were okay but not that great. Other items we had, Karaisutir Pulao & Lau-Chingri were pretty mediocre and lacked both – taste & quality. Murgi Do-Piaza smelled fishy (read, stale) and was simply awful !

Overall, it was not a satisfying experience. (yawn)

it was a rainy eve of one of the pre puja days, we busy munching on our honeybony at go lebanese, my bf pointed at the advertisement boards all over near that crossing of sarat bose road. "just lebanese- air conditioned, shwarma @85/- , pasta ,pizza available " . Similar hoardings were put up for sare chuattor for bong cuisine - we were'nt interested.
finishing our plate, we decided to spend the left overs of our limited budget to explore the new place.

It was bang opposite, on the other side of the road. sare chuattor, an existing bengali restaurant has recently added a lebanese cum italian menu-  the menu card named JUST LEBANESE. 
the interiors were quite soothing with glass tables and maroon velvety cushioned chairs, lights, photographs and show pieces added on decor part.A round flight of stairs will take you to their banquet hall.AC was chilling, as the entire place was empty except for 2 staff members. prices are very  reasonable, and we were even delighted to find them including taxes, food in ac,that too in a well-decored place charging this much will never pinch your pocket.

we ordered a non veg pizza ( chicken spicy golden delight priced at 160/- ) and shwarma wrap (85 /-).the stewards were attentive but the Serving time was quite long, considering the fact that we were the only customers. the pizza had a  thick crust base,with toppings of chickens,onions,capsicum,sweetcorn and cheese. Tasted spicy enough to enjoy ( i hate bland stuffs ) . but the deducting part was shwarma-  if you have no idea about lebanese food, and just take it as a wrap,its edible. but comparing it with that of the existing leban joints in the city,for example , the one on the opposite footpath, it was not even satisfactory. some red sauce ,big slices of cucumber,lack of proper mayo dressing were the culprits. the chef simply has no idea to make lebanese food.
Anyway,the other aspects of the restaurant is pretty nice,to give a 3.5 for a intial boost up, hoping that they improve on their serving time and the shwarma.

It is a small Bengali restaurant with good ambience.Been there with my fiance.Was looking for some delicious bengali food.Ordered a Dab chingri and chicken kosha with plain rice.And it was quite nice.Forgot to tell that u can also order lebanese dish if u want.They also server that.I had one lebanese dish but forgot the name,it was very nice also.Price is totally affordable.
Would recommend to everyone :)

A pocket friendly Bengali restaurant, ambiance is not so great as compared to other Bengali restaurant , but if you want some good Bengali food in reasonable price , this is the place to visit . Now come to the food , In veg items dal, shukto, dhokar dalan was good , but panir kofta was too sweet . In fish we have tried elish(hilsha) , chitol mach and pabda .. all was good but dub chingri was a mess ... its taste like some coconut sweets with prawns .

Overall ,if you have some money crunch , and want to enjoy Bengali food , this is a good place to visit , just avoid dub chingri :P

This quaint little place serves you good homely bengali food without charging you exorbitantly for it. Really have nothing to complaint about the quality of food here. Had a good dining experience here.

Sare 74 is good restaurant which serves delicious bengali dishes.
The Lau Chingri was not that good....quantity is enough for 2 people and prices are quite affordable.
The Chicken Jhol was good too. Prawn Malai Curry was yummy...
Staff is well-behaved and mbience is ordinary. Moong dal was good too. 
3.5 from my side..
I would not include this one within the top 10 bengali restaurants..

I had gone their with my better half in search of a place that served Bengali delicasies within a manageable pocket crunch. Most restaurants in the city which serve authentic bengali cuisine are costly to say the least. But this place beats that with the amazing menu and average prices. The ambience is just right with no extra frills and the staff are well mannered and quick. The items are a pleasure both in their names as well as their taste. :) Try the Bhetki begum bahar. There aren't too many seats which may be a damper as you'd have to wait for quite a bit for your turn. 
Whenever we bengalis try our own cuisine outside our homes, obviously we tend to compare it.. It was inevitable that i did that here too, and i'm gonna have to go the extreme of saying that they give my Ma a run for her money ( Disclaimer : My ma is a very good cook :) )
 I liked the place so much that i was the one who created a facebook page for it..

Chakraborty tip : The upstairs is a banquet but the approach is through the middle of the restaurant..so dont go on asking, " Oporey jayga achey ?" :D

This small little Bengali restaurant is actually serves very good food, went there twice so had tried many items. Veg items like Shukto, Dhokar Dalna were excellent. Non veg items like Vetki Begum Bahar, Mutton Kassa, Omelette Chocchori were very good as well. The Pulao is not that good though!! 
Ambiance is ordinary but they serve very good food at very cheap rate.. worth visiting..
