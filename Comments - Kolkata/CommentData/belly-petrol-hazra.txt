A new venture launched at the mouth of the Sarat Bose Road and Hazra Road crossing, this veg take away outlet is offering something old and comfortable, made with the same feeling that only home cooked food has. 

Recommended to me by a friend, I took a test order of Tandoori Roti and Harre Masaaley ka Bhuna paneer. The paneer was succulent and tender, with the preparation lacking the unhealthy oily after taste that is so common in many shops. It was tasty and felt healthy and light, a perfect dinner, with the Tandoori Roti hitting the right spots.

The owner is extremely friendly and obliging, and the entire experience was one I am willing to repeat several times in the future.
