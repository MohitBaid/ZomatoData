Every Ju student knows how much awasm this place is. Chef is just our life saver in the college days..when we wanted to grab some Vaat daal & macher jhol instead of Maggie or sandwiches. Its a must visit place in jadavpur 8b area serves purely bengali cuisine with a pocket friendly budget. Getting vetki paturi in just 90bucks...is a dream!! I put a big thumbs up for this place.

Didn't get what I order. I ordered Fulkopi Roast, but instead of that I get Matar- Fulkopi. Also in stead of Aloo Patal Darma, they ask me to order something else, as this was not available. So I ordered Aloo Posto, but they take 10 rs extra for that. But I saw that price of Aloo Posto and Aloo Patal Darma both were same. And after giving rs 10, when I take the parcel and open it, I got a smelly Aloo Posto and not so much tasteful. I will recommend never to order from this restaurant- 'The Chef'.

Located at the 8b Bus stand itself, food is average. All food tastes sweet, someone forgot to buy chillies. Food are not heated before being served so all food seems too cold to eat. The prices are high wrt to quality and amount. Worst of all does not accept any digital payment, cash only.

I have been to this much times a lot as it is located nearby my home. It's a pocket friendly homely Bengali foody place. Food is quite good, won't say that bad. The place is not spacious. Easily accessible for bystanders and College goer's. Simple food, the best among all - rice, dal, aloo bhaji, bhetki paturi, mutton/chicken.. and more

Went to have a quick sunday lunch. Half of the veg main courses were not available. The chicken is 2pieces for 100 bucks. Muttom unavailable. It was onky 1pm. The interiors are congested. The air-conditioned portion is small and charges extra. Overall an okayish place.

Affordable lunch and dinner options in and around Jadavpur. Mostly frequented by Jadavpur students after leisurely classes, this place is an ideal go-to place because of its pocket friendly prices and good food. 
Located right at the heart of Jadavpur 8B bus stand, the location is prime and couldn't be any better. 
What we ordered : 
1. Rice
2. Daal 
3. Aloo Bhaja. 
4. Bhetki Paturi 
5. Muri Ghonto 
6. Chicken Curry. 
All of this, and the bill was all of 320.

Worst restaurant ever seen. High price. Quality & quantity not good compared to price. Behaviour of staff is worst I have ever seen. In table there was a glass of water I have seen after my lunch in astami noon. There were other customers also eating in front of me and they left by that time. I was not sure the glass of water was mine or others. I just asked to give another glass of water. The waiter said he will not provide another glass. I complained to the cashier about his behaviour and the cashier said (instead of telling anything to the waiter) to keep my mouth shut (as there were other customers also eating and listening to our coversation) and told me that you are eating for 1 hour and I have no right to complain. Ridiculous. I said is there any rule that customer cannot seat for 1 hour if the eating is not complete. Even in tea shop customers used to seat for an hour with just a cup of tea of 10 rs. And I am spending here 235 only for rice, dal, posto and chicken. Can't I seat untill my eating is complete. And also said I haven't heard these words in any restaurant till now. Paid the bill and left out. I will probably never visit this place.

If you're hungry and want to have a simple Bengali meal then it's an okay place to dine in.

Ordered Rice, Dal, Mochar Ghonto and Pabda Fish.
Rice and Dal was typical. Mochar Ghonto was good although it was laden with potatoes. The Pabdar jhaal was so-so. The mustard curry was good in terms of flavour but the pabda fish wasn't fresh.

Service is prompt

Food - 3.5/5

This place is a saviour for all students staying away from home in P.G or hostel during days of bad food or when the cook bunks and you have to order something homely and filling without hurting your pocket. Located at 8 b bus stand, although I have never dined in here,  their on time delivery and cheap rates are worth mentioning here. Rice, dhokaar dalna, daal,aloo bhaja , aloo posto,chutney and what not! Complete bengali homely meal at minimal cost and good packaging. The quantity is more than enough for two people.

If looking for a place to have good Bengali cuisine in a medium price range which surely goes easy on your pocket, this is the place to be. Having signature dishes both on the vegetarian and non-vegetarian menus,it leaves you with a taste which shall keep bringing you back for some more savouries.

If you are in search of a sophisticated pice hotel in jadavpur area this eatery is perfect. Don't expect fancy decor but it's neat and clean.
It has both as  AC and Non-AC section. the Ac section is comparatively small and food price is slightly high.
They have mastered in all fish items. "Ilish Maacher Maatha Diye Kochu r Saak" is a awesome mouthwatering dish and a must try if available. Also try "Chingri Baati", "Special Daal", "Chanar Dalna". 
The only item I don't like there is mutton. Otherwise they successfully fulfills the crave for Bengali homemade food.
Don't think about the price. In ₹ 500 you can have a royal lunch or dinner for two people.

Last day we had simple plain rice, veg dal, mochar ghanta and chicken kasa. Now price range is a bit high in my opinion but the quality and quantity was too good. Its an AC restaurant near 8B bus stand Jadabpur. Interior ambiance was OK and service was really good. Chinese food are also available but i will strongly recommend Bengali food as they are really good and lots of varieties are available over here. I dont think they have any parking area. Since we were in hurry we couldn't click any pic but next time i will surely fulfill that.

A small food joint.. not very much clean , no such good ambience, just a place to have good food in a very reasonable price. One should give it a try if looking for having dinner or lunch within 100 or 130 rs. (For one person). Service is average. Food is above average. Prices are low. Quantity is good. Overall it was a nice experience. Didn't expect much.. nd it was the same as i imagined.

This Bengali restaurant is located near 8B bus stand Jadavpur.

FOOD: Varieties of fishes and vegetable dishes of Bengali cuisines are served here. Food quality is average. SPECIAL VEG DAL , SUKTO, MUTTON KOSHA need special mention.
PRICE: price is okay for the quality.Not too cheap, not too high.
AMBIENCE: It has two parts. Ambience of the inner part is nice. Art works,paintings and comfortable sitting arrangement. Food price is slightly higher( 10 to 20 rs) in this section. Both sections have AC.
STAFFS are well behaved and helpful.
Overall an average pocket friendly Bengali restaurant.

You can get mouth watering bengali dishes(specially their fish preparation) here which are pocket friendly also. Although it is not decorated like other bengali resturants but their wide variety in veg/non-veg foods will surely satisfy you.
Sometimes the quality of rice they serve is not up to the mark but i m fond of their boti chingri,mochar ghonto and fish paturis after regular visiting :)

We had been to this place during durga pujo last year and there was a shortage of tables. Thankfully, we didn't have to wait that long. We tried bengali cuisine that day and it reminded me of food made by mum. We ordered rice with beautiful moong dal and fulkopir dalna. I had chingri malkairi which was excellent and my boyfriend had parshe. 
Two days back we tried the chinese cuisine in the evening and sorry to say it is nowhere near the awesomeness of the bengali counterparts. The chilli baby corn was rubbery and hard, apparently not cooked through. The fried momos were too dry. But the noodles was really flavoursome.

Till now this is the best Bengali resturant and good Bengali food I ever had. Simply awesome,  taste wise, look wise and price also very reasonable and very good healthy food,  just like home made food,  no much oil and spice,  

Yesterday I oder food,  we had 

 1. Daal of the day 
Awesome creation I must say,  mug base daal with right amount of spice and veggies,  

2. Alu vaja 
Nice and good crisp,  not so oily 

3. Mocha gonto 
Best among the best mocha ghondo I ever had in my life 
So delicious,  they used nut and coconut pic with it 

4. Pomflt macher jhal 
3 big pic fish,  nicely fried and the most important thing fish is fresh,  the gravy is sorse base,  we usually know sorse jhol is quite rich,  but seriously am telling you here,  the way they made the gravy it's simple nice,  less oily and not rich 

5. Aam Chatting
Perfect sweet and sour tst 

It's My personal request those who are liked authentic Bengali cuisine,  please try it once,  it will not disappoint you

I've very recently, last week , 27-05-2016, just ordered Parse Sorse, Dhokar Dalna , Aam Chutney & Rice fine long grain. I don't know who are those people praised a lot of  their Food. My God it's a disaster . Now, I've decided not to order anything from them . Sorry Chef .

This place is divided into two parts- (i) AC section and (ii) non AC section. Basically a"bhater hotel". You will get spicy Bengali food at exorbitant prices. If you don't have any other option, you can give it a try. Being said that it is comparatively economical than its neighbouring bengali restaurants.

Pretty decent food they have got. I went there with my family for lunch. Ordered basmati rice, special moong dal, alu bhaja, jhinge alu posto, aar Mach, chicken, mutton and chatni. All the items tasted really good, especially the dal, jhinge alu posto and chatni. We were 3 and the bill came of RS. 550 which I thing is reasonable. All over a good meal.

The positioning of this place is that of a moderate high traffic bengali restaurant and they have done well to achieve it. The place is actually hidden behind the big buses. the seating and interior is basic. The food is very well balanced. Not too spicy and not too bland. This isnt a restaurant for celebrating your moments but for a regular lunch, it scores better than most in the vicinity. 
We took dal,  alu bhaja, mocha ghanta, chingri bati tarkari, mutton and mango chutney all one plate and two plates of rice for two of us. I liked the food. Mutton was cooked in a typical bata mashla gravy. I expected the pieces to be bit bigger. The quantity of other items too seems to be  a bit less. 
Overall, worth trying and offcourse the bill was below Rs500/- for both of us.

I have been eating there for the last 6 years, not to experience fine dining but to eat a regular meal. One can find good regular bengali dishes at satisfactory prices. However, if one wants fine dining, i have to say, this is not the place she/he is looking for.

Any food outlet located since a long time beside a school or college holds a special place among the past or current students, and this restaurant is not so different. Located in and right at Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand, this place happens to be abuzz most of the times during the day. If you happen to head here, just come inside the bus stand and look straight towards the S9/AC9/AC9B Buses. This is located on the footpath, behind those buses and next to the CSTC Counter.

The interior of the restaurant has a decent ambiance and has a spacious place for dine-in. Take-aways and Rolls can be availed from outside after paying for the amount to the cashier and taking the requisite bill. I have been to this place a couple of times, but all of them were for having rolls. The parathas are mostly wonderfully done. The chicken was also soft most of the times. Although the consistency lacks here. Half of the times, the parathas were soft and melting in the mouth, while for the rest, they were oily.

They offer veg fillings comprising of Alu for anyone opting for an Egg Roll. So, if you do not prefer to have potato filling inside your Egg Roll, mention it to the person packing the same. The service is usually prompt and fast. Nothing to complain here except may be for the hygiene factor. Would love to dine-in here some days considering the cheap prices they offer for their food.

Great if you opt for a takeaway or home delivery. However, getting a table on a weekday afternoon proved to be a time consuming affair even in the congested non-AC section, both the times I visited. 
Service is prompt.
The menu offers a variety of items of which we tried Alu posto, daal, boti chingri, bhetki paturi and chatni. Each of the items were good in taste. I won't say excellent, but considering the price, that's the best you can get. Quantity of rice per plate is enough for one person, side dishes can easily be shared by two. 
This place is students' favourite, specially the ones staying away from home.

This place should be rated higher, though I can't judge the place totally cause we packed the lunch for home.. Bt being a foodie, I judged the food and man it was heavenly sorry homely!!!! 
We ordered rice, dal, alu vaja, bhetki paturi, chicken...
And it was given pretty fast! 
Tasted really really good!! It's been a week I can't still forget the fish ! 😍 
Well the canteenish atmosphere of the place did appeal to me... Will give it another visit to judge totally and review my rating

Don't know why these place got such a low rating... but whatever these is the place where we used  go for hangout with friends during our college life.... we have there both Chinese, Bengali cuisines.... I like the both.... the chicken roll or the egg chicken roll is awesome.... the chef ( Rabi da) was a very devoted person.... and maintaining his standards till now.... today I have been there for a quick lunch..... and get socked they have changed themselves so much.... the restaurant was full... got seat in the AC section.... ordered plain rice, special veg dal, alu bhaja, pulkofir sabji and chicken kasa..... the taste was same as before.... its make me feel nostalgic.... now with the bill... I just felt they have done some mistake.... it was just INR 248.... spending so much for having Bengali cuisines in the city.... the deco was good.... staffs are very courteous and friendly

Situated at the 8B bus stand, this small restaurant scores high at being conveniently located, but low on seating arrangement and price. The taste is good enough for a person living nearby far from home who can come daily here. But the non veg food is expensive. And the non AC section is quite congested at peak times.

Located right on the 8B bus stand and that is the only reason that they are still selling.
Had visited this place twice out of compulsion. Awfully overpriced. I could not explore the menu as i was on a budget crunch both times. But, the way their basic bengali food tastes i won't advise anyone to be adventurous.

 Their is a AC section as well, but with the same food it does not do much good.
If you are hungry or want to have a Bengali meal at cheap price, go to Ashirbad canteen inside JU or Roy Hotel at Dhakuria.

This restaurant is located at the 8B bus stand in jadavpur.

This place holds a special memory for me. Located at a stone's throw from my place of work, I often visited this place for a late dinner with my bestie. We always used to take the seats in the ac section.The quality of food has always been satisfactory but they are a bit pricey given the ambience and location. Nonetheless, it has a fair amount of happy memories.Special mention for the staff,very friendly.

Simply aweful. The quality of the food and the taste are both horrible. A year back when I went to this shabby little restaurant I was quite amazed to find good tasty Bengali meal. However when I ordered for home delivery until recently I found the food horrible. In all the preparation you will get raw smell of oil. The vegetables isnt cooked to perfection. The fishes are poor in quality and the meat are simply pathetic. Only dish which is good out here is chutney. I am really disappointed with their food.

Located at 8b bus stand..this place what I found out is not so-happening but an ordinary one indeed. No special food items..charges are high..as compared to the food provided.. If you want to eat home food then you ought to try here but you would feel a bit of pocket pinch. Dint find any trace of mineral water to drink but a local brand bottle with awkward taste. Overall experience was ok w.r.t the food taste..!!

Chicken roll - That's it! If you are near 8B bus stand and have a craving for Chicken roll, this is the place. But beware, once you have them you won't be able to eat anything else for the next 4 hours atleast. This place also serves some Bengali dishes as well as chinese for the regular folks wanting to have some lunch or dinner. (Probably chinese is served only at dinner)

This is my favorite place for evening snacks,   if you are looking for indian or Chinese  food with a hungry stomach And also concerned about burning a hole in your pocket then this is the very place where you would want to go. The quantity they provide for the price  you are paying is just great as well as the quality of the food. Sure it doesn't have a well groomed ambience or well dressed food servers but If your primary motive is to calm your hunger with a pocket friendly price you can check this place out.

This is not a restaurant meant for fine dining. The ambience is a disaster. But this place reminds me of a very close friend who used to stay there and call me to 8B bus stand to meet,and this place was our obvious choice for some really sasta Chinese food. The food quality is a big plus,especially when compared to the prices they're charging for it. Folks waiting for their buses to arrive usually buy an egg roll from here. This place will always make good business,for their prime location!

During the college days, when we used to chat in the passenger shade at 8B stand, we used to share rolls or chowmin or have a lunch there. From a "bhater hotel", this resturant is trying to bit a bit upmarket. They also have a AC room now. 
But there is nothing to be very pleased about. But I feel there is many student of university who will still nostalgic about this place. 
Food is not at  par - the rolls are better. However, their bread and butter "bhater hotel" food is better than noodles.
