Not a very big Kathi roll fan. Have had the Egg Roll and Egg Chicken Roll from here. Found it to be pretty average. Okay for having them for battling a sudden hunger pang.

KA's is a very simple restaurant located on Keshab Chandra Sen Street. Its very small, plastic stools are on the footpath for sittings, not at all clean looking, but pocket friendly pricing can provide you a quick bite or dinner quite well. Take away is the best option from here & I did so. Their packaging was simple with plain white box, that means they don't invest on printing KA's on the box rather they focus on the foods. Talking about the food lets check it out... 

Veg Fried Rice : Veg fried rice came with average quantity. Less vegetables were used but they were nicely diced into small pieces. Rice quality was okay type. It was very lightly fried & not excessive oily. Overall it tasted nice & their chilli chicken was a good combination with it.

Chilli Chicken Gravy : Their half plate chilli chicken came with 4 medium sized chicken pieces. Just after opening the aluminium foil pack big capsicum, onion, garlic & green chillies floating on the thick gravy looked very delicious to me. Unlike other restaurants what I liked about their chilli chicken is, there was a very thin corn flower layer on chicken pieces where others doubles that layer. Chicken pieces were soft & well cooked. On the other hand the gravy was thick, spicy, hot & excessive rich in taste.

Conclusion : Tight on budget, looking for basic restaurants to fill your tummy, don't worry KA's is a good option to fulfill your Khwaish. The above mentioned dishes costs me Rs. 110 at the time of writing this review, so the pricing were as per its standard same kind of restaurants. The food is also good for spice lovers.

I went on Diwali Day (11th November,2015). Very small shop. No proper sitting arrangement. Very near to Famous PHATA KESHTO Kali Puja. So, that day the nearby road was very congested. I ordered Egg Roll. The taste of Paratha was supereb, less oily,  soft & crispy too. The size of Egg Roll is big too. The behaviour of the shop owner was very polite. I am extreamly satisfied..

Occupaying a very small area in the college street this small restaurant is providing an below average quality of food. The Dry Lemon Chicken and the Paneer Pakoras are not really good at all  where as they are not so good at any dishes that are made here... So, I will suggest not to visit this place without any emergency.
