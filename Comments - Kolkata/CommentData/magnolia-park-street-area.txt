Loved the dining experience and the food was awesome. The ambience of the place was apt.
We visited on the 4th of January, 2018. 
The Special Christmas dishes were simply great. The roasted turkey with sauce was special. The lamb dishes were great too.

We were there at Park Street on Christmas. It was so crowded everywhere. Luckily we found this restaurant to our rescue. It was a nice place. Old Calcutta style furniture and decoration made this place ethnic. We ordered chicken reshmi kebabs as starters. It was juicy, succulent and cooked perfectly. We ordered chicken stroganoff. It was served with buttered rice and basil. The chicken was extremely tasty. It was creamy and cooked to perfection. To wash it all off we ordered gimlet.

Pathetic quality of food. Been here with family few d
ays back.. To my surprise,  the taste of the foods were horrible..  Biriyani tasted like as of from cheap marriage caterer stuff:( which means total waste pf money..  Price was too high.  Biriyani Rs. 333,  prawn starter 395..  Not justifying the taste at all.  Strict NO recommended for non drinkers..

Visited on a New Year day and found the entire place decorated in awesome way.
Gives an old calcutta elite charm, from the seating arrangements to the decorations to staff behaviour everything¬† just gives an aura of that elite traditions of old days. There is two sections of the restaurant. the upper portion is mainly for drinks while the lower is for family seating arrangement. 
Had chicken salad with pineapple, Prawn cocktail. screwdriver and vodka. The prawn cocktail which is one of their best dishes was awesome. The chicken salad was okay. The cocktail screwdriver was really good. Cash and card accepted. price is a bit high when compared to the service provided.

Magnolia, the name is synonymous with delicious food, great ambience, and courteous staff members. I have been to this place several times and it has never disappointed me. The ambience is great and sophisticated. The staffs were very helpful and even helped us decide the menu. The food tasted equally great, especially the chicken wings in bbq sauce. This is a must try! We had chicken chipolata,  and another chicken and rice dish that came with boiled veggies and a thick white sauce (sorry, I cannot recall the name!), along with drinks (planter's punch, blue lagoon, whisky sour, bloody mary, and screwdriver). I must say, it's the best place to hangout with friends over good food and drinks. The service is a bit slow, but we didn't mind that. Overall, we had a nice experience.

Visiting this place since my college days , well its actually two different worlds in two floors , i particularly like fish fingers here , other items such as tandoori chicken or chili fish are pretty average. But as a adda zone the first floor takes the cake , there are numerous times when we friends spent entire evenings from afternoon here. Undoubtedly it's a must visit place in park Street.

I don't know why is this restaurant still keeping up in tat area where classic n heritage restaurants exists. Guess on a Saturday afternoon when there is a 40mins waiting everywhere and this place is empty, explains it.. there is nothing called as ambiance, just two big paintings, and furniture might prove how ola an place that is . Coming to important part food. there was no taste in the food.. at all.. salt we had to add in every dish n soup.. First and last time.
Had ordered Chicken Napolitan, which tasted bad.. ordered veg gravy noodles, which has had very homely vegetables, no peppers, no mushrooms, no broccoli, baby corn. It wad bad

This restaurant at Park Street was amongst  the most famous and happening places in the city of Kolkata. However, over the last decade or so like most other restaurants here this place has lost its glitz and glamour and has been reduced to an ordinary chinese restaurant with nothing special to boast of. However, food quality and quantity continues to be decent and one can have a delicious and sumptuous chinese meal at a reasonable price. Overall a decent enough place which can be visited to get a feel of the erstwhile happening Park Street!!

Magnolia was highly recommended to me by my uncle, whose favourite it used to be when he lived in Calcutta‚Ä¶in the swinging 60‚Äôs, when it was something of a gastro-pub. You have to seriously stretch your imagination to make any connection between his stories and the sad, shabby, dreary, smelly, rundown place this restaurant on Park Street has become. I had a beer, nibbled on some of the stale muchies which come with the beer‚Ä¶and left. Shame on the owners who have such little respect for an old Calcutta brand with such history. Don‚Äôt waste your time with this place, there are far too many better options within a stone‚Äôs throw.

Waste NOT. Want NOT.

Brought up in the city, I have never explored the 'vintage' Park St. restaurants. 

The visit to Magnolia was nothing to write home about. 
These places are not frequented by many. Neither the ambiance nor the food has that vibe. The legacy is carried over by a bunch of smiling staff eager to help. 
Cheers to the legacy the city is :)

What can I say ..... the worst experience I ever had in Kolkata was here at Magnolia. Staff here don't even know what they are serving. After a long wait we had our food served, which was a fish kabab, unfortunately was the worst I ever tasted. On top of that my gum was injured and I was bleeding because of a hard big FISH BONE which was inside the fish kabab. Have you ever heard of a bone found in a fish kabab, when you are paying at a premium. When I pointed out their mistake, the person said it was regular and ok for them without even trying to apologise.

The rest of the dishes I ordered were all disaster, the less I speak better. Only advice to any foodie...... THERE ARE BETTER PLACES NEAR THIS RESTAURANT, AVOID MAGNOLIA IF YOU WANT TO HAVE GOOD FOOD.

I went with my friend to Mags for a couple of beers.. well to begin with - we ordered some spicy chicken and some french fries, which was amazing to taste! The availability of beer though is kind of a set back. I say this because the beer which u want may not be available at all times. Anywho nonetheless the ambience was fatafati and this place deserves more attention than the over hyped Oly Pub; which is over priced and the food quality keeps on deteriorating. Anyway you should definitely visit this place atleast once if u live in kolkata!

Went to the bar above Magnolia. It's Mags, a popular bar mainly for pocket friendly drinks. It's a typical old calcutta type bar, little shabby,  dark, some unpleasant odour. The crowd is either regular customers (who got special attention)  or young people. Unfortunately only Miller's, tuborg pints and Kingfishers 650 ml bottle were available which was a downside. For starters we ordered "today's special" chili fish which was really spicy, typical Kolkata style Chinese with basa fish. Second starter was chicken tikka kebab which was really soft 5 good pieces of chicken with some salad. With tax we paid around 750 bucks all together. Overall it's a pocket friendly bar in Park street. If you are not that sophisticated , want to discover Kolkata charm, can visit this place.

Few weeks back in a winter afternoon, I checked in to Magnolia with my girlfriend. It was her birthday and it was her choice of cuisine and obviously that had to be Chinese. 
The restaurant was almost empty that time so we got a lot of concern. It will give you an old Kolkata feel naturally with their decor and furnitures. The well dressed staffs came to us for orders and they were pretty good. We directly ordered main courses as both we have very low capacity in intestine. We ordered mixed fried rice and szechuan chicken. The quantity was great for two people and the quality was moderate. I was not happy by the meal but was satisfied. So according to food quality, they need a little improvement. Otherwise Magnolia is recommendable.

The bar above, Mags is a more popular hangout where you get very cheap booze and of course great food at low cost from the Magnolia kitchen... When Oly is full, as is the case most of the times, Mags can be a saviour... And do not forget the fish finger with tartar sauce at any cost...

Coming to Magnolia after early 70's and if my memory serves me well it's the same. Actually we were looking for Waldorf and as Magnolia had this Kabaab festival we turned into it to be greeted by Iqbal.

Loved the old school ambiance and the antique furniture.

We had a chicken Kabaab combo that came with six juicy chicken pieces beautiful done and a soft crisp Nan. 

I had coconut bectki fish with white rice. The fish was cooked perfectly though soft but held itself in whitish gravy. A great dish.

The nimbu paani was good.

Overall a great lunch in a grand old restaurant.

Iqbal and Amit enhanced the experience.

An old outlet battered with age but still holds the taste. Went last week for a lunch on a weekday. Surprisingly at 1:45 PM, we were the only customers. Ordered Chicken Chipolata & Chicken Supreme de la Volleile. Food presentation was good. And the taste was fine too. However, it seemed that too much flour was used while preparing the white sauce. No issues otherwise....

Visited this place specially to try out their duck delicacies. Ordered the Duck-in-brown-sauce-with-steamed-rice. The duck really does taste awesome. Although a bit pricey for us students, but we shared, so that's an option. The ambience was also pretty good, as we were left to ourselves. The only sticky part was when the waiter appeared confused about the menu of his own restaurant. But overall a good restaurant.

Its a perfect place for "a cheap talli experience". I don't know about the ground floor. But on the top floor the booze is extremely cheap. Ambience is okay..  To me its the best place for a group of friends to hang out especially when you are short on pocket (which is the case most of the times ).  
A smirnoff 30ml peg cost Rs67. We also had gin shots whuch cost about rs100 for 60msl pegs. 
Along with that we took aloo chat, masala papad and CHEESE PINEAPPLE CHERRY. We weren't sure about what that was at first,  but then quite surprisingly and dissapointingly we found out that it was a cube of cheese, a cube of pineapple and a cherry made together by a toothpick within Them.  Its a ridiculous dish. 
But however,  we had an awesome experience.

Resto pub of age old tradition standing along the line of age old park street eatery heritage.. two sections, upstairs purely for drinks while lower family section.
Drinks are cheap and food is quiet good.
Tried their prawn cocktail which is a signature dish of theirs and honestly it tasted great stuffed with a fair amount of prawn. The chicken salad with slices of pineapple on the other hand was not so great.
Ambience is standard, nothing worth remembering...
Prices fr food fall on the higher side.

Located in Park Street within walking distance from metro, this place is quite an old one. I'd been craving to give this restaurant a try and finally got to have dinner on christmas eve, last year. I don't know if the reason was the date of our visit because Parkstreet is jostling with crowd on christmas week but the service was pretty slow. Also, they served the starters and the main course all together and the food weren't much appealing to the taste buds. The fresh lime soda, however, was refreshing. Price is on the higher side. Hope to have a better experience next time.

The place is really expensive, although it is understandable considering it is at the heart of Park Street however this restaurant is not for the ones who are on a budget or who want to have a meal on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The quality of food however is acceptable but not worthy of the charges implemented on them.

Park Street is famous for numerous numbers of restaurants and Me and my husband decided to go for Mangnolia by word of mouth publicity heard by one of my friends.

The Ambiance  is good the Tables are made up of wood and polished to provide a good finishing touch the restaurant is having separate arrangement based on the number of visitors whether a group or a couple. They provide a number of varieties from Veg and Non-Veg section and we decided to order a North Indian cuisine which Dal Makhni and Amritsari Kulcha.

The Service was prompt and the food was really good the Dal Makhni was typical in taste like it actually from North. Well the budget is slight above the average but the Quality and the ambiance compensate this off from other restaurant in Park Street.

I wish if there was an option of negative rating , I would have given it -10. 
Horribly callous staff with no intention of serving. They themselves do not know what they are there for. After placing the order, which mind you was not an easy task, we are told none of the fish items are available. After what seems like eternity the food does arrive. But it's served cold with the same cold indifference. By this time we have given up and we just want to leave. 
Now we have to go out and look for something to eat. 
Go if you must. It will give you a lesson in patience if nothing else

It was our favourite hangout for gettogethers and parties at affordableae rate. Like the fish fingers, chicken in whisky sauce and sizzlers. Moderate ambience with old school guitar band on special occasions.

Cheapest restaurant ever in the park street area. We had no plan to attend this place, as olypub was no accepting cards , we had to go to magnolia. It's a pub and restaurant. Ground floor is the restaurant and 1 st floor is the pub. Drinks, in the pub cost half the price of the restaurant. We had gin shorts (blue riband) @‚Çπ50/30ml. Food quality was very good. I only have complain about the ambience of the pub. It's too shady and I didn't like the playlist.. But, what else can you expect st such area, in a rate like that. Definitely i ll visit this place again and again.

The ambience was moderate.The food was not so good.Just liked the chicken hariyali kebab.We ordered chicken fried rice,butter nun,two chicken side dishes,which were not up to the mark.Service could have been better.Basically went there to check some other restaurant but due to a huge crowd had to settle here.They only had the Christmas special menu.The options available were very less.Ended the menu with brownie and Christmas pudding and both were below the mark.Just a one time visit for the kebab.
The recommendations and the menu are also not available on ZOMATO.

If you want to have a taste of continental food along with drinks in a restaurant at Park Street area, then I would recommend you to avoid this place. You will get only disappointment here and not quality and taste.
The food quality was below par, and to emphasize the fact that the food was served cold. The service is also below ordinary.¬†

The Magnolia management needs to buckle up.

The food was okay comparing the price. The waiters are in a haste to clear the table. My experience: They took away the mutton chap bowl before I could take the gravy. The best part of this restaurant is that it remains crowd free when waiting time in other restaurants is more than a hour during puja

One of the more popular restaurants at the party place of Kolkata. I just love the ambience of this place, replete with paintings on the wall and their spic and spac seating. The cuisine is mostly continental, though they serve Chinese and mughlai as well but i have never managed to try them out. We had the Christmas special Turkey and Lobsters. The turkey was moist and juicy and delicious. The Lobsters are a specialty here and that was superb and you can even see someone scraping off the last morsel from the plate, it was soo good. The Christmas environment around Park Street is special and our pre- Xmas dinner went with the mood. Would love to come back again and again.

Located diagonally opposite of Olypub. This restaurant is expected to have much more business than it is doing presently . This place needs to improve a lot on the following aspects:
1. Quality of food- 2/5
2. Promptness of staff- 1/5
3. Behaviour of staff- 2/5
Only positive thing seemed to be comfortable seating and standard of housekeeping but that doesn't satisfy a customer who has come for a sumptuous meal.

I have been to this place for may times but never realized that I have not reviewed this place in Zomato. Well lets not try and judge this place for the food atleast, much better places in Kolkata to have good food. But if friends and booze is in your mind with some good chakhna's this is one of the places to think about.

Booze is moderately priced out here and with that go ahead and order some fish fingers, Chicken Tandoori and kebab's. The seating arrangement is not that great but great if you can grab a table at the first floor thats great. Sit back and enjoy the booze with friends.

Pint here costs approx 180INR and the cocktails are nice.

A decent place to hang out at and will not really disappoint you much with its old school decor and feel.

One of the very famous restaurants located on Park Street. I finally visited this place last Sunday with 3 of my friends. On reading the reviews I was a bit apprehensive at first, but on visiting the place, my  views have changed completely. I have no clue as why most people have given it a bad rating. Because my experience out here was more than satisfying.

It's spacious and the seating arrangements are really comfortable. We were 4 of us, and we ordered :
‚Ä¢ Fresh lime soda
‚Ä¢ Chicken Salisbury steak
‚Ä¢ Chicken stroganoff
‚Ä¢ Chicken Tetrazzini
‚Ä¢ Grilled lamb with English mustard 

Each of the items were amazing. But I can speak exceedingly well about the item I had ordered - stroganoff. The herb rice had the perfect flavour, and the gravy was rich and tasted out of this world. 
I tasted all the other items too. The Tetrazzini was creamy and had enormous amounts of chicken. And both the steak and lamb chops were soft and succulent.
The fresh lime soda was also served generously in a large glass. 

Pocket pinch - 1758

Beginning with the biggest drawback, which is, the choice of alcohol becomes limited very often, specially during the festivals, and many of the mocktails, desserts, and dishes are often not available. Nothing special about the decor and the service is just fine. Have tried several items like lamb chop, crab claws, malai kebab, chicken tetrazzini, chicken baked with cream, fish fingers with mayonnaise, grilled chicken, mixed grill sizzler, and liked them. Tried a spinach and  cream dish once, which was good. The alcohol has gone up in price in the recent past, which is not a favourable point. Overall the food experience is good.

Situated in the food hub of Kolkata this eatery holds a significant role in the park street eating scenes. It might not be the best restaurant among the hub of  park street but it has its old school charm. The ambience is pretty decent, nothing out of the ordinary yet comfortable. The food is nothing short of greatness. I enjoyed what I ordered. The fried calamari was fulfilling but a wee bit chewy, the other dishes On the contrary were absolutely spot on.

This is a decent eatery located at the heart of the city. It's easy to locate at night, thanks to it's big, yellow sign board. Decent ambiance and sober decor, a typical family restaurant. I highly recommend their Fish Fingers. The pieces are served long, fresh and steaming hot, clubbed with some french fries, a mayo dip and salad. The main course was not that great. For desserts, they did not have anything except the vanilla ice cream inspite of having so many options in the menu. The service too, not up to the mark. Standard pocket pinch for two would be around 1k.
I would definitely recommend to up the standard of the meals for better customer attraction.

It's a decent place with sober decor. Went to have lunch with 3 other people... Ordered chicken steak, supreme de volatile, PPR chicken dry, lamb chacutier. Which cost us 1424 including taxes. Coming to the food.. Every dish were prepared perfect, the supreme de volatile had the perfect taste of cheese and chicken with boiled veggies, the lamb dish had a perfectly cooked meat with sour flavoured gravy over it... Liked the decor of the dishes when it was served, the personnel out there are very courteous.. The only downside was it took a long time to serve us the ordered food.

Dimly lit environment, old staff, confused waiters and an expensive menu, that's Magnolia for you in one plate.
- Had a couple of drinks and dinner with a friend of mine, environment is quite and frequented by office goers and couples
- Being situated in the Park Street area is the only good thing about this place apart from good food
- Final verdict, if you want to drink then go upstairs at Mags, Magnolia's pub because its way cheaper, but if you are out with your family or a special someone then you can give this place a try

It was one of those pleasant summer evenings when I got over with work a little unexpectedly early.  Eager to catch up with a couple of college friends, we zeroed in on Park Street. A pleasant walk down Park Street, a balmy early summer southern wind... and nostalgia... these were the very stimuli that kind of nudged us to walk into Magnolia.  Perhaps the last time I had dined there was a good decade ago with my family. 
The place pretty much retains the old world charm. We were greeted by a liveried janitor and a whiff of a strange smell which was a concoction of may be cocktails and musty carpets and pungent spices....  we ordered our beers and cocktails (I ordered a fancy Cuba Libra while my other friends decided to stick to conventional beer). The waiters were courteous and served the drinks very deftly. However the winner of the evening was the amazingly tasty and succulent Prawn Sizzler that we ordered. It is definitely one of the tastiest things I have ever dug my teeth into... the taste is very smooth and the prawns were fresh and cooked to perfection... not too wobbly or soft neither too tough. The creamy mushrooms and crispy vegetables accompanying the dish is remarkable. And all this gastronomic delight at a perfectly affordable price.
Thumbs up to this place... definitely gonna be back soon. 
Oh... one word of advise... the restaurant should think of improving the music...

Mags, i.e. Magnolia's sister pub sells one of the cheapest liquor in the area. I've been here numerous times for a drink (or more :P). Service takes time, especially about food and its mostly indifferent. 
The decor is a bit barebones and a bit gloomy, frankly. A little bit more decor and ambient lighting would have been so much better.
Coming to food, i loved their Charaunda Kabab : Brilliantly tender, flavourful chicken kababs on the bone, a bit like Pahari Kebab, but very well done. The portions were good too. I also have loved their grilled cheese sandwich, the paneer bhurji and their masala papads as well.
All in all, worth visiting if all you want is a good, quiet and safe place for a drink.

Reminiscent of an era bygone -

Park st has fond memories in the heart of every Calcuttan and so are the restaurants. Banking on the same nostalgia, I decided to step into Magnolia, one of my favourites in the 90's with the high nosed waiters and long queues outside.

Stepping in, I get the feeling of an abandoned house. Dilapidated and old decor. Chairs which are really dirty and old. However, the service is really good ( we were the only patrons there).

Food is decent fare, which is why the rating. It's painful to see a restaurant of such stature in the golden days go down like this.

As our every year trend we visit The Olypub on the Christmas eve. Last year, due to extreme crowd at Olypub we instead visited this place. The prices and items are more or less similar to the Olypub. Their bar is known as Mags and is on the first floor. A bit less maintained with few of the ACs not working properly, the atmosphere wasn't very friendly but the food, staff and drinks made it up for us. Overall, not a disappointment.

Magnolia is very popular as it holds a legendary role in park street eating scene , so you will always find it pretty decently running even on weekdays with people gushing in big troops or friends also there are the family zoned folks filling in the tables all the time.
I had been to this restaurant when I was invited by one of my friend who had wanted to celebrate her birthday and this restaurant was a bang on target for her since it looked very nice from outside , so we decided to get our tables sorted for 8 people and not much needed to do the seats were already available for us, so we quickly settled down and started placing our order which was divided in two parts that is the starters and main course .At first we ordered first crispy chilli baby corn , crispy chicken and soft drinks which was nicely done .
Then we moved on to the main course which comprised of crabs , chicken,indian breads and rice for a wholesome experience to remember as their service was very appealing and not to forget one of my friend had forgot her bag inside the restaurant and she rushed back and found it was safely kept , so that shows its a restaurant with great hospitality and welcoming atmosphere to come again and again .

BOMBED : The experince at Magnolia (twice) was not a great one in anyway right from the start. I'd heard stories of this place from people who gave it lot of acclaim about its good food and service. Mine was quite the different as the food was not really upto the mark and the service men were not co-operative. Though the place was filled with few people they refused us a seat of our choice though it remained empty as well as unreserved from the time we had been there. Hope u had/have a good experience if u plan to visit here.

One of the cheapest watering hole out there in park street where you'd have the family ambiance.

Never had the food here and I don't think I'll try it in the future too.

But man-oh-man Rupees 60 for a 30ml Smirnoff, you're off for a treat, one of the cheapest booze joint in Park Street aside from Olypub where you could drink to your content and still not feel the hole burning through your pocket more than the neat Vodka shot you had.

Waiters are  attentive enough and well behaved.
Whiskeys and Scotches are priced pocket friendly too and it's great for catching up with friends over a peg or a chilled glass of beer.

Cheers!!

As it was the new years eve, getting a table in a restaurant on the park street was a challenge as usual.. and magnolia is a nice choice as one  can experience the new year extravaganza while dining and without getting mobbed on the street...ambience during this time of the year is good but on usual days the place may not look impressive .. the menu especially continental is bit restricted... but I would personally recommend chicken in whisky sauce and chicken tetrazinni which are good especially the former ...steak isnt that great .. however one can drop in occasionally to give a boost to the taste buds..

Starting with tandoori chicken, it is better than most other places.
Then, the veg augratin and chicken in whisky cream sauce delighted me. Full marks for that and I recommend it to people who love cheese and baked food.
Lastly, the special of the day was apple pie with ice-cream and it really was special in taste. It was delicious.

Went there on Valentine's day 2 years back. Decent experience overall.
Food - 3/5.
Okay with the Chinese and Continental, would love to check out their duck next time the Duck Festival is on. The drinks would burn a hole in your pocket unless you are well-to-do or some bigwig.
Ambience - 4.5/5.
The aura felt particularly impressive, more so probably because the calendar read 14th February, and the restaurant's adornment more than summed it up.
Service - 4/5.
The staff were seemingly ready to help; and although the service was slow at times because of the rush, it never really got to the extent of becoming painful.

I have been visiting mags and magnolia consistently for the last fifteen years and have a lot of memories there.
Magnolia have a great and laid back ambience with a very friendly staff and if you are a regular they will make you feel at home.
If you are at magnolia try out there signature continental fare which is not very varied but all items are well prepared and can be compared to the best star addresses of the town.
Chinese selections are very limited.
There is some variety in snacks and starters which accompanies alcohol.
Overall a nice calm place with good food and great service.

An old, neglected and a very underrated restaurant. If you're looking for a no frills place with good sumptuous food and big servings at a reasonable price, this is great place to go to. However, if you're looking for a five star like appeal, you may be disappointed. The restaurant has good and quick service and courteous staff.

Had been here quite a few times and as always they have always lived upto to my expectations and proved me that this one place where I can come with every person... Friends,family and my girlfriend too. Food is no doubt brilliant and one of my favourite is the chicken chipolata they make it amazing there and since I love a place which is not busy this place tops the chart. Overall keeping in mind the food and the ambience I would definitely give it a 5 star.

Went there after a long time- very disappointed with the behaviour of the waiter. the crowd was not descent, though the food we ordered was good but not a proper place to have dinner with your partner. There were group of people who were laughing, screaming and shouting after getting drunk- the management didn't took any effort.

Rating-3.5 is not because of the food its just I don't like the ambiance. Therefore its better to parcel the food and have it in home.

Just opposite to olypub , beside hakuna matata.

A little joint in park street .

Ambience - 2/5

Food - 3/5

Not a very good first experience here.
Ambience is dull .
I think they should work on their dining and interior.

*Bathroom is unclean too*

So anyway coming to the food.

I ordered -

‚Ä¢ Beer .
‚Ä¢ Chicken tetrazzini - Minced chicken baked in wine sauce and cheese with mushroom and veggies and pasta , it was all plain just like a plate of   
cheese pasta. 
I personally didn't like it much . I had this dish before in one step up and I feel they serve this better.

For desserts I ordered from their new menu that was apple pie with ice cream - It was horrible served with vanilla ice cream. I left half of the pie .

I wish they look after it and work on.

Mags was previously the stag section of Magnolia but recently saw, they have started allowing ladies in mags aswell.
Alcohol : Half of the beers are not available. Fridays and Saturdays are even worse, u'll b left with 1 or 2 choices in beer.
Waiters are comparitively better than the food they serve. Food is a complete disappointment and needs lot of improvement. Even the place is quite shabby with some of the tables having plastic chairs.
But then again, if you are looking for reasonably priced alcohol and food, deal with the shortcommings!

As a first-timer visited Mags ¬†during the festivities of Durga Puja this week with a dear friend. The decor and ambience is still not much to write home about but the food was certainly delicious and one for the taste buds to savour. Staff are friendly and well behaved which is essential for any restaurant. We had chinese cuisine and it costed us around twelve hundred bucks for two. In the end, we came out happy with the experience. Price was reasonably balanced.¬†¬†Would like to re-visit and try some of the famous North Indian cuisine that Mags is known for. Thanks for the memories.

How come a Calcuttan miss park street during the biggest and most awaited festival of the year. Durga pujo is incomplete without pet pujo. We were 7 people and we wanted to hit peter cat on ashtami night but  the queue was less in magnolia so changed our destination. The puja menu included tandoori lobster , tandoori pomfret, Dum biriyani. I wanted to try the lobster but rest of the group wasn't in the favour. So what we order : chicken malai kebabs, mutton dum biriyani, plain nun. chicken tikka masala and choco mousse. All were mouth-watering and tasted so well that you would want more but unfortunately you are too full to eat more . Visited magnolia after a long period and loved it as much as i used to love in the past.

One of the bizzare place of parkstreet if u want to take a drink or want to hangout with friend's!!!! 
Few negetive points among long list of negetives are 
1) Absolute bogus service !!! 
With all the lathergic and demotivated oldies will serve you some drings after not only u place an order but also keep reminding for the same 4 to 5 times even when there is no rush!!! 
If you only take mineral water bottle then only u will get prompt drinking water otherwise after several reminders also they will serve the water in such a bottle which we generally discard after using. 

2) ambiance and cleanliness : nothing great about it.. some time u may find rats running on the floor to play some hide n seek with you!!!! Stinky smell from washrooms will mesmerise you if you sit in the last 4-5 tables.!!!!! 

Well I guess this is it!!!!! Even In my worst nightmare also Before going there next time I will give it a thought for not less than 1000 times!!!! Really disgusting and irritating!!!

Visited good old mags after years and after a tiring durga puja shopping spree at new market. Since it was so hot outside it was essential for us to have some beer and we were glad that we were served absolutely chilled beer..I've never seen mags go wrong with its drinks :) 
Since we were also very hungry we ordered a chicken chatpata and a chicken malai kebab. Unfortunately the chatpata was a downright failure..there was nothing "chatpata" about it and it just tasted like home made chicken kasha but with a flavour of liver in it..and me with my absolute dislike for liver, was too disappointed to even take a second bite. But as I am strictly against wasting food, I gulped down the whole thing somehow although my partner was kind enough to share the major portion of it. I'm afraid but I would never suggest this dish to anyone. Next we had the malai kebab and thankfully it was better than the chatpata..However I have had better malai kebab elsewhere so found it to be nothing extraordinary.
The last time I had visited mags was about 6years back(I really loved the chinese and indian food they served back then) and at that time they didn't have the continental section. So this time we tried out two dishes from there.
The first one was grilled tuna with boiled veggies and mashed potatoes. The taste was like any usual baked and grilled dish with lots of butter,cream, garlic and parsley but the shocker was to discover that the fish was not tuna at all..it was plain grilled bhetki. Though the taste was good, misrepresentation of fish on the menu is not a very transparent practice and should have been avoided. If they couldn't provide tuna they could inform us the same..not serve bhetki as tuna.. a big thumbs down for that.
The second dish was chicken chipotala whicj also contained sausage and salami and boiled veggies and lettuce. This one was good too..the chicken was of a good size and was soft and well cooked. The sausage and salami had nothing special in them and just provided company to the chicken. The dish tasted good and I didn't find any complaints there.
Overall I felt mags being one of the vintage restaurants of the park street area, should really buck up to provide quality food made with a little more care..otherwise will continue to be overridden by many similar restaurants in the same area. I wish them good luck as always.

Went there after a looong time. (Because today was a bandh & oly was closed) previously the mezannine floor section called 'mags' used to be a stag section, loud crowd beer stinks et all. Today I found out they let even ladies in there. Food is average. Booze was cheap because of certain 2:1 offer on ultra max.
To say the truth mags is the last joint we hit when no other option is available. So no high hopes.

Don't know why this place has such a low rating. Me and my friends find this place quite interesting. The place is nice and clean, seats are comfortable, atmosphere is cool, staff are well behaved, price is really low and most important this is their decoration according to to occasion. Went there during the Football WC and found it was just perfect for the occasion. Flags of different teams were hanging, even a small goal post with footballs were there....even had drinks for different countries.
Food is really good. Doesn't take too much time to serve.
Staffs are really all gentlemen.
Surely would visit this place again and again.
Just a suggestion- They can increase their mocktail menu...

Without reading any review from Zomato we just entered to the restro and literally surprized to see that only 4-5 people were in the restro.. We were like - Ajto pura watt lag gaya!! We took a seat and ordered after a lot discussion 'Chicken Supreme De Volaitte' and 'Chicken Stek Sizzler'.. ¬†Ummmmm... it was nice.. I mean not extraordinary or something.. But the taste was above average.. We liked it .. Should we try it again? My answer will be , Noh!! its a restro for one time visit!!!! ¬† :) :p

Magnolia or the bar counter Mags as it is more popularly known is a place to be for cheap booze with starters. Apart from occasional haunts, every year during the durga puja festival our school batch organises our reunion at this place. The fish finger is pretty good, coupled with the chicken kebabs. Pineapple and cheese with a spot of rum and you've got a plateful. The fish dishes are recommend especially the chilli fish and baked fish.

To start off , it took me 10 minutes to make the person who was taking the order to understand .. What is prawn?! 
I dont believe he couldnt understand a word that i was saying and he inquired from me whether Prawn was veg or non veg.
The restaurant was stinking like shit.

"With exams hurrying by on it's golden chariot, I need some refreshment"- keeping this on my mind I entered this place. Though it was not on top of my list, but I was in the area and it was around 5:30, the place was not at all crowded with just few people here and there. I settled with my regular chicken sizzler and a bottle of breezer, but once my attention fell on Magnolia special Menu and its first item "Duck Kebab" I couldn't stop myself from cancelling the sizzler to hit on the kebabs as appetizer. The attendant was quite polite and the food was served real quick(considering a duck-meal). It was very delicious with all its spices and preparations. But those small four pieces couldn't tame my hunger, that I took the liberty to order Grilled Chicken served with seasonal veggies n baked potato, which was again tantalizing and worked as a magic on my growling stomach. Since I had a little more time and budget for my self-treat I ordered a Blue heaven( vodka-based cocktail) while enjoying my time with a thriller "Cut Short" freshly grabbed from my library, TBL. It was an evening well spent for a couple of hours of pure tranquility and solitude. That why I liked the place, the foods were good, service was appropriate and satisfactory. Though some might not like the place based on previous reviews and foods are bit expensive, but according to me it is a one-time visit worthy enough. You wont be disappointed.

My experience with this place has been very very very bad.
I visited this place during last year's Puja.
Ordered continental as they assured that everything is available from the menu they served us.
At first they came and said a certain sauce is not available, then came up with the excuse white sauce is not available and then we ordered basics of all they said that is also not available.
Moreover they gave the excuse that the noodles is rotten and won't be able to serve it.
Awful experience from my part.
Sorry for giving this rating but can't help!

I am not a regular visitor of Magnolia, but last week when I hit this joint for the 3rd time, Magnolia made me wonder how can I ever forget reviewing it at the Zomato! So this place located opposite to 'The Park' is one gorgeous place and it's ambience is a win-win with comfortable couches and dim lights. The staff is well managed and courteous. I am fond of  their chinese to be honest. But apart from the chinese i don't think Magnolia can ever stand up to your expectations in terms of food. The tandoori I tried from here was moderate as was the biriyani. The place charges you reasonably and thats the only good thing. No, Magnolia cannot serve you great food if thats what you're looking for.  So bunk Magnolia for any other restaurant at Park st.

We always went to the bar part of Mags on the top floor. Reasonably priced Liquor, comfy sofas, dim lit ambience and very good staff. Their recommendations are nice. I always have the chicken tandoori here, goes best with Old monk!
And other good food items are crispy babycorn, basa fillet . Food quality is nice and to satisfaction.

Magnolia at one point of time was famous for their Ice Creams..Gone those days and with it the standard of this place has fallen sharply..However we usually prefer Mags which is basically the stag section cum bar of Magnolia located on the 1st floor adjacent to their main entrance..This is actually quite a pocket friendly option for booze and spent some quaint times with your friends..The ambiance is a bit shabby but this place is not as crowded and noisy as Oly pub or Silver Grill..The food is decent basically blends well with your drinks..Try their Fish Kebabs or Dry Chilli Chicken, you will enjoy it..Also the cost of alcohol is quite moderate..I have never really tried their main course items since we are mostly full after drinks and starters..However at one point of time they used to serve quite delectable Indian dishes,can't vouch for the present quality..You can try their Chinese main course dishes after a few pegs of whiskey..portions are good and price is economical..Only Con is that the wiaters might be a bit rude at times and insist on a fatter tips..so be cautious about checking your bill after getting dizzy..

Though I have heard many praises of the restaurant from my elders I must say my visit has been a total disappointment.I visited there with my friends and here is my feedback.
Ambience- Nothing great.
Food Quality-We ordered roasted duck with barbeque sauce only.The taste was horrible and the only good thing about the dish....well was nothing.
Price-Two plates coasted us Rs 1015 which is very much on the higher side compared to other restaurants serving Roasted Duck as especially taking into consideration the amount they provided.
Overall a very bad experience

Bar menu and food menu is made by the Zomato officials, at their home.¬†
Don't go through the rates in the menu, it's exactly 3 times of what is given here. Dear Zomato team, be little responsible before you misguide your followers!

I went to have lunch at the Magnolia with the two of my friends. And I loved it. The Christmas decorations (it was Christmas eve), the general classic feel of the place, the retro music.... EVERYTHING! But then.....
The staff appeared to be a little curt and impatient and that was kind of awkward. But once the food was served that didn't matter. We were starving. 
We ordered Chinese as we often do and we were not disappointed. The fried rice, the chicken, the fish all decent. Nothing special though.
The price was appropriate.

Should I crib about the precious two hours of my life I gave to something unworthy? Probably I should. Yes it was catching up with one of my best friends in Kolkata and the venue we chose was Mags Pub. The fancy named bar was a total turn-off with nothing worthy of mentioning. Will definitely mention the live experience of Jugaad- using a straw for a stirrer. The food was way behind the expectation even the ones which we ordered on recommendation of waiters.

When I write this piece of review, I mean it exclusively for Mags Pub. Excuse me Magnolia!

I have never felt so strongly of a place before and except for that bowl of munchies, that Tandoori Chicken ( <---0.5 extra points) and that bit of chat masala, nothing was good in there....NOTHING. The ambience, the food, the ones attending to you and the banter over tips could all compete with each other for being the least deserving. Not a bit worthy!!

Well, just for information's sake, I dropped into Magnolia for using the washroom and it sure did not 'seem' any better :/

Magnolia is one of the most really old watering hole in park street. Located opp oly pub this place has managed to hold its own mainly due to its very cheap pricing of liquor n food. Not too many options in the liquor dept but the pricing makes up for it. The food is actually good n there are many varieties to chose from. The ambience has been pretty much the same throughout the years and the service temperamental. Still a good place to get drunk without burning a big hole in the pocket.

Located in the Park Street, just beside flurys it's a place to dine in.. One of the oldest restaurants found in the street with gigantic portraits of people who lived in history. At first it will look like a old cafe with a glass wall which is the only thing I loved. To talk about food it wasn't such yummilocious and to talk about its decor there is nothing except few wooden chairs and tables and the sea food dishes were also not good.. Overall it's a place just to hangout.

Magnolia, popularly known as 'Mags' is arguably the most under rated 'old is gold' restaurant in Park Street. Located just opposite The Park, one could easily walk across its length and completely miss out on its existence. However, its humble outer appearance is just a mirage and the insides pack some serious punches.
I went there sometime near Christmas. I was with a friend looking for a good and new place to eat and suddenly, we were standing right in front of Mags. Since it was Christmas time, some special dishes were on the cards. Inner gut kicked in and we entered.
The best part about Mags is its beautiful ambience. Massive portraits on the wall gave the place an antique feel while the whole Christmas arrangement was beyond words. Settled in, we ordered a duck mexicana and a lamb dish with plain rice. Mind it that it was a special menu and one may not find these dishes there generally.
The food was good. Really good. The duck was spicy as it was supposed to be and the lamb packed in huge bursts of various flavours. The only probable downside? The quantity. Though it will only bother you if you're a Mr. 'I-love-food-and-I-eat-a-lot'.
I'd recommend this place to anyone for its good food and service. Try it once. It deserves to be much more appreciated.
Enjoy!!

Mags as it was known in more elegant times when Calcutta was the swingiest place East of Suez. Its the place where some great music was heard and many a up and coming crooners started life and went on to become legends in their field. Super English and Anglo Indian cusine was its forte. Sadly it went into a nosedive in the late 70s onwards and has now emerged as really a super dhaba. There is NO ambience and the place has a seedy stale dingy¬†atmosphere. The menu lists North Indian,"Chinese" and some Continental dishes which at best are rather unappetising,=too much grease,lacking flavour and mostly overdone. Sad Sad days for one of Cals iconic restaurants.

The restaurant is big , spacious and the ambiance is nice and thus sums up the review for Magnolia. The food is not just up to the mark. Everything right from the duck, the rice, the fish, and the chicken smelled of a sauce which was too much to consume. It gave me a bad feeling and left a bad taste in my mouth and the price is just similar to the legendary Park Street joints but the food.

Park street has always been famous for its famous restaurants. Magnolia is located in Park Street with its peers. A place must try for continentals. The food is really good, worth paying for. The ambience is normal, nothinf extraordinary.
What I despised was the delay in service. We had to wait too long for the main course when it was ordered before the starter came. I loved the dishes with liver...slurrrp slurrrrp. Must try their moctail with prawn...yummy.
It is their food quality that they hold on to the crowd even when their service is poor. I would rate them 1 out of 5 for service and for other factors 5 out of 5. They invite their guests cordially and really treat them well until the guests leave. No pork is served here, so people who are choosy can drop in for a good luncheon or supper.

It was new year's eve and all our school friends planned to meet. It was huge as some of us were meeting after some 6 and a half years.  So the celebrations had to be great and unique. Park street was the only option as we were all scattered in north and south kolkata. We decided moulin rogue.  But it was all filled up. This made me notice that mags was a bit on the emptier side. So the eight of us hopped to mags.  It was typically a pub type only the music was missing.  I felt the staffs were quite rude and straight forward.  When we wanted some more peanuts , they denied,  but when it came to asking for tips, they gleefully asked for it from us. 100 bucks would not suffice them. Anyway,  as for the order, I do not know why Smirnoff was under "gin" section in the menu. However,  I went in for Smirnoff,  but there lime cordial was too crude. So I chose sprite for the next peck. The other stuck to bacardi white rum and another group to budweiser. The food I heard is brought in from waldorf. The chicken chatpata was great. Spicy and sweet and  sour.  Exactly what one needs with wine. Then of course the chicken tandoori was okayish. No special mention though. But whatsoever, I am hopping back here whenever i want to get drunk due to the cheap price of the liqour.

THE WORST NIGHTMARE ON PARK STREET:
1. The waiters are boorish, with no sense of mannersim.
2. You have to wait for minimum 15 minutes to draw their attention.
3. THEY ARE FRAUDS, ADULTERATED THE TURKEY WITH A CHICKEN LEG PIECE.
4. In another case, they served duck, when specifically turkey was ordered.
5. The waiters fought among themselves in front of the customer, to bag their own order.
6. The hard drinks menu card on Zomato says 60 ml, but they actually serve you 30 ml.
7. The food is meager but taste is not bad. (2.5/5).
8. To conclude, I would never visit them again or will never suggest somebody to go there.

It's funny that we never tried the Magnolia restaurant even though we've been in Mags like hundred times. Everything is good: food, booze, seating, not much to complain about except the staffs! 

They'll smile at you, serve you well, they'll run for you for a quick quick refill, but, if you don't tip them as per their hopes, they won‚Äôt let you get out of your table haha. Not literally, but yes they'll ask for more. Very irritating!

Wide range of snacks, good Mughlai, good Chinese, good french fries! Surprisingly most of the similar bars there in Park street make utterly disgusting french fries. And yes, they serve really good roasted duck in Dec-Jan. 

Recently, after too many complaints I guess, they have fixed  their cracked/damped walls. Not much of renovation, but now it looks repaired and tidy than before. A very good place for a regular evening with your friends or colleagues. Standard price as per the location.

Just located opposite park hotel. "Magnolia" is among one of the oldest eating destinations in park street. This outlet has been in business since ages. Used to visit this place in the past during those festive seasons, when getting a table in other restaurants like "Mocambo" and all used to be very tough. Basically started exploring "Magnolia" as a second choice, but after experiencing their warm hospitality and succumbing offerings I became quite regular to this joint. After years of gap, I paid a visit to this joint this week, the interiors are somewhat similar with little bit of adjustments(hardly noticeable). Those colonial gigantic portraits on the wall, the ceiling lights, table layouts etc; everything gave a nostalgic feeling. The decor over here though has become a bit shabby with the flow of time, yet the ambience is quite soothing as always. The staffs and waiters are still that very courteous and hospitable as they used to be. Their variety of offerings ranging from north Indian to Chinese and various continental fares are still similar as it used to be. The mouth watering and succumbing flavor and quality of their offerings are still intact. Though the QUANTITY of their offerings has been curtled tremendously, but the prices are still surprisingly less than reasonable as compared other restaurants in the park street area. Overall still one of the best restaurants in park street to try out, specially if you have a limited budget and yet wanna enjoy the warm hospitality and ambience of a park street restaurant.

Planning a post -event celebration we were searching for a place we have not been to. Then someone suggested this place. We decided to give it a try. Dont let the small shady entrance fool you cause the interior is grandeur.  Subtle music and spacious seatings, this resturant is a good to go if you are going in groups. We ordered steaks, Chicken tettrazini and chicken chipolata. Tettrazini is my personal favourite , being an ardent cheese lover. Amount per portion is also good. Give this place a try as the food is good and though the pricing might seem a bit high , the food is worth spending on.

We all ended up at the Mags Bar and not the restaurant.

The place is shabby but kept clean.

It was a sort of reunion for us and we found seating for a big group.

The ambiance is pretty average and just about okay.

We had ordered liquor and some sides. The fish finger served with mayo was awesome. Quality was top notch. Nice fish fillings and the mayo taste was too good. Service is pretty fast.
We had asked for extra mayo on which our request was turned down quite harshly. We were even okay to pay for just that item but somehow they didnt want to serve it.
The liquor prices are a bit on higher side compared to oly on the opposite side or silver grill next to it.
The worst behaviour came from the staff when we paid them 100 bucks for tip and they still wanted more. We were shocked when they were making faces and passing comments.

Certainly not going back again because of the behaviour.

Cost 2.5/5
Quality 3/5
Quantity 3/5
Ambiance 0.5/5 (considering staff behavior)

Wanted to come here since quite some time. And so it happened on a sunday we found time and opportunity to come here. The place has the same old place feeling similar to most other places of the old in kolkata especially park street.

We had some starters like the fish and chicken tikka. We also had the stroganoff. I think everything we had was satisfactory. However it is a bit on the pricy side.

One of my school friend suggested me this place and trust me something I will not opt for on the first go when I have thousand other options available at park street kind of place. 

First impression was good. As we sat inside, we found very minimum crowd. We skimmed through the menu and quickly ordered for Chicken Chowmein, Chicken in garlic hot sauce and a glass of vodka for my friend.

Chowmein taste like a roadside fast food and quality is average. Tell me why should I pay a premium to you when you're providing the roadside quality. Chicken hot garlic sauce was OK but less in quantity. I would appreciate if the pieces were little more than what you provided. 

Anyways, on a short duration that's my take - Service is OK, pricing is high when compared with quality - not high when you compare with their location - PARK STREET, ambiance is average - not something to vouch for.

Overall, not a good experience. Try at your own risk!!!

Being a frequent visitor of the ParkStreet Area, I've been pass Magnolia uncountable number of times. And finally after god knows after how long, 20 of us decided to come here for a post-event gala. The restaurant is spacious, with simple yet classy decor with the in house music giving you a very old vintage feel.

Speaking of the food, we ordered Chicken Steaks, Chicken Tettrazini, Chicken and Prawn Creamy Sauce, Chicken Chipolata and a meal from the Chinese section. My favourite would be the Chicken Tettrazini and I'm gonna call it the 'Cheese lovers paradise', its wholesome, extremely delicious and completely satisfies your taste buds!

The steaks were standard and good and the Chinese meal did justice to its kind too. The staff was polite and courteous and guided us well through the menu. Also to mention that their service was very quick and efficient. 

Overall a great experience, a nice place to stop by for some good food :)

My review for this particular restro-bar is specially dedicated to my college friends who are spread all across the globe now,and to that night when we had the best of our times at Park Street Kolkata.
We had been to Magnolia on a day when our semester exams had ended after an unfortunate postponing. It was the first time I had gone hanging out with this group and after a little survey at other restro-bars in and around Park Street,we found this place to be a little pocket friendly.
Without even looking at the Menu Card for once we ordered some Baby corn,Fried Prawn chips and a few pegs of 100 Pipers.The first two rounds were absolutely fantastic,especially when we enjoyed an entire table at our cost.
The food was no doubt very tasty and we ordered some more of the prawn,this time along with some chicken spring rolls.The taste seemed to elevate now.
Since we opted for the Chinese we found that the vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes are quite well balanced.Enjoying some Lemon Chicken and noodles simply brought us into the mood.
Not to forget the courteous staff and also the North Indian dishes this restaurant serves(although we didn't opt for it this time).

But when I came back to this place again I stuck to North Indian and no alcohol.The Chicken Do Piaza and Mutton Seekh Kebab are the best two dishes I have had from this place.Any gravy item is simply super-fine here with the Roti and Naan.
The interiors are large and the ground floor reminds me of the old restaurants featured in Bengali films dating back to the 60s.
The desserts were also quite good and offer a wide variety of choices for the foodie.

All in all as far as I can rate Magnolia I'll put a 3.5 for the ambience,food and the price.

Although the veg menu is not that fat but given the age of the restaurant hardly anyone in Kolkata would have gone out in restaurant to have vegetarian dishes.

First  of  all ..........  this  review  of  mine  is  for MAGS  &  not  Magnolia  .  we went there yesterday after a long hiatus to chill out on a saturday evening .  One good thing i noticed in MAGs was that unlike before , they now allow women / ladies to drink . coming to drinks  here you would get regular scotch at rs 216/60 ml peg , including your regular vat 69  , teacher's  black dog & 100 pipers . if you are willing to go one slot higher then  you will get 12 year olds of 100 pipers , black dog at rs 294/ 60 ml peg.  but my suggestion is  go for IMPORTED scotch in which you will get JW RED label  at rs 273/ 60 ml peg . Food is quite decent   too here though i feel that portions here are less than at other places .  in food you can  go for chakunda kabab ( rs 140 / plate ) or chicken tikka kebab  ( rs 140  / plate ) . overall  a decent place to hang  out with friends if   you are on a tight budget . overall 3.5 from my  side

So many memories attached with this place with friends, clients. Have been a regular for 10 years to magnolia on 1st floor . Even my some high profiled clients preferred to go to Magnolia instead of some hi-fi restaurant as they too had many memories attached to the place. 

We visit restaurants to get good food and Magnolia never disappointed for 10 yrs. If you look at the Menu card the prices are so less. Indeed unbelievable. Their fish and chicken tikka items melts in your mouth . 

I hope to be there soon.

A complete no - no place for a vegetarian. The menu hardly has any vegetarian dishes. We ordered a crispy chili baby corn, which was among the worst ones I've ever had and left the restaurant feeling hungry. Half the dishes in the menu were unavailable and the staff could be least bothered to be courteous.

I have been to Magnolia or as we lovingly call it Mags ever since I can remember.I grew up with the stories of how my Dad used to bring my mom on dates here and how their love blossomed over soups and milkshakes in the 1980s . So a few days back,I decided it was time for a revisit.It was a weekday.I found myself seated at our usual table along with some family friends in the dimly lit restaurant.The staff were pleasant and friendly as usual.And the place looked as elegant as ever.We ordered Tandoori Chicken, Mixed Gravy Chowmein,Mixed Fried rice ,sweet and sour fish,Roast whole Duck in brandy sauce,Roast shredded Turkey in Brown sauce and Chicken a la Rex which was a continental dish. The roast duck and turkey were not there in the main menu but we specially asked for it as we had tasted it before.The duck roast drizzled in the mouth watering brandy sauce was just out of this world.The Turkey which was a seasonal specialty came with boiled veggies and cherry tomatoes wasn't too good and tasted like the meat had been stored for quite a long time.The continental dish (You can check the photo I have attached) was too bland and even though the rice came dabbled in a lot of cheese and cream,It lacked the taste.The Chinese items were good (both the chowmein and fried rice) and so was the tandoori chicken.The sweet and sour fish was just ordinary and too sweet.The pricing was reasonable.A lot of items seemed to be missing from the menu and the continental options were very limited.The different variety of ice creams and mocktails were missing ( including my favourite Nolen Gur Ice Cream).One of my friend who a few days later went to dine there said,that she couldn't order the Turkey as it wasn't available anymore and I promptly told her that she was saved.And the place seemed to be missing its old charm.The food was just ordinary and we really felt disappointed as the wide variety of global dishes and the flavorful food that distinguished it from other average restaurants somehow got lost over the years.

My verdict - With a heavy heart I write this,Mags isn't the same place we have known over the years.If you want to try a restaurant at Park Street which only boasts of reasonable price and average food,this is your place.Don't experiment and stick with the basic Chinese and Indian dishes.Somehow I don't find myself looking forward to going back anytime soon.

Unpleasant experience of the Month!!! Never ending queues in front of the popular restaurants pushed us to enter Magnolia. Where to begin - Prawn Cocktail with chewy, stale prawns, The fizz-less 7up served with our Vodka, or the Chicken Chatpata that had an overpowering smell of Maggi Chicken Masala! We left promptly and could not risk having the mains!

I had visit this place at last february'14 with my couple of colleuge. Atmosphere & environment both are good. But, main disapointment was the taste of food. We have ordered two chicken items & surprisingly their test was same. We ordered biriyani but it's took 40 minutes to serve.  We take 2 Vodka & 1 Whisky 60Ml. pegs,  for 3 people I had spent 2,500/-(Incl. Tax). So, I think olypub is better than this one. But, if you have family, than magnolia should be ur best choice.

I have sweet memories of going over here with my parents. The food used to awesome and have heard from my father that the ice creams they used to serve (used to be Magnolia ice creams) were magnificent as well. However by the time I went over there, they no more had their self made ones, and were replaced by Kwality ice creams. 
This place has past its prime time, and unlike a few Park street restaurants which have been able to retain their heritage of serving the best cuisines in city, they have faed off with time. The last time I had food over there was a couple of years back, and the standard had drastically deteriorated. The staffs were not helping either. The food had a definite burnt smell which they ignored to admit.
If you have a nostalgia for this place then you may go, and witness the difference. If you are a first time goer, then avoid this place.

I have been eating in Magnolia for the past 10 years though not regularly. Its a fantastically located restaurant, just in the heart of Park Street. Iv tried their  Chinese and Indian and I have liked both. They make great Chicken boti Masala, though I was quite disappointed with the veg Jhalfarezi which used to be brilliant earlier. Go for watching Park street pass by.

Though I practicaly live across the street I never went to this place until recently. I went there for the first time last 25th dec. The original plan was to go to oly pub but due to the long queue we finally ended up here. 
The first thing that got my attention  was the decor. The entire room have an aura of old English pubs with comfortable seating arrangements. I found the ambience to be very "soothing" for a Bar cum resturant.
The liquor options were limited but everything on the chart were available (for a change). 
The food quality was so so,normal bar  food; neither to mention separately nor to criticize. 
Though the duck (Christmas sp) was quiet scintillating to the taste buds. Overall a good place to hangout with friends.
(One word of caution- if u have a low tolerance bladder you might wanna go low on the liquor. You don't wanna end up in their tiny bathroom)

I have been a regular here for quite sometime now needless to say I go with my friends mostly Saturdays but then you will more often than not find this place to be crowded on a weekend  probably due to the fact that the drinks come cheap, but the food is not too bad either. I always order the dry version of chilli chicken and it doesn't disappoint, a bit oily though my other recommendations in starters would be aloo chaat which is really good not kidding at all, cheese cherry pineapple on ice if you want something sweet and the good old vegetable hakka noodles I haven't had the chance to try the other main courses on the menu but definitely would like to try something new on my next visit. The decor is nothing to boast about but again its not a family restaurant (only men) unlike magnolia on the ground floor. Overall I feel this place is for friends catching up over drinks on a weekend and having a gala time.

Have been to Magnolia if am passing by the area and in mostly in the evening around 7-8 p.m but never for a proper dining experience except once. I go to this place if i want to eat something that is quick to get in that area and doesn't cost much. Mind you most of the good restaurants in this area are costly. Magnolia for me is a safe bet. I usually eat a sizzler or some chinese dish. The regular sizzlers are not great but for the price it is not bad either. Of the Indian dishes I like the kebabs a lot. If i am done with some shopping and don't want to waste to much time waiting outside Peter Cat or other places like BBQ then I just eat here. Place has a basic set up and no fancy service. if you are looking for a reasonable dinner then this is a must visit.

Magnolia located at Park street opposite to the iconic Olypub, has two sections, the family restaurant on the ground floor and the watering hole on the 1st floor only for stags (which is known as Mags). 
I have been to the restaurant once and the experience was disappointing. We tried only chinese back then and none of the items were impressive and seemed over priced. I dont recollect the exact order since it was few years back.
On the flip side, I have visited the 1st floor with my guy friends several times. 
It is a watering hole for guys with a basic set up which is putting up a stiff competition with Olypub as the service here is marginally better with more number of food options to choose from. 
The set up is simple with basic tables and sofas. Can hardly accommodate 25-30 people. It has a small TV which plays Zee Cinema or a music channel throughout the day. It also airs Cricket/Football matches  at times. 
The food available here is pretty good and is worth the price. Must try options are : Chicken Tikka Kebab and Chicken Chakunda Kebab. Pricing is reasonable for both drinks and food. Chinese items are also decent but I would suggest the Indian kebab items to pair up with drinks. The complimentary mixture along with drinks is also pretty tasty :) 
An average place to hang out with your friends with out burning a hole in your pocket.

We visit magnolia frequently. I like the ambiance of the place. My favorite snacks at Magnolia are fish finger, cheese cherry pineapple. The food is also very good, specially Chinese delicacies like American Chopsuey and variety of chicken preparations. The staff are very very friendly and will keep you updated with any special items (if) on offer. They help placing order to the extent whether its quantity will be sufficient or excess. If some part of your ordered item is untouched, they pack and give it.
You can also try the best in town Tutti Fruti ice cream , along with a variety of other ice creams which they provide.

Its highly recommended for couples who will like to chat for long over great food and spend a wonderful evening.

The food is good, but certainly not extraordinary. The ambiance was fine. The waiter was however a bit late in delivering. Had our drinks with startets like dry chilly chicken, French fries, pepper chicken and fish tikka all of which were good. Rounded off the dinner with a nice chocolate icecream.

Best place for continental. The restaurant is old and has still got the colonial feeling to it. The other type of cuisine are just good. But continental is simply great. Also the price is very reasonable and the portion per plate is very good. The best dishes are the chicken and lamb dishes. Also they make great cocktails. A very good place if you are hungry and mean serious eating experience.

This place has always been more if booze joint for me than a real eatery. There are two floors to this place, and the two floors are as different as the two sides of a coin. The top floor is a guys' thing, mostly. I have never seen families and couples hounding the upper floor of Mags. The place is also quite shabby. Nevertheless, it has its own followers.

The lower floor is more like a proper restaurant, with n eye to the decor and ambience. Here, you get to see families and couples.

The food here, is good (not extraordinary), and I have almost always liked most of what they serve. However, as I said earlier, to me Mags is more of a booze-joint than a holistic eatery (Don't know why!!!). 

So whatever little I have tested here is good with drinks. The service is good in the lower level, and mediocre in the upper segment.

I just cannot discount Magnolia on my visit to Park Street and visit there at every chance I get. The menu is not one of the most massive ones but whatever is served, is served whole heartedly. Veggies can be disappointed a bit by their preparation and me being a vegetarian, I have to especially mention the waiter the kind of preparation I want and every time they have made the effort to fulfill my wishes. 

For me, the main attraction of Magnolia, is its dim environment and cozy atmosphere, which is perfect for huge groups as well as romantic couples. Sipping chilled beer along with chili mushroom and masala papad, can be really refreshing after a long week at work. 

The price is not going to pinch you at all, considering you are in Park Street and with it being centrally located, as it is, you will never have to try too hard to reach out here. I guess mostly the fixed customers frequent here and thus, you will not have to wait in the long queue to find a place, unless you are visiting with a huge group.

Overall, the vintage appeal of the place, dimly lit environment, less noisy atmosphere and precise menu with economical prices is definitely going to make your evening, a memorable one.

park street is the vrindavan/mecca/jerusalem for foodies and like a devout follower we look for divinity in every door,one of them being magnolia.this is another eatery with both tandoor and chinese menu and alcohol license like most others in park street.
we went there looking for decent chinese and we got some.the ambiance,although not to loud,has an old world buzz-less charm that lets you settle into a gentle reverie. a date would go just fine. so,i really find this zomato rating absurd.

Magnolia is mainly visited by people not finding a place in the other more popular restaurants around the area.This restaurant cum bar serves Indian,Chinese and also continental food.
The ambience and decor is quite nice.I have visited the place a couple of times and mainly had their continental items.The quality of food is nice.But the quantity is on the lesser side.They take quite a long time to serve their food too.
Once I had visited the place with a friend attracted by a banner displaying an exotic sea food festival was on.Wanting to try something different we tried a squid item which was actually quite good.

Make your way to Magnolia now to savour some delicious dishes! 
2.5 out of 5

Just opposite Park Hotel and among many popular restaurants in Park Street stands a cosy, little eatery called Magnolia.  I am afraid that you'll not be very impressed by its gloomy exterior, but once inside the restaurant, you'll surely like the ambience, food quality and their service. The waiters are quite prompt and efficient and respond to your beck and call at the drop of a hat.  The place is never crowded, so there will be no problem in finding a seat. Visit this place anytime between 12 noon and 11 pm and you are sure to find a table here. Drop in for a drink or a three course meal! Believe me, dine here and you'll never worry about burning a hole in your pocket! 

I have been to Magnolia twice and both times I have liked their varied preparations. I liked some Chinese dishes like mixed chowmein, sweet and sour prawn, chilli fish and chilli baby corn, but Magnolia is more famous for serving lip smacking north Indian delicacies. I found their chicken tikka kabab, tangri kabab and prawn tandoori very delicious. I am also a great fan of their tandoori pomfret, chakunda kabab, stuffed kulcha and plain pulao. If you do not have any plans of dining here, you can also drop in here for some lip smacking snacks and munchies along with your favourite drink. Magnolia prepares some yummy chicken pakoras, paneer tikka and paneer bhujiya.

Twice I've had their tandoori pomfret and both times the flavour stayed in my mouth for a long time. Dine here if you cannot find any place at other restaurants in Park Street.

Magnolia, or Mags, as it is affectionately called, has been a watering hole for many at Park street, especially for those who do not want to go to Olypub and get drunk with the odor of smoke and booze lingering on them. The menu is Chinese, and if the waiters spy a lady, they are accommodating and nice to you, mostly on the principle that one must be nice to women.

Recently, my order there was a bowl of hot and sour chicken soup, chicken chow mien and my friend ordered a fried fish. I don't like their biryani, but I dont mind their Chinese food. Its not bad at all. The fried fish was a medium portion, served hot, and was tasty according to my friend. I found it too fishy smell-wise. On the other hand the chow mien was greasy and tasted really oily. That is one thing I personally despise.

This place is really very average. Food quality is not that good and quantity is also not that much. Staff are should trained in a better manner and prices are not worth it. Prawn Cocktail was not yummy as described by one of the staff. Only item which i liked was chicken pakora. Ambience should be very much improved. 
Overall, a mediocre restaurant.

My only visit to Magnolia left me disappointed. The restaurant is supposed to be one of the best-known ones on Park Street, but the quality of the food and the quality of the service were not very good.

The decor and appearance of the restaurant is good, but that was pretty much all that was good with it. The menu was the first disappointment. Clearly, Magnolia was projecting itself as a bar that served Indian and Chinese food, instead of the Continental food for which it used to be famous.

Nevertheless, a selection was made of the few Continental items on the list and the order placed. It took over an hour for starters to reach, and slightly less that two hours for the main dishes to arrive. As it was a large group, one might have expected some delay, but two hours seems inordinate. The food was not very good. The Baked Fish was not good, and neither were the Fish Fingers. The Indian items ordered by others were better, but not extraordinary.

Not the kind of place one would like to visit again, unless the service and the quality of the food improves drastically.

Review for the ground floor:
Just been here once, was very apprehensive because from outside the place dint really look upto   mark considering the fact that its located in a posh locality and has an array of other bright options. However, i wanted to try a new place so hopped right in. The ambiance was fine, not over the top but good enough to dine in casually. Service too was prompt and the waiters were courteous . I always prefer a place where one is well attended and in that they did well. 

Now coming to the food & drink: found it cheap compared to other restaurants located there and to my shock i never thought but food was yum. The pepper chicken, steak and my favorite smoked salmon. Yummm they were. I will deffo be going there just for there salmon and will also recommend those who love the same.

This place is a real mystery to me.I wonder how such a place that looks like a dark alley from hell(believe me the first floor bar actually is) and infested with a sizable population of rats is still running and doing business in a posh location like Park Street.High time authorities at KMC and the owner wake up and take notice!!!

Now comes the experience part.Had been to the bar on the first floor with a couple of friends on a weekday afternoon.Found the place to be deserted(for reasons mentioned above) in spite of dirt cheap prices of booze.The waiters were busy watching television and seemed pretty reluctant to serve us.Had a couple of drinks which was served along with a complimentary "chanachur" and we vanished within an hour.Upon seeing the rats we did not have the guts to order snacks.HORRIBLE!!!!

P.S. Review based on first floor experience and not on the restaurant on the ground floor.Does not deserve to be rated.

Always wonder why people go to this sort of a restaurant. The bar (on the first floor) is dirty and filthy. Staff are uncaring and unwelcoming. It seems they have some fixed Clients (for whom they reserve fixed tables) and would like to serve them alone.

The restaurant on ground floor is in urgent need of pest control. The menus are so dirty that I had to wash my hands after handling it for placing my order.

No wonder I was feeling sick after I had my dinner.

Take my advise... stay out of this place if you love your money.

Just don't go there.That's what I'd say. They charge too much for whatever they serve and their amount is also very small. Nothing fancy about taste also. Stuff is only like the place itself.But I must say that the decor of this place is somewhat aristocrat and they also play soothing music in the background. But you never go in a restaurant only for its decor, now DO YOU? If not, then it's no place to go at all.
