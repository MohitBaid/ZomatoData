In the Baguiati, Kestopur, Lake Town and Bangur area, there are several restaurants that are serving great foods in a pocket-friendly way, and Afeemi is one of them. Its a new restaurant in Baguiati. I have ordered their "Chicken Lollipop", "Chicken Spring Roll", "Chicken Fried Rice" and "Chicken 65" through Zomato Delivery. All of these costed only Rs. 340/- with no hidden delivery or tax charge. The delivery was prompt and within the stipulated time. Regarding the food it was just Yummmmmmm..... Every item tasted so good to me. But, there is a suggestion from me, the main course items, chicken fried rice and chicken 65 were too much spicy, they should reduce the amount of chilly used in these two preparations. Afeemi can be considered as a highly recommended restaurant and since its a new restaurant, so, instead of calling it a hidden gem, I would like to coin the term "Budding Gem" for this restaurant.

Ordered for a Chicken lollipop, a Masala Vada Pav and Honey Chilli Potatoes. Pricing is economical.
Coming to the food, all of them tasted great! The chicken pieces were big. The vada pav tasted quite good. For just 40 rupees, there were like 50 potato wedges. I wonder how they make profit. A real hidden gem this one is!
