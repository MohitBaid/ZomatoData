A really crowded nd legendary place beside shobhabazar metro..it opens around 4.45 pm..so try to go before 5pm if u want a comfortable dining experience..because after 5.30 pm u hv to wait only to get a seat..my favourite is DIAMOND FISH FRY,PRAWN CUTLET,MUTTON CHOP,EGG DEVIL.. i dont like kabiraji but u cn try...all of their items r outstanding..nd before u finish DONT FORGET TO ORDER CHOCOLATE PUDING.. it is the best part...price here is not very high..staffs r also well behaved..they hv a special kind of sauce...only demerit is lack of space to sit..so go early,grab ur seat nd just gobhire jao inside those fries..

I'm rating this outlet only on the basis of food.
It's a popular eatery located near Sobhabazar Metro Station. Ordered the Fish Finger, Diamond Fish Kabiraji and Chicken Cutlet, all of which tasted great. The Diamond Fish Kabiraji was amazing.
Pocket pinch is less.

Mitra Cafe, Shovabazar 
More than 100 years of Legendary delicacy for kabirajis and fries.. 
Location: opposite shovabazar metro station.. 
I have been their several times but didn't got a chance to write about this place.. 
Nothing to tell about ambiance its simple and posters of celebrities on the wall ..
Sitting area is very small best to take away.. 
We have tried several dishes like fish kabiraji, prawn kabiraji, mutton kabiraji, fish diamond fry, chicken cutlet, kosha mutton with bread.. All the food items are really tasty and not too much oily.. 
But all they need is to renovate the place and buck up with the service..

I went there many times. First time i ordered only fish kabiraji. And that was awesome. 2nd time ordered chicken kabiraji.fish roll and something mughlai fish and roti. Everything was so good. But the problem is the space is very small. Otherwise it is a good food joint. Kolkata people should visit atleast one time. They have other franchises. But they are not like this main branch. It is the best.

Went there last year. Ordered Mutton breast cutlet, Diamond kabiraji, Mutton brain chop, Choco Pudding. They had seperate AC and Non AC section. Though they didn't charge extra for AC. The service was fast enough. The taste of each and every item was divine though the thought of having a brain gave me creeps initially. The pocket pinch is on the lower side.

One of the oldest caterar and resturant in Kolkata. Its main outlet is at Sobhabazar crossing. Other outlets situated in Golpark, Shyambazar, VIP Road.
We ordered "Brain Chop" & "Fish Kabiraji" from the counter. Later one is the main reason for its excellency . Food quality is quite good. Ambience is good. Service quality is satisfactory. Price is above average. The main problem with this outlet is that it could not allocate many no of foodies due to its lack of space.

Preserving the old cafe culture of Kolkata with wooden chairs, tables and not-so-polished outlook. This cafe has both Non-AC and AC seating arrangement, although both have capacity for 8 persons only. I went there with my friends and ordered Fish Diamond fry, Chicken cutlet and mutton stew with bread. The cutlet & fish fries came in a short time followed by the stew in another 5-6mins. The quality of the fish fry and chicken cutlet was good as original "bhetki" was used in the fish fry and the chicken cutlet had a solid chunk of chicken. Both were fried well and was served with top quality mustard sauce and onion-cucumber salad. The stew was also cooked well. Overall a good place to have deep-fried snacks. Biryani was also available if you want to have a meal.

Gist: Great Place for Kabiraji Cutlet, Brain Chop might feel much creamy to eat, Cheap pace to eat but hard to get a seating. Washroom is there for one person entry.

This place is easy to locate. Been there at 3 times. The place is small, around 16 people can eat. Staffs are cordial. Tasted Brain Chop (Brain of Goat), Prawn Cutlet, Prawn Kabiraji, Diamond (Fish) Kabiraji, Fish Finger, Chicken Kabiraji, Chicken Cutlet, Fish Diamond Cutlet, Mutton Kabiraji. Each of them tasted great with respect to the price. Would visit again.

Another one of Kolkata's legendary food outlets, this is their original shop. The cutlets, kabirajis and chops are mouth watering. Sadly, the brain chop was not available in my last few visits. The serve a mashed potato along with the delicacies. Stone's throw away from the Sovabazar Metro, space is a concern here. So, you have to be prepared to share a table or take parcels.

Mitra cafe, sovabazar needs no introduction. This is an age old place which has a brilliant food legacy. Have been here countless number of times. Chop, cutlet, fries and kobiraji are the delicacies that will fulfill the pangs of hunger in you. Try any food you want, they will never fail to impress. If you are in sovabazar area don't hesitate to try this restaurant. The only negative point of this restaurant is, it is not spacious. But try this out, it is highly recommended.

In other words, the dishes they provide has the authentic flavour of the old Mitra cafe (which my father usually says). Therefore I would recommend everyone to go at this branch. Their fish kabiraji tuti fruity ice cream is highly recommended.. Chicken and mutton kabiraji are also nice...

Mitra Cafe is Traditional old restro in North Kolkata. Nothing to say about their food quality. All is good. I tried for lot of times. Mutton Do-piyaja was favourite of my father. I love their Chicken Do-Piyaja, Fish roll, Fish fry(price is little high), Diamong fish kabiraji. I had all these items when I have gone there for several times. Their disadvantage is maximum time, they takes payment in cash, no card system. And may be due to high demand, few items u will not get. Otherwise it is the very good restro. U must pay a visit.

History and food all together. The ambience is exactly what you’d expect it to be and much like most places in north Calcutta and mostly Calcutta priced so reasonably. A deep fried mutton kabiraji is an absolute must try and fish fry is so fresh and delicious. The special kasundi adds the perfect zing to the plate. This was by far a plate of love, heritage and a city.

North Calcutta is home to all the legendary food joints and there's no denying it. A trip to North Calcutta is incomplete without a visit to this famous eatery. Their menu card boasts of a few prize winners like the Diamond Kobiraji, Mutton Cutlet, Butter Fry(not found on the menu card so make sure to ask the person serving you) and Brain Chops. It's a severely cramped up joint with a very limited seating capacity so make sure to wait for a while if you're visiting this place on weekends. But waiting for a table is worth it as the food is kick ass. I had visited this place 2 weeks from now. We had ordered the ever famous Diamond Kobiraji and Mutton Cutlet. They had run out of Brain Chops that particular day so i came back home a bit disappointed. Everything about the Diamond Kobiraji is perfect starting from the size to the taste to the egg batter. The most striking fact about the kobiraji is the size and the quality of fish used. It is served with salad and kasundi(mustard sauce). The cutlet had a very soft filling underneath the layer of fried breadcrumbs and yes the filling had sufficient quantity of mutton. Some of the items will not be available not due to lack of Production but most probably because they've run out of it. For dessert we had ordered chocolate Pudding which was presented quite well but didn't taste like the typical pudding. Not the place to order dessert though yes a picture seen earlier had deceived me and you should stick to the fried stuff. The staff is extremely well mannered and will do everything to help you make up your mind regarding what to order. And did i mention that this is a pocket friendly place and therefore it is a Favourite with the college goers. You'll also find a bunch of old faithfuls who are regulars to this place. The atmosphere is a mixture of food, adda and antelamo which is expected from a north calcutta cafe. Looking forward to my next visit to this place.

The food was quite ordinary . The service is quite fast .One need not wait more than 10 minutes to get a table even during the rush puja hours . However during the pujas , you may not get all the items mentioned in the menu.

Been to this legendary place few times but didn't got the luck to try their famous Brain Chop ever. Mitra Cafe is holding a big name in Old Kolkata style cafe section. There are some people love to have a cup of tea with their famous chop & cutlets.

Location : Its very simple to locate at Sovabazar crossing opposite to Sovabazar Metro. Yellow coloured banner of Mitra Cafe is easy to notice from a distance.

Ambiance : Ambiance? They are least bothered about it. Rather they are busy showingoff their own name on newspapers that came decades ago. The number of people visit here makes them enough cash to improve this small cafe but they choose not to. Old walls, old chair and tables not at all well maintained and I don't think this is to give the old style feel. Fortunately AC dine is present inside.

Service and Management : From their big menu card doesn't matter what you choose their Staffs are gonna disappoint you by saying not available. However service is fast & we only got this items.

Mutton Kabiraji : Served in a Mitra Cafe printed plate Mutton Kabiraji was quite big in size. Its crispy brown golden colored textured coating was thick inside pouring was tasty & not excessive oily. This dish is well made over here & giving it a try worth it.

Fish Fry : Their fish fry is just opposite to their Mutton Kabiraji. It was really small in size & very deep fried. Due to its extreamly deep fried nature freshness and taste of the fish inside became dull.

Pricing : Mutton Kabiraji for Rs.100 is a very good  option but Fish Fry at Rs.65 isn't worth it. No added VAT Tax is an advantage.

Conclusion : Worth a single visit only if you love old Calcutta style cafe and their foods.

We ordered..
•diamond kabiraji- dis was good, can try once...
•mutton kabiraji- a bit blunt on taste...won't recommend to have it...
•mutton biryani- light but too much oily...the potato was tasteless and mutton was chewy..
Overall...can visit if u solely want to experience dat typical street food of old Kolkata under a roof...

Mutton Kabiraji : Served in a Mitra Cafe printed plate Mutton Kabiraji was quite big in size. Its crispy brown golden colored textured coating was thick inside pouring was tasty & not excessive oily. This dish is well made over here & giving it a try worth it.

Fish Fry : Their fish fry is just opposite to their Mutton Kabiraji. It was really small in size & very deep fried. Due to its extreamly deep fried nature freshness and taste of the fish inside became dull.

Pricing : Mutton Kabiraji for Rs.100 is a very good  option but Fish Fry at Rs.65 isn't worth it. No added VAT Tax is an advantage.

Conclusion : Worth a single visit only if you love old Calcutta style cafe and their foods.

We reached there on Panchami evening...the place is too small and crowdy...
We ordered..
•diamond kabiraji- dis was good, can try once...
•mutton kabiraji- a bit blunt on taste...won't recommend to have it...
•mutton biryani- light but too much oily...the potato was tasteless and mutton was chewy..
Overall...can visit if u solely want to experience dat typical street food of old Kolkata under a roof...

It is an old shop in Kolkata.But it's food quality is average.The kitchen area is also  unhygenic. Ordered  lachha parota which was too crispy like 'nimki',chicken cutlet and chicken curry.Taste was not so good.I personally don't like this legendary "Mitra Cafe."

There are very few joints available in Kolkata about whom your comments are meaningless, becoz u don't have that time to write big words and appreciate it... I have mentioned 'time', which means u will b soo indulge in eating food there that u will only tell others to eat eat and eat... So STOP talking and GO to Mitra Cafe and start eating... 👌🍜

Went there with friends to have Kabiraji for which it is famous for. Ordered Fish Kabiraji, Chicken Kabiraji and Chicken Cutlet. 
Fish kabiraji just made my evening awesome. 
Though it was little oily, we also didn't get place to sit and so had to stand outside to get sit for 9. but yes, taste of the kabiraji made everything equal. All my anger went back to normal when they served delicious Kabiraji infront of us. 

Service: 3.5/5

Review after a thousand visits to this place. 
This legendary outlet of Mitra cafe is their very first outlet, and have been satisfying people's cravings for ages! 
I absolutely love this place. Their delicacies like brain chop, prawn cutlet, fish fingers, devil, kabiraji and what not. 
We went there pretty late when it was almost about to shut, so we didn't get much of their items available. 
We had chicken kabiraji, egg devil (which has mutton Keema filling), later we had Mutton Dry chaanp, mutton kosha and phulkas. 
Each one of item were lipsmacking! 
Have been visiting since childhood and will keep visiting over and over again!

The legacy of this place is well know to the people of our city. For more than 105 years this place has been serving us with great snacks at pocket friendly rates. I am also one of the people who is a fan of this place and whenever I crave for authentic bengali snacks i visit here. "Fish fry" "Mutton chop" "Diamond kabiraji" "Egg devil" "Prawn cutlet" you name it....this place has everything at more than reasonable rates. Every dish surpasses the other but special mention goes to one dish...the mindblowing "mutton brain chop". Till now I have visited this place 5 to 6 times but had the opportunity to taste this dish once only!!! Actually this dish is very famous and prepared from an entire mutton brain so they can prepare 3 or 4 of these and they get sold out early. So I had to literally book them before hand by calling them and requesting them to keep 2 of these for me. They were kind enough to do that and this is how I managed to get my brain chop! After all the efforts it was worth it...the chop is very filling and it literally melts in your mouth. This place still maintains its legacy but the only issue about this place is the ambience and nothing else.

One of the legendary shops of Kolkata serving delicious snacks. The place is near shovabajar metro. The decor is nothing much and one might even find it shabby. The food though is delicious. Diamond fish kabiraji, egg devil, chicken kabiraji all are fantastic always served hot and crispy. The price is reasonable and actually very cheap. A must visit if you want to have a taste of Kolkata

I visit this place quite often and the reasons being :
1. Pocket friendly place where a minimal amount of 100 rupees is enough to grab something tasty.
2. Authentic bengali styled snacks is what I crave maximum evenings!)
3. This place is just "bepok"!!! (legendary)
Though I have tried almost everything in their menu one item deserves special mention...Mutton Brain Chop!
After failing to have this famous dish a number of times had to literally "book" 3 of these masterpieces at 4pm and they were kind enough to accept my request as we dug through these. Just awesome! They make this from an entire mutton brain and not too everyday so it was  worth the wait! #lovethisplace

Yesterday me & my friend visit the sobhabajar outlet. If you are finding classy ambience this place will not fullfill your hope. This place is too much conjusted. Even you have to share your tables with other people in rush hours. But yes this place is more about legacy. They have only one menu card and yes the combos which have shown in zomato that are not available in this outlet. Anyway we ordered laccha paratha and chicken kosha. We wanted to order two parathas for each but the waiter who was taking our order he suggested to take one. So we listened to him and kind of thankful for that because for a evening snacks if you don't eat alot then one paratha is enough for you. The parathas were well fried and soft those are not at all oily. Chicken kosha was too good. Well cooked chicken with sufficient amount of gravy. This is spicy one but will not burn your mouth. The pieces were big enough for one person.
The staffs are well mannered they will ask you if you need anything.. All over the place is nice the experience was good.
They should increase the place for more seats for the people.

When it comes about Chop, Kabiraji or Catlet these things are I thing in every Bengali’s DNA since their birth and Cha adda with some gormagorom chot or cutlets after the day end is something what an Kolkatian takes it as an emotional. And to serve those fine delicacies to 9 crore Bengali tongues, this place is doing a great job. This is an age old place, situated in the heart of North Kolkata. Just a minute walk from Shovabazar Metro.

This classic restaurant holds a special place in every Bengali's heart and comes in the same sentence as Golbarir Kosha Mangsho, Coffee House er Adda, Dilkhusar Kabiraji Cutlet, Nizam er Kathi Roll... When one eats here, the ecstasy of Bengali culture flows through the veins and one never has troubles in connecting with the legends that ate here...the history which is justified in the first bite of the Brain chop touching the tongue. 

We were famished when we last visited this place and ordered buncha stuffs to calm down the wolves...Brain chops, Mutton Cutlet, Special Fish Diamond Fry, Diamond Kabiraji, Mutton Kosha with Parathas. Every item had freshness written over it and fish items had been cooked to perfection with segments of the fish crumbling in the mouth. Although a bit too oily, the mutton kosha was robust in nature and exploded flavors in the mouth. The famed items gave such satisfaction that I parcelled 4 special diamond fries for my family members. 

Had this restaurant been near my house, I may have frequented this place and not written with such craving and mentioned 'when we last visited'. Here you are not only eating but being a part of history and where some of the classics have tool a turn for the worse, this place triumphs the test of time. 

P.S - We were so hungry that we forgot to take pictures. I'll surely take some the next time.

was too eager to visit this vintage place and got a chance to visit wen had a trip in kolkata.

fish fry- cooked nicely but the outer layer was a bit uncrisp and had to struggle to cut it with fork.and yes the chutney they gave was yumm.

mutton kabiraji-one of the best dishes and yes it blew me away with high expectations. i loved the outer layer hut type of design they give on all kabiraji dishes which is their signature pattern.the mutton inside was super soft and really had a good time having this dish..

chicken pattice- this too was cooked nicely with a crisp outer layered and went really well with the chutney they had given...

mitra cafe had won my heart but here the service problem is there as usual cuz order takers are too busy and do not have time and show a lot of attitude because of the vintage charm of mitra cafe they own.waiters will irritate you but the food wont,,, guys if u r at kolkata plz plz go hee and get the vintage feel of this resto and the old chairs the old walls filled with posters  of bengali superstars and their paper cuttings of their bestest reviews.....

The one place which maintains it's legacy in the truest sense. If you step into that tiny room you are bound to go back years. The food remains authentic, the service as usual, and the crowd enormous as always. We ordered it's famous brain chop, fish fry, chicken kobiraji and cutlet. The brain chop totally lived upto it's expectation. The other items were great too, the kobiraji was a little too thick, so the spices couldn't mix well. Also took a pudding and it tasted good too. Pocket pinch is quite low so Overall good experience.

I visited Mitra Cafe in Shobhabazar this evening. I was a little late, so most of their dishes were over. I ordered mutton kabiraji, chicken breast cutlet and fish chop.
Mutton kabiraji did not have enough minced pieces but the filling was tasty.
Chicken breast cutlet had very good chicken piece but lacked filling so taste wasn't that great.
I liked Fish chop the best. It had ample amount of Fish and filling. Tasted really good. This totally costed me ₹ 280.
It was a street cafe so the ambience was very poor, but its expected. Though I was expected a little better service, I had to ask 3 times before I could get a glass of water. Overall the food was decent but slightly pricy for the place, it kinda lacked the taste you expect from the famous Mitra Cafe. I would rate my overall experience as 3 star.

A legendary place which just sums up the old charm of north kolkata which would resemble you of your nostalgic good days. Mitra cafe would really mesmerise you with the delicious kabirajis,fries & what not.

They have both options of sitting & take away. They open at dot 5pm & the crowd just bustles in for their food even on weekdays. I had the oppurtunity of trying the following delicacies:-

1. Fish kabiraji - Till date my best ever kabiraji experience has been with mitra cafe. Just flawless & full of robust flavours. The egg coating is just marvellous & not soggy with oil,just ideally crisp. The fillet of bhetki which they use is just mouthgasmic to say the least. Salad,boiled potato pieces & a special mustard is provided along with the kabiraji. Highly recommended!!

2. Chicken afghani - A large chicken cutlet dipped & served with rich gravy. The gravy was full of flavours & the chicken cutlet was insanely good. A match made in heaven. Again a recommended dish!!

Price wise this place is sure's a winner. The quality they provide is second to none.

Located very close to the Sovabazar-Sutanuti Metro Station is the original humble establishment of Mitra Cafe.
There is a limited seating arrangement for 12 in the first room,meant for everybody; and an inner air-conditioned room meant for families and accomodating around 10 people.
There are several signature dishes to try out but this time we decided to order the Chicken and Mutton Kabiraji,Fish Chop and Mutton Chop.
One Kabiraji and One Chop for each of us was very filling.
The gentleman we shared our table with,felt let down when the waiter informed him that the reputed "Brain Chop" wasn't available, as its main ingredient hadn't been procured for that day. 
The service was prompt even when it was almost full house and the staff were courteous.
Chicken Kabiraji cost Rs.100 and Mutton Kabiraji cost Rs.110.

It's located near Sovabazar Sutanuti metro station. One of the oldest restaurants​ in Kolkata. It's more than 100 years old restaurant. It's a very small café and you can't get good decor. but there is an AC accommodation also. Now I'm coming to the food. This is the only place in Kolkata where you can get superb brain chops. Extremely great fish diamond kabiraji and chicken kabiraji. Fish afgani Nd mutton Moglai are also two mouth watering items. It's a pocket friendly place and the food is very homely and less spicy.

Food quality is up to the mark and service is good. Brain chop, diamond fish fry, chicken kabiraji, moghlai paratha all are recommended for order.

Went twice in the last 4 days. On the first visit, had mutton cutlets and on the second one had mutton Kabiraji. The cutlets were so-so, not like it used to be for sure. The Kabiraji was quite good, I must admit! But these are old heritage places which although should keep the old nostalgia alive, but also should adapt with time.

It's located near Sovabazar Sutanuti metro station. One of the oldest restaurants​ in Kolkata. It's more than 100 years old restaurant. It's a very small café and you can't get good decor. but there is an AC accommodation also. Now I'm coming to the food. This is the only place in Kolkata where you can get superb brain chops. Extremely great fish diamond kabiraji and chicken kabiraji. Fish afgani Nd mutton Moglai are also two mouth watering items. It's a pocket friendly place and the food is very homely and less spicy.

Mitra cafe is Bengali's pride. This is the perfect place to have fish fry, kabiraji, chicken cutlet, mutton kabiraji etc. The food is good and is really popular. But the sitting space is small and often people have to wait outside, but the food is worth the wait.

Significant drop in food quality over last 2years. When I first visited this place two years ago, I was so impressed with the mutton kabiraji that I decided to revisit this place yesterday but the current quality of mutton kabiraji dissapointed me a lot!

They are just trying to en-cash their long good repulation by opening plenty of branches without giving much importance to food quality. Still the foods are affordable and provides fast service. Bit unhygenic.

Mutton Kabiraji- 3.5/5
Chicken Breast Cutlet- 3.5/5

For Bengalis, the significance of chops, catlets and kabirajis will never be underestimated. And to serve those fine delicacies to 9 crore Bengali tongues, this place is doing a great job. This is an age old place, situated in the heart of North Kolkata. 
Food: Several Bengali fast foods are served here. If you come early(nearly at 5 pm) you may get the most popular dish, Brain chop. But if you are not that lucky, don't worry, they are there to serve you fishfries, fish fingers, chicken kabirajis, catlets and many a things. Quality is awesome, though I think they made fishfry better before. The dishes are a bit overpriced for their tastes.
Place and ambience: That's a big concern, because the place is literally very small in size, with no washroom and only 4 tables to sit. Often you will find the place crowded. People are often lazy and delay for no reasons.

Just visited this legendary place few months back. The place is simple with no fancy waiter. But their food is awesome. They don't charge any VAT/taxes on food which makes it so cheap to eat here. I've tried their famous Fish Diamond Kabiraji & Mutton Brain Chop. Both were superb in taste but the kabiraji was the best. One must try the Kabiraji here. 😋😋

Firstly it seems to be a place which just goes on to run business with its reputation. Extremely unhygienic conditions. Not at all a place to sit and eat. The kitchen looks terrible. Super dirty. Food handlers just keep on walking and talking with no awareness of anything. No proper menu card. I wondered , if the whole walls are filled with pictures of different celebrities - recommending the place and food, why does the management let the place rot ? I felt strange. One time go just for the sake of it is fine. Too shady and out of place. No wifi. No parking. No proper water tumblers. No proper waiters. Actually its just nostalgia maybe that brings in people to eat here.

I’d heard such rave reports of its fries and cutlets that I didn’t miss the opportunity to try them out when I was once in the Sobhabazar area. The place resembled like the many ‘cabins’ and ‘cafes’ of good ol’ Calcutta. But to my dismay, the food left a lot to be desired. I ordered the Mutton cutlet and Chicken ‘kabiraji’ – the latter has assumed legendary status with food aficionados in the city. However, both proved to be major disappointments...they were dripping in grease, and tasted just like those of neighbourhood snacks-bar.

Mitra cafe is the most popular vintage shop in North Kolkata. Recently I have been to the sovabazar Bazaar outlet. It's just opposite to the shobhabazar metro station. It's really difficult to Grab a seat at peak hours cause the outlet is very small.
 I have tried this time the brain chop, kabiraji (for which the Mitra cafe is famous for), fish Afghani. All the dishes were well prepared and delicious. And this cafe is really pocket friendly.

Nothing to involve in a big review section because it beats from all the odds to make the ideal place to enjoy a heritage. The most classy food in the most shabby location but it shows all the more positive side as being an Heritage rather than a struggling food corner. You will enjoy every bits and pieces of the place even if it is pathetic in hygiene , cramped for space and too old to be maintained.

FOOD
Dishes people should try -
Afghani mutton - a spicy , oily and masala engraved with mutton pieces which will make you sweat even under  cooling conditions but it will give you that Afghani favour under it.
4.5/5
Fish Diamond kabiraji - too big to handle for a single person which has a huge kabiraji coating over a moderate thickness of a fresh fish fillet.
4.5/5

HOSPITALITY
Very quick response and polite in every sense although the cramped space do take on their nerves to adjust politely with everyone so feel free to compromise with that.
4.5/5

Mitra café.
The quintessential Bengali and the non resident bengali's are quite familiar with this name.
Because this place has been there since the time our generation was born.

I had recently been to their shobhabazar outlet,which is near to the petrol pump opposite to the sobhabazar metro station.
A small place,with seating arrangement for about 20 people maximum

If you happen to be there at the peak hours,you might find it lil difficult to grab a seat.
This time around,we had ordered for their famous fish kobiraji( The mitra café is famous for it)
And the fish Afgani (This dish comes with a smacking gravy)
Both the dishes had been well prepared and were delicious.

Now coming to the pocket pinch.
It amounted to JUST a mere 180 INR. Which is pretty affordable even for students who run tight on their budget.

This place also features in the legendary outlets.
So a MUST TRY for those looking out for a hint of vintage.

P.S:The brain chop is another dish that I would recommend.

It's bitter to say or even even blasphemous too, that I feel it's over hyped or we ended up visiting it on the wrong day. The place was crowded as usual but the food hurt the most. Maybe due to our huge gastronomical expectations or due to weather conditions we felt the food items were underwhelming. We ordered Chicken kabiraji, fish fry and packed special diamond fish kabirajis for home. The chicken kabiraji was too oily for our taste and tasted funny. Fish fry was OK so was fish kabiraji. Brain chop was not available that day. With

The place is always bustling with people and for good reason. You can't walk past the restaurant without exciting your salivary glands, working up an appetite even on a full belly. 
The all time favorites are undoubtedly mutton braised cutlet, kabiraji of all varieties, fish fry and the surprise package being chocolate pudding. 
The food joint is over a hundred years old and one does not need to look for any other options for some of the tastiest items in the city.

One of the oldest cafe in North Calcutta,  Mitra Cafe features in the legendary outlets collection of Zomato. For a friendly pocket pinch for college students or among office goers who drop in here for a brief session of adda, this place is perfect. Located near the petrol pump at shobhabajar, Mitra cafe upholds the very essence of authentic age old cafes that have been there for a few generations now. Although a bit congested with not enough sitting room, this remains a favourite hanging out spot. We ordered Fish diamond Kabiraji, Fish kabiraji and Choco pudding. The fish kabirajis were nice and the pudding as a dessert was so so. Overall it would be good experience.

First thing we had to do was wait for atleast one and a half hour before getting a table. Well, it's because of the reputation of the place. 

But, was the wait worth it? 

Totally! The items there are delicious and marvelous. You get a feel there that you are sitting and eating at an old and legendary place. It is the original Mitra Cafe and most probably the only one which maintains its iconic reputation.

Mitra Cafe is Kolkata's one of the oldest cafe where you will get the typical flavor of Bengal.

Located in Shova bazar this restaurant is always in rush.

Have tried Laccha paratha and Egg chilli along with their one of the signature dish Fish Fry. Laccha paratha was crunchy and enjoyable,Fish fry was just terrific in taste,one of the best fish fry I have ever tried.It's tantalizing.My friend ordered Mutton Kabiraji,it's over the top according to him.Due to lack of space into our stomach we didn't try the famous brain chops.Will surely try it next time.A highly recommended place.

I am a fan of this place. My original residence is near Shovabazar bazar. I was very much familiar with this place from my childhood. Mitra cafe is a very small stuffy place but food is superb, one of it's kind. Highly priced and unique. This is only one restaurants where you can get brain chop in Kolkata. Yes there are three other branches but you might not get it there very often. All items are good. They also serve chkn stew in a very low price. Founder of the place started to offer this. And they still continue it.

The place itself is very restricted although there is an A.C. section with 2 big tables and few chairs. But to my horror, I spotted little mice at the corner of the room which surely made me lose my appetite!
Now coming to the food, the fish Kabiraji was okay but very oily. We also tried fish batter fry which was absolutely not appealing.
Supposedly, their food quality is degrading now. Need to buck up ASAP.

Mitra Cafe! The famous place for its Fish Diamond Kabiraji! This outlet of Mitra Cafe is very small really small with mx 20 seating capacity! Ordered One Fish Diamond Kabiraji, One Mughlai Chicken, Two Laccha Paratha!

Fish Diamond Kabiraji of Bengali Bhetki! Cripsy and Hot served with Salads and Sauce!
Mughlai Chicken was yummy and spicy as well, red hot chicken pieces with spicy and tasty gravy can blow your mind with some bread!
Laccha Parathas were soft but it could be softer!

The pocket pinch was 350/- which is reasonable! Though my rating 4 goes completely goes for its tasty and yummy foods! Really one of the best places for having some snacks and light meal! Though they need to be more organized and the outlets are congested!

You should reach within 5pm if you want some. Ambience is of that old kolkata steert side restaurants,very very simple. One cannot guess what importance it holds in the area by looking at it. I had chicken cutlet,n it tasted good. This is one of the legendary places,like that of paramount!

I had very few option left to choose as I was late. I have tasted Fish Roll & Chicken Kabiraji.Both these items were too good. I have never tasted fish roll like this before. And chicken kabiraji was so soft and very delicious. Like to go again & again to taste other items.

The food is astoundingly magical to foodies. Many special items of this cafe are simply go out of stock within an hour of opening. Perhaps the only letdown is their tight space which quickly fills up at rush hours!! So book your table as early as possible to enjoy a bite from the 'past'...a taste which will linger in your taste buds for a long long time!
we had taken "chicken kabiraji" and "fish diamond fry" 
.I felt like m in heaven of food , don't judge this place by its ambience . if you are a true foodie just go for it .

I just loved the food , loved the ambience. No this doesnt have a huge space , they dont have suited booted waiters , still u can feel the coffee house kinda age old vibes . 
When I entered there were 3 women having a kitty party , a young couple , few teenagers and a family , yes they have only 6 tables , 2 outside in the open air , 2 inside the a.c chamber where the a.c drips and sprinkles water over the table , you must recall what your teacher said  not food in this case but share your table.
People from every class visit there . Not everyone had a lot of food there , may be they visit regularly but  I was a 1st timer hence I had ' mutton kosha ' with 5 'rotis' , 1 ' fish fry ' , 1' diamond fish kabiraji' and 1 ' dimer devil' . Diamond here resembles a tapered hexagonal shape which is larger than the regular square shape.
Price was just up to the mark , taste is awsome , if you dont get a table buy it n have at the footpath only if you cant wait or have it at home. The best thing which I alway nag about is they do have a swipe machine . They dont serve a huge variety and still they accept card , big restaurants must learn from here . And yes staff were couteous enough ! 
I m surely gonna visit alot here ...

The legendary shop well known for kabirajis and chops can make quite a few changes :
1. Keep hand tissues on the tables
2. Accept cards/PayTM. 
3. Standardize their food portions to that of similar cafes. I found since of them less and some more. 

Their famous brain cbop gets over really early!  We tried mutton kabiraji,  fish diamond cry,  chicken cutlet, devil.  They are good.

One of the treasured possessions of kolkata, this place stands out to be so. They have kept up with their traditional food and service which had been enjoyed by the previous generation. 
I was very excited to try out this place and was not in the least disappointed. 
We had taken a chicken kabiraji,a mutton kabiraji,mutton afghani and chicken cutlet. Every morsel,every bite was absolutely heavenly. 
Would be visiting again to try out the brain chop.  👌😆

Big fan of Mitra cafe!!

I'd suggest their Kabiraji(chicken/mutton, I've never tasted their fish kabiraji).

Fish fry has genuine amount of fish in it, may cost a little bit more than the average street side shop but the quality is worth the price.

Mutton Kassa is always spiced up correctly, and guaranteed tender meat. 

I get my food packed every time, no idea about their dining.

The fish kabiraji and chicken afghani were good but choco pudding was just hopeless... Nothing more than a "Sandesh"... Moreover they were unable to provide us with any veg dish...Therefore I would recommend people specially "vegetarians", don't take this particular outlet... U may visit their outlet in Dumdum

Tried the swiggy combo from Mitra café. It came with a Chicken Kabiraji, a fish chop, a fish fry and a chicken chop. The chicken kabiraji was very oily as usual. The other items were average only. Not something extraordinary. I really have no idea what the hype about Mitra Cafe is all about!

Iconic heritage of Kolkata,located near sova Bazar metro station..this place is very small and opens around 4.30pm everyday,but a queue always forms before it opens,such is the craze which this place still commands ...visiting mitra cafe and not having either the legendary brain chops or the kobiraji or the prawn cutlet should be considered a sin..nothing much to say about the ambience,the service is ok..reasonable prices and great taste along with heritage is the usp of this place

Mitra cafe is an emotion for calcatians.. No matter how old this Cafe is, it has kept its standard to its level best. The best part of this cafe is fishfry, fish/chicken kabiraji, lachha parota and kosha mangshow, brain chop, chicken cutlet and last but not the least the pudding. It has many outlets including shyambazar shovabazar golpark and the newest in golpark.. There are few sitting arrangements in the old outlets. But the food quality is at its best. Always recommend.

Although the first impression from its crampy appearance wouldn't appeal to your appetite, but this food joint offers you some really good Bangaliana fast food. Any dish you pick up is an ambrosial treat to the tongue. Very pocket friendly and average in hospitality, this one is good for a one-time visit.

One of the best among in cities favorite.  Located in north Kolkata, the place has a big name for itself. 

Fish Fry and Mutton Kabiraji is my favorite from the place.  Its delicious, its filling, its fitting.
Where ever you stay in the city the place is worth a visit.

Visited their stall at the Calcutta Classics Food Festival at City Centre today. It was very crowded as Mitra Cafe is a legendary and famous eatery of Kolkata. I had their Fish Kabiraji. It was delightful. Crunchy outer layer with soft fish filling served piping hot to you, it's a bliss. It goes very well with kasundi. I just wish the size was bigger.

Located near the Sovabazar Metro Rail Station this outlet is famous for its chop , cutlet & various other items. Nothing to talk about its ambience , sitting area consists of a few cramped tables & chair. Have been visiting this outlet since my childhood & my favourite is their famous Brain Chop . Kabiraji , devil mutton kasha etc are equally good . They also provide pudding which is good too.

I went to the Shovabazar outlet near the metro station. The Special Fish Kabiraji taste is nothing to brag about. May be once it was great, as I heard from people. Now it is just a waste of money. The Special Fish Kabiraji took 120 rupees, and additionally the waiter also expected a tip for this petty amount. All the time I ate I was trying to imagine it's greatness, but was largely disappointed compared to the craze and hype people have built about it. Nothing so great, you can only go in case you are curious about how a Kabiraji looks or feels like. Don't expect much. Falls into category of restaurants who have a good location on the main road, with a old legacy but no current relevance.

The iconic 97 years old establishment is a part of Calcutta's Food History & Revolution.

They serve basic brakefast in the morning and at the evening  mouthwatering chop & cutlets.

Every time I visit 3 things that I order are Fish Afgani(Fish Cutlet served in a rich gravy best accompanied with lacha paratha) and Fish Chop and Fish Kabiraji but make sure u visit early otherwise u might have to return being disappointed... 

Mitra cafe is a Institutions for Foody Calcuttans..

Dishes u should try 
1.Fish Afgani
2.Fish Chop
3.Fish Kabiraji
4.Diamond Fry
5.Prawn Cutlet

This is a very very average eatout by Kolkata standards ...I am using the word "Kolkata" standards
The kobiraji was good..Batter fry was okish...Fish fry was also good...
There's something called as mutton fry ,which is mutton dipped in batter and deep fried ...This had absolutely no spice at all...Ordinary telebhaja types with mutton replacing the aloo...Not at all good,.
We also couldn't control our temptation of a steamy plate of mutton curry on the next table and asked them (like a true bong) on how the dish tasted. They nodded their heads in approval and vouched that it was better than golbari. However the taste was sweetish and very strange of Bengali mutton curry...The quality of the meat was good ...But despite me being a ghoti the sweetness was a bit too much to handle
Overall verdict : you can find this food almost at every third roadside eatery in Kolkata ...Definitely not worth travelling long distances for (we travelled from Tollygunge) ...
They go really easily on oil though.. so you won't have a bad tummy for sure ...Anyways bongs are born with intestines of steel...
Beware of the sweet kashundi they serve with the kabiraji .....One is slightly lightish in colour ...Which is sweet and hence dreadful....

Mitra Cafe is an old and famous cafe, located at Shovabazar, which serves various kinds of fast food at an affordable rate .

Ambience is nice with a vintage look and has sitting arrangements.

Staffs are cordial with quick service despite of huge rush.

Tried their fish fry , chicken kobiraji and mixed noodles. All were well cooked, fresh and yummy. Fish fry was soft inside with crispy outside, served with mustard sauce. Mixed noodles had generous fillings and was good. Kobiraji was also well cooked and was delicious.

A must try place for snacks.

Mitra Cafe one of the vintage restaurant in North Kolkata. It is a very small restaurant.The taste of their cullets are really yummy. You must hit the shop for its famous dish- fish kabiraji, prawn cutlet and mutton kabiraji. The seating arrangement is small, so it is difficult for getting a seat here during peak hours. So the best option is take away. Very much pocket friendly but the ambiance is not that god. But highly recommended for the quality of food they offer.

Its not the food only but the people too . The staff being patient to give their byte even on a busy evening.

Easy to locate outlet with sovabazar metro gate no. 1 within few minutes walk has minimum space for their food lovers. If you like to have a great ambiance while you eat then this is not the place you want to visit. But when it comes to food its beyond expectations. Adding more to this, one has to wait for a good 15 20 mins for a seat.
Coming to food its was amazing experience. If you are fried item lover this mitra cafe can be best for evening snacks. They also serve breakfast as well. We ordered diamond cutlet (mutton) diamond cutlet (chicken) and mutton cutlet . Chicken diamond cutlet was just worth to have.
Recommended chicken diamond cuttlet

I have had fish fry from Mitra Cafe before and it was pretty good.
Three of us visited the place for the first time yesterday- We ordered Brain Chop, the Special Diamond Fry and a Chicken Cutlet. 
The brain chop was alright.
The chicken cutlet was average, and the special fry costing a 100 bucks was just terrible!
The smell of the fish was outrageous! 
And i don't see the point of naming it 'diamond' fry if it isn't diamond shaped in the least.
The only thing i would like to say about this place is: OVERRATED. Period.
Frankly, disappointed.

The people here are helpful always smiling

Its a very small place just near the sovabajar metro station. As you enter you can see many pictures of famous personalities visiting this place. People usually queue up in front of the table to get a seat.
Tried their fish diamond kabiraji and that was good. Egg mutton devil was the perfect egg devil I longed for.. But I couldn't finish their brain chop. I felt it very yeaakky!! Also tried bread pudding, it was so so.
If you are a foodie you can visit this place to explore old Calcutta cuisine.

During my recent visit the place being too small was very crowded.... but the manaegment were very fast and we did not have to wait for very long to get a seat. 

We ordered the Special Fish Diamond Fry, Chicken Breast Cutlet and one Chicken Kabiraji. All the food was great. Specially liked the fish diamond fry.

I gave a 4.0 which could be 5.0 if I could find the Brain Chop. It has been the main attraction for me and this is what has became rarely available nowadays. Though rest of the items are quite good as well and I still like the way still serve the salad in age old fashion. It is a very nostalgic place and more you know about various story on many famous celebrity who were fond of the tasty snack from Mitra Cafe, more you feel the nostalgia of the place. I'll surely visit again if I am around there during their operational hour.

Went on 10th October, 2016, On maha ashtomi, for the Nth time. Does this place need a review? anyways. We had, Mutton biryani, Mutton kosha, Lachha parota, Diamond kobiraji and salad.
Except the mutton kosha others were awesome, fantastic, terrific.
That Kobiraji is the best kobiraji I had in this year I guess. No one can match their taste.
The Mutton kosha could have been a bit tender. 
The have huge space constraint. But, they optmized their space so well, the staff were very warm and coordinated with us very nicely. The price is damn cheap.
I love this place, will visit again. Keep rocking. 
A place for the lover of food, for the bangaali's.

Finally!! After a number of planning and cancellation I have experienced the taste. The taste of fish. I felt the taste of Bengal is still same over the last 100 years. Being one of the oldest cafe Mitras have wrote their name on a golden milestone and trust me its worth. As i have visited in the time of Durga puja so it was a large queue where i had to stand, but when I got my first byte it was like heaven. I always run behind the speciality and i got it. The place is a bit small, but the management is good and serves fast and their attitude to the customers is awesome. I ll give another time to taste their special afghani mutton.

Had diamond kabiraji (difference between fish kabiraji and diamond kabiraji is just of size) fish fry and chicken cutlet. Each of them were just too good. But I didn't expect that they won't have fish butter fry :-/ you have to wait outside in queue no matter at what time you go. Interior is pretty old and need a makeover.

Well,so I finally I visited this legendary place....situated at a 2-3minutes distance from sovabajar metro station. You can ask anyone there about the location and you will easily be able to reach at mitra cafe. 🤗

It's a little cafe with congested sitting arrangements with wooden chair-tables. We were just 30minutes late till opening of the cafe in the afternoon...and they were out of seats. So we had to wait for few minutes outside. There is also takeaway option if you want. 

The person at the counter was very friendly..so as the waiters. Nothing fancy to say about the decor..it was just ordinary.

Now comes the main part,the food.
We wanted to have their famous brain chops,but they were out of those. 😑
So ordered Chicken Kabiraji,mutton breast cutlet and fish fry. And one choco pudding lastly. 🤗
The food was served within 10minutes and I just dig in.

The Chicken Kabiraji was a huuuggeee one.😄 Served with salad,boiled potatoes....(served maybe to balance the spicy taste) and one chutney. The kabiraji was smoking hot..wrapped all over with egg. Crispy outside and juicy inside. The chicken was quite thick in portion and tasteful. A pure bliss to chicken lovers like me.😇. I didn't like the chutney though... don't knw what was it. 🙁

The fish fry was another treat to us. Had the perfect texture and the smell was amazing. Served with the same salad,potatoes and chutney. It tasted good too.

Now comes the mutton breast cutlet...now for me..Mutton is mutton.😇.the ultimate goal for me. 😝 It was a bit less in thickness than the kabiraji...but the taste was just perfect..spicy,flavourful and cooked perfectly. 😃 Loved it. 😁

Lastly comes the choco pudding..the size was not satisfying though according to the price. But it tasted good.. served with chocolate sos on top. A good sweet plate to end our meal. 🤗

The bill came worth 290...😄 So a great experience for me as my first visit here. I'll highly recommend this place.

This is one of the famed melting pot of cultural icons in Kolkata ,  North Kolkata to be precise. You cannot miss it , very conveniently located on the main road. The settings are not of a modern cafe but that must not stop one from trying the irresistible Mutton , Chicken , Fish "Kabiraji" , Fish Fry , Fish Finger , Chicken Cutlet , Fish Cutlet rule the roost here. Mustard sauce prepared the authentic Bangla way and called kasundi is the accompaniment for all preparations , will leave you asking for more. Just try once and you will never forget.

Open after 4:30 pm. Fish finger is highly recommended. Tried fish kobirazi ( speciality known for)but it test average. Hand made Kasundi sauce is very mild in flavor and not compatible with onion salad. Very easy to locate this 100 year old cafe.

Nothing to say much as, most people already probably know everything. For those who don't, try out the chicken breast cutlet, the macher chop. And obviously, pathar brainer chop, try to make it there early, they run out of this item extremely fast!
I would suggest, taking the food home or ordering it from swiggy, as sitting there and eating is not comfortable!

Then after we came baruas first food which is located gourimata sarani. We have teasted fish fry, chicken fry, pantharas , fish roll all are upto the mark price was also reasonable. So my experience with Mitra cafe was not good. I can't give Mitra cafe more 2.5

Have been eating at this place for the past 15-20years now. What upsets me is that the taste and quality aren't the same anymore. It has been deteriorating with time. 

PROS 
Typical Calcutta breakfast. An experience for sure. 
Amazing evening snacks. 


CONS
Deteriorating quality. 
Small joint. 
If a vegetarian you have limited options. 

Hope the owners take a note of this and correct before doomsday hits them.

A classic Calcutta restaurant.

After going through most of the 'legendary' eateries in kolkata, i was under the impression that all of them are over hyped. Well but this place turned out to be an exception. Decor and atmosphere still preserves the charm of Calcutta and the Mutton kabiraji and brain chop we tried were brilliant. Never imagined a kabiraji can actually be this good.

Being a Bengali and never been to mitra cafe is kinda odd..... though I have had their food at the food festival in city centre but going to the place itself is always diff.....
The shop opened a lil after 4:30 and we were actually 10 mins early waiting for them to open ....lol
Ordered chicken kobiraji and fish fry.....both were yum.....kobiraji was excellent with the crispy outer layer of egg coating and well cooked chicken inside.....they gave a chutney which I didn't like..... I asked them for tomato sauce....the manager was polite and offered me kasundi ( mustard sauce) without which any fish fry is incomplete......
The wall had pictures of celebrities who visited . The siting place is small though.....
Yes one more thing....i am not very fond of mutton but with the 20 mins the shop opened there was numerous orders of brain chop......I am gonna surely try it next time . 
Yes I am going there again soon .

The place has become a brand, however the food quality has come down from what it was at one time. The people managing the place is clueless as to how to deal when there is a surge of customers, also the food which was supposed to be more spicy and hot is not so hot anymore. the taste has become more tamed. But still it is one of the best places to have a quick evening snack.

This is the head shop, all branches are supplied from here.
Must try is brain chop, kobiraji, cutlet and moghlai.
All other items are pocket friendly and awsome to taste at the same time.
Highly recommended!

My first visit was with dad way back in  95. Visited recently and the place still holds it's legacy. The sitting might not be posh, but it has a certain element of nostalgia attached to it. Ordered the legacy dishes, brqin chop,chicken kabiraji, fish diamond fry and prawn cutlet. The taste hasn't changed over the years. The price is quite low. I have nothing more to say about the quality, the long queues speak about it. But my fav are chicken kabiraji and prawn cutlet.

The outlet at Shovabazar is the oldest one dates back to 1910 or so. The other outlets are coming up and they are maintaining the quality. I am eating in this place for the last 25 years. The place is bit shabby but holds a heritage feeling . The location is very good right near the Metro station. One of the item that was very popular was "tush" which is nothing but stew in colloquial term. The stew was priced at Rs 2/- and was served in a glass . This was one of the attraction. The other attractions are the cutlets and the fries. They taste really good. 
The Chicken kabiraji is very heavy with decent amount of meat in it and its tasty too. I have taken almost all the items and as per my taste buds the fish preparation is better than the chicken ones. What I didnt like is the high oil content and the plates and saucers used for serving are not upto the mark. The USP of the shop is its old and heritage look. If any body dont like the way the seats are arranged and the messy surrounding could prefer for a take away.

It's good indeed. Filled with oodles of that old world charm.
Had mutton Afghani which tasted splendid.
The fish kabiraji was good but not as great as the reviews promised it to be.
The chicken do piyaza was so-so.... with its heavy n oily curry spoiling the experience a bit.
The lachha paratha was too stiff and a bit weird in taste.
Didn't try their signature dish 'Fish Fry' n 'Brain Chop'
But then there's always a next time isn't it?

Sorry to say this, but according to my 'taste' it is a bit overhyped. The 'brain chop' thingy holds it in an enigmatic pedestal for sure. However, apart from that I feel that the place really needs to shake things up a bit. I visited it recently on a weekday and as soon as I entered the tiny outlet I was welcomed by nostagia and a quintessential bongness.

The guy sitting at the counter answered to my query with a smile of pride "Brain Chop sesh hoye geche"... a line that he has championed with time.So I had to settle for something else and I ordered a mutton chop and a fish kabiraji.

The mutton chop was nice and it had a very 'parar dokan-er chop' taste with the roasted cashew nuts and ginger playing their parts well. However the kabiraji turned out to be a big disaster. The outer crust (the bird's nest kind of thing) tasted bad with capital B, and it was never ending. The real crux was lost inside and did not taste that well either.
The sauce that they provided in a paper cup tasted fresh and sweet, which salvaged the situation.
The place is small with smaller chairs, which is why take-home is a better option.

Location: Just right at the Sovabajar 4 way crossing.

It fulfills all the criteria of a Heritage Calcuttan Cafe/restro:

small space: check
no-Ac : check
have to share tables with strangers: check

Service was prompt.

We ordered :
Chicken kobiraji and 2 fish fries.

both of these dishes were served with salad( cucumber,onions,beet,carrot) and a yellow sauce.

The Kobiraji had generous amount of chicken and was well coated with the egg mesh.

 The fish fry was crispy and had thin coating. The 'bekti' fish was perfectly flaky and was of good quality.

Wanted to try Diamond fry and Brain chop but couldn't due to unavailability!

Diagonally opposite to shovabazar metro station, this is one of the oldest restaurants in North Kolkata Sutanuti area...you get the charm of old Calcutta once you enter the small restaurant. 

Best to order Diamond Fish Fry, Chicken Kobiraji and Chicken Stew(Special).

The price is pocket friendly and quantity is just enough to serve your hungry tummy.
Visit during 4 p.m. as you can always take a Fish fry as a parcel and enjoy the launch ride at Bagbazar ghat...which is just an auto ride from shovabazar.

Well this is a classic here , thronged even by the celebrities from time to time. Very small eating place with no decor or ambiance and a very dirty looking kitchen and cramped us spaces where you share the table with others. But the cutlet and chops , the kabirajis and stew makes up for everything. Have the brain chop and fish kabirajis. And reach early . Their signature dishes are over by 8 almost everyday.

Located just opposite Shovabazar Metro Station, this is perhaps the busiest and sought-after place in North Kolkata for great street food. This place has been serving legends over the year- from Uttam Kumar, Satyajit Ray to Anjan Dutta in the recent times. When you enter the almost always crowded outlet, you see a television where they air a video about their glorious past and also share a few recipes.

The quality of food is no longer what it used to be when I was a kid but it still is the best in class in this area. To enjoy the widest choice in menu you should visit by 4-5pm, after which most of the items are sold out. Their fish fry, kobiraji and cutlets are delicious. To avoid the rush most people prefer take-aways instead of sitting there for a meal. 

The food is great, the place is clean (although crowded and can be somewhat suffocating) and staff behaviour is fine. So if you are ever at Shovabazar do not forget to check out this famous place.

A legendary eatery that is famous for its fried items. It is just very near to the sovabazaar metro station and serves the best fried food that you can lay your hands on. 
------
Since it's near my house i have been to this place countless times and had almost all the items they offer. So I am going to mention a few of my favorite things that have prompted me to go there again and again.
     The fish fry is pretty good, you get fresh fish inside and the coating outside is just of the correct proportion not too thick, otherwise it would overpower the flavour of the fish. The "fish kabiraji' is good but a bit oily and the crust is crunchy because of the egg batter they use. But the most brilliant item ia the fish pakora with chunks of fresh fish inside and crispy batter on the outside. The fish is soo fresh that you might find a bit sweet, so they use a bit of tanginess to balance the sweetness. Do try the brain chop, because it's famous here.
------
Do give this place a try and fall in love with fried food all over again.
Cheers!! 🍻

Mitra Cafe is an institution. It's the progeny of a long culture of snack serving cabins of North Kolkata. They have a great reputation and an immense heritage tag. I personally adore their kobirajis, cutlets, fries and especially the "brain chop". Though I'll say their quality has been on the decline and they're falling short of their expectations, but still they churn out whopping sales and their cashboxes jingle like temple bells during the evening snacktime. Mitra Cafe continues to attract the young and old and still generation after generation, they hold a consistent clientele.

Their fried snacks are quite well known and most of then are excellent. I am particularly fond of their mutton cutlet. The fish fry is also pretty good. I tried the egg devil and the fish chop once, but did not like them much. I am yet to try their famous brain chop.

No words ...........only Kabiraji!!
The food here is great and the number of people they serve is amazing. Their seating is tooo small.. ..but the way they have decorated the place with all the photos of renowned people who came here shows the greatness of this little shop.

The place is too cramped specially its dinning area. If you are visiting for parcel then this is a good place as their delivery service is quite fast but to dine you have to wait for a long time.
Me and my friends were not that tired from all the hiking we did which we suffered from waiting in the queue for the food.
Dining area is too small, don't know how anyone can enjoy their food in there. 
Price is pocket friendly.

It's definitely been a heritage food junction in Kolkata. Price value is pretty much justified with food quality. Food items are unique and meant to be bought from here only. Little restaurant with some well behaved stuffs along with numerous published feedback in various news paper will fetch you there again and again.

Its a famous name of Kolkata...found in numerous bengali story books and movies for really long time. Its always crowded with people..but serves real good bengali snacks. They provide the best chicken afgani, fish fry and spring roll in the city which are tops mine favourites list. But I have heard from my grandpa that they are famous for selling delicious brain chop.

Mitra cafe is a legendary eating place . The name is not new to food enthusiasts of Kolkata . A place that goes with the tagline "Bhalo khaan.. o khawan " , it has a been a memorable place for generations . They are serving food for 100 years , and that has passed from our fathers to us and will surely continue . 

The founder himself believed in the fact that good times are made by good food . In the beginning the could served very less quantity of food but they focussed a lot on quantity . They have named it " Mitra " , as they believe every customer is their friend and when a friend comes to them hungry, it is their duty to serve them with a proper meal .Henceforth , for years they have served us chops , cutlets , kabiraji and everyday they have excelled in their standards . 

The cafe is located just in the lane  opposite to Sovabajar Sutanuti metro station .

The place is always crowded but the peak timing is from 4 pm - 5 pm when their legendary brain chop gets sold and mind you their stock is over in minutes . I have not been able to get a taste of the legendary " Brain chop " till date since I never managed to get in that early . But this is something i am still keeping in my bucket list because i know I am gonna visit the place again and again .

My personal favourite includes the following :-

1. Fish Fry ( 4 / 5 ) :- Not the best in the city , but still the right one to satisfy your taste buds . Priced at 65, this is a generously sized fish fry served with salad and white kasundi .

2. Fish Kabiraji ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- The biggie . You will see hundreds of people coming in and ordering the fish Kabiraji . Its legendary out here . Cooked with generous amount of fish , this goes so well with the white kasundi . This is one of the heritage dishes of the city , the " Fish Kabiraji " from Mitra Cafe .

3. Chicken Afghani ( 4 / 5 ) :- one of my selections . This is a big piece of chicken cutlets cooked in gravy and served with salad and roti . You can choice toast or parotha instead of the roti but i personally prefer the roti because the afghani itself is very heavy but really tasty . Something , that will linger in your taste bud for a long time .

4. Chicken fry ( 4 / 5 ) :- Forget KFC , this plate has 6 pieces of chicken cooked in pakora style and is far better tasty and cheap than the fried chicken you get at any other outlets . Priced at 120 rupees , this dish is a winner . All the chicken pieces are meaty and is sufficient for 2 people .

Their creamy white kasundi is something you will never get anywhere else , and trust me this is the best sauce that i have had with snacks such as those mentioned above .Somehow the white kasundi compliments the best with the chop and cutlets .

With the crazy number of people coming in all the time the space is a factor since the cafe is very small . It has a capacity of around 25 people with generous staff . The service is really fast and the food is served hot . This is the baap of all snack joints and a holy temple for the foodies . Inviting those who still have not managed a visit to come and experience real good food with and old charm factor in it .
Will go there again and again whenever the situation permits .

one of the heritage hangouts for evening snacks. a small place to grab the special bong style frys. THE best outlet to dine in or take away among all the mitra cafe outlets in kolkata. a must try food joint. I have been there for several times with my friends and parents. the enigmatic CHOP-CUTLETS to have.  almost all the items(chop n katlets) I have tried over there. never disappointed. the best fried snacks in kolkata I have tasted. boiled salted aloo in salad and the delicious mustard raita are the individuality of the place. the chicken soup before the fried foods will let u feel  awesome.. every time a hang out with friends in north kolkata I try not to miss this place.
few of the items if u want me to suggest u to try : 
mutton breaSt cutlet, VEGETABLE CHOP, PRAWN AFGANI, MUTTON MUGLAI, FISH KABIRAJI, BREAD TOAST, AUTHENTIC FISH FRY......

Most visited food joint for me. Very small in size. An 105 years old legendary cafe near the Sovabazar – Central Avenue crossing, with the Sovabazar Metro Station within a stone's throw. This north Kolkata cafe was once a regular stop for many renowned celebrities. From Uttam Kumarto Anjan Dutta to Bratya Basu, this place has welcomed a lot of Stars. Therefore, it is a great old world charm in old kolkata.

The typical style of 'chop cutlet' placed with the old marble top tables and jaded plates and cutlery. Amongst the variety of special items, some renowned items are Mutton Chop, Brain Chop, Mutton Cutlet, Mutton Curry, Mutton Kasha, Mutton Moglai, Dry Mutton Chop, Dry and Gravy Mutton Moglai Do-peaji, Kabiraji and Afghanis.

The food is astoundingly magical to foodies. Many special items of this cafe are simply go out of stock within an hour of opening. Perhaps the only letdown is their tight space which quickly fills up at rush hours!! So book your table as early as possible to enjoy a bite from the 'past'...a taste which will linger in your taste buds for a long long time!

This restaurant aptly features in the Legendary Restaurants section. Located at the heart of Sovabazar, this place is a hit among the traditional people of Kolkata. Had been there a couple of times with my friends. The outlet is very small and has an even smaller AC dining area. The tables are on a shared basis and people does not care to share as all they go there for is to experience their culinary excellence.
My recommendations among their menu are Fish fry, Fish Kabiraji, Mutton Kasa with Paratha and Chocolate Pudding. The first two is what the restaurant is famous for, so wont speak much about it. You have to go there to feel them. Coming to Mutton Kasa and Paratha, I did not have my hopes too high but to my surprise, they were just awesome and are definitely something I would have in my memories for quite a long time. The Chocolate pudding is another hit here and is made to perfection. Less sweet and has that eggy feel over it, the pudding gives a perfect ending to one of the best mini meals that you will ever have !
All in all, I would definitely urge all the foodies to experience this heritage of Kolkata atleast once.

With all the lip smacking affair starts a bit lately in the evening, mitra cafe is a super busy joint you can think of. Often mistaken as a "parar-dokan" (neighborhood shop) of north Calcutta by the looks, it treats you with probably the best chicken kabiraji of the town. Perfect crisp egg crust. Neither underdone nor overfried. Another interesting pick from their menu being the afghani... the mutton variant. It is best if accompanied with bread. Their laccha parantha is deep fried and eventually is  too crisp which is the only thing I didn't like. Otherwise it is as perfect as it was during my college days.

What more does a Bangali need when he has a plate full of Kabiraji and cutlet in front of him? The answer is, a cup of "Gorom Cha" and nothing else. He can forget the world dashing by him and settle into the holy enclosure of his gluttony. You might feel the same when you walk into Mitra Cafe. 

The place works like a machine. You see plate after plate of hot piping fries leaving the kitchen on white plates, teamed with kasundi, and a loose salad. My father always brought home, huge brown packets filled with different varieties of fries from Mitra Cafe whenever he crossed the outlet. Once everything was served, everyone in the family would sit down at the table and gorge on the items without a word. It was only after a "Chumuk" at their beloved cups of evening tea, did the satisfied "Aaaahh" leave their lips. 

"Some" of my favorite items from Mitra Cafe, include- the egg mutton devil, prawn cutlet, Chicken/ Chicken breast cutlet, chicken roast, fish finger/pakora, mutton moghlai, moghlai paratha, fish roll afgani and a lot more.

Imagine, an English bard, walking out of a dingy outlet, crammed with tables, in a daze. And then in a moment of literary frenzy, jots down the following, "If food be the music of life, eat on." Now imagine such a dingy crammed place exists for if you do, you are surely at the Shobhazar - Central Avenue crossing, facing an institution as old as the city's gastronomic pursuit. Mitra Cafe or as I call it, "The Hogwarth's School of magical potions."  With the kosha mangsho hitting your taste buds and the fish kobiraji's ecstatic eccentricities ensuring you find heaven, Mitra Cafe is where I wish to have my last supper. I might sound patronising and bloody hell I am, this joint has been serving soul food for almost  close to a century now. Founded in 1920, the Bengali's perennial huger pangs have been satiated with a barrage of fish cutlets, fish diamond cut, the humongous portions of chicken stew and of course the stunning kosha mangsho with laccha parstha or bread. For the sweet tooth, the chocolate pudding is a perfect way to end a journey. For that is what I call my time spent at the café. Every time. The staff is helpful and the walls adorn the fame this outlet has always garnered. The history of the cafe is printed at the backside of the menu. 
Mitra Cafe will exist for as long as the  quintessential Bengali will throng it's hallowed portal. And that is probably, forever.

Visited this eatery a few days ago with lots of expectations. Thankfully, it lived upto all of them. We had ordered Mutton Breast Cutlet, Diamond Kabiraji, Mutton Brain Chop and Choco Pudding.  Needless to say, each and every one of them was delicious. An extra point for the Brain Chop. We couldn't stop ourselves from gobbling down the food totally forgetting about clicking a pic, hence a seemingly disorganised pic. In addition to that, though the place was small, it was clean and service was prompt. Hope to visit again to try out the Mutton Kabiraji. 
P.S. To locate this place, one will have to exit from Gate1 of Sobhabajar Metro Station.

Taste, yumminess and crispness defines the food @MitraCafe. Be it Chicken Kabiraji or the Bhetki Diamond Fry or the spicy Afghani Mutton with Lacchas; all have their unique  taste and awesomeness. Readily served hot with salad and mustard sauce.

Ambiance might deduct a point or two, else this fast food corner sells one of the best finger-licking items, one has ever had. A must visit place!!

I had ordered chicken cutlet, fish pakoda, fish kabiraji, fish cutlet, fish fry and fish chops out of which all the fish items tasted good and fresh, their fish fry and cutlet being the best. Small space but easy to locate. Every time I pass through this place, the to-die-for aroma tickles my tastebuds(even when I pass by car or bus). :)

Located in a nice locality but the interior is too clumsy, yet clean. You often end up sharing your table with another family due to lack of space, this is somewhat odd. Regarding food I felt its over hyped because out of 4 preparation which I ordered (diamond kabiraji, chicken breast cutlet, fish fry and fish chop), I liked only fish chop. Others are very ordinary. May be its the fame of the yesteryear which is helping the cabin to run. Will visit once though to try the chicken afgani, saw many people trying that. 
The only thing which I liked most was the presentation- boiled potatoes, fresh salad with an in-house mayonese type sauce.

The space inside the cafe is very small and cluttered. Food is quite good though. The kabiraji is perfect. Chicken Afghani is awesome. The dry mutton chap with gravy is a showstopper. Crispy golden parathas are wonderful sides. The CHOCO Pudding is also very yummy and is the perfect end to a meal at Mitra Cafe. Service is good.

The space inside the cafe is very small and cluttered. Food is quite good though. The kabiraji is perfect. Chicken Afghani is awesome. The dry mutton chap with gravy is a showstopper. Crispy golden parathas are wonderful sides. The CHOCO Pudding is also very yummy and is the perfect end to a meal at Mitra Cafe. Service is good.

I've always been a fan of this heritage eat out! The vegetable chop and the fish cutlet are a must try. They also make very good chicken cutlets, diamond chops as well. The perfect time to go there is before 7pm coz after that there's hardly any stuffs left, yes they are that popular! A must try on list on every foodies wish list!

Walls adorning different pictures of the cooks and old newspapers. The place full of office goers returning  after a long days work enjoying some "chop-cutlet"  infuses that bengali feel. They are also famous for the brain chop which is rumoured to be sold out even before the restaurant opens. The fish fries and cutlets are good.  They are also famous for afghani cutlet which is a gravy dish. Overall a place for fried food lovers.

Procrastinator's review 006
What separates good cafe from the great? It's the ability to maintain the quality with quantity. (This is where Bar-B-Q, often lets us down- refer to the review). 
This Saraswati puja, my chums and me raided the cafe and to after a tantalising 25 minutes of waiting in the curb, we were greeted by the o-so-familiar sight and smell of "fish kabiraji". Optimistic all we took the first bite and lo we were taken to the serenade with the pristine product. Quantity delivered without any compromise in quality. Ladies and gents I give you a century of untarnished image. Mitra Cafe. Bon appetite...

Mitra cafe also know as the favourite fast food centre of Kolkata, the shop have great history and many celebrities craves for their cutlets chops and fries. They are famous for the brain chops , fish fry , pudding and the sauce which they serve with the chops. Despite being one of the largest and popular fast food chains in Kolkata the space of the shop is small and also untidy.. but their service and food quality is one of the best in town. A great place for college students and must for the foodies in town.

Chicken kabiraji, fish kobiraji, mutton cutlt is must try.. It is dat good

And trust me telebhaja can b that hygienic :)

Now after all this we have.. The surprise came when I went to pay d bill... It is very pocket friendly trust me.. It cost 275 RS per head... Must try :)

One of the oldest and famous cafe in North kolkata! Maintaining same quality of food for decades. But my favourite BRAIN CHOP is sold out very quickly , for my experience I had to wait from 4 o'clock to open the cafe to get that and it's sold out by half n hour as every customers were asking for it. Please try Brain chop once, I'm sure you're going to like it. Try your luck ;)

Traditionally one of the best and the cheapest food join in the city,never looses its charm when it comes to kabiraji's to fish fry to kasa mangsho (chicken).. This probably their oldest joints in kolkata,a quite petite place,nothing fancy,with a small seating arrangement,but really well behaved staffs,the service is faster,I have tasted their diamond kabiraji,fish fry,fish kabiraji,parantha's and chicken curry(kasa mangsho)... They are all equally tasty but kabiraji is a must try...

If u love big DIAMOND FISH FRY in any bong restaurant, then plz try out THAT VERY FISH FRY in this snacks outlet....ITZ JUST AMAZING....AWESOME in taste.
It's one of the oldest snacks counter (more than 115 years older) at the heart of kolkata, just opposite of shovabazar metro station.
Don't go for ambience cz its a very small,little dirty and narrow spaced outlet as it is located on the big dusty and very busy road of central avenue (may u feel very uncomfortable sitting out and eat). So ambience wise 1 on 10.
But big foodie as me doesn't look ambience. Once you taste their HOT AND CRISPY DIAMOND FISH FRY, YOU WILL FEEL THE HEAVENLY TASTE @rs 90 only. And not only fish fry,they have different kind of snacks items.... fish kaviraji, fish chop, mutton breast cutlet, chicken cutlets, egg devil and many more and all are lip smacking. So taste wist I would like to rate them 10 on 10.
Lots of celebrities, tollywood actors and actresses often visit this outlet, even our state ministers. They have all their pictures hanging on the walls.
So visit once,try their chops and cutlets and durely fish fry. But remember 1 thing. Eat those foods hot (তেল এ কড়া করে গরম গরম ভাজা). Really you ll love it.@ priyabrata ganguly

I never eat brain chop in my life and that is one of their famous item so ordered one...but the waiter said all snacks are available in the evening and in the morning they only have toasts n omelettes n pouches...I was so disheartened then...as I had sat there so wanted to eat something so ate butter toast n pouch....may be next time if I have time in the evening I shall go for their fried items...

This was a huge disappointment considering the fact that we had heard so much about the place, and it's delicacies.
As we entered the place the ambience was surely low-graded, which in fact raised our expectations because you know the food is gonna be good when the ambience has been compromised,but all expectations went down the drain.
We ordered the chicken kabiraji. All we had to eat was a thick crispy tasteless coating of something we had no idea of and of course the chicken underneath. We had a hard time finishing the dish.
I don't know why the place has such high ratings.

A shabby little cafe with a legacy which goes back generations! Situated in a very oppurtunistic location, opposite to the Aurobindo Sarani gate of Sobhabazar Metro station, this place is a delight. The fish kabiraji tasted remarkably well. At Rs 80, it was worth it. The small spacing may be a problem for people who prefer their privacy.

Interiors and ambiance was never among strong points of the tiny outlet near Sovabajar Metro Station, but the food is still delicious. We went for the egg devil, which is half egg and half meat and it is a must try. Followed by that we had fish diamond kabiraji. It tasted out of the world but if you do not like too much oily food, you should not go for this. The mustard sauce that they serve along with the fried items perfectly complements the dishes. After that we ate the mutton mughlai do piaza. The gravy tasted heavenly and the meat was absolutely tender. The pudding wasn't that great a hit. But this is among the heritage eateries of Kolkata and everyone must try this place out at least once.

It really pains me to give such low ratings to this legendary joint,but based on the last two occasions that I tried them,taste wise,it has gone down the drains.

The special fish kabiraji,suggested by them,was bland,underseasoned,and quite tasteless.the fish quality was good,but after a few bites you dont feel like eating a chunk of flavourless deep fried stuff.

The dahi chicken and special fish afghani were sheer disaster. the chicken gravy was sweeter than rasgulla. we suspected it had been made with sweet curd. we hate wasting food.but could not finish this dish.
The fry of the afghani was tasteless to the core,the coating thick.,and as we suspected,made of bread.the Fish layer in between was thin and again,underseasoned.
The gravy was extremely oily,with srong smell of raw garlic.yuck.

Not visiting again.sorry

It is a very cozy old school eatery. Muglai fast food is their speciality. However I did not get my beloved egg devils. We had afgani chicken which was dark and sweet and was apparently their most spicy dish according to the waiter! We had chicken, mutton and fish cutlet which were nothing special. We had fish kobiraji which was rather nice. The verdict is if you are feeling fast food and want it cheap you should consider this place. But then again in Kolkata most fast food is cheap. I would say its the media coverage which has added to its hype rather than just great food.

But sadly since it's nearest outlet is almost 9-10 kms, but I still try to drop by at that place to have some of those on their menu. IMHO their preparation is better compared to Campari, gariahat or bijoli grill, hazra

This place is the Holy Grail of Snack food in Kolkata. It will be very difficult to find a senior citizen in Kolkata who has not tasted the Cutlets, Chops, Kabiraji, Stew, Fish Fries here. You will be left asking for more. I remember that when I was young & passed in front of this place, the smell coming from inside was irresistible. The place almost remains jam packed & it had changed very little over the years. I believe Mitra Cafe is one of the iconic street food joints in Kolkata.

Having heard so much of this evergreen joint, we just had to pay it a visit. Even if it meant waiting till 5pm for the cafe to open. Real authentic food with very generous proportions will make everyone happy. Priced on the lower side, the Afghani and the Kabiraji preparations are top notch. Seating is a bit tight though. But featuring in the flavours of Kolkata, this shack is a must for any foodie. Also try out their Choco Pudding; you probably haven't had anything similar before.

Fish kabiraji, chicken kabiraji, mutton brain chop - just excellent!! The biriyani is also not bad, it's very light and worth a try. But of course, don't visit this place for biriyani. Kabiraji and chop are their specialities. Once, we tried mutton kasa and paratha! That was also delicious and much better a certain other well known outlet for this combination. I've loved my visits to this place!!

When you talk about traditional food outlets in Kolkata, this has to be one of them. This has already crossed the 100 years mark. I have visited their Shyambazar outlet before but yesterday we decided to visit their Shobhabazar outlet. Our target was to try out their famous Brain Chop but unfortunately it was not prepared yesterday. But we did not come back because it had many other dishes to satiate our taste buds.

So, we ordered one plate of Mutton Breast Cutlet and one plate of Mutton Afghani.

Mutton Breast Cutlet was served with one home made sauce(not sure about the preparation) and salad which included onion, cucumber and boiled potatoes.

Mutton Afghani was more of a side dish so I preferred to have breads along with it.

Both the dishes were lip smacking specially the Mutton Afghani.

This is a typical old kolkata cafe outlet which has very limited number of seating arrangements but it always gives you the traditional feeling. 
Their service was also worth mentioning.

I will again come back to this place to try out their remaining dishes and definitely the most awaited Brain Chop.

The unadulterated exquisite taste your taste buds will feel totally worth of all toil..The place is legend onto itself, the snacks are nothing less than miracles in plates.. 
"Dada... 2to paratha.. Ekta chai... Dada... Ekta mutton kabiraji.. 2 to fish fry... deben.. Chicken afgani hbe ki...." haha people are so demanding so as me also ; enough said... This place gives you the feel of true bangaliana ; "petuk bengali" like me.. :-D 
Mitra Cafe is Kolkata in its truest apparition.. Despite of living in a jet-sitting digitised age, this place with its ubiquitous old North Kolkata feel have me impressed every time.. It's such a simple snacks joint that makes scintillating heavenly absolutely marvellous beverages.. 
Many may frown by it's facade as it's not at all flashy or cool but the beverages over there surely make anyone cool as well as drool also.. Both..

In today's world where restaurants are fighting hard on décors, various innovative foods and what not, these are food joints serving the same menu for years without loosing a single customer. Cause: they innovated in a time when people could not think about it and have been honest in serving the same without compromising on quality. Mitra Cafe is one such, they don't bother much on presentation or decor but just serving the known delicacies. People go there for the unadulterated taste of their food. The chicken kabiraji is minced chicken with herbs and coated with a batter of egg. It's just yum. The accompanying house made sauce (mustard and poppyseed) is damn good. One must also try the chicken/mutton Afghani which is a pure bliss. A little spicy but just awesome and unmatched compared to any in the world. The fish kabiraji is also a must try. One can also opt for a healthier chicken stew for just 20 bucks. They are a QSR much healthier than the mushrooming American food chains serving junk and charging exorbitantly high prices. Mitra Cafe scores higher than the fried chickens and burgers any day for me. Those from the new gen and not tasted yet, go ahead and relish this gem.

Mitra Cafe - Established in 1920 and continuing to serve their customers. 
=====
Mitra Cafe is a legendary and old school cafe where i paid a visit with my dad yesterday. This place has got a very good vibe to it and somehow makes me feel the love of North Kolkata. They have two small cramped sections. One is with AC and the other without. Their cafe was started long ago. The ambiance just has newspapers and pictures all over on both side stating about their awards and appreciations for the food along with few celebrities who paid a visit herein. With a not at all extraordinary ambiance, they still manage to please their customers with their food. "Shri Sushil Roy founded "MITRA CAFE" in the year 1920. Shri Roy derived the name" MITRA" signifying "FRIENDS"' as all customers are our 'FRIENDS' and this cafe belongs to them." - As they say. :) 

I went there and stalked their menu as well. This is the oldest Mitra Cafe (Head Office) which has spread its franchisee's over the city of joy. As you all know, old is gold so is this. :-)
====
What i ordered:

1) Chicken Kabiraji - It was chicken cutlet coated with egg making it a totally different dish. The egg was crispy on the outside and chicken was succulent in the inside. However, the coating was a tad bit oily. The sauce which they serve has a mild tinge to mustard and is served in paper cups with usual salad. 
It was lovely how the way the egg coating was placed. #musttry.

2) Fish Fingers - They were superb. The coating was a bit thick but tasted amazing. Served with usual dip and salad. #musttry.

3) Fish Fry - This is #MUSTMUSTTRY. The fish fry had the perfect amount of coating and tasted HEAVEN. If you visit Mitra Cafe, you can't miss on this one. 

4) Chicken Cutlet - It was good as well. Tasted good with sauce and salad. #musttry.

I also packed for Mutton Cutlet, Chicken Cutlet and Fish Cutlet for my cousin sister. She said to have liked the same. The total bill came to near about 490 bucks. I found the affair to be quite reasonable considering the amount of dishes ordered. I also did not feel heavy after eating the aforesaid. 
=====
Pros:

1) Old and Legendary. The place runs by it's name.
2) Food remains the same over years.
3) Prices are kept very reasonable.
4) Service is fast!

Cons:
1) Ambiance is old school and seating a bit crampy.
2) The menu card has not been changed and is being used since ages. 
=====
Meal for two: 300-600 max. 
=====
Expert Suggestions:
Outer Coating can be made a bit thin for the fish finger. Please keep that in mind. Rest all is well. 
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 4.1/5
Food Quantity 4.0/5
Food Presentation 3.6/5
Taste 4.2/5
Value for money 4.2/5
Ambiance 3/5
Hygiene 3.2/5
=====
Conclusion: I would love to visit them again. An experience to be cherished. For the love of food, this place deserves a 4.0! :)

The old school ambience of this place attracts me to it. The fish fry and kabiraji are excellent. Also try out their chocolate pudding. I thought the quantity served was less but it tasted really good.

Mitra cafe is the place taking us back to the aristocratic Calcutta... It's simply a classic place... Speciality is cutlets... Go for Mutton Afghani, Chicken or Mutton or fish kabiraji...
At first when I was small I didn't knew about this place... My father took me... I thought it was my Boro pishi's cafe because her name is Mitra... But to my disappointment it was not...
Really a sad story.

This iconic restaurant is an integral part of the bengali culture. So I was looking forward to visit this place for long. And here comes the review
1.Ambiance - I have heard about this cafe from my grand dad and was amazed to see that the ambiance has remained the same .It's a very small place with a cramped seating capacity of 20 persons. There is one a.c. segment and one non a.c segment. The chair and tables are the old Calcutta cabin ones. Overall, the ambiance belongs to the retro Calcutta era
2.Hospitality - there was a single waiter for covering the whole a.c. part. But he was very prompt and good with his suggestions
3.Food - we ordered the following:
Chicken cutlet - one of the best cutlet, I have ever had, and promptly ordered the mutton cutlet also.
Mutton cutlet - equally tasty like it's chicken counterpart.
Mutton kabirazi - the outer egg fried coating was brilliant but didn't like the inner stuffing that much
Chicken kosha- salute to this most authentic kosha I have ever tasted. Mustt have with either roti or bread.
Overall true blue bongs must visit this place to relish the old Calcutta charm

Who is unaware of this old wine, the cafe is buzzing with foodies all year round. This will treat you to old Calcutta style.
The food available here are everything that our elders and betters have grown up on. You can get all the fish, chicken, egg and vegetable savouries here with some salads on the plates.
The prices are inexpensive. But the taste will be good. 
But obviously being an old cafe, this one has a few shortcomings. The place is really a cubby-hole. There is not enough room to host a lot of people. So you will have to wait in case the place is chock-a-block. Another problem is, this being an old and small one, it may not look 'well-groomed' for a restaurant.
But if you can overlook that part or just wish to pick up some eats while homebound, this is a good option. Takeaway from here will be a great way to show your grannies how much you love them and remember what they like by bringing things for them, plucked out of their era. Try this.

Have you ever seen Kabiraji Cutlet being made? It's fascinating. Their Diamond Kabiraji is toothsome. Only downer is the use of Vanaspati instead of good quality oil or ghee ( which is also bad, but... better than dalda.)

After reading so many positive reviews of this place being a foodie i had to go there. I knew what i was going there for, the famous BRAIN CHOP and it didnt dissappoint at all, infact that will be in my "must have list" every time i go there. We didnt get a seat n i was too impatient and hungry to wait for it so we just took it away and gobbled it up in no time on our way back. I am sure to visit this 'little foodie wonderland' again n again (n i hope to get a seat next time round :P)

Value for money is the term I would describe this 100 year old food joint, by. Quite small in size . Ate mutton kabiraji, fish diamond fry, chicken cutlet. It was nice and they serve a customized kasundi which is really tasty. For evening snacks, without burning a hole in the pocket, drop by and grab a bite.

'Valo khan...' thats the part of the catchline Mitra cafe uses. They mean it definitely. In an afternoon,after giving another tiring exam of job,I went in Mitra cafe,hungrily. 
In the little space of the cafe,it's really hard to settle down(if u go in group) but who cares when smoking chicken stew is in front of you,with the smell of butter and pepper. Waiter suggested me to have toast with it.so I did. After finishing the appetizer,I moved on to Brain Chop. This is a speciality of Mitra cafe. A fried cricket ball size Chop came along with salad(Here salad comes with boiled potato). I thrusted my knife in Chop. Almost pasted meat mixed with some unknown mixture gave my taste buds a clarion call. For next few minutes,I was silent while my mouth and hands were quite busy. 'Hunger is the best sauce'- proved at Mitra cafe.😜

It's a very small place which makes it hard to get a seat in this place easily. 
They should pay some extra effort on cleanliness because when I visited this place with a friend of mine she saw a bug over there and kept on panicking all the time...
Now coming to the food the chicken kabirajee was awesome it was one of the best thing I've ever tasted and their chocolate pudding was also great.

FISH FRY..... Bengali's favourite snack is today sold worldwide,believe it or not Mitra Cafe has been selling it for more than 100 years. I went to this 'Colosseum' of fast food after years. We ordered a fish fry (unlike other places--here there's a special type known as Fish DIAMOND fry. It's a bit long rhombus shaped and not rectangular), prawn kabiraji & Mutton Afghani. Yeah, story goes that years back the owner noticed despite selling the best of fried items, sumhow customers yearned for a GRAVY item in order to have a wholesome diet with roti or rice. Yep: that s how Afghani was born.. A simple Mutton Cutlet topped with rich, tasty gravy. Tastes wonderful with roti or toasted bread.. Mahanayak Uttam Kumar  himself  was a regular one time during his years in the 'natok' industry. This place is a perfect abode for food lovers to sit & relish their food with their friends or 'mitros' as we call it in Bengali. Yeah, the owner unlike others did not name the shop after them. In fact they  named it 'Mitra Cafe' as in 'Friends Cafe'. The Roy family are the owners of this marvelous gem of fast food for more than a century. A must go for any resident, visitor of kolkata at least once

Mitra Cafe , I am writing about the restaurant of Sobha Bazar on jatindra Mohan avenue. When you are in front of it, it reminds you of old kolkata, North kolkata culture & commercial theatre which has completely become a history. I have spent my childhood & young age in this area. Mitra Cafe was an important part of our life. When ever some honoured guests are coming , that meant our servant bablu da was going to Mitra Cafe & some breastcutlets & afghani cutlet or chicken kabiraji is coming. We were part of a joint family of 20, in which 10 are children. We hardly manage to get half portion or may be less than that. I remember when one of my elder cousin's marriage was fixed , on the day of pakadekha ( that is the day on which marriage is confirmed )one of the bridegroom's relative demanded items of Mitra Cafe. In our childhood there always was a story teller in family or neighbourhood. One day the storyteller uncle was telling about Mitra cafe. We were 5 or 7 around him hearing him with wide eyes. " One day a big car came & stopped in front of Mitra Cafe ,driver got down & mutton kabiraji,fishfry were ordered for taking away. When the parcel was delivered do you know who came out of the car to pay ?" Our eyes became wider& wider. After some suspense was created the answer came---"UTTAM KUMAR".!!!  we managed to say after sometime "really? ". Then when our parents &other relatives went to Watch theatre or jatra at Star Theatre, babluda bought foods from Mitra Cafe & delivered them at intervals. When I'm in college sometimes used to go to Jay puria college to meet some friends, we ate from Mitra Cafe. Treats given by friends on birthdays or any other occasions always Mitra Cafe got prefarance .These were how Mitra Cafe played role in our lives. Then now those days have gone , now I live in South kolkata. Went to meet an old aunt in Gray Street. Got down from metro at Sobha Bazar station went up to Central Avenue & Mitra Cafe was there as it was before 20 years. I'm there after some 5 years. I couldn't resist myself & entered in the restaurant.Heard "4 fish kabiraji" a boy ordered. I remember , it was a mystery that what a kabiraj, that is an ayurvedic doctor has to do with cutlets. Then one day someone said originally it is coverage, changed to kabiraji. A subject of research for linguistics. Kabirajis are the cutlets with egg coverage, taste delicious. That day I bought some items like chicken breastcutlets & prawn cutlets & took them home. Tastes haven't changed at all, they haven't compromised with anything . You have to taste your self. I don't know what I wrote , review or memory; just came out of my inside. I came to know a branch is opened in Golpark, I'm very happy . Now I can have the cutlets & go back in my childhood memories.

Kabiraji, cutlet, fish fry - think about Kolkata fast food and you find the one of the best varieties in Mitra Cafe. Conveniently situated opposite to shovabazar metro station Mitra Cafe is place to go for tasty fast food. I tried mutton kabiraji and it was delicious. It's a must try for all street food lovers.

One of those vintage fast-food places in North Kolkata which has managed to preserve its charm, Mitra Cafe is not be judged by its facade or interiors, which is pretty lacklustre. But the dishes served will leave you craving for more. The Kabirajis, Cutlets, Chops and Diamond Fry are leading dishes. Though the diamond fry doesn't appeal to me as much, the chicken cutlet is one of the finest that I have had, crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside! Just a clean and hygienic atmosphere would go a long way. If chic dining is the agenda then this is not the place, instead try it for reminisces of old Calcutta.

Getting a seat when you want it is hardly possible. You just have to wait. Well at least the food does justify the insane wait time. Had chicken kobiraji & boy it definitely was tasty. I didn't quite like the sauce they served as condiment. But nevertheless this place is worth a visit.

Walked into this legendary cafe for a snacky riot,I could not stop pampering my taste buds. Pocket-sized eatery and pocket friendly budget...the foods lined up here were finger licking. 
Brain Chop, Fish Fry, Mutton Kabiraji, Chicken Soup Special, Chicken Roast Special...I wish I could just keep ordering :)  The quality and quantity, both were just matchless.Last but not the least, Chocolate Pudding, this was yummy as it could be.

Yesterday I had the best egg- mutton devil of my life!!! Right at this small wonder tucked away at a corner of the sovabajar metro crossing, a small place with few seating arrangements..
Mitra cafe is a 100 year old legendary eatery serving food to swear by for decades. Right at the hub of old world north Kolkata this place reigns in its own glory. Finally I visited this place yesterday with my husband and was pleasantly surprised!! Never could I imagine they can make such delicious choco pudding!! Topped with chocolate sauce it was the best I had in a long time! We had their famous kabiraji (chicken), fish diamond fry and fish finger as well. All the dishes reflected the expertise and class of this place.. This is a true gem of North Kolkata.

2)fish kobiraji and diamond fry
3) mutton and chicken afgani
4) mutton kobiraji and kosha
5) chicken braised cutlet 
6)pudding.............. and a soup you get for Rs 2 only :D 
                                     All the above mentioned dishes are worth trying and i guess you need to be there atleast 3 times to try these out.  I believe communication wont be a problem as it is bang opposite to the sobhabazar metro.

Mitra Cafe is known for tickling the bengali toung specially. But it has broken all boundaries and delighted all foodies in Kolkata. Mitra Cafe is a heritage resturant where the old cusine rules. Though you will find a lot of varity on the menu but the signature dishes are the same old oily stuff like "Moglai Porota", "Kobiraji", "Fish Cutlet", "Vegetable Chop" and the list is huge which not even a girl can resist for it's taste. The space is small and best suited for love birds or old friends adda with a quick snack and hardly for a family dining. The best option for many people is the take away option or to place an order over phone and pick it up while going home .... This resturant has maintained its standard for really long time and continues to do so .....

It is a favourite for us, the people of Calcutta since years. Even my father, grandfather used to visit this small food joint. 
Nostalgia wise I would have rated it 4. But I have found the taste of some of the items quite bland of late. 
Especially the fish 'kobiraji', I personally believe its quality is not at par what it was even 5 years back. So as the Fish fry. Especially the mustard sauce with fish fry was missing the aroma of Mustard. 
Luckily their Brain Chop is still quite good. 
And still all of their items are quite affordable. 

If anyone wants to give it a visit, try to be there either before 18:30 or after 20:30 IST. 

And my personal favourites are Brain Chop, Fish Fry and Fish Kobiraji (though I believe it has lost its old charm)

I have been to Mitra Cafe shobhabazar just once after already having gulped down four glasses of excellent sherbet at paramount ( since my friend and I were on a food trip to cover legendary places in old calcutta and had to cover a few other places still) - so we could order only a few dishes - (a) fish kabiraji, (b) chicken kabiraji, and (c) chicken cutlet.

the chicken dishes were very good but the fish kabiraji was just outstanding. the service is quick and all items are very well priced ( we paid about 200 bucks for everything we had).

this is a place which calls for many visits to discover the hidden gems in the menu and also for more practical purposes since they dont have all items everyday ( they had run out of mutton cutlet around 5pm when we had reached). but I would cover all those 10 kms from my home to reach there and to eat again.

A Bengali delight when it comes to snacks. Ranging from mughlai paratha to kabiraji this place has it all. Although these delicacies can mainly be found (made properly) in the northern part of Calcutta. This place really sets the bar. Not at all pocket pinching and hearty sizes. Probably the best place for after college adda. Probably the best devils and chops in town are made here.

Running over 100 years it is famous for fast food. This place is very simply decorated better to say not at all decorated having seating arrangment for hardly 10 people. The food is extraordinarily delicious. The air of the sovabazar crossing is always full of the smell of their food. The Diamond kabiraji they serve is more than delicious please give it a try atleast once. The fish fry, fish chop...everything is great. Taking away is the best option here as alwyas it is packed with people in the evening.

It is one of the oldest cafe in the city. They have many branches but this one is carrying legacy from last 70 years approx. The ambience is pretty old school type and you can feel the essence of actual north kolkata.
Proper hospitality from the waiters will make you feel more special. 
If you come with an empty stomach, this place will make your stomach more emptier, reason behind is the SMELL... Smell of chop,kabiraji, various types of fries.
Well, this place is mainly famous for brain chop and diamond kabiraji but I would like to share few other dishes which are pretty underrated in this place however they have the ability to overtake any above mentioned food. 
1. Mutton Kasha/ Paratha - In terms of this preparation we all know who holds the no.1 spot (golbari) but try it once in Mitra Cafe along with paratha. Supreme quality of mutton, juicy to be very precise and with less bones. Same goes with the paratha, it's soft but little bit oily.
2. Mutton or Chicken Afgani / Toast: Afgani is a kind of a preparation which needs compactness and this place used to maintain this compactness. This item is not that rich however it managed to maintain taste at the utmost level. Have it with a toast to make your experience more beautiful.
Come with your buddies or family. This place can provide nostalgia,happiness altogether along with supreme quality of food.

Hey..I went to this heritage restaurant at shovabazar just a month ago. I ordered dim-er-devil,fish chop and chocolate vanilla pudding.
The devil was jus as expected. Quite big in size. Bigger than what other restaurants offer. Taste was good too and the fresh salad was a good accomplishment.
But i found the fish chop was better.
It didn't have any fishy smell,much to my liking.
But I have a big complain against the quality of pudding.
It was tasteless and lacked all the qualities of a good pudding.
I hope they improve that. :)

Mitra cafe is a legendary place near shobhabazar metro station. It excels in various types of fast foods like cutlets, fries, kabirajis, etc. 

The space is very congested. They have a seperate family section which is air conditioned. We settled there and ordered a fish diamond fry and a chicken kabiraji.

First came the fry. It was large in size and was served with a mustard sauce, salad and boiled potatoes. The mustard sauce had an excellent taste. The whole fry had a fish fillet in it and it tasted great.

Next came chicken kabiraji. It was more than enough for one person. The kabiraji was just perfect ! The crisp outer layer was excellnt and the chicken filling was huge. With the mustard sauce, it tasted great.

This place is unique and has a legacy.
Try this place for a great chicken breast cutlet.
I also like the paratha and chili chicken vombo that they serve. The chicken kebab plate is also good and they serve 10 pieces at a ln affordable price of 60 bucks.

Mitra cafe need no introduction... It is one of the few last stansing resturent which held the colonial legecy of kolkata...the location of the resturent is awesm...over cr avenue...opposite sovabazar metro....the cuttlet is the best dish...but you can also try afgani or kabiraji...and in desert pudding give you a new flavour...though the place is very small but if you try u can hear the footstep of colonial restora...a must visit place for dood lover...and please visit the main outlet ...which is in sovabazar nt the shayambazar one...

Located near sobhabazar,this place is yet another snack cabins having the ambience of the 70s or 80s..
A typical old school setup and its literally difficult to get a seat at peak hours.interior is quite clumsy and you often end up sharing tables with strangers.
 This place is quite famous for cutlets and fish fries but as for now one wouldn't find anything amazing about them..

The staff is quite rude however it is quite pocket friendly..if your budget is on the lower side and you are craving for snack near sobhabazar you can definitely give this vintage cafe a try

@Overfried in burnt oil the cutlets and fish fries.One of the worst junk foods ever tasted...Living in the shadow of their past glory.Few days back bought some of their premium items for home. Our micro oven still stinking of the smell of their stale and rotten fish fries!

Visited here a few times and each time they lived up to my expectations. What impressed me the most is the quality of fish they serve.....the batter fry just melts in the mouth and the boiled potatoes they serve with it complement it very much. Only one tickling issue......the cooking medium they use leaves a coating of saturated fat in your mouth after the meals. Would really appreciate if it changes. Apart from that I would highly recommend this place....

To me if Tendulkar is GOD of cricket then Mitra Cafe is GOD of fries and cutlets . The joint exuberates the pride of Bengali Amish bhaja bhuji, which the so called Anglo failed to beat . The neo chrome and glass MNC food conglomerates of fried chicken and fried fish is still not a yardstick for this institution.
The prawn cutlet , fish kobiraji, the unique vegetable chop which is slightly bigger than the kookaburra cricket ball ,diamond fry , brain chop, and finally the zestful fish fry which has created a lineage and Mitra cafe a synonym. 
The joint is a small unimpressive shop like structure with hardly a space to fit  around 20 heads apart from a small ac room for another 15 heads and for families only . Pl don't visit the place for interiors but  to be part of a legend . The place is a landmark of North Calcutta , probably it's a sobriquet of that area .
Mitra cafe has an idiosyncratic element of adding a piece of a boiled potato and a green saucy stuff made of yogurt mint coriander served with the fries . This is the only joint where soup is a glass of  thickened chicken and veg stock with grounded pepper corns and yet tastes divine . The chicken stew is a buttery and milk gravy with grounded coconut ,vegetables and succulent meat which the doctors even recommend for the frailest of the frail patients . 
The taste lies their blending of spices in the heritage way of grinding on stones and blending and mixing with hands withrinimal use of automatic appliances . The aroma is so hypnotising that even you are 5 mins away from the joint you can't resist to grab a bite . The stuffs move out so swiftly that within 6 they are halfway over . 
Be there and binge ,

Mitra Cafe is featured in Legendary Restaurants, because it has a lot of nostalgia attached to it. It is a true Bengali cafe, where Kolkatans love to have their favourite snacks- Chop, Cutlet, and more.

I ate here only once. Securing a table inside will take some time, and also, you have to share a table with strangers, because that's the norm. I ain't complaining because it's not a posh cafe.

Anyway, I had their famous Fish Kabiraji and Fish Finger. Both tasted as they would. Nothing special from what you get at other places.

I find the place slightly over hyped. And the staff are rude.

Fish Fry, Fish Chop, Brain Chop, Mutton Cutlet, Chicken Cutlet,Chocolate Pudding, ...whatever you see in Menu, i can say all are worth trying. Super taste, Love it. very samll place, so getting a seat is a big difficulty.

Getting a seat here during peak hours will always be a struggle, especially with the cramped up space that the administration of the shop has not found the need to expand upon.
The food is great, must say, some of the best chops and cutlets in Calcutta they have, alongwith mouthwatering dishes like chicken Afghanis. It is fresh as well, and not stale, because hardly any food stays behind after the massive sales they have all day.
Though a bit overpriced, but carries the Bengaliness, which is an experience in itself, and an added impetus to share that experience.

Great Food. Great Taste. Mainly depends on the take away. Seating arrangement is small. The Chicken and Mutton Kabiraji are to die for. Awesome cutlets and rolls. They recently introduced chinese and biriyani in their menu. Though the Biriyani is Ok types, chinese is not at all good. But if your long for a tasty snack, this is the best place around Shyambazar.

quite small a place on the outside , it had 10 seats . this place is known for its chop , katlets and make sure you stick to that only . the ambience is not suitable for a proper meal though i don't know about the A.C. room inside coz it was for families only . 
we ordered chicken kobiraji , lacha parota , mutton kosha and choco pudding . 
the order came fast and the waiter was very helpful . we didn't get the brain chop as it was finished by the time we went (8 pm) . 
the koboraji was very nice and it was a big piece of chicken , loved it . the mutton was tender and tasty but the "parota" was quite hard , as the biriyani was not available we had to order it . the pudding was tasty , but i didn't like it that much . maybe i expected something better . 
the bill was 440 /- . 
will go again for the kabiraji and will definitely try something else also this time .

Mitra Cafe is Vintage Kolkata . Situated near Shova bazar near the infamous Sonagachi brothels; this place reminds you of the old world charms of North Kolkata. Small place with limited sitting place ; you WL normally have to wait for few minutes to get a space. You can try anything from fish Kabiraji to fish cutlet to chicken stew. You wl be bowled over by the awesome quality. If you love street food you can't give this place a miss.

So, it's 6 in the evening on a Saturday and you mentally blanch at the sight of the crowd in and outside the Mitra Cafe. You stop for a moment, debating whether it's a wise decision to go in or if you should just settle for a Chingri Cutlet at Allen's (closer and usually tantalizingly emptier), then decide against it as the Fish Diamond Fry beckons, take a deep breath (and take the name of your preferred deity) and plunge in!
Magically, the crowd parts and you even get a place to sit at the tiny AC room in the back. You order your coveted Fish Fry and also a Kobiraji for your friend and some chicken stew for good measure. The brain chop is never quite available, you make (another) mental note to drop in at 4 pm (the hallowed hour when the food of the gods is supposedly made and almost instantly sold out). The stew is fortifying. The fry is delicious - the sharpness of the white mustard and the peculiarly satisfying potato and beet salad bolstering the taste. Your friend agrees the Kobiraji is good but he probably prefers the one at Dilkhusha. You finally agree to share a piece of the pudding and decide to call it a day.The ambience is typical of old North Kolkata cafes, do not expect any frills - the furniture is solid, old fashioned chairs and tables, anyone can (and will) grab the seat next to you and rapidly slurp his stew (or gobble his cutlet, or both). Service is fast (usually) - do not expect (unnecessary) courtesy or finesse - their priority is getting the food out to the clamouring crowd outside and they succeed admirably! You are lucky if you get a smile - but that is usually to tell you that what you seek from their kitchen is alas, out of stock!The prices are reasonable. In fact, you may find a surprisingly cheap soup or a vegetable chop priced unbelievably low as well.
Go for the food and a taste of the old-world North Kolkata cafe culture.

Very small restaurant. Vintage. Not fancy. But the food is awesome. Have tried each and every item here and couldn't find flaws in any. Iconic dish is the brain chop.. you need to be there by 5 to get it. The chicken stew is great and the mutton kosha is awesome they serve it with bread..the kobiraji's are also awesome.

I reached Mitra Cafe at 4.55pm and it had waiting. Today was a solo date day! The place is very easy to locate. Thank God! They didn't have Brain Chop so that's a disappointment. I ordered Fish Chop which was sweet. That didn't go well with my idea of a chop. Then I tried Chicken Kabiraji which was a delight had it not been for the taste of the oil.
I understand things being fried and deeply fried but the after taste that it left in my mouth was of plain oil. I am not a big fan of the Mustard Sauce; it's too strong for my liking. I had planned to pack Mutton Kasha and Lachha Parantha for dinner but I think I will detox tonight.
The place is good. I went alone so had to share the table with another lady. Not that I mind. And give it 15 minutes it became extremely crowded.
I want to try the Brain chop and the pudding, but even with my ability to eat I think that, the amount of oil going in my body will do me more harm than good. So one thing at a time. :D
A decent experience. :)

I always wanted to visit the old classic food places of Calcutta, but then the location of most of the revered food joints of Calcutta are in north. Being a typical south guy the distance has played a spoil sport, always.
Nonetheless, this time I decided that I shall start my food trip of the classic food joints of Calcutta by this revered place, the Mitra Cafe, who still boasts of a 4.0 rating in zomato.
Located just opposite to the sovabazar metro, this small dingy place provides some awesome Bengali chop cutlet food.
Raining outside, lots of people ordering there share of food, we thought it would take a good amount of time to get place here. Surprisingly, the waiter said, there's a vacancy of 2ppl and we were overfilled with joy.
Seated inside a claustrophobic room, sharing the table with a couple, I ordered the elusive brain chop, to my surprise it was the last piece, they had, my frnd ordered the mutton breast cutlet. We further ordered the fish n chicken kobiraji cutlet n ended with a chicken stew.
The brain chop is one of a kind, prepared with tender, succulent pieces of mutton brain n other stuff, its disgustingly yummy.What started as disgusting to me, because I have never before tried any brain parts, but ended up tasting awesome. The breast cutlet, was filled with yummy soft chunks of mutton, fried heavily. The chicken n fish kobiraji was fine too, filled with hearty proportions of soft chicken n tender fillet of bhetki. The chicken stew was a surprise,awesome stew with big soft pieces of chicken....perfect finish to the evening snacks.
It cost us 360. With the price they serve this quality of food, really amazed me. But then, this has always been the beauty of Calcutta/Kolkata, value for money.
A true #kolkataklassic !!

Went here few days back for a quick evening snacks. 
Location- easy to access. Opposite the petrol pump in C.R Avenue (sovabazar metro station)
Ambience- a small eatery with both a.c and non a.c section. A.c section is for whole food and non a.c section is for snacks.
Food ordered- i wanted to taste their famous brain chop which was not available. Hence ordered chicken kabiraji. It had a crispy outer covering with ample chicken inside. It was not very oily and tasted great. It was enough for a snacks.
Price- our bill was Rs.160/- hence it was pocket friendly considering the quality and quantity.
I will definitely go back and try their other items.

The first notable point about Mitra Cafe is it's rich history and tradition associated with it. The food served here is absolutely mouth watering. The ubiquitous Diamond Kabiraji which is almost found in every plates needs a special mention. The fish stuffing inside the Kabiraji wrapped up in a fried egg crust is just scrumptious. Also, the Mutton Kasha dish is worth mentioning. The mutton is so neatly boiled to perfection that will simply melt in your mouth. 
The friendly behavior of the staff along with prompt response has gained Mitra Cafe a reputation in Kolkata and beyond. 

But yeah please keep it in mind if you are a person who likes to avoid oily stuffs and is health conscious this food joint is not for you. 

CHEERS! :)

Old Calcutta charm at its best...
Me and a friend went there...and ordered a Fish Kabiraji and Mutton Kabiraji...
The thing that I liked about it was that it was stuffed with pure fish and mutton keema respectively...and the outer egg coating of the kabiraji which I find very unpalatable in other food joints was very crispy and non oily...and it was a treat...
The price is reasonable at 80 and 90 rs respectively...
The pudding which is quite famous was a big letdown though...
The ambience is nothing much...and the shortage of space is a problem...
But if u want to have authentic Kolkata street food...Mitra cafe is the place for u...

Classic Calcutta - Mitra Cafe. No confusion, great combination. Roadside small cafe and good food. Hasn't changed. 

I went there with my friend today and ordered a fish kabiraji and mutton kabiraji. Well both were filled with fish and mutton respectively and those fried parts were at loads as well. It's very heavy and enough for one person. Both time items actually. Costing 80 and 90 respectively, they're certainly good for snacks and other purposes. Then we ordered a chocolate pudding which u heard is really good over here but it's nothing more than a mere sandesh. Priced at 50, certainly not worth it.

There's nothing to add about atmosphere and stuff. Just the old Calcutta feel. Nothing more. Service was fast and good. Otherwise a roadside thing. Nothing to mention about it.

All in all. A good place for food, just.

If you have not eaten here...or visited it...you have so far missed a tiny piece of old culinary Kolkata. So yes, I had to take my daughters there :)

Visit to find out how a middle class bengali family used  to go out to have some  good eats in the 1900's. Visit it to find out why it is still is part of the Kolkata Food map. Visit it if you want to find out how a hole-in-the-wall-food-joint or so called cafe has survived for 100 years. In fact there could be a hundred reasons, you just go figure out a few on your own.

This is one of those places where one goes in to take in the feel of history of the place!!! A remarkable place to eat and satisfy your taste buds. This place has managed to maintain its dignity for a long time. The food here is not the most outstanding type but definitely is remarkable in its own way. The place looks quite fine and service is something you wont complain about most of the times. In peak hours it has quite a rush. The menu is pocket friendly and will manage to draw you towards it again. But it is a place you should visit just to enjoy it. A heritage of a place. Do visit.

Rather than being a legendary place this place can be a put off in terms of its look. But DO NOT judge it on the basis of its looks!

Opposite Shobhabajar Metro, Mitra Cafe lies being the emblem of Old Calcutta. Food here is famous, and outstanding to say the least. 

What should you try - 

1. Fish Diamond Kabiraji
2. Mutton Kobiraji
3. Cutlet

And anything or everything. Almost all the delicacies will leave you wanting more.

A little chit chat over bread crumbs. This would perfectly sum up my visit at one of the branches of the famous Mitra Cafe yesterday night. The place is nothing much from the outside, but as soon as we entered we noticed the place was teeming with people and we had wait a couple of minutes before we could get a seat. We ordered two cutlets - one of chicken and another of mutton. Service was really fast. As I started having with I smiled at their lesser use of oil. But my smile did not last longer as soon as I noticed how thick the bread crumbs coating was and how thin the bland tasting chicken/ mutton layer inside it. The color of the coat suggested being fried too long in too old oil. I hated how their people used the other side of our table to distribute the parcel orders. I agree with my friend who chimed in that even the local shops make better cutlets than this place.

Heritage is thy middle name …. So says this legendary eatery near Shobhabazar metro station ! For getting yourself a seat ensure that you are sharp on time as the place fills up as soon as it opens. We visited on an evening and it was at around 4-45 to 5 that it opened up . I had particularly been there for  their famous Brain Chop which left me swooning and drooling . Other recommended dishes here are the Kabirajis  and Afgani cutlet .Prices are extremely moderate considering their quality and quantity . A must visit for all the “kolkata cabin” lovers.

An age old classic. I came here last year very apprehensive of the restaurant due to its lack luster ambience and small 'dhaba' like appearance.  This year when I visited my hometown of Kolkata I insisted that we revisit Mitra Cafe for its flavours and memories of its delicacies lingered in my mind for over an year. 
This year I returned to Kolkata witha wishlist of restaurants and Mitra cafe was near the top. 
A small two room restaurant with a seating capacity of about 15 . A place that is packed 24x7  365. It's good is so famous that people actually wait in line for hours and squeeze themselves into the tightest spots to get a seat.  
We ordered a Prawn Kobiraji, Chicken Kobiraji, Mutton Kobiraji, Diamond(fish+prawn) Kobiraji and a afghani chicken. 
The Afghani chicken was slightly overcooked but had a rich flavour profile and would go well with a bowl of rice to make a sumptuous lunch. 
The Kobiraji- possibly a dish that every resident of Kolkata has heard about.  An age of technique of coating a crumbed meat and frying it has been made so elegant by mitra cafe. A extraordinarily beautiful plate of food. Each Kobiraji is stuffed very well and is nice and thick. There is  absolutely no grease and the meats are cooked to perfection every dam time. The coated meet is wrapped in a Mitra Cafe only egg white spiral coating. Trust me when I tell you no one in the world will you see the egg coating that is the symbol of Mitra cafe. Each Kobiraji is absolutely amazing and it's why I returned for Mitra cafe. 
I can certainly say in the future if provided the opportunity I will return to Mitra cafe for a few more Kobirajis. 
I would absolutely love for everyone to come here and try there food , for it truly is One Of A Kind.

This Legendary eatery is located just opposite to sovabazar metro station on Central Avenue..To describe this place probably I have been frequenting it even before developed my senses..this place has been visited by four generations of my family,so that pretty much describes the longevity of this famous place..I believe no article on the history of food culture in kolkata can be complete without a special mention of this outlet..A centrury old cafe and of the forerunners of cafe culture in kolkata,it is still maintaining the same quality and taste,probably the reason behind its ever increasing fame and enhanced reputation..To talk of the food their Brain Chop and Fish Fry are my personal favourites..Crisp,crunchy,right amount of spices and balanced in taste..Other unique and Highly Recommended dishes are their Fish Roll,Kabiraji, Afghani Cutlet (probably served in very few eateries nowadays), Chicken Roast and Mutton Kasha..But off late I have found they have reduced the size of the portions..may be to off-set the clutches of inflation..
One thing should be kept in mind this place has retained the age old look,old marble tables,wooden chairs..no frills attached..So if you are looking for a refined or highly decorated place for casual dining,this may not be the right option for you,still you can always opt for a take away..

Heard about this restaurant for long. Did not end up being there. So traveled an awkward mile just to reach Mitra café for evening "pet-pujo". Was seeking help from Google maps & they pointed to a different place in the same locality. Used Indian google – " Dada where is Mitra café " & it worked like magic. We were quite amused to see the "picture" here. It took us some time to understand what the menus actually meant. It basically tries to stop people from ordering chops (low priced item) & sitting in the A/C room while others wait outside. The waiting staff were very typical of an age old cafe. But the service was prompt.

Not knowing what to order, we 'sheepishly' asked for Lamb Brain chop but it wasn't available. So we ended up ordering mutton cutlet. It had an amazing filling – intense, robust, great fusion of meat and spices. Outside bread crumb & masala layer was thicker than optimum but that didn't affect much as the filling was outstanding. We then opted for Fish diamond fry – superb dish I must say. It had soft, flaky, juicy & excellent fish inside. The outer cover was again slightly thicker than optimum but still the fry was very good. We weren't filled up to our mouths yet. So we kept on ordering - this time Prawn Cutlet. It was so juicy inside that as I broke it for sharing, the juice just flowed out and fell into the plate. Next we (mistakenly) ordered Mutton Kosha. It was very ordinary. The mutton pieces were a bit stiff and the gravy is just average. Next stop - disaster strikes again. Chicken do pyaza is what we ordered but what we were served was chicken kosha. We understood it as we bit into the food & found that the the base gravy tasted quite similar. The only difference is that the chicken was garnished with a bundle of brown fried onions. Surprisingly no Indian Bread was being served with the curries. So we were offered pao (1/4 pound) roti toasted. We went for it. For dessert there was only one offering – Pudding. Its body was similar in texture to chhana based sweet kachagolla but different as well. It had two layers in 2 colors. It was soft, grainy & flavorful. It had a chocolate sauce topping. It was a pleasant surprise. Looking forward to revisiting to try out their kabirajis and of course, lamb brain chops.

It was my first visit to Mitra Cafe opposite Sovabazar metro station and i really enjoyed the old world charm and their famous food. Brain chop with white sauce (which i suppose is their speciality) tastes heaven. Next i tried their Prawn kobiraji which i found superbly delicious. Kobiraji is really Mitra Cafe's forte. Ambience is very homely. Although space is a problem but being the original outlet has its own charm. Do go early by 5 pm or else getting you have to wait. For first timers like me, i suggest try their kobiraji( prawn/fish/mutton),brain chop and choco pudding. If you are foodie you won't regret it. Happy tasting.

Great old world charm in old kolkata. The typical 'chop cutlet' place with the old marble top tsbles and jaded plates and cutlery. Mutton Cutlettes, Brain Chop, Kabirajis and Afghanis.... Ghey have the entire repertoire to transport one back in time by 40/50 years. The food is magical.....

Warning 1: Come early to get seats. This place fills up within minutes.

Warning 2: Many of their special items simply go out of stock within an hour of opening. We had to visit this restaurant twice just to try their Brain Chop.

Warning 3: Zomato says it opens at 4 PM. In reality, we had to wait outside the restaurant for nearly an hour till they opened at 4.45 PM.

An 105 years old legendary cafe near the Sovabazar – Central Avenue crossing, with  the Sovabazar Metro Station within a stone's throw. This north Kolkata cafe was once a regular stop for many renowned celebrities. From Uttam Kumar to Anjan Dutta to Bratya Basu, this place has welcomed a lot of Stars.

This is a small restaurant and we found the interior a little stuffy and suffocating. But once you look at the walls covered with newspaper articles and celebrity collages, you will realize the truth in the adage, look doesn't matter. I read in the comments section that some people have tagged this place as a typical Telebhaja place. Mitra Cafe doesn't offer any of the items that we Kolkatans know as Telebhaja.

They have two types of seating arrangements. I found the room inside a lot more comfortable. However, if you don't care for privacy or people stepping on your feet and elbowing you on their way in or out of the restaurant, then you can go for the tables they have near the cash counter. This is a small eatery, there are around 23 – 26 seats in total and they fill up in minutes. We entered the place right when it opened and within minutes the other tables were occupied too. Most of the time there's a long queue of people waiting outside for a seat or parcel. 

The waiters are prompt and helpful. Once you order, they will bring the item on your table within 10 minutes. We had to try their special Brain Chop which has always been a hot favourite among foodies! It's quite large and heavy. Once you take a bite, there's heaven stuffed inside. You have to taste it yourself to realize.

Next, we wanted to try their Special Diamond Fry but decided to go for Mutton Kaviraji instead. Once again, the food reached our table within a few minutes. Their mutton kaviraji was huge; we didn't expect it to be so large. The outer layer is wrapped with fried egg crust which is basically tasteless. Once we took a bite of the actual part, we fell in love with this item too. The only thing we didn't like is the sauce they serve with the items; we were avoiding it as much as possible.

The Kavirajis were so heavy that we couldn't order any other item. So we decided to come back again. This is one of those restaurants where you have to keep coming back for more. They have continued to be a legend for more than 100 years at a stretch; for all the valid reasons.

Well , a good place of hangout for the Kolkattans. Not a single person in Kolkata haven't ever been over here. It is almost more than a 100 years old. The bong icon , Uttam Kumar have also been over here , which makes the Kolkattans come over here more. It's marks the oldest tastes of Kolkata. The location is pretty good as well near Gray Street and Central Avenue junction near Shobha Bazar metro. The brain chop , was Vivekananda's favourite , and now ours favourite too. A must visit for a perfect quick bite. Fish Kabiraji is a bliss to a taste bud as well. Must visit , foodies !

Was contemplating a visit to this place for a very long time. Mitra cafe has its name etched in the pages of Kolkata's culinary history. A small shop no bigger than a average grocery store, located bang opposite to the shobhabazar metro station, Mitra cafe has had its fair share of fame with a huge number of celebrities visiting the store. 
We walked in and were disappointed to not get a table in the AC section, so 4 of us cramped our selves into one of the just 4 four seater tables in the shop, only to our relief when we read "Chops won't be served in the AC section" (how much of it was true we never enquired).
Order -
Prawn kobiraji cutlet
Fish diamond kobiraji cutlet
Fish fingers
Mutton chop

The cutlets were heavenly. The egg froth being light and crispy not at all oily. The cutlets inside were actually filled with filling unlike many big restaurants. Each of the dishes came served with unlimited salad & home made mustard-sauce.

The fish finger was yummy. Only thing that disappointed us were the mutton chops, the mutton was chewy and hard to cut into. And the batter was a little under cooked.

Only thing I would have preferred doing is to have bottled kasundi instead of their bitter mustard sauce.

Otherwise a very good joint. If you want to a part of Kolkata's food history, this place is to start with. 
If you are a vegetarian you will be disappointed.

Mitra Cafe is a century old restaurant based in the heart of North Kolkata(Near Sovabazar Metro).New generation will thing it as a Modern day Cafe but its much more to that.Ambiance-Its the one of the smallest restaurant you will see in 

North Kolkata.After 5 p.m(its opening time) it is always crowded.You will be lucky to find a place to eat in.Nothing to say about service,as it is a very small place.Food-The selling point is some delicious old recipe that you will find here.

Brain Chop(unique name as it will taste unique too),Fish Fry will bring the taste bud out of you.If you want something heavy then you can try Chicken curry/Chicken Afghani with Bread(try this as it is different that we have in normal restaurant).

In midst of all the international cuisine,these kind of restaurant still serve us with some old and tasty recipe.Every people of North Kolkata( up to 4 generation) has eaten here and still continue to do so.Try it guys/gals,forget the calories one moment and have a bite at history.

it's such a city-inn that's running for a decade & still going strong with increasing crowd & craze. i have heard about this legendary eatery much from my grandpa that if one has not ever visited this place, he must have missed some old-Calcutta charm to taste. so i aimed at going there (though i always felt a little insecure to stay there till late evening as it's situated in shovabazar area) once after a city ride to the heritage sights of Calcutta, i managed to visit this cafe which added to the mood. - the cutlets, the typical Calcutta snacks & fries, ( Diamond fish & fish fries), prawn cutlet, chicken kaviraji - i loved them all. my friends took some side dishes with mutton, mutton mughlai gravy with simple bread slices - they were tasty as well. but i would rather vote for the snack items.

Mitra Cafe – 100+ and not out..

This is one of those Legendary cafes we have got in Kolkata. I am sure every Kolkatan already acknowledges about this cafe and if you are a foodie then you must have visited the cafe. Running an eatery over a 100 years is not a matter of joke. So last month I was fortunate enough to visit the eminent "Mitra Cafe".

The location of this distinct eatery is just opposite to the Shobha Bazar metro station. The cafe is actually petite and there is nothing distinctive about the decor at all.
There was a huge crowd and people were coming continuously till we had completed our bite.
Now the cafe is famous for its snacks and some main coursed dishes, but the peculiar thing is that they don't offer tea or coffee.

This was my first visit and I wanted to try their famed "Brain Chop" but it wasn't available.
So we settled with:
1. Fish Special Diamond Fry - Faaamzing!! 10/10! Loved it! The fish just melted in my mouth.
2. Mutton Kabiraji - It was good. Not Excellent. 8/10
3. Egg Devil - I don't savor eggs, but I tasted and relished the taste. Spicy and awesome. 9.5/10
4. Fish Butter Fry [Take away]: Good but special diamond is really exceptional. 8.5/10
5. Chicken Cutlet - It was okayish. 7/10
Overall I liked the food.

Advantages :
Food, of course
Cost
Service and Behavior

Disadvantages :
Space is little
Waiting queue

You are a foodie and you live in Kolkata then you must definitely visit this eatery. Legend right! :D

One of the must visits of Old Calcutta! If you're a foodie from Calcutta or have visited Calcutta and you haven't visited this place then you should do it right away.

It is a extremely small eatery sort of a place, more like a hole in the wall which expanded to accommodate people to sit. This place has some old Calcutta swagger. Dishing out classics in the blink of an eye, with the kind of stuff that hasn't changed its tastes since decades. 

Dirt cheap and explosive for your taste buds. Visit with  a bunch of friends for the best afghani, rich in gravy with succulent and tender meat, popping hot brain chops and many more. 

This place never disappoints and a must visit if you are in cal! This place is nothing less than a gem.

Highly recommended. Prefer take away during rush hours as getting a place to sit might be tricky.

As people say... One of the oldest wonder of 'Calcutta'... Almost a century old, still live and happening.

The outlet in Shova bajar is the oldest among all their branches. Very small place, congested and of course crowded during peak hours (mainly in evening). Don't expect any fancy kind of ambiance, rather you can smell old north Calcutta over here. Famous for its fried items, I have tried Fish diamond fry (no idea why its called 'diamond'), mutton cutlet, chicken fry and fish afghani. The best was fish afghani, it comes with some spicy kosha gravy and tastes great! Mutton cutlet and fish fry were also good but chicken fry was really disappointing, with bone chicken pieces fried like pakoda only!

Overall the experience was good, can be easily recommended for a pocket friendly meal.

Fish Kabiraji, Chicken Kabiraji, Mutton Cutlet accompanied by a yummy yet too salty sauce made (probably) with peanuts and khus khus. Cost of Rs 200. At 5:30pm on a Friday, no brain chop, chicken chop or mutton devil.

Now that is a snapshot of what I got. The food is really fresh and worth it. Especially recommend the Fish Kabiraji (take my recommendation because I only have fish once in 6 months).

Being an exploring foodie, I was out on a munching spree in Kolkata. I along with my friend visited Mitra Cafe near Sobha Bazar metro station. We were engulfed with the idea of being a perfect Bangali Vojonrosik and the thought of doing justice to the belief. The cafe was pretty small to our surprise. A pair opposite walls were covered with collages of pictures of celebrities who have visited the cafe and that was quite a guarantee to it's fame. We ordered Chicken Kabiraji first which they served in no time with salad that included a thick slice of boiled potato and sauce. The sauce was rather unique and was different from kasundi though it looked somewhat like it. It was just awesome and the layer of  fried egg batter made it even better. After finishing with the Kabiraji we ordered Fish Fry, which was also good but failed to challenge the taste of the Kabiraji. The fish fry was not so thick with a very file layer of good quality fish. No doubt it's one of the heritage eateries of Kolkata.

Mitra Cafe is undoubtedly one of the heritage eateries of Kolkata.Although I have visited the Shyam bazar branch of Mitra cafe on multiple occasions,its only a couple of times that I have visited this particular outlet.Located near Shobha bazar metro station this I gather is the oldest branch.

Mitra cafe is totally old school,with its cramped up cabin like interior,wooden chairs and marble topped tables.There are numerous photos of eminent personalities who have visited this cafe in various eras donning the walls and also not to mention the innumerable newspaper articles on this place.

Coming to the food,Mitra cafe is renowned for its chops,cutlets,kabirajis and fries.Over the years they have more or less managed to maintain the quality of the food and have expanded their menu quite a bit which now includes a number of Indian side dish preparations which one can have with roti or parathas.I normally stick to their fried items which are in general a tad oily but extremely tasty.My all time favourite is undoubtedly the Brain Chop which is absolutely perfect with its crunch crisp external coating and the soft creamy inside.The down side is that it is not always available.But you would find it in this particular outlet more often than not compared to the other outlets.The Fish Diamond fry and the fish kabiraji are legendary preparations and are absolutely worth it.The Devil and the Fowl cutlet are also nice and worth recommending.All in all this place is just perfect for a crunch,tasty,filling typical Bengali evening snack.

The ambience as I have already mentioned is a far cry from the sophisticated modern eateries but then this place has a charm of its own.Hygiene and cleanliness can be an issue for the ones overtly concerned.They do have an ac section inside.The service is quite swift.The prices are pretty reasonable.This branch I feel is slightly less crowded than the Shyam bazar one but here also you would need a bit of luck to get a seat without waiting particularly in the early evening.

Mitra Cafe is a century old establishment which has maintained its individuality and consistency and is surely a place everyone must experience.It is quite apt to say Mitra cafe is heritage on a plate.

sometimes, the best time to write a review about a place is not after you have been there but after you suddenly start to miss it out of the blue.. I live in Bangalore now, and before that, lived in N.Delhi for 5.5 years or so...And I just realised how much I miss this epic place having being away from it! My last visit was in May 2014... Had sudden sensory flashes of their kabirajis, fish roll, and chops.... This place is my foodie landmark in Kolkata in terms of taste & price ONLY... not a fine dine or date spot this !! but it scores in the most important aspect - Taste !! Misshhhing itttttt !!

Mitra Cafe- a name you would generally associate with the inventors of the Fish Diamond Fry,lies diagonally opposite to the Shobhabazaar Metro Station,famously known as the Junk Food Street of Kolkata.

This place is like Old School,interiors are clean but God knows when the walls were last white-washed.So, if you are stepping into this place,do not criticize about the interiors because it's the food that actually makes up a lot for it.

Their ultra speciality the Fish Diamond Fry is a must have for anybody coming here for the first time.Second to that go for the Chicken Breast Cutlet-good in taste,well mixed with spices,but a killer for gym goers and health conscious freaks.
Even after all this if you claim yourself to be a hungry giant go for the Prawn Cutlet.Super tasty and definitely comes in my top 10.
The cooking oil used here is quite good compared to the other restaurants of the locality.

Gulp down all this with a glass of Cola.Unfortunately they have no provision for this inside the restaurant.Better get hold of the waiter and ask him to bring it from an adjacent store/restaurant(tip him if you are feasible with it).

Overall superb location and definitely very good food(no worries of stomach upsets for the least),but it has a lot to catch up with.
Parcel counter operation is still running slow and so is the normal service.Sounds a little laid back,and needs a makeover soon.

Mutton kabiraji the dish I like the most.I had mutton kabiraji from dilkhusha kebin but having mutton kabiraji from Mitra Cafe is heavenly feeling.
Brain chop is as delicious as kabiraji..
Last but not the least is Pudding.A mouth watering desert...

What delightful oily sinful things they serve ! This place is a bengal's legendary destination for 'chop-cutlets', you got to try once if you are a true bengali. I have tried the great fish kabiraji a number of times, and it seems to be the hot favourite of people coming here. Undoubtedly the best amongst all. But this time I experimented with the prawn cutlet and mutton breast cutlet. mutton breast was a bit smelly I did not quite enjoy it but the prawn cutlet was lovely, with big chunks of prawns and a nice batter, I was completely into it !

Come here for an old Kolkata nostalgic feel. You shall love it.
Only drawback: wished you could serve cold drinks with it. it would go sooo well with the cutlets.

 Foods were finger licking good.
we had ordered fish kobiraji which was amazing so 5/5
then paratha n roasted chicken which was also great.. 4.5/5
as we were too hungry so had ordered fish pakora after this stuffs.. :p no confusion that was great too 5/5
p.s. i luved the chutnis they served with the dishes.
p.s. foods are oily so avoid regular visit.
0.5 marks i cut of for the ambience. it is a too small place to run a that much crowded resturant..
but one will surely revisit this place for the foods..

It's reputation is built from the earlier part of the last century when famous personalities used to visit. Lots of mementos and pictures adorn the menu and the wall. It's just bigger than a hole in the wall near the Shobhabajar metro station with few branches popping over the city too. They have an inner Ac room. 
The seating arrangement consists of 3- 4 tables and chairs only and in evening it's well nigh impossible to get a seat. Anyway you need to cram in and have elbow fights with fellow diners all the time. 
The servers are brisk and try to serve as best they can. Still the servers give good suggestions and I appreciate them. Hygiene is not something to search for here. 
I have always tried only few things like diamond fry, the kabirajis, fish chop, diamond fish fry, cutlets etc. This place has been famous for both bengali fast food and moghlai dishes. Never had the eponymous brain chop available. All the items are pretty good but I never found them spectacular. I have never tried the main courses and hence will refrain from commenting on them.  I am equally fond of Kabirajis from Dilkhusha cabin or Allen's. And Aponjon makes excellent Fish chops. But still for the decent and standard bengali street food this will always the heritage place for the upwardly mobile bongs. The chops, cutlets and Kabirajis with kasundi are my hot favourites and reminds me of the younger days. The fish fry has a lot of flesh on the good days. I will rate them 4.0 on taste.
Parking is a personal skill here as it's almost exactly at a very very busy 4 point crossing with a metro station added. No parking lots- just try to hide the car away from the traffic guys in whatever way you can.
Recommended.

I have heard praises of this place from many of my friends,when i finally decided to try it out.
This is a very humble restaurant just opposite to shobhabazar metro station. Mitra cafe is famous for its legendary kabiraji and cutlets.
I had a fish diamond kabiraji and a chicken kabiraji,and believe me or not...i have not had such kabiraji ever. This was the best ....
The crunch of the batter,the tenderness of the fish...would simply make you feel in heaven.
One must order fish and chicken kabiraji,and if   you are going for dinner,then chicken afghani is a must with laccha paratha.
The decor is not special,and the seating capacity is low,so you might have to wait on a festive day or weekend. Nonetheless i assure you,after taking a bite at your kabiraji you would even be ready to wait double the time on your next visit.

I had visited Mitra cafe a while back with a friend. It was chiefly for experiencing the sheer thrill of visiting this legendary place that once was the throb of North Kolkata. Of course, it needs no introduction. On busy weekends, it surely goes back to its glory days, with crowded spaces and packed seats. But on a week day, it offers a sublime getaway from the busy schedule of work-home-work. I found the enigma of this place enticing.on't go by the outer looks and the decor. To be believe me u need to have their kabiraji.

The place is too small...In AC hardly 11 can accommodate and out side only 18-20...But the place is so crowed than its size...

Above all that the place is 100 years old, its a proud of Kolkata....

This is a bit nostalgic and a regular habit of mine, every time I visit Kumartuli with the camera, I make it a point to visit this place may be alone or may be with friends. Be it in the morning or be it in the evening. 
This is a busy place and finding a chair is a bit difficult, if you are lucky then you can manage to get the cabin inside which has an AC, a bit cramped chairs.

There is nothing in the menu card which I have not tried and none of them have disappointed me over the time. Best of them are brain chop, chicken stew, fish kobiraji, Mutton kobiraji, chicken cutlet.

While this is a budget hotel and one can be absolutely full by spending 100 bucks, I have failed to do so every time I visit this place.

The only complaint I have with this place is the behaviour of the staff here. Most of them seem to be uneducated and lack the proper training on how to treat the guests. Apart from that this place is great.

mitra cafe is eternally famous for fish fry, fish rolls, mutton kobirazi etc. we were taking photographs at kumortuli and suddenly felt hungry so decided to stop over at mitra cafe to have some snacks. it's located on cr avenue near sovabazar crossing, so one can't park on the main road. we parked our car in one of the bylanes and then walked there. ordered fish rolls and fish frys as they said those would be quick to prepare. we waited for around 10mins and got our food packed. fish roll was great, very tasty and full of fish. fish fry was a bit hard, probably was fried a bit too deep. next time, i must try mutton kobirazi which is another famous item there.

Mitra cafe is a heritage name in Kolkata for its yummilicious snacks they serve. For me , the make the BEST kabiraji in Kolkata.. whether it is fish..chicken or mutton... The fish fry is good too but Apanjan in Kalighat can compete for this one but Kabiraji that they serve is the Ultimate best dish for me.. I also tried their Prawn cutlet better than the ever popular Allen's kitchen which is just on the opp side of the road.. I have not tried their Brain chop-- another popular dish so cant comment. But waiting to try their Mutton/fish afghani with toast and the pudding once i m in Kolkata.. KEEP IT UP GUYS!!

I loved their chicken cutlet and chop. You are likely to meet a bunch of loyalists every time you visit this place, most of them old , nostalgic , and reminding you why this place is one of a kind ! The space inside is small , cramped , with marble top tables and tiny chairs. The staff are friendly and the  service is fairly quick.

Though they are using the word "cafe" in their name, but now they are not limited to that. different indian preparations are also available now a days. but still if anyone want to feel the vintage cafe of kolkata, try the snacks mainly, it's not biriyani joint. there is  nothing to talk about ambiience or decors, it's certainly not their focus also. seats are a bit clumsy, but those actually maintains heritage too, and everyone should be ok with that. their stuffs are good, will try to assist you at their best if needed.

regarding food, i have almost tried all the snacks preparations here. all of them are quite good, specially fish fry, fish/ chicken kabiraji, chicken cutlet, mutton kassa and chicken afghani. it's tough to resist yourself by ordering only one dish of the above. And obvious, i cannot forget the feeling that sitting in mitra cafe with school friends and having fish fry with a cup of tea/ coffee, it's really the heritage kolkatans' picture. 

i have just one observation to mention, if you are trying to visit there late (after 8 or 8:30 pm), there is a high chance you won't be getting maximum of their dishes including tea even. but as a whole, i would request everyone to try this place at least once to feel the taste, because now a days it's really tough to get these snacks in such pocket friendly price...

P.s. dont go for biriyani as it is a speciality bengali fast food joint.

This little outlet which serves delicious Bengali and Mughlai food, is known to every Calcuttan worth his salt, and yet I had missed out on the experience and taste it offered, till very recently. You would be very lucky to find a seat in the air-conditioned little chamber choc-a-bloc with furniture, if you happen to go on a busy evening. Since we were one of the lucky few, we decided to order to our heart's content. The three of us ordered the very famous Fish Kabiraji, Fish Cutlets, Fish Afghani Roll, Paratha and Chicken Kasha. The Fish Kabiraji totally deserved all the fame it had garnered over the ages, as the crispy bubble-wrap like covering of fried egg encapsulated the deliciously spiced hot fried fish which spread its taste and aroma in me as I bit into it. The Fish Cutlet was, however, a tad too dry and did not match up to our expectations, as we had tasted far better cutlets in lesser known places. The Paratha and Chicken Kasha was good, even though the chicken was too sweet for our liking. The Fish Afghani Roll was extremely disappointing, as it had a very thick layer of mashed potatoes which removed all traces of the taste of whatever little fish there was. Finally, the Pudding that we ordered was hardly a pudding, and was more of an amalgamation of flour and 'sandesh', lined with a streak of chocolate sauce, as though for compensation. While it was good to try out this restaurant for the first time, I am sure I will not go back to it.

Don't go by the outer looks and the decor. To be believe me u need to have their kabirazi and prawn cutlets. I can assure u it's the best in entire Kolkata. Other items are equally good.

Well, north Calcutta has always been famous for heritage places and hotels for food and Mitra Cafe is one of those legendary places. Over a hundred yeards old, Mitra cafe's legacy is well known and widely sppreciated throughout Kolkata. Their fish kabiraji and mutton kosha are of high demand and is often replenished well before 7pm in the evening. The shop is very small with very cosy sitting conditions, one small room for AC sitting area, non AC area is very hot and noisy, but the food is beyond tasty, always fresh and hot. The service is a bit on the downside, strictly because of the fact that it is always crowded and orders always pour in. Apart from that, the food is just too good. I have actually forgotten the menu, the only things I order is the diamond kabirji and mutton kosha. Highly recommended.

Mitra cafe is a legendary place of our city of joy.Whenever i visit here i feel like im back to some bygone era. If u expect ambience,service than please find some other place but if u want amazing food in almost below budget price than this is heaven for u. Kabirajis are the best n brain chop is out of this world. Go explore this jem which has still not lost its charm.
Ambience- it's an old dilapidated joint but people don't come here for that
Food- without doubt it's beyond praise. The food is heavenly specially fish kabiraji,brain chop n fish fry.
Service- good enough
Price- cheap as it may come for the quality of food available.
Overall above reproach just dash for it

Now I have been there twice, but heard about this restaurant for so long, it's became a must visit. Now I have missed the brain chop, because it was finished for that day, but I have tried chicken kobiraji and mutton cutlet. They were the best I have ever ate. But that's not all. Considering my experience about food, I thought I have had enough for evening snacks for that day. But surprisingly, my stomach became greedy after one and half hour. That's the quality you can expect from them. I am eagerly waiting to go there again, this time for the brain chop.

This used to be our thek during college days as this place is bang opposite our college. SO whenever we were hungry and wanted to go somewhere nearby this was the place we used to hang around. I love the chicken afghani here which is served with a loaf of bread. The chicken or fish kabiraji are equally tasty with that dash of crumbled egg layer on top. It very sight is quite inviting and i am sure you will end up eating more than one. The diamond fried fish is a better version of the normal fish fry because you get a thick fillet in this one.  DO not expect a very well decoarated and tip top restaurant as this is a tiny little north kolkata joint which is famous for its food and old style ambiance. it is one of those paraar hotel which has made a niche over the decades and now falls in the category of legendary eateries. this is a favourite place of many bengali artists, filmmaker and actors who used to be regulars here earlier.

Warning: This is no fancy place. Infact this place is very cramped up with a few tables and chairs. 
The food served here is absolutely legendary. Mitra cafe is that vintage restaurant which is still flocked by the connoiseurs of good food. Their legendary Mutton Kosha is served with loafs of toasted bread which is a very well known delicacy. You have to visit this place a little early for the Brain Chop which will again titilate your taste buds. 
I personally did not like their Diamond Fish Fry. It was ordinary like any other place. But the kosha mangsho is a tad better than that of Golbaris. 
Try visiting this place a bit early, at around 4.30 to relish everything that is there on the menu.

So one fine evening we three ravenous friends decided to visit this outlet. It was 5 pm and the outdoor portion was already full, so we went for the indoor AC area. However, just upon entering a stench reduced our hunger pangs somewhat. Nonetheless, we ordered two chicken kabirajis, one diamond kabiraji, and for the more daring one (me) a brain chop. Kabirajis were very good, and I personally liked the chicken ones over the fish. Now the brain chop, I know it's quite hyped there, I myself didn't like all that much.  Though I think most of the blame for that goes out to my two friends grossing me out while I was eating it, and a bit to the little pieces of bone inside the chop. The kabirajis were humongous though, and one is quite enough for a meal of a medium-appetite person. Finally, the dessert was one very nice and authentic tasting choco pudding each, and the pocket pinch was only 400 for a meal for three. Value for money I must say! Though the ambiance could really use a renovation. Compared to other authentic places like Paramount, this place is quite a bit dingy.

Mitra Café is situated on Jatindra Mohan Avenue .The external appearance is shabby with marble-topped tables, wooden benches and the restaurant has failed to upgrade its look with times. It is small two-and-half-room size. 
Kabiraji Cutlets, Fish Fry are my favorite. Food is good but at times one has to wait to get a seat.

Good place to have a bite if you are feeling nostalgic. Went for a quick bite yesterday and I would say I had mixed experiences. Although the food was good and they offered a great variety yet one thing that was disappointing was the service. Quite slow given the number of people who were serving. Had to be nagged quite a few times to get the food. Liked the Kabiraji although I would prefer a Kabiraji from Dilkhusha (in college street) any time.  Would like to try out again after some time! Hope it better the next time.

If you want nice and cool ambience..mitra cafe is not the right destination for you certainly..but if you are looking for good fast food..its the place for you. The seating arrangement is not comfotable..the cafe itself is quite small spacewise..but all is compensated by good kabirajis and cutlet...though its almost always crowded..the service is brisk...the place has a old world charm..with age old fan and chairs and table..but you have a completely different oriental feeling about this place..when you  have your brain chop...or say cutlet..mitra cafe is like a man who means business without any pretension...

After reading a lot about this restaurant I decided to visit this place. It's located at a very convenient position bang opposite the Shovabazar metro station. 
There are two sections : a non ac and ac one. The ac one has two tables and be ready to share it with others. The ac wasn't working and it looked like it was decades old along with the restaurant.

We ordered a diamond fish fry and a chicken kabiraji first. 
The fish fry was pretty standard. The fish was fresh and had good taste. The kabiraji had nice crunchy outer covering. Tasted good.

Then we ordered a mutton afghani and lacha parathas. The afghani looked nice but the mutton was tad tasteless. The parathas were nice though.

The bill was around 300. So the price is quite cheap.

Verdict: A quite overrated restaurant. Runs on heritage and pricing rather than food quality.

Zomato has very appropriately made Mitra Cafe a part of its Legendary Collection. I have been here innumerable time as have many many more Kolkatans for generations together. Everyone has their own personal favourites here and I am no different. 
I can never get fed up of the fish fry, the fish diamond fry, the mutton breast cutlet, the mutton kabiraji cutlet and the mutton kasha. My ultimate favourite is of course the brain chop but they make very few of those and very frequently they are sold out by the time I can manage to reach Mitra Cafe after getting through the congested Central Avenue traffic.
The value one gets for one's money is close to unbeatable. The service is almost always quick and efficient. This place is in a league of its own and in my opinion will always remain a class apart.

After reading so many good reviews I went there on last Friday. But honestly saying I'm very dissapointed with this place. Ordered chicken kaviraji and fish diamond fry. The chicken of the kaviraji was not soft. The diamond fry didn't live upto my expectation. I was sitting in a small AC room which was quite suffocating and that was not because of the size but for a bad smell of that closed room. Besides the AC was not working good. I would suggest you all to sit in the non AC room especially the claustrophobic person.

One of the finest bangali snack shop. The seating is a bit congested ..old kolkata cabin-like.. whats the best good news? The food is excellent. Try the chicken stew. Sumptuous n easy to digest. Their famous fish kabiraji tastes awesome. N their delicacy the brain chop.. a must-try in a life time.  The brain chop gets over by 6pm . So try to comr down before that. Or u can go in for fish afghani n lachchha paratha.

I cannot count how many times I have been to this legendary food cafe. This place defines the heritage and tradition of Kolkata.It is catering to Kolkata people for more than 100 years now. It is not a easy task to survive that long period with same charm and appeal to its customers.I was first introduced to this joint by my father when I was a mere kid. From then it was a never ending bond for me with this food joint. Even in this era of pizza and burgers the young generation still craves for its food,It offers some of the most iconic and delicious food items like brain chop,mutton afghani cutlet, fish chinese,fish roll,chicken roast etc. Time has passed but the quality of those items never degrades. I always tell my friends who come to kolkata to visit this place and savour its delicious dishes. This eatery is very close to my heart and will always be a chart-topper for me.

Situated near the crossing of shovabazar and grey street, it is very much close to my mamar bari, and Heavenly food, these are the two reasons of my affinity to this age -old joint....
My fav from their list-
Vegetable chop
Fish/chicken mughlai (dnt b mistaken as mughlai paratha)
Fish fry
Fish /chicken kobiraji
Mutton stew
Very tasty food, pocket friendly n value for money....but people who count calories and health conscious...,.will be a bit disappointed.
Overall rating:-4/5
Second review:-(visit date:-10.09.2015)
For the first time,i have dined in this place.They have now an ac section,but in the peak time,around 7 pm,it was quite difficult to get a seat over there.So,my friend and i opted for non ac section.Quite cramped an unclean was the place.But the waiter cleaned it faster and the service was lightening fast despite so much varied orders of the crowd!!
My orders:-
1)Vegetable chop:-yummy and very heavy on stomach!!
2)Chicken afghani:-A large chicken cutlet,smeared with special gravy.!!Soft and succulent meat it was!!Served with salad and we ordered four chapati with it,it was ample enough to serve to person!!

Then got a call from home,and took away one fish kabiraji(1 pc.),fish fry(2 pcs) and fish diamond fry(1 pc) for my parents an guests!!
My bill was around 600/-(aprx.)!!
Will visit once again for dine in and will opt for ac section!!

Oh! Super Sunday ......thanks all my friends.. Fast we ordered Chicken Kabiragii . I was so soft and lovely fried...& that was awesome.  After that one of my friend suggested Mutton Afghani ..which was never tried before. When the dish arrived we could not resist ourselves. In short this dish is one of my favorites now. 4.5/5 for the food only. Great place to have evening snacks.

I have heard about this place for a very long time. One can even find its presence in the Bengali literature. Many think that they have pioneered the business of chop and cutlet in Calcutta. When I entered into the place, I was really amazed by their prompt service which I didn't expect at all. The place may look bit dilapidated but there should not be any doubt over the quality of the food. Specifically, the fowl cutlets which I had with my family, is no doubt a treat for our taste-buds. And, I am going to traverse their menu card in the coming days on a regular basis while sitting at their old and vintage cafe. Mitra Cafe, be careful I am coming!!!!

If you love things like Chop & Cutlet, you will definitely love this place. MITRA CAFE located near the shovabazar metro station. I had been there on numerous occasions. My all-time favourite was their Fish Diamond Kabiraji & Fish Diamond Fry. The Diamond Kabiraji had a nice crunch, even though they aren't too hot, and melt in your mouth. Fish Diamond Fry was simply amazing, you will never had a fish fry like this. I will also recommend their Brain Chop & Devil. I know its simple food but, it's done right and in a very welcoming atmosphere. Hope you get to try it out & you surely will not regret it!

With the advent of modern day cafes in kolkata, we tend to forget the cafes that had shot to prominence long before ccd or barista become household names. 
Almost a hundred years old, mitra cafe still manages to hold its forte, and for genuine reasons.
The chicken/ mutton kabiraji, prawn cutlet, or for that matter the humble moghlai paratha served here are a class apart. And there's the chocolate pudding to pamper your sweet fetish
To relish such ageless dishes, you have to pay a visit here. Located near the sovabazar metro station, its a small neat place, with friendly staff at your service always.
Dont go by the looks of the place. People who have once been here, usually drop in more than once.
The only issue is finding a place to seat at the peak evening hours :-)

One of the best places to get a heavy dose of fried delights. If you love meat, this is a place for you. You'll find the typical kabiraji, moglai, pakoras, cutlets and every sort of those things you can dream of better than most other places here. They have kept it the same for years now and that's the catch for me. I love the Kabiraji here, its spectacular. Although I have eaten better moglai in places that are not nearly as famous as this one. But surely, this is one eatery I'l love to go back again and again.

Mitra Cafe(Sovabazar)-what can I say about this nearly century old eatery? Well,actually a lot! I have been visiting this place for the last 6 years(sporadically though in the last 3).Like many of the quintessential north calcuttan food joints,the outer appearance doesn't do justice to the delicacies served inside.Coming to the food there are many mouth watering dishes like brain chop,egg-mutton devil,fish chop,fish//prawn/mutton/chicken cutlet/kabiraji/afghaani,diamond fry,chicken soup to just name a few.The dishes are more or less cooked to perfection and together with its aroma it is more than enough to make up for the cramped atmosphere inside.The service is prompt and many prefer takeaways due to the space constraints.I would have given it a 5 star,but its over aggressive marketing policy,leading to inevitable price rise, in recent times has not gone down too well with the frequent visitors including me.Still Mitra Cafe with its network of outlets is playing its part in taking the authentic north calcuttan culinary traditions to other parts of the city.

How could I forgot to write about Mitra Cafe though I have visited this place many times. It's an old restaurant which is situated in the place for more than a decade. They have another branches situated in many places of kolkata but this one is older than others. 

Location :- the restaurant is situated in the crossing of shovabazar & grace Street, opposite of shovabazar metro station. 

Ambience :- The place is very small to have in the food. It has only 4 table which is generally all time packed up & one another AC Room with four table seating. If u want to visit in a weekend or public holiday keep in mind that u will have to wait. After getting the seat & having the food u will not regret. The staff behavior is good & they deliver the food in reasonable time. Overall, 3.5/5.

Food:- The best place in kolkata to have some cutlets. .They also serve main course. Try their chicken roast. It taste awesome. They are delicious & mouthwatering. 

Chicken kabiraji :- perfectly fried, less oil I found. Taste too good that I couldn't resist myself to order another one. Size is also good.  Overall,  5/5.

Chicken afgani :- it's served with a gravy. Taste awesome but it contain too much oil. Best to have it with lachaa parataha. Mind blowing . overall, 4.5/5.

Parataha :- tasty, crispy, not oily. In one word perfect. 

The Mitra Cafe has enough reputation in kolkata & people visit this place not only for their goodwill but also for the quality & variety of delicious cutlets & other food they served. If you didn't visit yet, go & have their food & u will also be a regular of their place like me.

This place at Jatindra Mohan Avenue (opposite Sutanati-Sovabazar Metro Rail Station) was founded by Shri Sushil Roy in the year 1920. Shri Roy derived the name "MITRA" from 'Friends' as they considered all customers as 'FRIENDS'. I heard about Mitra Cafe from my grandfather and then from my father. 

Mitra cafe is a small shop some 100 years old. The shop has two sections - outer section (with some 5-6 wooden benches) and an inner room (which was Air-Conditioned and had a capacity to accommodate 12 people). We went there in the evening and it was jam packed. Not only were all the seats filled in, there was a crowd of people waiting and with every passing second more people were joining into the din. We were eight and somehow managed eight seats in the air-conditioned room after a considerable wait.

As we hurriedly occupied the seats in the inner room, the smell, flavours of food made us more hungry. Some of us had eaten only half full that lunch so that there is room for the evening extravaganza. All our efforts were handsomely rewarded. What a food, what taste, we were just carried away. Here are some of the specialities which we tried:

1) Chicken Kabiraji 
2) Mutton Kabiraji 
3) Fish Kabiraji
4) Prawn Cutlet
5) Fish Afghani
6) Chicken Roast Special (highly recommended)
7) Pudding (Highly recommended)

Overall, the food was awesome and prices very reasonable. If you want to have great mouthwatering food, at reasonable price along with a dose of 100 years of nostalgia, this is the place to be.

If u really wanna have some great fishfry and kabiraji then this is heaven..after a long time i had the opportunity today of visiting this place and loved the age old tradition of mitra cafe..previously as a kid used to come here with my uncle..it is a small outlet and the name is very prominent as u cross the shobha bazar area..

we ordered for fish fry,prawn cutlet and chicken kabiraji...and omgggggg its heavenly and tastes awesomeee..i guess they make world's best kabiraji and fish fry..it was finger licking good ..fishfry with the kashondi is a treat in itself and i was longing for this perfect kabiraji for long which i got today..i am bowled over by the food they offer...

the management people are cordial and servers were friendly..many young old all kinds of people comw here..i loved the ambience and obviously the food..and will be going there soon again..!:)

Have visited this place wenever I am in mood of some fries,cutlets or anything which makes my taste buds feel nice. Chicken Kabirazi and Fish Kabirazi is one of their famous dishes and i tried it tons of time. Other than that I have tried their Brain Chop(made out of Goat's brain) seems a bit nasty and ewww but trust me its really tasty, then I have tried their Cutlet, Bread and Chicken Curry etc etc and I never had complains from this place except getting sitting place easily. The place is a bit small and so it is hard to get a seat in the peak hours. But overall my experience is really nice everytime I have gone to this place.

How in God's name did I miss writing a review for this century old legendary eating house in our city I don't know ! This place is one of those places frequented by generations of the same family .. I know for a fact that my grandfather and father have visited it and yours truly of course ! The Mutton Kabiraji is my personal pick as is the Brain Chop which alas not always available. I like the Kosha Mangsho as well actually prefer it to the one they serve at Gol Bari . Chicken Cutlet is another good pick. However go only for the love of food not ambiance which is very simple and old school. Writing me makes me feel like paying a visit soon as its been a while since I had their lovely Mutton Kabiraji !!!!

Wanted to try this place for a long time.Went there with my partner on a weekday evening.Surprisingly the small cabin inside was half empty.The place is not at all comfortable to seat properly for a tall people like me but who cares!!its the food that matters????????coming to that,the famous brain chop was out of stock.we opt for the chicken roast with toast as recommended by @poorna Banerjee,chicken kabiraji and fish diamon fry.The food came quickly.The roast was out of the world nd it goes best with bread and paratha.The portion is huggge!!The kabiraji is also good but its second to dilkhusha kabin for me.The diamond fry is also very good with generous amount of fish fillet.For dessert they insisted for the pudding.We hv tried,one can easily skip it and stick to the savoury items.Long live my old Kolkata eateries.

I dont believe I have not rated Mitra Cafe yet. Atleast this outlet.
Yes, this legendary cafe stands proudly on Shobhabazar. Looks shanty but can give you a run for your money.
Ruchira had first introduced me to this cafe. (how grateful I am to her)
I remember walking up with her to this shanty joint and I was pretty cross with her. I had twiched my nose and said that I wont go in because the food might not be good (and hygienic)

The space is cramped and you might have issues with sitting and eating here but wait hold on.
Wait till you order a kabiraji or a cutlet (fish or chicken or mutton) and just hold on for 5-8 minutes and what will appear on your table will blow you away!

HUGE in size and pretty inconsiderate on the stomach, you will love the cutlets and the kabiraji here. And the prices are inversely proportional. Good isnt it ?
I love their chicken cutlet and they also have a mustard sauce with it which is good.

Coming back again and again , Cheers! :)

Authentic bengali food but too oily for my liking. I will not vote for a fish fry that appears straight from the frying pan oil pouring. Its not worth a try if you need to spend a lifetime at the gym. I also believe they need to increase their veg options

Being a resident of north kolkata and a foodie at heart.. it was late on my part to visit and review one of the assets of north kolkata.... yes "mitra cafe".... a first food preference of north kolkata which has been tested by time.... it still stands strong enough and its recipes are still a mystery.... clumpsy and claustrophobic along the dingy lanes of old kolkata -as it may seem to a kfc or ccd lover.... but mitra cafe creates its own charm.... all sorts of chops are just superb.... brain chop is its usp.... it also serves desserts well in the form of choco pudding.... deserves 4.... long live mitra cafe....

I have heard about Mitra Cafe since childhood and have been there on numerous occasions. My latest visit was last week with a bunch of office folks...some of whom have never been there before. And for those who haven't do not expect much in terms of decor and amenities. 

Coming to the food part: Here are a list of must eat items:

Chicken and Mutton kabiraji
Mutton Afghani
Chicken Afghani
Prawn Cutlet...one of the best I have had.
Chicken Cutlet
Brain Chop
Egg devil.

A tip: Most of the snack items like devil and brain chop get exhausted pretty early. So a best time to visit Mitra Cafe is around 5PM in he evening. Enjoy some lip smacking delicacies and get high on nostalgia! A double thumbs up to the food.

There are few places which only deserve to be introduced by people who are as much a name in itself as the café which has been here for some 103 years....To be introduced to the legendary Mitra Café by the grandson of the Benimadhob Sil(yes the person famous for the ful panjika). Abhiron my school and bachelor degree classmate introduced me to this place while I was going to his house one day.
Mitra café has been a name every family's seniors will tell you about... I came back and told my dad I had been there for the first time and what greeted me was sheer shock at the fact that my first time was so late.
Then after that had been here many times...One of the very few places which can get me out of my house, catch the metro, go there for food and come back....All the way just for some lip smacking delicious food....That had been the case till something changed in my life and I started looking for good cafes to sit and chat rather than go for food...In between tried out their Golpark one was so dissatisfied I did not venture again that far. Now that, that phase has ended I wanted to visit it again....A little background check from Poorna's review and a few friends and I was ready to go.
My all-time favourite is dry mutton and fish chop. I also prefer their devil a lot...They serve the fried items with a chutney or sauce which is a mixture of cream and mustard...Sweet and tangy awesomeness served with salad and a slice of boiled potato.  Another favourite here is the prawn cutlet and chicken roast…. 
All this had stayed till I tried the mutton Afghani on this last visit of mine which was yesterday and I might rate it among the best… 
In short a place where if food is your priority then you have too many options and can never really go wrong….
A 4.5 with no décor from me for a café where you have to share tables and the place is averagely decorated must have that good food and so it does….
Cutouts, bindings hang on the place in the walls with marble topped tables which have so little space to get into it for tall people like me and a LCD displays all their interviews and news coverages and too many staff maybe even more than needed.
They even have catering which is very good and rather cheap.
Go there and try out the food there and you will never be disappointed.

I just realized I haven't reviewed Mitra Cafe yet. Or at least, not this outlet. This one is my favorite. You go inside, order a chicken roast, and the man lovingly looks at you, packs it for you, and says, "bosh ma, anekdin pore eli!" (sit down my girl, you have come here after a long time!) ... even if your last venture was only a month back. I don't know if it is a marketing strategy, but it works. I think I have tried everything on the menu by now, and here is what I LOVE - 

Brain Chop

Mutton Afghani

Chicken Roast

Diamond Fry (Fish)

Mutton Kabiraji

Mutton Breast Cutlet

Also, the fowl cutlet on good days. But definitely the Roast for me, especially when it comes with butter toast. That is, for me, comfort in a plate.

Kolkata is a city that has many milestones in the history of food. A city that was the capital of the british raaj also had the advent of the first ever cafes of the country . MITRA CAFE is one such landmark.  They have been around for over a hundred years. Founded in 1910 it still is quite a hangout . 

Being able to live that long as a product defies all laws of business. The secret : consistency . They have been featured in papers, have been frequented by celebs, covered on television and yet they re simple and humble . 

Located very near the shovabazar metro station this cafe is more of a food cabin ... on the lines of a dilkhusha or a golbari but much much better. 

marble top tables wooden benches and chairs... old framed news papar cuttings ... and the smell of fried goods in the air is simply very nostalgic. People usually share tables  as the place can get quite crowded ,

Coming to service.... for they stuff they serve and the demand they have .... BRILLIANT job. the staff is quick and efficient. dont expect hygiene, one needs to let the hair down once in a while and just enjoy the food. 

The stars of the menu :

The Brain Cutlet ( when available ) 
The perfect combination of crunch and creaminess 

The Foul Cutlet 
not something that i like too much but most people love it.its a tad bit bland for my liking 

The Devil (Personal Favorite and my rating best in the city )
spicy  boiled egg cutlets with a hint of sweetness with gingery undertones SPOT ON!

The Kosha mangsho 
very different from the spicy gol bari variety and the oily dilkhusha variety. Its mild tender and light ... One can comfortable eat six chapatis without getting heart burns 

Vegetable Chops 
One of the highest selling varieties. 

To top it all ... they serve this mind blowing white chutney that just rounds off everything so well ... and lots of chopped salad 

The Bengal tele bhaja connections are centuries old and the quintessential Bengali loved his cafes from time immemorial.. 

Kusdos ! Mitra Cafe  is nothing but history on a plate.

I crib about kolkata a lot. but then there are things which dissolve the quarrel between me and my city. and one such arbitrator is mitra cafe.
where in the world do you get chicken soup for 2 bucks? not to mention brain chop thats all gooey and yumm! from mutton afghani to fish diamond kobiraji to chicken fry and the lesser known (only to our generation) chocolate pudding..mitra cafe is one of those things about our city we should be real proud of!

One of my old favourites. I am simply in love with their mutton afgani served with toast. I love their egg devil & their fish kabiraji as well. Being a South Kolkata resident i can only manage to go their once in a while ( located opposite to Shovabajar Metro Station) & alas can't try all of my favourites together for my medium appetite :( There's always a lack of seat no matter what time in the evening you arrive & hence be prepared to wait to try the gravy items unless you don't mind  standing on the footpath & munching on their fried stuffs! So much for their original taste & cordial non fancy but helpful stuffs !!

Who loves traditional essence with such quality food in a pocket friendly environment, for his/her, the best food junction in Kolkata. Very traditional and they serve really good food like Kabiraji, Cutlet, Pakora, Moghlai Porota etc. But their specialty is Brain Chop, every one should have a try.

Very crowded and small crammed place, apparently very unimpressive just like their opposite neighbour (allen's kitchen), but, if you know two Ws (what and when), you feel the capacity. Wow, brain chop is heaven, but, during my 10/12 times try, I've found it only for 4/5 times, I can remember the last time, they even didn't open, we knocked on their kitchen beside and requested for preorder before opening ( because otherwise you won't get it here), and lucky to get only 5 pieces out of 8 we ordered. Please try their cutlets and mutton afgani and stew also, price is pretty high compared to their look, but, hey, they don't care about look, rather on food, and thus I feel the price is ok. Although I must admit, the brain chop is very much underpriced (it was 20 bucks probably when I bought last time, very cheap), specially when you compare other very few brain items around Kolkata (anarkali in Metro gali: brain curry, brain roll in zeeshan). Definitely a heritage and show stopper.

kabirazi lovers must try this place. Not only kabirazi but also diffrent cutlet and chops are gr8 over here. Visited countless times over there just for the "Fish/Chicken kabirazi", "Chicken/Mutton Cutlet" and "fish afgani". just awesome taste of every item. They have maintained their quality since years. Moreover I must say you must try at least once their special "Choco Putting". Take away or digg in whatever you like. Only 8-10 sitting arrangements are there but who cares if you are not thing about diet then just try their food. All foodies must try Place.

Chingri Cutlet is this resturaunts  piece de resistance. Juicy sweetness of tiger prawns in crispy golden batter is very good. This fish n chips inspired dish put  a new twist to the mundane British dish and is a gem of Indian colonial cuisine. Mitra Cafe's vegetable shop is very nice indeed.
This joint,being next to Sonagachi, is not in the most salubrious part of Kolkata  but quality and uniqueness of the food more than compensates from that drawback.

A heritage resturant in Kolkata.There is a story about mitra cafe.Now, where the cafe is situated ,many years ago a person gave the property to his best friend as a gift and then the friend established a cafe which named Mitra cafe as a memorian of friendship.Here Mitra is not a bengali surname,it significance the synonyms of Friend in bengali.
It attracts specialy for hot & spicy various cutlets.Recently I eat fish kabiraji,chicken cutlet,both are filled with the awesomeness.Mitra cafe represents many other dishes for vegeterian.Conjested place is the main problem of this cafe.

On a quest to taste all the heritage eateries of Calcutta two Calcuttans ended up at the famous cafe located on Jatindranath Avenue right opposite to the Shovabazar metro station towards Girish park on the right hand side of the road. At about 6 p.m. there was an overwhelming number of people waiting to be seated and at first we though we would have to pack all the glorious snacks but then suddenly two seats opened up and we were shown to a tiny room which was air conditioned. Though tiny the place is quite neat. As is the characteristics of most North Calcutta buildings the floor is made of beautiful big marble slabs. There is a smiling enthusiastic server and the menu is long and to appreciate the cafe one must stick to certain food items. We decided on the 'Chicken fry' and ordered two plates of it. It was quite disappointing . At Rs90 there were 6 pieces which had been dipped in a basic batter made of gram flour (besan) and deep fried. The chicken hadn't at all been marinated except in salt and turmeric. Nevertheless I decided on packing Chicken cutlets and Chicken kabiraji ,the old specialties of Calcutta. these items defines the typical Calcutta snacks. It was only once I had returned  home that I bit into the heavenly taste of the chicken kabiraji. With taste as good as what I had it can beat any snack any day. In all its oily glory (since it had gone half cold ) my first bite made me realize what had kept this tiny shop so popular. A large piece of chicken marinated perfectly with ginger, garlic and onions with a crisp egg white batter. I re-fried the kabiraji ( for about 20 seconds) and the result was a delicious meal. The taste of the Chiken cutlet is unique and with snacks such as these I wonder how any modern junk food survives. As mentioned by my fellow member the sauce they serve has a strange taste which my palate did not like one bit. It probably had peanut and was a disaster. The good old kasundi (Bengali style mustard sauce) would be the perfect accompaniment to these delicious snacks. Surprisingly they serve boiled potato along with onions and a few pieces of beetroot and cucumber as their relish. One piece of snack is enough for en entire meal if you have a medium appetite and it is paired with something else and in all cases the serving size is very satisfactory. Having read enough about the dearth of fish all across the country and across the globe I tend to stay away from fishy items these days on a premonition of disappointment. Perhaps given the situation of the market it is best that one stays away from fishy items but then again I am extremely choosy about my quality of fish. My advice would be to chose the dishes carefully that is sticking to the old items such as kabiraji, Cutlet, Afgani etc and enjoy food in all its glory from a historical time.

This place is not for someone who visits McD, Pizza hut, KFC regularly. bcoz it's crowdy, just opposite the main road, not spacious enough, many people generally queue up in front of ur table to get a seat asap while u are eating. (yes, that's how the craze is like) 
But... (There is always a but) :)
   But, if u can ignore the above facts and want to looooooose urself into lip smacking spicy snacks, like the Fish fries, Kabiraji, Mutton chops, Chicken/mutton afgani. THIS IS THE PLACE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.
   And don't you dare come out of this place without having their special pudding. Trust me on this one. It's cuboid shaped, top half yellowish bottom half choco colored and topped with raisins/strawberries, and the best part it's not too much sugary. You can enjoy the sweetness.
   The prices are not sky high. Last i visited, the foul afgani was Rs 50, bread Rs 5 per piece (most probably) and the pudding was Rs 30. Reasonable enuff, don't you think?
   Bottom-line, if ambiance is not your first priority but delicious food is then it's a must-visit place.
   My Recommendation: Foul Afgani, Bread,Chanar Pudding.
Enjoy the food..... :)

A really small place, but one of Calcutta's classic age remainder. Still there are people who visit the place everyday to have a bite of a chop or have lunch. They have this little AC cabin with two tables too. The place is old and shabby; service is not too great either, though people are friendly. But then the food is tasty and very cheap. Mutton Afgani is a must try, because what they served me was really nice. The Brain Chop is famous there. But I didn't really want to eat brain, so I left it out. But it's famous, hence one can try if he wants.
And there is a big framed photograph of Anjan Dutta having his time there. Not to mention, Uttam Kumar used to go there. The place is worth a visit for the nostalgia if not the food.

This is the original Mitra Cafe and it is the only branch in which almost all the items on the menu can be found on a regular basis. Though it is cramped, that does not detract from the chop-house atmosphere of the place. The place opens after five p.m., but gets very crowded and items like the Brain Chop sell out within an hour or so.

Most of the items on the menu are very good. I have been there many times and have found the Brain Chop and the Mutton Afghani to be very good. However, fish fries and the various Kabiraji cutlets on offer are also good. The standard sauce served with the chops, cutlets and fries is a little peculiar. Personally, I'd prefer kasundi. An interesting dessert available there is the Chocolate Pudding, which is made from chhana. The main dishes should be accompanied by toast, not parathas or rotis.

The place is always very crowded, and fastidious eaters might want to pack food and bring it home. However, since most of the items are to be eaten hot and re-heating rarely brings out the original taste, this option is limited to people who live nearby.

Located diagonally opposite the Sovabazar Metro station this place is a fry lover's paradise. It is not open from 11 AM - 11 PM. It remains open for a short time in the morning offering a limited menu of toast and omelette. But for the real items you will have to wait till 4:30 PM when it reopens. And forget 11 PM, you wont get most of the items, which are in demand, even post 6 / 6:30 PM.

Almost all their items are worth trying, but my personal favourites are Fish Pakora, Prawn Kabiraji, Fish Afgani, Mutton Kosha and Chicken Stew. For the last three don't order the Lachchha Paratha or Roti. Try the bread instead. End with the Chocolate Pudding.

The signature dish of Mitra Cafe is not for everyone. If you are adventurous enough try their Brain Chop. Excellent in one word. But you need to order before 6 PM.

I personally do not like the sauce they serve with the fries. But if you ask them they would give you Kasundi instead which is the best thing to accompany the fries.

The place remains crowded most of the time and its tough to get a seat. You need to share table with strangers. Service is good considering the crowd.

Only one negative is all their gravy items use the same gravy. So the Mutton Kosha and Fish Afgani Gravy tastes the same. Not a big problem though because gravy items are few and all the fries taste great.

If you have ever heard about Cutlets , Chops, kabiraji , mutton kosha, and assumed where to have. Then i would suggest this place called "Mitra Cafe" based near sovabazar metro crossing.

Their main and best item is "Brain Chop" which is just yum and has been a secret for ages. This joint is being running since more then 50 years and have served many celebrities who throng just to have mutton kabiraju or prawn cutlet.

Yes, you will not find nice decorated ambience nor sophisticated furniture but their staff's behaviour can give any well known big restaurant a run for their money.

Mitra Cafe, the name is sufficient enough to the ones who love to eat. Must try - mutton kabiraji, mutton brain chop (made with goat brain), fish diamond fry, prawn kabiraji, fish finger, chicken fowl cutlet, mutton afghani with bread toast, chincken stu. And last but not the least pudding. The only negative - this place is a bit small and u may need to wait a bit to experience the divine food. So go on a Sunday evening (be there within 5pm, else u will miss some of the best delicacies) and enjoy one of the best eateries in Kolkata.

One of the oldest eateries of Kolkata. Not a place for fine dining or anything, nor a place to expect great service. But their Kobiraji Cutlet, maybe not the best in town, but it is very delicious. 
They have an a/c room for special people, like the couples as the place is over crowded with commoners. Apart from nostalgia not a very great place or not a very bad place either.
