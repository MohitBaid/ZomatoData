We were looking for a decent place to dine and have a small adda too, seven of us, somewhere near Howrah Maidan and we zeroed in on the place. Decent ambiance, mainly families in a Sunday evening and prompt service. We had Tandoori rotis, Kaali dal, butter naan, chicken bharta and mutton Rogan josh. Surprisingly fresh and hot dal and rotis, the mutton was good too. A nice place.....
