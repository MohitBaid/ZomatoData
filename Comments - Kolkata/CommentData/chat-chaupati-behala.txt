Great place, serves good food. I recommend you try a few of the items on the menu. The sandwiches are good. So is the pasta. If you're looking for something from puchkas, the dahi puchka is good and they use mineral water for it. Quite hygienic.

So, Chat Chaupati was the eatery I planned to hit this Sunday evening( 17.07.2017)
Location: Buroshibtala Main Road, opposite to Lila petrol pump, Kolkata
Ordered: 1.pasta in white sauce.. 2. Aloo dum
Quality: 1.That pasta was heavenly in taste. They used generous amount of butter and mayonnaise along with corn, capsicum and bell paper to make the pasta then layered that with cheese. I was simply drooling over the pasta.
2.Now, let's come to aloo dum. Tanginess was good, but salt was little bit on the higher side. I felt less oil could be used in aloo dum.

Ambience: The eatery is set up in an open place. CC provide tools for foodies to take seat. But it's highly recommended to make arrangements foot some table also. The most impressive part is they have maintained proper hygiene.
Pocket pinch: reasonable!!! ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡. The pasta costs â‚¹80 , that can be shared by two. (Oh! I had to take a long walk after finishing it aloneðŸ˜ž) Ratings: 4/5 (specially for that pasta)
Thought this is not related to the post, but there is a shop located under the same apartment Chat Chaupati is set up and they have stocked up trendy clothes at reasonable price.
Will surely visit the place again to taste the other stuffs from their menu and update the content after trying them

If anybody is in search of different kinds of chats in an around New alipore, then this place should be checked out. They have a wide variety of chats and all  taste so good too. They use only fresh veggies and things in their items which is another plus point. Would recommend people to try this place and experience the sumptuous taste for themselves.

I found this chat adda with the help of my friends. I have been there almost 5-6 times. Too tasty food with reasonable price. Price may seem a bit high when seen first compared to other chat shops. But after you taste the food and found the hygienic environment there, I am sure you would love it. Veg cheese sandwich is my favourite which comes in only Rs 60. But the main point of attraction is the "phuchka with mineral water".  I would suggest every one to go and try at least once. Next time you would be compelled to write a good review for the CC.

It has got a mela type set up..especially the ice gola counter which I liked the most..
with a variety of chats,phuchka n pasta available.
Good family type ambience.
Idle for those cravings to have something chatpata during the evening time.
I personally tried the tikki chat and I liked it.
Open air sitting arrangements.
And if you are someone who is concerned about hygiene just like me,then I must tell you that here mineral water is used for the phucka.

Doesn't matter if you're a Veg or Non-Veg. Food served here is healthy & prepared keeping the hygiene  factor in mind. If you taste the food and compare the price with other outlets, no one can serve the quality food matching the price Chat Chaupati offers. Yummy. I wish to visit this place again.
