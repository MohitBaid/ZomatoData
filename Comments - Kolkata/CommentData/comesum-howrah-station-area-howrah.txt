A Causal Dining, North Indian and Chinese restraunt situated near the waiting area in the Old Howrah Station. This place is heaven for travellers who arrive very early for their train or for those whose trains get delayed for unexpected time. It will serve you all sorts of cheap food mean to say its a pure Value for Money. They also serve train delivery at “011-41100100”.
                                                                ...

Poor and most pathetic food.Heavy price for not so deserving food quality.Never go for parcel of food here they provided me with smelly food.
Poorest environment and hygiene.
Staff behavior is horrible. You can try foods with much hygiene in Food plaza,KFC,etc in Howrah station.

clean.. hygienic..have a variety of items to choose from.. but probably over priced.. obviously you got other better and cheaper options to choose from when you at howrah.. but.. its quite spacious and gives you a breather and that's what they charge for..

In short, sasta-sundar-tikau. You won't get any better food in Howrah station area. Either you take it as a challenge or entrepreneurs might get up and sit back to see it as an opportunity. Round the clock food availability is the biggest positive thing of this joint. Recommendation: Do you really have a choice?

This place is mainly to fill your tummy before going for a long train journey or after one. We went there after getting down from falaknama express from our trip to vizag. We had a malai lassi, egg chicken haka noodles, dry chilli chicken and a kulfi faluda. Overall it was a good experience. But I felt that the proportions were miniscule when compared to the price, location and ambience.

One of the best thing to happen to kolkata station was comesum giving travellers option for varieties of food rather then rail Yatri restaurant which was previously there 
They serve all kind of dishes from South Indian to kachori Sabzi 
,North Indian thali,veg non veg thali all the items are ritely priced and that's why the place is full all the time as people can enjoy there meal at there budget 

Ordered for veg dosa and maharaja thali parcel  all the items were very good and the thali was nicely packed with pickle and sweets

Bad food, bad service. Non veg food was terrible. Never tasted such a bad biriyani in ages. Throwing that away, took a fish meal, considering the reputation kolkota has for fish dishes. That was terrible too. Later ordered a lassi, assuming what can go wrong with that. To my surprise, they were able to deliver a worse Lassi too

Have tried masala dosa, veg thali, non veg combo thali, chicken biriyani and all were pretty bad... D sambar tasted sweet, chutney was all watery, it's better to try d roadside stalls they gv better taste... 
Added to low quality food this place is overpriced...
Well d place is rated 2 which is for d cup of coffee they serve which is bearable rest d place is a big negative.. Everytime I visit this place I miss foodplaza which is a far better outlet.
Management need to encash on d location of d place.. customers seek value for money they spend...

One of the worst places to have food if you are around Howrah Railway Station. We packed food twice for having them while travelling but both the times the food got contaminated. They gave us refund in return of the bill. But I suggest you shouldnt go there even you are in problem, Irctc is better than Comesum.

I feel this crowd is just because of the people travelling from Howrah station to other places other wise better food is available at this same price.

A hyped up joint serving horrible food. What's worst here, is that the prices are sky-high. The Biriyani tastes horrible, the AC inside doesn't work. The tables are unclean, the staffs are rude and busy, the ambiance literally sucks, The juices are washed up liquid, the Cold Drinks aren't chilled. I could go on and on. I have tried multiple outlets of Comesum, including one at Bangalore Central, Mughal Sarai, Lucknow, Pune, Dhanbad, Sealdah and Howrah and New Delhi Railway Station. Almost everywhere (barring Sealdah and Howrah), the staffs are well mannered, and the food served are worth eating. The only reason I am awarding the extra 0.5 points is due to the Chicken Butter Masala, which I have had across all these outlets (Except the Howrah and Sealdah one), and this dish has been a real lifesaver for me at multiple occasions.

An extra point for their expedite service without compromising with the flavours much at rush hours when passengers rush in with a humble hunger to satisfy. It is situated in the new platform of Howrah Station. Things to try for surely are the masala dosa, the tomato onion uttapam and fried rice . Won't be a burden on your pocket and you can enjoy filling meals on your way to board a train or after getting off .

When I demanded for a light snacks they refused to provide me even if they had option for that. Then me and my pal ordered a chicken biriyani , it was so salty it could hardly be consumed. All the bill went waste...

Well the name goes a long way for railway travellers. When this outlet began its journey amidst all skeptical predictions and public hurrah. This place turned to be a life saver for most. Forgetting to pack foods for your night long trip to your loved ones, or elsewhere, It doesn't matter they provide an array of dishes to pack and travel. Prices are reasonable and staff is generally cordial. 
Cleanliness can be a issue at times but that is expected at such a crowded spot. 
Food taste is generally good, and hygienic, along with that they also pack your foods in a good packaging container that will help you carry it in your luggage w/o spillage.

I have been ordering foods in comesum since many days while travelling.yesterday, I purchased veg maharaja deluxe thali for 200/- around 7.10  pm from kolkata Railway station ' Comesum Counter'.  When I ate the food @ 8 :10 pm in the train,  it was the worst meal I ever had. The quality of tandoori was hopeless. Panner Sabji was not having paneer ironicaly.I had a very hard situation. When u charge 200 bucks to a passenger atleast provide some good food.  This is the first time I came across such a havoc  food. From next time I will make sure to purchase food From other vendors but not COMESUM.

Conveniently situated at the entrance of the new Howrah station, this place provides a decent spread of cuisines for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Since it was morning, we ordered just a plate of idly. 3 fluffy and reasonable sized idlies were served along with sambhar, white chutney and even green chutney - for Rs. 55 + Taxes. Prices are somewhat higher which is understandable as they have to bear huge overheads. The idlies were soft and chutney was very tasty. Sambhar was also fine, but was not warm - which was a major turn off. Staff service is okay - but there is problem regarding change availability at the cash counter. Decent seating arrangements are available and several customers were having breakfast when we entered - this being a 24*7 joint. Nothing much to comment on the ambience and moderate decoration has also been done.
Cheers!

Served with hot chola and two bhaturas for Rs67. There was also a gulab jamun with it... adding to the complete meal valie. I though look for hygiene and was happy with the way the place was maintained. Kudos to the people here for maintaining it in this way despiye the huge number of footfalls.

At first we went to the cash counter where nothing was available except thali, when a guest is trying to ask the is any thing is available to the kitchen then Mr ali is showing his rude behaviour. When we tried to explain him he should not told to the guest like this, he directly blame us that we r wrong at end we didn't had our dinner there and went to other resturent at same platform....

At end of the day it was a very disaster experience in Food plaza and they have lost there 1 customer now. I will tell other people to be careful with that person at food plaza.......

A huge food plaza at the South East Railways Terminal of Howrah Station. Serves a variety of cuisines that include north indian, south Indian, Chinese, etc. Their poori korma and biryanis are worth trying. A good place for quality food at Howrah Station.
