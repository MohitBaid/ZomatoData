A very delightful and tasty option when you wanna try some delicacy that too home made. Taking care of your taste buds very nicely with options to mention even small details like less oil or spicy etc. 
You get home delivered at a time of your choice.
This venture is sure to go way ahead. 
Keep it up team Cookmywish.

For a working woman like me cookmywish is a blessing, where I can order and eat healthy meals on days my cook is absent or order when have guests over and serve fresh home food rather than ordering rich food from a restaurant . Recently I ordered 2 veg Thalis and was very happy with the quantity of the food and the time of delivery was spot on. Highly recommend you to try ordering from cookmywish

I ordered Vegetable Biryani, Paneer Butter Masala and Chef Special Mini Platter of Chocolates.

Vegetable Biryani – Normally when its comes to Biryani, I always preferred a non veg one. So, I was bit hesitated while ordering this Vegetable Biryani. But the chef had done a wonderful job. Well, this. Vegetable Biryani so good – perfectly cooked, rice grains were not broken and chockfull of flavours inside and that finely chopped fried onion, just look at them calling out to you. It comes on a bed of bread toast, which adds a whole new dimension to the dish.

Paneer Butter Masala - Special mention goes to the Paneer Butter Masala for its slightly caramelised exterior. Its spicy enough please my heart as I mentioned I need it spicy not mild and it was perfectly spicy yet comforting and flavourful. The Paneer Butter Masala may not look fancy, but it's clearly prepared with heart.

Vegetable Biryani and Paneer Butter Masala was complementing each other like perfect combo and combinations were made after contemplating how one item would fit perfectly with the other.

Chef Special Mini Platter of Chocolates - If you have a really sweet tooth, the creamy & chocolety Mini Platter of Chocolates was rightfully tempting. Chocolates were well-balanced and the naughtiest treat of them all, was Paan flavoured one!

New year, new resolutions and new dining experiences to look forward to — like home dining. There's the saying "sharing is caring", so rope in a few of your friends and order for a food adventure like no other!

Let me introduce you to Cook My Wish! This is not just another regular restaurant or a café, this is an inimitable culinary meet-up concept and frankly speaking I am in love with this concept! Few weeks back I was contacted by the owner of this place and I was introduced to this NEWLY OPENED food-ordering portal through a food tasting session. CookMyWish is actually an initiative with loads of positive social implications and it is basically a website named “cookmywish.com”. This is a women-only home-chef portal focused on Kolkata (as of now), dedicated to serving the needs of home-makers and enabling them to benefit form the power of internet. Using a Technology-plus-Services model, they are running an ‘Assisted Marketplace’ - where women, including those who are not very familiar with the web technologies, can get a store up and running with CookMyWish’s help. This is really an innovative concept and many homemakers can make good use of their free time and can earn in this process, which will in turn improve their emotional, social and financial health. CookMyWish was started couple of months back with 3 chefs but now they have 15+ chefs and bakers enrolled with them - serving a variety of cuisines – starting from North Indian, Bengali, Chinese, South Indian to Thai, Japanese and Continental. Their USP is HOME-COOKED; HOME DELIVERED which is really crucial these days with not-too-healthy street-food invading our meals every now and then! Also it is a boon for those who are staying away from home. You need to just log on to their portal and let them know your ‘wish’, they will ‘cook’ as per your wish and deliver the food right at your door-steps – that is Cook My Wish for you :)

I found the delivery, the service, and most importantly the food to be quite nice. We were a group of 4 on a lazy weekend, and we weren't feeling like leaving the house. So we decided to do go with the "home-cooked, home-delivered" option, and also went in for a bit of a menu-mix - we called for Nachos for appetizers, Chat for main-course, and red-velvet cake for dessert, and were quite happy. Delivery was on-time, and quantities were sufficient!

It was one of those days when we didn’t want to eat our home cooked meal but food from outside provided it’s healthy and tasty and most importantly, delivered at home. So we chose to order from cookmywish, a sumptuous lunch. We ordered for a plate of chola bhatura and harabhara kebab from Aruna’s kitchen on the portal. And we were in for a surprise! We never knew chola bhatura could taste this good, home-cooked, oil-free and yummy too!! The hara bhara kebab was truly appetizing….we enjoyed it thoroughly. Must say, cookmywish has opened new doors for ordering a healthy home-cooked meal within your city. I would love to order more such delicacies in future and recommend my friends as well. Truly worth a try!!

We had ordered for a complete meal for six people but being the first time we were apprehensive about the quantity, particularly as we had invited friends over. So I kept my cook waiting just in case...However, when the food turned up, nicely packed, we were pleasantly surprised. We had ordered for starters as well as the main course and every item was delicious. The quantity too was sumptuous and my wife has it in mind to order food from cookmywish the next time we invite guests over...a big help at home particularly when both are working out of the house
