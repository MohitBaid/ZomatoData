Although I have never been to this place and am solely reviewing it based on take aways and orders, but I can imagine what this place is from the pics and the reviews. Well the food is authentic (the type of Chinese cuisine we have been used to since our childhood days, when there was no Mainland China, no Buddha Bites, no Chowman). This is the old school Chinese food that we have grown up loving. And folks you should not go here for the ambience or the service. Certain places live on for the food and the heritage and the history (the lazy service and the "not up to par" ambience are just the way these places are...frozen in time). Cannot talk about today's youth(who are used to elegant ambiences in the new age restros all around and it is not wrong to expect such), but for us who have a part of our childhood memories etched at such banal places....it feels special to go back in time. It is a feel difficult to describe (remember Anton Ego being impressed by something as 'menial' as a Ratatouille, but the catch point was that it was a taste that belonged to his childhood and one that his mother used to prepare for him).
Well folks I enjoyed the food....no doubts regarding that.You will too if you ignore the trivial issues.

Kowloon is our one stop shop when budget is the main concern and we are damn hungry too. The place is located just on the alley beside suruchi sangha. Staff is not very cooperative and very slow in servings hence the rating is completely on the food threshold.

A well known old chinese joint at New Alipore. Been there with my friend on a casual dine out. Took Hot & Sour Soup in starter which was average one. But in main course we had Chicken Fried Rice which we didn't like at all. Rice was very oily & was served cold. Also we took Honey Chicken in side dish. I think the honey used in that was not good as the dish was smelly. Overall food wasn't upto the mark. AC was also not working & it was really hot in there. I must say our experience was not good at all.

Another " childhood favourite " . Kowloon was renowned for its chinise at a time . Whether it was there dry chilli chicken , garlic chicken , lemon chicken or mixed fried rice , noodles or even soups , they were best and often had takeaways from here since sitting arrangements were not so good . Last puja , I visited this place with my brother during dashami . The quality and quantity was okayish but they made a hochpoch with the orders placed . Lemon chicken was the worst out of all . Otherwise it was a okayish experience . They need to have renovations too at their place . So Kowloon needs to buck up in order to have hold on their customers in long run .

The ambience, decoration, food quality, quantity and trustworthiness has been the same over ages. Loved the dishes everyone of it. Chilli Pork, Chilli Chicken and the Dimsum / Wanton soup were was a favorite. The rice and noodles preparation are absolutely loveable. You enjoy every bit of it. The price tag had always been on a higher side all through, but with good food no complaints..

I have a very fond memory of this place....it was the first time I had liked Chinese cuisine. In the earlier two instances, both on the occasion of the birthday party of my cousin, the Chinese food that was served was so bland that it had engendered in me an aversion to Chinese cuisine for almost a decade!! Mind you, in the latter case the food was actually cooked by a Chinese cook who had come down to my auntâ€™s house to prepare the lunch for us all. It was only after visiting Kowloon and tasting the food there that it dawned on me that I prefer the spicier version...what is known as â€˜Indian Chineseâ€™ in common parlance :P We had ordered both rice and chowmein, as well as fish and chicken itemsâ€¦.and they all were lip-smacking!

Crispy baby corn , Chicken Wings and Chilli pork.

The baby corn was overcooked and it had a somky smell to it.
The chicken wings were okay.
The chilli pork was good. I loved the tangy taste of it.

A place which has its own charm so to say, the interiors are ok, the dishes have no innovation or presentation as such a quintessential Chinese place, but there chilli chicken and Cantonese styled noodles are something with which you cannot go wrong with.

A chinese restaurant near the New Alipore Petrol pump with retro chinese ambiance and decor. Just a few step toward Suruchi Sangha Club from the petrol pump and you will find this restaurant on the left side. From the outside, the restaurant may look small, but inside there is pretty big space.

Been there few days ago with one of my friend. We ordered two plates of mixed fried rice, one chicken manchurian and one chilly chicken!

Rice was not so well cooked. The rice grain was hard a little bit and you hardly find any veggies in the rice. Quantity wise okey but quality wise very poor. Overall not so worthy.

Both Side dishes were taste wise okey. Chicken pieces were big, well cooked and juicy in nature. But the gravy was not so well cooked. Too much gravy really kill the flavour of the dish.

Overall a worst dining experiences. Was really expecting much more higher before entering the restaurant but came out with disappointment. Will hardly visit this restaurant again. :\ :\

This is where we head every Pujo before braving the queue of Suruchi Sangha. It almost has become a yearly ritual for us.
Yes, there's nothing fancy about this eatery. During the time of year when we head there, it simply overflows with hungry souls, but somehow they manage to keep their standard - which by the way is not very high. But they do serve decent food (which is all we look for while hopping pandals :P).
About the food: This year we order Hot Garlic Pork, Szechwan Chicken, Special Meifoon and Mixed noodles. The Meifoon and noodle was a bit oily, like old school Calcutta Chinese. The other two tasted okay, though Hot Garlic Pork wasn't really garlicky. :3
The pricing is neither high either, all these came for 720INR, and we, a group of three, were just full.

Located just beside new alipore petrol pump it is an old place bt well maintained. Went a few days back and ordered mixed noodles and hot garlic chicken. Noodles was like any other restaurant . Garlic chicken was not at all spicy but it was tasty. I excepted it to be more spicy. But they give a good number of pieces and medium sized.
Its overall a good place with only con that the taxes are not inclusive.

It is 100% true that Zomato changed the way to look at the gastronomic/foodie culture across the globe. But at the same time, it cannot be denied that the foodie culture existed, even before when Zomato was launched, or even thought of to be a concept that can be made worth launching.

And while traveling back to that timeline, it reminds me of my New Alipore days, when "Kowloon" happened to be a buzzword in the area, for its delicious Chinese delights.

An old school chinese joint with neat& peaceful ambience and limited but descent decor, this place used to be a sheer bliss for the Chinese food lovers of the area, when there was no big shots like "Mainland China", "Chowman", and others, and availability of quality Chinese food in Kolkata was restricted to the ever bustling party hub Park Street, and the tucked in restaurants of the dingy lanes in Tyangra(China Town).

Connecting to the memoirs, this is the place where I first started to develop a taste for Chinese cuisine( after a pathetic trial experiment at China Town), when I used to check in for dinner with my parents, since the time I was a toddler(or a bit older than that).

Tasted "Chicken sweet corn soup" for the first time, and till then that is my most favourite soup in Chinese menu even today at any restaurant. 
Can't recollect all the dishes that I experienced here as my memory is not that sharp, but can remember this much that everything tasted delicious, on each and every visit, and the showstopper of the main course used to be "Chicken hot garlic sauce", which we used to order compulsorily on our every visit.

Looking forward for a recent check in experience, so as to ascertain whether the dishes are as good and delicious as the earlier times, and will update the review accordingly.

Till then....
Let the legacy be cherished, down the memory lane :)

The mix cantonese chow is really good. It is packed with chicken and soft perfectly cooked prawns. The taste is really nice. 
The chilly chicken is nice and spicy to right extent. The chicken pieces are big and soft. 
Going there one must try the prawn balls which are like small golden pieces of happiness. A drizzle of lime juice on top of it enhances the taste to a great extent.

Its only located in an area where it can be easily be located as its just near the new alipore petrol pump, the food sucks big time, its just a joint of the lower section of people who wants their snack/ chaart for alcohol. The food is really bad please stay away. Bought 1 mixed noodles and 1 chilli chicken, the mixed noodles was without prawn and egg and tasted like raw flour not at all well cooked and the chicken is like rat meat surely not chicken. STAY AWAY ZOMATIANS..............!

Nice place. Old, traditional family owned restaurant. Located near the New alippre petrol pump. Food is quite good. We had the mixed fried rice, prawns in garlic sauce, chicken 65 and mixed hakka. All in all, a good experience. Not something spectacular, but decent enough. Homely atmosphere. Perfecr for a family visit

This is a gem hidden in the heart of New alipore and pretty away from publicity.
If you are a authentic Chinese food lover pay your visit here .
Be wise with what you are ordering.
My favourite is a Chicken Asparagus Soup with a honey Chicken and Mixed chowmein or Fried rice .
The place is not too much decorated a d may disappoint you but who cares ? 
Enjoy your food :)
P.s- This place is being run by Chinese people :)

Me and a friend had gone,to mainly have some finger food..preferably momos :) You enter a red-lit Restro.. with about 6-7 tables.The owner is a Chinese person.Ordered pepper chicken and chicken steamed momos.Ambience is a bit dingy..lighting was low..The momos I found were pretty bland..Momo sauce not very good.The chicken looked stale.You could make out that they didn't prepare it fresh. We told the owner..he was non chalant.I guess no next time for me here.

This one is a true discovery. Someone whom I really adore took me to this small joint in New Alipore during one of the visits to her house in Chetla. This one is an age old authentic Chinese joint which I regret missing out.

Location : located near new alipore petrol pump. A brisk walk towards Suruchi Sangha and you reach Kowloon. Its quite unnoticeable due to lack of flashy hoardings, so keep on alert mode while searching.

Decor : the basic authenticity of the cuisine is proved by the simplistic decor. Some chinese feng shui figurines stood, bone China vases also added to it. The Chinese curious and doormats further added to it. The bine china cutlery with typical chinese designs etched also quite added to the whole concept.

Ambience: small dimly lit restro moderately spaced. Gave the typical chino joint look.

Staffs: the restro is owned by a chinese family. Initially a chinese parlour, later on a food joint was planned along with it.  the staffs were courteous enough although I found the warmth missing.

Coming to the food-
Since it was an evening snack,the order was on the lighter side.

1. Chicken and mushroom soup - i would say, possibly one of the best of the kind that I have had. The mushroom and chicken was in amazing amounts. The portions were decent.

2. Kung pao chicken - since my friend is a non-spicy person, kung pao chicken was the ultimate choice. It was was medium spiced. The sauces were given in correct proportion, thus adding to the goodness of the dish. Although I did not like it being garnished with whole groundnut.

Value for money : the prices are really decent. I believe it is definitely worth it. Quite easy to the pocket.

I would definitely like to recommend people to visit kowloon, as I am visiting soon. The authenticity of Chinese cuisine being the USP.

Located in ALipore

This place is gloomy, shabby and not at all classy.

The taste also is not something to talk about although they don't sacrifice on quantity.

The pocket pinch is fair.

Pretty basic to be honest. Good food, at reasonable prices, pleasing quantity. Nothing much to offer in terms of ambiance. Even the tables, the decoration, the entire set up is elementary. The place located at New Alipore Petrol Pump (a minute's walk), near 3B bus stand. The restaurant is owned and managed by a Chinese family, who deal quite well with the customers. The place can accomodate around 50 at a time.

Try the Pork Fried Rice, if you have it. Very well cooked. I also tried their Dry Chilly Chicken, it tasted nice and spicy, but the chicken pieces were a tad hard. Thai Soup was extremely well prepared, served nice and hot. Satisfying experience with the food.

Where they can improve: Install some lights (not flashy ones) to save the space from looking dull. Decorate the tables. Have some soothing music playing at the background.

This place is located close to Suruchi Sangha in New Alipore & so we decided to give it a visit between pandal hopping.The first thing that struck me on entering the restaurant is that they had tried to create a nice ambience with dim lights & all,but failed miserably..the place was noisy too..We decided to try their-chicken chowmein,chicken manchow soup and veg chopsuey.The only item that tasted delicious was the soup.Chowmein & the chopsuey were very average kind of..didn't like them much.Prices are reasonable,, but service was not good. The owner rudely asked usÂ to finish our food fast as there were many people waiting.We left the place dissatisfied & no wish of going there again.

Yesterday I visited this restaurant to pack a few dishes home , the interior of the Restaurant is decent, the parking space is an issue as the vistor has to seek the nearby alleys to park their vehicle. Now about the food , I ordered Mix Fried rice   Mix Chowmein , Garlic Chicken , Honey Chicken, Chilli  Chicken and another Chicken dish ( Possibly Chicken in red pepper , I cannot recollect ) . The food was meant for dinner for the year end fest back home . The food taste was HORRIBLE TO SAY LEAST. I HAVE NEVER TASTED SUCH AWFUL CHINESE IN MY LIFE. IT WAS SO BAD. Believe me , even my street side cart laden " Pochas Chinese " taste better than this. I felt the cook is thoroughly confused , whether to prepare a" Pure Chinese dish" or an " Indian Chinese dish " & secondly, it seems there is a fix gravy for all the chicken dishes and flavors and spices are just add on , even the Chicken dumplings taste the same. I am trying to forget this joint as a bad memory

When I was growing up in the area of New Alipore Kowloon was the only restaurant worth its salt. We were regulars eating chowmein and sweet and sour fish gravy. Back in Kolkata after many years I decided to try them again to relive the old memories.

For the most part I was satisfied, as the owners were still around doing their bit and their fried chicken momos as well as chowmein were top notch. The chicken gravy though I felt was a bit undercooked but all in all a wonderful recollection of the good old days.

Cheers,

This place is just near the club salon in new Alipur. Overlook the decor and focus on food. We had ordered chicken chopsuey and schezwan chicken. Schezwan chicken tasted like chilly chicken but the crispy and soupy chicken chopsuey made up for it. 
The prices are minimal so it won't punch a hole in your pocket. Would love to go back because of the chopsuey.

I think I am giving it .5 higher than the place deserves, but any place serving such good pork can do with a little bonus. ;)

A legend of New Alipore, this place sits just across the road from the landmark petrol pump. Their Chili Pork, Roast Chili Pork and Pork Pepper Fry are delicious and must-have. They cook their noodles and meifoon well, albeit a little oily, but anyone looking for old school Chinese shall find solace here. There soups are also awesome, and I cannot recall the countless times I have had just a soup, a starter and left satisfied and happy. 

Yes, their quality has seen a drop over years but the gap is not huge compared to some other restos in Kolkata. They are still priced very moderately and serve a mean and delicious Pepper Fry. Enough reason for happiness.

The chowmein (smoky at its best), the fried rice, the fish and the chicken - all were very delectable. And I daresay, their fried chilli pork is one of the best you can get in Kolkata. Loved it and will come back again the next time I am in Kolkata!

Tried to call them up for home delivery and before I could place my order and guide the person for his easiest way to deliver he hunged the phone up on me saying I don't know that place. I called again and tried to speak and he abused. I now don't care weather they serve the best Chinese in this area but I would never ever visit or even recommend this place to my  friends or family.

Located very very close to the famous Durga Pujo of Suruchi Sangha, we went there on Mohastomi. During the pujos you can expect a dip in food quality and delivery would take extra time!!
In #Kowloon, we didn't face any of the challenges!!
We ordered for #ChickenChowmein which was average (again you can expect that during Durga Pujo and Mohastomi) and plane rice along with #ManchurianChicken, which was damn good (one of the best that I ever had) #RedPepperChicken which was neither bad neither superb and...........

#KungPaoChicken, which was superb!! Brilliant!! Oshadharon!! Chicken with Badam... Really a must try..

I'd surely visit this place again for a longer period of time when there would not be any pandel hopping.

Every dish was unique in the sense that amount of oil used was appropriate and the spices too. Nevertheless the taste of the food was really bang the mark. I have been to a lot of chinese outlets, but however these outlet have really made a mark on me....Will surely like to visit there again and again..Just one advice if they can renovate a little on their interiors...

Kowloonâ€¦like the Hong Kong mainland islandâ€¦ stands apart in isolation.. shorn of inhibition this place has been the mainstay in new alipore for ages.. meticulous owner.. prompt and cordial staff and great comfort foodâ€¦ may not touch standards of great chinese but because they are quite selective about their ingredients and cooking medium the food has always been palatable. Right from their soups..thai soup is highly recommendableâ€¦but u have to tell them to go easy on the starch..zee cornflourâ€¦ pork dishes stir up a vociferousness in your appetite..buIt fish bassa has murdered the bhetki rendition like all other placesâ€¦ staples of rice and noodles come up in value for money proportionsâ€¦was very surprised to find abundant peas in a chinese rice preparationâ€¦ thai fried rice tasted like chicken peas pulaoâ€¦mein foon mixed was good..all I can sense its sliding towards the typical sino- ludhianvi style of indo chinese fusion

Its a very old joint. One of my relatives lived once near this joint. We used to visit this place a lot.  Recently u visited the place once again. We orders chicken fried rice and noodles and for side dish we ordered pork roast and chilli chicken.
I must say, after so long years, they have maintained their quality. All the dishes were very good. I think they have reduced their quantity a little bit. 
This is authentic Chinese restaurant, so here one won't get a well furnished hall. But you can say it is neat and clean. The waiters have nice behavior and also helpful with choosing the dishes. 
I also must add that the prices are not high, within the range.
Overall this is place is good and I am eagerly waiting for my next visit.

I visited this place few times when i was a kid. After many years I visited this place on 12.06.15 with 2 of my friends. 
Located just beside the entrance of suruchi sangha it is a normal/shabby looking restaurant. Inside is not much, steel chairs, dim light, typical Chinese wall hangings. 
We were 3 hungry guys and wanted to eat good food. We ordered a tom yum soup, chicken drumstick as the starters. The tom yum soup was a clear soup tad bit spicy. The drumsticks were deep fried, I felt that the coating was more than chicken content. 
In the main course we ordered mixed chop suey, mixed chow mein , chicken fried rice with roasted pork, schezwan prawn and chilli chicken. Well, we were hungry!! The pork was soft but the gravy was too salty, the chilli chicken was soft n nice but I hated the prawn...it had a typical smell n above all it was deep fried to hide the smell. The chow mein was nice, meat n prawn filled, so was the fried rice minus the prawn. However, I didn't taste the chop suey, so can't vouch for it. But my friends said it was OK. Quantity wise its alright. 
Overall I found this place a bit over hyped. Or may be its because  the ppl living in its vicinity just love this place, like I love my Para's Chinese place. Its just like that, only difference is Kowloon prepares pork dishes and my Para's Chinese centre doesn't.
It cost us 1500 bux for 3ppl. For 2ppl who can eat, it will be 900+bux.

Kow loon could be your go to place if you're near alipore and in the mood for Chinese.  Don't expect a chique atmosphere here but when it comes to the food they have it right.  It is within budget, great portions and satisfying.
Recommended: The Roast Chilli Pork is a must have here, it is just the right amount of heat and tang which goes well with the Mixed Cantonese Noodles. The Chicken Prawn Fried rice also has this nice smoky flavour to it.
Thumbs up: Good service and satisfying food.

Value for money. Yes, that is how I guess Kowloon should be described. The decor is not so fascinating, situated near the New Alipur Petrol pump, it has some really good Chinese dishes to offer. Tried many a times (maybe because I stay nearby ;) ) and got to experiment a variety of dishes. 

Their main attractions/Dishes to try: 

1. Chicken Asparagus soup, Lemon Coriander soup.
2. Fry spring chicken, Chicken steam momo.
3. Kowloon special fried rice (with pork, chicken and prawn stuffed into it), Kowloon special Meifoon.
4. Garlic chicken, chicken with bamboo shoots, honey chicken, chicken mushroom babycorn.

Give it a try. You won't regret. :)

Their prawn - chicken fried rice, dry chili chicken (the gravy one was a little too salty), hot and sour soup, clear soup, chili pork, and chili fish are excellent, to say the least. No wonder Kowloon has had a steady customer base in new alipore for the past 20 years. :)

After reading the reviews on zomato me and my friend decided to go to this restaurant. First of all I really liked the ambience of the place. The ones who work there are really polite. The food came really fast. I was more or less happy but i wasn't satisfied with the food taste much. It tasted ordinary. We had ordered chicken noodles and sweet and sour chicken. Plus they charged VAT and service tax.
My experience was not that good.
Would I go back again?

Don't let it's appearance deceive you. It might not have a grand entrance way but it more than makes up for that with its food. No surprises why it is featured in the great chinese section on zomato. Reasonably priced and pocket friendly. It can get a bit stuffy indoors as it is often well packed. But their service is good and the have the most amazing tom yum soup! For all the people who can't have mama noodles regularly. This makes up for it fairly! A must visit for chinese fanatics.

This pocket friendly restaurant serves Chinese food, which is simply yummm! The dried chili chicken deserves a special mention. And because of it's reasonable price and good ambience, I wouldn't mind going there again and again. :)

Regularrrr! The place in itself might look shabby (It IS shabby). But the food more than makes up for it! For starters, the tom yum soup, the fried pepper fish/chicken, dry chilli chicken and dry pan fried chilli fish is  superb. For mains, the usuals (Fried Rice, Noodles and the very familiar manchurian/chilli chicken/ginger/garlic chicken) are pretty good but the special mentions are the American Chopsuey, any variety of the Rice Noodles and Roasted/Dry Chilli Pork. Superbly priced! A must try!

Excellent, amazing, superb. The chinese here is not indianized, so many ppl may not like it. But I love it. Their prawn - chicken fried rice, dry chili chicken (the gravy one was a little too salty), hot and sour soup, clear soup, chili pork, and chili fish are excellent, to say the least. No wonder Kowloon has had a steady customer base in new alipore for the past 20 years. :)

After reading the reviews on zomato me and my friend decided to go to this restaurant. First of all I really liked the ambience of the place. The ones who work there are really polite. The food came really fast. I was more or less happy but i wasn't satisfied with the food taste much. It tasted ordinary. We had ordered chicken noodles and sweet and sour chicken. Plus they charged VAT and service tax.
My experience was not that good.
Would I go back again?
I don't think so. It was an okay first experience for me!

One of the few "Chinese" outlets in New Alipore which has be around for over 4 decades now . generally popular with the neighbourhood more for convenience than any great reputation. Few people from elsewhere come in as there are certainly much better places in town. Its a small ,a bit dingy stale atmosphere with a strong lingering fishy air !! The food is very average Calcutta Chinese, filling,reasonably cheap ,certainly not authentic Cantonese or Schewezan. No point driving all the way here from Ballygunj or even Alipore.

The chicken sweet corn soup, the mixed fried rice, the sweet and sour prawn, the sweet and sour chicken and the prawn pakora was good. Â Fried pepper chicken and fish pakora were raw. Service was fast. Â They did not return rupees 8 change which seemed very strange because they did not even tell us that they were not being able to give the change. It was very rude and unprofessional. What's more, they lost the tip which I was going to give them. My impression of Kowloon was better before and now it worsened. Not recommended.

kowloon has been there forever!!Â Â  but unfortunately, the taste and quality of the food that it serves has deteriorated by quite a few notches for a few years.Â Â  unless they jack it up fairly soon, we will write its obituary sooner than later.Â Â Â Â Â  considering their food and service,Â  the only reason that it has survived is its location (it is located bang opp to the new alipore petrol pump)Â  and its past fame and glory.Â Â Â Â Â  i have been thereÂ a few timesÂ  (i can at least recall 4 times in the last 3-4 years)Â  and i cant rave about the place or their food.Â Â Â Â Â  FOOD -Â  ordinary chinese fare; nothing to write home aboutÂ Â Â Â Â Â  SERVICEÂ -Â i dont know if it has always been like this, but we got some very mediocre service and rude behavior.Â Â Â Â PRICEÂ -Â  very reasonableÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â AMBIENCE -Â  very good for family / friends.Â  Â Â Â  ALCOHOL - they dont serve alcoholÂ Â Â Â Â  OVERALL - i have run out of patience and after having given them repeated chances.Â  secondly, you get better food,Â  better variety and better service at similar price in calcutta's china town.

This place has been in new alipore for ages now. Owned by a chinese family. No one unaware of the name "Kowloon" in the locality. I have been regulary visiting this place for years. Due to its adjacent location to my house i never miss any opportunity to drop by this eatery. It is modestly decorated and enoughly spacious to accomodate around more than 25 people. They serve authentic chinese cuisines in a decent price. All the staffs and waiters are very helpful and till date i haven't witnessed a single employee turnover in these restaurant. The quality and quantity of their food has never been compromised and altered till date and i haven't witnessed as such of any prominent price hikes either. I feel blessed for having a quality chinese restaurant like KOWLOON in my residential locality. It is a restaurant completely dedicated in satisfying customers by maintaining the quality without engaging into any fuss.

Great food, great quantity, decent pricing. But please keep in mind that credit card machine doesnt work. The manager/owner was awfully rude in pointing that out. I could have been told politely about the faulty machine. In short getting yelled at by a grouchy manager isnt a great way to end a nice friday night dinner, which was great by the way. I worked in restaurants and i love the atmosphere and the intensity of it but yelling at a paying customer for my fault wasn't something i was taught.

Being a resident of New Alipur, you have got to know about this authentic Chinese food joint, run by a small Chinese family!
Homely ambience, prompt service & lip smacking chinese delicacies are the three specialities of this place! Among the soups Chicken Clear & Chicken Wonton Soup are fab. Don't forget to try out their Kowloon Special Noodles & Rice..*_*...And they specialise in three dishes..these 3 dishes are so damn good that i think they are the best of its kind in South Kolkata..the dishes are Dry Chilli Chicken, Roast Chilli Pork & Szechuan Prawns! ..Other sides of Chicken..Prawn n Fish in Garlic, Hot Garlic & Szechuan flavours are worth trying as well. ..Gravy Noodles,Szechuan Noodles & Meifoon (rice noodles) are also a treat to have here. ^_^ Such wonderful authentic Chinese at suchhhhh affordable rates...nd WITHOUT vat! Located just 2 minutes away frm my residence. .i keep going there nd anyone who is craving to have authentic chinese cuisine at suchh affordable rates shall definitely pay a visit here! CHEERS! :D

Recently I was told about this age old joint by a friend. So last Sunday my sister bought dinner from this place. We took a parcel of Chicken Schezwan noodles and Chinese Chopsuey. Firstly there was a lot of confusion with the person at the billing counter and I came back with the impression that he is quite rude.. The ambience is decent. Now at home we opened the box to find a funnily coloured noodles and a Chopsuey that lacked vegetables. My sister suggested that this is what happens with time to an old restaurant. I have read about a  special pork dish that they make, probably someday I will come back for that and never for any other dishes.

It's very nearby to my working place , so been there few times for lunch or dinners with colleagues . The first thing I would say its a truely overhyped place . Very Very overhyped ...... But its not worthy of it . Personally I dislike this place but had to go there on other's demand . Its an ac ground floor of a house , so quite small in size . Ambience not mention worthy ....quite shabby . Food very very average , not at all authentic ( u cant say their food tastes like kolkata Chinese street foods or typical of china town Â  ) , often they are over or under salted , they serves some thai naming foods as well ( though those doesn't contain even traces of lemon grass , kaffir lime leaves or galangal ) . Service is also very poor . I don't recommend it to any body , until & unless he or she is very hungry and passing by side of it . Another thing ,they don't serve alcohol , so its hard to swallow their tasteless food without it :P

Costs 500 for 2 .

Been there with family last week for celebrating parent's anniversary. we r in a real hurry because my cousins had to leave early. we reached there around 7.30pm. It was almost empty. We first ordered the food n mentioned to serve fast as we r in hurry. We ordered chicken fried rice, chicken chowmin gravy, boneless chilli chicken n lemon chicken. the food was served within half an hour. Everything tastes pretty good except lemon chicken. somehow I didn't like it much. So I deducted 0.5 marks for it . Otherwise everything was perfect. the bill was also within budget. its a perfect restaurant in all respects. A big thumbsup

This is a very old restro, i believe more than 30 Yrs old, run by a chinese family serving authentic chinese food.The place is located just near new alipore petrolpump, very popularly known for Suruchi Sangha. 
Its A good place for foodies who dnt care much bt the ambience.The place will not Impress u with its decor bt wait till u try out the food.
Coming to the food  we ordered mixed fried rice, honey chicken , nd mah favourite lemon chicken which is a must try dish nd if u love fish then go for ginger prawns. 
The food served was very good , good quality, good quantity nd is priced reasonably.
Overall a good place to dine.
One more thing, generally at times of durga puja, food quality of lots of restros go down, quantity shortens, bt at this place it is not so.
Ya ull have to wait fr ya turn bt it will be worth waitin. So do pop in to the place this pujas when u come to see Suruchi Sangha.

Went with my friends(7 of us, some strict vegetarians and some non vegetarians) after reading the above reviews..what a disappointment..started with the soup..the non veg ones were decent while the veg ones were awful..the tomato soup could be used as a sauce for the noodles! As starters we had fired momos which was filled with oil and chilli potato which was okay.. In main course we ordered fish Hakka noodles, Kowloon special meifoon, chilly pork, chicken in bamboo shoots( which I suspect had two table spoon phenyl), veg fried rice. Schezwan noodles and veg manchurian, the non veg items was too salty and the idea of chilli is covering up with  truck loads of green chilli..veg items were edible. 
Overall the service was slow..food had too many flaws and had a oriental looking guy( Mr Chang) at the counter( to make it look authentic) while the food was being made by ramu chacha. To add salt to the wound the  Mr Chang was busted having aloo paranta with chole!

Another place in Kolkata that I hold very close to my heart...KOWLOON.. Located just around the corner of M-Block in New Alipore opposite the petrol pump..a nice family run venture that has been a fav since childhood. This place is at least over 30 years old and is legendary when it comes to chinese cuisine in south kolkata. I have tasted almost everything on the menu and everything I must say is close to awessomeness personified. Be it the noodles they serve here, or the sides, the chopsuey or the soups...every single dish is prepared with love and paramount culinary expertise. Kudos to team KOWLOON  for being around for so long and serving such great chinese food.

Kowloon is perhaps the first restaurant that I would frequent since the time I could eat. It was renowned in New Alipore area to be the best Chinese food in Kolkata apart from Tangra. No wonder I have a nostalgic connection to this place.

The food of this joint has changed quite a lot in the twenty years. Lately the food quality has deteriorated compared to other places. However their crown jewel "Roast Pork with extra chilly" still is one of the best that u can get. I always ask for a semi-gravy version which is not on the menu.

Though I want to give this place a full 5/5 however the latest food quality lets its reputation go down a little.

One of the oldest Chinese restaurants in town and also one of my favourites. This place gives you a very homely feeling as soon as you walk in. This probably is run by a family of Chinese immigrants who surely know what they are doing. I love the baby corn chicken over here as well as the pork. All in all, it's a nice place to grab a quick meal. It's not a very big place nor is it a fancy one but if you're a foodie, which somehow I feel you are, you'll be more than satisfied with the food over here.

There is only one dish I have ever tasted here. Perhaps over 20 times - but only one dish!

Strange but true - the Roast Chilli pork with extra chilli is to die for. We always do takeaways as the dish goes surprisingly well with alcoholic beverages. Just what an indian craves for along with his whiskey.

Other than that - its quite a dingy place with canteen like service and ambience,so unless you are on a tight budget and craving for chinese cuisine, not really my idea of eating out. But if this dish is to go by, I am sure their other dishes would be good too. Worth a visit.

A task to get a smile out of the chinese owner at the cashiers - once me & my friend tried hard with our jokes, but failed at that. Who cares though - Roast chilli pork!

QUANTITY OF 1 BOWL FRIED RICE IS ENOUGH FOR 2 PERSON. MANCHURIAN FISH IS ALSO VERY GOOD TO TAKE. BUT SANGHAI CHICKEN IS NOT UPTO THEIR STANDARD WHEN WE VISIT THERE LAST TIME. PRICE OF ALL MENUS ARE VERY POCKET FRIENDLY. BUT IN AMBIENCE  AND DECORATION SECTOR, THEY NEED MORE IMPROVEMENT.

This place is our regular take away place.Price is very reasonable.Food is always fresh and good.And best part I find the old world charm in the food.It reminds me of my childhood days.The smell of food specially.So are the paper boxes though now they charge for plastic containers.All in all a nice place for foodies who dont care for ambiance.

Eating out Chinese has never been a big deal in Kolkata! Each and every neighbourhood has a flurry of Chinese restaurants. While some manage to survive, others don't. Kowloon, I believe has been a favourite of the New Alipore locals for ages now. One of my friends is a die-hard fan of this place and that's how I got introduced to Kowloon. Situated right beside the New Alipore petrol pump, its location is more than convenient. I love the roast and chilli pork here. Every other food on the menu is definitely worth a try. When the pocket isn't heavy and the stomach grumbles and taste buds crib, visit Kowloon. No way will you go back disappointed.

Having grown up in this neighborhood, Kowloon was a regular eatery for us. Over the time, the ambiance has deteriorated. But the food is good. However, the next generation is taking over and  is enthusiastic about it. This is a good sign. They have started home delivery too. However, not in the rush hours.

GOOD AND TASTY FOOD FROM "KOWLOON"!
3 out of 5

Kowloon in New Alipore is very well known for its well cooked and authentic Chinese food. It has the look and feel of a typical Tangra Chinese restaurant. Once you go in, you will find comfortable and proper sitting arrangements. On the basis of their food quality and quantity, the items are priced neither too high nor too low. The food served is fresh, fast and healthy. The service is quick and prompt. The servers are very attentive to your need and very courteous.

Starters like Chicken drum sticks, spring chicken, gold coin prawns, fry pepper fish and pork cutlet are delightful Chinese preparations here. Soups like Thai soup, chicken hot and sour soup and manchow soup are light and fresh soup preparations. The soups contain a good amount of meat pieces and vegetables. They are not only refreshing but filling too.

Their pork dishes are very popular among diners. Pork dishes like hot garlic pork, Sichuan pork, chilli pork and Manchurian pork are fiery hot preparations. Their roast pork can be compared to the same served in high end restaurants (come here just for this if nothing else!). The meat is soft and juicy and the skin has that particular glaze which you would expect from such a dish. 

To go along with their side dishes, you can order staples like chopsuey, fried rice, chow and Mei foon. But it is their Mei foon that deserves special mention. Their mixed Mei foon is a wonderful option and one that goes very well with the pork dishes. But if you love spicy main staples, then you can try either Sichuan fried rice or Sichuan Hakka chow.

You can end your meal here with their very limited dessert offerings like vanilla, kesar pista and other regular ice creams. Alternatively, you can order for their pot of well brewed jasmine tea, ending your meal on a completely healthy note.

Authentic chinese at a very reasonable price. Ambience is ok,but the space is a bit small. A good place to hang out with friends without burning a hole in pocket. :)

Once upon a time, Kowloon was the Chinese Restaurant in our New Alipore area and was the rescue place for treating friends in our neighborhood !!!  That time, rating would have been 4 out of 5.

Quality has gone down steadily and same with the look-n-feel of the place.  I feel sorry to rate it 3 in spite of being an old time visitor of this place.

Authentic Chinese food. This is a very old Chinese restaurant run by a Chinese family. The ambience is average. The location is wonderful, right at the hew alipore petrol pump bus stop. If you know what I mean they offer the sticky and thick rice variant of fried rice. I found 3 variants of chinese (or indo chinese whatever you say) fried rice predominant in the city. A white one (probably without soya sauce, as served in Chowman), an off-white one (served in banjara, bed win takeaway outlets), and the sticky variant (served over here, also in Jimmy's kitchen, and all restaurants of Tangra)

Old memories. I have grown up having my first Chinese food served by Peter. Not much have changed. I can tell you it tastes the same even after 20 yrs. The place has a lot of warmth, kinda makes you feel at home, though they can do something about their washroom. Mixed Chowmein Gravy, Spring Chicken Boneless, Chicken with Mushroom and Babycorn, Chicken in Garlic sauce, and their prawn preparation is good. Try it.

Prices very reasonable.

If you are looking for authentic Chinese food and don't want to burn a hole in your pocket this is the place to be. Their speciality is Roast Pork (dry). One of the best porks I have ever had. Generally pork, if not prepared properly, smells but this one is simply awesome. Service is kind of okay, but the food is good and very much affordable.

At new alipore this is a Chinese restro.
This is one of my fav destination at the time of Durga Puja, after watching Suruchi Sangha.
Chicken items are good. Chilli Chicken and Chicken Manchurian are tasty.
Chicken Noodles and Mixed Noodles, both are good.
Hot Garlic Chicken is very good. Other items are also okay.
Ambiance is good, Atmosphere and decoration is okay.
Staff is okay and service is quick.
Prices are although high, but in accordance to the food.
Overall its a good Chinese restro.

One of the best chinese food joints in kolkata. Their mixed hakka chowmein, hot garlic chicken and kung pow chicken are killer favourites. Service and ambience are top class. A true chinese feel which is absent in most chinese joints.

Please all Rs.20 to each menu price in the currently uploaded menu card to get the current price as on March 2011. The people are caring, serves fast and quality food. I wish at least beer and wine was served by them. Good joint for families. Parking is available as the road is not much congested.
