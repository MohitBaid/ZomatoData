Stop calling that biriyani or whatever that is you serve Hyderabadi biriyani! If you were to serve that to a hyderabadi, that person would probably drag you atop of charminar & push you all the way down.
P.S : there is no cashew or egg in hyderabadi biriyani. You're welcome.

Yesterday I went there at about 12:30pm and they served some delicious dishes like tandoor chicken, chilli wine fish, chicken fried rice,butter naan as we ordered...all of them were equally yummy and yes the most important thing is that they did not compromise with their quality during this 31st december...one can go there with their family friends and will enjoy a good quality time.

Heard a lot about this place from my friends but today was my first time visiting here. Me and my friend ordered chicken sweet corn soup, chicken hakka noodles, and schezwan chicken, tbh I have never had anything so good, finally it was worth visiting. The food was so damn good, price was reasonable, the quantity was huge comparison to the other restaurants, and the service was unexpectedly good, the employees were very polite and well behaved.

After a decorative make-over this place provides a subtle ambience away from the bustling crowds. The food is also quite tasty on both fronts - Mughal and Chinese.
Recommended dishes -
1. Pepper garlic fish
2. Mixed meifoon
3. Cantonese chicken (noddles and the side dish)
4. Butter Chicken
5. Veg/peas pulao
... and much more.
Price quite reasonable in today's market.

Ordered chicken barbecue and chicken steamed momos. The barbecue chicken was dipping with sauce. Such a bad preparation. Though we ordered a starter it was chicken dipping in barbecue sauce. Very kiddish preparation. Seriously disappointing. Momos were ok. But a restaurant of this repute we expect more. 1 star because my delivery was apt. The food has to improve a lot, really a lot.

Today me n my wife went to this restaurent for dinner ... Nice cozy and well decorated restaurent .. we ordered mutton bara kebab, lachcha tanduri paranta, chicken tikka butter masala, mixed raita, Britney with hot chocolate. The kebab was good. But the chicken item we ordered .. not that good .. chicken was nr that much soft. Even sometimes we felt that the chicken was nt fresh. We cudnt finish that butter tikka masala dish. Apart from this, all other ordered items was quite good. Nt that much costly. But the food quality shud be bette. The management shud rake care of the food quality and the raw materials.

Nice place to have Chinese Food in Salt Lake.

What I have tried so far:
••Starter••
• Pepper Garlic Chicken: Really good and must try 

••Main Course••
• Devil’s Chicken: Extremely spicy and hot 🌶🌶🌶. So, I would not recommend
• Hot Garlic Chicken: Really good 
• Veg Fried Rice: Okay

# The portions are sufficient.

• Food: 3/5
• Ambience: 2.5/5
• Cost: 3.5/5
• Hospitality: 3/5

On a separate note, the menu card uses some unusual fonts and I found it very difficult to read. I would suggest the restaurant to change it to a more legible font next time.

I visited Nargis after 2.5 years and I saw there is a change in management which is worst. We ordered for a takeaway and they made us wait outside for more than 40mins, and right from the beginning, they have been mentioning that it will just take 10 minutes. This is the worst management that I have ever been. This is the last time that i am visiting this restaurant and i will suggest all my friends the same so that they should never face this false attitude of theirs.

My first visit, and it was impressive. The staff is well dressed and courteous enough, the lighting and music are just right. The only mismatch is the cutlery. When you are serving everything in porcelain, then why the drinkware is steel!?
Now the food part, quality & hygene is good, quantity at par with other restros, price is a bit on the higher notch if compared to restros of same tier. We had pepper chicken, meifoon (Shanghai & Chilli Garlic) and hot garlic chicken. Taste is at par, nothing over the top. Since, I have tried meifoon in quite a few places now, I can vouch for Noodle Oodle for preparing the tastiest ones.
Definitely worth a visit!

The food was very good only thing struck me the price of Fulka roti @25 ₹ . I feel this could be reduced to 10₹ to 15 ₹ max.

yesterday we visited this place with my friends after a long time. Didn't know about the transformer of nargis. I was really shocked looking at the drastic change of nargis. Earlier it was dull and shabby but now the interior is just super. Well they change the entire staff and Management team. Now it is a classy restaurant in town where we can dine. Not only it's looks have changed but the food quality has impovised like anything. Thought the price is little higher than before. But shouldn't except the same price after the transformation. I ordered Mutton Hyderabadi biriyani and mutton rara and my friends ordered pepper garlic crab, thai meifoon, oyster fish and sliced chicken with basil. The quantity of the food served was a lot and the quality was just awesome. I never had such biriyani ever. Thought it isn't similar like our normal Kolkata style but It is far much better than Kolkata style biriyani. Mutton rara was very tasty and the crab was just marvelous. I will come back again and again in this place. Their hospitality was just remarkable. I am really very happy with the place. Keep it up. We appreciate the chance

Nargis is a name that reminds us either of the veteran actress or of the gorgeous Nargis Fakhri…. But here today, it’s all about the beautiful journey of a food lover…. In one monsoon evening when I was ready to head towards my gym, one of my foodie friends gave me a buzz and asked me to visit this place. At first I was in a dilemma, but later I bunked my gym and decided to go there.
                                                                ...

Have gone there many a times...but that was before they renovated it. So this one's for the brand new nargis that was born out of the ashes of the older version.
Interiors of the restaurant is really beautiful and so is the ambience. Post renovations the place seemed more spacious than ever!! They replaced sum of their staff nd dats the wisest deceision on their part as a restraunt like that cant run on rude waiters as it earlier used to be!
We ordered shanghai chicken noodles and schezwan fried rice. Both of them were cooked nicely but i loved the noodles!!! Though it was chiken, they did add egg,mushrooms and baby corn to it. Some of the cons are that the corn and chiken added to it seemed to have aged. So they could certainly put tabs on that and source fresh ingredients for their otherwise perfect concoctions.
Staff behaviour is really appreciable but the service a bit slow. After serving each dish they asked about our opinion on it. They even served us a salad with cucumber,carrot and cabbage. It was kindof sweet and went well with the spicy noodles and rice.

In every part of the city, most of the restaurants serve different types of foods from different cuisine. from a foodie point of view, I think this kind of initiative is a very good move. suppose someone wants to eat Chinese & other one wants to eat complete Indian meal then both of them can eat different food in the same place. keeping this in mind “Nargis” a well-known restaurant situated in FE block, sector 3, near Saltlake came with this unique concept.here you will find both Chinese & Mughlai dishes. a well-decorated restaurant which has a capacity of around 50 plus. nice ambiance with extraordinary interiors makes this place so beautiful. it was a meetup organized by the management of “Nargis” over a food tasting. it was a mix combination of dishes non-veg & veg from Chinese & Mughlai section. we had an extensive amount of dishes, after completing all the starters it was quite difficult for me to try other dishes but somehow I managed and tried the main course along with the dessert. started with a glass of fresh lime soda sweet & salt which is a cool & refreshing beverage. food tasting began with numerous types of Indian & Chinese starters,
                                          ...

The environment is fairly peaceful with no noise around , ideal for family get togethers, group parties , gossips. The menu offers a large variety of mouth watering starters as well as the main course , at a very reasonable price. Service is prompt and decent.Thankfully, the owners and managers are always around and willing to exchange words with their clients. I highly recommend all to visit this restaurant.

Not so much satisfied. First of all, the plates were not warm at all. Then the service was slow. Actually there was only 2 service boy only with lots of customers. We ordered 1 double cooked crispy chilly fish, 1 Cantonese mixed noodles and 1 fish manturian. Quantity was good for 2 people but quality was little disappointing. Double cooked crispy chilly fish was marvelous and set the expectation level high. But Cantonese mixed noodles was missed out its crunch and fish manturian was not up to the mark.
But real surprise was yet to come.
As per the menu card Cantonese mixed noodles is charged 210 and fish manturian is 260 but when the bill came both the dishes were priced as 290. When I pointed it out they revised only Cantonese mixed noodles' price but manturian's wrong price still was there. They took another 15mins to rectify that and gave us the accurate bill.
I hope they will rectify their missed outputs till we visit again (though I doubt it).

This is located opposite central park. Its interior is basically decorated with posters of nargis and uttam kumar. I went there twice with my friend. Once had sweet corn chicken soup and schezuan chicken noodles and pepper chicken dry. The soup was very very tasty and the pepper chicken was so soft and tasty. I would go back for that again. :) but the noodles was so spicy i could hard have a spoonful of it.

Recently this place is renovated and now it looks a bit classy as well, which it lacks previously. During our last visit, we ordered burnt garlic, chilli fried rice (chicken) and teriyaki chicken. The quality is decent and quantity is more than sufficient for two people. Service has improved as well. Quite pocket friendly.

Located near Central park (FE Block) Salt lake City, the reincarnated Nargis is a perfect place for dining. It started with all the new food menu adding up the Mughlai dishes along with Chinese and Indian. Food quality is quite good especially the chinese cuisine. We had ordered for chicken clear soup along with starters- chicken fried wantons and barbecue fish which were tasty while the Main course included panfried noodles, fried rice(highly recommended) which was authentic in its taste, oyster fish and chilli wine chicken(mothwatering dish). Coming to the desserts (darshan and toffeewalnut icecream) it was pure bliss.. the icecream tasted heavenly and would strongly recommend all to experience the feeling. Service needs to be a little faster. Overall ambience, cleanliness and management is quite impressive. A big thumbs up 🖒

I was not satisfied with this place at all, infact I didn't even like it, when we visited this place, there were only two people having dinner, I asked for roti, they didn't have it, so have to settle for paratha. Order took ages to arrive and didn't even taste that good.

Should not visit. Not Worth the money u pay. Money is precious. Spend lesser amount at Tangra or Shiraz or Aminia. They are food specialist and will deliver quality and taste with respect to money charged. Do not waste money here. How can noodles at Nargis be Rs 200 against Tangra charging you just Rs 170 !! No one can answer this.

On our first visit to Nargis, we found the place was reserved by some people for a birthday party. Few months later, we came to this place again...co-incidentially, with the same group of friends. We had chicken noodles and garlic chicken. The rice items weren't available at that time....although it was lunch hour only. The interior isn't much spacious. The food is okay-ish, considering the pricing was on the lower side. Lacks the factor that would make the customers visit it for a second time.

The food quality is just moderate rather of lower quality to be precise. The ambience is not absolutely awesome. Time taken to serve the food is also more or less ok. However, the quantity is much less compared to other restaurants. So to sum up if you are looking for a low budget dining experience you can hang out there.

Went there only once and will never visit again. We ordered some fried rice with red pepper chicken. We were quite happy with the quantity which was served, but the moment we had the food, it was our first and last visit there. The rice lacked flavour  and the red pepper chicken was just drentched in tomato ketchup. Really a horrible experience.

I visited Nargis quite few times as there are no other option for having food and every time I came out with different levels of disappointment and horribleness!!! that's like an 'ooooougggghhhhh'...if anyone ever suggest me to have food there again I would prefer being hungry!
The last experience beat everything. We ordered chicken fried rice and chicken kasha (nothing else were available then; or else don't know who takes chicken kasha with fried rice) and we got the food after 40minutes (and, that was their fastest service-claimed by themselves)! but guess what we got!!! Mixed fried rice and chicken bharta..(as the waiter heard Mixed in the place of chicken and he found out chicken kasha is not available so he took it up on himself to change the selection of food; how helpful: but I didn't even know mixed and chicken is homonymous..) anyway we had to send back the food as both of us were allergic and it's another wait for 1hour! But they were quite keen so that we finish our food within 15minutes!
very pleasant experience I must say!

When you go out to eat, it's not just about the food. It's the whole experience. The food, obviously is the most crucial factor. But other things like service, environment, pricing, ambience etc matter too. 

This restaurant failed on each and every criteria. A sheer disappointment is what it was. Absolutely tasteless food, equally horrible service. And the attitude of the staff, like they were paying us for eating there. 

Agreed, it's an old restaurant in the area, but with so many restaurants coming up everyday, why would people even go to such places where you don't even have a good time. 

Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

Well, they have definitely modified the concept of “Dal Makhani”, by changing the texture to yellow (i.e. using yellow dal instead of black), adding too much of Rajma as well topping it with Lotus seeds. We all know that change happens for something better, but this change took place for something not so good …… worse rather.

I caught sight of this restaurant while commuting to office - near the Netaji Park at Karunamoyee, Saltlake and I decided to experiment with them by ordering their Dal Makhani. Delivery was smooth – within the stipulated 60 minutes to my workplace at Sector 5. Well, they do charge a few bucks extra for doing so (which is perfectly ok).

Coming to the food, it was well packed (a plastic container covered with plastic film) and steaming hot when delivered. But ……. taste – very roadside and to add-on, that bit of hoggin completely ruined my meal. I had to discard quite a portion of the Dal as quantity served was great.

Since this was a delivery and not a dine-in, I can’t really comment on their restaurant ambience. Prices are reasonable but they severely lack in taste and quality – think a dozen times before visiting!

Nargis is a very old multi cuisine restaurant in the lanes of saltlake. It provides with a varied range of food items. The place is quite simple and nothing over the top. The service is a bit slow sometimes but the food is quite good. The fried rice and the hunan chicken served to us were quite tasty and the quantity was also good. Very affordable and the food is good in taste. :)

Another dish that I love here is the Jumbo Cutlet (not the regular Chicken Cutlet), they use chicken fillets in it and not keema stuffing, this jumbo cutlet is delicious, a must try from this shop.

I had initially given this place a review maybe a year back. Now after the revamp, I visited here with colleagues for lunch and have to say I had no choice but to change my review and increase the rating (The previous review is also mentioned below). Loved the decor first of all. It is not at par with all nearby restaurants if not better. Now, the main part of any eatery, the food, in this case was spot on. We tried only a few things, the chicken gravy chowmein, the chicken meifoon, dragon chicken. One of us had the fish masala with rice. Anyway, the overall experience was very good. Things were cooked and presented properly. 
The place now has much better abidance, better service and altogether a far better experience. Good job guys. Definitely going back.

(Previous Review: A decent place with decent food. Justified for the price. The soups are good, even the hakka chow is good enough. Avoid the schezwan chicken specifically, probably the worst I have ever tasted anywhere. Apart from that particular dish, others are decent. I have had to go to this place quite a few times due to work in that area and experience regarding service and food is okay. Service is quick, the place is clean. If one is in this sector, the better choice amongst others)

All throughout its so so. Hopefully comparing to street juice store margins is pathetic a juice so much price but so awful they need improvement.

Location : Opposite to Central Park , Salt lake .

Ambiance : Good enough . Nothing to frown at .

Service : Always at hand and quick to belt out suggestions . Waiting time : 15 minutes which is quite the industry standard for chinese  cuisine .

Food : Nargis is one of those places that values " Quantity " over " Quality " . I'm not saying that their food is downright disgusting but it's nothing special and feels just about average . One thing it does offer is " QUANTITY " so much so that two people ordering Chicken Fried Rice with Egg &  Mixed Scezwan Fried Rice  had to literally take 45 minutes to stuff it all down !!  Add chicken Manchurian to that  and I  didn't feel the need to eat for 10 hours  or so.  

Grammar Nazis have by now glued in to the " Scezwan"  . That says it all . How can you expect a restaurant to dish out authentic Chinese cuisine when they can't even get the spelling of the term " Schezwan " right !  It's pathetic just like their food !!  Chicken Fried rice with egg was just about Ok . Bland taste . It just didn't  tingle my senses at all and the only reprieve that the Schezwan rice brought was the color and the Spicy flavor . Both were equally average in everything apart from quantity !  Even the Manchurian wasn't able to light up my mood ... 

But all's well that ends well . Ordered up the so called " Love Poison " which was a custom made ice cream made from Chocolate , Butterscotch & Strawberry   plus nuts and bits of cherries here and there . Believe me : This was the only shining moment !  Decadent , tasty . It really filled up the void that the main course failed to do . Hence only felt the need to click it's pics .

Cost for 2 :  400 plus 

Final Conclusion : If anyone thinks that this place deserves accolades for their preparations then I can guarantee you that they  have never set foot in HATARI , TUNG FONG  or MAINLAND CHINA .  There are times when your wallet is extremely thin only then but otherwise no... Just a casual joint you go to in order to escape cooking for the night ! Nothing more than that....

Foods are tasteless and of low quality. Management is inefficient and also don't expect any quality in service.

A VERY GOOD CHINESE RESTAURANT @ REASONABLE PRICE

* Location : 5 mins walk from Karunamoyee mor just opposite central park.

* Ambience : I ve come across this food joint numerous times n after eating their Chinese items, I wondered why I haven't visit before. However, better late than never. 
A small street food joint is decorated perfectly like a Chinese restaurant... dim dragon lights, pictures of Chinese girls etc. One thing I ve found exceptional in Chinese surrounding, some pictures of old Bengali movies and actors. Its very catchy indeed. Chairs,tables and sofas are normal, yet very comfortable. Decor is sober,yet quite fascinating. I liked it so much. (rating 9 on 10)

* Food : This food joint is very popular among salt lake residents because of its beautiful and tasty Chinese foods. All ingredients were perfect and cooked so well. I ordered :
              1. Chicken drum stick for starter. Big pieces,no heavy coats, juicy and cooked nicely. (rating 8 on 10)
              2. We had American chopsey for main course. The gravy of chopsey is the main thing which was cooked magnificently. This chopsey is my hot favorite and if a restaurant presents this in this authentic Chinese way,I have to rate them 10 on 10.
                  3. Chicken mein foon was delicious. Its a kind of noodle rice to Chinese people,but to us it was a kind of fine chowmein. Any adjective falls short here to describe how much I liked this item. It was too good. Very soft noodles,light,non oily and quite healthy I must say. (rating 10 on 10)
                    4. Boneless chilly chicken : this item was also a very good one. (rating 9 on 10)

* Price : If you compare the quantity they provide with its price in the menu card, u ll be amazed. I should say it is one of the CHEAPEST AUTHENTIC CHINESE RESTAURANT in Salt lake area. Amazing food with amazing price tag. (rating 10 on 10)

* Management : I ve never seen any street food small joint miss manage anything with customers or with foods. Take away sell was larger than sitting n eating and all customers were very happy with arrangements. I didn't find a slight wrong. (rating 9 on 10)

* Why recommended : 1. most beautiful Chinese items. So every Chinese food lover must visit.
       2. Price is very cheap compared to its quantity.
        3. Mein foon....should be taken. All mein foon items are superb indeed.

A legendary outlet, a part and parcel of what Salt Lake has been through all these years, and a much preferred joint for all of us to hop into and enjoy a sumptuous lunch or dinner along with some quirky chit-chats, Nargis is something which has defined the very essence of Salt Lake since ages. Being the brainchild of one of the most popular Bengali actor of all time, there is a certain lineage and nostalgia that has been associated to this name and hence has garnered much love and attention among the local residents. 

Lately though, the quality of food had fallen, the discontent was rising, and people wanted a change. Luckily, it came quick when the restaurant was rebranded, refurbished and relaunched by a young couple who made sure to completely overhaul the menu, interiors, ambiance and most importantly tried to bring about a change in the perception of people that they may have had till date about this restaurant.

Our gastronomical saga kicked off with the likes of the Pepper Garlic Crab, each portion of whose meat was fingerlickingly devilicious. The crab was quite gigantic in size and justified well with the price tag associated with it. Next came in line the Fried Chicken Wings and Chili Mountain Lobster. The Wings were crunchy and crispy and had a nice decent batter which did not get soggy. The Lobster was delicious to its epitome but I would have preferred to be a bit spicier going by the name given to it. 

But nevertheless, the gluttony of getting a lobster all for yourself instilled a sheer ecstasy in itself which was beyond any comparison or debate. Next came the Cracker Prawn, Double Fried Lamb, Chili Soya Octopus, Vegetable Drumsticks and Fish Fry. The Double Fried Lamb was perfectly made, with the right amount of Soya and Black bean sauce along with a touch of crunch to it. The Cracker Prawn was crispy and had a nice succulent layer of prawn hidden inside it. 

The Chili Soya Octupus was not soggy at all, which is a common phobia with these preparations now-a-days. Not being chewy, the crispiness of the Octopus’s completely blew us off out senses and pinched us to long for more. The saga for starters ended with the lovely Vegetable Drumsticks, which I personally found to be quite intriguing. The way the veggies were mashed and brought along together to be given a form of a drumstick was clearly award-winning.

Moving on to the maincourses, we had to our disposal Prawn Hyderabadi Biryani, Kashmiri Pulao, Mutton Keema Matar, Methi Matar Malai, Murg Malai, Chicken Bharta, Thai Meifoon, Seafood Fried Rice and Fancy Potato in Chili Soya, For breads, we had Plain Phulka, Tawa Paratha and Lachcha Paratha. After being fully stuffed with the heavenly starters, but we still made some way for the main course items. I tried my hands upon the Tawa Paratha and chicken Bharta along with a spoon of Hyderabadi Biryani. 

The Paratha went very well along with the flavorful Bharta and I quite happened to like the combination. The Biryani was light and fragrant and did not boast of excess rose water. The seafood fried rice yet was another hit preparation being loaded with ample prawns and squids and paired well with the tangy and sweet Fancy Potato in Chili Soya. For deserts, we gorged upon Toffee Walnut with Vanila and Hot Gulab Jamun with Vanilla. Ecstatic, Gluttonous, Beckoning? 

Should you choose to dine out here soon or order for a home-delivery? Well, I would leave this for you to decide. One thing’s for sure! There has been a drastic and noticeable change in the perception I personally had towards Nargis. If you thought Salt Lake did not have a classy multicuisine restaurant within affordable pricing charts, think again!

I would avoid the momos,but the sides and noodles are worth trying. They take a while.for delivery, but if you're say watching a match and ordering in for the family - this here is a place worth going to.

A tastefully decked kitschy eatery with Japanese ukiyo-style pictures of kimono-clad geishas and peacocks on walls and a collage-like montage of snaps of the deceased legendary and popular Bengali screen actor Anup Kumar who owned the restaurant, Nargis' food is not quite up to the mark as it should. I've tried their lemon chicken and noodles, but despite their sufficient amount, the after taste of food doesn't quite stay with you once you leave the restaurant.

This restaurant is close to home, hence visited by me quite a lot. Everything is mostly good and is quite inexpensive for the quantity they serve.
The moghlai paratha is huuge and really oily, but that's what makes it really good.
Chinese is a good idea, since it's pretty much similar to all chinese food.
It's a good restaurant when you are in a pocket pinch and want to fill up your stomach and not eat at home.

Food delivered on time.however only the veg fried rice ordered was edible. The mutter paneer and lemon coriander soup were too spicy. Soup was ordered for my daughter however she refused to taste it too seeing the colour(green colour added) and the no.of finely sliced green chillies in the soup. Too spicy. Mutter paneer was tad too oily and too spicy. Oil floating on top the mutter and paneer made it look repulsive too. And it also had a dark colour due to overcooking of spices.
Overall Sunday lunch experience was simply disheartening.

I've been coming to Nargis for years now -- and by that I mean I used to, and then had to stop. I remember a Nargis where you had to take your food away because the seating was atrocious, and one where there was no air conditioning.

Luckily Nargis, for me, has managed to maintain their standard of decent food and prompt service. They may not serve the best food in town, but the serve a decent meal -- and certainly a reasonably priced one. 

Nargis used to have the best pakoras when I was a child -- something which remains to be seen. As of now, Nargis combines minimalistic decor with decent food and service to form what may be an ideal place to have lunch with friends after a movie.

Good stuff!

This is my favorite place to hang out with my college buddies. The dishes they serve are delicious; the pocket pinch is moderate; the waiters are polite enough; the inner part of the restaurant is comfortable and beautifully decorated (yes, the only problem I've with this place is how bland the outer part looks). The dishes that we really love: mixed gravy noodles, chicken hakka noodles, paneer pulao, any kind of fried rice, any kind of soup, chilli chicken, crispy baby corn and chicken, butter chicken and more. For us, it's a place for adda and fun, for gluttonous indulgence and burping contentedly. 

P.S. I don't know why this restaurant has such a low rating here in Zomato. But maybe I'm being emotional here while rating this place, or maybe they really serve decent food and our taste buds are not dull. Anyway, I've never ordered any parcel from this place, so can't vouch for their quality.

This restaurant is located at Sector 3, Salt Lake very close to the Central Park. Whenever, I happen to be  at my grandfather's place I opt for a home delivery from here. The chilli chicken they deliver is amongst the best I have ever tasted and is one of my favourites from this place. I have also been to this restaurant once and found it to be a good value for money place. Most of the items they serve are delicious enough and they come at very reasonable prices. Ambiance is good, staff is decent and there is plenty of hassle free parking space. Overall, a decent restaurant which can definitely be called upon in times of need.

This place has a decent ambience and ok food, nothing out of the ordinary. Located near Karunamoyee more, this place is quite well known. The food is okayish and the quality of food fluctuates. My last visit there did not go so well. We ordered Chilli Garlic Red Pepper chicken for our starter and it was too dry and wasn't satisfactory enough. Next came the Chicken Mushroom noodles with Egg with Chicken with capsicum as a side dish. The noodles were ok but the chicken side dish proved to be bland. The ambience is ok, and the prices are reasonable. The beverages, however, are charged high. All in all, it's a below average experience every time I go there. So give it a try only if you have no option.

It was a hot and humid summer evening when I hit the place. I was badly hungry. I ordered Hakka noodles , dry chicken schezwan and garlic fish. The foods were very tasty and personally I think this is one of the best restaurant which serves authentic and tasty Chinese foods.

I really love the simple but elegant ambiance with dim lights . One point I wanna to mention about the decor.There is a big collage of famous Bengali Actor Anup Kumar. Although I am not sure but some of my friends informed me that actualy the owner of the restaurant is the Daughter of Anup Kumar.

This is one of those places which always remain in your last resort list whenever you are in that part of the city. Good ambiance, easy on the pocket and decent food if you order proper. We ordered chicken moghlai paratha for some odd reason- that turned out to be a big dud. The chow and garlic chicken were decent enough though. (Or maybe, we were just hungry enough for it to have felt that way. )

My last tryst with this place was on Diwali night. After hours of watching the fireworks and bursting crackers we landed up here weary and spent. Little did we know that our menu would be pre-decided, paratha with garlic chicken. A rather quixotic combination but they were as the waiter said the only items available. The place is a tribute to kishore kumar with his photographs adorning the wall. The food is cheap but service very poor.

Been there quite a few times.. Nothing special.. Foods are just "OK".. But not upto the expectations that will be built inside you while entering the place, as the ambience is good enough to instill positivity within you.. Yet the main stuff, the food, will let you down (also because of the "not upto the price" issue).. <unless you are in a very very good mood, enough to enjoy yourself there>

Had to catch up with a friend near office and since I was bored with city centre and sector 5, thought of trying out the food at Nargis. 
Situated near central park, in the same line adjacent to ground zero cafe and koshe kosha.
My friend and I went there with low expectations for a no frills yet filling lunch. We ordered a chicken gravy chow mein and a fish with mushroom and vegetables.

It took around 15 minutes for the order to reach our tables. In the mean time I noticed the ambiance. Pretty simple and laid back atmosphere. Most of the tables were occupied which means that this a pretty popular eating joint in the neighbourhood. 
Coming to the food, the gravy chow mein was strictly okay. Quantity was good but average when comes to taste. The fish was good. They serve basa and was not smelly at all. Gravy and veggies tasted good but the gravy could have been thicker.
But overall a decent experience as the pricing was easy on the pocket. They did not have desserts or any fancy drinks which is a let down. Also cards are not accepted.

Had to catch up with a friend near office and since I was bored with city centre and sector 5, thought of trying out the food at Nargis. 
Situated near central park, in the same line adjacent to ground zero cafe and koshe kosha.
My friend and I went there with low expectations for a no frills yet filling lunch. We ordered a chicken gravy chow mein and a fish with mushroom and vegetables.

It took around 15 minutes for the order to reach our tables. In the mean time I noticed the ambiance. Pretty simple and laid back atmosphere. Most of the tables were occupied which means that this a pretty popular eating joint in the neighbourhood. 
Coming to the food, the gravy chow mein was strictly okay. Quantity was good but average when comes to taste. The fish was good. They serve basa and was not smelly at all. Gravy and veggies tasted good but the gravy could have been thicker.
But overall a decent experience as the pricing was easy on the pocket. They did not have desserts or any fancy drinks which is a let down. Also cards are not accepted.

Located almost opposite to the Central Park, Nargis offers decent Chinese food at at a reasonable price. The seating space is quite enough and the ambiance is nice. I used to work near that area and had the opportunity to visit this place as well as placed orders. Their food is quite tasty and the service seemed OK to me. I'd say, it's a good value for money.

A great place to go with a group and fill your tummy as much as you can because the taste of the food is really good and the price is also very pocket friendly. So, eating a lot of good food and spending a pocket friendly amount is a great choice to go for.

The staff is also good and the service is great. This place is definitely worth a few visits.

I have been to this place quite a few times. once I went for a lunch with my friend. We orderd and food was good. But the worst thing was after our lunch was over when I was paying with my card they said no Cards accepted. Only cash... daahh... I had to  walk upto the atm and get cash and then pay. Very bad. U ppl should work on this fact.itz really uncomfortable.

Well, I have been to these place for quite some time. First let me write about the ambiance. Out door arrangements are quite good for a dinner or lunch with friends. And you can also have food if you want to have it in your car. So if you are going for an outdoor fun and food within this budget its a good choice. Now inside the restaurant there are two parts.one is the outer part which is not that fascinating. And the inside part which is good respectively. But then yes you have to pay exrta for is too????
Now coming to the most important FOOD PART. Food is the best part so far I have covered. Although crab is never available. Do not know why they kept it on there menu card. We have ordere  chicken clean soupe and hot and shower soupe, one mixed hakka chow and one garlic chicken, and two sweet soda. Quantity was sufficient. And let me tell you again, this place has never disappointed me   as far as food part is concerned. The food is always yummmm???? The reason of this rating is that they can really improve is there service. If you are having this kind of restaurant in a place like this you have to have a fantastic service along with quality food as well. Which was kind of so so there.
But the final verdict is do not go there for any special day occasion,  that place is not really that special ???? But yes if you are planning for a quick tym pas with friends along with good food, this is the place where you can rush to.

Went there after the renovation of the nrw place.
The interior is quite impressive but alas! Nargis has been my go to place since my college days. It used to serve one of the best chinese dishes. So I did have great expectations from it when I visited it again. Here are the things which made me regret my decisions:
1. The AC didn't seem to work. On enquiring we were told some sort of a work was going on so line was fluctuating.Ever heard of Inverters?
2. The Quantity and Quality of the food have surprisingly decreased way too much. The portions being served won't even fill up 1 person.
3. They serve 12 pieces of chicken in every chinese side dish. And have no system of half a plate
 Good enough. The chicken was hard from within. But the gravy was good. Also received 2-3 complementary hair samples in the food. 
4. Chicken fried rice had no chicken. My friend literally asked me why I had ordered egg fried rice! 
5. Mind you they are charging a total of 18% taxes on the food too ! 
Would you come back again? If you want to waste your money, feel free to enter through the gates of the new and revamped Nargis !

The place, as I said, is very warm and comfortable. The decor is nice, not too gaudy, but the USP is the big poster on the wall. There is also an outside seating space, which is really nice. The staff is okayishly prompt. The food tastes great, and the quantity is sufficient for two people. The prices are fairly reasonable. All in all, money well spent.

This is the very first restaurant of my food journey. So, this restaurant is close to my heart. I really don't remember how many times I've visited this restaurant. They serves very good and quality Chinese food. Their must try items are crispy chicken, chicken butter masala, chilli paneer, sechuan chicken. Overall this is a very good and reasonable restaurant to visit.

Had lunch will a colleague of mine. Had heard that it belonged to the son of a yesteryear tollywood actor Anup. The collage of scenes of his movies on the wall said the same story. The restaurant was sort of empty by 12:30pm when we ordered our food but people started to come in in a while. 
We ordered chicken drumstick for the starter and mixed chowmine and chilly chicken for the main course. 
The service was good and quick, mixed with the ambience, it was a good place. The price too is reasonable considering the restaurants nearby. The USP being its proximity to the main road. 
P. S- next time I'd be visiting the koshe-kosha restaurant nearby.

Nargis is one restaurant which i like because it is this little place which is situated at a cozy nook of Salt Lake near Karunamoyee Bus stand and has a serenity of its own. The pictures of actor Anup Kumar on the walls gives a nostalgic feel and you will end up discussing the golden era of bengali cinema for sure. The food price is still very reasonable compared to other restaurants which are on the same lane. Quality wise the food here has a consistency and they have maintained a standard over all these years. I like the chicken hot & sour soup here and also the gravy noodles. The paan shop outside is an added advantage if you want to smoke or have a pan after having food.

This restaurant was like my second home during my college years. I used to frequent this place almost like once every week. The best thing about the food here is the quantity. The quality may not be top notch but its doable. Once they used to serve rotis and parathas here but then one fine day they told that the particular cook ran away :-p
Eveything starting from all variants of the fried rice, chickens, noodles taste good and I believe you will still be awestruck by the quantity they serve. 
But the usp is the pan shop just outside. After you dine, dont forget to take a sweet paan there!!

I had once taken home delivery from this veteran restaurant. We had ordered for Thai Chicken. It was different but it was really good. The item was cooked in light gravy. They used adequate shrimp and button mushroom to make the gravy thick.
I would have rated them 4/5 but then the service is too slow. The restaurant is run by an old man whose behavior is not much congenial. They never pick up the fone and I have derived this perception out of my experience for 3 consecutive Saturday evenings. And yes, they are very lathergic to home delivery. It defines typical attitude of Kolkata local restaurants that has good customer footfall. Hence 1 mark deducted.
Overall it is recommendable if you can go and have your meal or take delivery from their outlet. Bt given by the attitide and body language, its well.understood that the owner isnt bothered if u rate them 0.5 or 5 out of 5.

I still remember the first day I had been to this restaurant. I found myself in a medium sized sheresta with a huge collage of the the legendary actor Anup Chatterjee hanging on the wall,and barely crowded.
The place was very neat and the first dish I tasted here was the Fish Kabiraji Cutlet.The service was very slow(since it was a newly opened restaurant).
Moving on from here,I find that Nargis is a small restaurant that has evolved from a tiny spatial restaurant to something bigger I size.I mean after almost 8 years I find everyone in Salt Lake talking about Nargis. The best part is it serves various mocktails as well nowadays. And to be very frank this place has maintained the quality of food they used to serve(quantity has increased and of course the price). It is so good that I would still prefer to eat at Nargis than any Punjabi Dhaba nearby.
Coming to the food I would definitely like to mention about the Chicken Kabiraji Cutlet and Chicken Moghlai Paratha-which are simply outstanding in taste.
For the Awadhi Khana one can simply opt for the Butter Naan and Chicken Bharta-simple taste,healthy and still fits your budget.
The only dish I really like from the Chinese section is the Chilli Garlic dry Chicken.A small tip:have this dish with a peg of whisky on a Saturday evening.I often order this dish at my place.
Overall I would give it a 4.0 for the ambience,staff and the food.I would have gone for a 4.5 had they improved the home delivery service.Trust me it can be really slow and they do not take orders when it rains.Still a lot to catch up with....

The main reason for our visit to Nargis  was one of my friends was giving her birthday treat there. Although in the beginning the place didn't strike us as a very up to the actual standard or norms yet their service was quite impromptu and up to the mark. The food too was really delicious . We being great foodies had ordered quite a bit and were not disappointed  in both proportions or in taste. The food tasted excellent. The quantity of one serving was enough for two people. The perks of the restaurant was since it is not very gaudy in appearance most people tend to overlook it hence we had the entire place to our selves and we were happily chatting and clicking photos . With no one to disturb we even had the privacy and we could be ourselves :). Over all i think this place is quite under rated by the previous reviewers. A pocket friendly , amiable place serving great food! Would love to visit again !

It was one of the places I frequented when I was back in Saltlake. My home was nearby and it was more of a local restaurant where you give a order of a home delivery when you don't want to cook. The food is not great but it is not that bad either. A good place for the locals. Ambience is okay and the service is good. Plus its pocket friendly and the quantities are huge. It does have a great foot fall though, The location has its advantage.

Situated just opposite Central Park this place is very accessible yet not too busy.Good things end there.The ambience is very unflattering with grimy floors and shabby seating.The people are polite enough but the food takes an eternity to be served.The chinese is okayish but the indian food is way too oily.Sometimes i was served with burnt paranthas.On a brighter note the quantities served are huge.Recommended only if every other food outlet in salt lake is closed.Overall a very ordinary experience.

I just felt like writing a review for Nargis although I haven't visited this place for more than 6 years! This occupies a special place in my heart for the restaurant was a part of my school - college growing up days!
Firstly , this place is located bang opposite to Central Park - therefore the clientele can very well be all the throngs of couples who enjoy the "solitude: of CP in the daytime and come back famished for a snack in the twilight hours !
I always enjoyed visiting here - the rolls are great , the food is decent and the taste is worth going back to. 
This place is nothing outstanding , but if you're in the area and in the mood for a quick eat, this is worth your while!

This is just below my aunt's house and I have been here quite a few times. Nothing to be proud of about the ambiance. I mean it is just a small shop where you can sit and eat in case you are low on cash and do not need high maintenance interiors. Now coming to the food, I would say that the chicken roll is quite nice (not Zeeshan standards of course) and the chicken cutlet is good too. However, we stopped ordering from there after my mum saw some unclean method of cooking from my aunt's balcony. A couple of years down the line, we did order a few rolls though and it tasted nice. Btw, this place is owned by late actor Anoop Kumar's wife!

located near central park, this eatery is thronged by students of schools and colleges.

the food is average. all the dishes are highly indianised version of their namesake. the taste of gravy of many dishes are oddly same.

the soups here are the best part of the menu and are tasty. i also like their chilli baby corn dish. the meat and fish dishes are adequately cooked. the quantity is adequate and very suitable if you are on a tight budget.

decent place to go if you are hungry and happen to be in the locality.

I used to often go here during my class XII days. I had several tutions in the adjoining area,and after classes we used to go here. However,with passing time the place seems to have lost its charm. The decor is minimalistic,and the staff seem stiff. Not really a foodie's heaven. But then again,this is a medium budget place after all. The quality of food is average.Not bad,but nothing spectacular either. Food quantities could do with a bit of improvement too. Perhaps my preferences as an adult have changed,but I really did miss the aura that used to pull me here in my adolescent days.

The most important thing I like Nargis for, is the quantity of its food. If you are new here think twice before ordering. We ordered Chicken Schezwan Fried Rice and Chicken Butter Masala. One full plate for the two of us, still we could not complete the whole meal. The rice was pretty good. The chicken was a little different. It had small flake like pieces of chicken in that yummy buttery gravy.Their Chicken Mughlai is pretty awesome. And again the quantity is more than enough. But they take much time to serve foods. That's their most remarkable drawback I found.

This place, not sure, but has something to do with popular yesteryears bengali movie actor Anup Kumar. Probably this is a shop owned by his family. You will a lot of portraits of this very talented actor on the wall of this restaurant.

Nargis is a popular food joint between Netaji island and FE island in Sector 3. I have been here for so many times and it's quite an affordable place. Though it's a multi cuisine restaurant but I would suggest to try their chicken moglai and rolls. I have had Chinese and Indian food both and they are consistent in quantity and quality. Sometimes it gets just out of balance regarding the food quality but needless to say you won't get consistent quality food from a restaurant every time.

They serve outside at the parking too if one need to have snacks in personal vehicle. Frequent visitors are majorly from the near by place and they give home delivery equal priority for faster delivery. Serving time and Service need to improve with proper cleanliness. Over all it's a nice cozy place to have dinner with your loved ones.

Again for this restaurant also the only good thing is its location.
I have been there once and did not like the taste much.It was average or below average we can say.Reasonable restaurant.

Nargis, located opposite 'Banabitan', is a budget-friendly place.

Had their Chinese as well as their Indian, both being equally good (but not, anything great).

The staff behaviour is good.

The ambience is warm...the place being always lit-up by foodies.

But, the place needs a bit improvement decoration wise. Although, a year back they re-decorated the place but they can do better.

During autumn or spring evenings one can also enjoy the outdoor seating, which is pleasant.

I am a fan of the chicken cutlets here. They are truly a thing of beauty. Also, the chicken pakoras are not bad too. The best part is the fact that the car parking is really easy, and they have a lovely decor. However, service definitely needs to be better.

If you are searching for a Cozy eating joint with low pocket pinch , Nargis can be a very good option for you. I am a fan of their chinese food though this is a multicuisine restaurant.

Tried their Chicken Hot n Sour Soup, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Garlic Chicken. All of them turned out to be real good.

Anyways, they still have a good chance of improvement in respect to cleanliness and ambience.

not bad.
the location is also nice if you wanna sit outside and have the food.
ambiance is not over-the-top, but good. But i've always felt that the huge collage of the actor Uttam Kumar doesn't fit well with the rest of the decor.
food is decent too...they do know how to make good babycorn appetizers.
overall satisfactory

It's at a 10min walk from Karunamoyee. You can either go inside and sit in the A/C or if you like open places, you may sit outside. The specialty here is the 'Spcl Mughlai paratha'. I haven't had a better 'Mughlai Paratha' than this place. Another item which I like over here is the 'Vegetable Chicken Soup'. It's a clear soup and tastes nice. This place is also light on your pocket. But the service has enough chance of improvement.

This is a good looking place where food is served along with human hair and even insects . I twice got such stuff served in my chow. According to them hot and sour soup is a burnt piece of shit and if u complain they will behave like , ur first time having that. " ap nahi jante hot and sour soup hota he kaya, first time aye he kaya?"... PLZ visit at ur own RISK.

Located opposite to Central Park,this is a nice place overall....the gravy chomein is good along with the dry chillichicken and other non veg staters.the staff is very friendly and always serve you with a smile...im a regular customer here..and i would say...this place is quite nice...only negative point is that the indian dishes and soups are not so nice...otherwise its a good place to eat when you have a low budget.
