'Taj', the name is enough and no need to explain how much special the place is...their royal ambiance, hospitality each and everything is beyond perfect...we visited there the day before yesterday for the open air movie screening and after that we went to souk for a dinner...as we visited there to celebrate our 1st anniversary,it was much more special for us... we ordered samak moroccaine which is a preparation of bhetki fish and very much tasty and not spicy or oily..  the second thing was macbous al dazaz which is little bit spicy but delicious... except these we had the soup and ginger brew..but among these the soup was not as good as i expected... but the showstopper was the rose petal ice cream...it was just waaoow!!! This made my day and is the only thing which will attract me again nd again there...

Souk is one of our favourite and regular spots- it has excellent Middle eastern food and a wide variety of vegetarian options. My last visit in particular stands out unfortunately because it made 2 people in a party of 5 very very sick. We visited on 14th October for dinner, and our friend Rishav Kajaria was with us who is a known name/face to all Souk staff. While all the food seemed delicious, we ordered a falafel wrap that was really below average. Me and another friend had a part of it and decided to leave it. The next morning, both me and him were extremely sick. We were unable to get out of bed, our stomachs churning and temperature rising, with frequent bathroom visits. Cannot believe a 5 star hotel restaurant can cause this. I also double checked- both of us had not eaten out of home the last few days and we both had the exact same symptoms the next day. We suspect it was the falafel wrap, but really it could just be any spoilt curd/any stale food that reacted massively in our bodies over the others. But it was the Souk meal. Shocked to say the least.

The spread is truly awesome! People have been complaining that inspite of being a Lebanese spread it was missing baba ganoush but I can assure you that it was definitely there with all its splendour. 
Though some of the items were tailor made for our team but some are worth mentioning like the chickpea falafel, lamb tajine and chicken Swarma.

The dessert spread was good as well. Specially liked the tarts.

Had visited Souk to try out their buffet spread. The menu consisted of interesting choices of Mediterranean food, comprising of preparations in Lebanese, Greek, Turkish styles. We tasted their shawarma too, which was wholesome and tasteful. The other items were just okay, in-fact they tasted a bit bland. Nothing spectacular! Perhaps it was my 1st attempt at Mediterranean cuisine and I had expected too much from their  spread. The desserts were good. As it is a Taj restaurant, the ambiance and decor require no new introduction.. They are marvelous as it is. Its worth a visit once surely, for the different types of middle eastern cuisines

They serve sparkling wine or vodka as complementary drinks. Something which was very fascinating. Variety of veg food is far better than the non veg one. Shawarma can be better, far better.

We ordered hummus bil lahm and Dijaj Moroccan as appetizer and Kotopoulo Stifado , chicken shavarma as main course and for the dessert we take Baklava and orange flower ice cream..Every item was specially the dessert...I will definitely visit there for baklava..

This place is so beautiful. I went for celebrating our anniversary in this beautiful place called SOUK. The food was really nice, as we don't drink nice mocktails were served in our table. I would love to visit this place again. The behaviour of the manager and the staffs were really nice and pleasant. Thanks for making our day even more special.

Had been there for experiencing a great taste of middle east and it was not gone in vain. They made us happy by serving some delicious dishes like hummus and all. Though it was very different from our common cuisines like chinese, Indian but the taste will flow your mind away to the middle east where you can get an opportunity to create a memory of those foods in an astounding ambience and hospitality. I'm telling you again n again if you judge these foods with our daily cuisines, you'll do mistake. You've to taste those the way they're so that you will be able to have. However, it's beyond explanation about the hotel because everyone knows its standard, so they also didn't deprive us and lastly the behavior of the in charge manager took our mind. I'll recommend everyone to be there for having a taste for a bit different from our daily life in a classy place with breathtaking surroundings. Will look forward to be there soon.

Souk is one of the only places in Kolkata serving authentic Lebanese food! 

Though the place is very highly priced, some of the dishes are totally worth it. My personal favourites being the Batata Harra with Asparagus, Khudra Bamia, Fattir and the greek salad. 

Would be great if they could introduce some chocolate based desserts or simply start serving Hub's Chocolate mud pie!

What stands out at Souk is the excellent table service. They are prompt, attentive and quite accommodating. Two negative points to make though: I cannot say this is very good Lebanese food; the quality of the buffet is not as good as a la carte (but isn't that the case everywhere?). Someone pointed out that they don't seem to have cous cous or a tajine dish. Yes that is quite odd. I think Lebanese cuisine is very close in palate to Indian cuisine so it would be great to see Souk take things to the next level.

We went for a Sunday family lunch as part of the Restaurant Week India offer. 3 people at the table meant 9 plates of food. For appetisers we chose chicken cooked in Moroccan spices, which was tasty though a tad chewy, batter fried fish pieces in harissa sauce which was soft and delicious and Kolokithi....fried zucchini chips served with dollops of Greek yoghurt. For mains we ordered Chicken Shawarma, a revelation compared to the street fare we're commonly used to...the flavours were singing thanks to a sprightly vinegary red-onion and red bell pepper salad in it. Chicken Stew with Lebanese spices came with parsley rice....this was the least impressive dish for me....tasted quite ordinary. A lamb stew with okra was also on the table served with rice...spicy intense and unique. 
Special applause for the desserts....the pistachio filled filo squares of baklava were spot on as was the Fez dish Chocolate B'stilla. The star of course was the intense yet enjoyable rose petal ice-cream....delightfully fragrant. All in all...a lovely experience rounded off with a chat with Chef Palash, himself.

Souk by Taj  is one of the  country’s known fine dine places for Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food and what they have is a well-crafted menu with the options from Moroccan, Greek, Turkish, Egyptian and Arabic cuisines. I have been there in Taj Bengal's Souk several times in past and is a fan of their Rose petal Ice Cream. This time I went there to sample the special menu crafted for the Gourmet Flavours fest by City bank  and tried  two starters: Dijaj Moroccan and  Hummus Beiruty; as main course there was Lahm Baima  Kotopoulo Stifado and the feast ended with Baklava and rose petal ice cream. Lahm Baima is a mutton stew with Okra and is worth trying for and so Dijaj Moroccan is a chicken starter. However, one thing one should not miss while having the food at souk is the Rose Petal Ice cream

Went for dinner at Souk on Saturday evening – urbane décor, cordial staff, comfy sitting arrangements …all good and expected, now let us talk about the food…

Appetizer 

Hummus Bil Lahm - Hummus, Crispy Lamb, Pine Nuts, Lemon, Parsley

Hummus was very fresh, that was the only plus point. They were not generous enough with the lamb and pine nuts, in order to make the lamb crispy, it became chewy… 

Dijaj Moroccan - Crispy Chicken Tossed in Moroccan Spices and Piri Piri Olives

This dish was a disappointment, either it was not made fresh or the crispiness it advocates is not what our palate understands; the chicken pieces were too small to actually discern whether there was any chicken at all, and it was damp… the flavour from Moroccan spices was authentic though 

Lahm Bil Roka - Lamb, Arugula, Onions, Tomatoes, and Toasted Pine Nuts with Molasses

Too acidic, need a microscope to find lamb juliennes. Pine nuts were toasted with perfection. The dressing was too strong and overpowering…

We ordered all non-veg appetizers, but sadly, at the end it is only the taste of hummus which lingered – 

Main Course 

Kotopoulo Stifado - Chicken Stewed with Roasted White Onions, Flavored with Cinnamon

It is supposed to be a classic Greek chicken stew done  with lots of onions and flavoured with cinnamon, cloves and bay leaves ( in a bouquet garni) and sometimes finished with local cheese..

However, this particular dish did not match the expectation, it was just OK

Lahm Baima - Lamb and Okra Stew Flavored with Loomi and Served with Parsley Rice

Best of the main courses, lamb was succulent and juicy, fresh tomatoes, subtle flavor from dried limes, which is characteristic of Moroccan cuisine. Goes well with pita bread and buttered rice…

Samak Salalaha - Char Grilled Fish Marinated in Piquant Sauce and Cooked on Skewers

This dish did not offer any surprises, fish was a wee bit overdone and thus became dry, and it was served with tomato-cucumber salad. .very ordinary

Dessert

Baklava - Traditional Lebanese Fillo and Mixed Nut Pastries

The crown jewel of desserts from Turkey classically is made using pistachios – here mixed nuts have been used, which actually did not result in any signature flavour…and once again it was too dry.. over fresh baklava drizzled with hot sugar syrup was the expectation…alas!

Omali - From Alexandrian Empire- Baked Fillo with Condensed Milk

Very close to our taste buds, this Egyptian dish was good – I have had Omali earlier which used to be full of different kind of nuts, which provides crunchiness and surprises, this one was almost devoid of any such things…

Rose Petal Ice Cream – excellent flavour, though a bit strong, may not be palatable for people who does not like rose flavor..

The dessert portions are pretty small, it appears Souk is definitely conscious about the wellbeing of the customers…ha ha!!

This is the middle eastern restaurant of Taj Bengal. The décor is good. The crockeries and draperies were in red and green giving it a very Arabian feel. Coming to the food it's difficult for me to name each dish because the names are unfamiliar too me. All the dishes were good but some of them stood out. Spinach hot salad was just melt in your mouth yummy. Haallomi and a dip with breads all good. Red lentil rice was also really well made. The rose petal ice cream is worth a try.
Overall an excellent experience.

Visited the place as part of Restaurant week and had a sumptuous lunch. It has always been a wish to go inside Taj Bengal and this was my opportunity. Once inside the mammoth reception place is awe inspiring. We went straight to the restaurant. Souk - is model Eastern themed and the waiters were dressed in the pathani suits. For a drink I took the Altima fav Long Island iced tea. Among the starters The lamb Dish was nice but the fish was a little heavier in salt. In the mains the bread in the shawarma was nice and the salmon was heavenly. In the desserts the kheer type one was lovely. Overall a good meal.

Went For Dinner on weekend :

Decor: I should say deco is above average nothing WOW about it (though the hotel lobby is a grand affair)

Service : Service was impeccable as you would expect 

Food : Was good & bad in parts and excellent in some.
Starters : Had Humus Lamb with Pita bread . It was good and the pita bread was probably the best i ever had .But the crispy chicken fry was dry and tasteless . On complaining it was changed with something which was too oily for my taste
Main Course : The khus khus lamb and grilled fish were good along with the egyptian flat bread .

Dessert - This was really the excellent part with the rose petal ice cream a sure winner . I liked Omali as well .

Went to Souk as part of Restaurant Week India where top restaurants across some major cities in India allow diners to sample some of their signature dishes from a set menu at significantly reduced prices (INR 900++ per head in Kolkata).

We were seated in a private room adjacent to the kitchen. I believe this room is generally offered to guests who opt for chef's special menu. I personally would have preferred a table in the main seating areas as I feel the atmosphere there is more interesting.

Now coming to the food, since we were three in number we were able to sample nine items from the menu, one each from the appetisers, mains and desserts for each one of us. From the appetisers section we went for the usual felafil, Hummus bil Lahm, which consisted of pieces of lamb in Hummus and Samak Moroccan, which is a fish preparation. The felafils were perfect, crispy on the outside with the right blend of spices. I liked the Samak Moroccan quite well also. But for me, the Mutton dish did not quite measure up to the other two, the mutton pieces being a bit too chewy and also quite small, so that one could not properly appreciate the flavours. The real stand-out item of this section was in fact the pita breads offered as sides. I was simply blown off by them. Surely the best pita breads that I ever had.

In the mains section, the star was the Lahm Tagine, which consisted of melt in your mouth lamb pieces and cous cous in a tomato based gravy. The chicken shavarma was very different and much better from those available from many road side Lebanese joints, the main differentiator again being that awesome bread wrapping the chicken. The grilled fish, Samak Makhli, though good, did not quite measure upto the other two dishes.

In the dessert section, the Baklava, Omali and the Rose Petal ice cream were each very good in their own ways with the real stand-out being the ice cream, which, I was told, was made in house with actual rose petals. It provided the perfect finish to our meal.

The portions were adequate and they never overdid the spices and oils at any stage which kept the dishes light. The service was warm and friendly throughout. Overall a very good experience

This restaurant is another one about which I totally forgot and when I came across the pictures on my phone that is when it striked me that I should complete the pending review. I uploaded all the pics a few days back before writing the review. We visited this place in a group of 5 for a Sunday lunch. The interior is very classily decorated and thus very chic, what attracted me the most was the green coloured glasses, the marble tables, chandeliers and the brown and green chairs.  The whole get up was very attractive along with the open kitchen. The staffs were excellent in their behavior as they were not only professional but very friendly and polite. We were throwing a bit of a tantrum as we were confused regarding which table to choose but they were very polite and gave us ample time to decide. Even when we were busy clicking pictures of every little thing they were guiding us as in from which angle the pictures would come better. Coming to the food we ordered chicken, fish, lahm starters though I don't remember the exact name but I do remember the tastes which were delicious but the best was the kibbeh as they were perfectly shaped along with perfect flavours. In the main course the chicken and lamb dishes were accompanied by parsley rice which complimented each other perfectly. The samak moroccaine was baked beckti fillet and very unique. The chicken shawarma was very different from the others that I had and that is when I understood that authentic shawarma is very different from the ones we have in regular joints.  The bread outside was a bit crispy and very thin filled with chicken and other condiments. 

The dessert just won my heart as I got the chance of having such authentic lebanese dishes which I did not have before. The baklava was delicious which was actually mixed nut pastries then cam the omali which is a preparation made with condensed milk which I could not stop eating. The best was the last dish that is the rose petal ice cream and how I wish I could have this ice cream everyday as it was so flavourful and at the same time I got a sense of serenity once I took a spoonful of it. A must try!!! The presentation of the dishes were top notch along with everything. I was so happy with my meal that I would suggest everyone who wishes to try authentic lebanese food to try this place out as they would definitely return happy after their meal.

Syrian chef has major attachment with his recipes... Asked him to modify it got him really offended... Wanted chicken shawarma the authentic way chef insisted on indianising the recipe! After about 15 mins of talking we received our shawarma after another 30mins. Had to ask for finger snack with the wine I ordered... Service was very bad but the shawarma was ok not 100% to what wanted but 65%.

The closest you'll get to good Lebanese cuisine in the city. The humus and all the cold mezze preparations are fantastic. The lamb chops work well as a main course. The b'stilla au lait is a wonderful dessert. 
Another standout is the souk pilaf - a wonderful mix of pomegranate seeds, pistachio and raisins. Easily one of the best rice dishes I've sampled in the city, which is a big compliment in Kolkata.
Five star hotel prices - so easily 1600 per head, but totally worth it if you're looking for something delicious and exotic/different  (still a familiar flavour profile).

Starters : Had Humus Lamb with Pita bread . It was good and the pita bread was probably the best i ever had .But the crispy chicken fry was dry and tasteless . On complaining it was changed with something which was too oily for my taste
Main Course : The khus khus lamb and grilled fish were good along with the egyptian flat bread .

Dessert - This was really the excellent part with the rose petal ice cream a sure winner . I liked Omali as well .

Went to Souk as part of Restaurant Week India where top restaurants across some major cities in India allow diners to sample some of their signature dishes from a set menu at significantly reduced prices (INR 900++ per head in Kolkata).

We were seated in a private room adjacent to the kitchen. I believe this room is generally offered to guests who opt for chef's special menu. I personally would have preferred a table in the main seating areas as I feel the atmosphere there is more interesting.

Now coming to the food, since we were three in number we were able to sample nine items from the menu, one each from the appetisers, mains and desserts for each one of us. From the appetisers section we went for the usual felafil, Hummus bil Lahm, which consisted of pieces of lamb in Hummus and Samak Moroccan, which is a fish preparation. The felafils were perfect, crispy on the outside with the right blend of spices. I liked the Samak Moroccan quite well also. But for me, the Mutton dish did not quite measure up to the other two, the mutton pieces being a bit too chewy and also quite small, so that one could not properly appreciate the flavours. The real stand-out item of this section was in fact the pita breads offered as sides. I was simply blown off by them. Surely the best pita breads that I ever had.

In the mains section, the star was the Lahm Tagine, which consisted of melt in your mouth lamb pieces and cous cous in a tomato based gravy. The chicken shavarma was very different and much better from those available from many road side Lebanese joints, the main differentiator again being that awesome bread wrapping the chicken. The grilled fish, Samak Makhli, though good, did not quite measure upto the other two dishes.

In the dessert section, the Baklava, Omali and the Rose Petal ice cream were each very good in their own ways with the real stand-out being the ice cream, which, I was told, was made in house with actual rose petals. It provided the perfect finish to our meal.

The portions were adequate and they never overdid the spices and oils at any stage which kept the dishes light. The service was warm and friendly throughout. Overall a very good experience

This restaurant is another one about which I totally forgot and when I came across the pictures on my phone that is when it striked me that I should complete the pending review. I uploaded all the pics a few days back before writing the review. We visited this place in a group of 5 for a Sunday lunch. The interior is very classily decorated and thus very chic, what attracted me the most was the green coloured glasses, the marble tables, chandeliers and the brown and green chairs.  The whole get up was very attractive along with the open kitchen. The staffs were excellent in their behavior as they were not only professional but very friendly and polite. We were throwing a bit of a tantrum as we were confused regarding which table to choose but they were very polite and gave us ample time to decide. Even when we were busy clicking pictures of every little thing they were guiding us as in from which angle the pictures would come better. Coming to the food we ordered chicken, fish, lahm starters though I don't remember the exact name but I do remember the tastes which were delicious but the best was the kibbeh as they were perfectly shaped along with perfect flavours. In the main course the chicken and lamb dishes were accompanied by parsley rice which complimented each other perfectly. The samak moroccaine was baked beckti fillet and very unique. The chicken shawarma was very different from the others that I had and that is when I understood that authentic shawarma is very different from the ones we have in regular joints.  The bread outside was a bit crispy and very thin filled with chicken and other condiments. 

The dessert just won my heart as I got the chance of having such authentic lebanese dishes which I did not have before. The baklava was delicious which was actually mixed nut pastries then cam the omali which is a preparation made with condensed milk which I could not stop eating. The best was the last dish that is the rose petal ice cream and how I wish I could have this ice cream everyday as it was so flavourful and at the same time I got a sense of serenity once I took a spoonful of it. A must try!!! The presentation of the dishes were top notch along with everything. I was so happy with my meal that I would suggest everyone who wishes to try authentic lebanese food to try this place out as they would definitely return happy after their meal.

Syrian chef has major attachment with his recipes... Asked him to modify it got him really offended... Wanted chicken shawarma the authentic way chef insisted on indianising the recipe! After about 15 mins of talking we received our shawarma after another 30mins. Had to ask for finger snack with the wine I ordered... Service was very bad but the shawarma was ok not 100% to what wanted but 65%.

The closest you'll get to good Lebanese cuisine in the city. The humus and all the cold mezze preparations are fantastic. The lamb chops work well as a main course. The b'stilla au lait is a wonderful dessert. 
Another standout is the souk pilaf - a wonderful mix of pomegranate seeds, pistachio and raisins. Easily one of the best rice dishes I've sampled in the city, which is a big compliment in Kolkata.
Five star hotel prices - so easily 1600 per head, but totally worth it if you're looking for something delicious and exotic/different  (still a familiar flavour profile).

I love this place and it had the best Mediterranean food in all of Calcutta. I love a lot of things here and a few suggestions are the de constructed falafel wrap instead of the wrap itself. Potato artichoke is amazing. I also love the rubian prawn and yogurt chicken kebab. Also the lamb and okara curry is very good. Few suggestions go for the chilly pitta instead of the plain pitta and must try the tumb (Garlic sauce). Also the 3 desserts I tried were all amazing bakhlawa, rose petal icecream and the must try desert B'stilla Au Lait. The Sunday brunch is also a very option with most of the good stuff on buffet and vodka n beer on the house :)

Does Taj pay to keep their ratings high? I ask because I believe Souk should shut operations in Kolkata. What place calls themselves "Middle Eastern" when the servers haven't even heard of Lavash? And which Middle Eastern place serves Indian food like Daal Palak, Paneer Methi Malai, etc.? It's a disgrace to have been here.

I went on a day when they only had the option of a buffet. And I was shocked to see an Indian fare (and even strawberry milkshake!). And most of the items sucked. From a bland set of cold mezzes to a relatively hard Baklava to even an overspiced (with cardamom) curry, everything was a disaster.

While I definitely don't recommend this place to anybody, I also urge Souk to shut operations in Kolkata.

There are good restaurants and then there are some great ones. Souk is definitely great. Right from the moment you walk into this place it has a special warmth. The staff and manager are excellent. 

It was my first visit to this place and i was blown away with the food quality. We had:

1. Hummus & Pita
2. Rubbian Hara - Prawn starter (Absolutely lip smacking dish)
3. Lamb Tagine - Spice lamb curry with Cous Cous.
4. B'stilla au lait - Dessert. Well this is the most amazing dessert i have had till date in Kolkata. 

The music played is soothing and goes perfect with the ambiance. If you are in Kolkata this place needs to be there on you list.

If you want Lebanese / Mediterranean cuisine at Calcutta, this is the place to be. Even the humble Swarma tastes awesome. In the dessert section Baklava and Choclate B'stilla is just too good. Don't miss the dips Tzatziki, Mugammara, Babaganouj and Hummus.

The meat balls with the perfect spices, the humble shawarma in a strangely refined avatar and the slow cooked lamb gravies with oodles of flavour marked the main course. But the ending was no less pleasing. The baklava was sticky yet flaky with bites of pistachios peeking from under the layers. But my favourite was the rose ice cream which came as a surprise I would say. I am not a fan of the rose fragrance but this ice cream blew me off my feet. A fantastic experience this meal was, truly!

Well, here it goes - Souk! It was August 2014...my wife and I decided to celebrate our 1/2 wedding anniversary - 6 months that is.
We were going through a list of exotic restaurants and this one caught our fancy. Once there it came across as a nice place - typical Taj style. We did not go for the buffet or the Menu card. We went in and wanted anything that the chef recommended. Well the chef did not dissapoint us. Not at all. We ended up having Hot Mezzes, Chargrilled Lamb Chops, Tavuk Bitlis with Hung yogurt and B'Stilla Au lait for dessert. We also downed some Jameson.
That dinner made me understand what a certain food critic in one of my favourite animated movies meant when he said "Ask the chef to serve me some perspective".
Kudos Souk - hats off!

dessert items wr not so good eithr....

Food and drinks are fine as per the standard of 5 star hotels but I can't imagine why The Taj Bengal does not have a spray to wash private parts in their washrooms? Thankfully a attendant named sikandar was there who understands the need. All the Muslim guests and customers need to wash their private part after even urinating or else we can't offer prayers. Please see to it.

Staff was very courteous, food was great( even if the Kotopundo Stifando was underwhelming- my grandma said that it looked and tasted like pati mangshor jhol! OMG). For me, however, the best thing we ordered was the Kibbeh- they were simply divine!! Just one thing- please PLEASE update your menu on Zomato- the menu still there is from a few YEARS ago!

Staff was attentive but not too intrusive. Some great variety of Middle Eastern food was on menu. Staff was ready to explain each menu in details but with subtle hint of recommendations . 
A bit expensive but it is worth it . If you are a goody - this place must be in your bucket list .

This place can be brilliant, if you order properly *which we did not* and I hope this review helps you do just that!
We visited this place as a part of restaurant week, and we were given a selection of dishes from which we ordered two starters, two main courses and two desserts. This is what we ordered:
1. Kibbeh: the best savoury dish of the evening. It tastes of meat, only meat and nothing but meat. Basically it's a ball of deep fried wheat stuffed with mutton mince. Simple and bold flavours, low on spices and high on MEAT. There were four pieces in a plate.
2. Batter fried fish: my companion liked this a lot, as I'm sure many others will. Very familiar flavours, nice and tangy. Small balls of fish, deep fried with a batter. The quality of the fish is top - notch. While the dish won't blow your mind, it won't leave u dissatisfied either.
3. Chicken stew with rice: tastes like Sunday.Bengali chicken gravy. Rice was nice, flavoured with herbs. Don't go for it.
4. Grilled fish: okay dish. Two pieced in a plate.Overcooked. Again,  fish was top - notch but they ruined the taste by the cooking. There was a lovely crust on it (which is no excuse for the fibrous flesh). Don't go for it 
5. Rose petal ice cream: two scoops in a plate. I absolutely loved it. My companion who doesn't like ice cream enjoyed it as well. It wasn't terribly cold, and the flavour was quite refreshing to our exhausted palettes! 
6. Baklava: my favourite dish of the evening. It'll remind you of a very intensely flavoured barfi. Spiced and caramelised dry fruits, stuffed inside layers of soft, crunchy pastry. Absolutely delicious, especially with the ice cream. Four pieces in a plate.

Ambience -- not one of my faves. It's posh, but not cozy. If you are going there for a date, then you're going to impress and not to be cosy or romantic. It is more suited to formal meals, or family occasions than dates, or friends hanging out. 

All in all, a good meal (certainty value for money; 2160 including taxes because of restaurant week). I'd probably return to celebrate some important occasion, but not particularly to excite my taste buds.

Love love love the food, and definitely don't end up going as often as I would wish to. The menu is extensive and I've liked almost everything we have ever ordered. My favourites include truffle hummus, grilled chicken marinated in garlic  (sheesh taok?)  and rose petal icecream. The service and is obviously great, but it is the food that I would keep going back for - Highly recommend.

Went to Souk, the Mediterranean restaurant of Taj Bengal on Saturday afternoon.
Three of us had a booking at 1 PM. We reached exactly at 1 and surprised to see that there were no other guests in the restaurant. 
We were greeted at the entrance and were escorted to our table. There was a very cozy sofa with cushions on one side of the table and chairs on the other. The table had long stemmed glasses for water,  cutlery and decorative items.The decor was contemporary and the ambiance was cozy with light middle Eastern music playing in the background. Lighting inside the restaurant was mostly artificial unlike The Hub where you get a lot of natural light coming in from the Taj's  poolside. The kitchen was open and extremely clean. Chefs were cordial and smiling.

We decided to go for the "Set Meal" of one starter and one main dish followed by one dessert for each person. So we got to taste 9 different dishes.

Starters
------------
Crispy Samak (Crispy fish dusted with roasted cumin) - The fish (Kolkata Vetki) was fresh and the dish was quite good.
Dijaj Moroccan (Crispy fried chicken) - Taste was quite similar to Crispy Samak. The fish was more softer though.
Hummus bil Lahm (Spiced minced lamb and pine nuts on hummus) - Hummus was awesome and possibly freshly prepared. Lamb was tasty but the amount (of lamb) was awfully less.

Three complimentary Pita breads were served with the starters. One was a plain Pita and the other two were sprinkled with two different types of spices.

Main Course
------------------
Samak Salalaha (Oven baked fillet of fish marinated with Moroccan spices) - Loved this most. Simply awesome!
Chicken Shavarma Wrap - A very common dish in any middle Eastern restaurant. Taste was average.
Lahm  Bamia (Egyptian lamb and Okra stew served with Parsley rice) - Parsley rice was long grain aromatic with mild touch of chopped parsley. The stew, however, had too much tomatoes and  possibly a bit over cooked which made the Okra soft and spoiled its crispness.

Desserts
-------------
Baklava - Most common dessert in any Middle Eastern restaurant. Taste was good but nothing exceptional.
Omali (Baked fillo with condensed milk) - Not bad if you like the taste of condensed milk. Came piping hot in a small bowl.
Rose petal ice cream - Two scoops of Rose flavored ice cream on crispy biscuits. Reminded me of Ralli's Rose Syrup. Best of the lot! This is a MUST try item for all. I would, probably, go back to Souk just for this!

Most of the dishes were good for 2 persons. The service was very prompt. The glasses were filled with water as soon as those were near empty. Stuffs were attentive and cordial. The manager came to visit the table once for feedback.

If you are just looking for a tasty Swarma wrap or Hummus and Pita and do not want to spend around Rs. 2000 for each person then look somewhere else. However, visit Souk if you like authentic Mediterranean food and want a five star royal treatment. You would experience the majestic grandeur of the Taj Bengal. 

Food Taste - 3.5/5
Service - 4.5/5
Price/Value for Money - 3.5/5
Ambiance & Décor - 4.5/5

OVERALL - 4/5

It was my friend's 25th grand birthday treat at souk ,as  we planned to try out Mediterranean cuisine which was something new to us. We decided to go for the non veg SET MEAL known as TABLE D' HOTE priced somewher around 1750 plus taxes , with an extra order of LAMB TAGINE in maincourse and CHOCO B'STILLE in desserts.

the interiors had that royal touch as one expects from taj properties, the best were the chandeliers hanging, so unique i must say , the mushy low couches, open kitchen , and we spent great time in clicking pictures in and around the lobby during the serving time.

the cold mezzes were served first , following the starters RUBIAN PRAWNS and KIBBE  , most of us liked the prawns more , but i loved the kibbe too , unique chops ! the mains we had kebabs of fish and chicken with butter rice and pita breads, but the dish which stood out was the lamb tagine.. go for it!!

the desserts were the best of the lot ... BAKLAVA , ROSE PETAL ICE CREAM  were brilliant.. and yes chocolate lovers , do dig in the CHOCO B'STILLE ,

They also gifted us a birthday cake which was amazing as well.

So my suggestion would be to explore the ala carte menu rather than the set one .

Try the Sunday Brunch here.  You will get to have most of their dishes. Although they may serve you only vodka and beer in the name of Alcohol but its totally worth it. Food is excellent and obviously it is Taj Bengal so needless to talk about ambience.  A Sunday brunch will be a great way to get yourself introduced to the Mediterranean dishes of this restaurant. Must Try.

Dining at the Taj is always a gratifying and riveting experience. You are completely blown away by the statuesque interiors. The Souk is their flagship European and Mediterranean restaurant.

Souk has the trademark Taj hospitality and warmth, unrivaled quality and elegantly done decor. The service was spectacular throughout our dinner. They assisted us with our selection of food and were always quick to make sure we didn't starve.

With a lot of varieties in their glittery menu, I had a hard time to choose the delicacies.

We started off with Felafel…chickpea with cumin, coriander, onion and garlic…super combination but ends up on a salty side. Domates Corbasi soup was great with a European twist. Moving on we ordered Artichawki Batata Meshwi…which is grilled potatoes stuffed with tomatoes, artichokes, onions and sweet chillies. The gravy inside also provides a tantalizing taste of spices.

Ending the dining experience, we ordered Baklava and Rose Petal Ice Cream, the latter of which is a real delight to have. Also ordered a Cosmopolitan…really well prepared.

Being a five star, it is slightly heavy on the pocket, but undoubtedly a worthwhile experience. The ambience is ideal for a romantic, candle lit dinner. Service just when you need it, the waiter lingers only just and allows you to enjoy your food and your space.

This particular restaurant located in the Taj Bengal has its emphasis on Mediterranean and Middle eastern cuisine.
Ambience of this establishment is quite modern looking with a large wine collection.
Like always we had the fatoush which is a salad. Light and refreshing it was a memorable salad. The mezzes were very tasty and the prawns something out of this world. 
All in all I had a very nice experience and I recommend the place if you are looking for something to beat the heat.

All the five start hotels in Kolkata have very old in house restaurants.Baan Thai in Oberoi grand in 1996,the ITC sonar places like dum pukht,pan Asian etc as well as The Chinoissorie,The Hub,Sonargaon at the Taj Bengal.
Souk by those standards is the new kid in the block and maybe a couple of years in its existence and the first serious player amongst a sea of wannabes.
Middle Eastern cuisine suits the spice and tangy craving Calcuttan palette and the multiple and plenty vegetarian options appeals to the Alipore swish set in the city.
Neutral no nonsense decor,a all white concise menu and a very attentive staff add to the appeal.
We being a family of four started with the regulation Hummus Bi lahm,Tabbouleh and crispy Rubian Prawns.All of them were excellent especially the hummus and the prawns which were cooked to perfection smeared in a spicy red sauce.
We followed it up with artichawks meshw and then moved to the Kabab platter of chicken,mutton,fish and prawns served with fragrant rice.Here The score was much lower.The chicken was good,the prawn excellent,the mutton moderate and the fish not up to the mark.and somehow the dishes tasted like Indian tandoori items and the Middle Eastern flavour was lost.
Ended the session with Baklava and orange pistachio ice cream.Baklava was a revealation and really good.Now this was a mixed bag for sure.But overall Souk scored high on my books and I just wish them to be a little more careful with consistency.But as the youngest member of the tribe of five star hotel eateries I am willing to give them the benefit of doubt.

I have been here many a times - well, the only decent Mediterranean range available in Calcutta is to be found here. While they have a buffet, I have always preferred to go for their alacarte. Maybe because I just love their Tagine. Very nice indeed. Too bad that they don't have any good quality shorba - a major disappointment. The kebabs and the sheesh took are also delicious. The B Stilla (Morroccan) is kind of average.Don't leave though without having their Rose Petal Ice Cream. Brilliant stuff.

Food was not bad. However, the quantity was not much, and somehow, we didn't feel very satisfied with the meal. Ambiance was good, as is expected from Taj. Quality and quantity of food should be looked into.

Sometimes it is unfair for restaurants in leading hotels. They can't do enough. being excellent is just expected of them as the value consciousness is in dna of Indians 

So, how does Souk rate? Well it scores high. One of my favourite restaurants in any city. If Souk was a cricketer...It would be the classy Zaheer Abbas. Elegant, stylish, every shot in the book played with immense grace and smile.

Once you get in the restaurant....you want to spend more and more time. Just like once Zaheer Abbas got it, he wouldn't leave. The staff led by (aptly named) Nizam have ensured the pitch is laid out for the regal experience....just like watching Zaheer Abbas bat. 

Zaheer also acquired a name "Ab Bas" (enough please). Such is the hospitality, I had to say the same "Ab bas". 4 stars for the classy experience...and...

You know the staff knows about food when  not only do they know detail of their own menu, but also take you through menu of traditional restaurants in the region. Extra 1/2 star just for that.

Great ambience, great food, light eating easy on the stomach food... 

The various hummus and baba gannoush along with the flavoured pita breads go very well with the spinach and fried onion preperation 

The "pizza" is a must try along with the mushroom bastilla  

One could also try the stew with the rice

For deserts the chocolate bastilla is just out of the world 
The fried pastry with sandwiched cream topped off with a saffron milk concoction is extremely nice as well

The SOUK, where you will get Moroccan and Greek delicacies at the TAJ BENGAL. The interior decoration is awesome. The sitting arrangement is superb. The kitchen is open where you can see chefs cooking. I visited with my siblings where we ordered white wine, scotch, and beer among the liquor. We ordered two starters and for main course we ordered five dishes among which I remember these names.. Kataupolo stifado with buttered parsley rice, seesh tamakh, massaka and the rest two were a fish and lamb dishes and trust me all the dishes were delicious and yummy. Its expensive though but if you want to have in a grand way then you may give it a try!

Once you enter this place the the Mediterranean music hums in your ears. Apart from that the ambiance is nothing like Lebanon or Mediterranean region. The Muhammara is a must try for everyone  so are most of the starters.... but the quantity is saddeningly less.
 The deserts... specially Baklava and the Rose Ice cream are amazingly delicious. The main course is also not over the mark. The service is also conspicuously slow
( then again i visited on 25th of december).

The bar is well stocked but the Cosmopolitan that i ordered was not very satisfactory.
 In short it is a bit over priced....

Had a great dinner at this place. The spinach and cheese salad is a great choice of salad! The lamb with humus was succulent and juicy, and was ordered a lot of times :) we also had a Mediterranean dip platter with prawn tagine and fresh pita breads rolled out moments before serving. 

To end the dinner we had generous helpings of home made rose ice cream with real rose petals crushed around it. Great aroma and flavors. 

A must repeat for the lamb and ice cream and salad

Went out for Sunday Brunch in Souk. Good food, good ambiance and the hospitality are key attractions. Choice of mocktails are quite excellent. Love the gorgeous hummus and kibbeh they serve along with sawarma and excellent choice of food in the buffet. And to end with mouth watering choice of deserts including not too sweet baklava. An overall heart filling experience.

For some reason this place has become a late night out for me and my parents. Perfect middle eastern and Mediterranean dishes with a hint of their own style so as to incorporate the taste bud of India. Lovely place in all. Very good , cosy ambiance. Few things to try would be the hummus, the meshwi kebab. Go mostly fir their gosht varieties because they make so juicy and tender that its melts like butter. And the flavors that they include send your mouth to overdrive
Absolutely fantastic. Pic a bottle of a good wine to complement your dinner or ask their waiters to pick one for you. They do have a very good selecton of wines if I do say so myself. Been here a couple of times. Always have a good evening

Was there last week with my wife. Ambience was good and service was good too. We had the Sunday Brunch. Though my wife completely loved it, I wasnt as impressed. The salads were good and you had a good spread of chicken, sea food, lamb etc. They also served shawarma which is a speciality of the region. It was middle eastern/central asian cuisine. For me, who likes subtle tastes, i found the food to be strong on the pallette. So nothing to do with the food, quality or the restaurant, it was more of a personal preference. The deserts were good, That part i loved. Had 4-5types of deserts of which one was a crispy roll, with filling and one with a mango mousse which too was good

The Souk – Marvels of the Mediterranean

Normally I try to avoid late night dinners in specialty restaurants. There are untold reasons for that. But this time, I was so much impressed by the promises of the Souk Chef Palash and Shantanu who gave us a memorable meal  without notice the previous night that they would arrange a perfume banquet for us, that we went to Souk on 28th July 2014 for a sneak preview of their perfume menu. Let me tell you my top three feelings as I entered the Souk that night — zeal, anticipation and pleasure. And let me also give you a sneak preview at the outset that my anticipation and expectation were more than met.

Let me start with the decor. Conceived by a Malaysian interior designer, the restaurant looks marvelous. It is chic, elegant, understated and very ‘today’. From the door to the walls to the chairs and what they call a deck… each part of Souk spells elegance, class and contemporary. I like the way they have played up natural elements, the way it is done. It’s plush without even once coming across as flashy. When you enter, you get the feeling that you have entered a place that is extraordinary. The experience is made more special because of the warm smile you are greeted with. That Calcuttans have been jet-setting more in recent times than ever before is old hat. But now the mountain too has begun to come to Mohammed. Super markets across the city have begun to stock the choicest of imported gourmet food and ingredients. So sayonara, substitutes. People not only know what they are eating and what goes into it, they actually see all these ingredients stocked up in a rack next to their organic honey and whole wheat breads.

Souk has three areas — a general area, a special chef’s studio for eight (it has no fixed menu, you can determine it a day before and can also see the master chef at work) and Casablanca at the mezzanine level (it has seating for 10-12 people and offers four-five courses). It’s nice that Souk is targeting niche sections because in Calcutta there aren’t many restaurants that do so.

You remember when you were on that exotic Moroccan vacation and placed an order in that fancy restaurant with an ‘Erm… I’d like that item number 6 on the menu, please’? And then prayed to the god of good times that the impossible-to-pronounce ‘authentic’ dish you ordered would at least be edible? Of course it makes you laugh now — because these days you can say b’stilla au lait faster than this creamy Moroccan dessert melts in your mouth. Read on and you will believe what I got to say. Before that on to the food.  The first item was a soup or appetizer as you take it. They called it Amuse Bouche. A sweet flavored creamy little thing.  A stylish and very tasty appetizer... it doesn't get better than this! Its success lies in its top quality ingredients – ask for the names and Palash will flash a grin. You leave your email id and I will mail it, but he will never do. All trade secrets. So I had to write this up without any input except the lingering taste buds. So the Amuse Bouche had a Greek yoghurt flavor with the scent of a rose.  A perfect appetizer. It tasted heavenly and the craving for a second serving was so much to resist.  A soup that can be made with minimum fuss yet delivers big flavor since it had some labneh.  From the moment it touched my mouth, my taste-buds started singing. The saltiness of the Feta combined with the sweetness of the fruits transported us to Middle-Eastern heaven for a while. 

For the Hors d'oeuvre, we were served with Scallop Meshvi Seared Sea Scallops with Citrus (?) Tabbouleh. “This recipe is perfect for this time of year,” says Palash the Chef. “It’s nice and light and citrusy.” It had the flavor of a little extra virgin olive oil. A skewer fashioned out of lemongrass or a sugar cane kept the scallops together – all probably, since the chef wouldn’t explain. For the tabbouleh, Palash had added a bit of crumbled feta cheese on top “for a little color and pizzaz.” The effect was spectacular. The second serving was out of question. You have to believe they had taken hours to concoct it and though I was going to hate myself the following morning, I could not help gobbling it up in one scoop. 

And now, sink your teeth into some succulence. For the starters we had the Turkish Samak Maquali – a Lebanese fish preparation. I had heard that Lebanese and Middle Eastern food is wholesome and good for health. Made with lots of fresh vegetables and whole grains, you can taste the earth's goodness in every bite. As the Lebanese people immigrated over the centuries, they brought these tasty recipes to east and west, to Europe, Latin America, the United States, and to various parts of the world. And now to India through the Souk, which solidified in the hands of Palash.  I will never know whether the item was a fish or a meat. The only thing I could tell is that it definitely had the Mediterranean flavor. Pan-fried and served piping hot with mayonnaise, taratour bi taheeni or whatever it was. The effect was delightful and idyllic. As if transported to a tranquil Lebanese household served with love by the housewife. 

It was followed by some Juicy butterflied prawns sizzled with Mediterranean flavours - perfect for a tapas spread, Sprinkled with lemon zest and parsley and served as a Hors d'oeuvre though it goes as main course also with pita or bread. I washed it down with some expensive French Wine. It  was a delicacy to die for. All the ingredients that come from Egypt) are flown in — they are not compromising on anything. The quality of the food was really good and authentic and it was the same as eating in a Mediterranean eatery.

Then we went on to desserts, though the mind warned enough. First we had a dessert sampler. The Baklava was good but the best was the rose petal ice cream served French-style on a sugar sponge that looked like a bird’s nest on which nested a dollop of ice cream. We finished the meal with Moroccan mint tea that had a strong aroma and flavor followed by a platter of dates. They served us what they called Chilly Oil Sandalwood smoked chicken, Tandoori chunks of chicken breast in a marinade of spices and sandalwood, whose real flavor was just incredible. For authenticity Palash produced a puch of sandalwood powder whose flavor was exhilarating. For a second I doubted how they could blend the Sandalwood the non-edible with that delicacy. The proof as they say was in the eating. No question about its authenticity. The sandalwood chicken had the toppings of Israeli Cucumber ricotta, an authentic Israeli salad and the effect was amazing. 

Sips and nibbles done, let’s get down to the big bite. The main course was a forbidden dish – Chilean sea bass? (Which is actually not a sea bass, nor necessarily from Chile!) It’s a name to make you think a toothfish is something yummy. And boy, did we eat that up. The mind clamored and rose so high that it started to look like Pirates of the Caribbean out there.  I have read the environmentalists crying foul over the endangered species. That was for later. Over there in the Souk Ignoring the controversy, I am a big fan of Chilean sea bass. I was amazed at how such an ugly fish can taste so good. Rich with the typical Sicilian blend of pine nuts and raisins, it is flavorful with onions and garlic and gutsy with ripe tomatoes. This braised sea bass in fennel broth is one of the best recipes I have ever tasted. The sea bass combined with the incredible spices, topped with loomi oil worked out better than I had hoped. And my wife loved it.

For the desert, Plash served us B'stilla au lait - Sheer poetry of flavors. You feel like doing a li'l jig once your eyes fall on this beauty.  ! To wind up we also had Orange Blossom pistachioed Icecream with a savoury crunch to this ambrosial honey-and orange-scented ice cream. Really a splash of orange liqueur that softened the texture to create a creamy consistency for easy scooping from the plate. 

My thoughts after the meal were dominated by the fact that I want to repeat the food. I would like to eat here again and again. We had a good time and re-examined the menu, I can say that I have many reasons to go back — including repeating what I have already tried. For my wife, the décor, the ambience, the wine – which she religiously avoided – the heavenly taste that lingered in our mouth and mind – all reminded of an untimely late honeymoon. Souk is the Soul of the Taj Bengal. Though it would be a pain later on while punching the credit card. But all good things come with a heavy price. Especially the sins of Mediterranean Marvels.

The only thing I could tell is that it definitely had the Mediterranean flavor. Pan-fried and served piping hot with mayonnaise, taratour bi taheeni or whatever it was. The effect was delightful and idyllic. As if transported to a tranquil Lebanese household served with love by the housewife. 

It was followed by some Juicy butterflied prawns sizzled with Mediterranean flavours - perfect for a tapas spread, Sprinkled with lemon zest and parsley and served as a Hors d'oeuvre though it goes as main course also with pita or bread. I washed it down with some expensive French Wine. It  was a delicacy to die for. All the ingredients that come from Egypt) are flown in — they are not compromising on anything. The quality of the food was really good and authentic and it was the same as eating in a Mediterranean eatery.

Then we went on to desserts, though the mind warned enough. First we had a dessert sampler. The Baklava was good but the best was the rose petal ice cream served French-style on a sugar sponge that looked like a bird’s nest on which nested a dollop of ice cream. We finished the meal with Moroccan mint tea that had a strong aroma and flavor followed by a platter of dates. They served us what they called Chilly Oil Sandalwood smoked chicken, Tandoori chunks of chicken breast in a marinade of spices and sandalwood, whose real flavor was just incredible. For authenticity Palash produced a puch of sandalwood powder whose flavor was exhilarating. For a second I doubted how they could blend the Sandalwood the non-edible with that delicacy. The proof as they say was in the eating. No question about its authenticity. The sandalwood chicken had the toppings of Israeli Cucumber ricotta, an authentic Israeli salad and the effect was amazing. 

Sips and nibbles done, let’s get down to the big bite. The main course was a forbidden dish – Chilean sea bass? (Which is actually not a sea bass, nor necessarily from Chile!) It’s a name to make you think a toothfish is something yummy. And boy, did we eat that up. The mind clamored and rose so high that it started to look like Pirates of the Caribbean out there.  I have read the environmentalists crying foul over the endangered species. That was for later. Over there in the Souk Ignoring the controversy, I am a big fan of Chilean sea bass. I was amazed at how such an ugly fish can taste so good. Rich with the typical Sicilian blend of pine nuts and raisins, it is flavorful with onions and garlic and gutsy with ripe tomatoes. This braised sea bass in fennel broth is one of the best recipes I have ever tasted. The sea bass combined with the incredible spices, topped with loomi oil worked out better than I had hoped. And my wife loved it.

For the desert, Plash served us B'stilla au lait - Sheer poetry of flavors. You feel like doing a li'l jig once your eyes fall on this beauty.  ! To wind up we also had Orange Blossom pistachioed Icecream with a savoury crunch to this ambrosial honey-and orange-scented ice cream. Really a splash of orange liqueur that softened the texture to create a creamy consistency for easy scooping from the plate. 

My thoughts after the meal were dominated by the fact that I want to repeat the food. I would like to eat here again and again. We had a good time and re-examined the menu, I can say that I have many reasons to go back — including repeating what I have already tried. For my wife, the décor, the ambience, the wine – which she religiously avoided – the heavenly taste that lingered in our mouth and mind – all reminded of an untimely late honeymoon. Souk is the Soul of the Taj Bengal. Though it would be a pain later on while punching the credit card. But all good things come with a heavy price. Especially the sins of Mediterranean Marvels.

Love The Souk - especially the care they take in presenting each dish, and sourcing quality ingredients to create a lovely spread. To be honest, the lamb tagine is one of the best I have had till date. I love the gorgeous hummus and kibbeh they serve here but their tabouleh salad, moussaka, and the not too sweet baklava, with a truly nutty aftertaste is what I return to.

My first taste of food at Taj Bengal was at Souk..Must say a very different experience.True to its name it does bring out a flavor of the Mediterranean..We had gone for the Sunday buffet which had a great variety of cold salads, kebabs and equally interesting dessert items.Really loved the minced lamb and egg salad, garlic shrimp and the kibbe...The setting is beautiful and the staff very attentive.Although its a little heavy on the pocket (comes to around 2000+ per person including the taxes), its an absolute must try.Would love to go for a second visit.

Good things happen once a while and it takes time to soa(u)k in before one can pen down about it. :) 

About two weeks back, we visited Souk for its Sunday Brunch and boy, we were in for a treat!! Priced at 2050 INR, inclusive of taxes, the brunch comprised Metaxa (Greek liquor), different cocktails and beer. 
Food was divided into four sections - cold salad, live pita and shawarma, a wide range of entree and desserts. The cold salad section had a variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian items, my favourites being the garlic shrimp with olives and minced lamb salad. These tasted refreshing and impeccable with the fresh bread sticks offered at the table. The hummus was quite interesting too but did not come anything close to the shrimp salad offered on the buffet. Thereafter came the freshly made, hot shawarma that killed every other shawarma available in the city for us. The pita was soft and really well made, very different from the usual kinds we get in the city. We insisted on two rounds of shawarma even though we knew there was a wide range of entree waiting for us. 
The entree comprised chicken, lamb, shrimps, bhteki, baked vegetables with cheese, sprout dishes, lasagne, so on and so forth. Amongst the two chicken dishes available, the grilled chicken tasted really nice. It was soft, succulent, perfectly grilled with the spices soaked in well, and complemented the Metaxa with lime cordial. The grilled shrimps were a pleasure to reach out for with every single bite. I had about 20 shrimps, from both the cold salad and entree section. The quality, size, taste of the shrimps were extremely commendable and really well made. The lamb and bhetki dishes were okay in terms of taste but absolutely premium in terms of quality.
Moving on to desserts, we really liked the touch of Metaxa in the tiramisu and the cheesecake offered. All in all, the entire buffet was quite big and had a well laid out variety on the table. 
The cocktails were well made, and I took to Metaxa quite well. It apparently is the first liquor ever to be consumed in space (Source: Wikipedia). *Shrugs and feels good*

When the pocket feels happy and the heart cringes luxury, Taj Bengal is always the first option on consideration, and Souk sure makes for a great choice if one wants to go for Mediterranean cuisine.

Top notch restaurant for Middle Eastern food, and if you are a vegetarian and want to enjoy the cuisine look no further. 

Food: Rich flavourful food that will leave you feeling completely satiated. 

Must Eats: 
Yogurtulu Ispinaki -  Well balanced warm spinach salad with fresh tangy yogurt and sweet crispy onion shavings.
Artichwaki Batata Meshwi -  Grilled potato dish that is stuffed with artichokes, a must have for all potato lovers (Who doesn't like potatoes!). Pair it with hummus and pita.
Fattir - A mouth watering middle eastern take on pizza with halloumi cheese & bell peppers that is sweet, salty and crispy. 
Dessert - Always keep room for their home made rose petal ice-cream and if you like chocolate order the chocolate b'stilla.

Staff: Courteous and friendly with accurate knowledge of menu. Ask them to recommend a wine and they will not disappoint you. If you get a chance to talk to the Head Chef, he is great with feedback and will be very accommodating to your personal taste and preferences.

Ambience: Elegant interior with comfortable seating, makes for a pleasant dining experience. They also have private dining which can seat 8 people which is ideal for hosting small group dinners. 

Cons: The restaurant is understaffed and if you go at a busy time, the service can be a little slow. Also if you order for drinks, they usually take a lot longer than one would expect.

The Souk in my opinion is a little disappointing. Since it is a restaurant specializing in Mediterranean cuisine one would expect a lot more beef options to feature on the menu. The seafood choices are quite impressive. The Kibbe, Egyptan stew and the Turkish kebabs are really good. I really liked the flavour of the spices used. They weren't hot but were the falvours of the spices were layered and each layer was forthcoming. The orange flower ice cream, the baklava and the rose petal ice cream are really out of thsi worl. Next time I am there I am really looking forward to trying the ricotta cream dessert.

My first stay at the Taj Bengal, and I went for dinner to the Souk. Yes did a bit of looking around at all the restaurants, but finally settled for the middle eastern fare. The decor and ambience is good. The feel is open and airy. Sitting on the couches, rather reclining on the couches makes for a comfortable setting. Menu is quite exhaustive, bit pricey of course. Settled for the fixed menu dinner @1600+. A word of caution, this will not fill you up if you are really ravenous. Had to order extra pita bread, and one rice dish. Also had the Adana kebab. The food is quite authentic. Delicious. Meats melt in your mouth. But the portions are rather small. Will definitely burn a hole in your pocket too.

B'stilla with mushroom and goat cheese and fattir, which is the pizza is worth trying(even for non veggies).....  Well now coming to the end part. baklava everybody has atleast heard of it, if not tasted but what about b'stilla au lait????????? well i can go on and on but to truly savour the flavour , go out with your dear ones and enjoy the true taste of middle east, SOUK- the market place.

its been awarded the best mediterranean restaurant by the times food award. Try the kolokithi, tagine, mezze sampler for dessert try the bastilla au lait or the home made icecream (orange & pistachio,rose petal flavour). a chef's special TDH has been recently inroduced. Good quality ingredients are used so prices are accordingly.

Well hardly people in Kolkata know what Mediterranean food really is. This is the perfect place where you can find exactly what mediterranean food is and how it taste but yes carry loads of money in your kitty because do not forget you are walking into Taj. Amazing scrumptious food which melts in your mouth. The mezze sampler is amazing but horribly expensive. As expected the ambience is brilliantly done and the interiors are absolutely dazzling. 
Come here and expect to have an out of the world experience but be ready to spend lavishly. I would give it 4.5 and deduct 0.5 for its high pricing which stops you from visiting quite frequently.

Plush, elegant, quiet interiors... the contemporary Mediterranean-speciality restaurant Souk at Taj Bengal is just the place to experiment and excite your palate. Distinct flavours, aromatic spices and imported ingredients - you can be rest assured you get these here. The robust flavours of Greece, Morocco, Syria, Turkey, Egypt and Arabia, are all offered, under one roof. Platters, curries, seafood, kebabs, grills.... The Syrian chef adds to the local demand of elaborate vegetarian section on the menu. The innovative Hot and Cold Mezze, classic Hummus, Halloumi Cheese and Falafel make a good start. Meat lovers can tuck into the Calamari Salad, Samak Meshwi and the Minced Lamb Deep-fried Balls. Overall,a satisfying dining experience.

Whats great about the Souk is the ambience and service match up to the food quality. The staff goes out of their way to familiarise you with the cuisine and guide you in your dish selections. I really enjoyed the "lamb sambusek" which I had not tried before. Their "baklava" is delicious and one of the best I have eaten as was the "omali" which I have not tasted before. I am not much of a coffe drinker but one of my co-diners ordered the Turkish Coffee and said it was an excellent way to end the meal !

Absolutely delightful. Went there for dinner with my parents and had a wonderful time. We started with a hot mezze of a warm spinach dip and pita bread. A recommendation of our server and it was very tasty. Our main included a moussaka which I will definitely go and try again and a Moroccon ravioli which had a very unique and beautiful chili oil sauce too it. Even though we really wanted to try their desserts but we were too full by the end of our main course. 
The staff were very courteous and helpful throughout our meal. Even the manager was going to each table to ensure all his guests were enjoying themselves. Although a little expensive, but for me it was totally worth it. Would definitely recommend this place and would go their again, hopefully soon.

Souk.. It is one of the first Middle-eastern cuisine restaurant in Calcutta, I guess. So it is not particularly common in Kolkata. So, souk a very refreshing change for the diners of the city looking for something new. As expected from a five star restaurant, Souk is really fine by any standard. Excellent food, novel menu, nice ambiance, though expensive. The staff was very courteous. The servers were very attentive as well. . We had the Mezze Sampler which was really good I really liked the baklava. And the rose petal icecream was drop-dead sinful <3
Three and a half stars from me :)

Middle-eastern cuisine is not particularly common in Kolkata's "foodscape". So, souk is a rather refreshing venture for the fine dining connoisseurs of Kolkata. As expected from a Taj Bengal restaurant, Souk is really fine by any standard. Excellent food, novel menu, nice ambiance, courteous staffs; albeit, quite a bit pricy. They also have a nice private dining room in the upstairs, which is suitable for any special occasions. 
My pick: We particularly liked the bakllava and the lamb chops. The staffs also deserve a special mention.  They brought in the in-house violin player to play some tunes (We were there to celebrate a birthday). The chef was courteous enough to come to our table and brief the foods. The servers were very attentive as well. 
Recommendation: This place is one of the bests anyone can dine in. But I'm not sure if you'll want to visit this place every weekend, considering the price tag and the uncommon cuisine. Definitely recommended for special occasions and anytime you feel like trying something new.
