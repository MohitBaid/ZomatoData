We were almost tired after a long walk from lake side. So searching for a cosy sitting bit offbeat one. Suddenly found there was shop Coffee Book. Just get in , found a really diff look.liked it. Hospitality is really appreciated.
We had ordered regular coffee and baked pasta which was really good. Collection of books is really good. Overall experience is feel good, u can spare hours for private talk over there. I really love the place.

If you're looking for some quiet time by yourself or even in company of friends, this cozy nook doesn't let you down. I loved the plating of the springrolls, the virgin pinna colada and the blueberry choco oreo shake. The staff is also very accommodating - they readily switched to using ice cream instead of milk when i let them know i'm lactose intolerant. Added advantage: there's a whole wall cabinet full of books you can buy from. Discounts applied.  Definitely recommend.

Ambiance is really good. Coffee with a good collection of fictions Nd non-fictions would be great paradise for Bengali culture. 
Variety of cuisine, mostly a fusion of Bengali & continental style is very palatable. Me and my friend had a great time over there. All the best for the owner. Hope it will go long.

No here's another small cutesy cafe at Deshapriya Park-Southern Avenue junction where you are sure to find a place at any given time during the day. Service is crisp and food is on point. I have had mocktails and sandwiches and the bill never really burns a hole in the pocket so that's a big thing! With tastefully done eclectic decor, a decent collection of books on display ( I hear you can read them too although it is clearly mentioned on the shelves that they are only for purchase) and an affordable pricing, honestly there is nothing more to ask for!

Coffee Book is definitely a great place for the coffee lovers out there. 

Located in sarat bose road, next to THE STEAK HOUSE and just opp to FUJI RESTAURANT, is this newly opened cafe which has some really good food to offer.
The decor is quite pretty, like any other coffee shops, but what drove my attention was the book section. They have some good collection of books which are up for sale. 
Now coming to the food. We ordered
1) TWO CAPPUCCINOS AND
2) COFFEE BOOK SPECIAL FRIED FISH.

Firstly, the service was good.  And the fish which we were served was really fresh and just made. 
We were served two bhetki fish fries, topped with cheese and chopped capsicum and onions along with French fries and some mayo and ketchup. 
The fries were very well made, with soft flaky bhetki inside and the crunchy coating outside. The food was quite fresh and was also reasonable.
Coming to the coffee, it was quite descent and likeable. 
Wanted to have their fried ice cream, but as we were getting late, we had to go. 
But really liked the place. The service was good and the staff members were also warm and courteous..
RECOMMENDED!!

Nice place. My dad and I took two out of town guests for a cup of tea here this evening, mainly because they have a sizeable vegetarian menu. Our guests were having veg today on account of Ganesh chaturthi, so we went for two plates of cheese cigars, and a plate of Mexican cheese toast. Very tasty food, service is also very nice. Maybe need a little more experience in terms of service. I was a little surprised to see the place nearly empty on a Friday evening, though. The tea served to us came in huge mugs, and also the food was quite satisfactory in terms of portion as well as taste. My fellow zomatoans, do pay a visit, they also have books and gifts for sale. Although maybe next time I'll be rude enough to ask them to turn the TV down.

A superb place to hangout with friends or spend time with your love...had Caramel Pudding, Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Cappuccino...the sandwich was quite juicy filled with lots of chicken...the appetizing caramel pudding just stole my heart. Rates are pocket friendly. A must try!
Keep up the good work Coffee Book.

An awesome find at sarat banerjee road, a cute little place with nice decor. Food is excellent over here, no elaborate menu but smartly done. Food taste will always bring you back here. Very warm hosts, in short thank you for the experience.

Friendly ambience, with classy and warm interiors.The mouth watering foods are quite pocket friendly. The grilled chicken sandwich just melted in my mouth. They have collection of books and gift items too. A must hangout place for people of all ages, to have their warm cup of Assam tea or cappuccino.

Amazing mouth watering food, perfect friendly ambience. Cozy atmosphere. What more can one ask for when there are books to read and a cup of coffee to drink.
