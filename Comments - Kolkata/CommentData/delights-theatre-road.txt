I ordered veg noodles from delights and it had too much of salt and less vegetables. Bad quality. Didn't expected this. Try to improve taste would be better.

A little over priced. The quantity isn't that great however the service is really fast. Since it's so close to college I usually opt for it. They have hiked up the price of cold coffee which makes me sad.

This used to be one of our favourite hangouts during college days. So many pleasant memories associated with this place. Would eat chowmein and the vegetable hotdog every alternate day. But that was years ago.

Yesterday eve after a shopping session was wondering where to eat. That's when I passed Delights and decided to relive my college memories. 

I was in a hurry to reach home so I got a parcel;

 Chowmein
Cheese Grilled Sandwich
Veg Wrap
Soft drink

I was quite surprised by the bill. It was under Rs 200. It's been years since I passed out of college but the increase in cost of food items here is hardly much.

The veg Wrap is a great addition. The potato filling slathered with mayonnaise and ketchup was super. I ended up not sharing it with anyone.

The other two dishes were quite good as well. Quantity is generous  keeping college students in mind.

Would go again for sure this time my college mates are in Kolkata.

This eatery is opposite Xavier's back gate. Had the half plate chow, mini pizza and the sandwich. All tasted good. Worth the prices. Really like the half plate concepts which make it easy for a person coming alone to eat

Located at the back gate of st Xaviers college . It acted as a saviour during the college days . Famous for it sandwich and masala soda , this place was a lifeline then . The rating is not only for the food but the vibe of this place.

Just opposite to St. Xavier's college, i guess this place have been a real thirst buster with their variety of drinks for all those thirty students coming out of the college . Not only drinks they also deal in the following food stuffs in their versatile menu. Place is small but clean.
I had my meal just beside them so couldn't try their food items but took their Soda Sikanjee which is my all time favorite. Served in a average glass with sweet and salt taste and masala included separately. Costed 20 bucks which is somewhere above the quantity they are offering.  
Will definitely coming to this place again to get delighted with the delights. 

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Delights is definitely a delight forum me! I love the cheese and corn grilled vegetable sandwich here. I am not a fan of vegetarian joints but this joint is definitely one my latest favourites. The place is small and is heavily crowded in the mornings. The menu had quite a few items but I am more than happy with the sandwich and hence I have no desire to try anything else! 
I did try the colder coffee once but it was okay. Felt a bit too watery but it was fine nonetheless. 
The sandwich here is a must try and the prices are quite cheap. If you have not been to Delights yet, you must go! Whenever near St Xaviers, this place is a must try. You just cannot miss out on such an incredible sandwich!

This used to be one of the only places around at Xavier's college and one of the most popular hangout joint of the area for all the students of Xavier's. This was the only place where u could get decent hygienic fast foods like burgers, dosa and grilled sandwiches. The food is not anything our lives do the world but it is very basic. The prices have gone up drastically since when we were in college and used to hangout and go there for fountain Pepsi and sandwiches.

Delights is located just opposite to the St. Xavier's College backgate. Hence, students drop by often for a bite off their dosas,  sandwiches and shakes especially.

And finally it is so wonderful to see the small little shop at the back of xaviers which is of course a wonder shop , a student's favourite. The lunch time of xaviers would see the shop overcrowded. For me, it is always the alternative to yummies on my veggie days. I love to team up nescafe with corn and cheese sandwich they make. And as for the grilled mixed sandwich , it definitely tastes yum. The dosa I feel is amazing for those people who love south indian dishes. However the idly gets boring high time. But what is the basic drawback of this shop is the limited choice of menu that is possibly available.  But definitely delights keeps me super delighted with the sandwich and coffee during the lunch break and what better if you bag a place in the "green bench".

Still, we, the Xavierians love delights as it's almost a part of us. The smoothies are tasty though. The place is always forever crowded.

The variety in South Indian is mind boggling. They make really good cheese dosa and dhaniya dosa. Some customers are so fond of their coconut chutney that they replace the usual bowl of sambhar with that of a chutney. You don't just have food their but you make relationships, such is the ambiance their. The place is a tad small and you would end up having your meal their almost standing but the awesome food just overshadows it. Wai-wai bhel is an other dish which is fast picking up and is soon to be claimed as the hottest selling dish their. Do visit this fine foodspot  if you happen to visit St. Xaviers college in Kolkata.

How have i not reviewed this place before ? So many fond memories :)It was a life saviour for all us xavierans :) The dhania masala dosa,bhav bhaji dosa,chocolate shake, spring roll are just amazing.Corn and cheese sandwich, pastas are equally nice. Fountain pepsi were a must for me with anything i ordered.

Well i wont deny the food isnt most hygenically prepared for their kitchen is puny.But i have never had a bad stomach eating their food,not that i care :p i simply adore this place :) 

Drop in at lunch time (be warned dont go anytime between 6 to 7,hungry xavierians crowd this place so much that you wont get a shot to order ) 

Prices are kept according to the student pockets and the staff are really warm :) 

If you happen to cross sxc anytime do try this place out :)

Delights is the absolute 'go to' place for all the vegetarians who do not like the stale Xavier's canteen food. 

The variety of the menu is pretty good- from South Indian to Italian to the usual sandwich, burgers and the junk Chinese. 

The South Indian is really good here- specially the dosas and the idlis. However, the idlis seem a little heavy on pocket (50 for 1 plate).

I, personally love the spring roll they serve. It's not oily and stuffed with noodles instead of the conventional veggies. The Pasta is also pretty darn good. 
However, their sandwiches ain't so great. Somehow, the punch is just missing. If you want to have better sandwiches try shibuji which is just beside Vardaan. Also, the noodle is kinda bland. Or maybe it's just me who likes it really spicy(!)

All in all, This is the perfect food joint for the much needed adda and good food for all the Xavierians. 

P. S. Stay away from the cold drink they serve. It's half water -.-

Delights is like the lunch joint for every Xavierian who prefer veg food. whenever i go there, i usually order the cheese dosa or masala dosa. I think thats the best to eat there apat from the idli which isn't bad either. I am not  a fan of their sandwiches as i feel they lack the right flavour. It's also very cheap on your pocket so it's not bad.

Again, bang opposite my college. Delights is a delightful place if you are a vegetarian. 
Like any other vegetarian street joint, this place serves an array of delightful food which includes, idly, dosa, sandwiches, pav bhaji, pasta etc. 

The Idly is the pop pick amongst students as they provide two large idlis which is properly steamed with sambhar which deserves a special mention for being really good and coconut chutney. It also has a coke station which serves fountain coke. Apart from that, there is tea, coffee and shakes too. 
A decent place for a quick bite, but a tad over priced as two idlis cost Rs. 50.
Worth a visit, if you are vegetarian, not quite if you are not.

When i think of my college, i cannot resist thinking of cafe delights somehow or the other. Its been the host to a lot of memories. I even remember the father of our college catching hold of us guys right from inside the cafe and taking us to attend the college without getting the attendance for that day. 

As soon the bell would ring at 8 in the morning, the whole gang would be rushing to delights to get sip of their coffee with lots of drinking chocolate. Sandwiches, dosas, burgers were all pretty good alongside their coffee. I do not remember having visited the place after college but would be doing so whenever i get a chance for old times sake.

Otherwise, its a descent eatery for takeaways, or if you want to grab a quick bite though there is no seating arrangement except for a few plastic chairs that i never could fit into.

Again one of those little places that have been around forever ..... bang opposite the back gate of St.Xaviers .... we would often walk down from college to meet our friends studying in Xaviers. Was chilled out and pocket friendly and the food was tasty and fresh all important to perpetually hungry and broke college students ! The burger and sandwich and the occasional cheese dosa along with a cold drink was our usual order. Not a sit down kinda place we mostly would hang around outside and chit chat .... stopped there for a burger a while back by driving past it for old times sake and found it to be decent enough .

Catering mostly to the Xaverian crowd of students and parents alike, this corner eatery has become more of a walk down the memory lane for all xaverians... The South Indian food served by them is really good (try the bhaaji dosa). The lemonade is just up to the mark, while the soda shikanji is just okay. However, what really draws the crowd is its bread preparations - be it the cheese sandwich or the burger, Delights scores in all its sandwich preparations. The rates are a bit high, given that it lacks proper sitting.. But, the amiable nature of Panditji, the old man sitting behind the counter, makes you buy at least something from Delights, every time you step inside it!

Fast food which caters mostly to the st.xaviers college students. If your from xaviers this is the go to place for a quick pocket friendly meal.  Its A small take away or stand in and eat counter so dont expect any seating or fast service. A hang out place. Always crowded and bustling because of the college. If your not a college student this place can be a hit and a miss.
