Had the reshmi masala it was very good as the chicken was soft nd the pieces were boneless but the prices are high but they serve good food .

Its a famous local biriyani and tandoori place. can take away and enjoy the dinner in your home with loved ones. My favourites are chicken tandoori, hariyali kabab, Tengri kabab.

While travelling to power house from howrah maidaan via panchanantala road today , I noticed dis small little street joint and felt the desire to taste kebabs. There were strands of kebabs that lay hanging forging me to get off my toto n walk towards the shop.  I listened to my heart but my mind said, it was too unhygienic.  I anyway do what my heart says. I called my sister whose house I was heading to and she came down at jet speed. This shop typically looked like the kebab shops at hazratganj and aminabad in lucknow. We dropped the idea of hogging down there and decided to get it parcelled. Instead of going for a full plate of a kind. We decided to get half plate of two kinds of kebab. They suggested us we should go for the leg kebab. But my "discoverer soul" found there were 2 new type of kebab that was there in the menu. The hatthali kebab and the pahari kebab was what we ordered. The pahari kebab wasnt available so we just stuck on to hariyali kebab. But would definitely want to try this pahari kebab sometime. So we finally took it home. The hariyali kebab is highly recommended.  The hatthali was also good. But definitely people must eat what this shop has got to offer. I want to have more of kebabs from haji malang.

Biriyani is average but the tandoori and the kabab items is best
