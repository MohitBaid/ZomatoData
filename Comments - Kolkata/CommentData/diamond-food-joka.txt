A stand alone fast food joint located right at the crossing of Diamond Park, and James Long Sarani. Though the word ambience have no relevance with this place, but off course it is a good place to grab some hot&fresh bites on the go at an absolutely pocket friendly price. In fact the food is tasty and do not make you feel heavy. The owner Mr. Tapas Das, is a person very jolly and friendly in nature, and a nice person indeed.
Overall, it is a good place to grab a few bites.

Nothing much really to brag about....Poor and disappointing...Typically the oil is way to high to cut the level low...Lacks maintenance and quality...   !!
