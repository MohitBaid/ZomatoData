This restaurant is located on the ground floor of Upohar Town Center which happens to be the closest shopping complex to my college. Very often I and my friends would find ourselves near Upohar and very often we used to grab a roll from there. But the rolls are certainly where this restaurant's credibility ends. 
Firstly this restaurant has accommodation for only 8 people. Add in the fact that the restaurant itself doesn't seen to be the most hygienic of places. So I would recommend not to dine in. As mentioned above their strength is the rolls they serve which are quite nice. Their veg rolls, chicken rolls, and egg-veggie rolls (which is quite unique if you ask me) are quite well made. I have also tried their biryani which is very dry, and the chicken was very chewy, which is never a good thing for a biryani. The chicken lollipop I once tried was overcooked as well. The upper skin of the meat was slightly burned which gave the dish a terrible taste. I would recommend that if you visit this restaurant, try to order the rolls.

I must caution anybody ordering Moglai Parota from this place. I am visiting Kolkata for few days from Delhi, and I was nostalgic about this very special Bengali delicacy, but to my utter horror they send us Moglai parota which had no egg. NO EGG in moglai parota, can anybody believe that? Moglai parota recipe can be looked up on YouTube, it should be made of white flour, very thinly spread on tawa break an egg inside it, spread it, then sprinkle some onion. You can add chicken if you want, and then fold it from four side and deep fry it. 

But this place the base of the parota was too thick, they had some dry tasteless filling inside which was apparently made of biscuit power,  chana, etc. I called them to ask why there is no egg in moglai parota they said "this is how we make it." Which just means they do not know how to make Moglai Parota. Adding the photos to explain what I got.

Overall extremely bad taste, bad experience and when we  gave feedback it was not well received. The guy kept arguing "this is how we make moglai parota, we don't add egg." Well he is just wrong.

This is the second time I had faced the same problem with the food I ordered a couple of days back. I ordered chili garlic chicken but instead I got garlic chicken. Later I got it replaced with the original order. The worst part is that the pieces were quite hard it felt like chewing a piece of rubber instead.

Located at the upohar complex,this is a place frequented by the residents of this area. The chicken lollypop is the best thing they serve. The menu at hand is huge but most of the items are not available. They are pretty inconsistent with their taste as well and jumble up orders pretty frequently.
Can be given a miss.!

This place is located on the ground floor of Upohar Town Centre. It is located very close to my college and hence, I have visited this place many a time. They serve a lot of dishes and have seating arrangements for 8 people(2 tables of 4 chairs each). I have tried almost all the rolls they have in their menu and a few of them were really good.



Veg Roll(4/5): This is one of the best rolls they offer. They sabzi they put in the roll is very tasty. A must-try item from this place.



Chicken Roll(3.5/5): This is an average to taste item. Nothing special in it. Nevertheless, it is a decent item to try.



Egg Roll(3/5): This roll did not impress me much. Maybe because the sauce they had put in did not complement the roll.



Egg Veg Roll(4/5): This roll was very good to the taste buds. The preparation they have for Veg Roll is good and that is what sets the rolls apart. Hence, any of the Veg Rolls are a must-try from here.



The restaurant did not look very hygienic. It is not air-conditioned which is a big disadvantage during the summers. The roll counter however looked hygienic and this place is mostly frequented by people for ordering rolls only. The windy Upohar complex creates a nice atmosphere to enjoy your roll in.

Tried their Chicken Tikka Kebab one day. It was unplanned, we were just walking by. They surprised us with the succulent large pieces of Tikka. Impressed I walked in a second day to see if it is a flash in the pan. But it was not! As good as the last day, the pieces were large, soft, done to perfection and served piping hot. Those who read and trust my review, try this item here. 4.5 out of 5.

Me and my friend had decided to order takeaway from here a while back. We had ordered egg gravy chowmein. I liked the fact that they packed the gravy and the chowmein in different containers. The taste of the gravy was better than I expected it to be. It went well with the noodles. The rolls here are also satisfactory,although too oily.

Prices are appreciable considering the quantity of food served. But they should improve the quality of food and the hygiene part.

Had the chicken lollipop as a starter. It was very well cooked, soft and had the right fresh taste. The noodles are good as well with plenty of ingredients including prawn and minced chicken in the mixed hakka noodles. It started of well, however ended disappointingly with the Schezewan Chicken which seemed like fillets of chicken floating in an abundance of soy sauce.

Following a friend’s suggestion had biriyani from Neil’s kitchen and was totally disappointed with not the quantity but quality of the food. A strong essence of ittar/attar was all over the biriyani, and the crude taste of fried onions leaves you with a sore taste bud in addition to which you will find an agonizing service when it comes to home delivery and a hellish experience reaching out to them over phone..
First among the restaurants I’ve visited this far serving biriyani, Neil’s kitchen fails to serve you with the mutton variant although clearly mentioned in the food chart provided.
Neil’s kitchen oozes lack of professionalism in its every sector packing in 3-4 tables and the ambience with the interior decoration never fails to leave an impression of a roadside dhaba/restaurant, moreover you will be denied with a takeaway food brochure in case you consider ordering over the phone.
The economical food rates and an appreciable amount of biriyani rice, two pieces of chicken paired up with a half potato and an egg fails to cope with the substandard qualities of everything Neil’s kitchen offers.
In short, if you are running low on budget, if you are on a not so handsome pocket allowances and not snobbish about the accommodation or have taken into consideration the takeaway option… Neil’s kitchen will serve you good.

I will better die out of hunger rather than taking food from here. Pathetic. Last day we ordered egg rice and chilly chicken. The rice smelled like kerosene. Even after complaining, the changed rice smelled the same. Say it moghlai, or rolls, or kabab's, all the foods of this joint are oil dipped. It was good earlier, but for now, its a big NO.

I am writing this review without having eaten once here. My experience in itself with their service on two separate occasions have been so bad, that I did not even feel like eating there. The first occasion had been a couple of months ago when I visited their place at 4PM on a Sunday. The response of the people present had been so callous and uninviting that I felt like I am there being a burden on them. Whatever I asked from the menu, I was curtly replied "ekhon hobena"/"it's not available now" OR "deri hobe"/"will take time". The second incident happened just a few moments ago, when I called them up for home delivery. Note that my house is around 2-3 kms from the place. The amount that I placed for the order was 320 and again I was very curtly told "ekhon keo nei jawar jonyo"/"nobody is available to deliver". They should learn from their nearby counterparts such as Gr8 Rolls, Kickshaw and even Mia Amore. Needless to say, I am neither ordering food nor eating EVER over there again.

Affordable place! The Moghlai paratha is amazing! The biriyani isn't bad too! Very reasonable compared to the others (For 125/-, they give you a good quantity of rice, a huge slice of potato, two pieces of chicken and and egg.) The rest is so-so. But nevertheless, a great take away option.

Niels' Kitchen is a take away cum outdoor eatery in the Upohar Complex. The Rolls, Chicken Lollipops, The Mughlais are good. I have not yet tried the Biriyani, will try it soon. Overall its an OK place to have a munch in the evening and that is what it is meant for. I had also made a Bulk Home Delivery on the Birthday, and was quite impressed by their service as the food was delivered at my doorstep amidst severe rain and thunderstorms.

Advice to owner:-
Please change your Momos, they are really tasteless. And please don't serve them with tomato sauce, prepare a sauce for the Momos as it is done everywhere.
