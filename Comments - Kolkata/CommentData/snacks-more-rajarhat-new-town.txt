Ordered for home delivery.
Delivery was on time, packaging was okay and taste was also okay.
Ordered cheese masala dosa and masala dosa. Size of the dosa was enough to satiate hunger of one person. But the taste was very okayish, i mean at this price it was not at all good. The local stall's dosa tastes better. There was hardly any cheese in the cheese masala dosa. Coconut chatni was good but sambar was again okayish.

I ordered club kachori and jalebis referring to other reviews. Jalebi's were worth the try and the kachoris were moderately okay. So if you are looking for a penny saver breakfast option, snacks & more fits in.

I have ordered 4 items today. The kesariya jillebi is too good. The onion masala dhosa is also good. But the dahi vada is too sour. And tomato soup is average. Almost a good food is delivered by snacks and more. I expect next time the item dahi vada will comparison's sweet instead of sour.

Have ordered from here a number of times and must say, it has been a good experience each time. Love their neat packaging and tasty street foods. Having lived in Delhi for a considerable number of years, I do occasionally crave chhole bhature and this place makes it exactly like the ones in Delhi. So that gave them major bonus points. I also really love their aloo parathas and dosas. Only glitch, the cheese dosas come with negligible cheese. 
I mostly order breakfasts and cannot wait to try more of their vegetarian delights.

Heard about it a lot ...but it was one of the best worst foods I have ever come across....the club kachori was soft the sabji had no taste (it was full of puchka water put into it) the aloo paratha did not have aloo inside it.....wasting food is a crime..but maybe God will forgive my sin this time.

Did not want to give a rating of 1 also....but unfortunately 0 is not enough to give the feedback.

I often order from snacks and more. Food is good and tasty and I like the South Indian specialities. However they need to improve on delivery time. This time I offered butter masala dosa and Dahi vada and the delivery time was after 1.5 hours but the boy came after 2 hours which was too much. Please deliver sooner for lesser items that should be my feedback to the owner. Food quality is good.

Have seen many peoples review about this place. I also have bought and eaten food from here. So, here comes a review.
1. Bought 2 items, First alu parantha with curd and Vegetable Biryani.2. The parantha was awesome, I would like to try their other types of parantha. It can be said Finger Licking Good.....3. The vegetable biryani... It was basically a NIGHTMARE...Just thinking that was the oil so cheap for them...And do they really know what a Biryani tastes like...It was basically Veg rice, Sobji Bhat...People of and near Rajarhat, Chinar Park, and nearby places please don't order Biryani from here...And for other dishes many other reviews are available...

Horrible......it could not be more than that.
Ordered a cheese pav bhaji and 4 plates of club kachori from the outlet.
Firstly the owner of the restaurant sent me a paecel of five plates instead of 4 plates and then to the awesomeness the cheese pao bhaji had an layer of oil filled till the end of the box instead of cheese. I guess they get oil for free.
When I made a complaint that the idiot caller is telling come and drop the order we cannot collect it back. They can send order to your place and cannot collect it back because thay have to return the money to u.

Food here is great. I should say one should order Puchka here. It comes with 4types of water served chilled in shot glasses. The taste of puchka is a little different from local vendors. The "puchka pani" varities has taken a hang on me. Just cant get the taste out of me.Â 
The outlet is simple yet the homely feel is never missing. Just loved the "garma garam" club kachori and kesariya jalebi. The food is very light and is great in taste.Â 
If you are ordering food dont forget to bite the hold Gulab jamuns here. I am a fan of them.

Just get rid of the flies.......
