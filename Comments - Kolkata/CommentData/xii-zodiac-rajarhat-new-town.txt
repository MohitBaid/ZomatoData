Went for the buffet lunch with my family. As we entered this beautiful place we were warmly welcomed by the staff.Then we were served starters on our table.The main course and desert section was equally delicious. Ambiance was also very soothing. One thing that really impressed me is their service. The staff was very courteous and helpful.They gave proper attention to each of the guests and took special care of our requirements.A big thumbs up to the whole team of xii zodiac .Will surely visit again.

If you are wondering for a perfect hangover lunch, there's XII Zodiac, Newtown, who serves the best in town. The hangover lunch of 1 st January in this wonderful restaurant gave me such splendid feeling . A perfect hangover lunch of the very first day of 2018 was quite a perfect start to new year. The menu of the lunch included variety of salads, soups and the awesome part was the starters . Beverages including Mandarin Caprioska and flavours water, and , yes, of course in the unlimited quantity gave us the real feeling of freshness. 
The starters were the tastiest part, this resturent absolutely offers a wonderful range of continental dishes. Tandoori Murgh, Murgh Gilafi Seekh Kebab are the best dish of chicken, the delicious masala and the kebab feels like the most starry flavours.
Bengali fish fry is something we are never get bored of, but the crunchy flavour was really a tasty one, and the starter menu was followed by Teriyaki fish, BBQ prawn and pepper skewer. These two continental flavours added a great flavoursome in our lunch.
Pesto paneer tikka, malai makai Seekh were another two spicy and delish meal in the menu. And the veg part of the starters included Tangy Sesame baby corn abd corn cheese nuggets. These two cheesy savours made us feel mouth watering. 

The main course offered our favourite mutton biriyani, which was even more spicy and elegant flavoured, the spices really  provided a magical taste in our tounge. And there's  nothing new in the Dhabe wali Murgh Bharta, but the pairing with the specific biriyani was quite a yum feel. The new foods I came across in this restaurant were Grilled chicken with pepper sauce and the mountain chili fish, both the uncommon creations presented us a delish ambience.
The main course offered us more veg dishes also, but the quantity of such wonderful dishes already filled our stomach. 
And lastly not the least the lunch was incomplete without the desserts. Being a Bengali and a foodie I couldn't resist to taste such baked Mihidana, Chukandar ka halwa. Brownie was another one not to be missed. Sandesh, yes who doesn't love ghur ka sandesh, Bengalis are always fond of these chanar payesh.

And my new year started with a real note of enjoying a proper and mouth watering hangover lunch. I really liked the hospitality we were offered, I'm surely gonna visit this place once again.

The restaurant is the first Sun sign based restaurant in the town. Situated on the 2nd floor of the Fern Regency, near the Chinar Park crossing. The place serve A la Carta as well as buffet spread.
been there few days ago with my friends and the place was huge. The manager of the restaurant warmly welcome us with a smile. The stuffs are really helpful & too much courteous. Service is fast & management is careful enough to satisfy its customer from starting to ending. The starters were all awesome & the main course was good but the dessert section was simply just mind blowing.
After having a great lunch time, I specially want to thanks to Mr. Dutta, who came to us & asked about the service & food. This is a very positive point I found here. Overall a great dining experience & will surely visit this place again.

This restaurant is a part of Fern the Residency Hotel.We went there on 1st of January for lunch and immidiately got a table.The ambience was nice and gave out a starry feel.The menu card was unique and had  some interesting trivia that can be used as conversation starters.

Food:We ordered two dishes- Chicken cooked in Mushroom jus and Southern style fried chicken, both of which were cooked to perfection.A special mention for the man in charge Mr Subhankar Pakhira.The restaurant was only serving Indian buffet for that day and we were in the mood for something continental in ala carte.He Arranged for the same in extremely short notice changing our decision to eat elsewhere.Overall a good place to eat in.

One thing that they could improve upon is have more options in continental cusine in main course.Good place for a romantic lunch or dinner date on a reasonable pocket pinch.

The ambiance was nice.
But the service and hospitality was horrific. In a span of one and half hours they managed to serve four to five starters. 
Waiting for quite a long span of time, we were served half of the starters repeated over and over again.
Then the main course was fine. But nothing extraordinary.
Deserts - They were unable to serve some items. After a bit, we surrendered and almost ended the dinner without deserts.
Food - 3/5
Service - 0.5/5 
Staff - 0/5
Value for money - 1/5
If you are patient enough and can wait for hours with an empty plate in front of you waiting to be served, you can visit or else it's better to try someplace else.

XII Zodiac is a relatively new restaurant compared to the big chains. In my opinion, its a cosy and sophisticated new boutique restaurant. I do enjoy the fact that XII Zodiac is the first theme restaurant in Kolkata and I think this alone is a new concept as centering the star signs is something out of the box compared to the usual.

They started with a platter consisting of jal jeera, fruits on a stick, cheese breadstick, chaat. This represented the restaurant concept of Earth, Fire, Water and Air signs.

Moving on to the food, the starters were delicious. We were served Pepper Fish, Fish Orly, Chicken Tikka Masala, Fried Chicken, Chicken Sheek Kebab. Out of these, both the Fish starters were splendid! I would just like to see more of a variety when it comes to choice of meat like Prawns.

The Mains were not that great. There is alot of room for improvement; the quality and consistency of good food is not maintained. They could have done better in this section.

Overall, its a pretty good restaurant and a good place to bring your family.

After having read good reviews about XII Zodiac Buffet spread we decided to pay a visit on this Christmas with family. Liked the Christmas decorations around the dining area, ambiance was good. What followed next were 10 starters ......majority were good. Among the main course, the mutton biryani was yumm, the turkey roast turned cold totally, wish the staff took care of this! Deserts were quite common items, no chance for something out of the box! Spread overall was good and it was somewhat worth the distance we traveled to be there. Hope to be back someday for week-day lunch buffet soon.

Tried buffet out here.
Quality was good not excellent.
Also for starter lovers of chkn grilled or fried this is not the place with only 3 non beg items in starter and 3 non veg items in main course
786 bucks was quite too much to pay for such quantified food items

One of the most recommended among the 'themed restaurants' to have both your planned and unplanned lunches or dinners. Had a long and tiresome day and you're anywhere around Rajarhat? Must Check this place out for it delivers a soothing ambience and warm environment created by its innovative decor and staffs. Moreover, be not surprised if the chef himself walks down to you to enquire if you are comfortable with the food. Not to mention, the dishes delivered a good enough to soothe your appetite and mind as well.

Visited this place for the first time with 5 of my friends for buffet. We had done pre-booking to avoid complications.

Ambience: The place is small which serves both buffet and a la carte. It is well lit and the manager showed us our table. The theme was of candle-light dinner. The staffs welcomed us warmly as if they were expecting us. I am very much pleased with their hospitality.

Service: We were served welcome drinks, then the starters came one by one. The number of starters were quite high since they were serving both tandoori and chinese cuisines. As far as I remember, the starter contained Chicken Kebab, Tandoori Chicken, Schezwan Chicken, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Cheese Balls, Prawn Kebab and some more. The main course contained some 10 dishes, again containing a mixture of Chinese and Indian dishes. The mutton was served at the table tough. The manager and the staffs were continuously enquiring about the food and if any improvement could've been done.

Food: The starters were simply awesome. We were almost full after the starters itself. The main course was at par with the starters. All the dishes were nicely cooked and well presented. The desserts were less but tasty. I simply loved the cake they were serving for desserts. It was the best cake I've ever eaten.

I thank all the staffs who took great care of us. We will be visiting again. This place is certainly one of my new favorites.

Watermelon Mojito ‚Äì crushed watermelon along with chunks of lime. It was very light and soothing. Good start.¬†

Aloo ke kebabs was okay too.¬†

Located near City center 2, Rajarhat.

Went for the special christmas lunch buffer.

Ambience: Being part of the Fern Residency Hotel, this place is beautifully decorated. Quite and quaint and dimly lit in the afternoon. 
Wish they would have switched on some more lights for better selfies üòã

Staff: extremely courteous, prompt and kind. A smile in the staff's face automatically makes you feel comfortable. 

Food: 
They welcome you with a watermelon drink and a plate of phuchka.
1. Starters: chicken kebabs, mutton sheekh, and fish in north indian style and a Chinese fish and chilli honey prawn.
The starters win you over. Scrumptious and punches you with good flavour.

2. Mains: Lots of variety. Biriyani is worth mentioning and the chicken dishes. 

There was roasted turkey too which was bland, cold and chewy. The only dish I did not like. The rest had good flavour and made me happy.

3. Desserts: i am in love with the baked gajar halwa. It blew me off with it's smooth texture. The chocolate cake was moist and spongy, loved it.
The mousse were too sweet for my taste. 

Overall, we loved the food and would definitely visit again.

XII Zodiac is situated near City Center 2, Kolkata. The restaurant‚Äôs theme is on the zodiac signs as suggested by the name. The interior decor and ambiance is very nice. The food is extremely well presented and the staffs are polite and warm. On settling down you will be asked your Zodiac sign and as you anticipate what will happen based on that, you will be served a welcome tit-bit platter.

‚ÄúCancer‚Äôs are selfish eaters and hate sharing their food, so if they share their food,they must really like you.‚Äù- I‚Äôm a cancerian and that‚Äôs what astrology has to say about my FOODING habits but is it so?

Food is way beyond breakfast,lunch & dinner to me,but is a language which connects tastebuds with the artistry of cooking and XII Zodiac carries the philosophy with precision.

Situated at The Fern Residency in Chinar Park,Kolkata ‚Äì a few kilometres from The Airport, this place is not just about the dining,but is an experience in itself.

‚ÄúZodiac‚Äù as the name suggests is the THEME of this place and you‚Äôll find this whole place carrying the element of astrology to illuminate the idea.

Well, we all tend to eat only that food which has been served to us since birth ‚Äì veg or non-veg, low fat or high fat, Indian or Chinese ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. But the average foodie does not even know that he can even eat according to the day / date he was born on. And yes, the only place in Kolkata serving you according to your stars is XII Zodiac ‚Äì inside the Fern Residency nearby the Chinar Park, Rajarhat!

Size of the place is not gigantic but yes, can accommodate 40 ‚Äì 50 odd heads, this being a Zodiac themed restaurant has its walls d√©cor with the 12 signs and what they mean for each of us! They also distribute placards predicting your nature / future!

We foodies went for their dinner buffet to celebrate the impending X-Mas as well as new year and sampled the below:-

P.S.:- Their menu if pretty long and I will deliberate upon the veg items only!

Welcome drink:-

Watermelon Mojito ‚Äì Lots of crushed watermelon along with chunks of kaffir lime ‚Äì we could not have asked for a better drink to start off the dinner.

Starters:-

Vegetables Sweet Corn Soup ‚Äì The regular soup with the regular taste

XII Zodiac Veg basket ‚Äì Bhaja, paneer and yellow capsicum kebabs in tangy sauce and vegetable kebabs ‚Äì The item which made our evening great ‚Äì special thanks to the juicy capsicum slices which went pretty well with those tangy sauces! This is a must try from their new menu!

Aloo ke kebabs ‚Äì Pretty ordinary ‚Äì expected to be better roasted!

Paneer tikka kebabs ‚Äì Paneer triangles served with green chutney and layers of onion peel, this was just fine!

Cheese balls ‚Äì They did not impress although the presentation rocks ‚Äì especially the golden fry colour!

Veg crispy babycorns ‚Äì Truly crispy, but low on taste

Main Course:-:-

Slice veg in Manchurian Sauce ‚Äì Just fine

Dal Tadka ‚Äì Complimented the steamed rice pretty well!

Plain Curd

Creamy Fruit salad ‚Äì lots of sliced apples, pomegranates, cherries, lots of cream and lots of taste!

Variety chutney and sauces 

Pickles

Raita

Roasted Cauliflower and Almond salad ‚Äì Did not taste

Aloo Anar chaat ‚Äì The bhujia added to the crispiness of this items!

Colour Bellpepper caprese

Assorted lettuce

Veg Hakka Noodles ‚Äì Perfectly dry ‚Äì the optimum oil content and veg content ‚Äì wish I could have tonnes of it ‚Äì perfectly thin also (good quality).

Coke / Thumbs up ‚Äì Served on request (so that we can digest this heavy meal)!

Aloo palak ‚Äì Expected to be better ‚Äì because good quality spinach is available in the winters!

Steamed rice

Sliced onions

Butter Naan ‚Äì Thin and cripsy

Papads

Paneer lababdar ‚Äì The pick of the main course ‚Äì marinated in lots of cheese as well, served with coriander toppings!

Dal Makhani ‚Äì Punjabi styled ‚Äì had 2 bowls of the same owing to high taste!

Desserts:-

Veg crepes ‚Äì Could not taste as it was depleted and not refilled even after repeated requests!

Brownie (Eggless) ‚Äì Had 4 pieces of the same ‚Äì the walnut studded brownie could kill one by its taste ‚Äì beware bakeries!

Fruits section ‚Äì Orange, Melon, Water Melon, Pineapple

Gulab Jamun ‚Äì Could not taste as was pretty full!

Gurer payesh ‚Äì with dry fruits - Could not taste as it was depleted and not refilled even after repeated requests!

Gurer Sandesh - Could not taste as it was depleted and not refilled even after repeated requests!

Strawberry mousse ‚Äì Somewhat toooooo creamy, but still, good on taste and exceptionally fresh!

Orange Mousse ‚Äì Could not taste

Overall, an exceptional experience, coupled with good service! Special thanks to attendants Tika and Pravin for their hard work in providing customer satisfaction, but the only thing I regret that the chefs need to increase their speed and serve stuff timely! Was somewhat unhappy with the veg starters being served after the main course had almost been eaten!

The above mammoth buffet comes with a modest price tag of Rs. 786 (AI) (MON TO THRS)

Rs. 896 (AI) (FRIDAY TO SUNDAY)

Rs. 999 (AI) (CHRISTMAS).

Nice zodiac themed restaurant! The interiors are well designed thereby maintaining the zodiac theme and give u the feel of fine dining!The candle-light dinner feel adds to it!!üòä

We decided to go for veg dinner buffet at this placeüôÇ!

Firstly , we were served a welcome platter with 4 types of tit-bits..representing earth, water, air and fire...then according to our zodiac sign we were served a card...which was also a discount coupon for our next visit!üòÄ

Then...5 types of starters...we were served chilly babycorn, spring rolls, paneer tikka,tandoori aloo, paneer shashlik! All the items tasted great...just loved paneer shashlik!With these , we were served the mocktail of the day i.e 'Aam panna'...this was simply refreshing!üòÉ

Then..we proceeded to main course...lavish spread which includes salad, soup, noodles , manchurian, biriyani, dal, gatte ki sabji, choice of bread!!All the items tasted good...live pasta counter was not there that day....baked pasta was served! The baked pasta was also equally delicious!

One of the best buffet serving restaurants that I have visited in Kolkata...
After searching on Google we voted to visit this restaurant opposite City Centre2. Firstly we were really amazed by the hospitality shown to us by all the floor staff in welcoming us, not just at the beginning but throughout our meal.
We we firstly served a small welcome drink...strawberry with fresh fruits and sweet toast.
For starters we were served crispy fried chicken which was well prepared and baby corn fried in honey and sweet.sauce which was excellent along with small potato balls nicely fried in bread crumbs . Next we got the peppery fish fried which was marinated so well that even the Basa fish tasted heavenly. Then the chicken tikka which we ate was very succulent and juicy and tasted just right...After several helping of these starters which were served to us along with one of the best made mocktails, Blue Lagoon served in a big mug we chose to go for the main course..
In the Main course we got a wide choice....of course all along during our meals our Hostess Soma was always checking on us and informing us about the dishes and taking our feedback for the same..
Chicken Soup which was served to us did not impress us much as it should have...
We started off with Lal Mas Mutton which was just superb along with butter naan fresh from the oven and took portions of corn and palak, assorted oriental veggies, fish in schezuan sauce, paneer in white sauce, chicken drumsticks in green curry along with plain rice and paneer pulao...
Salad counter was also well stocked with assorted pickles, khimchi, onion rings, carrot slices, plain curd and Raita..amazing variety....just enough to tickle your taste buds.
We finished of our meal with fresh fruits which were filled to the brim....water melons, sweet melons etc and dessert was served to us which included long and soft gulab jamuns filled with almond slivers, soft and sweet malpuas and finally chocolate@ brownie with butter scotch icecream in a big bowl....
Hats off to the executive Chef, the Management Team and the the entire staff for making our day. Its really one of best service restaurant in KOLKATA...
We have already bookmarked your restaurant 'XII Zodiac' as the must visit again regularly on our list...
Thank you all once again....

Food was excellent! Bato chingri and the mutton was fantastic... the Veg Biriyani needs a special mention as it was one of the best one I've had. 
The staff is very courteous and polite. They were ready to make alterations according to your taste and their personalisation is super!!!

Landed at this place for a saturday buffet lunch.. We got a welcome plate with titbits.. It was a nice touch.. The place was deserted but for the five of us.. The buffet comes with a refreshing drink served in mason jar and 5 starters served at the table. There was a nice array of salads, pickles etc. The startes were quite tasty. For mains there were indian and chinese dishes.. They tasted very nice. The dessert section had baked boondi, mung dal halwa, mango souffle, sandesh, balusahi, ice cream etc. Overall a nice place.

This is a zodiac themed restaurant and they tried to maintain the theme in their decor and food. With fun zodiac facts on the table, and personal cards featuring the diners zodiac, you do feel welcome. They also served a starter/ welcome dish comprising bite size dishes representing the four elements. The menu was a bit haphazard. We ordered the Indian kabab platter, which was comprised of tandoori aaloo, baby corn, broccoli, cauliflower and paneer. It was a good starter, enough for 4 to share. We tried the pesto pasta which was again a well prepared dish. We tried a kofta dish and dal makhani for main course. While the dishes were not bad, they weren't anything special either. The breads were good, warm and soft.
It's worth a visit.

Decent place for a cozy lunch or dinner. Tried their a la carte menu instead of the buffet. A bit slow on the service side. The zodiac twist is cool and the initial sampler too. The food is good but a tad bit on the expensive side. Tried their veg seekh kebab n noodles along with a cold coffee. The service could be a bit faster.

I was visited here for lunch buffet. 

Ambiance: Awasome look and ambiance. Neat and clean. Feel like 5 star restaurant. As a gift they give you you zodiac sign card.

Service: Awasome service by staff. Serve hot food. They serve staters for small duration of time. After that the trying to ignore you if you ask for it. I recieved it after finishing my main course.

Food: Not a great variety in staters. Only 3 non veg and 3 veg. Only the fish item was Awasome. Cheese ball and crispy baby corn in veg menu was good. Soup was nice. Main course variety was not good for non veg. Morton is well prepared  less spicy feel good but it can be better. You can get good tasted chicken salad there. Dessert was disappointing. Only 2 variety. One is normal sweet and another backed Bundi. You have to ask for Ice cream which have only 1 flavour I.e. Vanilla.

Overall experience was avarage. If you want to taste great food then don't try there as buffet.

There are change in menu based on day.

Starters were well served and the mocktail was so refreshing, I kept on sipping for that.
The concept of horoscopic selection of food items according to your sun sign was something that blew my mind. My zodiac sign was well depicted as it almost matched with me üòÑ

We went for buffet dinner where it has a series of menus from tandoori chicken and paneer to fish orli, and had live pasta counter as a part which I really liked.  Fish Florentine was really good along with the Biriyani. The dessert menu was also good with brownies and baked rasogolla. 
What I really liked was the zodiac concept in there and the welcoming Drinks and sweets tallying with the five elements we have. 
Lovely behaviour of staff. 
Would love to go again. 
Decor is also lovely.

The Best Hospitality Ever Experienced till date. All the staffs were extremely well behaved and polite. There were around 5 people who were serving and everyone was too keen to look for our comfort and feedback. Had a life time best experience ever for Hospitality.

The ambience was excellent but music selection was not that much good.

We had Non-veg buffet, the presentation was pretty good. Had 5 starters which include 2 Fish items and 3 Chicken items. I must admit I have the best experience of fish items ever, also in main course. Though in starter I didn't liked the Chicken Sekh Kabab but other item was good, specially Chicken Tikka was awesome. Had the best mocktaik, Mojito. Has good number of varieties in salad counter. Main course was also excellent specially Gosht Pulao, Fish with Orange preparation and Chicken Achari. Everything was very well cooked. Pretty good varieties of desserts, every item was so yummylicious. Also had vanilla ice-cream with hot chocolate and the the ice-cream was so perfect.

In short had an awesome time here and must visit for foodies.

As the name goes XII Zodiac, the place was filled with many (fun) facts related to different sun signs. Also got a 15% off on A La Carte for the next visit within 20 days. Everything was so unique really loved the place.

I will surely visit in near future again.

Awesome place to have a candle light dinner..

I just got a surprise treat here from my best friend on my birthday. He took me to this place with my eyes covered with scarf and arranged the table with gifts,cards,chocolates,candles and cakes. That first sight when my eyes were uncovered was amazing. It was 6.30pm then and only our table was occupied. We cut the cake and offered cake slices to the staffs there. They also greeted me and gave a token from their side. The staffs were all polite and co-operative in nature.
After 7.15 onwards we started ordering..
Before we ordered something, they gave us a complimentary dish which includes 4 things. They said that this dish represents the theme of the restaurant and those 4 items represent 4 things of nature - Fire, Air, Water and Earth.

We ordered Barbeque Chicken in oyster sauce as starter. ( though it was not boneless, but as per our request they served it boneless, thanks :) )

In main course, we ordered Pan fried chicken noodles which we expected to be something like spicy and mixed with pan fried sauce, but it turned out to be like boiled noodles mixed with boiled chicken.

As dessert, we ordered cold coffee with ice cream and chocolate mousse. Both were fantastic as expected.

I would like to visit the place again because of the great ambience it has.

2) Visited 2nd time....this time for breakfast buffet...breakfast buffet is not that good to taste...still i would say thank you to nearbuy.com as i was having cashback from them....taste of food in breakfast buffet can be improved...

Awesome place to have a candle light dinner..

I just got a surprise treat here from my best friend on my birthday. He took me to this place with my eyes covered with scarf and arranged the table with gifts,cards,chocolates,candles and cakes. That first sight when my eyes were uncovered was amazing. It was 6.30pm then and only our table was occupied. We cut the cake and offered cake slices to the staffs there. They also greeted me and gave a token from their side. The staffs were all polite and co-operative in nature.
After 7.15 onwards we started ordering..
Before we ordered something, they gave us a complimentary dish which includes 4 things. They said that this dish represents the theme of the restaurant and those 4 items represent 4 things of nature - Fire, Air, Water and Earth.

We ordered Barbeque Chicken in oyster sauce as starter. ( though it was not boneless, but as per our request they served it boneless, thanks :) )

In main course, we ordered Pan fried chicken noodles which we expected to be something like spicy and mixed with pan fried sauce, but it turned out to be like boiled noodles mixed with boiled chicken.

As dessert, we ordered cold coffee with ice cream and chocolate mousse. Both were fantastic as expected.

I would like to visit the place again because of the great ambience it has.

A very fine buffet place. From ambience to food and service everything was upto our expectations. You don't need to wait in a long queue to get food just unlike barbeque or flame and grill. It's still lesser known to people so you can enjoy your food in a calm and comfortable atmosphere.They have ample of options in starter,main course and dessert along with chaats. I personally liked their mug daal and basmati rice a lot. The staffs are very courteous and sweet . They literally request you try every item. A very pleasant experience. Definitely looking for a re-visit.
Tip:We used a little app coupon and the total amount was 686 per head including all taxes.

A zodiac themed restaurant is first of its kind. Located near City Center 2 area inside The Fern Residency Hotel. Window side seats have panoramic view of Biswa Bangla Sarani and with glimpse flights taking off from nearby international airport.¬†
Majorly guest prefers their affordable buffet but we preferred to go for ala carte. At starters we opted for Murg Tikka Mirza Hasnu, Tandoori Mahi Tikka and Murgh Dilnashi Kebab.¬†
Murgh Dilnashi Kebab is minced chicken patty filled with cheddar cheese served pan grilled.
Tandoori Mahi Tikka is bhetki fillet marinated in red chili and yogurt served post roasting inside tandoor. Murgh Tikka Mirza Hasnu is boneless chicken thigh marinated in yellow chili powder and yogurt cooked inside tandoor. All the kebabs were so yummilicious and melted inside our mouth.
In a mughlai menu we will never ignore biriyanis and here also no exception. Being finicky about right tasted biriyani we were quite skeptical to try biriyani. But ended up ordering Pardewali Chicken Biriyani along with side dish Murgh Kaligolmirch.¬†
The biriyani was slow cooked inside naan envelope to retain its flavour in every grain. The biriyani left us awestruck with its taste still fresh in our memory. One of the best biriyanis tasted in recent past is a must try.¬†
Murgh Kaligolmirch was also the unsung hero in the pallet, a perfect balance of taste and zing of black pepper.
The only thing was bothering was the time they took to prepare and serve. Still the servers were extremely courteous and kept us sending various accompaniments on the table. But the wait worth it considering the taste. Price is on the higher side. Valet parking is available.

This is situated close to city centre 2 and beside Tamara. The ambience is tranquil . The waiters are polite. Service is a tad slow. Coming to the food, we had their dinner buffet. The starters are served at the table. Starters were few items but all of them tasted delicious. The main course consists of the usual varieties . All the items were good to taste and the presentation was nice. Dessert section has quite a few options all of which were delicious. One of the best buffets available in the city. Will love to visit again.

I have been there twice, both times with my office colleagues(in a group of 15 or 16 members), and came out with a smile. We had bought Nearbuy coupons for Lunch Buffet and so it felt like a steal deal! The ambiance, staff and the decor was top notch. The seating is comfortable. ¬†I like the way they serve the 5 elements' platter in the beginning. Keeping in sync with their name, they give you your zodiac cards with some offer which can be used on y our next visit. The effort and the thought is super. Coming to the food - the spread is quite good and the variety is interesting. I liked the starters very much and the main course was also up to the mark. I am not giving a perfect 5 because I feel they should add more variety to their desserts and also because I did not like the syrupy taste in the Aampanna that was served as the welcome drink.¬†

Kudos!!! Will surely visit again!

Could you be floored by a restaurant just by its ambiance? Evidently yes , if you visit XII (12) zodiac in fern hotel Rajarhat. At the onset let me clarify that we went in with diminished appetites , returning from a bijoya visit. 
This tiny boutique hotel in Rajarhat is a Linda Goodman fan's fantasy and  the first zodiac themed restaurant around Kolkata. The lobbey I'd the first indication of how tastefully furnished the interiors are. We were welcomed by the gracious hostess and promptly seated in plush chairs. This being a weeknight place was sparse. As soon as we were seated we recieved a platter of amuse-bouche with 4 items representative of the 4 elements. A tangy orange juice for water , a cheese straw for fire , paprir chat for earth and a cheese watermelon stick for air, I think I have got them matched correctly. Individually none of them were exceptional but together easy on the palette and loved the effort. 
We ordered two starters and a fresh lime and weren't dissatisfied. The Oriental style fish was excellent and the tandoori murg was good but the pieces were so big that the spices hadn't seeped into the meat. One thing I have to give them is the quantity is huge .we had to skip to an ice cream dessert after this.
This place is definitely a conversation starter and wether you believe in sun signs or not , it's entertaining to discuss the sign compatible menu. I am libra married to a Virgo and none of the food traits matched either of us. But hey we had a good time so no complains here!

I threw my delayed b'day bash here. Took my friends out on this cloudy afternoon. Thought the ambeince inside would not match the outside weather but it did. The service was even more appreciable.

Food was nice on every axis you could imagine for, its taste, its presentation, its quality, its quantity. By the way, there was a great help from our service in choosing the dishes. Really liked it.

Was also with Kumar Sourav and Kajal Agarwal. Couldn't tag them.

The first thing that you would like definitely has to be restaurant ambiance and decor. The dim and smooth lights along with the soothing music are just fantastic and. They light up small floating candles that just sets the mood.

The menu is well spread with a variety of items. The staff, very courteous and helpful. From taking us to our table to providing the bill, a constant and friendly smile on the face is just loving.

They start with a plate of appetizer based on the four elements of the zodiac. The food is just sumptuous and the staff would happily help you for every serving.

Overall, a very pleasing experience and I would definitely visit again to taste their buffet spread.

Ashtami buffet. Almost all restaurant in Kolkata was serving Bengali buffet spread...XII zodiac was no different apart from the fact that their menu was a bit eclectic in the sense that it consisted of quirky yet homely dishes which individually may seem mundane but together is a great combo. The starters of khashir meter chop and aamer chop we're the heroes. Meter chop being the Megastar! Kashmiri chop and dimer devil...not at all devilish.
Salad counters displayed elaborate variety with doing bara, peyara kadundi,aloo chhola, any regular items but lacked a nonveg touch.
Main course of radhaballbhi, aloo dum... though not innovative is always a favorite. Plain rice, delectable shukto and panchrakam bhaja gave the sense of warmth and homelyness. Chhanarmohima and kaanchkalar kopta failed to do justice...as is the loti chingri...I love my loti to be dry and hot...this was watery and lacked the fire. Chingri was not seen, the chef was miserly about the shrimps...shorshe katla...ok, murgh biryani and dim kasha I avoided...why, because I could not resist the mutton stew which was the dish of the day. Soft pieces of meat barely holding on to the bones in a very fragrant lightly spiced stew with baby potato and peas...paired with steamed rice ..simply divine...
I ended my culinary sojiurn at zodiac with a very well made langcha and chocolate ice cream...followed by paan....
The stewerds we're all dressed in bengali puja attire...and they were very courteous....

Went there yesterday on Saptami and they informed us that only Bengali cuisine buffet is available.

They started serving with ghol, followed by two non-veg starters (chicken and fish) and three veg starters. After that, in the main course they had Chicken Biryani, Baked Keema Kosha Mangso(mutton), Katla¬†Mach er Kalia, Dim er Kosha. The other items were veg items such as Doi Potol, Sukto etc. For desserts ,¬†they had Misti doi, Pantua, Amsotto¬†wrap, Ice cream and Sondesh.

Now coming to the part of why I gave this rating. The cost per person is around Rs 900 with tax so it isn't really cheap and just on the basis of that, the non-veg items were too few. Only two non-veg starters.
For main course, they had only one chicken item that too Chicken biryani. The Baked Keema Kosha Mutton tasted very good but it had too many bones. Dim er kosha also tasked okay but nothing exceptional. They had only one prawn item, Lau Chingri which was a bit disappointing for me since I like prawn but not with Lau.
Desserts were okay too but the Misti Doi wasn't to my liking. They had Papad next to the desserts and it was not crunchy since it's been kept out in the open for a long time.

So overall it was a disappointing visit considering the cost of the meal.

We went to have Bengali Buffet today which was hosted in there Zenith Hall. The ambience was good and staffs were too friendly. 
Firstly we were served with a welcome drink (Doi Ghol) accompanied with starters which had veg chops and mutton chops. 
Next was the time to taste the buffet dishes. Most of them was superb tasty. We were also served hot luchis (Puri) which was great. 
The hall was decorated in a manner as we have seen in award functions. Big round tables beautifully decorated but the chairs was not that comfy. Except that everything was great !!

XII Zodiac is a 3 Star Casual Dine restaurant located at the 1st floor of The Fern Residency Hotel. They have presented a whole new Bengali style menu in a very well manner specially for this Durga Puja.¬†

Soft music, decent modern dining with a simple touch of Durga Puja for this special season is perfect for a romantic evening and classic for family lunch. Their walls says stories of your taste style depending upon on your Zodiac sign. Its something that will not bore you.

We #MunchingMonks have been invited by the Management to experience the First Look of the Special Puja menu which will surely delight you with delicious taste. Thanks to Mr. Mridul Das for the invitation! Thanks chef Mr. Hiran Paul for the wonderful spread of Special Puja Menu.

All started with Doi Ghol that was very balanced in salt and sweetness. Well this is something every other place doesn‚Äôt start the game with. A single glass was enough for quench.

Then in Salad section lots of options were available but some of the rare and worth mentioning items were Kochu Batta and Kharkol Pata Batta. Both the items gave a complete different taste and feel. Also Green Salad, Aloo Chola Makha, Peyara Kasundi Makha and Papor Bhaja was present to change the taste.

Now coming to Mains‚Ä¶
The whole menu covers a lot. But the below are some of the main interest.

Sada Bhat and Luchi:
----------------------------
Well cooked rice was present to match every other dish they offer. Nice thing was there was Luchi too as another option.

Shukto (4/5):
----------------
Their Shukto was sweet and creamy just like every other place I‚Äôve tried in Bengali Menus. The taste of the vegetables were almost hidden and that is what most people like. It tasted excellent with plane rice.

Sorse Katla (4.25/5) :
------------------------
Okey, Here is the twist. Every other restaurant is focusing on Ilish, but they knew it well that Katla is Bengali‚Äôs second love. So, they made it with the perfection so that you will not miss Ilish in this menu. Rich mustard taste with the big pieces of fish, perfectly cooked with Bengali‚Äôs favourite spices made it tasted just excellent when we mixed it with plain rice.

Kosa Mangsho (4/5) :
------------------------
A dish without Bengali thali doesn‚Äôt complete with. Kosha Mangso looked & taste delicious every time with just plain Rice or even better with Luchi. It was rich and red in colour but Chicken pieces could have been a little softer.

Desserts (4.25/5) :
----------------------
Their desserts section was very basic with Fresh Cut Fruits, Bhapa Sandesh, Golap Jam and Misti Doi. Bhapa Sandesh tasted like sugar free sandesh that will suit most of the older people visiting here. But I just couldn‚Äôt stop myself from falling in love with their Hot served Golap Jam. It was just melting in the mouth with hotness and sweet flavour of it. Their Hot Golap Jam tasted amazing and that only fulfils the whole menu. Misti Doi served in a clay pot was definitely interesting but taste could have been little better.

Pricing :
-----------------
It is kept quite simple at Rs. 899. Also you can find special deals on Nearbuy or Little.

Conclusion :¬†
-----------------
All said XII Zodiac is a decent place to start or end the Puja with their Bengali buffet options. So what does your Zodiac sign says this Puja? For me its all good food‚Ä¶

The restaurant‚Äôs theme is on the zodiac signs as suggested by the name. ¬†The food is extremely well presented. It is more a feast to the eyes than the tongue. Their drama like presentation makes you await the next course. Contrary to common belief there is no problem for vegetarians and food is more than enough to fill your stomach.

Visited this awesome place yesterday with my Office Colleagues for a Team Lunch. After a lot of discussion among us we decided to try something new this time. We ordered the buffet menu.

Coming to the menu, It is delicious and is of great quality which surprised me very much.
Starters: In the Starters we were served fish fry, crispy Chili baby corn, Chili pepper fish, Paneer tikka, Chicken tikka and Cheese balls with a dip and green chutney. There was also complimentary drink blue lagoon. The Fish Fry and Chili Pepper Fish were very soft and crispy. Haven't had such a delicious fish delicacy since long time. Even the Paneer tikka is of great taste. Only thing that could be improved is the chicken tikka, With bones chicken tikka was not up to the mark.¬†

Main Course: In the main course they had, Rice, Moong Dal, Naan/Roti, Rosogolla Dalna (which is something unique), Aloo phoolkopir torkari (Traditional Bengali Veg delicacy made with potato and cauliflower), Posto Chicken, Hot and Garlic Fish, Stir Fried Vegetable, Veg Noodles and Mutton Kasha. All the items were of great taste and visually it also looked good. There were different types of salad which were displayed and decorated beautifully.¬†

Deserts: Coming to deserts, they had Payesh (Traditional Bengali Sweet) which was cooked in a proper manner and had the exact taste which it needs, Rasgulla, Gulab jamun, Brownie and Mixed Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream. All the items are of great taste.

Overall it was a great experience. The ambiance was awesome and well decorated. The staff was also courteous enough. Although they didnt have a wide variety of food menu but whatever they had was of great quality and will suffice to fulfill your appetite.

One fine rainy morning me and my friend decided to take a break and we decided to visit this place. It's situated near city centre 2 . The place is actually a house restaurant to the fern residency. This place is a themed restaurant .. from name that is quite evident.
They have a menu having different zodiac sign choices.üòäüòä
The interior has a soft green ambience. The attendants were so professional and warm. We opted for buffet.
First thing they served was a dish containing four things representative of four elements of nature.. air( I couldn't identify the thing.. but it was delicious),earth(fruit salad)water(a fine red drink),fire(grilled meat).
Then they gave us a welcome drink which was complimentary.. a virgin mojito.
The buffet was well presented and it was not overt for your appetite. It was nice experience.
Ambience-5/5
Food-5/5
Service-5/5
Nothing to complain about. One must try this restaurant for the unique experience of food based on their sunshine.üòãüòã

Visited this place with my ofc colleagues today ....my ofc being situated in sectorV, we were tired of visiting the same old place everytime which is either Barbq or chaibreak ,etc, so decided to visit a new place ( not visited before) ... so chose this place .... though this restuarant is situated very close to where i live :)

Now coming to food ... we chose for buffet ... 

MENU in BUFFET :

In starters we were served  fish fry, crispy chilli baby corn,chilli pepper fish, paneer tikka and chicken tikka with a dip and green chutney ... there was a complimentary blue lagoon too .... the pepper fish and fish fry were great ... very soft .... ¬†being a hardcore nonveg lover, i even liked the paneer tikka ....

They had several types of salads kept and garnished in a nice looking manner for u to choose from .... though i didn't fall into that trap of filling my stomach with salads instead of the real stuff ;)

In the main course they had plain rice, veg noodles, posto chicken , dal , stir fried vegetables, some fish item in gravy(forgot the exact name) ..etc ......... Mutton was served on the table though ....

In desserts, there was payesh, brownie, icecream , rasgulla, gulab jamun,etc .... payesh had the exact amount of sweetness required (i.e not excessively sweet) ... i had 5 plates of it :) .... even the icecream (vanilla and chocolate mixed) tasted nice ....

Their menu doesn't remain constant everyday ... they come up with slight variations as i confirmed with some of my frndz ...

To sum up, their main USP i would say is TASTE .... though u wont find many varieties of food ...but whatever u get, u wont be disappointed in taste .... Varietywise, may be they can at least include biriyani along with the plain rice ..thats my personal suggestion though ....

One issue was the SERVING TIME for starters ..!! we really had to wait a looongg time for every item ....¬†
Ambience was nice ..... the whole restuarant is not very huge in space .....but is not congested too ...and is nicely decorated .....

Amazing new find. It's a hidden gem. We usually go to the nearby Tamara hotel for our dinners or lunches, but XII zodiac made its place in our to be list. It has great buffet spreads with lip smacking starters, both veg and non veg. They serve complimentary virgin mojito. The main course is also too good, only if you've enough space left after the starters. They'd a live pasta counter, a huge dessert spread, veg noodle soup to go by and atleast 10 types of accompaniments. It was indeed a great time spent. Oh yes, the staff is very polite and courteous and are on their toes to help you out with anything. Highly recommended.

Atlast visited yesterday in this place.  It's located beside chinar park RE(Royal Enfield)  showroom.  

1. Yesterday was a special day for me and I have already reserved a seat for there lunch buffet and I reached that place too late.  We reached that place at 3:15pm where there lunch buffet was ended at 3:30 and they wouldn't allow anyone after 2:45/3pm. But already I have mentioned that yesterday was special so they understand it and allow me to enter in there place.  

2. They told us be comfortable and take our time to have our buffet.  And the table was nicely decorated with BALLOONS. They helful and kindness behavior amaze us a lot.  

3. Each and every staff are speak very politely. always show the etiquette  to there customers and always take care there customers and before.. 

4.  Come to there buffets menu. It's a huge number of dishes are available in there starters and main course. 

5. What a lovely environment with a very unique color of luxurious seats and tables.  

PS -  I have already heard lots of complement about this place, yesterday I have faced it.  It's a nice place with a lovely food, well decorated and the unique thing which is attract me that if they want they could 'not allowed'  us to entered that time when we reached because it's to late.  But they didn't do that also they understand my problem and they didn't spoil my special day.  

Thanks a lot XII ZODIAC for your lovely services you have provided made my yesterday more special.  I took a right decision to visit your place and never regret about it. Thanks a lot guys.  

We couldn't take too much pictures of there place and foods because we were busy to ate our foods and there staff behavior and place is amaze us.

XII Zodiac, the in house dining of the Fern Residency in Rajathat is fast turning to become one of the top buffet place in Kolkata. I had a visit earlier, and the experience was quite good and at par with leading buffet offerings. In the upcoming puja, Zodiac has planned for a gala Bengali buffet offering at a quite affordable price. 

Thanks to Tanmay Basak and Team Munching Monks I was invited to the press release & Bengali buffet trial yesterday. A special thanks goes to Mridul Das. 

The pujo special lunch/dinner buffet, full of Bengali delicasies will be cost at Rs 899 inclusive all. 

The buffet begins with Ghol, which makes the whole thing so perfect. The Ghol was so exact dense and so aromatic with Gandharaj Lemon flavor you can't stop taking it more than once. 

Following that traditional Bengali cuisines are ready for you - lunch, kumro chokka, sada bhat, sukto, mug dal, Chhanar dalna, Kharkol pata bata, Pui Shag, Lal shag, Kalmi shag, Kochu pata bata, salads, Sorshe Katla, Bengali Chicken curry. That was served to us, but the menu will be extended at little bit. Best part of this buffet offering is serving extra ordinary Bangla rannas (=dishes)

Dessert section is short and simple - fruits, sugar free sandesh, hot gulab jamun, Misti doi and ice cream.

Overall XII Zodiac offers a great value for money puja buffet this year. 
¬†

Ambience 5/5, Decor 5/5, Service - prompt and gesture helpful, Food 4-4.5/5

Sorry for the late review...wait, you don't know that! Anywho, went there last month, at night as a third wheel with my brother and his fiance! I had my doubts about the menu, because before this, Flame n Grill and Barbque nation were the only Buffets I went to. However, I must say, this one was superb! The ambience, the food quality and the service (by three lovely ladies) were top notch; especially the Food quality!

Pros: 
- Ambience
- Service
- Food quality
- Not Like the Buffet Pro Restaurants (what?) but enough choice of dishes

Cons:
- The only thing pulling this one back from the big Buffet dealers is that some of the starters (though Finger lickin good) is tad little bid over the top Oily. This limits your intake of these food items.

I would suggest everyone to try this at least once! :)

A wonderfull sunday spent with family.. initially we were having doubts whether food will be worth of its cost or not. We opted for buffet (non veg).¬†
Talking about the Food :¬†
At first, they served us 5types of starters along with a welcome platter and a mocktail (which was just perfect to clear all our doubts regarding the 2nd thoughts we were having!!! ) Starters were as delicious as they looked. Then we went for main course which had lots of options like steemed rice,noodles, pasta, fish in garlic sauce,2 different dishes of chicken, bhuna gosht, aloo gobhi, shahi paneer,dal tadka etc. The food was just amazing..but as I was grabbing up the main course items, I had a constant eye on desserts. I just have more cravings for desserts and they served brownies..who will not crave?!! Brownies, rasmalai , baked rosogollas, langcha,mousse, icecreams etc.. Desserts were too good!
Ambience:¬†
XII Zodiac is very near to CC2. Its located in Chinar Park. Since its a part of Fern Residency hotel, the restaurant area is not that big if you compare it with some prime restaurants. But the ambience and decor was just enough to enlighten your mood and make it a perfect place to capture memories with your dear ones.
Staff:
The staff were very cooperative. A special thanks to Tika, she guided us very well. Overall, very good hospitality.

As they say, a well spent sunday brings a week of content. I loved it. Will go there again...¬†
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

They also provided us with a strawberry shot, papri chat, grape and paneer on a decorated plate which implies the four forces in nature. 
In the main course they had rice, veg noodles, chicken chaanp, dhoka dalna, dal amritsari, fish bhapa, paneer. They serve mutton on the table.

Are you a fan of finger food & street food but too scared to taste due to its hygiene???

This restaurant has the solution. It has brought street food from  Kolkata to Mumbai to Gujarat under one  roof!!!

Street Food festival named 'Khao Galli' has brought the Panch Phoron members here. Street food from different areas of India has been brought together to be served.

The restaurant is located at Rajarhat, city center 2 near Chinar park on 2nd floor. I was tripped over by their ambience. A soothing decor and breath taking ambience perfect for a romantic candle light dinner for couples.

And the street food we were served -

1. Bhel Puri - A savoury snack & a type of chaat. It's made up of puffed rice, vegetables & tangy tamarind sauce. It's often identified with the beaches of Mumbai. Though the recipe has spread to most parts of India.

2. Dabeli - Also known as Kutchi dabeli or double roti. It's a snack food originating from Kutch region of Gujarat. A spicy snack made by mixing boiled potatoes with a dabeli masala & putting the mixture in between the pavs or burger buns and served with chutneys made from tamarind, date, garlic, red chillies etc. And garnished with pomegranate & roasted peanuts.

3. Mixed Chaat - Every bite of this delicious mixed Chaat is sure to tingle all your taste buds and also fill you up with the goodness of moong sprouts, chana, vegetables. A crunchy protein rich snack made with sprouted whole green gram, boiled potatoes, boiled and cubed colocassia, tomato, cucumber, coriander etc. & Mixed with curd and served with tangy tamarind sauce and bhujia.

4. Chandannagar special Chicken Pakoda - A famous shop at Chandannagar named Bolai which is famous for this Chicken Pakoda. Crispy and tasty chicken Pakoda is served with salad and spicy red chilli chutney.

5. Alia special Paratha & mutton stew - Crunchy multi layered lachha paratha is quite appetizing with the lucsious curry. And gorging on the succulent pieces of mutton is worth relishing. 

6. Loita chingri Cutlet - Bombay duck & prawns are mixed with spices and then given a diamond shape and then deep fried. This crispy delicious cutlet is a perfect evening snack.

7. Dhabe wali Lasooni Tangri - Chicken leg pieces marinated with hung yoghurt, ginger garlic paste, lemon juice, garam masala & then baked well. The scrumptious tangri was served with salad.

8. Tangra special chicken Cha chow - Mouth watering chicken drumsticks are served with chowmein and red chilli sauce.

9. Litchi Rasmalai - Cream milk,cardamom,saffron are boiled together and then the litchis are stuffed with khoya, raisins and pistachios. The stuffed litchis are then mixed and boiled with milk mixture & served with pistachios and saffron on top of it. It makes a flavourful dessert indeed.

Don't miss the chance!!!! Hurry up!!!!

I went to this place to celebrate my birthday and believe me I couldn't get a better place than this to celebrate the occasion. We had pre-booked our table. A special mention is needed of the woman who took care of us throughout. Her name is Tika. Thanks to her for making my birthday so special. They arranged for a surprise cake for me! And they also told the Singer who was performing live tonight to wish me musically. Everybody was singing along with him to wish me. I felt so special! Thank you team Zodiac for everything. Now coming to the food part, we opted for the buffet. Some of the starters were too good. Though I didn't like the main course too much. The dessert section was alright. The main plus point of this place is the courteous nature of the staffs. I would definitely recommend this place. The ambience is very romantic. üòÉüòä

What is the first thing that comes to your mind when I say Bombay (not Mumbai), Delhi?Apart from the metro cities thing. Yes!! the most scrumptious and mouthwatering destinations for street food. Now add Kolkata to that list. Sounds like heaven doesn‚Äôt it foodies? However appealing the list might sound, traversing such a distance just for the food in a day, is a daunting task for any foodie. But what if I tell you, you get to choose from an array of delectable items right exactly similar to the ones from streets of Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, all under one roof‚Ä¶.. Yess!! I know absolute FOODGASM!!
                                                                ...

Zodiac is offering you all your favorite STREET FOOD. 
Starting from Puchka to Mutton Stew. From Mumbai to Delhi, all you'll get itt here in Kolkata.
Me with my foodie friends and team Panch Phoron were invited to taste their KHAO GALI food menu.

Trust me you'll love it. I became so happy when I tasted DAVELI which I used to have in Andheri Station. And the Loita Chingri Cutlet will win your heart.

So there's no second thought please go and enjoy India's STREET FOOD here in XII-ZODIAC only.

The Xll Zodiac fern residency is very popular chain of hotels and it doesn't disappoint you. It's situation at the opposite of city centre 2. Went there to have their breakfast buffet using little app deal of Rs 246 only. They had Beetroot juice,lichi juice,watermelon juice,fruits,breads including brown and white with jam or butter spread, cupcakes, chicken sausage, mashed and grilled potatoes, dosa, idli, puri, chana dal, boiled egg, omelette, sweets and a few things. 
The staff was very friendly with amazing ambience. A decent experience with pocket pinch of just 250 per person only.

This place is in my visit list since long as it is very close to my home. Finally on Friday 28th July 2017 we visited this place for dinner buffet. This place is near chinar park and beside pipal üå≤ restaurant. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor of the building.The thing which I like about this place is they serve food based on your zodiac sign. The name 12 zodiac justified. The dine in place was full with staffs and one family,by the time we reached. The food boasts with 5veg (potato balls, paneer, babycorn) and 5nonveg (fish, chicken)starter. I love the chilli fish among all the starters. Further we were served the hot and sour nonveg soup. It was ok. Then without wasting any time I moved toward the spread table. In main course again the fish with herbal spice is a top notch. I took 2 price of chicken and mutton roganjosh with butter naan. The mutton seems like  5-7 mins less cooked. The chicken was good. Then I took butterscotch bite and some cup cakes in desert. It was a nice dine in experience at zodiac.Last but not the least the mojito accompanied with the food was a great idea.

Located in the 2nd floor of The Fern Residency near City Centre 2, this is a hidden treasure for all foodies. A warm welcome with a valet parking service sets the tone of your visit. As the name suggests its themed on Zodiac signs. The waiter will note your sunsigns and provide you a complimentary 15% discount on ala carte menu on your next visit. A complimentary dish with food symbolizing the basic 4 elements (water, earth, wind and fire) is served with a mind soothing mocktail. 5 Veg and 5 Non veg starters followed by a lavish buffet and some wonderful desserts will keep you busy for the next hour or so. Prawn was missing in the menu and one mutton dish is in main course. Fish and chicken ruled the non veg section. Considering the pocket friendly buffet price its worth a visit.

Very low standards 
Please don't go as per the reviews. I saw many 4++ rated reviews and thought of going to this place , but this place is so terrible, i would never ever want to come here again.  We left most of the food, it was stale. The ambience was so boring and staff was just not ready to tackle even a moderate crowd. The vinegar onion, was so stale that if i had eaten it all, i would have landed in Apollo Gleneagles Hospital right after. When I reported this, the staff apologized in a disgusting manner . As it was Mr. Goenka's restaurant , i thought the standards would be maintained, but it wasn't! Dal and pasta were just okay. Rest was not worth paying for. We paid 3700, for something really bad. Even though I had mentioned this in the review card which the staff gave to me , and the staff and apologized , i would want this to be taken care off!!

XII Zodiac is a must visit for all who love quality over quantity. Starting from the ambience created by the candles on the table and personal attention from most of the staffs really made my dinner memorable. 5 veg & 5 non veg starters were really tasty and of good quality. However, prawns could have been added to the starter. Coming to the main course, I must say that this place is the best in town. The quality of the 4 Non veg main course was too good, specially the mutton curry would not let you forget the place very soon. Chicken & Fish items were also noteworthy. Live Pasta counter will surely satisfy your taste buds to the fullest. Lastly, the deserts were also fantastic with unmatched quality.
I recommend this restaurant to all the foodies in town.

The idea of this restaurant is innovative. One can choose food as per his or her zodiac, as every zodiac sign has its own customized separate menu. If u r not interested in ordering from ala cart thn have liberty to go for buffet too.  We went there for lunch nd the buffet was very disappointing. However there is one interesting part before the start of the buffet is that they serve  five items in a plate based on 5 elements, which i liked rest not so happening. 
 The ambiance was good, staffs were good enough but food was disappointment.

We went in for a buffet offer.
The decor is nice. But the entire restaurant was empty. The staff were wandering aimlessly. Service was satisfactory.The variety was impressive, but the taste wasn't as good. Few starters were good. However, the main course failed to please the taste buds. The mutton and chicken curries were overdone, the Biryani tasted horrible. The naan was okay. The dessert options were too less and average. The regular strawberry ice-cream was the only solace.The per-head price didn't feel justified given the shabby dinner we had.

I tried out bang bang chicken and fish in green garlic sauce primarily. It was well cooked and tasty, not much spices added to it. I had a good experience overall. Looking forward to explore more dishes out here.

Located in the first floor of Fern residency hotel, near CC2 Rajarhat, The restaurant XII Zodiac is a very different kind of restaurant than the others‚Ä¶ 
It is Kolkata‚Äôs first and most probably the only one zodiac based restaurant 
The theme and decoration is so different and it‚Äôs awesome!!¬† The executives are very friendly and courteous‚Ä¶ Overall the ambiance is very soothing ‚Ä¶I Went there as a member of Panchphoron to taste some mouth-watering dishes of Fish‚Ä¶
Rice and fish always plays a dominant role in a Bengali‚Äôs thaali  ‚Ä¶¬† Varieties of fish like hilsa, katla, pabda, tangra, koi, pomfret and bhetki‚Ä¶ Without ‚ÄúMaach-Bhaat‚Äù the concept of Bengali culture is incomplete  ‚Ä¶. 
They served us some delicious dishes of Fish ‚Ä¶
Let‚Äôs come to the food  ‚Ä¶Dishes they served to us are‚Ä¶
1) ILISH Malai Curry
2) Lao A Bhapa ILISH
3) Andhra Pomfret Fry 
4) Loita Chingri Jhur Jhure
5) Pabda Sorshe Jhal 
6) Tyangra Maach er Tok 

This festival is from 14th July ‚Äì 23rd July. 
These are available for lunch and dinner only‚Ä¶ o, why waiting? Go to XII ZODIAC and give your tongue the pleasure of tasting these amazing dishes!! ¬† Tank you Rajdeep Bhattacharjee for inviting us!

I had my friend's birthday party at this place and this place was really awesome. 

Ambiance: Although there was nothing special about the appearance but the place was neat and well arranged. The dim yellow lighting  was perfect for this place. I can feel the classiness flowing through.

Staff and Services: I had a very little interaction with them since we opted buffet. They helped us whenever we needed it. It was nice actually.

Food: We had buffet. They have so many items in the menu that you will be full just by tasting them all.
 Though I don't remember the details of what I ate  but I can assure you that everything was very delicious. Panner pakora and fish were too good. We also enjoyed the baked rosgulla. Our dinner ended with Ice-cream, brownie and moose. ¬† ¬†

Cost: Well, it will cost you around 1200-1300 bucks but i will recommend buffet. They really offer the quality for what they charging you.

Verdict: I thoroughly enjoyed my evening. We ate like hungry animals (though we were well mannered). I like the place. Bring your family, have a team lunch or come on a date; this place is perfect. Will visit this place soon. Kudos!!

It‚Äôs known to all that Bengalis and fish are almost synonymous as no bengali meal will ever be complete without a preparation of fish being served. The number of fishes consumed in a typical bengali household and the number of preparations the ladies are adept at making with each fish is quite amazing. Keeping in mind the advent of monsoon season and the craving for the coveted Ilish, XII Zodiac housed in the 2nd floor of The Fern Rsedency brings to you Macche Matowara- a fish festival which presents not only different preparations of freshwater fishes but also of salt water fishes. Apart from serving one of the finest buffets in town this place is spacious and the ambience boasts of a classy decor with a Sun-sign theme complete with placards and cards bearing the name of each of the zodiac signs. Even their menu is designed based on the likes and dislikes of different personalities with different Sun-signs. Team PanchPhoron was invited for tasting the items.

Went for a team lunch with vouchers from Nearbuy. Lovely ambiance, polite staff and a bright seating place.
We had opted for buffet, and they served the starters at our table (veg + non-veg). The main course was limited but had both Indian and Chinese. The dal was excellent and so was the Chinese veg (I forgot the name of the dish)! I stayed away from the desert, but my friends liked what was offered. The welcome drink (I think blue lagoon) was served in mason jars :) Plus, they had also given us aam panna in the beginning.
It is definitely a bit on the expensive side (unless you have vouchers), but I would like to take my family there some day.

Bengali food habits , taste , preferences and choice of items vary with different districts, communities and religions. The basic course generally remains the same with Rice and Fish . Probably this is why a Bengali is often typified as a ‚Äù Maache- Bhaate- Bangali‚Äù where Maach means fish and Bhaat means boiled rice in Bengali.
                                                                ...

Located close to City centre 2,Rajarhat in the first floor of Fern residency hotel.
Zodiac theme based interiors,and plush decor- all add up to the ambience. They explain the theme based on earth,air , fire and water signs,and you are handed an a-la-carte discount coupon based on your sunsign.

We opted for the dinner buffet,and the hospitality was beyond words altogether. A candlelight dinner,as u overlook the busy cityscape from the windows.
Their buffet had a lavish spread,and everything tasted great. They only need to improve on the dessert section, where the choices are very less.
Highly recommended.

Good food, courteous staff and value for money. We went there for a buffet. Welcome drink was refreshing. It was Lemonade mixed with soda and mint leaf. Starters were good. Liked the fish preparation‚Äã. Main course was good too, though mutton could have been better. Chicken dopyaza was outstanding. Salad section was ok.. could have been little better. Dessert were ok too but choices were very limited. They can improve their salad and dessert sections.
Still I would recommend this buffet.

Located just where you can spend your time after shopping... The ambience is eye shooting and so are the food..the menu in here is well placed...and feature most for tandoori items...you get a complimentary dish and dat taste wow...

Parking wont be a issue here!!!
Now when you think of a buffet the best in town is barbae-que-nations and then you might think should i give this a try!!
Definitely it cant be compared to the top buffet, but it dosnt lack much behind either!!
Service is extremely good !!
Ambience is just perfect i mean we get a rare beautiful eating place with poised atmosphere!!!
Now, on food, first we are served with a welcome drink a different strawberry mixed drink, which is good .Then we have 3 non-veg starters and 3 veg starters . Chicken tikka,fish and fried chicken all were good. Paneer, Mix Veggie and babycorn they are also good.
In main course you get 1 chowman and chicken gravy dal and rice and fish gravy. Well it was just ok i still it needs a bit improvement in the main course department.
Now, deserts were also good .They serve ice cream on order so ask them its not kept with the buffet!!
But 750 for the buffet i dnt know whats the rate now after GST.
La-carte is also available .
Show the menu card items are fairly priced.
But I recommend go with the buffet it surely wont disappoint you !'
Recommended!!

Awesome ambience... Stunning decoration... A place where you can get some mental peace after entering the restaurant... Now foods- Delicious,well prepared,well garnished... starters were way above than many well established restaurants of Kolkata... main courses specially that mutton was heavenly... I'll definitely come here again just for that mutton!! Mocktails are another attraction of this place... so many varieties of mocktails... we have tasted just 3... but all were very good... Lastly,the stuffs are well behaved,helpful and polite too... In one sentence, it is surely one of the best restaurants of Kolkata!! Satiety and satisfied :-)

The worst buffet place I have ever been to. The service is really pathetic. The waiters were serving other people very well. I was using Little's coupon here. May be that's why they had such double standards. I waited and waited and out of frustration walked off by giving them my (Little's) coupon code. I would request the concerned person to look into the matter and take necessary actions. PS - Me along with my friends group are never visiting this place again. #ShitService

This is the only sunsign themed restaurant in kolkata located nearby city centre 2 and is a part of the hotel fern residency. I had visited this place generally for the buffet dinner it offers. The interior decoration of this place is near to perfection and so is the presentation. As soon you enter the place one of their staff will ask you your sunsign and hand you a mini card on which the characteristics of your sunsign will be written. They also have a special dish for each of their guests which is a sunsign dish in which 5 food symbolises 5 eternal forces of earth which determines sunsign. The food is pretty good but not up to the mark. The main fallacy being shortage of food items in the buffet dinner and lunch. However this place redefines dining experience and people should definitely look forward for it :)

Well..........Went there with lots of hope but disappointed by food options and taste.
Ambiance and decor is nice , staffs are very polity and courteous but the main component of ¬†restaurant " food" disappoints me.¬†

i ordered pappy chicken for starter and believe me it was horrible, although main course was good.
Quantity and prices are moderate but Mock-tails does not justify its price.

Hope Chef will work to improve the taste of the food

XII Zodiac, Kolkata's first zodiac based restaurant indeed stands out among the growing list of hideouts in every nook and cranny of the city. The executives are very friendly and courteous. The theme nd the ambience is fab.

The restaurant welcomes you with a platter of four items representing fire, water, air and earth, the four elements which build up zodiac. The best part every item is explained by the attendant. 

We went buffet. XII Zodiac provides with a variety of items for starters. Food is freshly cooked delicious. The main course, dessert also are pretty good.

It is a must visit.

Located in Fern Residency near Tamara, I choose to vouch for this place with its lovely ambience and food.
It was a family lunch for us. They will welcome you with a card of your zodiac sign, which is their own uniqueness.
The buffet spread was lavish and the starters had plenty of options to choose from. The food here is served on the basis of four elements Air, Water, Fire and Earth.
The only section that needs improvement is the dessert section. Limited choice. I would suggest add a few flavours in ice cream.
Will be happy to visit again and recommend.

Very nice place with a well todo decor and a good hospitality. Now coming to the food the quality was very good as most of the renowned hotels offer. The difference in the services was the style. Specially I liked the way they served the mix fruit dish.
The Kali dal with the tandoori roti was also very good. The dal had an altogether different taste with appealed to me. Even the I liked the quality and the serving style of the desert.
Altogether a nice experience, not of that high rage and yes can be visited now and then by friends or with family even.

XII Zodiac The first Zodiac (Sun Sign) based restaurant in The City Of Joy , Kolkata . This hideout is present in The Fern Residency in Rajarhat . Located very close to City Centre 2 this one is a tough competitor among other restaurants located in the nearby area . They say the food served here is inspired by the four elements of our planet Air , Earth , Fire and Water . Nowadays with quality hideouts sprouting in every nook and corner of the city , a themed restaurant tends to grab more attention and The Fern took that as an advantage and gave birth To XII Zodiac
 .

So me and my partner were in search of a quality dinner buffet and after using some time on Zomato we arrived at XII Zodiac. The Fern will mesmerize anyone with its quality d√©cor and Xii Zodiac does the same . Upon entering we were guided to our table which was fortunately beside the glass . Everyone does love to have small glimpse of the streets while dining and am no exception . A small floating candle was placed between us which helped us to grow along with the ambiance . After a few seconds we were asked about our Zodiac signs and then we were handed two cards based on our sun signs which is a great sign according to me . Leaving with a souvenir does helps to remember all the positive vibes that you had at a certain establishment . 

At first we were served four items on a platter which resembles the four elements of earth and they were explained generously by our attendant . Then we were served with Mojito and starters Seekh Kabab , Baby Corn , pepper fish , fish fry n etc which was prepared exquisitely . Detailing about every dish on a buffet would be a hectic task for both the sides so I will be trying to keep it to a minimum . Chicken was soft and delicious and the fish was wonderfully prepared which was free from any bad odor , which was fried in the perfect way . Paneer was soft and all of them were accompanied by green chutney and mayonnaise  dips which added up the taste . Finishing with the starters we were guided to main course section which had a huge variety of items starting from salads to Rice , from Chicken to Mutton n etc . Pictures of dishes are attached for better understanding . The salads were freshly cut which tasted really well n juicy for some other items (watermelon being one of them) which clearly states they were handpicked minutely . The Chow was a bit cold which is definitely not the most exciting thing but the side dishes helped to cover up that flaw . Chicken and Mutton were both prepared in a tasteful manner but the Mutton was a bit overfilled with bones and the size was a bit big to my liking but it tasted delicious . The dessert section also excelled in its part . Brownie , GulabJamun , Shirkand were all delicious but I feel that GulabJamun is tasted at it best if it is served hot . Ice Creams were in flavors of Vanilla and Chocolate which was Ok .

The ambience with low dims and floating candles adding up a chilling vibe is definitely an eye catcher for couples. The window was definitely adding up to the ambience  . There were facts relating to Sun Signs on the table and that will definitely attract anyone‚Äôs attention which is a great touch in my opinion . One of its main competitor Pipal Tree had a flaw as it didn‚Äôt serve dinner buffet and that is filled up exquisitely by XII Zodiac taking that single point as an advantage . The interior was managed in a great way but I do miss soft music here . I want the management to take this as a request from their customers , everything was present and all of them performed well but lack of soft tunes . The thing which I loved the most is that there was a tall tree outside which was blocking some part of the roadside view but they didn‚Äôt care to axe that thing down . This a great gesture and from a restaurant which deals with elements of nature does justice to its part . We all should make our fullest efforts to make our planet more green and I thank The Fern for putting their small contribution  .

With this I will be concluding this review of mine and some of the essential points I will be stating in this part so that the management can have a quick look .

1.	Not cutting down that tree although it was blocking the view was a great gesture n I loved it

2.	Lack of soft tunes was disappointing hopefully you guys will take that into consideration

3.	Staffs were extremely courteous and were ready to serve at every possible second . Special mention to our attendant Miss/Mrs. Tika , who did a great job in explaining the food along with the elements and also helping us in clickimg a picture :) .

4.	Food was really good and delicious , but the size of mutton should be a bit small as it fells really odd to chew down that big thing in public . GulabJamun should have been served hot .

5.	Small token of appreciation as the Sun Sign Cards were a nice gesture .

So to conclude this is a great place and I will definitely be visiting again . For anyone who is interested it was less than 700 INR for the buffet (single) .

XII Zodiac, located in Rajarhat Newtown, Kolkata, close to CC2, 5 minutes walking distance from there. It's a newly launched casual dining restaurant with the theme of 12 zodiac signs.
It's been colored up bright and nice, seating arrangements been done beautifully with good rooms to walk in, enough spacious to have conversations over foods, hardly one can eavesdrop. Long couches, wooden tables and chairs, overall nice ambience.

Opted here on JAMAISOSTHI for buffet lunch.
Got disappointed when we headed in main course, we saw that they had mutton only in main course no alternative with.
Well, unsure how could one keep only mutton in the main course with no alternative where they're charging so expensive? How did they come in conclusion that everyone eats mutton? They neither had any alternative in fish, only one type of fish was in the buffet.
It costed 750 INR/ each, what I got to eat only, Ghee Bhat or Polau, Sukto, Dal, Vajavuji. üò≥üò≥üò≥
One can get this type of foods anywhere by cheap prices as 450INR or 475INR.

It wasn't a worth visit. Not at least¬† on the day of JAMAISOSTHI. üëé

Now coming in detail,
Opted here with my hubby and when we entered it was empty, and filled in 3 more tables in couple of minutes. So in the entire restaurant there were total 4 tables filled including us and rest of tables remained empty and yet they failed to provide good service.
They said they'll serve the starters on table and so did they. But plate was filled with some savories where I was more interested in only tandoor chicken kebabs, so I asked one of their senior waitress if she can serve that, on which she said sure but what went wrong was, she got busy in two other tables and we kept sitting with somewhat empty plates quite long and on repeat calling she looked at us but responded nothing, found that quite unprofessional. And on calling again she walked to us and informed that they're running out of tandoor chicken kebabs so it would take some time to prepare and come to table, so I can understand that, but she could have told us this thing at the starting when we already called her twice for that item and she literally ignored and on third time calling she led us know that.
So this how we felt bad and sorry to being there.
However, in 5-6 minutes she came up with that and served that but not in a good manner, my bad that I chose to pay a visit here on this special occasion.
Now, we decided to skip it and move in main course and where we found,
Mutton - No alternative. What for them, who doesn't eat mutton?
Polau
Ghee bhat
Dal
Potoler dolma
Chhanar item
Vajavuji including luchi
Sukto
Desserts ||
Doi
Rajbhog
Fruits
Chatni and salads, yes they kept the salad with desserts instead of main course. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
So again comes the question, 750 INR for each for these items, totally not value for money! üëé

Now coming to service,
Apart from that senior waitress who attended us, other staffs were very courteous, helpful, smiling, and really heading to provide one good service. One of them helped us getting luchi on our table and some other people came and checked on us if we were liking the foods and how's the test. Yet we had ask them for refilling our glass every time, they failed to catch that every time, neither approached if we would like to refill the glass.

Tax and service charges are applicable here.

Overall experience ||Foods : 2/5
Service : 3/5
Ambience : 4/5

Hope you find it helpful and enjoy your visit here.
Keep checking my website chetepute.com I'll come up with more detailed portrait.

Well i used to see this place a lot on zomato,it seemed to be a nice one really,innovative theme like zodiac signs,it is the only zodiac sign theme based restaurant..such a beautiful place i must say..

Easy to locate,at chinar park just inside the The fern residency..

I went to this place on the occasion of mother's day with my mom and two sisters..they greeted us so well.we didn't have to wait as the seats were booked earlier..after that we took our seats..then the woman who attended us wished my mom happy mother's day n it was really nice to see that..as per the theme we 4 got our zodiac sign card where the sign based characteristics were written. Then we were asked if we wanted to take buffet or normal..we went for the buffet.so here i go about the food---

A refreshing drink mojito
Then came a lots of starters, we loved the starters most :
Fish pakora
Paneer tikka
Chicken kabab
Crispy chilli baby corn
Panner masala dry
Dry alu dom
Sheek kabab
Chicken wings...
The starters were mouth watering and damn good n were repeated more than once if wanted..
Then the main course--

Hakka noodles
Mixed veg
Basmati rice
Baked spinach and corn
Yellow dal fry
Jeera aloo
Paneer khurchan
Nun
Papad
Grilled chicken with mushroom jus
Hot garlic fish
Chicken butter masala
Mutton

These were good but according to us the main course could have been a bit better,not up to the mark as expected..

The deserts :
Payes
Gulabjamun
Watermelon
One more thing(i can't remember the name but it was tasty)

[There were different types of salads too]

We took "sizzling brownie with icecream" seperately(it was not under the buffet)..it was truly sizzling i must say...

So,overall the decorations were pretty good,the ambience was cool n peaceful,the staffs were humble n the lady who attended us was really very nice,thanks to her and sorry i forgot your name but you did a nice job.One more thing as it was mother's day so my mom's food was complimentary,it was not charged..
Finally the place was explored as i wanted since a long time..
Highly recommended place,you must try at least onceüòÉ

Located  in 2nd floor  of Fern Residency...beside  Tamara  Pipal  Tree..  Went  there  with  my friend..  We  were  planning  to  visit  this  place  for  a long  time  and  finally  we  visited  the  place  yesterday..

Place  is really nice and  comfortable.. Ambiance  was  perfect..  Service  was  amazing.. Xii zodiac management team  needs a special  mention.. 
 
As  it  is zodiac-themed  restaurant they  served their special plate with  4different items signifying the  symbol of earth,air,water and  fire..  We were gifted with 2 aka carte vouchers according to our zodiac signs.. Blue lagoon was served as the welcome drink..

They  served starters on the table..  Starters included total 6 items. Veg: chilli baby corn(perfect in taste) , paneer tikka and cheese ball (loved  it) , nonveg: chicken tikka (succulent chicken pieces were just  more  than  awesome ) , fish fry ( crispy and tasty)  and  the  best  starter  item  was  another  fish  item (probably  wing fishüòè) ..overall  the  starter  section  was  wonderful..
Sweet corn soup was  available there with  4/5 kind of chaat and salads. 
In main  course  there  were  plain  rice,noodle,daal, mixed  vegetables, paneer, fish, methi  chicken etc..  They  served mutton item on the  table.. Fish  and  chicken were tasty but  the  mutton item was very greasy and  burned.. Overall satisfactory.. 

But  in desert section options  were  very  limited and  not satisfactory..  There  were  firni, gulab jamun,fruits and  ice cream..  Don't know about taste of any of these as I skipped it..  They  need to choose better options and expansion in this section is also needed. 

It  was a nice experience. Love to visit again.

This place is located on the 2nd floor of The Fern Residency which is very close to City Centre 2, Rajharhat. It is a zodiac themed multi-cuisine restaurant serving Chinese, Continental and North Indian dishes. The ambience of this place is remarkable and the decor is imposing. We had opted for a weekday lunch buffet and it was thoroughly enjoyable. However, I would suggest them to include a few tandoori items in their buffet, especially in the starters list. Otherwise, everything else was top-notch.

We were being welcomed with a complimentary dish comprising of a few items which were in accordance with our sun sign. It had an Aam Panna Drink, a Pineapple Cheese Cherry on a Stick, a Paneer Tikka and a small crispy Puri with a Spicy Aloo Mixture on top of it. A nice complimentary dish; the Aam Panna Drink was very refreshing.
Mocktails:
Virgin Mojito(4/5): ¬†You can take this unlimited number of times. I don't think they serve any other variant of mocktail. This was¬†the only¬†mocktail and was available in plenty.
Veg Starters:
Crispy Chilli Babycorn(4/5): Crispy and awesome to taste.

Paneer Tikka(3.5/5): Nicely prepared, could have been a little spicier.

Vegetable Fillets(3.5/5): Crispy and okayish.

Non-Veg Starters:

Fish fry(4/5): Very tasty and deftly prepared.

Fish Pepper(4/5): Soft and succulent with enough flavours.¬†Chicken Tikka(4.5/5): ¬†Loved it.

They served 8 kinds of salads(Veg and Non-Veg).
Main Course:The spread was limited. They had 5 Veg items and 3 Non-Veg items.

Veg:
Veg Noodles(4/5): Very light flavoured yet it tasted good.

Mixed Veg Broth(3/5): The noodles being so light this should have been a little spicy. Unfortunately, even this was very light a preparation.

Steamed Rice(3.5/5): Simple plain white rice.

Yellow Daal(4/5): It was tasty. Low on spice quotient yet it was good.

Spicy Ladies Finger(4.5/5): This was the best ladies finger preparation I have ever had.

Non-Veg:
Chilli Fish(4/5): Very soft and succulent. This was amazing a preparation too.

Gosht Biriyani(5/5): This item was exquisite. I had never expected that I would get to taste one of the best biriyanis I have ever had at this place. I am a biriyani lover and I have had the same from almost all the renowned places in Kolkata, but trust me, the biriyani here was one of a kind.

Chicken Curry(3.5/5): Regular chicken preparation. Nothing special. Nevertheless, it was tasty.

They had assorted breads but I felt they lacked the item which would complement the breads¬†since there was no tandoori item as such.

The main course ended with a crispy masala papad.

Desserts:
They had around 8 desserts.

Rajbhog with masala paan filling inside(4.5/5): Amazing an item.

Rasmalai(4.5/5): Very juicy and soft. Loved it.

Kamalabhog(4/5): This was nice.

Pithe(4.5/5): Very well prepared. Tasted good.

Gulab jamun(4.5/5): Juicy and yummy.

Watermelon(4/5): Very fresh and of good quality.

Ice-cream(chocolate/vanilla/strawberry)(4/5): Had opted for the Chocolate flavour. It was good.¬†

Brownie with walnuts(4.5/5): This was amazing too. I have seldom had such freshly prepared brownies in my life.
Service(5/5): The service and hospitality we had received were really very impressive. We had Little app coupons for this place but unfortunately, my phone got hard-bricked on that particular day while we were on our way to this place. The coupon being booked from my phone would require my number to be active. Hence, there was a need for another phone since my phone was not working. Ms. Tika had helped us a lot in this crisis. She readily gave her phone to us so that we could get the required information and produce the coupon required for billing purpose.
A very romantic place to visit especially during the dinner time. It is very classy and the people here try their best to make you feel comfortable. I would love to visit this place again someday.

We went here on an offer by the Little app,where weekday lunch buffet for two was for INR 1092 instead of INR 1500.
On entering they ask for our zodiac signs and give an offer on the a la carte spread for the respective zodiac months.
Food: following is the detailed description of the food served-
we were welcomed with 4 elements platter that had-
‚õ≤Aam Panna( in a shot glass)- depicting water
üåèPanner tikka-depicting Earth
üåãPapdi- depicting fire
üçÉPineapple cherry stick- depicting air

There was an unlimited supply of mocktail(virgin mojito) (4/5).

‚ô† there were 3 non veg starters -
Fish fry(4/5), fish pepper(3.5/5) and chicken tikka kebab(4/5)

‚ô†Three veg starters-
Crispy chilly babycorn(4/5),paneer tikka(3/5) and vegetable fillets(3.5/5)

‚ô† For main course they had a very limited spread but each of the items tasted amazing!! And I somehow prefer quality over quantity so it worked well for me!
üçèFor Veg they had-
veg noodles, a mixed veg broth,rice,yellow daal ,a paneer curry and a spicy ladies finger masala dish. The bhindi masala tasted great but I didn't enjoy the veg broth much.

üçéFor non veg they had-
Gosht biryani,chicken curry and chilly fish.
The biryani needs a special mention as it is the best biryani that I have had!! The potato melted in the mouth, the rice was extremely flavourful and the muttonn pieces served were soft and juicy!! Their biryani is definitely one of the best in the city!! The Chicken curry on the other hand had a very low spice content almost equivalent to the regular light chicken curries that we have at home,nevertheless it was tasty!The chilly fish too was great! I am not a fish fan but the fish dishes here( chilly fish and even the fish starters) are amazingly tasty!

There were also assorted breads available.

The only con I felt was the fact that we had ordered for butter naan which was supposed to be served at our table but never came!
üçßFor desserts there was-
Raj bhog with a pan masala centre which was yummy!
A milk based sweet
Another orange flavoured sweet
A kind of a pithe I don't remember the name of!
Gulab jamun
Watermelon
Icecream(chocolate/vanilla/strawberry)
Brownie with walnuts
All in all the non veg starters , the biryani, the chilly fish,the brownie and the pan masala centred sweet were the best items of the spread! Especially their biryani is to die for...!!

Ambience(3.5/5) : I had expected the ambience to be more zodiac themed which wasn't the case! Apart from a booklet kept on the tables and the welcome platter nothing was zodiac sign related! Nevertheless the Deco was soothing and the seating comfortable!

Service(5/5): a big thumbs up to the xii zodiac team for their service! I would like to mention about Ms Tika who helped us so much and left no stone unturned to make us comfortable. Actually Soumya Chakraborty 's phone suddenly stopped working and the entire transaction took place in his phone... Ms Tika helped us by giving her own phone to us for the required information that was needed for billing and that too with a smile! This place will always be close to my heart for the heart warming service that they offered! Kolkata being the hub of foodies is known for serving great food- but a good service complementing it, always makes a deeper Mark!! I am surely coming back here !!

Keep it up team xii zodiac!!

Went there for a Sunday Buffet lunch.. They provide plenty of menu items in the buffet and each and every items are full of quality and taste even mocktails . we had a very negligible issue with mutton. when they asked about the food, we just told about it just as review and they changed it immediately. Starters and Salad varieties are awesome. Quality of non - veg starters were very good, mainly fish starters. There is a live pasta counter (Sunday special) Main courses were also very dynamic in range and good quality ingredients made. desserts are also good but could be better. Stuffs were really good. They follows there zodiac based theme very well they welcomes you with zodiac themed appetizer as complimentary. Over all very worthy place to dine out..

Located just a few steps from CC2,this cozy restaurant is really worth a mention.I had my 2nd visit to this place with my office colleagues.The first it was on poila boishak and they had a unique menu that day.I will only talk about the cons over here.Firstly the mutton and oriental fish was served on the table and that was late.We were nearly finished when mutton came.The desserts had only malpua with rabri and brownie with ice cream.Though I had read they keep 3 types Indian sweets but in dinner it was missing.Please improve your desserts.

The resturant is located in the 2nd floor of Fern Residency Hotel just 5mins walk from Cc2 towards Chinar park .. The ambience and decor is beautiful and different , perfect for romantic date .. Though the decor is little different from the other ones .. It's decorated by the zodiac signs, and Best thing is that one will get a voucher according to their zodiac sign on their next visit :)
So we had buffet
They had a refreshing welcome drink
All the starter was good, i totally loved it
However the main course was not that much good ..
The menu of the main course could have been better ..
Last the dessert portion
I loved the rosogollo üòç
So overall its good ..
Highly recommended
We had nearbuy coupons and this whole buffet
We got at 545 per head
Yippee ...
:)
Happy me :)

Went for buffet in XII Zodiac.  It was priced at ‚Çπ750 per head on a Tuesday night. 

LOCATION--It is located in fern residency which is opposite to city centre 2 and beside dominos.

First of all speaking about the ambience it was amazing. We were warmly welcomed. They had provided us with their welcome drink of the day. Though it tasted more like aam panna and was not so refreshing. They had also provided a complimentary drink which was blue lagoon. Now this was served towards the end but me being a hardcore fanatic of blue lagoon ot tasted real good.

STARTERS-- these were served at our table. There were 3 non veg and 3 veg starters. The best among all of them were the bell paper fish. It was soft and juicy and tasted amazing.

MAINS--they had plain rice and spaghetti. There were 3 veg mains and 3 non veg mains. There was mutton, chicken and fish in oyster sauce. Now one will not find mutton in the display, you will have to tell them to bring it to your table. There is also a variety of breads which again you will have to order to be served at your table. These are the precautions on a before hand in case you miss out on some really tasty dishes there and land into a misconception that they had promised mutton and they did not provide you. There was a variety of salads and freshly cut fruits. Probably the best preparation of paneer i had ever tried it was soft and delicious.The mutton was soft and delicious too.

DESSERTS--There were desserts which had shahi tukra, brownies and gajar halwa. There will also be ice cream but again you have to tell them to serve it you at your table. I had ordered for a chocolate ice cream with choco sauce and it came to my table very quickly.I loved there mouth melting brownies that went perfectly along with the ice cream.

Next coming to food quality it was superb. The place is a must go for everyone searching for a budget buffet place in town. The staff members are very co operative and well behaved.
Refer to my account for pictures.

This restaurant is located in the 2nd floor of The Fern Residency Hotel. It is a cool hotel with less of parking availability still they manage all.

Since long we have been wanting to go to this restaurant and finally we get the chance with our friends. Amazing decor of hotel and restaurant. Everything set in the form of 12 zodiac signs and you are given a complimentary discount according to your sunsign for your next visit. By various literature you get to know so much about your sunsign/zodiac sign. We went in for a-la-carte. We were given a small panna drink with some snacks to chew on on arrival. 

We ordered spring rolls for starters and they were great albeit a bit oily but they tasted great. For the main course we ordered a dish of paneer and a dish of mushroom and also a veg hakka chowmein. Let me tell u both paneer and mushroom were simply amazing. We specially liked the mushroom dish.

Finally for the dessert we had brownie with hot chocolate and ice-cream and it was the best thing we could have for the evening. The quantity was also amazing.

The service was too good with very courteous people and the price was also very reasonable. Must visit and highly recommended by me.

Plz note - There is no valet parking. They just show you the parking place and you need to park your vehicle yourself.

We went in a group of 13 people to celebrate a personal event after reading nice reviews in Zomato, but had a dismal experience. Also to be noted, I have called them 3 times in 1 week reserving the table and giving them heads up about headcount. (I have been to over 15 different buffets in Kolkata and Bangalore, and so I have reasonable expectations).

1. The starters were served at table (no problem in that), but it was abysmally slow. In 30 ¬†mins 8 of us have got 2 types (out of the claimed 6 varieties) and others have not even got that. They are simply staring at empty plates. Yes, as the host, it is humiliating and embarrassing. Told the waiters to kindly speed u, but after 40 ¬†mins we got 4 varieties (not all of us were that fortunate though)

2. We moved to main course and requested the waiters to serve starters along with as it was getting really late. There was only Veg soup, non-veg soup served on request and takes 15-20 mins to come...so by the time we were closing on the main course soup finally came. Mutton was served on table and not generously repeated. My whole point is, if the waiter strength is low, atleast¬†put all the items in buffet including starters so that we can help ourselves

3. The requested starters which we repeatedly asked them to repeat never came.When I complained to the manager, it came (enough for only 3-4 people) and we were having desserts then.

Seriously I don't know if there was 1 chef working that night or what, but it was a complete mismanagement. I DO NOT BLAME the waiters. Only 5-6 were there and guests were 40+. Management should seriously see into it. 550+ per head and this service is unacceptable. ¬†I regret having gone there to celebrate with a large group, I had to spend more time urging the waiters to bring food than I spent on the table.

The waiters are really polite and well-behaved, and they tried their best, but resources were very less. Think twice going here with large groups.

Food: starters (we got only 5 out of 6, and not all of us even got that) were very nice, main course is average, dessert is a big let down compared to other buffets in town.

Ambience: really awesome, it was the only thing that impressed me.

I visited the place and the ambiance was awesome and charismatic. At first I was given a starter resembling all the major elements which make up my Zodiac sign. Unique in its own way . When we went through the list of starters our tongues got salivated . Gradually all the starters were served . We ordered in our own comfort with no hurry . Then came the main course , we were simply stunned at the options we had at display . Tasted all of them and all of them were nice . The Brownie was awesome and even the Chef at the Live Counter took his culinary skills to a different level when he at our request created one of the tastiest Pasta dish I had till now .It was a nice evening to remember .

I will love to visit this place again !!

This place has been in my list for a long time but atlast got the chance to visit it yesterday. The ambience was really soothing and nice. The staff was courteous and polite. Upon entering, they greet you with polite smile and ask about the zodiac signs. They serve you with a zodiac platter called the 'Amuse Mousse'. The house special virgin mojito is being served after the platter. The starters were delicious. There were six starters. The main course surprisingly was good too. I could not taste all the dishes. Just had their Indian ones. The desserts had 5 different types of Indian sweets, fresh fruits, walnut brownie and ice cream. The pan shot they served after the lunch was unique and refreshing. All in all, it was worth every penny

Went there today for breakfast. The restaurant is located on right hand side if you come from chinar park and at a distance of 2/3 min from chinar park crossing. Ambience was relaxed and good. It was a buffet having many different items. Some were good like french toast, cut and dry fruits, sausage, baked beans, mug ka laddu. But some were very ordinary like fruit juice, hot and cold milk, sambar, luchi and chholar dal. Porridge oat was nothing special but healthy. Dosa was not available. Discounted voucher price from nearby app is sufficient for this. Price of rs 550 or 600 would be too much. Service was not good. However it can be definitely tried for experience. Do not know whether prior reservation is mandatory or not. Have not tried here lunch or dinner buffet which may be better. Hope to do so sometime.

We went there for a buffet lunch. The place is situated very close city centre2. The restaurant is on the second floor. It has a great ambience with comfortable sitting arrangement offering city view. Apparently the place is based in zodiac theme, so you will get zodiac related cards. The staff are very courteous and humble. They offered a welcome drink with few condiments. It had 4 veg/non-vegetarian starters with unlimited mocktails. Virgin mojito was the mocktail of day. The main menu was too well spread with few Indian, one Chinese and one continental dish. I was overwhelmed with the dessert section. They had mousse, brownie, fresh fruits, flavoured ice-cream, moong dal halwa, 3sweets. At last they offer you a pan shot which I never had anywhere and it was apt to relieve yourself from over eating. Overall it was a great experience, but I felt the main menu spread could be a but different.

The starters were tasty and the staff members were very cordial and helpful. The main course items were a bit simple but the White Sauce Pasta from the Live counter was delicious. The dessert had a variety of items and that was the star of the buffet.

Overall a nice warm place.

Ambiance is quite different and nice. Service is quick. Had a regular buffet dinner here. Starters section was a letdown but by the other two sections specially by the dessert section they balanced it up. They don't have mutton on the spread normally but they'll prepare it you specially if you order it at no extra charges. Same thing goes for some items at the dessert. section. Quality of food is pretty decent.

It's an wonderful buffet place to dine or lunch in. Abolsotely top notch among the few buffet outlets in kolkata. Although there was the lack of prawn. The fish was same with different preparations the options were more. But the the preparations was no doubt quite good. The limited service and the keeping the good items in the waiters control was a drawback. You have to ask for a repeat every time. The ambience was excellent with the candle light flavor. The staff service was good as well. Based on the price and the service, food and ambience I can rate the place very highly if you are planning a switch from the traditional barbeque nation for a buffet dinner.

Went to xii zodiac yesterday evening for dinner...I opted for non-veg buffet.One will be charmed by the decor and ambience of the place...The staff were caring about their guest...They made me very much comfortable over there...Scented candles were lit up and placed on my table...which added cherry to the cake...one cannot ignore falling in love with this place!!Now,coming to the food part...I fell in love with their starters..they were extremely palatable to the eyes as to my tongue...Main course had a variety of dishes which were quite tasty...but I was dissapointed by the spread of desserts they had...Three types of sweets,fruits and icecreams were there...Didn't find any pastries,custard,pudding or brownies!!There is a saying that All's well that ends well...They can improve their dessert section to give a better meal to their diners...But I really had a nice time over there and would ask my friends to visit that place and be a part of this lovely experience!!Way to go xii xodiac...Also can't thank enough to dineout for helping me dine at xii zodiac.

We went to this place on a weekday for dinner buffet. Not a preferrable option for buffet. It usually costs around 750 bucks A.I. on a weekday dinner.
When we reached the place, we were served with a welcome drink that was really good. 
In starters there were very few options and once we completed the starters available on our table and asked for repeat/ order for new starters, we had to wait for a long time post which the starters dishes that we got were not that good.
In the main course, apart from mutton there is nothing much to be mentioned.
In desserts, not only there was less options available but also ice creams were not available for self serve and when we asked for ice cream we were given one small scoop to each of us.
Had clicked only one pic ;) .. Sorry for that.

Firstly I loved the concept of the restaurant. The ambiance was awesome. Soothing blue lights and shades makes you happy and energetic after a day's work. You can get details about your zodiac everywhere in the restaurant,even the tissue papers contains the zodiac sign. So whoever loves to know about
their zodiac, must visit this place.
It is easily accessible, near by chinarpark crossing.
Coming to the food now. I have chosen the dinner buffet @697/- but they served five to six types of starter which was awesome to taste. Each items were excellent. Now for main course you need to take it from buffet and those were delicious. I remembered dhania mutton , Kung Pao fish, noodles with schezwan gravy, palak daal, rabri, balusai .. those were yummy. Last but not the least the blue coloured drink (lime soda water) was marvellous.
That's it. I love to visit here again as it is low budget best restaurant with great taste of food nearby chinarpark.

It was really good experience. Ambience was very good and quality of food is also good. I liked the chili fish started very much along with the corn item. Main dishes are also good with fish, chicken, mutton with rice, noodles and butter nun as options. Desert items were also good especially the brownie and the baked rasmalai.

This place could have been better if the food was. Great ambience. They ask you for your zodiac before your meal and then hand you out coasters according to your sign. But that's all the zodiac there is. The buffet food is infact less than average. There are much better places in Kolkata at the same rate.
Zodiac really needs to up their game

We had a pretty satisfying buffet lunch here recently. Beware, it is an expensive affair going by Kolkata standards of great buffets (think Barbeque Nation & Sigree). What was strange were the prices in the a-la-carte menu - Rs.100 for a naan, really?? The zodiac touch was the welcome platter with 4 elements, each representing a zodiac element. Pretty clever. After that you can forget all about the theme and enjoy your meal :)¬†

I liked most of the veg starters - chilli babycorn, chilli paneer, hara bhara kebab, cheese balls, tandoori aloo. A good, safe platter. The main course quality dipped a little. The subzis were lackluster with the exception of dal makhani. I missed a rice item. The au gratin was far from what it should be. Dessert featured chanar payesh, moong halwa, ice cream and a chocolate mousse. Simple but done well. All in all, it was a good meal. However, I felt that the price doesn‚Äôt justify the spread, purely in terms of quantity.

The main attraction of this restaurant is it's sun sign based theme.
Nice place to go out with your family,friends or even for a date.
We ordered a Chicken starter at first followed by Poached Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce with sauteed veggies,Grilled Chicken in Mushroom Sauce with veggies as main dishes.
I liked the fish but not the grilled chicken as it was very dry.
Death by Chocolate,the mocktail was heavenly!
As stated before,the ambience is quite attractive and the service was satisfactory.

I had visited the restro for lunch today...but quite dissatisfied with the experience. Its almost 15 kms from my home nd the drive is nt worth it. Slow but decent service , i personally didnot like the food , should improve more on food quality , instead of more on  theme . The theme looks nice but ultimate is the  food taste . plz work on it.

We had our lunch here during our stay at The Fern Residency Hotel . The restaurant has a unique Zodiac theme . A mini platter (amuse bouche) was served as a complementary starter. It had four mini portions inspired by the Zodiac elements namely Air,Fire,Water and Earth. We ordered for Chicken Dum Biryani for the main course and ended the meal with a Sizzling Brownie . The biryani was quite good. Service was also prompt. One extra rating for the innovative mini platter !

Went for the Buffet after getting a deal on Little app. The ambience is really very nice and quiet.¬†Starters were pretty decent and tasty. But there should have been 1-2 more varieties. Main course was very limited, especially for Veg - Just one paneer sabzi and some aloo sabzi that you have at home. Nothing else to have really. Desserts were fine.¬†
Overall very little variety in the menu. Not too much to look forward to. Ambience is nice because it's mostly empty and thus quiet. They need some more food options. Also, something about Zodiac signs, they mention, but its not really too interesting.

Well this will remain in my memories for a very long time, because of the date, moment, ambience and service. All the things gell well on 14th Feb 2017 when me along with my wife and my older son visited this place. Their food quality, hospitality and service were all top notch with respect to standards in Kolkata. Had a great time and loved all the items available on the special buffet arranged on Valentine's Day . Not to forget the special attention my kid received by the attending staff. He must have felt like a King on that day.

Although all of us are of different sun signs but we liked all the food items and mocktails.
The soup was not up to the mark.

Have been hearing about this restaurant for their special lavish buffet more than barbeque nation... and undoubtedly this is special... starting from their amuse Bouche to their 10 types of lavish starters and around 9 main course and around 8 desserts  with complimentary unlimited mocktail and paan shots.. this was indeed a great experience of food, the tandoori paneer is recommended as well as the dal makhani. The price of the buffet is also reasonable. At the end all the best to Fern Hotel for future... would surely visit again.

After reading many positive reviews finally decided to pay a visit.And truly speaking after seeing the comforting and soothing ambiance,starsign cladden walls,the plush sofas for seating-it was instantly love at first sight!Now coming to the food they serve an welcome platter(for reference check the pics below).For starters there are 6 items(3 veg and 3 non-veg).All were extremely well prepared.For main course there were soup,a wide range of salads which were extremely visually appealing,steamed rice ,mung daal,gondhoraj  murgi, paneer, mutton, chowmein , manchurian fish and some other veg items.Me ,being a bengali was extremely delighted to have rice,daal and mutton for lunch!u can even ask for naans if u want!..Most of the buffet serving restaurants dont pay much heed to the main course but each and every item of their main course was extremely delicious...the mutton was so soft and tender ...it was absolute love.But i felt they can improve the dessert section a bit.There u will get chitrakut,normal gajas,walnut cake,strawberry mousse,icecream of your choice.Finally i would like to conclude by saying for rs 750(inclusive of taxes) its a pretty lucrative deal!
P.s.i forgot to mention there will a complementary drink(virgin mojito) available throughout!Another thing is at end of the meal u will be served paan shots which is certainly a cherry on the cake!

Went there for buffet lunch. Ended up eating the starters only.. lots of starters which I did not like.. main course is really dull. Also the dessert section is not good .. service was good. Atmosphere great. Ambience wow. But they need to decorate the menu of main course and dessert .. 
Staters are served by their staffs. Starters - a welcome platter containing one mocktail , some fruits , 1 panner tikka , 1 small choclate ball. 
Then .. they served us a huge glass of mint lemon mocktail  which I really like. Then.. the starters goes on.. panner kabab, paneer sashlik, chicken seekh kabab , veg kabab, fish butter fry, chicken fry,  chilly fish and lastly chicken tandoori ..  starters were yummy really ... there was a live pasta counter. But there was no non veg option so I did not try. 
I was full that I ate little of the main course .. 
Main course was self served .. main course - plain rice , dal, dhokar dalna , manshor jhol, chowmin , chicken in mashroom broth , fish sweet and sour , veg manchurian and some more veg items .. as the buffet  closes on 3 :30 pm the staffs said us to hurry as they were soon removing the main course .. it was not expected as then it was just 3:15 pm . So I did not taste all those dishes .. 
Dessert - rosmalai and nikuti er payesh, choclate and strawberry mousse , narkel pithe, choclate pasteries .
Overall a nice place . Not a must go ..

Very unique concept they have,you gonna enjoy your meal according to your zodiac sign wth a complementary dish in the beginning which consists of four elements air,fire,earth and water and accordingly food served in the dish matching the elements.
The menu is nothing special though but the concept makes this place stand out from the rest.@xii zodiac

We have been there on 14th Feb, it looked crowded but the staffs managed the table, made us sit and served some awesome starters along welcome drink. The buffet spread was huge with plenty of options of veg and non-veg main course. I was amazed with 10 number of starters and that also unlimited service, repeat service was so frequent that lastly we had to request to stop. The mutton was too soft with mouth melting feelings. Huge number of desserts were offered with buffet.
No words to explain the hight of satisfaction, in a single word, it's just awesome. Fully satisfied with selection of items, variety, cuisine served, quality and taste of food, presentation and obviously the prompt service.
Thanks to team "XII Zodiac" for making my day memorable.

Last but not the least the Pan shot which was amazing . 
This restaurant is a must visit for all , they serve the food based on one's sun sign , which itself makes the restaurant stand out from the others.
The service too was excellent , specially Tika ( lady) who was serving with smiling face always.

I was there for valentines day dinner buffet. First they served appetizer that consists of 4 item.  It was okeish type. The drink was rose tea and i dont like it at all.  Then they served starters but very less amount. The taste was good but You have to ask them again and again. In the main course there was biriyani,  grilled chicken and fish. The grilled chicken was very bad and other item was so so. In the desert there was no ice cream. There was fruits, rose flavour rosogolla, gulab jamun, choco mousse, sandesh. 
They should provide more pastry item. 
I don't recommend anyone this restraurent. It is a total waste of money.

After having a horrible experience on valentine's day dinner with over booking and total mis-management of the restaurant somehow still had a lunch today with this place. Again the same crappy thing started..They hide biryani(never served)..Mutton only served after request...They hide 4 deserts from you and only on complaining they give u some reasons of hiding. Grow up. I would advise you to please visit some established buffet places in Kolkata beforetrying your hand at it an apology SMS or a message don't always work unless you really convert them into actions next time. Again a not so great experience at a place which promises one of the best food and staff behavior. Not visiting anytime soon again. Hiding buffet items and only on request and complain bringing them out is not a real good way. And even if u had valid reasons you should have just taken 10 seconds t say that to your Diners upfront.

It was slightly hassled experience so far as the valentines day bookings were concerned. But its expected right? The offer they had rolled out had to attract people in hoardes. Having said that we had got our table about 45 minutes late and the review is about experience once i enter the restaurant. The spread was exteremely good. 6 non veg starters and 2-3 veg starters (which of course we did not try except for paneer). The food was extremely tasty ! And so was the behaviour of the staff. They were very hospitable by their service standards and at the end of meal the head chef came out to meet us and seek our feedback! The desserts could have been slightly better particularly the bengali sweets. The main course was also extremely good. The biriyani was brilliant and so was the chicken in pesto sauce. Overall a fantastic restaurant. Would surely visit again!!

We were there on 14th of february. They have arranged valentine special night. Initially I had some issue as I already booked the table from zomato 3days before, tried to call them but no body picked up, but when I went there they told me no booking is there with my name. But later they arranged a table. This the only blunder they had but guys believe me the food was cool, the staff behavior is really awesome. Also the dim light with nice candle made the day special. Thanks to Zodiac for lovely night. My suggestion, just write one information message on zomato or other app that you only accept telephonic table booking or else people have to go through some trouble like me and few other guys had on that day. Also ask the guys to server more starter for buffet as the quantity was less might be because pressure on that day. Enjoy guys and I would love to again go there and try kabab and chinese.

Tried their best but still ended up being on the badside.
I had booked a Valentine's day coupon for a couple dinner for 1299.
I also had made prior reservation at 7 pm via Zomato App. Now when I reached I was told there is no reservation on my name hence have to wait for min 2 hours to which I had to literally escalate the matter and finnaly ended up on a 6 seater.
Now the dinning experience. The restaurant was dark ,and by dark I mean really dark as if there is power cut.Some tables had a small candle ,while mine initially did not have any,later on when my girlfriend insisted they gave me a candle.
Now the food, we were served starters even before water or any cocktail.
I had to literally beg, "bhai Pani do,bhai cocktail milega,bhai khana milega,"
The starters were warm but were limited,we were given what he felt is appropriate for us. If you ask for another he will ignore and go to the next table.
1 thing ,this restaurant will get full marks on food decoration or food presentation.Just marvellous.
Few food items were exquisite while some felt raw or undercooked in terms of taste.
They served a hell lot of items but even if I say the starters were nice,it detoriated when it went to main course or even deserts.
Even when I was leaving at around 10,I saw almost 20 odd people in queue.
Overall average food ,good behaviour,bad management techniques and dull environment.
Request to the management,please put more efforts on managing a huge crowd ,please have proper booking procedure and please make the interior more vibrant.

Heights of Worthlessness 
Booked for Valentines Day dinner. We were asked to drop by 9.30 pm while making reservation few days earlier. Once we reached had to wait for an hour. They were overbooked due to some discount Nearbuy online promotion. After repeatedly  chasing for a table, finally got a table which was not set at all with any glassware, no napkin, no curlery, neither any special set up. Naturally, we went there to spend some quality time. To cover up they started serving starters and we have to consume food in dark and had to finish by simply galloping one after other. The ambiance of a simple candlelight dinner was without candles lit up. There were no accompaniments with the starters. Most  of the food were not being replinished on time because the service staff was in hurry to close up of buffet. Is this is what we expect?  Ruined our special occasion.

Gist : Great service, good food, good ambience with a zodiac themed in a spacious place.

I visited this place on 04.02.17 around 7.30PM. Easy to locate. Restaurant is on the 2nd floor of the hotel. Pre booked for non-veg buffet. The place is big having seating arrangement of 2*5 + 4*7 + 6*5 persons. Toilet is outside of the restaurant. Their service is excellent, they help through the menu. They serve fast but it can bit improve. Food is good in starter and main course but signature taste is missing. Sweets are great in taste and can compete with big brands of sweets. But starter and main course may have more type of items. Overall good experience.

Bump into this place on saraswati puja's evening. Except for the ambience and humble waiters nothing was good about this place. We ordered sweet corn soup, shepherds pie, murg kaligolmirch, naan and in mocktail we ordered death by chocolate. Shepherrds pie was worst I have ever eat & naan's were smaller than hand made roti. Prices were high as compared to the quantity and quality of food. Giving 1.5 only because of its ambiance. They spoilt our entire dinner experience.

I wish I could review Zodiac in minus as my experience was pathetic with them. Ambience was soothing but the food was too pricy, the taste being awful. I am not sure about the buffet here as I ordered individual food items and none was up to the mark. Sweet corn soup was a sugar syrup, naan was so tiny, murg kalogomirch was pretty okish, shepherds pie was some weird thingy which had no taste completely blande, and yes lastly the mocktails death by chocolate was so damn sweet... One can die of sugar having this. Sorry but you guys must work a little more on the quality and taste of the food rather than focusing on the ambience and concept. Too much of disappointment. Ruined my evening. Thanks . My email Id- sarkarrumela7@gmail.com

It is a theme based restaurant and the ambiance is nice. When one arrives, they present a card according to our zodiac sign. We had taken the buffet. First they served appetizers. It had 4 items each representing the 4 elements of universe : earth, water, fire, air. Then they served the starters. For starters they served altogether 5 items : 3 veg and 5 non veg. Among theses, I liked the babycorn chilly and cheese balls. Fish chilly pepper was rather sweet, thus didn't like it much. For the main course there were 2 options each for veg and non-veg along with rice/noodles/bread. There was salad , sprouts, rayata and a separate section for pastas as well. For dessert there was brownie, baked boondie, moond dal ka halwa, cake, fruits and ice cream was served on demand. Staff is courteous. The food quality could be given a raise.

The concept of getting food served based on one's sun sign is really interesting. The ambience is great, be it for friends, family or a date. We started with puffy mustard chicken which was great followed by chicken biryani, murgh kaligolmirch and steamed rice. Along with those we also ordered drinks- death by chocolate and cold coffee with ice cream. And for dessert we had sizzling brownie. Albeit the food was great with death by chocolate and sizzling brownie being the showstopper, I observed some slack in the service which annoyed me a bit.

Ambience- Good
Food- Great
Service- Needs improvement

Bump into this place on saraswati puja's evening. Except for the ambience and humble waiters nothing was good about this place. We ordered sweet corn soup, shepherds pie, murg kaligolmirch, naan and in mocktail we ordered death by chocolate. Shepherrds pie was worst I have ever eat & naan's were smaller than hand made roti. Prices were high as compared to the quantity and quality of food. Giving 1.5 only because of its ambiance. They spoilt our entire dinner experience.

I wish I could review Zodiac in minus as my experience was pathetic with them. Ambience was soothing but the food was too pricy, the taste being awful. I am not sure about the buffet here as I ordered individual food items and none was up to the mark. Sweet corn soup was a sugar syrup, naan was so tiny, murg kalogomirch was pretty okish, shepherds pie was some weird thingy which had no taste completely blande, and yes lastly the mocktails death by chocolate was so damn sweet... One can die of sugar having this. Sorry but you guys must work a little more on the quality and taste of the food rather than focusing on the ambience and concept. Too much of disappointment. Ruined my evening. Thanks . My email Id- sarkarrumela7@gmail.com

Xii zodiac- It is a Zodiac themed multi-cuisine restaurant, mainly serves North Indian, Chinese & Continental dishes. This restaurant is all about indulging in dishes that are best-suited for your sun sign.

It is located on the 2nd floor of The Fern Residency near CC2, Rajarhat, New Town. Well known place. 

A relaxed ambiance, with soulful music and eye catching decoration.  The soothing colours, wooden furniture and glass windows manage to create a fantastic dining experience. 

GT Road Food Festival (From Kabul to Kolkata) is on the way, starting from Thursday 26th January, will go on till 5th February Sunday. Buffet option available for 699+tax. Got an invitation to taste some of the best dishes they have to offer. 

We were welcomed by Sweet & Salty Fresh Lime soda which was very refreshing, and after that started our exciting food-journey of  mouth-watering dishes from different places like Afghanistan, Kabul, Punjab and many more.  

Paya Shorba - Paya soup or shorba is a flavourful less spicy soup made with goat trotters. Goat trotters are cooked along with delicious aromatics for a couple of hours till all the flavours are infused in the both and you have a flavourful delicious soup to enjoy. It was really good.

Banarsi Dal Pakora- A mouth-watering crispy snack comes with a spicy dhania chatney. Chatpata!

Dilli wali Aloo Tikki- It‚Äôs a famous north indian street food, fried aloo patty garnished with onions, a sweet tamarind chutney, hot green chutney made from chili and coriander, curd and bhujia. It was lip smacking and tasty.

Tunde Kebab- It is a dish made out of minced meat and various types of spices, yogurt, ginger, ghee etc. It‚Äôs a part of Awadhi cuisine and very famous in Lucknow. It just melted in mouth in no time. Just wow!

Peshawari Murgh Tikka- Chicken pieces marinated with spices and slowly cooked in tandoor. Soft, juicy and smoky aroma instantly makes you hungry. It‚Äôs a must try.

Gilafi Seekh Kebab- As obvious from the name, these kebabs are cooked with a "Gilafi" (Its mean cover).  Chicken seekh kebabs are, covered with a minced lamb coating. It‚Äôs the first time I had something like this. Taste nice.

Gosht Biryani. - Well this item was heavenly. Not the same as usual Kolkata type biryani. This biryani cooked with some succulent pieces of mutton wrapped in a perfect blend of aromatic spices and herbs. A real delight for your taste buds. 

Now come to the dessert section. We had Phirni, Beetroot Halwa (A must try) and Lassi. Lassi was thick, creamy and really good. We all have gajar ka halwa but not Beetroot Halwa. Nevertheless a delicious Indian dessert. The food journeys ends really well. A memorable food journey. Well go to XII Zodiac and be a part of this incredible food journey. 

¬†A special thanks to

XII Zodiac is a Zodiac themed restaurant which mainly serves North Indian, Chinese & Continental delicacies at a reasonable rate.

Location - It is located on the 2nd floor of the Fern Residency near CC2, New Town.

Ambience- Spacious, grandeur decor, lavish sitting arrangements , shiny floor, mellow light. This Zodiac themed restaurant is based in the aforesaid 4 universal elements and 12 Sunsigns. Each Person's personality, eating habits, likings can be traced from these Zodiac signs, which is definately a unique thing of this restaurant.

Staffs- Staffs are well behaved and sober. Service is prompt.

They have launched a new tempting  menu for their Grand Trunk Road Food Festival ( from Kabul to Kolkata ) starting from 28th January to 5 th February. We, a team of food bloggers were  cordially invited for the same as a part of food tasting.

We were welcomed by Sweet & Salty Fresh Lime soda which was very refreshing and had a tangy taste, which is unique.

We were served the following delicacies - 

1) Paya Shorba- It is a traditional South Asian food. Paya means feet in Hindi or Urdu. The main ingredients of the dish are the trotters or hoof of a goat or sheep.Cooked with various spices, slowly cooked on low heat for hours for a soup like consistency. It was indeed very flavourful & lipsmacking.

2) Banarasi Dal Pakora - It was very crispy and a decent snack to try out .

3) Dilli wali aloo tikki - A very popular street food of Delhi made with boiled potatoes, onions & various curry spices topped with curd and chutney was very lip smacking and tasty. A must try.

4)Tunde Kabab - Made of minced meat and spices, yogurt, ghee etc is a speciality of Lucknow. It was very soft & succulent. 

5) Peshawari Murgh Tikka-  Marinated chicken, cooked perfectly was juicy and palatable.

6) Gilafi Sheek Kebab- These kebabs are cooked with a gilaf ( cover ). Lamb mince is mixed with spices and cheese, finished with a gilaf of onion and capsicum, then cooked in oven. It was pretty decent in taste.

7)Gosht Biriyani - Best Biriyani ever had. It was less oily, aromatic and very nicely cooked. Meat pieces were tender. Highly recommended.

8)Murgh bharta - Very thick gravy, different from regular chicken bharta. It was very tasty, hot , spicy and was served with Naan.

9)Phirni- Served in clay container, was very creamy and soft. Saffron, cardamom powder, roasted Kaju & Pistachio gave ample flavour to it. A thing not to miss. One of the best Phirni ever. Highly recommended.

10) Beetroot Halwa- Almost like carrot halwa, this was deep red in color garnished with sliced almond , Pistachio & Kiwi fruit. It had perfect sweetness balance and was delicious.

11)Lassi - It was served in a Matka , tipped with sliced almonds and cardamom, was very thick, creamy and was very refreshing. Again highly recommended.

Be a part of this food festival staring from 28 th January and enjoy the yummy ride with the above mentioned delicacies.

Thanks Rajdeep Da for your invitation.

Thanks Mridul Das for your warm  reception.

Went on a family dinner. Location is accessible. View from the tables, especially the ones by the window is quite good. Ambience is excellent.
We went for the buffet. Crispy chilly baby corn and pepper fish were particularly good as was the chicken.
The main course and deserts were selective and of good quality. There was a healthy mix of Thai, Chinese, Continental and North Indian items. The chicken biryani and the Singapore noodles may need special mention.
Among the deserts the phirni was the pick of the lot.
There was a special attempt to make this venture something different by segregating menu items according to zodiac signs.
The price is just about fair per the standards provided. The staff were very courteous and attentive.

Stumbled across this place while I was scrolling nearby places in Zomato. Paid a visit with my friend today. The decor and ambience of the place is pretty nice with warm and cordial staff. But a warm welcome means nothing if the food you serve fails to impress my stomach! So coming down to the food; I'd rather say that it was very average compared to the price they have valued their dishes for. We had ordered strictly vegetarian North Indian cuisine, so I am in no position to comment on their Italian, continental and Chinese section but as far as North Indian section goes, the taste failed to impress my taste buds. Now, they were two things that highly disappointed me: their complimentary dish (also called as the four elements of zodiac by them) and the other being the sizzling brownie in the dessert section. I'll post the picture of the complimentary platter at the end of this review. We received it as a welcome gesture by the restaurant but then there was nothing welcoming in it. The irony was, it looked so beautiful and tasted awful. My one request to the management - if at all you are reading this, please don't serve those "elements " to any of your customers again, they'll never come back instead they'll post reviews just like mine! The second turn off was the sizzling brownie; it was burnt and the brownie did not taste like a brownie. We had requested the manager to change it and he obliged but the second helping was worse. It had a persistent taste of oil/butter from it. One bite was enough for us to be repulsed from even getting it anywhere near our mouth. 
Overall, I believe I'm not recommending this place to anyone for now. If at all, you think about going to this place go because it can provide you eerie silence and give you ample quality time to talk to your loved ones. Yes, this place remains empty!

Ambiance: Was A Grade. Lovely setup. Very table has it's privacy and colour used are nice and sober. 
Food : The pasta at the buffet could have better. Starters had a lot of variety but maybe, paneer pakora wasn't a very suitable item for starters. Main course is limited and tasty. Apt. In regard to the starters and welcome drinks the restaurant offers. 
Service: Swift. Attentive and very Courteous!  It was a pleasant afternoon enjoying the lunch buffet. :)

I went there couple of days back.One anniversary party was going in the restaurant on that day but the restaurant was opened for others also.That made it little mess. We opted for buffet dinner and welcomed with there signature platter which represents 4 basic ingredients of the universe-water,fire,air,earth. Liked the idea. All the starters were in fried side,no kebabs or grilled starters were there. We were served almost 11 types of starters though. I liked the salads. Main course was very tasty. There was very limited types of desserts. What I liked most about this place is the behavior of the staffs. They were very polite and was taking feedbacks generously.

The Food is really good. Ambience are staff services are really awesome except the mocktail services.
we were there for dinner with coupons from groups for buffet dinner and unlimited mocktails.
we have got our first mocktail after half an hour and asked for second one and that never came.
I would request the administration if you promise something, please abide by the promise statement. I would expect this will be taken care in future. Apart from it, the food tastes are really very good.

We opted for this restaurant because of good reviews. We had coupon so four of us went for sunday brunch. The place was excellent in ambiance. They asked about the zodiac sign of us.  The buffet included 5 veg and 5 non veg starters. Both the types were really good especially the  chilli fish item. Their service was excellent. They served Blue lagoon as mocktail which was well blended. The main course had a lot of options but there were not much items which was outstanding  but all of them had good taste. The mango mousse was great. The desserts were no short of mentioning as nicely prepared.

Overall I'm definitely would like to  check in this place in future.

This restaurant will hold a special place in my heart since the first time I visited here, I threw a dinner treat for my colleagues for a very special occasion. I checked out this place on Zomato first since we wanted to see a new dinner spot. I must admit none of us were disappointed. Most of us had a smile on our face when we left. 

Ambience - A restaurant of this type that is built amidst opulence, obviously catches the eye. I loved their flooring and the reception lobby. If one can book this place for a banquet, surely people will wonder if one is rich. The restaurant seating is perfect with nice erect chairs with good lumbar support and just enough cushion. The ceiling, walls and other aspects of interiors are really tastefully done. The lighting in few places did seem a little weird though. To bring the dim lighting effect, they simply chos@e to turn off few bulbs in the corners. Otherwise overall pretty impressive 

Service - this is a zodiac themed restaurant. They have zodiacal pamphlets, handouts, calendar like albums etc that keep the customers engaged. The staff is very well behaved and seemed eager to satisfy us. Service was prompt and with a smile. But like many wondered, so did I when they asked us our zodiac signs, and mentioned that each zodiac has it's own type of food. We did expect some zodiac related food, but out came a handout that didn't really mean much to us. Overall, this little gig felt very put on, rather than some genuine effort to utilise the knowledge of one's zodiac sign to enlighten one about one's ideal food habits.

Food - Coming to the main point, in the end I was happy I visited this place. They started us off with a little something that's supposed to represent the 4 zodiacal elements. Some flavoured water, a paneer tikka which was essentially paneer laced with chat powder, a slice of orange and a tiny little piece of idly dipped in sweet chilly sauce. For a zodiac themed restaurant, rituals like these need to be more elaborate and abundant than just a touch and go. The starters were excellent and mild. Unlike barbeque nation, where the starters themselves feel too heavy, the ones here were well thought out and careful not to stuff the tummy. The main course was also nothing out of the ordinary. Regular rice, noodles, chilly gravy, paneer, chicken, mutton etc, but they were all so good to taste. It did make me feel that things don't have to be extravagant, they just need to be adequately good to bring a feel good factor. Then came the disappointment. The desserts were way below par. Boondi was excessively sweet, ras malai had no ras nor malai, but only flavoured water, brownie was only in colour and felt more like flour covered with chocolate syrup and who makes besan barfi in a posh restaurant? Honestly, in any buffet in a lavish place, I go for at least three helpings of desserts, but here I couldn't even finish the first. It was that bad. Minus 1.5 stars just for that. You can't and shouldn't make someone so happy and break their heart in an instance. Oh and they also gave a neat mocktail with the buffet.

Pricing - From Monday to Thursday they charge ‚Çπ596 plus taxes currently, which is a decent cost, but it's also enough to enable them to overhaul their desserts department. 

Verdict - I look forward to visiting XII Zodiac again but this time with my family.

Visited it on 31st night, the buffer spread was okayish. The service was very impromptu, we had to request atleast 5-6times for serving us the mocktails. Food was fine taste wise. I liked heir shrimp cocktail but the choco lava was horribly bad, it smelled horrible. Not satisfied at all. Ambience and decor is fine.

went there for a team lunch buffet.....nice decor based on zodiac.....while the orders were being taken we were asked our zodiac sign but strangely it didn't come into play during our entire course of lunch, so that did appear strange to us...

Coming to food each of us was given a platter comprising of four items representing the four zodiac elements, earth air fire water

Starters comprised of 1 chicken item, 2 fish item and 3 veg item

main course was nothing impressive , so were the soup and salad
mutton was served on the table
another thing that appeared strange was that the mocktail was served at the time of maincourse whereas almost everywhere else it served before or during the starters

dessert constituted of malpoa,rabri,mishti doi,mango mousse,cold cuts and ice cream which was served on the table again

Overall verdict: has a lot of room for improvement

Opted in for the a la carte Indian spread. We were first served with a complementary welcome platter that represented the 4 elements air water earth and fire. It comprised of a glass of cranberry juice, spiced guava, idli in a sweet sauce and paneer. We ordered murgh tulsi tikka and the chef's special kabab. For mians, we had butter naan, masala kulcha, dal makhani and awadhi murgh korma. Food quality was good with decent portion sizes. Specially loved the dal makhani. Service is prompt and courteous.

I was a bit sceptical about visiting this place for spending a special day. But this place made it special, truly special!

We opted for the weekday buffet lunch @ 596+tax.

Location: 5/5
Located almost on the opposite foot of City Centre Shopper's Stop, the exact bus stop being Noapara. Second floor of the Fern Residency it is.

Food quality: 5/5
The buffet spread was good. The quality of food was too very high, especially for the fish items. Schezuan fish was yum. The mutton in the maincourse tasted great. Fish in red Thai curry was amazing. The other items were okay and average.
I didn't like the sorting of food dishes much. Chinese, Indian, Continental..things seems confusing.

Ambience: 4/5
Decor was fine and spaceous. Didn't quite figure out the theme factor of Zodiac signs. All we received were cards in accordance with our Zodiac signs. Else, with music and the special decor of this season, it was amazing.

Hospitality: 5/5
This place has some of the best staffs of the hotel business. So courteous and amicable. Mr. Snehasish and Mr.Soumen attended us mainly, and were very efficient persons.

Overall, a great place to visit. And the price paid was totally worth it.

We decided to spend the Christmas Eve here after going through the Gazal night and special buffer dinner advertisement on Zomato. The Gazal performance was good. Now coming to the review part, the overall ambience of the theme based restaurant is good. It has a soothing atmosphere consisting of a candlelight experience. The hospitality of the staff and waiters is also good as they welcomed us into the restaurant and presented with welcome drink. There was a variety of items of the buffet menu as mentioned on their website.The quality of food was good. Only the taste of the food items was not upto the mark and could have been much better.
Rating on the individual aspects, I would rate the ambience at 5, hospitality at 4.5, and taste of food at 3.

After the BBQ nation, this one has become my favorite place!really a good experience we had.. Starter was ok.. 2veg n 3non veg starter were served on the table.. Among them fish fry was little off the taste.. Bt hot n garlic chicken was superb!!they need to improve the veg starter spread as we got grilled potato.. No paneer item was there in starter! Now the main course.. It was great in taste.. Steamed rice, mutton curry, noodles, fish, chickn kosha, paneer masala all were tasty.. Bt the soup tastes awful! I think we were unlucky that day because the dessert option was very few.. Rasgolla n gulab jamun was the only thing that tastes ok.. Though gulab jamun was sooo sweet that we had to left few pieces.. Mishti doi beacame watery.. Once again we couldn't finish it.. Ice cream was served on table.. Jst two scoop of the flavor we mentioned!not there on the buffet spread.dnt knw why! Very disappointed fr the dessert portion.bt in the previous review i saw dessert spread was quite good.. So would luv to visit there again n be lucky enough to get good options in dessert üòÇ

But the food served at the beginning denoting the 4 elements - fire,wind,water,earth is something that I would not like to taste ever again...
Good variety of starters..tasted well enough
Option of main course could have been more..
All fish items ,be it starter or main course tasted really amazing!
The dessert was good..the brownie definitely deserves special mention..

Visited this Restaurant last week on recommendation of a friend. Honestly, zodiac thing was refreshing for a while but the food was disappointing. Very Limited options for vegetarians and options were not great either.  Starters and deserts were better though.  For deserts,  they did not provide all the options on the buffet table itself,  only when asked for brownie did they say that it was included.

Well I chose this place for my parents' 30 anniversary being skeptical, but let me tell you I left with the feeling of coming back over and over again. Mr. Mridul Das(Manager) stood out in managing the whole event and made sure it went down smoothly. The starters were great as the buffet spread. Although the murgh palak from the main course could have been better. I would highly recommend this place to all because of its ambience, service and offcourse the food.

Went for a team dinner , Amazing food (except for mutton),good ambience , was lost in an ocean of taste .
Starters were so yummy and mouth watering. Murg ¬†haryali kabab and chilly garlic pepper fish were super awesome and so was the main course.Desserts (gulab jamun,rosogulla) too were also worth remembering.
It's a great place ¬†and would like to visit again.

Located on the 2nd floor of the Fern residency near City Centre 2, this place boasts of a nice cosy ambience and fantastic staff behavior. We were a team of 26 having a Team lunch there and the staff made every effort to make our experience worthwhile. 

We were greeted to a plate containing 4 food items- each representing an element of the zodiac. I'm sorry I do not remember the name of the dish but it constituted of a piece of fruit (probably peach), a spicy potato, a piece of idli dipped in honey and a spiced up orange-y drink. It was a good thing to start off the meal which comprised of starters- paneer tikka, chicken tikka, fish fry, an assorted veg. fry with cucumbers in it, pan-fried chicken and baby corn. The fish item was unanimously accepted as the best- juicy, succulent bhetki without an overindulgence of oil and a taste that still lingers in my mouth.

The main course was just average- ginger chowmein, oriental chicken, steamed rice, masoor dal with onions, kosha mutton, chicken gravy with potatoes, alu-gobi curry and paneer sultani. The dal appealed to me the most and the oriental chicken was the biggest disappointment due to its bland nature. 

For dessert we were spoiled for choice with an enormous range of options from salads, mousse, cheesecake, halwa, ice-cream, sondesh and what not. In short- a sweet-toothed person's paradise! The buffet cost us approximately 680/- per person which is reasonable. However, I was a little disappointed to see that my zodiac sign played no role in the food we were served and all of us got the same stuff. Next time I hope to try their a-la-carte menu.

Thats basically a hotel and not an independent restaurant! The restaurant belongs to the hotel. They have great selection in their buffet menu, but for their a-la-carte they arent able to serve much and they dont have a lot of options. Ambience was really good, but food prices were on the higher side, staff and management were really courteous enough and personally visited every guests table to ask them how they liked their restaurant! But quantity of food compared to prices were pretty insufficient. Its a good new concept but they have lots of room to improve! Overall isnt bad, but isn't that good too! Not really a must visit place!
Thank you!

very limited options in buffet ; in both veg and non-veg sections.Ambience was just fine, service good but the main thing taste of food was really dissapointing. In starters they serverd ready to cook chicken nuggets along with undercooked fish. They dont have mutton/lamb in starter or main.

The location of the restaurant is good. The sea green and pink colour combination of the whole decor gives it a very soothing look.

Welcoming the guest with a card of there zodiac sign and a platter of welcoming food which defines the four elements of life - water, fire, earth and air is unique. Although I recommend that the panner in that welcoming dish should have been little hot.

Next comes the overall food. Trust me the Chinese is really yum. It's nicely cooked with immense quantity of vegetables. The stir fried vegetables had good juggled vegetables with no extra garlic (which generally happens).

Even the Indian platter has lot to offer but nothing extra ordinary. The breads were crispy and served hot which made the experience better. I tried the cheese onion kulcha , but I failed to find any cheese or onion in it. Some of the dishes have extraordinary name but it's the normal local dish.

The section for buffet and ala carte is well distinguished. The place is quiet with a view of the busy roads of chinar park.
Next time if you are looking for a good dine in with family or friends to just sit and enjoy good food, this place is a must visit.

The restaurant has got a very unique theme for it's menu and the ambience is quite pleasant. The food was nice but I expected a lot more, guess that's why I am giving them a lower rating. Service was brilliant with very cordial staff and the presentation was excellent. I became especially fond of their welcome drink.

Yesterday me and my team of 12 people visited the Zodiac for first time and had launch there. Please note the rating is not biased or influenced by me. Each and one of us was delighted,enriched and consisted of a suprised pleasant experience which we never expected before coming. Restrurant staffs are well mannered ,well behaved and really co-operative. They are the jewels of Zodiac. The foods were awesome,tasteful and mouthwatering. Three cheers of Zodiac. But please try to keep up the same, coz we have seen many restaurants started brilliantly but gradually start losing reputations. 5 stars for Staffs, 4.5 for food and one extra star for focusing on theme zodiac, well that's a surprise and every must visit Zodiac once. Guys who will be choosing Zodiac first time don't worry, it will surely give one of the best experience.

As the name suggests, this restaurant's menu is based on the different Zodiac signs. I went here for a buffet lunch and was pleased by their hospitality and amazed by the food quality. From starters to desserts, I wasn't disappointed. 
The ambience is great and so is the hospitality by their staff.
I Would surely visit again and recommend it to others to give it a try.

Today when I went to XII Zodiac with my family, the Food Fusion Festival was going on. We ordered a few of the food fusion items like spaghetti shots, chilly cheese paratha, idly satey and spaghetti tarka salad. All of them were very tasty, the presentation of the food was also very innovative. The combination of each fusion item was very unique. The ambience of the restaurant was comfortable. All of the staff members were very friendly.

Amazing place, good food, family staff.

Apart from everything I loved the family gesture of the staff there, this is something that most of the restaurants lack a lot.

Comming back to food, the starters were ammmmazing, especially the garlic fish (you must try it) and the main course was also pretty good. Apart from the fact that I had toooooOoo many starters, I practically had very less space in me to fill the main course. But yes, it was delicious experience.

I had visited along 12 friends. We had got a deal from nearbuy so we paid 520 per head for the buffet dinner, inclusive all taxes. For me, a bang on bucks.

We had been here during Puja's and had the buffet.. I must say the food was okay. The quality of the fishes was not very good, the other food were also so so.. although I am aware that the buffets during festive seasons are compromised mostly, but I was expecting a better experience - all in all good for a one time try out only.

Invitation for Tasting & Review @ XII Zodiac - The Fern Residency, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Situated right opposite City Centre II, XII Zodiac is a plush dining restaurant, based on the second floor of the hotel, The Fern Residency (TFR). As of now, this 72 seater is the only operational restaurant of TFR.

The restaurant's seatings are in the form of quality upholstered chairs and sofas, hued in the shades of greenish blue and greyish green! Tables are wooden with metallic legs. The table tops are white with four linear laminate strips running throughout their length, depicting the Universal Elements of - Fire, Water, Earth and Air respectively. Flooring is black and white with abundant shine. One of the walls have informative artwork pertaining to the 12 Sunsigns. Good roadside view is available throughout the length of another wall.

This thematic restaurant is based on the aforesaid 4 Universal Elements and12 Sunsigns. Each Sunsign possesses the quality of one of the four Elements. Resultantly, quality of each element is possessed by 3 (12√∑4) Sunsigns.

Keeping this in mind, they have a specific menu for each Element, or say, the three Sunsigns that fall under them. For example - Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are a group of three Fire signs. Diners are free to choose food options from the menu pertaining to their own Sunsign, or, choose multiple options from all the available menus.

Each of the - Fire, Air, Water, Earth Menus, have their own unique food items listed under the following categories - Starters, Soup, Main Course and Dessert. Another category termed Staples is present in all the 4 afoeesaid menus, which consists of assorted common items like - rice, dal, Indian breads and noodles. Some neutral food categories are also listed outside the 4 aforesaid Menus. These are - Sandwiches, Pastas, Biryani and Beverages. The restaurant serves both veg and non veg food.

Upon seating and exchange of pleasantries, I was asked my Sunsign and a relevant info card, made of paper, was gifted to me for the keeps.

Then, in true French style, amuse-bouche was presented. An amuse-bouche is a single, bite-sized hors d‚Äô≈ìuvre. Amuse-bouches are different from appetizers in the sense that, they are not ordered from a menu by the diners, but are served gratis and according to the chef's selection alone. These are served, so as to, prepare the guests for the meal and to offer a glimpse into the chef's approach to the art of cuisine!

My amuse-bouche consisted of 4 bite sized portions depicting all the 4 aforesaid Elements. It comprised of - orange juice in a shot glass, papaya and pineapple cubes on a toothpick, char grilled and marinated with sauces pineapple slice, and a small portion of dry idli. This whole presentation was fascinating and amusing.

The following luncheon was ordered keeping in mind the preferences of their GM, Head Chef, PR personnel and myself. 

The items that were presented for tasting, were -

Mocktail, Starter & Salad -

Watermelon Mojito: Presented in a glass jar cum mug, and topped with lime slices and mint leaves, this was by far the best fruit Flavored Mojito that I have had till date. Colored in a warm hue of reddish pink, this mocktail came with a stirrer and two pipes, and was a clear heart winner. It was tangy, not too sweet, and had a nice after taste of watermelon.

Price: Rs. 196/-

Salad: It was a simple salad plate that was produced upon askance during mid meal. It had ringlets of onion, linear thin slices of tomato and carrot, a small bunch of lettuce, and chillies.

Ganne Stick With Seekh Kabab (Element - Earth): Resembling like chicken leg pieces, 4 portions of veg kebabs wrapped around separate sugarcane sticks were presented, along with green chutney and a side serving of salad. Recently, I heard of a similar Ukrainian street food, apparently quite popular amongst the vegetarian tourists, and I was happy to taste one myself, right in my own city! 

One is supposed to savour the potato based kebab portion and then suck the juice out of the sugarcane stick. I limited myself to the kebab tasting. Though it looked innovative, it tasted average.

Price: Rs. 246/-

Tamatar Ki Katori (Element - Fire): 4 portions of Sun-dried tomatoes filled with mozzarella cheese and mushroom were served with a hefty portion of Mexican Rice, and a side serving of salad. The whole dish looked and tasted nice.

Price: Rs. 176/-

Sabjis -

Mah Ki Dal (Staples): It was the usual bowl of kali urad dal or black gram, topped with some cream. It was well simmered and unlike most establishments, tasted really nice.

Price: Rs. 226/-

Chorchori (Element - Fire): Native to the Bengal region, this veggie bowl consisted of - sunchoke, raw banana, cauliflower, with panch phoran tempering. It was quite authentic in taste, and the Head Chef paired it well with a steaming bowl of steamed rice.

Price: Rs. 246/-

Paneer Waterchestnut and Mushroom Kadhai (Element - Earth): It was an over spicy mix of cottage cheese, water chestnut, fenugreek, tomato and hand pounded spices. It had the right crunch, but spices need to be toned down a little.

Price: Rs. 286/-

Rice & Indian Breads -

Steamed Rice (Staples): It was a usual bowl of steamed rice. The grains were well cooked and separate sans any stickiness.

Price: Rs. 156/-

Kulcha - Masala, Cheese Onion and Hare Matar (Staples): To delimit food wastage, we ordered baby kulcha portions in 3 variations. All the 3 stuffings tasted very nice and distinct. It was nice to see the not so usual hare matar aka green peas stuffing in the menu. The kulchas were fluffy and super soft.

Price: Rs. 96/-

Dessert -

Baked Berry Cheesecake (Element - Water): This Cheesecake slice was quite a revelation. It was extremely fresh and relatively healthy. The base crust was soft and crunchy. The cream cheese and hung curd portion was light and easy to swallow. Blueberry compote and mint sprig topping provided the right balance of citrus taste and visual appeal respectively.

Price: Rs. 186/-

Palate Cleanser -

Paan Shot (Complimentary): Served in a shot glass, it was a concoction, primarily comprising of betel leaf juice. It gave the required freshness to the mouth, and also washed off the pre existing flavors.

All in all, it was a nice food experience, woven around a new concept, and experienced amidst courteous staff and warm hospitality.

Apart from la carte meals, XII Zodiac also provides breakfast services and lavish lunch and dinner buffets at relatively reasonable prices, throughout the week.

This is a great place for fine dining with family. It is also a great place for a romantic dine out. It has a relaxed and serene ambiance. The staff was very cooperative as well as prompt. I liked the complimentary appetizer they served ¬†signifying air, water, earth and fire. I had lunch buffet in here. The starters were just awesome. My sister who never happens to eat fish, liked all the fish items and ate with yum. There were 8 different types of salads with 6 desserts. What I feel is they can just increase the chicken items a few more.

I visited the restaurant few times many for its buffet lunch or dinner. The menu varies from time to time. I loved the food and 4 items representing 4 elements Earth, water, land and fire that they serve along with the starters. The fish starters they served were good. There were 5 veg and 5 non veg starters. The ambiance of the restaurant is great and so is the behavior of the staff. I was slightly disappointed by the breakfast menu which was better on the list then in actual. Non veg items should be included which was in the probable menu but missing in actual. Among the dinner menu I liked the awadhi mutton main course but it was missing in the buffet menu. The desserts included baked Rasmalai, walnut cake, muffins.

Expected more tasty food. The initial starter which signifies air, water, earth and fire, the base of zodiacs were not warm. So the welcome was not at all as expected. Place could have been decorated way better. The expectations come in place as its The Fern Residency's restaurant. For Buffet, Starters were really good. Main course didnt have much options and taste also needs to be improved. The items should be served more promptly we have to ask for it and sit waiting there. For food 3.5/5, for decor 3/5, for staff behaviour 4/5. In all it could have been better experience.

Loved the ambiance and concept of this place. The concept is about the 12 zodiac and the four elements fire,aid,water, earth. First of all I liked their menu which comprises of hell lot of options divided into the 4 sections which are the 4 elements of nature. First they serve a complementary starter which had four different type of starters and each cooked by or comprises the four elements. They asked all of us our zodiac signs and instructed us to order from those portions of the menu. However we can order from other portions also which does not really matter. 
Coming to food we ordered prawn salt and pepper, bhuna gosht shiraji, naan. In desert we ordered litchi chilli mousse and caramel coffee cheesecake. I dint like the mousse at all. It was tasteless. The cheesecake tasted really awesum but the texture was very hard. It was really a good experience but the price is on higher side which is a drawback. Would like to visit again to try the other dishes.

We had been there on a friday night, armed with nearbuy coupons, for a buffet dinner. Cleanliness is top notch and service over the top! Coming to the food, the starters were served on the table. Loved the chicken tikka kebab and paneer tikka as well... The buffet spread was nothing great, and neither did we have much space in our tummies after the starters and salads and soup... The service people were all wearing a smile everytime they were summoned and were extremely helpful. Overall, final verdict is that we would visit again!

A good concept with all zodiac signs. They have menus divided into earth, water, air and fire section which includes all the 12 zodiac signs. All the 4 sections have different dishes but some are overlapped. Another menu is present which includes all the dishes. The food quality was good, but not the best. Fish preparations were good. Chicken preparations were mediocre. Lamb pie was great.

PERFECT ROMANTIC DINNER DATE ‚ù§üôà (I hope so,not a personal experience though) 
We ordered pardewali biryani and the paneer chestnut side dish. 
We were given complimentary welcome drink accompanied by two more items which represents air-water-earth. (These complimentary items were not that good in my opinion.) 

This zodiac themed restaurant completely lives by its name and theme. The decor, presentation, overall atmosphere lives upto the mark. 
Beautifully decorated/ presented food and amazing helpful staff. 

I wish to visit again very soon. ‚ù§

Kolkata has very few themed restaurants. The introduction of Zodiac signs in menu cards is indeed a very unique concept.

Driving up to this restaurant, all the way at New Town was fun. But what was more fun was having the food presented there.

Upon reaching the restaurant, we were welcomed by smiling staff. We were immediately served our welcome drinks which was Misti Doi Ghol. There was a strong hint of lemon which cut through the sweetness and gave the drink a refreshing flavour.

Coming to the buffet spread, I was first a but skeptical because I am not a big fan of Bengali food and since we went during Durga Puja, they had a special Bangaliana menu on.

All my doubts were cleared up when they started serving our starters. For the first appetizer, they served us with Macher Dimer Cutlet. Each bite on the crust made a delightful crunch and there was not one speck of oil even though the Cutlet was clearly deep fried. A hundred marks on this item.

Next we were served Gondoraj Paneer Tikka. Presentation was intricately done which impressed me and my companions. Coming to taste, they took care of that too.

Those were the only appetizers available after which we opted for the main courses. A very special mention goes out to Thakur Barir Mangsho. It was beautifully done. This really took me back to my childhood and gets full marks for its taste.

Besides this, their Chicken Pulao was good too. Fluffy rice, tender meat, everything added up and made sense.

Their vegetable items were equally as good as their meaty items. This was something that really impressed us.

Coming to desserts, their Mishti Doi and Pantua were really good.

We also ordered from their Mocktail section Strawberry Margarita. Strong, strong recommendation. It is served in a cocktail glass, with the rim smeared in salt. The drink is absolutely spot on.

While Zodiac has A-class food quality, their staff team and service should not go unnoticed either. Starting from the manager to the waiters, everybody here takes care of your every need. Not just this, they strike up conversations and that is all you can ask for when you are go to a new restaurant- feel a tad bit more comfortable. Service is impeccable. If you have not gone to XII Zodiac yet, you are missing out on good food big time.

Located just beside Tamara-pipal tree, Rajarhat. Warm welcome from staff. Staffs were friendly and welcoming. Ambience was great. It was based on the theme of zodiac signs, justifies it's name. They also had buffet, but we chose ala carte. Pocket friendly. Went with friends to celebrate birthday of friend. Food was good, creative design. They gave different menu related to zodiac sign. One item signified, the 4 elements of universe. We had ordered sweet corn in soup, firey babycorn, puchka shot, aloo ke gutke in starters, penne pasta, haka noodles, in main course, death by chocolate,  and virgin mojito in mocktails. We got pan shot and 4 elements which includes juice and three more was complimentary. Food was fantabulous. 
Cheers!

Located near the city center II, visited with one of of my colleagues to try out their dinner buffet spread on a groupon deal at cost of 500 INR each.¬† They represent lovely ambience with sea green furnishings all around and zodiac theme by presenting the characters of¬† zodiac sigh of each of the guests on a card which is very interesting.The 2 veg (panner tikka, crispy baby cord) and 2 non veg starters (fish and¬† chicken tikka) including chicken soup were served on the table. the main course comprises of 2 veg and 2 non veg (chinese, mughlai cuisines each) including fried rice and nun and 4 types of desserts- gulan jamun, chomchom, pastry. The starters and the desserts tasted good, but the quality¬† of the main course could have been improved.

This was my first dining experience at XII Zodiac at the Fern Residency Hotel.
This had been on my wish list since it opened as i had heard a lot about its new concept of serving according to the zodiac sign.
The entry which led us to the restuarant was pleasing. The ambience was soothing with a perfect view of the main road.
The most striking feature of the restaurant is the service and the way they talk...ask us our sun signs and give us paper coasters with our sunsigns. The menu too is designed accordingly, but I felt it was a bit tedious to go through the various signs hunting for our dishes. In the process you tend to miss out many items.
We were served appetisers which comprised of juice..fruit..peanuts in roasted papad and sweet hot idlis. This was a new concept and i liked it.
The starters were good. Special mention of the crispy chilli baby corn. The soup was served hot and nice too. The main course can be worked on. The paneer and mix veg were not upto the mark and the kulchas were very thin too. The stuffings were not just adequate.

In the end they give you pan shots which was again a new concept.
Overall a good dining experience with great staff service.

Gem of a place..have been there a couple of times now..the big pluses.. The themed set up.. The unique complimentary goodies..the styled menu..and the food..the dal makhni is to die for..
Lacks a bit on the ambience..although the place is still calm and quiet..the staff is very good..especially Rintu..one should definitely try the place..highly recommended

another dissapointing overrated place very far off in rajarhat besides reflections...we went for dinner to this place which was very poorly lit...we could hardly see what we were eating...candles were lit up giving a candle light dinner feel bt they were insufficient...
they said it was a zodiac themed restaurant and accrding to individual zodiac signs they served an assortment of items; none of which were edible...the starters comprised of chicken and fish...the fish was good though...the maincourse was average consisting of a mixture of indian and chinese items like plain rice,chowmin,chicken and paneer,dal,etc...their salads were good...they had a variety of them-fruit salad,corn salad,green salad,onion salad,etc....the desserts were just fruits with jamun and shahi tukra...overall not a very satisfactory experience

Had gone for dinner with family. This is a zodiac themed restaurant. Ambience is very nice with candle light dinner. Staff are extremely polite and courteous. Snehasis gave us prompt service with always a smile. The food is very good, we took buffet for dinner and the selection was good enough, desserts though was very few. Overall experience was very good. Will definitely visit again.

We have visited the restaurant for a official get together. The ambience is really good. Its a theme restaurant. Zodiac is the theme. They have served a complimentary appetisers based on the zodiac theme which really nice, the buffet range not large but the items are really good and little different to usual buffet menu. I really like their fish starter , the main course fish item ( mustered lemon fish) is also awsome. Dessert is also good. But the cherry on the cake is the hospitality . I really recommend this hotel to all my colleague and friends.

I have a good time in this new dinner destination. The staff members made me feel very cozy, specially Tika was very nice to us. The ambiance was very romantic and interior was also very stylish. Only the food made me a bit disappointed taste wise and menu wise. I feel they should work on the variety of main course and desserts. Otherwise it's a good place for dinner.

XII Zodiac is the first of its kind multicuisine restaurant in Kolkata themed around the zodiac signs, located on the second floor of The Fern Residency Hotel. The hotel's not bang opposite City Centre 2 but pretty close to it, right beside the Pipal Tree Hotel. The restaurant is easily accesible by lift.

Dishing out authentic North Indian, Chinese and Continental cuisines they are fast gaining popularity for dining experiences according to the 12 distinct zodiac signs. They also offer awesome buffets.
As soon as we were seated we were introduced to the innovative concept of the restaurant by our host and asked our zodiacs whereby we were given complimentay zodiac coasters with individual characteristics of the signs printed on them. Hospitality of staff is excellent, as is service. In fact their management is one of the most efficient I've ever encountered. While we were waiting for our food to arrive after placing the orders, a pretty lady asked me my name and cell phone number, and very graciously invited us to the upcoming Pujo special festival that'll cater to Bengali specialities. Her friendliness and warmth of approaching and speaking to us was enough to like the restaurant even more. Right after I reached home I received messages and an email from The Fern Residency team thanking me for dining at their restaurant.

Ambiance is a combination of coziness and tranquility interspersed with light background music. The interior is largely consisting of wall designs of the 12 zodiac signs on one side, contemporary chic decor and comfy sofas in cerulean shades of aquamarine/turquoise, the dominant color(s).
Small candles are lit on each table giving off a soothing atmosphere perfet for a romantic date of candlelight dinner. Potted bamboo plants added to the pristine table arrangement. Also a charming view of the city below is one of the major perks of the restaurant.

Coming to the food, what I liked was the concept of French-originated amuse bouche served as part of a hors d'oeuvre course where usually "mouth amusers" are served gratis as per the chef's selection. As part of our complimentary meal the platter of amuse bouches of fried idli, papdi chaat, veg. sandwich and a tiny glass of orange juice representing the four elements fire, water, air and earth was a refreshingly warm welcome.
One can order the food according to one's zodiac sign here. We ordered the veg. hot and sour soup for starter, veg. and chicken 'pardewali' biryani for main course and mango cheese cake for dessert. I'd wanted the strawberry panna cotta but sadly owing to a short power cut while we were dining it could not be arranged for.
Taste of food was light, unique and very very delish. Biryani was delectable, and the cheesecake was mindblowing.

For a fantastic dining experience in a warm ambience amidst welcoming hospitable staff I would largely recommend XII Zodiac. Lastly I would like to thank Zomato from the "bottom of my tart" for gifting me the surprise food voucher that enabled a truly satisfactory and scrumptious complimentary meal at this amazing zodiac-themed restaurant. :)

Zodiac theme restaurant.. very nice behavior waiters were extremely humble ... I visited on my birthday but did not plan for anything.. eventually as it is a zodiac theme restaurant they asked my birthday to confirm my zodiac sign and after that they arranged a small brownie for me , which was a sudden surprise..nice concept indeed..needless to say that they did not add the price of the cake...

Coming to the quality of the food , it was quite satisfying as far as the price is concerned...but I would like to inform to the authority to look into the items as well as the number of items...Chinese dishes were of little variation but Indian dishes were very common .... Anyways , overall it is a good outlet for buffet in the town..

Pretty happy with everything here. I liked the ambiance and the behavior of the staff along with the food,. Taste of the items is important to me than the lavishness of the spread for the buffet and I thoroughly enjoyed that. There can be some aspects that we might not like and that was the repetition of the fish item in the starter and the main course. Even if the names were different but in reality both of them tasted exactly same with the difference being the starter was the dry version of the main course item.Will return soon again!

Easy to locate at the fern residency , next to pipal tree and diagonally opposite to shoppers stop , city centre 2 , the entrance to the restaurant on 2nd floor is well lit , elegantly decorated dazzling with a royal touch. The interiors are done nicely as well , comforable couch seats in shades of oceanic green. The ceiling i think is yet to be completed. They lit candles on occupied tables, but the lighting was extremely dim which was not upto our liking.They have a zodiac theme , we were asked our zodiac signs and gifted a card revealing 5 personality characteristics of our respective zodiac signs and a platter of amouse bouche comprising a orange juice shot , one papri chat , a paneer cube and a dice of pineapple and some other fruit explaining their zodiac significance, and a paan shot in the end of the meal which according to them helps in digestion( i doubt!) ; none of which were interesting enough to draw our attention . Knowing its my parents birthday they gifted a complimentary brownie cake in the beginning itself and wished them . That was very kind and deserves appreciation.
We ordered chinese dinner for four , which comprised two by four CHICKEN SWEET CORN SOUP , CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES , CHICKEN LEMON GARLIC FRIED RICE , BURNT CHILLI GARLIC NOODLES , FIVE SPICE FISH , BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE , FRUIT SALAD WITH ICE CREAM . Except the last item , everything tasted nice , nothing extra ordinary but upto the standard.

Now the reason for this low rating is the Service.
Took almost half an hour for the soup , another 20 minutes for main course and then a whole 40 minutes for dessert. We did not say anything upto the main course , but realising we were getting tremendously late , we asked to cancel the dessert twice , everytime forcibly asked to wait for another 2 minutes.
The lady who was sent to take the order initially had no idea about the menu , the menu catd itself is very confusing listing the items as per zodiac signs , one kind of noodles in page 1 , some kind in page 10 or 12 and so on , later they handed us a conventional menu card which listed the items as per cuisines and courses. The staff was not even sure which dessert was available , he said to place the order and then they can check if its available or not.

The portions were severely less in terms of price , just 4 pieces of fish for Rs 366 where the standard portion should consist of 6-8 atleast. Noodles and rice at Rs 256 were not sufficient for even two adults with the smallest appetite . After waiting for the entire time for desserts , the fruit salad with ice cream was hilarious! Large dices of watermelon and apples , chopped pear and some other fruit came on a plate ( few must be picked up from the buffet counter) With one scoop of vanilla icecream and honey in two separate bowls , is that this thing they took such long time for ? Who gives a salad without a dressing and topping? It was a big let down.

But the disgusting of all was , we asked almost the entire portion of burnt garlic noodles to pack . After the dramatic dessert session, we left the place without the pack which never came to our table , inspite paying the entire bill. If this is the efficiency level on an evening with just one fifth of the space filled up , i fear what will be happening in case of a full house. We forgot to ask for the pack , they ignored too. I waited for a day long to check if they give a call for apologising which they didn't.

The servers are over courteous , at times beyond tolerance! One course and four five people coming after every two minutes to ask how is the food , uttering some hundred times excuse me , thank you , sorry for the inconvenience unnecessarily while serving food, all of which let us conclude they seriously require much training and grooming for serving in any fine dining eatery. Infact after giving a average rating for service , the man behind the desk was unsmart enough to come back with the feed back form and with all stupidity asked if the serving time was issue and with a kind of audacity asked me to mention that in words. Its my wish what and to which extent i write the feedback and i dont think i need to mention or explain my ratings accordingly.

So probably a smarter staff and a better chef can do something better with this place . We visit restaurants and spend to dine out, so the basic factors which constitutes the overall experience is the food , service and value for money , if these pillars aren't strong enough to make the dining experience flawless , no place can stand its business for long, no matter what ever way one themes up the restaurant and gives conplimentary platter and shots .

Its easy to organize and focus on events , invite bloggers , advertise on online deal sites for discounted meals , and get the initial hype with a massive 4.2 zomato rating in no time , but if the reviewers who come to spend on the meal gives a unsatisfactory rating , it should be considered as a failure in the truest sense.

I must say I had a very good expeience at XIi Zodiac. Being honest I did not know anything about this resturant before I got one Gift voucher while shopping and on the following day me and my brother decided to try out this place. The staff there was very courteous and she suggested us to try the buffet and WOW....that was awesome. First they served an appatizer dish which had four items in it symbolizing fire, earth, water and air (pretty cool) and then came the starters and soup. I loved the fish item in the starters and the chicken was great too. There were indian and chinese dishes in main course. What I loved most was the tradition bengali style of steamed rice, dal together with kadai chicken and paneer butter masala (both items were superb). The desert was also good with fresh fruits and sweets. The ambience adds to delight with the unique concept of portraying zodiac signs. Overall, I wpuld suggest anyone to visit this place. The only criticism that I have is that it is not easy to find this this place. People dont really get to know that it is there. It is inside the Fern Residency and no sign on the roads. It is just too good to be in such hideout.

I seldom have restaurant experiences where my critical eye takes rest! 12 Zodiac at the Fern Residency Hotel in Rajarhat was one such!

Visited this restaurant located on the 2nd floor of the property for dinner with my family.
The hotel is done nicely and is planned well.
The restaurant is currently the only F&B outlet at the property and they gave taken utmost care with detailing!

The restaurant is well planned with seating area, enough room to walk and a section displaying the buffet.
We went to a candle light setting where the restaurant was only lit by candle lights ( a specialty here). In the dim light I noticed that the place is predominantly in white and aqua green with wooden highlights. The walls have zodiac detailings which a horoscope lover would love to read about!

They asked us for our respective zodiacs and provided us with take home coasters with our zodiac characteristics written on ( good idea)

Nature is made of 4 elements and they brought it alive with a complimentary welcome platter representing fire ( spicy pari chat), Earth ( earth Paneer chilli), water ( a shot of juice) and wind( fruit stick)
Extremely impressed with this I set my expectations high for my food order.

- The mezze platter was composed of babaganoush, lebneh, hummus, bread and lavash sticks. It was delicious!
- The mix tandoori platter was amazing and was composed of Hariyali kebab, grilled Aloo, Paneer and Gobi #recommended
- Wok tossed veggies was an instant hit among us! #recommended
- Dal Makhni was a star dish, smoked perfectly well and slow cooked in butter
- mushroom, water chestnut and babycorn kadhai which was spicy and tasty.
- thyme and olive nan, garlic nan, tandoori Roti's complimented well though I feel that there should have been more olives in the olive nan.
- The veg pulao was made well, but maybe could have been made slightly aromatic with saffron
- Espresso and Caramel cheesecake was delicious with the caramel base and coffee curd on top. It was served with a strawberry and coffee reduction sauce #recommended

In the end they served us complimentary paan shots and now that is truly unique!

The service was extremely good and I would like to Thank and praise our servers of the event Chandan and Snehashis.

My best compliments to the chef and the entire team of XII Zodiac!

Definitely recommending this one!

Went there a few days ago. New concept, decor good but wasnt well lit. The staff was good though. Food items some were good, some weren't that good and some were pathetic. Chelo kebab wasn't that yum. Sizzling brownie was a total flop as the brownie was bitter. The beverages were wonderful. The starter we tried was good. Grilled chicken was well cooked. Seating arrangement pretty good. Rs 2500 for 2 adults and one child.

We were served with a complimentary welcome dish that consisted of - A drink,a triple fruit stick,idli fry and vegetables roasted(Representing the four signs of Water , Earth,Air and Fire)
Idli Fry was lip smacking .
The lemon garlic rice was one of its kind.
The Pardewali Chicken Biryani left us craving for more ! I believe it could get a little bit dry though.
Awadhi Chicken Korma was tasty enough .
Murgh Seekh Masala seemed right out of a Dhaba oven !
It was My Mom's Birthday and out of a friendly gesture they presented a Chocolate Brownie to her.
Well it was one of the best brownies I'd tasted so far. They could be a little generous with the chocolate sauce though. 
In the end we had our complimentary Paan Shots.
Good innovation of course !
I'd specially like to mention our waitress who was a remarkable woman doing her job better than the best. 
Her continuous attention and care made the entire experience very comfortable and lovely.
Highly recommended !

Kolkata, these days, has been on and off with the rains. The clouds and the Sun seem to play hide and seek too often nowadays. However, when you find the downpours and drizzles, your mood instantly switches and you either crave for a hot chocolate or a sizzler! Isn‚Äôt it? Same here. And, one such day, I was invited for a Sizzler Festival along with our food bloggers‚Äô group Panch Phoron to the XII Zodiac at the Fern Residency, Kolkata. Trust me when I say this, I loved it.

This is a great place located at rajarhat just near city centre2 the place is well decorated staff from entry to exit are really polite helpful  and cooperate in any possible way. Now coming to food(in buffet) after getting table they will be serving you with soft drink or mocktails then there they will be serving you with there speciality zodiac appraiser which is zodiac based considering four elements water, fire, air and one more which i feel is a really good gesture, then the staters are served which is really nice to have and quality is also great we were served paneer tikka and patato popcorn both was really really good.. then moving to soup there quantity and quality of soup is really really nice and the bread used was fresh to it made the soup plus plus, now moving forward with dinner you will be served with different types of salads, raita 3 vegetables depending on days i think 1 dal basically yellow dal, 2 non veg dishes, noodles and hot garlic veg assorted breads and 4 kind of desert include fresh cut fruits and ice cream. I found all these servings really really nice and appreciate restaurant and serving staff for such a great food and gesture.. i suggest people who are food lover and like to visit new places in city to try food should cone here once and get your tongue pampered with great delacacies..

It was pouring heavily while the friends of The Feast of Life were on their way to the Press Club, Kolkata one rainy afternoon. They were frantically looking for the car which would take them to XII Zodiac, The Fern Residency Hotel‚Äòs latest offering at Rajarhat. Although the friends had no clue that they would find themselves at the receiving end of a storm at the end of the day, but upon reaching the venue they found themselves amidst a storm of a different kind altogether:¬†a culinary spectacle¬†which was enough to match the weather outside.

First and foremost, this restaurant provides best hospitality in the city . Though they were serving quite a few guests on a Saturday afternoon, the staffs were attending each and everyone individually with smiling faces, taking care of every bit of their needs. We were overwhelmed by the politeness and attitude of every staff.¬† Interior is classy, soothing and feels good.
Their Zodiac based menu is unique and nothing but gimmicky. They serve you a platter denoting¬† 4 Zodiac elements complimentary. But, fortunately it is not where all the good things end, rather it just starts.
Come to their foods. Mind-blowing as well. The Jade chicken soup was delightfully well prepared. Even after finishing one bowl, I bet, you will crave for more.
The Tandoori Mahi Tikka may not have out-of-world taste, but it was fair enough to consume as the stater.
As, they were running Sizzlers Festival, we opted for few sizzlers. I must admit they made every sizzler (containing chicken/fish and rice, fried potato, corn, brocoli, and few other english vegetables) with great care. Sizzling Basa with Cheddar Cheese and Sauce was something¬† you will order everytime you visit. Blackened chicken with burnt garlic sauce was lip-smacking, finger licking good.
But the showstopper was the¬† TEXAS APPLE CRUMBLE PIE. God!!!!! I can do every sin for having that. This sizzlers desert was something you simply can't afford to miss. The next dessert Date and Walnut Pancake with Ice Cream was a bit of put off. Not bad by any mean, but not as good as the previous one.
This restaurant simply made my day. Thanks to the management and every staff for giving us a memorable afternoon.

Food tasting at the Sizzler Festival, XII Zodiac at The Fern Residencies

XII Zodiac at Fern Residency has brought amazing Sizzler Festival when it is drizzling outside. Maybe the Sizzling platter will be good enough to wake your senses up in this gloomy weather outside. This festival starts from 21 August and ends on 28 August 2016. The menu has got awesome vegetarian and non-vegetarian sizzler options along with couple of options for desserts as well. On top of this you can order some really refreshing mocktails here at XII Zodiac, the first sun sign based restaurant in the town (located just beside the Tamara Pipal Tree, close to the City Centre 2 mall in Rajarhat). As you must have read in my previous blog posts about XII Zodiac, this place has got an excellent calm ambiance with suave furniture and lovely spherical glass lamp shades. The color combination of blue, white, brown is really soothing with bamboo shoots placed on every table. The place has got wall art depicting the food preferences for every sun sign, which is really interesting and fascinating.

It is monsoon and you would definitely prefer to have something hot and sizzling on your plate. The best option to satiate your craving is the ongoing Sizzler Festival at the Fern Residency, Rajarhat New Town. Now sizzlers are something which we all love ! When it‚Äôs raining outside, sizzlers serve to be the best option for a perfect meal. The bustling sound of the sizzler and it‚Äôs unique smoky flavour, including the overall presentation makes it something irresistible!

Bored in this gloomy monsoon weather? Wondering how to jazz up the mood? Why not have some sizzlers? Sizzlers have been called by many ‚Äòthe complete meal‚Äô since they come to the table complete with mains, sides & sauces. Not only gastronomical, the delight is visual as well! The hissing sound makes you go crazy (in a good sense) while onlookers are bound to be startled. Add to that the smokey aroma infused into the food by the burnt veggies & butter. Personally I‚Äôm a big fan of sizzlers, be it continental or fusion oriental. However choice of sizzlers at regular restaurants are limited, or too regular due to having the same item many times over.
Fret not, that‚Äôs where the monsoon sizzler festivals ............

I had visited XII Zodiac on Sunday, 14th of August. We went for the vegetarian buffet and were pleasantly surprised with the choices!
The crispy chilli babycorn and chole ki tikki served as starters were really tasty. From the main course, the vegetables were flavoursome and the breads were served hot on our table. Pleasant staff, good ambience and great food make XII Zodiac a good place to try!

It is only possible to give a 1 out of 10 but I would have given 0. Awful service by the waiters. I went for buffet this independence day. Super slow service. They were not giving a second helping of the starters we wanted. We had to ask them many times to give us a second helping. In the end I didn't get a second helping of the starters. The food was average  but very few items in the buffet. Had a very bad experience. Don't go for it. There are plenty of different restraunts to choose from. And what I'm saying trust me. I am a food lover and have tried many buffet in town. By this one by date is one the most awful experiences I have ever had.

Over a lunch on Saturday with family, I tried this place. Nice set up and soothing ambience. The staff are good especially Tika who took special care of my family. We settled for non veg buffet. The set up had veg and non veg buffet in Indian and Chinese cuisine. The presentation of buffet was not that attractive. It can definitely be done in a better way when compared with other restaurants in competition in the vicinity of the area. The food was good but it just fell a little short of what I expected....... that extra bit of fineness was missing if you know what I mean. My family loved the soup, chilly fish in gravy and hakka noodled while I loved the Indian bread (butter naan), dal taka,  matar panel with papad. The starters, Indian breads and roasted papadums were served hot directly on the table upon request. The staff was courteous enough to tell about these items that were missing in the buffet setup on display. They also asked us for another repeat on starters. We loved the deserts. Icecream and rasgullas were also offered which we didn't try though. Pocket pinch - with 650 plus taxes I found this buffet a bit expensive than others around and in the vicinity of this area. A customer wouldn't mind paying Rs 816 per person all inclusive if the buffet came in with little more style and loudness. 

Another visit??????? Not sure but my heart says why not.....

Dined in with family. They had a gala performance tonight. Indeed the singers were doing a splendid job but considering the small area the voice was shrilling and it got very uncomfortable for a family. On requesting the manager Mr. Mithun Das to lower the mic volume he very arrogantly replied " Hum kuch nai kar sakta hai". What do you expect when you get such a reply at a restaurant where you are paying exorbitant prices. Yes we left the place. Was a disgrace for the band members who were doing such a great job. Can't blame anyone else but the service manager.

Great place amazing food superb concept and great personalised service. We went as a family and had various kind of food. The menu is stylish but was a bit confusing for my parents, we just didn't follow their suggestions to go order by zodiac and ordered mostly continental food all across their menu and shared it among us. 

The mains and starters were really good. I enjoyed the  meat pie and also they served coconut ice cream which everyone loves.

The place is kids friendly and definitely a good place for a family meal.

Considering the reputation of the Fern group this place was on my must visit list since the time it was under construction. As one enters, one is greeted by the staffs and seated. Then we were informed about their theme along with condiments which were served as per four elements- earth,fire,water,air. It was a nice innovative idea from the management.

The restaurant theme is interesting as one gets to dine as per their zodiac sign. Although the food listed under my sign was kind of boring but overall they have very good menu with variety of options. Initially i thought of going for their a la carte menu but after stepping in and seeing their buffet spread we thought of going for the buffet at 650/-plus tax. 

From The buffet i tried veg au gratin, chicken soup, fish tikka, chicken nuggets, crispy corn, chicken sausage salad ,kimchi,mutton stew, kung pao chicken, veg noodles,chicken biryani & naan.
The mains were fairly good but from their starter the fish tikka was just awesome. The basa fish was deliciously done but the chicken nuggets was a flop. I really dont get it why would they serve such a mediocre item in front of this lavish spread. Anyways coming to the soup- it was good. Their sausage salad was awesome. The mutton stew was good but the kung pao again was a let down. Also the butter naan was definitely lacking butter and was little chewy not fluffy. All items were tasty but not over the top. Their desserts were good and yummy but they can add more options as there are plenty of places with better spread at this cost.Based on the reviews Their a la carte  food seems to stand out but the buffet wasn't. 

The ambience is good and their staffs are very polite and well informed. Prices are steep which is expected.

Dining at XII Zodiac is truly an experience!

Famous as Kolkata's 1st Zodiac theme-based restaurant, it manages to live up to its expectations. The food, the ambience and most importantly, the service, shall not fail to impress you.

I went there for lunch on a weekday afternoon. We ordered for Paani Puri Shots and the Chaat Sampler as appetizers.  The Paani Puri had different flavours of water and the chaat sampler was a holistic representation of Calcutta's famous chaats. For the main course, the olive and thyme naan stood out. The vanilla and strawberry panna-cottas were the perfect end to our lovely meal. 

Its is reasonably priced and the wide menu ensures everyone has something to eat. 

Wishing XII Zodiac luck for the future.

Located right opposite to city centre 2 and swissotel, on the 2nd floor of The Fern hotel, this place is based on a unique and innovative theme of our zodiac signs with the slogan of 'dining under the stars'! And they have a menu designed on what would suit one's tastes based on their sun sign, so you have the four elements based on your zodiac symbol- air, water, fire and earth and food items are grouped according to that! Their continental options are limited, though. We were greeted with a platter on the house, which consisted of titbits from all the four elements. We followed it up with Shake Me Up, a banana milkshake, Red Lounge and Death by Chocolate- all of them delicious mocktails! Next we ordered an array of sumptous dishes like Rapid Chicken with cashew ginger and sprout bean fried rice, Shepherd's pie and the crunchy goodness of country fried chicken! Our fine dinner ended with of course some classic desserts, like coconot ice cream and poached pear with dolce de lechhe, which soothed our taste buds like anything. Not to forget the complimentary paan shots at the end of the meal! And the behaviour of the waiters is really something which should be praised separately here. Great job on the restaurant guys, would love to see more continental delicacies included in the menu next time! Cheers!

The place is located on the main road so it isn't hard to find. The ambience and the place and the behaviour of the staff is really good. A bit costly but the food quality and taste makes up for it. 
The Lime Chicken Wings and Firey Babycorn are among the many must try starters. And, in the main course Grilled Chicken and Rapid Chicken along with Fried Rice are the best. The Shepards Pie is made of lamb and was also amazing.
The best thing about the place is it's a themed restaurant. Hope to visit the place again real soon.

ASTRO-DINING : If someone tells you they‚Äôre going to pick a perfect dish for you using the stars, you might roll your eyes, or ridicule the person profusely. Well, believe it or not your Zodiac Sign has much to say about your Gastronomical Desires. Remember those odd, unexplained food cravings ‚Äì Well, see your horoscope.

Day to day we find hundred and hundred of restaurant around us with finer diners, brilliant food and mind blowing hospitality, but somewhere we miss out of the fact that we usually visit places and eat there like any other restaurant, cafe or food joint. Where as ¬† ¬†XII Zodiac the new addition in the Rajarhat area at the Fern Residency have been very different and separate from others. The name itself gives u a clear idea about the restaurant and its concept. Its based on the Zodiac signs which every person on this planet has. Not only its about zodiacs but the food is also based on your all 12 zodiacs.

A very interesting concept, at XII Zodiac one can order food according to their zodiac sign! So if astrology and horoscopes are your thing, this place will fascinate you. They have an.extensive menu with a variety of dishes.

Location -
The Fern Residency, 1st floor. Opposite City Center 2 and Swissotel.

Ambiance -
Well lit and pleasnt ambiance. The restaurant is very spacious.

Food -
I happened to taste a number of things when I was invited for a food bloggers meet and was left highly impressed. The salads and appetisers were great and I especially loved the fiery baby corn, a spicier and much better version of the crispy chilli baby corn. The corn bhel was delicious too. In the non veg starters I loved to chicken tikka kebabs.
They have a good set of mocktails, and the death by chocolate was my favorite as it was really thick and chocolaty.
I highly recommend the salads here, which are fresh and verr tasty.

Service -
Service is quick and the servers are polite. I wish they had a bit more knowledge about the zodiac signs which will be very helpful.

When you enter, they ask you your zodiac sign and give you a card according to your zodiac which has your personality traits listed.

Overall, XII Zodiac is a very good concept restaurant with great food, good ambiance and a pleasant feel. They also have a buffet so its recommended that you call them and find a out about the days menu.

Those who believes in Astrology will surely love this place for sure... I liked the concept they came up with... the basics of our Zodiacs are the 4 elements... Air, Water, Fire and Earth...depending on which our sun signs are defined... Now everyone of us knows about there Sun Sign but how many of us knows that depending upon this we can enjoy the foods which will suits our taste buds??? Yeah... it is really interesting na... same thing happened with us when Mr. Mridul Das (The Restaurant Manager) explain the fact to us...

The decoration was also based on the same... starting from the glass door to their walls every the tables everywhere the concept is on...I get mesmerized with the ambience of it... Just Awesome...

Me and some of my well known foodie friends went their to give it a try... and because of our different Sun signs we tasted a variety of dishes...

First of all Rintu (The server) came up with a colourful appetizer named as "Amuse Mousse" consisting of 1. Strawberry shake... representing the element "Water", 2. Fried idly... representing "Earth", 3. Fruits... representing "Air" and 4. Papadum... representing "Fire"... yes Rintu described it to us... and good thing is that this is a complementary one...

Then we got the exclusive menu card, from which you can know many things about your taste and preferences... Rintu guided us to know how to choose a dish form it as per our Zodiacs... Firstly you need to know in which element your sun sign falls, which you can find easily from the menu card... then simply choose the dishes comes under that category... the 4 elements have all different starters, main course and dessert section mentioned in the menu... In the mean time while we are busy to decide the dishes... we all got our sun sign cards in our hand... And after having the idea right... we started our food journey...

The zodiac identifies four basic constitutional types: fire, earth, air and water.

The fire signs are Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, and are considered to possess the most energy and vitality of all the signs. The air signs, Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, are considered more reactive to external spurs. The water signs, Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces, are more changeable and emotionally reactive. The earth signs are Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, and possess great steadiness and endurance.

Reading how all twelve signs correspond with different soul food dishes, you will develop a greater appreciation for the raw diversity of taste and the ancient wisdom of the zodiac as well. Our horoscope can also explain some of those odd food cravings that we sometimes experience.

At XII Zodiac, the menu has been designed in such a way that the four different types of zodiacs can order from their respective zones. Basically, the entire course menu has been prepared in four parts, each representing one of the categories, namely fire, earth, air and water. The concept is that customers can choose dishes from the menu to which their sun-sign belongs. However, the menu does not make it compulsory for the diners to pick from their side. You can well enough choose from other zodiac menus as well without any quandary.

One of the fine restaurants which I have found is this one... Which has a unique concept where food is connected with your sun sign. I thought to be some type of gimmick but after reading the reviews.. I had to give it a try and I must say it was worth it... Kudos to the XII Zodiac team the way they have presented the food with 4 elements ie air, water, Earth and water which they say amush boush. The quality and quantity was totally worth the value. Right from the entry the team made us very comfortable by explaining us everything in details about the food.
Would surely recommend the risotto which was not their in the menu but chef made it for us . The mushroom capuchino and the tandoori items are worth trying. 
This new restaurant has been able to differentiate themselves from others like Tamara of pipal tree which is just beside them. I would say the food is way better than the food of Tamara of pipal tree.
Worth revisit. Hope we receive the same hospitality again and again.

XII Zodiac was the chosen place for dinner on a Saturday! Rajarhat's newest offering, the quite famous chain of hotels, Fern Residency. The standalone restaurant of this hotel is this zodiac themed restaurant. Kolkata's first ever! The eight of us met up over some good food and adda. 

The name itself is an eye catching strategy, but the name might be a big giveaway of the concept but it still has a lot to offer for diners dropping by and willing to explore the restaurant.

A bunch of ever smiling staff greets you and escorts you towards your table. The table is a bright mix n match of colored wallpaper strips. The entire restaurant is done up in palettes of white and blue. The walls adorn write ups of the zodiac attributes. The place has a mix of cushioned sofas and comfortable chairs.

The person in-charge, Mridul asks you about your sun sign and presents you a pretty coaster with your star attributes!!

The drinks menu is open for all to order but their food menu has something in store for all signs. In fact, they serve you food as per your sign. 

Moving on to the food experience!

We were served "Amuse Mousse."  This one's an appetizer and served to all as a complimentary item. The plate had elements representing air, water, fire, and earth.

Strawberry Milk Shake - Water

Peanut Papad Masala - Fire

Fried Idli with sweet and sour sauce - Earth

Mixed fruits (three types) - Air

Our server for the evening, Rintu made us feel comfortable throughout. He was never too far from the table nor overpowering us. He was like an invisible person who ensured the soiled plates were changed from time to time, the food was hot, and he never forgot to wear his smile.

MOCKTAILS

- Earthern Apple: A well blended juice of fresh carrot and apple juice. The juice was quite fresh and refreshing.

- Strawberry Margarita: Sweet and Tangy blend of strawberries and ice served in a lemon rimmed glass. The distinct taste of each element would come out gracefully.

- Red Lounge: A blended juice of fresh pineapple, apple and melon juice. By fresh they mean fresh, the juices were made in-house.

- Fresh Fruit Mojito: Needs to further explanation. Class mojito flavor.

- Stay Cool: The name catches one's interest. The drink looks like a blue lagoon would but it's not. The mix of lemonade, lime juice and blue curacao makes it  a fine mocktail.

- Death by Chocolate: A sinful chocolate drink. Cleanses your system, and you need such drinks once in a while to keep you happy!

- Shake Me Up: A banana and chocolate drink. Order it only if you prefer a dominated flavor of banana.

- Kiwi Ice Tea: Kiwi is eaten in many forms but the ice tea stood out in all its flavor.

STARTERS (Veg and Non-Veg)

- Grilled Panzanella: A salad mix of eggplant, veggies, ricotta and goat cheese.

- Fiery BabyCorn: Deep fried baby corn in a spicy semi-gravy sauce.

- Veg Shammi Kebab: This was so, so good. You honestly won't miss your meat if you eat this!!

- Thai Chicken Salad: Shredded chicken mixed in a spicy sauce. Yumminess filled in every bite.

- Tulsi Kebab: Tulsi for "Basil," "basil' for "green." Hence, you have your tulsi kebab! Chicken kebab with a greenish texture.

- Poppy Mustard Chicken: An innovative dish, the meat is fried with a coating of poppiness!

- Corn Bhel: This comes with a warning of eat as soon it lands on the table!! Served in a flower like setting, the papad looks like a flower with lots of corn bhet chat mix inside it.

- Sheekh Kebab: Soft, succulent meat kebabs. Melts in your mouth...accompanied with some minty, green chutney...perfect starter!

- Chicken Pakoda: The very known taste of chicken pakoda, not much extras in here. Needs to eaten hot!

- Chicken Tikka Kebab: The hotel's Indian dishes especially kebabs are extremely recommended. This one's no different!

- Chicken Dilnashi Kebab: The star of the evening!! Perfect, oval shaped kebabs filled with cheesy happiness. Fried in dollops of butter, I could have eaten an entire plate of this heavenliness!!

- Kakare Kaju ki Tikki: Such innovation! It looks very similar to the elongated vegetable chops we have. This version was way too heavy, way to filling. Good option to order!

Sadly, I could not continue for dinner with my blogger friends. I had to bid adieu before dinner. But from what I heard, the dinner was no less. The menu was actually charted out to suit your signs!! I have had an amazing experience here and would come back for more!! Special mention for Arindam, the General Manager, he was a cheerful, extremely experienced person who shared his insights and thoughts.

Highly recommended!!

Mushroom cappuccino soup and fiery babycorn is recommended...

XII Zodiac added to the delight of our Father's Day celebrations. The ambience was warm and welcoming, and we were only pleased to discover that the food too lives upto the mark. The concept of zodiac-based cuisine appealed to us for its sheer novelty, & the restaurant has taken adequate care to stay true to its theme in more ways than one. We mainly tried Chinese cuisine. It was quite delectable. My sweet tooth was satiated by their beverage "death by chocolate", as well as their dessert chocolate mousse. The staff were immensely courteous and hospitable. Overall, we had a pleasant evening.

New place in rajarhat, very well located. The concept of this restaurant is very fresh, it gives you a chance to dine according to your zodiac sign.even the menu is as per zodiac. They would serve you a complimentary dish representing 4 elements and is pretty to look at and good to taste.we were also served complimentary drinks which was aam wanna, which was again good. We had butter naan and kadhai chicken. The chicken could have been softer but other than that both the things were good.the soup n gulab jamun were also of good standard. The staff is friendly and service is fast. Would love to come back here!

A multi-cuisine with a new approach not only in the food way but also conceptualisation. This restaurant is all about indulging in dishes that are best-suited for your sun sign. Was invited for the launch of their new Gujarati food festival which starts on the 17th of June.

Location : Zodiac XII is a part of the Fern Residency at Rajarhat. If you are travelling between Chinar Park and City Centre 2, one is sure to locate it on the right hand side.

Decor and Ambience : The 72-seater offers a relaxed ambience with easy-on-the-eyes d√©cor. Overlooking the main street on one side, the ceiling is draped in peacock blue fabric that is tucked behind the wooden beams. The chairs too are of the same colour along with the wall on the other side, which carries snippets on the 12 signs of the zodiac. The wall have carvings of different zodiac signs and a few lines written about each which nearly matches. The newness being , the food and the palate of each of the zodiac.

Staffs : The staffs are indeed amazing. The GM himself came in to welcome us. The floor manager , Mr. Mridul, made sure everything is spic and span. The chef, Mr. Raju made all the attempts to make the dishes as tasty as it could be made. The hospitality did mesmerise me.

Food: Absolutely loved the concept that a multi cuisine is making an attempt of introducing a cuisine which Kolkatans are not aware of - Gujarati cuisine. The notion of Gujarati food being bland has been defied by the experiments made by the chef.
Starters -
1. DHOKLA -	It is made with a fermented batter derived from rice and split chickpeas. The sweet tamarind chutney and the green chilli chutney, with chopped coconuts used for garnish and the soft dhokla will definitely turn you crazy.

2. FARALI PATTICE VADODARA - this is something quite fresh for the palate. farali pattice is quite similar to the north Indian Aloo tikki, fresh grated coconut and fresh, coriander leaves are added, Stuffed with peanuts, cashews and raisins.

3. MASALA KHAKHRA - Khakhra, a famous Gujarati snack is made from whole wheat flour, salt, oil and water. The dough is rolled out and cooked on a tava with pressure applied till crisp. A much recommended dish.

4. CHAKLI - it is a much new tinge to the palate, Chakli is typically made from flours of rice, bengal gram and black gram.

Main course	
1. LAUKI THEPLA - This is one of the best theplas that i have tried. Spiced bottle gourd, whole wheat flat bread. Tastes great.

2. UNDHIYU METHI MUTHIA - made from chickpea flour and fenugreek leaves. This dish is a lip smacking one. A must try.

3. KADHI BHARUCHA - a typical gujarati dish - Fried chickpea pakoris in a beautiful seasoned pool of chickpea gravy is something you will relish.

4. LEHSUNI BATATA	 - this is spicy baby potatoes with garlic flavour curry. Although i felt the garlic flavour was missing given to the amount of other spices added.

5. TREVTI DAL - For a person who hates dal, it takes a dish to superb for it to be superliked . The trevti dal nails it all with its tangy and mildly spiced flavour. The name suggests it is made with three types of lentils.

6. GUJRATI MASALA BHAT - For me the numero uno. The yoghurt dipe, the mango sliced up and the roasted papad as an accompaniment. The kurkure bhindi with the masala bhat Made with Vegetable and spices was just made too perfectly.

7. KORU KUKRA NU SAAK - Who says Gujarat is all about veggies? The Famous Chicken preparation with the flavour of garlic and curry leaves kills in all. Teams up well with a naan and you will relish it.

8. SOURASHTRA FISH CURRY - yet another non- veg delicacy. The Fish Curry with the flavour of coconut is yet an authentic gujarati delicacy which is made amazingly.
	
Dessert-
1. MOHAN THAL -	Its Made out with Gram flour, milk, sugar,ghee,almond and pista. The hard stature melts in your mouth. And the remnants, its sugar crackling in your mouth and desi ghee that lingers on your taste buds.

2. GUJRATI KARANJIAS - Now 	It‚Äôs a kind of fried Gujia stuffed with coconut, mewa, raisin, cashew stuffed in and soaked in sugar syrup. This is surely going to zip lock your taste buds with its rich taste.

3. BASUNDI 	- An authentic Gujarat kheer. It‚Äôs a kind of rabri garnished with pesta, almonds, kesar. Tastes heavenly indeed. A much recommended flavour with the right amount of sugar and correct flavour.

Value for money : The prices are towards a steeper end. Although the portions they give and the food served correctly makes up for it.

Authentic yet delicious food is what Zodiac XII promises you to serve keeping in mind the palate of each sun sign. So drop in and enjoy a plush dining experience. 
Cheers! !

This is a new restaurant so not many people know about it but it is worth trying. Situated in the 2nd floor of the fern residency hotel just beside Tamara-peepal tree. 9 of us went there for a office party, during our 2 hrs stay we were the only guests so it seems that not many people know about it till now. Ambiance is fine, its a zodiac themed restaurant as the name suggests it, staffs are cordial but they are not much knowledgeable about the items in the menu. ¬†Since we went there at an odd time of 5.30 pm we didn't get tandoori items which was a disappointment but the food items we got were not bad either. for starters we ordered three pepper fish, dry chili chicken and chili paneer, all of them were good. for main course we ordered roti, garlic lemon grass fried rice along with mutton jhal farezi and kadai chicken, though they were not bad but ¬†there is much scope of improvement in main course. for dessert we ordered cocoanut icecream, chocolate mousse and pista kulfi, all of them were good. The service was on the slower side and per head cost was around rs 1000/-. overall had a goodish experience.

With this city being flooded with new restaurants every month, XII Zodiac has already managed to make a unique mark for themselves with their innovative and out of the box thinking. Extensive research and thoughtful planning has finally been able to give shape to a place where I would personally happily come over not only for their food but for their ambiance. Located diagonally opposite to City Center-II, New Town, this place is an easy find. Hailed as the trademark restaurant of ‚ÄòThe Fern Residency‚Äô, the decoration isn‚Äôt anywhere fancy or quirky, yet gives a modern and elegant touch.

The first thing one might notice while entering this restaurant is the bright and transparent glass panel door right in front of you. And the countless small and tiny photoframes stuck on the door at convenient distance from each other. What do these photo display? They quirkily describe the zodiac signs which are so known to us and the characteristic traits associated with them. It is kind of funny to correlate to each of those posters and gradually surprise yourself to the extent of similarity one might have with them. Once you actually pull back the door and enter the restaurant, you would notice that even though the area isn‚Äôt huge, it can easily accommodate around 50 people roughly. The pristine glasses on your back are well complimented by the colorful window covers and the bright green covered chairs.

This restaurant is mostly known for associating and referring drinks to their customers based on their zodiac signs. Infact, once you enter the main restaurant and hop on to the portion to your right, you would see some specific scribbling relating to what kind of food a particular person may like based on his or her zodiac signs. I tried to match mine, and it was a picture-perfect conclusion. I was lucky enough to be invited here for a food tasting event on behalf of a group ‚ÄòPanchphoron‚Äô. The event was in respect to the Gujarati Food Festival. This was probably the first time I was going to taste authentic Gujarati cuisine and I had very little to expect or anticipate.

The culinary journey commenced with us being served with a small platter which they call as ‚ÄòAmouse Bouche‚Äô. Relating to the four basic concepts which lead to the formation of life, i.e. ‚ÄòEarth, Water, Fire and Air‚Äô, the dish was a perfect replica symbolizing and conceptualizing each of those elements by a relevant preparation. For example, the waterlemon juice symbolized water, while the fried idli symbolized air. The sandwich which had 1000 dressing resembled earth while the roasted papad (‚ÄòPapadam), resembled Fire. Even though this was a complimentary dish, the presentation was eye-catching.

STARTERS:

1) Dhokla: Perhaps the most popular and common Gujrati snack, Dhokla is usually made with a fermented batter derived from rice and split chickpeas, These dhoklas were unusually soft and was a perfect resemblance to a spongecake. Differing from their usual shape and size, these had a cylindrical structure. Topped with a curd based chutney and a pudina chutney, and ofcourse with a chilly, this was served with a sweet chutney on the side. The dhoklas melted in the mouth within a split second and stood out as an exceptional starter.

2) Farali Pattice Vadodara: The first look will make you believe this has a resemblance to the North indian Aloo Tikki, but this one had a different filling altogether and tasted so much better. Stuffed with freshly grated coconut and finely chopped coriander leaves, this one had peanuts, cashews and raisins to make up for the filling. Topped with a sweet sweet, this one is supposed to leave a crunchy and sweetish impression in your mouth for a long lasting period.

3) Sev Khamani: Presentation wins the heart of millions even before you actually get to dig in. This dish was a perfect example to the above statement. Khaman, which is a commonly found food in Gujarat, made from freshly ground chickpea meal or chickpea flour gram flour was the key ingredient here. This dish was basically grated Khaman served with sev and spices. Infact, if you ever had the likes of Bhel Puri, you know what to expect here.

Suggestion: Since I have quite a bit of sweet tooth, I would have preferred this dish topped with a bit more generous sweet chutney.

4) Masala Khakhra: Also, one of the popular Guajarati snacks, Made from dough comprising of water, flour, salt, whole wheat flour and oil, the dough is usually rolled out into a particular shape, and cooked on a tava until it turns crisp. Served with pudina chutney, this had variants coming in two colors.

MAIN COURSE:

5) Lauki Thepla: Gujarat‚Äôs own version of Tandoori Roti, this was made up from spiced bottle guard and whole wheat flat bread. Yellow in color, this was well rubbed with butter and was no different from a regular Butter Tandoori Roti. This was recommended with the Fish and Chicken main courses, the description of which will follow soon.

6) Kadhi Bharucha: Fried Chickpea Pakoris immersed in luscious chickpea gravy. The pakoris were crisp and the gravy was made to the perfect consistency. Suggested to have this one with rice.

7) Undhiyu Methi Muthia: Made from chickpea flour and fenugreek leaves, this was shaped into balls, tossed lightly with eggplants into some gravy and then was served with grated coconuts sprinkled on top.

8) Trevti Dal: A mild yet tangy spiced daal, this was made from three different types of lentils, specifically, Mug Dal, Musur Dal and Arhar Dal (Three kind of dals, hence the name Trevti). This had an excessive touch of garlic and I would have preferred to tone this down a bit with the addition of some raisins to balance the garlic flavor). One can have this either with the Thepla or with Rice.

9) Lehsuni Batata: Baby potatoes cooked in garlic flavored curry. The curry was thick and rich but not too spicy. The potatoes were soft and cooked to perfection. Strangely enough I liked this more than non-vegetarian main courses. Personally, I would have had preferred sprinkling of some grated coconut to enhance the flavor. Suggested to have with the Masala Rice and not with Thepla.

10) Gujarati Masala Bhaat: I was told that uncountable attempts were made just to make the consistency right and top it with right amount of spices. Made with vegetable and certain spices, this was a delight in itself. Served and garnished with crunchy ‚ÄòKurkure Bhindi‚Äô, this was served with Roasted Papad, a sweet cucumber Chutney and an equally sweet Raita with a hint of the spicy red Masala in it. Do not try to have the rice all by itself. Instead just take a spoon of the salad, the raita, a couple of Bhindis, mix it with the rice and then have it. If you are looking for a side dish to go with this one, my suggestion would be the ‚ÄòLehsuni Batata‚Äô. I have had this dish twice and for both the times I preferred the Potato more than the Fish or Chicken dish. This is one combination I promise you will not regret.

11) Koru Kukra nu saak: Chicken Curry or Koru Kukra nu saak, as they call this in Gujrati, is a popular Chicken preparation, made with curry leaves and the flavor of garlic. The curry leaves bring in a bit of South Indian touch. Personally I felt this was a bit short of spices and could do well with some additional tampering. The chicken portions were however soft and well marinated. Topped with grated coconut, try having this one with Thepla.

12) Sourashtra Fish Curry: Known for a preparation without the use of onions, tomatoes or garlic or any sort of vegetables, this preparation had nice and soft chunks of fish with the flavor of coconut. The fish cubes were fried a bit before putting it into the gravy giving them a crunchy and crispy touch.

DESERTS:

13) Gujarati Karanjias: A close resemblance to the Bengali ‚ÄòBalushai‚Äô, this one was a fried Gujia stuffed with grated coconut, dry fruits and Mewa. Soaked into sugar syrup, if you have this instantly as this is prepared, this is guaranteed to leave an explosion of sweetness within your mouth.

14) Mohan Thal: If the previous desert was filled with sweetness, this was mostly sugarfree. Draws a close resemblance to ‚ÄòBesan ka Ladoo‚Äô, this is made out with Gram flour, milk, sugar, ghee, almond and pista. Prepared in circular shapes, they looked beautiful with chopped almonds and pistachios sprinkled on the top.

15) Basundi: Gujarati version of ‚ÄòKheer‚Äô or somewhat close to ‚ÄòRabri‚Äô, this had a fine version of condensed milk with a hint of Kesar and mixed with generous amount of Pistachios and Almonds.

To conclude, its hard to describe the experience as it was my first time exploring this wonderful cuisine. I had little to expect but came out with a happy face and satisfied tummy. Every dish had a unique concoction of flavors and stood out on their own. Although, my favorite remains here the combination of Masala Rice, cucumber salad, Raita and Lehsuni Batata, it would be rude to say that the rest of dishes were lagging far behind.

So, if you are foodie and love to explore new cuisines, come and enjoy this delicious spread at one and only XII Zodiac, The Fern Residency. If not for anything else, the ambiance, the d√©cor, the hospitality and definitely the new flavors and delicious dishes are bound to deliver to you a satisfying experience. :-)

XII Zodiac - The Fern Residency is gearing up for the upcoming season with a selection of Gujarati dishes. PanchPhoron was invited for a food tasting of the items from this new menu. This was my second visit to XII Zodiac, the last time was when they launched their poila boishakh special menu.Located near China Park, Rajarhat, The Fern is a medium size business hotel with special care toward environment. Their in house restaurant XII Zodiac is a first of its kind sun sign based multi cuisine restaurant, where food is served according to one's Zodiac sign.
To say the truth I have never had Gujarati dishes apart from some snacks like dhokla & challis. In fact Gujarati dishes to me always seemed to be something made of chickpea flour, and no trace of non vegetarian items. However I was pleasantly surprised to find chicken & fish items on the menu. Surely I was excited so as to what those would taste like.
A brief review of the items we tried is given below.

Starters/Snacks:

Dhokla:
Maybe the most popular among Gujarati dishes, these spongecakes made with fermented rice & chickpea flour are always a hit among foodies. This particular item was shaped in the shape of cylinder in place of the regular cube cuts. Garnished with a fried chili & chutney, this one was served along with a pudina & curd based dip.

Farali Pattice Vadodara:
Prepared in the same way as Aloo tikki, here the inner filling comprised of generous amount of grated coconut, coriander leaves along with peanuts, cashews & raisins. Sweet & salty this was another item I really loved.

Sev Khamani:
A popular snack originating from Surat, this is prepared by mashing dhokla & mixing it with diced boiled potato, chopped onion, tomatoes & roasted peanuts, & sprinkling generous amount of sev on top. Tasting somewhat like sev puri, this one again is a snack worth trying.

Chakri:
Another well known Gujarati snack, these spiked spiral items are made by deep frying rice/gram flour. The same item made by using Urad dal flour in Southern India is known as murukku. Two varieties were served, however apart from the colour, nothing was different, the reddish one could definitely do with a bit of more chili flakes.

Main Course:

Lauki Thepla:
A variety of thepla, Gujarati variant of parathas, this one was made using grated bottle gourd. Though looked like a yellowish version of buttered tandoori roti, this one tasted quite different .

Kadhi Bharucha:
Gujarati variety of the famous kadhi which is a thick gravy made of chickpea flour & sour yogurt, with chikpea pakoras in it. Tastewise it was great to have with the rice dish.

Dal Dhokli:
This one is supposed to be a complete meal in itself. Considered a comfort food among the Gujarati's this one was prepared by booking uncooked wheat flour noodles/ bread pieces in region pea stew. Sweet & soothing this dish can be consumed all by itself!

Lehsuni Batata:
Baby potatoes cooked with chopped garlic & grated coconut this one had an interesting twist of flavour. The garlic smell, prevalent yet not overpowering the sweetness of the coconut. Although supposed to be consumed with rice, I had it all by itself.

Trevti daal:
Chana, moong & tuvar daal cooked with ginger , onion & green chillies this one is a good dish to go with the normal dry theplas.

Gujarati masala bhaat:
Spicy fried rice with ample amount of cashews & peanuts, served with fries ladies finger by the side. Roasted papad, spicy salad & raita as accompaniments & slices of coconut used for garnishing. Although the dish as a whole tasted good, the rice itself could do with a bit more flavours.

Koru Kokru nu saak:
The only chicken item on the menu, this one was a simple Gujarati chicken curry with a rich spicy gravy. Didn't know they even eat chicken, & the curry leaves do make it feel like a south indian preparation. However it tasted quite right, however I felt they could have used boneless chicken pieces to prepare this one.

Sourashtra Fish Curry:
Another surprising entree in the menu, the thick gravy prepared with coconut milk & grated coconut was great tasting. The fish seemed fresh & juicy too. A must try item for the fish loving Kolkatan for sure!

Dessert:

Mohan Thal:
Looking like Bengali sandesh, these ones are actually prepared from gram flour, milk, almonds & pista cooked in ghee. Tastes quite like sonpapdi, though not overly sweet, smell & taste of ghee dominates.

Gujarati Karanjias:
Stuffed sweetmeat with the outer crisp coating hiding the inner stuffing of grated coconut, mewa, raisins, cashews, soaked on sugar syrup. This one was good too, may be a bit too sweet though.

Basundi:
A silky smooth blend of condensed milk cooked with kesar, & garnished with almonds & pistachio flakes, this one too tasted good. In fact the least sweet of all the desserts, this one was which I liked most.

Overall I had a great time trying out the various Gujarati dishes, most of which I didn't even know that existed. Liked the starters, or rather snacks to be specific. If you are looking for some new delicacies XII Zodiac is the place to go. Don't be put off by the 'Gujarati' tag, as my experience taught me, don't judge a cuisine by its name. The prices surely are a bit on the steep side, but then again for an authentic taste in a premium restaurant you have to pay a bit extra. Hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as we did.
Happy Eating,
Cheers!

This was my second visit to XII Zodiac which is housed in the Fern Residency and this time I had the opportunity to feast on some amazing Gujarati food that is actually quite rare to find in the city. To be very frank, before this Gujarati food tasting happened to me I had only tasted Gujarati snacks like Dhokla and Khakhra, but never had an opportunity to have an entire Gujarati meal. Also as a matter of fact, I was pretty skeptical about this Gujarati dinner thing since I thought it will be an entirely vegetarian affair which I so deadly try to avoid on a Saturday night! :) But I was more than pleasantly surprised when I discovered the Gujarati food items Fern has come up with that has more to it and it‚Äôs actually extremely interesting, well planned out and in the end quite soul-satisfying. It might actually require you to come down to Fern and taste these Gujarati dishes to believe what I am trying to say here! I can assure you this will only leave you enthralled and in disbelief that sitting in Kolkata you can get such amazing cuisine that is really not readily available in the city.

XII Zodiac which we know by now is Kolkata‚Äôs first Sun-sign based restaurant has attracted loads of eyeballs for its elegant interiors and rightly priced flavorful food. Coming to the location, this is located at Noa Para, Rajarhat quite close to the busy Chinar Park crossing beside the Pipal Tree Hotel. Just as a piece of information - there is car parking space available inside the hotel premises for XII Zodiac restaurant guests, so you need not worry about that.

The interiors of Fern Residency as well as XII Zodiac have always impressed me. It is not gaudy and the overall finish simply exudes class and warmth. The solid white top table, glass and wooden finished walls, lovely blue couches, everything sets a right note that ultimately comes together to create the symphony that helps you settle down real fast. The hanging spherical glass lights over the tables are charismatic as well and create a mystic dramatic environment which is more than captivating. But anyway, the plus point is very evident ‚Äì this light is perfect for clicking food pics, for sure :)

Coming to the food, loads of Gujarati delicacies are brought together to build one entire elaborate menu that starts with appetizers and goes up to desserts. In fact here at XII Zodiac you will be served a pre-appetizer that is called amouse bouche, it comprises of various food specimens that signifies air, fire, water and earth, like for air we have specimen of sandwich, for water we have water melon juice, etc. Anyway coming back to the items I had tried with my Panchphoron fellow foodies, here they are:

::: STARTERS :::

a) Dhokla: We started off with the most common and most popular Gujarati dish. Dhokla is basically made of a fermented batter derived from rice and split chickpeas that results in a fluffy cake to be tasted with tangy tamarind chutney. Here the dhoklas were cylindrical and tasted really good. 

b) Farali Pattice Vadodara: Talking about the presentation, all these dishes were very nicely presented and this was no exception. Farali Pattice is actually quite similar to the North Indian Aloo tikki, it has got the fresh grated coconut and fresh coriander leaves in it and it is stuffed with peanuts, cashews and raisins. It was a lovely starter for sure.

c) Khandvi: These looked basically like aloo tikki to me and it has a yellowish tinge to it. These are tightly rolled bite-sized pieces, and are primarily made of gram flour and curd. It tasted nice though it was not that soft or bouncy.

d) Sev Khamani: Sev Khamni is basically is grated khaman that is served with sev and other spices. It is prepared in bhelpuri style with chopped onion, tomatoes, nuts, etc in there. This is worth a try.

e) Masala Khakhra: Khakhra as we know is a famous Gujarati snacks is made from whole wheat flour, salt, oil and water.  The dough is rolled out and cooked on a tava with pressure applied till crisp. In the end the result was fabulous and very authentic for sure. The crispiness to the khakhra was just right, you just can‚Äôt miss this.

f) Chakli: It is typically made from flours of rice, Bengal gram and black gram, there is nothing noteworthy to mention about chaklis here, but they are nicely prepared anyway and with this item we come to an end to the starters section.

::: MAIN COURSE :::¬†
a) Lauki Thepla: This tandoori roti looking yellowish item looked pretty run of the mill but tasted really nice. They were made out of spiced bottle gourd and whole wheat flat bread.

b) Undhiyu Methi Muthia: These were kinda shaped like elongated veggie balls which were actually made from chickpea flour and fenugreek leaves. Tasted good if not great.

c) Kadhi Bharucha: These are the fried chickpea pakoris in a beautiful seasoned pool of chickpea gravy. Tasted really nice!

d) Dal Dhokli: Well I simply loved this dal, it was bit sweet and soothing in taste. This is a Gujarati dish made by boiling thick wheat flour noodles in a pigeon pea stew. Worth a try!

e) Lehsuni Batata: Again I loved this dish since I love preparations primary made with potatoes. This was basically a full spicy baby potato very well cooked with garlic flavored curry.

f) Trevti dal: This was a tangy and mildly spiced dal made with three types of lentils, it tasted good and went good with the Lauki Thepla.¬†

g) Gujarati Masala Bhaat: As the name goes it is a flavored fried rice dish made with vegetables and spices, it has fried ladies fingers by the side and raita, papad and salad to go with. It was nice and was the only rice dish but I felt it lacked some flavor and was touch low on saltiness.

h) Koru Kukra nu saak: This was the only chicken dish on the menu. The famous Chicken preparation that Gujaratis relish with the flavor of garlic and curry leaves. Tasted really nice and it‚Äôs surely worth a try, it is bit spicy, but not too much.

i) Sourashtra Fish Curry: This was the best non-veg item for sure. The fish in there was fresh and boneless. The fish curry was prepared very well with the flavor of coconut. Must try!

::: DESSERT :::

a) Mohan Thal: These are Gujarati sweet dishes made out of gram flour, milk, sugar, ghee, almonds and pista. Somewhat looked like circular Bengali sandesh, but was not that overtly sweet.

b) Gujarati Karanjias: 	It‚Äôs a kind of a fried Gujia stuffed with coconut, mawa, rasin, cashu and soaked in sugar syrup, nice to taste!

c) Shrikhand:	This is familiar to many actually. It is an Indian sweet dish made of strained yogurt and generally flavored with saffron, cardamom or diced fruits. Here the stuff was prepared really well, hopefully it will suit your palate as well.

d) Basundi: It is a kind of rabri garnished with pesta, almonds and kesar. It‚Äôs served in a small bowl and it tasted very nice, I specially liked it for not being too sweet.

That concludes the Gujarati menu which was tasted here at XII Zodiac. The service was pretty good and prompt, though I guess the servers should be bit more informed. Hopefully people will get to know about this place and I guess if they keep on working hard with sincerity that day is not so far away, I wish the team the very best and surely this place has got all the potential according to me. Way to go!

Cheers!

Ambience: very nice and classy.
Hospitality: well better than most other places. They will make sure everything is perfect.
Food: Was good we ordered mixed veg and dal makhani . Dal Makhani was amongst the best I ever tried.I definitely recommend it.
So I would say give it a try they would surprise you with their themed attractions.
Note:- please add Libra on the glass wall as well.

I went for dinner with my wife on 14May2016. Ordered few veggie dishes which were good.. till this point it was a nice experience but then we had a really terrible sight when we ordered fresh fruits with vanilla ice cream in dessert.  The way it was served was absolutely pathetic.  We all can have a better looking fruit plate at home then what got there. Instead of presenting this in menu as dessert it was like a breakfast plate. Guys think seriously about this item in your menu.

It's one of those restaurants where the ambience will keep you entertained with its unique zodiac style.
Coming on to the starters, tandoori items were amazing especially the tandoori Mahi tikka and Firey babycorn deserves a special mention. 
The mughlai cuisine is not heavy and you can consume a good deal without feeling stuffed. Also, the portion size will make you happy about what you are paying.
The fish, rice, chicken and roti everything was one of its kind especially the Chingri malai curry was finger licking good. 
Friendly environment and pocket friendly bill will make one come back again and again and again and again...............

Food tasting event for Bengali Food Festival 2016 on Poila Boishakh - 

I was invited to the Poila Boishakh food tasting event held at ‚ÄòTwelve Zodiac‚Äô multi-cuisine restaurant housed in the Fern Residency Hotel at Rajarhat, Newtown. The ‚ÄòTwelve Zodiac‚Äô is Kolkata‚Äôs first Sun-sign based restaurant and it has lined up an array of delicious and authentic Bengali dishes to tickle your ‚Äòbangali‚Äô taste buds on the occasion of this Poila Baisakh, and this occasion is a very special one for all the Bengalis across the globe. Though we celebrate the English New Year but Poila Boishakh remains very close to our heart, it is the time to unite with your entire family, spend some quality time with them and also it is the time to celebrate with our loved ones. And having a scrumptious Poila Boishakh lunch or dinner is almost compulsory for us :) So we have a great option here, the Bengali Food Festival at The Fern will offer the Bengali delicacies from April 14th to April 16th this year. At this event we could taste the dishes that will be offered during this period.

Location - - - - - The Fern Residency Hotel is located very close to Chinar park crossing ar Rajarhat, if you are approaching it from City Centre 2 then it will come to your left hand side before you reach the Pipal Tree Hotel, it is just beside the Yokohama showroom. You can park your car inside the hotel premises.

Ambiance - - - - - The hotel has a very classy and urbane interior d√©cor and the Twelve Zodiac restaurant is located there on the 2nd floor. The restaurant has a partition in between, not sure if that can be removed. The furniture is very elegant and the ambiance is pretty relaxed and calm, it takes a lot less time to settle down if you are at a place like this. The colors that dominate the place are blue, white and grey with wooden-finish walls. On this occasion the dishes were all put on display at one side of the restaurant which was very well lit.   

Food - - - - - Age old delicacies from the kitchens of villages of undivided Bengal will be on the menu during the 3-day long Bengali Food Festival. As I‚Äôve said above people loves to unite with their family and loved ones, or rather with their roots during this time, and these items on the menu will surely help them revisit those roots somehow or the other. The spread is really awesome and savoring so many authentic Bengali dishes at one shot is a great feeling and indeed very much filling as well :) 

So let me just run through the featured dishes ‚Äì Kumro Fuler Bora, Bok Fuler Bora, Murshidabadi Murgi, Begun Pora, Macher Matha Diye Jhuro, Dhakaiya Murgir Kebab, Pabda Mach Bhaja, Eachor Chingri, Dinaj Purer Kosha Mangso, Macher Matha Diye Muri Ghanto, Basanti Pulao, and many more. 

The Bengali Food Festival spread will have loads more than these few featured dishes. On this food tasting event we had the privilege to preview few special items from this huge Food Festival menu. I tired their Mirpuri Badami Sarbat, and Aam Pora Sharbat  among the mocktails, both were very refreshing, if you like your thirst quencher to be bit diluted then you will love these. I have also tried their Bhaja Muger Dal with rice and it tasted good, I could smell the fresh ingredients used in that dal which was thick as expected and very much Bengali to its core, I finished it off even without the rice! The Aloo Posto was nice but it was not dry, it had some semi-thickish gravy and tasted good but when I found some onions in it and when I spoke to the Chef they informed they have added some tadka to the Aloo Posto which was bit unconventional according to me. The Chhanar Dalna was fresh and bit tangy with a thick gravy, Executive Chef Mr.Roy informed it just had onion and tomato paste in it that does all the trick. I also tried the Basanti Polao which had subtle flavors and aroma to it, nothing too rich. Next I tried the Rajbanshi Murgi which is basically a dish from the Rongpur district and quite spicy to suit the North Bengal palate, it is a chicken curry with garlic, turmeric, ginger and potatoes in that thick stew. The Parshe Maachh er Jhal was nice and fresh, the dry and bit spicy curry was going good with that fresh fish. The gravy was made by grinding fresh mustard and chillies, Chef said the dish had all the flavors from these two ingredients and from their correct proportions. Overall all the dishes tried were good and with a much more extended menu you can surely guarantee a great feast. 

Also just wanted to mention that this Poila Boisakh menu launch event was graced by the presence of admired personalities like Tollywood actress Suchanda Vaaniya, and Painter Wasim Kapoor. 

Service - - - - - The place has got really prompt and friendly staff. They are courteous and very flexible, the Executive Chef took out the time and was standing there beside me while I had my meal explaining every dish that I was having, really I am thankful for these insight and support. Service plays a very vital part in this industry and I am sure they will do well in this department.  

Overall - - - - - You should try out this new place and specially if you are near/at Rajarhat Newtown area. The business hotel with its urbane d√©cor, and relaxed elegant ambiance of the restaurant will surely make your experience a pleasant one. A great addition to the culinary map of Newtown Rajarhat area. So let‚Äôs make this Poila Boishakh really special with the choicest delicacies of Bengal. You will get these Lunch and Dinner buffet at INR 899 plus taxes on these three days starting from 14th April. Come and enjoy this lavish spread of delicacies at XII Zodiac, Kolkata‚Äôs first Sun-sign themed restaurant where food is served according to one‚Äôs sun-sign.

Cheers!
                                          ...

We've eaten three times at "XII ZODIAC - The Fern Residency ," a relatively new restaurant & 4 star hotel in Rajarhat kolkata , and have had exceptionally good meals each time. , the restaurant is reasonably attractive with a Zodiac design resto.  The d√©cor is elegantly modern, and the atmosphere is just perfect .The menu is standard but they will make you special dishes on request.Equally important, where the dish purports to be authentic, the flavors are quite true to the homeland cuisine.And Rahul the owner is charming.Amazing place ..A Must Visit..üëç
