Situated at the heart of Howrah Maidan serving bengali sweets. Traditional and modern both.  Snacks and namkeens are equally good. I tried few of their sweets as I visited this place few times for certain causes. I liked their sweets. Well stocked shop with various sweet to satisfy your sweet tooth. I would love to visit here whenever I can.
