On the side of hedua park, a so calles Street food place. Biggest top is pocket friendly price, biggest con is the amount of time uve to wait. Their combo s are a steal for college goers and quantity quite filling. No sitting place except a long tool on the placed on the road. Nothing remarkable.

One of the good affordable places to get fast food. First they started out with just Chinese then they added fried chicken items to it. The fried chicken items are very good. Cheap and tastes really good. I order alot from this place..

Well,I visited this place a month ago. I ordered chicken pakoda, drums of heaven and fried chicken. Well,the first two dishes were very good although the chicken was a bit hard. The place is pocket friendly and tastes good. But they take too much time to serve food,which is annoying.

I would go as far as to say that this place serves the best regular french in the city and this is coming from a carnivore like me who speaks of nothing but chicken and meats. The fries are possible twice cooked- yet remain amazingly golden and crisp on the outside even after a couple of hours (got takeout ).  The fried chicken is melt in your mouth, far,far better than the best of the colonel's minions. 

I also ordered the dry lemon chicken once- divine.

The very best thing about all this is it's affordability. An average bill of Rs 100 for two for all this goodness is a friggin steal.

This place will teach you do what you are good at never try to do anything in greed. They were a nice restaurant which used to serve quick and decent fast food at a pocket friendly price point. I visited it quite a few times n was always left satisfied. But now they have ruined everything I would never be visiting this place again. They have started copying kfc along with the Chinese they served. It has all created a hazardous waste. I ordered noodles combo I was made to wait for 30 mins n after that I received boiled tasteless noodles which were hard to take in. I didn't even taste the chicken I threw it away. I wasted the entire thing I could given 55 rs to any poor person that would have given me more satisfaction. 
Never visiting this place again.

It z a good rather the best place for the college kids in Kolkata. It z so pocket friendly. Moreover the food is better than average.
I ordered egg chicken thukpa n pan fried chicken momo through Swiggy. The delivery was prompt. Food was hot n fresh. The thukpa was tasty, full of veggies, pieces of chicken.The quantity was huge. I couldn't finish it of my own.The mono was better than average. You should not expect a great quality from such a low budget place. But surely it will beat many of the medium budget restros. The two items costed me Rs.177 including Rs.45 for delivery n packing. So you can understand how cheap it is. 
Lastly, I just loved this place. Surely I m gonna try the other dishes soon.

Pretty much a decent place for a college kid. When one has little pocket money left and is hungry poppio comes in to the picture. I tasted their roll and momos. The momos were yum but the sauce they gave along with it was too spicy and too heavenly (for me).
