A vegetarian restaurant opposite to balwant Singh dhaba in Harish Mukherjee road. Today Went there with my mom. Nice and classic interior with different kind of lamp shades. Ordered tandoori roti, Chilly paneer, aloo matar, jeera rice. Everything was well prepared and good value for money. Well.....nice experience.

Apna dhaba is a well known dhaba in bhawanipore. It is quite famous for North Indian food which is also served till late night. The tea is quite famous there. I have been there quite a lot of times and Naan ,Paneer are some dishes i have tried.

A veg restaurant which could have been a lot better if the restaurant was more open and spacious. The roof is low. Not many seats, not an ideal place to hang out with a large group. However, I have no complaints about the quality of food or staff behavior. I've also had tea and sweets from the shop downstairs and the prices are reasonable.

I ordered a regular thali from this restaurant, the food was good. Quantity was sufficient for one person. The problem which I faced was the regular thali also contained pickel, salad and papar which I didn't receive . In short I was served with an incomplete thali. Highly disappointed with it. After complaining zomato also no action was taken.

If You know the address Balwant singh eating house & if you know the Bhawanipur Gurdwara then it will be not difficult to find this food joint . Apna Dhaba is just some steps before of Balwant . 

Nice & classy interior with red & yellow lamp shades.  We orderd Makke di roti , Sarso da sag , Karhai paneer , Kashmiri Alu dam , Tandoori Roti , laccha paratha , Rumali roti & green salad . 

Karhai paneer , Makke di roti & Rumali roti was really nice . 

Sarso da sag , kashmiri aludam was good .

But the Tandori roti was burn & lacha paratha was so so . 
With all these a perfect place  for dinner as for latenight.

Starting off with the food.
The quality of the food is OK ok..
Not so great to taste in. Ordered pander do pyaza, dal makhni, Malai kofta and kashmiri aludum.
None of the item was great to eat. Roti were okay.
If some one just wants to just fill his stomach at the middle of the night and doesn't cares about the taste of the food then surely a place for them as it's pocket friendly compared to Desi cuisine..
Its rates are a bit lower compared to the other one but paying a little extra for the food which you would love to eat won't pinch your pocket much.
Delivery issues as if it's a little crowded delivery will be slow both for home delivery and if eating in the restaurant.
Not a good deal I had gone through..

At 2:30 at night I ordered for food from this place which was paneer malai tikka and they sent me chunks of plain paneer w a bit of cheese on top and NO taste at all when I called up the restaurant they are telling me that the green chutney and chaat masala gives it flavour and that's how they make it, tasteless. Then I ordered for peas pulao and they sent me plain boiled rice w one bay leaf in it which they said to manage with then after arguing for a while they sent a pea pulao at 3:50 and took back the plain rice !! Overall very bad experience.. this is the last thing anyone would want to go through when you're hungry at night !!

A vegetarian eatery opened opposite to Balwant singh dhaba in Harish Mukherjee road is gaining it's popularity day by day. Since the place cater almost 24 hrs is it getting the night crowd as well. Have tasted their food a dozen times and found it to be good at least not something to disappoint you. Their tea is simply amazing which I have tried almost everytime I ve been there.

Went there with my family recently on a Sunday to check out this newly opened family restaurant. 
The place is not big , but nicely decorated and perfect for family dinners . 

Coming to the food , it was very good . The Dal Makhani and Kadhai Paneer stands out from the menu . The Peas Pulao wasn't that great and we were slightly dissapointed . And OH , I missed the best thing we had that day - The MALAI PANEER TIKKA here is outstanding . Very soft and creamy . The Indian breads - Butter Naan and Masala Kulcha were very soft and fluffy , exactly the way I like . 

Value for Money : Very reasonable . Restaurants next door charge way more than what they charge . A meal for 2 would cost nothing more than 500 bucks . 

Overall I would recommend this place for spending some quality time with your family.

A great experience. Took a Thali. Also, for Rs 200 per Thali (taxes inclusive) The food that was served was more than we could eat. The Dum Aloo was perfect, so was the Paneer curry and the vegetable curry. There was a small bowl of Pulao and it is one of the best pulao I have ever had. The gulab jamun at the end was again rich and smooth. Would I go there again? Yes!!!

I'd heard about Apna Dhaba but never thought I would go there in the middle of the night to satisfy my hunger cravings.
At 12 30am at night , this vegetarian place is lighted up and all busy. I ordered Dal Makhani, Corn methi malai, Paneer Butter Masala , Chana masala and garlic naan. Even Jeera rice was savory.
Every item that I ordered was luscious. The food was less oily and appetizing. One of the best dhabas in town definitely. Even the rates are reasonable and the service is fast.
All the dhaba lovers should surely come here. And the icing on the cake is that is a pure Vegetarian place.

Located near Gurudwara, towards Harish Mukherjee Road (next to Desi Cuisine), the name says Apna Dhaba but it is built up as a restaurant, it has a tea stall and a mocktail stall on either sides of entry. For seating we have sofas here, and ambience is decent with dim lights. Coming to food, we ordered Special Butter Dal Tarka & Malai Kofta in vegetables and Butter Roti & Masala Kulcha. Also ordered Masala Papad along with the famous 'Doodh Cola' & Masala Thumbs-up. Dal Tarka was amazing but Malai Kofta was tasteless. Masala Kulcha was soft and the stuffing was tasty. Masala Papad was okay. Doodh Cola was served chilled and it was nice. Overall a decent restaurant with good food.

Itâ€™s a nice small eating house located opposite to Balwant Singh Eating House (near Gurudwara on Harish Mukherjee Road) which is open late for Night Hunger Pangs. The Menu consists of usual Dhaba fare albeit Pure Veg, we ordered Dal Makhani & Masala Kulchha & Onion Kulchha. The taste was simply very good and it was complemented with courteous staff. The dal was nicely cooked and kulchha was soft and easy to bite.
                                                                ...

We went to this place on Christmas and we were told to wait for 10 mins.On festive days this will happen at every restaurant, but every time we ask them about the table they tell us 5 mins and they made us wait for 40 mins.
I mean by telling 10 mins 20mins delay is accepted but this was not acceptable.We could see people comming out of the restaurant but still they were not giving us a table. I mean they knew we came there as we didnt get place at any other restaurant so thet took us for granted.
Would never go to this restaurant again.

Secound incident, we went there asked for water and gave the order we got out food but still we didnt get water. We complained amd the waiter brought a jug but didnt have glasses.He went away and forgot this and again after few mins we complained and had to shout and then we got our water.

Third, my friend got a black hair inside a kulcha. These things can happen but instead of telling sorry to us the manager telling us its your bad luck it can happen with anyone.

Totally disappointed

It was a Christmas Eve, I and two of my friends decided to have dinner at Apna Dhaba. It was the first time I was going to try this restaurant and definitely it's the last time as well. I would rather stand and wait for 30-45 mins for any other restaurant but would never ever come here. 
First of all we were asked to stand for 10 mins by the manager, but it was a 35 mins wait until we got a table for us. On festive days or rather sunday's u can't expect 100% accuracy from the staff but at least u can expect a certain decency from them towards their customers. Coming back to the main point, while having dinner I founded that there was a long black hair in the kulcha which we had ordered. Yes u read that right it was a 'long black hair'. I showed that to the manager and instead of saying sorry he told me that this type of thing happens 1 in 100. Is this the  answer u expect from the manager ? I mean there should be  basic hygiene maintained in the restaurant. 
After few minutes he realised the mistake and taking into consideration that few families were still waiting outside and this type of incident might affect there goodwill, he asked me to wait for a while and he would order another kulcha for me. I said no and we stood up and headed towards the counter for bill payment. I can't compromise on basic hygiene. It's the primary thing which should be kept in mind by the staff specially. It was my worst experience at restaurant. I would never suggest this restaurant to anyone. Thank you.

The prior reviews on zomato for Apna Dhaba didn't make me keen on giving this place a visit. But a friend strongly insisted. Anyway Apna Dhaba tries imitating a vegetarian Jai Hind in terms of decor and food menu. But it falls short in many places. We had ordered a potato starter and for main course, butter tandoori rotis, black Dal, kadai paneer and veg do piaza. Whilst the roti, paneer and the starters were good, the black Dal and veg do piaza weren't upto the mark. Maybe the order choice was wrong, and we should've tried a different variety of black dal (they have quite a few), but the one we ordered wasn't too great. The service was fast however, and pricing is pretty reasonable.
Overall, if you're giving this place a try, don't experiment with new dishes and order what you know you like, and that might prove safer, and ask the person serving at the table as to which Dal is best.
