Nu Variety is an old favorite of mine. Ever since I was little, this was one of the places that comes to mind for a quick bite. As such I am tempted to rate this place a 4, but some of the dishes aren't upto the mark. The tikki Channa and Channa Kulcha here are amazing. Every time I have those here, I want more. The dosa is a little above average, but the burger/ hot dog needs improvement, and I'd suggest a pass for that. Pricing is reasonable, and seating wise the only problem is that sometimes you may have to stand and have unless you have your car.

NU Variety is one of the oldest fast food restaurants in Kolkata. It serves one of the most indianised versions of burger you can ever imagine. The patty is red and sweet. Although this might be a place you might go just for nostalgia, you certainly won't visit the place for the great food.

One of the best veg eatery located near the Minto Park overlooking Sarat Bose Road on the left while coming from Chakraberia. This is a small eatery with snack bar kind of arrangement. I love their chola baturas and masala dosa which tastes fresh and awesome. Service is good and rates are reasonable.

This place had been around for a long time and had its loyal clientele. It's location is excellent....at the crossing of Sarat Bose Road and AJC Bose Road.It is a very small place and the seating is very basic. But the food is really good. They serve only veg food and I have tried their south Indian food and liked all I've  had. Their chaats too are excellent and well prepared. In fact all the items are good and reasonably priced.

I had happened to visit Nu Variety one day for a quick lunch. Wow!!! it was superb. Thereafter, I had dined there for a number of times. The food served was the best, in taste as well. The combination of pulao, paneer curry, paratha and raita was simply the best. As an incentive, you get to enjoy the busy street while eating...

Although this place was near my school , I had never ate from here. God knows why.
So before hitting the great booze story a colleague of mine treated me to their hot dog. A pure veg restaurant, it is a very small joint. But they have their loyal customers. Also a lot of offices, schools and houses nearby help.
The hot dog was freshly made and tasted good.

A very small joint near Minto park,a non ac joint with very limited seating (approx 6 pax).

If you are wanting well presented food,some hi-fi items and funky items,this is not the place for you. This joint something which we can compare to Ghar ka khana.

Simple sober presentation.

Food quality - Decent enough.
Prices - Reasonable. (some items are on a high pocket pinch)
Staff - Courteous but raw/untrained.

Nothing much to review for this outlet,but for sure...if you are in a hurry and have a limited pocket pinch....this place is a must visit !!!

The food is good. The masala dosa, the uttapam and other south indian food items on the menu are authentic. I would like you guys not to be fooled by the burger. They should really consider the size and shape of their burger. The lunch is very stomach filling and good. Again, an advice about the lunch. Please call everyday before ordering lunch and ask what is in the lunch. They very cleverly put in Chola of the Chola Bhatura sometimes in place of curry. At one instance, the bugger in the counter told me that he has paneer in the lunch but it came out to be oily oily chola. so be very careful about the lunch.

I came to try its famous Veg Burger, but I didn't find anything exclusive about it other than the fact that the burger was served in a hotdog! Apart from this, it has very limited variety of sandwiches, which are too small in size and tastes just ok..

The food quality is good.

Complimented with pickle, a lemon wedge, onion rings & a few tissues, the overall experience was good.

Occasionally, when I am in the area and craving for their absolutely divine Hing Kachoris, I sit out on their quaint wooden-planked protruding area, which takes me back to my college days. I don't know why the place is called Nu Variety when everything remains the same! ;)
Some of their staff who are still around from my adolescent years, recognise me till this date and I must say, their service is exceedingly good.
Inexpensive and rather basic, they have maintained their quality, service and goodwill and it remains one of my favourite quick-fix joints.

This one came as a surprise. We had some work at Minto Park. So after finishing it we were hungry (we get hungry a lot LOL). So we were looking for some place to eat. We fired the Zomato app and found this place. It basically has only Two tables and they are really close to the road. It sot of gave me a feel of the busyness on Kolkata. All the people over there were ordering South Indian food. So we ordered a PIZZA. To our surprise it was one of the best pizza that we Ever had.

I really recommend this place if you are in a hurry, on tight budget, looking for hygienic food.

Location: Minto Park Crossing.  

This is a quite a small eatery located a minute away from the crossing. 
Being right on the main road, parking would always remain a problem. 
But, is quite famous amongst the school/college/office going crowd. 

Talking about the place, 
There's no such ambiance out here, has a few number of tables, however, this place serves good quality food but at the cost of hygiene levels. 
'Never judge a book by it's cover' as all say, the food might seem of a good quality, the prices might be very reasonable and smiling at your wallet, the small seating area might be looking quite tidy, but, the work place I.e. the kitchen where the 'good' quality food is prepared isn't so good. 
If you get a chance, peep into the kitchen or checkout the footage, might let you down. 

Coming to the food, it's a Pure Vegetarian joint. 

-Serves tasty burgers which are made the traditional Indian style (comprising of tomatoes and onions on top of the aloo tikki with ketchup and mustard sauce pushed in). 
-The Butter Masala dosa tastes good (the masala is quite flavorful). 
-The Chola Bhatura is one of the items that leads in the saleboard. 
-The Cheese Chilly Paper Dosa is absolutely delicious. 
-The Cheese Garlic Dosa: Excellent. Recommended. 

These are the few dishes I have always stuck to whenever I used to drop by this place. 

The prices are super friendly to your wallet. 

Overall an above average experience (considering the hygiene level).

Being right on the main road, parking would always remain a problem. 
But, is quite famous amongst the school/college/office going crowd. 

Talking about the place, 
There's no such ambiance out here, has a few number of tables, however, this place serves good quality food but at the cost of hygiene levels. 
'Never judge a book by it's cover' as all say, the food might seem of a good quality, the prices might be very reasonable and smiling at your wallet, the small seating area might be looking quite tidy, but, the work place I.e. the kitchen where the 'good' quality food is prepared isn't so good. 
If you get a chance, peep into the kitchen or checkout the footage, might let you down. 

Coming to the food, it's a Pure Vegetarian joint. 

-Serves tasty burgers which are made the traditional Indian style (comprising of tomatoes and onions on top of the aloo tikki with ketchup and mustard sauce pushed in). 
-The Butter Masala dosa tastes good (the masala is quite flavorful). 
-The Chola Bhatura is one of the items that leads in the saleboard. 
-The Cheese Chilly Paper Dosa is absolutely delicious. 
-The Cheese Garlic Dosa: Excellent. Recommended. 

These are the few dishes I have always stuck to whenever I used to drop by this place. 

The prices are super friendly to your wallet. 

Overall an above average experience (considering the hygiene level).

So if you are looking for a quick bite or an order in this is the place to call from near minto park area... though they dont deliver at home i send some one across from my office to get the food from this place... it is a complete veg place and thats another plus point...

this place is damn cheap and have grown over the years.... earlier a very long time back this was one of the very very few places which used to give hot dogs (veg) in the city... and we used to visit here often... over the years though the quality has gone down a little bit this place is still cheap and the taste is pretty good...

the south indian in this place is a big thumbs up... though a little expensive compared to other places ... the taste is spot on and the items made to perfection.... 

i have called for the thali also from this place... i must say that was impressive.. they pack it professionally and the taste is just too good and it makes ur day, though you will feel sleepy :)
i have never sat here and had my lunch or dinner for a simple reason that its crazy during peak hours and people are falling all over the place...


all in all a great place to have a fast lunch and good food...

This is a great hangout place located favourably at minto park crossing. Reasonable and quick, great place to be at any time of the day. Its an open restaurant and has a good view. Very small in size though. Only 10 people can sit at a time. Preferably used for take-aways. Veg burger and fried idli are a must here! Even though it seems like the quality has gone down over a period of time, its still pretty good.

NU Variety - The best place to have cheap, reasonably priced and light food specially for office goers!
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Location: It is located very near to Soho which is situated at the Sarat Bose road after crossing the elgin road crossing.
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Intro:

I have been to NU variety many a times to chill out here with my friends to have some south indian dosa or a sub or burger. This place is not a very big place but a tidy and hygienic place. During the winter's or specially in the rainy weathers sitting out here and eating is altogether a different yet exciting experience! To bring it to everyone's attention, this place is a pure VEGETARIAN kiosk which is located just above the main road and with an open outdoor view towards the roads with approximately 3-5 tables. The people who are located near the elgin road or say the office people specially, this place is a paradise for you as it is not pocket pinching and yet keeps the food light making you not feel dizzy while performing your obligations. As it's situated in the main road, getting parking might be tedious.
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Food:- 

I had ordered and tried:-

1) Veg Sub - The typical indian sub served to you with onions inside and the variety of sauces (Tomato and custard) costing near about 100 bucks. It is light and good stuff. 

2) Sada/Masala Dosa - The dosa is moderately good and quite reasonably priced. The Sambhar is good. I personally don't like the chutney's. 
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Meal for two: 300 - 350 maximum.
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Pros:

1) Hygienic.
2) Pocket friendly.
3) Prompt service.
4) Convenient location.
5) Pure vegetarian.
6) One of the best places for office goer's.


Cons:-
1) Well, parking is a problem.
2) Lack of space during peak hours. 
3) Cramped with seatings. 
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Conclusion:

I love to eat here when i am low on pocket and up for some light food. :)

This is a very old food joint that serves pure-veg dishes from starting from South-Indian to burgers and sandwich. You can get mouth-watering chaats, dahi bara, hing kachori, chana kulcha and many more. Their trademark dish is Butter masala dosa and sambhar dal, oh man its taste so awesome that you would order another one. Same goes for uttapam. They also have thali meal for lunch that will serve your stomach quite nicely. About the ambiance, in spite of small space and without AC the decoration of this restaurant is just too good. You can be seated outside where some chair-table kept has cover like tent. The view of minto park is quite magnificent from there. Here coffee and tea are nice well. A very good veg-restaurant in town which are pocket friendly as well. Total thumps up from me.

Have being seeing this joint since my birth. It used to wonderful south indian & hotdog burgers. With time the quality of food has degraded a lot & is not at all upto the standard. The prices of the products are going up, quality is below average & the quantity has almost become half than earlier times. These people should give more preference to the quality & quantity of food rather just keep on increasing the prices.

I have been eating their hot dogs since school days. I was in Hartley's High school and it was 2min walk from there. So would eat it once every week ( still do) and at times two if pocket money permitted. It used to cost Rs 16 back in those days! This fast food joint has been there for 30yrs now. Their 3rd generation sits at the counter.

Anyways, coming to the review their hot dogs are indianised  as it has been mentioned by so many people already but yet it is so delicious! One does not satiate your hunger and two makes you bloated. The patty of their hot dog is somewhat close to a bengali cutlet/chop. For that matter they sell cutlets too and that is exactly what they give you in their hot dog. Its got plenty of beet root in it.

Apart from this they make pretty good south indian in their price range. its not exceptional but reasonably good. Their utthapams are nice but the sambhar and chutney is average.

Other items one could have is chola bhatura, hing kachori and sabji, samosa chaat, sandwhiches etc. They have thali/ fixed meals too during daytime. cant really comment on it as have never tried.

Its flocked mainly by office goers and school children during the day. They do lots of takeaway and home delivery at nearby places. Overall a nice place for a quick bite and light on your pocket.

Located at sarat bose road, minto park crossing, nu variety is a very old fast food joint known predominantly for its south indian food and the traditional indian burgers. The location is pretty accessible and convenient except for car parking that becomes a problem at times. The sitting area is small and congested so i prefer this place for a takeaway. The rates are very reasonable. The staff service is prompt, fast. 

Coming to the food, i love the south indian food here especially the vadas, cheese masala dosas. Cheese garlic dosas seem to be really good going by the other reviews but haven't tried it yet and is surely on my agenda for the next visit. Burgers are made the traditional indian way and are very good. Pizzas are average. Chana kulcha is another item that one can see being ordered around a lot and is really nice. The food is always fresh and hygenic which is a big plus too.

Nu Variety has been around for ages, and though I am a self-proclaimed strict non-vegetarian, when I crave vegetarian food this is where I go. What's more, I have been going there for decades. Some of my favourites here include the Cheese Onion Paper Masala Dosa (with special chutney), Sambar Vada, Channa Samosa, Chola Bathura, and Vegetable Cutlets. The food is fresh and the taste is awesome. The prices are unbelievably low, but don't let that fool you. Both quality and quantity are above par. Nowadays I don't stop by too often, but I do send out for their food. Give it a try if you haven't already, you'll be back for more!

A pretty famous place and very small too. The food is good but in case you get a chance to peep into the cashier's p.c and look at the kitchen's video you would rather stop eating there.
The place is a bit too small and untidy.|
Thumbs up (y)  1. The location and the name (even my maid says the name properly)
                       2. An average place to grab a quick bite.
                       3. Must try => burger and masala dosa.
                       4. Reasonable rates
Set Backs : 1. A bit too small.
                  2. No car parking available.
                  3. If you like to eat in a quite place with very few people around you then this is not your place.

If you are a pure vegetarian, Nu Variety is one of the best food plazas in South Kolkata that offers a wide range of options at pocket friendly budget. Located at 1, Sarat Bose Road, Kolkata, near Minto Park crossing, Nu Variety is an authentic South Indian restaurant which remains open every day in a week from 8.30 in the morning till 9.30 at night. 

I am a crazy lover of South Indian foods, especially Dosa and Utthapam and so, this is my favorite destination where I visit frequently. This place is located near my residence, so whenever my mouth craves for South Indian flavors, I rush to Nu Variety. The price of the wide range of Dosa preparations starts from just Rs. 35. Among the varieties of Dosa, my favorite is Cheese Chilly Paper Masala Dosa. I have hop around at many South Indian restaurants but at very few destinations, I found this type of preparations. Here, Masala of the Dosa doesn't mean stuffing with potato only. Although Cheese Chilly Paper Masala Dosa is my favorite, but mostly I try Masala Dosa. The Dahi Vada here is also superb and totally different, soft, a little spicy and the quality of Dahi is very excellent. The Mixed Utthapam compliments itself due to its culinary look and taste.
 
Besides these mouth watering South Indian dishes, a wide range of snacks, chats, pizzas, burgers and sandwiches are also available here. The Mixed Pizza and Mix Chat is a must have here if you are here for having snacks. For breakfast, I don't think, there is any better option than Grilled Veg Cheese Sandwich and a glass of Lassi. The Lassi is fabulous here. Anyone who tastes it will feel the rich cream of the milk in every sip. Thick and heavy, this Lassi is the best refreshing drink that you will miss, if you don't try. 

The menu chart also includes different lunch packs, prepared with different items for every single day, seven days a week. So many items and so many variations, but the restaurant is very small actually. Nu Variety resembles like a cafeteria. Two or three dining tables are arranged in that small area and there is a place for stand-and-dine. Decoration is very simple and normal but its culinary preparations supersede all its other features. So if you are ever at Minto Park, don't forget to have a meal at Nu Variety, a super and authentic Veg restaurant!

Another one of those little places that serve pretty decent food ..... its been around for atleast 20 years that I know of and I still like to drop by for a bite .... try the Cheese Garlic Dosa .... really good and they have a decent Channa Kulcha , Dahi Samosa Chart and Grilled Sandwiches. Veggie friends of mine love the Veg Cheese Burger and though its not bad I prefer my burgers with meat in them !
