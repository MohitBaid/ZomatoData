Prices are high and food taste is moderate. For first timers its okay, but i wouldn't go second time if i needed to pay. Prefer golden joy instead.

*Small Nostalgic restaurant from the 90s.The old Chinese couple is the owner of this restaurant who themselves cook the food.

*One of the best restaurant and the only place in kolkata to find authentic Chinese.(unlike other Chinese restaurant with Bengali influence in taste)
Most of the customers are Chinese locals.

*It's Pocket friendly. I am a frequent visitor. My family has been visiting this restaurant more than 10 years.

*Ignore ambience. Average look from outside. (Don't judge a book by its cover)

*FREE TIP :Be early. Most of the time Hakka noodles gets over by 7 p.m due to its high demand.
__________________________________

Best food :
*FRIED CHILLI CHICKEN (BONE) : make sure to tell them to add onions.
*CHICKEN CLEAR SOUP : because it's cornflour-free, healthy and delicious.
*CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES: their best selling item.
*YA MEIN NOODLES : simple dish of tossed noodles rather than frying it.
___________________________________
P.S I didn't liked fried chilli babycorn. It was too dry and less on spice. Not right place to have baby corn.
Chicken rice noodles were average. I prefer noodles over thin rice ones.
Chicken fried rice were also average.

Yes i most definitely know that this shabby restaurant would never interest the socially placed gastronome out there. 
But if you want to taste the best chinese appetizers in the city look no further than Kim Fa in Chinatown.
The restaurant doesn't give a damn about its appearance or capacity.
They truly cater to a handful of customers all day round and are satisfied.
Prices okay.
Must try :
Any fish or chicken or prawn starters.
Their meifoon noodles are good as well !
P.S. never expect good noodles ( Cantonese or pan fried or hakka ) at night. ! They get finished during lunch.! 😭

China town has its own charm and the place itself is amazing. Kim fa has always had the best chefs with authentic Chinese preparations being served fresh onto your plate to quench your appetite to the fullest. There are many fancy new places in China town now and Kim fa has also increased its prices but still this remains my favourite

Heard a lot about this place and today experienced this iconic place. If you are interested in fine dinning then plz dnt visit this place. The ambiance is not at all good but if you are interested in food then this is the place. The taste is awesome, different from rest of the china town restaurants. If you are bored of china town then visit this place. The shabby ambiance adds to the taste also.

Have been visiting this iconic place in China town, Calcutta for the last 15 plus years. It's a simple, basic place in terms of ambience but it makes up by 1000% in taste and flavour of its dishes and service. The chilli, golden fried prawns, ginger chicken, Hakka noodles, Thai sea food soup, boo choi are the classics

Personally I rate the food here the best in kolkata. Brilliant and authentic if u know what to order. 

Service very very slow but worth it. I am finicky about service but to eat here I am ready to let go that! 

A perfect family place though shady and non veg paradise.

Kim Fa has been one of my favourite restaurants in Tangra. They serve the best chilly chicken!!! Which tastes heavenly with the spicy red sauce. 
The mixed rice noodles, mixed fried rice, chilly fish and chicken manchurian is excellent.

One of the best food joints in tangra. 
You should insist on dining in the family room. 
Air conditioned and secluded. 

Must tries:-
Thai soup.(tell them to ease on the cornflower)
Dry chilli chicken & prawn.
Fried rice. (Preferred to noodles)

The only con is that it realistically costs about 800 for two (NOT 500)  if one wants to fill one's stomach.

One of the oldest restaurants in tangra or which we all very fondly call as our very own china town....Kim Fa has a special place in my heart. I have been going to this place with my family since childhood and in these 20 or more odd years,I have never been disappointed....Have been to countless chinese restaurants,but for me,their meifoon (rice noodles) n fried chilli chicken are inimitable....the decor is quite shanty,in comparison to the other elaborate ones over there,as such it might not look too appeasing to some....but when it comes to food,it's an absolute champion. I would personally recommend everyone to specially try their meifoon,fried chilli chicken,chilli garlic fried button mushrooms and seafood thai soup...They have an unambiguous yet laudable repertoire and in all these years, I'm quite convinced that this is nothing less than a little hidden gem...!!!

This place is an absolute favourite not because of the cuisine that it offer but because there food is authentic and very tasty .. the restaurant is a run by a Chinese family and the best part that the owner themselves cook for the guest their is no separate cook for cooking the dishes .. 
Ambiance :- 3.9/5
It's not like a fine dining restaurant .. it's a small place but totally packed on mostly all days except Tuesdays as it's an off that day ... 
location -3.5/5
It's located just near the Chinese Kali mandir 
Food:-5/5 
I wouldn't mind giving this place a 5 because I basically love all the food that is being served in this place ..! May it be the Thai seafood soup or the special Hakka noodles or the chilli chicken dry or the ginger prawns .. all of it is my fav
On my last visit I tried garlic fish which was very nice as well but then there are some dishes in the menu for which you have to call the restaurant before hand to place an order as they are limited like the Chinese special Hakka noodles 
Service :-4/5 
They stop taking orders after 11 that's the only problem with the restaurant but on some occasions when the flow of the customers is a lot they keep it till late ..! 


Overall just in love with this place .. definetly a place you should go if you love Chinese

I do not exaggerate when I say that this is the worst food iv ever eaten in my life....

I'm all for a shady looking place but this place is shady unhygienic and has terrible food.

We went here on someone's recommendation saying it's very authentic Chinese...  well I'm never going to take their recommendations seriously ever again 😛

We pretty much ordered everything on their quite limited menu and everything tasted the same.... be it fish, prawns, chicken or ve, the dry stuff was extremely oily and their idea of a gravy was corn starch in different colors...looked like slime really to be quite blunt.

On the whole I'd say that if you don't like somebody and you want to hint it to them...take them

Famous Chinese restaurant in Tangra where one has to pre-order momos in order to get them fresh and piping hot. I must say it was a nice experience for me. However my honest review would be that the food tastes similar to other good Chinese restaurants. I would not like to go all the way to Tangra to have Chinese food. Nevertheless one can try the cuisine here in order to have a change in the usual routine.

I stay quite close to tangra and kimfa is the only restaurant I dine in.the decor is not very good.however air-con works effectively and service is good if you know the Staff well.
The food here is the best you can have in terms of pocket friendliness, cleanliness, fresh produce and taste.items which are must try here are the mixed hot and sour soup which is amazing and has a lot of tofu as well.the chilli chicken with bone is the best you can sample anywhere in Kolkata. The lemon chicken boneless, jumbo prawns(by order), chili prawn balls, golden fried prawns are some of the outstanding items. The owner is running the restaurant from 1947 and he cooks himself accompanied by his wife.
There is a special item called kung-fu mien which is a mix of pan fried and Cantonese chow which is amazing and unavailable elsewhere in Kolkata to my knowledge. However they use hand made house chow which you have to order beforehand by deriving the owners number from the restaurant. It's open for lunch as early at 1230 and shuts at 2 pm.evenings are also based on the restaurant opening at 6 pm and shutting by 11 pm.drinks are available but nothing too exotic.. 
This by far is the best Chinese restaurant in Kolkata and food is very consistent in taste and quality. I feel that this gem serves the best Chinese food in Kolkata and is mostly frequented by the local Chinese population

Heard so much rave about it and wanted to try it out. Didn't visit the restaurant but my Chinese friends around the area were kind enough to order a take out and needless to say the food was yes, you guessed it right, "DELICIOUS"!!

Ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles, Dry Chilly Chicken and Mixed Meifoon. Loved everything we had except that it was a tad bit oily yet it suffices to say that it's so much worth the money.

And as amazing as it's food is, so glad to know that it's a family run business. Thumps up for that. Will make sure to visit the restaurant the next time.

I am giving this 5.0 as I haven't found a Chinese restaurant with better taste in the entire country. Here I am being a bit partial because I did not consider the ambiance factor which should score around (1/5) and the owners have not invested in a single infrastructure over the last 20 years (except probably the menu card) and yes they still don't accept credit cards.
I heard that this place was started in 1960's when Tangra was the first place to offer Chinese food in the entire country . Its difficult to locate this place because its the last restaurant in Tangra (just after Kim Ling). It is closed on Tuesday's and the owners are the cooks as they don't leak their secrets to any person in the kitchen (I have been to their kitchen).
Needless to say, amazing food - Thai Soup, Meifoon, Golden Prawns, Dry Chilli Chicken (too succulent enough to be compared with the masses), Garlic Chicken and many more. 

The rating can definitely be displaced if I find something better than this (when it comes to taste only)

Best food in Tangra !!! Been a family favourite for years now. One of the last remaining tangra restaurants where food is still cooked by the family which owns it.

Always has a rush of regulars.

As good as the food is though, the ambience / decor / comfort is not.

My favs: Fried Golden Prawns & Sweet & Sour Chicken (the best in the city!)

Visited there on a Sunday afternoon. Packed up as usual but since we are regulars we had informed them to keep a table for us. Ordered for sea food thai soup which is out of the world. Ginger orawns were crisp and fresh. Their best seller is chilli chicken which is different from other places and yet yummm. You have to order noodles from before since aunty makes the noodle fresh every morning and it goes like hot cakes. We ordered for chicken haka noodles, veg fried rice and munchurian chicken. Can still taste the flavour in my mouth. Have been visitng this place since i was a child and will continue doing so......

Not worth giving a rating...I sincerely suggest that Zomato should invent a negative rating scale for restaurants. I am sure it will help many.

 A Perfect evening spoilt by owner attitude. And a Sunday morning ruined reviewing about the last nights experience.
The very fact that I am screwing up my Sunday morning to write this review should establish what a con this place is!! The plan was to go to Aunty's a restaurant frequented by me over the past 5-6 years and had consciously avoided Kimfa as many years...inspite of having faced similar bad situations before landed up as Aunty's shut down for good..thats sad. 

Firstly one does not go for, neither does one expect any kind of ambience in Tangra except a few outlets. But, to sit in a Hot Humid evening in a room with malfunctioning AC is torture while having food/ drinks. Their AC was a relic malfunctioning hot air generator. Never mind we continued.
Secondly: Pathetic service for which it is renowned...so did not crib much other than had to blow the guys to hasten!!
Thirdly the Ice they give for drinks is SURELY the same used by Fishmongers,, hand broken...and that too was good for only 1-2 round of drinks after which they said they do not have any more
Fourthly food was just average to below par.... Deep Fried batter-laden stuff.... nothing fancy unless you pre order.
Lastly paid through the nose for the Teachers Whisky bottle MRP Rs 1870 Paid Rs 2600 which is 'fine' but the Godforsaken "Service Tax" Rs150 on that amount really pinched hard as we did not get that service at all ..

Overall a big spoiler of an evening and rediscovering a MUST AVOID restaurant!!

The AC does not function and that's a huge -ve. The highlight of the evening was the availability of Shankong. What was once their signature, Thai Soup, was a poor dishwater that lacked seasoning, coriander fragrance and the sour hint. The fried chicken and prawns were great , but the fish was bland and tasteless without the addition of the sauce.

A very satisfying Indian-chinese experience. We ordered :
Chilli chicken dry 
Lemon chicken 
Fried rice 
Chicken haka chow 
Garlic fish 
Prawn manchurian 

These are your classic tangra flavours. Lots of salt and MSG (btw msg isn't the poison that a lot of people say that it is, here's the truth, 'MSG' is found in tomatoes and in any aged meat such as beef)
Back to Kim Fa. It's bang for your buck. Very reasonable prices and 'tasty' food. The noodles tasted home-made and fresh. The best Haka style chow in the city for sure. 
The lemon chicken is popular as well.

Worst eating experience I've had in a long long time! We checked in to the restaurant around 1.20 on Sunday 21st Feb 2016.. We (2 of us) weren't allowed to choose our seats though the entire first floor was empty! The waiter didn't come to the table till 10 minutes later.. We ordered a vegetable chicken soup and a golden fried mushroom starter..
We said we would order the main course later.. He was grumbling that we should order everything at one go.. We understood the reason for it later.. In any case, we ordered an egg rice-noodles within a minute..
At around 1.45 the soup and starter arrived. Till then, even water wasn't served! That was the last we saw of the waiter! Meanwhile the other tables had filled and other waiters were tending to them..
We finished our soup and starter and were waiting for our noodle dish.. We reminded a different waiter at around 1.55 about the order as ours was nowhere to be seen! We waited till 2.15 with no indication of being served..
We then reminded a bus boy and a third waiter, who told us that it is getting ready.. By 2.30, we lost patience when we were told that they didn't know about this order! We started walking out demanding for the bill.. We were given the bill after waiting outside the restaurant for 5 minutes, of 565 rs for a soup and a starter..
The food we got was decent, but neither the quantity nor the cost was anything close to justifiable.. The service was on a completely different level! This was our first eating experience in China town @ Kolkata and its turned out to be horrible.. Oh and did I mention that the waiters seemed very attentive and interested on the table populated by a large Chinese group right next to ours as well as the Caucasian family on the table downstairs!

Honestly if you owe a treat to a group of people bring them to this place and trust me you wont be spending more than 400 bucks per head that too with a beer included, because the quantity is so damn good, we were a group of four people and ordered chicken lollipop which had 16 mind you 16 lollipops anf thai seafood soup, which we ordered large, good enough for 4-6 people and any fried rice is good enough for two persons. And i found the taste to be standard nothing one can complaint about conpared to the prie paid.

One of the oldest restaurants in Tangra, this place is one of the most underrated and overlooked places in the area. I have been going there since ages and I never mind going back again and again. It's a family-run restaurant, and though the ambience is a little shabby, and the service might be a bit laid back, delayed, everything is worth the amazing food they serve. Would recommend the seafood soup, chilli chicken dry, lemon chicken, chilli prawns, golden fried prawns (shrimp balls basically) and the mixed rice noodles. Food is quite affordable considering the portions they serve, and so are the drinks.

Went to try out this place after Adrian's recommended it. The food is descent and prices are nominal too. But I don't know I don't like the ambiance at all. Would try other places rather than this one.

What should i say about this place. Have been here so so many times that I've forgotten the count. Be it on a birthday, group dinner, festive dinner or just a casual dinner, my family and i have been a regular here. Though all their food is delicious, we usually order our all time favourite Thai seafood soup, chilli chicken, fish with bok choi, ginger prawns and shang kong along with others. Just for your info let me warn u guys, u must pre order the noodles as its not always available, which is very disappointing. But overall the food is very sumptuous. Only negative point is its parking and restaurant space which is very small. Must try place for every food lover 👍

Probably the best restaurants in China town. I absolutely love the seafood soup which they make and trust me you can never get it right in any other restaurants in the world. The second best thing I like there is the Lemon Chicken dry it's yummie  and very succulent.

I have read plenty of reviews criticizing the service at Kim Fa and talking about the ambience and the slow service. Let me tell you one thing about Kim Fa. They don't give a *expletive* what you think.

A family run restaurant where you can still see the family members slogging it out in the kitchen which is outside the main restaurant, Kim Fa has little patience for your "total restaurant experience". They serve you food in the same dishes that they have done for many years and for the longest time the bill that they gave you was in Chinese.

I remember the days when they didn't have a bar license and they would operate as a BYOB and charge very reasonable corkage. They have a bar menu now but one look at it tells you that they just didn't bother with it. 

The food, however, is outstanding. Order the Seafood Thai Soup on a pleasant Kolkata night and it will hit the spot for you. Wash it down with a beer and repeat. Maybe order another Thai Soup if you don't feel like main course. The soup has a very subtle flavor, with the right combination of lemon, coriander, garlic and seafood doing the trick for you.

Order the Ginger fried Prawns and a Lemon Chicken after that. I warn you that there will be very little conversation once the food is served. The Prawns are shrimps held together in a ball coated with batter and served crispy and hot. It's addictive and so is the Lemon Chicken. I've never quite figured out how they make the Lemon Chicken. There is a lot of lemon but is the texture of the chicken that I find most amazing. There is this very tender quality to it but there is also a kind of crispiness to it. I still don't know how they do it but it tastes amazing.

Honestly, after the above three, I finish my meal with a Mixed Rice Noodles where I'm certain that they make the RIce Noodles at home. The Rice Noodles are tossed with Garlic, Prawns, Egg, Onions and other herbs that give it a great texture and a brilliant taste.

Kim Fa is a place I pay homage to whenever I go home. I have to do that. No place replicates what Kim Fa does. It is true that there are other great restaurants at Tangra and I have eaten at those but only when I don't find space at Kim Fa. It is a family favorite and I know my father waits for us to come home so we can pay a visit to his favorite place for Chinese.

If you want to go for a fine dinner with your family then this is definetly not the place but if you want to go with your friends and drink till you drop then bazinga this is the place you want to go. Located at tangra commonly referred as China town this place is amongst one of the cheapest in tangra. Good food with reasonable cost. Quick service with friendly staffs. Dry chilly chicken, hot garlic chicken and spring chicken are must try.

Ambience wise its nowhere close to beijing. Service absolutely dismal. People over there seem disinterested all the time and hurry up stuff. Must try ginger and lemon chicken, chilli chicken dry, meifoon. But the best dish in the menu is the manchurian chicken gravy. Half a star more for that dish alone.

After going through the reviews in the Zomato we decided to five Kim Fa a try on 15th August noon.
My wife was more inclined to Kim Ling specially because of the starters.  The rave reviews by few of the connoisseurs or gourmands have influenced me to try this place. Any way lets be on the point. We ordered Chili Chicken Dry Boneless followed by Drums of heaven, smoked chili chicken. chicken Fried rice and Chicken manchurian. 
I will go each one of them individually.
1) chili Chicken Boneless : IT is not sauteed with onion/ scallions. The batter is mixed with their secret sauce and green chili paste. It tastes good but not at all overwhelming. Kim ling and Big boss is far ahead of this dish.
2) Chicken Drumstick: this is good specially crunchiness and the spices in batter made it really tasty. I was missing little saute with minced garlic but any way it was good.
3) chicken Manchurian : Terrible Never try this.  Excess Soy sauce not only made it more salty but also convincingly made it tasteless.
4) Chicken Fried Rice :  any road side eatary can make better rice than this. Dont waste your money with this.
5) Smoky Chili chicken : Again the chef totally ruined the dish its more like roasted chicken sauteed in little garlic infused soy sauce. 
We packed the left outs and on my utter disbelief they packed the gravy dish in box on banana leaves.
Avoid Kim Fa trust my taste bud. on top of that this is the first restaurant where I have seen the waiters in barmudas :) and also they wont take Credit Card.
Though I don't go with look and feel for me the excitement of taste bud is more important but still its pretty shabby and price wise its not at all cheap adding 14.5% vat and Service charge for the Christian Era's Ac machine we ended up paying 1715 Rs for this devastating meal. I now owe another lunch at Kimling for my wife. I am giving 2 for the reason that some one cooked for us and only Drumstick tasted good.

Kim Faa is my favourite in Tangra (China Town). If you consider only the taste of the food served, it is undoubtedly the best! Don't expect ambiance in this very small eatery, which is shabbily maintained. But the old couple who are both the owners and the cooks, serves really delicious dishes - made with premium ingredients - one after another. The portions are also very generous. Most of the Chinese people living nearby prefer Kim Faa for dining in as well as for take away - which is the speciality of Kim Faa - major portion of their sale is from take away. Try chilli chicken here - it is their signature dish, which the owners feel proud of. I also love their ginger prawn balls, chicken drum sticks, chicken vegetable mushroom (a bland dish with a unique taste), mixed Cantonese chow mein..... the list is very long! What I don't like is most of the days the chow mein (home made by the owners and so tasty) is out of stock even before the evening starts!

'Kim Fa' is located at South Tangra Road near China Town,Tangra beside the Shun Li.It is near from Dhapa,E.M Bypass.Today I've gone here with my friends for dinner.If we were bachelor so waiter told us to sit the ground floor.Ambience is average.Only 3 tables are here.I don't like their ambience.Atfirst we have ordered one plate full Boneless Fried chilli chicken & one large bowl Chicken Hot & sour soup.After 10 minutes the food served on our table.Boneless Fried Chilli Chicken is very tasty,crunchy & soft.It tastes very good with their chilli sauce.It made with fried onion & chilli.20 pcs chicken is in the full plate.Large Chicken Hot & sour soup is also tasty.It is enough for 5-6 peoples.Then we ordered one plate Egg Fried Rice,Mixed Fried Rice & Chicken Manchurian.Both Fried rice are delicious,specially Egg fried rice.It is totally smoky flavour.Chicken Manchurian is not so good.It is cooked with coriander leaves.I don't like it but quantity is enough for 3 peoples.Atlast we ordered Chilled Thums Up.We drink 2 bottles thums up per head.Price is moderate.Waiter is friendly.

On the day of Holi few of our friends and families a group of 30 adults hit Kim Fa. While rest of Chinatown is closed due to Holi, this restaurant was chock-a-block full. Provision for parking is outside the restaurant. On such special occasion one must reserve table and place your order in advance to avoid disappointment. Will always recommend first floor family room. 

To set the expectation straight there is no ambiance, no sophisticated servers, no glittering cutleries or no fancy plates. Its a small Chinese eatery famous among both locals and non-locals. Surrounding will be noisy too but didn't find any indecent people. It has the best food one look for from Chinatown at Kolkata. People queue outside to have a taste of the same. Taste wise it is far ahead from either Beijing or Kim Ling or Golden Joy.

In starters for entire gang we ordered Thai Seafood Soup, Fried Chili Chicken (with bone and boneless), Fried Lemon Chicken (with bone and boneless), Drum of Heaven, Fried Ginger Fish and Fried Chili Prawn. The Thai Seafood Soup was the best soup I ever had. Its creamy and full with pieces of prawn leaves a after taste of coriander leaves and lemon grass in our mouth. If its chicken, prawn or fish all were juicy and succulent with crispy coating outside. But Fried Chili/Lemon Chicken (boneless), Chili Prawn and Ginger Fish too my heart away. Fish was pure bhetki. A foodie must try all of these. Even portions were humongous.

Before entering main course we were so full to the brink that didn't had the guts to order side dishes along with Mixed Rice Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice and Hakka Chicken Noodles. Since development of my senses of Chinese cuisine never enjoyed so much having them without side dishes. I will recommend one must try Mixed Rice Noodles (Mei Foon) and Hakka Chicken Noodles.

Another reason to visit Chinatown is availability of liquor at lower prices. They have varieties available either peg wise or bottles at all sizes.

However, realized that they don't have any option for credit or debit card. In today's era of plastic money I found this strange to carry so much hard cash. Would request this to management as a scope of improvement.

The place scores poorly on ambience and service but the food makes up for everything. Like most restaurants in Chinatown, the close for a few hours in the afternoon between 2:30 to 7pm so don't be too late for lunch!

Never visiting this place ever again I might as well pay lesser than what they charge and eat on park Street where the ambience the crowd is much more better.....also forgot yo mention the schwezan chicken which was sweet like hell and just cooked in tomato ketchup....sorry Kim fa u were my favourites but no more!!!!!

If you are searching just for authenticate chinese delicacy (that's too at reasonable rate), then Kim Fa is the perfect place to hang out. At first, the restaurant is located at very isolated place and is really hard to find a mode of communication. As a result, not many outsiders choose this place and you will mostly find local chinese families. Next when we entered, we weren't invited at all as no one approach us for the order until we made a call. The service is poor. I would say want to spend time with your loved ones, then avoid Kim Fa. This place is only for taste buds.
We ordered Chicken fried rice with chilli chicken and honestly it was the best chinese i ever tasted. Soups were awesome. And crispy chicken drumsticks are the best in town. I wanted more but my tummy didn't allow. Quantity was more than enough. So I would suggest to hang out in a group and order for different dishes and share. 
Kim Fa is under-rated just because of its service and place of operation. I would have given 5 for taste but its poor service doesn't allow me. I bet it will be a treat for your taste buds.

Went back to Kim Fa after a long time. Stil remains one of the best in Tangra (and most authentic Hakka cuisine - not the fusion neo Chinese of the more fancy new comers in the neighborhood. A place even visiting Chinese would trust - see photo). But, others are beginning to catch up (eg Shun Li next door) They are fussy about going off-the regular menu even with prior ordering. And, last order by 10 is a dampner. Still turned out ak mean steamed chicken with garlic - Bok-Choy (also recommended in fish) and a classic Egg-Prawn Fu Yong. The AC "Family Room" is a saving grace but time they worked on the ambience a little.

If you really LOVE chinese food and don't care about the ambience, Kim Fa has to be on your list. 
Located in Tangra right above Chun Li, Kim Fa serves delicious chinese food at the right prices. 

The prices may not seem very less, but the quantity of the dishes is overwhelming. Going there alone and in a couple wouldn't do justice to you. You should go there at least in a group of 5 or 6, so as to try more things on the menu.

We started with a large Hot and sour soup which was sufficient for 4 to 5 servings.(price of one large soup which serves 5 here costs the same as the soups which you get in any other Chinese restaurant serving one, without any compromise on taste. 

We then proceeded with Chili Chicken, and chili fish, which was quite good.

Then for mains, we ordered Egg fried rice, Schezwan Fish, Fish in Red Wine with pak choy, Chili chicken Gravy, haka noodles, and stir fried pak choy. The taste of the food was really good. We ended up having quite a lot of leftovers, which we packed for later. 

The Jumbo prawns were also amazing. 

The service was fast, but the staff was, well... DRAB. 

I really recommend the place. May be a bit difficult to locate, but do try it.

This restaurant is the most closest to my house and whenever there is an event to celebrate, we would just go over there. We don't even need a menu, 'cause we all know the items in the menu by heart. That's how familiar we are. Being a Chinese myself, I'd say the quality of the food is quite good, even more better if you are with your friends or family. The place might be small but don't let that give you a negative remark about the restaurant. I personally like how they cook and serve "Shang Kong", but they are not available all the time. So you'll be lucky if it's available when you are there. I recommend anyone who's interested in eating Chinese cuisine at a reasonable price.

Kim Fa is undoubted under rated as far as Chinese food is considered in Tangra as well as Chinese food in Kolkata. Although the Restro is not so extravagant like others  but definitely the food in the restro is highly commendable. To start with the starters like drums of heaven and crispy chicken were superb! then the mefoon ( rice noodles) is also superbly cooked definitely compliments for the chef, the noodles are not oily as compared to some of the mefoon you get in other chinese restros in tangra, one thing for sure is that mefoon is not cooked by lard these days as what it use to be in the old days but who cares the taste is good as the old. The kung fa prawns is juicy and very tasty undoubtedly. The Mixed friend was also had a good balance of the chicken, eggs, and prawns and was enjoyable although i preferred the noodles to the fried rice. Hunan Chicken is definitely recommended for my followers on zomato, who really love Chinese food but insure that the achinomoto is not put in the meals pls avoid this harmful product its my earnest request although i do understand that its achinomoto that adds the taste to the dishes but for healthy reasons this should not be consumed. 

The Hot and Sour soup is also suitable to the pallet and i am sure children would surely enjoy this soup especially during the winter months in Kolkata.

Located above Shun Li, Kim Fa is often overlooked in favor of other loves in Chinatown, but this place has my vote for the great food it has always served me. Food and booze is cheap and the best thing is the quantity - I love their dry chilli chicken and spring chicken, and they make excellent Thai Soup, which remains my favorite. The other thing I love is their simple mixed hakka chow mien which is very tasty. Overall, a great place to eat and drink.

I was born and brought up in Tangra. And like most ppl, my friends loves chinese food. So when they ask me which is the best place, I say 'Kim Fa'. BUT i always warn them, if you want real authentic Chinese food, prepared by the owner and his wife themselves, then this is the place. If you are looking for a great, fancy restaurant with good ambiance then this is not the place. This is more like a eating house scenario. 
Most restaurants in Tangra are very famous but being a Chinese, i can say that they have fully indianised or localized the taste. Which I do not prefer.

So what to order? 
Thai soup or you can go for hot and sour soup.
They make the best chilli chicken in Tangra.
Cantonese noodles
Fish slice(boneless) stir fry with green veg and chinese rice wine (not on the menu)
If you like something lil sweet then go for their noodles, tossed with soya and jaggery.
Chilly Prawns

Note: call them and place your order for noodles because they run out of it very early, especially on Sundays!

Try it just for the food!!

One of the oldest places in Tangra. Quite consistent with their food and they have unpolished but helpful staff.In my book they rake up pretty much the best chilly chicken in town.Soups are standard.Things to look out for are their Mixed Fried Rice , Mei Foon , Garlic Prawns(they happen to be sweet sour and may not suit all palettes).Order  pretty much anything from the menu and they won't disappoint !

Had been here yesterday evening, thought it would be great, but was a great let down.
The ambience is average, there are not ample number of waiters & the most disappointing part was that they don't serve the food on your plates. The waiters are extremely rude. I must say the food was good, we tried Veg Pan Fried Noodles & Manchurian Chicken, it was very tasty. But its too pricey according to the service & ambience.
Would give a 2.5 rating.
