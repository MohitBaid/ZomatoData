Ordered the large margherita pizza from Chunky's, Paddarpur today afternoon. Delivery took around 40 minutes.

Pizza was hot & delicious! Crust was thin n crispy! I will rate the pizza as a 4/5.

Hope to visit the place soon to try other items.

I never have Veg Pizzas (thanks to my amazing experience from Domino's -.-)
But CHUNKY's has totally swept me off my feet!

Amazing pizzas!
We ordered for -

Chunky's Cheeza: with 4 toppings of our choice (we chose jalepenos, mushrooms, red paprika and olives).

Dream pizza - spinach, corn and loads of cheese.

Both were amazing. Cheesy an flavourful. Loved them!

We also ordered for -

Choco-gasm(MUST TRY) and Mint Strawberry Wedding.

They were both nice.

P. S. SMALL SUGGESTION : please add a variety where we can add cheese to the crust. As the crust of the pizza is really thin (which is amazing), it would be tastier with some added cheese in the crust üòçüòç

Ordered a pizza from this vegan delivery place on christmas eve....on a very tight budget and lured by the big portion food reviews....and to be honest this place has held it's place firm amongst non-veg places considering the number of people who cringe at the term 'veg food'...they have a very unique packaging with a nice quote on top...which only lifts up to reveal a ethereal and astonishingly palatable looking fab fungo pizza with olives and chunks of mushroom on top that makes u wanna dive in immediately...and once you immerse yourself into the cheesy well seasoned top with the juicy mushrooms you gradually seem to fade away from the whole non veg supremacy and start to put your faith on the rather underrated flavours of vegan delicacies...the pizza's thin crust and mild crunch adds to the experience and you just wanna have a whole chunk of the heavenly dish cause this is a dish you're gonna be ordering again.

If you want to eat great food which comes in the coolest packging nd are feeling too lazy to go out or you suddenly feel hungry at midnight, Chunky's is the perfect solution. 
It is a delivery joint located near paddapukur and they have a great menu. It's a vegetarian's delight.

You should definitely try any of their mushroom items and the Aam in heaven. The madu fadu burger and the garlic bread are one of a kind and very soothing to the tongue and soul.

The packaging is very quirky, especially the "alright, it's a pizza box" üòÅ

So, what are you waiting for? Open Zomato order or the swiggy app and get going!!

Redefining cloud kitchen food expectations.
When you get your delivered, you are always spectickle of how it will be, but not after I got my food from this place.
Had a birthday treat of a colleague and got it delivered from Zomato, delivery speed is also commendable. 
Tried nachos bhel, crispy and diped in sauce, garlic bread was full of mozerella cheese.
Special mention to the brownie shake, truly the best I had lately. 
Also had a mushroom cheese burger which was as the name says, cheese and mushrooms full Patty. Also tried a nadu fadu burger as they like to call it.
Had 2 pastas as well, one called best of two worlds, red and white sauce mixed, and a pesto Paradise, seriously was so creamy. 
The rice we ordered was the main highlight of the the meal, a Mexican coop which was a bit spicy and something called mushroom magnum which is definitely in my next order from this place also.

The best meal is what ends with a good desert and so was this meal, the brownie we tried was heavenly didn't expect this from a delivery kitchen, beating some good names.
Thump's up to the chef for this perfect meal, do try opening a kitchen near howrah so I get your stuff at my home too.

One of my friends recommended this place to me. They are a home delivery joint located in Paddapukur area. They provide pure vegetarian food at reasonable prices.

I tried the Shubh Arambh and Oh!Reo Shake for drinks. The shakes were moderate in density and had distinctive flavours. Recommended.

For starters we had Cheese Garlic Bread and Nachos Bhel. Mushroom & Cheese Love Burger was lovely with a sumptuous patty. Pesto Paradise was nice. I really loved the Pizza Al Funghi. Definitely Recommended.

Mexican Coop and Mushroom Mayhem are two unique dishes which I really loved. The quantity is enough for a filling meal.

The Chocolate Volcano is an overdose of chocolaty affair. Recommended only to those who love real sweet desserts.

This is a delivery only food joint located in paddapukur. I had made an order through their hotline number and got the food delivered to my doorsteps in no time. The food quality is mind blowing and available at a reasonable price point. This place has come out like a vegetarian persons paradise. My recommendations for this place would be:
1. The brownie shake
2. Cheese garlic bread
3. Mushroom and olive pizza
4. Mexican rice (provided you can stand the heat of this dish)
Brownie points to the place since it caters to the midnight cravings of the city. I huge thumbs up to the team working behind the scenes to bring such mouth watering food to the people of Calcutta.

Located at the bylanes of paddapukur,this vegetarian home-delivery joint is an excellent start to some really mouth watering dishes and delicacies. Moreover this place adds essence to itself by offering delivery and fooding services to small parties. A cherry on the pie for all those who do not wish to spend a handfull of money. In a nutshell, this place is cheap, attractive and worth a visit.Now coming to the dishes,we had-

1:The brownie ball
2:Aam in heaven
3:Cheese garlic bread
4:The madu fadu burger
5:Best of both world pasta
6:Spicy treat pizza
7:Mexican copp
8:The chocolate volcano

We had many more dishes but the above mentioned are a must try from this place.

First of all I would like to say that they delivered inless than 30 mins which was amazing. I ordered the mac and cheese and it was really good. The only complaint that i have is the piece of garlic bread that was given as an accompaniment had gone soggy and was unpleasant. But saying that the mac n cheese in itself was quite tasty. I recommend everyone to order from here

Lately I'm requiring to order food home a lot and so I've made it a point to try different delivery joints around the city.
Chunky's has been the best when it came vegetarian Italian food.
There has been a lot of items since we were a large group : Chili Cheese Toast, Wedges Mexicana, Italian Sandwich, Nachos Bhel, Creamy Mushroomate (which is white sauce pasta), The Golden Pizza, Cheese & Mushroom Mayhem and finally Black Beauty (which is a chocolate sandwich).
Mint-Strawberry Wedding and Shubh Aarambh were the two drinks I enjoyed thoroughly while gulping down all of these food.
Looking forward to ordering the Wedges Mexicana, the pizza and the Mushroom Mayhem again which has been my favourite among the rest!

I seldom go to vegetarian restaurants, let alone review them, but this one deserves all the love it has been getting lately.

We ordered in so I can't comment on the decor, which, I've heard, isn't very special.

It's Closed for Online Orders on Zomato most of the time and I believe they should probably do something about that.

Now.
Food.
Mint-strawberry wedding. It's like the Cupid Fantasy mocktail, which is slightly better. Also, comes in a bottle and no straws, so you have pieces of lemon in your mouth every time you take a sip.

Also ordered Chilli Cheese Toast, Italian Sandwich, Creamy Mushroomate and Cheese and Mushroom Mayhem.

The toasts were okay.
The sandwich was delicious, had that perfect cheesy chewy feeling and the Mushroomate was tasty too.

The real star was the Mayhem. So it's like a more buttery jeera rice(without jeera) that tastes way better than jeera rice coupled with this thick delicious cheesy gravy of mushroom that tastes like heaven!

For all the veggies out there, try this place.
You won't be disappointed.

Ordered online. Delivery boy was delivering the 4th order at the same time and the last one was mine. So not his fault, they do not have adequate delivery mechanism.
American Burger sucked. It was chilled.
Order nachos bhel and got plain nachos without beans and etc. stuffs.
Bad food ordering experience, only beautiful packaging just won't survive you long.

Located near Digambar Jain Mandir, Chunkys is basically a delivery vegetarian joint .So I ordered at my place to complete my Friday night and trust me ,The quality of the food was amazing.

WHAT I ORDERED :

1.STRAWBERRY MINT WEDDING : Comes in a tightly capped plastic bottle with a chunky's logo in the bottle ,which kinda looked quite exclusive.This consisted of mint,basil ,and lemon and totally refreshing. Must try .

2.WEDGES MEXICANA : Fancy name for french fries , but it tasted quite better than many of the french fries I had . It was quite spicy and the dip was amazing.

3.CREAMY MUSHROOMMATE : This was totally amazing. The mushroom tasted too good and since it was too creamy ,it made it taste awesome.Do try .

4.BLACK BEAUTY : Chocolate sandwich was something I had never tried. Filled with molten chocolate on the inside and crispy bread on the outside,this was something you should go for.

Chunky's deliver till 3am in the morning,so incase if you are super hungry in the middle of the night ,do give them a call, they will be at your service.By the way I am ordering again.

When it's about House parties you tend to get into the party mood & you don't really like to cook.So home delivery from a good restaurant is what you need & Chunky's is what you need.
Since it was a veg party so we planned to try out from this home delivery outlet.I don't generally prefer veg food for parties but the food changed my mind.
The food comes with very good packaging.
What We Ordered..
*Shubh Arambh (Chocolate Shake) (Recommended)
It was good and was perfect with the sweetness of the drink.
*Nachos Bhel (Strongly Recommended)
The dip they gave was the show stopper.
*Wedges Mexicana
Perfect Potato wedges
*The Golden Pizza (Recommended)
Loved the write up on top of the Pizza box & the Pizza was nice too,full of Sweet Corn.
*Black Beauty (Chocolate Sandwich) 
(Recommended)
This was something unique and liked it too.

Since house parties are amazing and you definitely do not feel like cooking in all such occasions...a good delivery.. infact an amazing delivery from Chunky's is all you need... and that is exactly what I did today... excellent vegetarian food titillating our taste buds...
So what we ordered???.....here it is...
A refreshing drink - Mint strawberry wedding ( highly recommended)
Chilly cheese toast (perfect cheese toast with a spicy hue)
Italian sandwich ( crisp grilled)
Creamy mushroomate ( highly recommended )
Cheese and mushroom mayhem ( for the love of cheese and penne)
I would like to add the service is quick and the courteous behaviour of the delivery staff was note worthy...
So next time you have a house party... simply relax and enjoy and let Chunky's look after the rest...

Chunky's: A one stop solution for house parties. Yes because it's a take away food joint.
P.S. It's a veg joint.
You get everything that you desire under one roof at a reasonable price.
Isn't that a good thing?
Not to forget the names of the food items, they are too interesting I must say.
Well the service was great as it reached us just on time and special credit goes to the packaging system.üëç
House party started with a bang with their drink named "Shubh Aarambh". Chocolate shake in a gist and an unputdownable drink in other words!
Shubh Aarambh indeed. üëå
Nachos Bhel was another interesting item that literally played with our tastebuds. Crispy fresh nachos when served with the best mayo dip in the world can do wonder in keeping the mood.
Wish the little box of bhel never ended!
The Golden pizza with corn and cheese melted in our mouths like anything. Loved it.Soft and cheesy it was! Oh yes, it arrived in an amusing pizza box with a cute quote too.
Don't miss that out‚ùï
The food journey came to an end with their famous "Black Beauty".
Dessert by the term it didn't disappoint us.
It's like a sweet toast overloaded with chocolate! Unavoidable. Isn't it? üòâ
Give a try guys and have fun with their yummy collection. üëç

This is the first time I am writing a review on Zomato and this is all because of the absolutely amazing food that I had! The Protein Panorama (Rajma Burger) with double cheese was delicious. The flavours in the patty used in the burger have been brought out beautifully! Plus the extra cheese takes the pleasure to a different level. This is the best burger I have had in recent times :D! Then I had Cheese and Mushroom Mayhem (rice dish). I was experimenting with this one as I don't like eating rice but this one left me craving for more :p. The rice was served with 'mushroom patty' combined with 'cream and mushroom gravy' which gave my tastebuds the enticement it needed. The experiment was a success! The dinner is not complete without a sip at the end. So I tried the Mango Mutiny. It was good.

I shall be experimenting with the other dishes soon! Great food üëç

Pros:

I ordered for the veggie overdose pizza and the Mexican coop bowl. I generally order food from from Zomato and I though of giving this place a try, 100% satisfied with the quality of food that was delivered to me. Packaging was so perfect that the food was still warm and the cheese was still melted. It almost felt as if it was brought fresh to my table at a restaurant. The Mexican coop bowl was perfectly spiced, not too overpowering but it packed a punch with really awesome flavors. I am impressed with them and I have to say that for me, their food for sure is giving a tough competition to the premier restaurants in Kolkata. 

Cons: 

I'd want them to go non vegetarian as well.

Chunky's was a pleasant surprise undoubtedly! Being a non vegetarian, I always presume that pizzas are best with non vegetarian toppings, but Chunky's got me hooked to their pizzas. I personally think it's their quality of ingredients that makes their taste unforgettable. Totally recommend it to people who want to eat tasty, simple and reasonable food!

Finally, a fast food joint in Kolkata we can all brag about and order until 3am in the morning. I ordered for a house party yesterday and was elated to see their servings. Family Garlic Bread, Pastas, Pizzas, Rice Bowl and what not. I woke up today craving for some more and ordered their Mushroom Burger, and trust me, this is the best burger I have had in the city. Ever. Order and you won't regret it.

Total value for money and quick delivery.
For late night hungers best place to order no doubt. üòä

Recently ordered in "some" food from Chunky's and it did not disappoint a bit. The Italian Influence (their very own version of the Italian rice bowl, with gravy and fries) quickly became the favourite at the table and so did the Spicy Treat Pizza. 

The mixed sauce pasta and the refreshing beverages in the quirky bottles are a great pick too. 

Veg food, made really really good. A muat try for everyone.

It was a veg party and we decided to try this delivery outlet out!

I generally don't prefer veg food but the food from chunky's was surprisingly good!

I tasted the pizza, the madu fadu burger and the rice bowl. All of them were pretty good!

Tried some of their delicacies yesterday... Love their packaging... It's completely a veg delivery joint... I didn't expected anything extraordinary from the place... But, they proved me wrong... We had their...

"Mexican Wedges" & "Cheese Mushroom Toast" in starters... Both were just yummy & tasty...

From the mains we had "Rajma Burger", "Madu Fadu Burger", "Mixed Sauce Pasta" & "Spicy Treat Pizza"... All tasted distinctly different from each other... All were mind blowing...

And in the beverages do try their "Strawberry Shake" & "Peachy keen"... They presents it in a plastic bottle... Shake well before having it... So that you can enjoy the flavours at the fullest...

Highly recommended place... Do give it a try...

If there was anything less than 1 then i will give it to this restaurant. First of all how this restaurant is rated- 4.5 beats me! On the second thought it doesn't but simply allows me to question the authenticity of reviews for this joint.

We ordered a pizza and cheese Toast around 11 from zomato and the order came at 3:00 am ( wow talk about delivery ) now if i come to the food- less said is better. If the chef / cook in this restaurant thinks he/she is serving italian and continental cuisine then quite frankly he/she is delusional. There are many italians who must be turning in thier graves becuase of this restaurant's food and it being termed as italian.

Pizza was obnoxious- it looked like someone took a round paratha , added some capsicum , tomato , bell pepper and placed it in micro wave.

Cheese Toast - omg, triangle bread with cheese again microwaved. No taste , no quality and zero regards for customer given.

250 for pizza and 150 for cheese toast , I wouldn't give 30 rs for it and its probably even worse then what shops pass on to consumers in office and college canteens.

These kind of restaurants should not even be listed in late night delivery. They aren't delivering , they are robbing people and most probably employing people to add fake reviews. Yes , I haven't been there to this joint in person but if this is how thier food quality and delivery is - iam better off never setting a foot even 100 meters near this place.

Cheese lovers and foodies, if you ever had dreams full of cheese and pizzas, this is the place to be. 
A very strong recommendation goes for few items which have always been my favourite - 
1. Mushroom sandwich
2. Cheese mayhem
3. Nachos Bhel
4. Pizza
I bet you, open the online menu and place your finger blindly upon any item mentioned, that will be a treat to your taste buds.
A huge shoutout to Mr. Siddharth for this venture and making this succesfull. Located in paddapukur, they have a wide delivery network which goes upto entire south and central calcutta and soon till salt lake. 
They know you love pastas and filler burgers too, so they have crafted the same to exactly match up to your taste buds. Americans and italians are a cliche, lets explore our home now ?

Hungry for some droolworthy vegetarian food? Craving for some cheesy goodness and filling burgers? If yes, you have landed at the right page. 
We ordered from this place, and trust me it was nothing short of a great culinary experience. For the prices they charge, I can't figure out how they are managing such awesome   quality of raw materials and henceforth, even superior quality of end products. 
We tried-
1. Mixed sauce pasta- Calling it delicious would be an understatement. It was probably the best rendition of the dish I've had so far.
2. Mushroom mayhem- It was a burst of beautiful flavours in the mouth right from the first bite to the last. They combine butter and basil with rice perfectly and serve it with a rich, creamy and cheesy Alfredo gravy with mushrooms. Mushroom lovers, go for it and you won't regret it.
3. The vegetarian American burger- Super soft buns, packing the goodness of a crunchy veg patty( the patty is very tasty jbtw), lots of caramelised onions, their in house spicy mayo, and cheese. They serve it with super tasty masala fries. You can't ask for a better 'value for money' meal for INR 149.
It was our first order and we tried only 3 dishes. The trailer of the movie "Chunky's" was intriguing and happy. I am definitely going to watch the entire movie in installments. Their menu seems exciting.
P.s-  Their packaging is top notch. They specialise in deliveries , and rightly so. 
5 stars for this wonderful new kid on the block . 
Keep churning delicacies like these for the foodies!

This is the place where AFFORDABILITY meets YUMMY food. If you are looking for an amazing home delivery option, this is where you should stop by.
Though Chunky's is an only delivery kitchen, the food is oh so tasty that you'll probably end up licking your fingers when it's over.

Items I ordered:
‚Ä¢Cheese and Mushroon Mayhem
‚Ä¢The Mexican Coop
‚Ä¢The Madu Faadu Burger
‚Ä¢Aam' in heaven
‚Ä¢Mango Mutiny

The cheese & mushroom mayhem was without a doubt the best item from all of the things I ordered. It is basically butter rice tossed with basil and served with cream sauce cooked in mushroom (gravy) . A mushroom patty accompanies this dish.
The gravy was lipsmaking and this is one of the best dishes I've ever had. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

The Mexican Coop is basically Mexican fried rice served with hot Mexican sauce , a Mexican patty and cheese salt. This dish was something that was a perfect choice for my taste buds that crave for a good spicy meal. If u like a bit of spice in your food,order this!

The maadu fadu burger was a delicious burger served with a twist (bhujia) and some French fries. It finds its perfect balance with both Imli ki khatti meeethi chutney and dhaniya mayo. A must have for all you burger lovers.

Appetizers:
Aam' in heaven is the perfect drink for people who live for tangy mojitos. A perfect love affair of kaccha aam and a mojito.

Mango mutiny on the other hand is for people who like sweet mojitos. Since I'm not very fond of sweet drinks, I gave this a pass to my brother who is a sucker for sweet soda drinks and he said he loved it.

Overall I have ZERO complaints on what I ordered. The delivery is very prompt and the quality as well of the quantity were a value for money.
Also, the packaging is top notch!!! The icing on the cake being ITS OPEN TILL 3 AM.....
Keep it up Chunky's

A vegetarian friend invited me for a birthday treat. And he said the food is going to ordered from outside. Being a bengali thats a total turn off. But then he is a friend. There I come across this little gem who happen to serve till 3 am. The food arrives very neatly packed and bingo... am in love with vegetarian food and the carnivore inside me takes a day off happily. From the pasta to the pizza and from the rice bowls to the desserts everything was top class. Not to forget the drinks. They are the silent guardian and an watchful protector in case you get hungry at night. And dont worry the mushroom wont let you miss the chicken if prepared by the guys at Chunky's.

A veg lover's paradise, this delivery place serves some lip-smacking vegetarian food which even a non-veg lover would adore. And the best part about this joint is that it is open till 3am. So they happily serve all your late night cravings and sleep overs or late night parties. 
A few of my friends had ordered from this place a few days back and we loved everything we ordered. 
We ordered two mocktails-
1. Alla Bella Nutella - anybody who loves nutella would love this drink and who doesn't like nutella right? They packed it a cute bottle so that it doesn't open and the drink spills out. 
2. Virgin Mojito - a refreshing drink yet again served in that spill proof bottle. 

For Starters we ordered-
1. Family Garlic Bread - cheese and buttery garlic bread served with tomato sauce. It was amazing!
2. Nachos Bhel- it tasted great.

For the main course we ordered-
1. Pesto Paradise Sandwich - as the name suggests it tasted heavenly. Please go for it if you love pesto
2. Mushroom And Cheese Love Burger- do try this one out! 
3. I'm feeling lucky- Best of Both Worlds - it was a mixed sauce pasta baked to perfection and served with a garlic bread slice. It was amazing! 
4. Quattro Formaggi- it was a four cheese pizza and it was lip-smacking! Strongly recommended 
5. Cheese and Mushroom Mayhem- it was rice bowl with basil rice and mushroom alfredo sauce served with a veg cutlet. One of the best rice bowls I've had in a long time. 

For the desserts we ordered-
1. Black Beauty - chocolate fudge sandwiched between two toasted and buttered bread slices drizzled with Chocolate Sauce and served with ice cream on a separate container 
2. The Chocolate Volcano- a gooey chocolate brownie covered with ample amounts of dark and milk chocolate sauce served with ice cream. It was a piece of heaven I felt! 
A special mention to the on time delivery and also to the amazing packaging they do. This place is going to reach heights! 
Happy Fooding ‚ô•

A veg lovers paradise,this place serves lip smacking vegetarian food till 3 AM in the morning so last night,we were having a small house party and we got hungry in the middle of the night so we decided to order some food from chunky's but we were curious about how the food would be because it is a relatively new delivery joint but to our surprise everythig was fresh and delicious.
Coming to the food we ordered:

Beverages:

Alla Bella Nutella: The name says it all,it has nutella in it so the taste just cant go wrong and it was perfectly made,not too sweet and consistency was amazing.

Strawberry Mint Wedding: A super refreshing drink.Loved it.

Aam In Heaven: More like Aam Panna,so this was also very refreshing.

Starters:

Family Garlic Bread: A huge loaf of bread served with loads of cheese,very filling.

Nachos Bhel: The best nachos bhel I have had,the perfect combination of all the ingredients mixed very well.

Cheese and Mushroom Sandwich: The sandwich was served with fries,the sandwich has loads of cheese and mushroom in it.Tasted good.

Main Course:

AlFunghi Pizza: The pizza was quite large in size with 8 slices it was filling and yummy at the same time,the quantity of all the toppings were also perfect.

Cheese and Mushroom Mayhem: A rice bowl served with a nice thick preparation consisting of cheese and mushroom,the rice was well flavoured.

Desserts: 

Chocolate Volcano: It was a brownie with chocolate sauce poured over it served along with ice cream in a separate container.Brownie and Ice Cream can never go wrong.

I was not only impressed with their food but also their packaging,the food was still hot when served.

Recommended for late night eats and of course for vegetarians.

Good late night Delivery Joint!!
I am a bit sceptical of ordering from late night delivery places. But this joint totally changed my view. It's a late night joint one can order food and beverages from this joint till 3am :)

Coming to the items we opted for:
From BEVERAGES section :-
Strawberry Mint Wedding: The combination pairs perfectly. It gave a kind of tangy & sweet taste. It was very refreshing. 

Alla Bella Nuttela (Recommended): The name itself gives hint of how it tasted. It was chocolatey and flavourful <3
The packaging of the beverages were done to perfection. Sealed cute yellow bottles also came with yellow straws. 

From FOOD Section:-
Nachos Bhel: Nachos in desi chatpata style. It's different and loaded with flavours. Highly Recommended:)
Family Garlic Bread
Cheese and Mushroom Sandwich
Italian influence
Quattro Formaggi
Cheese and Mushroom Mayhem
All the dishes were well prepared. The food was nicely packed and delivered on time.

For DESSERTS we've ordered The Chocolate Volcano which was basically a warm chocolate brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 

Definitely worth ordering from!! :)

If you are a veg lover you are going to love the food from this place- any dish, all of them.. So, these guys opened shop recently and my friend wanted to try their food. We had it ordered over one afternoon. The delivery was pretty fast. I heard they deliver till 3 in the morning - that's an added bonus. What I loved specially was their packaging. It was neat and practical. Happy with their service, let me come to the food now.
We were a bunch of people and we ordered for a full course.

Drinks -
Aam in heaven, a refreshing mojito with green aam flavour (I absolutely loved it) , Virgin mojito, Strawberry mint wedding, which again is a mojito with strawberry flavour.. What I really liked was that they have their own cute packaged bottles.

Starters -
Family garlic bread was a huge loaf of garlic bread soaked in butter and topped with cheese.
But the best was Nacho bhel, where you get crushed nacho in yummy cheese and finely diced veggies (yummlicious)

Mains -
Pesto paradise sandwich: Normal pesto sandwich with loads of mayo and finely diced cucumber.
Mushroom and cheese love burger: Again, another delectable item. The patty was well made and it dripped with cheese. The cheese lover out there, this is definitely going to satisfy you.
I'm feeling lucky best of both worlds baked pasta: This baked pasta came in huge quantity and was well made.
Quattro formaggi pizza: thin crust pizza with baby tomatoes and jalape√±o and dollops of cheese spread on it,
the Italian influence rice bowl: this was comfort! The rice was nicely cooked and came red gravy and a patty.. It was delicious. Rice lovers will definitely love this.
So much good food that we were full, but there's always place for dessert!

Desserts - Black beauty: was love.. It was chocolate sandwich with a scoop of ice cream with it.
And lastly Chocolate volcano: good old chocolate brownie with ice cream. Now i don't really know what made it so awesomely delicious.

I guess chunky's has a way of making even everyday food taste 'oh so good', not to mention their signatures!

Too lazy to go out? Wanna have some lip-smacking delicious veg food? Having major craving at night? Or you're late from office or any other work and you need to feed your hungry soul. Well dont worry for Chunky's is all set to serve you hot delicious food even at night. They are open till 3am. I know you are very much relieved now on hearing this. Chunky's is a delivery joint which serves pure vegetarian food.

Now lets talk about what i had. Well i was at my friends house where we ordered food from here. Delivery was on time and the packaging was done neatly and properly. 

Mocktails/Shakes:
 
What makes them different from the other joints is that they provide shakes and mocktails in bottles rather than paper cups. The introduction of bottles makes it handy and spill-proof. Additional straw comes with the bottles also. So take a sip from bottle or from straw- your choice 

Alla Bella Nutella: you can already guess from its name that the shake is made up of nutella. Its rich and beautiful. Heaven is the word i can say about this shake. Highly Recommended.

Strawberry Mint Wedding: well this drink is combination of strawberry, mint, lemon zest and basil leaves. Its absolutely refreshing. You get a balanced flavour. Its sweet, its fruity, its tangy and minty. 

Aam in Heaven: the drink truly does justice to the name. Who doesnt love mango drink? Well a classic combination of sweet and tangy. I absolutely enjoyed it.

 Along with these beverages, we had nachos bhel and  garlic bread. 

Nachos Bhel: nachos and dip- a wonderful combination right? Well they have combined the two and created Nachos Bhel. A lip-smacking dish. Its packed with flavours. You get the crunchyness from the sauce and then the sauce with is absolutely yumm.

Garlic Bread: what i liked about this one is that they have packed the bread neatly. The bread being soft, you get the garlic flavour and the cheesy bits on top of it.

For snacks, we had pesto sandwich and cheese and mushroom burger. Now both carries with themselves spicy tasty fries. 

Pesto Sandwich: wont say much about this one. Pesto goodness filled sandwich always makes me happy. Its delicious. Try it guys.

Cheese and mushroom sandwich: what a combination my god. The flavour from the patty filled with mushroom was awesome, the cheesy taste was mesmerizing. Recommended.

We were actually in heaven by the time we reached for the main course but you know what good food always makes you want for more. In this section, we had Al Fungi Pizza, Corny and Cheesy Spinach Story and Italian Influence.

Al Fungi Pizza: mushroom and cheese in a pizza. What more can you seriously for? Cant get any better. One word- must try. 

Corny and Cheesy Spinach Story- pasta tossed in cheese, corn and spinach. It indeed tells a story of how good a pasta can be. The sweet bits from the corn, the beautiful flavour and arome from the herbs and spinach, the goeyness from the cheese and the beautifully cookes pasta- a sheer delight to your tongue. Recommended.

Italian Influence: so this is rice bowl where you get basil rice, veg cutlet and a rich heavenly tomatoey sauce. What i liked about this dish is that when you combine it together, none of them overpowers each other. You get the aromatic flavours from the basil rice, the richness from the gravy and the veggie bite just elevates the dish. Recommend.

Finally ending our journey on a sweet note with Black Beauty and The Chocolate Volcano.

Black Beauty: goey fudgy chocolate sandwich. It comes with vanilla ice cream. Sweetness was well balanced. It just melts in your mouth. I enjoyed it.

The chocolate Volcano: fudgy rich chocolatey brownie with rich chocolate sauce and ice cream. Try this and later thank me. If you dont try this,you wont get to know what heaven feels like. 

You did make me happy and smile. Loved it totally and i mean it. 

Will i order from here again? Definately.

A vegetarian's paradise and yet the non vegetarians have more fun here too. Chunky's is a health companion focusing on healthy eating. Designs a diet plan just for you which is not only very healthy but also delicious and yummy.¬†

It's a home delivery joint, serving beverages, food and lip-smacking desserts. This place remains open till 3am.¬†

It was a really different experience for me. The food I have never ever imagined.
 The menu is vast so I tried to sample some of the interesting items.

Drinks :

1) Strawberry Mint Wedding :
Fresh strawberries, mint and lemon turn water into a tasty flavored drink. This mixed strawberry and mint combines delicious fresh lime and basil. It's super delicious, perfect for spring and refreshing.

2) Aam in Heaven :
The love for mango is universal. This drink has a unique combination of sweet, savory & tangy savors and it tasted like heaven.

Main Course:

1) Family Garlic Bread :
One of my favorite food is a good garlic bread, especially if it's a garlic cheese. This bread is so awesome. Buttery, cheesy, garlic-y heaven!

2) Nachos Bhel :
Just like Bhel Puri, Nachos with dip turns out super yummy and it is fun nibbling on this delicious snack. Also, with tons of cereals, tomatoes, pulses going into the making of Nachos Bhel, it turns out to be a salubrious snack.¬†

3) Cheese And Mushroom Sandwich :
This sandwich is not for the faint hearted and for all those who are working out to lose weight, so please just drool and pass on. Loaded with two delicious goodness i.e. cheese and loads of mushrooms.¬†

4) Mushroom and Cheese Love Burger :
A burger topped with mushrooms has to be healthier than the competition, right? Mushroom burgers are the most healthy veggie burger that you'll find (caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms and¬† cheese are some of my very favorite!).

5) The Corn and Cheesy Spinach Story :
Spinach Corn Pasta is a great wholesome dish laced with goodness of spinach. Spinach dip and pasta get together to create one cheesy and creamy dish!¬†

6) Quattro Formaggi Pizza :
This is the classic version of one of the most wonderful combinations of bread and cheese imaginable. And this pizza is a direct staircase to cheese heaven.

                    7) The Italian Influence :¬†
Italian Rice Bowls with veg Cutlet. Loaded with veggies, served over rice, full of flavor.

                    8) Cheese and Mushroom Mayhem :
Creamy and mushrooms with rice is comforting, satisfying, and tasty. This is definitely comfort food. Flavorful mushrooms, and a rich creamy sauce‚Ä¶what could be better?¬†

Because all the meals are completed you even get a piece of chocolate or other healthy desserts with your meals.

Desserts :¬†

1) Black Beauty:
Served with vanilla ice cream scoop. So rich and heavenly! Have a gooey chocolate inside that oozes out chocolaty goodness!

2) The Chocolate Volcano :
These brownie chocolate cake really do remind me of volcanoes as they release their soft, silky river of chocolate. Let's just say I've never tasted heaven before this piece of art.

Vegetarian lovers are gonna love this. But non vegetarians will become a fan of this place.
A home delivery joint, serving food and beverages of this quality and in such a convenient and hygienic way is beyond expectations.
Ordered for Alla bella nutella shake(recommended) and strawberry mint wedding for beverages . The former was super tasty and latter was refreshing enough.
Also, settled for a family garlic bread, nachos bhel(recommended) for the starters. Their packaging is commendable and food stays fresh and crisp till delivery.
For snacks, we ordered in the mushroom cheese sandwich and the American vegetarian burger. Both come with fries and ketchup.
Main course :- The corny and cheesy spinach story with garlic bread(recommended) , a lovely preparation of white sauce pasta with spinach. The al-funghi pizza (think crust), and cheese and mushroom mayhem (rice bowl, comes along with a veg cutlet).
For dessert also we ordered the chocolate volcano. This is basically a chocolate fudgy brownie with dark and milk chocolate sauce drizzled in excess, comes with ice cream.
The cake and ice cream are packed separately.

Very impressed with the food quality and packaging.
Also please note, that we had ordered it pretty late at night around 1-1:30am. And they were pretty much on time. This place remains open till 3am.

Finally a joint that Kolkata needed so badly..an all delivery outlet in the heart of Kolkata..they deliver almost everywhere in south Kolkata..they told me they are starting late night deliveries really soon. A wide range of tempting options to choose from. I ordered for a protein panorama burger, and it was exactly how I anticipated it to be, seeing the description on the menu..crisp rajma patty and a homemade salsa gave me a proper Mexican feel..the burger went well with the perfectly made refreshing strawberry mint mojito. It was balanced, refreshing and bang on!
Brilliant packaging and timely delivery.
Great job guys! Keep up the good work and keep sending lip smacking food to people.

The menu options seem to be wide, food is quite delicious and doesn't take much of a time to deliver.
The prices are neither expensive nor cheap, quite on the average bit. The timing of delivery is what makes this joint unique, till 3:00 A.M!!!
A great joint for party animals!
