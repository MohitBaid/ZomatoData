Went there on my friend's party event.
It was natural to face overcrowd. We entered at around 4 and went out almost at 8.

Yes, danced like a party freak even drinking very little. ðŸ™ˆ

The house DJs were awesome!! Literally AWESOME.

Went there with less expectations and came back with highly FUN.

I loved the hospitality of this place so very much. The food was also very very good and the servers were so humble and caring. The management have hired some really good people. Recommended

It was a little hard to locate this place. Nothing really appealing about this place. Staff is cordial and warm. The vodka based shots could be better. Alcohol at a reasonable price. However the food was fine. But the server was down so we had a lot of issues trying to pay via credit card. Need to work on that.

Good affordable food, nice ambience. I find this to be a great place to hang out with friends. They could really work on the dejaying though. Music needs improvement.

Located at New Market, one of the busiest shopping destination of Kolkata. This bar cum restaurant offers a relief for the avid shoppers. It has a pleasant dark environment which makes it an ideal choice for a place to sit and grab some Beer or Scotch. The food is also offered at a reasonable rate. Though don't have a wide range to offer in the food menu, it's decent enough for those hungry stomachs, growling for food after a tiresome shopping experience. The staff is co-operative and adheres to special instructions given to them. Overall it's a nice place to eat or drink.

It, being in a crowded place like new market, was absolutely empty. And whoever came, had a look into the menu card and went off. The music was very loud unlike any other pub. The only thing I liked was the dim blue light.

The music at this place is splendid. If you enjoy bollywood dance music then this is the place for you. The backdrop isn't good. It's a little inside the gullies...  And yeah the crowd, the only reason while I would never return.

Visited this place once but not in a way it should be visited. Have not went there with friends for a late night party but spent an hour alone on a Friday evening during summer.

Inside is a different world. Dark blue light. You can hardly see faces. Continuous DJ music. When I visited I saw only one couple spending time and the music was series of romantic songs rather than dance numbers. Probably it changes as time approaches to night. Music is very loud but not a bad quality ear-cracker. Good to listen but everybody has to take the faces very close to communicate! Ideal place for dating and partying.

I ordered one Twister and a plate of Chilli chicken. Twister was awesome with an unique flavor of cucumber. Chilli chicken was good but ordinary. Chicken pieces were not very fresh. But it did not cause any trouble to stomach. Cost was slightly on higher side with respect to the quantity. Service was excellent. The staffs were neatly groomed, smart, sober and cooperative.

Overall experience was nice and I spent a good time there.

I just love La Dolce Vita.... am a frequent visitor over there.... Just love the ambiance....if you are want some relaxation after having a hectic schedule then i must say this place will just make a place in your heart... if you go in the afternoon like 3 pm to 5 pm u will find peace there...not much gathering..no body to disturb..just have a drink and a snacks sitting on a hot chair..have a nice chat with the most friendly bar tenders... Even i used to have a nice chat with the DJ who sits over there everyday preparing to rock the floor.... 5 pm to 7 or 7.30 pm the DJ continues to play slow romantic music which will make u feel so romantic and will enjoy the most with your partner.... then after that the floor rocks but the dance numbers....Food and drinks are awesome.... as some snacks u can try fish fingers...its so awesome...and the drinks are very good.... The price is very low in compare with some other Bar cum Disc.... So go and try it.... for me La Dolce Vita rocks

located beside scoop opposite shreeram arcade, this cozy pub n disc is a nice place to spend after a hectic day in office. Its worth goin there during weekdays especially after 8 pm when you have the DJ playing out loud music. The prices are very very reasonable here. The minus point: they charge an entry fee of Rs. 500 per stag/400 per couple on fri-sat-sun after 6pm. The service too, isn't an issue even during late evenings when the place is completely jam packed with party animals. Nice ambience and interiors add to the dim lighting of the place.
