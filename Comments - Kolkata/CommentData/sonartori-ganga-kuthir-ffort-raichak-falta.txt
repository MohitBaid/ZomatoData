Sonar Tori in Ffort Raichak doesn't live up to the standard that you would expect from a premium property like Ffort Raichak. The only thing I found I good about the place was the decor and the aam-kasundi daal & paayesh of the thaali.
Every item of the thaali, except for the luchi was cold - the meat was hard and the taste of the dishes were just average or below. Did not expect such sub-standard food with a hefty price of Rs. 1100/- (plus tax).
Also, we found the behavior of one of the staff names Tapas to be unprofessional and wrong.
Sonar Tori has plenty of space and tables were you can wait. We were given a waiting of almost an hour - and we requested for a some rice and daal and boiled potato for our 1 year baby meanwhile. This is first time out of umpteen number of places where we had food (including road side shacks) that we faced a denial about providing some rice, daal and potato for the baby - which was already available with them (part of thaali). Tapas told us go to some other place if we wanted that food for the baby. It was pathetic behaviour from him. It was the other staff named Abbas who interfered when we asked to speak to the GM and said the food will be given for the baby. I did not expect such experience from Sonar Tori.

The place is designed so beautiful that no one can leave the place once you see the river ganga and the beautifully built huts and hotels. It was very pleasant. I went to Shonar tori and the structure was made so beautiful with old bamboo and woods. The maharaja thali was a kind of going back in old bengali kingdom days when they used to eat in bronze plates with different variety of foods. good menu, and the dishes were served and prepared very well. I personally met the chef and discussed about some new contemporary menus which he also liked to add in the bengali platter. Overall very nice place, good and and yeah its a 5 star restaurant so expect the quality of food will be too good.

One of the most hopeless and overrated restaurants I have been to.The place looks haunted. There was no one on the main entrance to tell you to go further to reach the restaurant. Though decor is good and thought provoking. They have the concept of thali . We had taken 3 Zamindari and 3 Gramin thalis. The concept of thali is that you can take unlimited servings. But here every thing you take extra is chargeable. Though hardly any one takes because the number of items are always too many. The thalis came.. The first thing which went wrong was that the dal and vegetables which had come had become cold. The restaurant management should understand that if you fill six thalis and then bring it to the table, things are bound to become cold. All over India specially where ever they serve THAlI they first place the empty thali along with all the empty bowls and then they are filled in front of you. In this manner all the things you get is hot and fresh. Now coming to the helping in one thali only one Luchi or Puri was given. How miserly. If a person does not like to have rice then he has to order extra Luchi which are chargable . At least 2 or 3 pcs should have been given. What would it cost the management to add one or 2 Puris extra ? As it is they are charging Rs 899/- plus 18% GST for a vegetration thali. But it would bring great happiness and fulfillment to the Customer . Some snacks were also given but their helping was so less that is was shameful. . The way they were bring the rest of the items was too confusing. Not only , as it was holiday time and peak hours, the restaurant was full because of which the service was very very slow.I presume they are not equipped to serve full house. They were extremely slow in bringing the next course. By the time they got some specialy made rice and Khichori we thought that all the items were over. The vegetable tasted hopeless and the quantity served was very less. The only grace was the sweets served at the end of the food. They were really really tasty. The napkins were smelling bad and some of them were dirty. They should understand the concept of thali from Barbeque Nation and Rajdhani .Here they are charging a bomb and giving nothing. The items they gave very not even worth Rs 150/-. I would never go there again and also request everybody never ever to go there till they improve. Here they are taking advantage of the fact that all the customer are forced to eat here only as he has no place to go. We go to a Specialist restaurant to enjoy the food along with a wonderful experience. But sorry to write that All of us who went there had a harrowing and a hopeless experience which we will never forget .I request The management to immediately look into the matter and improve things.

Bengal at its Best

If you're spending a weekend at Raichak there's no lunch better than a lunch here. 

The setting is that of an old Bengali bungalow and you truly feel you're in the heart of Bengal.

Although I'm not a really big fan of this cuisine, the food left me satisfied and in awe. The food is served in thalis here and there are only two options. Gramin and Zamindari. Both the thalis were amazing and there were flavours I've never even tasted before. 

All in all if you do come to Riachak, this is one of the best places to eat and experience. The elaborate food will leave you full and sleepy. Nothing better than a good sleep after an amazing meal.

The authentic rural bengal look and feel in both the decor and menu options is the prime novelty of this place. We had a jamindari thali consisting of veg and non-veg dishes. The chicken kasha and bhetki macher jhal were really tasty. The golda chingrir malaikari was not well cooked though. We ended the meal on a high with a wonderful assortment of bengal special rosogolla, makha sandesh and pithe. The makha sandesh was the crown in the jewel of it all.

As you enter this place you will start a journey in a old Raajbaadi.. The decor has been really the spark of this place . It's like you are in early 1900, things we see in museum or history books.

The decor will really make you think where you are, with light bengali classical music in the background. They really know how to set up the mood to eat.

The chef and the staff are very warm. They explained us the whole menu.

The food arrived as being served to a Zamindar. We had ordered Zamindari thali. Round about 20 different items we tasted. After a long time we had over eaten.

A must try place if you are visiting the Fort raichak..

Quality with Quantity & Ambience is the best way to sum up this wonderful experience.Sonartori serves mainly 2 types of thali-Zamindari & Grameen.Both these variants have veg & non veg.The base thali accompaniments are more or less the same constituting of aam panna & tulsi lassi along with rice,luchi,beguni,thankoni patar bora,sukto,dal,alu chokha.Additionally the Zamindari thali serves mutton & Hilsa & the Grameen thali serves prawn chochori & chicken with green chilly.Dessert had rosogolla,taaler paesh,pathi sapta pithe & bhapa curd along with aam chutney & papad.The mishti pan at the end completed the sumptuous meal.

I'm the non stereotypical Bong who doesn't like macher jhol bhaath, and definitely is not a huge fan of shorshe dishes, but this place, what with their Bengali style thali, which was a first for me, and the amazing amazing food with the amazing view of the Ganges and the village, is worth the money and the food for all people. Ranging from vegetarian to non vegetarian, mutton to chicken to fish, this food was definitely worth it.

Sonar Tori is Bangaliyana foodified. As you enter the restaurant you get the feeling of having entered an old traditional dining room. The ceiling is covered with Kabiguru's drawings and poems. Outside the window flows the Ganga with local fishermen spreading their nets and there are model boats too. What more of an idyllic set up could you ask for lunch?

You get a choice of 4 different thalis - 2 vegetarian (Grameen & Jamidari) and 2 non-vegetarian (Grameen and Jamidari too). The basic dishes are similar - bhaja, dal, shukto, shobji, bhat and kochuri. Then there are variations depending on your choice of the thali. It's a massive selection. I loved the "chingri maachher bati chochchori" (Prawns cooked in mustard with potatoes) and the Murgi jhol with kacha lonka (chicken curry with green chillies). The mochar ghonto was a tingler. 

But the sweet dishes took the cake - taaler Payesh, mishti doi, roshogolla and patishapta. You must save enough appetite to enjoy these.

Spoilers - It's a bit pricey though, cost for a couple could be upwards of Rs. 3000. And then, anything that you want extra is charged, even the rice and kochuri, which you get limited portions of in the first place.

Nevertheless, the meal is absolutely five star.

Bengali Thalis are quite unheard of and yet this place offers only that. Price is steep but the food quality is best in class. The quantity and portion sizes are huge and impossible for one person to consume. Ambiance is very serene and calm with pretty scenery. Good for eating out with family and friends.

The food was stupendously bad, starting from the shukto to the rosogolla. The the chicken was old and fibrous, the baby Bhetki waa tasteless. Bad experience overall.

Food, service and ambience is simply awesome and out of the world. One needs to be there to believe it!!
But as they have compulsory basic thali system (over which you can add your own pick) having umpteen number of lip smacking bengali items, amidst choosy rabindra sangeet, it does makes sense to decide sharing the thali, if your appetite is not that voracious or else skip a previous meal and go for sonar tori, empty stomach. 
Rest assured, a risk or sacrifice worth undertaking!! You won't complain.
In both quality and quantity, there's no compromise at all. 
Hope they keep up to their promise shown.

After a lot of hype about the place ....i recently had the pleasure of experiencing the zamindari non- vegetarian thali. The place has an very ethnic and truly amazing decor. However the food served is just about average and the service is horrendous. So just about an average rating would have been lower had it not been the ambience

Nothing is worth a mention besides the traditional ethnic environment. The food was one big challenge for it was all bland and request to make it a little spicier was blatantly turned down that the chef would not make it. Extra helpings were refused too. Don't know why one shall eat at all there after paying a fortune and not getting to eat like they want to. Wouldn't think twice to refuse to eat there again.

In a nutshell: 

Rustic environment, traditional tableware, good service & food that exceeded our expectations ‚Äì as good as / at times better than Oh Calcutta at less than ¬Ω the price.  Desserts were a dissappointment though.

Short Description ‚Äì in case u r in a hurry:¬†

We went to stay at Ganga Kutir, Raichak, an hour away from the hustle bustle of the City of Joy. Set beside the River Ganga, this resort & the adjacent Ffort Raichak has some very good restaurants ‚Äì All of which exceeded my expectations.

The entrance to this restaurant is thru a ramp that has a wooden railing. Once we reached the top, we entered a room that appeared to be from the set of a Period movie ‚Äì a drawing room.

An open door led us along an open suspended pathway into another room ‚Äì the andarmahal. It had a bed, chairs & table, paintings on the wall, utensils kept in a corner & books as well. 

Yet another door led us to the aahar room ‚Äì the dining hall. This had a beautiful range of lamp shades hung from the ceiling.

The tableware was traditional brass (kaasha).

Service was good. The guys were professional, good at their job, good at explaining but not that warm. 

Food, as I mentioned above, floored us.

Detailed Description ‚Äì In case u have the Time to NJOY reading:

The menu had 4 options ‚Äì Zamindari aahar veg, Zamindari aahar (nonveg), grameen aahar veg, Grameen aahar nonveg). Between 5 of us we covered Zamindari aahar (nonveg), grameen aahar veg, Grameen aahar nonveg) & here is the review of the same. 

The nonveg set menu wud have 3 items non vegetarian & the rest of the dishes wud b the same as the veg items. The vegetarians wud have 2-3 unique veg items & the rest wud b common with nonveg platter of the respective Grameen/ zamindari.

Lets start with Grameen Aahar ‚Äì Non veg

Doi tulshir ghol - tulshi did not make its presence felt unless one wud bite into it. The ghol was perfect on terms of consistency, balance of taste. Rate 4.25/5

Gobindo Bhoger Bhat & ghee was what we had as the main cereal. Perfectly done nice aromatic rice. 

We enjoyed the rice with Bhate (boiled veggies/ lentils) & bhaja (fried). The bhate tasted fab & like homemade ‚Äì tempered with punjent mustard oil. Rate it 4/5.

Kalo jeere shukto was lovely. Mild bitter to taste & a combo of sweet & salt. Thick gravy, hint of coconut & humble veggies. As good as it cud get. Rate it 4.25/5

Khoshar chorchori means a dish made from peel of veggies. Yes u got it right. I am alking about veggie peels that r usualy thrown away by all. Soft on the inner side & a mild crunch  on the outer side. Spicy but not that hot, play of salt & mild sweet . Rate it 4.25/5

Chingrir Bati chorchori was a dry curry made from prawns (not very large but not to small also). They were cooked perfectly - they were soft & not rubbery. Flavors of prawn & spices made their presence felt. Rate it 4.5/5

Sorshe Ilish was super pungent mustard base curry of Hilsa (ilish) fish. The fish wud b a sub 1 kilo. Fresh & good to eat but not like the ones with layers of fat. We were told that this was from the adjoining river. Loved the dish & rate it 4.5/5.

Kasha Murgi Kancha Lanka diye was a chicken dish. This was probably the only curry that was somewhat suboptimal. The balance of taste did not work well. The meat was soft & good though. Rate it 2.5/5

Aloo Dum Karaishuti diye was a veggie platter item. Excellent reddish look potato curry with green peas. Somewhat hot & spicy, this dish tasted very good. Rate it 4.25/5

Kumror chakka was pumpkin curry. Awesome. It takes massive calibre to convert the humble pumpkin to a dish this good. Rate it 4.5/5

Narkell Chholar dal was chana daal with coconut ‚Äì a dish that is commonly eaten in Bengali homes usually with luchi. A mild sweet taste is what characterises this dish. Rate it 4/5. 

We enjoyed the curries with Luchi ‚Äì Bengali style deep fried maida pooris. Luchi had a hint of hing ( asafoetida) & was a bit on the crispier side. Perfectly salted so that it cud b eaten as it is. Rate it 4/5

Also managed to taste a bit of Mishti Pulao ‚Äì bengali style sweet pulao. Very Nice. Rate it 4/5. 

We were served the customary Chutney & papad at the end of main course. The green mango chutney was sweet-sour ‚Äì tinge of salt. The mango was with skin. That made it more rustic. Loved it. Rate it 4.25/5

Patishapta is (kind of) a bengali pancake made from rice powder & that has a sweet filling. In winters usually the filling is with Gur & scraped coconut & otherwise with sugar & scraped coconut. This one was with sugar. The outer layer was not soft the way it shud have been. The filling was not great but not bad either. Some people add khoya in the filling & usually aromatic spices r added too.¬†

Those did not make their presence felt either. Rate it 2/5.

Lal doi was Bengali sweet curd. Very nice ‚Äì good balance of sweet & a tinge of sour. Rate it 4/5.

Here is the description of Jamindari aahar

Gondhoraj lebu shorbot - flavourful and really nice gondhoraj ( aromatic citrus fruit of Bengal) sharbat with a slight bitter aftertaste. Very nice. Rate it 4.25/5

Gobindo Bhoger Bhat & ghee was the ceral in addition to luchi.

The beginning of the dish had Paanch Bhaja ‚Äì coconut, posto bora, veggie fry, bori, beguni. 

Bhaja - bori was old and stale and hence had a musty smell. Rate it 0/5.

Posto bora was nice to taste. Unlike the ones made at home from just poppy seed paste, this bora had some 'packing' / filler added to it. Proportion of posto was less. Nevertheless it was good to taste but nowhere near to great. Rate it 3/5.

Beguni was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft inside. Perfect seasoning. Very enjoyable. Rate it 4.25/5

The other veggie bhaja was really yummy to eat. It had posto on its outer layer. Rate it 4.25/5

Loved munching on the crisp fried slit coconut. Rate it 4/5.

Rating of paanch bhaja averages out to 3.1/5

Thakur Barir Shukto was slightly low on salt but directionally very good. Not overtly bitter. Again very balanced and good to taste. Rate it 4.25/5.

Korai shuti moong daal was very nice, home like. Rate it 4.25/5.

Aloo Jhinge  posto was marvellous. It had good quantity of posto unlike in most restaurants.Loved the soft and nice jhingey & the cubes of melt in the mouth aloo. Pungency of mustard oil made its presence felt. Rate it 4.5/5

Chingrir Malai curry had a thick, intense gravy that had the perfect blend of flavors of the jumbo prawns , coconut milk & spices. The prawns were perfectly cooked & they were hence soft & non rubbery. The chingri, we were told was also from the adjacent river ‚Äì super fresh & YUMM. Rate it 4.75/5.

Bhapa ilish was marvellous again. Fresh Hilsa (ilish) fish perfectly cooked ‚Äì super soft, YUMM. The gravy was to die for. Super pungent mustard almost like wasabi made a difference to this dish. Rate it 4.75/5

Kochi pathar Mansho aloo diye ‚Äì meaning curry of baby goat meat & potato. Yes, potato ‚Äì Bengalis love potatoin their muttonb curry & also in their Biryani. Lack of aloo might lead to severe protests by a segment of hardcore fans of ‚Äòaloo in mangshor jhol‚Äô.

The meat pieces were tender & very good. Enjoyed our aloo. Loved the gravy & rate this dish 4.5/5

Hinger kochuri (kachori with hing / asafoetida flavor) was very nice. It was crisp & very good to taste. Rate it 4.25/5

Jamindari pulao was good. It had a slight sweet tinge. Flavors of good ghee made its presence felt. Rate it 3/5.

Raj bhog was rubbery as it was probably refrigerated & served . Average to taste . Rate it 2/5.

Paka phaler payesh was again boring. Almost tasteless, flat, payesh (kheer in hindi / payasam) with apple pieces sprinkled on top. Average I wud say. Rate it 2/5.

Overall rating of food & beverages averages out to 4/5. Incredible score considering so many dishes have been covered. Hats off to the person who planned the restaurant, the menu & the creator of recipes & of course to the people who made the final food .I wud not mind driving all the way from Kolkata to Raichak just for having lunch at Sonar Tori.

The service can put you to sleep. And trust me - you wont get water unless n until you are choking to death; so what if you have requested atleast 8 times...interestingly you will be missed giving a dish or drink in the Zamindar thali; cos they couldn't care less...

The cost  for Peasant Non veg as well as  for Zamindari Non veg is 1500 inclusive of taxes per person.
The food was not so good but the ambience was pleasant. The Zamindari plate looked not so spicy, the sweet dish too sweet. Service better than the food being served.

Tasty, authentic bengali cuisine including seasonal specialities. Portions are way too large for even the hearty eater.  Didn't much care for the contrived decor and the complete absence of directions to it.

Sonartori located at Ganga Kutir at the Raichak on Ganges serves up vegetarian and non-vegetarian bengali thali's. The decor is lovely all distressed and antiquated made like an old Zamindar's house ... and we loved the place. Infact the gentleman who served us summed it up perfectly when he said it was a little musuem cum restaurant.The menu has two different kinds of thali's both having the vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. We settled for the "Jamindari Ahar" Non-Veg Option which consisted of ten items (three non-veg) , plus two sweets and Beler Shorbat. The meal was served traditionally in brass and clay vessels and was a visual treat. 
We were first offered a thali consisting of Gobindo Bhoger Bhaat , Paanch Bhaja which consisted of various kinds of fries including Potato, Palval, Brinjal, etc , Thakur Barir Sukto , Enchorer Dalna , Soona Monger Dal , Jamindari Pilau , Hing Kachori , Papad and Chutney. The non-veg items consisted of Bhapa Chingri (Prawns) , Bhekti Macher Paturi (Fish) and Kassa Murgi Kacha Lanka Diye (Chicken) followed. We ended our meal with Rosagolla and Bhapa Doi ( steamed sweet curd) .
The special mentions are for the Soona Moonger Dal which was superb , the Mango Chutney with the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness , the Bhekti Macher Paturi and the Bhapa Chingri all of which I loved. In the dessert options the Bhapa Doi was brilliant like a sort of an Indian Panna cotta and I loved it.
Between two of us we ordered one thali and extra portion of Rice and Kochuri and an extra piece of Bhekti Paturi and we still had to struggle to finish.Service was good. Down sides... I felt the fries were too oily and  the Chicken Kassa was a bit too spicy for me but I know a number of my fellow foodies will love it. Also this pricing is on the higher side.

Three of us lunch at Sonar Tori yesterday. The festive menu had 4 thali options on offer.
The zamindari veg and non veg and the nawabi veg and non veg.
We had the zamindari veg and the nawabi and zamindari non veg. 
All were excellent except the daal with macher muro which I found very strong in smell and flavour.
The veg items were cooked beautifully as were the non veg items which were served separately.
The sweet selection was excellent and the Tagorean influence over the whole area of the restaurant rooms a great idea.
Overall  a great experience and not too pricey for what we got.
