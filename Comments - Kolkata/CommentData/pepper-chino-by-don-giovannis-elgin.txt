Ending the already vibrant weekend on a high.. 

Was looking forward for an opportunity to visit this recently opened den and it was destined to happen today - it scores high on simple yet soothing decor with bright and vibrant colours alongwith prompt service..

#PEPPERONIPIZZA - #Cheeseburst  made with #GermanPepperoni was the best üçï I have had till date in Kolkata atleast - delicious liquid cheese oozing out from a soft dough with crispy edges and loaded with generous amount of pepperoni and cheese.. Take one bite and the whole thing melts in your mouth - a slight sprinkle of olive oil on an already awesome pizza works magic -  #foodgasm at it's heavenly best.. Burns a slightly bigger hole in your pocket but be rest assured that it's worth every penny.. My first visit left me craving for more - will be back soon..

Verdict: #STRONGLYRECOMMENDED..

Journey of an #EpicureanCineTrotter continues..
