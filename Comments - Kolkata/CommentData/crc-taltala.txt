I ordered a CRC Special Burger. The size was big and filling. There were 2 pieces of chicken and 2 slices of cheese. The place is small and untidy, the service is slow, but the manager at the counter is a pleasant man who speaks humbly and says sorry when the customers complain. Overall, the taste is above average but the service is poor.

We had ordered for tangy wings, crispy chicken,  chilli honey crispy chicken and masala fries. All items were good but i didnt like the honey chilli crispy chicken as it was not at all crispy.

a small place with a decent set up... but trust me the foods they serve are mouth watering... they serve equally finger licking foods as K. F. C... its very pocket friendly try there chicken burger, nuggets and masala French fries...

Really good quality and such reasonable price. You won't be able to differentiate between CRC's and KFC's fried chicken, unless told. 
Staff is cooperative. :)

An amazing place for friends and family. Want something good at a reasonable price? Just hop into this place. 

Must order chicken popcorn, Chicken Cheese Burger and Chilled Cold drinks. 

Staffs are well mannered which is hard to find in places with less budget.

really nice fried chicken burgers and fried chicken.. ¬†have ordered many a times from this outlet and with every order i feel the consistency in the quality. Infact their fried chicken is pretty close to KFC !
