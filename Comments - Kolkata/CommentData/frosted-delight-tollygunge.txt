Dear Srilekha, Thank you for the wonderful cake as per requirement and on time delivery. My nephew liked it so much and was very happy to see his favorite "White Tiger" vanilla cake. I would like to thank entire team for amazing service and making his birthday so special. Special thanks to you for coordinating as I was placing this order on call from outside Kolkata to be delivered in Kolkata. The theme was perfect "White Tiger". Would definitely visit once If I get a chance. Thanks again:)

Ordered for a chocolate truffle custom cake.  
Though the presentation and mis communication with the baker was upsetting. 

The taste saved the experience. The fondant wasn't as sweet as I had expected which was great. And the crunch within the cake was a good balance to the rich chocolate.  
Price wise,  pretty decent.

First thing is that they delivered an eggless cake in like 20 hours when every other bakery said that we had to place an order a day back. 
But hats off. A big shout out for Frosted Delight. Theh serve probably the best eggless cake I have ever had. 
   Starting from the price to the taste everything was good. I got a truffle cake for my father's birthday and I can't be happier that I got the cake from here. 
   This is a must try. And the cake looked jist perfect. ‚ù§
I can't wait to get a cake from here.

Probably one of the yummiest cakes I have had the privilege of having. First things first they bake 100% eggless stuff. Second I got my order prepared and delivered within a span of 20 odd hours during the puja rush here in calcutta. 
Got a truffle for my fathers birthday and it was amazing...from the looks of the cake to the taste. That soft and spongy cake with cream and chocolates and crunchies...the cake blew me away for sure.
It is absolutely worth trying and a complete value for every penny you spend. 
Brownie points for getting it delivered to my doorsteps on a punchami evening...hats off.!!

Khyati turned out to be such a helping hand for a frnds birthday cupcakes..She agreed to deliver them with a day's notice..and inspite of the weather she managed to send them.Talking about‚Äã the cupcakes , they were exactly same as specified and tasted equally good.Though the upper frosting was too sweet but the cake was moist and nice..thanks Khyati for being the saviour

My friends had ordered a "f.r.i.e.n.d.s" themed cake for one of our friend's birthday...the decor of the cake was fine..the problem that we faced was in cutting it...i donot know why it had turned extra sticky...when we tried to slice it and take out one slice,the parts chocolate fondant came out hanging with the slice...it was hanging  like a cape behind the slice...the cake was tasty but it was too sweet to most of our liking.so a portion of the cake had to be thrown away cz only 2-3 could go for a second helping ...the pink sofa that was made on top of the cake for decorational purpose had to be discarded.we had to literally wrestle to take it out..considering the other reviews i am drawing a conclusion that it might have been a bad day...

I was looking for a home bakery who can make customized cakes at a reasonable price. And Frosted Delight provided me exactly what I wanted. The cake was really yum. And it looked exactly the way I wanted. The host was really good as well.
It's the second time that we went for Frosted Delight and the cake awesome to say the least. It tasted really great once again.

I like this place because they have a great sense of baking and the ingredients used for the same are absolutely top class. You can expect the owner to customize the cakes as per your wish. Perhaps, one of the very few places in and around Golf Club Road which can make such good birthday cakes.

Another home baker in southern Kolkata and Frosted Delight is truly a revelation. The quality of the cakes along with the creams used is quite high. Plus, Ms.Khyati can whip up any design that you might have in mind.

I have ordered from here numerous times and will continue to do so. The prices are pretty reasonable.
