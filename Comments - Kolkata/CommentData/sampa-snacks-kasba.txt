Visited this place,5th Dec 2016
Got Momos. They were delicious. Even though the covering was falling apart, it was thin and had chunks of chicken in them which were delicious too. At this price its valuable. They might take some time for making this if its not prepared before you visit. Soup can be reddish, yellowish or white(not consistent daily). 

One of my favourite places. And im a fan of this outset since childhood. Outdoor seating and very easy to locate as its just opposite to the famous Addya Kali temple. No ambiance,crowded place , even hard to cross the road. The prices are sufficient along with their quantity and quality. Only place near my house,where i find my favourite Fish Butter Fry. Previously it tastd good but nw its dull. Chk Fried Rice is yum yum along with Chilli chickn. Singapore chk rice is also good. Their chops,fish fry,chk cutlet taste fair. Being close to my house, have their rolls regularly and i love it. just that ur not safe while its raining but pocket friendly.

When you are in the Bijan Setu side of Kasba, then Sampa Snacks will definitely ring a bell. In fact, it is one of the best  landmarks to use on pedestrians when you are lost in the labyrinths of lanes in the area. This joints has been functional for the last many years and while earlier it was the go to place for snacks when guests made an appearance, the quality and standard of food has gone down by quite a few notches in the last few years. However, their food is edible and thanks to the attachment and sentiments of locals, does a roaring business. While the price is reasonable, they can surely make a little extra effort to make the food tastier.

I have eaten here quite a few times out of compulsion.

It's a tiny outlet which displays it's ready to get items such as chop,cutlets,fish fry,fish finger,etc.

I have tried their Rolls such as Egg Roll,Egg Chicken Roll,Chicken Roll,Fish Fry,Fish Finger,Chicken Pakora,Egg Chop,Veg Chop etc. 

The portion size of the above items were filling but the oil that they use is just not right by any standards or means.The sauce is extraordinarily watery.

Best to be avoided unless one is too hungry and there are no other options.

Sampa snack is one of the oldest and popular fast food joint near chittaranjan school. 

I ate almost everything from them at the time of my school years ans college years.. Food was not so hygenic but still good.... Pricing was fair.

Totally bogus food!!!I wont even dare to try any of their items even if  I'm offered a million bucks!After having their mixed rice I had to consult a doctor for my colic pain.I wish I had given them a big fat ZERO but Zomato won't allow me to do so I had to settle for rating them 1

This is my para-r dokan (neighbourhood kiosk) which serves up decent food ( veg cutlets made out of beetroot which is my favourite and egg roll made of watery sauce) on good days. I like it because it is in my para and my parents bring me stuff when I refuse to eat dal-bhat-macher jhol at quick notice for a thirty year old  like they did when i was a child. Trust your luck not to land up on bad days of stale food.

They serve stale foods. Recently I took a fried rice. It's of a horrible taste. Everyone in my family suffered from vomiting and loose motion having that fried rice. In one word it simply horrible.
