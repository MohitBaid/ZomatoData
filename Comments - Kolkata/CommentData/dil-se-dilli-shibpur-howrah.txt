After shopping we went to the food court for lunch. Wanted to try some pulao. It's a pure veg kiosk. Ordered veg pulao and paneer butter masala. The food tasted okay and was not spicy as i asked. It seemed to me that the items were overpriced.

Pure vegetarian outlet in Avani Riverside Mall food-court. Been here twice in last 3 months.
Specially like their delicious Dahi kabab and malai kofta.
Prices are steep compared to the quantity and sometimes quality of the food.
Good for quick bites & handouts.

I ordered veg thali in which they served nan, rice with paneer butter masala ,veg jaipuri along with, pickle and onion ..i loved to have that as the foods smells great and all are fresh and yummy...but comparison with other malls the charge of thali is little high ...but over all its good and staffs are courteous..

It was a cold winter day and we were quite hungry.... 
Visited the dil se dilli counter and ordered for paneer tikka, it was nice, then we had dal makhani, butter tandoori roti these were average, then we had paneer butter masala which was not so good and Kashmiri pulao which tastes good... Friendly on pocket!
To wash down these we had coke which is all the same at every counter...

The name of this place reminds you of Delhi for sure. Located at the food court of the Avani river side Mall. Deals with quite a good variety of dishes for you.
Went there for a birthday treat, after selecting some dishes from other kiosk we shifter to this one and ordered the Kashmiri Pulao.
The quality of the pulao was quite impressive generally what we usually don't get in the food courts. Quanity was also sufficient for two persons. Taste wise it seemed a kashmiri pulao. Rice used was fresh and preparation was also satisfactory. Mixed with seasonal vegetables which made it even better.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

It is an outlet located on 4th floor, food court of Riverside Avani Mall and self service style food joint. It serves North Indian foods like Thali, Veg biryani combo, Paneer tikka, Paneer chilli & bread variants etc. I have tried it's Jaypuria variant of veg thali which includes Alu do pyaza, Paneer Butter masala, Dal Makhani, 2 Tandoori rotis with basmati rice, papad, picles, salads and Raita, taste was delicious and they provide it quickly too, If you are in Riverside Mall and want to have North style Thali style good food then must try it.
