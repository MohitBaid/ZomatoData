If cake is your love and you are bored by all others then for a rejuvenating experience come to upper cakes.

Although a bit pricey but they always are makers of delightful. 

The pastry and the eggless cakes are so nice .

Specially made chocolate cakes are a big advantage.

It was an small cake shop which serves limited no of cakes, pastries and American snacks. Cakes and pastries were delicious and fresh. Snacks were also fresh and tasty. They also have some chocolates of cadbury and some exported too. But the most I've liked what they have was the Natural ice creams of bombay. They were 100% natural with fruits pulp and very delicious. Service was quick. Hospitality was nice. Staff and owners were friendly. Price was little high. Experience was good.

If you want eggless cakes and pastries the place is quite good,but the price is a bit high.
The one thing I liked about it was that the food was well covered and the place was clean and well maintained.

All veg cakes and puddings..
So we visit here many a times..
Last month, I visited; the uncle and bhaiya that remain here usually were not there and the aunty (who said she is the wife of that uncle) charged high price..
I had to pay the price as I had no option.. I was getting late.. #Unexpected
