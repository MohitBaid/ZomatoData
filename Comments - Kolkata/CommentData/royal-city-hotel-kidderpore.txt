During my childhood days, I used to visit this this in any occasion with parents. So obviously some memories are attached to this place.

We used to had Mutton Chap and Lachcha Paratha. Taste wise it it 4/5 (both). Though the Mutton is a bit oily, but it is okay. And the paratha has a special taste, I really want to know what they actually mix in the dough?? üò∂

Also tried their Biriyani! Quantity wise it is really good! Quality was okay, like 3/5.

Though the place a bit crowdy, but you can visit it ones just for the food at least!!

The food they make is not that good , however this place can be a saviour when you're hungry in the middle of the night.
The kebabs are okayish and biriyani is also nice.

One of the hidden gems in the city. Located in one of the lanes at Kidderpore, Royal City is the place to go for late night biryani cravings. I have visited the place mostly during the wee hours and have always been hosted with a smile and delicious biryani. I have tried both the mutton and chicken biryani. They usually serve big succulent pieces of mutton and once you become a known face, expect stellar service from the humble chachas. The biryani is best paired with the Mutton Kasha or Chicken Rezala. You may also try their Chicken Tandoori.

Good Mughlai food.
Chicken Biriyani and Chap are a must try.
Very reasonable price.
But not easy to locate.
Environment is also not that great.

Visited this restaurant because a friend'd  treated a few of us to lunch. We'd had rumali roti, mutton chaap, and chicken biryani. The roti had been well-made, hot, thinly crisp and tasty. The mutton chaap too had turned out  good, and the biryani had been as par a normal biryani. Over all, a good place for Mughlai & North Indian food.

Thik is a pretty good restaurant located in Kidderpore. The food service is really tasty. We always order the Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala. It's really delicious. They serve a goody amount as far as quantity is concerned. Everyone must try this place for this chicken dish that is simply delicious!! Happy Dining!

the mega paratha with sabzi and halwa they sell as breakfast is the main attraction of this place. one full paratha cannot be eaten by 1 person unless hes a good eater. other items are ok. not very fancy or outstanding.

For all those who still think Arsalan or Zeeshan are places to go if you think North Indian cuisine, this place is a big big surprise. Apart from the interiors (and frankly, you wouldn't care after the food is served), this place is right up the list when it comes to Biriyani. A good break from the oily coloured alternatives, the place offers a sumptuous meal and a definite favorite given that you can hog on at almost all hours of the day.
