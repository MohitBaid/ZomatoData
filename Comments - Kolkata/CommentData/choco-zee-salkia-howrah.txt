Chocozee is the place where my hunt & chocolate cravings ends. Starting from delicious chocolate cakes,pastry,muffin,mousse.. i'm in love with their product!! 

The variety of chocolates & gift items available with them is very hard as well as rare to find in Howrah. Very much budget friendly compared to other cake boutiques in Kolkata/Howrah. Best part is they offer pure veg products.

Moctails,frnch fries,cold coffee,ice cream etc also available.. I like to visit this place every weekend since its situated at stone throwing distance from my house. 

All the best Chocozee.
