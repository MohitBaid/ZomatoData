The delivery was on time and the packaging was good enough to hold the dishes. We have ordered from this place quite a few times and their food has never disappointed us.

We Ordered a Mutton Biryani From Swiggy.I heard so much that the biryani is mind blowing on this restaurant.Thats why I am so hurried to taste this.My initial impression is much nice & taste good also the Potato & Mutton are well cooked.The problem is the Rice,the quality of the rice is not at all.But For 100/- it's much to order something from this restaurant.Hope Something Order soon.

Ordered Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Chaap via Swiggy. The prices are dirt cheap and the food is quite good considering the price. Basically a Take away Counter. Have no idea about Hygiene.

Food is cheap; taste is good; but little oily. If U order your dinner; order by 8pm or they run out of food after that. U have many options to order; d tandoors r v good.

I have ordered Chicken Fried Rice & Chicken Manchurian from here. It's just awesome in taste...This restaurant is very much pocket friendly . But  only take away purpose. If you want to seat there and want to have food there only I can't support that. But for the food purpose it's really good choice in a very cheap, pocket friendly rate. Must try once.

The prices are dirt cheap and food is excellent!! We had ordered for 2 plates of Veg Noodles, one Aloo Biryani, one Boneless Chilli Chicken(regular) and one Boneless Garlic Chicken(regular). The biryani was fabulous! The potato was well boiled and was soft. The noodles was good too. The quantity was sufficient. The biryani could feed two individuals. The chicken items were quite tasty as well. Each of the two came with four pieces of chicken with enough gravy. And all these came for just 210 rupees. Its that cheap!

Very very needed and awaited place at the Dumdum Chiriamore Junction. As it is 5 mins from my house i use to wonder when there will a small Biryani outlet will open here and it is finally here. Quite surprisingly at zomato too thats gives a little more boost to this place.
 They deals in Biryani Chap and Chinese dishes. Last time i had a biryani from here and it was fine for me but this time i took a Chicken chap and it was yumm. At Rs.40/- you get a money Worth chicken chap. 
Still Chinese dishes are yet to be tasted. Prices are super pocket friendly

A super cheap restaurant , better to say just a take away counter. They sell chicken biriyani just for Rs 70. If you r comfortable in street eating u cn bcme a daily customer here. P.S. - Cannot assure u of the hygiene.
