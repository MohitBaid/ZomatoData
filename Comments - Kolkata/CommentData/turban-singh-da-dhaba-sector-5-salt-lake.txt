Located inside the bytes food court. If you are new and following Google map, then u won't find the place, so better call their number. The food is pathetic. Went twice courtesy of cheap little coupons and got disappointed both the times. The chicken Biryani quantity was so less that we had to again eat something else coming outside. Also the chicken thali or the aloo parathas nothing were great. Can't really say value for money.

Food quality was pathetic. Gulab jamun was stale and stinking. Did not expect such kind of food to be served. Being a regular customer from another food delivering apps thought of giving zomato a try however it was disappointing. Twice in a week the food quality of Turban Singh was disappointing. I had heard good about Turban Singh from a few friends of mine and so thought of taking a try. A complete NO No for this restaurant.

Terrible food and staff. Even when you order for home delivery, their staff does not even have the courtesy to take the elevator to your apartment. They want you to come out of your gated society. The last delivery man got very abusive when I denied coming out to the exit gate. It's home delivery, they're yet to learn that.

Briyani is goooood and so are kebabs but only if you go and get it from the outlets itself. 
For home deliveries, the outlet still needs to work on to improve the service. Had a briyani @ store and it was good worth enough with little or no hurt to wallet. Ordered online some tawa rotis and kebab, despite taking additional delivery charge of 30. Kebebs came all cold and the rotis were untearable.
So grab a bite if you are in vicinity but go for other options for the home deliveries..!!

I ordered for a quick chicken thali and all they delivered was rice and roti. Packaging was not worth it either. Although the last time I had ordered from this place i was quite happy, this incident annoyed me big time.

Disclaimer : Review is totally based on delivery. 


Transparency is what I like ?

I had ordered Special Nawabi mutton biryani and mutton do pyaga. It took delivery boy almost 90mins to deliver it even though it has hardly at a distance of 30 mins. 

But, I really enjoyed biryani and mutton do pyaga. 

Mutton was well cooked and tender. 

Packaging was also decent.

They can improve on delivery timings. 

Would explore other cuisines and update this review. 

Till then, it is a decent place to have food delivered at your door step.

Ordered 13 chicken biriyani which were really very very tasty with beresta,alo bokhra and all. Basically all ingredients of a masala biriyani were there. We also had mutton biriyani chicken and mutton kasa. But as per me chicken biriyanis were better than mutton one...
Pocket pinch around 1500 for a group of 14 people. So basically more than value for money

The food was delivered on time. The quality of food was standard. Nothing extraordinary. The chapati could've been softer. It was difficult to chew. Packing of the food was nice. The quantity however, was not in accordance to the price. This thali cost me 229â‚¹ which is slightly beyond the reasonable price. This same thali with the same quantity of food can be available for 100â‚¹. Including delivery charges it should be max 130â‚¹. 229â‚¹ is pushing it.

I have had their rolls â€“ Double Chicken Roll, Chicken Cheese Roll and Mutton Roll. They are very ordinary and considering the price, you can have better rolls at street side stalls. The â€˜Doubleâ€™ tag for the chicken/mutton only adds fancy in the name and do not expect double in the size or number of chicken/mutton pieces.

I have visited this place last week and tried their briyani combo plater.
It is located in Saltlake sector-v area in Bytes food court, very less crowded stall of them all.
We ordered briyani combo plater they took around 30 min to serve.
Briyani was not at all good and was below average in taste, I think road side briyani isÂ  better than this.
Price is also very high, at this price can get a much better briyani.

At first glance, this restaurant might come off as a sub-standard place for food. Do not let this first assumption cloud your judgment, though. For what it is worth, this particular restaurant is better than what it is generally touted to be. Decent food, copious amounts, reasonable price. The perfect eatery when you're on a tight budget.

I ordered a Chicken Do Pyaza, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, and Butter Naan, the quintessential food of a North Indian. I had opted for a home delivery and I was happily surprised when the food arrived because against the general trend of home delivered food by other restaurants, the amount of food was just a tad too much. The Chicken Do Pyaza was well done while the Naan was pretty fluffy. The cake, however, was taken by the Reshmi Butter Masala which was amazingly rich and creamy.Â 

I can't really talk about the ambience of the restaurant as I have never been there but for a home delivery, this joint is one of the better ones to choose from.

Personally, I don't prefer food courts. The prices are usually high and the quality is not at all up to the mark. 
Ordered the Biriyani combo which came with Biriyani and Chicken Chaap. Well, in that price you'll get way better biriyani from Arsalan. The chicken chaap was also not very good. 
Even though the food court was almost empty when we went, they took over 30 mins to serve.

I had visited this location on a Friday, with some of my office colleagues. The location is Bytes Foot Court. Three of us had ordered biriyani from here, we were really excited to taste the food as we had tried the other food courts there and were quite satisfied.Â 

But what a disappointment in the name of Biriyani, whatever taste it had it was not of Biriyani. Such a let down, its never good to compare stuff, so wont but definitely the worst biriyani I had in Sector 5 till date.Â 
Really hope it was not their best day at kitchen and not a regular thing. Though I might be scared to visit the counter again, it is a request that please do improve the quality of food you are serving to your customers.

Their service is abysmally slow and they have no regard for the delivery system which is outsourced from a third party (being neither swiggy, foodpanda or any other professional delivery apparatus ) . The food is mediocre to be very polite and there are far better options around. Give this place a miss and you will not regret one bit. Such places are not worthy of a listing where a sub-total of Rs.164 comes to Rs.257 after taxes and services charge only there is no service. The delivery address being in the immediate vicinity of the restaurant too has not provided any relief.

Location - Bytes Food Court (opposite to BBQ Nation) 
Personally, I don't prefer food courts. The prices are usually high and the quality is not at all up to the mark. 
Ordered the Biriyani combo which came with Biriyani and Chicken Chaap. Well, in that price you'll get way better biriyani from Arsalan. The chicken chaap was also not very good. 
Even though the food court was almost empty when we went, they took over 30 mins to serve.

I had visited this location on a Friday, with some of my office colleagues. The location is Bytes Foot Court. Three of us had ordered biriyani from here, we were really excited to taste the food as we had tried the other food courts there and were quite satisfied.Â 

But what a disappointment in the name of Biriyani, whatever taste it had it was not of Biriyani. Such a let down, its never good to compare stuff, so wont but definitely the worst biriyani I had in Sector 5 till date.Â 
Really hope it was not their best day at kitchen and not a regular thing. Though I might be scared to visit the counter again, it is a request that please do improve the quality of food you are serving to your customers.

I visited this place last Sunday and my experience was horrible, they provided stale food. We ordered Mutton Kasa and it was awful as because it was not fresh and for the next 2-3 days I had to face digestive issues. I would have given negative rating if I would have that option.

I don't remember rating any place this low,ever. But needless to say they rightfully deserve it. Situated in the bytes food court this is the most less crowded stall of them all. Ordered change chicken cheese roll.,it was worth less... we didn't find any hint of cheese and the chicken filling was sweet. It wasn't close to anything how a roll should taste.i am never returning there.

The name itself is so interesting! I was intrigued and wanted to try their food. Opted for a home delivery. Tied their biriyani and a chicken to go with it. Have tasted better biriyani but not bad for a joint like this.

This eatery is located at BYTES FOOD COURT inside Infinity Building, which is just behind BIPL Building. This is the heart of sector 5 and is frequented by office goers. I used to be a regular at BYTESÂ  and this outlet serves reasonably good food. Service is okish. Ambiance, well there isn't much to talk about, it's like any food court. This is a good place to hangout during lunch hours or post office.

The only north indian outlet in bytes. Dishes are not so good in tastes. OK-ish for a quick and affordable lunch. Biriyani is a big NO NO from my point of view. The thalis that they had is nice which lots of variety in it. Needs to increase they quality.

Had got Mutton BriyanI delivered. Delivery was on schedule. Didn't like the briyani much. Mutton was well cocked, but rest was below average. 2 potato's one small and one large. In the two of the boxes chunk of white rice. Masala was too low and briyani aroma or smelll was completely missing.

Got the biriyanis ordered through FoodPanda and was delivered on time. One thing I understood from their preparation that they are pretty liberal on using oil in their food. Got the combo of mutton biriyani, mutton kasa, raita and salad.
- As far as the taste would go, it was my first time at TSDFG, and I was dissapointed to the point of avoiding TSDFG in future
- Mutton kasa needs a special mention here, the curry was the same one as you would get if you order chicken curry/ kasa. No aroma of mutton and was so oily that I had to pour some oil out of the container before I could have it
- Biriyani mutton piece was under-cooked and tasteless again
- Good thing is their delivery time
- Final verdict, I had a bad luck I would say with TSDFG, try it if you want to

Had ordered food from here once. The taste was great compared to the price. Though I haven't visited the place but this is a recommended eatery if you wish to order your food and have a taste for punjabi dishes.

Located inside the Bytes Food Court at Saltlake Sector-5 (Infinity Benchmark building), this is one of those places which always remain crowded for the lack of better options available in the food court. At lunch hours the food court is so crowded you will find it difficult to grab a seat. 

I have had lunch at this place once which I guess wonâ€™t be repeated again in near future! I have tried their Badshahi Chicken Biriyani and my perception about lip smacking typical Kolkata Biriyani has changed ever since then. I thought biriyanis can be either good or very good, it is tough to prepare a biriyani which tastes bad, but I was proved wrong! :) This place proved me wrong by serving me a plate of pale, short-of-ingredients, not-so-tasty, non-aromatic â€˜Badshahi biriyaniâ€™ (as the name goes). If I go by the name this should have been prepared like a royal dish, but it was light years away from that :) 

The biriyani had a sweet potato which was not soft i.e. not well-boiled, it had a chicken piece which was chewy and the masalas have never sipped inside, it was kinda tasteless and infact I felt the proportion of salt was also less in the entire dish. The quality of rice was okayish and the overall biriyani looked great to be honest, but looks are really deceptive as it didnâ€™t even deliver the basic aroma of biriyani which we look out for before we start hogging! It was really tough to finish this entire plate of biriyani, and you believe it or not, it took four of us to somehow gulp it down! Iâ€™ll rather stay away from this place but I wish them all the luck and hope they take the comments, feedback and criticisms positively.

Cheers!

Last month I bought Masala Kulcha and Chole Bhature from the food garage. It seemed to me that the service was a bit slow but may be that was due to preparation time of the breads. Since there was a long gap between the time the parcel was collected and the food was consumed, the bhature lacked the look but that shouldn't have affected the taste. I didn't like the Bhature much (it lacked the taste of curd) as well as the Chole which had some special masala added to it however my mother found the Chole tasty so it's a matter of personal preference. Masala kulcha was also ok for me. The plus points were that the Kulcha was quite soft (my mother commented that she never had such a soft kulcha) and the chole was so well boiled that it could be easily consumed.

Weekend means a definite food journey. So, this time I picked up this food garage after a movie session at RDB.  Located conveniently just opposite to it in the ground floor- the bytes food court. The food station is basically a counter over here...so no ambience or any such thing. The food was good...we settled for the mutton biriyani and kosha combo. The kosha was quite nice, the mutton was good. The biriyani, though could have been a bit better was ample in quantity. The raita was also well prepared.

Turban Singh Da food garage is a north indian restaurant in Bytes Food Court, Ssector V, Salt Lake. Popular among office goers of this area, this north indian restaurant serves standard north indian dishes. Good ones among them are chicken butter masala, dal makhani, Chicken tarka. You can also try the vegetarian dishes. The service is quick. They do serve half and full plates of every dish, We also tried the chicken biryani. The quantity is good enough for one person.

Its situated at bytes food court. 

I visit the place couple of times. The biriyanis are very pocket friendly and tasty. basically their speciality is in Punjabi cuisine like Aloo Paratha, Chicken/Paneer butter masala, Dal makhani etc. There are veg and non veg thalis.

overall its very good.

Was feeling hungry and wanted to dine outside, so just casually visited this outlet inside the "Bytes Food Court" of Sector V.

Luckily, it was a great discovery for me!
As the name suggests, they serve Punjabi as well as North Indian cuisines. I ordered Paneer Butter Masala, Dal Makhani, Raita, Naan and Veg Biryani for a heavy lunch. Dal was just average and paneer was tasty. Raita was just too good - cold and contained a nice mix of onions and cucumber. Naan was also okay.
But the most outstanding was their Veg Biryani - Â one of the better ones I have had in the recent past. Long grain rice cooked with adequate proportion of gobi, beans, peas and a fat piece of aloo - loved it.
Staff was courteous and service time is reasonable. Quantity served is average.
Ambience is also nice - adequate seating arrangements with some Holly numbers playing in the background.
Looking forward to more visits in the future.
Cheers !

Went to opium for lunch with a couple of friends, but found it closed (surprisingly) due to waterlogging. Since we didn't have much time in hand, we moved to Bytes for a quick lunch at the food-court.

Since all of us were in the mood of having Indian food, we opted for Turban Singh. The counter was more crowded than the others. The menu looked fine with a good number of options. We ordered five assorted Paratha combos with Mutton, Chicken and Veg respectively. At first, we ordered 3 combos (@1:25 PM) and after 15 mins we ordered two more. The first 3 orders were served at around 1:45 (20 mins after ordering). However, the last two seemed to be lost in limbo. At 2'o clock we asked the manager/cashier about the order and apparently then only he passed the orders to the kitchen. We kept on following-up with him and other people at the counter but it was very clear that they just started preparing the order. Surprisingly, all other orders, which were placed after ours, were already served. Finally, our last two orders were served after 45 mins of ordering. For service, I would give 1 out of 5.

Price (2/5) -Â  Both Parathas were average sized and thin. Mutton/Chicken servings had two small pieces, accompanied with a Raita type liquid (which was supposed to be "curd") and half-spoon of pickle. All these for Rs. 189 (Mutton) was just expensive.

Food Taste (2/5) - Aloo Paratha, Onion Paratha and Plain Paratha all had exactly the same below average taste. Any street side stall in Sector V serves better tasting Aloo Parathas. The chicken curry (not "kosha") was average. But the mutton pieces (in the mutton curry) were more suitable for making shoe soles rather than for human consumption. The Jeera-Aloo was the best among the lot.

Overall I would rate this place 1.5 out of 5. NOT recommend, if you love to enjoy you food. Go there ONLY when you do not have any other options. Amen.
