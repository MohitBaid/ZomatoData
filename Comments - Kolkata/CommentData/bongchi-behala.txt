Just ordered once. 

Chicken friend rice - Average.

Chicken  gravy - Average at best.

Fish fry - terrible. Fish was black inside. Had to throw it away. Will never go near this place again.

Food is really tasty with a right portion n presentation... I ordered online for a home delivery. Which was well on time... Mutton kasa in main n Popcorn chicken as a starter is a treat for the tastebuds......
