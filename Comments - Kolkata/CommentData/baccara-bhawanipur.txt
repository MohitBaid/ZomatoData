Perfect place to spend a private time with your partner as well as for the people in groups comprising approx 7 people.. Do not visit the place before 20th of this month as they are not officially opened as of now.. Drinks will be available only after 20th + the range of hookah is tooo high right now it will weight 700 bucks right now but will be bought down to 400 after the above mentioned date.. It also comprises of a club at the upper floor.. Totally afgani style place.. So a thumps up for the place..

This was Celavi before now given an entire new Arabian look and thus renamed baccara. Superb decoration and music in line with the Ambience. We called for Philadelphia stuffed mushroom and they just melted in the mouth.

Ambience is great, Food is also amazing.
For vegetarians Panner tikka and maharaja platter is a must try. One of the best Paneer Tikka i had.
Hookah was good.
Service was excellent
A person named Mr. Chandrashekhar was on our services throughout and the other staffs were also helpfull.
The place is also very pocket friendly (without Sheesha)
Overall its a must visit place.

Totally not worth the price. Ambience is good but the staff and shisha is way behind good. 
I won‚Äôt recommend anyone to go there and waste their hard earned money. Instead go to any nearby cafes like Tyre Patty or Biker‚Äôs Cafe and you‚Äôll get the worth of your money.

I had visited this place on new year's eve with few of my friends and we all loved this place. I had a table booked in the first floor which is beautifully decorated with Afghani theme. This floor is for the one who wants to spend time with friends in a pleasant environment with live music performed by a singer which is very soothing. On top of this the hookahs in this place is very royal in looks and its the best I have ever had in Kolkata.Along with drinks we ordered some starters of chicken (Tandoori and Manchurian item), fish and baby-corn which were good and the service time is also very less. The staff were gentle and polite. This has a dance bar in the second floor which was filled with people dancing and jumping and the songs that were played were fantastic. The sound system used is of very high quality. It has a very stylish bar counter in this floor where we had hookah and vodka shots and we danced till new year started. Overall it's a fantastic place where you can enjoy both the pleasant and dancing as well as bouncing environment of this place. For me it's a must visit in Kolkata.

It is a new place to hang on near Merlin Homeland mall in bhawanipore. We recently had a get together there. The place is not fully operational yet (going to be so from 15th January, 2018 onwards). Alcohol is still not available except for the weekends. The cafe has got different levels. Ground floor has got cosy sitting arrangements. We headed for first floor where they have separate cubicles for groups. The decoration of the space is really warm for a chilly winter afternoon. Vibrant colours of the wall, curtain & cushions caught our eyes. They have a hookah bar here & the sitting arrangement is a surprise for you! 

 Coming to the food, we ordered an array of items starting from peri peri chicken, tandoori baby corn, potato cheese balls to pasta arabiata, noodles & fried rices along with chicken side dishes. The taste was really good & so was the amount. The staffs were  courteous & helpful, starting from explaining the menu to helping us shifting to the 2nd floor night club for having the main course(as ours was a group of 11 people), they had done a great job. The nightclub on the 2nd floor is a place to go for if you want to shake your legs with friends. A great place to go in groups &  also for couples!

Visited this place on new year eve.A newly opened restaurant in bhawanipur area near homeland mall.The restaurant is simply amazing for there high quality food, Ambiance & service.
Food- Great taste and good presentation without pocket pinchüòä (A perfect combo)
Ambiance -they have 3 floors with 3 different ambiance ,my fav is the Arabian themed ambiance on the 1st floor (Highly recommended) ,
Staffs are very friendly and well trained.
Would be surely visiting the place again in near future.

Located in Bhawanipur, this place is newly added among the cafes in the city. The decoration is par excellence. It is all Arabian themed. The staff communication and courtesy is very good. The food is okay too. They have an awesome collection of music. The ambience here is great too. They only have special kind of hookah bases which is the main attraction of the cafe. But the biggest drop is, their pricing for the same. They have a fixed price of ‚Çπ700 for hookah, irrespective of the flavour and base you choose. And oh yes, most importantly, they charge ‚Çπ100 for just a coal change, which is simply just TOO high and not worth at all. Overall, a must visit!

Worst place i've ever visited in the town after mocambo.
High condemned.
I would suggest u not to spend ur precious money in a shit place lyk baccara.
One of my friend went to the tuition in bhawanipur itself.Suddenly we informed him about our plan to go there(Baccara).When we all reached the place,that friend of mine was wearing slippers.The guard outside baccara rejected our entry just because one of my friend was wearing slippers and when we informed them about the power of social media that how can we spoil their cafe by spreading this message then they got conscious and then they told us to come in.
How can someone judge other just by their slippers?
The ppl lyk this are spoiling the whole society and creating inequality.
Much more to say but this much would be sufficient to get u all about wat happened.

Only keeping a large base for hookah doesnt make the place and ratings large.
Total waste of money and time
The staff there has no way to behave and not only the staff since the food was pathetic and not bought as per my will the chef also behave very rudely
The new comers always welcome mistakes and try to resolve them but these people are full of wrong ego and attitude
A very small and bad menu
Bad hookah
Bad food
Bad service
In short *DoNotVisit*

This place is a Gem !! The USP of this place is :
>Superb Interiors
>Arabian Theme
>Khalil Mamoon Hookah¬†
>Royal Seating Comfort
>Very Good Food
>Good Service

We tried their Tandoori Baby Corn,Veg biryani,Chilli Garlic Noodles and Arabiata Pasta.Every item was very good.Pasta was too spicy,could be improved.Their Khalil Mamoon Hookah was very good in looks but from inside it was just normal hookah.

Must Visit.

Food price is a little on the higher side although. I‚Äôm sure once it‚Äôs all set, it‚Äôll be awesome üòé 
P.S. the large sized hookah is something worth a try.
