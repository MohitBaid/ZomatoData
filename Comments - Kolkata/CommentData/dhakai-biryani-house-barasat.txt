I have ordered from this place a couple of times. For the first time, the biriyani was okayish. The last time I had biriyani it was not fresh. Not going to try from here anymore!

Went to this restaurant for its location as it is very close from madhyamgram choumatha. We ordered 2 chicken and 1 mutton biriyani. Price is slightly high. Quality of food was very much low. The pieces of chicken and mutton was satisfactory but the rice was tasteless and we got a baked fly in the biriyani also. Which was disgusting.

Pathetic biriyani....
Donot waste money here for biriyani.
Qyantity is good but quality sucks.
Mutton biriyani-160
Chicken biriyani-130.
Service--pathetic.
They always serve stiff meat...be it mutton or chicken.

Its not the best biriyani I had in Barasat but its a hot joint because of the location and the amount of rice they give. Quality is average compare to pricing.

Excellent quality of food within pocket-friendly rates. Service has always been up to the mark here. A must combo should be chap with biriyani. Both are lip-smackingly delicious. One can easily drop in here for street food like veg and non-veg rolls. Located at the hub point at Barasat, the ambience could be improved with increase in seating space.

Dhakai Biriyani House is located at Barasat.

Ambience is average with little sitting arrangements.

Tried chicken Biriyani , which was bland and oily. Meat pieces were of big size but not tender.

Price is a bit high compared to its average quality , but quantity was sufficient though.

Those who have tasted the biriyani of Arsalan , Aminia etc would find it average.

Dhakai Biriyani House is located at Barasat.

Ambience is ok with little sitting  arrangements.

Staffs are ok. Service is fast.

Tried Mutton Biriyani , which was average and oily. Meat pieces were not that tender as it should be.

Pocket pinch is on the higher side compared to its average quality. Quantity was sufficient though.

For me it is a take away joint in Abhinandan market. The biriyani is decent over here but not the chaap. They have increased the price and decreased the quantity.

If you are not comparing Dakai with other premium quality all over the Kolkata, then you must like it. And the¬† mutton and chicken kasha is also good. 
One thing more I want to share they started a new counter for selling Roll. It is good for us we found a new Roll shop than Lazabab.

Their specialisation is on biryani.. . both chicken and mutton are good. Bit sweet though.. Chaps are also good.. but they need a urgent upgadation on their furnitures and ambience...
