This was on my wishlist since a long time not just due to the unique concept but also due to my eternal love for pizza. My expectations got shattered on my very first visit at this place with my nephew!

As we both entered the joint, we saw three customers already sitting and therefore we had to stand. Not that we did not want to sit, but the tables alongside being dirty made us refrain from sitting when one of the customers left. While the time we were standing, the staff did not even inform us that they had a second floor where we could relax ourselves. On discovering it ourselves, we went up to see that it was empty the whole time and yes the atmosphere was like a furnace with no window or exhaust fan nearby. We felt uncomfortable and got down and finally placed our order which took 20 minutes to appear.

üìç Cheese and Barbeque Chicken : The cone on one hand was hard to chew and the excess cheese as the topping made the taste more wierd. While unwrapping the pizzicone, we could distinctly notice that the bread was not fresh. With every forceful bite to it, we also couldn't discover chicken in it.

üìç Chicken Fiesta : This one was decent, though. But then again the bread was hard, clearly depicting that it was not fresh.

The staffs were discussing among themselves and seemed to be least bothered when it came to service. Had to ask for tissue paper as well as ketchup twice.

I don't really know how they'll keep their client base with such pathetic service. Even though the concept is unique, they should focus on the authenticity, taste and most importantly the hygiene of the food.

Disappointed. They require a hell lot of improvement.

If you bored with the same pizza then konetto Pizza is the ultimate alternative! It's a completely new concept which is going to overwhelm the city for sure! You'll get flavour in every bite & if it's already in your wishlist then go ahead.. it won't be a disappointment.

Went to Park Street today for the sole purpose of trying this one out. However, we were the only customers in the shop. The service was good. I liked the way they made the pizza...something not known previously. I was expecting somewhat, cleaner place. The place is well lit.
Coming to the food, they don't compromise on cheese. However, I feel the item was somewhat overpriced. I had tried out Chicken Overloaded. The pizza didn't seem to satiate me. However, it was nice trying out something new.
You can go once and have it but I won't be a regular customer to that place.

‚ùáLocation- Take the lane beside Vardaan Market (On the Right Hand u will get a showroom of Wildcraft). Walk for 2-3 mins, take right from Medipoint & walk for another 3 mins, Konetto pizza will be there on your left.

‚ùáAmbience- A small place with li'l wooden chairs. There's a seating arrangement upstairs as well.

‚ùáStaff & Service- Well Behaved staff. Really slow service. Specialities were not available. The only thing they had today was SPICY CHICKEN & CHICKEN FIESTA. They didn't have onions for the toppings, so had to opt for corn. Ordered Coffee and irish cr√®me, but even that was not available, so had Chocolate shake instead.

‚ùáFood- We ordered üîò Chicken Fiesta üîò Chocolate Shake.
The konetto pizza was very tasty, loaded with toppings & chicken chunks, cheese & capsicum. The sauce was super yum, tangy & moderately spicy. No complaints regarding the taste and quality of what they serve.
The Chocolate Shake didn't have added sugar but tasted amazing!

Want to tick off all that they have in menu but, unfortunately they're OUT OF STOCK mostly! üò™üò™

Located in camac street,it's mainly a takeaway joint with very few seating arrangement- hardly 10.
Pizza toppings baked in Cornetto crust was in my wishlist for long time!
It was altogether a different taste,with adequate pieces f chicken and cheese.
The only negativity was the unavailability of some on veg dishes ,also the service was painstakingly slow.

This was in my wishlist for long. Finally got the chance to visit.
Location: I felt this is bit in a odd location. Given Location is park Street but its nearest from maidan area. 
Ambience: small place. It would be very difficult to sit if there is even 10 people. 
Food: ordered cheese and barbecue chicken and chichen overloaded. The guy on the counter misunderstood and gave us the grand sized ones Which is quite difficult for one to devour completely. 
Taste: i loved it. But. There is a but. In a normal pizza the pizza sauce is spread evenly on the crust. And comes with every pizza slice. But here the pizza sauce is all the way down in the cone. So first you are having the toppings then the sauce basically which becomes a lil difficult to eat and also the cone was hard. 
In shakes i ordered mixed berry one which was really tasty. 
I also ordered for gulab jamun cheese cake. But it wasn't available. 
I would definitely recommend others to go and try.

When u get irritated from oil of pizza in your finger tip... If u r fond of roll... Thn it is a new experumental joint... Where you find pizza in a new dimenssion... Piza in a handy cone.
Ambience is quite good, friendly. Staffs are very helpfull if you get confused in choosing the right dish that Punjabi guy (specialist in taste) will surely help you and trust their choice, they will never let you down. And one thing they have sitting arrangements in upstairs it is very small in size. Rather sit in downstairs.
Now come to food. Pizza is just awesome. A complete new experience. Full with stuff and cheese. Chesse is very melty. But the bread is bit hard, it like bread stick. But they have to made it crusty because they made pizza inside the bread not pizza in dough of flower. Complete different taste. Another speciality is their milk shake. It is completely natural no sugar or ice cream added but it tastes fabulous. I take coffee with irish chocolate. And price is quite pocket friendly. 
As a food lover you must go go there for a quike bite. It is just behind the camac strret pizzahut. Try and find the treasure.

Bored with regular pizza?? Pizza bread?? Well a right place to go!!

Let's start with staffs
Very cooperative in one word they will guide you.. and if you have gone there for the first time and don't know what to have then try their suggestion...a taste to die for...

Now bread
They have a hard crust which is actually tasty
With loads of cheese and chicken and tasty sauce

Milkshake (I had coffee with Irish chocolate)
Is my personal recommendation...they really make it heavenly...

In a nutshell it is perfect place to go to if you want something different!! Loved it..:')

Half the items in desserts as well as pizza were not available, toppings like jalapeno unavailable and the worst part is the milkshakes- we bought 2 bottles for takeaway..by the time we reached home, the froth had settled and thats when we saw the actual quantity they give - almost half bottles empty!!! Picture attached here is of sealed bottles and clearly shows the loot! Not just that, the shakes were mostly watery and didnt taste good at all! A fairly new concept for kolkata and pizzas tasted quite good but a miserable failure due to this poor availability and cheap tactics. Highly disappointed.

Konetto pizza is situated more towards Camac street. To be more precise, it's right opposite to pantaloons. I was confused myself when it was written park street when it's actually in Camac street. 

Coming back to the service and food, it was below my expectation. We arrived there around 7:50pm and my friend and I are strict non-vegetarian. So we wanted to eat something in chicken items. We were informed that there's no non-veg items. Then we decided to go for paneer items. They informed us there's no paneer items. When we questioned why isn't so many items available, they said their stock isn't refilled since yesterday. I worked in the hospitality business for long, they are supposed to restock immediately by contacting their warehouse or the seller that they buy from. Totally disappointed. Nevertheless, we ordered two veg farm house, with and without mushroom. 

They have another floor which is very small. The place is a bit unclean, and when we were seated downstairs, one of their servers told us to move somewhere else as they wanted to sweep the floor. I found that extremely rude behavior, telling us to move. I saw the bowl that they mix ingredients in, dirty and unwashed. Gloves looked dirty. The people behind the counter was abusing and laughing. Very bad personality. 

The food was good. Service could have been better.

Every new outlet brings in a new excitement with it such that you expect a great experience and something that can take you by surprise. 

Our first visit to Konetto Pizza was in vain when the concerned people informed as that they ran out of cheese at 12:45pm. 

Our second visit was again met with disappointment when the ones serving informed that they do not have the ingredients to make the cone 'pizza'.

A third attempt did not make us leave the place from the gate though. The place is reasonable and the quantity is pretty much justified. You also get to select between the thick crust and thin crust. However, it does not taste anything like pizza. Overloaded with cheese on the top, it looked extremely appealing. But a bite into the cone 'pizza' immediately made us realize that the Barbeque Chicken and Cheese pizza cone did not have a Barbeque sauce but used a modified version of ketchup. The distinct flavour of ketchup was a major let down. Moreover, in place of chicken, they used chicken sausage which itself has a distinctly different flavour. 

Konetto Pizza was a huge let down. 

PS- They do not clean the tables and the enormous amount of flies makes it difficult to wait for your order.

We ordered for a Cheese & Barbeque Chicken grand with a Chocolate Brownie Konetto. The pizza cone was full of cheese and chicken as the name suggests & was tasty.. The sweet cone was filled with brownie on the top and was also good.. The prices are also reasonable and a new style of having pizza üçï

Oh God, I had such high expectations when I spotted this place. There were 4 of us and we tried four different flavours. 
All of the 'pizzas', as they call it (lol), were very bad. Doesn't taste even descent. Just some white tasteless stuffing inside of it. 
The place was not overpriced per say. But I'm pretty sure you will regret your decision, once you're done halfway with the cone.

Visited the place today in the afternoon for lunch. We ordered 3 pizzas, farmhouse (grand), spicy triple tango (grand) and barbeque chicken and cheese (eco). "Grand" pizzas are thin crust and slightly bigger than "Eco", which is the regular crust pizza. All three tasted amazing. Each bite was filled with sumptuous¬†amounts of stringy cheese and toppings and the crust was crisp! We also ordered shakes - strawberry and coffee & irish cream, which tasted good as well.
The staff was friendly and courteous. The service was prompt. Really looking forward to visiting the place again soon to try out the other pizzas on offer.

You get to see a whole new concept and way of having pizza. This outlet in park street, near st Xaviers college, is quite a big one, with seating arrangements in the ground floor and 1st floor as well. 
The prices are very reasonable! 
The staff is somewhat slow. While placing our order, the one at the desk was utterly confused. But that's okay, the food was worth it. 
We had a cheese and barbecue chicken konetto pizza and a chicken overload konetto pizza. 
The 1st one, as the name suggests, was full of cheese. It tasted really good. 
The 2nd one was yumm too. 
They also give you oregano and chilli flakes. And it will give you the same feeling you'll get while having a real pizza. 
Totally worth it. Will be visiting soon, to try the other ones!

Pizza cones is fast becoming the 'it' food right now. Following the trend, even I visited this quaint little place with my friends. We ordered the Chicken Tikka cone, Barbecue cone and the Farmhouse cone. 
Now, we were shocked when we were told that we would have to wait for 20 mins since they were out of cheese which was a little stupid since they're basically serving cheesy pizzas!
However, we decided to wait. We went upstairs but then we were shocked (again!) by how dirty the tables were.
But, the cones were undoubtedly tasty! In fact we all really loved the taste and were satisfied. If they work on their inventory and the cleanliness then they have the potential to become much more!

If you want to taste pizza loaded with cheese and chicken then this is the place...well almost! Except that you get these savouries stuffed in a cone. So we ordered a barbeque chicken and mushroom cone that too a grand one and we had an amazing experience. Now the twist is that the grand cone has a thinner crust than the regular cone which means you get to enjoy the filling more. We preferred not to load the filling with onion and capsicum and other veggies cause that according to us dilutes the taste of cheese and chicken. The pocket pinch was very reasonable and I would give a five star for the courteous staff. Quite a nice cozy joint on wood Street. Would recommend it highly and I am definitely coming back again and again.

If you love Pizza( You have to!) and stuff served in cones, Konetto Pizza brings forth an amazing combination of them for you. I had visited their Park Street outlet located just behind Camac Street Pantaloons.¬†The outlet though appears small has decent enough seating and you can even watch them make your food right in front of you if you want. It is also very easy on the pocket so a great place to be already. I was a bit disappointed in their service time but they were baking the pizza cones from scratch after all.¬†Pizza Cones is what this place specializes in, both sweet and savory. They come in two sizes- Eco and Grand with a variety of toppings with even the option to choose your own toppings or I should say filling cause it is a cone after all. The Eco size is big enough to satisfy your immediate hunger though the Grand can obviously do a better job.¬†I had chosen two Eco sized with my own choice of toppings and they both were served hot with melting cheese on top just like a pizza. I thought it was absolutely delicious and the cone was stuffed with filling/topping to the very bottom. Both the quality and quantity in the pizza cone was really good in my opinion.¬†Aside from this they serve dessert pizza cones and milkshakes which I have not had a chance to try yet but will certainly do so soon. Can't wait to head back there.

Konetto Pizza is the new kid in the town They are serving Pizza in a cone.We tried there Veggie Paradise and Fiery Ride.Veggie Paradise was good  although I found Fiery Ride on the okayish side.We also tried their strawberry chocolate shake which was good as it was natural in taste without any sugar.Its something different I would say.
PS - One time try to banta hai

It was a childhood dream to eat pizza from a cone and Konetto Pizza spoilt it. Visited this place for quick dinner, reached at 8 pm, was told that it'll take 30 mins time but we still waited and got our order at 9:15pm. We had ordered a farm house and veg paradise. To our surprise, the servers didn't know what the ingredients were for each. They asked us several times. There was no cleanliness and the were using the same gloves to make non veg and veg pizzas 
After a long wait when we got the cones, the bell peppers were raw as they hadn't warmed it properly. The overall taste was very bad. It was so stuffy inside. We went outside and threw it. Never ever visiting again. 
They ruined pizza for me

Most of you have eaten a pizza at-least not more, but once in their lifetime . But this one is a modified version . Inspite ¬†of a old regular flat pizza , this newly created savory-sweet ¬†cone is served with ¬†a stuffing of your choice . Be it a Barbecued chicken to a chicken terminator to a veggie paradise to a gulab jamun cheesecake ¬†, you name it and it is made live .

It has been 2 week since this newly opened outlet ¬†has made it‚Äôs impact in kolkata . Located just opposite to pantaloons‚Äôs pizza hut , next to wow momo‚Äôs . The price range is also really reasonable , starting from just RS 55 and going to RS 145 .

So just to see how good it is i ordered ¬†‚Äúcheese and barbecue chicken‚Äù , which was really delicious and the cheese melted in our mouth with perfect pepperness ¬†of jalapenos with mayonnaise and oregano .

The second one was ‚Äò¬†ASS BLASTER ‚Äù .¬†Going by the name i think you all must have understood that this has been a spicy one . but it was really good .

But the ‚Äù¬†Gulab jamun cheesecake ‚Äù¬†failed to satisfy me much . While eating this , i did not get whether i was actually eating a cheesecake or not . So it was a bit disappointing for me .

But the overall experience was good and the ambiance and the staff was also good . Just there should be more cleanliness.

Located at wood street ( Opposite street of Vardhan market), the most hyped eatery now in the city.It would be so much better if they had a food truck service going on since the there are not many options to be chosen from.The fact that I didn't get the Brownie chocolate konetto is one of the reason why I gave 3.5.They should be well prepared and be ready with the stock. Saying no is huge let down.So I had to opt for chocolate mousse konetto , Cheese and barbeque chicken konetto ,Ass blaster and Chicken Mexicana.I loved the filling of every konettos .They are not so generous with the cheese though.¬†Ass blaster surely did not live upto its name. It wasn't spicy at all.But the major drawback was the kone. It was thick and dry yet cunchy but way to difficult to eat.They should work on their dough.Also they need to work on their service. Extremely slow.

Tried the veggie paradise.. tasted good but the management is horrible.. they were messing up the orders, cone sizes. Thankfully I wasn't given the non veg pizza and they did make up by giving us a complimentary mousse konetto .Under staffed and cant handle too many customers at once. They dint even clean the tables and put tissue boxes also. Please improve your service and hire more people or probably get more machines.. your uniqueness is getting down the drain..look into it

One of the first kind in Calcutta, this little place is a blessing in disguise to the number of places in Camac Street. 
Their three toppings non veg pizza & farm house pizza have the perfect amount of cheese & generous filling. The eco version although a smaller version is yet filling. To add to all this, the place is economical. 
PS - I had gone at a time when the place just opened for the day so naturally it would take them more time to serve & in order to compensate for that, I got a glass shake (which was again good). Cheers to their service.

We ordered 3 farmhouse pizza. The taste is really authentic. Value for money. The cones had a generous filling of cheese and toppings. Highly satisfied. Also they gave us a oreo shake complimentary. The staff is really courteous and friendly. Great visit. :)

Tried the Farm House Konetto. It was really cheesy and tasted delicious. It was baked to perfection. Loved the twist to the conventional pizza.

I thought I would enjoy  pizza in a cone as it would be handy and delicious but the cone itself was not good and broke while I  was eating it. The cone was burnt at places and the pizza sauce was condensed at a tiny section in the bottom while rest of the pizza lacked the sauce. The toppings were decent. They had even put mayonnaise in the cone and it was far from pleasant. 3/4th of the way down the taste gets really bad there is no cheese,no toppings just a lot of  sauce(the sauce was very sweet) and it was basically inedible. The whole idea is a gimmick and was not executed well. Would not suggest anyone to visit.

We ordered Mexican wave grand & choco mint shake large at this new outlet in Wood Street.Crisp cones filled with melting cheese and veggies with seasoning similar to dominos .Milk shake was watery & nothing great but the cone pizza as a concept was unique and worth a try!

One grand pizza cone plus one mint shake was 342 on the pocket punch
Reasonably priced a good go to snack !

A new joint just next to keventers in wood street. Konetto introduces the cone style pizza. They have divided the portion size into 2 categorization which is eco and grand. I opted for the eco version of everything i ordered. I ordered for a cheese and chicken barbeque varient along with chocolate mint shake. The cone pizza was very different from the conventional pizza and it sure does need a liitle more effort to eat due to its shape but it tasted fantastic. The shake was also amazing . They dont use icecream or added sugar which keeps the calorie qoutient into check. Gulab jamun cheese cake which was the last item i ordered . It was just the right way to conclude a satisfactory meal. 
To sum it up. Lovely food offerings ,courteous staffs ,pocket friendly and a decent ambience.
Would recommend all gourmands to give it a try.

Located in wood street (opposite to pantaloons back gate). A new concept and tastes amazing. Prices are light on pocket and they've a decent seating arrangement too. Ordered for mix berry shake which tasted average but pizzas were definitely best of its kind. Ordered 5 toppings pizza and farmhouse and they were bang on. Staffs are polite and service is pretty decent too. Must visit for pizza lovers.
