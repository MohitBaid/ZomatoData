Birthdays or any other celebrations in our family is incomplete without a cake from Ume's Kitchen - definitely one of the best home bakers in town.

The very interesting caption “flame grilled chicken” by Barcelos and my love for grilled chicken items inspired me to review the recently launched restaurant at Acropolis Mall, Kolkata. Though I didn’t have much knowledge about Portuguese cuisine but can say Portuguese food is known for being lusty and robust as the cuisine is easy to prepare, and uses very basic ingredients. I was excited when got an invitation for a lunch and to represent Kolkata Food Blogger along with my co-bloggers Debjani , Indrani and Indrajit at . I must mention that after New Delhi ‘Barcelos’ opened their second outlet in Kolkata at Acropolis Mall (4th floor) Kasba.    

    This restaurant is a unique experience which you can’t miss to get the recreated taste of authentic Portuguese cuisine and of course they also pride themselves in the use of their different signature Peri Peri sauces (which they imports from ‘South Africa’.) You can choose your own level of spices for sure because each table is appeared with four different tests of ‘Peri-Peri sauces’ – Tangy Lemon, Mild Peri, Very Peri and Supa Peri.
                                ...

They have delivered a very nice chocolate cake as per my order. It was fresh and soft. Decoration was classy and it tasted yummy. Will definitely repeat.
