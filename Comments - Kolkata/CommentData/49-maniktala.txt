I ordered food from this restra so can't comment on the ambience or decor and service. The food was good and packed with flavour. The biryani was decent but could do with a little more flavour. Will definitely order again from here.

Well 49..... pretty nice place to hangout....garibaranda of north calcutta turned into a cafe.. ambience is perfect with the some recent improvements...service is bit slow.and I personally didntt like the staff s much.Though the food is good, the beverages are not upto the mark.Sizzlers are something I loved trying.. I would recommend their dragon chicken to everyone.Overall I  would say its much better than the outlet at city center hangout

Today Evening I visited this place with my friends. This place is located near YCMA ,at the Maniktala main road. It's pretty easy to locate. An old building turned into this pretty little restaurant. We thought of enjoying the food on the roof top but the cold got us to seat inside . The indoor sitting area is really pretty,comfy , not too big yet comfortable. We ordered Crispy Chicken, Veg Friedrice and Chicken Manchurian. Crispy Chicken was yum with chicken Shreds Fried in a red sauce made out of garlic, onion etc, veg Friedrice was pretty basic yet the quantity was really good and the Manchurian was also good . There's no tax and also the service is very good. I will definitely recommend this place for a casual eat out with your friends or family without burning a hole in your pocket.

Its a beautiful place to eat at..nice decor, great ambience and what adds to its beauty is its rooftop arrangement. Enough good is the food for its pocket friendly cost. You will get enough time to absorb the serenity of the place as the service is not very prompt.

I really like their ambience! Specially the concept of their rooftop. It's small though but at evening its super lit. Sit down for a silent conversation with your partner and your friends after a heavy day at work
The place is really peaceful and the Bus stop is really close to it. Ease of Connectivity!

The dim festive lights and the chandelier makes it a superb and peaceful atmosphere. *face palm*

Okay! Now I sat down, Let get into their menu:

1. Momos: Traveling from Pune, I missed my little dumplings a lot. And I had to order them at any cost. They were soft and the chicken filling had only CHICKEN, CHICKEN and CHICKEN all in minced state! They are lit af! The chutney was perfectly spiced with a touch of strong chilli sense.
Soft, Tender and Delicious!

2. Dragon Chicken Choupsey: This is a very spicy dish, the tag "Dragon" itself gives it a spicy tag. The chicken pieces were really soft ad the gravy was smooth with lots of flavor. Served with Crispy noodles with a Poached egg on the top. Brilliant!

3. Chicken Sizzler: The chicken sizzler platter was super lit. Filled with a pleasantly flavored noodles with lots of finely cut veggies in it. Served with fried potato wedges with well flavored cut capsicum and cut onions in a traditional Chinese style with a boiled egg. And as it sizzles its way to the table, the aroma of it fills your mouth with saliva.

This place turned out to b a real find ,though the entrance was a bit tricky to locate for first timers here. We find the outdoor seating area to be quite full even at 6 in the evening, & the wooden chairs were a bit uncomfortable but the ambience was completely worth it. We tried barbecue sizzlers & found the lamb a but chewy but the fish was great in texture, the quantity of the noodles & vegetables was great. But 1 thing i was dissatisfied with was the boiled @egg they provided .. i personally prefer poached eggs with sizzlers. Due to the unavailability of other mocktails we tried a mojito & it found it ordinary .1 suggestion I wud like to make is 4 them to provide glasses ...just a water bottle is provided on the table. I would surely revisit for the rooftop ambience with the fairy lights & chinese lanters.

This restaurant is near manicktala in North Kolkata. It's on the second floor of an old heritage building which once was well know for its legendary political history. This restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. I personally like sitting outside in the balcony .
Food- *paneer kulcha - soft kulcha stuffed with generous filling of Paneer.
*Chicken Korma - The gravy was seasoned perfectly along with soft tender chicken.
* Mutton Biriyani- served with a tender meaty mutton piece along with egg . Biriyani is really yummy and must try.
Service and pocket pinch- The service is really quick and this restaurant offers great quality food. The bill is really reasonable and the quantity they serve is really greatly. This restaurant didn't charge tax the last time I visited it which was really great. Recently they have gst affiliated and will charge standard tax for its food items. Do visit this place.

Nice decor & beautiful ambience with rooftop sitting facility. Prices are very much competitive as well. The food was also quite decent. But the service needs improvements, it was very average and doesn't go with the nice decor & arrangements which they provide. Having said that, the overall experience was good and will visit again for sure.

Located very close to YMCA Hostel in Manicktala.
Nearest metro station: Girish Park ( 8 min walk)
The best thing about this place was the rooftop seating with beautiful seats. Visited this place around 3 and there was no sun, perfect for a date.
1.Ordered 2 mini cappuccino twice. The cappuccino was pretty good.
2. Ordered Roasted Chicken Sizzler. Can be improved. But it tasted good and the quantity was very less.
Altogether a very good experience.
Their service is pretty good and the staffs are very polite.
The roadside view isn't disappointing. Old Calcutta charm works.

This outlet right beside where I live, on Vivekanda Road is an absolute saviour.

They've come a long way with the decor, and both the interiors and the balcony seating arrangements are spacious, comfortable and well thought out. What will catch your attention is how much they've packed into an average space, and made it pretty.
Situated on the 1st floor of a dated North Kolkata building, it has its charms!
The balcony space has a pretty canopy over every table and service is satisfactorily quick and accurate.

Coming to the food , I've had the privilege of trying nearly everything on the menu.
The Chinese is an absolute winner. Quantity for the price charged, is in abundance.
The dry chicken dishes are spicy and generously served.
The momo is stellar! It is aptly juicy with sumptuous filling, the sauce has a sweet and spicy twist to it.

The Indian menu is a winner. Kebabs are well prepared and melts in your mouth.
Nun sizes are good and the curry dishes impressive.
Very. They could improve on the biriyani, the chicken pieces, although meaty, could get softer.
The sizzlers satiate the quantity requirements and are tasty but aren't their biggest boon.
Staff is courteous and an all round experience is guaranteed with this place. Do drop in with your gang of friends for a good time, there's a table for everyone!

2. chicken hot and sour soup... it was also good
3. chelo kabab... it could be better... price was it's ok...as it's the national dish of iran, there are some points to be noted...plz serve egg 'poach' instead of boiled egg...and any two kind of kababs... and much butter on the rice... it'll be the actual dish...whatever the kababs tasted good except the white one... maybe it was sammi kabab (not sure)... it was tooo sweet... like "bangalis ses paater misti" 😝
4. chicken pan fried momo... it tasted really occurred... do not like it😣
but it's really a pocket friendly restaurant with beautiful decorations ... must visit at least one time😀

From ambience to food all was amazing...

First I would like to say they all are very well behaved and helpful,which I like the most..

Ambience, nothing to say.. total makeover..

Coming to the menu, I tried BBQ sizzler,chelo kebab,mutton biriyani,kabab platter..

I tried BBQ sizzler for 3 times over there, cause it is too mouthwatering.. Just have no words to explain the taste.. Tooo good.

Coming to chelo kabab, it was good.. But need to improve..

Coming to kabab platter, it was delicious..

Definitely I would love to visit this place again and again..

Food was nice but it does not end with the food. The attitude of the staff representing @49 was horrible. They ended up making an explicit statement "people are waiting" as continuous ordering leading to a pretty hefty bill is your currency to longer table time. Based on the discussion with the manager, i must conclude that their motto is to maximize profit by controlling table occupancy times rather than customer satisfaction.

An okay place to have lunch with your friends when you are on a tight budget. 

The restaurant has both rooftop/balcony area, as well as AC sitting area. While the inside decor is decent, the outside open part is quite beautiful. 

We ordered #DiceFriedChicken #RoastedChickenSizzler and #BarbequeLambSizzler. The dishes were okayish. 

So basically, if you are looking for a place to have a variety of food at a low price, this can be your place of love.

P.S: They don't charge GST :)

It is located in Maniktalla crossing, it has both indoor and outdoor sittings.It is in the 2nd floor. I visited it with my collegemates for a lunch.! 
We had a gala time sitting in the indoor A.C . 
Outdoor area is even good decorated by plants, greenary. But due to heat we avoided it. 
Coming to food we had Dice fried Chicken, Lamb sizzler, Roasted chicken sizzler. 
Ambience was good, soothing and clean.
Staffs were good, polite.
Foods were delivered little late than we had expected. 
Sizzlers were good , specially the roasted chicken tasted delicious. But the diced fried chicken was disappointing. 
Rates are also reasonable and affordable. 
Though good experience , will go someday again.

This is located just opposite to vivekananda bus stop and it's my first time in a restaurant at north Calcutta 😅. The restaurant has two parts that is one with a rooftop cafe type area and the other is of dimlit ambience. We sat inside and it was cozy. Service is good. We ordered chicken noodles,egg-chicken fried rice,chilli chicken, chicken manchurian,sweet and sour chicken and cold drinks. Food tasted really good except sweet and sour chicken. It was a bowl of soup with small pieces of chicken and wasn't upto the mark. Noodles were tasty and the chicken pieces were tender and well cooked. Quantity was more than enough and this place is pocket friendly as well

This is located just opposite to vivekananda bus stop and it's my first time in a restaurant at north Calcutta 😅. The restaurant has two parts that is one with a rooftop cafe type area and the other is of dimlit ambience. We sat inside and it was cozy. Service is good. We ordered chicken noodles,egg-chicken fried rice,chilli chicken, chicken manchurian,sweet and sour chicken and cold drinks. Food tasted really good except sweet and sour chicken. It was a bowl of soup with small pieces of chicken and wasn't upto the mark. Noodles were tasty and the chicken pieces were tender and well cooked. Quantity was more than enough and this place is pocket friendly as well

A beautiful place to eat at.... Very very cheap food with wonderful ambience... Soothing instrumental music is on the playlist... Nice decor with minimal  lighting... You can even sit under the rooftop (yes, another a star feature of this restaurant).
Sizzlers at too yummy... Didn't try out many items but hope all are tasty! 
The price given in the menu will definitely provide you a big smile on your face.
A must visit restuarant...

Well,it's a nice pocket friendly place. 
Good for students.
The only thing which will attract here is the ambience.. There's a beautiful sitting area in the balcony..They've made good use of that space. 
You also do have an option of sitting in the air conditioned room inside but we preferred sitting in the balcony. So the ambience here gets 10 out of 5. 😂😂

Food quality is a little more than average.. We order Chilli Baby Corn,Basil Pepper Chicken,Masala Kulchas and Kadhai Chicken.
Basil Pepper Chicken gets 4.5 out of 5.
Chilli Baby Corn gets 4 out of 5. 
Kadhai Chicken gets 3.
Masala Kulchas get 4. 

The only thing they need to fix is their staff.
They should be a bit more responsive. That's it.

Another pocket friendly restaurant, located opposite of ymca hostel bus stop near Vivekanand road.  An age old building yet the interior and decor makes the ambience beautiful. They also have balcony seating area too.Coming to the food, we ordered chicken fried rice and basil pepper chicken, rice was good in quantity and quality, and the side dish was too good. Overall a very good experience, will surely visit again.

Yesterday, I visited this place. I feel amazing. This was my first time. It's very near to my house. Though I choosed rooftop for sitting. They have a lovely decor. Those wooden tables, leaf interior, dim lighting during evening times gives this place 10/10. Ambience is too good. Coming back to food.. we ordered tandoori roti, shahi paneer (it tastes sooo yumm.. fully mouth watering) egg fried rice, veg American chopsey & cola float. All tastes good. Their quantity do justify according to price. Price is reasonable for everything. And last but not the least about the staff.. they are well friendly, well mannered, polite & their service is too fast. I'll love to visit this place again in a pleasant weather specially rooftop.

By happy chance found this one. Thumbs up to Zomato for this. Little restaurant with a mixed bag (Chinese,North Indian,Continental :-) ).
We went there couple of months ago on a rainy day for a tidbit. Ambience is enticing. We ordered Sandwich, Basil pepper chicken & Dragon chicken. Each of them were scrumptious.

Conclusion: Deserves a visit. Students friendly due to the pricing which is comparatively low.

The newly renovated @49 looks stunning from before look . They have made good use of little space and the ambiance is good . Specially the open space one that's high light of that place , it's like a terrace garden .
Back to food .. We have ordered manchow soup which was very nice , babycorn it has ordinary taste , lastly we have ordered Hakka veg chow and chilly paneer . Together they are adding the taste , which was nice . It's affordable and nice place . Worth to be there !!

I went to this place a year ago and treading back my path, I searched for this restro in Zomato and found the decor transformed quite a bit for the better, and that's saying something since the ambiance it provided with open balcony and bistro-lite setting was appealing already to anyone, especially college students. Thus I'm reviewing this place keeping in mind that I'll be visiting the place again soon. 

We ordered Crispy Chilli Baby-Corn, Crisp Chicken, Fried Chicken Momo, Mixed Chicken Noodles and Chilli Chicken. The food was decent for the most part with the standout being the baby corn dish to me, even being staunchly against ordering veg dishes while eating out. We had to order for a vegetarian in our group and much to his smirking triumph we contributed by munching on the baby corn with greater satisfaction than anything else. He had to order a second plate of the dish to satiate his own hunger. The rest of the dishes were sub-par and could have fetched a lower rating if not for the amazing setting to the hangout. 

This place is a bliss for the pocket and thus most appealing to the students! The service was a bit slow and they couldn't deliver some of the first choices we had but all in all, it ended as quite a memorable experience, enough to reminisce even more than a year later and write such a lengthy review.

If u are low on money or u aren't willing to dig a hole deep in Ur pocket and also at the same time you are carving for well cooked food in a peaceful rooftop ambience then trust me without even thinking twice head to this place straight away. The ambience is fabulous. Location is great it's quite easy to locate this place. Food is extremely pocket friendly and really well cooked. 
I ordered chilli garlic egg chicken noodle, chilli garlic egg chicken fried rice and chicken Manchurian. Taste was quite good. Only one disappointment the chicken Manchurian pieces were too small and a plate contains only six. Being priced at 160 rs it's costlier as compared to the other dishes on menu.

The coolest thing about this place is probably the way a new age restaurant has been built within an almost British-era building. The interior is well decorated, with the special attraction being the balcony seating area. It's sad that the rains ruined our plans of being out there, looking over the main Vivekanand Road. It was my best friend's "budget treat", and we tried:

1. Basil Pepper Chicken - 4.5⭐️
[The show stealer for the evening, a must try at this place]

2. Crispy Chili Baby Corn - 3.5⭐️
[Plenty, but a little bland once the outer crust is separated. A little more time on the oven might have done the trick]

3. Mixed Fried Rice - 3.5⭐️
[Good quantity, but the shrimps needed some more time on the fire, a faint hint of the raw smell]

4. Schezwan Chicken (gravy) - 3.5⭐️
[Nothing too special about it, went well with the mixed fried rice]

A 4⭐️ for the place. Apart from the mildly more-than-average food, the low prices, the ambient music and the quirky decor helps this place make a mark. An option to be considered for budget eating options.

The restaurant is in the 2nd floor. Outside sitting is perfect for evening. They also have indoor sitting arrangements though. The ambience is good, well decorated. The foods are really pocket friendly. Nd also good in taste. The quantity & quality according to price range is worthy & all the price wriiten in menu card is including tax. Overall its a worthy place to visit.

Well this restaurant is a gem in the city. They serve chinese and indian food. It is present on the 1st floor of the building, has a balcony and an ac room sitting arrangement. We were five persons, although the ac room was small,it was cozy. If u love the hustle bustle of the street then the balcony sitting is perfect. We had ordered chicken lollipop and golden fried prawns in starters...the prawns were medium in size and lollipops were very tasty. For the main course we ordered mixed noddles, mixed fried rice, hunan chicken and szechuan chicken...all the dishes had good balance of flavours nd seasoning. The amount of noodles nd rice is more than enough for one person. Next comes the service, it was prompt and had to wait around 8-10 mins for the foods to arrive. The rates are reasonable. Highly reccommend to everyone.

The multicuisine restaurant with its innovative name is situated at the Vivekananda Road. The interior of this restaurant is wonderfully decorated. There is a rooftop for the customers to enjoy the food right under the sky. I found the service quite satisfactory and look forward to be better in future.The prices are quite reasonable. We had ordered egg chowmein accompanied by sweet and sour chicken , out of which the sweet and sour chicken was not very impressive but chowmein was good enough. And then we ordered mutton keema pulao which seemed to taste more like biryani, but on the whole it was good.The best part of this place is that all tge food items are devoid of tax which is really enticing for the customers.

This multicuisine joint is located at vivekananda road just opposite to the ymca hostel. I found this place is very nice to hangout especially if you are going in the evening the rooftop dining is the perfect place.
Ambience is nice although the service is not that up to.
What we ordered : Basil pepper chicken , Hariyali kebab , Mutton keema pulao , Chicken korma , Butter naan , Kashmiri naan , Chicken tikka masala , Mixed fried rice & Hunan chicken.
I'll suggest try the Basil pepper chicken at least once , you'll not be disappointed. All the other dishes were good and tasty. Pulao was a gem.
A lil bit quicker service will be expected next time

who knew such a great place exists in north kolkata.. the most I liked is the ambience.. it was mind boggling.. though we chose to sit on rooftop which is probably under renovation..
the taste of 'basil pepper chicken' was mouth watering.. fried rice and noodles was good too.. though the taste of 'chicken manchurian' disappointed me a bit..
overall suggested for a must visit.. you can avail a great 'food-time' even in the end of the month..

The restaurant is near vivekanand road. All food items are tax free. We tried #Basis pepper chicken. It was just aweeeesomeeee. Tried #dice fried chicken also but it looks like chicken pakora and they make it too spicy... #Sweet and sour chicken tastes like a soup. Overall very good lighting and dinning. There is a rooftop if you want to enjoy food under the sky.

It's a nice place for spending your evening..
As this place have a open terrace..
But it's situated on the road side soo lots off honking of the vehicle may disturb your good time..
Food is good and very reasonable..
Staff is friendly..
The dine in place is very nicely decorated..
But the open terrace need a lot of work..

Then you ask about North Kolkata or Old Kolkata, Chop, singara, kobiraji all these comes in our mind! Now @49 came with a bang and changed all the traditional thought about Old Kolkata. The restaurant situated at the second floor near the Vivekananda Road Crossing and Opposite of YMCA. During my School days, we used to come here for so called 'Chai Adda' but after renovation, the restaurant reached to a different hights. Now lets come and explore this place.

Positive Point -
1. Outside Sitting & Ambiance - There are few restaurant there in North Kolkata, that offers you such facility! Indoor dining facility is also available here! Outdoor dining place is well decorated and music in background add some beautiful mood during dining with your friends or love ones.

2. Student friendly Pricing - Price tag of each item is very decent. So will not burn a hole in your pocket.

3. Food - One of the best in itz area. Quantity wise it is also good.

4. Management and Stuffs - All the stuffs are too helpful, polite and courteous. This is something, that you don't expect from a such low budget restaurant!

Negative Point -
1. Timing - They take much time to serve your food.
It is the only negative point I got here.

Food I tried -
1. Crispy Chilly babycorn - Chilly babycorn is my all time fav starter item and the way they make it, I become fan of it. babycorn was small in size but well tossed in sauces. Unlike other places, it is not too tangy. Just less salty in nature. Add some salt and pepper and you are good to go.

2. Chicken Roasted Sizzler - This is one of the hot favourite item here and mine all time favourite item. 4 pieces roasted chicken served with noodles, french fries and egg. Taste wise it is not like traditional sizzler but decoration wise, it is! Hahahaha. Tastes good and quantity wise it is sufficient to fill your empty tummy.

3. Veg Fried Rice - Well steamed rice cooked with veggies comes in a plate. Lite and mid spicy in nature, quantity wise it is good for one person only. Any kinda side dish goes well with it.

4. Chilly Chicken - 6 pieces of big sized chicken come in a bowl with thick gravy of Capcicum, onion and chilly. Chicken pieces were soft and very well cooked. Overall tastes good as a side dish.

With all the food mentioned above, it cost around 550 INR. They don't add any kinda Tax or Service charges during Outdoor dining, which is really good. Pocket friendly pricing, good quality food and open air dining is the main UPS here. Food was not so excellent, but ambiance, price tag plays its major role here. Overall a good dining experience.

One of the best restaurants of north kolkata. A highly decorated food station with amazing dishes. It also has a balcony overlooking the busy vivekananda road which is the best part of the restaurant. Tried dry chilli fish, mutton keema polau, mutton kasa handi and chicken kabab korma. The dry chili chicken and mutton keema polau is highly recommended. Would like to visit again soon.

@49 attracts mainly for their outdoor seating but it was severe hot outside, so we opted for the indoor seating. The restaurant was crowded and it took 45 mins to get in. Ambience is nice and the decor is simple over there. Coming to the food we orederd Starters platter which consisted three pieces of three difderent starter which tasted good. For the main couese we had Chicken Fried Rice, Schezuan Chicken, Dragon Chicken Choupsuey and Lamb Sizzler. The Rice and chicken was very average and the choupsuey did not have that proper taste and chicken was hard to find. It was only the sizzler which was pretty good. Staffs are friendly and price is reasonable.

i so very hate this place that I can't tell! The first visit to this place was like they include everything in menu but when in terms of serving they deny that its not there. I went to eat North Indian with my friend they said that there's No chef today. Few months later, that is 2nd week of may, i visited again for the same cause... They took the order, after 10minutes a waiter comes and says it will take 10minutes for the same to be served. Fair enough! But what the hell after 10minutes, a lady manager or cashier or billing girl whatsoever she is comes and says it will take 30-60minutes for fulfilling your order. Means i have never seen such a horrible place . Even the small restaurant succeed to stick on their words. Why do you guys keep your ads or offers on little or other apps when u dont have the capability to serve. I hate this place.

The cafe is in three sections of which the best according to me is the balcony, overlooking the busy Vivekananda Road crossing! Please don't try the Sizzlers as it was awful in taste.

The Rooftop will give you the vibe of nostalgia! ❤

Food is too average, but the Rooftop, the wind and feel of being nostalgic. 😍

It's just 15minutes walk from Girish park metro station. It's better if you take an auto :)

Once I bookmarked this place after checking it in Zomato. I bookmarked it as I liked the Ambience in the pictures here. And when I was returning home and I was near to this restaurant. I suddenly though to go there.

I ordered Bar-B-Q Lamb Sizzler and hot chocolate coffee!
The coffee was more than the "worst" and the Sizzler was nothing special to remember.

Go there to try the Ambience! :)

The entire ambience and the quality as well as the quantity took me by surprise! It turned out to be a great funfilled place especially with the rooftop area which is great place to chill with friends over a cup of coffee. I really had a nice time there with my family and wish to visit it again very soon!  Just one suggestion- please play some GOOD music!

Good food, good quantity and cheap prices. No added taxes too and the service is quite fast as well. So to sum it all up, it's one of the best places for students to visit in that area. Happy Eating!

First 2 visits were quite pleasant,  but visiting this place 2-3 months after the previous time,  made us realise how much it has deteriorated since then. The food was served cold. Kebabs were stale and chewy, and not even as told in the menu. Unavailability of most items in the menu was another drawback. Never going back to this place.

@49 as the name suggests it mislead us into thinking that the all the dishes will cost just a meagre 49 rs but its not the resturant opened roughly around 2 years a go initially the pocket pinch were far too low and the food was as tasty as it can be they had all the items available to select from the menu but as itvis norm in life the moment it starts getting recognition it expanded and expectedly increased the prices of the dishes but the quality went down considerably but it is still a cool nice place to hang with friends if ur hungry and dont have much money left in ur wallet u can give it a try u wont be disappointed.....

I think this place is apt for casual dining as the food tastes okay and they are priced quite reasonably. But on a personal note, I wasn't much satisfied with this cafe-cum-restaurant. The staff members were a bit confused and the service was slow. The roasted chicken sizzler was not just up to the mark and the Manchow soup was decent. 

Probably, their Indian cuisine works better.

Visit this place for a cup of coffee and beautiful  outdoor ambience. We ordered  Indian but it was unavailable, then we went for chinese food. The food is average. The sauce  kept on the table is disastrously smelling  and tasted like shit. It must have  expired, please  replace it.  
People should  visit for ambience  and to spend time silently. Don't  order food to ruin your  experience.

It has been quite sometime that I had bookmarked this place. Though I couldn't physically be present out there but home delivery service really flattered me.

First of all, the food is actually good with expected quality and quantity. Secondly, they don't charge any kind of vat at all. Could I ask for anything else?

It was a Friday so I had to go with the veg items. I opted for Veg Noodles, Chilli Paneer and Veg Manchurian. It all lived upto my expectations and I am visiting this place in person soon. Moreover, this is a cheap dirt place which is an add on!

Do check out! :)

I've visited here once and I liked this place so much.It was located at  Vivekananda road on the 1st floor of a building... One can locate it easily..me and my friend went for lunch here...we've tried chicken biriyani and chicken gravy noodles.. It was noon time but the weather was pleasant so we choose outdoor sitting.. The restaurant is small but nice ambience... No doubt on hygiene. It's very pocket friendly and they don't charge anything  extra on outdoor sitting like vat..we enjoyed the mild breeze and the staffs were very nice...service was quite good and no compromise on taste in such price...I loved the gravy noodles and I think biriyani could be a little better... We also took cold drinks and what I liked it was they offer nice combos both veg and non veg.

@49 is really a Hidden Gems in Central Kolkata! It is situated on Vivekananda Road near Maniktala Crossing!
The ambience and the decor is simple & good, refreshing rooftop place, perfect for the afternoon gossips and Addas.
And coming to the food part, it has nice combos. I have ordered Veg fried rice and Chili Chicken. Rice quality and quantity is both good and tasty. Also the chili chicken was very tasty, but the chicken pieces in the gravy are very small.
The price of the food items are also affordable an pocket friendly.
Service is also very good, staffs are very responsive & their service was great, all were wearing @49 tees.
Overall a good place with value for money.

The hidden gem which is the best according to me..
I have in here 3-4 times..mostly on Tuesday nights..for just quick dinner..
The most attractive thing is their outside rooftop seating arrangement..I have been absolutely in love with this concept.
And coming to their food
I tried many things.
The first time I tried their chellow kebab.
Then we tried out their reshmi kebab,chowmein and chilli chicken..
The third time we tried barbeque lamb sizzler and we were blown away by the taste.
Absolute yummy and tasted heaven.
I love this place and would like to visit it again and again.

The place is only good because of the ambience. Service is poor and the food is average. We ordered kadai chicken but the chicken pieces were tiny. The tandoori rotis were not soft. If you're planning to spend time with friends and your budget is low, then you can go for these place.

This place is very much pocket as well as pallet friendly.It is partially open air restaurant where you can spend quality time with your besties.Covered portion has AC alongside.
We ordered hot and sour soup,Veg sweet corn soup, dry chilly mushroom,fish sizzler,veg Hakka chow.All the dishes were adequately spicy and when it comes about quality, they do not make any kind of compromise with it.
You can pay here by card also.Bills do not contain any kind of VAT or service charge.
Last but not the least, here you can indulge in smoking in the open air restaurant. Already went twice and eagerly waiting for more visits.

First of all the ambience - its really nice...roof top place...nostalgic. 
Well connected through girish park metro, bidhan sarani, maniktala.
We ordered capachino, flavoured tea, French fries, chicken hariyali kebab, roasted chicken sizzler, mutton biriyani, chicken biriyani, egg fried rice, mixed fried rice, kadai chicken, murg makhani, mutton kolapuri, chilli fish and fresh lime soda. Items are really tasty and delicious specially sizzler :-D
I was shocked to see the bill.....seriously it is pocket friendly! And they don't charge any vat or service tax.
Truly it is a hidden gems restaurant in north Kolkata. I love the place and recommend other....

Recently visited this place, first of all guys go n visit this place to experience the authentic feeling of a rooftop eatery ... Wow ... Impressed with its ambience . Yet the service by manpower provided was not of good quality, could be more attentive n working.
Now, lets talk about the food, out of excitement me along with my 3 other frnds ordered hell lots of dishes..😜
The steamed chicken momo was literally tasty, perfecto..... 👌. Chicken roasted sizzler is worth its expectations, it had that Smokey flavour to it with all the bar b q veggies. Kebab platter was not dat great with 4 variety 2 from each sections, a big nahh from my end 👎 . Garlic chicken noodle, was ok not dat great because it had too much of garlic flavour which was overpowering the real taste of all the other components. Chicken makani , wow man it was tasty with tender smoked chicken n awesome gravy 😍😍😍. The butter nun was a regular one n cheese nun was a joke ... That's because even if the gods come n hunt for the cheese, he/she would fail to do so .. 😂😂 #nooffencemended.

So, my verdict is, one should definitely visit this place once,
A. For the ambience
B. For the price (really reasonable)
C. Chinese n north indian is Better Den then the kebab section.
Nice start-up, if greater quality of food n labour is mentained then it would be one of the good place.

Re-visited this place again ... N tried some new stuff ... Like cappuccino, chicken Hakka n the very delicious chicken momo ... 😇 
Cappuccino was awesome 😍 Chicken momo were delicious (small in size but 6 pieces were there with jam packed filling 😍😍) n Den the Hakka chowmin .. hmmm it was ok not something I wll crave for ... 😇 Keep goin @49  ... 😇😘

Really a hidden gems in Central Kolkata!
Situated on Vivekananda Road near Maniktala Crossing!
Rooftop Outdoor seating is absolutely mesmerising!
One of the best places I have ever had Chinese.

We were two and we ordered One Starter Combo and One Bar-B-Q Lamb Sizzler! Both of these items were delicious and totally Pocket Friendly, the most valuable thing of this restro is they donot charge extra taxes though the decor at outdoor seating not so good, but food was tasty, delicious and quantity was very good!

I specially loved the Starter Combo of 3! A 'Must Visit' Restro!

I visited this place twice, it being very close to my college. It is located few step away from the Vivekananda road. 
The first time we ordered chicken lollipop and fresh lime soda. The lollipop was good but the drink was awful.
I visited this place for the second time with a big group of 10 people. We decided to have our lunch there, a decision which I regret. 
The ambience and the decor was good. There is also rooftop sitting arrangement. 
Now coming to the food... We ordered mixed rice and noodles, schezwan chicken, garlic chicken and sweet and sour chicken. The rice and the noodle was average. The pieces of chicken was too small. We even couldn't find the sixth piece of chicken in an item. We regret coming here for lunch. 
The quantity of rice and noodles in one plate was enough for only one person. And the quality needs to improve a lot. PLEASE DO NOT FOOL PEOPLE.

This place truly deserves to be called as the Hidden Gem 💎 ... I wonder how I never noticed this place before reading the review on zomato as it pretty close to my house.🤔
The decor is simple yet refreshing perfect for  the afternoon addas .. the rooftop area is cool and cozy. 
The food is pretty good in terms of flavour and quality But they  do have a problem of Seasoning.. 
The price of the food items are affordable 
The only thing they have to work on is the service part...

Shame on me. How the hell I missed this beautiful place, that's even in my locality. Beautiful rooftop sitting photos & good rating on Zomato forces me to visit this place.

Location : Located near to Vivekananda Road crossing its few steps towards Maniktala. Its very easy to locate because of its huge hoding. But its not easy to locate the gate. Ignore the old building main gate beside United Bank & just take the lane beside & enter into the building gate. Its on 1st floor.

Decorations : Just after entering into the restaurant you have the option to choose outdoor or indoor sitings. Indoor is very nicely decorated & outdoor is much more than that. Spreaded sitting over in the balcony side with warm white old school lights & small plants on side makes the ambience beautiful.

Staffs & Management : Staffs were wearing @49 tees. They were very responsive & their service was great. They took little time to serve order but their presentation of each & every dish was always upto the expectations with beautiful garnishing.

Foods : We ordered the same that most of the people ordered over here that is reviwed on Zomato. Below are the treats...

Crispy Chilli Baby Corn : Chilli Baby Corn was shaped in small ball sizes & served full of a plate. Red spicy & crispy balls were very well cooked & well mixed. Sauce mixed with it was very well balanced & unlike other places it wasn't over tangy. Just it tasted less salty. Sprinkle a bit of salt & pepper on it & you're good to go. 

Roasted Chicken Sizzler : This is one of the most famous item over here, that almost everybody orders. Noodles with 4 pieces of Rosted chicken with rich sauce served in the traditional way of sizzlers. French fries & fried egg top of it made it much more delicious. Taste wise I was expecting too much but then I realised the price & for that it was quite good. Quantity was pretty okey for single person.

Veg Fried Rice : It was very well made , not very oily, mild spices & very less small diced vegetables felt good. Quantity was below average but quality wise it was almost perfect. It tasted very good & because of it's lite taste any side dish will play good with this.

Chilli Chicken Gravy : Served in a bowl, there was 6 pieces of chicken in it with thick gravy of capsicum onion & chilli. Chicken pieces were soft & nicely cooked. Just like every other dish over here it was little less salted. Spices were mixed well that made it tasted good.

Pricing : Each & every dish over here is very simply priced keeping in affordability in mind. Our total bill for all the mentioned items were Rs. 560 in total. No added Vat & Service Tax for outdoor sittings.

Conclusion : This is one of the best value for money place to date your special one & probably one of the cheapest rooftop open air dining too. I wouldn't say their food is excellent but their ambience, food & overall presentation for the price does enough faith.

This place is truly amazing. Sort of a hidden jem i would say. Never knew of this place until one fine day, i came across it's name on Zomato.
It's located exactly opposite to the YMCA Hostel.
It's very easy to locate. Just 5-7 mins walk from Girish Park Metro Station(Gate No.2). Vivekananda road.
This place is basically a typical old North Calcutta Building turned into a restaurant. It has a root-top area plus a neatly decorated air-conditioned interior. Looks very premium.
The quality of the food is good enough (considering the price). Price of the food items is veryyy reasonable. And the BEST part of it is that Tax is not applicable on the price. This is a huge plus point.
I went there today for the first time and trust me, it's quite impressive and i would like to visit this place again. ^_^
We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Naan (and coke). I'm attaching pictures of these items along with this review.

This place is situated just on the opposite pavement of YMCA building, Vivekananda road
An old building spacious balcony turned into a restaurant.They have both indoor sitting and balcony sitting arrangement.
Their ambience is best enjoyed in the evening on the outside sitting.Nicely arranged chairs and small tables.
The food is  quite good here but not the best.
I visited the place after reading some good reviews about the place.
I ordered chicken chowmein, oriental chicken sizzler,hunan chicken and chicken fried rice.
The hunan chicken was lip smacking,
Sizzler was quite tasty but could have been better.
The quantity of chicken chowmein and quality of it was good.
Chicken oriental sizzler contained fried rice, chicken chowmein and a chicken gravy mixed and served on cabbage leaves on a hot plate.I like the way they represent the food.
I felt some taste of ajina moto seasoning that I would suggest the management to avoid.
Overall I liked the food.
Service speed is average and staffs are okay but not so much attending.You need to serve yourself once they have served the food.
Will visit later to check out some other items.

I visited this restaurant today afternoon. 18th December.I ordered chicken chowmein and hunan chicken .the food was great but what I felt worst about the restaurant is their staff's behavior. I gave them a charger and my phone switching it off for charging. When I was leaving I took the phone back and noticed that it was switched on and my WhatsApp,messenger, and gallery was open.I asked the person whom I gave the phone for charging sitting at the reception counter. He strongly denied that he opened the phone but it was evident that he did this.Later he accepted that he did open the apps just for checking how the phone model is.I never expected such behavior from a restaurant staff where people go for dining and if you trust them for charging your phone,they sneak peek into your personal files.such a disgrace on the restaurant authority. Would never visit again.

In night it looks beautiful it is very much pocket friendly. I think main target is students but whatever your age is you can visit n enjoy the nostalgia of north. Food quality is good waiters are cooperative n what you want more go yourself n experience it once.

After one home delivery and one evening there with my friend the place has blown my mind. They have tried their best to make a small quality restaurant in the busy north Kolkata. The balcony is surly the charm despite of the pollution and noises of the busy Maniktala area. As for the foods, they are surprisingly delicious. l, though found delivery of my sizzlers little slow but that may be due to the complexity of the dish as other items were served on time.

Heard a lot about this place, so planned to give it a try! The restaurant was easy to locate but there was no place for car parking.
We had to park far away :(
 
The interior was a very comfortable one and the service was fast too!
We ordered,
Cream of chicken soup, Fried fish, Reshmi Kabab, Chicken drumsticks, Roasted chicken sizzler, Cold coffees..
The food was quite tasty but one thing I didn't like was that the tables were so closely placed that there was no privacy.
Overall had a good experience!
Will be visiting again :-)

I saw so many pictures of my friends in facebook when they visited this place and the thing which mainly attracted me is the ambiance. Visited this place 2 days ago for the first time specially for their ambiance as there is a sitting arrangement in balcony as well as an air conditioned sitting arrangement but I preffered the one under the sky and I really liked the ambiancee. It's really a good and pocket friendly joint in north kolkata with good food and there is no VAT, which is another reason of visiting this place again apart from the ambiance. According to me the service is not that good as the waiters are idle so one shouldn't visit this place when he/she is in hurry, but except this I couldn't find anything about this place which they should work on.
Their food quality and quantity both are quite good at low cost. We ordered roasted chicken sizzler and that was pretty good. And I'm surely going to visit this place again with friends.

I had visited this place during the Durga Puja. It was a random decision to walk in here as we were very hungry. The indoor seating was filled so we had the option of outdoor seating and it's a total win. The old house charm adds more to the ambience. The food quality is above average and prices are unexpectedly reasonable. The crispy baby corn was a bit undercooked but all these other dishes were well prepared. Looking forward to drop in soon to enjoy the lamb dishes.

Quality and quantity both are best..for two people price will be less than 1000...i tested variety off dishes..i.e crispy lamb, basil paper chicken, chilly prawn, chilly baby corn, chicken Manchurian and rotis...all are very good..but i specifically liked basil paper chicken.. very nice ambience and staff are very helpful.

Ah well i will doubt this place as a hidden gem..but yes this place is super pocket friendly..
As the quality of many restaurants tend to fluctuate during durga pujas..well this place did struggle to cater to the crowd which rushed inside on a saptami afternoon..the waiters were lacking communication and as things went hayware..they took ages to serve the food we ordered..
The chicken drumstick we ordered was above average...crispy but the taste was not well above the mark..i would have appreciated if it had a tad bit tangyness and a bit more spices..
Ah well the chicken chowmein was an absolute disaster..the garlic chicken was bland enough to taste like soup..the food disappointed me..the bill did not..
They have a roof top seating but we preferred to stay inside..
3.5 only for happy pockets..
Oh well..i would add something here..i loved my second and third visit..the rooftop is amazing..
We loved their crispy chicken this time ..crisp and hot loved it..crispy fried lamb is also a delicacy i loved here..
The american chopseuy is my absolute fav from this place..the tangy gravy with sunny side up is absolutely delicious..the dragon chopseuy is good as well..the garlic chicken is good as well..
They make good coffee as well..

Locating the restaurant is the main challenge here, decent food, not a restaurant for foodies rather a destination for addabaz frnds, the view is excellent from the balcony(its not rooftop its actually a balcony), old calcutta with great ambience, stuffs are very slow and idle, the exhaust pipe's outlet is towards balcony, please change thAt guys ASAP. Just go there enjoy the environment and adda @that's it.

Located on the second floor of the road leading upto manicktala, dont know why its called 49. Has an open air seating area and an ac indoors, ambiance is good, specially outdoor in winters. Ordered a lamb dish which wasnot available.
Settled for a chicken sizzler which had complimentary noodles with it. Ordered momo s too.
Was not great to taste, was average. Service requires more prepping.
Cost is a lil on a higher side given the taste.

@49 I heard so much about this place from friends and family that I had to give it a visit. So I went there on 8th of September 2016. To my amusement the place was quite nicely decor and the rating is based on decor and pricing of food only. Let's come to food we ordered mix fried rice and chilli chicken for main course and fried fish for starters. The quantity of fried rice was quite less and taste was not upto the mark.
Chilli chicken was tasteless. Fried fish looked good but the batter of fish was more salty than it should have been. It's still a good place for people who want to eat decent food at nice rate. The key to success for this restaurant is its pricing.

This place is a bit tough to locate. But once you visit it, you will surely love it. 

Great service, pocket friendly prices and good variety of food, which actually tastes good. Add to that a great ambiance. The inner seating is small but comfortable. And the open air balcony seating is excellent. 

Among food we loved the sizzlers here (the mall style ones with noodles). The kebabs were flavourful and soft. Crispy chilli babycorn was crispy, but not too hard. The sauce in which it was tossed was good too.

Only negative here are the beverages. Hot coffee and chocolates are machine made. And the Masala Soda tastes weird. The Fresh Lime Sodas are made with lime squash. Better to stick to aerated drinks.

My first visit yesterday. The service sucks to the core. 49 mins to get a coffee 1:30 for taking orders which were all served on the wrong table. Cold breads and wrongly served foods. First we were served rice then sizzlers followed by sabzi and finally breads and that was after two hours wait. And finally the plate and spoon. 
Can't say much about food because all were served cold including the sizzler .... Normally if we weren't hungry as hell we would have returned it but hunger forced us to eat. 
The best part when we asked the girl in billing counter for the basin she replied "waha hoga shayad"
Seriously my worst experience of service in town.

P.S. I really don't know how they food tastes when served properly (I.e. if they do so).

There is always room for improvement but overall no complaints. Ambiance, price and variety of dishes available is excellent.I think a bit of investment in better chefs can really make a big difference. And they need to include some desserts in their menu.
It was a really fabulous experience,if you wanna hang out with your college friends or wanna spend some quality times with your special one this is the place.

This is a fantastic little joint located opposite to the YMCA on Vivekananda Road. The restaurant is on the first floor of a residential building and the entrance can be tricky to find although the restaurant has a big signboard hanging from the balcony. The entrance is in the lane next to the building and it has a marble bearing the name of the house next to the door. Up the stairs of a traditional house typical of the area and when you enter the swing door, the place is transformed to a hip little joint. There is an indoor area which is air conditioned. There is also a seating arrangement outside on the wide balcony in the open air. We chose to sit outside and it was lovely. We had the chicken lollipops and the roasted chicken sizzler. The lollipops were hot and sweet- very delicious, but a little spicy. The sizzler was just big enough for one person. It had six pieces of chicken, cooked with some vegetables and served with french fries and a bowl of noodles. It was an unusual sizzler, but it was good to taste. The sauce in which the item was cooked was somewhat like barbecue sauce and very tasty. The fresh lime soda was also very well done. The place is extremely pocket friendly and great as a hangout for college students.

Visited with two of my friends last Tuesday. We were in for a surprise when the interior turned out to be far more clean than the exterior. The weather was too humid, unfortunately, for us to sit out on the balcony.

Coming to the food, it struck me as a bit odd that they don't really offer a lot of Chinese main courses. So our options were limited.
We ordered cold coffee, fresh lime soda, chilli chicken, chilli mushroom and chilli prawn (all dry) for starters. Sounds redundant, I know. They were good but they tasted the same too. 
We went on to order roasted chicken sizzler, mixed fried rice and chilli prawn (gravy) again. All of them satisfactory. 
After all this I was pleased to find that it didn't burn a hole in my pocket. So quite perfect for a college kid like me. 
Looking forward to coming back in winter and sitting on the balcony next time.

This place is cheap... very cheap. And you will know the reason when you put the food in your mouth. Don't let the pictures fool you. The quality of the food is below average.
You have to really search for the entrance. Did not notice at first as there is only one signboard in the side on the railing of the terrace (1st floor level). And the entrance is not on the main road. It is on a side street which looks very much like the entrance to a private house. No signboard on the entrance even.The three of us ordered the Dry Mushroom Chilly (Pic 1), Half Tandoori Chicken (in Pics 2 and 4), Hariyali Kebab (in Pics 3 and 4), Butter and plain naans (in Pic 4) and Cello Kebab (Pic 5).
The Mushroom chilly was saltless. With salt, I think it can come close to being an average preparation. The mushrooms were crispy at some places, but soft in the rest, altogether not giving a very good feeling in the mouth.
The restaurant has some serious issues with its tandoor, because nothing that came out of it was good.
The naan had a peculiar taste, and it was not good at all. And it was not as soft as naans normally are.
Same with the tandoori chicken, peculiar taste, seemed little undercooked. Not like anything I have had or will ever like to have.The Hariyali Kebab. They misheard it (coming to this later) and made it a dry kebab and after telling managed to put some gravy in it. Neither pieces of chicken, nor the gravy had any decent taste. It was blandish, with that peculiar taste of all the things that originated from the tandoor.
According to my friend who ordered and had to eat the cello kebab, the kebabs looked different, but had the same taste. And from the little bit that I have tasted, it was... yes, guessed it right... that peculiar bad taste of the tandoor.
The service was not very good. Did not give us much heed at first. And after ordering,they misheard Hariyali Chicken (a side dish with gravy) as Hariyali Kebab (a dry starter dish) and after complaining, managed to put some gravy in it (not that it could increase the quality of the food. Made it worse, maybe.)
All in all, a very disappointing experience. The place is cheap, but when the food is bad, the low prices doesn't matter. There are many other places which serve good quality food around this price. Opt for them.

TL;DR: Cheap place. But very bad quality food. Not recommended at all. Opt for other places..

A joint with inhouse and outhouse seating(rooftop), moderate price of each and every item with good taste. I liked the ambience inside. Wanted to sit in rooftop but couldn't due to heavy rain. I was amazed to see chicken biriyani at Rs.79 and and and the taste was perfect!! Definately going to visit this place again :)
Food we ordered was Reshmi Kabab, Fried Fish, bar b q sizzler and chicken biriyani.
Everything was good about the items except the chicken which could have been more softer.
Suggestion = Pls expand your inhouse seating rest all is fine.
05.06.2017 second visit to this place. 
Adding some pictures of the outdoor seating and food we ordered. their biriyani, (few people might not agree with me), lightest biriyani i ever had. Not too oily not, light aroma, and perfectly cooked mutton. That too, just at Rps. 120.@
Ordered : Crisp Chicken and Chicken Drum Stick. Mutton Biriyani. 
Very Much Pocket Friendly and Well Behaved Staff. 
Service time isn't that long depending upon the rush. They took just 8-10 mins to serve post ordering.

The  Chamber of Secrets, the true hidden gem! well , the Ambience is absolutely okay, it has 2 seating areas one inside with air condition and one outside providing a rooftop view !! now coming to the menu it is reasonably priced, the first thing which caught my eyes!! we ordered a crispy chicken, dry Chilli fish, grill chicken sizzler, mixed chowmein, mixed fried rice, chilli chicken !! the food was absolutely value for money I am definitely gonna visit this place over and over again !!!

I think I spent close to entire 5 minutes searching for the entrance. Located opposite the YMCA, The Cafe 49 is a marvelous, little joint that puts the price question into perspective. The most alluring element of their existence seems to be the rooftop seating. It's hardly worth mentioning that the rooftop isn't the best idea during noontime. Thankfully, the good people at @49 took to their senses and installed an air conditioner for their indoor seating area.

The service is very average. They're courteous and friendly, but they're not very well versed with their menu. Sometimes a little too insisting on certain items from their locker. Nevertheless, the staff is not a problem.

The food is very average. As someone who's taken it upon himself to find food joints across this city which serve up the best food at the lowest prices, it has become somewhat of a habit to expect decent food from inexpensive restaurants. However, this isn't the case at the 49 cafe. Their food is very ordinary. Their so called Thai food had no semblance of Thai cuisine, and the basil infused chicken was very standard. They fry their foodstuff too much, which means that most of their non vegetarian food is mainly deep fried chicken. They had no lamb when we visited. Their drinks were alright -- the cold coffee with ice cream was pretty decent; the Lime Soda was borderline blasphemous -- far too sweet. I am yet to try out the bigger items on the menu, but here's hoping that their sizzlers and north Indian can deliver.

The place was pretty decent though, well polished interiors and a nice rooftop seating for dusk and nightfall. I do believe they could've done something about the uncomfortable nature of the tables and chair placed outside.

Ambience/Interior: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Food: 2/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Went to this Cafe Today... Situated near Vivekananda Road Crossing.. This is a Multi-Cuisine Restaurant serving both Cafeteria and Heavy Food.. We Ordered Masala Black Tea, Lemon Tea, French Fries and Chicken with Basil Pepper.. The Interior has two divisions.. One is a Small AC Room with interiors defining Simplicity... The other one is the Non-AC which is quite interestingly situated over an open balcony where people mostly prefer to sit.. Ambience was okay but could have much better if it was more spacious and innovative.. Staffs were okay.. The food was served quite fast and was preferably good.. The Chicken was very soft but a bit more saucy.. But the French Fries was the best.. Interestingly I would like to visit this Cafe for more such items and specially that Balcony Sitting Arrangement.. Good Experience.. Hoping to visit again

I ordered food through online ordering from @49. Trust me the food I ate was the worst food I have ever eaten in Kolkata. Food colouring was so obvious that I could see red colour shining on the paneer tikka. Chicken was smelling when I took the first bite and it felt as if I was chewing on a twig. Kadai paneer had no taste whatsoever with no salt, no spices, felt as if I was eating paneer with cream.  Never order food from here. Worst experience ever.

The location of the place is a bit shabby..interior is not that satisfying but outdoor terrace seating is quite good..the service is satisfying.. They have really good kebabs at a cheap price which makes me want to visit here more..we had ordered hariyali kababs,noodles,basil chicken and cold coffee..noodles was a disappointment but the chicken dishes were quite good and cold coffee tasted really good..a good place to eat at a very reasonable price..do recommend this place.

Really a beautiful dine out area. No problem to find out. It's on the 1st floor,entry is by the side of house.
Small space inside, outside seating arrangement is available,which gives a view of busy roads,old houses over the street.
We ordered roasted sizzler,bar b que lamb sizzler, mutton biriyani,fresh lime sofa. Prices are strikingly very low, even with vat+service tax.
Quantity was good, really good, quality of biriyani as well as sizzler was real good. 
It's a very good discover to have lunch at pocket friendly prices.
Next time I'd surely try Chinese dishes.
Definitely recommend. :)

Extremely good Chinese food at quite cheap rates..extremely ideal for regular get togethers..though delivery is little time consuming,but the food quality is worth every effort.i ordered for mixed fried rice,mixed noodles,chilli fish and chicken manchurian,each were upto the mark and the quantity for each plate of fried rice or noodles can suffice for 2 average appetites.keep it ul @49!

Well to begin with the name @49 sounds a bit interesting one and hence it directly took my attention. I accompanied with my wife visited this wonderful hangout one fine evening when we were taking a stroll nearby. This place is perfectly blend with old English style with a modern approach of casual dining serving multi cuisine food. The USP of this place is the roof top concept that's give a perfect ambience at evening. Another important aspect is the pricing of the foods which is very pocket friendly. We found our taste buds tingling for the ordered foods and I must say they were tasty and well garnished. Last but not the least people were really friendly and ready to serve good foods. Cheers to the team, keep up the good work !

Spotted the place few days ago hence thought of paying a visit. The biggest pro is the ambience of the place, though I would advice a better space management. But I couldn't explore the open air section, blame it on the sun!
Well the staffs are well behaved and service is decent. 
The menu offers a wide variety of food which is very easy on pocket, but they should work on arrangement of the items, and their names. 
We had tried alot of food-
Chicken satay: lovely it was, tender chicken, grilled to optimum level, veggies were fresh. But the chicken was under marinated.
BBQ lamb sizzler: I was amazed by the price of it. It comes with a portion of noodles, with lamb chunks and veggies, French fries and a boiled egg. But this was NOT upto the mark. The noodle was oriental in taste which simply doesn't go, the lamb was rear cooked, it was more of a steak than BBQ, not grilled, no BBQ sauce at all, I don't know WHY have they given such a name.
Hariyali kebab: this was a Real GOODNESS, amazing smell, amazing flavors. But I would advice a bit less artificial color will do well. 
We also has sweet lime soda which was OK, but lacked lime. 
.
My verdict: a good place with wide range of food at amazing prices but with scope of a lot of IMPROVEMENTS! And at the end of the way kudos to the owner for opening such a place in North Kolkata. Good luck 😄😄

We discovered this place while looking for a cafe after a disastrous meal at a nearby dhaba. I remembered there was a place nearby with an open balcony seating and thought of giving it a try. It took us few minutes to search and locate this place on Vivekananda Road. This place is opposite the Vivekananda Road YMCA and a minute walk from the Vivekananda Road – Bidhan Sarani crossing. The entrance is on the lane after the building if you are coming from Bidhan Sarani. It is an old building and the restaurant is on the first floor.
                                                                ...

Opposite to the YMCA building this is one of the best foodhubs of this region. Not much people know about this place (infact I, being a foodie and belonging to this neighborhood got to know about this place after a random surfing on zomato).
INTERIORS: Although the entrance is a bit peculiar but, once you get into the cafe it's beautiful. The indoor A.C seating is small yet elegant. The outdoor seating on the corridor is amazing and wonderfully decorated.
FOOD: I found them absolutely delicious from the starters to the beverages to the main courses. Staffs are courteous. Prices are very pocketfriendly, which is the most important highlight of this place. My personal faves are the kebabs, crispy chicken, chilli chicken, drumsticks, cold coffees and the mocktails.
OVERALL: A great place to hang out. Cool, breezy days make the experience even better. Highly recommended to all.

Situated at the Vivekananda road overlooking the YMCA on a protruding balcony of a typical north Kolkata home. It is very close to my home and one afternoon while we were strolling around the area we came across this joint.
They have both outdoor and indoor sitting arrangements. The outdoor rooftop area is very prettily decorated. But since it was a summer afternoon we could not afford to sit under the blazing sun and chose the air conditioned area instead. 
Had two plates of hot steamed chicken momo and a fresh lime soda. The momos satisfied my hunger perfectly. Got one veg haka noodles parcelled. Though the quantity was less it tasted quite good. 
 Looking forward for a second visit.

OH! The roof top! I really enjoyed that,. The ambience was really nice. Coming to the food, we order chicken seekh kebabs, veg rice dry chilli chicken, gravy chilli chicken & crispy chicken. Believe me guys, the crispy chicken is something which can make u frgt everything else out there.. its was so juicy & so soft & so tasty, i just can't expln! The gravy one was not so good, the rice was nicely cooked & the kebabs are a bit on the not so good side but not too bad to reject.
& for smokers like me, plz take a full packet wid you, u can surely finish one wid ur group ;)

Loved this rooftop cafe. Polite staff, pocket friendly and delicious food. I had dropped by with a friend for some evening snacks , so we ordered fried momo, veg pakora , pudina paneer tikka and fresh lime soda. I liked each one of them except the lime soda. It was bitter. Nonetheless I will definitely have a full course meal here soon.
           The entrance is quite tricky to locate but the experience is undoubtedly worth it.

Its a nice place to hang out with your friends. The place is small but nice, specially it has an open air roof-top extension, which is apt to spend a summer evening with friends. They cater good and yummy food in unbelievably low price. Behaviour of staffs is also cordial. You may face difficulties to locate the place but it is an ideal place to give treats to your friends.

This place gives you exactly the same feel....add on to that its a pocket friendly with a very old calcutta concept of having food in a heritage building open air hanging roof. Tried out the biryani which is super in taste nd the price got my eyes poping out....will try out more items in my next visit.
This belongs to pocket friendly category for sure...must try is my suggestion!!!

Location: Just opposite YMCA bus Stand on Vivekananda Road

Ambience and decor: the ambience is very nice here especially if ur gng wid ur grup of buddies or even with the special person in ur life, decor is minimal but all thats dere is carefully done and neatly maintained, I would give a special mention to the square chairs and table which look slick. The roof top option stands out coz thats on the verandah of an old building, an old north Kolkata building

Food and Menu: You have from mughlai to chinese to Indian and the quality quantity and presentation are all between good to very good but the cold coffee is a big disappointment, the chicken fries and the cilly prawns are good and go well with the crispy chilli babycorn

Service and staff: courteous and prompt staff and reasonable service time

Overall verdict: Good

Located in Vivekananda Road, in a old building. The entrance is a bit confusing (they must make it more convenient to locate) 

As soon as we entered, could find 3-4 tables. So you can imagine how little the space of this cafe is. We took our seats near the TV. (Match Fever is on ! :P )
It has rooftop arrangement also.

Had ordered Crispy Chilli Baby corn, Chilli Prawns and Cold Coffee. And later added, Fanta. :D

Crispy Chilli Baby corn was good but can be made better. Chilly Prawns were amazing. However, Cold Coffee was bad. I mean, real bad ! Probably the worst I ever had. So it needs to be improved. 

Staffs are courteous and efficient. The service is really commendable. The ambience and decor is good, as well. 

Overall, a nice joint with more ups and less downs. So you may visit this place. :)

Cosy quaint little place, tucked away in a very unnoticeable part of Vivekananda Road. A good place to sit back and relax with food that is affordable and tasty. Doesn't have much of an ambience,especially during summers,when the balcony sitting area should be avoided for obvious reasons. Overall a pocket friendly hangout spot that surprisingly serves good food.

Discovered this place while looking for a cafe around Hedua area. On the first floor of an old house, they have small inner seating with 3 tables and a larger outer seating. Inner seating have AC while the outer seating is on an open balcony, so airy enough. Loved the outer seating. It was too hot or else would have preferred outer seating.

The people here are fast and friendly. The cold beverages however were not great. The Masala cold drink was strictly ok while the fresh lime soda was made with lemon squash. The hot chocolate (machine made) was ok.

The best item was the prawn barbeque sizzler. There were six big pieces of prawns with vegetables, french fries and hakka noodles. The noodles was good, the prawns tasted great and the sauce was yummy. Loved it completely. And at 189 rupees it was pocket friendly too. 

Will be visiting this place more after the summer ends to enjoy the balcony seating.

Irrespective of how the food is, what the ambience is like, one is bound to like this place, only and only for it's popular roof-top seating.The place is nothing much to boast about, situated around the crossing of Vivekananda Road, one is allowed to miss it, what with it being a house turned into a cafe.But what it lacks in arrangements, it more than makes up for in the roof-top seating which is immensely popular with the people here, as it is one of the very few in the entire North Kolkata area to have an open air arrangement, also providing good food at such dirt-cheap rates.
Coming to the food, it's nothing to talk home about.We had tried their Fresh Lime Soda, Chicken Drumstick, Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Basil Pepper Chicken.Of the lot, the basil pepper chicken turned out to be my favorite pick for the evening.The lime soda deserves a special mention too, for being such thirst-quenching and refreshing.Overall, the food was decent enough and very much affordable.The staff were friendly and the ambience was great.All in all, a pretty nice place to spend your summer evenings at.

One of cheap n best restaurant in Kolkata. I love old Kolkata and @49 is perfect giving the old Kolkata feel with good food quality. The interior of the restaurant is average but the price of food is really cheap its total pocket saving deal . 
We order Cappuccino (@25 not even 49 😜) can be a regular good deal, chilly mushroom is awesome I loved the dry and hot flavor in, with good crisped mushrooms. Golden fried prawn is average but not a bad deal. Chicken tanduri was good in that price with good mixtures of spices. Lassi was just like home made lassi , with perfect blend of yogurt n sweet.
Overall I would say its super pocket saving hangout deal in Maniktala. @

First floor of the building, both indoor room and its adjacent balcony are given make over of a trendy food station.

Food is cheap but average - however their veg fried rice and noodles are not greasy like at other places -also their mixed veg is also tasty and not oily or very spicy - their chilly mushrooms are a disaster and the nan - quite terrible ! But overall this small place has room for improvement - healthy food should be thier target - that is not a priority with most restsurants in north Kolkata -more so since it attracts a young crowd

situated on the 1st floor of the building..@49 has amazinggg AMBIENCE..
@49 HAS BOTH INDOOR and outdoor seating..i reccomend the outdoor seating..its cool and " mast" to eat and char under the sky for a change 
perfect for both romantic meal or A hangout with Ur pals..
PRICES  are very reasonable and at par with QUANTITY..
as a matter of fact..prices are comparatively cheap for an outdoor cafe located in the heart of Calcutta ..@49 serves Indian Chinese and sizzler's and beverages..
BUT BUT BUT ,,,,,,,,
the FOOD is very very ordinary,,,
ordered 1> coffee which was o.k
2>haka chowmein was plain in taste 
3>crispy chilli baybycorn tasted blant  and was not just good enough

all the food items lacked proper seasoning and spice blend,,
FOOD NEEDS A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT

overall a good experience because of the ambience and good s and very prompt service..
but as stated earlier food needs a lot of improvement

This place is a budget one, we happened to drop in here, this place is no mabecne place, not even decent, just a plain monotone. not much of a food menu and the seating is not comfortable. It is very affordable and definitely a save for lot of people, who doesn't wish to spare much cash. 

For me its a no visit again, but for a lot people just to suffice stomach in very affordable prices, can be a good spot.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: Generally i have seen Uninor shops converted into Airtel Shops. But what  a migration to this resto. Previously known as Adda.com before and now came with a new name and attire. Went to this place at my Birthday and found it closed that made me annoyed but still kept patience and reached here with my cousins again to take a close taste of this place. Just near the Vivekanand crossing on the second building at 1st floor going towards maniktalla on the right side. Gained Huge popularity now with a new affordable rates and looks.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF: Ambiance is not a big. Three tables in the inside which is small but the balcony seating is really a enjoyable experience with your family and friends. With open air and dim lights looks like a romantic place. Basically a cafe than a resto with small sittings. Staff is attentive and polite.

FOOD: 5 people one table and we had lot of things in mind just as a snacks basis with huge expectations. We straight away went for starters which were Chicken Hariyali Kebab, Chicekn Lollipop and Chicken Steam Momo. Followed by some main course for a taste which were Egg Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice and Gravy Chilli Chicken.

Chicken Hariyali Kebab was just not the Hariyali kebab i know. It seemed that normal  fried chickens were painted or been dipped into a Dhaniya flavor and palced on the plate. Contained 6 Pieces in a plate.

Chicken Lollipop was good. Pieces were average but far better than Hariyali kebab. thou the layer of Besan was more than the chicken inside but still was satisfactory. Contained 8 pieces in a plate. really surprised at this price.

Chicken Steam Momo was good. Small in sizes with 6 pieces in plate decorated well. Taste was nice and filled with good amount of chicken.

Egg Noodles were fine but ordinary. Taste was a bit poor to me. The look of the noodles was appealing but not the taste.

Chicken Fried rice was on the other hand was also too average. Taste was absent, Flavors were missing. Small pieces of chicken and eggs included. 

Chilly Chicken was good. It looked and tasted just like Chilly chicken. gravy was tasty and thick. It also contained 6 pieces provided in two small bowls with three pieces each. 

CHK: 5/10
CLP: 7/10
CSM: 7.5/10
EN: 7/10
CFR: 6/10
CC: 8/10

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of the food was good. But the quantity is a matter here. thou they are charging very less amount of money for the dishes but quantity should be taken into account. Noodle and Rice were not enough for two people. Prices are very very affordable. At this time food with these prices are hard to get anywhere.

CONCLUSION: With some good attire and affordable prices this place is grabbing people's attention everyday. Not a bad place actually. Hope to Improve with the time they keep serving people.  Will look for more next time.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Ve just stepped out of d food joint n instantly feeling sorry for them who has worst experience here. Personally my experience is super duper yummmmiiii... Ambience is great for any type of "adda", even romancing. N food ka toh kya kehna!!! I would rate it 8 on 10. We took hot n sour chicken soup n crispy chicken at starter n both were tasty, followed by butter nun, mixed fried rice, Manchurian chicken n chilli chicken. u cn nvr evr imagine to taste so smooth n solid 6 chicken pieces @ only rs 89!!! in these days!!! i was amazed to see their price tag. i didn't try indian,but it must be equally good as chinese. lastly i took hot coffee n my friends fresh lime soda. our bill was li'l over rs 450 for 3 n really it cant b imaginable where we generally get a CCD coffee @ 150 rs. its a must visit place n surely try chicken items....too too good.

A newly opened joint. A very beatiful place, u need to walk through the stairs of a proper old north calcutta house. They have a open air sitting arrangment, from where u get a wonderful view of NORTH CALCUTTA, it has a very nostalgic atmosphere. A very good place to hang out with friends. We had coffees, charging 30 bucks per cup, and crispy chilli baby corn and a chicken preparation. This place is just opposite to      Y.M.C.A, Or 2 mins walking from chachas hotel. Nearest metro station is girish park.

After going though the Menu & various reviews below I'm fascinated to go but with my stiff limitation of mobility I wonder I possibly can't have their food. Though they're on Home Delivery via Zomato Delivery, will these people Deliver the food to my Res. at TOLLYGUNGE , ( gachhtolla, on N S C Bose Road) Kol- 40. ( Near Netaji Nagar ). If so the value of order may go to nearlyRs. 300.+, but I love Indian food tandoor, Kababs, Gravy too. Veg or n- Veg both are my fav. 
              Hi, @49 , will you agree? If little extra for Delivery ! acceptable. I'm a restaurant hopper but not those aristocrat Big names , they're rogues. They charge huge money but serve very little food & mostly bland, not done properly. So pls. Agree with me. I accept that food if delivered , may not be Hot or may be warm only. Agreed. Only food has to be tasty as reviewed by the Diners.

Hmmm....!! So, a Sunday afternoon. Doesnt wanted to cook at home but needed a home made food... Where 2 go... Well... If you are residing at north Kolkata... You got to drop at @49..
Though the entry was pathetic...but interiors were fine inside  the resto. With a open roof top cafe, good place to go.
Food was tasty... Chinese, Indian... Tandoor... all were awesome. Service was spot on. A really home made taste. Just felt like eating at home...
Must be there. Great place for College goers.
No pain in ur pockets as it is unbelievably available at low cost...

Mind u.... Never Judge a Book by its Cover.
Thus, ignore the exteriors...

A happy, friendly, cozy place - primarily catering to college kids. Its actually the improvised open terrace of a north Kolkata house...sure adds an old world charm to the entire experience...though the steep staircase is a total dampener!
Food is simple, homely, well-presented and does not burn a hole in your pocket. Service is prompt. A good place to spend a lingering, lazy evening while watching the city as it passes you by...

It is such a comfy cafe styled restaurant. They have a blacony were one can seat and eat but it was full so we were seated inside.
We wanted to order so many things but since today was muharam and they were short staffed so we only could have chicken manchow soup. They cost 69 rupess a bowl. The quantity was less but the taste was really really good.  A restaurant in north calcutta with  good food and nice ambience.  Keep up the good work.

There are very less options when it comes to home delivery system in North kolkata. Delivery was on time. Ordered kebab platter and mutton kassa with laccha parathas. Really sumptuous and lip smacking kebabs. Chicken was soft  and juicy. Mutton was boneless with a very homely taste to it. Laccha parathas was not very oily as they serve in some mughlai restos. Will definitely recommend it to everyone. Next time will order some Chinese food from them and won't forget to upload photos.

A wonderful rooftop cafe, at the heart of North Kolkata, atop a garibaranda. There's variety in the menu. The staffs are courteous. A small A.C section is also there to escape the summer heat. We had Bar-B-Q sizzler, that was served with noodles and were rather satisfied with both the quality and the quantity. A dessert section in the menu card would be a welcome addition.

For those sorry souls who were familiar with the high priced menu, bad maintenance and indifferent service of 'Adda' and have finally given up on the joint despite the promise of the 1st floor open space, a couple steps from Vivekananda road crossing, I urge you to visit again..the new restaurant is pocket friendly, with an acceptable sense of decoration, wide range of nice food, great service and most importantly, well-mannered waiters...finally a great place for a great space!

Newly opened pocket friendly cafe where you can gossip in the fresh air or in air conditioned room. Sitting arrangements are very good, frames are hanging on the wall highlighted with spot lights & decorated lamp sheds are hanging.
We had ordered Chicken Steam Momo which tasted yummy and Fresh Lime Soda was okay. We took away Veg Noodles quantity wise not much but tasted good. The service is very quick, fresh and good. The staffs are friendly.

A beautiful place it is. This cafe is located on a protruding balcony of an old house, as often seen in the streets of North Kolkata, overlooking Y.M.C.A Vivekananda road bus stop. It has also a tiny a.c section, for ones preferring to avoid the sultry weather outside. However, we chose the open seating area , as it was a pleasant afternoon. I must say it has a great photogenic ambience. The attendant with a smiling countenance informed us that only chinese dishes were available then, while Indian dishes could be ordered 8p.m onwards. We chose chicken fried rice, crispy chicken, hot and tangy wings and chicken drumstick, followed by sweet lime soda and soft drinks. Loved the food. All the starter items were equally finger licking. However the fried rice tasted pale compared to the other three. Prices are reasonable, but I think the service tax which they charged was excessive. Well, overall it was a nice experience, and I can gladly give it a 4 on 5.

the place serves best chinese i ever had. The staff is friendly and polite . Equiped with a nice garden cafe with a view of kolkata streets makes it an ideal get away for couples and foreigners, who wish to experience indian hospitality . For anyone  who chooses to dine there i would recommend the thai crunchy chicken and the fried bhetki as the starters as they are my personal favourites, the other diahes are also exceptionally good. The mughlai section us also well stocked and equally tasty. The price is quite reasonable for the quality food and portions you get. I would definitely  recommend it to everyone.
