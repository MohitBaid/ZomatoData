I've ordered from here a number of times and the delivery is always on time and very smooth.The burgers are really good,but could do with a little more mayonnaise. The chicken wings and french fries are alright.

One of the my favorite places to order food. Their Chicken Pops, Angry Burgy and Chickni Wings are the best. Keep up the good work. Very friendly and well mannered delivery people. Looking forward to see more items in the future.

We ordered chicken wings and trust me,  they were delicious! Going to try all of the stuffs from Chickni! The food was delivered all hot and way before the time limit. Loved it... But it's just that I couldn't avail that 20% off for defense personnel.

I was amazed to see such pathetic quality of food supplied by Chikni last Sunday. Order was placed over Zomato. I generally place orders over  their website. Ordered 3x chikni box. 
Received half cooked chicken pieces. The meat was raw. We threw away the pieces in garbage. And if this is what a chicken patty of burger.. God help you.

You have failed so quickly. It's amazing. I am never ordering from Chikni again.

Located near barrackpore station. This is basically a kiosk that serves you tacos, burgers, chicken wings etc. Tried chicken spicy taco which was nice. They dont provide seating arrangements. This is a delivery based restaurant. No recommendations.

If you are looking for a place which is pocket friendly and also provides quality food, the place is perfect. I ordered a chicken bucket and two chicken burgies. Both were awesome.. can not complain about the delivery as well.. overall great experience..I hope they can keep the quality of food and service intact.

Good quality of food and the price is really cheap. they give free home delivery service. But they should have online payment system for website booking.
