I didnt get a chance to visit the restaurant for I had opt for home delivery. The food was lip smackingly delicious. I had ordered the tandoori mushroom which was so properly made in tandoor. Mushroom lovers must try this dish out here. The quantity is also very good. Other foods were also above average. And the packing was so properly done. Great. Must visit.

It's worth in all respects, I had tried Chinese, continental, North Indian. Price r most reasonable. 
Pasta, Noodles  and rice shezwan with Manchurian and hot garlic souse very tasty. Indian starter Aloo Labbabdar, paneer tikka and main course Dal makhani, paneer tikka Labbabdar too good. Burger and pizza also good. I am having food from Jelly Belly 2/3 a week.

It's a tiny place serving a variety of cuisines, but vegetarian only. Food was poor in taste. Very cheap and street food quality. I even found hair in my noodles.

Not worth at all. Ordered hakka noodles and steamed momos . Cant explain the taste. Many Street vendors can better hakka noodle. Momos were ok.  Won't recommend to any one.

Honestly speaking, this one failed to impress not only me but my family members as well. No such decor to boast of. The food was pretty ordinary. Prices are okay, but compared to the food you get, I'd say its not justified. The space for accomodation is pretty small.

This new cafe is located inside the active acres residential complex. The place is small and can accommodate a max of 16-20 only.
The menu is nice with Chinese, Italian and north Indian. In my two visits I have tried their veg momo, Paneer chilli, schezwan rice, jalapeño burger, mixed sauce pasta, aloo do pyaaza, butter Paneer, garlic nan n masala kulcha.

The Chinese and continental is better compared to the north Indian.
The service is fast and staff hospitable.
Prices are reasonable and justifiable to the experience overall.
The restaurant can make some changes in the table setting to make it a more enjoyable experience for guests.
