Ordered Paneer Teeka, Navratan Korma and Stuffed Kulcha through Swiggy. Not disappointed. Both the side-dishes were in sufficienct quantities and tasted good. ¬†In navratan korma vegetables could have been cut into cubes instead of lengthwise. Looking forward to tasting their other dishes too.

Good food for home delivery. Their karan paneer is awesome. I'm not fond of their dal makhani and masala kulcha. They can improve on that. Their chana masala is also good and paneer butter masala is also good

Absolutely disgusting service!! If only I could give a -1 rating I would give that. Took my order at 8 p.m and called at 9 p.m saying they cancelled the order because they were closing the restaurant. Is this how you serve your customers? First take their order, make them wait for an hour and then cancel the order. Highly ridiculous!!!!

Ordered through Swiggy so no comments on the ambience or customer service, but I felt that the food I ordered was fine however it was overpriced. I still cannot digest the fact that I spent about 270 bucks for 6 pieces of Stuffed Aloo Parathas including delivery charge. They need to reduce their prices to see the rating go up.

Ordered food from here so not able to comment on the ambience or service in the restaurant. The food that we ordered was good, our order was for panir butter masala, black dal and rotis. The panir butter masala and Dal came in plastic containers and the rotis in foil packaging. The great part was that it was delivered piping hot. The Dal and panir dish both were tasty. This is one of the few places where you can order phulka, which is great because you don't feel like having naan every time,coz it becomes too heavy.
Good place for vegetarian food.

Pretty nice place to order your regular South Indian food. Besides that, they excel in your day-to-day food items too. I have recently ordered their Puri and Bhaji for breakfast. They tasted decent. Enough to get your stomach filled. An economical place for all those affected by the recent demonetizing of money.

Ordered in through swiggy. So, can't comment on decor or staff behaviour. We ordered crispy veg, crispy chilly babycorn, pan fried paneer. The food was very good but super spicy. I didn't give any special instruction because it was my first order from there. I would surely order food from there because they provide tasty, economical vegetarian food but I'll be more careful with the instructions.

A small cozy place near New Alipore triangular park, I have visited this place 4-5 times now.. The place is neat and they dont take long to serve. Being a small outlet with not much to attract with, I have never found it full, but, if you love Chinese food like I do, it's definitely worth a visit. Their Chinese is much much better than what you will get at most other restaurants/outlets across the city. I have tried their Mushroom Salt & Pepper, Veg fried rice, Haka Noodles, Chilli Paneer, Chilli Garlic Noodles, Spicy Ginger & Peas fried rice, etc and each time the food has exceeded my expectations. The quantity is more than sufficient and you would end up wanting more it!  The staff is very courteous, polite and hardworking! High time they got the recognition they deserve.
Keep up the good work team Kesarii! :)

Ordered a thali for home delivery. The bhindi gravy sabzi was pathetic. Either they should give bhindi fry or not give it at all. Due to this, we had to make do with the limited and small quantities of Dal and aloo sabzi. The bhindi was absolutely uneatable.
Rice was really good and well cooked.

Didnt visit the restaurant; so can't comment on the ambience or the staff/service.

Ordered Chole Bhature. At 55 bucks; it is priced really cheap.

The bhature were good. Really nice and soft and tasted good.
The chole was bad. Bad because they had more onion rings in it than Chole. Disappointment. Could have given the onion rings separately and could have just left the chole by itself :/

Mixed feelings about the food.

date of visit 4/4/2016. my dad is a pure vegetarian . he wished to have fried rice. this restaurant is situated in our locality hence 1st time i opted for it. This is a full veggie friendly restaurant with a very good range of varieties. tried their veg manchurian fried rice and corn and pepper fried rice. coming to the food .. veg manchurian rice was a better option than the other. although i loved both of them . the quality of rice was superb with perfect flavours . the corn pepper rice was full of baby corn and also golden corn it also contains 3 types of capsicum . dish was very colourful and very very spicy . quantity was healthy . the manchurian rice was full of chopped veg manchurians its quantity was the same . value for money 4.5/5cost of two is nearly about 350 . so a very good pocket friendly veg serving place . will love too visit again to taste their other dishes specially paneer kofta biryani

Had ordered online schwezan veg fried rice and chilly paneer ... taste was quite good... 2 people can share one plate ... paneer was soft and size of paneer was decent enough. Even the veg fried rice had vegetables in it unlike some restaurants which donot put anything in it. So overall decent place ... would like to try their north indian sometime.

It is sad to see that sometimes a good restaurant gets bad review from people who over expect without seeing the money at which the fares are offered. It is one of a kind veg restaurant with excellent servicing and food even at the busy Puja hours catering to the needs of vegetarian diet. I and some of my friends went to restaurant and ordered paneer roll, pan fried momo and chili corn as starters. All fares were excellent however special attention for paneer roll that made me salivate and anticipate for more. For main course we ordered keshari gobi, Hong Kong paneer and honey paneer. With it we had garlic butter naan and lacha paratha. I however liked the keshari gobi and garlic butter naan best. They were wonderfully relishing. I had an awesome time and can't wait for more.

I had ordered a Special Thali some days back which comprised of Butter Nan, Kali Dal and 3 types of veg and tasted awasome. Today my family wanted to have the same thali again so we ordred 3 Special Thalis. I was really disappointed with what came today. Instead of Butter Nan there was plain Fulka, Yellow Dal which was like water and the vegetable were really spicy and did not have any taste. The papad which came with the roti had become very soft. When we called the resturant the manager or incharge started arguing and were not ready to accept there mistakes. Further they also told us that there menu changes everyday. If this was the case then they should have informed us while ordering. A really bad experience and would not recommend anybody to order from there. There can be up and downs in food but a restaurant should always learn from their mistakes.

We liked the place. We had been looking for decent aloo parathas at a decent price nearby but were getting ripped off either by price or quality.
We stumbled upon Kesarii and let the lady at the desk know what we were looking for. She was kind enough to herself supervise our food being cooked in the kitchen.
The parathas were the best in a long time.

Horrible experience at kesari.. first we entered, the ac was not working at all.. 1 ac was working at 30'c temp..when asked to reduce, the waiter did not responded even telling him twice, he reduced to 29'c only.
Now cuming to food, we ordered momo 1st.. it was good and then we ordered a hakka noodles nd manchurian.. just hving the 1st bite of chowmein we realized it was excessive oily.
We could have only the taste of oil, not chowmein.. just complaining dis to the waiter there, he responded very wiered. Said aapko pehle bolna chaiye tha kam oil mei banane. Do we need to mention dis before ordering?
I was shocked and realised that we were mentioning whether we need spicy or non spicy but now i need to mention less oily also.
On asking about the manager or the owner.. he first replied there is no owner.. and den he said i am the owner.
We were suprised at the attitude of the staffs.. and was amazed how he has been kept as a waiter, Wasnt he taught to treat the customers??
We immediately left the place.
I hope this msg is conveyed to the owner so that necessary steps can be taken.

I visited Kesarii today Ignoring the unavoidable intent of  hurling brickbats , which some of the reviewers , I observed, did , l felt like initiating the review with a few kudos to this restaurant in few essential areas, which goes amiss or we tend to ignore when we enter a restaurant. First and foremost, the hospitality, the lady , possibly the owner, noticing my sweat soaked condition, was kind enough to guide me to a comfortable airy corner , where I'll be truly comfortable, while leaving the restaurant I overheard her taking feed back , suggestion from some other visitors on the preparation. Nice indeed ! It's a small restaurant, yet it has this homely ambience which will make you feel comfortable. I am not an expert on decor ( & I don't intend to be one) my philosophy is prior to good food , you need a comfortable environment. Now about the preparation,here the critique will appear,I ordered for a special veg thali. Contrary to my accolades above, the preparation of dishes calls for significant improvement. The best part of the thali was the plain dal , it was well cooked , tasted well with the rotis ,,which were rolled and baked just as it should be , but the mushroom and the other veg item failed to impress me. Cooking is not about measuring ingredients and following requisite steps to the " T" , it is also asking the most important question" Why  am I  doing this ?" . Those veg dishes explicitly reflects these concerns. Though I should acknowledge the effort that has gone behind the Paneer dish to make it tasty. The pulao was leaking a bit of oil. The price is reasonable , service prompt, still I believe the restaurant has quite a way to go.

They have done nothing so far to even deserve the '1' I gave them. Had been to this eatery a number of times, since their menu alwaz looks appealing on paper but sadly equally disappointing on the taste buds. I went there a few times since an "all veg" option close to my place is nil. But every time I bring something to their notice, they just don't seem to learn or improve I should say. Today is when I reached the break-neck point. Ordered 10 alu parathas, and I swear not a single one tasted better than the others. All BLAND and RUBBERY. Very much undercooked. Their bharwan bhindi is a shit. And most of the dishes tastes similar with practically no modifications to distinguish one from the other. Y don't u guys learn! Coz u have enough middle class non-bong happily gorging on ur tasteless preparations? Upgrade for gods sake. We want food not ur favour. And learn to value customer requests and suggestions. They are paying you. If you know what it means

This is a pure veg restaurant in new Alipore. A small place but easily locatable due to its bright board. 
I had decided to get food delivered at home as it provides delivery service. 

The staff are patient while taking the order but not well versed with the food they offer. They have a variety on the menu but unable to explain what different stuff they are offering which makes it difficult to order something new on the menu. 

Food I ordered:
1. Crispy chilli honey potato- well prepared with strips of potato indeed crispy and the sweet and sour taste is good. The drawback was that u don't get the taste of potato at all as it is so finely chopped . a little thick strips would have completed the dish.

2. Pan fried momos- enough quantity just for one person. The sauce is really spicy and yumm. Reasonable and tasty.

3. Ginger capsicum fried rice- well it seemed they just added ginger to the normal veg fried rice . really disappointed . also the rice was very dry.

4. Veg Manchurian- this was normal tasted good . quantity is small as they are cheaply priced. The gravy was OK too.

5. Paneer in hot garlic sauce- the first thing that crossed my mind looking at the dish.." Were they plating holi" omg.. Too much color added.. It was just plain paneer added to the gravy. The gravy was no where close to hot garlic sauce.

It is a reasonable place. Pocket pinch for 2 is rs.200
However the management should reduce the variety and offer only what they are good at. 
 So that would help them gain popularity.

(Reward with likes and comments ;) )

But the veg biryani they serve is one of the best I have had in a long time, and the excellent dal makhani makes it a perfect combination! One must at least take away food from here once if not sit and have...

Awesome food and ambience.
It was amazing to have 'all vegetarian food' restaurant at Kolkata. ¬†Each food we ordered had different taste. ¬†Especially, when we find most of the restaurants have limited gravies and they cook vegetables in them - making all the menu dishes tasting same.
Superb 'Kesrii'. ¬†Carry on .....

Kesarii - I don't know why another special 'I' added at the back of the Kesari'i'. 
=====================================================================
Intro: 

I had been moving around near Bhatti and steak factory and suddenly i discovered few of the new food restaurants/kiosks opened here. One of them is this. I had made a visit to Kesarii today to try it out as i was feeling little hungry. It is located in the busy street of Saha pur Colony when you head towards tara tala from Triangular Park. This place is a "PURE VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT". So, vegetarians, another option to dine in has opened for you guys. As told by one of their staffs, it is owned by a bengali and when asked why did he choose to go vegan? He said non vegetarian restaurants are everywhere and he wanted to open options for Vegetarian. I was quite impressed by the answer. The staffs were quite knowledgable about the dishes too when i asked them on it. 

The place was small with few paintings hung on the wall,Little Congested seating arrangement but hygiene was properly maintained. They could accommodate one small washroom too though. I was kindly greeted by the staffs to take a seat and they were courteous enough. 

This place serves different cuisines such as Chinese, North Indian and Continental. However, variations of pasta were also served by them. The reason why have deducted few points is that they disappointed me by saying a 'No, We Don't have it' on few dishes and beverages. Why do you add it on the menu when you don't have it? They gave me a silly excuse that they had been opened since 25 days only. 25 days is a big time to get all the items on the menu sir. Quite disappointed with this at least. The prices charged here was inclusive of taxes here. 
=====================================================================
Food ordered: 

I had ordered:- 

1) Veg Steamed Momo: The price of the momo was 40 bucks and it kind of surprised me. It was cheap so i had decided to order. However, i was more surprised when they served me so small counted 4 pieces of momo. Haha, it did gave me a shock. I have seen people serving 6 and den 5 and den 4? Why this to me? God save me. However, when the momo's were served to me, it was not properly steamed and it was 'Kachha' what we call it in Hindi. They took back the 2 momo's after i ate 2 pieces and served me with 2 momo's again with water overflowing around them. It left me shocked. What is this? However, the sauce which was accompanied along was pretty good. Momo - A Thumps Down. 

2) Cream Sauce Pasta: Ahhh, this was nice. The pasta had the appropriate amount of vegetables and was boiled perfectly. Not just that, the sauce was not too thick at all which made me love this dish and which is why they are getting the points. The Cream sauce was the sweet tinge of white sauce pasta and costed me 125 bucks. The pasta was served with oregano on top. 

Overall, my bill came to 165 bucks including taxes and my stomach was happy.
