Tried their "Cheese Masala Dosa". Its no-where close to an authentic south indian dosa, but what it was, it was just awsome, yummy and delicious. One dosa was enough for me at lunch. Super tasty. Packaging was also good. Will try this place again.

For price you get satisfactory food.
Was hopping around so decided to have some south Indian delicacy.
What i ordered:- pyaz ka bada with which you get sambhar coconut chutney and garlic chutney.
And as well as ordered Uttapam which was slightly burnt.
Service is pathetic

Overall a decent place.
If in bangur and hungry do visit here.

We ordered from this place yesterday and although the delivery was delayed due to high demand ,it was worth the wait . We opted for Onion Masala Dosa.

The food was well-packed and as regards the taste, no comments at all .Simply delicious !!!

Very good excellent south Indian food served here but the place is very very crunchy. You have to sit butt by butt. Friendly owners but staff needs serious improvment. They are always finding ways to clear the table. 

Better to order it via swiggy during weekends n holidays

It open at Bangur more than one year ago, but as I don't like veg foods, I never went there. Today my best friend come to home and asked for veg ac restaurant for hangout. He only prefer Dosa today. Then for the 1st time we enter here. Very small ac restaurant who serve south indian foods mainly. When we see the menu, there are lots of variety in dosa, idly and uttapam section. Someone ordered dhania masala dosa, may be I will try this next time. We order very simple dishes... Masala paper dosa and cheeseâ€‹ mix uttapam. Both are awesome taste and cheese uttapam was mouth watering taste. The sambar and specially chatni were WAO... Another yellowish chatni they served today, which is also good taste. After having food, I register in my mind that I will come here very soon.

Ordered a Mysore Masala Dosa with extra cheese & extra Masala, and a Dahi Vada.
Both were delectable but ordering extra masala was a bad idea coz it already comes packed with a lot of masala. Extra is unnecessary.
I would've given it a 3.5 but deducted -0.5 coz it is a bit uneconomical. However both the food & the prize is way better than Haldrirams'

I highly recommend this place.

Disgusting place so is the person on call.  While delivering a Dosa they say they cannot pack it in foil as none of the restaurant packs in foil and deliver.  The lady on call may be doesn't no know there are he'll other restaurants available in Kolkata to deliver in a proper way.  They are packing food in newspaper sick people at least teach the person taking call some ethics

If u r a cheese lover, try cheese sweet corn dosa,, and spicy Schezwan dosa was amazing too.. per dosa on an average costs about 150rs..

We had cheese dosa , cheese onion  dosa and masala dosa and idly. The Samanar quantity is good. Cost is very reasonable . They also do home delivery in bangur . A very nice place in short !

Chennai Xpress carries out the pure flavour of South Indian. Keeping in mind the current taste palate they haven't really restricted themselves into authentic south Indian food but extended themselves to various innovative dishes as well. 

Location: 
Located at Bangur Avenue lanes on the opposite of the HDFC bank. Easy to spot.

Experience:
Visited this place for breakfast along with my friend to try out something new. Tried their Idly bhurji and Xpress special Masala dosa which was suggested by them.
Idly Bhurji was something very different and tastes amazing as its little spicy and perfectly blend with masala. 
Coming to the Xpress masala dosa which impressed me the most from the first touch. It was a buttery cheesy affair from then and the masala inside comes along with dry fruits and justifies the price totally.
Food-wise they are very impressive and value for money. 
Another important fact is the hygiene. The outlet is clean and decorated neatly no experiments or didn't try to make it fancy. Overall my experience with them was seriously very good and strong recommendation for them.

Sunday Morning felt like having South Indian cuisine. Well ordered Idlis, Medu Vadas and a Cheese Masala Dosa. The Idlis were hot and soft and tasted well. The Medu Vadas were not that crisp. The Coconut Chutney was not that great. The Sambhar was hot and tasted well. Finally the Cheese Masala Dosa was well made. The Masala tasted nice but the content of Cheese was very less. Overall won't order from them again.

This place is not at all worth going. Yesterday went there and due to crowd we were are asked to wait. We stand outside the resturant for around 1 hour 15 mins but no one bothered to call us in inspite of empty seats. People coming after us were going and eating before us. After huge irritation when gone inside and asked what is going on then they told that they forgot about us . We were so insulted that we decided never to come back. The lady who was writing the names of waiting families was busy in her personal talks in her phone. Highly disappointed.

They seem to have forgotten about customer service. Every time I have been there, some customer is shouting for not being served well. It was my turn yesterday, and my mom's birthday was spoilt. If they cannot manage crowd they should say NO instead of upsetting and embarrassing guests and compromising on food quality. After waiting for an hour if this is how you plan to treat customers, m sorry to say we will have to look elsewhere for south Indian food. Dissatisfied and disappointed.

Well it's a small south Indian food hut with cosy sitting arrangements. Before entering, I thought it would be going to surprise me with its interiors but it didn't. As the name sounds big and people can have high expectations as Chennai Express is a movie with big star cast. Had ordered idli and masala Dosa. Couldn't find idli soft and fluffy. Can rate 2 out of 5 but masala Dosa was quite good. Overall it was average....

Well, I did not really enjoy the stupomedy (Read:- stupid comedy) movie â€“ Chennai Express feat: SRK and Deepika, but indeed, I was overwhelmed at my visit to this Chennai Xpress outlet conveniently based out of Bangur! Was looking forward to something light on my tummy and bingo! â€“ my critical eye discovered this hidden gem amidst the hustles and bustles of Bangur!

Without much ado, I entered it and ordered their Steamed Idly for dine-in â€“ which was served under 60 seconds (yes, you got that right â€“SIXTY seconds) â€“ itâ€™s implied, that they had it pre-prepared. Highly noteworthy that the sambhar was red-hot and coconut chutney was biting-cold. Idly was fluffy, but somewhat lacked the texture I look for in idlies â€“ as it was somewhat blackish!

Nevertheless, all the above items were high on taste, sambhar having great vegetable content and the complimentary garlic chutney deserving a special mention. Food presentation, ambience as well as service is great, and prices pretty reasonable, hence, there is no reason not to visit them.

Overall, they get a decent rating and a high recommendation from me!

This "Xpress" is located on the main road of Bangur Avenue serving South Indian dishes. I had Masala dosa, Onion Uttapam, Vada and Steamed Idly.
And I have been left in a confused situation whether to go for it again or not. The idlis were too small. But the vadas were huge. But they lacked a good taste. Masala dosa was good but the potato subzi inside wasn't. Onion uttapam was okay-ish. The chutney was good. The sambhar wasn't. Yeah, its kinda funny.

Location : At the Bangur main road, so reaching there is convenient. There is ample car parking space around the restaurant.

Ambience : Basics are available, air conditioned. Not too spacious, you can hear everything from the next table, and vice versa ;)

Food : Lovely food, we tried Idly, masala dosa, cheese onion dosa, vada, uttapam, coffee and tea. (Yes we were four). Tea can be equated with station wali chai. Everything else was superb. Chutney, sambar, special chutney.. you name it and it tasted superb.

Service: Warm service and above everything very quick. They also allow you to walk in to the kitchen to check hygiene (this confirms their quality).

and yes we ended ordering 3 more plates of idly again. Will surely visit again.

Had ordered food from Chennai Express last Sunday. Order placed on Swiggy. Taste wise I hav no issues. So full marks for it. Idli was soft and well steamed. Vada was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. Dosa was good too. One point of complain is the packaging. When a customer pays Rs. 40 as packing charges, be expects dignified packing. Wt I received was Idli and Vada crumbled into foil paper sheet. And dosa wrapped in a Newspaper. That's wasn't expected. Maybe the management can look into it.

Ordered - idli, cheese onion dosa and sambhar vada
Order comes after 18 mins of ordering and comes all together.
After that for refilling the sambhar it takes another 5 mins for them to do so
Idli - soft but lumpy inside
Dosa - crisp, tasty and cheesy but they serve a cheese onion dosa with masala stuffed inside - wrong combo
Vada - a lil over fried but tasted nice
Sambhar was good
Chutney was not at all fresh - was sour and smelled a bit

Chennai xpress film was the biggest hit so is this restaurant is one of the biggest hit restaurant in bangur avenue...
As they are the only one who serve lip smacking south indian food in bangur avenue.. Tried there rawa dosa,cheese masala dosa,fried idli all these dishes are just awesome.... 
Highly recommended to south indian lovers!
There staffs are also very humble in nature.

This is a very nice place for south indian food lovers located @ bangur avenue.. they have wide range of dosa's like: mysore, dhaniya, masala, cheese, and much more variety.. if you get confused to chose from different varieties then just order a platter so that you can get your can taste buds the variety of tastes.. idly too is good, soft. My recommendation for you is that must a place atleast once...

Very very very poor service. First we waited 20 mins then they called us a told us to sit down and took food order after 10 mins they told us to leave that table and wait out. What a poor service. No respect for their customers.

I think only restaurant in Bangur where you can eat quality south indian food. I love the masala dosa and steamed idli. The chutney and the sambar is too delicious.

I don't need to tell the person reading this that the food they serve is beyond AWESOME. Reviewers above me has already done that. People have also complained that the staff behaviour ain't good. I beg to differ: this ain't an airline where air hostesses will smile at you throughout the journey no matter what. If you're rude at 'em, you cannot expect them to give you their best, can you? From my personal experience, I want to say that the staff has always been very polite and nice to me; the owners: two ladies in their thirties always smile while talking to me. They make me feel as if I'm at my home enjoying delicious food. During rush hours, loud voices may come from the kitchen but it's totally normal, isn't it? I mean when you're in a hurry, you want your thing to be done first, don't you? That's just human nature. I will recommend that you visit the restaurant and find out yourself how AWESOME 'Chennai Xpress' is. Thank me afterwards. :]

Masala dosa, idli, onion butter dosas are all we have tried till date. When the place is relatively empty, the food is definitely very very good. But the problem starts when the place is crowded. The food quality then decrease immensely. Apart from that all the dishes caries an authentic South Indian flavor and taste. The chatnis and sambars are very good in taste. Overall a decent south indian joint.

Good food, in fact very authentic south Indian food, They have a garlic-onion chutney which is delicious. We enjoyed the dosas and upma there. But can improve on staff behaviour. More than the chefs, its the waiters who need soft-skill training. They can make the ambiance a bit quieter, as every time the reception lady screams at the boys, adding to the chaos. We do prefer parcels, since we do not have many southern flavoured restaurant in the locality.

The south indian food is not upto the mark and they compare their prices and food quality with the kolkata's best south indian restaurants. Behaviour is not good and some complain has been done for food so they say talk to our customers.1 is the minimum otherwise i wont give that rating also.

The place is really small but has a nice homely kind of atmosphere. The food is pretty average with a few interesting dishes in the menu. The owners of the place are extremely loud as well as rude. The entire time I was there I could constantly hear them shouting while giving instructions to their staff or talking on the phone. The place is filled with chaos. One of the owners sitting behind the counter actually started screaming at a customer and asked him never to return to the restaurant when the customer asked for his parcel to be made a bit quicker.

I stepped inside on a sunny day to have paper masala Dosa and even inquire about their home delivery and timings since i sgtay just 5 to 7 metres away .. to my utter surprise the way the staff spoke i didnt feel like ordering and simply walked out ! he was rude and when asked that although minimum order is 200 for home delivery but can u send it even when its 120 or 140 since its 15 to 20 seconds walk to which he rudely replied that even if u stay on top of this restro then also we cant do home delivery below 200 rs !!Â His choice of words and speaking tone both were offensive and rude .. food I havent had so my comment is not for that
