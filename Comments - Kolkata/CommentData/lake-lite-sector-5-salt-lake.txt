I visited this restro bar some days back accompanied with one of my senior. We had a few pegs of whiskey, reshmi kebab and french fries with fish finger. I did not understand why the reshmi kebab had a foam like coating,it certainly did not add any value and kind of annoying. fish fingers were nice,but serviced pretty late. booze price is on upper side.overall ok.

The Restaurant adulterates with drinks. We ordered blenders pride and they came up with something which is a probable mix of BP with Royal stag. Tastes completely different. 
When we inquired they did not even withdrew the order. But next drink was from a new bottle and it was just fine. We came to a conclusion that 100% they mix with the drink quality. Probably for lack of supervision. 
Pls do not order alcoholic drinks here.

A chance visit to the Swasthya Bhawan (the administrative building of health department) got us delayed in some paper work yesterday. Following the age old proverb ‘necessity is the mother of invention’, our famished selves discovered this restaurant within half a km of this building. Lake Lite is a restaurant quite popular among the office goers of Salt lake and New Town. The location makes it accessible for working professionals to have a quick lunch. They have an open bar and the alcohol is quite cheap, making this place a favorite hang out joint for after office parties. The restaurant was nearly full on a Friday afternoon. Since we were in a hurry, we decided to have just the soft drinks in the restaurant and get the food packed instead.

Before we start, yes i am that fat guy with a selfie face. That's the least important fact. However, if you are asking is that big beer jar is for me or not. No baby its for every one :-P. I cant finish it alone trust me. Honestly.

Straight to the Place :-

Its very near to my office frankly. I spend my weekends here.This place is swarming with offers. Happy Hours and all good stuff.A nice place to relax after your job is done and you call for the day. Food is average though but its time we realize this place is not famous for food.

Coming to Drinks:-

You almost any thing out here at a low pinch in the pocket.
Its something with good value for money. Drinks are cheap you get almost all local and many imported drinks. Also beers! Its Draught!

I can term this as an all men's bar. The crowd is mainly office goers of Sector V and New Town area.
Location is good, just adjacent to Swastha Bhavan.
The restaurant is very dimly lit, and air conditioning id also not that great. Not every variety of alcohol listed in the menu is available, so it's best to consult the waiters, rather than going through the menu.
Starter items like Fish Finger, Chicken Drum Stick, Dry Chilli Chicken are nice.
Price is mid ranged. You can try it out once on way back from office if you work in Sector V. Nothing special, otherwise.

Food quality is very average and taste is bland. Takes very long time to serve the food. Please do not try Chinese preparations as they are below average. The decor of the restaurant is not appealing rather it's more like a store room kind of atmosphere as you will find lots of cartoons are lying here and there. They serve drinking water directly from overhead tank. So don't try normal water and go only for mineral water.

The place looks even better after they renovated it! Went there for my Birthday lunch with my colleagues. We had a combination of chinese and Indian. The chicken bharta needs a special mention. Was awesome. They have also introduced hookah which caters to another crowd too. Overall a good place.

The good place to hangout with friend's or colleagues . Located just beside benfish building, it's mostly packed after the sun sets. Had their special chicken in dry format, french fries, Johnny walker, tandoori roti plain, plain naan, bhuna gosht, mixed fried rice, fish fingers and special chicken in gravy. French fries were good, crisp from outside n soft from inside, the dry special chicken was great, I guess it was made with fenugreek. The fish fingers were soft and the dip was good. The fried rice was good and portion was large. Naan n tandoori rotis were soft.the bhuna gosht was not upto the mark, the mutton pieces were no soft, it was fibery. The waiters were courteous. Overall a good place on weekends or last day of week to hangout. The sitting is sort of ok. The place is a bit cranky but seats are comfortable, the place is a bit small.

Though it wasn't my recommendation.
We didn't know about their speciality.
So, firstly we were ordering chinese foods like drums of heaven, crispy chicken etc...
Chinese preparations are not good.
Don't order.
Then suddenly we came to know about their mutton dishes.
We ordered and really we all were satisfied with the taste.

Good place to catch up couple of drinks with friends. The food is decent, no specific recommendation. We visited here during a busy Durgapuja evening and we found that the restaurant maintains its usual quality which is definitely good considering the huge rush during Durga puja. Staff behavior is also very polite, they did not have chicken bhartha in their puja menu ... But they went out of their comfort zone and made the same for us as we repeatedly requested for a chicken dish which can be shared amongst three of us. We loved it.

Strategically placed at a brilliant location, just at the entrance of Sector V and very near to College More. 
The ambiance is okay types for a leisurely afternoon or evening after the daily office grind for get togethers.
The variety of non veg items that they serve with the drinks do a world of good. 
Had been skeptical owing to it's moderate brand of mock-tails but frankly speaking we were taken by surprise. The drinks are moderately priced.
The service is good, perhaps a bit slow to some respects but overall can say the quality and taste of food offered was good for the price tag.

Sector 5 is the newest Park Street especially on a Friday!! Oh my god, what an ordeal!! The entire process of parking our cars to finding restaurants. Thankfully around 8:30 this place confirmed a space for 6 people! The restaurant was jam packed! Looked shabby but we had no choice. We were placed downstairs, prices are okay. We ordered for a kebab snd chilli chicken. The hard drinks are reasonably priced. The plates were dirty and service was snail paced! For the mains, we opted for chinese- dome hakka noodles with a fish in gravy and a chicken in gravy!

This is located near ashram more, have to go inside few meters from the benfish lane. Moderately priced bar cum restaurant. Snacks over here is tasty, my personal favorite is their babycorn, crisp chicken. Tried here espresso flavored vodka for the first time with my friends. 
Decor is very simple dine in setup, thankfully has couches too; on weekdays this place mostly remains empty. Staff behaviour is very good although beverage knowledge could be better. Affordable little place in sector v.

I will request to change the bar menu, shown here in Zomato as they don't comply with the present prices , which are 1.6 times the prices shown here.

The ambience was excellent, behaviour of the waiters were average but the price seemed a bit high considering the taste which was average. Esp their chinese cuisine which did not taste as per expectations, their north indian dishes seemed better though.

A pocket friendly Bar and resto in Sector 5. If you are looking for some energetic place then it would be a wrong option. But if you want a less costly place to have some drinks and good food in Sector 5 then you can consider Lake Lite. Overall an above average place.

Lake Lite is located near Swastho Bhavan Bus Stop in Sector-5, in a quaint little corner away from the most happening part of this area..Perhaps the location is a bit turn-off owing to which its mostly vacant compared to more famous bars like Opium in the locality.. Have spend quite some lazy evenings with friends enjoying our poison.. The biggest flaw I find in this place is definitely the exorbitant rates compared to the quality of foods and services provided here..
Coming to the ambiance, nothing much to talk about this place, a bit dimly light interiors with spacious seating and a well stocked bar though the ambiance is suited particularly for stags only.. But last time we went we felt kind of stuffy with a persistent foul smell inside.. The servers are seasoned one, catering efficiently to their regular tipplers..
Coming to the food we ordered:
Fish Irani Tikka: It was nicely marinated and spiced to the correct portions.. though I felt that the portions were less compared to the prices charged..
Chicken Salt and Pepper: The staple dish with your alcohol..can never go wrong.. the chillies, the onions, the tangy sauce, well just enjoy..
Schezwan Prawn Dry: Yet another tried dish and they do prepare it quite well.. 6 large pieces of tiger prawns well cooked and fresh..
Mixed Hakka Noodles: A bit of a letdown..way too oily and bland in taste.. also ought to serve proteins more generously for the prices charged..
Sadly the day we went, Budweiser was not available, so we had to settle with Carsberg Elephant and Blender's Pride..
Our total cheque comes to Rs.2131/-(all incl) for 3 people.. Overall if you wanna spend some quite evening with your friends away from the hustle and bustles.. and dont mind the pocket pinch, surely can give it a try..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 2.5/5
Service: 3.5/5

It is in Saltlake sector V, kolkata near sasto bhavan. Ambiance is average, service is so so not very bad not very good .
Food quality was not standard. I have been to this place 2-3 times and I must say in terms of food this place is not upto the mark. The food was not as good as expected when compared to price. 
We ordered chicken reshmi kabab as starter and for main course kulcha, chicken fried rice, chicken manchurian and sweet and sour prawn.
Since it is in saltlake area, must say great place to hangout with office colleague. 
Overall average experience, not recommended for foodies.

I am writing this review only on the basis of food that was served...went there with a lot of expectation after reading few positive reviews...but the experience was totally dissapointing....we did not order liquor though....

We had ordered a pan fried chicken noodles...with gravy...which came after a long wait...although the resturant was quite empty....the dish looked nice at the first glimpse...but it was really no where to be called a good chinese dish...they made it too sweet by adding lot of sugar may be...after having complained about the same to the waiter...he very comfortably escaped saying chinese gravies are a little sweeter...as if we were having a chinese gravy dish for the first time....chinese gravies are not sweeter rather mild in taste...where you can give it your own taste by adding sauces or pepper powder if you want to make it bit spicy...

Really not going to give it a second try anymore...

This is a bar and restaurant situated in the IT sector of Kolkata.
The ambiance is pretty decent and so is the crowd. Staff is prompt and helpful.
We went there mainly for drinks and for some finger food.
The experience was not bad at all.
Drinks are priced pretty economically except for LIIT which is 550/750 INR. Not sure of this anomaly.
The tandoori chicken was quite good and we ordered for repeat. The pieces were cooked properly and juicy enough.
There was one more chicken starter which was awesome but i don't remember the name.

But still I happen to be a regular here because of it's proximity to my office ( read : 10% corporate discount on the bill :) ). 
If you happen to visit this place , do try their Chinese dishes which are really good. Fish Chilli , Hakka Noodle , et al. For starters do try their American Saute'd Corn. In fact their Chinese is better than many other fancy restaurants. 

looking forward to have some North Indian or Mughlai food ? Stay away from this restaurant !!

Have you been to those restaurants which you have never thought of trying because they look kinda weird. And in a rainy evening you bump into that place and find out you were right, its really weird.
Being there is like doing a planchet in a rainy night.

Lake Lite, well just think of putting in couple of tables in your drawing room and starting a restaurant one fine morning. You go to Lake Lite only when you:

(A)
1. Are a situational weirdo 
2. Wanna check if a weird place is really weird.
3. Bored with life and aspire to do something weird

(B)
1. Decor: Amazingly Odd
2. Staffs: Para guys with white shirts and black pants
3. Food: Nevermind
4. Complimentary Drinks: Sorry, what?
6. Crowd: Weirdos majorly.
7. Value for money: What are you saying macha?
8. Referable: Only refer if you want to weird up someone's lunch/dinner.

Good place for first date: Only if you are not serious about the relationship and you just don't care.

Negative Points: Refer to Section B
Positive Points: It gives you a confidence to rush out of it and find out a better place in Salt Lake.

Another Friday endeavor, when friends and colleagues decided to go out and chill and as we were a bit low on the budget chose this place to hangout. Lake lite has nothing different to provide you in form of ambience, simple calm and cozy people of different age shape size be at one place. 
Prices are also not that high, rather reasonable but the service is not.
When you are low on budget and still want to hangout with friends this is a place you can consider.

Lake Lite is a bar cum restaurant where you can get average food and cheap alcohol.

The ambiance of this place is not that great. it is just like an average restaurant with a bar counter. The ambiance is ideal for hanging out with friends but it is not that great if you are with family or with boy/girlfriend. 

The price of the food and alcohol is a little cheaper than other bars of sector 5 (Like Opium, Hing etc.). The service quality is average and not anything special.

As we went there mainly for boozing so we took side dishes only. we ordered - Stir fried lamb, pan fried fish, boiled sauted corn with extra butter, Chili chicken, Fish finger and lake lite special 'Full Bhetki tandoori'. The lamb and the pan fried fish was good but others are not up to the mark. Specially the Bhetki Tandoori is not at all that great what was told by the waiters. Lastly we have ordered a trutti fruitti ice cream just for fun but actually it was better than all other dishes. I have never tasted a trutti fruitti with so much fruits (and not only with papaya). 

As a whole, this place is good if you want to enjoy a good time with friends in a little smaller budget. And one more thing. If you are corporate employee, you can get the corporate discount (10%) only on the food and not on drinks.

We had checked into this resturent for todays lunch, it is just beside the Swastha Bhaban, Saltlake Sector 5. The starter and desserts were very good. Main courses were good also. We have ordered chinese, so cannot talk about the other cuisines. World cup match was showing in the tv. The atmosphere was good. The main problem was the food was delivered to us too late. A lot of time had to spent for waiting for food. So only go there if you have some time in hand to spare. Overall it was a ok experience.

We ordered for sweet corn soup, chicken drumsticks and fish fingers. soup was lukewarm and starters had very less salt in it. the chicken drumstick was really bad with very little of chicken in it. my friends ordered indian fare like dal makhani, palak corn and jeera rice and they said the food was good. i ordered for chicken hakka noodles and chicken schezwan and was disappointed with the taste. They take ages to clean the table. Service was not prompt. Overall was not too impressed by this place at the first visit.

Location: Benfish more and near Swasthya Bhawan.

The date was 11.01.2015 a Sunday; I was in Nicco park big lawns to catch Karnivool live in action. Before that I wanted to get drunk and this place was the only one option I had in the near vicinity of big lawns. I have heard somewhere, that this place is pretty popular with the sec V office goers. From outside the place looked kind a decent...so I gave it a shot.

I entered the place around 4 pm, only 1 table was occupied by a group who were also heading to big lawns, otherwise the place was completely vacant...I guess, because it was a Sunday- a holiday for Sec V office goers.  The place has minimal decor, seating arrangements are fine enough and staffs are well behaved but service is on the slower side.

So I settled for five pegs of 100 pipers and in food my order was.....

-	Chilli chicken: decently prepared, the chicken pieces were soft and juicy but it was too oily.

-	Crispy chilli babycorn: tasted good but lacks the crispiness.

Overall, I really enjoyed my drinking session here coz the place was almost empty so naturally it was very silent inside and you rarely get such peaceful environment in a bar. Drinks and foods are reasonably priced. I may visit again.

Lake Lite is a Bar and Restaurant (you must have noted that the bar comes first..) is located at Benfish Tower, Sector 5, Salt Lake, Kolkata. Situated in Shastho Bhaban Area, one needs to get down at benfish/shastho bhaban bus stop. This restaurant has been in existance for a long time and despite being at stone's throw distance from my office, destiny did not facilitate my visit until last week. 

This restaurant was made popular mostly by men who would come here with friends to have few pegs with some starters and spend the evening happily chatting away.We went there for lunch with my colleagues. We reached there at around 12:50pm and we were the first customer of the day. The ambiance is good, moderately spacious, clean with neatly arranged tables and chairs. The room moderately lit, probably to go with the bar and restaurant theme.

Immediately after we took our seat, the waiter came over to take our order. My collegues were veterans at this restaurant and hence they knew which dishes were good and which were not. Here is what we ordered:

Starter : Manchow soup - Rs.85/-; Fish Pan Fry - Rs.230/-

Main Course : Mix Hakka Noodles - Rs.180/- ; Kung Pao Chicken - Rs.220/-

Others : Sweet Lime Juice

On an average, the starters and main course took about 15 minutes to reach our table. I would rate the service as good considering the attention and courteousness of the waiter and waiting time. The Manchow Soup and Fish Pan Fry were excellant and are highly recommended. The Mix Hakka Noodles had lamb, prawn, chicken and egg and was good. Kung Pao Chicken was another dish to die for. I am noting it down as one of my favourites. 

The overall taste of the dishes was really good. We tried only a small subset of the entire menu which was quite extensive starting from choices of tandoori, rice varieties, desserts, vegetarian and non-vegetarian indian dishes, chinese dishes and varieties of soups and there is a probability that my colleagues carefully navigated to extract few of the best offerings. General feedback which I get from multiple people, it's better to try chinese dishes rather than going for indian dishes. For me, Lake Lite has been a really good experience, good service and tasty food. The quantity served is pretty good and cost is on the reasonable side.

A great place to eat in sector V,salt lake. Decent ambiance and decor but what gives the restaurant an edge is the quality of the food and prices. Hakka chicken noodles and Mixed fried rice along with lemon chicken and chilli chicken were at par with other chinese restaurants. In Indian had Kadai Murg(boneless) with Tandoori butter roti, the combination of taste were delightful. The bar caters too all your needs and easy on pocket. A must visit if you are in vicinity.

visiting day : 29th Nov 2014

after having a blast at mohit chauhan concert at nicco park, we decided to have dinner at lakelite just near the back gate of nicco park, near swasthya bhawan chawk .
i had visited this place many times for project treat or b'day treats. 

The starter on lamb is best here.

at night when you enter this Bar & Restaurant , it's bit dark and the seating arrangement is quite normal. the problem here is that they are very lazy in cleaning the tables, and it has an open bar which makes the drinkers enjoy the environment a bit more.

on last occasion we had ordered Lakelite special mutton curry and tandoori butter roti which was really tasty. and the cost for 3 people was 700 but as we were very much hungry, we ordered directly main course. 

btw Drinks are less priced here, so many of the people go this place for drinks and starters only. :)

Been there this week on a Thursday evening and its my first time there. The place is cozy, specious and well maintained. We mainly went there for a couple of drinks and ordered chilly mushroom, tangri kabab and and hariali kabab..all the items were fresh and very tasty. They were suggesting for topshe fry/crab which is my fav but one friend doesn't eat fish so next time I will try that. Pocket pinch is not very big and affordable. Only thing they have to take care is the bathroom space is very small and only one person can go at a time. Overall satisfied.

Had given my birthday treat here. 
We were a group of 15 people. And as long as we stayed there, there were hardly a few people coming in. Service was awful considering there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant. Food was average. I'd suggest you have Chinese and avoid Indian cuisines. But we were happy with the final bill. So all well that ends well.

Situated in shastho bhaban area, at the entrance of sec V, drop at benfish/shastho bhaban bus stop, from there walk 1 minute max to the right hand side. As It's office area bar cum restaurant so maximum crowds gather in the evening for after office booz. all though this bar is near my office area I never visited before, so for a quick booz, with some of my office colleagues, I went there.

The cost is reasonable not too overpriced. It's moderate. Ambiance is good. Full of staffs but lake of service. Very much disappointed. After drinks selection, drinks arrived after 10 minutes staffs were pushing for tandoori dishes as they were good blah blah... but I wasn't in the mood of tandoori then, I tried "drums of heaven", waited 30 minute long and asked 2 times for the current state of food finally the drums fall into our plate. It was very much average. Too much sauce used but the chicken pieces were good. didn't tried anything else but willing to visit again. But Service has to be upgraded.

P.S: If you want to spend some time in a restaurant with very much poor service, just to spend time can be there.

For A budget weekend hangout with friends.
I will recommend lake lite. 
The Chinese food is fast served and good on the taste buds .
Starters on the tandoori selection take a little longer but is even better on the taste buds.
Friendly staff who will help us choose and are honest and knowledgeable about their kitchen status before they take your order.

The food quality as well as quantity are really good. I liked the service as well as ambience very friendly. In food, try for rice/noodles, it will easily suffice for two. if someone wants to try starter, must have red roast lamb, schezwan fish or fish finger. these are superb, specially the lamb. even if anyone is planning to go with large group, they have enough space for it... i would say this is a must try restaurent in sec v.

Sector V has been my destination for the last 8 years, thanks to my consulting job ! So what is a good place to catch up over few beers and tit-bits after office. If you ask this to people in the answer you would get is different from mine. Yes but lake lite I think is a nicer place with much more room, reasonably decent choice of liquor including few domestic wines stored at a decent temperature. Service is very prompt as expected from very young staff and they are willing to tweak the menus a bit for the loyal customers which is great! Food is ok, nothing over the world but then people come here mostly for the liquor, so be sure you have your priorities sorted. Having said that the volume of the dishes is extraordinary. Any standard dish can easily serve two people. Price of both food and liquor are very reasonable. Wise people would stick to the popular dishes instead of trying any fancy food here. Overall a very affordable place for weekly visits after office that won't pinch your pocket.

The Chicken Kali Mirch Tangri Kebab is something to die for... Same goes out for their Fish Irani Tikka. Their Prawn Namkeen is also my favorite. The stock of alcohol in their list is also luring. I am quite regular at Lake Lite for the last 1.5 years and it has never disappointed me. The price is quite reasonable compared to other bars in Saltlake. This is one of my most favorite places to hang out. The staffs are very courteous and try their best to deliver things on time. I would highly recommend this place to everyone....

I can't recall how many times I visited this establishment but like the value for money here. My favorites are Crispy Fried Baby Corn, Konjee Crispy Lamb, Crisy Pepper Chicken, Pan Fried Noodles. Won't recommend their Mughali cuisine. Liquor is cheap compared to the restaurants in Sector V area. The location is bit off at the brink of Sector V. During evening they have provision for live band. Staff are courteous and they know me by face because of continuous patronage.

Lake lite is located just in the heart of the IT hub of the city in Salt lake sector 5. At first glance on entering the restaurant you will notice the well maintained, neat and clean ambiance with courteous staff to guide you to the table. In a single thought I can say this is one of the best restaurant for Chinese cuisine available in this locality.

I have been to this restaurant thrice and they never let my opinion change for a single time. I forgot the fancy names of their dishes but they are awesome to have. I have tried chicken, fish and lamb dishes here and all were delicious, especially the chicken drum sticks. Food is less oily and has authentic flavours which allows one to eat more. Dessert is not advisable because they don't have much. Cost is moderate not too cheap nor costly. If you are around this place and need to satisfy your stomach with Chinese food look no further.

the place is a bit in the dark as there are no shops around and after office hours the place is only visited by local office people. but the restaurant has good number of tables inside which can accommodate big crowds. food is good, specially the chinese starters. liquor is decently priced, also one can bargain a bit to get some discounts. regular visitors do get some discounts in liquor prices. overall, a nice place to visit with your friends/colleagues after office hours. for family dinners, i would not suggest as the place is really in a dark surrounding in the evening.

i personally  like lake lite bar  &  restaurant  , cozy small place with wide availablity of drinks . VAT-69 ( my personal  benchmark )  here would cost you   Rs  180 /  60 ml peg  which is fair enough .  food is  a bit costly  but pardonable since drinks  are  so reasonably priced  .  try out  JIM  BEAM  ( bourbon )  with  thumbs up here  , heavenly  feeling .  i would   reccomend  their   chinese fish  items as as  a  must try  .  ambience is pretty  cool too  .  overall  a YES  from  my side . i would have  given  it 4 stars  but because  of  the relative cost of the  food  i give it 3
