Nice bengali food u wl gt here.it is in a small street behind clg sqr.seating space is small and it becomes crowded almost everyday in the noon during lunchtime.so if u want a comfortable eating experience it is better to go around 12 in the morning.now lets come to foods.they make RICE,DAL,BHAJA.fr veg things they make different items in different days.i hv tasted here ALU POSTO,DHOKAR DALNA,MURIGHONTO,MOCHAR GHONTO.all of them r nice.fr non veg they make chicken mutton nd different kinds of fish.but i wl personally recommend to try fish items here.among them i liked CHINGRIR MALAIKARI,ILISH BHAPA,BHETKIR PATURI. See it is a middle class hotel,not a luxury one.but if u compare the quality with price its really awsome.u seldom find such tasty bengali lunchs at the cost of 150rs to 200rs per head.also they make 2 or 3 types of chutney everyday.

What an awesome place to have authentic Bengali food. Brilliant in one word. Located in a bylane off Mg road, it is a pice hotel run by a Kaku and Kakima. Food is marvellous. We had plain rice, special muger dal, begun bhaja, alu begun chingri chocchori, golda chingri malaikari, ilish bhapa, mutton er jhol, anaras chatni ar papad. Had one of the best meal of my life. Special mention to the ucche begun chingri and mutton. Service is very friendly. Pricing is reasonable. Everything is just perfect. Thumbs up!!

Small scale and homely food. Delivery timing is really impressive. Staff are very hospitable and polite. Dont expect any fine dine ambience at such dirt cheap prices. Just enjoy the food here.

This shabby yet awesome small hotel caters to the dying need of "Maachh-bhaat" er lunch in college street. This is perhaps the only lunch-serving-hotel I have seen in that area which can boast of serving just right flavour of homely cooked meal without that pungent fishy smell & flies roaming around your plates! They have a daily-changing dynamic menu with lots of varieties. Don't just go by the looks, enter & give yourself a sumptuous treat!

Awesome food with simplicity. Food is usually served on a fresh bamboo leaf, which makes it even attractive. Varoius veg and non-veg dishes ar
e available. Sometimes you may find innovative dishes like PaaNchmisali torkari with "ucchhe-chingri-begun"...üòä

A history, a nostalgia, a true heritage all combo is the MAHAL.
I went here for last 14 yrs. Best bengali food with the price which real kolkatan can afford.

Ekta feel ar ekanto paoyajay. No hesitation or not any superconsernes like other hotel.

All the menu written on white board.
The alsao sugest that this fish is so yummy so u can order that instead of others.
The ower kaku and kakima also very good hearted.
N.b. if possible kindly go in to the house, the mess is used by many famous people.
So, best barir khawa...
MAHAL.

Mahal is a place where you can find all kinds of Bengali home cooked food..it's cheaper as well then other Bengali food serving restaurant. It's a small place with simple homely decor, but if you talk about food it's tasty and reminds of your mom's or grandma's kitchen. It's one of the oldest joint of college street serving bengali home cooked style food for long years. Ambiance is like 'purono kori kath er bari' but service was prompt and clean.
We ate 'bhaat' (boiled rice) which was very well cooked and quantity is good enough for one adult. 3/5üëç
Moong dal tasty and enough for two, it's nither runny nor too heavy perfect to go with rice . 3.5/5üëç
Posto bora is crispy and tasty. 5/5üëå
Katla bhapa is wonderful. Fish was fresh, well fried and the size was good. 4/5üëå
Parse with sorshe bata was equally awesome. Fish was fresh. Gravy was marvellous. Must try. 4.5/5üëå
Chingrir malaikari was the star dish. Tasty, fresh and such bengali malaikari style gravy. 4.5/5üëå
Murgir mangsho was good less spicy yet tasty,     soft, juicy and fresh. 3.5/5üëç
Amsotto chatni was good too.. balanced taste. Chunty is actually a palate cleaner and it's sweet, sour, little salty and spicy with bhaja mosla, really cleans up the palate after eating so much of fish. 4/5üëå
Papad or papor bhaja was nice and crisp but greasy. 3/5.
We were missing the Misti doi and Sondesh.

Overall a nice experience.

One of the best dining place is College Street. Mahal is one of the oldest and one of the best place in this area. Their food are not only excellent in taste but the place also maintains very cleanliness. I go here often for lunch or dinner.
Here are the foods you will love to have at Mahal.
Katal Kaliya , Katal Bhapa, Parshe Fish, Tangra and specially their Golda Chingri. These are very very tasty here.
Mutton is also good.
The place is average is size. They serve mostly casual dining.
But quality is excellent here. And prices are damn cheap. Per person Rs 100 is enough.

This eatery is located at College Street .

Location is bit tricky.

Shabby ambience.

Prompt service.

Serves Bengali homely food.

Had bhaat, mug dal  & Chingri Malaikaari , papor & chaatni. All were  lightly made and were very homely and tasty.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

I couldn't give this place anything but 5 star rating. Mahal in College Street is a place where I had and still my lunch and dinner often. You can't guess the quality food they serve without visiting here.
The place is bit hard to locate, its close to College Square. Ask anyone and they will direct you.
Mahal is the perfect dining place in College Street area.
A plate of rice cost Rs.10 and for extra rice it cost Rs.5.
Any dish you try here is awesome. Try their Katol Korma and Katol Bhapa. I bet its one of the best you have till date.
Also they make brilliant other fish dishes. Ilish, Bhetki or Parshe everything is good here. Their chef is one of the most talented one.
Chicken is good, Mutton is better and their Chingri (prawn) is best.
They make a special Daal at Rs.15. This is best.
Ambiance is good. The place is very clean and tidy. And their prices are most reasonable. Meal for two will cost you Rs150 to 200 on average.
Much recommend.

A place, which might be a bit difficult to find, but once you do can very well live up to the Bangali taste bud. They serve some pretty well made, delicious homely dishes much familiar to us. From the sonamug dal, begun vaja to the more exquisite chingri malaikari, mutton kasha, sorshe ilish and so on. Not at all into eating fish, I can say this is the only place ever that I have had fish fry and loved it. Judging from everyone else's feedback, it's better than most other places. Now, the other things I am experienced with like the mutton, the posto bora,kumro ful vaja and every other simple to complicated thing is exactly like you would want them to taste. There are some pretty amazing Bengali restaurants out there. But in a less of a pocket pinch, this place can give them a run for the money. It is just a bit too crowded mostly due to lack of space. But once you get to sit, I am sure the craving for fish would at least be sufficed.

A very good authentic bengali restaurant. If you are not an elitist who only goes to air conditioned ultra clean restaurants, then it's a perfect place for a bengali food lover at a cheap price.
