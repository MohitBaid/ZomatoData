Quality is very poor, The rice used in chicken fried rice are very fat rice which similer to road side Bengali Rice stall. Chicken Manchurian was tasteless and gravy was very thick due to excessive use of arraroute.

The quality you serve is suggestive of the clientele you target. Even after going through some pretty negative reviews, we went forward with the decision to order from this place. The Biryani was average, so was the Rogan Josh. I guess, the quality was not surprising after all and probably deep down we knew what we were in for. I wouldn't say the food was horrible....but they have a long way to go to achieve good standards.

I had ordered food once but it was a horrible experience. I had ordered Chicken friend rice and chilly chicken but everything was worthless. The fried rice was not coocked properly i.e. wasn't fried properly. Same with the chilly chicken. Needless to say, that both fried rice and chilly chicken were tasteless....a total waste of money. I suggest everyone to think twice before ordering food from this place.

Tried their rolls.....I found the same okish. Fresh and soft pieces of chicken fillings...but one serious problem is, they are using "DALDA" for frying their breads for making rolls.....which is not at all desirable at present, when people are trying to maintain their health condition also. "DALDA" always creates problem during digestion in our stomach... Â 
So i request not to pull down your quality, try using white oil for frying your foods......

So, it didn't went to well with this take away counter.. I was expecting a little bit more. Ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka Chow and Chilli Chicken. Except the chow, the remaining items were below average. The rice was not of good quality and it was not well prepared.. The chilli chicken was disastrous. It was not chilli but SALTY chicken. I love salty food but it was way too salty and the pieces were so small, I don't know what to say. These guys needs to improve alot, if they had to stay in the longer run..

Who your target customer demography is, will decide the type of product, its pricing, and the location of the outlet. To its credit, Dine Away scores high on this, in theory. 

Located strategically at the foot of Bijan Setu, it caters the huge middle class crowd that's not the type to go to Acropolis Mall + the daily commuter crowd going to Ballygunge station. The pricing of dishes also show the entire range from 160 bucks for chinese chicken dish to as low as 65 for a Chicken tarka + roti and ten bucks higher for noodles and chilli chicken. It clearly wanted to be a mix between para-r dokan serving indian chinese and dhaba food and stand-and-eat daily commuter or single travellers.

So far so good. Then things begin to go downhill with the food. The Chicken Tarka was badly cooked with little seasoning and lots of chunks of ginger, and the dal was barely edible after a few gulps. The noodle combo was better and if I take out the ginger chunks abundantly thrown in, the chilli chicken with two pieces of chicken was pretty decent for the price I paid for it. The noodles were forgettable, even when matched against standards of greasy-tasty versions served at many roadside stalls. 

In verdict, there isnt one. The place is too new to be written off, or given a harsh review on. But I do hope the management would look into the quality of food being served.
