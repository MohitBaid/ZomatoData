When I was in school we often used to have momo and chowmin from here. We liked it. Don't know about now since I last visited this in 2012..

It is a fast food center located near hedua. It has two counters, one for rolls and moglai foods and other one is for Chinese foods. I tried it's rolls and Chinese preparations. Chinese cuisines are really awesome with reasonable price.

This is usually the local go-to place for that scrumptious egg, double egg or chicken roll. No matter how you want your roll to be, these guys surely have a fix!

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: Location is quite simple and easily traceable, its just at the Vivekanand crossing beside Chacha Hotel. Making the name for themselves with the quality of Rolls they serve for years, they have become a renowned roll centre at this region. From making rolls to chowmien and momos they gives you so much for your fast food hunger.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: Its a takeaway and they also provide you with few benches on the foothpath for your comfort. Staffs are friendly and serves fast.

FOOD : It was certainly not planned to be visited so being an honest and hard working foodie i ordered few for some quick bites in forms of Chicken Momo and Veg Chowmein.

Chicken Momo was well made. It was soft and nice, chicken was filled in there well and taste was pretty good. Made me Happy.

Veg chow was on the average side. They are basically good in rolls but didn't expect them to do too well in chowmien an all.

MOMO: 8/10
Chow : 7/10

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality was average of the dishes. Quantity was satisfactory for one person in the chow, lil disappointed when i saw the Momo plate because it contained only four pieces of momos where others serves 5. Still the size of the momo was quite decent so it was ignorable.

CONCLUSION: A long wait to try this place ends here but still Roll is due Â which is my main target to taste here. Still not done with Kumkum.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and Experience to this place.

This is one of the oldest roll centres of north kolkata. Located opposite vivekananda house on bidhan sarani, this place is a perfect stop for some fast food. I have been here a number of times and have ordered variety of items ranging from fried rice, chowmin to rolls and chilli chicken. Of all the items here, i am specially fond of the egg roll that they make here.

Suddenly while surfing through zomato, I found this particular fast food stall to be present here. I'm summing up my overall experience in this review and not of any particular day. This is a fast food stall and is located on bidhan sarani beside chacha's hotel, close to Vivekananda road. 
      All you will find here is street food. They serve rolls, chow mein, fried rice, chilli chicken and even momos. During my college hours, oftentimes I feel hungry and this particular joint strikes my had. I always prefer chicken fried rice here as I don't like the taste of the chowmein. The rice comes in good quantity and good to taste at a cheap price. I haven't tried their rolls or momos yet. The only problem with this place is that there is limited seating facility and there is a hygiene concern !!
