I personally love this place. Although it's shabby and the hygiene is not upto the mark, the food here is delicious. It's been more than 6 years I am having biriyani of this place. And I love it. A pack of biriyani on our way back to home is must everytime we visit the area.

Ambience & decor is very bad... cheap quality restaurant... i have tried lachcha patatha,mutton hydrabadi & mutton biriyani... except lachcha paratha two dishes were really very bad in taste... i have tried roll once a time.. it was so delicious...
It is well known for their paratha... other wise very bad place!ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž

A hot selling shop . It's not much of a dining place. The space  a is limited and has a huge rush of passing by customers. Pack a few biriyanis for your sleepover or grab a quick roll, it's unhealthy, it's oily and it's delicious :P

This eatery is located at Chandni Chowk , mainly serves North Indian menu and fast foods.

Zero ambience. Untidy environment.

Service is good.

Tried Egg Chicken Roll, which was decent in size and tastewise was good with juicy stuffings.

Price is economical.

Public Fast Food Center is located in Chadni Chowk, behind the E Mall. I have visited here once for their Rolls. I had their Chicken Roll. Well it was really good. The roll was bit over sized. Lot of Chicken stuffed and good quality paratha.
Prices are also reasonable.

Chandni chowk really lacks some fine quality food places as well as finer diner. What you get here are some small outlets and some franchises in forms of Aminia or sabir's.Â 
But it made me surprised after i saw such a huge line in this very place. Located in the heart of chandni market, very famous at this point and serves some good qulity of food in some decent prices. Tried their Biriyani, chicken chaap and laccha Paratha. All the items were very tasty but a bit on the oily side which was annoying. Taste wise it was pretty good. Though u will be satisfied with their food m sure,

NOTE: this review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Pocket friendly but not a very hygeinic place

On the streets of Chandni Chowk this basic restaurant is well famous for their rolls. Most of the time crowd gives you the confident to try them.

Location : This restaurant is located in the lane of Chandni Chowk just opposite to the well famous Sabir Restaurant. The nearest metro is Chandni Chowk.

Decoration : It is a very basic restaurant where you can expect value for money foods with no decorations & HiFi ambiance. The restaurant is divided into two floors where ground is for roll counter & take away & 1st floor is the dining. There is not huge space inside so little space & sitings can make you little uncomfortable. The lightings are very normal & the place overall doesn't looks clean & hygienic at all.

Staffs & Management : The service from the staffs are pretty fast but don't expect them to be super professional.

Foods : Being a Biryani lover how couldn't I tried this.

Chicken Biryani : The Biryani looked just like other normal Biryani outlets of same category. It came with boiled potato & 1 piece of chicken. The rice quality was pretty average but it was well mixed with spices & it was cooked well that makes it tasted good. The Biryani was neither too dry nor too oily. Chicken piece was little hard & not well cooked. Very highly spices used made the chicken taste little odd. The quantity on the other hand was average.

Rolls : Their big, rich, thick, crispy fried Laccha Parathas are great, so the rolls became great too. Chicken pieces of Chicken rolls are soft, lite spicy & tasted good. However they use little low grade sauces for it.

Pricing :  The pricing is very affordable over here for main items & rolls as well. However you need to compromise decorations, ambience & hygiene little bit. 

Conclusion : Standing beside Sabir Restaurant if you are thinking about which one to go for! Then you can easily try this. They offer much better value for money foods & in some aspects they are better than Sabir too. Their rolls are also good for your little hunger.
