I ordered Butter chicken and tandoori roti... which wasn't good enough.... the tandoori roti was rubbery rubbery and chicken was soft but it was literally floating in oil...

Horrible.  I have ordered kebab as a starter after completing my starter they served main course after 25 minutes. Very poor service. Their service is like road side vhat hotel. I will never visit this place.

A recently opened multicuisine in Sonarpur nearby railway station.The ambience was good and the staff were accomodating and pleasant.We had ordered chicken malai tikka for starters which was soft and succulent ..
Then we had tandoori roti and chicken tikka masala which was equally tasty.

Ayesha Multicuisine Restaurant is a new restaurant which has come up in the Sonarpur area, just opposite to the Mio Amore outlet near Sonarpur Railway Station. Since the restaurant is located near our college, we decided to give this place a visit especially after hearing good things from people who visited here before us. The place is very large and would easily accommodate a large gathering of people. We ordered Kashmiri Pulao and Chicken Tengri Butter Masala (2 pieces). The Kashmiri Pulao tasted delightfully good and had a large quantity which could easily satisfy upto 3 people. The cost attached to the dish makes it perfect for everyone concerned. The side dish of Chicken Tengri Butter Masala was equally well prepared and had a satisfying gravy accompanying it. The hotel management have included GST in the price printed on the menu which makes it easier for people eating on a tight budget to order. Zomato's evaluation of 700 for 2 is certainly not true as I found the place very cheap compared to their description. The staff are very polite, clean and friendly people devout to serving the best experience possible. Since this place is located quite close to our college, this won't be the last time I enjoyed their hospitality. Great experience at one of the farthest corners of the city.

The food is inedible. The mutton in the mutton biriyani was raw, the mutton kassa had no taste.
The price is low but I would not pay a single rupee for this shitty food
