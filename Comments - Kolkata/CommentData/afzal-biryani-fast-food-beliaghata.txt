A very small outlet near the Beliaghata petrol pump which serves you Biriyani at a very nominal price. Having said the nominal pricing the taste of the Biriyani is not so bad what might be a notion by the pricing. I agree that they might not be using best of the ingredients but it's pretty decently average. Items are limited only Biriyani and chaps are available.
