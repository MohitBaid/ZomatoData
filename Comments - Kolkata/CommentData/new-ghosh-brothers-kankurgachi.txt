You will be pleasantly surprised by the variety and the tastes of the sweets. Especially the ones made with Gur. Go for the baked rasogolla, sitabhog and baked chomchom also. Great comfort for the pallet as well as the pocket too.

New Ghosh Brothers is one of the leading names of sweets parlours in Kolkata. Located in Kankurgachi, they used to serve decent and variety of sweets.I just love their items specially the Chocolate Sandesh,it's lipsmacking. Try it.

Well, a pretty popular sweet meat shop and 1 amongst the few based out nearby the Bengal Chemical Kankurgachi area. I am quite a regular out here subject to the fact that my visits are not as frequent as it ought to be – given the fact that my house is quite far away from them!

They get full marks for hygiene, a trait often missing from quite a number of sweet shops. Their variety does blow your mind away – and you often get confused which items to try and which not!

In line with the winter cravings for gur, we arranged for their gurer rosogolla and gurer Sandesh. Both were quite nice, but we felt that the sondesh was not pure chhena – some amount of flour was mixed into it! The gurer rosogolla deserves a special applaud for that size, that sponge, that taste and that price tag.

Service is grossly fine and rates somewhat high! And yes, do not forget to visit them to satiate your sweets tooth in the forth-coming winter days.
