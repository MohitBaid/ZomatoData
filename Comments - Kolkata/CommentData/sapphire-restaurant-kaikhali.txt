The worst ever restaurant can be. They simply rejects the orders from Zomato. A restaurant who refuses orders,their fate is not difficult to understand. I would rather give 0 but not in provision.

Oh Boi!!! I been here as it was very nearby me where i stay in kolkata.
Food was below averrage..I order for chicken kolhapuri ..the chicken was like rubber it was not cooked prooerly.. Lot of oil in chicken gravy. I order for lachha paratha which they make exact like roll bread.. that was also too oily coz paratha was cooked in tawa not in tandoor.
I will not recommend this restaurant to any one.

I do not know why people giv a positive review on this restaurant.I ordered two chicken rolls at 8:05 pm .The restaurant is 10 mins away from my house .I contacted zomato at 8:30 and immediately my order changed to on the way and from then till now the time is 9:20 food has not been delivered .Note its two chicken rolls and my house is 10 mins away .So im still waiting pretty frustrated and dissapointed .Guess i expected too much from a local street restaurant stall trying to deliver on online markets .I do not expect my food to arrive until 10 pm or doubt it will ever arrive and will probably be super cold

Just like the appearance of the eatery suggests, it is a roadside food stall (don't go by the name!). Not great ambience, not very healthy food but if you are hungry and not planning to post your photos on Instagram, this is the place for you! They serve tasty rolls which however should be eaten soon after they are served because they don't stay tasty for very long. Their home delivery is moderately fast. Altogether, a pocket friendly eatery to go to when you are starving!

Their chicken rolls are a competition to many other well known restaurants. 
Absolutely amazing chicken rolls they make. 
Also tried their malai kebab and mixed chowmien. 
Pretty good.

Have ordered many times from "Sapphire". To my expectation, I love the taste of food what we have ordered so far. Best dishes so far was biriyani (any of ur choices), tandoori, kebabs, chowmein, rolls üòä. Even Whenevr we feel like having biriyani at home, we just make a call and voilla! Its here (after 30mins though). üëç

Sapphire is one of the most expensive and strongest astrological stones. As the name denotes sapphire, it won't stand to it at all. Had ordered tandoor and kebab but was not at all satisfied with the taste. Can't afford to visit again...

Once upon a blue moon, I have been returning home and there were no family members or food available. One these kind of intense situations, I generally prefer to buy dinner or have it in a restaurant. But, since during evenings, I have had some stuffs, I was kinda full and thus decided to have two rolls as 'light' dinner.
Situated in Kaikhali, just along the VIP Road, you will not find this eating joint until you look closely. It is ruggedly designed and you feel little clumsy to enter. Having heard they they serve great rolls, I ordered despite being reluctant.
The person taking the order hardly talked and my order was dispatched in rather fast pace.
While, I should have eaten it as and when it was served, I felt like having it after reaching home. After reaching home and completing the bath, I took a bite. Well, it tasted pathetic. On suspicion, I opened the rolled paratha and found rather queer thing. The paratha was possibly cooked in very cheap oil or I think they used animal fat to prepare it. I was so disgusted, that I didn't even warm it up and threw the whole thing in the dustbin. Well, what more to say? I should have followed my instincts.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Ofcourse, a big NO.

Qs) Why have I rated them 1.5 stars?
Ans) On benefit of doubt, that they serve other items in a eatable condition.

Definitely not a 5 star restaurant, nor pretending to be one, Sapphire can best termed a glorified roadside eatery. But compared to other roadside eateries offering food for around the same price as this place, Sapphire is gold standard.¬†

The egg chicken roll here is gigantic and delicious to say the least. Another dish I love is the wings kabab option - much cheaper than the chicken tandoor and just as filling. They also roast the kababs in front of you so you can actually instruct how rare would you prefer them.

Also try Chicken cutlet, chicken steam momo and Moglai. The quantity and taste is very good for the price. All in all a solid 3.5 in my book.

I have been regularly eating up a lot of food from here when am strictly with almost "no cash".
One cant actually sit down n grab some food because the ambience isnt good at all but yes definitely order and enjoy sitting back at home.
I had chicken and mutton biriyanis both pocket friendly but not worth but yes,their mixed fried rice n garlic chicken is amazing.
Starters are good as well. Try it once you actually have a crunch in ur pocket.
Happy eating peeps üíû

A great place for takeaway or gome delivery for people living near kaikhali. The biriyani is brilliant in here. Also try their famous chicken roll! Serves as a full meal. Not a great place to dine it. Infact has absolutely no decor. If you want to enjoy tasty awadhi dishes in the comfort of your home and u happen to live near by, they are the people you need to call to ;)

The only good part of Sapphire restaurant is that its acts as a saviour as its on the main road of Kaikhali just before Airport area so if you are travelling from far and you need a grub on your way then you can consider this place not for its location or not for its ambience either but just for its huge size rolls that they make which is one of a kind .
I sometimes tend to eat Chicken rolls as thats what  the only good thing I would ever want to eat from here as that's made pretty good though sometimes dry fillings make it boring in taste however very filling and the pricing is also ok as for they give for it .
The service is always on a rush so if you are lucky you will get your roll in 10 mins and if not when there is a heavy demand of people with their orders then you will end up waiting 30 mins for a single roll and that's what I faced a couple of times.
Apart from this there are other food options like Chinese and Indian dishes here however the interiors are absolute nothing just plain colour walls and tables are just 4 as much as I can recall with a few waiters too who are fast with the food but the food lacks the strength as the focus goes on more oil and masala then the taste and aroma .
Never try this place for a proper family dine just another local restaurant you may consider this when there is no option in hand and when your chips are low .

Seriously a nice place to have fast foods like rolls and moghlai. At such a low price the quantity and quality of food here is never compromised with. My favorute dish is egg,chicken roll which is large I size but costs only 60. Hence overall a small b'day party can be given to frnds here or can prove to be best when u r hungry but don't have ur lunchbox. I suggest all to try this place at least once.

Honestly! It is good but not the best!¬†
Things I liked-
1. Their rolls (Egg/Veg/Chicken)
2. Chicken items (I preferred Chicken Maharaja as I don't find this item in any other restaurants)
3. Biriyani (Chicken/Mutton) is okay okay.
4. Home delivery is good.
5. Quantity served is good.

Things I disliked-
1. I felt that it is somehow expensive over quality.
2. Lack of space. Very small in terms of dining in there.

Alltogether- Average rated local restaurant. Good for home delivery.

If you're low on money this is the place to go. I only go here for the big fat chicken rolls. One roll is enough to fill you up in between meals. Tandooris are also great here with and the price is comparatively cheap. Noodles and fried rice are a bit oily here.
About the ambience, take away is always a better option.

Best place for reasonable price(Near Airport). I am a regular customer of the place for the past four years. Would suggest you to try Chicken Maharaja. I have gone many places but this particular dish is the best I have ever taken. Also huge quantity for affordable price is their priority. Home service is good and service time is also good. Dislike of the restaurant is its size.
