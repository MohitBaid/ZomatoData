All I like from here is pastry and those cookies. They make the delicious cakes. My favourite from here is the truffle. Aah I can't forgot it's taste. I have been there many a times. Its really a worth having a piece of cake there.

A pastry and confectionery parlour. The cakes range somewhere between ice-cream and pastry, and they taste as yummy as they look. The plain vanilla flavoured pastry is my favourite, black forest is just heaven and the other flavours taste good too. The prize might seem a bit high but the taste would compensate it all. They have various types of biscuits and cookies which they sell on weighting, they are delicious too. Coming to the snacks, I personally don't like them; I don't find anything special with their taste and have often felt uneasy after having one.

One of the finest bakeries in the barasat area. Quality is very fine. It provides a great array of pastries and cookies. Never tried its cookies though. 
The pastries are too soft and too tasty. Very rich. Specially the strawberry one.
Looking forward to try its cookies.

Probably the best bakery in the area of Madhyamgram and Barasat. This provides a different type of bakery experience compared to the other cake outlets nearby. It is a live bakery and offers a variety of flavours and designs. Pastries are colourful and fresh. Price is affordable and gives value for money.

This place was an after school treat for us. The quality of the pastries are total yum! And so are the cakes. But when it comes to personlised cakes they lack the skill tremendously. You donot need to question the quality but you my not be satisfied with the appearance of it. 
Apart from this it is a nice pocket friendly place.

Vishal Pastry
 is one of the finest dessert parlour in the Madhyamgram area.Visited this place last day with one of my friend.It's a small outlet with varieties of pastry and cake.We have tried their Black forest and white forest pastry,both are decent in taste and toothsome.Red velvet pastry is amazingly tasty,highly recommended of them.Doraemon cake is beautifully decorated,it's little heavier but tasty.Ranges are pocket friendly and service is also fast.Visit this place if you are in that area.

One of the good n popular bakery in the area... Ambience was okish... Nothing special about décor... Staffs are efficient... Service was fast... 

The showcase was full of colourful pastries... I tried some of their snakes and the rainbow pastry... Both were decent nothing extraordinary... 

Pocket pinch is very friendly... 

Everyone can give it a try once...

Got a few stuffs packed from this place. Some assorted cookies, a few pastries and paneer sandwich. Cookies were fresh and likeable. Strawberry, chocolate, butterscotch pastries were good but I didn't like the pineapple. Need to tighten their laces to run in the competition.

Pastries were really good. But chicken lollypop and the pizza were not up to the mark. They should add one or two seating place in or outside the shop.

And Monginis may change to Mio Amore......
And people may queue up in front of flury's on Christmas eve.
But to me ..... this IS THE BEST BAKERY! Unbeatable.
Reasonably priced and amazing quality!!!!
Be it the cookies or the cakes .... they are all so fresh and tasty.
Hadn't been there for a long time !
Gotta visit soon!

In madhyamgram, there are many confectionaries, but Vishal Pastry will be in the top of them. Allthough the price is a bit higher compared to the others but the quality is much better, & there are many varieties too. Only this shop has live cake making  within 15 minutes & every day new designed cake. What I dont like is, they use too much mayonnaise in the veg & non veg items. rest is ok....the shop location is awesome, fully airconditioned chiiling weather will make u crazy.

This review is for those people who can't think anything about cakes and pastry without mio amore. "A collection of wonderful innovative eye attractive cakes"-that is called vishal pastry. The cakes and pastries taste as delicious as they look. You can also enjoy the live making of birthday cakes also. There are various flavour of cakes they have in their stock always not only chocolate flavoured like mio amore, sugar and spice and other big names. The price range is also pocket-friendly. By seeing some wonderful innovation of birthday cakes , you will wish to keep them in show case rather than eating. They have a stock of sandwich and burgers also. If you have a very few money in your pocket go for "chicken cheese ball". So for everyone living at and around madhyamgram , this place is highly recommended.

Awesome experience
The pastries are usually fluffy and soft, with fresh non-gluey cream. The cakes are of good variety. The cookies are good in taste and variety as well. Cold drinks and icecreams available too. The chicken kathi roll, chicken kulcha, pasta, chicken lollipop are really good. My favourites are chicken kathi roll, Germany marble pastry and the yummy black forest pastry.
