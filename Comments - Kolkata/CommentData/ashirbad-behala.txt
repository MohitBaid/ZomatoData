They used to be top notch a decade ago. But now, they are deplorable. Pathetic and stinky interiors. The walls and curtains smell of fungus. That's enough to drive anyone away from the doorstep. It's empty most of the times and service takes too long. Id suggest one to order their chinese food which is still okayish. They were one of the pioneers of chinese dining in Behala alongside Canton. It's sad to see the restaurant in such a bad state, given that I've spent a part of my childhood eating at this place atleast once a month.

Pathetic food.. My first order with zomato & food is not eatable. I ordered besan k gatte &  lachcha paratha & they gave besan k pakode ki sabji.. Lachcha paratha was the worse i ever had in my life. Shame on zomato to have tie ups with this restaurant.

Located opposite behala thana beside Sales Emporium electronic shop, this an eatery located in the basement.Didn't like their interior. Prices are high compared to the quality.Chinese is better than North Indian cuisines.

Tried their biryani, mixed fried rice, kashmiri chicken and chilli chicken...their biryani was pathetic, one of the worst l have ever tried...the chicken dishes were normal but the rice was good...ambience is ordinary...

Avoid this place like a plague. Unhygienic conditions as are found here, should be enough to force them to shut down. However, sadly that's not the case. They used to be really good at what they do, ages ago.but all that remains is the sad memory of it. Service is extremely slow, good quality is poor, can't come up with a single reason why anyone should visit this place.

They were very famous when there was no competition at behala. Now a days hardly anyone is there who would like to visit this place. It is really disappointing for the residents of behala to loose a good restaurant like ashirbaad.
