It is located bang on esplanade crossing...visited it with few of my friends and tried their chilly chicken, egg noodles and moghlai...coming to moghlai first the paratha of the moghlai was not fried properly and it was still raw here and there. Yes there was rush that day but still you cant serve raw and uncooked food! Chilli chicken was out of the world. It have not tasted a chilly chicken worse than this. I thought i needed a carnivore's teeth to tear the chicken! The egg noodle was just normal. All of the items were severely overpriced. Ambience is not worth mentioning. This is a joint which we all need to give it a miss.

This is one of the worst experiences I ever had in my whole dine line. Visited to this place on the Bengali New Year after watching a match in Eden Gardens with my friends. The place is situated beside the famous Anadi Cabin. The place is small, untidy and dirty. We ordered Chilli Chicken, Moghlai and Egg Noodles. None of the dishes were good. The noodles was an average one. The chicken was very chewy and weren't soft. The moghlai was disgusting and by far the worst mughlai I ever had. Foods are severely overpriced. Nothing to say about the ambience. There is nothing good about this place.

Long Long ago with my cousins i visited this place for an evening Â snacks after watching Match at the eden gardens. Its a very old cafe which lies at the esplanade crossing just opposite to big bazar. Though i didn't remembered the name of this place but today i got the name and surprisingly at zomato as well.
As mentioned above it was way back some years ago so don't remember the name of the dishes but yes the food was mediocre as i remember.

If you're here the first thing you should order is mughlai paratha and kosha mangsho. The taste is to die for. This place holds the old Kolkata feel. It is not fancy and not big on hygiene. But if you can ignore that you can enjoy some good food.

One of the very few places left that would remind you of the Old Calcutta Restro culture. The sound of the cutlery, the happy manager and the smell of the mughlai is something that is being fast replaced. It was during one of my aimless trip that I visited this place. Nothing fancy. Ordered a mughlai paratha and Mangsho Kosha. 
Food- Delicious, 
Price-ok. 
Ambiance-Nostalgic
Visit it,to meet Calcutta on a new era. Loved it.

Hyperpriced for that kind of eating place. Not worth spending so much, might as well go to a better and more happening eatery to eat food worth that money

Asking myself why I'm entered into this restaurant. Situated near esplanade metro station near big bazar. *note that ratings as per veg food and ambience only. non veg items ratings may vary. Well ambience was not well so as hospitality. Staff was not so friendly. They behaved rudely and always in hurry. Service was quick and presentation was ok. I tried veg chowmin which was costly as compare to taste and quality. It tastes disgusting. So not recommended to vegetarians at all. Non vegetarians may try because the smell of mughlai Cuisine was aromatic.

Three p's for this place. Pathetic place, Poor service, Pricey. I guess i summed it up very well. Do i need to say something more? If anybody who gives this place more than 4*, i guess he should be awarded a free meal from the cabin crew...ðŸ˜’

New Chowringhee Cabin is a small joint beside the legendary but out of charm Anadi Cabin has reasonably priced fast food on offer. The place is similar to any Esplanade style fast food center with old wooden furniture, not so sober ambience and hustle and bustle in it. However, the quality of food on offer isn't that great compared to similar outlets. A decent option for a roll on the go although there are plenty of options available in the area.

Disappointing.
A almost burned special moghlai porota with pumpkin potato curry costs Rs 60. 5 average pieces of chicken (with bone) in a thick curry, which is called Chicken Curry, costs Rs 180. Small chairs are also very uncomfortable.
So, the point is if you can spent around 250 bucks, you have several other options. Please don't waste your money in New Chowringhee Cabin.

pocket friendly place, amazingly good food!
Since am a Delhite, the cost of food here in the city comes as a welcome change to me. The rolls are just superb and have a right balance of flavour and suddenly am in love with this place's food
The quantity and quality are both amazing and would love to come back again,

A very humble place located near esplanade metro station. If you are feeling hungry on the go and wouldnt like huge pocket pinch, go grab a mughlai paratha with fish fry.. Pocket pinch around Rs 80

Last summer I visited New Market in the morning to strike a few cheap bargains on the roadside flee market outside the Oberoi Grand, and felt hungry. To my disappointment Anadiâ€™s Cabin was closed, it seems they open after noon, so I settled for this place, just next to Anadiâ€™s, with huge boards declaring its â€˜heritageâ€™ and reputation for â€˜special mughlai paranthasâ€™. I stepped inside the little eatery and ordered a mughlai. It arrived within a few minutes, and to my utter dismay, it was NOT the mughlai we know, but a huge omelet! I was dumbstruck first, but forcibly eat the whole as I was hungry, and after having such disgusting food stepped out of the sitting area only to pay Rs50+ for a large omelet, a huge tasteless and dull piece of omelet!!!  Disgusting to the say the least really. Stay away from this place friend- everything that glitters is NOT gold!
