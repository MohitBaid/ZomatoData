First time ordered food from here. The person at receptionist was very courteous.Ordered chicken tandoori , chicken biriyani , chili paneer and nan. Tandoori did not have that burnt clay flavour which usually tastes in most tandoori 's.Biriyani was scented which tasted like sweet pulao,egg was sort of half boiled. Chili paneer was ok. Nan was soft and melted in mouth . It has potential but need to focus on quality

It's a small place near airport. The place was all empty when we arrived. After checking the menu card we were scared to order food as the menu card had a lot of spelling errors. We gathered strength and placed the order though. We ordered a Chicken Manchow Soup and Mix Haka Noodle. The waiter was watching TV all the while. He came to write down the order but was not able to understand the basic order, finally he ticked marked it on the menu to show it in the kitchen. We got scared and straight away cancelled the soup not to take a chance. The noodles arrived and the quantity was like never ending, excessively excessive. The only veggies in the Noodle was cabbage and a lot of cabbage for meat it was hardly any Scrambled Egg so was the chicken or 2 to 3 pieces micro Prawns I guess. We some how had a bit of the noodles and left. Utter waste of money I.e Rs 140. Visit @ your own risk.....

Budget friendly and quality restaurant located near airport 2no.gate.The quality of the food served is the best in the price range. however, it's not very good but up to the mark. There is no other restaurant in this area where you can get hygienic and quality food in a good price range.

First of all I want to say that don't go by the resturant name as there is no food with meonis sause in it.Well the ambiance was good.place was small but beautifully decorated. The waiters were good and the service was fast. I must say that the American Choupsey I had is the best in kolkata. The price was little high but it's ok for good food. Overall it was a good experience.
