This is a nice and fairly spacious ice cream parlour at Elgin that serves from a different range of lip smacking treats. Mostly famous for it's offerings from the Chocolate section, this place also does provide various other choices from Fruits, Seasonal flavours and many others.
The Ice Creams in themselves were delicious and an absolute treat for us. They are also relatively pocket friendly, coming both in Small and Regular sizes.

What we had :-
1. Choco Lust
2. Mr. Brownie
3. Coffee Delight - must try
4. Cookies Delight - must try

Long story kept short, this is a great place and definitely a recommended one. We long to visit here again soon.

Located in Elgin Road, this ice cream palour is one of the best in town. They serve a wide variety of ice cream. From Seasonal Fruits to Dry fruits, from Signature fusions to Brownie name them and they will prepare it right in front of you. The ice cream was good. It was worth it. The best thing is its open till 2amüôà
Looking forward to visiting them again.

Icy fusion is really not easy to find.they should put more details about their address on zomato and along with a phone number.. Anyway it was painted pink like the 60s icecream van.. The walls have posters about their ice creams and funny quotes about them..We ordered Luvacious and Gems Bond.the first one is in large quantity and 2nd ine is in small amount.. Luvacious was basically browny with vanilla icecream chocolate sauce and chips with scone.i loved it brownie was full of hot melted chocolate and the ice cream tasted delicious along with it.himadri went for gems bond he is strawberry obsessed i ate little from it but it seemed ok to me.the gems were a good touch but the jelly cubes were so not.he liked it though.the stuffs were not attentive to the customers .they didn't offer any napkin and spoon when they handed the icecreams to us.. that should gave Large quantity ice cream in a bigger cup.cz the one that they gave made harder for me to eat it.price is high according to the quality.so here rating goes.

The place is small and quaint. They make the ice cream live as we all know it. 
Have had a few varieties and they never disappoint. 
One small is for one person and the bigger one can be shared by two. The price is reasonable considering the topping they give.
All in all it's a good place and open till quite late so you can go for late night ice cream here.

The quality of the ice creams are not at all good. Taste is ordinary.. overpriced. I tried their paan ice cream which tasted bitter,rose ice cream which was watery!!!!! The lavalicious was better though.

A very compact ice cream parlour for all the sweet tooth out there. Although it isn‚Äôt much spacious but it can easily host a group of four to five folks to sit n slurp.
I tried the pan flavoured ice cream and the  fruit n nut and I must say it tasted great. 
I was searching for a parlour which would serve nitrogen ice cream so ended up here and I was not disappointed.
**They don‚Äôt serve nitrogen ice-cream yet**

This place looks like something out of a children's story book. The ambiance is very candy land-ish and I love it. The ice creams are freshly made in front of your eyes and the choice of toppings is pampering. Service is also quick and efficient. 
This place can be heavy on your pocket but it's definitely worth it for a treat once in a while.

One of the icecream open late nights. A place to come to at a night out, or when I move out for a night drive. Love the fruit fusion here. I find it a bit over priced. The small ones which are rightly priced are too small. With number of other icecream options coming up, it has to lower or bring awesome combination. I hope they do the later to justify their prices.

Seriously would have loved had it had some decent seating options apart from the seating given at the counter. An ice cream over some conversation would be great

+ Easily accessible location.
+ Good Quality.
+ Pocket Friendly.
- Small Sitting Area.
- Don't accept Bank Cards.
+ Huge collection of some unique combinations of flavours.

We tasted :
Paan Fusion: when some flavoured icecream combines with the goodness of a fresh beetel leaf. The leaf is smashed and mixed with the icecream giving a strong flavour. One Must try!

Choco Blast : A chocolate flavoured icecream coupled with choco chips, liquid chocolate ..More chocolatey..Most chocolatey! 


Rush in here quickly if your an icecream lover, because they won't disaappoint you for sure!

A tiny ice cream parlour at Elgin, but comes up with a series of  mouth watering ice cream flavours. There is not much space to sit. We ordered for Lavacious, Ho and Co, Chocolate Sandwich and Bull's Eye. All were just awesome with warm brownie melting inside your mouth. Garnishing was also pretty attractive. A must visit for all ice cream fans.

chocoholics- was a very average shake, mixtured icecream with hersheys,, it tatsted motre like a fresh cream choco icecream than a chocoholic.... a big layer of fresh cream on top and minute garnishing, dats it...

mango fusion- the same happened with this ,, nothing new, tasteless shake with less icecream mixture and a fresh cream on top of it...this was more dull than chocoholic...

the icecream rates are too high and yes here fruit flavoured icecreams are too good but never tried.... will definately try next time....

It is a small parlor at Sarat Bose Road,Elgin. It is a small outlet which serves fusion ice creams.
We had Ferrero Fudge and Coffee Delight both of which were beautifully presented and tasted great.
You can actually mix and match various flavors to create your own or choose predetermined ones which is what is fusion.
The ferrero fudge was the best for me,it was topped with ferrero rocher and the quantity was good.
It is a little on the pricer side but if you want to try something different this place will not disappoint.
Highly recommended place will be back to try out other delights.

It is a nice joint for ice cream lovers. Inspired from Cream & Fudge of making ice cream by hand folding it on a marble stone with added ingredients to one's choice, this places lives up to its name. Located in Sarat Bose Road just opposite Masterjee, it has gained a lot of demand due to its mouth watering ice cream flavours mixture. The price is no doubt on the higher side but it is totally worth it. You can add extra ingredients to the fixed menu with added cost and have an amazing experience both while watching its making and while having it. Icy Fusion is a must try for Ice cream lovers.

I first got to hear about this place from our cousin and her husband who are regulars. After our dinner, by the time we reached there it was quite late, but there were still patrons; I saw many of them opting to order and have the ice-cream sitting in their cars....perhaps space crunch was the reason. Our group instead preferred to wait for our turn before we could sit on the sofas and relax. We ordered the Signature paan fusion ‚Äì ice-cream infused with paan leaves, and the Rose fusion ‚Äì with rose petals.....both were yummilious :P The Arabian Nights (with dates & nuts) & Chunky Munky (with caramel & praline) were also okay. The only drawback is the ear-splitting sound of the ice-cream getting crushed on a stone top....akin to the concept of the world-famous Cold Stone Creamery!

Wow! This is the perfect place to be at on a warm summers day.
We ordered a LAVALICIOUS and a CANDY CRUSH SAGA.
Lavalivious is most amazing icecream creation I've ever tasted anywhere in this city. The icecream base is made of chocolate icecream, vanilla icecream, oreo crumbs and choco chips. Above this a perfect circular shaped piece of lava cake is placed which is drizzled with some hot fudge. The hot and cold combo worked perfectly for me. I am overwhelmed by this one. Highly recommended. 
Candy crush Saga was chosen by my friend. The strawberry icecream was amazing in flavours but the jellybeans and gems are not particularly liked by me so I won't comment on that. 
Overall a great place to be at this Summer.

I ordered Lavacious -the one with a brownie on it
Amazing and the quantity was enough for two people.
My friend also ordered the oreo icecream, and they gave him extra chochochips on request so another star for that.
Quantity ‚úì
Quality ‚úì
Seating - It's a pretty small shop and it's better if you take your icecream outside and enjoy, they have tables outside too for the customer's convenience.

I will definitely visit again to enjoy another flavor!

Edit: Don't opt for home delivery
You'll be serverely disappointed.

Situated very close to the Sarat Bose Road and Elgin Road crossing this is one of the many ice cream parlours that have come up of late in the city. The ice creams here are a bit different from what you get at other conventional parlours like Swirls or Baskin Robins, but it tastes pretty good. Pricing is a bit on the higher side but considering the amounts of different stuffs they put in it is expected. There are a wide variety of different ice creams available and most of them are worth tasting.

This outlet is quite small and can accommodate hardly 5-6people at a time though they made one small arrangement to sit outside. Coming to the people who are managing this outlet the behaviour was rather cold. My cousin and i went there. They neither suggested anything nor made any warm conversations with us. We had to choose ourselves and gave them order to which they didnt asked if we require any extra toppings or not. We had ferrero fudge. The ice cream was good. I loved the taste of it. Quality was commendable. The price is a bit high.
I am giving this 4 just because of the quality of the food.

Located just opposite to St. John's Diocesan High School, Icy Fusion is a tad too small for enjoying a nice cup of ice cream for a large group. It is a nice place for groups of 2-3 but even then the absence of tables makes it a bit uncomfortable. But the ice cream was terrific. We had Lavacious and it was worth every rupee of it.

Came to this place while waiting for my friends yesterday in this area. This place specialises in serving creation ice creams, not just flavours. I couldn't eat a lot as I was awaiting a grand dinner. So it's a 3 till then I get to taste more flavours of their ice creams and creations. 
I was alone, hence I took a small scoop of caramel ice cream in a cup. The taste was good upholding perfect flavours of caramel. Still I think the consistency and the texture of the ice cream needs to be worked upon. Otherwise, I saw there were varieties of toppings and add ons which can actually create a great sundae. Need to try that very soon. Happy Dining! :)

Location: In Elgin road. Nearest landmark would be the dugout. Its situated next to aqua java cafe.

Interior designing: its really small. Outside, it got a small round table, few chairs where you can sit and enjoy your ice cream. Once you enter, there is a sofa and a counter. The menu looks attractive with a wide variety. Its really lively. Small but yet, cosy and on certain days, it could be really busy.

Food and service: it only offers ice cream and shakes. Unfortunately, i did not get any shakes tonight. But nevertheless, we ordered a small size of caramel and fruity punch. It was really nice.

I came to this place a lot of times, only to crave my mid night ice cream. Absolutely love it. Must visit this place.

Icy Fusion is a small store located in Sarat Bose Road, bang opposite the famous "Masterjee" store. It's usually frequented at night as most people can go here in their car, eat ice cream inside itself and leave. Ther service is fast as the waiters are always ready with the menu and are quick to get the ice cream as well.

I've always had their lavalicious which has a chocolate lava cake atop chocolate ice cream and it is heavenly, on my last visit I tried their candy crush saga and quite enjoyed it too.

Came to this place while waiting for my friends yesterday in this area. This place specialises in serving creation ice creams, not just flavours. I couldn't eat a lot as I was awaiting a grand dinner. So it's a 3 till then I get to taste more flavours of their ice creams and creations. 
I was alone, hence I took a small scoop of caramel ice cream in a cup. The taste was good upholding perfect flavours of caramel. Still I think the consistency and the texture of the ice cream needs to be worked upon. Otherwise, I saw there were varieties of toppings and add ons which can actually create a great sundae. Need to try that very soon. Happy Dining! :)

Location: In Elgin road. Nearest landmark would be the dugout. Its situated next to aqua java cafe.

Interior designing: its really small. Outside, it got a small round table, few chairs where you can sit and enjoy your ice cream. Once you enter, there is a sofa and a counter. The menu looks attractive with a wide variety. Its really lively. Small but yet, cosy and on certain days, it could be really busy.

Food and service: it only offers ice cream and shakes. Unfortunately, i did not get any shakes tonight. But nevertheless, we ordered a small size of caramel and fruity punch. It was really nice.

I came to this place a lot of times, only to crave my mid night ice cream. Absolutely love it. Must visit this place.

Icy Fusion is a small store located in Sarat Bose Road, bang opposite the famous "Masterjee" store. It's usually frequented at night as most people can go here in their car, eat ice cream inside itself and leave. Ther service is fast as the waiters are always ready with the menu and are quick to get the ice cream as well.

I've always had their lavalicious which has a chocolate lava cake atop chocolate ice cream and it is heavenly, on my last visit I tried their candy crush saga and quite enjoyed it too. 

Good Ice cream, decent prices, quick service, overall win - win.

Icy Fusion is one of my favourite places to have ice cream from.

On my first time here, I chose a Fruity Fusion. I was very disappointed as I expected a variety of fresh fruits in the ice cream. But there was hardly any exotic fruit! No kiwi.. no cherry.. nothing! The pieces were so small and so less, I could hardly identify which fruit it was.

Gave a visit for the first time but it's worth for more visits surely.Its easily located on the opposite side of Bhawanipore College on the main road. Though less sitting accommodation but it's cozy! The love for chocolate was no less anyday and this place will surely make one crave for more icecreams. The service is good so as the decor. Affordablly priced.

Definitely my favourite ice cream parlor. DEFINITELY. First of all the way they prepare the scoop. I actually drool everytime. I have tried almost all their options but Coffee delight stood out everytime. Maybe because of my eternal love for coffee or whatsoever. This particular branch is always filled with people. The shop is a bit congested but who cares as long as there's coffee delight. For everyone who have this place on their wishlist, just go. Rush.

Great setup, good interiors, decent seating space for an ice cream store, delicious ice cream. So why the poor rating you ask? Read on. 
I went to Icy Fusion New Alipore last evening, after a meal of snacks with my boyfriend. We ordered a Nutella Ferrero, which is what we regularly order at their Laketown store as well. The ice cream itself was nice but I feel that the lake town outlet is more generous with the nutella. But maybe thats just me. It was made live and served fast. There are two comfortable couches and few chairs where you can sit and eat your ice cream served in a waffle cup. 
But when you go to a restaurant/ice cream parlor/eatery, that too of the likes of an Icy Fusion you expect better things. 
The owners (or managers) were continuously speaking to each other in a a very loud volume, as if we weren't even there!! They were talking about getting things fixed here and there and other administrative things which I have no interest in! Why should a customer get to know what fixtures need to be done in your outlet the next morning and how much is to be paid for it??? It got so loud that at one point we (on a date) wanted to step outside to finish our ice cream. It was very annoying and disappointing. Firstly, admins should not be discussing their managerial issues infront of customers, that too in an obnoxiously high volume. And secondly, given the fact that it's a new place and I understand that discussions are bound to happen, so it can be done in a discreet way, in a lower volume instead of shouting, giggling, mocking or simply talking loudly enough to make you customer cringe with discomfort. Or else why open doors when you are not even ready? Service and behaviour is of paramount importance for any place and while the servers here did their job wel, it were the managers/owners/admins who truly disappointed me and this is not expected from Icy Fusion.

Finally I get a chance to write a review!! It's been a while since I have written about any new place that I wanted to visit. Since I am now off to an ice cream tasting spree, I have started with Icy Fusion. I just ordered a Candy Crush and it was DELICIOUS. I absolutely loved it!! It was very well made and presented. Though the base was simply strawberry and Vanilla ice cream, it was the different surprises incorporated in every bite that made it extra special!! I can't wait to be back soon but first I have got some other places to try out too! So stay tuned :P and Happy Dining!

It was a sudden decision that made us travel in the middle of the night to have ice cream.
And it was delicious
Fererro fudge was nutty , chocolaty n delicious.
While candy crush saga was sweet , sweet and well sweet!!
They really FUSE things man!....
The inside is a bit cramped up n I expected a table n some better chairs...

Well, I got lucky while I was visiting a neighbour‚Äôs marriage party and saw an Icy Fusion counter @ the desserts stall. Was initially a bit hesitant as my experiences with their Lake Town as well as Sector 5 branches have been pretty ordinary. Nevertheless, decided to try out their stuff as that was the only scoop serving section of the entire party!

I started off with their Choco blast ‚Äì which was chocolate ice cream grinded with choco chips, crunchies, cake and chocolate sauce ‚Äì just the perfect dessert ‚Äì it made my day. Believe me when I say that I had 3 scoops of the same. This was followed by Chunky Munky sundae, which was nothing but dry fruits mixed with caramel and butter scotch ice creams ‚Äì which was fine, good but not great ‚Äì as I am not a caramel lover. Finally, the royal ending came with the Paan fusion, when real paan was mixed with vanilla ice cream and ‚Äúsundaed‚Äù to perfection ‚Äì ohhhh, people could start eating this sundae instead of real paans.

Food presentation was sober and service was exceptional ‚Äì and on inquiry, I was informed that they operate out of Sarat Bose Road. You guys definitely deserve a 4.5 on zomato and more visits in the future. Cheers!

Had heard of icy fusion for long and wanted to try it,  so this I time attacked their outlet at Elgin, which is near to Forum courtyard. Tried Ferrero fudge which was an absolute treat and was served in a chocolate waffle, also tried caramel crunch, which was quite delicious as I always find caramel tempting. Though felt a little disappointed at not finding blue bliss, but finally settled for a black temptation shake. A must try for ice-cream lovers. üç¶

This place is situated just about 5 minutes from my home so it's not a surprise that I have visited it like a thousand times already! I absolutely love the ice creams that they offer, and trust me when I say this, I have had ALL the ice cream that they have on their menu, and most of them are pretty pretty good. Although the place is really really really tiny, even when 3-4 people are standing or even sitting inside for that matter, you feel that the place is crowded, and the AC starts feeling like a heater. You have the option to munch on the ice creams outside the shop, but even that is limited to like 4 people. However I have no complaints from it, as the ice cream pretty much makes up for it! My favorites? Umm let me see, Mr. Brownie, Lavacious (ofc), Paan fusion (Oh my it's amazing), Candy crush (pls don't judge meüòõ), and make one yourself thing where you get to select two base of ice creams, and upto 5 toppings to give you that personal ice cream that you have always craved!
Quick tip: Can't decide on one? Lavacious is the way to go. üòâ

The place is too small but nicely decorated in pink along with different kinds of posters. And not to forget the chocolates, nutella, perk and all. The ice creams tastes amazing and mouth watering. It's good to see the way they make it too. Loved the place. Will visit again for sure.

As an ice cream lover I'm very particular about the ice cream I eat. Visiting Icy Fusion was very interesting, I entered to have a simple scoop of Vanilla ice cream as I didn't expect much from it. But they surprised me by saying they don't have basis flavors and I have to choose from the menu. Me being a Oreo fan, I went for an Oreo sunday. And they started all the chopping and mixing of ingredients. It was really entertaining to watch them make my ice cream. Since then I'm a loyal customer of Icy Fusion and I've brought everyone I know here and tried almost all the flavors they offer.
Must Try : Oreo Sunday, Chunky Monkey and Rocher Sunday.

Icy fusion brings a change in the icecream parlor trend we had in kolkata which was very different from those in other cities. Its growing popularity can be seen as there are more outlets being opened in the city so soon.The variety it caters to can be seen by its customers of different age group.It has become a favourite family place.You can see how your favourite icecream sundae is being prepared loaded with nuts or fruits or chocolates as it has a live display counter.Though a small joint it is mostly full.I ve tasted just two of its varieties Mr.brownie and Coffee delight and am looking forward to try all of its icecream one by one.The icecream leaves you wanting for more and more each time,so delicious those are.A must visit parlor for everyone-even if you are not an icecream lover,you shall become once you try their icecream!!

Ice creams and shakes were good but not great and the place was too small. They advertise that ¬†seating is available but it is not big enough to accommodate more than 6-7 people.
Service was not so fast even though thay had around 5 people working.
Price is comparatively low. U can seat outside if u want but only on solid seating arrangements or can be called their boundary, but then that too is only possible during winter and very few people like to taste ice cream during that time.

Because my parents love paan, I decided to take them to Icy Fusion to try out their Paan Flavour Fusion ice cream. It came in a waffle sitting inside a cup, with tiny chunks of shredded pan in rose flavoured ice cream. Don't get me wrong - it was pretty good, and had it been the first Paan based ice-cream (or any food) I had, I would have been blown out of my senses. 

Unfortunately, the Calcutta food scene has been over-saturated with everything Paan for a while and every restaurant seems to have incorporated something Paan Based in their menu. So, after having had the Paan Shots at The Factory Outlet, Paan Mocktail at KK's Fusion, Paan Sherbat at Paddnaparer Rannaghor and Paan ice-cream at Pabrai's, I wasn't that impressed with the Paan Fusion at Icy Fusion. 

However, if anything Paan is still a novel unknown taste for you, you could try this out ! 

Icy Fusion is a pocket friendly place, and since it's summer already, I intend to go back and try out a few more flavours.

I don't see what the fuss about this place is all about... Firstly, they don't serve any single flavoured ice creams - you have to have a combo of flavours or a sundae. The flavours are also just there . Nothing so spectacularly good. One has to be a regular there and try all the flavours as to navigate between the good combinations and the below par ones.

Little Pink icecream parlour, the mixing of different flavours on cold stone with nuts & fresh fruits is getting hit among everyone.
My fave here is Choco Blast, the pan fusion and fruit fusion... total recommended!

The icecream fusions they serve are just mind blowing. We tried 'oh-my-rio' that is a fusion of vanilla and oreo biscuits with chocochips and chocolate sauce, and Candy crush saga fusion which is a fusion of strawberry icecream with gems and jellies. Loved it to the core. You can't have just one. Highly recommended.

Went there for our late night craving for ice cream and yaa it didn't disappoint us. Tried for the first time. It is a joint situated close to the forum mall which serves varieties of ice cream fusions. We ordered one Arabian delights regular and one Fruit fusion. Fruit fusion should increase its range of fruits given in it. Arabian delights was good. It's a good place if you are a true ice cream lover. There are lots of things on the menu. Wanna try something different next time ‚ò∫

Located just a few minutes away from Forum in Elgin. There ample of places which serve Gelato and I have been in a few. The innovative feature of Icy Fusion is stated in its shop name itself it has intriguing Gelato fusions. That's about it in good points as I won't be going in too much detail about the ambiance or the interiors as it's Gelato serving shop and not a restaurant. The Gelato's taste can be improved just a tiny bit other that it was average experience with not too many dissatisfactory points other than a particular Gelato flavour which my friend had ordered which was supposed be like a Macedonia (mix of various fruits) but it tasted like a antibiotic syrup with a hint of lichi.

If I am ever craving a delicious ice cream I know I can always count on Icy Fusion!! It never disappoints!!¬†

I went with a Candy Crush Saga!! And yes it was a saga alright. Not only was it delicious it was in pretty good quantity. They served it with two giant scoops of vanilla and strawberry ice cream and then topped it off with gems, jelly, jujubes, choco chips, chocolate/strawberry sticks and crushes. It was literally the most amazing blend I had ever had. We also had our own fusion prepared as per our wish‚Ä¶in which you can choose on any 5 toppings that you wanna add to your gelato. It was pretty darn good. I think I'm going to have to get the Alphonso Divine or Bull‚Äôs Eye next time. They have so many flavours and combinations to choose from which makes it pretty hard to decide.

It's one of the most fun places I've been to in a while. Will surely visit again soon.

The sitting space in this outlet is not much, they really need to expand it more but apart from this talking about there ice creams  they really deserve 5star* i tried #Ferrero fudge which was just amazing and also the paan fusion for which they are really famous for! I really like the way they serve the ice creams in a waffle flower bowl and also talking about their quantity which is enough to share. Best place for the ice creams lovers ! it's a good place to enjoy deserts ! A place to visit again !

Extremely recommendable as it's the only place that serves you in the car. Summers or monsoons, this place is a respite from the heat and a day of hardwork. Ferraro fudge, Choco blast are my favourites. Though I have heard the paan flavour IceCream is also great. 

I don't mind paying their premium pricing, just  too heavenly and satisfying. Request suggestions from you if you come here anytime soon. 

Locationally it's very strategically placed making footfalls more frequent and in volumes. The area is small inside, recommend staying outside or be in the car.

It is currently one of the most happening place in Calcutta. The Ice creams are not served as normal scoops or sundaes as it is served in other ice cream parlours  but they actually mix it superbly with the toppings and that's what make this place class apart... I tried the ferrero rocher topping sundae and it was filled with nuts and chocolates. Though the place is very small in size so it gets crowded on Sundays but on a weekday it is a must visit ice cream parlour. 
Do witness the way they mix the Ice cream with the toppings cause it is actually interesting...

Location: Easily identifiable, Beside Tea Trove,Lansdowne

Ambience: Small but Cozy . gets crowded on Weekends and Evenings. Suggestion,to put up chairs and a setup outside the outlet as there is ample of space.

Ice Creams: Yes, YUMMY. I had ordered 'Lavacious' as we were too full after a Mongolian lunch. You will love how Ice cream is beaten and whipped with ice to create that 'Fusion' . Lavacious had ice cream topped with hot Fudge cake and Boy! It was yummy. On top of that there were loads of choco chips and chocolate sauce. Really tasty. Don't miss this place!

On same stretch if the road just two shop besides Pabrai's... Icy Fusion is rivalling well with the others there.

USP here use of real fruits and condiments and smashing them in with the ice cream infront of your eyes. If u order say Rose ice cream then real rose petals will be smashed and grinded and then mixed wid the vanilla ice cream base to form the flavour.

So try out the other specialy the nutty ones.. Each taste diff and unique and worth trying all. 

Special review alert.. Try the Lavalicious ice cream. Awesome. ;)

Well I went there last Sunday .
It was very famous and I was recommended by many to go And taste the ice-cream there.  
 The ambience was ok .
Awesome quality of ice cream .
Humble staff members .

What I ordered:- 
Lavacious - A very gelatinous and chocolaty ice cream having a mix of chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream , fudge sauce , chocolate chips . Plus it has a warm cupcake served over the ice cream topped which fudge sauce which makes the ice cream sinful.
Choco blast - A very chocolaty mix of 2 scoops of chocolate ice cream , brownie , fudge sauce and chocolaty chips . It was nothing but a bit same as lavacious . But it lacked that hot cake as that of lavacious.

Over all - Sinful ice creams . Good blends . This place is a must try.

Icy Fusion: The one stop shop for Ice Cream Fusions.
=====
Intro + Location: Icy fusion is located right beside Tea Trove Elgin Road and offers various fusions of ice creams. I had been in this area today and had been hearing a lot about their paan fusion ice cream from a couple of my friends. For this reason, i decided to give this place a try. This place is quite small but is well organised and decor is just simple yet mesmerising. I liked the way they serve the ice creams in their crunchy flower like bowl. They have a place to sit which can accommodate around 7-8 people. The ceilings have been filled with quotes and somehow the place has been utilised to the full. After looking at the way the ice cream maker preparing the ice cream by twirling around the steel sticks to make an ice cream paste, i got really excited to give it a try. :P I came here with one my friend.
=====
Ice Cream Tried:¬†

1) Forest Drive - We ordered for a litchi one but due to unavailability we decided to try this one. It tasted moderately nice until the paan fusion arrived. The paan fusion took away it's charm. Serving with a crunchy stick and a cherry was an icing on the cake.¬†

2) Paan Fusion - This was too good. The funniest part was the ice cream makers discussing who is going to get a paan from nearby shop. :P Nevertheless, they really fused paan well with the ice cream and it did taste AWESOME. Served with a crunchy stick on a crunchy bowl.¬†
=====
Ice Cream for two: it costed us around 220 bucks. It would cost near about that only for two people.¬†
=====
Pros:

1) Location is prime.
2) Service is moderately fast.
3) Staffs are courteous in offerings.
4) Place has been utilised to the full and also to the benefits of the customers so that they can sit.¬†

Cons:
1) The place gets too much noisy when the ice cream makers bang on the steel sticks on the frozen top.¬†
2) Need to keep on updating offers in order to survive in the competition.¬†
=====
Summary:

Ice Cream Quality 4/5
Ice Cream Quantity 3.8/5
Taste 4/5
Hygiene 4/5
Ambience 3.7/5
Value for money 3.9/5
=====
Expert Suggestions:
1) More offers on the menu for the customers is a mandate.
2) As the name is icy fusion, one can keep on experimenting more ice creams and make more combinations.¬†
=====
Conclusion: A good place to enjoy ice creams. I would come back and try other fusions as well. :)

This ice cream had made me try paan version of ice cream at various other places. 
Till low icy fusion is the leader. 

If you like PAAN a lot you must try Paan fusion at this place. 

Best part about this place it's open it 12 midnight or late and even on weekdays. The staff is very friendly and will the get order to you car.

The rating is only for the fruit icecream flavours which are fresh to taste! Specially blueberry..the ferrero fudge was nice too..
This place is a small parlour ..bright n nice with colourful wall graffiti..
The biggest disappointment because of which I have rated it this low was the noise pollution which was unbearable! This isn't the first cold stone icecream parlour in town! And i must say among all my visits to cold stones across the globe, this has been the worst experience! 
The amount of noise in that small place they made to make an icecream jus for 1 client was unbearable and we were forced to leave immediately after our order so that we could patiently wait for our order outside the store! 
A horrible experience only due to the extreme noise which will hurt ur ears and break your night peace !üòì something ought to improve seriously!!

The final piece in the jigsaw before calling it a day. Icy Fusion is a night-owl located at Sarat Bose Road near Dugout. The menu comprises of a sublime collection of ice-creams and fusions ranging from sumptuous chocolate delights to fruity amazements to kids' melt-in-mouths. Although I found the seating arrangement very weird and displeasing, the ambience has the kind of coziness that demands adherence to the sweet tooth! The orders were instantly forged by beating a steel against another and intermingling work with pleasant music. We ordered Choco Blast and Rose Petals, both of which were prepared to perfection! The rosy fusion was a maiden experience, much to the delight of my taste buds. I'm looking forward to trying further offerings and I'm almost certain to experience the divinity of an Icy Fusion frozen delight at the dying embers of their hours.

Icy Fusion is located opposite the Masterjee store in Sarat Bose Road. I've been going here ever since it opened as I am a fan of cold stone ice cream creations having had them at various parts of the world. They have a great variety of ice cream creation flavors ranging from fruits and nuts to obviously chocolate. I absolutely love the Paan Fusion, Lavacious and Chunky Monkey!The staff is courteous and the ice creams are very well priced for the drama you get to see in front of your eyes!Pocket Pinch : 150 per person.

After reading uncountable favorable reviews about this outlet it was inevitable for me to drop by this place and I finally did today.
Locating this joint was a walk in the park, situated just beside the bhawanipore outlet of "tea trove" and just opposite to "Dugout".
This little treasure trove, though quite crampy when it comes to spaciousness but the intellectually done interiors, the hue of pink all over the place, various posters with delectable quotes about ice cream, series of bell jars filled with lucrative- gems, jelly beans, candies, magic poppers, wafers, chocolates etc; barricading the counter; definitely makes the complete ambience worth triggering your sweet tooth to cloud 9.
Despite being a small outlet, they still managed to provide a decent amount of sitting accommodation, comprising of a couch and a couple of bar stools, a table and couple of stools are also provided on the porches which caters your desire for enjoying your cup of sundae under the open sky.
Coming to their offerings- your heart goes gaga while going through their  massively versatile menu. Their dense list of variety has sundaes that can satisfy every kind of taste buds out there. One can realize the herculean amount of creativity and culinary expertise one has put into setting up these rich menu.
They have a tailor made cup of sundae for every age group, ranging from sundaes like- nutella ferrero, Mr.Brownie, ferrero fudge, oh my Rio etc; all these chocolate based sundaes can hypnodize the tastebuds of every Chocaholic out there any time of the day; variety of fresh as well as dry FRUIT based items like- freezing Fig, litchi lich, fruit fusion, chunky munky, nuts of fruits, caramel craze etc; are more than enough to satisfy your quench for fruity frozen fantacies; and of course the series of out of the world and unorhodox fusion sundaes, improvised and served with perfection like- Rose Petal, Paan Fusion, jelly juggle, Vitaddict, Candy Crush Saga, gems bond etc; are also undoubtedly unmatchable and worth dying for.
I was pretty confused and was down with horns of a dilemma while selecting my sundae, after 10-15 minutes of intense confusion I finally settled with "Candy Crush Saga", my order took around 3-5 minutes to get ready and in the meanwhile as it was mentioned by most of the fellow foodies in their reviews I got to experience those exuberant and intensifying noise of the ice cream being beaten hard on the frozen granite slab in order to mix and blend it with the other ingredients. 
My "Candy Crush Saga" looked damn addictive, generous scoop of strawberry ice cream blended with heavenly amount of jelly beans, gems, jujubes, strawberry stick and served over freshly baked waffle and dolloped with inticing crushes. 
Ahh!! It was hell of a thing and I can bet that this version of "Candy Crush Saga" would turn out to be more addictive than the game installed in your android device.
It was damn succumbing and left me craving for more.
No doubt "Icy Fusion" is one of its kind, perhaps the only ice cream parlour in town serving such a wide variety of succumbing and enticing sundaes with such perfection.
The staffs operating in this joint are very efficient and performs their job with sheer perfection and perseverance. No doubt the level of success which "Icy Fusion" has managed to achieve, wouldn't have been possible without the team of  their dedicated and hard working staffs who really puts in a lot effort in delivering our orders with a smile and perfection.
"Icy Fusion" a dreamland for pampering your sweet tooth and worth revisiting uncountable number of times.

Went there on a surprisingly quiet friday evening. Well I was pretty much shocked to see chakerberia so quiet and so peaceful. Growing up there I always remember the noise and people.
Well talking about the dessert. It located right at the junction where every car or bike takes a "u-turn" towards lansdowne.

The place is quiet small with an outdoor seating arrangement which is awesome. It gives a cozy sitting experience and the first hand view of the chef taking her "blades" out and preparing the ice-cream. Well I ordered the magic pop ice cream from the "kid's zone" in the menu and it was fabulous.
There are not many such ice-cream parlors in kolkata, but icy fusion is the best I have experienced here. Hands down the best ice cream i have had here.

The most awesomest ice cream parlor in town till date. Moreover, the best thing about this place is that it is open till late night. SO when the entire city is asleep, we foodies can have a munch on our fav icies. They have an awesome variety of flavours. I specially loved the seasonal mango delight. The crowd at the place is very nice.
Once you enter the shop, ur mouth will go watery seeing the candies lined up.¬†
An awesome place to visit with friends/family.

Finally a proper ice cream parlour on the heart of the city. Located just beside The Tea Trove on Sarat Bose Road Icy Fusion has gained quite a popularity in a short span. So had to visit this place for an icy date. and am impressed with their variety.All the candy crush game lovers will be delighted to know they have a dessert based on the game and its look fantastic.I just wished it had proper seating arrangements so that one can spend more time there and explore the varieties.P.S:The sound of beating the ice cream can be very ¬†annoying. Beware !! Other wise a thumbs up!!Cheers!!

Although personally I am not a great ice-cream fan but visited the place last Sunday with my family.
They have got an interesting way of preparing their ice-creams where ¬†scoops of normal ice-creams ¬†are beaten hard along with other ingredients which could even include a whole mishti paan in case of the paan flavoured ice-cream until the flavours are all fused together. ¬†Added to this are nuts, choco-chips, gems etc and the whole thing served on a freshly prepared waffle placed on a cup.
Looks wise the end product was great. Texture was smooth and creamy and the nuts and other embellishments enhanced the flavour.¬†
We tried the cruncy munchy and the choco blast and both were good especially the cruncy munchy.
Would surely visit again in future.

Want to pamper your taste buds and indulge in sweet temptations? Hit Icy Fusion today! What a splendid place it is. Located at bhawanipore, this pretty ice cream parlour looks like one of those very colourful candy houses we read about in our childhood. They specialise in making a plethora of fusions with ice creams, cookies, jellies and candies. I am a choco-freak hence I loved the 'choco blast' which had dollops of chocolate ice cream with
Choco chips and brownies. Another similar fusion was 'Mr Brownie' which was equally beautiful. One should definitely try the 'Gems Bond' which is as colourful and pretty as it sounds. It has vanilla ice cream loaded with strawberry jelly and gems! This can be a perfect ice cream for the kids. 'Candy crush saga' is huge and loaded with ice cream, jelly, jejubes which was a treat both to the eyes and to the taste buds. Price is reasonable with prompt staff. Icy Fusion is a sinful place I tell you. So bunk your gym regime for the day when you plan to hit this place as you will end up digging in more than just one ice cream. ;)

A small and colorful place with lots of choices in the menu. The ice-cream is decent. And on the positive note, it is open till 2am (for all the night owls). Only thing that sucks is the excessive noise they make while making your fused ice-cream, while you are inside.
I had a Nuts Over Fruits, which I really liked. The fruit fusions are pretty good. And the chocolate one's as well. You can make your own fusion, too. And there is a Pan Fusion ice-cream, which I didn't really try but was intrigued. Leave a comment if anyone tried that.

And I finally did visit Icy fusion. I was craving to visit this experimental ice cream parlour ever since ages. Was around minto park and yeah , it was immensely hot. So thought of dropping in. It is just located near chakraberia petrol pump. 
A small cute colour pink place. On entering all I could comment by looking at the decor was "aww.. cho chweet"

The pink glittery lights. The laid out bell jars containing wafers, choco sticks, gems, magic pops, juju bees, jelly beans gave me a feeling that I had definitely entered "Willie Wonka's Chocolate Factory". 
The amazingly cute graffitis. The amazing quotes about ice cream but help an ice cream lover fall in love with the place.

Since I am huge fan of strawberry , I asked them what should I order. They suggested me to go for any candy flavoured stuff. They suggestred candy crush saga. But since it was two scoops and I wanted a single scoop,  they suggested me to go in for GEMS BOND.
and soon started off the fusion. I could just hear sound of ingredients being beaten into pieces for an effective mix and match. 
And finally it arrived,  it was vanilla ice cream mixed with strawberry jelly,  choco chips and crushed gems. The scoop was laid on a waffle which was beautifully carved out and topped with gems. May I not comment on the taste?  It was heavenly. Gave a feel of ecstasy to the taste buds. This taste is gonna be cherished and celebrated for quite a long time. 

I could not resist myself from having a second go although I was nearly filled. Now this time they suggested me to go in for PAN FUSION. the staff soon returned with two paans and the mixology started off again. This time it was paan mixed with rose ice cream. This was amazingly beautiful.  The aroma of pan and rose, the refreshing taste of pan bonded with the rose ice cream just created a magic with the taste and my taste buds could not have craved for more and more of it.

Prices are decent.

 In a world full of newness, experimental food is the new in. Mix and match is the only resort to strive the trial and error.  What better, if the trial and error leads to the best of the food? 

Undoubtedly the best ice cream parlour of Calcutta. Guys cheers!  And no doubt that I am coming back soon to try the other mixes.

Cheers team Icy Fusion, amazing job!@

Nothing beats the heat better than ice cream. And now that ice cream has come in a new seductive look holding the hands of Icy Fusion. A little joint with ice cream written all over, interior coloured in strawberry, dark Choco n vanilla, Icy Fusion is there to make your heart skip a beat as you wait for your tryst with a forest drive. A rose petal strewn path that leads on to a Choco blast is all that we all 'been waiting for. And to please our traditional "bangali" tongue, while re-vamping the look, there is Paan Fusion. A fusion to remember. 
Icy Fusion has delivered. It has delivered "loud" and clear!

Our first destination was pabrai but they had a power cut and asked us to come back at least half an hour later so we hit icy fusion. It's a small place with provision for hardly 7 people. The decor is sweet and pink.
The menu's range was very impressive.
They make their own wafers and you can actually see them making it. Those are delicious; fresh and crispy.
We had the bulls eye sundae and nutella ferrero. The bulls eye comes in a huge proportion and is very filling. Half your lunch is done if you have one full bulls eye. And it's super yum with the vanilla and chocolate ice cream, choco chips, hot chocolate sauce- a mix of hot and cold.
The nutella ferrero is light and delicious. But then how can anything having nutella can not be delicious.
The service is prompt and friendly.
I just wish that they would increase their sitting provisions and give some tables may be, so that people can spend more time (and money) there.

To be honest, I wasnt very enthusiastic about this joint until lately I heard people raving a bit. This is indeed a new concept in the city (apart from Cream and Fudge Factory)
So, one fine night decided to try out this joint with a friend. We were done eating and were having a sweet tooth craving so we haulted here.
Ordered, Chunky Money( friend's choice) and Mr. Brownie (my choice)
The making of the whole dessert is pretty repelling as they slap the ice cream with the ingridients. Hurtful to the ears though, be happy for when it arrives for they give a choco stick with it, which I love.
Mr. Brownie was pretty good. It is vanilla ice cream mixed with a brownie, sprinkled with chocolate chips and chocolate syrup i guess. Yep, calorific intake is indeed *burrrp* high! It tasted really good and I would definitely try it again.¬†

PS : It was raining while I was returning so it was quite a chilly affair! :D

The prices arent exorbitant. The maximum would be INR 200/-, not more.
Pocket friendly, yes.

Am I coming back? Yes
Soon.

Cheers! :)

On a late Saturday night we visited this place and were extremely disappointed. Their way of making the ice cream, the stone way, is extremely repelling to the ears. We ordered for a litchi litch and it was extremely average. With the opening of a new place you expect something different but there is nothing unique about this place. Prices are reasonable.

Lovely new ice cream place. They serve 'stone' ice cream which you don't often find. They are tasty and can give Naturals a fair competition.¬†

I tried the anjeer flavour and loved it. Also had a bite of the mango which was amazing.¬†

Inside the parlour, they beat the ice cream which creates a lot of noise. This was terrible as the noise was very loud and incessant. We decided to sit outside but this cannot always be done on hot summer days. Thankfully, the weather was okay the day we visited.¬†

That apart, loved it. Do try this place, as it is a kind of ice cream parlour we needed hear in Kolkata.

The¬†Only place to get super premium ice-cream at the best rates... Only in kolkata
¬†The place, ambiance, location is amazing and its the only late night ice cream parlor in Kolkata which is open till 2am.¬†Candy crush saga(which is a current favorite) and newly added Caramel Brownie must be tasted.

Unusual..people who love ice cream and sundae's must visit this place.. The sundaes taste good but not excellent.. They are different I can say.. They are experimenting with the new ones which is good... 
The parlour is too small for which when they are preparing on the ice table it feels like u r in a construction site!! Which is fun sometimes ( not for peace lovers though)..
Would like to visit and try other flavours again..

The place is conveniently located but the the name suggests a whole lot more than just an ice cream sundae. We were surprised to know they only had the sundaes like they do in cream n fudge and other such places. Tried the Nutella Ferrero. It was good but not as good as expected from the place. Decor is cute but place is small.

best ice cream centre in town.
Icy Fusion, an ice-cream parlor opened its doors to its customers a couple of weeks back with a different style of serving them i.e. the frozen-slab technique. This trend is one of its own kind in Kolkata and a very few places serve ice-creams this way. In this technique, the servers utilize a frozen granite slab upon which the ice-cream and ‚Äòmix-ins‚Äô (read: ingredients) are mixed together. Ice-cream scoops and trapezoid-shaped hand tools are used to mix all the ingredients into the ice-cream on order. This mix-in (read: mixing) process tends to soften the ice-cream and infuses the flavors of all ingredients together.

‚Ä¢ A MUST VISIT for everyone. :)

It has slowly become a regular dessert haunt for my post-dinner family plans all thanks to the delicious creations it serves!
‚Ä¢ A MUST VISIT for everyone. :)

Icy Fusion suffers a space constraint, yet the space has been well-utilized. The AMBIANCE here, is simple with a sofa and a small wall-side table with two high chairs on one side and the counter on the other. They also have a stand-n-eat arrangement for a couple of heads outside their parlor on the artificial grass flooring. The catchy quotes on the wall and ceiling was a plus to the ambiance.
This places in totality lacks seating arrangements which would be problem during times of high footfall and being on the main road, parking is also a problem.

‚Ä¢ In totality, the detailed review of the fare covers 98% of their current menu. Happy eating!

RECOMMENDATION LIST (based on all visits):
- Alphanso Divine
- Mr. Brownie
- Strawberry Love
- Candy Crush Saga (for kids)
- Oh-My-Rio
- Nuts over Fruits
- Pan Fusion
- Bull's Eye
- Chunky Munky

Coming to the detailed insight of their FARE, they only serve mix-ins and their well-drafted menu have a number of combinations on offer. Until now, the following has been sampled:

- Pan Fusion
It was absolutely delicious!!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for people who love Pan and others should give it a try. :)
Rose-flavored & Vanilla ice-cream mixed-in with Magai Pan.

- Oh-My-Rio (Oreo Biscuit Ice-cream)
Oreo biscuits, Cho Cho sticks, Choco Chips, Perk and Chocolate Sauce mixed-in With Vanilla ice-cream.
Served with an Oreo biscuit and Cho Cho stick on top. The ice-cream tasted amazing!
Highly recommended.

- Ferrero Fudge
Chocolate ice-cream mixed in with Ferrero Rocher chocolates, chocolate sauce, Choco chips and Cho Cho sticks. Served with a Ferrero Rocher Chocolate and Cho Cho stick on top.

- Litchi Litch
Vanilla ice-cream mixed in with fresh litchis. The amount of litchis put in was less. Could have been a little more. Served with a strawberry-flavored stick on top. Tasted just about average, the flavor somehow didn't make it up to the mark. Disappointed. Scope of improvement.

- Choco Blast
Was great to taste, yet couldn't stand to Oh-My-Rio.
Chocolate ice-cream mixed-in with choco chips, chocolate pastry, cho cho sticks and chocolate fudge sauce.

- Strawberry Love
Fresh strawberries mixed-in with strawberry and vanilla ice-creams. Served with a topping of Strawberry-flavored wafer stick and fresh strawberries.

- Candy Crush Saga
The kids would absolutely love it!
Strawberry Ice-cream mixed-in with choco chips, jellies, gems, jujubes, & cho cho sticks. The jujubes are hard and might stick to your teeth, but, the flavors are great.
Recommended for kids as well as adults who are a child within! ;)

- Nuts over Fruits
Amazing. Assorted dry fruits and freshly-cut fruits (apple and pineapple) mixed-in with ice-cream.
Recommended.

- Alphanso Divine
Mango season isn't a season if fresh mango ice-creams arrant relished upon!
This creation had a mix-in of fresh pulpy alphanso ice-cream and mango syrup/crush in the usual mango ice-cream.
Served with a topping of freshly-cut pulpy mangoes.
Tasted good. Had a nice balance of sweetness and didn't touch the extra sweet mark.
Recommended for mango lovers, others can surely give it a try.

- Mr. Brownie
A simple not so exceptional, yet, delicious mix-in. Tasted Good.
Vanilla ice-cream mixed in with soft and sweet nutty brownies.
Although did miss a topping a small piece of brownie. Was served with a Chocolate flavored cho-cho stick.

- Bull's Eye
This was a sundae which comprised of two scoops of ice-cream (vanilla and chocolate) on a bed of warm microwaved brownie and a topping of generous hot chocolate fudge sauce!
Did surely miss choco chips in the same.
Served with a chocolate cho-cho stick. Was decent to taste.
The brownie on being reheated lost the bite it should have had. Refrain from reheating the brownie, the hot chocolate fudge does the trick you wish for. :)

- What the Fudge?
This too was a sundae and comprised of a scoop of vanilla ice-cream topped with chopped cashew nuts and hot chocolate fudge sauce.
Tasted good.
Served with a chocolate cho-cho stick.

- Chunky Munky
Butter Scothch & Caramel Ice-cream mixed-in along with caramel crunchies and roasted nuts. Tasted delicious. The mix-in did not have an impact on the crunchiness of the nuts.

- Lavacious
Chocolate and Vanilla flavored ice-cream mixed in with choco chips & hot chocolate fudge sauce served with a hot lava cake on top. Delicious it was. However, the cake was found to be slightly dry.

- Caramel Craze
Caramel flavored ice-cream mixed in with caramel sauce, roasted nuts and brownie crumbs. Not much different from the Chunky Munky yet, nice to taste. Would prefer Chunky Munky over this.

The STAFF was polite and courteous who processed orders at a quick SPEED.
PRICES were found to be reasonable.

‚Ä¢ All ice-creams were served in a shallow-bottomed waffle bowl.
‚Ä¢ They also have the ‚ÄúMake your Own‚Äù ice-cream @INR 180. Your choice of toppings mixed in your choice of ice-cream.
‚Ä¢ A major POSITIVE for ice-cream lovers, it is open until late hours (read: till 2am). Happy me. :)
‚Ä¢ They have also started in-car services i.e. they would serve in your cars. Yet to avail the facility.

Overall was a good experience.
-¬† Hope the negatives are looked upon and the quality is kept constant. A long way to go.

To be frank Kolkata was missing something despite being a sweet capital of India ,guess what? It was missing a good late-night eating hangout and Icy-fusion have intelligently filled that segment. This one is way ahead of all the existing ice-cream parlours in Kolkata mainly because of the three main reasons. Firstly because of its unique concept of stone ice-cream which is new to Kolkata, Secondly of its location which is near to Elgin and forum mall which is easily traceable, and Thirdly because of the beautiful innovative outlet that these guys have put up, its very colourful and pleasant. One more thing I would like to add which adds up to this is their presentation of making ice-cream in a different way by smashing the main core ice-cream and mixing it with different stuffs is very eye catching. Coming to taste all I can say after having a ferrero rocher ice-cream is Fabulous. Special mention Mr. Ashish who seems to have put a lot of effort with his team in gifting this concept to Kolkata. Thumbs up and best wishes.

Hi Kolkata!  
Yesterday  I  went  to the  shop ICY FUSION  and  had awesome time there. Have  you ever  seen anyone
 chopping  ice-cream?  I'm  sure  you haven't.  These people  offer some exotic flavors.  Just decide  your order and they will prepare it right  in front  of u.  You  must be  wondering what am I  saying.  Preparing  chopping! !!!???? Then go and see yourself  and you'll understand. They have yum ice-cream which I am  sure you haven't  had as yet. So go and  give it a try for the sake of your  taste - buds because  they also need a change. Right . All the best  to Icyfusion  m may you keep providing all7 ice-cream  lovers like me with your super  yummy  stuff.
