Went for dinner to Guchhi last night and had the most horrible experience. On a Saturday night there were only two tables occupied and despite that they could not serve properly. further if you think of complaining / demanding better service be prepared to be insulted by their Manager 'Asif'

Guchhi used to be our favourite place for Indian food..... really sad to have had such a demeaning experience.

DO NOT GO THERE

I took me years to visit Guchhi because of negetive feedback that I had received regarding the food. Hyatt's Event Sales Manager....Mr. Subhasish Majumdar convinced me to try the food and then judge. He assured me that I would not return disappointed. Right he was!! Visited Guchhi on 4th Nov'17 with friends and family. We were a group of 10 with mixed prefernces. To start with...we ordered Paneer Tikka ...Malai Broccoli....Tandoori Aloo and Fish Irani. The food was fresh and flavourful. The serving was decent. The main course comprised of Yellow Dal Tadka....Dal Makhni....Spinach Malai Kofta and Tandoori Fish Masala. The breads were assorted....Kulchas...Naans and Parathas. Everything served was excellent but the Dal Makhni and Spinach Malai kofta stood out. Yesterday's experience ensures that Gucchi has us hooked for times to come! A word of caution....though the staff was warm....the service was very very slow. The hotel management must ensure that service speed improves soon.

Amazing food... Have been there quite a few times now.. consistency of flavour every time. Good ambience.. very well trained staff.. Overall very good fine dining experience.
Must have-
Seekh kabab ( though the menu on Zomato doesn't have that, it's the in the menu)
Mutton Rogan Josh ( won't find mutton better cooked)
And the Guchhi dal.

One of the best fine dining places in Kolkata and among my personal favourites... The food quality, service and ambience is so great that you would enjoy yourself thoroughly!

Miss some of the old signature dishes (which are no longer in the menu), but the new menu has some great new offerings. Definitely worth an occasional visit now and again.

P.S. Like all other five star and above restaurants, this one's a little heavy on the pockets.

An awesome place with very good service and excellent food. Being vegetarians , We ordered paneer tikka, tandoori aloo and broccoli for the starters and all were amazing except for the paneer tikka which was a bit bland. For main course we had dal makhani , paneer butter masala , mushrooms etc and all were too good. We had a lot of desserts too which were all just awesome. We got a complimentary cake too since it was our parent's anniversary.

My entire rating is for the management and the very finely trained staff.
Everyone was very polite n well mannered .
The chefs were humble n available.
The food was good too , although there was not much variety in non veg . The non veg menu needs an upgrade and the quality of the meat, be it chicken mutton or beef, needs improvement, so -1 for that.
Overall had a really good time.

This has been on my bucket list for quite some time. Finally visited the famed "Guchhi" on my birthday to get a feel of Hyatt experience with my family. We ordered Raan-e-Sikandari and Sizzler Prawn for starters, along with Long Island Ice tea and Fruit punch as beverages. Both were equally delicious, but they should increase the number of prawn pieces in accordance with the price the dish commands. For the main course, we went for butter naans, paratha, Gosht Biryani, the signature "Guchhi daal" and Murgh Lababdar. Needless to say, all were equally delectable and toothsome. Particularly, the aroma of the daal and succulent juicy pieces of chicken lababdar made it worth the wait. Our deserts included Rasmalai and Coconut flavoured kulfi, both of which didn't live up to my expectations. The minimalist decor and the excellent service leaves no room for complaints.

Overall a very memorable experience.

Visited last Tuesday with a big group on a client dinner. The place was empty when we started. Minimal decoration but gives you that plush feeling. The service was great. Among the food the mutton and prawn dishes were star of the show. Since I didn't place the order I don't know there names but you can order blindly and you'll be satisfied. They cook each dish with care and perfection. Even the clients coming from outside india were thoroughly impressed. 
Reserving 0.5 for my next visit when I can try the desserts üòä

We went to Guchhi - Hyatt Regency, yesterday at 1.30 a.m. All we wanted was to chat over some cocktails, but we had to keep slapping the air around us for the mayhem created by mosquitos. Despite telling the management for no less than 5-6 times they were not able to get rid of the problem. We ordered 2 margheritas, 1 mohito and 1 shirley's temple which were well made, however when we asked for regular water, the water that was served tasted nothing better than tap water. Overall, it did,in no way feel like a five star facility. If the restaurant is open at night for service, then I think care should be taken about the surroundings as well as the promptness of service.

Been there for an event.

Location: Just beside the Waterside Cafe in the Ground Floor.
Ambience: Excellent. The decorations, the alignment of buffet, lighting everything is perfect. You will be able to feel the traditional touch in every corner.

Service: Just Spectacular. Curtsey, Behavior is just excellent. I was amazed to see that even the Clearance of plates, was so prompt even in high rush.

Food:
1) Plating and Presentation of buffet is very attractive. The buffet spread is also very good.
2) I was very happy with the taste of the food. Each of them was warm. I have eaten so much of things that I am not able to remember the name of the items. But one thing that stole my mind was the Chilla. It was so so good.
3)Desserts are the star of the show. I have not eaten better desserts than this ever before . All of them were so amazing that you have to taste it. Basically I am not a true fan of desserts. But people like me also was so compelled to concentrate on the desserts from the beginning.

Overall Experience: Superb

Hands down, one of the best places to dine in the city of joy. Personally I like this restaurant more than the rest in Hyatt. You can reach this by taking the stairs that leads you downstairs, located on the right side after entering the lobby. The decor isnt something magnificient. It is located by the swimming pool. But the black glass hinders your view. The options available at the buffet is too long to be listed here. Keeping it short, all the items are well cooked and tastes delicious. The best part is the dessert. And there's a wide variety of sweets and pastries you can choose from. The staffs are quite professional. They will ensure that you have a lovely evening out here. Being a 7 star hotel, I shouldn't be commenting about the price üòú

I visited here yesterday in Ashtami along with a friend for lunch. Well given its a restaurant in "Hyatt" its unnecessary to talk about or act surprised by the price(a single naan being 250rs)  :p
But what was really unnerving was the wait! We waited for 50mins for a simple naan & chicken butter masala. I mean seriously! There wasn't even a rush. What's the hype about being a 5-star restaurant if you can't serve food in time! 
Now coming to the food.. well of course it was yum..but the quantity was an utter disappointment. 4pieces of chicken for a 1199rs butter masala.!!!  You have a God people?? Hahaha.

Visited this place during the Pujas, 2016. The ambiance is classy and the staff are very courteous. The food here tastes amazing. We ordered Gosht Pudina Shorba, Makhmali Boti and Murg Tikka Butter Masala. The shorba, is a broth, it was light and decent to taste. Both the Makhmali Boti(Mutton Biriyani) and the Murg Tikka Butter Masala tasted amazing. The mutton and chicken pieces used were tender, the biriyani was fragrant and the quantities were huge.

The only suggestion I have for them is that they can consider increasing the number of options in their menu a bit. Apart from that, everything was 5 star quality. Cheers!!

I visited Guchhi, the North Indian/Mughlai restaurant of Hyatt Regency, Kolkata on the second day (17th September) of the Restaurant Week India (RWI).

It was a three course prix fixe menu consisting of a starter, a main dish, daal, rice/naan and a dessert for Rs. 900+tax per person. I was there in a group of four, so we could order four different dishes of each course, which covered pretty much the full available menu.

Our reservation was at 10 PM, but we reached early, at 9:35 PM. The restaurant was in the ground level. We were greeted at the restaurant gate by a young lady and she showed us our table.
The first thing that caught my attention was the size of the square table. It was quite small for four persons, probably less than a meter on each side. They didn't use any table linens to match the decor of the restaurant; wooden flooring and floor to ceiling high glass walls. The dark-brown color edges of the table were peeling off, showing the lack of maintenance. There were arrays of red Chinese lanterns hanging from the high ceiling. It looked amazing but I couldn't relate Mughlai cuisine to Chinese lanterns. May be the designer was unsure about the cuisine of the restaurant.

Initially they thought us as regular guests and handed over their regular one page menu card. Then I informed them that we were from RWI and requested the RWI menu. I noticed the inconsistency of spellings of the same word in the menu card.

We ordered the starters and the main dishes quickly because the menu was known to us. They served a basket of assorted roasted papads, chutney and pickle. From that point an endless wait started. The lady who took the order and another guy who looked at us suspiciously throughout the evening came to our table couple of times and assured that our starters were being prepared!

The first platter of the starter was served at 10:17 PM.

We ordered for¬†Afghani chicken tikka, Zafrani makhmali murgh tikka, Raan-e-Sikandari and Lashooni mahi tikka.

Afghani chicken tikka and Zafrani makhmali murgh tikka were soft, succulent and very tasty. However, both were little under cooked, had a pink-ish color inside and both tasted pretty much similar with an aftertaste of ginger on the palate.

The Lashooni mahi tikka was fabulous! It was so soft, flavorful and tasty that it seemed to be cooked in Sous-vide.

The last starter, Raan-e-Sikandari did not match the taste of the other dishes. It was not as tasty or aromatic as the kebabs.

Once we were done with our starters our endless wait continued...

The main dishes were served at 10:55 PM. We ordered for Dal Guchhi (it was supposed to be included in the menu. Still, we mentioned it specifically),¬†Mohe wala murgh, Murgh tikka masala, Kadhai fish masala, Kareli gosht, rice and Garlic Naans.

The Dal Guchhi was never served. They simply ignored it.

The thick gravy of the Mohe wala murgh, Murgh tikka masala and Kadhai fish masala tasted similar, may be with some very subtle difference. The boneless mutton chunks of the Kareli gosht were rubbery. I could not gulp down the pieces because it was more like chewing gum. The Garlic Naan were circular in shape, looked more like rotis with some chopped garlic on top than Naans. The rice was well-cooked basmati. All the dishes were adequate in amount.

Our endless wait continued...

While we were waiting for our desserts to come, I noticed that all the servers were very busy in serving other, non-RWI guests.¬†No one even bothered to fill-up the glasses with water until we asked couple of times.

Our endless wait continued...

They started switching off the lights after other guests left the restaurant. No one bothered to say us anything about it... because we were not their esteemed "regular" guests. We were still waiting for our desserts. Myself, my wife, our two years old daughter and my parents, both senior citizens.

The restaurant was supposed to be closed at 11:30 but till then we were waiting for our desserts... We could not find anyone to ask, so we went to their open kitchen to know that status of the order. They said that it's the Kheer which was taking time to prepare. But it was just an excuse, we understood that shortly. Within 30 seconds they served our desserts, at around 11:32 PM -¬†Rose Kulfi, Gulab Jamun, Rasmalai and Shahi Tukda. No Kheer was served, which was taking time to be prepared!¬†It was very evident that all the desserts were ready to be served, but they kept us waiting intentionally to fulfill some other agenda. No one bothered to apologize for the unprecedented delay;¬† presumably because it was intentional.

All the desserts were very average in taste and all were served in dinner plates! I have never seen this before...desserts being served in dinner plates. Just imagine... when the Rose Kulfi gets melted how inconvenient it would be to eat (or drink) the pink-colored liquid from the dinner plate with a small dessert spoon.

During the whole two hours water drops were falling on me in a slow and steady pace from the ceiling.

While the starters of Guchhi were quite good, almost comparable to the outstanding kebabs of Peshawri of ITC, the main dishes need some serious attention.

Secondly, Guchhi should find a better way to serve desserts ‚Äì dinner plates are not designed for dessert.

Thirdly, they should call there maintenance guys to fix the leaks in the ceiling.

And lastly, Hyatt Regency, Kolkata should stop participating in RWI. Because differential treatment is a serious violation of ethics and it is dishonorable. As far as I know, Ms. Britta Leick-Milde already completed her tenure in Kolkata. I am hopeful that the next General Manager will look into the concerns and will address it.

Food Taste - 3.5/5 (Average)
Service - 1/5 (Poor)
Ambiance & D√©cor - 4/5 (Good)
********************
OVERALL - 2.8/5
(Below average when compared to other five star North Indian/Mughlai restaurants of Kolkata)

It's September, so it's Restaurant Week India once again. A time of the year when one can try out ¬†a few fine dining places across the city or revisit some old favorites without burning a huge whole in the pocket. I chose to try out Gucchi, the Indian fine dining restaurant at Hyatt.¬†

The decor of this place is modern and it exudes a quiet elegance. The service is warm and friendly. But the quality of the food doesn't quite live up to 5-star standards. The Afghani Chicken Tikka and Lahsooni Mahi Tikka as starters were good. Both the chicken and fish were soft and juicy with the right blend of spices. But the meal mostly went downhill from that point on. The Raan was bit too dry for my liking and charred at places. Both the Kareli Gosht and Kadai Fish Masala were too spicy and tasted similar. At restaurants like these one expects a far more sophisticated cooking style where the chefs use much less spice and oil compared to the run of the mill joints without compromising on the taste. Here there was too much spice and also the blend doesn't quite feel right with everything a bit too sour. ¬†Among the desserts, only the Kulfi stood out, while both the Sahi tukda and the Kheer lacked that wow factor.

One expects a lot more from restaurants like these which command such ¬†premium prices. Guchhi does not quite live up to such high expectations.

Update from the lunch on 5th August 2017:-

We were invited for a Kashmiri food festival. The usual kashmiri spread with Rishta/ Gushtava/ Tabak Maaz and Kashmiri pulao was there. The interesting part was, there was one wazwan thali, both in veg and non-veg variant. So, if any single person or couple comes and are in the mood of tasting many otems, this might be the actual choice. The dessert, Sufta, was heavily laden with dry fruits and is recommenced.¬†

Update from 2016:-

                        The place is merely 5 minutes drive from our place and the drive was a breeze. The decor was top notch and so was the service. We were given a royal treatment (but all the patrons are treated like that only here) and the special menu was given to us. Now, I won‚Äôt disappoint you with all the options here, but we chose Murg Makhmali Kebab (suggested by the server) and Raan-E-Sikandari (I had to take this) as starter. And those who may visit this place, I‚Äôd suggest ot to miss the Raan. The portion size is huge for each of the items and 1 Raan can easily be divided among 3 persons. Regarding the taste, though the Raan was the champ of the meal, chicken Makhmali Kebab was extremely soft, yet properly cooked with just the right tinge of smoky flavor. And what portion size- my goodness‚Ä¶

After gulping down all of the above with some chilled coke and puffing like anything, we ordered the main course. It was Kadahi Fish and Kareli Gosht with lachha parantha and Garlic Naan. Frankly, for me, mutton always overpowers fish and it was no different here. Though with a little extra bit of kasuri methi, fish was interesting on its own, we fall or rather dipped in love with the mutton. soft shanks, cooked for long till its soft enough to leave the bone with the touch of the fork, it was something else. It was pure orgasm and definitely recommended. and, I was saving the best for the last. Somehow I‚Äôve seen, apart from 1-2 restaurants in Kolkata, somehow, standalone joints can;t make a good Kali Daal and Guchhi (trust me) is a stalwart in that. So, go for the Dal. even if you have to sacrifice the main course, I‚Äôd suggest, go for it.

And, finally the dessert time. Frankly, I am not a sweet-tooth guy. But the Shahi Tukda is good here. A little extra soft to my taste, but good however. Rose Kulfi looked different and was scooped out like icecream and served on a bed of Falooda without the syrup.

Regal interiors, lovely ambience, extremely fine service and wonderful food defines Guchhi!
¬†I have never had such good mutton, so soft and so succulent. My little sister had been with us, aged 7 and the mutton was so tender and soft that even she was gladly having her food without any qualms.
The kebabs languidly melted in our mouths, the flavour being rich and longlasting!
Another applause to the manager who had arranged for black tea for my grandmum even though it was not on the menu that night.
We had a special dessert, their own personally made Kulfi with organically grown fruit extracts.¬†

However, the prawn sagged a bit, seemed under cooked! ¬†Also the gentleman serving us mixed the vegetarian for non -vegetarian and had served a wrong soup, though being alerted on time had stopped from any problems further!

Well to start with the ambience. .it's good ..soothing calm.. perfect for dining in quiet without much crowd or disturbance. 
Coming to food part.. the food was simply outstanding.  Each and every dish which we ordered was perfectly cooked and served hot and fresh. Their special dal makhani is a must try .and do keep some space for deserts ..ands their shahi tukhara is mind blowing. It simply melts in mouth. 
Service was good but I would say quiet slow. Few things were disappointing. .when we were seated .. after water being served ..they forget to give us menu card.. we waited for 10 mins then I had to ask for it . Little werid.  Even the food came little late. So little slow Serivce.  They can improve on it ! 
Other than that a good dining experience.

The guchhi dal is the best dish here. The service was on the slower side but on the whole the food experience was good. The price is on the steeper side but worth it.

I have attended a banquet at this place. It was really great place to hangout with friends, it looks rich and posh and service is amazing at every point you will have some staff to help you. Food was amazing I had vegetarian it was good, not too spicy but tasty and salads were very tasty, the most delicious item which you want to taste is baked rasagulla.

A nice place to be with Family or Friend. Nice ambience, good atmosphere. BUT, the main purpose for which one will visit the Resto was indeed not satisfied. Yes, I am talking about the food. Ordinary or below par you can say. No taste whatsoever. I wonder what are they doing to their repute.. Simply disgusting, the food was.
Strict no-no for foodies...

According to me this is the best place in town for having north Indian foods or having a romantic dating... just awesome awesome and awesome.... starting from there hospitality, service, ambience up to there food all are insane.... I am in love with this place.... no doubt it's a very expensive place but it worth it... don't forget to have there staffed cheese kulcha and murgh tikka butter masala... although I think each and every food you have there will be awesome.... so just go for it...

Tandoori guchhi... I can drool over it. Amritsari kulcha, veggies, paneer tikka and many more.. Way too good. Great ambience, outstanding food. Service can be improved though.

Still agree that the service needs to be improved, felt they were understaffed. Mitch pyaaz kulcha is unavoidable, club it with guchhi daal and lemon and it's just wow!!!

Amazing food. The food was so light and tasty. Cooked at very less oil, felt great after eating it. The festival is just for a week, one should visit before it's over. 

Amritsari paneer burji:: till date the best I have had.

Hyatt - Gucchi : the best of Kebabs 
Starting from the Afghani fish tikka , the murgh tikkas and the Dal makhani with Garlic naan ; definitely among the best s tasted .... To top it all some punjabi music on the background ( though i am not very fond of it ) but it was nice everyone dressed up in patiala and suits . 
Of course , the food was at its best -the best punjabi food in town üëå

Went there for a dinner a few months back. The experience was overall nice. I remember having afghani chicken tikkas, jafrani sheek kebabs, roti and daal along with a few drinks. There was nothing to complain about. The service was extremely good and marked with politeness. The open kitchens fanned our appetites.

We had booked the Guchhi restaurant to celebrate my son's annaprason ceremony on a Sunday earlier this month. I'm trying to summarise our experience and how much satisfied I am on behalf of all the guests that we put faith on them.
Apart form the location & lovely layout, the ambience inside Guchhi is grand due to the spacious dining room, cheerful interiors and eye-catching high glass walls overlooking beautiful landscape garden, fountain and vast green space, add to that instrumental Rabindrasangeet playing in the background all day.

The restaurant at Guchhi is where Chef Partha and co. make sure you come back for more, to make it complete is the great service from Mr Ashif and team who managed the whole event and their efforts to make my day special was worth mentioning. They customised my party exactly as I wanted making sure that every detail is taken care of, from table orientation, overall decoration to setting of buffet in a way that suits more than 100 guests.¬†We finalised the menu beforehand after discussing with Mr Ashif and Chef Partha who are so knowledgeable about their cuisine.¬†
The starters are undoubtedly one of the best in town, innovative and mouth-watering - Machher nonta Malpua, Murgir Patisapta and Narkeler Bada along with the supremely refreshing welcome drinks - Gondhoraj Ghol and Aam Porar Sharbat. The waiters kept serving small portions at a time and kept coming back to offer us more, they were attentive and courteous.
Main spread has a good variety and again the menu shows keenness for innovation from Chef Partha - Postor bada, Mochar Ghonto, Macher matha diye chochori, Potoler Dorma, Pabda macher jhal, Posto Murgi, Sonali Moong dal, Kaju kismis Polao and heavenly Kasha Pathar Mangso, Loochi - also sides as chutney, papad and salad to go along. All-in all a mini carnival for the taste buds, all dishes had so authentic flavour and meats were so perfectly cooked and succulent that they melted in the mouth.
Dining should not end without their legendary Rose Kulfi, Payes and misti doi which are a must-try and add to that Rasogolla, langcha, Sandes (all sweets from renowned Balaram Mallick).

Overall I must say, Guchhi@Hyatt is the best place in Kolkata to organise an event ahead of other 5-star peers, or suggest you to pop in on a Sunday when Bengali buffet is on offer. Ever-so-friendly hospitable staffs with personal touch will give you a feel of home away from home.

Rest is for you to visit and experience yourself.

The place is nice otherwise though nothing spectacular... But it usually pinches your pocket a toddy but in case you decide to hog

Guchhi at Hyatt Regency is one of its own kind. The well designed restaurant has its own ambience with the great ceilings and French windows allowing natural light to set the mood. Additionally the silk drapes adds to the beauty. Being a 5 star the staff was obviously very courteous.
Onto the food, the Kandahari Murgh, Tandoori bharwan Aloo were just so tasty.
Guchhi Cheese Nan was just out of the world since I'm a cheese lover.

Ambience is excellent. Pleasantly lit restaurant, hushed conversation, smell of spices wafting from an open kitchen counter of kebabs and breads; all very conducive to a sexy dinner.

Food is pretty exciting. The restaurant infuses indian food with it's namesake, the gucchi mushroom. It is a slightly salty, very earthy mushroom. Not at all a taste one would normally associate with indian cuisine, but the marriage works well. 

Service was the only letdown. Chipped wine glasses had to be sent back (shouldn't there be a pre-service check?), and our margaritas were missing their usual salt rims. Water took far too long in coming, and asking for chilled water takes even longer.

The birthday cake was also from them and it was awesome. Out of blue I would never forget to mention the same we ordered for one of my vegetarian guest and when I tried undoubtedly it was the best of lot. Ambience is awesome with a lawn sidebar where you can play with your kids while others enjoy the food. The manager Amit was very cordial and the services were 7 star.

Well, when you are in Hyatt, you don't really keep a watch on your wallet. The food is good but the service is slow and poor. Like the ambience in and around the restaurant area. There's a bakery alongside incase you crave for a sweet dish. It's a 3.0 for me because of the poor service. Elsewise, give it a try :)

I have mixed reviews about this place. So I'll divide it up in parts:

Food:

1. Tandoori Guchhi: Very well done and my parents loved it. But I'd have liked the stuffing to have some zing (not sure how to explain it) in it to counter the overly rich sweetness.

2. Kandahari Murgh: Lovely kebab and perfectly done. The amount of pomegranate in it was just perfect and not sweet at all. I am assuming that it is Kandahari and not Kandhari as the spelling says.

3. Guchhi Pulao: I liked it but my parents did not. I loved the fact that the flavour of the guchhi was accentuated and not diminished by adding too much spice. What I didn't like was the quality of the rice. It wasn't fragrant and was very much broken, which to me is a sign of lower quality of rice.

4. Gucchi Dal: AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!

5. Murgh Handi Laziz: Again very good.

Service:

This was really sub par for a 5 star restaurant. I literally had to call the servers for everything. As expected with such service, I left them no tip at all!

Ambience: Brilliant and at par with a 5 star signature restaurant.

Price: 4350 after a corporate discount of 25% and really VFM.

Recommended dish: Guchhi dal.

Decided to kick start this pujo celebration on this year'ss Chaturthi with friends and family and can't be a better option than Gucchi for their traditional Bengali Sunday brunch and that too pujo special menu!! Our reservation was in place and private dining table was booked for us. Interiors are top notch with 5 stars impression at all corners. At the center of the restaurant live kitchen counter will drag your attention too. We were greeted by Gondhoraj Lebur Ghol and Fresh Lime soda. Ghol is nothing but traditional bong lassi with lime essence but not as thick as lassi.In starters there was Topse Fish fry, Narkel er bora, Peyaji and Egg Chop. In starters two things found unique were one was Narkel er bora and other was their designer starter plate.
Main had huge array of food starting from pulao, luchi, mocha, beguni, hilsa, chicken, mutton, etc.¬†Desserts has traditional Bengali sweets and of course my favorite rose kulfi. Lunch ended with benarasi paan.
On request they prepared special mocktails for us. Overall, thoroughly impressed with their food, presentation and courteous staff. Enough options are there for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.

Dining in Guchhi was an outstanding experience which would remain etched in our memories for ever as the food offered,overall ambiance,decor and hospitality was incredible.We went there to have authentic Indian food with superb flavors having excellent quality.

As soon as we entered the Guchhi restaurant we were very warmly attended by a staff there and were guided to a table according to our choice. The table had a floating candle at the centre with fine quality of cutlery.

The restaurant had an open Live wide kitchen with very artistically decorated items.There were spices/vegetables like garlic, bell peppers hanging in strands in the corners which gave the kitchen a very unique look. We had an opportunity to watch the chefs cooking right in front of us without bothering us with the reek of strong spices.They had excellent strong smoke management system in the kitchen thus it was a delight watching them cook. 

We directly had¬† our main course which included Guchhi Dal which was finely cooked black dal having a very thick texture.It really went well with¬† Guchhi Pulao that we ordered.The breads they served had an amazing taste which was cooked in pure ghee.The aroma , texture and taste was just 'PERFECT'. We had Warkhi Paratha and Makhmali Nan.I just loved Makhmali Naan as it had a very slight sweet filling inside which actually melted in mouth and was really amazing.

We had Chatpata Tikha Guchhi which had a quite tangy flavor.The Guchhi mushrooms used in the said preparation is one of its kind and is very expensive, which is available in only selected regions.Along with it we had Murgh Handi Laziz which had boneless chicken prepared in thick tomato gravy , onion, cashews and had a bland taste.The portion size was reasonably good and the food was served beautifully by the well trained staff.

For dessert we had Shahi Tukda which mainly comprised of bread fried, dipped in sugar syrup with rabri spread over it.I found it too sweet with a dominant flavour(smell) of oil/ghee in which it was fried.
Overall we had an awesome outing at a Grand place with a good value for food and hospitality.The food quality was superb and had excellent & adequate flavors of all the spices prepared in most authentic way.

Located in Hyatt Regency, Guchhi offers authentic indian food, all prepared to perfection, in an awesome ambiance.

Firstly the decor is classy with huge towering window panes adding a feel of spaciousness, grandeur. The seats are well spread out to give you adequate privacy. The staff are very polite, warm and prompt which is a given in ¬†my opinion. The prices are pretty much on lines with Taj, ITC, maybe a bit reasonable !!

Coming to food, they have a decent menu, all of which are a delight to have but ones with flavour of saffron are my preferred ones. The kebab platter is great with dahi ke kebab, zaffrani paneer tikka being my favorites. I love their lucknowi naan. ¬†Daal guchhi is probably one of the best black dals in city. They have a zaffrani panner preparation for the main course which is not always available but amazing, otherwise i love their paneer gulistani. Shahi tukda is great for the dessert.

Overall they truly deliver an outstanding dining experience, second only to Taj in the city in my opinion.

‚ÄúNawab chalein gaye par lazeez nawabi zaikey chodh gaye‚Äù----Anonymous (Hindi)



I dine here quite often either sit-down or I take away, mostly for dinner because its close to my place. I must say the food and ambience is just simply awesome. The food sets you to trance.¬†
Guchhi is the most expensive variety of edible mushroom/morel grown only in the himalayas in the valley and needless to say the menu has plenty of Guchhi creation. Guchhi is probably the best mushroom I have tasted so far. 

Coming to the ambience, it‚Äôs really one of a kind in the city with a backdrop of a live wide kitchen. The whole setting figuratively acts like an appetizer for the food marvels created here.
I am more of a Guchhi Dal and Tandoor Breads guy but over the years have tasted a lot of their specialties. 


A few of them are listed below



Guchhi Dal: I like it so much that I vouch that there isn‚Äôt any dal in Kolkata which can be compared to this but I must say here that Dal Bukhara of Bukhara, ITC Maurya, Delhi is hands down the best in the country. Dal Guchhi is this creamy black lentil creation that just make you go ummm‚Ä¶¬†

Guchhi Pulao: This is pulao cooked with the guchhi morels, elaichi, ghee and probably other very light yet aromatic spices ¬†which I am not sure of but this is just simplicity at its best. The guchhi does wonders to the rice and the chef is never shy of adding tons of it in the pulao. It is so simple that you will be taken aback by the aroma and flavours it has within. It has absolutely limited spices and tastes best with creamy gravies.¬†

Lucknowi Nalli Nihari: The word nihari derives from the word nihar which means morning or after sunrise and this basically is the ghost that you have with bread for breakfast. The taste is not at all heavy on spices and the nalli/bone has very little flesh clinging to it. I have never had nihari, nihar muh but I know it‚Äôs a ritual to have it for breakfast in the adjoining restaurants near Jama masjid. I cannot have a day better if I start it off with Nihari for sure. Guchhi‚Äôs nihari is really good and a must try for Awadhi food aficionados.

Kareli Ghost: The first thing you will notice are these succulent goodness just melts in your mouth. You have it with the warki parantha and you call it a day. A perfect bachelor pampering. ¬†¬†

Zafrani Seekh Kebab: Very soft with saffron aroma and must try for all the meat lovers.

Mukhmali Kofta Curry: These are cottage cheese dumplings filled primarily with dry fruits and cheese and cooked in tomato gravy and spices. Tastes good but the tomato flavour overpowered the whole taste, which I am not a big fan of, anyways it might suite someone else‚Äôs taste.¬†

Guchhi Kofta: Its again paneer dumplings filled with Guchhi and cooked to perfection. Team it up with Guchhi pulao and relish like a nawab. The gravy is very creamy a bit yellowish and ideally compliments the dumplings.¬†

Warki Parantha: Very heavy and just perfect to enhance the rich meat and tomato gravy.¬†

Pocket Pinch: Expensive; A scrumptious meal for two with drinks and desserts comes close to INR 6000¬†

Just after you settle the bill and head out you can enjoy the complimentary paans kept neatly just for you on you way out.

Guchhi restaurant is elegant and larger than life in its appeal. The beautiful French windows let natural light flow in and on top of that silk drapes create a mood for romantic dinner experience. Tandoori is their specialty and to be more specific do eat Tawa Machhli, Tandoori Chicken and Murgh Rahra here. The experience of Guchhi is beyond food and is forever welcomed. They have an open kitchen in the center on the restaurant and offers clear view of cooking. My clients enjoyed the dinner here. Visited this restaurant in the month on April 2014 on an official visit to the city.

lovely place lovely good... proper Hyatt type feeling... the only problem is that its extremely boring... thats my only problem... other than that the food is amazing with some tries to be innovative which they succeed at... the dal and the mushrooms are just mouth watering and thier rotis just melt in your mouth...

Guchhi at the Hyaat Regency has a superb ambiance and excellent food and superlative service  is the icing on the cake. Usually when we dine there I order the Bhekti Paturi as a starter its divine both in terms of taste and preparation as well as the quality of the fish. This is something I have ordered pretty much every time and never been disappointed. For the mains I usually like to order either the Kebab-Platter or the Afghani Chicken Tikka which is delicious along with the superb Dal Guchhi with roti or naan or else simply order the Gosht Biryani which is fantastic.To be honest have tried a lot of stuff on their menu and liked most of it but prefer to stick to the basics simply because they are so very good. Love the place and looking forward to going and satiating my craving for their yummy food very soon !

Vying to eat amongst the best Nawabi food in town and budget isn't a constraint? Then you can do worse than heading straight to Guchhi at the Hyatt. The cuisine is a selection of the best from the kitchens of the decadent nawabs of Lucknow and Hyderabad, and the chefs of Hyatt are no less artisans in conjuring the most delectable legacy dishes.

Wife and me wanted to satiate our biriyani craving and yes admittedly had no qualms on splurging a bit. So off we went to Gucchi. As you would expect with a brand like Hyatt the ambience was classy and the service absolutely top notch. We were ushered to our seats by a friendly vivacious attendant. We ordered Mutton Biriyani, Mutton Rogan Josh and Chingri Macher Malai Curry. 

The biriyani was supremely good, and amongst the best I've ever had, easily surpassing the ones I've had at some of the most celebrated places in Hyderabad. Each and every grain of the aromatic basmati rice was infused with the rich melange of spices and the mutton was absolutely melt in your mouth stuff. The key to a great biriyani lies in the proportion of the spices and ingredients used, and this one was impeccable. So flavoursome was this that the accompanying raita was absolutely redundant as we did not want the dahi flavour to tamper with the lingering aftertaste of the biriyani. The rogan josh was again out of this world. A rich, robust spicy gravy with huge chunks of fatty mutton again displayed the sophisticated and skillful use of spices. It was the ideal foil to the legendary biriyani. The last part of our trilogy was the chingri malai curry. We selected this pi√®ce de r√©sistance of Bengali cuisine purposely to complement the nawabi overdose of the biriyani and the rogan josh. Not to be outdone by the rest of the menu, the malai curry was mind-blowing too. Rich mustardy gravy whose pungency was negated and yet taste kept intact by the combination of coconut milk and curd, we savoured this dish after we had finished off every morsel of the biryani and licked every last bit of the rogan josh.The prawns were perfectly cooked, neither too little nor too much and again were melt in the mouth stuff just like every protein portion in our meal.

Of course the resultant bill was quite hefty, but when you subject yourself to food fit for the kings in an ambience these kings would not mind, well its well worth it!

The service alley with most perfect preparation of food. I am always ready to eat if its Guchhi. They have a refined menu with utmost delicious sprinklers. If not less i have been there 50 times, and even for once, i didn't felt repent. Its absolute and its awesome. As it is said that certain feelings can be said can just be felt, its really one awesome one to cherish and feel, but can't be jotted down in words. 

Be at least once there and i can ensure, you won't be stop yourself from returning.

The atmosphere there is really good and gives you a sense of peacefulness. The food is also amazing. The starters including Malai Broccoli and Dahi ke kebab are simply awesome. Coming to the main course, the main course was really good, specially the Guchhi Dal. The deserts were also really delicious. Worth every penny!

last sunday long lunch at guchhi was quite an experience. paneer hara pyaz tikka was awesome and so was crisy potatoes in tamarind...dahi ke kebab was dry and missed the sour cream dip with it..tandoori aloo with sesame was well cooked.
the olive kofta and vilayti sabzi were one of its kind.paneer extremely soft.cheese naan was awesome.dal gucchi was really yummm...for desserts we had ordered mishti doi which was comparable to Ganguram and chocolate kulcha with mango icecream.

staff most courteous. ..with five star ambience. .high ceilings. .glass walls overlooking the lush greens amidst pitter patter rains...this meal was a memorable experience. ..yeh dil maaange more:)

North Indian food cannot get better than this. From the kebabs to the desserts, when everything makes you crave for a second helping, it ought to be one of the best meal experiences. And such was in Guchhi. 
The basil murgh tikka and the afghani chicken tikka were a perfect blend of spicy and succulent. Add on their signature dal and makhmali naan (This was a first and the best bread I have had to wash down the maincourse), and you have satisfied your sensory organs well. The kebabs may seem a little exorbitant but again absolutely worth it. Very few places can get the texture of a kebab this right.
The maincourses are credible but did not really stand out, except for the softness of the meat. Succulent lamb shanks at that. 
Move on to desserts and shahi tukda steals the heart. They say it is all in a name, and shahi tukda is the zenith of it all. It made me fall helplessly in love with a second order on my way.

visted this place just two weeks back, but still under the spell . the entrance is well lit  and Hyatt undoubtedly provides the best hospitality .Coming to the starters , the ones that were complete melt-in-the mouth were the hari pyaaz ka paneer tikka and afghani tikka. the paneer  dish was to die for. Another brilliantly prepared starter had the elements of saffron and paneer with tandoor flavours. Moving over to the main course, 'the' dish jas to be gucci daal. The masala kulcha was right in its fillings and the consistency. The open kitchen is another sight that is so cheering:). Among the side dishes the bhetki was well cooked with the sarso flavour, but not completely bengali . We were a bit disappointed with the biriyani. The sweet dishes aren't that impressing  and a bit overpriced. overall it was one of the best experiences till date. Will be coming back to Hyatt for more :)

I've been there once to celebrate my birthday. The ambiance was great,food was delicious and service was dedicated. There is a live kitchen where you can see the chef at work. Great variety of north Indian food.We tried their kebabs,naan,and dessert. Food was delicious. I loved the blueberry cheesecake from their patisserie for my birthday.All in all,it was a great dining experience.After the dinner we went for a walk by their poolside which was an amazing experience. Thanks to the team of Gucchi for making my birthday special.
Certainly recommended to all foodies.
Life is a beautiful journey..Live it well..

AGONY AT GUCHHI (Hyatt) !
 On Sunday 19th of May I had visited Guchhi in Hyaat at about 1 PM in the morning.I had availed the Groupon deal of Rs 1500 for lunch for a couple.I am sad to say that it was a painful experience for us due to the quality of service or lack of any service by the staff of this restaurant , which they are very well aware of(especially the Lady manager who took the booking).
                     Every time an item was ordered ,it took more than 20-25 minutes of agony to get it on our table.The whole Lunch "Experience" took more than 3 painful hours , due to the disinterest of staff in serving.We could feel that since the lunch was served under a "Deal" offered by hotel on "Discounted" rates , they were discounting their services also ! If that is so then Why did you gives out "Deals" in the first place.I could sense yesterday that not only us but the some other diners on the nearby tables were also complaining about food & Delayed services.
                  Two incidents which perturbed us -I would like to bring into your notice -Twice  when instead of Butter Nan they served us Kulchha ordered by us & when a dessert was ordered to a young guy ,which he said can be served in a very short time was Forgotten by them after we enquired when about half an hour was gone !
                Even at our Local neighbourhood restaurants in south Kolkata  service is much much better than at Hyatt's Guchhi .Only the name if 5 Star , service is typically Indian -3rd class ! Perhaps 60 years after Independence ,we are so much influenced by the color of skin that only foreigners are found worthy of "Service" & Indians considered useless .
            Lastly a word of advise for them-Do not give out Deals when you are not interested to fulfill the obligation.

I had held a party here on 25th November 12' but was not sure about the food, because I had never tried their food. 
But I was pleasantly surprised ! Everything they served was perfect to the core ! Be the drinks, the starters, the main course everything !
I loved their Fish Amritsari and Dal Makhani -  must try dishes for any foodie !
The staff is polite and efficient and the best thing about this place is their Ambience ! I had a wonderful time and I am sure anyone with a good taste would agree with me !

I  would  say its the best place for north Indian in Kolkata. Hats off to the chef for the finger licking food available here. It's a must visit every time I come to Kolkata and they have maintained their consistency. It's got perfect ambiance, perfect service, perfect food and of course perfect quality.
