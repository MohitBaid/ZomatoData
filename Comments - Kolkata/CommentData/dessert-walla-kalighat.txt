Innovative baking, stylistic icing, and a dear to your taste buds is what The Dessertwalla has to offer. Certainly a top runner in the field of baking. The range of varieties that they have to offer are in abundance and all it shouts out to us 'dessert lovers' is: come indulge!

The dessertwalla is a door delivery dessert service that delivers more than that, happiness. Ive had the opportunity to try their dark chocolate caramel cake and ive never ordered anything else but that in the last three orders i gave them. It was just so good i didnt wanted to switch. Just the right amount of dark and sweet that makes you want to have more, pair this with wine(i know thats silly, did that on a friends bday) and its the perfect amalgamation of flavours. Try it once and ull keep coming back to it.

One of the best cakes, cookies and exotic desserts like pudding and tarts I ever had. I have had their cakes, tarts and puddings many a times and have always been surprised by their quality. Just yummy. 
 Generally on the big occasions food is the last thing which you would risk, especially the desserts. And the Dessertwalla has never disappointed me on any of the occasions.  
The chef, Ms Siddhi Ashani of The Dessertwalla is one of the renowned confectioner is the town. She was previously working with Hayatt Kolkata. Her cakes are not only devour-able but also presentable. Recommended any day!
