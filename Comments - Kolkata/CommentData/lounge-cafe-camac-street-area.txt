It's an horrible experience for me. Visiting lounge cafe for Breakfast with my family and guest.Buffet has limited items and they were cold with little stuff in containers.Customer service was too poor no-one bothered to listen our request. One should refrain himself going such type of horrible place.

Don‚Äôt know why people gave bad reviews about this joint. The restaurant is located in a prime location. Smart interior will definitely attract your eyes from outside. The entire spread was undoubtedly lavish and the price is also attractive. In Rs. 650, you will get soup to dessert including üç§, üçó, mutton and üêü. Food was good in taste but starters are big disappointment. Management must take care of starter section, the Reshmi kabab was not at all soft.

Ok so I visited this place along with 2 if my friends for their Special Pujo Buffet . We chose to go for an Ashtami lunch . 
We were led to the buffet area where we noticed a huge spread . Our eyes lit up as we straightaway took our quarter plates and rushed towards the starter section . 

Starters : 

We were disappointed when we didn't find a single kebab dish in their . They had the Keema Papad Roll , Dimer Devil and Fish Tawa Fry . 
Loved the Keema Papad Roll but the other two disappointed us . 

We moved on to the mains hoping for a better spread . 

Main Course : 

Chicken Keema and Baby Butter Naan we started off with and loved it . Totally . Soft and fluffy naan and well cooked spicy keema was too good . 

Luchi with Kosha Mangsho was the next in queue . The mangsho here was strictly average . The flavour was missing . 

Reshmi Murg was the best I have ever had . Brilliant . Tasted good with the naan . Bhetki Kalia was again pretty average . 

Next up, The Chingri Malai Curry was a disaster of sorts . I can't describe it . It was rubbish . Tasted bitter almost like some medicine . I don't have any idea what was that piece of shit . 

We went ahead with Mocktails - Virgin Mojito , Blue Lagoon , Cranberry Mojito . All of them were ok . We resumed with the Dhakai Mangsho Biryani and it was another disappointment . The rice was overcooked and the meat was undercooked . We were fed up of all this so decide to go towards the veg section and surprisingly had some respite in the form of Kancha Kola Kopta kalia and Subz Moong Dal . 

We thought of having some mango lassi before moving on to the desserts . Again it was too bad and we couldn't have more than a sip . 

Desserts : 

The saving grace of the otherwise most dull buffet I have been a part of . 
Payesh was so-so . Loved the angoori rasmalai . Tasted oh so good üòç. The Rossogolas were good and looked like was brought from some sweet shop . 
Vanilla icecream was too good . Mishti Doi was a bad experience . Paan was good .

Service was bad . All staffs were inattentive . No one listened to what you want . Even if they did , they forgot to bring it to you . The guy at the mocktail section was rude and denied us a drink because it was 3:30 and the buffet will be wrapped up . But "we are goddamn eating and we haven't completed yet " made the manager come in and asked him to give us the drink .

Overall I won't be recommending this place . Will give a try once again soon for their ala carte menu .

Went there for buffet dinner during pujo. There were lots of hits and misses. Chingri malai curry was awesome. Chicken was overcooked and some of the items were not fresh. But the menu was good. Courteous staff. Got a big discount from a website!

Food quality was horrible. Service was good. Presentation was very good. Chicken was raw and hard. Mutton was undercooked and very spicy. Altogether not happy at all. Must look into the competitors quality
