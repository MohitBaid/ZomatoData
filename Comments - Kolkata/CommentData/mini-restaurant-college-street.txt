College Street is full of restaurants. But there are handful few which the worth visiting. Mini Restaurant is a place which is one of the poorest place in this area. I have been here a number of time and tasted few of their dishes. Nothing is worth eating. Prices are high and quality is poor.

Surya Sen Street has got an array of restaurants mostly catering to low income group people. During my college days, when we used to run low on pockets, places like this came to the rescue. The Aloo Paratha and Lassi from here is something I would crave for life. They make Nolen Gurer Sandesh as well which is popular locally but I don't find that to be very good.

being grown up in surya sen street on must have eaten at least once in mini restaurant. it used to be really good once upon a time. i won't say it is not now, but the amount of changes they have made compared to the price upgrade is very small. same old food items, nothing new to be looked twice in menu Â card. restaurant is very unclean and trust me its impossible to sit more than 10 minutes in the restaurant. hot and sweaty all over the year. no proper gate, loud and noisy environment due to the local bazar in front of the restaurant. i'm giving it a 2.5 star as i have availed take away service from them so many times and that didn't fail to impress me ever.

During my stay in College Street I visited this place once and I decided not to see that place again. They don't have any dish that is cooked well. Even in casual dining the rice quality is ordinary and the quantity is not much and is charged almost like Fried Rice.
And the Chinese dishes they prepare is the same. Low in quality. 
I won't ever recommend this place to anyone. You will find far better places to dine in at College Street at half the price of this.

In my nostalgia trip in Kolkata this is a notable bookmark. When i was little enough to still go out with my parents during pujas we visited here pretty often. The muglai here is one of my favourite and putting into consideration that there is absolutely no proper muglai parota in college street. Mini may not appeal to the masses but for me its appeals only for the muglai and nothing else.

Been there on every durga puja :-P
Quantity of their chicken biriyani and mix hakka noodles is very well. However quality wise it is not that superior, just ok type. I am giving 3 for that.

A proper restaurant offering okay quality food at slightly higher prices! The only logical reason behind its popularity is the absence of similar restaurants in its vicinity! Service is okay. Food is okay. But price a bit high considering its location and quality.

Located on surya Sen street. Wide variety of Bengali dishes. I usually have the thali. And I quite like it. However price is slightly high compared to other places nearby. Taste is really good though
