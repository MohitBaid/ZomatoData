Since our childhood days we are in love with the chinese food of this small outlet situated in Jadavpur 8B bus stand area and sharing the same floor with the Jadavpur Coffee house. You may not be overwhelmed by the look of this small restro but the food they prepare are really nice.
I dont love to experiment with new dishes but prefer to have traditional Chilly chicken and Mixed fried rice-they are just made for each other. The dark coloured chilly chicken is very famous amongst us. 8soft succulent chicken pieces prepared in dark soya sauce with onion and capsicum. In mixed fried rice they serve pork-so have a special mention of it. As starter we had crispy chicken-shredded chicken pieces golden fried and served with a sweet chilly sauce with a flavour of coriander. Really lovely experience overall..

We have been there almost 4 months back. There is nothing to say about the ambience. It's a small pocket friendly place. We had Mixed Rice Noodles, Mandarin Fish and Thai Garlic Chicken. The rice noodles were tasty but a bit too oily. Mandarin Fish was average in taste but the Thai Garlic chicken was perfect. The taste was absolutely bang on. The quantity as quality is good.

Been to this place with my partner several times. One thing that impressed me too much was the quality of the food. The place is small, situated on first floor beside Indian Coffee House. I liked the dimly lit ambience. We ordered for Drums of Heaven as starter. The quality of food was good and it was a bit spicy which I liked. The main course was Blue lagoon mixed fried rice, Chicken with Mushroom and corn, Chili Pork and coke. The dishes were really impressive and the service of the men were amazing. We visited the place many a times and tasted chili button mushroom, crispy chili baby corn, Hunan chicken, Garlic Fish. The disappointment that I had was of cleanliness. Once a time we found the plates a bit dirty and the table cloth stained. 
But overall it's a good experience.

This is our regular joint for whenever hunger pangs hit us on campus.
The only problem with this place is that a weird smell hits your nostrils right when you enter.
Had gone here just yesterday for a quick lunch with a senior. We ordered Lemon Fried Chicken for starter. We followed it with an egg yea mein (gravy chow) and tangy pork.
The starter tasted pretty good. Crumb fried chicken nuggets with the freshness if lime.
The gravy chow was wholesome and more than enough for two people. But the best dish was the tangy pork. It had lean pieces of smoked pork in a sticky sweet and spicy gravy. It was a hearty lunch. 
They don't charge taxes too. But, I can't rate them more as the smell really gets on your nerves.

One of the oldest restaurant in jadavpur but has taken a back step in terms of popularity. From outside it looks old but ' Never judge a book by its cover ' . This place still provides you nice Chinese cuisines like their old days. The place may be dark, a bit shabby but the people their are well behaved. Food may not be top class but it's better than as it seems from outside. The two Q's quality and quantity is really justified and not much pricy either. So, you can seriously try this placeüòÄ

Heard a lot about this place since childhood that this was the best place in jadavpur to have chinese cuisine.so last week I went there. I don't know what happened to this place or may be whatever I heard was wrong. The place is so clumsy,unhygienic and  we had to face suffocation there. If you are lucky enough you can also see cockroaches. We ordered Hakka noodles with chilli pork. The food was not even cooked properly. There was no pork meat piece ..they served Only fat portion. I must say..it was a very very horrible experience for me. So basically i will suggest everyone to simply avoid this place. :|

This is located just beside Jadavpur Coffee House.
A small restaurant with an old charm.
I went here for a small dinner with my dad.
I had their hot n sour chicken soup,Hunan fish and Mixed noodles.
Quantity is sufficient for two.
Food tasted nice.
The noodles and fish were tasty.
Prices are reasonable too.
Wide range of seafoods and pork items are avaible.
They need to work on the ambience.

A decent chinese outlet with decent pricing. Been their with my friend & had their Lung Fung Soup, Mixed Fried Rice along with Thai Chili Garlic Chicken.
Lung Fung soup was too good. Shreaded chicken with mushroom dipped in thick tasty gravy. Mxd fried rice was good but the egg portions were over fried.Thai chili garlic chicken goes well with rice due to its mild chili flavour. In spite of being a garlic flavoured dish, its not that red type of prepration that usually we see in other hot garlic/sweet garlic dishes. Overall recomended if u are low on ur budget & good for students. AC interior & no GST still now. So thats a relief indeed‚úå‚úå

Though a clumsy ambience, I would rate the food of this place highly and would like to recommend it to other foodies as well.

The drums of heaven was really good and to my delight it was not that spicy.

The pepper fried chicken was different from the regular pepper chicken which was attracting.

The chicken momo was tasty and had its own charm...

A 4.5 for the taste which shouldn't be ignored.

Ambience was satisfactory. Service too good. Food was exceptionally fabulous. Manchurian pork and chicken fried rice went too well for the tummy as well as for the pocket. The fried rice was too good for the taste but had a bit extra oil in it. The suggestion is, if you are trying pork for the first time, please start of with a dish that is full of chillies! You will love it!

Everything here has an old world vibe to it.Remember, this is an old joint, 32 years old. Charming if you're into that sort of thing. However the novelty of it quickly runs thin.
The ambiance is the same as the one I saw as a child and the Air conditioning doesn't work. 
This being an old joint means that this place will give you ample food per platter. 
The food is good though.  The quantity is more than enough. According to price, that is. 
 However, me being a stickler for hygiene can't really recommend this to anyone. 
Good for takeouts, cheap dates and annoying relatives you secretly can't stand.

I have been going to this cozy nook since my childhood.The basic point of this restaurant is the casual comfort and familiar environment it offers.The decor is casual and homely and so is the food.I have tasted varieties of Hakka noodles here which is quite good.The mixed Noodles boast of pork(which tastes quite good) apart from the usual ingredients of mutton,chicken and prawn..The sides are always average.The soups they offer however are quite horrible. The fish fries or fingers or chicken pakoras that they serve are however fabulous.The momo that they serve here is awesome too.The price is reasonable in comparison with the quantity they offer. The restaurant is in every sense of the term basic.Nothing fancy yet has a charm of its own,mainly because of the low price tag and because of the homely ambience.

Visited this restaurant today yet again.. Situated in Jadavpur 8B, just beside the INDIAN COFFEE HOUSE, this restaurant sells some amazing Chinese food.. They used to be pocket friendly but recently they have increased their prices . Well, if u are looking for a place with good interiors then this is just not the right place. The place is shabby, dark and dimly lighted and the interior is just ok..
But they sell some amazing food. Quantity is great as per the price.. Today, we ordered
PORK GRAVY NOODLE AND
CHILLI CHICKEN (DRY).
Apart from these dishes, i really love their DRUMS OF HEAVEN, BL SPECIAL GRAVY NOODLE, CHILLI PORK, AND MANCHURIAN PORK..
They make some really amazing pork dishes and from which ever high end restaurants i have pork from , this place is always to be remembered.. Ok. Now coming to todays food.
The pork gravy noodle was really good and filling but i didnt get much PORK pieces there although we ordered the pork one. The chilli chicken dry was just awesome. Really tasty, not to oily and was going well with the gravy noodle. Overall, had a good experience like every time but would recommend u to opt for home delivery if u like places with good interiors and if not then just jump in.. :)

This place is kind of very shady and dingy and I'd rather have my food delivered from there than go there again. Because they do make good food. From the Blue Lagoon Special Soup to Blue Lagoon Special Gravy Noodles, everything felt heavenly in my mouth. The soup was warm,thick and had me smacking my lips in a moment. The noodles tasted good enough and it was all fine, even with the really slow service and the grumpy owner, till my friend ordered Crispy Chicken. They were chicken pakoras, to be precise. And had coriander leaves in them (what?! I know what you are thinking!).
The bill was REALLY low. A mere 560 bucks.
P.S- They add the service tax later- its not inclusive.

The Blue Lagoon is as good an option as most other after-college food joints are. Any and all persons I know in this Jadavpur/Jodhpur area swear by this joint, and it is very clear why.

The food is marvellous. The quantities are large, but not excessive. The pricing they've showed on Zomato are far from what they actually charge. There's been a steady rise of 20 to 30 rupees on all dishes, especially on the pork preparations which seem to have recorded a massive price hike. Regardless, the food has remained unaffected and thankfully, so has the service.

The waiters and staff are all courteous in their own measure. The small seating area doesn't make for a very lively and comfortable eating experience, but that is all forgotten if you're with close friends. The restaurant plays with a nice red theme, something I've always admired.

Rest assured, The Blue Lagoon seems to be evergreen in the hearts of Jadavpur University students, giving me (a Xaverian) enough incentive to try it out. I was NOT disappointed.

If you're ever in the area, instead of flocking to the popular Calcutta Bistro, try out the Blue Lagoon. It might make your day.

Ambience: 2.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

Thanks for reading and pardon any grammatical errors I may have made.

It is one of those places wherein you blink and you miss it. Located near 8B Bus Stand, it is on the top of the Jadavpur Bazaar. Do not go by the looks of the place. The food served is simply amazing especially the Prawn items. It is something one should NOT miss, if you are a Prawn-Addict. Pocket-friendly rates. Overall, a satisafactory food joint.

situated nearby the 8B bus stand in jadavpur, this year old restaurant is one of those pocket friendly restaurants that will never let you think twice to give a visit. the place is very small, maximum of 20 people can be accustomed. but the food items are really unique and pure bliss for your taste buds. oriental fish or pork are my favourite items there. food quality and quantity both are satisfying. i have gone to this place several times and i will definitely recommend others to visit this place at least once.

One rare place where people should not go by the looks of the restaurant. The ambiance is decent, but the hygiene condition is way below standards. The food though is delicious and for the price it is offered, keeps everyone happy. The Pork especially is in good demand here.

Loooonnng ago when I was a kid then we all used to go there to have our Sunday dinner. Back then the food was good. Although the space is limited. Nowadays the quality has decreased. Last ate back in 2014. Since then haven't visited here. So no recent updates

I've been visiting this place since forever and so, writing about it never struck me unless I'd had to leave Kolkata and went back here again on one of my trips home.
It's cheap, very very cheap. And the food is tasty, well the more popular dishes are at least. Reasonably good variation in menu too. Pork in stir fried vegetables here, is a must try...
On the down side, the place is not very hygienic. So take all precautions you would with a road side stall. And don't even try to peek into the kitchen ;-)
The name justifies most, the lighting of the place... Which is undersea blue and so, it's perfect for small groups. There isn't anyway much space. Highly recommended for low budget take-aways too.

There is nothing fancy about this place. No great ambiance, no great service , no decor, very small, location is also very shady. So why should one rate it 4/5? Well the food is what steals you away. Its delicious and mouthwatering. I have grown up around this place, and have seen it grow old with time. But the food remained same and isn't that the only thing that should matter? Good food and a happy soul?

Visited this restraunt with two if my friends.  The ambience is very good. But when I got a peek inside the cooking area my inage deteriorated. It was stinky inside,  lack if cleanliness was evident. The food which arrived also below standard.  Chilli pork wss tasteless and smelly.  Fried rice was nit properly boiled.  Over all bitter experience. Try to avoid this place.

This tiny restaurant is located at jadavpur, 8b bus stand. Finding this place is a task. It's located on the first floor and one has to take a flight of stairs to reach it. The condition of the stairs is horrible. Extremely dirty and stinking, unhygienic ( understandably so, as it's located in the middle of the jadavpur market). They should really do something about the entrance situation. This is a tiny outlet with dim lighting and more or less comfortable seats. Ambience is decent, nothing extraordinary.  The service service is quick, the waiters are quite attentive and look to fulfilling their customer's requirements. I had ordered chicken noodles, garlic chicken, sweet n sour chicken, drums of heaven. Food was delivered within a formidable time and tasted good. Best part the pocket pinch. It is really affordable much to a college going student's delight.

It is small place situated just above 8b bake club... Generally goes unnoticed... Very small ambience it dark... But do bot go on the ambience the food is amazing and on of the famous chise restraurant of the this area

Personal favourite are...
Chicken gravy chowmien
Hot garlic chicken
Lemon chicken
Crispy chicken 
Veg sweet and sour
And the momo sauce tastes amazing (they make it in a different way)

Today I ordered some food from blue lagoon. Checken gravy chowmien, chicken sweet sour and chilli chicken

Food 5 on 5

I love to try the small and medium joints. Its possible to discover few items which you can relish.. Blue lagoon is a simple regular restaurant from where I had ordered food long time back.. yesterday I ordered drums of heaven and honey chicken.

Drums of heaven had a touch of Bengal. Chicken drumsticks and few leg pieces cooked with chopped onions, garlic , ginger and probably turmeric, jeera etc... Its not at all the chinese version nor it was the "fried in batter' type.. I loved the bengali drums of heaven. It matches very well with chilled beer. Honey chicken is also good... try it with butter toast  or plain rice.. 

The delivery was quick but the packing of the drums of heaven was in cardboard box which made the spicy sticky sauce bit messy.  

Price is the bumber USP.. Rs160 for 8 pieces of Drums of Heaven is truly a service to mankind.

'Blue Lagoon' is a hidden gem of Jadavpur. It is located in the Jadavpur Super Market beside Indian Coffee House,near the 8B bus stand. I must say that I did not about this eatery even two weeks back, since then I have been itching to visit this eatery. Finally, I got the chance today. I visited around 4.20 pm. The entrance is a bit complicated. You can take the staircase in the lane beside 'The Sugarr and Spice' but I will advise you to avoid that as it is very dirty. You can opt for the staircase just opposite to 'Bake Paradise', it will be easier to visit the shop. The eatery is not a humongous one, it is small with dim lighting. The ambience is quite romantic if you are visiting with your other half, which I did. I ordered a 'Drums of Heaven'. The food took ten minutes to arrive. The food came. It was eight pieces of chicken fried in different sauces with onions and other vegetables. The food was delicious to say the least. They provided us with chicken pieces which did not have any coating of batter around it. The veggies made the dish more tasty. My better half found the dish to be a bit hot, but I thought that it was perfect. The staff is very well-behaved. The waiter refilled our glasses continuously without us having to say anything,excellent service to say the least. I will definitely visit again to try out their other dishes.

Almost two decades old, this was our favorite food joint when we were students and really short of money. Food is real cheap, and over and above the quantity was perfect. For instance, you can order only one plate chicken noodles and it will be enough for 2 people. Same we did for the soup. A bowl of soup can be divided among two, if you ask them to. So it's realcozy, perfect, and warm for the low budget foodies.

So this one is located near 8b bus stand at jadavpur. Basically this is one room just above the super market beside the coffee house. The place is dark and dingy. Though I personally prefer these dim lighted restaurants. Anyway do not let the mediocre ambience fool you. Because the food they serve is yummlicious. 
One fine afternoon, tired and hugry under the scorching sun, my friend and I decided to go there for lunch because it is extremely close to my university. The ambience is too mediocre nothing worth mentioning.
So we ordered a pork noodles and a chicken item. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of the dish right now. But boy it was amazing. The noodles was sooo good though the quantity was less. 
Nevertheless we were so satisfied after the fulfilling lunch that we felt like we might doze off anytime. 
If you're around that area and looking for a good place to fill your tummy this place is definitely worth a try!

It is truly a hidden gem in the Jadavpur area but far better than the banzara and bawarchi. Though I hate the entrance. It is through a shabby staircase and also the ambience is very cramped but the food is not bad. I like the gravy chowmein and dry chili chicken the most. Pricing is cheap. Overall a nice place. Better to take away

Recently visited this restaurant after my friends cajoled me a lot and yep, this place turned out to be a hidden gem at the heart of jadavpur. The location is a bit tricky and you might have to take the local's help. Mostly frequented by college students and young couples but for me it turned out to be a great place to chill and hangout with your friends.¬†
We tried Hong kong chicken, Mixed Yeamin and Blue lagoon special gravy chowmein. Yeamin was something I tried for the first time. It's a mix between meifoon and noodles loaded with mushrooms, a lot of veggies, pork, prawn, egg and chicken. Both the yeamin and blue lagoon chowmein were yummilicious.¬† The hong kong chicken was also good but it would have tasted better if more parsleys and mushrooms were used.¬†
Overall, had a good time there. Will visit this place soon to try out their other Chinese items.

A hidden gem in Jadavpur.Located beside the coffee house.
Items ordered : Drums of heaven and Chilli Garlic pepper Fish.
Drums of heaven was too good,very spicy and crispy from outside.Every plate contained 8 pieces of chicken.Pepper Fish was bit dry and spicy with lots of chillies and garlic.
Had to wait an hour after placing the order but the food however was worth the wait. 
The quantity is sufficient for two and its also pocket friendly.

It was one of the sultry afternoons when I could do anything to get rid of sun. It's basically a small room above the market and few steps away from the coffee house. It's really dark inside and I liked that part until I realised I need minimum light to get my pictures. :)

We opted for chilli pork and pork noodles as my friend would die without pork on that very day. She liked it very much but it appears quite simple and average to me. 

They serve really quick and they background songs they play are of my type. The charges are equally average here. Post food, I felt like going off to sleep but it wasn't that hot outside so I happily walked out.

Worth a try!

Blue Lagoon is a small Chinese restaurant near Jadavpur 8B bus-stand. It's a bit tricky to spot, being situated on the first floor of a moderately old house. The place has a reddish ambience with a kind of Chinese lanterns hanging over the tables. Walls are crafted with wooden finishing. Foods tasted awesome and the quality was also good. Drums Heaven were delicious. Quantity of a single bowl of Chicken Hakka Chowmein or Chicken Fried Rice was more than enough for two people. The side dish Thai Chilli Garlic Chicken was also very tasty. Their service was helpful. The waiter helped us a lot to decide the menu by answering all our queries. Pocket friendly prices and what mentioned on their menu were even inclusive of VAT. Cards are not accepted. I would like to give a total rating of 7 out of 10 for this place.

this place had always been there and a place which had never impressd me much and so I never paid visit.until recently.and the visit re-instated the fact that ambience and good food need not always co-exist.A small joint beside coffee house in jadavpur its small cozy nothing out of world decor-wise.But food is yum!... try the pork dishes...my personal fav is red chilli pork(dry) and golderln fried chicken.

This is a very tiny,dark place. Ambience and service is nothing to write home about. What you're gonna like about this place is quality of their dishes. Chicken mushroom clear soup, chicken Szechwan and dry chili chicken/pork is a must try,packed with flavours. Portions are good.But price is little bit on the higher side in my opinion. 

Service and ambience- 1.5/5
Food Quality- 4/5

A very shabby ambience and quite small but it makes up for its food. We tried the prawn pakora and dry chilli pork , chowmein and oriental chicken.¬†
Helpings are more than adequate and tastewise very good. i loved the pork and chicken.. this restaurant is a hidden gem according to me. price is reasonable too.

The restaurant is situated beside Indian CoffeeHouse . It is very small but very neat and clean restaurant. The dim glowing light was enhancing the mood of dinner. We took 2 plates Drums of heaven for 4 people. The test was superb. Every plate contained 8 pieces of chicken. But the service of the waiters was not efficient enough.

This restaurant is at least 25 years old and one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Jadavpur area. Adjacent to the coffee house,it is a dimly lit small place and the decor has not changed over years. Not a great ambiance that families might sit and enjoy, but the food and the service will overwhelm you. The taste is authentic and quantity is huge. Try their gravy noodles and chicken dishes. Pork is fresh as well. The pricing is also one of the cheapest in south Kolkata.¬†
My rating goes for the taste and value for money.

It was Durgapuja 2011. Found this place to be the only one without a Que in the Jadavpur/Lords area. Blue Lagoon was a Hidden Sapphire back then.After getting popular these days its standards have dropped, but to a very little extent considering their pork dishes are still the same delicious from what i remember from my school days.¬†In starters the chic. clear soup, crispy pepper chic. and tangy chic. are worth trying.¬†Do give it a try on the 2nd floor of 8B supermarket.:)

Food in this place tastes the same as it tasted 10 years back. I think they seriously need to think about their interiors now. The lighting is too dim and you might always have a two minds about the hygiene conditions. I love their starters and soups. Home delivery is also good option as they have now started delivery services. They do not accept cards, which is again a minus point. Parking is impossible down there.

The ambience is really gloomy and eerie. Some people prefer that kind of atmosphere but I don't. It's a very small restaurant - extremely crammed up. So I wasn't very happy with it.

I went there with my classmates and had Tangy Chicken. The prices are a bit above average but the food they serve is good. The quality is better than the average Chinese restaurants which pop up every now and then.

I would not recommend this place to friends and colleagues simply because it is so small. The atmosphere is just depressing. The only thing good about this place is the food.

I am an ardent pork meat lover.Though there are lots of fine restaurants in the area of my college(jadavpur)..I missed menus containing pork dishes.Thanks to zomato..I found this gem of a place very close to my college.It's located near 8b bus stand..A very tiny restaurant tucked between bhooter raja dilo bor and Indian coffee house.I was going to meet a friend of mine who wanted to taste pork for the first time..so I opted for a takeaway of dry chilli pork.The meat was cooked perfectly..so soft..just melted in mouth.Wasn't loaded with too much spiciness..The flavour was perfect.Even my friend who was trying pork for the first time was blown away by this lip-smacking dish.I'm lucky to find such a place serving variety of pork dishes near my college.Looking forward to trying out all of them.

The only cons of this place are it's tiny size..n a weird damp smell inside the restaurant(pls do something about this smell..really).

Had some eating experience before also from this place as a guest to¬† some relatives. But this time went personally there to take a delivery for home. On the first floor beside Coffee House Jadavpur. Bit dark and damp place. I think it's better to get food from here and eat at home than having here. Small dark place. Price wise Food is I will say OK not too good not too bad! Ordered Blue Lagoon Special Fried Rice (Which was a normal Mixed Fried Rice with Pork), Chicken Gravy Chow, And Hot Garlic Chicken. out of these didn't like Hot Garlic chicken as it was kind of sweet in taste which I was rather expecting to be Spicy and Hot. Rest two were ok! All in All Economic Chinese food for quick service near Jadavpur Area.

It's in the jadavpur super market. Beside the Indian coffee house.
The ambience nd environment is a bit shady, darkish and seems gloomy sort of.
They serve mainly Chinese. Their Manchurian, hot garlic chicken dishes taste almost alike. Sweet nd sour chicken is better. Didn't like the gravy noodles much. Swezwan noodles and hakka noodles are better.
They serve average Chinese food.

I discovered this tiny restaurant when one of my friends decided to give us a treat in Jadavpur. Even though this place is located beside Jadavpur University, a minute's walk from the bustling 8B bus-stand, it is difficult to locate for a first timer, like me. This restaurant is located JUST BESIDE (literally!) the Jadavpur Coffee House, and has no signs on it's ground floor entrance passage (hence the difficulty!).¬†
On climbing to the first floor, I spot a single door with the name of the restaurant and I enter this shabby, dark place. Believe me, this place is really tiny (I noticed around 6 tables, served by 1 waiter). And damp! The room is dark, filled with floating lamps that do give it a nice decorative look, but hardly lightens up a food table as it should.
Moving on, to food, the eternal part of any eatery.¬†
We were five people and we ordered Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, two plates of Pork noodles (hakka and gravy, both), Chinese Chopsuey and 5 glasses of soda lime water to finish off with.
The food arrived after 15 minutes, steaming hot. The soup was tasty but the crispy chilli baby corn was nothing but fried baby corn. There was practically no 'chilli' flavour in it.
The pork noodles were superb, though! One plate is sufficient for two not-so-heavy-eaters like me, but the chopsuey was AMAZING. The fried noodles were very crispy and had little taste in it, but the gravy was quite delicious with wholesome shredded chicken pieces. Soda lime water was as normal and delightful like we make in our home,although in that humid place, it seemed like a coolant.¬†
Over all, it was a nice experience (yeah, I'm being modest :P ) if not a brilliant one.

Don't go by its size.... One the best chinese restaurant in kolkata. I have visited here at least 300 times in last 20 years but never had any complain on food quality. If you are going with your kid... You can even request them for customised preparation. Believe me you can compare their food with any big shots present in parkstreet. If you are in this area you must try once.... But the restaurant is small... 15 seater. So if you are looking for good ambience... This is not the place.

I haven't been to the restaurant,but had a home delivery done from here. The person on phone was helpful and the food was delivered within the time they promised. The packing was properly done. We had a crispy chicken for starters. The chicken was not saut√©ed in sauce but was only fried. It tasted good. The chicken hakka chowmein was good but was very oily,whereas the chicken and prawn chowmein was very good. The only disappointment was the thai chilli chicken. It tasted awful and the coriander in it made it even worse. Overall,the food was tasty and they gave the main course  in HUGE portions which could have been sufficient for five people.

Situated near the 8b Bus stand, pretty famous with all the pork lovers around, Blue lagoon caters to your taste buds when it comes to good pork. Especially the dry pork chilly or the garlic pork are as good as any other you'll find. There are not many staffs in here, but that is not a problem because you get your food in not much time. I havent really tried the indian dishes here but there is nothing to complain about the chinese. Cheers!!

This place is very small, i guess around 5-6 tables are there. The food is cheap and good both in quality and quantity. Nothing much of a decor and ambiance, Dim lights and that's it. The service is not that good. We had a Mixed gravy chowmein and it was very tasty and a Thai chili garlic chicken. Both were perfectly cooked. Don't go by the looks of this restaurant you will get real good food here.

the best thing about this restaurant is that food is really cheap here. The quantity of food served per plate is good enough for two people. If you are looking for share-a-meal option, this is the place to go.

First of all a very small place to dine in...This joint was in my wishlist for a long time,never had a chance to visit...But never thought this joint is a tiny road side resturant...My experience of this place is little bit disappointing...As I said earlier this is a very small resturant with maximum 5-6 tabels,and the ambience is not well enough and also little smelly...The staffs are ameture but well behaved...The waiter who was serving us almost over turned a glass of water...Now the food,the food was good...Pork was enough fresh but the regular water was kind of smelly and salty...Although the food was tasty...Recommended if you're visiting with friends...Will Visit again...

This place could be a perfect exemplary for "Looks can be deceptive". The outlet is indubitably out-of-place, although the dishes are quite delicious. The soups as well as the main courses like fried rice, chicken, pork give the necessary savoury touch to the taste buds. The prices are not too high, and spending lavishly does not bother one much. The ambiance could be favorable if friends are around, certainly not when a family dine-out is in question. The behaviour of the staffs are satisfactory and they are quite polite in their approach and questions. Its incongruous location serves a great deal to its evasion to the searches of ardent food lovers and connoisseurs.

I was amazed to find that I had not reviewed this place earlier. This is not the kind of place for people for whom the ambiance matters a lot. But this is just the kind of place for people who give preference to good quality food that appeals immediately to the taste buds. This place being pretty near to my place in Santoshpur, I have often ordered home delivery, and their service is prompt. The food is served hot and nicely packed. Among the items I enjoy ordering from their menu are the momos, Mixed Fried Rice, Mixed Gravy noodles (and I believe that a place which can make gravy chowmein to perfection can master any other item too!), Chili Chicken, Honey Chicken, Sweet and Sour Prawn, Special Chili Garlic Pepper Pork, Blue Lagoon Special Crab (don't worry about the bones, they serve crab-meat balls in the sauce).

It is Jadavpur and everything is scaled down here to suit the JU crowd. Being a student once I do understand the need for a budget place where there is no extra fuss demanding service tax and other such difficult to fathom extended expenses. You seek good food that will fit your budget and a place that's no five star but still has some sort of comfy seating arrangement where you can spend the evening with special people. Blue Lagoon is exactly such a place.
It is the only place in and around Jadavpur that serves pork and solely for that reason it scores brownie point in my list. it served Indianised chinese and just that unlike the multucuisine restros around. Located on the first floor of the CIT market building near 8B bus stand it is sandwiched between Bhooter Raja Dilo Bor and Indian Coffee House. Prices are really cheap and the food adequately tasty. Portions are huge and the staff is friendly. I love the Chili Garlic Pepper pork, Crispy fried and tossed chicken, Fried golden chicke, Crispy golden prawn and Blue Lagoon special chowmein.
I know it is a really simple place with no fancy seating or decor to please people who seek "quality" in every place they visit but it's clean, and is the most beautiful place when you have your college crush beside you sharing a plate of chicken momo in the dim interiors of Blue Lagoon.

Located in the center of the busiest place in Jadavpur, near 8B bus-stand, first floor next to coffee house.
Don't judge it by looks, looks can be very decisive. My brother introduced me this place saying that they serve the best pork in South Kolkata. I stay in Ganguly Bagan and this place is about 10 min tops away from my place. I often visit this place with frnds. The first impression was not at all good. Its dark, very  tiny. The shop is both clean and tidy‚Äîdespite having limited space and more customers than can fit inside at one time. As usual we ordered chilly pork with Cantonese noodles and dry chilly chicken. Food quantity was good and pork was just too good.  
Service : Serving time is too long. Doesn't matter you order for 2 ppl or 4 ppl they are going to serve u after 20-25 min.
From wallet point of view its not very costly, considering they are the only restaurants serving pork in that area.

I dont know whether many people are aware of ths restaurant.. Its situated at jadavpur 8b.. I remember visiting ths place during the pujas at around 10pm.. All the other restaurants were crowded n we were informed that we have to wait for atleast 1hr so we decided to gv ths one a try.. And trust me, we really did nt regret spending 400 bucks.. The inside is not very impressive though as its a small eatery with 4 tables but the food was great.. The rice, the noodles, the chicken tasted delicious.. I was a bit disappointed as there were dim lights n I couldn't click pics :-/ the service was just satisfactory.. The ambience was nothng great.. There was a group of girls at another table who were literally shouting n laughing and chewing everyone's head :-/ So, i would recommend ths place to people ONLY for the good food they serve.. :-)

This place is really a tiny eating joint, located in the heart of the ever-busy 8-b bus stand. In the near locality where you can find two three good confectioneries, the fast food joints, multi-cuisines.....blue lagoon fulfills the need of an authentic chinese eatery. The ambience is small but cozy, very much suitable for couples to sit there for hours with a bowl of soup or crispy chicken. Food quality wise its good enough and worth the price. Here, i lllove the pork dishes, specially the dry chilli garlic one. Quantity wise they are very generous with the amount. One dish can be fairly shared by two. Pocket pinch for two is 350 - 400!! I might not recommend it for a lavish luxurious planned dinner but to catch up with friends or for a small bite or so..this place is  a sure 'thumbs up'.

I don't know why but I like this place. The restaurant is small and cramped with sitting arrangement for only 26 people (yes I counted) and consequently not a place appropriate for a huge party. But  the food is reasonably good. There are also enough variety in the menu. I won't say that I have tasted the best pork of Kolkata here but keeping in mind the cost they are pretty satisfactory. I especially like the special dry chilly garlic pork with either blue lagoon special rice/thai rice or simply pork/mixed rice. Among the crab dishes I like the thai chilli garlic crab. The chicken dishes are so-so ie nether they are something from outside of the earth nor they are bland and tasteless. As a bottom-line, the restaurant should be considered as a occasional hang out place for the university students and/or a take home joint. Considering the price-range, taste,ambiance, variety and targeted customers I will give the place 3.5 stars outta 5

Again, a haunt during our good old JU days. A small and I must mention cozy place in the 8B bus stand are of Jadavpur, this eatery does not boast of extensive spread and high-profile customers. It is meant for college kids and it lives up to its name. The food here is quite good as it is in other restaurants in this are like Banzara. The pocket pinch is not so high and the service is good. It is a must if you want to bring friends to a place where you want to be loud and go back to college days! A 3.0 from me.

Blue lagoon is one of the finest restaurants you can be in South Kolkata. Do not go by the looks. Me and my girlfriend always used to hang out here and it is our favorite place. The service is very good. The environment is nice. It is not one of the loud restaurants. You will feel very comfortable. I have almost tasted all the items in the menu. They are just awesome. A little tip: try out thai soup, crispy chicken in sauce, ginger balls and steamed momo as starters. If you are in for a lunch or dinner do not forget to try rice noodles and singapore chicken. I am right now not in Kolkata and miss my days with my love in the restaurants. I hope I shall come back soon and have our favorite soup  there.

One of my friends introduced me to ‚ÄòBlue Lagoon‚Äô.  Though I am proclaim myself as ‚ÄòChini Food‚Äô lover, it took me no time to land on the stairs of this restaurant. But I must say I don‚Äôt regret that day. It‚Äôs a very small place at the heart of Jadavpur bazaar with more or less 40 people dine together. 

The ambiance is not that much to talk about. They don‚Äôt really reflect the Chinese fashion. But Chinese lanterns play a zing to it, dim shallow light and terracotta walls soothed your eyes.  

On my first visit I had no idea what sort quality and quantity they provide so I took risk. My friend is very much aware of this place, so he suggested me they provide a very fair amount of food which cannot be consumed by people like me. So we ordered one platter to share. We ordered ‚Äòdrums heaven‚Äô for starters, and since then I am fan of this dish. Crispiness and tenderness of the chicken and delicious outer coating of it left you say only ‚ÄòYum‚Äô for sure. For the main we had Yum Chung rich with Hot Garlic chicken. I thoroughly enjoyed the spiciness of those dishes. And since then they are my favorites. On one of my visits I had tried pork rice, though I was trying pork for the first time, I find it very delicious on my taste buds. 
On my many visits I have tried Hong Kong fried rice Szechuan fried rice; they are very different from one another. I am not saying they are providing best, but I can state that they are serving superlative version of Chinese food. In terms of service they manage to get fair marks. Only one man handle the service department who takes order and serve usually. But I must say he operates it very smoothly. 

If you are lover of Chinese cuisine I suggest go there and have a bite.

I like Blue lagoon a lot since it is a good place for JU people to hang out. There is very good food for modest price, specially Blue Lagoon Special Chowmien and steamed momos which are yummy to taste. It is very tasty and filling and lots of amount in the food. But place is not nice when it comes to dining because it is small.

I like also their fish and prawn items, especially chilly fish and special tangy fish and also their pork items are supposed to be very good although I have not eaten them.

This post is written because the other day, when I went to my friend's place near Santoshpur, we were totally looking forward to the dry chilli garlic pepper pork from Blue Lagoon, and missed it. Undaunted, I went there during the weekend with a friend and ate our hearts out. Our menu was simple and straightforward -  Dry Chilli garlic pepper pork, Chicken fried rice, fried golden chicken and Chilli fish (gravy). Although the ambiance is nothing to write home about, each and every thing on the menu was tasty, served really hot to the table, and perfectly cooked. Our bill, for the carnage, was around 500/- so I consider that money well-spent for two people who rolled out of the place with a package of leftover fried rice and fish.

It might be tiny but it excels at what matters the most - the food. Had ordered a bowl of mixed rice noodles along with sweet and sour chicken. Unless one is a starving, and I was, the amount of food served was much more than enough for a single person and at a just price. And the taste, the noodles were simply delicious and the chicken wasn't bad either. However the restaurant can do with a bit more ventilation, it's kind of stuffy inside.

this food joint is located just next to coffee house jadavpur, 8b. its a small joint and not so crowded. ambiance is average. we had Mixed Szechuan fried rice and thai green curry fish. fried rice was not bad but amount was not so good. it was tasty which i must say. fish item was not so good. they used too much cornflour coating to make these fish pieces large and they used only green chillis instead of capsicum and other vegetables. overall its a mediocre food joint in my view.

I visited the restro on a friends birthday treat and when we walked in for the first time I was like meh! The restaurant is up a dingy staircase at the CIT market building in jadavpur. The insides are cramped, poorly lighted and certainly lacking in ambiance. However, Blue Lagoon managed to surprise me with the food. Yes, it was not mind blowing, but the food tasted just as decent chinese food should taste. The soups were light and tasty, the rice cooked just right. A small warning, they do tend to use a lot of oil for a chinese restaurant. 

After that experience I have been there several times. I would recommend the Blue Lagoon Special Fried Rice with pork, Chilli garlic Pork (Dry), Roast Chicken and the Canton chicken. I once tried their Thai Green Curry fish but found it bland in taste. The fish also seemed soft and overcooked. Overall Pork dishes seem to be their one claim to fame. Summary:  A decent budget restaurant with good pork dishes to offer.

This place is full of memories for me. I've been coming to Blue Lagoon for the past 14 years, and very little has changed since then. And that is a good thing. The decor is Okay. The terracotta tiles were not always there though!
Why would you want to change something that is so good in the first place. And I am talking about the food. I've seen the same menu since the last 13 years, and am yet to exhaust all the options. This is one of the first places in Jadavpur that was bold enough to serve Pork. They make a mean dry chilli pork.
The mixed yemen and the Blue Lagoon Special Chowmein should definately be tried. The chilli garlic chicken and the Blue lagoon special crabs are just yumm <3 .
Blue lagoon may not be Mainland china, but for me it will always remain special. Try it, before it changes.

Ok my first visit to Blue Lagoon was a hurried one where to get my project printed I had gone to Jadavpur and from there went to coffee house but sadly I was very late for the place. My friend had been very hungry so I decided to step into this place for a quick bite since my friend also had seen it being mentioned with some reviews in zomato.
Now the decor though not appreciated was very rarely done one. of course not the theme to go with a chinese restaurant but then when did people 28 years ago(yes that's how old it is) think of maintaining a theme.
It had a nice decor which is what mattered.
The whole decor was done of cane while the walls had terracotta styled tiles. Even the lamp shades were covered in cane stands. The tables had a red cover over it while the chairs were pretty new in style but made of plastic.
The thing I did not like was that it had a strange damp smell of a room serving food for years now and there despite being two A.C.s the room was not that cool.
Then why did I mark it a 3.5???
The look of the place tells me of a long history probably forgotten. It's just the feel of a place. 
The food was slightly pricy considering the decor and low lit lamps and strange smell but not that high considering it is an A. C. restaurant.
Had ordered just a plate of chicken pakora which was nice, juicy, had a nice amount of chicken on it and a nice soft cramp outside with herbs along with the coating.
The sauce was tomato sauce mixed with small cut onions, tomatoes, some chillis, onion leaves and so on. 
The effort put in was definitely worth noting and that is why it got a 3.5. Next time if I go to that side then I would like to try out some more items and maybe I will get to rate it higher.

This place make one of the best Chinese in the city. I love their Mixed Fried Rice. It is flavourful, light and the amount of  chicken ,prawn and pork they add is very generous. I also highly recommend their Steamed Momos, the Blue Lagoon Spl. Green Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken, the Fried Golden Chicken, the special Tangy Fish and the Chilli Pork. They also make a very good Gravy Chowmein. The Gravy is thick and smooth and very light on the palette. If you order one plate of any dish it is more than enough for two people. The prices are also reasonable. I would mostly recommend this place as a takeaway.

I had a lunch just a a few days agoon a friend's recommendation, but...
before that lets talk about the place. The position of the restaurant is pretty awkward! ambience is good, but I found it a little bit dark and can even make someone claustrophobic. Maintenance is poor. Even the psychedelic lights (!?) were broken. And and about the food! probably the chef has too much affinity towards corn flour! We ordered crispy corn, and they served fried corn flour! (dah) even all the Chinese dishes had a overwhelming amout of the same! Rice was greasy. Only thing was good was that lemon chicken (excesive corn flour again!) So my experienfe was far away from satisfaction!  2 is only for the lemon they used!

This restaurant is a small dimly-lit place located on the first floor of the CIT Market in Jadavpur, and possesses five or six tables. There is no ambience to speak of per se, though a small group can sit and enjoy a conversation in peace.

If the appearance of the place is ignored, then the food alone makes it worth patronizing. It is one of the few places in this neighbourhood that serves good pork dishes. However, items containing crab meat should be approached with caution. The service is slow, so time should be kept in hand while ordering.

The take-away/home delivery service is the best option available to customers. That way, the food can be enjoyed without having the dinginess of the place intrude upon you.

Read the reviews and had high hopes but it really didn't happen. The food was really amateur.

Tried their chicken hot and sour soup,drums heaven,singapore chicken,chicken fried rice and Hong Kong fried chicken.

The place was a turn off...Four confined tables,uncommodious and congested.

Food quality was okay-ish,reasonable pricing but the drums heaven dish was very spicy!

Staff amiable but service was pretty slow.The decor was simple and quite ordinary!

HUGE disappointment,boring food,lack of food variety,practically no desserts served!

Two Thumbs down..Wouldnt go back to this place!

Of the many, many Chinese restaurants I have been to in Kolkata (including some of the most expensive ones), I will definitely rank this restaurant within the top 10. If you do not care much about ambiance (this is a small dimly lit place) but only about good food at reasonable prices, then this restaurant is an excellent choice. It offers a wide range of dishes including crab and pork and most of them are not too far behind in quality compared to what it's much more expensive and fancier cousins has to offer.

One of the most underrated restaurants in Kolkata. The Mixed Fried Rice (w or w/o pork) and Chilly Pork is top of the pick. The Hot and Sour Crab soup is probably the best in the city and far better than chinepara. Although its dimly light and is small, the food served is never disappointing. There is a large variety on the menu card and is also very well categorised.

I agree with Kanishka more than Rai : not that Rai's point about small interior with dark decor is to be thrown out of the equation but it is the FOOD that ultimately triumphs in such hole in the wall eateries AND service.

My position: I am not a regular customer of Blue Lagoon as I do not stay in Kolkata permanently but I have been to the restaurant, ordered to eat, ordered to take-out, ordered to cater for a small lunch party from Blue Lagoon and they have been most considerable to my needs and special requests (more on this later).

Best dishes I liked at Blue Lagoon: Rice noodles (be it chicken or prawn), garlic fish and their prawn meyfoon soup.

Service / special requests: The manager of the place is very welcoming to special requests about the way food is prepared. I had ordered for a group of elderly people once and specifically asked them to put very less oil ( as less as possible) and not spicy. I was worried if they would actually deliver my message correctly and whether the preparation would be to the taste of everybody (both old and young). It turned out very good  - everybody praised it.

I don't accept your rating of 2 star that awarded Blue Lagoon. I find their Thai soup far better than what is served in restaurants like Kim Ling or Jimmy's Kitchen, two restaurant's that have for ages been considered among the best in Kolkata irrespective of any ratings. Blue Lagoon also serves a unique preparation that I am yet to find in any other Chinese restaurant in Kolkata, Yeamin. It's noodles served in a thick gravy. I like many regular custmers of Blue Lagoon find it absolutely mouth watering. Their chowmein & fried rice preparations too are delicious. They also serve delectable prawn, crab & chicken dishes. Your rating of this wonderful restaurant isn't fair at all.

This place serves more than 200 different Chinese dishes. The mixed fried rice is something all can try and the pork dishes aren't too bad . Its quite pocket friendly. But, the interior of this eatery is shabby and not at all impressive.  Its very small and hence can make the customers a bit claustrophobic . It needs renovation badly.
