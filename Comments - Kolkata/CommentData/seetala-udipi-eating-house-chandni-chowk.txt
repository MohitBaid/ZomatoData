One very small joint, this is owned by the same person who owns Madras Restaurant. Same quality food at a much cheaper rate. And yeah, the owner usually sits here so he ensure that the customers have a very hospitable environment. South Indian coffee is a must!

Some serious authentic south Indian food is served here. Some big south Indian names are located nearby but this place also stands out among them. Looks may be shabby and very old but food quality and taste is on which it gets full marks on.

Idly soft and hot everytime, Don't forget to order a sambar vada here, super hot and cooked after order. Never had this thick and soft vada before, ask for non dipped vada to feel the softness.
Dosa here is normal like everywhere. Coffee I tried was proper south Indian coffee hard and less sugar.
Wanna try their rice options and khichdi the next time I dine here.

Cheap restaurant without any tax,good place for south Indian food.Might have South Indian dishes @cheap cost and quick service.
P.S.- While paying bill,a fat guy who serves food will come,collect cash and while returning the change ask for tips from each and every customer

The southern dishes which they provide in this restaurant is absolutely less fatty as the time passes the rate of foods rises and the sizes of dosas and idlis reducing but still it becomes irresistible when you get the masala dosa in front of you with sambar dal & white sauce with unlimited quantity i.e they will immediately pour it into your container as soon it gets empty. The service is wonderful, just during lunch hours due less seats and more number of customers they delay in bringing what you order. Overall it is good and also by means of their foods it will make you feel that you are in Chennai instead of Kolkata by the very first bite of it.

Seetala Udipi Eating House is located at Chandni Chowk , Kolkata .

It's a place for snacks with sitting arrangenents.

Ambience is simple with quick delivery.

Tried sada dosa & dahi vada, which were decent and fresh.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Overall a nice experience.

Located in one of the lanes at Chandni Chowk, this place specializes in some regular South Indian snacks. I liked the Masala Dhosa here. The Idlis too were quite good, considering the fact that I am not much a fan of Idlis in general. The service was quick, and pricing seemed to be very much affordable.

The outlet was easy to locate, the navigation in Maps was sound in this case. The decor is more for passer by then usual restaurants. The service was quick though. We ordered for Upma and Rava Onion Dosa. The amount was matching the price effectively. Good choice for hungry and weary of the Chandni bargain.

A small eating house serving various South Indian delicacies. The prices are relatively cheaper compared to other South Indian restaurants closeby. The Rava Dosa is something you just have to try out here. Although the Vada was a disappointment. Overall, the setting is one that has been ideally made for the people in a hurry to reach their offices on time or on a break. Decent place, decent food as well.

I got to know about this place through zomato reviews. And since it had more than 3.5 ratings so thought of dropping by, it is located just after the main crossing of chandni chowk and if someone is not aware of this place there's a chance one would overlook the place it is so small. We ordered a plain paper dosa and dahi vada and I won't say the quality of food was great. It was very normal like any other roadside south Indian food stall.. Infect the price were not on the cheaper side for the two dishes we ordered it cost us around ‚Çπ170 which is not on the expensive side compare to other south Indian places. I won't recommend this place as neither the food quality was goof nor the prices are reasonable..

Have been visiting this place since college days, when used to frequent the Chandni Chowk market. The only change from then is they have renovated the place a bit and its cleaner now.

This is a place with basic, but comfortable seating. During summers though it becomes a bit uncomfortable as the fans are not overhead (low ceiling) but on walls.

Service is fast and friendly.

Though the regular items like Dosa, Vada and Idly are decent here, I visit the place mainly for their Khichdi and Curd Rice, my comfort food. What can be better than a tasty lunch for only 40 bucks!

Also ask about their daily specials. The masala vadas they make are good and also the sweets.

Okay,so this place is a small eatery located next to the E-Mall lane. Not tough to find. Non AC restaurant , so definitely pocket friendly. But would have been better if they had better fans coz you would definitely not like to have Hot Idlis n Dosas while Perspiring in the hot weather!
Coming to Food, Definitely NOT a recommended one for Sambhar Lovers! Sambhar was watery n Okayish. Would rate it a 2.5/5 . ordered Idly n Sada Dosa as Cheese Dosa wasn't available! Satisfied with the Food. Dosa was crispy n Yummy while Idly was soft and hot. A good place if you are looking for something budget friendly and in the Central Kolkata location. 
Not recommended on hot n humid days because if you switch on their side fans,your Dosa will Fly away! (that's what happened with me).
Happy Eatingüòò

Since the review is about food and not ambiance ...

The Upma - probably the best in Kolkata. Soft , succulent, pure ghee smell wafting - simply amazing

Ghee dosa - you can actually smell and taste desi ghee - forget the diet just a few times to indulge and one must from time to time. 

Ambiance - wooden tables and chair and no AC but who cares

This age old eating house recently got a makeover, making the place more welcoming. Reasonable price and tasty food is what we get inside. A masala dosa @ rs 60 is enough to fill one's tummy. Only there should have been more choice for dishes & the closing time should not be so early as 8:30pm.

A tiny yet tidy restaurant serving cool South Indian Dishes. Sitting arrangement is a bit on the downside, you tend to rub your sides with other customers sitting around you or you have to share your table with other visiting customer, denying you any privacy, afterall, this place serves like a canteen during lunch time. Their menu is displayed on the board on the wall inside which is viewable even from the street outside!! Utensils appears a bit oily due to repeated servings of dishes on them frequently and then washing them in a hurry. This is probably due to huge rush of customers who are office goers dropping by to have lunch. Their dosas are large yet light, unlimited supply of sambhar and chutneys, idlys are surprising fluffy unlike the other South Indian restaurants in kolkata which serves idly that are hard and like a lump of boiled rice flour. Even the Vadas are good and soft unlike the oily ones elsewhere. Poori-sabji is not bad either, they serve their "poori" with the Aloo Masala that they use to stuff masala dosa. Veg pulao is also pretty delectable for any taste buds. The coffee that they served here are unique in taste and is extremely hot like a volcano. Foods are really palatable overall. You wont be dissapointed at the least with the taste and the quantity of food served. The waiters are prompt and courteous and dont expect anyone to tip them, and if anybody does offer tips to a waiter, that person is appreciated with a smile and a word of gratitude. A perfect budget restaurant and also a perfect for a quick and short yet sumptuous lunch. Visit this place on a weekday lunchtime, you will feel its dynamic attitude and energetic rush of the office workers/bussinessmen of that area. Life never seems to stop, this restaurant serves like a "pitstop" of a racing car. Wonderful experience overall, visit this for a cheap yet healthy alternative for having lunch in such a busy and fast moving area.

Location: In the lane opposite to Anand Restaurant.

This small South Indian restaurant has been here for years serving the office goers with quality fare at reasonable prices.
Lacks on the ambiance part as is quite simplistic with a seating arrangement for approximately thirty heads.
Happened to visit this amidst work affairs over lunch. It has a menu hanging at the center wall and you got to order from there, no spectate menus available for tables. Ordered the following:

- Idli [2 pieces per plate]
The idlis were hot, soft and simply melted in the mouth. Great.

- Sada Dosa
Crisp and non-greasy. Great.

- Filter Coffee
Strong and aromatic! Great!!

- Special Chutney
Thick coconut chutney served with a topping of sputtered seeds. Tasted good.

‚Ä¢ The sambhar was hot and flavorful. The chutney was thick and tasted good.

The staff was friendly and served at a quick speed.
Prices were found to be pocket-friendly.

Overall a good experience.
- Would drop by in case am around in future.

Four star rating with respect to the quality served.

Intro: I was just passing by, couldn't resist,years ago,have had food here quite many times, and it was awesome always
Do not expect decor,but I love the ambience, neat and cleanliness sitting arrangements, simple yet amazing

Food :
Idli : In one word fantastic, the idlis are so soft and just melted my mouth. The Sambar is superb, full of vegetables, tastes awesome 4/5
Vada : Just perfect...crispy,juicy, super stuff 4/5
Staff : Quick at his feet, good 3.5/5
Overall - Do not expect ambience, but expect superb South Indian food - If you have been to the names like Banana leaf, you must visit this place !!! 

Update: Tried Upma today , very nice. Very recently had Upma @ Madras Tiffin. Comparison : @Madras Tiffin, the Upma s colour is yellow, here it's white. Found this Upma tad less oily than Madras Tiffin. Overall this is better. Sambar though was better @ Madras Tiffin.
Also had Sambar Vada , was very nice. 
Overall  - the previous rating remains !

Sitala udipi eating house is another legendary south Indian eatery, located in the lane right opposite Madras restaurant.

The place is small with long wooden tables that helps accomodate a lot of people but with a congested feel. There is no air conditioning as well. But that's the end of negatives, coz it does superbly in all other aspects.

The food is superb and very reasonably priced. The stuff is fresh and preparations are top notch, at par with the best places serving south Indian food in Kolkata. I love their upma, masala dosa, idli followed by the tea. The chutney and Sambhar are very well made.

Overall, the place serves amazing stuff but lacks the ambiance and that's why such pricing !!!
