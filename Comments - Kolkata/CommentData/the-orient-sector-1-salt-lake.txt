Been here on a Saturday for lunch. The ambience is really nice and the place has courteous staff. We opted for buffet, the starters were tasty but I expected a bit more variety, same is the case with main course. One suggestion to the team would be to work on the presentation and swiftness to make the place and food more attractive. 

Food & service = 3.5
Ambience = 4

Went to celebrate üéä New Year‚Äôs Eve with my better half as it has rooftop 
But the behaviour of some waiters were just hell 
Coming to the food itz great in taste but quantity is a bit less over all ok
But didn‚Äôt understand what type of roof top it was ü§î
So over all I will rate 3.5
Due to the behaviour of some waiters wont suggest to visit

Good food ! Tired Gai sai takrai with thai herbs 
,sliced chicken with black beans and mushroom and Ginger and pepper fried rice ,The Appetizer Gai sai takrai with thai herbs was deep fried but unlike other places where the chicken is coated in 10 layers of flour ,the chicken was very lightly breaded bt yet was perfectly crispy they won my heart right there and then the main course followed and overall it was a good dinning experience .

This is my second visit to The Orient chain, first was in City Centre II. We came back mainly for the Buffet. It was exquisite, and we had a sumptuous lunch and we loved it. Just loved it. A great way to start the New Year by visiting this place. 
Their Buffet menu is just awesome.
On my plate was 
‚Ä¢ Chicken Teriyaki, Cucumber Teriyaki, Soup with non veg crumblings, veggies of diffezrent kinds, some dipped in vinegar which comes in shot glasses. 
‚Ä¢ Next was starters of two kinds - Two non veg and two veg. The chicken dim-sum should have been steamed more , and the crispy chicken was too much fried. Couldn't complete fnurther. The veg starters were okay with the veg dim-sum being equally tasty. 
‚Ä¢ Unlimited fresh lime soda, I only took two.
‚Ä¢ Next was the Main Course , it was too many to remember the names so I just resorted to eating. I must say I did not like the lamb much but the Vasa fish and prawns compensated with it. Noodles and Rice were good so as some of the vegetarian items. 
As you can see my plate looks kind of empty because I was already full by the time I started on the same. But I did taste little of each. 
‚Ä¢ What is the point of coming here if you don't have dessert. üòÑ - Chocolate ice cream, vanilla flavoured ice cream, mousse, cakes were one of a kind. 
In short, I loved their ambience, food, prompt service and courteous manners of the servers. 
Thank you, you made my beginning of the year. ‚ù§

Had dinner here on new year's eve. The ambience and decor of the place is nice and classy- appropriate for a fine dining experience. The food was also well prepared. We started with the hot and sour soup with black muhsrooms. Would have liked more mushrooms in that soup as the title of the dish specially mentioned the mushrooms. We had sushi and mushroom wantons which were also good. For main course we had the Singaporean vermicelli noodles and a gravy with water chestnuts and broccoli. The noodles were good but the gravy can be given a miss. The highlight of the meal was a jumbo pot of teriyaki vegetables and sticky rice. It was just amazing. The service was good albeit a little rushed, maybe  it was due to the late hours or because it was the 31st of December. But overall, would love to try other dishes here as well.

After Many Searches on zomato we find this Restaurant on Zomato. Yesterday Night Means 31st December we went for Dinner. We expect too much from this restaurant as Zomato mentioned 4 Rating on this restaurant. We choose the buffet section & the food were pathetically tasted and also the service was Average. For the name of Starters they give only 3 Non veg and veg starters those are tasted Not that good. Then after that we taste the main course which was also tasteless and then finally deserts those are average. Overall the service & food quality is not value for money and instead they charged 1299/- + Tax. I don't prefer this restaurant for Fine dining.

A buffet meal amidst festivities is never a good idea - and the lunch buffet at The Orient stood on that.

It's New Year's eve, and I went for a lunch buffet at the said restaurant. The place was moderately filled, and though a reservation is probably not necessary, however to a group of 6+ it is recommended.
The staff is courteous, the service prompt and though the spread is modest, I was somehow disappointed with the flavors.

Starters:
1) Corn cutlets and dimsums - veg
2) Honey garlic fish and dimsums - non-veg
The fish I felt was too sweet for my taste, the dimsums very ordinary, the corn preparation however was good.

Main course:
1) Salads and soups - Didn't taste
2) Thai green curry - veg
Very well made, though the consistency was a bit light
3) Burmese chicken - the gravy was very tasty, but I think the chicken marination was short spaned. Hence the flavors didn't seep in.
4) Some prawn curry - bad. Bland and had the faint smell of prawns in it.
5) Lamb - Good

Desserts:
Pastries were moderate to good. Ice creams and darsans however was just right.

Suggestions: Try an a la carte instead. I have a feeling that it might actually please the taste buds more aptly.

Food: 3 on 5
Ambience: 4 on 5
Service: 4 on 5
Cost: Approx. 2000 for 2

A fine addition to the string of restaurants in city centre. We had the lunch  buffet. The starters were decent, the momos were not very impressive. The maincourse menu was really nice and they covered as many flavours of the orient as they could. Right from sushi to chicken in Burmese sauce, they had it all. Staff was courteous and service was great. All in all a good experience.

Tried today lunch for the first time in this place - well this thai Chinese restaurant on fourth floor in city centre 1 is worth paying a visit for the beautiful Christmas decoration !!
Ordered buffet !
4 starters were served - veg (potato & broccoli) salt pepper fried , veg momo , chicken momo , fried crispy basa fish .
Had to repeat the veg fries , fish - cause they were really awesome according to me !! complimentary drinks available were - lime soda ,coke , sprite

The main course included rice , veg dishes , nonveg noodles,lamb curry ,  chicken keema , basa fish stirred in soya sauce , much more tasty dishes ( can't recall the long names of each ) - both veg balls curry & fish curry were very tasty. There was flavoured water . Both veg and nonveg dishes tasted equally good !!

Dessert collection had warm crispy sweet flakes , mousse , 2 fruit pastry , icecream ( banana & strawberry flavoured ).

The decoration , service , ambience , taste of food all are very satisfying and wonderful .

I personally felt dessert section should contain some more dishes otherwise a nice place to visit with family and friends !!

Visited this place for office lunch... And it's perfect. The decoration, lighting and ambience was awesome. Tried their buffet menu. It was nice. Though I didn't like some of their items. Starters was great. In the main course fish item was very nice. But lamb preparation would've been better . Only desert, I like, was the live ice cream. It was delicious. Staffs are prompt but not professional. 
Just give a try . You won't be disappointed.

Zen like feeling with black and red interiors with widespread buffet lunch makes this place a must visit for those who prefer Thai-Chinese. The food could have been more warm and the staffs need to be courteous. Coming to the buffet- dimsums, crispy chilli baby corn, fresh lime soda( in the starters), Singapore noodles, green Thai curry, Som Tam, Veg clear soup, Chinese greens, Fried rice, hoin sauce diced chilli potato, Manchurian to Veg Japanese side dishes (in Main course), coconut cream tart, Cherry gelatin, Butterscotch and caramel mousse, mini pastries, honey glazed Darsaan with vanilla and Chocolate ice-cream to walnut brownie, the food was super!

Visited this place with few foodie friends for buffet lunch a few days back and had a great time .
The ambience is perfect and the Asian Cuisine spread was great . 
We started of have some soup and starters which were served to us on the table .
I mainly concentrated on the Chinese section for the main course with Hakka noodles , Fried rice and two type of gravies .
Then for desserts we had different fruit flavoured ice creams which was prepared right infront of our eyes and it was oh so yummy üòã 
The service is great and you should definitely give this place a try üëå

Went for light dinner as street food festival in cc1 already filled the stomach ..salads of chicken and raw mango in one; beans,peas,broccoli for the veg one ..salads were good particularly the non veg one. . As the combination of raw mango and chicken looked unique and quite a tasty affair . Adding to these shredded lamb with pak choi was quite nice . Although the use of burnt garlic in this was not totally satisfying as it clings in mouth .
Coming to decor was nice tidy affair with spacious interior and sofa and chairs available for choice .
Service was quite good and nice .All in all good family and friends resturant right inside city centre sakalake on top of haka . Keep up the good work

Situated on the 4th floor of the E block in City Centre Mall this place was on my wishlist for quite sometime. So i finally dropped in here a couple of days back for lunch. The place is divided into three parts - One is for Buffet, Other is for Ala carte and it has also got an open deck which somehow seemed much bigger in the photos given on zomato! Anyways coming to the ambiance and food quality it was good and the staff were extremely well mannered and polite. The Tempura Prawns were the pick of the lot and was unique and delicious at the same time. The others items were also decent enough. Pricing is however a bit on the higher side taking into account the decor and the ambiance of the place.  Apart from this there was not much to complain about and may be in the future i can drop here once again.

Dined at The Orient ‚Äì City Centre Kolkata last evening, four of us - courtesy my wife‚Äôs Nephew (PIKU).

Piku‚Äôs mother‚Äôs a Vegetarian by choice, Piku, my wife and me stoutly Non Vegetarians.

The Vegetarian Starter was a WOK FRIED PEPPERED COTTAGE CHEESE with tons of Mushroom and Asparagus, while it was Prawn Tempura for us. Both were superbly presented and tasted still better. The table accompaniments included speciality condiments ‚Äì Ginger in a tangy sauce, black beans in Olive Oil, Cabbage, Lettuce and Carrots lightly drizzled in Garlic Butter.

For the Mains, we opted for 2 Portions of PAD THAI Stir Fried Noodles with Nuts ( more chicken than flat noodles) with ONE portion of WOK Braised Lamb Slices ‚Äì delicious and filling to the brim; the Vegetarian choice was a full meal ‚Äì they call it POT BELLY and JUMBO SHARING (true to the name) ‚Äì THAI GREEN CURRY, ASPARAGUS, MUSHROOM VEGETABLES Rice ‚Äì served in a lovely bowl.

More was to come when it meant Desserts ‚Äì Coconut Ice Cream Combo was not available ‚Äì the Chef, Mr Ghanyasham Das came over apologizing and suggesting that we try a 2 dish Dessert ‚Äì a Jaggery based soft pudding with coconut based ice cream ‚Äì was delicious to say the least.

The food quality, ambience and table laying are at par with top-of-the-line eateries ‚Äì combine this with personal care from all (we were attended to be Mr Debapriya ‚Äì knowledgeable and eager to help)

The pricing is on the higher side ‚Äì but definitely one of the best fine dining options now in Kolkata!

Thanks The Orient for making the Dinner memorable

It was a meeting with a friend after many days. So we decided to visit this place for Japanese cuisine. 

Service - The staff was really polite and they definately knew what they were serving. The service was quite quick and prompt. 

Ambience - It was a dimly lit place with low lightings and a bit high music. The seating arrangements were quite awesome with the tables shaped like broken wooden flanks. The bar was really dark with no such decorations for any attractions. They had a television which showed films and cricket matches. 

Food - We had Spicy Tofu Sushi , Teriyaki chicken Maki , Steam Rice , Lamb in Chilli Hoister Sauce , Fresh lime soda. 
The sushi and the Maki was quite good with the fragrance of the stuffings coming out of them. But the real showstopper was the Lamb. It was tenderly prepared with all the ingredients perfectly arranged. Its taste was really good. The Hoister sauce was perfectly made and thus made our evening. Will surely visit again for more delicacies.  

The bill is given in the pics for better information.

Another new place added in my fav City Center Salt Lake. I just went for a casual lunch. Loved the buffet spread. In veg options, the sauted vegeies with garlic, veg sushi, grillled mushroom was good. In non veg thai green curry, chilli chicken, chicken momo was awesome. The ambience was vibrant with mix genre music. The sitting area is not too big but cosy. The service quality could have improved though. For example the starters were being served on the table but the speed was real slow. In derssert there was a coconut tart, it was salty but sweet, I just loved it.

Jumped on to the Orient Express as part of a gourmet event, and enjoyed the set menu on offer. We were 3 persons so decided to try out 3 different dishes each from soup, appetizer and mains section.
We ordered garlic coriander chilli soup with chicken, man Chow with crispy Noodle and chicken and Tom yum chicken soup. All three soups had distinct flavour, very refreshing, the man Chow having classic character, the lemon coriander was subtle and Tom yam ...sour and spicy...
Starters were sliced fish with roasted chilli and Sichuan pepper, spicy Sichuan chicken siu long bao and roasted sliced lamb with pak Choi and mushroom. Very impressive and decidedly the siu long bao stood out for it's neat subtle flavour, which was repeated generously by the Chef.
Mains once again had fish, chicken and lamb combo in the form of pan fried Sichuan fish dry red chilli and soya, tangra gravy chilli chicken and double cooked Ginger lamb with lotus roots...this was accompanied by fried rice and hakka noodles and the whole thing was served innovatively in bento boxes. The double fried lamb, even though a bit chewey was the best...crispy lotus roots providing an extra level of culinary high.
The set menu has a flaw...it is biased towards the Sichuan style and flavour, probably keeping Kolkata palate in mind...we we're enjoying the food but by this time was tired of the spicy dragons..
Coconut milk palm sugar custard and ice cream did the palate cleansing for us...bits of delectable tender coconut melted away leaving a feeling of supreme satisfaction...and contentment. we also tried old and faithful darsan but coconut icecream was the showstopper....
Chef Ghanshyam handholded us all throughout out culinary journey and the experience was richer because of his sincere efforts....

Finally, an oriental restaurant that is a crowning jewel in the City Center arcade, in terms of food quality, service (Ambuja hospitality is way ahead of others, believe me) & ambiance! The food tastes just right & the IndoChinese menu is extremely well prepared. I like how they specify the origin of each of the food item. However, they must include other oriental specialities such as lotus stems & baos & phos in different varieties & more exotic desserts so that it doesn‚Äôt feel all that limited. The staff is courteous and prompt, but certain elements of fine dining are missing in the presentation, such as hot dinner plates & mocktail glasses. Set the branding right & you‚Äôre all set to create ripples in oriental fine dining in the city!

Amazing food but ambiance does not match up !! 

Located in City Center, Salt Lake, The Orient is a nice restaurant. Decor is decent inside and place is comfortable. However the music is chaotic and does not stick to any particular genre. Staff is polite, prompt but I felt that the service lacked warmth.

Food was superb, portions were generous and ingredients top notch. Manchow and wanton clear soups were nice. Raw papaya salad was fresh and well made. Wok tossed noodles tasted good but chill basil fried rice was the star, one of the finest I have had in a long time. Stir fried greens in mild garlic was pretty good. However I was disappointed with fried ice cream due to overpowering taste of coconut coating which was not mentioned in the detailed portion of menu. 

Overall a great eatery at the price point, but could be insane for me if ambiance is improved.

Located in 4th floor of block e in city centre 1,this restaurant has replaced hussh...Thus it retains most of the interiors of the previous restaurant in the form of a lounge as well as outdoor seating, which is unlike their other branch in city centre 2..It's a nice cozy place with an impressive menu encompassing many chinese,japanese,thai and seafood items..Out of the items we ordered ,all of them were fabulous but some items which deserve special mention are seafood salad,chicken manchow soup,lamb is hoisin sauce,and finally the banofee icecream dessert..We were lucky to come here on diwali,so we could watch the fireworks (the lounge has a good view) going on in kolkata outside,while having delicious food..The service was also very good and the prices reasonable..Would definitely recommend this place

Located at 4th floor of Eblock(CC1). Buffet and ala carte both are available here. We opted for chinese buffet.. Nicely decorated place with good ambiance. But service needs improvement. Staff were very slow. We had to ask them for everything. 
Welcome drink was served first. We chose fresh lime soda over cold drinks. They served starters on the table.. Options were very limited in starter section. 2 veg and 2 non veg starters included veg and non veg dimsum, veg manchurian and chilli fish. Non veg dimsum tasted superb. Other dishes were also tasty. Can't say about veg dimsum as I didn't take that. Clear Soup was not satisfactory. Main course had many veg and non veg options including noodles,fried rice, different veg curries,paneer,fish and chicken. Fish item was awesome. I didn't taste other side dishes. So, don't know about those. Dessert had 4/5 options. There were 3 items of mousse with different flavours and all were good in taste. They serve ice cream in a modified way. 
It was really a good experience to have such good food with so many options at such a pocket friendly price (550 including taxes). Loved it.

Then they served four types of starters two non veg and two veg all were freshly cooked and served.. Dry chilli chicken, veg Manchurian, chicken momo and veg momo.... Among them the chicken momo was excellent and others were also good...

There were three types of salads one non veg and two veg options were there., soup was very clear!!!!!!!

In the mains fired rice, noodles, chicken two items and one fish item, panner and two more veg items were there.... All the items tasted very good, the fish preparation was special among them...

In the deserts they have three options all are good and ice cream.... Their ice cream tasted new to me... We ordered Mango and strawberry flavour...

All the whole it was a good experience...

The Orient is a restaurant which is not known by many so it is kind of underrated i feel, but it's worth every penny. Went there today for a sudden asian buffet craving. There are very few places in the metropolitan serving complete asian buffet except Mainland, Haka and the Wall. Being tired of them went on to try this one. They had two chicken starters and two veg starters all of them very pretty up to the mark. Main course they had two chicken dishes and a fish dish along with a paneer dish and three more vegetable dishes. The mains were accompanied with steamed rice and wok tossed noodles, the only disappointing ones. Noodles were bland and the rice wasn't steamed properly. The mains were so good that they made up for the disappointment. They also had a welcome drink along with the buffet. The desserts they had were Mango Souffle, which was great, Red Velvet mousse which was average according to me, Darsaan was as it should be and lastly live ice cream counter was icing on the cake. They had almost 7-8 flavors of ice cream being made in front of your eyes. Every of the flavors were delectable.
All of these just for 550/- AI
All in all its a great place for a lunch buffet, pocket friendly and ambiance is way better than the others.

We bought a nearbuy.com coupon for Dashami lunch and we had the buffet lunch at this place. The spread for the main course was good. The starter options were so so. I particularly liked their sushi and lamb dishes as the lamb pieces were well cooked and succulent. Price wise this place is on a bit higher side if compared with Chowman. Staff is courteous and the ambience is nice.

Went today to Orient in City Center 1, Saltlake for lunch.  We opted for the buffet here.  There were 4 types of starter including Chicken Momo, Saut√©d fish,  Crispy baby corn. The fish was particularly very tasty.  Then we moved to the main course containing fried rice, mixed veg curry, paneer curry, noodles,  chicken preparation,  fish curry,  prawn curry etc. They also served few salads and sushis. In main course the rice,  fish and prawn were really good,  where as I found the chicken was hard to chew.  Salads,  especially the glass noodles salad was mouth watering. At the end desserts were having mousse,  tart,  darshan and ice creams- chocolate and vanilla.  Each dessert but the tart was delicious. Loved the vanilla icecream. All in all a good place to have Chinese food.  Loved the experience overall.

We went to THE ORIENT during DURGA PUJA and the choose buffet over a la carte. Out of different veg and non veg food items, we were given to choose 2 veg and 2 non veg starter and were allowed to take plenty of other main courses from buffet with a complimentary beer. The starter was served by the waiters. But, out of all these the taste of the food was not so good. It failed to lit up spark in our taste buds while having the food. The desserts were really good. Although the ambiance was really nice with view of the surrounding makes it soothing.The service was also very good. Also good for groups, couples and kids.

Tried out this place on my most recent visit to Kolkata. They ambience was good. Wanted to have sheesha, so took the terrace sitting - not a good decision in hindsight considering the Kolkata heat. They have an interesting spread of dishes. We ordered a sushi platter which was quite good. In the mains we tried Narsi Goreng which was okayish. The shisha/hookah however was a disappointment. Not at all smooth and with too much of charcoal.
Overall an average restaurant - you won't be missing out on anything if you give this a miss.

It was a first time lunch date with my special person.
Hospitality and courteousness was impeccable and at the same time they arranged a special private seating arena for us in the open arena during the rush hours of Durgapuja.
The food quality was good. Specially, the bhetki fry and the lamb dish was delicious. Though we chose the Al-a-carte, but the buffer contents was also very good.
Beautiful ambience and presentation will surely melt your heart with a enchanting smell of seafood.
So guys, time for a bon appetite!

This outlet is way better than their CC2 one. Take a left from the Titan showroom in CC1, take the elevator to the 4th floor, and there it is!! The ambience is delightful. I was really short on time, hence couldn't go for the buffet. They have a pomfret starter which is really good. The chicken fried rice and chicken in black bean sauce were extraordinary! Give it a shot if you are in CC1 and in mood for some Oriental food!

Ambience is moderate. We tried pork, chicken and bhetki preparations for starter and all were pretty tasty. The wok  tossed noodles in the main course is a must try.

If you want to throw your hard earned money down the drain, this place should be ideal for you. I generally do not give such bad reviews on zomato, but this restaurant deserves it!

The service was pathetic & we felt insulted. The waiters lacked basic courtesy & were not at all co-operative in finding out a proper seat for ourselves. Their attitude was like "find your own seat, I don't care", when we were struggling to find a good seat. They outright lied to our face when they said that the corner seats were reserved, which were not. We opted for the buffet which was one of the greatest mistake so far. The food deserves a special mention, specially the chicken momos because you will get much, much better outside at roadside stalls. The fish starters were pretty ordinary and the main course has only 3-4 dishes. The chicken thai green curry was good, hence the rating 1.5 star.

City center 1 has a long list of other better restaurants, please don't waste your time on this. But as I said, it's your call. This review is purely based on our experiences. At least we won't visit here further, even for free food. It was a disaster!

After reading great reviews on Zomato, I decided to visit The Orient with my mother for dinner last night. The first impression when you enter the restaurant is great. The interiors are beautiful and the place has an old-world charm. Unfortunately, that is where the good part ends. The food is absolutely ordinary, bordering on bad. For starters we ordered Chilly Onion Pork and Prawn Tempura, both items "recommended" by the waiter. The pork was over fried, thereby taking away all the flavour from the meat and making the pork extremely hard and chewy. Moreover, the flavour of the black pepper was so overwhelming that after a couple of pieces it was impossible to eat it, and there was a strong burning sensation in the mouth. It felt like we were just biting into whole black pepper. We complained about the taste, and they immediately offered to get us a replacement of the dish, apparently with less spice/pepper. However, this version too was horrible, rather inedible. The prawn tempura simply lacked any flavour whatsoever. After the starters, we were so annoyed that we did not even want to order the mains. However, since we were really hungry we ordered just a plate of wok fried chicken noodles, as we felt that it would be really hard to go wrong with this. All I have to say is the noodles tasted like any other roadside eatery. I just have a simple point to make, fancy interiors and well-trained staff cannot compensate for bad food. Moreover, please do not promote a place as a fine dining and charge such exorbitant prices for food that is simply less than average. Maybe if you try out their reasonably priced buffet it will pinch your pocket. Just Maybe!

Went there for a buffet lunch.
First things first, the atmosphere of the place and its ambience and looks are great. Special mention for the black shiny plates and dishes which had a great look to it.
There was 2 veg starters and 2 non veg starters chicken momo and veg momo, baby corn and chilli chicken dry. All of them were great but the chilli chicken was just too awesome. 
Main course was great too with chicken fish and paneer dishes. The fried rice was not up to the mark neither was the chowmein. 
The salads was also not mentionworthy. The desserts were limited variety but overall a good buffet in Rs. 550 including tax.
Also the service was little slow.

The combination of black and red, doesn't it sound deadly! That's what The Orient has to offer you. The moment you step in you are surrounded by this striking colour combination, great music, great hospitality and superb food. We went on Sunday and had the weekend buffet. They served chicken hot&sour soup, crispy fried fish, hot steamed chicken momo for the non-veg starters and they were delicious! The main course included fried rice with veggies, noodles, Thai chicken curry, prawn with onions & bell pepper and Red Chili fish. All the dishes were superb. Especially the prawn and fish, they were mouth-watering!
The service was extremely warm, and the staff was extremely well-behaved, served us the starters and constantly asked us if we needed anything.
It was an absolute pleasure to visit The Orient and what's more fun is that they do have Happy Hours!!

I've been here twice for lunch buffet.
The ambience here is quite cosy and relaxing.
Starters are served on the table and you have to get yourself the main course and dessert.

Starters menu is quite lean.There was one fish dish,which I absolutely loved ,a veg kebab and chicken and veg dim-sums.
Chicken momo were a little high on ginger,I felt.It just wasn't tasty.

Main course was good though.Compared to starters ,main course menu was vast.
The salad section is interesting!

The best part of the lunch buffet is the dessert !However I was a little disappointed not seeing the ice cream rolls.Apparently they don't serve ice cream rolls on Weekends :( Too bad !
The lemongrass mousse was heavenly!

the Orient can be seen from hangout 3rd floor courtyard, and it does look pretty..and indeed it.
the ambience is outstanding and so is the decor..

but that's so much so,
the buffet is not recommended at all.
items are less in number and prepared averagely.
nothing is worthy mentioning,,
dessert section SUCKS
no variety,
SPECIAL ATTRACTION of the buffet is SUSHI,

ONE GOOD thing is that buffet food is always served hot as all the items are placed over a hot plate / induction

buffet not recommend at all

Our search for a perfect chinese restaurant ended up here. On the fourth floor of city center salt lake. We were four people and went for a Sunday lunch.. Now it was supposed to be 525 for a buffet lunch per head but due to friendships day they increased the price to 899 which I found was worth it. The ambiance here is perfectly cosy. The decor is an amalgamation of black and red which is quite oriental. The decor and cutlery was impressive. Now coming to the food. They served the starters on the table along with a complementary beer/virgin mojito. There was fish in sweet and sour sauce. The fish was fresh flavorful and really amazing...they had chicken dumplings which was again juicy and piping hot with the perfect blend of flavours. Now for the main course they offered a fried rice, noodles, prawn in garlic sauce, fish in Hunan sauce, chicken Burmese style, lamb. In veg they had pok choy, Thai curry, and Cantonese style veggies. There was an elaborate live salad section . they had chicken and veg sushi as well. Overall an elaborate spread (options were more than what we had in the most famous Chinese restaurant) now coming to the taste. The fried rice was beyond perfection. Again the fish was amazing , chicken in Burmese sauce was melt in mouth and perfectly flavorful . enjoyed every dish . the dessert had pastries and normal ice cream. They had a lemon grass ice cream which i was straight on the face horrible...apart from the lemongrass ice cream v had the most delicious food journey!

This is my favorite Asian restaurant so far. They serve you the best sushi. I went there on my birthday with my boyfriend who is really fond of sushis. The ambience, decor, lighting everything is just on point. We opted for ala carte and the bill was around 1900 for two of us including tax. The buffet price is quite less and would opt for it the next time we visit here.

I was in search for a good chinese restaurant near City Centre 1 and I decided to try this out.¬†
¬†
The lights are dim and relaxing which creates a soothing ambiance.¬†
The waiters are very prompt and courteous.
I decided to have a la carte that day and the food did not disappoint me !¬†
As soon as we sat down they served us with some accompaniments which were very tasty. ¬†
We had the chilli garlic noodles , shredded chicken in black pepper sauce and mee goreng. Everything tasted good , but the mee goreng was the best !¬†
I really liked the fact that they served us hot jasmine tea with the main course to wash all the food down.¬†
I must say that the presentation was really good and I did not expect it.
The quantity of the dishes is sufficient for two people. ¬†
The service was also pretty quick !¬†
I would love to go back to this place and try more food here.

The Orient is an epicurean experience unlike any other seen in the city. Its eclectic offerings in Oriental cuisine is one to satisfy your tummy as well as your soul. We tried everything from Japanese, Chinese and Thai dishes and didn't find much to complain about. The ambience is a typical Asian den with limited seating, dim lighting, shadowy red murals and the quintessential calligraphic Mandarin alphabet.

Coming to the food, we first tried the salmon sushi. I had never tried sushi before and my inexperience restricts me from giving a fair judgement. My personal opinion is that I did not find the taste neither unappealing nor fully appeasing. It was just fine and maybe this is how it is supposed to be. Then we had Gai Sai Takrai with Thai sauce and this brought my taste buds to life again. These crispy chunk of chicken were really delicious. The main course had a lot of variety and we went for their signature dish Stir Fried XO udon noodles. These long flat wheat noodles prepared in a spicy sauce with sauted babycorn is must try. We accompanied this on the sides with Wok braised lamb, slices of succulent pieces of lamb prepared in medium spice sauce.

The food doesn't come at a affordable price though and you may feel a pocket pinch of around 2k for 2 people with GST. But its definitely worth a go for the sheer brilliance of their gourmet.

One of the best buffet in the town, without a doubt. This is what buffet should be like. I have been to several buffets but it's always been the same, a couple of kebabs followed with the same biryani, fried rice, ice cream, etc. But its the first time that we were awestruck by the varieties. 

Let's get down to the point. The cost is 550 (including GST) and for this you get 2 non veg appetizers - Chicken momo and Dry chilli chicken (the show stealer) and 2 veg appetizers - Veg momo (surprisingly yum) and fried baby corn. All these were delicious. 

Then came the mind bending main course. It started with unique and tasty salads - a raw mango salad served in shot glasses and chicken salad served kebab style, that is, skewered with a toothpick. Followed by a veg soup with the toppings of your choice (boiled veggies and/or diced chicken pieces). This was good too. Then came the plethora of veg and non veg dishes. I apologize for not remembering the names, but there was true variety, ranging from a Burmese curry to a Chinese Cottage cheese dish. The non veg section had delicious balsa fish and chicken, accompanied by Burnt Garlic Fried rice and Veg noodles, needless to say both were amazing. 

The dessert section was delicious too - darsan, chocolate tarts, Mousse, Mango Pastry and the VIP the live Ice cream counter, which is ice cream made in Japanese style. If only I could upload the video of the Chef making the ice cream. It was very very good. The chef told me its only for a limited time period.

The service and ambience was very good. We were very surprised and happy, as everything feels amazing when you are with your family and good food and equally good music at an amazing place. I would definitely come back again. Please keep up the good work.

Located at the 4th floor of CC1, this restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Perfect ambience, wonderful service. Smoking area is separate, which is a boon. The food is not good though. We decided to try some starters and ice cream from the a la carte menu. But they failed to impress us. The quantity and quality of food does not match the high price that is set. Cash n card accepted. Might visit for their famed buffet though. But the price is a bit too much. And not to mention the misleading advertisements they placed saying "Buy 2 Get 3", but actually is "Buy 2 and Get 1 free".

We visited yesterday. Ordered an asparagus cottage cheese mushroom starter,  which was quite good. Khaosuey was good too. Our stir fried flat noodles was also quite nice. The orange fizz lemonade was quite good. We had to repeat this drink order. Icing on the cake was coconut icecream served in a half sliced daab. Couldn't take clicks as our phones were discharged. Decent ambience. Very courteous staff.

The Orient is an epicurean experience unlike any other seen in the city. Its eclectic offerings in Oriental cuisine is one to satisfy your tummy as well as your soul. We tried everything from Japanese, Chinese and Thai dishes and didn't find much to complain about. The ambience is a typical Asian den with limited seating, dim lighting, shadowy red murals and the quintessential calligraphic Mandarin alphabet.

Coming to the food, we first tried the salmon sushi. I had never tried sushi before and my inexperience restricts me from giving a fair judgement. My personal opinion is that I did not find the taste neither unappealing nor fully appeasing. It was just fine and maybe this is how it is supposed to be. Then we had Gai Sai Takrai with Thai sauce and this brought my taste buds to life again. These crispy chunk of chicken were really delicious. The main course had a lot of variety and we went for their signature dish Stir Fried XO udon noodles. These long flat wheat noodles prepared in a spicy sauce with sauted babycorn is must try. We accompanied this on the sides with Wok braised lamb, slices of succulent pieces of lamb prepared in medium spice sauce.

The food doesn't come at a affordable price though and you may feel a pocket pinch of around 2k for 2 people with GST. But its definitely worth a go for the sheer brilliance of their gourmet.

Great food. One of the best asian cuisine in town. The decor is very nice. It has a very high end look and service is very prompt. Regarding food, it is very tasty, though a bit spicy according to me, but overall very good taste. It is bit pricy restaurant though, would love it visit again.

One of the best Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. It is located on the 4th floor of city centre one. They provide lunch buffet at very reasonable price. The starters were so good. The non veg main course was better than the veg main course. Chocolate mousse, nutty tart, one pastry and darsan were in the dessert section. They have a live ice cream parlour where they make ice cream rolls. All of these food items will satisfy your taste buds. We also ordered teriyaki chicken sushi and chocolate bomb with wasabee ice cream. The foods were damn good. The staffs are very cooperative and attentive. Overall, it's a nice experience!

Orient is a new buffet eatery addition to City Centre at the 4th floor of Block E....Nice ambience and the quality of food available is good here . You get a satisfactory mixture of all Chinese, Thai and Japanese dishes.
I visited this place on a rainy Sunday afternoon with my friends...While roaming and shopping around CC1 we found this new restaurant and hence wanted to try it out... Well,the view is great from here and all the staff members are very helpful.The fish preparations are a must try here, especially the Basa starter that is served with the lunch buffet...it's delicious!!! The sushis are good to taste but a few more varieties wouldn't hurt...the only problem that we faced was the limited sitting capacity specially because we couldn't opt for the open air terrace due to the rain.
Overall it was a good experience for a first-timer.

The GST rates were about to take over and like many others we had no clue how much of a difference it was going to make, so we decided to eat out on the very last day of the pre-GST era. We chose the Orient, on the 4th floor of the E block of City Center, a place we had never tried before. As the name suggests, it serves Oriental food, so the lunch buffet was a mixture of Chinese, Japanese and Thai cuisine. There were 4 starters- a veg dimsum, which I did not try, a crisp potato in red chili sauce, (basically french fries tossed in a hot and sweet gravy) which was pretty good, chicken momos which tasted almost exactly like those you get on the Darjiling road side, and a crispy fish in a red sauce, which was the one I liked the most, even though it was slightly hot. A soft drink was also included in the buffet. The staff bring the starters to your table. They are extremely courteous, but very very slow. 
The main course included a Tom Kha soup, which had a coconut base and is supposedly of Thai origin. The soup was vegetarian with boiled chicken served separately if you want it. There were some more finger food alongside the soup which included a chicken and bell pepper in a skewer and a fruit salad. After the soup came a range of vegetarian dishes that included stir fried greens, cottage cheese, potatoes, etc. The noodles and fried rice were both vegetarian. The non veg side dishes included fish in Schezwan sauce, chicken in black bean sauce and a chicken and vegetables in white sauce. My favourite was the chicken in black bean sauce. I would have loved a second helping, but the serving bowl remained empty. I was assured that it would be refilled soon, but when that did not happen in nearly 20 minutes, I decided to give up and move on to the dessert counter. 
The desserts mainly included a wide range of cakes, pastries and mousse, all of which tasted satisfactory and none of which were essentially oriental. Besides these, they had darsan. The pride and joy of the place was the Tappanyaki ice cream which was basically frozen cream in a flavour of your choice beaten well and served with toppings.
The lunch buffet was priced at Rs 550 per person (Reminder: these are pre-GST rates), which was pretty reasonable. The food, though not brilliant, was not bad either. I will recommend this place if you are looking for pocket friendly buffets.

An impromptu lunch with my best girl.... We decided to try somewhere new... And so orient it was! They had a lavish lunch buffet... But the selection of starters could have been a little elaborate... There was just a fish and chicken momos in the non veg section, the soup... Tom yum soup was basically vegetarian, with a bowl of very dry boiled chicken morsel on the side for the non veg, there was two salads and one cold chicken skewers... Not bad... The veg selection I can't comment on except Chinese styled stir fried veggies which was rather good. The non veg section consisted of schezwan fish, chicken in black bean sauce which was Delish and chicken in a white sauce with capsicum... Nice... The dessert section was darsan, some miniature cupcakes which I didn't sample, a raspberry mousse... Satisfactory, and there was a Teppanyaki ice cream bar... Which was catering icecream made to choice!!! The food over all was good... The only problem was the service was way too slow, perhaps the staffs inexperienced. Moreover the food was often not present at the buffet spread and the staffs ran helter skelter trying to replenish the empty bowl... Take care of the service folk and you deserve a 4.5* . The restaurant is pocket friendly and I loved the galangal and kafir lime leaves infused water....

If you want to have fuss free good Chinese food, then The Orient is the place to be. The d√©cor is pretty good, the usual combination of red and black which most Chinese joints are operating under. They have outdoor seating for the cooler days. Coming to the food, we decided to go ahead with the buffet spread, which had a variety of veg/non-veg starters, rice, noodles; three types of veg and non-veg mains each and an array of desserts. For a buffet meal, the food was cooked to perfection. The sushi was especially good. The staff was courteous and the service was very good.

For a good meal which will go easy on your pockets, a visit to The Orient is a must.

This restaurant is situated on the fourth floor of E block of City Centre.
The ambience is nice. They have 3 separate places: ala carte, buffet and a balcony.
We had opted for the non-veg buffet menu.
Soft drinks/fresh lime soda is complementary.
For starters they had Tom Yum soup. We added the chicken to it as per our needs. The soup was tasty. Next they had assorted vegetables, pan fried chilly fish and both veg and non veg momos. The fish was spot on. The momos were not that good.
For the main course they had, veg fried rice, veg noodles, one fish item, Kung pao chicken and another chicken preparation. Again the fish and the chicken item was good (not the Kung pao chicken). For deserts they had 3 varieties of cakes, 2 types of mouse( the red velvet mousse was again spot on).
They had a live ice cream counter serving ice cream rolls. We had chocolate ice cream rolls but the flavour was not at all good. It was tangy and smelled as if the ice cream was kept in the freezer for days.
Otherwise, the place is a must visit for all Oriental food lovers. Will absolutely visit again to try the ala cart√© menu.

We ordered non-veg maki sushi both with salmon & teriyaki chicken as our starter & fried ox noodle(Japan) & shreded teriyaki chicken(Japan) as our main course alongwith chilled beers. The service was pretty quick & very nice.
One must visit this place not only for the food but also for the ambiance & the view.

Well it's gonna be a long and detailed one. We had gone for their weekday lunch buffet. Ambience is good, giving the impression of a good Oriental restaurant. There were 2 veg starters and 2 non veg starters, soup, salads, a veg rice and a veg noodles, a couple of veg main course preparations and three non veg main course items. There were also 4 types of dessert along with a live ice cream station. Service was quite slow as they took quite some time to serve the starters and clear the soiled plates. The complementary glass of fresh Lime soda was pretty disappointing. It tasted like sugary soda and had negligible flavor of the lime. Most of the items on the buffet were quite delicious and better than expected. Although the fish starter was a tad too oversweet and the salads weren't upto the mark.

Now coming to the biggest problem we faced. They ran out of chocolate tarts, 45 min before the closing time of the buffet. That is just sheer negligence. And to compensate for that the staff came up with two small glasses having small pieces‚Äã of Chocolate cake drizzled with a hot chocolate syrup. It tasted okay but I really really wanted to have the chocolate tarts. My whole experience got spoiled because of this incident. Also the size of the chocolate ice cream went on getting smaller and smaller with time, probably they ran out of that too. I'm‚Äã in two minds about this restaurant. I would like to visit it again for the food but I would not want to visit it ever again because their food keeps getting running out and in a buffet, it's pretty irritating and disgraceful.

Went for the buffet lunch today. There was a welcome drink (soft). Starters in the form of crispy chicken, corn fritters, veg ad chicken momos and veg and chicken sushi. Starters were ok. There was no explosion of any flavours to report.
The soup was veg hot and sour. If you want non_veg you have to add chicken cubes kept seperately. The soup was ok. However adding chicken cubes in a veg soup is not as tasty as that of a chicken soup cooked in chicken broth.
In the main course there were veg noodles and fried rice. 3 veg dishes and 3 non-veg items.
There is nothing nice to write about the fish and prawn dishes. However the green chicken curry was the saving grace. It was quite tasty.
There were 4 items in the dessert section and Ice cream. It was ok. However the su chef preparing the ice cream was very slow and the service of ice cream was totally mismanaged.
The total experience was not very pleasant.

Recently (30th May) went to this place for a buffet lunch with my colleagues...initially we had planned to go for another restaurant in the same location, however as soon as we were approaching the elevator one of the representative of the restaurant convinced us to explore their newly launched lunch buffet...so we took the chance...at a price of around 550 (with taxes) the spread was very minimal....the salad & desert section was almost non existent...very basic side dishes 1 fish & 2 types of chicken...the rice & noodles were all veg & very basic...taste wise none of dishes could leave any mark...over & above once we finished our meal it took another 45 minutes to make the payment since we were paying via corporate card(though when we had checked while entering whether they accept that type of card, they readily said yes)...most importantly when we gave our candid feedback about the food, the person on the floor came back to us & asked for justification of such a review & almost pestered us to change the same...not sure why then we were asked to give feedback on the first place....not sure abt the A-La-Carte food, but if you intend to visit for buffet it is a big no no...

A far Cut above the Usual Chinese Fare we get in Kolkata ...with extraordinarily great service. The multiple sauces , the extraordinary amber cutlery , the extremely attentive staff and most importantly strange & unique food from all parts of the Far East....it made the perfect family experience. Vegetarian fare never tasted so good. A special thanks to Chef Das for training us in the art of using chopsticks and Gurtek the Manager for looking after us . Must try is the Oriental deserts ....They are both artistic and tasty.

After looking at a few pamphlets of The Orient we decided to go for their Sunday lunch. I had heard that they serve sushi and was looking forward to that in particular. We started with the soup and starters which were pretty good. Though the sushi had intense flavors and was freshly made,  it wasn't authentic,the sushi was made with chicken instead of raw fish and the Wasabi was not as strong as it is supposed to be. The main course was really good.  The flavors of each dish was different from the other. The biggest disappointment came to me with the dessert.  As I was looking forward to the dessert, I had great expectations.  But with the first bite of their chocolate tart I found a pathetic smell in it.  I soon realized that each and every dessert had a bad smell.  It was the smell of something kept open in a stinking fridge. Instead of the usual ice cream they had kept a counter for ice cream rolls(which is the latest food fad).  Though the counter looks very attractive.  The ice cream rolls were not upto the mark as the base was not very cold(we had to have melted ice cream). The only reason I give this review a 2.5 rating is because of the dessert that spoilt my while meal.

Authentic Oriental Delights @ The Orient, City Centre I, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Event: Bloggers & Press Meet followed by Lunch Buffet

Having established itself successfully in City Centre II, the recently opened The Orient at City Centre I (CC-I) is a harmonious amalgamation of restaurant, lounge, terrace and deck.

Located on the 4th floor of E block of CC-I, The Orient is quite well equipped to cater to your needs of - quality Oriental cuisines, relaxation and partying. Mostly hued in red and black with Oriental style interior, The Orient's seating arrangements are in the form of chairs and sofas. Wooden top dining tables are shaped in squares. Crockery is heavy and black ceramic.

Primarily comprising of Chinese, Thai and Japanese dishes, Orient's menu card also lists few Indonesian, Vietnamese, Malaysian and other cuisine dishes.

A showcase of few of the aforesaid cuisines is presented everyday via the lunch buffet. The buffet table is big, T shaped and wooden topped. It is laden with almost equal number of veg and non veg dishes.

The vegetarian options in the lunch buffet basically comprises of - soup, salads, starters, beverage, rice & noodles, assorted vegetable preparations, desserts and teppanyaki ice cream. The Sushi Counter operates only on the weekends.

Starters are prepared fresh and served on the table. You also get to choose your choice of aerated beverage, including sweet lime soda. Rest all the items fall under the self service category.

Thanks to the management, we were pampered with a sit-down dinner. Along with the available buffet items, a couple of additional menu items were also served.

My vegetarian food experience comprised of -

Soup -
- Chilli Coriander Soup

Starter -
- Tofu
- Dim Sum
- Sushi
- Pickle Radish
- Wasabi Peas

Beverage -
- Watermelon Mojito

Rice & Noodles -
- Stir fried XO Udon Noodles
- Sticky Rice
- Wok Tossed Hong Kong Noodles

Main Course -
- Assorted Mushrooms
- Hokaido or Veg Mock Meat
- Broccoli With Mushroom, Babycorn In Sambel Sauce
- Assorted Vegetables In Thai Green Curry
- Stir Fried Chinese Greens
- Potato In Chilli Basil Sauce
- Broccoli, Long Beans, Carrot, Bell Peppers With Japanese Mayonnaise

Dessert -
- Brownie With Peanuts
- Lemon Grass Style Mousse
- Teppanyaki Ice Cream or Ice Cream Rolls - They are prepared live on a -35¬∞C girdle. You can opt for the flavor of your choice. I opted for Strawberry flavor!

Needless to say, that this was one of the most authentic, tasty and varied Veg Oriental Cuisine that I have ever had in my life. Udon Noodles and Mock Meat (soyabean based) were first of sorts for me. I liked them both. Each and every vegetable preparation tasted distinct and constituted of excellent quality vegetables, including mushrooms. Even the soup was quite clear in consistancy, with a nice coriander flavor.

In fact, I liked the whole experience so much, that couple of days back i.e. around one month after my first visit, I went for their lunch buffet on my own. I will blog about it later.

Lunch Buffet Price: Rs. 550 (Mon-Fri) and Rs. 625 (Sat-Sun) - All Inclusive

Ambience is nothing extraordinary !
Hospitality is truly impressive.
Food options were very less and not very impressive selection of spreads.


For the price tag of ‚Çπ550/- all inclusive a little better menu and taste of food is expected!!

Food didn't taste that good that one can recommend this place to others 
Quite an effort is needed to compete with other similar genre of buffet serving places !!

After much dilemma with the reviews of both the The orient.I thought of opting the weekend buffet menu of City centre 1 The orient, & with much relief & joy I would say I chose the right one.Situated inside the City centre premise in block E area 4th floor.The entrance itself has a Japanese style,inside it's really nicely decorated with wooden chairs,dimly lit lights above the tables.The walls have Japanese writings.music is also ok with mix tracks being played.The buffet table itself was really attractive to see.with Glass jars filled with veggies.shandeliers drapping down at the cloches.so a 4.5 out of 5 alone for the ambience.Coming to the service yet again the scored a perfect score.special mention for two persons Debopriyo & Thier chef for live Shusi counter & ice cream counter Sanjay.they both were very good.
Service by Debopriyo was top notch.As the pace of the service was not to fast nor to slow.Also he was very polite and friendly.so a perfect score of 5 out of 5.Coming to the foods it was not a long list but the taste were very subtle & to the point.each items had its own taste none of them were baring same taste.They had 4 starters,2 veg 2 non veg,Started with crispy baby corns & chicken tossed in black sauce.corn were sweet and went well with the spicy chicken.Then they had Veg domain & chicken momo.with sweet chilli sauce.They had Hot & sour soup if you want you can add shredded chicken in the bowl, for salads they had vegitable tossed salad,assorted fruit salad,and minced chicken salad in Thai way.the chicken salad was bit tangy taste with tomato sauce.coming to the sushi they had chicken uramaki(non veg) & Kappa maki (veg).Chicken uramaki was coated with tosted sesmi seeds and inside there were chunks of chicken,on the other hand the Kappa maki was wrapped with nori and inside it had pickled cucumber.they were served with wasabi sauce,Gari(sweet pickled ginger)& a pungent paste taste like mustured.coming to the main dish they had
Veg fried rice & noodles.3 veg shide dishes & 3 non-vegetarian side dishes.in veg they had saseme honey chili cottage cheese, potato corn in hot garlic sauce & vegetable Thai masala curry.non veg they had one fish,one chicken & one lamb dish.lamb was my pick of the day it was Hong Kong style rosted lamb with bokchoy.They had variety of asorted desserts,mango mousse,lemon tart.But in dessert the main attraction was Teppanyaki ice cream.Chef Sanjay takes spoonful of cream on a cilll blaster top mix it with different flavours and creates the the ice cream in front of you.It's a must try.another perfect score of 5 out of 5.keep up the buffet menu.would love to visit again to try some other dishes.A must try place for all.

This is a new outlet which is situated above citycenter Haka. I tried their weekend lunch buffet which comes for Rs.625. The buffet spread was wide and had a lot of variations...starting from paneer to prawn. The ambience is amazing and staffs are very well behaved. The buffet spread even had veg & non veg sushi options. The starter and the dim sum was good. Main course was amazing, much above what i had expected and desert section was equally good, they even served ice-cream rolls of various flavour. Also, there a complementary beverage and jasmine tea which was included in the buffet. Overall very good.

The buffet spread is quite extensive considering the fact that they charge Rupees 550 all inclusive taxes for the weekday buffet. The starters were quite delicious especially the fish in schezwan sauce and the chicken dumplings. The chicken was well cooked in the mains section and the desserts had a wide range of flavours

Went to The Orient with my friends for lunch today! We had opted for the Non veg Buffet. Coming to the interior, it was nice in short. It had Chinese/Mandarin or something of that sort calligraphy on its walls.
The sitting chairs were closely placed and it was difficult to move in or move out.
We were welcomed with Jasmine tea, which was way too bitter. Coming to the starters, there were Crispy Chilly Potato which was good, Chicken Dumpling...it was fine as well, Veg dumpling. Umm..okayish and Fish in Schezwan Sauce. It was the best! I probably had 10 of them. It was that good! And we had complimentary soft drinks as well..but it was for a single round only. We also had Grilled chicken sausage salad. It was very tasty as well and an item called Som Fom Salad..which was basically tasteless and repulsive. There was fruit salad and soup as well, but I skipped that.
Coming to the main course, there was Veg Fried Rice and Veg chowmein. Veg side dishes included Tomato with Bamboo shoots, shallots, onion in Massaman Curry (they had a typo in the name there), Garlic cottage cheese with scallion; Brocolli, mushroom, baby corn and black bean sauce and cabbage with cherry tomato. The non veg sides were Schezwan fish dipped in schezwan sauce, Thai Green Curry with chicken, Dried Chicken Hunan Pepper Sauce. The thai curry was good. Schezwan fish was okay too. Didn't quite like the hunan one!
Coming to the desserts, there was Darsaan which was very tasty. The bengali equivalent of it is called goja. And there were Ivori slice and Kafil Lime Slice along with some assorted desserts. There was a live ice cream counter as well. I had one kiwi and one green apple ice cream. They were quite delicious. But the chef-in-charge seemed a bit sloppy in the beginning as he dropped my friend's ice cream. Poor girl, she had to wait for another one. Sad. Anyway, the staff were always on their feet. They were courteous and professional.
Overall it was a nice experience. The starters took a bit too long to refill. Maybe they can remove so many veg items and introduce some non veg ones. Having more number of veg side dishes and then veg rice as well as veg chowmein in a non veg buffet looks a bit out of place. The non veg items were actually outnumbered by the veg ones.

Asian food has become very common in kolkata now stretching beyond traditional chinese. This joint at city centre e block gives a perfect example to it. I will point out the really good points first.
Ambience- as usual a asian theme with chinese/japanese script (not sure) written all over the walls. Designed oil tumblers hanging as well as aluminium plates above. Sitting arrangement is okayish.
Food- we went for a weekend lunch buffet
Cost ‚Çπ625 all inclusive per head
They have a soup in a big pot with vegetables as well as shredded chicken separately- so you can make it veg or non veg as you like, the liquid in the pot doesn't contain anything except the flavours.
Starters are 2 veg and 2 non veg items- we had crispy baby corn, pepper chicken and both veg and ckn momos. Taste the sushis they are making fresh with a tangy and hot paste.
To the main course they have 3 veg and 3 non veg variety of dishes with rice and chowmein item purely veg. I liked the prawn a lot, so was the chicken.
On dessert they have assorted things- on our day we had apple pie, white chocolate tart.
To the ice cream zone- they have a live counter like mixong cream with the flavour of your choice and over a frozen tava they are making a roll out of it, looked good but tasted average.
Points against- service is very slow, often food gets over and replacement time is quite extended. 
Being a small place that live ice cream counter makes sound in such a decibel as if hammering a rod or steel plate. 
Otherwise a fine place to dine, though i feel the price they take, better places are there around in same category.

For lovers of authentic Oriental cuisine or any food fanatic, one of the finer choices to opt for in the city.
Spanning across exotic Far East to South East Asia, they dish out choicest culinary delicacies that are unique in themselves.

We ordered the lemongrass tea - served from a dainty teapot into small glass cups - that wasn't the regular tea one sips elsewhere but very exotic. As a tea fetishist more than a coffee junkie, I found it to be very unusual tasting yet richly appealing.

The sliced chicken with black bean sauce and mushroom - a Chinese dish though do not remember correctly - along with veg hakka noodles was a superb combination, with unconventional tastes and an array of sauces to choose from which the server announced while presenting them in black square boxes on a tray. 

In all their deliciousness, the chicken and noodles simply blowed my mind away. People accustomed to the spicy Indianised Tangra-style food may not prefer or take a liking to their items, but those with an adaptable palate, a gluttonous appetite and a  penchant for food would surely appreciate the departure from conventional Chinese dishes into gourmet Asian cuisine.

One can even have their food with chopsticks provided at the table.
The staff are courteous and polite, while service is speedy and efficient.

Equipped with a romantic mood, an ambiant setting and dimly-lit interior with Oriental decors, with red, grey and black being the dominant colors of this classy sophisticated restaurant, located now in CC1 with another earlier outlet in CC2, The Orient promises a rewarding gastronomic journey for epicures and ardent foodies.

Had gone for buffet. Really not worth the price. Choice of dishes were very bad. Flavour- i cant explain how watery it was ! Soup and gravies both ! The desserts only had coconut flavoured stuff. Incomplete servings. And the icecream was also tasting like frozen water! Waste of money. I have stopped trusting oriental food and flavours after eating here !

This has place has recently opened in CC1.
I have tried the cc 2 outlet and was not impressed
But this one is good and if they maintain the standard 
Will make a name in SE Asian cuisine.

Decor: the terrace on . Weekday evening was heavenly . No crowd and a awsym breeze. Gr8 music and perfect lighting read romantic. Full marks here

Food: started with chkn sui mai which was xcellent along with the 3 dips.
Followed this with pad thai and the chef was gracious enough to prepare it the way we like it. The ingrdients and herbs are super fresh.
Had tepinaki ice cream fir dessert

Sevice:  one of the best services i have seen in recent years, they know the dishes ate very polite and attentive. Keep it up guys

Going back again for side dishes and more xplorarion

If someone makes authentic Chinese and Oriental in the town it has to be The Orient@City Centre1.

Pomfret cooked with assorted vegetables and mushroom with a smooth blend of garlic marination and soya makes it a signature dish specially prepared the Head Chef.

Chef Tamang from Darjeeling was extraordinary in cooking prawns in garlic sauce accompanied by pockchoy and freshly imported  mushroom which loads of medicinal value to our body metabolism.

There is a drink bar where green apple mojito is the best you may taste.

Simply amazing and more to come.

As always, I return back to this place whenever I am there in City Centre 2 but now this place has newly opened in City Centre, Saltlake. My absolute favorite restro of all time. They have a rooftop for party of 30-40 people. The manager was kind enough to make us tour of the entire place.
Loved the food always and like always, this time also they nailed it.
Must try the Teppanyaki Ice-cream which was heavenly.
Tried the buffet too which had a very good spread with great taste which cost 550 inr inclusive tax

This is probably the only place in Kolkata that serves a wide range of mock meats. Their pot belly meals in a bowl is a selection of Oriental culinary art from another level of gastronomical excellence! Live sushi bar to begin with and teppanyaki ice creams to end it all, makes your memory at The Orient an indelible imprint of pure happiness and satisfaction. Orient - well done!!!! I AM A FAN

Orient is probably serving Kolkata s best Oriental foods now. Been there twice and liked each and every item we ordered. Their starters are awesome! Specifically Sea foods, lamb, pork items. Pad thai, udon and wok noodles are very good. But best part is desserts. Coconut ice-cream and hot melting chocolate pudding with wasabi ice-cream is a must try. Staffs, waiters are very polite, ambience is also good. They have terrace as well.
