The new addition of fried chicken is really awesome . The other preparations are also good in taste . Biriyani is awesome and the best biriyani in howrah ‚ù§‚ù§

One of the oldest biriyani and roll shops in Shibpur . Have tried their chicken and mutton rolls. Both are good and available for a low price. In my opinion mutton roll for 35 rupees is really a bargain. Recently tried their biriyani and chicken chap. Taste was good. Quantity of biriyani was almost enough for two people. The high rating is mainly because of the price and food quality. I would not recommend this place for a dine in though as seating arrangements are not good. Recently they have started serving fried chicken items though have not tried it.

Was one of the legendary Biryani makers of the region..

Now the quality is no match to its previous glory.. The rice is adequately tasty, nothing extraordinary.. The chicken /mutton pieces are okayish at best.. Though their mutton roll are one of the cheapest and most value for money product but their biryani is no where near their previous glory..

They should start improving soon

They serve some lip-smacking mutton biryani at such a reasonable price. I had once brought mutton biryani from this joint and just fell in love with it. Will definitely try out other foods from this place again ‚ù§Ô∏è

Earlier 'twas good. But day by day the food quality is degrading. Recently I had Biriyani over there, quality is too poor. Dont know about other items.

One of the well known places in locality ... They are specialized in biriyanis and those are really very good to taste ..... But the only problem is that they don't have place to sit . But the food quality is really good and value for money .

Very good value for money. This used to be a mutton shop decades back but they smartly reformef themselves into a take - away counter in the evening and keeps on selling meat in the morning. Rolls, kebabs, chaap, paratha and biriyani. I will make a social mention of the rolls and biriyani. They are tasty, hot and quite hygienic for its kind of place. Last bit bit the least, excellent value for money.

The place holds a good name for their mutton biriyani. You wont like it unless you are an ardent fan of biriyani and those who dont mind to have it from roadside! But above all taste of biriyani is good!

Good location. But doesn't provide sit&eat facility. The biriyani and the rolls are probably the best in that area. Very cheap and tasty. They also provide home delivery when you order a lump-sum total.

What can I say. Those who stays in Howrah knows Biriyani means Society. Although the quality of Biriyani is itself detoriating of this brand now, Still the quality of Biriyani it produces is much better than other brands... Few years back there was no one comapare to Society if the parameter was Biriyani.

If you do not like an after taste of dalda, do not have their biryani.¬†
Rolls are okay.
Price is okay.
Poor hygiene.
I would not recommend.

Well, their Biryani is one thing to die for. What a taste! Try their chicken chap aside a plate of Biryani. Besides they make very good egg chicken roll. Hygiene's not very good though.
This is one of my favourite take-away restaurant. Recomended!

Society is pretty much of a local go to spot for Biriyanis. I think that as a resident of that locality, if I want to celebrate something major or minor and I want good food, I would walk myself to society to buy their #chickenbiriyani  along with a plate of #chickenchaap and enjoy the mouth watering preparations. However it is best to take it home and enjoy the food as the ambience isn't good.
