Located in the vicinity of Bataitala Fari , this place is very close to the BE College guys. Be it for a casual booze with friends or with along the loved one, this place never disappoints us. It has a smoking zone also in the 2nd floor along with a special family zone separately. Its quality, service and food variations all are fine.

Quality - 4/5
Ambience -3.5/5
Service - 4/5

It was a friend's treat in this place. The ambience does not deserve a mention, quite literally. However, the service was very prompt. Their starters, especially dry Chilly chicken took us by a surprise. It felt way too good. The main course items are okay-ish. If you are looking for budget-friendly dining options, visit this eatery.

Have been visiting green valley countless times. Staffs are good. Good place for drinking alcohol. Foods are above average. But service is excellent.

Ambience is the worst thing about this place. Trust me...your own kitchen is nicer that this place! However, food served here is worth the price at which they come. Both food and booze are cheap out here, so you can always opt for a take away. Service is also on the poorer side.

I went to this place during my stay at IIEST Shibpur. A 15 bucks "toto" ride from IIEST took me there.
The interiors are okayish, dark gloomy ambience, yellow halogens, old Hindi songs playing in the background. 
We already had food earlier so went there for a quick sip n bite. 
Smirnoff and chicken reshmi kebab was our order. 

The kebab was delicious, like 10 points for the kebab.

And they provided "pickled ginger juliennes ,pickled small onions, rock salt and 'bhujiya' as accompaniments for the liquor.

Well, if I travel to shibpur once again I'll surely visit this place for the kebabs. Cheers!

Dark dingy ambiance, noisy crowd with some good view, thats the first impression about this place. 
The only plus point is that this is the only bar in the neighborhood. Nothing else worth mentioning about this place. Service and behavior of the staff is good though.
