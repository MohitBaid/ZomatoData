I highly recommend for those who want to try some new recipes apart from biryani, fried rice or normal noodles in very reasonable price.
Delicious dishes cooked with care and in very less amount of oil.
Tried Chicken Stroganoff, Chelo Platter, Chicken a la sac and Grilled garlic chicken noodles. Kababs were also lip-smacking. Most interestingly all the food are customisable, so that you can add your favorite item as extra.
Can't wait to try rest of the items.

The place is bit small for family/friends but the ambiance is quite charming.

Visited this small outlet couple of times, located near satgachi, this is a nice, small, pocket friendly place.Â  I have had their egg chicken pasta, chicken momos and also a combo dish including fried rice and chicken manchurian. Quality of the food is good enough to visit again for sure. Looking forward to my next visit. :D

We ordered chicken wok tossed rice from this place and it tasted damn good ! Most importantly , the rice , vegetables and chicken were fresh . They don't use much oil and spices and its simplicity in taste pampered our taste buds . The restaurant is a perfect example of good food at an affordable rate.Moreover , the delivery service being speedy , its charges are also minimum.

Looking forward to order again .ðŸ˜Š

Chicken Stroganoff was quite good so as fish platter but the quantity was low. But overall it's good and healthy.Iranian platter I would suggest not to order because the main grilled chicken were again low in quantity.

In my never-ending search of quality restaurants, I come across many varieties; some of them stay as first and last visit and some of them feels like to visit again and again. Well so far looking at the rating I have put against this place definitely gives you an idea that "Go Grillzz" falls in the second category.
I have noticed this place during my return from office. You need to walk around 2 minutes from Nagerbazar saatgachhi more to get this place, A very small but nicely decorated interior will first create a nice impression. Followed by the impeccable hospitality of the restaurant owner who is a software engineer by profession but got a nice thrive to grow thru. It was already past 9.00 pm and I didn't had any plan to skip my dinner at home so without much thought, I asked for chicken egg pasta. It took around 10-15 minutes to get served on the table when I had a nice catch up with the owner and her husband(co-incidentally we are from same organization).
The fuming pasta in a nice oval shaped plate was served, I got astonished looking at the amount - it was fair enough to feed at least 3 children/2 adults. Anyway, with the chit-chat between us, I finished the plate within minutes. It was really really awesome. The right amount of white sauce with balanced portion of chicken and egg made it more mouthgasmic.
I wish them all the very best for their future endevour.

The food is truly amazing. Very reasonable and has a very cozy ambience. All the dishes are delicious. The fried rice, chilli chicken is out of the world. The brownie is also too good. Best place to have continental food without making a hole in your pocket.

Everything about this new food junction is way much better than one can expect. The munchies are not only yummy but oil free too. Love their innovative items such as chicken a la sac, chicken stroganoff. Must try their platter as it's not only pocket friendly but good amount of proportion too. It's a must stop for people looking for good healthy & pocket friendly delicacies. It's yum yum in this locality.
