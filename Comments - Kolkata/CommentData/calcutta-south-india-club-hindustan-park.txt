Fantastic and cheap South Indian food available here. It's 90 years old. A must visit place for South Indian food lovers, indeed. Some of the items they offer you wont get everywhere in Kolkata because those are very much Southern delicasies.

"Dosa" is really tasty.
"Adai" is a bit sour.
"Tea" is awesome. Those who love milky tea must try.
The service is good, proactive and timely.

This place has finally been added to Zomato! I was a frequent visitor here one year ago when I used to stay in Hindustan park. There's something about this place. Really cheap,authentic, I repeat, authentic south Indian food , from idli dosa to lassi and south Indian thaali. Gives you the feel of south India and its exotic flavours. The ambience is simple, without fancy decoration but still lures you owing to its simplicity. The taste is 10/10. Do give this place a visit guys!

This place harboured and gave us food shelter when we first joined SRFTII. Our canteen served food which was inedible. Best way to lose weight might I add. This place was a 10 rupee auto ride away and was heaven as compared to the "delicious" fare in large aluminium containers that was served flies and all in our modest dining room. 
It had then, just basic South Indian fare but which was tasty, clean and ridiculously cheap. There was an unlimited supply of buttermilk which we then started filling in bottles and taking back to our dorms. 
Thank you south india club for taking such good care of us.
