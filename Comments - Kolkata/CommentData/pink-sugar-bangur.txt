Is 5 out of 5 enough? So I have been ordering cakes from Home based bakeries for quite some time now, and I am glad to tell you that PINK SUGER is THE BEST! The person baking is pretty awesome, and all their cakes are delicious and a must try ones.

Awesoem it was!! Pink Sugar has been sheer delight on the first visit itself. The Blackforest Cake we got was not only beautiful, but also delicious to the core. Everybody loved it so much that many enquired where I got it from. 
 I love n njyd the freshness and flavour in every bite of d desserts I had there, and I would definitely be back to try the others. My 2yr old daughter is 5 die-hard fan of d cookies v got her from dere.and I seriously don't mind serving her vth dose cookies.

Also, the service rendered is commendable and it is so good to see that they are top notch in maintaining hygiene.

So I ordered a 6lb oreo nutella cake for a baby shower party. And the cake was absolutely delicious. Then I ordered her an oreo cheesecake which I must say is the yummiest cheesecake I've ever had. Looking forward to order more. Thank you so much for such quality desserts.

Sexiest place to get pastries, cakes, brownies, cookies and what not.
