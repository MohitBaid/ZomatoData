A good club n hangout place ! The interior was good ! One of the famous and oldest club in Kolkata ! But the crowd was not really good ! Food n drinks were at a nominal price !

Two issues - 
Cockroach on the bar. On closer inspection found unoccupied bar area to be sticky and messed up.
Second, all their credit card machines seemed to be broken. Took us a good twenty minutes to pay.
P.S. : the prices of course continue to be "five star" while the experience is more like a roadside dhaba.

Horrible. Avoid. Both food and drinks are very costly. Food quality is pathetic. I don't know what's the "reincarnation" about. Service is OK, partly because we were the only one they had to serve for most part of the evening.

Heard a lot about this place since I was young. Not really worth a place. Went there for a company get togather, food is soo average. In Kolkata you can have better food with a street side vendor as well. Buffet had nans cold as ice without any proper layout.    When things get over on the counter you have to keep asking ppl to get the things and still they dont refil. Further tables are not cleaned. You ask for a specific drink and thwy give you something totally different. You ask the DJ for english songs he switches to punjabi from 80s hindi music! Really a bad experience..I would never recommend this place! Lot of better options are vailable in the city!

Good place in terms of music,  food and drinks that they offer at such a nominal price but crowd is a bit unruly and trash. So be careful when you plan to visit.

Under ground is without a doubt a very good place to hangout with your partner, small cozy space with a great ambiance. The dance floor is lil cramped up though.

The only good thing about this place was the waiters were polite and service was good. 
BUT
Hookah was bad. Food was tasteless, quantity served was very less. Pizza was good. Very sad music. Would not recommend any one to come here as its not worth the money.

Went to this on a sat night with friends.... hookah was nice . seating arrangement is better than before... and so is the ambience... but thats pretty much where it ends... food was disappointing and so was the service... chicken tikka kabab was chewy... pizza was ok... waitors kept on messing up orders... we wud order for mohito and they wud serve absolut... this happened on multiple occasions... no wonder the final bill was messed up and had to be corrected... would not revisit till the service and food improves..

We had a personal party at this place.
The ambience was nice, dance floor was good and the DJ was amazing.
Can't compliant about the service and food(starters) either.
They should keep it open a little longer in the night.

I  don't know what to say. At 8 pm on a Sunday evening, which was supposed to be a Salsa Night (God knows what it means), there were only 4 of us. Yes, FOUR! Waited 15 min for any other people to come, and then we left. This used to be a happening place. I  am unsure why they renamed it from The Underground to UG - Reincarnated? It's obvious that they have killed a perfectly good club, but it is still far from reincarnation
