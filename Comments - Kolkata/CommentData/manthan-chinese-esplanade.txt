Nice place for hang out with friends & family. Food is really good,specially the dried chili chicken,just love it! :) The attandace member are also good in behaviour. But the worst think is that it has not smoking zone. You have to go outside for smoking!

Manthan Chinese,
Huh..the more you say the less it is. I have never eaten better food anywhere else.among my favourites are red hot chilli pepper and chinoiserie but though chinoiserie is a five star hotel's restaurant it simply cannot compete with the brilliant food here. I would have given this place 6 stars on 5 if I had the option. The drumsticks are heaven and the chicken dishes are something you can die for. Totally in love with this place.
