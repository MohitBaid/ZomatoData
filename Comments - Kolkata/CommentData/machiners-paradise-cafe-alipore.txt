The bunch who gets fascinated by bikes and their spare parts should definitely visit this place!! It's a spacious Paradise for people who would love to be served on decks and wheels...
So I visited this place on 31st December and the things I observed were something like this. To start with-
AMBIENCE- way too spacious and appealing. I like the buzz boards that feature articles related to bikes as well as the pictures of all the sweet visitors to this place. I even appreciate the use of a tyre for the washroom basin. But I also suggest the mid portion of the restaurant can either be filled with some more tables or some game boards or pool boards. The gaming room inside the hookah parlour is well equipped. 
SERVICE- Poor. The individual serving us didn't seem friendly enough to come back and ask for our feedback. I kept searching for somebody to help me out with a replacement to my dish which was super salty. But nobody came up for any service. So, a bit dissatisfied in regards to the service.
FOOD- I came with a friend of mine. He ordered for a chicken steak sizzler and luckily he was blessed with proper flavours on his plate. It went good on his side. In fact he loved it. So a plus point for that. Kuddos to the chef who made it. But on the total opposite side, I ordered for green apple iced tea. It was amazing. I loved it. But just after that, I ordered for grilled fish with lemon butter sauce that was served with french fries and butter parsley rice. Fries=great. Rice=well done. Fish=horrible. I'm sorry, but it was not well done. Moreover it was cooked with ONLY salt I believe. It was terribly salty. And you don't serve the lemon butter sauce in such a huge bowl with such a  tiny portion inside it. Infact you layer the fish with a single coating of the sauce on top before serving. You don't need that bowl please. Looks horrible. Plating needs improvement. As I already mentioned, I wanted to change my plate but nobody paid any heed. That was a great minus moment for the outlet. 
Overall, the only thing that scored the game was the ambience. It's a moderate restaurant but it can do better if the staff is trained properly and if the chef can have control over the flavours. I work as one so I worship flavours. Was expecting a lot, but was a tiny bit disappointed. Anyway, the restaurant can still do better. 
Good luck fellows!!

The decor is not just interesting but definitely unique too. 
They have super luxury automobiles adorning the place, and hence is sure to attract many. 
Also, the mean machines are changed fortnightly to add to the surprise element and not become mundane to regulars. ¬†

They have cozy seating options, both indoor or outdoor.

The Stuffed Mushroom was phenomenal, and adds to be my favorite. The rustic presentation in the skillet, was pretty interesting. Big, bold button mushrooms, in their ohhk, so smooth texture, tasted truly divine.

The Chicken Wings were coated in a sticky, sweet-salty glaze, and was one of those things you wouldn‚Äôt mind getting your fingers dirty for.

Ooh, yes! They have a big list of mock-tails, and I tried quite a few of them. Most of them were pretty well mixed, and were the perfect accompaniment for the food served.

I'd start by saying, this place is way too overpriced for the quality of food and service it offers.

The ambience and decor are really cool, and the only things which win brownie points. There are super cars and bikes on display, true to the theme of the caf√©. There are also board games kept at the dining tables, and a pool table. However, the music playing was too loud to have a decent conversation.

Coming to the food, we ordered the following:
1)Let's Nacho- Now when you're being charged Rs. 255 for nachos, you certainly don't expect to be served Cornitos on a plate, that too with no dressing, and just a salsa dip. We had to separately ask for a cheese dip to salvage it.
2)Cheese Corn Balls- Tasty but nothing out of the ordinary
3)Veg Lasagna- This dish was the standout, very cheesy, full of veggies and made to perfection.

Cool place to hangout with friends, but service is dead slow and the pocket pitch is quite high so not quite worth it.

Worst experience ever anywhere in Kolkata. Had to wait for more an hour for food. And on top of that pathetic in taste. Be it pizza, garlic bread, manchow soup, agli olio pasta, noodles, Manchurian. Will never visit again. And would suggest people to not to go to this place. And as for rating if it was possible I would rate negative for this place .

First thing's first, the location of the Caf√© and the ambiance is spot on perfect. Hookah being served in there adds to the feel. The bikes and the apparel and accessories on display is like none other. 
Ordered a Mix Sauce Pasta and a Hazelnut Coffee.
Both were league apart. Sumptuous food and comfortable place is all i needed and this caf√© made my day! 
A little on the pricier side, which the location justifies, the place is an occasional treat!

Ambience & decor of the cafe is mind blowing. They also have lots of interesting games like "Play Station 4", "Snooker Table" and many more. Honestly buddies if you guys are crazy for sports bike, cars & interesting gadgets. This is the place where you need to visit. I would also like to mention "Sudarshan" & "Suman". They are one of the staff who were serving us. They were very cordial & disciplined. If you really want a decent & standard place to hangout with family, friends or girlfriend. So this is the place you need to check in. *Pls do share this everyone*

#' Worst place to visit Machiners paradise cafe... there is of no use going to this place ... First of all the food is too expensive like just 2 mixed noodles will cost you around 650 INR and no discount and there is charge for playing pool as well .. i was a regular guest in this cafe but still they used to charge me the pool charges which used to disappoint me. And the hookah was also not good .. there was a complaint on every hookah they used to serve to me. There is no advantage of being a regular guest in this cafe ... !!!

Well I went here on my Birthday.. 28/06/2017

I went with a cousin and a friend of mine.. 

This place has got a good ambience with some really cool bikes inside the cafe which adds to the decor.. Here they have a pool table and another section where I believe they had Playstation. On the day of my visit, the Playstation area was reserved and hence we could not access it.. 

Initially we were greeted by a girl who guided us to our table. The staff who were serving food were quite late in almost everything.. So I must say that service needs to be improved on an overall basis.. They have a calling button on each table which helps as the music is very loud and calling staff could become impossible without this calling button.. 

This place serves hookah too.. We didn't order as we were not interested in it though.. 

Now let's talk about food.. 

Crispy Chilli Baby Corn - A bit too sweet. (3.5/5)

Cheese Fondue - Less quantity of bread crumbs and pricey (Rs.400), so overall not great. (3/5)

Pink Sauce Pasta - The name is catchy but it was just mixed sauce pasta. It was well prepared with the right amount of veggies. Very good in taste too. (4/5)

Oriental Sizzler - Very plain hakka noodles with tossed vegetables, French fries and crispy chilli baby corn served on a hot sizzling plate. This was way below our expectations.. (3/5)

Brownie Shake - The usual chocolate brownie shake.. Although I was not able to spot the brownie in it. Either it was mashed too much or very less quantity was added to it. (3/5)

Chatpata Masala Soda - This drink is something which I always order from the menu anywhere. And I must say here it was below average. (2.5/5)

Virgin Mojito - It was just sprite with leaves on top of it. Disappointing! (2/5)

This was all we tried here.. For conclusion, I would say this is an expensive and not a well managed cafe.. There's huge scope of improvement in terms of service, staff and food.. They seriously need to work on this.. 

Coming towards the pricing, I will say that this an expensive place and you will be billed around Rs.750 per person if you order all types of food each along with a mocktail..

This is a real good place to chill. The staff is very quick and responsive. I tried cappuccino and Oreo shake. Both were good. However, like all cafes, the cappuccino had been brewed in coffee machine, something which doesn't do justice to the coffee flavour. Oreo shake well prepared. It had the correct proportion of milk, chocolate syrup, and Oreo. 
The board games were neatly kept. None of the parts were missing. The tables and seats were spic and span.
A fellow guest also got his Labrador. It was welcomed warmly, however some of the other guests were concerned by the presence of the pet. The management should keep a separate place for pets.
Overall a great place to hangout and spend quality time with friends.

Ambience: The ambience is the star of the show. The profusely beautiful looking cars are so great to have. Enough lighting to take pictures with the machines. But let me tell you u can't sit , take photographs but do not sit. ..!haha

Service : service and staff I didn't like it much . The service was pretty slow,  the staff was not reciprocating enough and they don't even speak in English ... ! 

Overall it is good enough to visit every now and then. Hookahs are available .... Some indoor games were also there. .....!!!

Currently, this is one of the most happening cafes in Kolkata. It is a nice initiative taken by SAI. They deal in second or third hand luxury cars. Their cafe is a combination of exotic showroom and the cafe itself. The moment you enter, you are surrounded by Lamborghini, Porshe, Audi depending upon which car is on show. I went for a school reunion. We ordered Barbecue Chicken Burger and Veg Pink Sauce Pasta and Special Flavoured Hookah. The service time was a lot, but anyways in the mean time we took photos of the cars and bikes. The food was amazing both the burgers, the filling inside, the barbecue sauce and the pasta was amazing and even the flavour of the hookah was also great, it was better than Green Apple which is the one I have tried before. A great start to the year.

Located beside Renault showroom.

Right before entering you spot a green coloured Lamborghini parked outside with various others- Audi, BMW, Jaguar and Mercedes to name a few.

As soon as you enter you this huge cafe, you can spot yet another amazing car, memories corner, sales corner ( one can buy t-shirt, cologne etc.), Ice hockey table.
The seating arrangement offers choices ranging from bean bags to spacious sofas to wooden benches. The ambience is very appealing with soft music playing. The theme is executed nicely.üëå

I tried Banana Caramel Shake, Let's Nacho, Cheese Garlic bread and Hot Chocolate Fudge. The food was presented nicely and tasted ravishing.
The service was top notch.
Price is reasonable.

As for the food me and my friend, we ordered Oriental Veg noodles, shredded chicken and pesto salad and a berry blast. The food was served fresh, excellent quality. Quantity wise it was quite substantial. The staffs were also very friendly and service was good. So adding up-- sexy cars+awesome ambience+good food...overall thumbs up to the place. A must go.

We came here after a hard day and with little time in hand.
Negatives first: there was apparently some staff unrest in the kitchen, and no one thought to inform us that our order will be delayed, in spite of being asked the status several times.
Positives: we had ordered coffee, sandwiches and were given a sizzling brownie complimentary for our delay. The food, undoubtedly, was really good - in taste, quality and quantity - as was the ambience, and the Cappuccino was downright excellent.
Super-positive: the view of the awesome cars that have the power to make you forget everything else!

I find the place a bit boring. Hookah was ok. Food not upto the mark. Ordered babycorn amd white sauce pasta. Readymade pastas are better than that

Earlier known as Nosh Cafe, this place didnt quite take off from where Nosh had left. Even though the ambience of the place is exactly the same with the green lamborghini standing in front and various other luxury vehicles also present, the food didnt live up to the expectations. The pasta wasnt upto the mark but the drinks made up for it. Improvement in the quality of the food is highly recommended to take this place to an all new level.

The place is easy to spot with nice and interesting decor, a pleasant view for Motorheads but the hospitality and food is not that great.

I ordered a humus starter, red sauce pasta and a risotto. All were very average. Humus was more of a smooth and small dip with pitas lacking the raw chickpea flavour, the pasta sauce quality was average and spicy . I didn't eat the risotto so can't comment anything specific but my companions rated it average.

There was no one to take orders and I had to walk to the counter to ask for help. Same while refilling water. The waiter didn't bother much to serve the dishes.

Slight improvement on the above can make it a cool hang out place.

This place had been on my list for a while. Finally went there with my friend and her cousins who were visiting from ranchi. The ambience is amazing. You are surrounded by supercars and stuff related to it. Loved the concept and the layout.The music being played is also very peppy and fun. The whole setting was very impressive. They have a foosball table too, which the kids absolutely loved! The tables too have various board games. we had snake and ladders on ours and it was nice playing the game after ages. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We ordered a Mexican sizzler, crispy chilli mushrooms, hazelnut cold coffee and mudpie. The coffee was absolutely perfect. The mushrooms were decent enough and the sizzler was quite good. The mudpie was simply marvelous. One glitch was that when we wanted water, a staff didn't understand what is house water. That's fine no issues. But overall I would definitely recommend you visit this place to chill with your friends. I think we have found out our next favourite place to hangout. :)

Went there today itself just to check out the place,
Had just ordered a Shisha and it was pathetic, this place is so over rated charging 450 for shisha and providing such pathetic shisha, I left in less than half an hour, it felt like I went there to dump my money.

An absolute no for this place.
