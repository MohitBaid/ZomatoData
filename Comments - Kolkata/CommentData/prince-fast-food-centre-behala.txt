I would have given it a 5. Just didn't because of the seating arrangement and ambience. I loved the food. It's hygienic and really tasty. We had ordered spring chicken which was a delight. We also had reshmi butter masala and fried rice. Everything was great. Staff behavior is also good. Best is the food. It's delicious. The place is pocket friendly with no extra charges. A must visit. It's also a nostalgic place as the great prince of Calcutta Sourav Ganguly enjoys the cuisine here.

This place makes me nostalgic...I have ordered fast food and snacks frequently from here being a resident of Behala Chowrasta...over the years the quality of food remains the same...just the price increased which is quite obvious...Kind and understanding staff and delivery is also quite fast.

I have been to this place once and as long as the food is concerned it was not at all good....though the staffs are good....
I ordered a Chinese combo meal....which consists of veg noodles and chilly chicken....first of all if you are serving Chinese non veg combo then it would be better if they provide it with non veg noodles....where as I got veg noodles....second thin is that the chilly chicken was lacking all kinds of flavours.....the gravy as well as the chicken was not good....I

Went just to utilise the washroom but the experience turned out to be a memorable one. Food is really good and cheap. May be not up to the mark. Moderate quantity and stuffs were really humble. Chicken gravy noodles was not a very wise decision we took. But the fried rice with chilly chicken brought to satisfaction. 4 people in 535 bucks!

Today was my first visit to this outlet near Behala Chowrasta . Had Egg Devil & Fish Butter Fry . Devil was a fairly big one with inside stuffing of kima . Tastewise was ok type , nothing extraordinary . Fish quality of Butter Fry was average & the coating could have been better . Quantity & price wise both were good .

This restaurant is located in Chowrasta , Behala just in the lane between Rabindra Mistanna Bhandar and Chemist Corner. It offers you both the options of takeaway and sit and dine. My personal experience of sit and dine was not satisfactory. So it's better to settle for the takeaway option. Now the tricky part is the food menu differs in case of takeaway and sit and dine. You get to order Chinese and South Indian cuisine when sit and dine but normal fast foods like rolls, cutlet and chops in case of takeaway. The food offered in takeaway really closes the deal. Especially the fish preparation are Over The Top. So when passing by make sure to check out the fish items from this eatery.

Every behala-bashi knows the history of this fast food centre and 'prince' the name which can be easily associated with former caption of india Mr.Sourav Ganguly. 
This one of the oldest fast food joint in behala located in the by lane adjacent to Priyo Rabindra and opposite to Willow Tower. Surprisingly that soft fish fillet in perfectly fried fish fry melts in your mouth.
Othwerise it is as regular as any other joint.

Spoiler alert: this is an experience, not¬† a review!
I found this place from zomato where the home delivery option is highlighted. I called the authority at 8 pm and they informed the unavailability of any delivery person. The eatery is near to my place and so, I decided to personally collect the food. I asked them whether I could go there at 9 pm to collect¬† a few masala dosas. They confirmed and accordingly, I went there at that time. To my utter surprise, the manager, to whom I talked before, told me that dosa was unavailable. He reasoned that the chef was out for the time being. However, one hour before during our telephonic conversation, he agreed for the same order and he did not bother to inform me before.
I am sure that the eatery management will least respond to my complain. So, my question goes to zomato. How come an eatery with such a pathetic management could deserve a place in zomato and keep annoying zomato followers? I understand that it's not possible for zomato to scrutinize all the details about an eatery. However, I hope, any such review should be taken care of.

Some places are very nostalgic and the same applies to Prince it always makes me remember of my dadu (grandfather ) as i visit him years back he would always come with a plate of#fish fry(**let me tell u dis is the specialty of prince and one should not miss, no one could make such delicious mouth-watering#fish fry and i can vouch for that but the rest items i cant guarantee as its quality has dropped for many years ) since then my relation with prince and its fish fry continues...and i thats y I'm giving.0.5 extra just for childhood memories offcourse its needless to say that this is in the same lane of Prince of Kolkata's house....so it could be a must try for casual fast food nd for a sight of Prince...

Located at a stone's throw distance from the D.H.Road in Behala Chowrasta, this is a so-so fast food centre. It is located in the locality of the Prince of Kolkata, Sourav Ganguly and hence, the name of this food joint is appropriate. Coming to the food, they serve okayish food. They don't compromise with the quantity but the quality of the food is something¬†I am unsure of. I have tried Egg Roll, Chicken Roll, Paneer Roll, Mixed Chow Mein, Chilli Chicken and Mixed Fried Rice. The Rolls were quite wholesome although they weren't of Haji's level. The Chow¬†Mein was decent with a good amount of flavours. The Chilli Chicken had disappointed me. It was very bland. The Fried Rice was so-so. I guess, had the Chilli Chicken been not so bland the rice would have had tasted better. The Chilli Chicken and the Fried Rice did not complement each other at all, primarily due to the blandness of the Chilli Chicken.

The prices are reasonable. The Rolls and the Noodles are the two items which I would recommend you to try from here if you visit this place.

If you are a south Indian and stranded at a place like anywhere between Behala and Joka, this is the place to have some decent tiffins. The Restaurant is in the first floor while the parcels are delivered at the ground floor. Decent seating arrangement, the waiters will bring everything to your ¬†table (even parcels). We had Dosa and Uttapam and it reminded of home. Decent for occasional visiting for tiffins. Never tried main courses. Will get back when I try one.

Hugely popular among the local residents. But that was mainly due to the absence of quality restaurants in the area. Previuosly it was just a small eatery however in the recent past they have also opened a restaurant upstairs. The price is on the cheaper side and the food is okayish. Ambienece is close to nil.

This is a famous joint in Behala Chowrasta located very close to Rabindra Sweets. The restaurant is on the first floor while the ground floor is for takeaways. There is no ambience as such and its too small. ¬†We ordered Veg Hakka noodles, Veg Fried Rice and Paneer Chilli. The Fried Rice tasted okay. Paneer seemed to be under-cooked. The gravy tasted okay. The Hakka Noodles had too many onion pieces on it but the quantity was more than enough for one person considering how cheap the price is.Overall, it was an average experience.

Over all its an average restaurant and i would like to visit again as it is not so far from my home

This place is located near the Behala Chowrasta bus-stop, a few steps from the Diamond Harbour Road and Biren Roy Road(East-West) crossing. They have a takeaway counter downstairs while the dine in is on the first floor. I have mainly collected parcels from here although my parents have tried their dine in.

They have all sorts of food on their menu. From Chinese to Indian (Bengali as well as North and South dishes). My parents have tried their Bengali thali a couple of times and have liked it. I have tried their Chinese and it was really good. I had brought Veg. Hakka Noodles and Chilly Chicken (1/2 plate) a while back. The Hakka Noodles was tasty and not overly oily as is the case usually with the local fast food centres, also the quantity was more than enough for two people. The Chilly Chicken had three large portions of Chicken and was not too spicy. The price of the items is also quite cheap.

All in all its a nice place to try out, be it takeaway or dine-in. Its pocket friendly as well as good value for money. They also take catering orders for various occasions so that's a plus as well. So if you are around and looking for a place to grab a bite you could give this place a try.

Their ambience is ok and the food quality is also good. Their Biryani and Butter Fish Fry are their best food items.

As a kid whenever I visited Behala, I had to drop into prince to pick up their chicken kobiraji and fish batter fry. I decided to do the same one fine day evening and it was sheer disappointment. The kobiraji was not available, so I settled for batter fry and a chicken cutlet. The fish was edible but too oily. The chicken cutlet had no chicken and dozens of bread crumbs coated. They have fallen really bad.

Located right at Behala Chowrasta, at ¬†a stonethrow distance from the house of the Prince of Kolkata, this is basically a fast food joint, serving snacks and dishes at an affordable rate. Try their Rolls, Fish Fry, Mutton Cutlet or Chops, you won't be disappointed. The rolls are quite filling. The Fish Fry and thinner in appearance, but oozes out with flavors. If you are hungry enough, try some of their Chinese offerings, though I cannot vouch for their quality!

Once regular visitor, for their thali at noon. Its so popular, one will miss if late by minutes !! The Chinese foods and mughlai are equally good. It is also famous roll counter and fish fry are just yummy.

Situated at a stone's throw from the house of Sourav Ganguly, Prince is a little shop serving up the regular Chinese and snacky Kolkata fare. Their fried rice and Chili Chicken is tasty but nothing brilliant to write home about. However, their Cutlets and Fries are worth trying in this area. Their Fish Fries are thin but tasty and their Mutton Cutlets are great. You can also try their Fish Fingers and Mutton Chops, and even if they are not of the immense standards as that of Apanjan, they are still quite good.

In the eve of Astami,my friend and I checked in. On the first floor,there is a dining room with avarage decor. The picture of 'prince of kolkata' having food here,certainly adding grandeur to the status of restaurant.
As a starter,we ordered fish batter fry(not butter fry,most people mistake)..the golden colored fry was hot,crisp and loaded with fillet of bekti.a nice one.
Followed by,lemon chicken,paneer butter masala,rumali roti and salad.
Lemon chicken was a fuss,while the paneer was a good experience. A drawback is that there was no dessert of cold drinks available. 
Can't keep in memory for any dish.

I am a frequent customer of this fast food centre beside Sourav Ganguly'house and today I want to utitlize the oppotunity to write about them in zomato.I have always enjoyed their fish fry, wonderful flavour and quality with a very reasonable price. I would like to mention about the mixed chowmein also,overall it is very good food with great pocket bachat.

Located at Behala chowrasta, just 2 mins walk from the stoppage and you are in front of the counter. They also have a small restaurant upstairs, which you will find empty most of the times.

I ordered Fish Fry, Chicken steam momo, chicken chowmin and chilli chicken. None of them were good or tasted really good.

Strangely during the Puja's this place has take away biryani and chaap counter and that is really good. If I was supposed to rate them on Biryani and chaap I would have rated 4 but on the normal days they do not prepare this.

A small eating outlet situated near sourav ganguly's home ( Behala Chowrasta to be precise) . This place serves average to fairly good food and the varieties have only increased over the years.

I always go for home delivery as this place is near to my home so really can't say about the ambience and stuff. But yes the food is not at all bad. Quantity is enough to fill a hungry tummy and the quality is pretty admirable. 

Delivery is generally on time. Good place to have a quick bite and a quick delivery if ur budget is not so high for the big restaurants.

Situated at onenof the most bustling place at Behala, Prince has always been (and this comes from my past experience of 10 long years of ordering food from this place) a nice and a budget restaurant for a chatpata snack (specially thei rolls, noodles and cutlets)..!! However, the main course is equally pathetic.. Got gory experiences of the main course, so try avoiding them...

The best part about this restaurant is it's location, a lane in behala chowrasta, which happens to be the same one where Sourav Ganguly's residence is situated. That's it! Apart from that, I don't find the food to be interesting at all. Rolls from the take away counter can be tried, they are okay, but below average main dishes.

The major attraction to visit this place primarily is the fact that it is located on the same lane as sourav gangulys residence which is the main crowd puller for this restaurant.

I wouldn't recommend the dining there as it's one of the most claustrophobic places one could visit. However, its good for a quick bite as the rolls and the mughlai are really nice.

Overall, the fast food experience is great. The rest still has a long way to go. Happy eating.

Rolls, quick bites, starters. Go for it. Don't even look at the south Indian part of the menu. Another really surprising thing is that the restaurant serves good soup. This restaurant definitely offers value for money. If you are near it and wish to have a quick bite with much of a pocket pinch, go for it. Things you wanna try: the hot and sour soup, drums of heaven.

The rating comes based on their fries,snacks and rolls solely. I have heard of the other dishes from close and reliable friends,so did not try them :P I have only got food parceled from this place a few times,never got much of a chance to sit there and have food.This place has got a facelift in recent times and looks better now. Located in a perpetually bustling area,this place is a den for young chaps 
and you can come here for hangouts and gangouts :D
Their rolls are good but they can get better,though the fries and cutlets are really good. Affordable and nice overall for quick bites with friends.

I am not even going to talk about the regular menu of Prince, because I can't stop raving about their Bengali lunch!!
I am from a Non Bengali family ¬†but I can't survive long without maach bhaat. So Prince, which is a one minute walk from my house is my life saver. Everyday from 1.pm to 4pm, Prince fast food Center serves a proper Bengali lunch for a sit down meal as well as take out. On the menu are items like daal, bhaat, aloo bhaja, shukto, dhokar dalna, pona maach, parshe maach (jhaal and shorshe gravy), mangsho, egg curry, chatni, papor etc. Please refer to the picture of the menu I have uploaded for the pricing. You will never be able to spend more than Rs.200 even if you ate like a king, but the very homely, simple taste of each and every dish will leave fully satisfied and content. The next thing you would wanna do, is run home and sleep the whole afternoon away. You can order a whole thali or individual dishes. The quantity is always enough! The service is good, but do not expect your sheddo chaaler bhaat or torkari to be piping hot because they make it all at once by noon I guess. On rare occasions, you might get lucky to get pomfret if they don't manage to get parshe from the bazaar. Their Shukto, is one of the best things that ever happened to me! ¬†The maach and mangsho jhols can do with a little less oil though. In case you want to have maach bhaja or omlette, go ahead and tell them, and they will make it for you at the same prices. Don't forget to ask for lebu and peyanj with your meal. Its free. Me and my Bengali food loving ¬†Punjabi boyfriend go there atleast twice a week, and have never found anything wrong with the food. It just seems to be getting better everyday. But make sure, that if you are going there, better reach before 2.00pm because by 3.0 0 ¬†they start running out. I often see formally dressed people lunching there. So if you are in Behala during lunch hours and want to eat a good, healthy, hearty meal, please do visit Prince. Avoid Sundays.

This  one   is  at  a   stone's   throw   away  from  my  house.... located  near  Sourav  Ganguly's house   in  Behala  Chow  Rasta ,  this  place   is   known as   the  fast  food  joint  preferred   by   even   the  cricketer! Had   the food from  here  since   my  childhood  and  it  used  to  be   quite   good ...   the  fish  fry , fish   fingers  ,  chili  chicken  used  to  taste  excellent!  The  size  of  the   fish  fry  is  smaller  now   and  the  prices  have  hiked  up....alas the  chili  chicken   has  deteriorated  a  bit....  but  the  rumali  roti  is  to  die  for....thin  and just  delicious ... accentuating the    whole  experience  of  the  meal  ! Overall  a  nice   place   for some  evening   snacks  or  a  light  dinner!

It's considered a favourite of the prince of Bengal.
I have been eating here since... As long as I remember! Yes,this place is THAT good.
The fish fry is long and filled with juicy bekti that is succulent in every bite. Though the size is a tad smaller than before,the taste is impeccable. 
I usually go there for the fish fries and the crispy chilli baby corn. It's juicy. Spicy. And not to mention,crispy. A plateful of these babies will leave you asking for more! The ground floor is for the "fast food",literally. They rustle up awesome chowmein. Oily but tasty,the quantity in one box is enough for two people and a child. The Mughlai paratha is not too hard, and is reminiscent of the paratha used in the rolls.
The restaurant on the upper floor is air conditioned and has pictures of Bengal's Dada dining over there. Considering that he lives a stone's throw away from here,it's hardly a surprise.
Queue up during Durga Puja and you might catch a glimpse of him. That's the charm of the place. Food and Dada. Two of the most favourite pastimes of us Bengalis! Both in one place.
