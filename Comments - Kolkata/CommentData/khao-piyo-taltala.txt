Visited here for a plate of Chicken Chowmine. Not at all good in taste. Chowmine are very poor in quality, just like road side one, neither did they fry is properly. When they served us it was very oily. Won't have it again from this place.
They also serve sodas for Rs.10 a glass. The Soda was okay.

Too bad is this place. Went for the momos. They were just not worth it. Even the sodas tasted too sweet. Didn't like the place at all. The sodas were better here earlier. But this place is degrading day by day. I just hate that.

Horrible joint. Flies everywhere , extremely filthy only the sodas are okay went for Lemon Soda. Place needs to be renovated atleast.
They serve food items such Chicken Rice etc but its best you avoid eating from here.

Regular to the place , good forÂ quick & relatively cheap bite , though agree with other reviewers ... its a bit unhygienic ... fountain soda is good ... only place in the area where it is available .

So will rate it as 

Service : 3/5

Food taste : 3/5 

Ambiance : 1/5 

Pricing : 3/5
