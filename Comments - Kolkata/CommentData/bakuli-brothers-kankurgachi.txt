Bakuli Brothers is an old sweet confectionary located near 3A Bus Stand, Kankurgachi.

They sell a variety of sweets.

Staffs are good and service is swift.

Tried Chocolate sondesh , mango sondesh and rosogolla. All were nice & fresh but not wow.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

A decent sweet shop for local people.

Located just opposite to 3A Bus Stand near Kankurgachi. Very old sweet joint. Though they have transform themselves time to time. Quality is still one of the benchmark they follow. Lots of items to choose from. They also sell Radhaballavi , Singara along with Mistis. Price is affordable. Staffs are good.

Pretty good overall response from this shop. The sweets are very tasteful and I seriously didn't have any problem with them. The service was also good, and the sweets are also very moderately priced. Nice place to be at.

Well, my encounters with Bakuli Bros. date back from my childhood days to till date and even for the foreseeable future – although the count is very limited - as they do not match the likes of Ramkrishna Mission (Beliaghata), Ghosh Brothers (Kankurgachi) and New Ghosh Brothers (Kankurgachi) – all of these based in the immediate vicinity.

This traditional Bengali sweet meat shop is located at Kankurgachi 3A bus stand. I walked in today for some takeaways amidst scores of customers and finally got the chance to speak to the sales guy after 10-15 minutes of waiting time. Nice to see that they serve a decent range of sweets at reasonable prices.

Coming to their sweets, chocolate Sandesh (with a raisin appended) was fine, the other chocolate one was also good. Kadapaak was good. Strawberry Sandesh as well as Mango Sandesh were great, so was golaab patti. Nice to see that the Sandesh were pretty soft and fresh.

Only drawback I feel is regarding the taste – quite mediocre – which is understandable because they use some maida in preparation in order to keep their prices low. Regarding infrastructure, no seats are possible given the cramped space and service is fine. Cheers!
