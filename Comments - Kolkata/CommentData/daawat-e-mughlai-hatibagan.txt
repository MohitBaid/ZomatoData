A good place to visit for biryani lovers. We ordered mutton biryani, chicken biryani, murgh handi, murgh bhoona, green salad... Biryani was good. But the quantity of a plate of biryani is lesser than that of the other restaurants. But it was ok for me.üòäüòä They don't give egg in biryani.side dishes are too good. Specially murgh bhoona.Gravy taste delicious.
Staffs are friendly and polite. Good ambiance & decoration.no GST. must visit..üòçüòç

Service- too late(most irritating)
Menu- a number of items printed but not available
Food- not good enough
Veg or non veg- veg is better although the name stands mughlai..they are nothing like that
Food quantity and quality- quantity is enough but the sizes are very small...for example paneer pieces in paneer masala and chicken pieces in handi...
And quality is good but won't satisfy taste buds

Go for kadaai dish rather than any tandoor dish...

P.s. Water is very good there

This place is a new bee.. Have lots to learn and lots to improve. Let's start with the best part, average decor and wonderful marble tables, makes you feel nice for a start. We had ordered Briyani, Tandoori Roti and Kadhai Chicken as we had very limited options as per the waiter. When we were brought the dishes the kadai chicken were 4 small pieces not justifying the price, briyani was just Rice and chicken with rose water and ator (essence), The Tandoori Roti was under cooked, when I brought it to the notice of the waiter, he was kind enough to change it and in exchange offered me nan, which was better then Tandoori Roti. 
Well the staff and management was open to criticism and did take my suggestion, but I haven't visited them yet again to say if there is any change in their food. 
I do see scope of improvement in them.
The Rating is for their good gesture and decor. I still would not rate the food as yet.

What has happened to this place! I really don't understand...everytime a new restaurant sprawls out and it turns to be a dud in this place.
Went in to experiment the new place and returned with a heart full of sorrow. Amazing over-courteous staff (which is fine by the way!) ready to serve you with a wide grin, nice ambience, good decoration with nice designed tables, that's it and ohh yes, i forgot about the food...ordered chicken rimjhim (new stuff), chicken tikka butter masala and tandoori roti...felt like eating at some cheap highway side dhaba with oils dripping from our plates, spoons, bowls, tongue, lips and my intestines as well... salt was bit on a higher side, chicken was tender though and properly cooked but when asked for rotis again...i was informed that the chef was having his food so we have to wait a bit(now that's a bit awkward as you should have some alternate arrangement because u just cant keep your customers waiting). Anyways, as we counted the no. of tiles on the floor and our rotis were on our plate. No desserts available for your information as well and ready to wait for atleast 20 minutes after you order.
If anyone of you is trying to experiment, then go ahead and please don't forget to leave your comments . Cheers!

This restaurant is the latest addition to the already booming food scene in Hedua area. Felt like experimenting again ( no reviews yet!) and ordered from here, thanks to the menu and contact number posted on Zomato. The delivery was on time and the food was well packed and hot. I'd forgotten to ask for their menu card but they thankfully provided one ( a smart practice for a new restaurant).
I'd ordered Chicken Biryani, Chicken Chaap, and Handi Chicken. They'd run out of Chicken Rezala by the time I'd ordered (8pm). The Biryani was decent, but the Mughlai gravies were the real surprise! The chaap was really really good, good enough to ignore the amount of oil they used in making it. The Handi Chicken (enough for two) had 4 boneless pieces of chicken , with onions and capsicum, and a generous amount of mouthwatering gravy, no oil swimming on top, perfectly made. It was like eating at a good old Dhaba. The food was really fantastic. I've tried only two of the several gravies they make, but I think the kebabs and the gravies are there strong points. I cannot wait to try more of their dishes. They'll rule the area when it comes to Mughlai Cuisine if they maintain their quality. Also hoping that they don't get the 'curse' of the place ( half a dozen restaurants opened and closed at this very spot within 10 years)
