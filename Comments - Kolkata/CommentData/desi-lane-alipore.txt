This place is a must visit!!!üòä
I really liked the staff..They were really well mannered..Moreover the serving was done really good
Coming up to the ambiance they tried to give a lane of old Hindi Bollywood look...The entrance being the best place to click pictures
Next the food we ordered...We had malai chicken, chicken nikla, chilly chicken and chilly fish fry...N trust me each n every dish was amazing...Really tasty!!!
Moreover they have a really pretty bar counter.
And last bt not the least they have a separate section for the dance lovers...This is something really good..Like for the ones who just want to sit n have there stuff even they won't get bothered and the party lovers can also enjoyüòòüòòüòò
All-over a good place to go n chill

I dropped in at this place a couple of days back. It is on Alipore Road on the 4th Floor of the Encalve Mall. It is spread across an Entire floor and has got a huge area. Ambiance is good and at times the loud music adds to it. It can sometimes be passed of as a pub or a club with a small dance floor. It has also got arrangements for hosting private dance parties. Food was good and the prices were very reasonable. Overall it has got a very decent ambiance and a good vigour to it. The loud music and the dance floor adds to the feel of the place. There is also an in house DJ. Overall a nice place to hang out with friends and party.

Conveniently located in New Alipore, the place is relatively well accessible. That being said, it needs a proper indication or a sign board of some sort as one can easily go past‚Äã it. Coming to the interior, the ambience is dark and has the tell tale "old Bollywood" charms. For 31st December, the restaurant was near empty. We ordered a mixed sauce pasta and a tandoori chicken pizza, which by themselves, were scrumptious. With that, we ordered 3 pitchers of the draught beer and the bill came to be Rs. 3000 for two. The experience till then was quite memorable and we had already decided to visit there again.
However, the situation turned quite sour soon after that when a waiter came and informed us that it was 31st afternoon and we were "blocking the seat" in spite of the fact that the restaurant was practically empty and we had ordered quite a lot that came up to a sizeable bill.

Things were dropping after every few minutes, and the waiters had to be called six, seven times because they were busy querrelling among themselves. This is an issue that the management should definitely look into, because inspite of having all the makings of a good restaurant - catchy setup and relatively affordable and quite frankly, delicious food, the restaurant would be a miss for many food enthusiasts, owing to its rude and unprofessional service. The management needs to remember that when they make their services available to the punters like us, they provide not just food and liquor, but a complete experience which is judged as much by their food as by their manners and services. At the end of the day, it was definitely a miss for me.

An absolutely horrendous and disastrous experience last night on New Year's Eve. We chose this place for primarily two reasons, an excellent rating and because they were accepting table bookings. Speaking of table bookings, I had an e-mail and an SMS confirmation from Zomato, but my name was not on their list upon arrival. The bouncer went as far ahead as saying that it's Zomato's problem and not theirs. I mean the bouncers pretending to be scary is one thing and may be a part of their job but shedding away all of their common sense as well along with the calories in the gym is not really wise. It was only when I threatened them with a Zomato escalation, they let me in (Yes, fear of social media is still a thing). Once in, we were not given a seat for 1.30 hours while others arriving much later than we were given seats. You ask why? Because they were couples (5 stars for feminism though). Needless to say, all this after receiving a successful confirmation on a table booking. We kept our cool until now, but things were quite expectedly going out of hand and so they managed to give us a newly discovered table in one corner with no waiter assigned to us for another 15 minutes. I do not understand the need for accepting table bookings when you're so much cramped out of space and if private parties, which take up most of the space are more lucrative. Even after all your constraints, if you have still gone ahead and accepted table bookings, the least you could have done is given the ones with a booking priority seating. Table bookings exist for one reason and this is it.¬†

All in all, an absolutely terrible experience and would definitely not recommend it to anyone. I do not know how good they are on other days and I won't find out either but last night was a clear display of mismanagement, the staff at their worst behavior and customer satisfaction took for granted.

Beautiful place with an amazing ambience to start off with . Affordable rates for both food and alcohol yet the waiters were surprisingly very rude.One of them even went on to the extent of asking us to vacate as according to him we were holding a seat(We had already order a pizza,a pasta and three pitchers for two people) for a place where one could find ample empty seats on 31st Inspite of spending 3000inr for 3 hours which is 1000inr @1hr
We had such a nice experience and I was surely going to come here again but sadly after such an experience ,I don't think I would ever visit this place again.

This is not right. I was charged 6%  service tax apart from gst. When I called up the number they are justifying we are a club and no restaurants. When asked  for higher authority number they are asking me to go back to the outlet and get the money returned. Please stay away. Whatever food or drinks apart this is a corrupt management running.
Attached is my bill. They took my phone number as well as my name but still put wrong in the bill.

Good decor. Prompt service. Polite staff. Good food, that we ordered. 
But why 3/5 then? 
It‚Äôs because of the very limited menu. Though they serve Indian, Continental, Chinese, etc they don‚Äôt have ‚Äòmutton‚Äô in their menu. That‚Äôs not good when you are going out for dinner.

#' Very disgusting place ... During the night they hurry so much as if the cops are gonna rate in their cafe .. they just hurry hurry all the time at night which is very frustrating .. the staffs purposely punch in the wrong bill so that you dont check the bill and pay more but when checked they say sorry .. hahaha very silly ... The staffs always asks for tips. No doubt the ambience is very good but if the staffs and the environment is so bad then its not worth visiting this place. When i went there for the last time I already told them this is my last day at desi lane. I was a patent guest at desi lane with each day billing of 6-7 thousand rupees per day but still they did not value me and every time when i used to go they tell me sir last order .. sir last order .. and its so frustrating to me. So i decided not to go to desi lane there after. So friends if you're looking to go to a good cafe there are many more cafes in kolkata with good ambience and good staff behaviour as well .. avoid visiting desi lane as they dont value their guests at all no matter how good you to them .. they dont ever value their guests at all.

The entrance is perfectly studded with multicolored bulbs which give that cool retro Bollywood feeling. One of the best place to go with friends. We went there at around 2 am just to booze. I'll be looking forward to visit again to try a few dishes which was on our mind but couldn't.

Located in the 1st floor of Enclave Building ,Alipore , this place is one of the most talked about places in town. And an array of lights awaits once you enter the restuarant. Desi Lane as the name suggests , will give you total bollywood retro vibes once you enter . 

WHAT I ORDERED : 

Started my meal with Hookah as cola base ,and it was kinda strong . Do try.

1. MIXED FRUIT MOJITO : Fruity affair and quite unique as the name ,this is something new and you will actually love it . 

2.COLA MOJITO : This mocktail is a must try , quite refreshing and again a unique one. Do try.

3.CHICKEN LUNG FUNG SOUP  : On a chilly november evening ,this soup is all that you need. The aroma of the soup is so good, you would order one more. 

4. BHARWAN TANGARI : Chicken drumsticks , but made in such a way , you would definitely love to know. So the drumsticks are stuffed with chicken inside and the stuffing is so good, it will actually melt in your mouth. Quite a sixer as your starter.Close your eyes and order. 

5.PAN FRIED CHILLI FISH : Basa fish , tossed and fried , fresh chilli ,made this dish amazing. Do try .

6.SLICED CHICKEN IN GREEN CHILLI SAUCE : Another amazing delicacy from this place . It tasted good .

7.QUESSADILLA : Basically tortillas , it was so good ,you will keep munching on and on.

8.BRUSCHETTA PLATTER 
9.CHILLI PANEER DRY 
10.BAKED SMOKEY MAC & CHEESE : Lovely blend of mac and cheese is something you would crave for more .

11.SPICY THAI FRIED RICE : One of the best thai fried rice I've had in the recent times. Too good. Must try .

12. STIR FRIED VEGETABLES 

13.CHICKEN PENNE PASTA : One of the most creamiest pasta's I've had . The cream was very thick which made it more tasty .

14.CHICKEN CANTONESE NOODLES : Gravy noodles made perfectly in cantonese style , it just tasted amazing . If you are trying any chinese dish from this place, do not miss out on this .

15. TUTTY FRUTTY : How can your amazing meal be complete without a sweet . Tutty frutty icecream filled with seasonal fresh fruits , was something you would love to order again and again . 

Desi Lane was an amazing experience, the entire place is covered in pictures of bollywood stars which gives the real desi feel. Staff was very courteous and helpful. Do visit

I visited this place yesterday after hearing a lot about it. And it was totally worth all the hype. The place is beautifully decorated . It has amazing interiors and a wonderful ambience. 
I started with veg taliman soup , this was so far the best soup I have ever tasted. Corn , veggies, mushroom and noodles in a perfect mix.

Then I had Mixed Fruit Mojito , and it is not what you must have tasted somewhere else. It is very refreshing and very beautifully presented.


For starters I had Veg Quesadilla , it was served with amazing dips that added to it's taste.
Chilly paneer dry ,  paneer tossed with veggies. The perfect amount of softness and crisp.
Bruschetta platter, this was my favorite. Cheese, veggies and mushroom toppings . Only one word could define it - PERFECT

For main course I had ordered Baked smokey Mac cheese, so cheesy and so soft ... One can't get over it.
Spicy Thai Fried rice and stir fried vegetables, these were very filling and extremely mouth watering. The aroma and taste of the Thai rice made me fall in love with it.

And finally for dessert I had Tutti Fruty , perfect amount of sweetness with peaches and pineapples . Each bite was heavenly.

A colourful and happy place full of vigour.

The best part about the restaurant is the entrance. An array of multi-coloured lights decked up along the entrance corridor. The corridor also serves as a photo booth for its visitors. The ambience is really nice.

Things I tried -

‚Ä¢ Fixed Fruit Mojito and Cola Mojito: Both the drinks stand out. Brilliantly blended and served; they can surely reinvigorate you if you are stressed.¬†

‚Ä¢ Chicken Lung Fung Soup: The soup was served hot and with the evening being a little cold, the soup provided some warmth. Enjoyed it.

‚Ä¢ Bharwan Tangri: Chicken Tangris stuffed with minced meat. A delight for meat lovers.

‚Ä¢ Pan Fried Chilli Fish: The fish was fresh and prepared perfectly. Enjoyed every bit of it.

‚Ä¢ Baked Smokey Mac & Cheese: Mac & Cheese is one of my favourite dishes and DL did not disappoint. Vegans can try this as well.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Cantonese Noodles: Gravy noodles is what I love when it concerns Chinese cuisine and I loved the Chicken Cantonese Noodles at DL. Brilliant!

‚Ä¢ Tutti-Frutti: Sweet endings are always sweet. Hahaha! No, seriously, the dessert was heavenly.¬†¬†

Overall a very good experience at Desi Lane and would like to visit it again.

The desi lane restaurant with rocking desi decor and ambience, obviously with great food too. Loved the scooter and colourful lights and write up boards. There's a beautiful menu pouring over exotic dishes veg n non veg both. Wat I had 

Starters-Chicken lung fung soup 
               Bharwan tangari
               Pan fried chilli fish
               Sliced chicken in green chilli sauce
Main course - Chicken panee pasta
                        Chicken Cantonese noodles
 Dessert - Tutti Fruity 
 It's hard to say which one was best. But the fact I loved is each dish tasted differently best with its own variety. Not the traditional taste you get everywhere.. n even in getting full I felt like having more n more. The stuffed chicken tangari was brilliant, the soup and the pan fried chilli fish took away my heart.
 N pls I can't forget the hookah !! Teen paan n rose.

Desi Lane is a beautiful, warm and cozy restaurant in Alipore. As you enter, the first thing that will attract your attention is the pretty passage leading up to the restaurant which is decorated with colourful bulbs. They also have a number of photo booth props which you can use and have photosessions while waiting for your food. Coming to the food, the most recommended dishes are Lung Fung Soup, Bharwan Tangri, Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Chicken in Green Chilli Sauce, Chicken Cantonese Noodles, Chicken Penne Pasta, Mixed Fruit Mojito and Tutty Fruity. Each and every dish is well made and presented artistically. The quantities are also great and value for money is good. The pocket pinch is not exorbitant. The ambience is really warm and groovy with nice music and the service is top notch. They have private dining rooms as well. They also have provisions for Hookah and Alcohol. This restaurant is a bit difficult to find at one go, but once you pass that stage, it's all things bright and tasty! Hence, highly recommended.

Writing my 200th review, and what's better then writing for a place that's on my wish list since its opening. Had my colleague promotion party at this place and they all made our day. Staff very attentive and available on a rise of hand. Service is also surprisingly fast.

Starting our meal with the taliman soup, which was soupy and full of noodles. 
Ordered many starters, liked the quesdialla and the variety of bruschetta in the bruschetta platter. But the king was the dry chilli panner, must have for every one coming to this place.

For main course we tried baked Smokey mac & cheese, so cheesy and perfectly baked, also tried spicy thai fried rice along with stir fried vegetables which was filling. 

We were truly full till now so just had a tutti-fruity icecream which was a perfect ending to our party.
Don't forget to get selfies in their colorfull lane, surely will be your new dp.

The kind of ambiance they have created here kind of wins half the battle for them. Then comes the hospitality, which is top notch.
We had Fruity mojito and cola mojito for drinks, both of them were just fabulous. Chilled, refreshing, full of flavours. The drinks set just the right kind of mood for what was coming ahead.
Coming to the starters, we ordered for a bruschetta platter, which had two variants. One was topped with tomatoes and cheese and the other with olives. Somehow, did not like the ones with olives, but the other set was full of juicy flavours. It was really good.
The next in line was quesadillas stuffed with veggies and beans. The best part of this dish was the tortilla was pan fried like Marathas. Tasted different than the quesadillas you get elsewhere, and certainly a lot better. Came with a homemade salsa and sour cream( which tasted like hung curd), the dips were very well made and complimented the dish beautifully.
The Mac and cheese they serve here is a winner without doubts. Beautifully baked to perfection with just the right amount of herbs and cheese. Loved every bite. It was like digging into a bowl of happiness with lots of cheese and herbs in it.
We also ordered for the hookah . It was teen paan with rose, very well made and lasted quite long.
Overall, a must visit if you are looking for a sorted evening with sheesha and great food.

This is definitely one of the most happening places that i have been till date! The service is prompt and humble, you have the option of private dining, lounge facility, the music is definitely going to complel you to put on your dancing shoes, what else can you ask for!

The interiors and the decor are perfectly done, the ambience is quite energetic, perfect place for your next profile picture! Now coming to the food, it surpassed my expectations! You usually don't expect a party spot to provide such mouthwatering delicacies and this place scores high in terms of quality and quantity when it comes to the food!
Among the starters, the bharwai tangri is something you cannot miss out over here! FOUR big and succulent chicken legs is definitely going to have a lasting effect on you. For fish lover's, the pan fried chilli fish would be the ideal buy! I really loved the way they had prepared the fish, quite tender and crispy! The sliced chicken in green chilli sauce would also be a smart buy given the good quantity of this particular dish!

The menu is quite elaborate and you are definitely going to spoilt for choices! AMONG THE MAIN COURSE, you should definitely order the chicken penne pasta! I was highly impressed with this dish! They did not overdo with the amount of sauce! The chicken cantonese noodles would be another great bargain over here, the quantity is really good and the quality is unparalleled!

Among the beverages, the mixed fruit mojito and the cola mojito were highly impressive and i would definitely recommend them! You should also try their chicken lung fung soup. It was quite light and delicious!

The bar is loaded with all the goodies and they serve hookah too so you are bound to have a good time definitely!

The Mac and cheese they serve here is a winner without doubts. Beautifully baked to perfection with just the right amount of herbs and cheese. Loved every bite. It was like digging into a bowl of happiness with lots of cheese and herbs in it.
We also ordered for the hookah . It was teen paan with rose, very well made and lasted quite long.
Overall, a must visit if you are looking for a sorted evening with sheesha and great food.

This is definitely one of the most happening places that i have been till date! The service is prompt and humble, you have the option of private dining, lounge facility, the music is definitely going to complel you to put on your dancing shoes, what else can you ask for!

The interiors and the decor are perfectly done, the ambience is quite energetic, perfect place for your next profile picture! Now coming to the food, it surpassed my expectations! You usually don't expect a party spot to provide such mouthwatering delicacies and this place scores high in terms of quality and quantity when it comes to the food!
Among the starters, the bharwai tangri is something you cannot miss out over here! FOUR big and succulent chicken legs is definitely going to have a lasting effect on you. For fish lover's, the pan fried chilli fish would be the ideal buy! I really loved the way they had prepared the fish, quite tender and crispy! The sliced chicken in green chilli sauce would also be a smart buy given the good quantity of this particular dish!

The menu is quite elaborate and you are definitely going to spoilt for choices! AMONG THE MAIN COURSE, you should definitely order the chicken penne pasta! I was highly impressed with this dish! They did not overdo with the amount of sauce! The chicken cantonese noodles would be another great bargain over here, the quantity is really good and the quality is unparalleled!

Among the beverages, the mixed fruit mojito and the cola mojito were highly impressive and i would definitely recommend them! You should also try their chicken lung fung soup. It was quite light and delicious!

The bar is loaded with all the goodies and they serve hookah too so you are bound to have a good time definitely!

If u want to go to a place for chilling out and want to come back with a headache this is the perfect choice. Here you have to pay a hefty amount to sit with your friends. If u want to order only a hookah you are not allowed to do that. Learn something before entering into a sector. Just opening a cafe won‚Äôt help. Please hire some good employees also. A place in such a good locality with the worst management. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª

And when it comes to the drcor, amazing it is,and the best part is ,they have many private sections where you can chill freely. 
And yeah perfect place for photography

Their BarBQ wings are succulent and tender. The special sizzler was just right, medium done, just the way i wanted. 
Experienced staff took care of my whims and needs. 
On a side note, they should expand the place to cater more people instead of making them wait. But i guess their food makes it worth the wait. 
Recommended 10/10.

If I had got the chance, I would have given a rating below 0. Although the ambience is super good, but the staff is too rude. He asked to leave just because we didn't fulfill his expectations of ordering everything together. We just asked him to wait for a while.  We had already ordered hookah,  fresh lime soda and Babycorn. Wasn't that good enough to wait? 
Because of their location, they might have received many customers but I am sure this attitude won't take them far enough in future.  
Visit at your own risk. Be prepared to get humiliated.

Kindly avoid this place to maintain peace of mind.

It was a very busy month and I did quite get a chance to explore someplace new but when I did I never expected such a diplorable service which would discourage me to that point that I leave the place without eating. Yes, that's exactly what happened. 

We ordered a hookha and a mocktail to start. We were only browsing through the menu that the attendant literary forced us to add dishes to the order to which we asked for sometime. We then ordered a crispy babycorn and thought to order something else only after tasting the babycorn first. But the attendant behave in such rude behave that he literally told us to order something more right now or else leave.

After such gross misbehaviour we had no choice but to leave the place. Went with high expectations but the place was a total let down.

Some desi food with bollywood tadka, that's how I've seen desi lane yesterday, located at alipore road, near 'Madhuvan' building. This newly launched reastaurant has successfully covered a wide area to impress its guests by introducing live bar counter, gamezone, hokkah zone and its FOOD. as soon as you enter the restaurant, the small lane at the entrance with bolly- theme based lighting will take you to an action-replay mode. With no more elaboration on the decor, now I'll straight away talk about the food.we had ordered--
1. Fish irani tikka- extremely soft and juicy.
2. Murg haryali kabaab- properly marinated hence supersoft. Properly moisturized and proper balance between coriander leaves and green chilli.
3. Desi pulao- aromatic rice with some veggies. Thoigh a lot of spices have been used, still the aroma of the dish did not overwhelm the taste.
4. Chicken tikka masala- spicy rich preparation. Finger-licking.
5. Fish irani tikka masala- spicy Basa fish preparation. Highly recommended.
6. Hot brownie with vanilla ice cream - I have had the best brownies of my life here. We were so hypnotised by the brownies, that we had to order another one of this.
Gondoraj-basil mojito- a master in refreshment and taste enhancement. Definitely a must try .
As the croed was less, individual staffs were always there per table to help the guests to choose the right taste of their choice
Though there was a bit lack of communication between the staffs that we observed, but that can be rectified. Overall we had an wonderful evening in desi lane. Looking forward to visit again. üòã

A place that scream all things Desi - Yes! It is the Desi Lane which has been making noise lately, for all the right reasons. One might ask, in a time when themed restaurants are popping up every now & then, what sets Desi Lane apart? Undoubtedly, it's their approach to the theme, staying true to it amidst all the chaos. Their idea of what 'Desi' should be, is catchy and gives a strong nostalgic vibe. With quirky posters, a wall that glows in the dark, and a wonderful 'desi' entrance, this place does justice to their name. Now, besides that, they provide wonderful happy hours on the weekdays - another reason to love them even more!
So, I was there for a late lunch and decided to settle with some of their desi items that satiated us to the T!

In starters >>
‚Ä¢ Murgh Hariyali Kebab
‚Ä¢ Fish Irani Kebab [ MUST TRY!]

For Mains >>
‚Ä¢ Desi Pulao [MUST TRY!]
‚Ä¢ Murgh Hara Mirch Masala
‚Ä¢ Fish Irani Tikka Masala [MUST TRY!]

Dessert >>
‚Ä¢ Brownie with Vanilla Ice cream [ MUST TRY!]

Drinks >>
‚Ä¢ Gondhoraj Basil Mojito [Give it a try, if you're a Mojito lover]
‚Ä¢ Pint of Beer (Carlsberg)

With a tummy full of happiness, we had a perfect start to the weekend, all thanks to the courteous staff for their efficient service and the sumptuous food. I'm definitely going there again!

INTRODUCTION AND LOCATION:
Suddenly my route changed from my desired way and it turned towards the "Desi Lane". Why it is Desi Lane? Thats a big question to be asked! You wont understand until and unless you visit this place by yourself and have a look at the place. There has been lot of places around the city who are taking tricky bollywood ways and attires to attract the eyes but unable to get upto the mark. Where as Desi Lane is taking up the challenge doing the things just right ways. Location has been a little problem for me to find out but its at Alipore Road near to state bank building if i am not mistaken.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:¬†
Talking about the ambiance so Desi Lane has both the attire of a cool looking dinning with sofa sitting and disco stage. The placed auto rickshaws with colorful paints gives a diffrent touch to the place. Bollywood superstars photo spreaded along the walls starting from Late Rajesh Khanna Saab to Beloved Salman Bhai. The entrance is something to talk about too which had the Dil Chahta hai style lighting surrounded you all over. Service is fine just the guys looked to me little confused.

FOOD:
I turned in to this place a little late and it was a pure vegetarian day for me.¬† Tried the Following:

1. Strawberry Mojito : Refreshing. Very well with the taste.

2. Corn Malai Kabab : Soft as velvet and very soothing to the tongue. Had a soft crush and even softer from inside. Cheese spread all over th mouth with the certain corn flavour.

3. Kasturi Dal Tarka : This was purely like home made. Didnt had a feel like having it at a restro. Tasty!!!!

4. Exotic Vegetables : Exotic!!! Really Exotic.... A dish with all the love and pure bengali touch. Reminded me of eating this at a pure Bengali restro. Brilliant.

5. Cheese Kulcha : It complemented the Dal tarka and Vegetable very well.

Just like they have the looks so is the food they have. I had few negative comments on this place but after my visit i guess those are just rumors. Cheers to Desi Lane.

Me, being too fond of themed places, I really loved Desi Lane! The ambience and the d√©cor simply won my heart! üòç

üè©Location: Being at 10 minutes distance from Hazra More (JD Park Metro Station), Desi Lane stands on the 1st floor of the same building as that of Kookie Jar in Alipore.

üéáInterior & D√©cor: Themed on Bollywood, this place has been done up in a simply wow way!! The entrance (i.e. the 'Lane') is the centre of all the attraction to get clicked at! Be it the scooter or the funky auto rickshaw or the selfie booth wall, Desi Lane just doesn't get exhausted of places to get tonnes of clicks! üì∑üòç

There are 2 different sections, the outer one serving the bar as well while the inner one, along with seating arrangements, got the dance floor. I guess, they give out this area for private events as well. In 1 sentence, it has got simply a fab ambience!!!

üçóWell, coming to food, some of the items which I tried over here were;
üçπStarting with the beverages, tried their Strawberry Mojito and Fruit Mojito, both of which were flavourful and refreshing!
üçüFor starters, we had ordered Barbeque Stuffed Potatoes and Murgh Lasooni Kebabs. Both the items were quite good!
üçùFor the mains, came the Murgh Methi Malai and Fish Irani Tikka Masala accompanied by Cheese Kulcha. My favourite of all was the
Chicken Chilli Basil Fried Rice along with Barbeque Chicken in Gravy. The flavour of the rice was so amazing, it still makes my mouth go all watery. Each of the item was made in the best way possible.
üç®The caramel custard concluding the lavish feast, was decent as well.

üíÅGood hospitality and nice service!

So, if you're a photo maniac, love to party out with your friends, a foodie as well, this is the place! Visit it and get to know yourself!! üòä

Located in one of the most posh areas of Kolkata, Desi Lane is something which will entice you with their superb ambience, scrumptious food and excellent hospitality! 
The entrance is perfectly studded with multicolored bulbs which give that cool retro Bollywood feeling. And thatbis one of the most desirable spots to take a selfie or group pic. From a vintage Scooter to funky autorickshaw, this place has it. And one of the best thing about this place is that it is quite big! We went there with a group of 10 people and were able to have a gala time!
Now coming on to the food, something that caught our eyes was the chicken moussaka and corn malai kebab, for starters. Even though i am not very much fond of veg food, the corn malai kebab was delightful. 
For mains, we ordered cheese Kulcha, fish Iranian tikka masala and exotic vegetables. The cheese kulcha and Fish Iranian Tikka masala was a match made in heaven, which led to me ordering two more kulchas :3 . The exotic vegetables were seasoned beautifully and tasted very nice.
So ending on a sweeter note, we ordered the chocolate brwonie with vanilla ice cream. The brownie was baked to perfection, studded with choco chips. Couldn't have been happier. 
And last but not least, i ordered the mixed fruit mojito, which was fresh and cold. 
Even though i am not a very big fan of hokkah, we ordered one, to be honest the ambience called for it!
The food was totally able to do cabaret on my taste buds and will surely visit here again! 
From cheesy kulchas to perfectly prepared fish, this place is something that I highly recommend.

Not everyone knows about this, and the sorta under-construction building without signs doesn't help. And it's sad, 'cause this is a restaurant everyone should flock to on a regular basis.

The entrance reminds you of Bollywood party song videos, with tiny multi-colored lightbulbs covering the walls and the ceiling. And there's a bright yellow scooter, of which I've attached a masterfully background-blurred picture üòé
And thumping music too. They just have to stop playing Bollywood mash-ups.

Went with some friends.
For starters, we ordered Corn Malai Kebab and Chicken Mussaka. Both really good.

Then we ordered Fish Irani Tikka Masala, Chicken Chilli Basil Fried Rice and BBQ Chicken Gravy.
The Fish will melt in your mouth and make you forget all your worries. The rice, each grain tasted like it was cooked separately, the chefs are that thorough.

Go there right now. From the ambience to the very courteous staff to the delicious food, everything will win you over.
Highly recommended.

Oh and we also ordered a hookah and a Gandharaj Basil Mojito in the beginning. The latter, refreshing.

This place ticks each and every box which makes a restaurant perfect. The ambience, the service and most importantly the food.
Once you enter Desi Lane you'll be transported to a world of kitsch, colour and drama. There are things ranging from lighted up photo booths to scooters and auto rickshaws you can pretend to be taking a joy-ride on. It's THE PLACE to go with a huge group of friends and just let your hair down. 
The service is extremely competent. The servers were privy to our every need and was really supportive.
Now, coming to the food. We ordered  chicken moussaka and corn malai kabab for starters.
For our mains we ordered cheese kulcha, Fish Iranian Tikka Masala and Exotic Vegetables. We finished off on a sweet note with a decadent chocolate brownie with vanilla ice-cream.
We also had gondhoraj lebu @mojito to wash down all that beautiful food.
The starters were delectable. The corn malai kabab was a soft pillow of goodness, whereas the chicken moussaka was a shock(albeit a pleasant one) to the palate with the robust taste of char-grilled strips of auberginr wrapped snugly around a stuffing of minced chicken flavoured with herbs and tomatoes.
The kulchas were oozing with cheese and the distribution of stuffing was even throughout.
The exotic vegetables was full of delicate flavours and the mixed veggies had a nice crunch to it. The fish Iranian Tikka Masala was again sheer beauty on the plate with the softness of bhetki dunked in a warm, rich spicy gravy.
Special mention must be made for the dessert though. I was a little sceptical when the friends I had gone to Desi Lane with wanted to order Brownie with ice-cream as this is a dessert I have had 52,000 times in different restaurants and cafes. But, believe me you I had to take back my scepticism once I put the first spoonful of the dessert in my mouth. The Brownie was the most moist Brownie I have had EVER. It was just warm enough to taste heavenly when paired with the cold ice-cream. I literally died and went to heaven.

I highly recommend this place for all of you out there who want to have a good time with your friends over a hookah, some cocktails and (if you are me) some brownie. The place is great to click all your cool dp's at, it's great to have fun at and most importantly this place is amazing to dine at.

Surely it will give you Desi Vibes. The ultimate desi place in Kolkata. Situated at 1st Floor, 17/1F, The Enclave Building, Alipore, Kolkata. And as the name suggests, the restaurant boasts of a classic filmy vibe, which will be evident in the decor and ambiance.¬†

The first thing that struck me when I saw it, was just how spacious this restaurant really is. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is superb. The super quick service helped us enjoy the whole evening even more. Its large but very well maintained and with good 'party' ambiance. The music was amazing and groovy.¬† And guys, did we have a great time! It was by far, my best Bollywood night experience in Kolkata.¬†

Meanwhile, the menu at the restaurant will be a melange of North Indian, Chinese and Italian cuisines. It gets very crowded and cramped over the weekends but usually nobody minds that.
                    

Coming to food,

DRINKS :

1) Gondhoraj Mojito :
This refreshing mojito features lime, sugar, mint and more and is the best way to enjoy summer.

2) Mixed Fruit Mojito :
This mixed berry mojito combines delicious fresh lemonade, raspberries, blackberries, mint and rum. It's super delicious and perfect for spring.

STARTERS :

1) BBQ Stuffed Potato:
Fluffy baked potato with a perfectly crispy skin, this is a truly delicious meal.

2) Corn Malai Kebab :
Corn Malai kebabs are really mouthwatering ,yummy instant snack.

3) Murgh Lasooni Kebabs :
A classic Indian dish that is accented by lemon, yogurt, garlic and spices.

4) Chicken Muskka :
It was a delectable preparation of chicken balls. It have a hot and spicy aroma that fills the room.

MAIN COURSES :

Katuri Dal Tarka, Exotic Vegetables, Murgh Methi Malai, Fish Irani Tikka Masala WITH Cheese Khulcha :
Each item that was served in this dish taste heavenly. Again I just said the taste is perfect. It's hard to beat anything that we ordered at this place.
                    

DESSERTS :

1) Carmel Custard :
A delicious traditional dessert with creamy caramel over silky custard. Caramel custard is my favorite pudding.

2) Brownie with Vanilla Ice-Cream :A unique and yummy dessert which is served with vanilla ice cream scoop.
                    

Overall, I really like the ambiance and the service is especially good. Food is awesome, which makes the overall experience one to remember.¬†

Definitely recommended, and we will be back to try more on the menu.

Located in one of the most posh areas of Kolkata, Desi Lane is something which will entice you with their superb ambience, scrumptious food and excellent hospitality! 
The entrance is perfectly studded with multicolored bulbs which give that cool retro Bollywood feeling. And thatbis one of the most desirable spots to take a selfie or group pic. From a vintage Scooter to funky autorickshaw, this place has it. And one of the best thing about this place is that it is quite big! We went there with a group of 10 people and were able to have a gala time!
Now coming on to the food, something that caught our eyes was the chicken moussaka and corn malai kebab, for starters. Even though i am not very much fond of veg food, the corn malai kebab was delightful. 
For mains, we ordered cheese Kulcha, fish Iranian tikka masala and exotic vegetables. The cheese kulcha and Fish Iranian Tikka masala was a match made in heaven, which led to me ordering two more kulchas :3 . The exotic vegetables were seasoned beautifully and tasted very nice.

This place is for the Bolly lovers. This bollywood-themed restaurant is a burst of colours and and quirky decor which is bound to make you feel good. The entrance is the most eye catching and sets the mood for your time here.
The service is courteous and hospitable and efficient.
Coming to food,
For starters we had corn malai kabab and chicken muskka.. I absolutely loved the chicken muskka, which was a delectable preparation of chicken balls.
For the main course, there were chicken chilli basil fried rice, exotic vegetables and fish irani tikka masala. The rice had this awesome flavour of basil and chilli which was quite unique and delicious. Exotic vegetables was a preparation of chopped vegetables in rich gravy and fish irani was juicy soft fish in red gravy. All of the items were oh-so-good.
For desserts we had the good old brownie with ice cream. The brownie too tasted yumm.
A special mention needs to be done for their gondhoraj mojito.. The combination of two wonderful flavours. This is highly recommended.
Overall, along with the warm and fun ambiance and great food we had a great time here.

Looking for a perfect Bolly nyt accompanied with Desi dashing food? If yes,then this is the place for you!
A perfect hangout zone for teens n Bolly buffs I would say!
Had a gala time with my friends tonight over some yummilicious Desi khana which is worth every penny!

LOCATION & AMBIANCE: New Alipore. 10 mins(Uber) distance from Hazra crossing to this place.
Situated on the 1st floor of the building you'll be amazed by the entrance which will give you every possible chance of being the "selfie queen". Okay just kidding.üòâ
Dance floor and proper seating arrangement with a super cool ambiance will surely pep up your mood.üëç

DRINK : We welcomed ourselves with their refreshing strawberry mojito. It was undoubtedly soothing and chilled.

FOOD:
Bbq stuffed potato: Never knew even a boiled potato could taste so fine when tossed with right amount of flavour and sauce. Even a non veg lover cannot dislike this one. Loved it!

Murgh methi malai : This one's my favourite. Everything is so yummy about this dish..be it the gravy which is thick and garnished with methi leaves. Chicken is soft and well cooked in malai. How can it go wrong then?
 SLURRRRP!! 

Cheese Kulcha: Those who know me well, will be surprised by going through this particular review. Have never been a Kulcha lover but this cheese-filled kulcha is a rockstar!
With gravy or without, this Kulcha is more than enough to satiate your heart n tummy.

DESSERT: Caramel custard won our hearts with its sweetness.‚ù§
This place is highly recommended.üëç

Visited on a Sunday early evening. 
The place was pretty empty then. The music was also quite soft. The service was prompt and efficient. 
Appetisers were quite good. I really loved the cocktail Mai tai (mix of white rum and pineapple juice)
I also went in another day to try only the food items and beverages.. 
the best among the lot were 
Gondhoraj Mojito: one should order this. Its amazing. 
Mixed fruit Mojito: another great beverage. 
Starters 
BBQ stuffed potato : great veg option
Corn malai kebab : a sweeter kebab choice 
Murgh lasooni kebab : great non veg option 
Main course : 
Chicken chili basil fried rice : you don‚Äôt need any accompaniment with this, it is that good! 
Murgh methi malai: absolutely yummy 
Fish Irani tikka masala : a spicier dish 
Exotic vegetable : i didn‚Äôt expect this to be that good, but I think it was the best veg item. 
Cheese khulcha : cheese lovers this is a delight. 

They were quite quick to serve the breads while we kept ordering according to our needs. The room inside has a dance floor, so it‚Äôs a great place for having parties as it has great food along with the great cocktails and fun ambiance.

Worst place to visit in the city. Not worth rating it. Service is horrible. Waited for an hour for the food that we ordered and then we were told since its crowded the food is going to take time. The owner was absolutely unapologetic and dint have the courtesy to apologize for the chaos, rather she was just ignoring us and said that their are too many people it is going to take time. First time in my life i have left a place without eating. 
Probably you may get food if you order food on the phone before visiting the place as per the manager / or if you are lucky and only table is full you may get food.

A very trending restaurant in the City of Joy and I couldn't resist myself from giving it a chance on 19-10-17.

Locating the place is very tough. They have no signboards or glow boards outside the building. No parking area is available.

Inside, just the entrance is a little quirky with colorful light bulbs while the rest of the interior is pretty flat, with wooden tables and wallpapers.

The food though is good here. My Chinese Bhel and the Piri piri Pizza was well prepared. The alcohol is simply overpriced. I did not find the ambience worthy enough to pay around 400 for a cocktail thus settled with Breezers. The music was trash. Service is a little sluggish though, it can be compensated by playing some good loud music and a good crowd.

Cheers!

'Desi lane' as the name suggested is a bollywood themed bar cum restaurant. It is located on the first floor of the enclave building. The entrance of the restaurant is in the form of a lane with rows of different coloured lights. The dining area is spacious and has walls painted with bollywood themed stuffs. There are private dining areas as well. 
I went there with a group of friends and we enjoyed ourselves a lot. We ordered-
Mocktails:
1. Black Forest- a black forest cake in the form of a mocktail with a twist. The twist is the kiwi syrup forming the bottom layer. It was amazing and one of the best mocktails I have ever had! 

2. Berry Blast- a berry mocktail with a spicy twist. 

For Starters:
1. Veg Gold Coin- veggie poppers served with mayo dip. It had a mild gondhoraj flavour which was amazing! 

2. Bharwan Tandoori Alo - another great starter for the lunch. 

3. Chicken Pepperroni- boneless chicken morsels with perfect blend of flavours and spices. 

For Main Course :
1. Murg Biryani- light, tasty biryani with a large succulent piece of chicken and potato. The fried onions on top added more to the flavour. A brilliant dish indeed! 

2. Butter Naan- soft and buttery! A perfect accompaniment for any North Indian side dish

3. Desi Videshi- a tasty mixed veg side. 

4. Murg Tikka Hara Mirch- succulent chicken morsels with power-packed flavours. 

5. Spicy Honey Chicken- it was spicy as well as sweet. Best for those who enjoy a little sweetness in their food. 

For Dessert:
Chocolate Bomb - it was a choco lava cake along with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce and undoubtedly the best way to end our meal. 

The staffs were courteous and the service was prompt. Would like to visit again sometime soon. 
Happy Fooding ‚ô•

Whenever there is a family get-together what is important is a good place you suit our moods. 
I have heared a lot mixed reviews about this place and visiting this place finally is totally worth it. 
As the name suggests they try to make it a casual dining and bar with a desi look. The moment you enter there is this small lane with lights and that's surely gonna excite you. Then there's the bar and the spacious sitting arrangements. They have a lounge incase there a big group. 

They have Bollywood movie posters painted on the walls and even they have khatia, everything to keep up with the name. The ambiance the music everything is so lit up. 

Coming to the food we ordered- 
For drinks- 
1. Mexican frozen margarita (kiwi) - frozen kiwi, ice, taquilia blended together and served. It's one hell of refreshment drink and definitely recommended. 

2. ‚Äéblack forest - we all know what black foressts taste like. But what if it's served as a drink with a twist. The twist is the kiwi extract underneath which give the dink a whole new dimension and taste. 

3. ‚Äédesi energetic Mojito 

For the starters- 
1. Bharwan tangri - beautiful tender and masaleydar chicken legs served in an amazing. Finger licking good. 

2.‚Äéchicken pepperoni 

3.‚Äé stuffed mushroom - mushroom stuffed with cheese and batter deep-fried and served. 

4. veg gold coin 

For the mains-
1. Veg mexican sizzler 
2. ‚ÄéMurgh biryani 
3. ‚ÄéMurgh adraki kofta masala
4. ‚Äémurgh tikka hara mirch
5. ‚ÄéDesi videshi 
6. ‚ÄéButter nan 

For dessert- 
1. Apple toffy - apple toffy is something new I have tried. Share cut apples been coated with a batter then soaked in a spiced up sugar syrup. It's really amazing. 

2. ‚Äéchocolate bomb. 
3. Tri colour pops 

Cheers to the entire team of Desi lane. Thank you for the amazing afternoon spread.

Desi lane as suggested by the name is a themed restaurant with a desi setup and interior looks so lit up. You enter into a passage full of lights, then move into a dining space which is spacious and the walls are painted on Bollywood themes. They have a private area too. It's a bar cum restaurant and includes a wide variety of North Indian, Chinese, Continental and Italian cuisine. 
I went with a group of friends during the festive season and we ordered :
1.  Black Forest - this is the black forest Cake we have turned into a mocktail. Smooth and thick, tastes of chocolate, coffee and the cream melts in your mouth. 
2. Berry blast- berry flavoured cocktail with a very fine taste of berry which is as refreshing as it could get.
3. Chicken pepperoni - we ordered this as a starter and the dish has boneless chicken pieces served with mayo dip. Tastes perfect with the softness and the spice flavours.
4. Veg gold coin- veg poppers served with a dip, stuffed with aloo and veggies and very soft. Being a meat lover I fell in love with it.
5. Bharwan Tandoori aloo - potatoes cut into half and stuffed with veggies cream and tastes like heaven.
6. Murgh biryani- they make very good biryani and the quantity is also commendable. One dish can easily suffice two persons.
7. Spicy honey chicken - soft boneless chicken glazed in honey and tastes great. 
8. Murgh tikka hara mirch- this dish is dry and consists of chicken pieces cooked in Indian spices, I had an extra piece by the way.
9. Desi videsi- a mixed veg dish consisting of corns,veggies, mushroom and a lot more. I repeat myself, being a meat lover after trying these veg dishes I changed my preferences.
10. Butter naan- the naans are soft and tasted really well with the chicken and veg dishes.
11. Chocolate bomb- a meal can't go without desserts so had to try this chocolate bomb, chocolate being my favourite flavour. It's very well presented and a great ending to a lavish meal.
The ambience gets full marks undoubtedly, great for photoshoots when you come with your gang. The service is really good, the quality and quantity of food is commendable, the presentation of the dishes are top notch, price is also reasonable and the restaurant is easily locatable. I highly recommend you to visit this place.

Desi Lane should be in everyones wishlist. It owns all the attributes and positive vibes a person expects from a fine dining place. But hey, Desi Lane hasn't kept herself limited to only fine dining;she has stretched her wings for she owns a private section, a bar, a smoking zone, a dance floor and not to forget a  lane and a scooter where you can click beautiful selfies and dps. This bollywood themed restaurant is decorated beautifully. The place is neither too bright nor shadowy. Recently i went there with my friends and we were completely bowled away by the food and service.

Mocktails:

Desi Energetic Mojito: this mocktail is a combination of red bull, lemon and mint. A beautiful combination I must say. The flavour from the red bull, the tangyness from the lemon and the soothing and cool flavour of the mint is a classic pair. You shouldn't miss this one.

Mexican Frozen Magarita: for this particular mocktail we opted for the kiwi one. It was cleary tangy and refreshing. 

Starters:

BBQ Chicken: the chicken was tender. The sauce was just apt and perfectly balanced.

Bharwan Tangri: chicken leg pieces were rubbed with spices and cooked to perfection. Juicy chicken and beautiful flavours is all you need to satisfy your hungry soul.

Stuffed Mushroom: these were bited-sized mushroom filled with cheesy gooeyness and finely chopped veggies. Can you ask for anything more? Well first try it and then thank me later.

Main course: 

Veg Mexican Sizzler:  one of my favourite. The flavours were beyond perfect. The rice and veggies were packed with flavours. They were just delicious.

Spicy Thai Fried Rice: same goes with this one. The rice was beautifully cooked and the flavours were just ethereal.

Murg Adraki Kofta Masala: loved the gravy. It was rich and tasty.  

Goan Fish Curry: the fish was soft. The gravy was smooth and yummy.

Cheese Khulcha: i am in love with this. Soft bread with cheese stuffed inside it. Sheer delight it was. Loved it. Highly recommended.

Dessert:

Chocolate Bomb: it was basically a choco lava cake with vanilla ice cream. It was rich and dense. Hot molten chocolate cake and cold vanilla ice cream-a classic  combination. 

Tri colour pops: very good in taste. 


I loved this place immensely. Each and every dish were packed with flavours. I will definately visit this place again.

Food for the body is not enough,there must be food from the soul and it can only comes when you will get the 'Desi' touch.Located in Alipore, Desi Lane is a stunning eatery.The first thing which will attract you is the entrance with a disco like pathway and the shining colorful lights.The ambience is just brilliant with desi film posters and dialouges and the sophisticated decorators.
Let's come to the food now.

In starter B B Q Chicken was brilliant,lipsmacking item,highly recommended.
Bharwan Tangri was amazingly tasty,soft and juicy.

In Veg Starter,Stuffed Mushroom one can try,it's up to the mark.

We have tried the mocktail Desi Energetic Mojito,I am sure it will please your heart and the Mexican Frozen Margarita was also enjoyable.

Veg Mexican Sizzlar was terrific in main course,the smoky flavour takes it to another level,a recommended for veg lovers.
Spicy Thai Fried Rice was extremely tasteful with the Spicy Honey Chicken.That Chicken was scrumptious.
We have tried the Murg Adraki Kofta Masala which was delicious and divine.
Goan Fish Curry was mouthwatering,again one of their highly recommended.
The first time I have tried the Kulcha stuffed with Cheese and believe me it was unbelievable,One should try the Cheese Kulcha.

A dining without a dessert is just a meeting.
Tri Colour Pop was just woooaaaow,it's yummy and wonderful.
Apple Toffy was also nice and toothsome.

The over the top foods and the grooving music gave the lunch a unforgettable experience.High Five to Desi Lane.

Ambience :
This place was difficult to locate as we couldn't find any hoarding of this place. Entrance has full on Desi look with lighted walls and a yellow scooter. Ambience is pretty good with lanterns hanging from the ceiling and colorful desi posters all around the wall. They have a dance floor as well with a desi auto and cots in that section. They also have a photo booth with props but most of the props are not in a good condition. Overall the decor won't disappoint you at all.
Food :
We had green apple mojito, cosmopolitan and vanilla kiwi amongst cocktails. Drinks  were good. We had chilli murg kebab which was way too spicy even after telling them to make it medium spicy. But they were kind enough to give us few complementary Reshmi kebabs to compensate for their mistake. We also conjee crispy chicken, chicken fried rice and Hunan fish. Fish was quite salty. Overall food was not that impressive..
Budget & service :
This is not a budget friendly restaurant and the service is okay. Service can be improved.
I would give this place a thumbs up just for the decor and ambience.

Had an overall ohkayish experience here. The cocktails could have been much better rather than disproportionate mixture of drinks. The ambience is superb and they have a huge separate dance floor but the floor was completely empty. Good place to throw a party and have a get together. The food I would say was also average and not out of the box. The murgh chilli kebab was made extremely spicy as a result of which we couldn't have it and they provided us a complimentary less spicy kebab dish. The decor is very quirky and blingy and the staff's behaviour is good too.

The ambiance is perfect and does justice with its name. The restaurant is mainly divided into 4 parts.. 1st being the contemporary high seating both for groups and for singles around the bar at the corner.. 2nd is the smoke area where you can find the desi theka style gaddis perfect for getting comfortable while puffing hookah. 3rd is the private room which is best if you are in a group.. And the last is the disc part where you will find basic chaukis like those of road side dhabas and also an auto rickshaw for clicking pictures. This place overall has the perfect decor and it provides with a lot many options for clicking great pictures.. It serves tasty food.. Tried the vegetable kebab platter and it was delicious. Again the cheese kurkure is on the recommended list as this one will simply melt in your mouth ‚ù§Ô∏è. Ordered the black forest mocktail which was extremely tasty. It's presentation is also too good. Shisha here was great and the flavor we chose was kiwi gum... The restaurant offers great combos and they are a must try as they become a bit 'kifayti'. The pocket pinch is in the higher side and somehow its worth enough.. Highly recommend!

I had one of the best time of my life here. The fact that this place has got a separate dance room with a dj and lights is all I need to be head over heels about it. The food was not overtly delicious but who cares for foods when you are dancing eh! üòà. But jokes apart, I loved the ambience and the service. The waiters are literally always at your beck and call and willing to do anything and everything for you. So if you want to have some fun time with friends this is the place for you with drinks, hookahs, dance floors, separate smoking zone etc.

This place is situated near the alipore crossing. This is a place where u can visit with ur friends or family as they have different sections of sitting arrangements for different set of people. They have separated hookah section, alcohol section & non alcohol section. The food quality is really good. We had ordered macaroni chicken pie which was real yum.. The Thai fried rice was also nicely flavoured..

Though the Mexican chicken sizzler was really bad.. it costs rs. 777 n it does not even worth 200 bucks.. we literally complained about it & they provided us two complementary deserts.. the staffs r really nice & welcoming.. the ambiance is fantastic.. will definitely recommend...

Loved the place .. ambience & decor is perfect ... This place is really cool n groovy ... We had booked the cabin for our friend's bday ... the room was decorated with balloons .. good effort given by the staff ... But just one problem here that service is a bit slow ... We had to asked them thrice for finger bowl , when we told them to increase the temperature of air conditioner they turned it off ... That was odd ... There were no attendants in the room so we had call them every time we needed something , it seemed like they were not interested in cleaning the tables too .. but the food covered it all ... Again amazing food n ambience ... The best thing smoking/hookah cabin was separated by the rest of the place which was a relief for me ... so thumps up for desi lane ..

I walked in through the brightly lit Desi Lane, which was impressive. The interiors were themed with Desi Auto, Charpai and very own desi Hamara Bajaj scooter. A brightly lit wall with various old posters... including that of Desi super hero Shaktiman! Contemporarily styled with high chairs. On the other side there's a low seating area, with STD booth, saloon and a Desi Theka or bar at the corner. A separate smoking zone for sheesha with artsy walls.

The service on the other hand needs to improve. They have good combo offers. We had ordered a veg starter which turned out to be a ready to eat McCain potato fry. The nonveg chicken seekh was really good on the contrary and made up for the veg starter. The sheesha was well prepared and so was the lemonade. The desi pulao went very well with the chicken tikka masala.
The food is good but service is slow.
The staff are friendly.
The pricing is moderate. If you are looking for theme based place then this is it.

May be its because of some few regular members who take control of playing the music via their phones. I think @Desi Lane should take a look at it.

The ambience is good. Infact the first thing that will blow your mind is the lights. It's a must for a selfie. The interior is designed in a old bollywood style with posters of movies from 60s and 70s. They have a scooter too üòÇ.
They have a segregated 'Hookah Zone' glass walled.

Food is quite high priced. But Hookah is really good. We tried the Shahi Paan out there. I must say that it's a must visit for Hookah Lovers.

Desi Lane is one place which was in my wishlist for long and I happen to check that out last Sunday evening when myself and my friends together planned for an extempore visit to the place. Located in the Enclave building in the lane where the State Bank of India, Alipore Branch is located, this place is not difficult to trace out. After dropping into the place, the first thing which would attract one is their entrance. Magnificent colorful bulbs aligned in rows giving you an optical illusion and making you a feel of a Bollywood night on its way, is definitely a brownie point added, before you are even greeted by the staffs. Upon entering inside, you are into a dimly lit area all of a sudden.

Desi Lane is Located at Alipore just Beside Paris Cafe. I'd been Visited with my friend Sunday Night. First off all ambiance is very attractive & well Decorated. There is a live Dj performance also and you can also dance here with your partner or friends.  Here we ordered Mocktails like 1.Orange Mojito. & also some Cocktails like 1. Side car 2. cosmopolitan.  Both are very tasty & also ordered Beer. After that we ordered Stater like 1. Murgh Chili kabab 2. Pan fried Chili chicken 3. Drums of Heaven. Both are very delicious and mouth- watering.  Then We ordered Main Course like 1. Chicken Biriyani 2. Murgh Nawabi Masala 3. Laccha Paratha 4.Butter Naan. Biriyani taste was very bad and some kind of smell comes from Biriyani. Don't try this item. But Other main course was tasty & delicious. Service was too much Slow and Price was little bit expensive. Overall experience was good.

Went to this place on a Sunday afternoon and it was almost empty. The entrance is very catchy and photogenic. Got ourselves seated in the smoking zone. Dim lighted and big screen. We were connected to speakers, on our request, and we played music of our own choice, which was a bonus for having less crowd.
For food we tried:
Masala cheese balls, which was disappointing.
Veg cannalonie was amazing.
Chilli cheese stuffed mushrooms was crisp and flavorful.
Thai green curry with rice was very good but the amount of veggies in the curry was too less.
We have a customised Pizza, which was crisp and juicy.
Black forest shake was wonderful, and we ordered it twice.
Malta punch was a orange cocktail, was nice.
We ordered two desserts and both of them weren't available. 
I found the prices a bit too high. The staff were also very reluctant to serve. Had an average experience.

The worst place in Kolkata to go to and I will tell why:
Service:
The place is highly understaffed and therefore the service is pathetically slow. One might have to wait for hours from ordering the food to getting it on one's table. The staff is very unprofessional.

Sanitation:
The place can be found apparently dirty with tissue papers thrown on the floor.

Toilet:
The place is too small to even fit two people and the lavatory area can not be accessed when even either of the two urinals is in use.

Price:
The foods items are priced at a rocketing level and the quality of the food does not even near the justification. Every penny feels wasted here. The price is too much for a cheap looking lounge like this which remains far from access for most of the people due to its awkward location.

I have had the worst experience ever of my life. My friends and I are never going to visit this place and neither will I recommend anyone to waste his time and money at this place.

Desi Lane is one place which was in my wishlist for long and I happen to check that out last Sunday evening when myself and my friends together planned for an extempore visit to the place. Located in the Enclave building in the lane where the State Bank of India, Alipore Branch is located, this place is not difficult to trace out. After dropping into the place, the first thing which would attract one is their entrance. Magnificent colorful bulbs aligned in rows giving you an optical illusion and making you a feel of a Bollywood night on its way, is definitely a brownie point added, before you are even greeted by the staffs. Upon entering inside, you are into a dimly lit area all of a sudden. The contrast is catchy and so is its decor which distinctly preaches the "DESI" nuances of the sub-continent.
Coming to the food, we didn't had too much as our prime agenda was to drink and smoke shisha. We ordered Pan Rasna flavored Shisha which was good as it didn't irritate my throat. For starters, we ordered Chicken Takrai, which was great. It had all the "tangy"-ness in the world with Basil leaves adding brilliance to the flavor. Full marks to it. We also had Chicken Tandoori which was very average. It failed to impress my taste buds.¬†
A word on service - it was humble and cordial which was appreciable. However, it lacked professionalism to a huge extent for which they should work on. I wouldn't have mentioned this if it was just another restaurant. But, this place is priced too high to afford such unprofessional nuances from their side.
All in all, Desi Lane could not meet my expectations of being in my wishlist for so long. However, I would plan to go there some day again to check out their main courses and a better service ! Till then, cheers !

I had gone there with my colleagues few days back. We were 11 of us and we took the rs 1100 package with including unlimited domestic drinks and 2 veg and non veg snack.
We reached there around 12:30. It was not so crowded. Drinks were served followed by snacks. We were having a good time. But after the second round of drinks we were informed that the brand of beer we were having was over and the will be serving other brand. It was really unacceptable. We should be informed about this before. It changed everyones mood.
It wasn't a nice experience but the ambience is good.

Last friday evening Desi Lane saw five friends, who went there for a get-together, but are prolly not gonna revisit again.

The first thing that struck us was the entrance- adorned with various colored lights, this place is apt for clicking pics. There also are two props (a scooter and an auto) along with several placards exclusively for some quirky clicks.

The restaurant has two parts- the outer one and the inner one, which is the smoking area. We were offered the large lounge type divan I'm the smoking area as it was the only one large enough for us all. The lights are very dim though, it's almost dark and looks a tad shady.

Coming to service, it's very slow. It took hours to get even one plate of noodles to our table. The waiters are not very helpful while choosing what to order. Nor are they helpful in letting people know about the various offers they have.
There's 1:1 offer on draught towers and pitchers, but they only provided the menu for it after we specifically asked for it. Moreover, they informed they don't have draught beer about half an hour after placing the order, nor did they have any of the 650ml beer bottles. Had it been exhausted, they'd have informed us right away. So, something's definitely fishy there. There's offer on shots, as well, but more than half of the items on menu aren't available there. This is so pathetic I feel like they should stick to only hookah and food.
Later, when we're on the verge of leaving, they came in with another offer menu with a combo of hookah, beer and a starter; and informed that they don't usually offer that to groups of 4 or 5, as it's a loss to the outlet. So there's a major flaw in the restaurant and I'd recommend everyone to steer clear of it.
Also, there's free vodka for ladies on Fridays 6:30pm onwards. We were too pissed to avail it, but there may a glitch in it as well.

Coming to what little we could find, we ordered a non-veg platter, a hookah combo and noodles.
NON-VEG PLATTER: It comprises 10-12 Tandoori preparation of chicken and fish. The pieces were beautifully charred and the dish especially was soft and supple.
HOOKAH COMBO: It consisted 4 pint-sized beers, one hookah and a veg starter- we're offered crispy chilly babycorn. The starter was okayish, and well seasoned. The beer came with a bowl of gram salad as 'chakna', which is a plus. The hookah, which was a shahi paan, was miserable though. It was so hard to smoke it, it literally was a waste. We're offered a complimentary hookah which seemed kiwi-gum and it tasted fabulous.
MIXED SCHECHIAWN NOODLES: It was a good preparation and really spicy, with adequate amount of prawn and chicken pieces.
MIXED NOODLES: It was a major dud. Although it too had adequate chicken pieces, but it lacked seasoning and taste.

Total bill amounted to over 2k, which is a bit pricey compared to the quality and the little variety that we're offered. They need to amp their game big time. The only rating they received is for the ambience, kiwi-gum hookah and the non-veg platter.

There are more restaurants with good ambience and alcohol actually available, within the same range. So this can be given a miss.

I went there few days back with my wife. This place is awesome for hangovers with friends or for a chit chat as well. Drinks are really cheaper on weekdays. Hookah was awesome. Talking about the food quality it was beyond the expectations, we tried tandoori chicken and magereta pizza both where too yummy and tasty. Prices of the food justifies the quality. Ambience was also good, staff are well mannered. Now this place becomes my favourite place to chill out.

I wish Zomato had option of negative rating, such disgraceful was the service. 
I visited Desi Lane with one of my frn on Sunday. Place ws good but the service was not good at all.
Unfoutunately, a waiter named Soumen attended us. He, being quite rude took the order but cancelled our order without informing. On query he said that items we ordered were out of stock. We gave him alternatives, but nothing was available (it ws Sunday).

Its sad that people having no work just open a cafe nowadays in Kolkata just based on decoration. Nothing more than disguisting.

Service is exceptionally poor. 20 mind after receiving the order they are informing that the item is not available. Soumen is the name of the person who took order and later on cancelled the order without informing us and on query he his informing that ordered item is not available. Soumen (note his name) was nothing more than disgusting.
We had to leave the place after wasting 20-30 mins. I would also like to clarify that it was Sunday and crowd too was not that great.

Visited this placed one Saturday Evening. Its a very descent place. Advantage of this place, Its having a really big area with 4-different sections( Dance Floor, Smoking Seating Zone, Non-Smoking Seating Zone and one seating area near the Bar). 

I would rate this 3.5*. 

Ambiance:- ¬†Good 4* ( Lighting, Posters and Banners are good) 
Food:- Good 4*
Drink & Cocktails :- Good 3.5*
Shisha/Hookah:- Good 3,5*
Service:- Good 4*, Very friendly Staff.
Value for Money:- 4* ( Pocket Friendly)

A visit to this place is worth trying, different than other party places in the town.

'Desi Lane' is located at Alipore road near crossing of belvedere road & burdwan road,just beside of paris cafe.It is situated on the first floor of Enclave building.I'd visited here this sunday night with my friends.First of all ambience is colorful & well decorated,so many seating zones are here,fully decorated with bollywood movie pictures.There is a live DJ performance also,you can also dance here & for photo shooting they provide a scooter & an auto for pose there.Coming to food we ordered here Mocktail:-'Orange Mojito',it tastes great & i ordered it 3 times.we also ordered two cocktails 'Sidecar' & 'Cosmopolitan',I don't drink alcohol,so I've no idea about their taste.Then we ordered 'Murgh Chilli Kebab' as a north indian starter,it is very spicy & taste is also good.then we ordered 'Pan fried chilli chicken' & 'Drums of Heaven' as chinese starters,both are delicious.Then we ordered Chicken Biryani,Murgh Nawabi Masala with laccha paratha & butter nan as main course.Biryani is little sour,taste is also average,Murgh nawabi masala is average.Unfortunately they don't serve varieties dessert except brownie with ice-cream & flavoured ice-cream.Food service is very slow.price is little expensive than their food quality,specially main course.

Friday night happy hour is a deal to catch. Tried the chicken 65 and pizza, both were smack. The food and drinks flowed in fast, only if you could grab the attention of the staff. The lounge had music system where were were allowed to play our own music over Bluetooth which was a pleasant surprise and helped the mood which was otherwise dull. Good place to hang out but if you are looking for an experience you may be disappointed.

This review is based on two visits to this place, Only 10 mins from my home. The Food is of better than average quality, The ambiance is very nice having 3-4 themed sitting area & a lounge, The drinks are although over priced, But they have many complimentary & combo offers that can be used, Also the best thing is that they server hookah !

Desi Lane is one of those places where you should go with your group. This is a place where you can eat, smoke, drink, dance and also take a lot of pictures.
Location is pretty easy once you reach the Alipore Xing. After boarding the lift, go to your left because on the right is some separate private office I think.
The awe starts at the entrance only with the bollywood lights and the Desi Lane Billboard on both sides. This is mainly to take photos.
Upon entering you will see a yellow themed Scooter, again only to take photos. Also available are various props to help you out.
The Seating Space is divided into 4 major sections.
On your left is the bar with high stools, on the right are high tables and chairs with a bollywood inspired Wall, move forward and on your right are Khatias or Charpais for the more rural feel, again with bollywood inspired decor and lastly, an enclosed hukka room for all the hukka lovers.
There is a separate room for smoking cigarettes and also a private room if you want to celebrate something private.
There is also a dance floor with in-house DJ and you can enjoy yourselves, everybody is allowed. There is also a yellow themed Auto Rickshaw inside.
The ambience is all in one a good one with lots of things to get your eyes open.
Went there with my girlfriend and sat on the right.
We ordered :-
Chicken Takrai - preety juicy and garnished well. Spices were moderately used but pieces were small.
Fish Pepper Salt - again garnished well, very tender, perfectly cooked and tasted awesome. But again, needed more of it.
Murg Biryani - a different biryani but very well made. Top rice of the biryani was crunchy and had a leg piece inside.
Chicken Butter Masala - a simple dish which cannot be made wrong, so no special mention.
For Drinks :-
Chatka Merry - Nothing unique but I like spicy Mocktails which cleanses your inner mouth. Again garnished well. Had small pieces of green apple and watermelon.
Kiwi Frappe - Spicy as well with glass top soaked in a mix of salt and sugar, which went well.
Total Bill amounted in the range of Rs2400.
Conclusion - Only place where you get the package of food, drinks and dance. Can easily spend hours there if in groups. So definitely go with a pocket full of money. They do take some time in bringing your order but waiters are very attentive.
Cost Benefit Ratio - 3 out of 5, because food is not according to it's price, portions are less.

We availed the happy hours and there were free shots for girls which was a bonus!! Along with that we had ordered a few starters and shisha as well. Would love to visit again!

The place has 2 separate sections- one with shisha and giant screen and other seating and well lit non smoking section. It was the IPL finals and we chose the shisha section with the giant screen. Ordered a vegetarian mixed sauce pasta and fish tikka. Both were good. For dessert we ordered a chocolate mud pie which took almost 40 minutes to arrive and wasn't worth the wait. The shisha served was good and the service was good too.

Ordered Bailey's, j & b rare , mojito ..Alas.. they had nothing to serve us with. Very disappointed. And the music..Killed the mood so bad that I could barely  keep myself seated for an hour.

Great decor. Ideal for private events. Food was of good quality and portions were moderate. We ordered for crispy chilli baby corn, crispy honey chicken and other appetisers. The crispy chilli baby corn was sumptuous and filling however the crispy honey chicken was slightly over sweet (pretty edible though). The combos being provided are extremely affordable and happy hours provide 1:1 on alchol. The interior is praiseworthy without a doubt, however better music in the smoking area would be appreciated. Staff was very helpful and suggested some good dishes. The prices are slightly high though.

Located on the 1st floor of the Enclave building at Alipore Desi Lane confronts you with an eclectic mix of sheesha in the air, a big screen airing IPL matches, a pretty decent bar setting as well as courteous staff and a menu with a lovely variety of both Indian and Chinese khans.

Tried the murg lasooni tikka which had a mild lasooni flavour but were well marinated and very succulent. The non veg platter had ten different varieties of kebabs across chicken and fish of which all were equally succulent and tasty. If I could suggest one improvement it would be to add some mutton into the platter.

The 1:1 offer on liquor only adds to the ambience and flavour and you leave for home with a heady and happy feel.

Cheers,

The attitude these people carry is so much that even Bad looks Good infront of them. Wanted to give them a negative but that not available here.

Here what we liked and what made us dissapointed on a saturday evening
- The drinks, we had a peg of white rum, a glass of Sula red. I was in a mood of shot, so ordered after eight: Blue Curacao and Vodka, loved the taste and color, cheers buddy!!üëä But i was dissapointed for not having any martini as I also had a plan for that.
- We had barbeque chicken pizza, it was cheezy and classy. Dude it was cheezy and i really mean it. Had stuffed chicken, the portion and taste is up to the mark. So,thanks for good taste.
Now, i like the ambience, the movie poster, the entry, the yellow scooter, all Love!! We did not try out the Shisha, but next time we will. 

* Special Thanks to the person who served us, you are very nice dude!!

When I rate a restaurant 5, it does not necessarily mean that the restaurant is the best but it definitely means that the restaurant is one of the bests and it continuously strives to make the guest experience better.

Desi Lane is located in Alipore, Food Bazar building.
It is spacious and divided into different sections with Bollywood posters and slogans adorning the walls.

It is a good place for private parties as well. A seperate section is there with dance floor and seating arrangements that can accommodate 20 - 25 people.

Coming to the F&B, I will list the must order items -

Desi Energetic Mojito
Berry Blast
Watermelon Cooler Mojito

Potato Corn Crucket
Chicken Lukhnowi Sheekh
Afgani Chicken

Murg Biryani
Naan with Paneer Lababdar

Brownie
Chocolate Bomb

Portions are okay. Service is good. Price is reasonable.

This place has been in my wishlist for very long.The much awaited visit with group of friends blew off my mind both in terms of ambience and food.Hence a perfect 5.

1) Mocktails

‚Ä¢Berry blast-Loved the twist added by rock salt around the circumference of the glass which was cutting through the tanginess of the drink.

‚Ä¢Desi special energetic Mojito- Loved the concoction of Red Bull and Virgin Mojito presented in a mini desi style balti.

‚Ä¢Caribbean ball punch- Perfect fruity summer drink.

2) Starters

‚Ä¢Bell pepper honey dices potato- I gorged on it like anything.Potato was crispy and covered in sweet sticky sauce on the outside and tender at the centre.

‚Ä¢Corn cheese spinach rolls- Corn and cheese combination tasted very good.

‚Ä¢Corn malai kabab- Never thought a veg kabab could taste so amazing! The creamy smoky texture of malai covering sweet corns was bliss to the taste buds.

‚Ä¢Chicken peppery- Simple dish prepared with salt and pepper which can be excellent when made with perfection.Desi lane hit that mark.

‚Ä¢Chicken Afghani-It was like chicken malai kabab.Only that it was the best I've ever tasted! Never thought such an excellent dish of mughlai cuisine will be catered from kitchen of a pub.

‚Ä¢Panfried chilli fish- This starter is my top choice in most of the places.Desi lane did an excellent job with it. Fish was flaky with crispy outside tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce.

‚Ä¢Lemon butter fish- A very light dish on the palate showcasing the subtle flavour of the fish in a good way.

3)Main course

‚Ä¢Murgh Biriyani- Again I was surprised by such excellent biriyani being served at a pub! How could it be so good I wondered.Loved the addition of caramelised onions on the top.

‚Ä¢Chicken banzaara masala- Chicken was perfectly cooked in a gravy that reflected use of Indian spices well.

‚Ä¢Paneer lababdar- An excellent vegetarian dish.Paneer was so soft and the gravy was spicy.

‚Ä¢Desi videsi- Perfect fusion of desi veg curry with addition of videsi sweet corns.

We had the side dishes with naan and kulcha which were very good.

4)Desserts

‚Ä¢Brownie with vanilla icecream-This was okayish.

‚Ä¢Chocolate bomb- It was a choco lava cake which was pure bliss for a sucker for chocolate like me.

Can't wait to come back again for their cocktails,other great offers and hit their dance floor with friends.

From the moment you enter Desi Lane,your mind will switch to party mood. You are welcomed by a hallway totally lit with coloured light bulbs and it makes for an AMAZING photo zone. You know you have come to a great place when you have a big smile on ur face right from the start ‚ò∫. The decor is pretty great! Dancefloor,disco lights,high stools and chairs, Full on DESI theme with Bollywood posters and quirky quotes everywhere you look. The ambience is rocking. Now you might think that Desi Lane is just another of the city's themed pubs with great offers on alcohol. But that's not it my friends, they serve amazing food as well! Here's what me and my friends had:-
Starters-
Chicken Peppering
Afgani Chicken
Bell Pepper Honey Diced Potato
Potato Corn Cricket
All these dishes were great choices for starters. The vegetarian dishes pleasantly surprised me. The potato dish was very very good. #recommended
Main Course-
Paneer Lababdar
Murg Tariwala
Fish Sharsho Masala
Murg Biryani
The biryani was fabulous! Served with golden brown fried onions on top which greatly enhanced the taste of the rice. The paneer and chicken dish were quite tasty too. We also had a Chinese fried rice but I simply loved their Indian fare ‚ò∫
They serve pretty good drinks and the ones we had were:
Berry Blast
Watermelon Mojito
Black Forest
Caribbean Ball
Desi Energetic Mojito(best of the lot- has an inverted can of Red Bull!!)
We finished our meal with Brownie with icecream and a molten lava cake.
Loved the hospitality and the service of the restaurant. Great place to hang out with your friends and an absolute must visit place for selfie lovers üòÅ
Cheers to Desi Lane!

Location:
Located at Alipore more beside Keventers, Paris cafe(2 buildings  before when you come from Rasbhehari avenue side). 

Ambiance:
You enter Desi Lane and you will definitely feel you are entering a Bollywood movie set( Jab we met - mauja hi mauja set). The ambiance is colourful and vibrant. The place is neither too shabby nor too bright! You have different kind of seating arrangements preferable to your need. High bar chairs, wooden table chairs and comfy sofas to relax and dine. They have private dining area too which they can reserve for private parties if needed. They also have a dedicated wooden dance floor and a DJ playing your numbers to shake your legs on the floor. 
Only issue I felt that washroom could have been maintained more and a big one was preferred.

Food:
I was lucky enough to be invited to try their all new menus! I tried more than 20 dishes and all of them were equally good. Will point out the one I felt shouldn't be missed.

Mocktails-
I loved Watermelon cooler mojito which was perfect for this scorching weather to beat the heat.

Starter - 
1) bell pepper honey diced potato :- Not to be missed. You will be amazed to know that potato can also taste that yummy in a oriental way)
2) Corn malai kebab :- Soft and succulent. So soft that it will melt in your mouth the moment you put it inside. 
3) Fish Lemon butter sauce - juicy and buttery! It was mouth watering.
4) Afghani Chicken - Soft and tender chicken pieces. Just like Reshmi chicken kebab.

Main course :

1) Murg biriyani- It was one of the healthiest biriyani i ate recently. It was neither too heavy nor too pale. It was balanced and tasted heavenly. 
2) Desi videsi was delicious, something vegetarian should definitely opt for.
3) Murg manzara masala- it was perfect dish have it with bread. The gravy was more of like tikka butter masala but tasted delicious. The gravy was thick and had that aromatic flavours to it.

Desert:

You can opt for chocolate bomb. It is like a choco lava cake in different name. The choco filled inside the cake which oozed out was orgy!!! Chocolate lovers don't miss it!


Service:

Lacked some time to bring the order fast but considering the huge order they were serving it was okay! All dishes were perfectly garnished and served. Also, the staff were courteous and quick to act on. 

They also have many deals going on! Its cheap on pocket.Part goers hit for this place as it is opened till 3am during the fri-sat night with in house DJ to make you hit the floor.

I will definitely hit this place more often. Keep it up Desi Lane Team!

Desi Lane is one of the most happening places in Alipore which offers some really good food, drinks and hookah along with a fantastic ambience to chill and have fun with friends. This place was in my bucket list since the longest time and finally got a chance yesterday to come here some of my friends. Well, this is going to be a long review. But if you want to stop reading it here and want to know if it is recommended to go or not, my answer is HELL YES!
There are different sections in this restaurant, a hookah parlour, the non smoking zone family restaurant and there is a dance floor too! Since we were a very big group of about fourteen people, they had made arrangements for us to sit in the dance floor section. The d√©cor is quirky, all fun, made up in the Bollywood style. The lane leading you to the restaurant from the entrance is a cool place to take selfies. The owners knew it very well that it is going to be a hit selfie point. Hence, they have kept many props and other cool things like a show scooter to take pictures and have fun!
Well, this is generalizing but I know I can‚Äôt help being judgmental. Generally, the food is not that amazing at hookah places or somewhere, where so much focus is given to the ambience and other aspects. Here, at Desi Lane, we were just bowled over by the food and drinks ‚Äì every item they served was better than the other one. Like seriously, I loved every bit of it. There were no scopes of complain regarding food, ambience or service. The staffs are always smiling, courteous and prompt. They filled up the glasses immediately and the crowd management skills were pretty good as well.
We had ‚Äì
Appetizers ‚Äì
Chicken Pepperi
Corn Cheese Spinach Rolls
Bell Pepper Honey Diced Potato
Potato Corn Croquettes
Corn Malai Kebab
Afgani Chicken
Chicken Lucknowi Sheekh
Fish Lemon Butter Sauce
Each one of these eight appetizers ranging from a wide variety of veg and non veg options, were excellent. Can‚Äôt describe each one of them separately, else it is going to be too long to finish; but I must say that all of them are so good that you can‚Äôt decide which one to eat and which one to opt out. As we were a big group, we survived. Voila!
Main Course ‚Äì
Murgh Biryani
Peas Pulao
Paneer Lababdar
Desi Videsi
Murg Nanzara Masala
Fish Sarson Masala
The main course items were equally brilliant. Loved it very much. Portions are commendable, you have to share a portion of biryani.
Desserts ‚Äì
Chocolate Bomb ‚Äì The classic molten choco lava cake. Tasted brilliant as the chocolate sauce oozed out of the soft chocolate cake. So good it was! Still drooling over it!
Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream ‚Äì The brownie was a fudgy one, suited to my preference but a bit sticky in texture. Still it tasted very nice with two dollops of vanilla ice cream. Pure bliss I must say.
Mocktails ‚Äì
Black Forest Shake ‚Äì Presentation wise excellent. They can work on how to mix two flavours of strawberry and chocolate since you get to taste the two separately, one after another.
Berry Blast ‚Äì Comes with a spicy twist for the salt rimmed glass, this one is a refreshing drink that you can‚Äôt miss.
Carribean Ball Punch ‚Äì Loved this drink as it soothes you with the concoction of many fruits. A typical summer drink to enjoy on a sultry evening.
My overall experience at Desi Lane was fantastic. They have some amazing Happy Hours, Ladies Night and Youth discounts. I am definitely going to come back here with my friends again to have a memorable night like yesterday over some amazing food and drinks. Happy Dining! :)

This place is bollywood theme based multi cuisine restaurant.The name is enough to catch anyone's mind.As you enter you will feel desi vibes,music of desi beat.
Location: 1st floor of Enclave building ,Alipore.
Last night i was there with my freinds and Desi lane did not‚Äã disappoint us. Actually this is one of the best place to hang out with your friends.Interior decor was very classy and that special coridor with colorful bulb is very catchy.
Now coming to the food.From starter to dessert all are equally good.Here are some food which i liked most:
*Starter*
Ginger chicken Strip-crispy dry chicken blended with the flavor of ginger and chilli paste, tastes awesome.
Chicken Pepperi-a spicy and delicious chicken dish,super delicious.
Pan fried Chilli fish-this dish is very dear to my heart.combination of chilli fish cubes and crispyness is just awesome.
Corn cheese spinach roll-tastes amazing, delicious snack for evening.
Bell pepper honey bieced potato-i love this dish. Roasted pitato with honey and bell pepper, a traditional dish with innovative twist.tasts amazing.
Potato corn crucket- also good, and great snack.
*Drinks*
Black forest-very rich and delicious drink with stout choclate flavor. Blended with kitkat,oreo ,cream coffee.
Berry Blast-it is soul refreshing. The freshness of berry you will feel in your every sip.
Desi energetic mojito-i love this most.the way they served and its tastes both fantastic.a whole can of red bull came in a desi small bulti with sour mix and mint.
Watermelon cooler mojito- looks superb as well as taste.perfect in this summer.
*Main course*
Murg Biriyani-mouth watering tastes,and differs from others.Exquisite taste of this biriyani lies in the perfect blending of ingredients.tastes 'heavenly'.
Fish sharshoo masala- this is not a traditional bengali shashoo fish dish.Desi dish cooked in a exquisite way.tastes awesome.Must try it.
Panner Lababdar-who said veg dishes can't be good.their veg dishes are extremely good.and this one is not exceptional.soft and silky cubes cooked in a spicy , juicy gravy.Damn good.
These 3 ,i liked most.beside we tried Desi Videsi,Murg Tariwali.Both dishes are also good.
*Dessert*
Chocolate Bomb- at the ending of our dinner we experienced an unforgettable dessert experience.chocolate cup cake with hot chocolate sauce.this is rich, gooey and impressive.
Browni with vanilla ice cream-delicious combo of yummy warm brownie accompanied witb vanilla.loved it.
We had a very nice experience in term of therir service,food, ambience.Highly Recommended.

Desi Lane has been on my mind ever since a failed attempt of mine to visit this place.
I'm so glad I finally visited this restaurant and how I loved everything here. The entrance is so pretty and colourful and bright. A fun & quirky place with a typical Bollywood theme with funny movie dialogues and a dramatic filmy feel.
Food was equally amazing. Honestly, I did not have any high expectations from this place and how it surprised me! 
We ordered a bunch of drinks:
‚Ä¢ Watermelon Cooler Mojito
‚Ä¢ Black Forest
‚Ä¢ Desi Theka Special (Caribbean Ball)
‚Ä¢  Berry Blast
‚Ä¢ Desi Energetic Mojito
I loved all the drinks which is a rare thing. 
Not a big fan of watermelons yet I liked it.
My favourites be: 
Caribbean Ball which was a mixed fruit drink with a dominating flavour of strawberry and cranberry.
Also, the Desi Energetic Mojito which was a fusion of Redbull along with basil and lemon. It was so refreshing!
The Berry Blast was a purple drink and was mainly black current and was light salty.
Even the Black Forest was good for a change of taste. It was more of a shake.
I loved 4/5 drinks and recommend them all cause I couldn't choose one over the other.

There were a huge number of starters the names of which I presently forgot.
I mostly loved all except one Malai one.
Main course was again a huge one. Each and every item was perfectly prepared.

Dessert had:
Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream. The brownie could've had some nuts.
Chocolate Bomb which was basically a choco lava cake.

I'm absolutely in love with this place. Definitely going back soon!

One of the most famous place in Alipore. It has taken the place of the earlier Food Bazaar located in The Enclave on 1st Floor. Its huge and the place has been divided into hookah place and non-hookah cafe kinda. The Hookah place has a cozy bed kind arrangement where one can relax and watch the TV. We were full so we did not order much. So, Cheese sandwich is what we ordered. It was normal, nothing great. Next we had Penne Arrabiata with vegetable and it was yumm. The Spices, sauce and pasta were all perfectly cooked and the right amount of ingredients. The decor is something to talk about. Some part of the walls have been designed to act as a perfect selfie background. There is also a yellow scooter put up right when you enter the place, for people to click pictures.
¬†Just 1 lacunae is that the rates are quite pricey to what they offer. It would have no complaints from my side if they had slightly lower rates. But then, overall had a great experience and being situated nearby my home, it is not at all inconvenient in location.

Desi Lane is one of the most happening places in Alipore which offers some really good food, drinks and hookah along with a fantastic ambience to chill and have fun with friends. This place was in my bucket list since the longest time and finally got a chance yesterday to come here some of my friends. Well, this is going to be a long review. But if you want to stop reading it here and want to know if it is recommended to go or not, my answer is HELL YES!
There are different sections in this restaurant, a hookah parlour, the non smoking zone family restaurant and there is a dance floor too! Since we were a very big group of about fourteen people, they had made arrangements for us to sit in the dance floor section. The d√©cor is quirky, all fun, made up in the Bollywood style. The lane leading you to the restaurant from the entrance is a cool place to take selfies. The owners knew it very well that it is going to be a hit selfie point. Hence, they have kept many props and other cool things like a show scooter to take pictures and have fun!
Well, this is generalizing but I know I can‚Äôt help being judgmental. Generally, the food is not that amazing at hookah places or somewhere, where so much focus is given to the ambience and other aspects. Here, at Desi Lane, we were just bowled over by the food and drinks ‚Äì every item they served was better than the other one. Like seriously, I loved every bit of it. There were no scopes of complain regarding food, ambience or service. The staffs are always smiling, courteous and prompt. They filled up the glasses immediately and the crowd management skills were pretty good as well.
We had ‚Äì
Appetizers ‚Äì
Chicken Pepperi
Corn Cheese Spinach Rolls
Bell Pepper Honey Diced Potato
Potato Corn Croquettes
Corn Malai Kebab
Afgani Chicken
Chicken Lucknowi Sheekh
Fish Lemon Butter Sauce
Each one of these eight appetizers ranging from a wide variety of veg and non veg options, were excellent. Can‚Äôt describe each one of them separately, else it is going to be too long to finish; but I must say that all of them are so good that you can‚Äôt decide which one to eat and which one to opt out. As we were a big group, we survived. Voila!
Main Course ‚Äì
Murgh Biryani
Peas Pulao
Paneer Lababdar
Desi Videsi
Murg Nanzara Masala
Fish Sarson Masala
The main course items were equally brilliant. Loved it very much. Portions are commendable, you have to share a portion of biryani.
Desserts ‚Äì
Chocolate Bomb ‚Äì The classic molten choco lava cake. Tasted brilliant as the chocolate sauce oozed out of the soft chocolate cake. So good it was! Still drooling over it!
Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream ‚Äì The brownie was a fudgy one, suited to my preference but a bit sticky in texture. Still it tasted very nice with two dollops of vanilla ice cream. Pure bliss I must say.
Mocktails ‚Äì
Black Forest Shake ‚Äì Presentation wise excellent. They can work on how to mix two flavours of strawberry and chocolate since you get to taste the two separately, one after another.
Berry Blast ‚Äì Comes with a spicy twist for the salt rimmed glass, this one is a refreshing drink that you can‚Äôt miss.
Carribean Ball Punch ‚Äì Loved this drink as it soothes you with the concoction of many fruits. A typical summer drink to enjoy on a sultry evening.
My overall experience at Desi Lane was fantastic. They have some amazing Happy Hours, Ladies Night and Youth discounts. I am definitely going to come back here with my friends again to have a memorable night like yesterday over some amazing food and drinks. Happy Dining! :)

This place is bollywood theme based multi cuisine restaurant.The name is enough to catch anyone's mind.As you enter you will feel desi vibes,music of desi beat.
Location: 1st floor of Enclave building ,Alipore.
Last night i was there with my freinds and Desi lane did not‚Äã disappoint us. Actually this is one of the best place to hang out with your friends.Interior decor was very classy and that special coridor with colorful bulb is very catchy.
Now coming to the food.From starter to dessert all are equally good.Here are some food which i liked most:
*Starter*
Ginger chicken Strip-crispy dry chicken blended with the flavor of ginger and chilli paste, tastes awesome.
Chicken Pepperi-a spicy and delicious chicken dish,super delicious.
Pan fried Chilli fish-this dish is very dear to my heart.combination of chilli fish cubes and crispyness is just awesome.
Corn cheese spinach roll-tastes amazing, delicious snack for evening.
Bell pepper honey bieced potato-i love this dish. Roasted pitato with honey and bell pepper, a traditional dish with innovative twist.tasts amazing.
Potato corn crucket- also good, and great snack.
*Drinks*
Black forest-very rich and delicious drink with stout choclate flavor. Blended with kitkat,oreo ,cream coffee.
Berry Blast-it is soul refreshing. The freshness of berry you will feel in your every sip.
Desi energetic mojito-i love this most.the way they served and its tastes both fantastic.a whole can of red bull came in a desi small bulti with sour mix and mint.
Watermelon cooler mojito- looks superb as well as taste.perfect in this summer.
*Main course*
Murg Biriyani-mouth watering tastes,and differs from others.Exquisite taste of this biriyani lies in the perfect blending of ingredients.tastes 'heavenly'.
Fish sharshoo masala- this is not a traditional bengali shashoo fish dish.Desi dish cooked in a exquisite way.tastes awesome.Must try it.
Panner Lababdar-who said veg dishes can't be good.their veg dishes are extremely good.and this one is not exceptional.soft and silky cubes cooked in a spicy , juicy gravy.Damn good.
These 3 ,i liked most.beside we tried Desi Videsi,Murg Tariwali.Both dishes are also good.
*Dessert*
Chocolate Bomb- at the ending of our dinner we experienced an unforgettable dessert experience.chocolate cup cake with hot chocolate sauce.this is rich, gooey and impressive.
Browni with vanilla ice cream-delicious combo of yummy warm brownie accompanied witb vanilla.loved it.
We had a very nice experience in term of therir service,food, ambience.Highly Recommended.

Desi Lane has been on my mind ever since a failed attempt of mine to visit this place.
I'm so glad I finally visited this restaurant and how I loved everything here. The entrance is so pretty and colourful and bright. A fun & quirky place with a typical Bollywood theme with funny movie dialogues and a dramatic filmy feel.
Food was equally amazing. Honestly, I did not have any high expectations from this place and how it surprised me! 
We ordered a bunch of drinks:
‚Ä¢ Watermelon Cooler Mojito
‚Ä¢ Black Forest
‚Ä¢ Desi Theka Special (Caribbean Ball)
‚Ä¢  Berry Blast
‚Ä¢ Desi Energetic Mojito
I loved all the drinks which is a rare thing.

Excuse me if I say that I found it as a smaller version of Afra Tafri with better food. 

This place offers you good music, good food, separate section for dance, bar and various sitting arrangements. 

Desi Lane has free drinks for girls on Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 6p.m. Onwards.

More to it they don't acknowledge the nearbuy coupons that we have booked and after calling and booking a table with them until their caller guy comes.

Everything about this place is perfect. Good food, Music, Happy Hours, Shisha and guess what ? Free vodka for Ladies on Fridays (though we missed it as we went on a Thursday). We had a complete meal from starters to main course along with Booze. They even served us with a complimentary Alu chaat. Also, loved the D√©cor. 

P.S. Just one request. Get a better playlist or else everything is perfect about this place.

Hey. So I heard a lot about this place from colleagues so to start with the starters I had 
fish finger which was bad (what I got for the 1st time,was full of batter, very less fish and just doughy) I had to send it back again because I was in no mood to eat that so I had asked the waiter to take it back instead he asked for it to be replaced and when it came again it was way better (less maida and more fish). Coming to the main course I had ordered a Murg Biryani, well it was nice,it had the Mughlai taste. Properly garnished and was served with a sweet and tangy raita. Next Hookah did not have proper smoke,it was okayish. 
Overall if you ask me this place is  a little pocket pinching (for students or young working people). According to me if u are looking for a normal place to chill(on the reasonable end) then I don't think this is meant for you.
Coming to the ambiance and decor gives you a nice Bollywood feel. Lastly coming to the staff,they are friendly and sweet people.

Separate room for hookah, Dj and dance floor(where very few step for dance), bar, restaurant and a private room for group parties. 
Went to celebrate my sister's birthday. 
Had to book a room paying few bucks, but usually during daytime it's not occupied so not required.
We ordered Fried rice, Chilli chicken, Hakka Noodles, Margarita Pizza and Baby corn. I loved them all except Margarita Pizza.
Hookah was average.
Good sevice.

Wonderful place round the corner. Was really not used to this kind of fun pubs in Kolkata so it was very surprising. If you're with group of friends you can definitely hop in there for a pint. 
They have all kind of beers,wine along with Hookah. Happy hour is till 7.30PM which is the safest time to go for pocket conscious people.
Don't miss it!

Literally Desi as they go too generous on the quantity of oil they cook their food in. The staff also seems quite incapable of being anywhere near to amiable. 
The decor and its quirk is may be what's only worth mentioning. I'd rather suggest that you go in once for a picture in the plush-lit corridor that marks tje entrance and then come down and gorge on bites from Kookie Jar.

Bar management team is willing to serve corona only while Kingfisher is available.
They refused to give combo offer Which we used to get .
Everyday they make new rule.
They told that only whisky will be served after 12.00 am.
But a guest sitting in the corner is getting wine and beer in front of us.
This partiality ia not acceptable.
Bar team is not friendly at all
Even the so claimed manager is refused to help us.
He ia also so rude and arrogant

This place is the perfect Adda for all the Bollywood junkies !! From the music that is played to the posters on the wall, it is as Desi as it can get! We dropped in on a Monday and was surprised to know it was ladies night! Needless to say, the alcohol was really on point . We had a tandoori platter and I haven't tasted anything quite like it before. The best thing about this place is that, it has a separate room for hookah. If you arent into it, you won't be bothered by it. The dance floor is just about the right size. With all the Bollywood numbers playing, you can't resist but showing off your thumkas! If you like Indian cuisine, you must visit this place. Having said all that, I would like to recommend the management to work on the lighting. It can really change the entire ambience. The lighting in the entrance is eye catching but the interiors dont live up to it. Loved the company of Mayank Tikmany !!

PS : A special thanks to Suman- the bartender and Pratomay our waiter for their friendly and prompt service!

It's a great place no doubt but why no one is talking about their tax system. They levy hefty taxes which is way too much to digest. They run deals of like 499/699 etc and even on that charging additional taxes which makes that deal totally useless. It's better to order individual items than to fall for those deals. 

Visited here last month with my friend. Place is really nice and waiters there very cooperative which is a big plus for them. Food quantity is sufficient and quality is good too. Music is very loud here. Found plenty of kids enjoying hookah so age certainly not an issue here. For occasional visits this place may just be perfect.

The hookah section was a disappointment. It resembled the semi cheap bars that I have been to in Delhi. Plus, apparently it's ok to spout out a chimney of hookah smoke but cannot smoke a cigarette. I had to walk out to a tiny cubby to do that. Anyway, the beer hookah combo was well priced and the side of crispy chilly babycorn that came with it was really delicious. The music in the hookah section was too loud to the point that I could not hear my companion who was sitting next to me. Also, maybe because we went on a Tuesday evening and it was a slow day, but the waiters were kind of inattentive. Overall, a nicely priced place if you don't mind the loud bollywood music, slow service and weird arrangements.

P.S I know this place wanted to emulate 90s kitsch but they ended up looking like one of those random Delhi bars where the hookah section is filled with kids in their late teens. I'd have expected kitschy 90s/80s bollywood music, and friendly waiters.¬†
Maybe I'll be back to check out the outside section, which looked much more bright and inviting .
                    
Also, as mentioned by some other reviewers, our bill had an extra item added to it that we had not ordered. It was a slow day so such a mistake is not expected.

Very disappointed with the lady who was there to attend the guest. Bought a coupon from nearbuy.We reached there and told them about the offer.without confirming any thing she just told  us bery roughly currently nearbuy is not  tied up with them. We were shocked like what was that? You should ask the guest to have a sit and  then confirm whether the offer is valid. Was very upset. We waited there for 10 mins nobody asked to have a sit. Then she confirmed it and we got a table. Desi Lane... the name solely signifies the theme of this restaurant. I am writing a review of one of the well decorated themed restaurent of Kolkata. At the entrance,the lights which will give you a feel like you are entering into a pub. Very well decorated, well maintained.. There are separate rooms available for pvt parties. And dj floor is also available.. Bought a coupon from nearbuy for chinese combo which contains fresh lime soda, soup of your choice, 1 non veg starter of your choice, 1 veg Manchurian and 1 chicken rice in main course and 1 scoop of ice cream. We ordered clear cream chicken soup , crispy honey chicken in starter. Each and every dish was yumm. So so happy with the food and quality. Crispy honey chicken was crunchy but a little bit spicy. Apart from that lady, had an awesome experience.. other stuff's behaviour is also good. But the service is too slow

Desi Lane! To go by the name, the place gives you an entire Desi feel indeed. Starting right from the decor, the lighting, the Bollywood way of interiors, the quirky designs of the handicrafts and decoratives, all brings you in the desi mood right in there.¬†

For the food and drinks, they have a good variety to offer. Here's the list of what I had tasted.¬†

Mocktails
Gondhoraj Basil Mojito
Kiwi Frappe
Bird of Paradise
Chatka Merry
(My personal favorites were the Kiwi Frappe and Bird of Paradise)

Starters
Takrai Chicken
Tangri Kebab
Red Pepper Fish
(Loved the tangri kebabs and fish dish)

Main Course
Mutton Biryani
Chicken Butter Masala
Assorted Bread - Butter Nan
Sarson Fish
(Mutton biryani was good enough. Chicken dish was good too. I didn't quite like the Sarson Fish - because of a typical smell in the dish which ruined the fish' taste)

Dessert
Fried Ice cream - this was one of its kind. Loved this!!

Overall, I would definitely suggest a visit to this place to enjoy the music, feel the ambience, and taste the good dishes that Desi Lane has to offer!

"Full On Desi Style"-Thats what came in my mind when we entered this place.Now a days with so much of themed cafe opening around,this place is quite different from others.As you enter you will see a small passage lightened with colorful bulbs and interiors decorated with full filmy posters and dialogues.One thing that we liked the most about this place was the ample space that they had which is rarely found in any cafe.The whole place was divided into three section including a dance floor and a private space.The service was quite slow especially with italian dishes.In the food,we had-

1:Dahi Makai Kebab
2:Veg Cannaloni
3:Chocolate Bomb
4:Veg Lasagne

Among the above items the "Veg Cannaloni" was the best we ever had.May that be the reason that they have takes such a long time to serve this.

You know that feeling when you are going to have one of your best days ever? That is exactly the vibes of this restaurant. The moment you slide the glass door and set your foot in, you know you've come to the right place. From the heavenly hookahs to the amazing plating of the dishes, it's impeccable. The Staff being equally friendly and considerate makes the experience even more worthwhile. And the amazing offers they come up with is literally so creative. Recent one being 'Unlimited Beer' until you PEE. Up for a challenge? You know where to be! ;)¬†
They have 4-5 cubicles just for private parties plus an amazing dance floor with your favourite Bollywood stars aligned on the wall. My favourite beverage was a Kiwi Mocktail, which was the bartender's special! I just didn't want it to end, which resulted in ordering a couple more of those.¬†
If the above reasons weren't enough for you, they serve 'chai' from SHARMA's!¬†
I'll sign off from here while you book your Uber to Desi Lane. ;)

Desi lane is located on the first floor of the Enclave building. I was on one Sunday when my friends suggested to visit this place. The name itself gives a concept that it has touch of rural and urban theme. And they have done full justice to it with the help of the interior. I loved the ambience. We first placed ourselves to the hookah zone but since it was too much conjusted we later shifted to the area where the dj is being played. Coming to the food we ordered cheese kurkure, one veg platter and cheese balls. The first two dishes were quite good but the cheese balls failed to satisfy us. It was salty and so we asked for replacement. But even after that it did not hit our taste bud. So we asked to cancle the order. Coming to the dj .. the dance floor was really good and fun. The old retro songs were played which made everyone groove. The service was not upto the mark may be because it was crowded. While checking our bill we also spotted that they added an extra dish which we haven't ordered. Management needs to be better i guess. Overall experience was ok.

It was on my wishlist for long... and lastly visited with some of the friends yesterday... the deco was amazing... their entrance lane is so beautifully decorated with colorful bulbs that you will not be able to stop you from clicking a photo over there... Service was very good... staffs are very well trained and courteous too... we tried some of their mocktails along with some delicious starters, main course n desserts... Of which...

"Gandhoraj basil mojito" n "Chatka merry" in mocktails were so refreshing n tangy...

In the starters "Paneer tread", "Takrai chicken", "Tangri kebab" n "Red pepper fish" were just insane... a must try dishes over here...

The main course compised of "Punjabi aloo dum", "Desi videsi", "Dal hariyali", "Chicken butter masala", "Sarson fish", "Mutton biryani" n "Assorted bread"... and undoubtedly all were very good... the ingredients were fresh and also the meats were very well marinated before use... as because the flavors get absorbed into it and making the dish more delicious...

And the "Fried ice cream" as the dessert was the cherry on the top to end the dinner...

A place like this can be enjoyed only when you visit with some of you rocking friends like mine...

Pocket pinch was quite acceptable...

The concept of a full on desi theme has always been popular amongst restaurants but very few of them have unflinchingly pulled it off the way Desi Lane does. The restaurant is located in a posh locality in Alipore, on the 1st floor of The Enclave building.

The place absolutely justifies its name with its strong, sparkling interiors which reflect the vibrancy of rural, desi parties and eateries. Speaking about the d√©cor, honestly I wasn‚Äôt expecting so much variety under a single roof. The entrance lobby is the area of highlight, which has a parallel array of bright coloured bulbs on the side of the walls and the ceiling, as it provides that peppy impression to the customers as if waling into a superstar‚Äôs green room. Walk right in, only to be greeted by another selfie spot and a multi-coloured scooter. The place is huge and is divided into several sections. There is your main restaurant area, a discotheque, a dedicated hookah lounge, a 15-seater private party room and a larger private room which can accommodate about 40 souls. Even on the inside, one will find numerous posters, graffiti and highlighted portraits on the walls all around the restaurant. The seating arrangements are also pretty sorted out ranging from high chairs to the comfy sofas. Other innovative ideas have been used in creating an essence of a desi lane with sections resembling a rural liquor shop, a salon and a beauty parlour.

To sum up my experience, I would say it was an incredible evening spent in the company of close friends and some lip-smacking food, not to forget the scintillating ambience at Desi Lane.

Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Located on the first floor of Kookie Jar(Alipore), this restaurant is one of the most happening places in Kolkata. From the walls to the furniture to the food, everything is quite 'desi' here.

The area is divided into 3 major sections :

¬∞The private section
¬∞The common restaurant 
¬∞The dance floor (there is literally an auto-rickshaw in this room)

The seating is amazing with plus sofas on one side and 'khatiyas' (the ones u see in roadside dhabas).

Coming to the food, it is just as good(if not better) as the decor and whole feel of this place.

We started off with :

‚Ä¢Gondhoraj basil mojito and chaska merry : I loved both these drinks. The mojito was citrusy and refreshing whereas the chaska merry was 'chatpata' with hints of chilli.

‚Ä¢Red pepper fish : This was a Chinese preparation and I loved it. The fish was perfectly fried along with onions and peppers and the sauce was a bit spicy.

‚Ä¢Tangri kebab : The tangris were unbelievably good. The meat was juicy and tender and was almost falling of the bone. Loved this one.

‚Ä¢sarson fish : This dish was exquisite. No, this dish was not at all like the Bengali 'shorshe jhaal'. The gravy was very mild and the fish almost sort of melts in your mouth. 

‚Ä¢chicken butter masala : Probably one of the most famous dishes ever. Desi Lane does pure justice to this dish and it was brilliant.

The assorted naans were great too.

For a sweet ending to an already awesome meal, the fried ice cream was served. It was pretty decent I'd say!

Overall, I have fallen in love with this place. Yes they serve alcohol and the dance floor is amazing. The DJ belts out pretty cool tracks.

Service was very prompt and excellent!

It's amazing how you can find such a place in the midst of the city! If you're looking to host a Retro Theme party, your search ends here. The entire restaurant is decked up with posters and decors reminiscing the 90s era, and you may well think this is some film set, with different props scattered around the place for you to click pictures. What's more, is that they even have hats, masks and quotes boards for you to pose with! The lights just act as the sweet cherry on top. 

The restaurant sprawls over a pretty wide area and has separate rooms for shisha, non-shisha and the disco and all of them are beautiful in their own ways. 

I went with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised that I had been unaware of the place till then. Done with the ambiance and decor, coming to the food, my order went like:
Mocktails:
Kiwi Frappe and Gondhoraj and Basil Mojito were absolutely the accompaniments you would want. Chatka Merry gives you a jhatka, but if you're game for some quirky flavours, try this one.

Starters: 
1. Tangri Kabab: It resembled more a drumstick, and less a tangri. But the taste more than makes up for it.
2. Takrai chicken: Thai dish, done innovatively with some tinge of Chinese style of cooking.

Main Course:
1. Garlic Naan, Lachcha Paratha and Assorted Bread Basket
2. Butter Chicken: Soft, creamy, buttery chunks of chicken in thick gravy.
3. Sarson Fish: Desi touch, and went really well with the bread. 
4. Mutton Biriyani: I thought I have covered most of the good Biriyani houses of Kolkata, but then this place proved me totally wrong. The biriyani here definitely has made me give full marks to the place! No oil oozing out, no bright yellow chawal, no hard mutton - you definitely need to try out the Biriyani here.

Desserts:
We were too full to go for anything but Fried Ice Cream, and it provided the perfect end to a beautiful meal. 

This place is for the hipsters who care for both their food and drinks(and selfies) and for the old who want to revisit those old times of Cinema. Overall, totally recommended!

Rural environment amidst this urban chaos!
Located at the first floor of Enclave building at Alopore.. just beside cookie jar!
Very spacious.. as soon as you enter you are welcomed with a passage of colorful night bulbs.. a selfie area with a yellow scooty to pose !

The section on right side .. compromises of a dance floor, DJ music and an auto rickshaw which has vibrant color is all set to make you go crazy! 
The walls with movie posters.. of old and new!
The seating arrangement are very comfortable.. adding to the theme .. sofa and charpais..

The bar counter.. the seating arrangement on the main area.. and the music makes you feel excited.

Another section is there.. which has a TV and good seating arrangement on the couches for big groups .. to book and have a match screening or a get together!
The ambience is just awesome!

Coming to mocktails .. we had gondhoraj mojito and kiwi frappe which were very nice.. 

Starters comprised of chicken tangdi kabab, takrai chicken, and red pepper fish which was amazing in quality and quantity!
Loved them

In the main course.. we had chicken butter masala, butter naan and garlic naan, sarson fish ..And mutton biryani .. loved each one of them.. 

Service was really nice.. and prompt !

This place is highly recommended!


Quirky vibrant colours, old hindi tracks of 90s and fusion food is the standpoint of Desi Lane..

Desi Lane is just beside Alipore More, on Alipore Road. They are located on the first floor. Great food with mighty ambiance. At very entrance you will see the beautiful gate of Desi Lane leading to inside. The inside is divided into 3 section. One is private dining area, the main seating area and the DJ floor.
Food is fantastic here. Let me tell you what are the things I liked the most.
Mocktalis:
‚Ä¢ Desi Thekka Special and Bird of Paradise : Both of them are are excellent.
.
Starters:
‚Ä¢ Chicken Tangri Kebab : Comes in 6 pieces of Chicken Tangri. One of the best I have tried.
‚Ä¢ Corn Malai Kabab : Corn pasted and made Kabab of it. Very soft and wonderful to taste.
.
Main Course:
‚Ä¢ Mutton Biryani : This was something worthy. The Biryani was very good.
‚Ä¢ Naan and Garlic Naan
‚Ä¢ Chicken Butter Masala, Dal Hariyali and Sarso Fish all were really really delicious.
.
Desserts:
‚Ä¢ Fried Ice cream: Ice cream fried in such a way that the crust was thin which added to the taste.
.
The dance floor added more charm to the night after the food. :)
Desi Lane is 100‚ÑÖ worth visiting.

There is a lot of buzz about this place because of its varied offerings - open till late night, hookah, dance floor, great drinks and excellent food! Naturally it was on my radar for quite sometime, and we finally decided to go here last night.

As I entered I understood what all the fuzz was about its magnanimously bulb-lit entrance. You just can't avoid spending a good time here just getting your photos clicked! And I walked in further, I was a little surprised because of 2 things - it seemed way too lighted in the pics, and I didn't imagine it to be this loud either. Thankfully we sat down in the hookah area which insulated us from the loud noise in the dance area. The look and feel to this place is indeed desi! From the walls to the attire of the staff.

The staff helped us with placing our order and suggested what would be good and what wouldn't be according to the mood of the evening. I felt it a tad bit irritating that they strongly suggested us to not order dishes that would require some time in cooking. Like the Day's special cocktail or the crispy chicken wings in spicy sauce. We went ahead and ordered that chicken dish anyway only to be later told that it wouldn't be possible, and in substitute they gave chicken wings in barbecue sauce. Also, they hardly had any variety in beer. I hope they work on these things!

For starters we had
Corn Malai Kebab - we were suggested to not order this as it wouldn't suit well with drinks, but we ordered this nonetheless - and it was fantastic! Soft and mildly sweet kebabs well roasted! Served with chutney and salad in a papad bowl. 6 pieces meaning quantity was good too! I would recommend this dish!

Paneer Cheese Roll - served with chutney and salad in papad bowl - was nice and cheesy with a tasty stuffing inside! Good quantity as well (6 pieces). Recommended.

Sultani Paneer Tikka - served with chutney and salad in papad bowl - was spicy all right! But Paneer should have been much softer and spent more time in the tandoor. They could have made this better.

Chicken wings with BBQ sauce - now I didn't taste this personally, but my friends who did said this was better than all the Veg ones - so you could definitely try this out.

Masala Papad - it costs ‚Çπ100 but it sure is masaledaar! 4 papads nicely served with a lot of finely chopped onion, cucumber and tomato along with abundant chaat Masala. It goes well as chalna for your drinks! Recommended.

In main course we had
Dal Makhni - rich and creamy and tasted of perfection! Quantity could be slightly more but it was excellent nonetheless! Must try

Desi- videsi sabzi was recommended by the staff since we had a tough time picking a veg non Paneer spicy sabzi and didn't want to go with Jalfrezi. It is basically a mix vegetable sabzi prepared in a creamy gravy. It was good...not great! Would have liked it spicier.

Garlic Naan and Tandoori roti - nice crisp and tasty.

We had Gum Supari hookah along with drinks which included - green apple frozen margarita, LIIT, Red wine Sangria, Heineken beer and Black Dig scotch. The cocktails were fantastic! I'd recommend all of then, especially the Margarita.

It should be noted that the table is little small for 4 people to simultaneously have hookah, drinks and food. But with slightly moving of the dishes here and there it is manageable.

Overall, you can't go wrong with this place! Excellent food and drinks and atmosphere! You should definitely check this out soon if you already haven't :)

Located on the first floor of kookie jar , alipore. A vibrant entrance, trendy decor, with a dramatic twist to it. 
This place has 3 sections. The disc area, the section where shisha is served, and one without shisha. 
Music, ambience, is great. 
For mocktails we ordered for Gondhoraj and basil mojito and kiwi frappe. The mojito was refreshing enough. 
Starters included Takrai chicken, Red pepper fish, Tangdi kebab. Good quality, and tasty food. Loved each of them. 
For main course, there was Sarso fish, Chicken butter masala, Dal hariyali, a mixed veg called desi videsi with assorted breads. 
And Mutton biriyani of course. 
Mutton pieces were tender, and the fragrance was amazing. 
The fried ice cream for desserts, gave the meal a sweet ending, just as much it was needed. 

Loved the disco area, and the decor of the section. Total party feels. 
Great experience. Cheers!

The idea to visit this place came from the colorful pictures that some of my juniors had been posting on instagram¬†with the corridor of this replicating some red carpet avenue of a cinema hall. So when an old school friend and I caught up for a movie on a Sunday afternoon, we felt a craving for Indian good and decided to visit this place. Only when we reached this place, did I realize that it was on the same floor of one of our favorite haunts, Chai Break. ¬†The place is huge. There are many sections. One is specifically dedicated to people who wanted to enjoy hookah along with their meals. There are also sections where you can arrange for private parties. The main section is a huge, with different kind of seating arrangements - high tables, bar seats, sofa, etc. We made our way to one of the sofas. The walls of the place is pasted with movie quotes and posters of yesteryear movies. ¬†They could have done something innovative with the roof. They also could do something with the music too. It does not match with the theme of the place.¬†

Since we were hungry, we decided to skip the appetizers and ordered ourselves the following:
1. Dal Makhani¬†
2. Paneer Kadhai
3. Chicken Butter Masala
4. Masala Kulcha
5. Cheese Garlic Naan
6. Lacchedar Paratha

As you can see we had ordered a desi lunch. The dishes were filling and delicious. I think if we had one more person with us, we could have wipe it clean. We ordered ourselves some pints of KIngfisher as they did not have many of the brands mentioned in the menu. The staff was courteous but forgetful. Though they took some time but served all of the food together. Then we got to clicking pictures in the now famous corridor of lights. They have some funny signboards which you can use while clicking those pictures.¬†

All in all, a fun day came to an end with a hearty desi meal!

A very unique food and beverage outlet located in the posh locality of alipore.
I was honoured to be invited by the director Mr Manish sharma who is a phenomenal host. I went for the inauguration party with a friend.

The restaurant is spread over a huge 7000 sqft. The utilisation of space has been done very strategically keeping space and comfort in mind. The segregation are-
1) The main restaurant/lounge area
2)The dicotheque
3)The dedicated hookah enclosure
4) Private dining room for 40 pax
5) Small private dining room for 15 pax.

On entering you find the retro styled multicolored bulb set up which takes you back in time. Further down you see the classy bar been laid out. The seating had comfortable indian charpoy giving it a desi feel. Moving on to the dance floor it was equipped with hifi sound system for a mind bogling experience. The djs console is situated inside a open auto. Man thats creativity personified. The place has a lot of influence from bollywood posters and dialogue. My favourite was "pushpa i hate maths".üòÇ

Coming to food and beverage. One can avail 5 star worthy food here. As its a multicuisne restaurant it offers a lot of variety. Beverages are also a big plus. Sheesha here addons to the overall experience . Service is quick and the staffs are courteous.

My conclusion is that this place is the MUV of the restaurant genre and has something for everyone.
Highly recommended for all. Keep it up team DESI LANE.üëåüëç

Since the Bartender repeatedly asked me to review them, here I go. This place situated near the Alipore more is huge. It has a hookah section, some normal seating area, and a bar too. The happy Hour menu is a steal. 1:1 offer on any liquor and free shots for the ladies. They provide you with a few good deals on few hookah combo too. The desserts are great. There is a disc area too. The decor is awesome and the staff is really polite and helpful. I loved this place. Had an awesome experience, and will definitely go back again! :)

I have been here twice already in a span of 10 days, and both the times, my experience was 'darun'. 
The ambience is very unique, very desi and hatke. You'll find hints of 'mirch masala' decor here as well. There's a section cordoned off for smoking /hookah parlor and dance too. 

Firstly they offer some very good hookah combo menus which are a good bargain ! The Teen Paan Hookah is well made, strong and recommended with ice base(100rs extra)
The liquor deals on happy hours are well worth it. 1:1 on straight drinks till 7.30pm and shots for girls from 6pm onwards. Since we were a group of 2guys+3girls you can imagine the amount of liquor consumed. 

To the Food now, we tried the Veg mixed sauce pasta, which was really good. We also had Tangri kebabs, 2 large Leg pieces, but the cost is a tad bit high. 
The Grilled Cheese sandwich is good too ! 
You can also let yourself loose on the dance floor :)

Well, a pretty new place with a hell lot of space. Interiors are pretty well done . The music played is good. There's a special dancing area with the dj console. There's a separate hookah section and also a separate smoking zone.
The price in the menu is very cheap. In 700 bucks, you get a single flavoured shisha, one veg starter and 4 pints of kingfisher premium beer. That's really cheap. But the demerit in the bill is that they charge separately for service charge and service tax. For a bill of 700, the tax comes up to almost 200., which is a lot.
Keeping everything in mind, a nice place to be in for an evening.

As the name suggests it's a true desi by all means, be it there food or interiors. The interiors are very vibrant and colourful‚Ä¶ The main reason for going to a restaurant is food and Desi Lane doesn't disappoint you. The staffs also treat you nicely. We had a very nice experience in terms of service, food and ambiance. Will surely visit again!

As you enter, you are welcomed by colourful zero watt bulbs and at first sight is the bar which makes you wonder if you have landed up in a lounge/pub with your entire family including kids or is it a restaurant. It's only when you get accustomed to the dim light inside in due course can you identify more seating. It's a three in one place I would say. It has a pub, it's a restaurant and a sheesha corner too. 

I heard they have another banquet too in the same floor but I missed it. Couldn't locate the entrance to it. 

Anyway, the Mojito was good to taste but the glass was way too narrow and full of ice and mint leaves and lemon that there was hardly any liquid to savour for long. Veg platter was good enough for four of us to start with but then you do need to order something else to keep the munching going else you would sit with an empty plate. Portions are relatively small in the main course. The pudina paratha(corners burnt) was just OKish and the black daal had to be replaced as the first one had a peculiar taste. 

Overall a nice experience to be in this new place around Alipore as there aren't many places you can go to in this locality. But for the food, I am sorry, I  think it's nowhere close to awesome and finger biting. 

They need to do a way better job in cooking well and cooking right. Hopefully I won't be disappointed in my next visit if so. 

Another disappointment I would emphasise on is that it's Bollywood graffiti is loud instead of blending subtly with the concept.

This is a great place to hangout with your friends and family. The food was good and the staffs were so welcoming. To our surprise they served us some good shots 'fire shot' and it was too hot to handleüòç As Wednesdays are ladies days all the ladies out there were treated special with free vodka shots (unlimited). There are Khatiyas to sit and the whole @place is based on Bollywood theme. The entrance is so peppy and the whole place is so Desi.. The graffitied scooter‚Äã and the auto is sure to give you the Desi feeling ever. The DJ really played good music . I had a great time there with my friends holding the play cards and posing like the celebrities.

The interior is based on desi theme with all the correct flavours being added from bollywood film posters on walls to khatiyas for sitting. Specially the entrance is ravishing.
The quality of food is good not so outstanding though. The service was great. It was girl's night on Wednesday and to our surprise they served us free unlimited shots.
There's a DJ section and dance floor too.
Overall the experience was great and I would love to visit it again.

Located on the 1st floor of Enclave Building just below Alipore Chai Break, near Alipore State Bank. Its the same place which was earlier Food Bazaar. With an average rating of 3.9 its featured under themed restaurant on zomato- that was the reason i decided to visit this place. The restaurant is divided into 4 sections- Dance floor, Bar area, Smoking zone -where they serve sheesha & a private section. The place looks quite dull and deserted ¬†with the number of staff members being more than the number of guests. The smoking area looks very shady and suffocating as the lights are dim with one television playing at the peak of its volume. They have two seperate menu- one for the starters & another for main course. Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala & Aloo tasted good but the Breads tasted okayish. The staff members are a bit rude with strange behaviour and a lot of sarcasm. The food items are Overpriced and the place is hyped. I wonder how did this place managed to get a rating of 3.9. The quality of sheesha served is also not that great. There are lot many better options in themed restaurants in kolkata.

An over rated place. We wer not even given a proper computerised bill ! We wer jst handed a smal white paper with the amount written n tax amount added. Wen askd for a proper bill. The staff says due to hookah ban problems in Kolkata we cannot give the bill. Amd wen we askd on the bill counter we wer told der is some problem vd d software. And so we cannot gv the bil. 

They took almost more than 30 mins to get a plate of french fries even though the restaurant was almost empty. Dat too tasteless. 
Wen we called the staff to ask him to take it back n add some pepper salt. He came on our table. N rather than listening to us he was busy watching tv ! There is No Professionalism among the staff at Desi Lane.

Whenever you visit don't forget to try their cocktail LTE,B52,pink merry,absolutely blue and jager train, margarita, cosmopolitan taquila shootz along with the foods..I liked each of them I mentioned..very very big thanks to Ahamed and the bar counter wala bhaiya who treated us like special guests.. Music Dj and the dance floor are good too. Ya a bit expensive,but they worth every penny .. I bet you will not find any night clubs without entry charges and cover charges on the new year eve.. Once again Thanks to Desi Lane.

Another overrated place! I have no idea how this place has got 3.9 rating! This place is so hyped and overpriced!
Firstly, the food. There is not one single non-veg item below 375 bucks. We took chicken seekh kebab worth Rs. 375 and it had 6 very small sized pieces and they tasted nowhere near to kebab! Next, Cheese Mushroom worth 325 bucks. This one still tasted good..so no complaint about this one. Rest we just had 1 hookah, 1 bottle of Budweiser(330 ml) and 2 pegs of Bagpiper and the bill came around 2.2k. We literally freaked out seeing the bill. Now ALL OF THIS would have been justified if the ambience was also good enough. I understand that this place has stressed on the desi features of our country..but atleast some comforts of a typical lounge should be provided. Firstly the seats. There were literally 'KHATIYAS' for us to sit. It was so uncomfortable..! We could barely position ourselves to sit on those. Now the room was totally dark and there was a huge TV playing some really bad songs repeatedly. The brightness of the TV hurt our eyes in the dark. Whereas the food section is so bright and colourful playing some amazing music, the hookah section where we were made to sit was very gloomy and disappointing.
Also, the waiters are not well trained and not professional. Most of the times there was no waiter in the hookah section. And whenever one came, he was busy taking up the dishes with the left over food without even asking if we are done and if they can clean up. We asked one of the waiters to suggest us some of their best dishes and were told to order Chicken Seekh Kebab and I have already mentioned how it turned out to be.
Altogether, my experience in here was quite bad!

Okay.. So desi lane is easily located and has replaced food bazar in alipore.  Peppy ambience with very thoughtful interiors. It has seperate sections ..u enter like a bollywood star.  Look around and feel like I have entered a bollywood setup . Rocking interiors however it needs complimenting music too. 
The waiters are very enthusiastic to serve you.. So the service is pretty good. (They need to take a break as the customers need their privacy to talk too!!) 

Coming to the food.. Its value for money . I had oan fried noodles and a pina colada.. Decent.  :-) it's on my next visit list to try more of the space .

Ambience of this place just justifies its name and every bit of it has a desi touch. It gave a very cozy or rather comfortable feeling.
Drinks served to us were perfectly made and d starters were served absolutely hot.
This place has amazng props to click pictures with and the look of the entrance is gorgeous.....totally a picture taking zone!!!
Most importantly the food was delicious, the dal makhani, punjabi aloo and biryani is a must try here.

If u are looking for a unique restaurant cum bar, then Desi Lane is the place to be... The ambience is simply something one has never experienced in Kolkata before. It is just like a local street with barber shops type themes, movie posters, khatiyas¬†(beds) as sitting places, etc etc... What's more is there's an Autorickshaw and a typical Bajaj scooter inside the place to excite all... The nostalgic movie posters from the golden era of Hindi ¬†cinema, the witty phrases all around will amuse you... It's like a walk down the memory lane of the old times before modernization of India.¬†

Additionally, there are games that one can play like the foosball, darts, spin a wheel, dice etc.

Wide choice of food and drinks with a variety of cocktails and mocktails will surely delight your taste buds. It's a fun place to be for sure and definitely a place one should visit with family and friends alike. Wouldn't like to spoil the fun by saying all that I found interesting there... So do visit this place if you get a chance...¬†One thing is for certain, if anyone visits Desi Lane, he or she is bound to return... for its one place you can never forget.

Keep up the good work Team Desi Lane!!!

Amazingly themed and offers a great ambience. The quirky posters and the Desi khatiya were well thought of. Could be visited with both family and friends as the place hosts family crowds as well. The Service is very quick and they ensure all guests have a good time.
Do check out the Chinese dishes if you're looking for something spicy and crisp. 
Desi Lane surely lives up to it's name by creating the most suitable environment for Desi lovers.

Hariyali Daal, Desi Videshi mixed veg and Fried Ice Cream are signature dishes which one can relish over there.

I have been to this few times by now, and every time I step in the place..its always brimming with life. The food here is awesome.  I have tried their North indian food, Chinese and also few of the Italian dishes. All of them very relished by my taste buds.  But the best thing about the restaurant is that it has carved out a space for all. A separate section for family groups and parallely a separate section when you are dining with your friends. 
You can walk into the place and let the balance be taken care by their courteous team. Seems I have found another favorite joint!

Located on the first floor of the bldg The Enclave at the Alipore StateBank crossing - perfect adda placeto chill out with friends in desi style. Visited one sunday evening - the place is over crowded and noisy. But the highway like¬† theme with roadside low seaters and the bar - Desi Theeka will attract every guest to visit this place again and again. There are private dinning areas for family who would prefer to enjoy food away from the crowd and noise. Nothing new in the menu, but the food was good - butter lemon fish. In terms of service and hospitality, this eatery is a bit messy. Looks like they are still not yet well settled to serve the guests.

A newly opened Resto bar in Alipore, the place is a must visit whether you planning a casual dine out with friends, family time over food, Night out with music and drinks or a private party for your group. The theme - totally desi with the right combination of quirkiness, adores the walls and indoors and the food - perfect for every taste and cuisine. Don't forget to get yourself clicked at the photo booth, on the scooter or inside the auto. Options galore, Desi Lane rocks..

The restaurant opened right next to my place. Had been planning to visit for a long while, ever since the soft launch. 
The ambience is okay. Desi lane doesn't match with the feel. The old posters is the only design feel. The chairs are so high! Almost like a bar. And the sofa are so low. The distance between the table and the sofa is so much that u have to shift aage and bend over to eat!!! 

The food is a major let down. We were two of us. So we order cheese kurkure kebab as starters- it was  bland. The roti covering was to thick. And the filling was bland. All u could taste was cheese. No seasoning, nothing. 

Then we ordered for a hariyali sabji moti and a lachcha paratha. The sabji was horrible 
üôàüôàüôà semi raw veggies, bland taste. 

The roti though was crisp and thin.

Went on a Sunday. It was chocobloc. Still preferred to wait for almost 35 - 40 mins. Have no idea how almost 40 minutes passed. I Was just looking at the amazing interiors & my wife & son were busy taking selfies. So courteous staffs that even after being over occupied due to heavy rush they served us water & offered a fresh lime to my son free of cost...100 rupee worth of free fresh lime is not a big deal but its difficult to see this kind of a personal touch & respect for guests ...most restaurants don't even allow to stand in the restaurant area when they are full.  Food quality was equaly good & worth the wait. As far as the food quality is concerned would rate it amont the top 3 in kolkata. Will recommend a must must visit for this place. Completely in love with this place.

Desi Swag, Desi Thumka, Desi Paani & Desi Khana => At Desi Lane..!

If you need to beat at the dance of some Desi Thumka, if you need to travel the unexplored roads of the National Highways, if you need to sit upon a Desi Bajaj and pose for some cool selfies, if you need to get swaved with some filmy swags of Sallu Bhai or Madhuri Dixit, if you need the feel of traveling upon the top of a truck across the green fields, if you need to enjoy some Desi ambiance, and most importantly if you need to feast on some lipsmacking food with some desi twist, #desilane is the place to drop by.

With a space of larger than life, portraying the various aspects of #desipanti, Desi Lane strives to be a bit different from a traditional cafe or restaurant. The ambiance and decor here alone are bound to sway you over. With the eyestriking lightinings, the fancy posters across the wall, and the cool food and drinks, come here if you need to relax with your buddies, or even host a get-together, or a party, for you would never get enough of this crazy #desipanti, no matter how hard you try to.

Located near Alipore State Bank, the place is not at all hard to locate. If you know where Chai Break is, then just hop on to the first floor of the Enclave Building, to intoxicate and mesmerize yourself into a world of fun, happiness and joy. The very entrance has these cool and bright lights, glowing up the mini hallway, very much resembling the sparking lightings you would find at the rural fares. Once you cross the array of dozens of nightbulbs, the selfie booth and your very own Bajaj Scooter is right there waiting to welcome. For a country, which boasts of its #desipanti, what better way, but to keep the colorful ‚ÄòHamara‚Ä¶ Bajaj‚Äô scooter right on the walking zone to surprise your senses!

The main sitting area houses some cool ‚ÄòCharpai‚Äô, as one may see on the roadside Dhabas. The Charpai section has been divided into separate halves, with each of these halves, displaying a unique theme of its own. While one depicts the ultracool saloon with an Old Spice After-Shave, another one showcases a quirky ‚ÄòSallu-Bhai‚Äô advertisement. The opposite portion of these Charpai, has this superlong display board (Against the length), with again some cool, quirky and desi jokes scribbled all over it. There are two separate sections (as in rooms), which houses kind of the same #desitheme, but in a different way, and are always up for grabs for any private party bookings, kitty party, birthday or any sort of get together or events.

As for our visit, we were cordially invited by the management, to try some of their food and drinks. Below, I would list everything that were up for grabs for us.

Mocktails

1. Mango Mist ‚Äì A strong and tangy drink. Expected a sweeter and mild version, but the drink simply blew us away.

2. Strawberry Mojito Frappe ‚Äì The texture was somewhat in between a fizzy drink and that of a shake. The strawberry flavor was quite refreshing. The mint provided the tang and ice made the drink quite a soothing one.
                                          ...

Twirk your tongue at the Desi Lane..!

When Kolkata is booming with newly themed restro , yet another addition to the Alipore forefront is the Desi Lane. The name is imperative to what it suggests. The rural lanes and bylanes, quirky colours, old hindi tracks of 90s and fusion food is the standpoint of Desi Lane.

Location :  Located at the first floor of The Enclave" near the Alipore Road SBI crossing.

Decor and Ambience : Much to say about the mesmerising decor of the Desi clad food joint. It is more of a quirky myriads of colours which should evoke the selfie-conscious souls. As soon we entered, we were greeted by a passage dunked in with coloured nightbulbs giving it a set up to commemorate psychedelic punk. To step in with a smile, the scooty with its quirky colours is all set to make you gleeful. The adjacent section is a bundle a bundle of joy indeed. The insanely tinted auto-rickshaw standing with the floral blocks is set make you go craze along with a lineage of movie posters from present to yesteryears which permits private bookings.

The rest of the section draws its inspiration from the rural Indian lanes and by lanes and thus the name. The bar is the  ‚Äòdaaru ka thek‚Äô with the netted couches (khatiyas) and high raised stooled dispersed throughout the rest of the seating area with wallpapers od old Bollywood posters and comics. The restro is designed with saloons and furniture shops lined with weird names with weird spellings as seen in the rural Indian lanes. The ambience is correctly set with old Hindi bollywood tracks being played in humongous bass.

Food: Going on the foodward way

Beverages-

1. Mango mist ‚Äì The tangy twist in a mango drink added to the taste.

2. Strawberry mojito frappe ‚Äì The fizzy strawberry mojito spoke tonnes with its refreshing taste.

3. Volcano 007 ‚Äì The sweet fizzy chocolate drink was quite liked by all.
                                          ...

Placed an order for a chicken steak and a chicken tikka masala kabab for home delivery. After 20 mins of placing the order I got a call from them saying that the steak was not available. I went ahead with the kabab order. 
The kabab was absolutely chewy and unedible!! The mint chutney served with it was watery. I don't think that I would want to order again. Paid 450 bucks for this. What a waste of money!!!

Great Food. Great Location. Massive space. They have separate dining sections for groups, a decent sized lounge.
The only problem I found was the noise coming from the lounge everytime the door opens , that's too loud for the people sitting inside.

We were a group of 20 and we took a private area of the venue. Each and every guest in our group enjoyed the venue, the ambience, the fact that we were in a private area which felt like a private home longe where we could unwind the way we want. The food was awesome, the energy of the team of Desi lane was such that they were eager to give us a great experience. Loved every moment. Thank you desi lane for making our evening memorable.

First of all its got no signage at ground level making it tough to locate
when you reach the first floor, it looks like under construction because of the outside
seating is not really comfortable and the place is too too bright that it hurts the eye
the food is below average and there is a massive room for improvment
the service is quick which is the only thing i liked about the place

Located near Alipore state bank, the place isn‚Äôt hard to locate. Just walk towards Chetla, & you‚Äôll find the building on the left, the same one which houses Chai Break. I can assure you, from outside you can‚Äôt make even a wild guess about what‚Äôs there inside for you! Sure the logo looks colourful & quirky, but the sliding door doesn‚Äôt give away much. But as soon you enter, it‚Äôs a completely different story. For a start you are welcomed by a passage decorated by some hundred nightbulbs, resembling the ones you might have seen in some rural fares. The place is a bit psychedelic ( if not normally, then after a couple of drinks for sure). Even before you overcome the hangover of the passage, you are greeted by a selfie booth with a insanely colourful scooter! Okay this place just forces you to take a selfie! If that wasn‚Äôt enough , the adjacent section actually has an auto-rickshaw (more selfies)! Okay I should stop talking about the selfies & concentrate on the ambience. The whole of the restaurant is themed after a retro-rural scene. The bar counter got a ‚Äòdaaru ka thek‚Äô makeover, while half of the main seating area has got charpai instead of couches! There‚Äôs row of high stooled seating with a wall full of old Bollywood posters & comics & dialogues & what not (I even found some print add about condoms )! The whole space is bursting with colours modelled after the rural Punjab (though this style of colourful vehicles etc are more predominant in Pakistan). Another section behind the retro theatre styled door has posters of Bollywood icons. This section has the auto-rickshaw (selfies again) & DJ consoles, & is available for private bookings. Another smaller section is there which has far more regular seating arrangement, which too is available for bookings.
Needless to say we all clicked loads & loads of pictures at every corner of the restaurant. Once the initial excitement settled down a bit we met the owner. The restaurant is only three weeks old & hasn‚Äôt yet got a permanent liquor license, though they serve alcohol on a temporary license.

Curious me dropped in Desi Lane on the very first week of its opening and I was clearly bowled out by the vibrant ambience.Located in plush Alipore, this themed den can be best described as a place that encourages one to unwind with good friends. This week I returned to celebrate my birthday with a whole bunch of pals, and my guests had a rolling time. The in-house Dj sure knows how to keep you on the dance floor. The selfie wall is to die for, and the food was just the perfect accompaniment. Having our slurp of tom kha gai or the lip-smacking Desi Lane special meatballs would be remembered for long. A space buzzing with desi vibes, the place surely created a whole new experience for us friends.  Thank you Desi Lane for making my birthday celebration an affair to cherish.

Desi lane is not just a restaurant. It‚Äôs a fun ride to an amazing journey. The place has been designed with an unique concept. The scene that one may expect while walking through a typical North Indian had been skilfully depicted here ! Not only that, there is much more to it. The entrance is given a retro touch, with colourful lights greeting your way. The use of lights creates an amazing background, such that people start clicking photos and selfies here even before the entering the main restaurant.

On a recent trip to Kolkata, a friend of mine took us along to this new restaurant "DESI LANE"..initially i was skeptical to have a get together in a untested restaurant..but the moment it stepped in my thoughts changed and i got carried away into the ambiance..Food was fantastic and economical..the staff were also very cooperative..music too was good..end to end a good place to enjoy and let yourself loose..seems like the place is calling me back with Sir Rabindranath Tagores famous patriotic song "Jodi Tor Dak Shune Keu Na Ase Tobe Ekla Cholo Re....... (calling me to comeback even alone to this place...)" ..Thanks for bringing this in such a beautiful city

This place was in my mind to for quite some time and finally when I decided to visit it was one good decision. The ambiance is superb and the place is amazing in so many ways. This place really took me on a nostalgic trip with its interiors. Food and Drinks: Well, this part was really amazing. Starters were a lovely affair. I started off with
with ‚ÄúShajani Murgh Bahar‚Äù and my veggie friend‚Äôs favorite ‚ÄúGolden Baby corn with Spinach Sauce‚Äù both was delicious! 
The main course was the next best thing to arrive on our table. 
Mutton Rara Ghost .. you should not miss this one , its best in the town . Mutton is soft to the core with one Kabli Naan . On the other hand my friend was moved with ‚Äú Benarashi Dum alu and ‚Äú Lacheder paratha..

Coming to the desserts, we ordered ‚ÄúMalpuya with Rabri . never tried this combination but definitely would have missed if not tried .

Service:The service here is superb. The staff is courteous and is always on their toes to assist you with everything. They serve with smile and I am definitely coming back here :)

Newly opened with Great ambience and DJ with dance floor. The food was also good except the prices. It came around 750-800 per person. However it's worth a visit.

Heard about this place from a Friend..decor of this place is really eye catchy..they have made full use of their "desi" theme..the coloured bulbs..scooter..wall memes give it an interesting touch..even the staff wore kurta pajama..hookah here is good..but they really need to work on their drinks and service..white sauce pasta was horrible..but the baby corn was really delicious..when we asked for the cheque a very polite gentlemen gave it to us in just 30 mins..just need to improve the service and food..
