Visited this restaurant in Esplanade today for lunch and we were quite disappointed. Firstly talking about the ambiance, the restaurant is quite old in decor carrying those typical oldage calcutta heritage. They still have the cabins in there dining space. The light is not proper and the I seriously doubt about the hygiene of the place. We thought apart from these drawbacks the food would not disappoint us but we were proven wrong again. Our order was only for the main course.
* Vegetable Biriyani With Panner
* Butter Nan
* Chicken Tikka Butter Masala
The food arrived in almost 10 minutes. Biriyani was horrible to taste. It had no aroma and flavour at all. Only under cooked vegetables served with rice that tasted too much bland. Butter Nan was soft and cooked nice but no sign of butter can be found in that as expected. Only item that was up to the mark was the gravy Chicken dish. 6 pieces of boneless Chicken in a thick semi spicy gravy was served in that dish. We finished our lunch quickly as there was an odd smell coming from which thing I didn't understand at all. I think they must clean the place properly because hygiene is not at all maintained here. Pocket pinch was quite high according to the foods and ambiance of the place. Not recommended at all. You can try several other places in Esplanade even the roadside stalls in Dacres Lane is a very good option rather than this so called famous restaurant. They also added some extra dishes in our bill which we didn't order. Poor service and management I must say. 👎

It's the Calcutta of the late 70s a young lad is drawn by a powerful music tune emanating from the Opera House at Lindsay street in esplanade. Unable to contain the urge he goes on to purchase a gramophone record of it from the symphony beside metro cinema in esplanade. This leads him to his usual repertoire the bylanes of metro gully where he finds Anarkali. The reason I am telling this story because this what you seek here. 4decades later this young lad's daughter visits the same Anarkali tucked in metro gully. While the Opera House and metro has lost the gully is rife with visitors and so is Anarkali. The daughter and her friend tries out the age old mutton Biriyani (which comes with an aloo, egg and 2pieces of mutton) and chicken tikka kebab. The parallel universe lies hidden in our taste buds. In some restricted pockets of the world time has stopped traveling. The decadent Anarkali is that constant in time.

It is one of the oldest restaurants in town. You can understand that once you step in because the decor highlights the Mughal Era. But don't let the decor and ambience confuse you because their food is the best. Their North Indian delicacies are to die for. Try out their chicken butter masala with butter naan. For desserts you can go for kulfi. It is extremely pocket friendly and the amount is generous.

This is a small restaurant located in Esplanade which will remind you of the old Kolkata where there were cabins in restaurants with curtains giving everyone their own little bubble to relish the food.
The food here is so awesome.
They serve delicious soft juicy mouthwatering kababs.
People should try the mutton biriyani here and also the mutton liver curry.
They will serve the food hot.
Nice nice behaviour of stuff.
Also really pocket friendly.

This restaurant is located beside the bi lane of Symphony music stores, esplanade. This lane is popularly known as "Metro Gully".
Anyway lets come to the point.
Today I have visited here with a friend and we ordered Chicken Tandoori, Mutton Masala with keema, Mutton Liver Masala with keema, tandoori rooti.
Food taste is avarage. But service is good and the staffs are well behaved. Moreover another pocket friendly restaurant in Kolkata. Make a visit here at least once.

I tried their chickn chilly fry which was basically a punjabi dish getting married to a chinese. Lip smacking.
They serve fresh tandoori rotis too.
For dessert i had their kulfi.. Not too sweet yet well balanced. 
They have family cabin type seating arrangements which is rare these days.

Nun was average; laccha paratha was fine, biriyani was too good,it had a superb flavour..but reshmi butter masala stealed the show, those juicy chicken pieces were just heaven nd we were charged just 355/- ; GST added. An awesome restaurent with good food, courtious staffs and decent ambience.will visit again for sure.

If you are at esplanade and willing to try good food at affordable price, a visit to ANARKALI wont be dissapointing. Located at METRO GALI, this place flaunts a retro look. There are cabins with old chairs and tables offering privacy to the customers. Food is average. Biriyani is good. Tandoori chicken was more or less ok (some portions of it was burnt).

This place is one of the oldest joints of Esplande situated at the Metro Gali.
If you are in Calcutta and looking for place which would offer great food and at the same time won't burn your pocket,this is the place.
Ambience is good.They have a bit old fashioned sitting arrangments with cabins,and old chair tables.
The place serves one of the best Biriyani. I love visiting this place for Biriyani.The Chicken/Mutton pieces are also good.
The Chicken dishes were good.

For starter we had ordered Chicken Reshmi Kebab.It was lip-smacking.There were 6 medium sized pieces of kebab which were super tasty.

For the main course we had ordered Chicken Biryani which had 2pieces of Chicken.The best part is pricing here is kept reasonable.

The staffs behaviour and service was really nice,as was the food.

Pocket pinch : 600 for two. Plus no taxes.

Those who haven't tried this place yet please do try.

My experience at this place was not quite good at all.Me and my friend went here few months ago after a shopping session at esplanade the restaurant was easy to locate and quite neat and clean.The staffs were helpful,we got our seat and ordered butter nun,sahee paneer and chicken dopyaza,none of them were even up to the mark, the chicken was overcooked, the sahee paneer didn't taste like sahee paneer and the nuns were extremely oily.The service was ok. But then when we asked for the bill they said the billing machine is not working properly so a computerized bill will not be available and gave us a handwritten bill of rs 500... Yes..can u imagine? And even they didn't have any ac or anything they charged 19.5% vat...yes you read that right.... We were so shocked but helpless too.We just paid the bill and went out and I don't think I would visit the restaurant ever again.

Tried Butter naan, aloo dum, Chicken butter masala & Bundi Raita. 

Butter naan was nicely made and was soft.
Aloo dum had thick tasty gravy and well cooked.
Chicken butter masala was very tasty, rich & flavourful.
Raita was nice too.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Food: I ordered non-veg dishes here as I heard a lot about them as legend.
1. Chicken Tikka Masala
2. Mutton Liver Masala 

Both of the dishes were superb and very authetic.

Tried both of them with butter nan. No doubt, that was the best combination..

Considering the cheap price I'll not give much of my talk to the ambience here.
People come here just to eat , plain as that.!!!

Service was good. The waiters were good mannered and well in uniform.

If you are hungry and looking for some heavy fooding without paining your pocket much.. This is another great place to go...

A vintage restaurant in Kolkata in the metro galli. Try the punjabi food items.The biryani and mughlai items in this place is average but the stand out dishes have to be chicken tandoori and the variety of naan the reataurant serves. I have tasted tandoori chicken in many places in India including Moti Mahal, Delhi which claims to be the inventor of the dish but personally I found this dish of Anarkali at par with the best. Perfectly spiced and full of flavours. The coolfi faluda is also pretty good here.

Very bad experience. Ordered egg fried rice, chicken fried rice and chicken resmi butter masala. It seemed like they prepared veg rice and mixed egg and chicken after that. Because there was no mixing of those. For butter masala also it tasted like the chicken kababs are mixed in gravy. Food was extremely oily. Only rating is for the old man who was serving. He was very polite and helpful and of good behavior. Not recommended.

It was one of my family friends who first introduced me to ‘Anarkali’ way back in 1998. Situated in a lane right next to the Iconic ‘Metro Cinema’ on Chowringhee Road, you can easily give it a miss if you are not a True fan. 

 The food joint is quiet old and caters to its patrons for decades. Try anything and everything and you won’t be disappointed. The numerous visits that I have made here since 1998 has left me asking for more and more. Their butter chicken and chicken do piazza along with their super soft butter naans are my favorite. Order anything and I can guarantee they won’t disappoint you

They have a bit old fashioned sitting arrangments with cabins,and cosy chair tables... The staffs are helpful and an ordinary decor to mention. 😃

We ordered chicken biriyani,butter roti and chicken tikka masala. And one kulfi for dessert . The food was served within 20minutes. 😄

So the biriyani had big pieces of chicken....it was perfectly cooked,tasty..a bit oily though. And few flavours were missing in the rice I think. 🤔 The quantity was satisfactory though. 👍

The butter roti tasted great with the smoking hot chicken tikka masala.The gravy was spicy abd creamy, with full of flavours... Yummy.. 😋

The kulfi was nothing extraordinary..It was good though.👍

A good place to enjoy a pocket friendly lunch. 😜 Though their quality and taste of foods has degraded a lot..but I have many old family memories here. So a 3..😀

The inside had a look of Old restaurant and is divided into small chambers which can accommodate 2 people.
The food was good. We too Mutton and Chicken Biryani having 2piece of Mutton and Chicken each. But the biryani has too much oil in it andI can say it was just satisfactory.
The Chicken dishes were good. The Tandoori Chicken was fantastic.
At the end we tried the curd and it was good too.

The restaurant has two sections - an ac section and a non-ac section and both the sections has cabins along with normal dining place.. We opted for the ac section... The ambience was very cosy and comfortable.. Neither too dim nor too light.. It was just perfect.. Now coming to food our order comprised of a starter and main course.. 
For starter we had ordered CHICKEN RESHMI KEBAB.. It was lip-smacking..  There were 6 medium sized pieces of kebab which were super tasty... Though i missed the mint dip... 
For the main course we had ordered CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA ans TANDOORI ROTI..  The chicken tikka masala has 5 medium sized tikka kebab in a rich and tasty butter masala gravy.. It was very tasty and went well with tandoori rotis..

The service was promt and pocket pinch was light.. :-)

The lighting wasn't strong but I could care less. Tried their Tandoori Chicken and Butter Masala. The Kebabs were juicy and soft. The gravy was perfectly spiced with no over splashing of the Masalas. The service was on the better side, atleast for me. The total bill wasn't too much which kind of impressed me.

Pocket friendly restaurant for decent quality North Indian food.
LOCATION: 'Metro gali' - narrow, congested,Street hawkers dominated lane beside metro cinema hall. Near to M M photography shop (famous among photographer)
AMBIENCE: Old place with wide sitting arrangement. Both AC and non AC sections are there. In non AC section you may have to share your table with unknown people. They also have cabin section for family. Still the ambience is not good,rather shabby.
SERVICE: Most of the staffs are experienced and prompt in their service. They want tips. Some young staffs are not apt in service.
FOOD: Traditional north Indian foods, tasty but much oily. No experiment with food. Chicken butter masala (2 leg pieces) mutton korma, keema mutton (oily) are good option with nun or kulcha. Biriyanis are average.
They also serve lassi and firni.

I went to anarkali after a decade.. Food is tasty.. It contains good amount of oil and spices to ignite your taste buds.. The century old etched glass with anarkali on the lap of salim is an added attraction.. It's good that such resturants have maintained their standards of good and bad...we ordered dal fry , keema mutter , roti and salad .. Food was served hot..quantity was enough for two grown up hungry men., The waiters are attentive .. The pinch on pocket was only rs 280/-., long live anarkali restaurant..

Went there at midnight...ordered a tandoori chicken,chicken tarka, chicken korma and roomali Rotis. Also had a glass of lassi.
The food was good...the kind of greasy food that simply invites you to dig in. The lassi was okayish...we wanted to have their much-raved about kulfi but it was over.
Nominal taxes if you sit in the ac section. Good service. They still have those old-fashioned cabins.
Nice for hunger pangs late at night.

Anarkali was my favorite destination in my college days. It's tasty and very pocket friendly too. 
Located at the metro gali this place is quite a popular one among the students in my days even family crowd used to be regular there. 

They make awesome Punjabi dishes ..
-> Chicken Tandoori
Chicken tikka masala 
Chicken butter masala 
Chaps and butter nans and rotis are the items to order and enjoy.

The sitting arrangements might be a little awkward as it's a little dim and shabby one . also the location is a bit clumsy one but it's really good. Dnt knw the present situation here but it will remain one of fav in the city :)

There was a time I used to go to this place with family for dinner or lunch whenever we we were in Esplanade area. This was my father's favorite restaurant in those days because Raj Kapoor used to eat here during his stay in Kolkata and my father is a big fan of him. Coming to the food, they used to serve great North Indian Dishes, especially Chicken Bharta, palak paneer, chicken reshmi butter Masala, tandoori, etc but on my recent visit I was hugely disappointed because quality of the food has degraded. Also I find it a bit unhygienic.

I used to visit this place with my father here or get takeaway from this place. Located beside the metro cinema lane it is not an ideal place to for family visits but if you love the old lanes and by lanes and want to rest your foot after some shopping this place can help you. 

I got it delivered this time via swiggy. I ordered reshmi tikka kebab which was hard and too charred for my taste. The masala kulcha was good and quite big in size. The chicken bharta has lost the old creamy texture. The chicken butter masala gravy was good but something needs to be done so that the chicken is soft.

Anarkali was my favorite restaurant during college days. Just near the Metro Station and pocket friendly. Every time I visited Esplanade those days, it was a must visit place. They served great north India food and Biryani was good too. And lastly, their Special Kulfi marked the dining complete.

Anarkali was my favorite destination in my college days. It's tasty and very pocket friendly too. 
Located at the metro gali this place is quite a popular one among the students in my days even family crowd used to be regular there. 

They make awesome Punjabi dishes ..
-> Chicken Tandoori
Chicken tikka masala 
Chicken butter masala 
Chaps and butter nans and rotis are the items to order and enjoy.

The sitting arrangements might be a little awkward as it's a little dim and shabby one . also the location is a bit clumsy one but it's really good. Dnt knw the present situation here but it will remain one of fav in the city :)

Visited this outlet with a couple of friends to have a quick bite.  This place is just beside metro cinema inside a narrow Lane. A moderately decorated place with AC as well as non AC sitting arrangement. We chose to go for the AC. There  were only about 4-5 tables inside with a sitting capacity for maybe around 25. The main thing that bugged me was that the place was very dimly lit. We ordered mutton biriyani, chicken fried rice, chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken bharta. I was surprised they do not serve any Chinese side dishes but they served Friedrice. So we had to team up Friedrice with Indian side dish. Biriyani was average, I have had much better quality in other restaurants. The chicken side dishes tasted good but could not find any difference between the two apart from only the names. Now the Friedrice which was supposed to be a Chinese dish but tasted somewhat a mixture of biriyani and Friedrice. The only pros I found is that this place is quite pocket friendly. It costed around 850 rupees for the 3of us. Overall a kind of average experience.  Probably not visiting again unless necessary.

This is one of the favourite restaurants of my dad. Been here a number of times when I was younger. Now though continental and Chinese food are my main focus, still this restaurant has a special place. It's good in its price range. Good to know that they don't compromise in quality and quality for their price range.

A good number of my friends are great photographers and like all good photographers, visiting Metro Gully is a must-do. Its the narrow lane just beside the Metro Cinema Hall (now closed) in esplanade area.

Now, the lane is full of street hawkers selling different items ranging from imported (mostly fraud) shoes to expensive (mostly original) cameras and lenses. Its this lane, which has got a strict grey-market feel attached to it and probably the reason why some people love to roam around there than in swanky malls.

Now coming down to the point, last time when we went, it was almost lunch time and we had to find out a place and we were fed up of CCD.

Just then, somebody suggested this place called Anarkali Restaurant. Its a shabby looking place, let me be quite honest, which is running for more than 50 years. And, here, please don;t get panicked if some unknown person suddenly comes and shares your table. Its the standard norms here- nothing to get hyper about.

Whatever, as we always do, rather than tasting my knowledge (which mostly betrays me), I asked the waiter “Dada, what can we have which is spicy and slightly dry ….. ” and he served us the 2 dishes, which still today I feel are the best that the joint could’ve offered. He offered me plain tandoori Roti, mutton keema matar and Chicken Fry chilly. Frankly, I was a little taken aback with the name. Chicken fry chilly ( I mean WTF). But then the dishes arrived. Like any good place, they offer hot rotis one by one. The keema Matar@ 115/- is a still and can easily be shared among 2 persons. And we ordered for the chicken fry chilly (half)@ 140/-, which the waiter told us would be enough for 3 persons, when combined with rest of the order. And, it was delicious. Fried succulent chicken pieces tossed in a brown gravy (spiced with tomato sauce and chilly sauce) and tampered with slit green chillies. Even as I am writing this, frankly, i am longing for this. We are not very sure how many rotis we had with this beauty- but we were bowled out- clearly.

 

Ok, being a bong, we were bound to end up with something sweet, and thus had the Kulfi-Falooda. Its good but frankly, after the chicken, nothing could really match.

So, all in all, definitely a recommendation  for the friends going to Metro Gully and the office crowd near that area. For the “sophisticated” guests, take-away might be a better option.

The naan and Tandoori roti is worth trying and Mix veg quality have literally gone down as it use to be 3-4 yrs ago but the butter chicken reshmi masala is worth try...and after a heavy meal its always good to end with an lassi or their special Kulfi!!!

Had lunch on 23-Aug-2015 with a friend. Roti, Veg Fried Rice (which they call Veg Biryani), Tikka Masala. This place is for those who can adjust themselves and are not very demanding. In bong vocabulary there is a word called 'cholbe',  it applies for this place. I won't mind going there again. Reasonably priced.

This place has gone through a great deal of reconstruction and renovation, but the hygiene standards still remain doubtful. For those who are ready to risk their gastronomic experiences  I would suggest the Tandoori Chicken, Shahi Korma and Masala kulcha would be a safer and tasty option. Never go for their Biriyani, as its very depressing! Otherwise Anarkali is a reasonable retreat for those who need to shop in Esplanade and are also on a budget.

Let's start with the early 80's when 'anarkali' and 'Lahore' ( s. N. Banerjee road...now it's gone) were under the same management. The food tasted heavenly... Now those cooks are gone... Blown away by the winds of time/ change... However I enjoyed their Bhindi Piaz and Tandoori Roti with Supriyo da I tow... It used to be a bustling place with the glory days of the Metro Cinema. Now shrouded and clised off ...Esplanade turned into a graveyard like somnolence, Anarkali is not what it used to be. Still I visit ....for nostalgia's sake!

Anarkali amazed me. I went there one summer evening. The moment I stepped in,it felt as if I have entered a world away from the busy one we are used to. The ambience exudes the flavour of a bygone world -quaint and slow in mood and movement. The lights were dim and yet the place was not dark. From where we sat,I could see a mirror with the engraving of a Mughal woman with a rose. It was beautiful. People are very hospitable here as fits the Nawabi mizaj. They are cordial and well-mannered. We ordered Chicken Kashmiri and Masala Kulcha, To say the food was delicious would be praising it less.The Biriyani was a little dry,but then again we prefer our Biryani rich in spices,so it is a personal choice. And finally,arrived the dish that stole our heart/stomach!!! It was the Faluda Kulfi.It was so good that the two of us ordered 3 Kulfis!An out of the world ending to a foodgasmic journey.

Umm. 
There was this day of casual shopping at esplanade and my friend was like "let's take you to a new place."
I said "Where ?"
She first walked past the place, came back, strut into a narrow lane and there was this kinda small joint. 
I entered following her, she said "Don't talk about ambience, it's cheap dude!" 
We sat in a cabin. Ordered conventional dishes. Chicken Biriyani. It was like Rs 80 then! Where do you get?
Mutton Kasha. And Tandoori rooti. Can't remember how fast or slow they served. 
But was indeed pleased to see they serve biriyani with egg! Weakness. 
It was less oily, delectably spiced-up. 
The mutton was tender. Rooti okayish. 
The amount added up so low that I can't recall! 
When there are days, you be like 'Gotta have some biriyani, but I'm poor right now', this is the place to seek for. XD

Biriyani tastes average.. Kulchas are somewhat better.. Veg items are OK.. Among non vegs, the main courses are very spicy.... Kebabs and tandooris r good.. What u ll like is their special kulfi.. Ambience is below average.. Service is slow.. It has two sitting accommodations... Both AC and non-AC.. If u ve a low budget ... Visit it.. It ll never disappoint u..

When it comes to Esplanade, it's about the retro feel, specially to the restaurants. Anarkali Restaurant is one such example with the vintage looking ambiance with both with or without AC. The cabin system of dining reminds me of the old days when couples or family used to opt for privacy. The food offered here is decent enough to me for the reasonable prices. And one must not consider too much before heading out to Esplanade or a place like this cause it a whole different experience.

I have been visiting Anarkali with my Dad since childhood. It is located in metro gali in Esplanade. We used to visit because it is the only place which stays open till 1 a.m and quite strangely you can order anything that is available  on the menu. They dont go out of stock unlike other restaurants. The price is also very reasonable. I visited Anarkali after a long time with my family. I stopped visiting there since my Father passed away. It was wonderful to re visit the place. It was 11:30 p.m and all the decent restaurants were shut down and my Mom suggested only Anarkali would be open. We went and ordered the Chilli mutton fry, Chicken tikka masala and vegetable navratan korma with butter naan. Must say the food was wonderful. I wasnt that hungry still I had 3 naans. It was so good. The waiter was so courteous and gave us such special care. We had coolfi at the end which was also very very tasty. I recommend this place for people who love food and if you are back from a late night party then you can always depend on this place. ONly thing I will visit this place only late night because parking is a very big problem there in normal time.

Located in the Esplanade Metro gali , this place is good place to try decent Punjabi food . The CHICKEN TIKKA BUTTER MASALA goes well with CHICKEN BIRYANI. The veg items are pretty good.  The ambience is not upto mark and the service is slow . Anyways if you are roaming hungry in Dharmatala and pocket is pinching , give this place a try.

Located in the midst of the shbby and crowded Metro gali Anarkali is a food joint for the janta crowd nowadays. We used to be regulars here during the eighties when i was just a kid and it was the excellent quality of the food that made us visit this place once in a while. The chicken bharta is till served with boiled egg sliced into two pieces and it has a different taste altogether. The tandoori roti is a must try and so is the naan. The tandoori dishes are excellent and has manitained the consistency even to this day. The only problem with this place is its location because of which it misses on customers who would put hygiene and cleanliness as priority. You can blindly order anything here and you are surely to love each and every dish. The kababs are succulent and melts in your mouth. The chicken and mutton biryani has an aroma of its own here and it is way better than the famous biryani joints available these days in Kolkata. An awesome place for some authentic mughlai and north indian food,

Okay this is now my regular place. No a pretty decent restaurant in the whole situated centrally near Dharmotolla.
Going to the place one might Not Find the ambience in line with the rating I've given but once you go to the AC section things get way better. Generally crowded the AC section is quite comfortable but sometimes can get noisy.
Now the food here is just too good i would say. A bit spicy but done to perfection. All the chicken dishes are really worth both, quality and quantity wise. The Chicken served is just so soft and juicy that it becomes one if the reasons one might want to visit again.
Do not forget to order Biryani. Spicy, soft and juicy.
Overall the place is great to catch up with some friends specially when on a tight budget.

One of the oldest restaurants of esplanade which still serves quality food over the years. I had lunch here twice and the food was tasty.

Anarkali......!!!!!!!! The name that used to come in Saleem's mind and heart since the moment he must have seen her. Same goes for this Restaurant, which serves the best and the authentic Punjabi and North Indian cuisines that will tickle your taste buds. And I believe that once u just browse the restaurant, it will be difficult for you to resist yourself to visit it again and again. 

The selection of appetizers is amazing, as is the main menu. Its very tough to resist to peep into the various other dishes from the menu headed to other tables; they smelled wonderful, looked fantastic, and were soon emptied, just like the one of mine, every time.

I would recommend the foodies of Kolkata and the food loving citizens, who visit "The city of Joy" to drop by this place and I am sure that this restaurant will meet your expectations with the food and the service by it's courteous and humble staffs. 

And once you are done, the same name will come in your heart and mind whenever you want to browse and explore the finger-licking cuisine!!!!!!!........ Anarkali

Many restaurants claim to serve authentic north Indian food without even knowing the basics of north Indian cuisine.
But at Anarkali one can actually experience the real taste of North Indian Cuisine.
Excellent food
Courteous staff

Now this is called Food ! Located just foot steps from Esplanade crossing and metro station Anarkali proudly caters to all the food lovers in the towm speacial aunthentic Punjabi dishes. The menu itself stipulates the variety of dishes which are served in different ambiences from free sitting open areas to air-conditioned cabins. 
Starters, Dal and not to forget the brain masala is a must. Service is prompt, food and piping hot and prices no comparision with other Punjabi restaurants. It is anyday better than Jai Hind, Azad Hind etc. Not only this, its been decades this restaurant is in business since 1950's and has recently been given a new look.
It is highly recommended to all Kolkatans and can get delivered too. 
Lastly I would say try once, Anarkali wont let you down, I bet

Very tiny out of focus joint as other reviewers suggested. Apparently mot at all impressive, but, when it comes to brain pakoda or brain curry (with mutton brain), they do magic. The brain curry is a show stopper.

This one-off eatery , located close to the Esplanade and often referred to as "Anarkali-Metro Gali" is worth visiting only for its food , which is not only well-made but  lip-smacking too!. It was one of the much liked restaurants offering Punjabi , Dhaba-Style cuisine quite similar to the one served at The Lahore Restaurant off  S.N Banerjee Rd, close to the  Elite Cinema! In fact as a teenager & even till my mid-twenties I made it a point to eat their Chicken Chap & Tandori Roti if I happened to pass by  during Lunch hours!Those days neither  I nor most of the Kolkata people  were much bothered about hygiene & ambience & I have always found people waiting for their turn to take a seat!

Like most  Punjabi-joints , they do try to maintain the minimum basic cleanliness & hygiene. I must say that as an youngster a lot of good memories are attached with this place as most of our friends , specially after seeing the Sunday Morning Movie-show , would end up having a meal which was quite affordable as well as very enjoyable too!

The only reason why this restaurant is not as popular as it probably should be is the location.It is located in one of the many over crowded shabby alleys of esplanade.
I have been to this place a couple of times,the last time was about a year back.So I dont exactly know if it has improved or deteriorated.The place serves North Indian food only.The last time I had visited the quality of the food was quite good.The prices are affordable.
The ambience is not great.The ac section inside is still okay.This is why I think this place can not be recommended to family dinners.
If you are a group of friends passing by Esplanade and you love your Biryani and you want to try some place new then this place is worth a try.
The food is worth 4/5.
The location,ambience,cleanliness,service etc are 2/5.
