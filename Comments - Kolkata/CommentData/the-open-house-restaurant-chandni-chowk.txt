Finally there's a good restaurant at chadni. This place is exactly opposite of the abp office.  The decor is of wooden finish. I tried a few Veg items which were very good in taste.  The quantity and price ratio is also perfect. The Veg Tandoori platter was very good. I love the cream of broccoli soup.  The stuffed jacket potatoes prepared in the Italian way was also tasty.  The hostess was very warm in attending to us about our experience at her restaurant.  The staff was courteous but requires a bit more training. A must visit place.

This is a newly opened restaurant near Chandni Chowk metro station. I visited the place today with my friends and the place did not disappoint me for sure. We had crunchy fish for the starter, garlic naan, plain naan, vegetable pulao, patiyala chicken and butter chicken as our main course. The crunchy fish was great. And what can I say about the tartar sauce that they served with the fish! It tasted heavenly. Also everyone should definitely try out their patiyala chicken. It's really different and will make your taste buds oh-so happy. The naans were very soft and tasted real good unlike some places where the bread gets really hard and is difficult to swallow. Now people may wonder why with such great food I have not rated this place higher! It is the pulao and the butter chicken which should be blamed for this. I had the pulao and the butter chicken at the very end and the taste really did not linger much. I am more of a rice person than bread, so my opinion was really affected by it. The problem with the chicken was that maybe the spices did not get inside the pieces. But saying that, I must mention the staffs who were really nice. They definitely deserve special mention!

The Open House Restaurant is a newly opened Restaurant in Chandni Chowk area near E-Mall. Earlier this place doesn’t have any good restaurant except Sabir, but the ambiance of Sabir’s is not that good and food options are also limited but now The Open House Restaurant surely fulfil our all our need related to food and ambiance. The place is big enough to serve 40-45 people at a time and cozy seating arrangements makes the place perfect to hangout with friends and family. The interior decoration is eye catching and there are large windows on one side through which natural light is coming and make a relaxing, enjoyable atmosphere. The place offers delicious Continental, Italian and North Indian dishes. Open House restaurant celebrates Durga Puja by offering their patrons an array of classic dishes. A preview to this delectable and mouth-watering cuisine was presented to the team of Panchphoron when we visited the place for Durga Puja Special Menu launch event. Started with,

Cheese Roti: Flat bread cut into triangle shape and topped with a mixture of fresh cottage cheese, smashed potato, different spices, crisp and ketchup. Taste good.

   

Parsley Potato: Boiled potato tossed with different spices and parsley. Less oily less spicy yet delicious. Served with cherry tomato, parsley and chopped carrot. 

Chicken Banjara: Medium size boneless chicken pieces marinated with yogurt and tandoori masala, and other ingredients and grilles perfectly inside tandoor. Served with chopped onions and coriander chutney. Chicken was very soft and juicy, try it with coriander dip for taste boostup. Mouth-watering Preparation.

Mediterranean Kebabs: Another mouth-watering preparation. Marinated chicken pieces with bell peppers, mushroom, onions and cherry tomatoes were put in skewers and grilled perfectly. The garnishing was also very nice. Served with Dill leaves.

Fish Finger: Very famous starter option. Fresh vetki fillet marinated with spices and dipped into batter and fried deeply into oil. Outside was very crispy and from inside it was soft and juicy. 

Galoti Kebabs : This one is a famous awadhi kebabs. Galoti Kebabs are made of minced mutton.  This kebab was served with small Laccha Paratha with green Salad.  The Galoti kebabs were delicately and fondly cooked using papaya as tenderizing agent which makes it softer than butter and tender as snow.  It will melt in your mouth in no time. A must try.

Harabhara Kebab: A perfect mouth-watering veg kebab preparation. The garnishing was amazing.  

Crispy Chicken Fry- A fried chicken preparation. Very crispy. 

Open House Special Platter – A special platter from Open House. The decoration of the platter was very eye cathching and taste wise it was amazing.

Grilled fish with Assorted Vegetables- Chunk of fish grilled perfectly and served with veggies. A special sauce used as a taste boost up.

Chicken Chaap - Well this preparation dont need any introduction. It was very spicy and oily and superbly delicious.

Mutton Biryani – Kolkata style mutton biryani. Just amazing in taste. One of best in Kolkata I can say. If  you are a biryani lover must visit the place. 

Paneer Chaap – The chunk of panner was cooked perfectly with a rich creamy tomato gravy. Onion paste was also used in the gravy. A spicy veg peparation. Just try it.

Dal Makhni – Very delicious perfect gravy item to try with naan or lacha. Loaded with butter and a rich flavour. 

The place is amazing and atmosphere is perfect for hangingout with friends and family  and enjoying the fingerlicking food they have to offer. Make sure visit the place during puja. Good Food Feel Good. Happy Puja everyone.

Chandni Chowk was lacking a good restaurant where you can get some really awesome food at a very affordable price. But, now there is a place in this area where you can find some delicious foods. The open House restaurant is a newly opened restaurant and from the very first day they attracted the people of kolkata by their quality of the food and great hospitality. This is also a nicely decorated place with ample amount of seating arrangements. Ambiance was nice and cosy and the dishes were wonderfully decorated.                                                 As we all know that Durga Puja is coming and for those festive days The Open House is launching their puja special menu and invited TeamPanchPhoron for this event. We were really blown away by the quality and the quantity of the food they served and the huge array of dishes are as follows : Cheese Rosti, Parsley Potato, Chicken Banjara, Mediterranean Kebab, Fish Fingers, Mutton Galauti Kebab, Harabhara Kebab, Crispy Chicken Fry, Open House Special Platter, Grilled fish with Assorted Vegetables, Chicken Chaap, Veg Kofta in Red Gravy, Mutton Biryani, Paneer Chaap and Daal Makhni

I knew that I was going to have a good experience when I saw the invitation from The Open House , to come and savour their latest Durga Puja menu but it turned out to be an even better experience than my expectations. The place has definitely made a name for itself with its consistent quality and taste of food that has made the entire experience of eating out Indian and continental cuisine more approachable, fun, laid back, quirky and energetic. This newly opend food joint located near Chandni Chowk Metro Station. The interiors are mostly in hues of yellow complemented by wooden tones. There are large windows on one side that throw in beautiful natural light. They have a comfortable seating with a mix of plush couches and chairs around square tables. The interiors exude an old world charm with an eclectic mix of lights. A look at the menu conveyed that the place offers a combination of snacks and meal items and is perfect  for a quick bite as well as a long conversation with family or friends. I have been here with Team Panchphoron to attend their Durga Puja food menu launch.

Ambience is brilliant . Hospitality is also great. Food is also very good. Location wise it's easily accessible . Preferably have a driver for ease of parking. Excellent people and service . All food items were very tasty. Biryani essence can be more controlled.

Chandni Chowk was lacking a good restaurant where you can get some really awesome food at a very affordable price. But, now there is a place in this area where you can find some delicious foods. The open House restaurant is a newly opened restaurant and from the very first day they attracted the people of kolkata by their quality of the food and great hospitality. This is also a nicely decorated place with ample amount of seating arrangements. Ambiance was nice and cosy and the dishes were wonderfully decorated.                                                 As we all know that Durga Puja is coming and for those festive days The Open House is launching their puja special menu and invited TeamPanchPhoron for this event. We were really blown away by the quality and the quantity of the food they served and the huge array of dishes are as follows : Cheese Rosti, Parsley Potato, Chicken Banjara, Mediterranean Kebab, Fish Fingers, Mutton Galauti Kebab, Harabhara Kebab, Crispy Chicken Fry, Open House Special Platter, Grilled fish with Assorted Vegetables, Chicken Chaap, Veg Kofta in Red Gravy, Mutton Biryani, Paneer Chaap and Daal Makhni

I knew that I was going to have a good experience when I saw the invitation from The Open House , to come and savour their latest Durga Puja menu but it turned out to be an even better experience than my expectations. The place has definitely made a name for itself with its consistent quality and taste of food that has made the entire experience of eating out Indian and continental cuisine more approachable, fun, laid back, quirky and energetic. This newly opend food joint located near Chandni Chowk Metro Station. The interiors are mostly in hues of yellow complemented by wooden tones. There are large windows on one side that throw in beautiful natural light. They have a comfortable seating with a mix of plush couches and chairs around square tables. The interiors exude an old world charm with an eclectic mix of lights. A look at the menu conveyed that the place offers a combination of snacks and meal items and is perfect  for a quick bite as well as a long conversation with family or friends. I have been here with Team Panchphoron to attend their Durga Puja food menu launch.

Chandni Chowk...the most busiest place for office goers in Kolkata. And moreover there is no such restaurant over there where you can chill over with family or friends or for even office party.
Now the wait is over. The Open House is such a place where you can sit and relax after your hectic office hours.
This newly joint is situated just beside the lane of Chung Wah. Open house is spacious with an arena of soothingness in it. The owners are very friendly and they take care of everything. They will make you feel like home.
Team Panchphoron was invited for their newly launched menus which was quite innovative and interesting. We were greeted with mocktails which was such a saviour in this humid weather. Starting from the starters till desserts I found most of the preparations just amazing. Even they had the house specialities on every day menus.

STARTERS-
● CHEESE ROSTI - Pita bread with cheese stuffed in it. The breads was served with sauce on top of it. Very crispy and guey from inside.
● PARSLEY POTATOES- Boiled potatoes cooked slow with various spices and parsley. Served with lollo rosso lettuce, tomatoes. Perfect for my health concious friends 😊
● HARA BHARA KEBAB- Veg kebab with various vegetables like green peas in it. The kebab was excellent. Served with green sauce and salads.
● MEDITERRANEAN KEBAB- Perfect blend of meat and spice. The kebab will just melt in your mouth. So delicious. Perfect non veg starter. Loved it.
● CHICKEN BANJARA- Succlucent juicy pieces of chicken served with sauce and veggies. The chicken was neither too spicy nor bland. It was just perfect.
● CRISPY CHICKEN FRY- Again another innovative dish. Fried chicken served in Pizza style with sauce and veggies. The chicken was really tasty. Soft and juicy.
● FISH FINGERS- Fish fingers were just awesome. The fish was really fresh. And it was crispy as well. Served with sauce and.
● OPEN HOUSE SPECIAL PLATTER- It was really good. Total mixture of veggies with meat. Small pita breads with paneer and chicken on top of it. The presentation was excellent. The pita breads are soft and the toppings added the punch in it. Recommended

MAINS-
● DAAL MAKHANI- Daal boiled and mashed then cooked with masala. The daal is thick in consistency. Had cream in it. Goes great with tandoor items like roti or nun.
● VEGETABLE KOFTA IN RED GRAVY- Kofta stuffed with various vegetables such as carrots, beans, babycorn etc with cream. The gravy was really thick. Perfect blend of red powder, nuts in it.
● PANEER CHAAP- Their most Innvative dish. Never ate such dish before. Soft large pieces of paneer cooked in spices like ginger, garlic and cumin seeds. Semi dry. The paneer and the gravy were lip smacking. Served with kulcha bread which was very tasty as well. Highly recommended. 👌
● CHICKEN CHAAP- Large chunky pieces of chicken cooked in red gravy. It was so rich and creamy. The chicken were fresh and succlucent. Goes well with Nun or rice as well.
● GRILLED FISH WITH ASSORTED VEGETABLES- Fish marinated with various spices grilled with perfection amd served with sauted vegetables. The fish was awesome and the combination of veggies made it perfect. Must try.
● MUTTON BIRIYANI- Ahhaa.. One of the best biriyanis I tried out till date. The mutton pieces were heavenly. It was so soft. Long grain rice was just too good. Had that magical aroma in it. Not too oily. Brings a smile to your face. Excellent.

DESSERTS-
● CHOCOLATE TART- Chocolate mousse with choco chip and grated chocolate on top of it. The tart is fresh and cruncy. Great for ending up your palette.

Loved each and every dishes. Will highly recommend their popular Paneer Chaap and Mutton Biriyani. Pocket friendly restaurant in the prime location of City's heart. Cost for 2 will be approx 600-700 bucks. Must Visit. Till then Happy Eating ☺

And lastly... I am a proud member of Team Panchphoron.

I have to rather confess that this place outshone my expectations. Being a food obsessed guy, I only go to the best outlets in town and this I suggest is surely among one of them. 

The warm comforting ambience matches with the cosy decor and the whole dining area is theatrical. The fabulously good food adds to it to give a very pleasant experience. 

You must try their veg/non veg platter as starters, their kebabs(especially the non veg) and the various Indian options. 

One of the must try outlets in Kolkata for sure!!!!

Open House was on my wishlist for sometime. Heard from few of my friends about this new restaurant. Visited the place on a weekday for a dinner with family & was quiet surprised to see that the place was almost full. I would say Open House is the only family restaurant in the area apart from a couple of old & established ones. Open House is a hidden gem since it has all the ingredients required to establish a name for itself, be it food , service , pocket friendliness or cleanliness. Looking forward to visit again. Keep it up guys 👍

Food is their USP. A place focused on some good exotic dishes - at quite a reasonable price I must say. What I really liked was their Galouti Kababs, Chicken Tikka which truly does melt in the mouth. For main course - I recommend their biryani and chaap. 

Ambience is pretty cool - its between fine dining and casual. So I would go there for an informal or semi-formal meal. 

Parking in the area can be a pain but they were helpful and offered valet on request. That I feel is a true bonus.
