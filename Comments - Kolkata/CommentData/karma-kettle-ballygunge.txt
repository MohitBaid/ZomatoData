Tagore said ‚ÄúCome oh come ye tea-thirsty restless ones -- the kettle boils, bubbles and sings, musically.‚Äù

Karma Kettle is tea lovers‚Äô paradise is located inside The Ivy House at the Swinhoe Street, Ballygunge. This quaint store located inside The Ivy House reminded me of the beautiful sketches in Oxford Reading Circle English lessons . The wooden doors and windows and the logo caught my attention and I realised simplicity is the beauty our soul craves for . Karma Kettle serves various kind of tea from the classic varieties of Darjeeling Tea, to unique blends like chamomile with jasmine or Oolong Tea with Orange Peels, to the Masala chai .This winter Karma Kettle can be the best place for you,I have mostly coffee lover friends but my family is a total tea lover one so if not friends you can visit this place with family.

First of all I would like to mention the high tea platters they serve 

Gora Saheb and Bura Saheb.

¬†The names sound so‚Ä¶.so Bangaali !!!!!! The vegetarian Burra Saheb High Tea is served with Bengali tit-bits, and the Gora Saheb High Tea with delicate English treats. Burra Saheb i) Vegetarian Pokoras ‚Äì 8 Pcs ii) Petite Savoury Bites (Cocktail Samosas or Corn and Cheese Tikki or Mini Hara Bhara Kebabs) ‚Äì 4 Pcs iii) Fresh Sandesh ‚Äì 4 Pcs iv) Indian Sweets ‚Äì 2 Pcs v)  Premium Loose Leaf Tea from Karma Kettle  

Gora Saheb ‚Äì 

i) Finger Sandwiches ( Ham and Cheese or Cucumber and Homemade Cheese) ‚Äì 4 Pcs ii ) Sweet Treats ‚Äì 2 Pcs iii) Coconut Macaroons ‚Äì 2 Pcs iv) Chicken or Vegetarian Quiche ‚Äì 1 Pc v) Chocolate Brownie vi) Premium Loose Leaf Tea by Karma Kettle

The High Tea platters serve tea which is sufficient for two .Each and every delicasy these platters serve tastes authentic .The fries and sweets in bura saheb will remind you of authentic Bangaalir Cha er Adda . And Gora Saheb comes with absolutely lovely english treats and momos that can beat tibetian restaurants for sure .You get Premium Loose Leaf Variants to choose from their menu for your choice of tea to accompany the above mentioned platters .

Being a tea lover I would recomment the variant Matcha mandarin (gentle qyality of green tea, matcha powder & mandarin orange peel) This is japaneese tea with orange peel extracts .We have heard a lot about the use of matcha in beauty products .I knew very little about matcha so far ,this variant contains mandarin orange peel extract thus this is the best one you should try during this season .

Great wall (lonzing tea from china, pandam leaves, marsh mellow, sour cherries & melon): Great Wall is another amazing variant to try .It tastes absolutely amazing and mash mellow‚Äôs sweetness and melon‚Äôs sweet plus tangy fruity flavour blended with lonzing tea and pandam leaves will impress tea lovers . Great Wall is a premium blend that perfectly marries Longjing tea to pandan leaves, lemongrass, sour cherries, melon seeds, musk melon & lychee rendering a luscious succulent finish to the cup.

Canton (oolong tea, hand made): Canton is a black tea originating from the Himalayas. Tea leaves are dried or smoked over slow burning pine wood rendering a unique smoky flavor and long finish. Lapsang Souchang has many health benefits most notably it‚Äôs high antioxidant count which prevents heart disease and cancer.

Canton will actually take you to mainland china. Hot Steamed Momos with Canton will definetly make world a better place .That‚Äôs what it turned out to be we were served hot momo‚Äôs that will beat any chinese and tibetian restaurants.

If you are looking for iced-tea they serve some amazing flavours 

The lovliest variants in iced tea you can try includes 

Tahiti (no tea leaves, dry strawberries, cocscum flower  & hibiscus flower)

This Variant of Iced Tea tastes amazing I heard about hibiscus tea but I had no idea about how cockscum flower (Morog phool) can be used in a beverage .If you are looking for a no-caffeine variant choose this ,they call this ‚ÄòTea‚Äô because of the energy factor ,Tahiti contains no Tea leaves . It brews to a striking pink-ruby cup and is loaded with jammy flavours making it the perfect companion for warm sunny days!

Pinacolada ( tea leaves, pinapple, coconut, passion fruit blended with darjeeling tea )

‚ÄòPinacolada ‚Äò is common name we find in cocktails and mocktails and passion fruit and darjeeling tea works as a twister .Cocunut contributes a lot to the required sweetness while passion fruit ,and darjeeling tea maintains a perfect equilibrium when it comes to tangy and flavour in the beverage . This black tea brew is a sultry taste explosion of pineapple, tropical fruit and coconut.

Aam salam (dehydrated mangoes, pinch of chaat masala & sugar to taste)

For a all ‚Äòseason tea person‚Äô like me this variant is going to my excuse to visit Karma Kettle Tea Room this Summer .Honsetly, I loved Aam Salam. The taste is something you can relate to Aam Panna . This flavor profile continues in the tasting notes too- juicy mangoes with a hint of raw mango and cumin add a tantalizing sharpness to this refreshing iced tea that will tease your taste buds.

Karma Kettle is a fabulous thing that has happened to Kolkata. I had my brand's launch at Karma Kettle last November and everyone went home completely mesmerised with the place. Its difficult to find a place so charming and so serene.¬†
Ambience: The setup is gorgeously done. Its quaint and has an European feel to it. You might consider that very common with the number of cafes opening in the city, but what makes it so wonderful is the greenery surrounding it. You have to be there to quite understand what I am saying.
Food: For the launch, I had two iced-teas and one Istanbul. We loved all three. We had ordered some 10-12 plates of their High Tea set, the Gora Saheb High Tea st and the Burra Saheb High Tea set. The food was more than enough for everyone and the variety included helped us have something for everyone.¬†
Staff: The best part of Karma Kettle, hands down. The owner and the staff are so so welcoming. Its rather refreshing. Laltu da spoils me with his infamous tea concoctions. He makes the effort to understand his customers before serving them. We have met just 3-4 times, yet he knows exactly how i like my tea. That's Laltu da for you.¬†

Must tries: Paan tea, Paan pakora, chicken quiche, Istanbul

You HAVE to go there at least once. Just go and have good tea, read a book and laze. You wouldn't feel like you are in Kolkata. Not kidding!

A quaint little tearoom located at Ballygunge, is definitely your to-go place this winter if you love Tea of all sorts. There is an endless list flavoured teas for you to choose from and be content. I visited Karma Kettle this morning and loved the way the place has been glammed up for Christmas. I ordered for a pot of Istanbul - a beautiful concoction of Green Tea, Berries and Hibiscus. The pot serves two big cups and the flavors in it were extremely fulfilling and nice. We had some Corn and Mushroom Tartlets to give us company and they were quite good as well. Its very near to my place and hence I intend to frequent this place whenever I am in need of some refreshing cup of Tea.

Karma Kettle located at Ballygunge is a place for Tea lovers. Tea is something very close to each one of us and it is an integral part of our daily lifestyle. Without Tea i don't think i can imagine to get shaken up easily so Tea is essential for me and i am sure it is the same for you all too. Recently i was invited here by First Idea Pr to check this place out and on coming here i was amazed with this property that looked so well decored. Coming here for the first time i never thought a Tea Room could have such a beautiful and mood lifting atmosphere. But i was completely in love with the set up that this place has in wooden,and glass structures around in an outdoor kind of seating arrangement. The whole area was blossomed with greenery and freshness. In spite of it being an outdoor seating the whole temperature is kept cool thanks to the air conditioning which is trapped with the enclosure around. Don't worry about the heat just enjoy the sunrays and some natural vitamins gifted from above especially as winter is setting in slowly.
Now coming to the specialties that Karma Kettle has in store for you is starting with some exotic Tea selections from around the Globe which means the Tea which can help you overcome health issues like stress,bp, etc and to give you a boost to your lifestyle is available here,so you can just enjoy the blended teas or the non blended one's and you will benefit a better living then after surely. To start of there are Ice Tea choices you can pick from Pinnacolada,Passionately & Sebuckthorn . The first one is made with pineapple juice along with coconut milk and multiple blended Tea combination. The second one was blended fruit juice Tea along with mango flavour it. The last one had Sebuckthorn Black blend tea along with chat masala. Three of them had  their own character but for me the Pinnacolada was the best. Now after the Ice tea,let me mention that they have introduced two High Tea Menu choices available from 3pm to 6:30pm at a cost of INR 450/- plus taxes for 2 persons. The first one is the GORA SAHEB HIGH TEA that includes an English selection of eats starting with Assorted Finger Sandwiches 4 pcs ( Ham & cheese / Cucumber & homemade cheese )¬†moving to the Lemon Meringue Pie / Apple Tart 2 pcs,Coconut Macaroons 2 pcs and the last one Chicken Quiche / Vegetarian Quiche 1 pc all served in a multiple food holding tray along with 1 Pot of Karma Kettle's Premium loose leaf teas. This is really very nice and the whole combination of sipping tea with food in such an ambiance is spectacular. 

Now the second choice is the BURRA SAHEB HIGH TEA that reflects an Indian version high tea starting from Vegetarian Pokoras 8 pcs,Petit Savoury bites from India 4 pcs (Mini hara bhara kebabs / Corn & Cheese Tikki / Cocktail Samosas),Assorted Fresh Sandesh 4 pcs and
Decadent Indian Sweets 2 pcs,again served along with a Pot of Karma Kettle's Premium loose leaf teas.This set of High tea was impressive too and it is actually difficult to compare the two among each other so the whole thing is that if you are fond of having High Tea the English way then go for the first and if not then the second one is always available as an option. For me both of these High tea menu were at it's best . And just incase you want options in the flavour blend of your Tea pot then worry not as you can pick from Nightingale Tea¬†,Bird Song Tea,Gulmarg Tea or the Paan chai. All of these look very colourful and attractive . My personal favourite would be the Bird Song Tea for it's uniqueness and lovely blend taste.

So visit Karma Kettle to enjoy over a pot of tea not just a cup,as places like this are special that helps you add an interesting tale to share with others.

This I daresay with utmost reassurance that Karma Kettle is the perfect place to go this winters! This elite tearoom is the perfect quaint corner you are looking for. This is one of my favourite places in the city.
They have an amazing outdoor seating which oozes charm and aesthetics in every corner. 

They have recently introduced an amazing High Tea Menu which I was invited to sample. Would like to thank Priti and the entire team of Karma Kettle for the amazing hospitality.

The high tea menu comprises of mainly two segments : Gora Sahib High Tea & Burra Sahib High Tea. Fancy isn't it?

 Gora Sahib High Tea is basically the English High Tea comprising of finger sandwiches, macarons, quiche, apple pie and tart. This one is delectable and delicious. The finger sandwiches are so good. The quiche is pretty decent but the coconut macarons totally covers up for it. It was amazing. The apple pie tart is also a favourite.

While the indian counterpart goes by the name of Burra Sahib High Tea which comprises of various fries and fritters, vada pav and sweets. I am not essentially a fan of desi sweets since I get to eat a lot of them at home, perks of being a bangali. However the fries and fritters are definitely on point. And with this lovely nip in the air, this is the perfect time to have some good blended or single estate tea with this platter!

Both of these are priced at INR 450/- plus taxes.

Apart from the scrumptious finger food, you will find various blends of tea that are served both hot and cold to enjoy at this lovely tearoom.  They have a sensory tea room stacked with beautiful range of blended teas that you can take home as well! 
My personal favourites are Maya, Shanti and Istanbul. Hope you guys will give this place a try!
I know I am definitely coming back real soon.

Karma Kettle, the cozy tea room at Ivy House is a perfect place for tea time adda. They have an interesting collection of teas from around the world. The place is quite inviting. Karma Kettle was on our bookmarks since the day it opened its doors. If you have been to Kasturi Food Plaza or Fish Fish, the Ivy House wouldn't be difficult for you to locate.

The Ivy House is really beautiful, far from the hustle and bustle of the Calcutta streets, this place has everything to soothe your body and mind. Orchids, vines, sunshine, greens and more greens. Moreover, it has beautiful rooms which you can book for a weekend getaway.

From the main entrance, we were escorted to the Karma kettle tea room which is located in a cozy corner of the property. The first look was beautiful! The tea room is made of wood and glass, the transparent roof lets lot of light in but the air conditioning makes sure you don't sweat. The seating, cutlery, framed tea trivia, floor and lighting has been nicely done. There is a small room which has tea samples, books, Karma Kettle merchandise and teas to take home. Loved the floor of this room and the lamps shaped like kettle and tea cups!

We ordered a pot of Nightingale tea. It's a white tea with blue pea flower and Jasmine extracts. Had a very mild taste of tea and Jasmine. The color was a lovely purplish blue! One pot has enough tea to fill 3-4 cups.

Servers were quite polite and service was quick. The way they brought the bill in a brightly painted can filled with teas was really sweet!

Go visit the place on a winter afternoon like we did, and you are bound to feel great. If you love the thought of sunshine on your tables, dry leaves falling softly on the glass roof, hot tea and everything photogenic, Karma kettle definitely wouldn't disappoint you.

Pocket pinch for us-
A pot of Nightingale- INR 180
GST- INR 9
TOTAL- INR 189
No service charges.

Such a cute and amazing little place. Oh how I wish it had rained today, would have enjoyed the ambience even better. 

A beautiful look.  Great iced tea.  And very good service.  
Such attention for detail with the door knobs look like knives and forks.  
The roof was see through, so when can just gaze away.  All wooden decor with a very neat tea parlour inside.  

Amazing!

Tea has always been a romantic link of numerous dispersed pleasant memories in my otherwise convoluted head. It‚Äôs that mystic potion which cures so many unseen anomalies in life. For me, the aroma of this magic potion has to excite my senses and maybe for that reason this floral range of teas from Karma Kettle left me spellbound. To be very true, I am not too much into floral teas, but I am certain that after this tasting session I have become an avid lover of this amazing range of teas. Most importantly, here at Karma Kettle the flavor infusion is all natural. There is no flavor added here which is artificial. The flavoring elements used for fruits, flowers or spices are all organic in nature, so that‚Äôs really good for your body. This amazing tearoom founded by the Aroras is located at 4, Swinhoe Street (Ballygunge Place) and it‚Äôs basically a cozy corner at the ground floor of their residential property. The place is still getting all decked up for a grand opening. And let me tell you that when this beautiful extension of Karma Kettle opens up it will be one of the coolest tearooms in town. It has a lovely vintage wooden finish to it with natural diffused sunlight coming in, which I absolutely loved.
                                          ...
