I have been to this place more than thrice. It's located on Bidhan Sarani near the Scottish Church Collegiate School . You get a roadside view through the large clear glass window panes . The place is overall okayish. I don't like the food that much. It's very basic in taste. I feel the quantity in case if certain food is not that good. They have to improve on their food.

Quality of food is awesome.. We ordered Chinese starters and main course items like chicken drum sticks, mixed noodles and chicken manchurian..
Cost is also pocket friendly and quantity is more than sufficient.. Ambience of the restaurant is perfect for dining.. Must visit the place once more :)

Located next stoppage from Hatibagan towards Hedua on the right hand side next to the pertol pump.
Both seating and takeaway deliveries options are available.
I have tried their Biryani, Chicken Bhuna and Chicken chap. It is good in taste but not the best. Biryani comes with huge quantity , 2 pieces of chickens , 1 potato and 1 egg. The taste needs to improve more.

An average Chinese food plaza. The only thing notable about Fusion is it's view which is really memorable. The food and service are both good. But one advice don't believe them when they say that one plate is sufficient for two, believe me it's not.

This place is very near to Hatibagan More just beside the petrol pump.After a tiresome puja shopping I searched for some place nearby to have lunch and Zomato gave a suggestion of this place.After going through the reviews I was a bit sceptical about trying this place but since no other place nearby had both Chinese and North Indian cuisine together I decided to give this a try.
The restaurant is on the first floor which you have to reach through a narrow staircase.The place is moderately sized with a seating capacity of around 35 people.The staff and the service was just okay.
Coming to the food,we ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn,Garlic naan,Butter chicken and tutti fruity.
The starter arrived very quickly.The dish was a bit on the saucy side and extra oily, however the taste was spicy enough and not sweet.
The main course then took around 40 mins to arrive,the butter chicken was definitely the worst I had.This gravy was no way near to butter chicken gravy.The chicken pieces were tough and not fresh.The garlic naan was crispy and rubbery.In all the main course was a disaster.
After we finished with the main course I asked them to serve the desert and then they told me that it would take time which I should have been informed while ordering.Anyways it took around 25 minutes to arrive,but somehow this was the saviour.Full of fruits and three flavours of ice cream,this was the best part of the whole lunch.
Next for the payment part,when I asked whether they have card payment they clearly declined,but after that when I placed a 2000 Rupees note in the bill folder saying I did not have change,they said they have card payment.This was very unprofessional.
Not visiting this place again unless it is the last option left.

The food is tasty two.I have visited the place several times and once when I visited during Durga Puja I was disappointed as the food quality had gone down. Just to make sure I visited again once after the puja & thank I wasn't disappointed this time.

I went there during durga pujo on sashthi,26.9.2017. The food was horrible. We ordered for dry chilly chicken, mixed fried rice, chilly chicken and crispy chicken. 
The dry chilly chicken was very stiff. We couldn't even chew it properly. The mixed fried rice too had fault. It had very very less salt in it. We had to add salt, then we ate it. &  finally, we did a blunder ordering the crispy chicken. Ohhhhh God!!!  What was that????  It was soooooo stiff and tasteless. We literally ate it somehow by drinking water again & again. &  This is my last time here.. Such horrible food!!! 
We ate totally disappointed with the food.

Located near hatibagan more can easily catch your eyes....visited in durga pujo asthomi with beloved friends for dinner....there first annoying this is that the area of the place is not at all small but you can only use the washroom for handwash only....

We ordered chicken 65 for starters ( because only that one was available ), 2 plates of mixed noodles, 2 plates 2 plates of chicken rice, chicken sweet nd sour and schezwan chicken and also a dish of lamb....

Food: quality is normal...no especial think to mention...taste is like other normal Chinese restaurants...quantity is good....

Ambience: nice place...we seated in 1st floor....nice quiet ambiance for dinner...

Management: mark to the satisfaction level...although we have to wait some time for the bill after completing dinner but there food serving time was fast....

Price: reasonable nd like others restaurants...chicken 65 for starters , 2 plates of mixed noodles, 2 plates 2 plates of chicken rice, chicken sweet nd sour and schezwan chicken and also a dish of lamb costs 1900 rs...all dishes are inclusive gst....

We went there during puja and got our seat after 5 min. We ordered mixed fried rice, mixed noodles, garlic chicken and chicken manchurian. 
Mixed rice was okish but the noodles was horrible!!!! They had prwans not properly fried, more of oil and huge sized vegetables. They were bulky and tasteless. 
The chicken preprations were just horrible they has less of chicken more of bone and batter. 
The service was poor they took a lot of time to serve us. 
Defenitely not going there any more !!!!

Just the worst nightmare of any person . The food is like made the day before and served after reheating . The taste of the food is absolutely blunt , you wont feel anything in your taste buds . And the chicken is so hard that you cant pierce it with a fork , you will need a surgery knife to cut it .

We went there during puja and got our seat after 5 min. We ordered mixed fried rice, mixed noodles, garlic chicken and chicken manchurian. 
Mixed rice was okish but the noodles was horrible!!!! They had prwans not properly fried, more of oil and huge sized vegetables. They were bulky and tasteless. 
The chicken preprations were just horrible they has less of chicken more of bone and batter. 
The service was poor they took a lot of time to serve us. 
Defenitely not going there any more !!!!

Just the worst nightmare of any person . The food is like made the day before and served after reheating . The taste of the food is absolutely blunt , you wont feel anything in your taste buds . And the chicken is so hard that you cant pierce it with a fork , you will need a surgery knife to cut it .

Food is mediocre, Everything else is just slow, The service is way tooo long, Only good thing is the glasses of water are never Empty. Overpriced. Ordered a Chicken Gravy Noodles. The way it was distributed among us 3 people was kinda strange. Food was the only thing which saved it,though mediocre.

Worst food I've ever tasted, most of the chicken dishes were stale, the pieces of chicken were so over fried and hard, that even pricking the fork was not possible
the rice and noodles were cooked probably a day ago and were reheated to serve
i would positively recommend people to avoid this joint.

Went to this place yesterday,with six of my friends.
Even during puja we got a table within 2-3 minutes and the reason behind this was known after having the food.
We ordered Chicken noodles, Chicken Schezwan Rice, Chicken Manchurian and Garlic Chicken.
None of the dishes were upto the point.

•Chicken Noodles was tasteless with no veggies,

•Schezwan Rice tasted like normal Fried Rice,

•Chicken Manchurian was okayish and

•Garlic Chicken which is supposed to be hot and spicy was sweet.

The bill came upto 1360 which was really not worth the food.
The staff did not provide a proper service.
Overall a very bad experience of dining.
Definitely not going there again.

I had called up and the phone was received by a person who was not much sure about the menu and its prices. He was not sure if they do home delivery. I was not sure if they are going to deliver. THey didnt take my name or address but said they shall confirm by calling back!!!!! I though of my guests if they called up later and denied to deliver!!!! Am not very comfortable with the way they spoke, hesitated to take order and was totally unsure if they will deliver - almost next door from their restaurant.

It deserves 3 stars as the price is quite cheap..
U can have chicken biryani for just 125/-
Which is quite affordable..
It takes time to serve..

Heard of this restaurant since long. Just had the opportunity to experience it. Very ordinary items. Starters, appetizers as well as main course. Soups were to too sweet, fried rice was blunt, the item which they claim to be pan fried noodles is just a unsuccessful attempt to make gravy noodles. And for this they made us wait nearly 1 hour. Pathetic service, I must say.

This is a restaurant near the rupbani petrol pump hatibagan. The ambience is good but very sad to say the quality of the food is horrible. We have ordered mix rice, the shrimps in the rice were stinking and half cooked.. We have also ordered lamb which was not that good and the most disappointing part was serving, After placing order we have to wait near about 40 min to recieve our order the waiters were also extremely slow in serving the orders...

I went with my friend to this restaurant despite getting many negative reviews...nd trust me...itz one of the best services we have ever got..!!
The restaurant is 5mins walk from star theatre...beside the petrol pump in hatibagan area...!
Well,
We ordered hot and sour soup...mixed fried rice and chicken hongkong!we thought that the quantity wouldnt be enough for duo but...we had leftover as we were so full with the quantity and quality!!
Hot and sour chicken soup is also good..it was spicy in taste and full of chickn pieces,tomato,shrimp.and chopped green chillies!
The mixed fried rice was full of prawns chicken pieces and eggs nd the quantity they provide is for two people ..nd that is pretty much more in amount.
And the hong kong chicken was obviously shredded wd chicken and d gravy was of cashewnuts...capsicum ...and it was so yummy while tasting...! (As i like spicy dishes. 😛)
Now if we talk about the service...umm it took 10mins to come up with the dishes...and i am glad with their behaviour actually..!they r so prudent...!
Now as far as ambience is concerned...it is air conditioned and the ambience is so peaceful!
This is almost pocket friendly...but the service tax is higher...they dont take extra charge in case of parcel where they provide container!!

I went down to this place to stir up some good old memories of my college days, however was thoroughly disappointed. Firstly the delay in service, secondly the pathetic quality of food. The naan was literally like some kind of leather & the chicken that we ordered, was no different either. I seriously had some good memories of this place but after seeing the degradation of their quality, would never want to visit again.

And it was a total shit. Nothing was good... even the roadside Chinese food stalls make better food. I don't think the chicken was fresh..it was too stiff and smelling awkward.

Fusion is one of the popular restaurant in North Kolkata, specially in Hatibagan area that doesn't need any intro. One of the old restaurant in that area.

Location is very easy to find. Near to the Hatibagan Petrol Pump.

They have both Dine in and take out option. The roll counter is at the ground floor and the dine in section is at the first floor. Interior is well managed. Glass wall is the another attraction here. You can enjoy the outer view from your windows side table.

Service is quiet slow but the management is good. The stuffs are dressed in there uniform and they are polite and helpful in nature.

Fusion offers you a huge variety of item in various section like Chinese, Indian, Mughlai etc. I have tried their noodles, biriyani etc. All are moderate, not so special. But Tandoori Chicken Kabab is one of the hot favourite item to me. I came at least once in a moth to try their kabab. Every time I ordered it, it was perfectly grilled and the spice was used in perfect proportion. Served with Onion, lemon and green chatney, which is also yummy.

In conclusion I must say, Pocket friendly price of each item and the location is the main UPS for this restaurant. Overall a good restaurant where you can Dine In easily without any hesitation of your budget..

They are mainly famous for their Rolls in this area. Their price range is also cheaper than the other brands available in this area. Being part of a very much market place , their roll counter seems to almost overcrowded Everytime.

This place is a bit small and situated in Hatibagan. This multicuisine restaurant offers a large varity of menus to choose from and most of them are in reasonable price. 2 mixed Fried Rice is sufficient to feed 5 people (you shoud get the idea of quantity they serve from pictures). Food quality is strictly ordinary but they don't hurt your pocket. You have to get down to ground floor and swipe your card in the takeaway counter which is quite painful and annoying.

Came here at the invitation of a birthday party of a college senior. The upstairs were reserved for us. It was about three years back. As much as I remember the food was pretty good. 
We had Crispy Chilli Babycorn, which was excellent. There was Mixed Fried Rice and Mixed Chowmein along with one chicken dish and a fish dish, names of which I can't recall now. The main course was pretty average. Service was good, portions were huge as I remember all of us got a packet of two parcelled for home. Okay for a budget meal in the area.

Ambience - looks like a posh dine-in from outside , however u would be readily rectified once u take ur seats. The stuffs are unprofessional, not cooperative at all.
Foods - Bland, tasteless , less quantity and low quality. They cant even serve proper lime soda ! even the roadside stalls are better than this .

A very poor experience I had with their chinese food during the puja.
We ordered
Veg fried rice- the rice was not properly boiled,  appeared to be normal rice just seasoned with some vegetables. 
Chilly lamb-  I still wonder what it was! Pieces of rubber dipped in a silly gravy.
Crispy chicken- not crispy but chewy certainly!

Came here at the invitation of a birthday party of a college senior. The upstairs were reserved for us. It was about three years back. As much as I remember the food was pretty good. 
We had Crispy Chilli Babycorn, which was excellent. There was Mixed Fried Rice and Mixed Chowmein along with one chicken dish and a fish dish, names of which I can't recall now. The main course was pretty average. Service was good, portions were huge as I remember all of us got a packet of two parcelled for home. Okay for a budget meal in the area.

Location - opposite to Star Theatre,Hatibagan 
Ambience - looks like a posh dine-in from outside , however u would be readily rectified once u take ur seats. The stuffs are unprofessional, not cooperative at all.
Foods - Bland, tasteless , less quantity and low quality. They cant even serve proper lime soda ! even the roadside stalls are better than this .
Very much disappointed!

A very poor experience I had with their chinese food during the puja.
We ordered
Veg fried rice- the rice was not properly boiled,  appeared to be normal rice just seasoned with some vegetables. 
Chilly lamb-  I still wonder what it was! Pieces of rubber dipped in a silly gravy.
Crispy chicken- not crispy but chewy certainly!

Visited this place on Ashtami 2016. I liked the quietness of this place. The order came in quickly. Seven of us were there. All of us appreciated it. The food was good. It isn't very costly. I think they should improve their washroom though. It's located at a very busy place. So it's a go-to place. Good place to eat with friends and/or family. We ordered chicken noodles and Garlic chicken.

Like many other restaurants, this one too was promising when opened, and then gradually deteriorated. Last time we visited this place during durgapuja, while we understand that you can't expect great service during such busy times, but I think the least we can expect is clean plates and glasses. We were offered glasses with lipstick marks and dirty plates, and when we asked for replacing the glasses, they rudely said they can't understand what the problem was! Like it's normal to  have lipstick marks on glasses and give them to customers without even washing them. Never visited the place again.

On Saraswati Puja, 2014, we decided to opt for this restaurant instead of Arsalan, just for a change. The place was crowded. We decided to wait. After waiting for five minutes, a group of people were done with their lunch and hence they left. We proceeded further towards the table to take a seat. We were utterly disappointed as none of the staffs came to clear off the leftovers of the previous party. Still, we tried to cooperate with them but didn't get a humble behaviour in return. On being dissatisfied with their initial service, we all decided to leave without having lunch at Fusion. And, Arsalan came to our rescue.

If you want to eat good food then this is not the place to be. But if you want to eat rolls then definitely you can try them from the roll counter they have.
I had lunch once upstairs and boy it was disappointing. The mutton rogan Josh had such excess use of colour that even after washing my hands with soap it didn't go. The food had no taste whatsoever.
But the rolls are a different story altogether. A queue is always there. The size is really good so it is fills you up for a lot of time. Good pieces of chicken with onions and chilies.

Zomato should keep a down vote option like Quora. I might get some unfollows, but I don't care. People must be saved from the horror of bad dining.
Location- Opposite to Rupbani cinema hall Hatibagan.
Food- Horrible. Crispy chicken hard as rocks. Chicken noodles taste bland and the quantity can feed a bird. Chicken Manchurian again bland.
Staff behavior- They are laid back and late to serve. Arrogance is an add on.
Price - Price is very high compared to the quality of food.
But the roll counter serves good rolls at a reasonable price. 
This place is a no no for dinner.

One of the nearest restaurants from my place, so I usually do visit here.
The ambience is good amidst the hustle and bustle of the streets near Roopbani.
Food quality has been made worse.
On my first visit, it was so appreciable and but with time, it has deteriorated a lot. Hence prices aren't reasonable anymore. 
Staffs are not courteous. They are so reluctant to take the orders and serve the food as well.
Needs a lot of check on this part.
Would like to see the changes coming up soon. :)

I don't always feel like....lets go to dinner.
 If u just want to hang around with friends or ur loved ones and if ur pocket is crying....

Then this North Kolkata restaurant 🍴 is my best bet. ✌✌Just opposite of star theater in hatibagan mor,I would like to rate them 10 on 10 for their huge variety of starters. I only ordered chicken hot and sour soup, chicken tikka kebab and chicken seekh kebab. Indian n chinese foods equally were awesome...just WOW. 👌👌
If you go for ambience,the restaurant is yet another hit. clean,spacious,on road view from big windows....romantic one. 😍😍😍 So for @romantic ambience,I would rate it 8 on 10.
I ve visited many times there and I always get warm welcome,friendly,cordial n cooperative behaviour from the staffs. So no complains n rating is always 10 on 10 for their prompt servicing.👍👍👍
This restaurant should be placed in the hidden gem section,they deserve the place. @priyabrata ganguly.

I don't always feel like....lets go to dinner.
 If u just want to hang around with friends or ur loved ones and if ur pocket is crying....

Then this North Kolkata restaurant 🍴 is my best bet. ✌✌Just opposite of star theater in hatibagan mor,I would like to rate them 10 on 10 for their huge variety of starters. I only ordered chicken hot and sour soup, chicken tikka kebab and chicken seekh kebab. Indian n chinese foods equally were awesome...just WOW. 👌👌
If you go for ambience,the restaurant is yet another hit. clean,spacious,on road view from big windows....romantic one. 😍😍😍 So for @romantic ambience,I would rate it 8 on 10.
I ve visited many times there and I always get warm welcome,friendly,cordial n cooperative behaviour from the staffs. So no complains n rating is always 10 on 10 for their prompt servicing.👍👍👍
This restaurant should be placed in the hidden gem section,they deserve the place. @priyabrata ganguly.

Fusion is located at hatibagan beside the HP petrol pump opposite Star Theatre.

I went there on a sunday evening for late lunch and followed it up with an evening visit for snacks. The chinese here is great and the Indian as well as the kebabs wnt let u down. We were given a nicely cooked fried rice nd noodles alongwith jumbo chilli prawns but the shanghai chicken was a bad taster....

The tikka kebab was good but the prawn 65 was the show stealer

The ambience is good and the large glass windows give u a full view of hatibagan which looks like a pretty traditional north kolkata thing....a wooden themed interior adds upto to the calmness

The only worries are the availability of dishes and a slow service

I would say its a gud place to visit if u r hungry in north kolkata

Went regularly when in college. This is a average restaurant. Soups were very good initially. Last time when I visited, found the soup lost its quality. 

Biriyani and tandoori items were average. Chinese items were better in comparison. Fish dishes were good. Ambiance is nice with the big glass windows, you get a clear view of the road and glimpse of Star Theater.

Went to Fusion with my girlfriend. The ambiance is ok but the service from the waiters is very bad. The food is kind of ok we ordered hot and sour chicken soup which was ok and for main course we ordered chicken hakka chowmine and chicken n red wine chilli. both were okiesh but the quantity I found was less as compared to the pricing according to me. I would not go back there as I did not like the behavior of the waiters but I thing this will not apply always and would recommend people to visit and try this place out for themselves.

I went there on Ponchomi with my friends and obviously there was a long waiting list but thankfully we didn't have to wait long. The ambiance and the view from the window was indeed very soothing. The food was average but that is fine during the festive season rush. They were serving only Chinese. We had hakka veg noodles, hakka chicken noodles and veg fried rice along with garlic chicken and chilly baby corn. Had the quantity been larger, I would have loved it more. I would especially recommend the baby corn as the gravy tasted delicious and the baby corns were pretty crispy. So, thumbs up from my side.

Situated at walking distance from the Hatibagan More, this was supposed to be a great deal and a joint for such  great business area, but did not meet its expectations.

The food here is not seasoned properly.

Pros - Situated at good position for customer,the quantity of the food is quite good

Cons - Food ain't delicious at all., very much comparable to normal restaurants or roadside restaurants , nothing much out of ordinary. have to wait for a long,long time even if its a little busy night

I don't recommend visiting this place.

Was quite skeptical of going here. But my hungry stomach urged me not to judge and go for what is available. So ordered chicken rolls. Service is quick. But omg they added lime juice to the roll. Yuck. Tasted horrid. Ample amounts of fillings and chicken but too much of salt and lime juice made it a complete disaster. I guess i should have stuck to zomato and should have avoided this place owing to very poor ratings.

OK here it goes, this restaurant is YUCK! I had to give 1 star as that is the minimum according to Zomato's review format, but believe me, it deserves no star at all. There is no difference between fried chilli chicken and crispy chicken. Both are so over-fried that it has become hard and stiff. The prawns were uncooked, smelly, when enquired, they proudly said- we just boil it and don't fry! Brilliant! Now,comes icing on the cake, the fried rice was totally uncooked, so much that it was difficult to swallow. The service of filling the glasses with water was the only good thing, I found. The bitter most experience ever! 
I would definitely beg you, please don't waste your money here. We spoiled our lunch here, this durga puja.

I've been willing to review this place after the first experience I had 3years ago which had made me completely sour towards the place to begin with. It was a hot afternoon, my friends n I had waited for 45 minutes in line to get lunch, hungry as hell,  only to be told at the end of it that there was no seat available for 9. O well. More than 2yrs later I happened to find myself there once again. The reception was unsurprisingly cold, the staff is really queen n unwelcoming. But the food is pretty good. Good amount, great taste, n pocket friendly. So as much as I'd like to give a bad rating out of sheer personal hatred, the foodie inside has halted me from doing that. So there. It's a nice plc really. Pocket friendly restaurants are always a plus.

Simply serving Chinese food in neat porcelain dishes does not escalate its worth. The food served here, if it can be classified as Chinese firstly, is not much better than the roadside Chinese fare.

The Crispy Chicken was not seasoned at all, it just constituted of chunks of meat fried in oil. The noodles too were overcooked and burnt with salt. And the Kung Pao Chicken in the watery gravy and weirdly tiny pieces of meat was least palatable. The Fried Rice and Chicken Manchurian were decent though. I cannot validate for the North Indain served here, but after having the Chinese, I'd rather not find out.

The only pros include the view of a bustling Hatibagan below and the roll center downstairs which serves quite good rolls. If they wish to establish a reputation in the cut-throat Chinese cuisine market they really must pull up their socks.

This place is one of value for money food spot of this city.. It looks very nice from outside and the inside view thru the glass window concept is good.. Decor is average.... Coming in to the food it is really tasty and moreover very reasonable as well.. I really like their nawabi pulao, chicken tandoori, lababdar in Indian dishes and also in Chinese I think the dragon chicken is the best :) and looks good too... 
As per the service is concerned a lil slow but good if you want to sit and spend some quality time while having Ur meal...
Note: They do not take card in bill amount less than 350.. So keep that in mind :)
I recommend this place :) not being heavy on pocket is the main USP.. Plz carry this USP alwys

Just from the front view of Fusion you will get attracted by thinking the ambience of the restaurant will be good. When you entre to the place you will feel the place is even better. The front road view from the glass, elegant environment of the restaurant, some beautiful small decorations, beautiful warm white lighting, enough spacing makes the ambience of the restaurant so romantic so you will love to visit this place with someone special for a romantic dinner. Coming to the food the first thing to notice is the rates for the food is pretty reasonable. At the time of writing this review I had only tried Mutton Biriyani & Chicken Tandoori over here. Biriyani was very light, less spicy that tastes me nothing special. But the Tandoori Chicken impressed me in every angle, From how it was served to the taste of it everything was fabulous. Even I liked this Tandoori better than "Hatibagan Arsalan" that is nearby of this restaurant. 
Conclusion : Fusion is a great choice if you want to enjoy a romantic dinner with your loved once. Foods are just about average, you will get what you are paying for.

Fusion offers a typical Bengali concept of multicuisine. Located at the heart of Hatibagan market, it offers a kind of "satellite view", of the bustle below, through the glass décor. The interiors are not exactly what you could call adorable. The food is not culinary excellence itself, plated before you. But it is affordable and pretty adequate in amount as well as taste. The staff are a bit old fashioned with lopsided grins awaiting additional tips. For those in the mood for a light snack I recommend the Dragon Chicken. Those looking to fill up could opt for the Schezwan Noodles. The Kung Pao Chicken is another dish to try.

I first went to fusion with my mother when it just started doing business. It's a sprawling restaurant in the heart of North Calcutta. We ordered a take away- Manchurian chicken which was yummy!! That day I was walking past this restro and I thought of giving it a try again. I ordered lamb, hot garlic chicken and mixed chow mein. And I was disappointed to the core. While the lamb was chewy, chicken lacked spice though the chow mein was good. Considering the price, its not worth it any more.

They took an hour to serve the food..the waiters - they behave as if they are doing some kind of favor to us..when we asked them that why they are taking so long time to serve they literally got pissed off and showed us attitude...will never visit the place...food quality is also below average

After exam party and we decided to go to fusion. The appetizer chicjen lat mai kai was too spicy that can bring tears in your eyes. The main course items were Naan, chicken lababdar and the royal keema rice. The only taste you can have is of ghee. It's too much ghee they put that can ruin your taste buds.

Visited there yesterday with family.Trust me we had been a regular at this place and the food and quality had been quite worth its reasonable price, Quality and Quantity. Rating 4/5But!
The last two experiences had been so horrible that I am forced to rebuke this to an extent as to advice everyone DON'T EVER VISIT HERE.Reasons??1. Service: You will have to wait forever to get any food and that also when less than half of the restaurant is full..2. Reception: These people DON'T EVEN HAVE A SERVING TRAY! I mean seriously??? they brought the food on the table holding the plates in hands! More of BHAATH  er hotel than a restaurant!3. Food: Quality-wise I won't complain especially the Indian dishes. The chinese food is a bit below par. The gravy chicken chow was more of a Cabbage Chow than of Chicken Chow!Quantity is suffice to feed a person with a less than normal appetite.P.S: Beware of the old man with smirky looks who will come to take your orders!

Fusion - the WORST restaurant I have ever come across. Last Friday I went thr with my boyfriend. There was an old waiter who seemed to be very irritated as if he didn't want any customer in the restaurant. Now after we decided to order some Indian dish, that man came and told that nothing else can b ordered except chinese. Horrible! I mean what is the use of keeping the place open then? However he said that biryani 'may' be available. So we just ordered for special chicken biryani. To our utter horror, what he served us was stale biryani, kind if stinking. When we askd him he said that it is fresh which was a lie ofcourse. I simply HATE this plc. 
Pls DO NOT visit this place. And one suggestion to Fusion, "Please shut down the restaurant immediately. Spare people from the horror of your dustbin kind of food." The biggest disappointment ever!

Not sure why everyone has given such harsh comments but this place is not that bad ! Went there just yesterday with family and we ordered 2 special Biriyani which sufficed for the 4 of us . It had 4 pieces of mutton (we ordered mutton Biriyani) and one egg along with that regular potato piece ,so quantity and price wise it is quiet good but taste wise not that up to the mark . Apart from that we had ordered butter nan which was good like it should be and chicken bharta and butter chicken. From my experience the food quantity quality considering the price is good but not the taste . The places is nice ,good ambience but the staff is highly inadequate so it needs proper management first of all ! Anyways  from my experience its a 3 star rating from my side !

I have visited only once and truly and frankly speaking i liked this restaurant i have tried the fusion special rice and one chicken side dish(forgot the name) the rice and the side dish was too good and the quantity is enough for two. The most important thing the service is good and the ambiance is perfect for friends and couples. The thing which i had liked most is the rice which i had ordered it was totally wrapped with egg. I would like to visit here again.

Stay away from this place!!

 Although located at a good location and having good ambience, everything is wrong with the main thing here that is food! I have only tried their chinese and did not dare trying anything else! They serve street quality chinese food at a price similar to park street bar-b-q. Undercooked chicken items and thick grains of rice, similar to the rice that financially under-privilaged people usually eat. Not going to this place is highly recomended.

Don't GO TO FUSION. Because if you do your Fuse would go off. It's the worst restaurant in this area(alongside blossom). They don't even have the most items motioned in the menu. So here you have to eat what fusion wants you to eat. So...................perhaps you should go once there to have a lifetime experience. Ha ha

Not bad! Especially when you are at the locality and want to satisfy your taste buds!  True that it is not one of the best especially in a place like Hatibagan ( a place known for plethora of good food) but worth a try if you are feel like enjoying your food at a quiet place.
Must try includes i)American chopsuey and ii) Lamb dipped in oyester sauce.

Fusion is located opposite to the erswhile rupbani cinema in hatibagan and serves decent enough indian and chinese cuisine..They have a huge seating arrangement comprising of two storeys and the mbiance is comfortable and cosy for a family dinner..
The food here is decently priced,offering a large variety in their spread,recently they have revamped their menu adding quite a few distinct delicacies like chelo kebab and prawn biriyani..However the service is pathetic, rude staffs, one aspect which needs to be taken care of surely..Coming to the food:
Chicken Wrapped with Egg: Undoubtedly the best starter I tasted here, where small cubes of chicken are marinated with spices and deep fried with a coating of egg,something like mini kabiraji..
Golden fired prawn: Could have been better as the outer batter was way to thick..
Mutton Galouti Kebab: Worst ever!! have never known I have to literally tear apart a kebab which is known for its softness..
Prawn Biriyani: Lucknowi style biriyani with pieces of tiger prawn, actually liked the flavour and price is indeed cheapest for this dish..
Handi Gosht: It taste way to spicy, a thick tomato gravy finished with fresh cream..overdone with the balance of spices..
Fish Punjabi: They actually served us stale fishes which on complained was changed,definitely not expected from a place of this standard..
Overall the cheque comes to around 1250/- which is definitely cheaper considering the array of dishes we ordered, only if they can patch up those minor flaws,this can be a much better place..The chinese dishes are also flavourful and appropriate in quantity..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 1/5
Ambiance: 3/5

I've been to this place with a friend of mine and had ordered Biriyani and stuff. The food was uncooked and somehow I could make out that it was a stale meat. We had to leave with disappointment. A year later we decided to get home delivered chinese and once again they shattered us. This time the quantity was good but it was too spicy to eat. 

With both the bad experiences I recommend not even to loiter around this place. It's a big NO to go from my side.

2 on 5, for the food. The service is pathetic, and the staff is rude, and in need of some hospitality training. I had visited this restaurant once during Durga puja, and the attitude of the staff was pathetic. Most items on the menu are not available, and the worst part is, the staff tries to almost ask you to finish off your food fast and leave. They had snatched away the plate before I had finished eating, once. I still joke about this incident and I haven't been to the restaurant since then.

It is one of the worst restaurant in Kolkata.Ambiance-The only thing that saves the restaurant to close down.It has a good place(busiest place in Hatibagan and easily spotted) and has good ambiance inside as well.

food-I went here twice,first when it opened and ordered some basic Chinese dishes like Hakka noodles and schezwan chicken.It was the worst Chinese dishes that I have ever eaten in my life at that point.The noodles were half cooked and it was 

all sweet in the side dish.Then in the second time I went there to have a treat,then I ordered some Indian dishes(as I was too afraid to order any Chinese dish ).This time we have ordered Tandoori Chicken for starters and Nun and chicken bharta.

We couldn't eat the Tandoori chicken as it was so hard and the nun was full of oil.After that I decided not to go in this place.

This restaurant proves "Don't judge something/Someone just for its outer beauty".

You will get a varied menu options, standard ambiance and hygiene, and the pros stops there. The food quality has been degraded. The quantity has been reduced and price has gone up.

Impressive from outside and depressive from inside. Inattentive stuffs, less food quality, blunt taste of mixed fried rice is putting their grade down to me as I'm their old customer. No one is interested to take order, no one is serving after it comes to counter and even they are not asking for if we need something or not. Only sezwan Hakka noodles and swt & sour chicken is food still. Kabab and tandoori became thinner than before.

We had a small party a few days back so we ordered food from this joint as it was nearby my friend's place. The 2 starters that we ordered were chicken 65, dry chili chicken and both of them were damn spicy (too too spicy) and quantity was very less which is obviously a downside. In main course we ordered chicken fried rice, shredded hunan chicken and sweet and sour chicken. The rice was average and the hunan chicken was also not bad thus, both these dishes can be tried. I did not like the sweet and sour chicken at all as the taste was not quite appealing and the gravy was a bit watery and i would have liked it if it was on the thicker side.  The Bill was close to Rs.1000 (not more than that as far as i remember).

Right beside the Hatibagan Petrol Pump, this gem of a restaurant lies about serving okay-okay dishes. So here's my review (here comes the sarcasm):
Pros:
1. Seats are comfortable
2. Waiters are well mannered
3. You get to sit beside big windows which feels amazing in the monsoon season.
4. Salt and pepper are well placed on the table.
5. Plenty of napkins.
Cons:
1. Food: NEVER EVER TRY THE GARLIC NAAN IN THIS PLACE. 
2. The oldest waiter: NEVER LOOK HIM IN THE EYE AND ASK FOR HIS RECOMMENDATIONS!

Would I like to visit this place? Nuh-uh. 
Go to Hedua or Koshe Kosha, far better food.

First they told me to wait for some time and after 45 minutes when I asked them are there any sit is vacant or not, they told that yes. That seat was vacant for last 20-25 min and they did not bother me to tell that.How irratating !!!!!!! And most of all the food quality may local restaurants are far far better than this.

The Description: Just after crossing the star Theatre at Hatibagan crossing..My 1st Word for this Restaurant wen i went there 2 yrs ago. " AWFUL"  "DISGUSTING".

The Ambience: . A very big two stored restaurant. with full A.c and good ambience with transparent glass from the front for the resto. Lots of sitting arrangement. The waiters were quick to attend us.
The Food: I went with my family to have dinner there. they served the starters very quickly then after OH MY GOD!! after waiting for almost an Hour they cant serve the Main course food to us. It was so annoying. People started leaving the restaurant and so we did the same. 

The Conclusion: Don't know how much they have improved.. but my experience to this place was very DISATISFACTORY.
Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

one of most disappointing place i have ever visited. let's start with the positives, because that will be very few. the best thing is its location and obvious its space inside. they offer both 1st and 2nd floor for seating. that much i can recollet the good in this. 

now first of all, the stuffs are quite rude. u have to  request them multiple times even to refill your glasses. they have cold drinks in their menu card only, not in the freezers. their glasses were not properly cleaned also. in food, i ordered chicken fried rice, hot garlic chicken, schezwan chicken, chilli prawns. at first they don't use proper chawl for fried rice, the side dishes were very ordinary, tough to feel the taste. even their crowd control is not effective at all. so, as a whole i would think more than twice to go there further...

This is "Disappointment at its very best" and "Epitome of bad food".

I was there on last nabami and I swear I will never step into that building again. Despite the food being bad there was a queue outside the restaurant. People leaving the restaurant were not at all satisfied. We went in after a 30 minute wait in the rain and were seated right in front of the washroom. Thank You Sir for the lovely view I had. No place to keep your umbrella in a rainy day, chipped plates, useless attendants and what not.

Food!! Bad. We ordered CHICKEN NOODLES, SCHEZWAN CHICKEN and GARLIC CHICKEN. Never have I ever tasted such bad food. Somehow I gulped everything paid the bill and ran from that place. I will never recommend that restaurant even to my enemy.

This was one of the worst experiences I had while searching for food in Kolkata. Visited last night for dinner with 2 friends and we ordered one chicken kassa, chicken kolapuri, Veg kolapuri and cold drinks. 
First the rotis and nans that were served looked and tasted alike and there was no difference between nan and roti, then the rotis were half baked as well, least you will expect from a restaurant. 
Cold drinks that were served were not even cold, they didn't even say that it's not cold and served it, we had to return it. You can estimate the quality of service. 
Food was not as expected, made no impact to buds.
Ambiance was okay. 
Most important thing is it took them 2 long hours to serve us everything.!! 
Not recommended, a place not to visit twice if you have been there once.

If you ask me, don't go there. The ambiance and the decor are the only good things about it. The food is below average. You go to hedua which takes 10 minutes from there, you'll have blossoms which is far far far better. This place is expensive if you compare it with the standard of food. The service is below par. The have pork and lamb to offer which they can't cook. The view is good. Only one good offering they have are the rools, which are pretty good. Other than that, please skip it if you don't wanna write angry reviews later on.

My recent visit to this place has changed my mind and yes there is some speciality. We ordered a fusion special rice which had everything of mixed rice along with dry fruits and the whole rice was wrapped in egg. For side dish we ordered supreme chicken which was Chinese with a touch of masala.the food was really tasty and quantity was also good

Their location is fab..!! the view from 3rd floor is too good. they have the potential to pull the crowd & they should worked on it. In terms of food they have  is average.. chicken kohlapuri which they served is not so spicy as they pretend to be..& other dishes  like biriyani is sweet in taste.. which I dont like at all..!! actully they r following typical bengali taste.. having lit bit sweet in all.
so i rated it 3. :) thank you. :)

visited this place during durga pujas. it is a multicuisine resturant bt only chinese was available. they were not even accepting credit or debit cards. 3of us went there. to our surprise we were told that we would have to share our table with someone else. then where we sat the ac was not working. the whole time we were sweating like hell. we ordered schezwan chicken and greavy chicken noodles. the person we were had to share the table ordered fried rice and some chicken dish.
we had to constantantly beg the waiters for water, salt, sauce, spoon, fork and everything else that they should give. 
when the food came the quantity was like half plate. the first bite we felt like throwing the food down the drain. everything was half cooked. the chicken was really hard and the noodles stinked. 
when we told it to the person who took the order he tells that as they had to cook the food quickly so it is half cooked and we hav to adjust. when we asked him to call the manager we were told that there was no manager. we had to throw away the food and a total waste of money.
on a table adjacent to us people had the same complant. when they were leaving a waiter pushed the young girl, made a face and went away as if nothing happened. 
please donot ever go there. even if you have to stay hungry. 
worst experience in a resturant. would have given negative rating if it was possible. they had written to please rate them in zomato. so here was my first and last experience in the resturant.

Visited this place yesterday during the puja rush hour at 3.30 pm on Nabami(13th Oct) this year. While at entry a lady in the queue hinted to us that the food was 'bakwas', and that they are here because all other better places are filled up. She told me  just have the food to don't taste it. After waiting in the pouring rain for about 25minutes,the three of us went in.
Okay so we were there at the rush hour. But why the hell were we placed in a seat facing the toilet? I agree that it was raining hard outside but why wasn't there a sweeper to sweep the wet floors? Some of the customers with wet umbrellas were treated rudely as well.
We had to wait for 15mins for someone to take our order.Patience was short and I had to call out the waiter to take our order.
The plated were chipped of at the edges. There was lack of discipline among the waiters. Clumsiness was defined. The Chicken noodles,Scezhwan chicken, garlic chicken we ordered, all were bland,
The noodles were very dry. The gravy in the side dishes were all very bland. The meat balls tasted of only boiled chicken. No taste of spieces.
So we only ate and didn't taste or relish the food. 
I didn't have a good experience at this place. We pay for our food to receive best service even at rush hours. Not for bad seating and bland food.

Apart from the ambience, there is nothing commendable about Fusion. Long queues, pathetic food and prices above the rest make this restaurant simply bad. I remember that last time I had food there, they had not even removed the shell from the prawn they used in the fried rice, and imagine how it feels in your mouth. Freaking hell! But the ambience is really good if you take the seat by the window especially.

Food and "fusion"!
3 out of 5

Fusion near Star Theatre is one of those places that looks pretty on the outside but still requires some amount of improvement on the inside. It is a smart looking place with comfortable and well arranged sitting arrangements. The place has a certain amount of natural feel to it due to the glass walls. The service can be inconsistent sometimes; prompt and efficient on the one hand and slow and incompetent on bad days. On days that you are not in a hurry such inefficiency can be overlooked. There is also lack of consistency with regards to the quantity of the food served to the diners. The quality on the other hand is fresh and healthy. Both their Chinese and North Indian preparations are satisfactory. The price of food is also acceptable and within a reasonable range.

From their very limited soup options, you can savor some nice chinese flavors with their chicken hot and sour soup, chicken manchow soup and sweet corn soup. Their Chinese starters (like chicken 65, crispy chicken, chicken drumsticks and golden fried prawns) are delish items. 

They can be very generous with their fried rice and noodle staples. You need to keep this in mind while you order them. Some top noodle and fried rice picks to be had from here can be their mixed Sichuan Hakka chow, chicken Hakka chow, mixed Sichuan fried rice and mixed fried rice. Some of the side dishes to go with these dishes are the usual Chinese basics like chili chicken, sweet and sour prawn, Manchurian fish and Sichuan prawn.

Their north Indian preparations are worth a shot though I didn't much care for them. Kebabs like chicken tandoori, chicken reshmi kebab and mutton bare kebab were well prepared and can be had as starters.

Please friends don't ever want to visit Fusion. Their quality is pathetic and quantity also price is too high and also most of the time their AC doesn't work. Their Mughlai dishes are too bad, Chinese food is average. Most of the old staff are missing before their quality was far better but now really is pathetic. Please owner try to bring your old chef rather than wasting time. I would never visit that shop.

From outside it looks like a premium restaurant but as you step inside the ambience is satisfactory. Now be seated and next 10minutes be seated only, none of the staff comes up to attend you...which is really disgusting. Now all this could have been overlooked to some extent if the food was up to the mark but it is a far distant. I tried Indian cuisine and was disappointed to the fullest thanks to the sugary chicken reshmi butter masala. Quantities are really confusing. The only thing which i liked is butter naan as it was really tender and tasted good!!

This is a very average place to be honest. The choice of menu is ordinary and its taste is ok but nothing great. The staff needs to be trained and service needs to be much faster because we do not have all the time in the world. 
In short come here only if you don't have any other choice or else you can easily skip this one. The prices are not too high but definitely not worth the food you get here.
So for me this place has potentials but has too really work hard and I would rate it 3.

Chinese here is decent. Nothing exceptional, but good. Portions are confusing. Soup quantity was almost non existent but the fried rice amount was huge. Crispy babycorn was good. The meat and taste of Sweet 'n' sour chicken was good, but there were hardly any veggies. 

All in all if you are nearby and hungry, do try. But not worth traveling for.

God !! my TMJ was killing me as I tried my best to tear apart the flesh !!! the soup was like a liquid soap with loads of chicken fat in it !! the blue lagoon was the saving grace !! it tasted lyk a road side campa cola :p Stay away from this well decorated resto at North kolkata

The only thing worth mentioning is the Glass facade this restaurant sports,lending a bright and airy feel to the place. But thats where the good things end.The place is unpredictable.somedays Food is pretty ordinary,while on other days its downright appaling. Prices are acceptable.But service is poor. I once had a disturbing experience here. 8 of us had gone there for lunch,and we had ordered,amongst other things,4 plates of mixed fried rice.upon arrivel,we were surprised to see that although 3 of the plates had piping hot food,1 of them was stone cold.The waiter wasnt cooperative;and although we finally managed to change that particular dish,I kind of lost faith on them after this incident. Quantity isnt their strong point either. Its only their seaating arrangement which gets good marks. Overall,id give it 1.75 out of 5

This place is a wild card, you walk in & don't know what to expect. It is quite near my place so I have been there a lot of times. The Moghlai preparations have been awesome & so has been several Chinese dishes but there have been times when they have turned down almost all the dishes I ordered. After a few visits I realized that on days their restaurant is hired for occasions (you can notice whether the pandal on the roof is decorated or not), you wont get good service. On other days, it is quite awesome.

I have been here twice, once during the pujas to add to my demise. The three waiters really need to pick up on their attires, service and mannerisms. Whatever I questioned for availability they simply looked at me with a blank expression, as if to suggest they have heard the name of the item for the very first time. The food didn't disappoint me. The lamb served by this restaurant was quite a lip-smacking one and ofcourse the tandoor items. It does look classy from outside but it fails to retain its charm when you spend an hour or two inside. Sometimes the ACs don't work giving you a sore feeling of suffocation. Nevertheless an average eat out i would personally suggest to avoid.

The decor is nice,looks fantabulous ,so as the price.

but the biryani i ordered was too sweet,the tandoori chicken was totally bitter because it was burnt. When i complaint about this ,the stuff said "this is how tandoori chicken tastes",now i don't know from where they are trained but they definitely have no taste on food. 

I did not like the place at all,at the price i can get quite good food at any other place.The only good thing about this place is the outlook,which misleads foodies like us.overall very bad.
