Zomato should update the menu and pricing. Although the bar straight f@@k. Overpriced foods that's all. Worst experience ever. Nothing else to say.

The food is okayish but the issue is this place feels like not well maintained and some fishy stuff going on, like the bill is not proper at all. The rate card given here is totally north of what is written. Wont be my first suggestion.

I visited there once with my family. I wish i don't have to get in there for the 2nd time. Ambience is okay. But who cares about ambience when food is not up to mark. Waste of money and peace.
