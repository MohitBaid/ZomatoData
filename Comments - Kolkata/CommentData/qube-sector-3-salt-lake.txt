This place is great for having cocktails.I have tasted the Long Island Iced Tea here(475.00) (5/5).It was a awesome progression of taste experience.

Vodka,Tequila,Light Rum,Triple sec,GinÂ  and the splash of Coke made it beautifully powerful.It was a perfect different spirits collide served on my table.

The most important thing they serve here is the great Chaats which perfectly goes with it.

The ambience here is OKAY (3/5).

The bartender & waiters here got really good behaviour and manners.

If you want to have a great experience of cocktails which is brilliant in taste & perfect,tasty Chaats(important),this place is for you.

Qube the restaurant within the hotel sojourn is your fall back place when you want to try a safe place. They serve excellent continental. Conveniently located right off the street bang opposite salt lake stadium

Not up to the mark in my opinion. Been there with colleagues but the ambience was missing. Firstly the declined to serve sizzlers but later on agreed on that. The most disappointing point was the music.  I dont know from where the get those music but those RJ speeches at the end of every song was disgusting. Also the place is small compared other pubs that I visited earlier. Hence overall a meh meh feeling!! 
P. S. - The sizzlers were awesome.

QUBE used to be my go to PUB for ages; whenever I wanted to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city and the 'dikchik dikchik s' of modern overcrowded pubs!! Though its location is very prominent Qube doesn't get much of customers, mostly in house guests and regulars who are seniors and who wouldn't review on zomato. This place holds a very special place in my heart and I associate it with a lot of found memories!!

This is located inside hotel Sojorn(beside Amri) . It's tiny, but the interiors are rocking!! With walls intercepted with LEDs, a big TV(which plays or atleast used to play mostly hindi movies), comfortable & artfully done sofas and a small bar counter this place has an interesting decor. The cocktails are quite good, but nothing innovative, its mostly your run of the mill screwdrivers and bloody marys. They definitely offer a variety when it comes to both alcohol and food. Speaking of the food, i have had many a salads and starters at this place and every time they wowed me. The food is amazing - great quality, great quantity, great presentation. With the alcohol, they are never stringent, the cocktails tastes delicious and the raw materials used are of good quality.

The staff are very courteous, diligent and attentive. After a few visits we became like friends and they knew our usuals. And they knew i loved the 'chat' that came with alcohol and they were always ready with refills even before I could ask for.

But I must warn you, the prices are on the higher end, and comes with a zillion extra charges.

The only problem with this place is its marketing!! If they marketed the place better, they would have a lot many more customers.

I wish them all the very best for the future!! :)

I really like this bar, it's small but feels very comfy. The good thing about it is that it rarely gets crowded. Recently they hiked there drinks n food prices, that's the only reason I'm giving it a 4 star.

perfect decor for a quiet pub. Starter is not worth that good worth mentioning. The alcohol is pocket friendly. Just a bunch other rowdy and moron customers ruined my first visit though. Will visit soon hoping not to see them there again..

This a very quiet lounge bar in Salt Lake City. It is located in a hotel just behind the salt lake stadium.
I have been going to this place for a few years now. Its a favorite hangout place for our school friends batch.
The ambience is quite good but with limited seating option. Most of the times the place is empty, and hence we are served quite well by the staff :P
Prices of drinks are slightly more than the other bars in that area. But then again we don't mind because of the nice setup.
We have tried lot of starters here. The kebabs are good. Chicken reshmi/tikka tastes good and quite juicy.
Other non vegetarian dishes are also good here.

Ambience 3.5/5
Quality 3.5/5
Quantity 3.5/5
Cost 2.5/5
Overall 3.5/5

P.S. adda dewar jonne bhalo jayga

This lounge is a hidden treasure in Salt Lake. Located on the 2nd Floor of Sojourn Hotel, Qube is an in house Lounge and bar which attracts very selected customers as it is not hyped. I recently visited this place on a weekday with a friend who is a regular out here since its inception. 
Ambiance: The interior is nicely done up with red dominating most of the decor. It has a well stocked bar with high bar stools and sofas with 3-4 tables which can accommodate around 15-20 people. 
Food: The is where people come to have a drink or two. Drinks are very reasonably priced, much less than expected. A small peg (30ml) of signature costs Rs100. Beer is priced around Rs 165-Rs200. 
We ordered Chicken Sheekh Kebab and Tandoori Chicken. The Sheekh Kebab was really well made with the spices perfectly marinaded. It was very delectable, one of the best I have tasted so far!!. The Tandoori chicken was tender and succulent, one of the better Tandoori Chicken I had in the city. 
The lounge also has a long list of cocktails and mocktails on offer which are again reasonably priced ! We ordered an orange based mock tail which tasted pretty decent. Price :Rs130 

Service: The staff was very courteous and polite. No complaint regarding that, but they took a lot of time to serve the 3rd peg to me. I would give that a benefit of doubt and consider as one of case. They usually play party and remixed music from 9PM onward which creates the right mood for partying :) 
Overall a nice place to hangout after work and does not pinch the pocket too much.  I wont be able to state the exact price for two as I did not pay that day, but drinks for two along with snacks should set you back around Rs1200-Rs1400
A nice place to visit if you are around Salt Lake Stadium.
