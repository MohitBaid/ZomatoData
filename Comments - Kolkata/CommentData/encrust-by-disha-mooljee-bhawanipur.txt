The sweetest person i have met, with a talent for making amazing cupcakes... i had ordered 6 pieces of chocolate cupcakes for a friends birthday and the smile on her face was worth it..... it was short notice but she was ready to make them overnight......
pros:
amazing baking skills
cute presentation
sweet and courteous baker
delicious cakes
cons:
not many people are aware of her talent

thank you for the cakes Disha it made a person real happy... next time i will be sure to order a day early....
P.S. order should be placed at least 24 hrs before

This is new concept i found in calcutta.
This place does not have a outlet. She is baker from home.
I tried her cupcakes and the chocolate cupcakes. Really good cupcakes. As the name says, crust is so soft..i really liked the cup cuke with whipped cream. Everything was balanced. Not too sweet and tasty. 
I would be ordering a cake sometime n then can update abt its review too..meanwhile do try cupcakes.

Amazing & tasty cupcakes without pinching your pocket. You can gift them on any occasion. I gifted them to my mom on Mother's day and she really liked it. And yes she made them at very very short notice. Thanks Disha for helping me in making the day special for my Mom.
