One of the best places to dine in dum dum but I feel it's a bit underrated
The ambience and service is excellent and the staff courteous.
Coming to the food the chocolate Momo tastes heavenly. Kaichi chicken drumsticks are lip smacking.  Smoked chicken fingers and hakka noodles are delicious.. The chilli chicken combo is also good.
This place is definitely a must visit when in dum dum. I am looking forward to my next visit.

I ordered mixed hakka noodles and chicken chaap through zomato. The noodles were fine- average to be precise. 
Now let's come to chicken chaap.
A) It looks like anything but chicken chaap.
B) I took me five minutes to chew one small piece of chicken. Now there can be two possible reasons- Either the chicken used was an old one OR it had been overcooked.
Quite frankly it seems like a waste of money. I feel like throwing away the entire thing. If possible I can return the food tomorrow morning and preferably get a refund for this. Thoroughly disgusted. Never ordering food from here again

Had heard a lot about this place for the food they serve but could never visit it. Today visited the place and ordered Chicken Momo. The Momo came along with their homemade sauce. The Momo had a little bit of oil on the surface which turned out to be the melted fat of chicken. The stuffing is juicy and very tasty. One suggestion to the management is to have a Chicken Cheese Momo on the Menu as their brand name has cheese included. Look forward to visit again!!

Though this place has quite attractive combo meals it's not very good. I visited this place one evening with my friend. Firstly there were no staff present at the moment after some time after we sat one staff came for the order. We ordered choco syrup brownie. They told us it would take 10-15 mins as they  bring the food from their Subhash nagar branch. It was quite weird. Then brownie was too small as compared to the price. You will get better brownies elsewhere at cheaper price of course! 
The decoration was average. They need to look after a lot of stuffs. Overall not a good experience. I do not recommend this place.

Don't know why this place is rated 3.5, deserves more! I ordered from this place last week via swiggy and was so satisfied that placed the same order yesterday again!
So both the times I ordered kaichi chicken drumsticks.
They give 8 big pieces with enough meat (not just coating of cornflower like some joints serve🙄). The chicken was cooked well, succulent and the sauce was amazing! It was not too dry and not too gravyish either. Loved the taste.
Pocket pinch- 160 INR only which is a steal for 8 pieces nowadays!
Can't comment on the decor and all since haven't been there but the food is definitely top notch!

I haven't had a chance to visit the place yet so don't know about the ambience...But I order a lot from it. The food delivered is always freshly cooked and delicious. The best thing is, at an affordable price(read: less) we get a really good quantity. The Chinese dishes are awesome. I have tried almost every main course chinese chicken preparations..And  all are great. 
I would recommend this place to everyone who eat out frequently and is looking for a cheap place with great food.

I read the good reviews and was eagar to visit , but as my week off day is Tuesday and they are close in Tuesday I was disappointed ..

Anyway I ordered online today at around 4 in the evening to deliver me at 10.30.

Process were easy staffs were helpful.

I ordered for one kaichi chicken , 2 mixed Hakka noodles and 1 chilly chicken(140).

Though in the order menu it came as sweet and sour chicken(170) .

I was OK with that.

The bill was 662 , and I was to get a 60 rs spcl zomato discount and bill came in mail supposed to be 602.40 rs.

Now at the time of delivery the guy took the bill of 668 !! I don't know why.
I am supposed to pay the amount which zomato shows not the original amount.
I am sure they will adjust the money in my next order.

Other than this it was truely wonderful experience.

Home delivery was very smooth and the guy name ashis was very nice.

He also suggested me to order from there new branch too.

The kaichi chicken was really wonderful , exactly how it should be.

Never thought I will get this quality ever in dumdum cantonment - durganagar area ..

Sweet and sour chicken was also very nice , chickens were juicy.

Though I didn't like the Hakka noodles much.
It was less cooked and may be I will have the fried rice next time.

Overall good experience and would order again soon.

You guys are doing a great job CNC team , just be little more cautious about billing and overall satisfaction of food.

Best of Luck

After this I finally could visit the restaurant, it was a nice ambience , very friendly , and enjoyed the time. 

Spcl maintion for there chilly prawn , it was nice. Though as the noodle was i didnt like the veg fried rice. It was little more on the spicy side because of extra portion of black pepper. 

But overall nice experience. 

The ambience , the quality of food , the service , and the nice behaviour made this place a perfect dining out option in dumdum area. 

Atleast a much much better option than pleasure hut or debonier. @

Located just opposite Subhash Nagar Maidan near Dum Dum Cantonment station. Is not very spacious so not suitable for dates, but if you want a place to catch up with your friends, this place is fine. 
The food is good. Though if you ask the service staff for suggestions, they'll be clueless. Instead, ask the lady who mans the billing counter. She is very polite and well spoken.
I have tasted a lot of their Chinese items, among which I'd recommend their kaichi chicken, mixed fried rice and garlic chicken the most. None of them are authentic Chinese but the comfortable Indo-Chinese we have grown up eating. My only complaint about the food is their Brownie. I had tasted it once, but the brownie was not fudgy, nor was it fluffy so it could be called a cake. It was just a dense mass of chocolate. 
Quite pocket friendly. Recommended if you live nearby and don't want to travel too far.

The place is beside Dum Dum Cantonment subhasnagar grounds. The area is small but well decorated in budget. Most of the vegetable starter's were not available as we were quite late. The waiter had a good behaviour. Ate Chicken taipei, fish finger's, drums of heaven, mixed gravy noodle's and dry chili chicken. I want to point out chicken taipei as fav of the lot we ordered. It was juicy, had a smoky garlic smell and was served with sauted onions and capsicum. The quantity was good too. Overall a good experience

It was such a pleasant surprise I must say, especially given the locality! Then the moment I stepped in, it created a completely different impression. More of an ambience fanatic, so loved the get up and the crockeries too. And guess that's why I haven't been talking about the food since it wasn't that great. Combo offers were interesting, mind you only on the menu rather than on the platter! Then may be one should visit the place to be a better judge.

The place is small and cosy and not very hard to find. I wonder about the name though
 Non the less, I tried Chinese over there. Given the ratings I was disappointed.  The portions are okay for a person. I liked their chicken drumsticks, but the chili chicken & rice combo was something you can expect from most average joints. But they are cheap on the pocket! And I really like their serveware and cutlery.

I am so glad to write a review for Choc N Cheese ! It is incredible to see the quality of Chinese food being served out from their Kitchen!

We first went to Choc N Cheese at around 9 PM, a family of 5(Excluding my Angel as she was only 1year old at that time). The interior was small and neat with 8-10 tables firmly arranged divided into two sections, but place is bit small and parking is real trouble for us as we are having Ertiga (which is quite difficult to park there).

There were many pictures mounted on the wall, Chinese lampshades etc ….

We started with a sea food soup and chicken garlic soup there, Schezwan wings and chicken dimsums.

Schezwan wings and chicken dimsums were the best – with a mild, ginger based marinade and a super thin flour coating probably.

For main course, we ordered a Hot garlic chicken, chicken chap, laccha paratha, mutton kasha with cashew and chilly fried rice.

Fried rice is large enough to share with 2 persons.

And it doesn’t piches your pocket!!!!!

Gone again there and got same treatment, manager/owner of the firm is really friendly and stall is also generous. 

The quality of food was superb, but restaurant is bit congested and tables are to small for accumulating more than three peoples.

But despite of all these issues, I still love their delicious food and ready to travel 15 km as it is located bit away from my home.

Really shocked after reading few negative reviews but still have faith on you Guys!!!!!!!

Highly recommended and keep up the great work - 4.5 without a doubt.

I happened to accidentally discover it whilst browsing through Zomato. I am quite pleasantly surprised because this Outlet is hardly 2 km from my residence, yet I wasn't aware about it.

Extremely satisfied with the quality and quantity. And suits your budget too!
I am also impressed with the ambience.

I am an old customer. Today. I ordered fish finger and chicken curry dry. Inspire of repeted instruction the chicken curry dry was not tangy at all although I insisted for that. The fishfinger made meng  down. The amount u  r charging and the piece size u r serving is not. At all good.only the behaviour of priyankar and prakriti is so. Nice that I visit again and. Again. But both of u have to be carefull  abt quality and quantity . don't take me wrong but you all are our belief.we trust u and that is why we go. But this short of service will bound us to think other alternatives .

I will definitely visit again very soon to have the BarbQ kabab.. That one sounds very delicious too.. My only suggestion to the management to make the ambiance more attractive, just add some music in it.. That will make Choc n Cheese complete.. See u soon..

This is the ultimate place for all dwellers of Subhasnagar, Dum Dum Cant. as we really lack good foodie outlets here but that demand has been satisfactorily fulfilled by Choc N Cheese. Home delivery service is also prompt but at times we do have to wait for long time after ordering.. I find all items interesting as Chinese cruisine happens to be my all time favourites and the well known management of this foodie outlet have gradually brought various changes since its grand opening.. To name a few preferred items Dim sum, chilly chicken, chicken down south, lachcha paratha, kosha mangsho, taipei chicken, coriander fish, chicken hakka noodles, and many more comes on first.. I thank the Choc N Cheese management for all its attempts! 😊

The ambiance is good. The starters are good,the side dishes we took were good but,the main rice dishes were awful.
First we ordered fish fry that came with a little bowl of mayonnaise, the starter was good.
Then We ordered Fried rice with chilly Chicken, the chilly Chicken was tasty.
Then we ordered Chicken Biriyani with Mutton Kasha,the Mutton Kasha was good.
First of all they served us on thermocol plates,then the rice dishes were served in a plastic bowl which is suppose to be used for parcel. 
The place has a good ambiance for taking pictures and selfies,just that...

What a lovely restaurant to have your food. This kind of restaurant is long overdue in Dum Dum Cantonment area. A restaurant with beautiful ambiance, good food that too  pocket friendly. Now the restaurant is pretty much spacious to host small birthday party or get together there. I'm regular here and will continue to do so. I love staff's here. Clearly a good hangout zone in Subhash Nagar.

I would have given a 5 star rating had I not found a 15 cm strand of hair in my Chicken Chap. Yesterday it was raining cats and dogs and quite a few eating joints denied home delivery due to it. Also, my order was 'small'. However, these people delivered my order of a Schezwan Fried Rice and a half plate Chicken Chap in time. I was very impressed with the delicious food until ... oh well I just hope I would not be getting cockroaches and spiders next time. 
 All the best !

A simple lovely restaurant you can visit it anytime of the day, be it for your evening cup of tea and samosas, fries and chicken or even dinner. It might be small, but it has a lot of things going for it, the ambience, the variety of dishes available and the sheer value for money, which I guess is the USP of this place. Definitely a place I would recommend to my friends.

My friends and i decided to try some of their dishes...we had their kfc combo which consists of one fried chicken french fries and a coke...
For deserts we had choco syrup brownie...
Each n every item we tried tasted great...the brownie was hot n soft...
The chicken was nicely fried and considering the price they charge for it they can easily be a healthy competition for kfc...
I would have given a complete 5 but their service was a bit slow which was a turn off otherwise great place

On being recommended by my friend I decided to go check out this place for myself. Me along with my sisters and my brother-in-law decided to dine there this evening. And the first worth mentioning point about this restaurant is its position, it's located just on the road and is very easily accessible. On entering the place the first thing that catches your eyes is the bright vibrant orange color and the design on the wall. The first part of the restaurant is quiet cramed and can be too cozy for some people's liking but the part inside though small is quite pleasantly sized and has a very catchy spray-painted wall. It will surely bring a smile on your face as the wall is adorned with figures of nonte-fonte, batul-di great,feluda n etc. 


The menu card is very well divided into parts and can be easily understood. The combo's looked really pocket friendly and also perfect for evening snacks. We ordered a plate of chicken fried rice, chicken Hakka noodles and the premium chili chicken. The service was of a moderate rate, neither it was super fast nor did it take a lifetime to come.  On being served we were very happy with the quantity as it was ample and also a shocker that how at such a moderate price such amount was being offered. The taste was really good, having expected a moderate taste, the place did really shock me and pleased my taste buds. The rice was well cooked with just the right amount of egg n vinegar in it. The noodles were al-dante and were just perfect and were really made to be slurrped away. And the dish that deserves a special mention is the chilli-chicken, the gravy was lip-smacking with the perfect balance of spice and tang and the chicken was very soft and just melted in the mouth. 

The price is really very pocket friendly and hardly effects your wallet yet the food satisfies you along with the ambience and the service of the restaurant. 

Its a must visit and really a blessing for the people residing in dum dum cant.

(Please read till the end of the review for my changed impression of this food joint after my 1st visit)
Me and my food-buddy had been looking up places where we can eat a lot without hurting our pockets much when we found this place on zomato and finding it at a walking distance from our house decided to visit it the very evening! Entering it we found a cozy sitting area, a little too cozy for our liking that we found out later as seating at the 2 seater tables can become a bit crampy for long-legged people. The decor was good and being air conditioned scores some points in its favour. We got hold of a menu from a neighbouring table and perused it for a while finally deciding on ordering 8 pieces of dimsums, mixed schezwan fried rice, mixed hakka noodles and spicy hunan chicken. There wasn't a waiter to b seen, only a lady was there at the counter, so I had to get up and go upto the counter to place my order which I didn't like much. After placing our order it did take quite an age to arrive and we being hungry didn't quite like it. The dimsums had arrived first and what we saw was those were really quite small. They had previously asked us while placing order that whether we would take hot sauce with the dimsums or hot and sweet sauce and we had opted for the hot and sweet one. Now this hot and sweet sauce,we saw, was red chillies in honey along with some sesame seeds which made us wonder whether we had been better off ordering the hot sauce but it seemed to complement the test of the dimsums quite well. However I did feel that the dimsums tasted a bit doughy and may b they could have done with a bit more processing. After the dimsums came the fried rice, noodles and the chicken and what our first impression was that the quantity was quite less from the usual standards that we had come to expect from other restaurants,which made us wonder that may be this is the catch of the very pocket friendly pricing. However the quality of the food was good. The gravy of the hunan chicken went really well with the schezwan rice and although the noodle wasn't anything extraordinary, it tasted good enough. Owing to the less quantity of the chicken we decided to order another side dish and this time a waiter being present we placed an order of hot garlic chicken to him. This time it came faster than our 1st orders and we thought that may be that delay had been due to the dimsums. The hot garlic chicken somehow looked much fuller in quantity and tasted really good too. My food-buddy had been mentioning the absence of any dessert item from the menu since the beginning and when we got up to pay at the counter the lady asked whether we would like something for dessert, that is when we found out that they had a seperate list of dishes which had not been yet included in the main menu and from there we ordered ourselves a hot fudge sundae. The hot fudge sunday was a sizeable scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce sitting on top of a piece of brownie and believe me when I tell you that it was just heavenly! All our griefs with the place vanished on tasting it, it tasted so damn good!

So all in all a nice place with good food at a very pocket friendly pricing and I will go back to the place even if its only for that heavenly hot fudge sundae!

2nd edition :P

I don't usually revisit my reviews but this food joint is one of those things about which I had a change of impression after my 1st visit and hence this excitingly appreciative 2nd edition of the review was long overdue! :D

Well, after my 1st visit I have visited this place quite a number of times, be it for take away or a casual dine in, and have tried out quite a few of their offerings! Among them those that need special mention are the deep fried chicken range of items which, in my opinion, can easily give KFC a run for their money!
Another is their various chicken wings, the shangdong and kaichi wings being my favourites!
Then there are the wraps. I've tried all three-the chilli chicken, the CDS and the pizza style. Each of them are good but the chilli chicken wrap is my favourite. If you are looking for something light and less spicy, then the pizza style wrap should be your choice.
The sandwiches are pretty decent too!
And among the chicken main course dishes, I found the pan fried chilli chicken (hunan style) worth the mention here.
So for the sake of all these delicious dishes, I am but forced to change my rating from 3.5 to 4.5! :)

Another is their various chicken wings, the shangdong and kaichi wings being my favourites!
Then there are the wraps. I've tried all three-the chilli chicken, the CDS and the pizza style. Each of them are good but the chilli chicken wrap is my favourite. If you are looking for something light and less spicy, then the pizza style wrap should be your choice.
The sandwiches are pretty decent too!
And among the chicken main course dishes, I found the pan fried chilli chicken (hunan style) worth the mention here.
So for the sake of all these delicious dishes, I am but forced to change my rating from 3.5 to 4.5! :)

A complete package for all the cool foodies out there. 
With great food and great decor it's a perfect little food hub for all the foodies in the planet I assure! ; )
And most importantly unlike other food corners you will be pampered enough with love n care by every member of the unit.
Love to visit it again n again n even in my dreams.

This area badly needs some good food joints; cafe; and restaurants. Choc N Cheese fits somewhere between cafe and restaurants.  Look wise it resembles a cafe but menu says it is a restaurant.
We like the foods served here; specially 
the newly added Indian preparations. More Indian foods should be introduced.
Pros
1. Quality of food
2. Ambience
3. Behaviour
4. Presentation
Con's
1. Space- Table and restaurant; it is very difficult to adjust in a 2 seated table
2. Service - no one will come to take ur order or provide you the bill; sometimes u have to ask for water also
3. Taste - lack of consistency

Ordered chinese home delivery today, gravy mixed noodles and 2 types of chicken. The chow was nice, but chicken dishes were slightly bland.

This restaurant/cafe is at a stone's throw from my house. As a result you can imagine the frequency of my visits. The restaurant is a huge crowd puller due to its exemplary food quality and value for money. The restaurant specialises in Chinese food. Their Classic Mixed Fried Rice has the ability to oblige the taste buds of any person who is equally in love with chinese food as I am. The chicken preparations namely chilli chicken, garlic chicken have a special touch of quality, which is a signature of this young restaurant. The snacks available here also have put smiles on the customer's faces. With a variety of items to choose from, a quality which can hardly have any competition and value for money - Choc'n'Cheese does a rocking job as a venture which is in its starting years.

I sometimes have food from here even though i havent visited it yet.Prompt delivery,we ordered fish and chips and drums of heaven.Firstly fish and chips was very tasty specially the fish had a homely taste which i liked very much plus the sauce they provide is yummy.Drums of heaven has a sweet taste and my tastebuds where more than satisfied.I would say that i was deeply satisfied with the chicken preperations specially chilli chicken and the chicken chowmein is just fabulous has a smoky flavour.For me the fried rice only didnt suit to my palate rest was good.But i would say its a good budget restaurant providing adequate portions for the money charged.

Definitely a place to be if you live near Gorabazar and Subhas Nagar area... 
The best thing about this eatery is that the food is excellent and reasonable for all... 
I have been here with my friends and we ordered Fried Rice and Chili Chicken. They were quite good!
Later I tried some of their Chinese snacks which I really loved a lot!
This place wins over our hearts with the food quality, its quantity and price.
Most importantly no extra VAT is been charged which is quite awesome!
You must try some of the authentic Chinese dishes which are lip-smacking! 

So it’s a nice small and sweet restaurant with good food in a quite a reasonable price. 
Choc N Cheese is just the perfect place for a pocket friendly meal, especially for students.

This area was badly needed of a food joint which can be call a Restaurant in true manner. And when it gets one it gets 200% of it.

Choc N Cheese a really really great place in all aspect, be it the ambiance, the service, hygiene, value for money, but above all The Food which tastes out standing. Tried drumstick chicken, mixed Hakka noodles and chilly chicken and all were lips smacking.

Good luck Choc N Cheese. See you soon.

Its a sweet 12-seater restaurant where the food is fresh and tastes great! The price are low too,you get fried-rice,chilli-chicken and regular coke for just rs. 99 inclusive of taxes! Also,you get a chicken sandwitch,french-fries and a coke at only rs. 49! The chicken down south, a rendition of the famous chicken-65,is really delicious! Its airconditioned and the decors are trendy and funky. So,for good food,music at a very low price,come and help yourself to chok n cheese!
