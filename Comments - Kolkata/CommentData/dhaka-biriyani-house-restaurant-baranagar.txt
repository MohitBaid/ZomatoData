Biryani is something that I love the most in the whole world so when I'm tasting a biryani which is below average that annoys me a bit. The food quality here is very very bad.

Ithe biriyani is ok. The ambience is really bad. Service is ok. The quality and price of menus are not too special. The quantity of food is good.

One of the best place in Dunlop for biriyani lovers. Sympotous amount and good taste is the advantage of the restaurant. Nothing special about the ambiance. Non ac
 Nice one. Must try
