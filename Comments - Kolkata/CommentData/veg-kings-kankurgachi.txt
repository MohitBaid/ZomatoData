This is a tiny outlet near kankurgachhi. As the name goes it is a pure very outlet.
Had ordered from them only once. The order was of Maggi and hot n sour soup.

The packaging was good as there was no leakage. The maggi was very basic and therefore there are no complaints nor is there anything to praise.
The hot n sour soup was pretty good nice and spicy.

Surely will order soup from them again and will try other items as well. Keep up the good work.

If you're looking for a pocket friendly Veg Restaurant, Veg Kings is the place. The quality as well as the quantity of food is great. I've ordered thrice and never got disappointed. Moreover, they deliver the food in time. Recommended for Home Delivery! :)

Foods quality is good. Not properly hygienic but ok. Its good to take away. Dine in not available. Mid range  prices. Takes too many times and many things not available in menu.

The food is really good and so is the Service. Also, the staff is friendly.
They mostly have take aways. If at all they come up with a proper dine-in people will love it just like I loved with my delivery!

Awful service. Unskilled delivery persons. Food quality and quantity both pathetic. Should be blacklisted. Delivery was delayed by half an hour and had to guide the delivery person at every roads and turns and the guy had some attitude. Not apologetic at all.
