I was invited to my cousin's place and they had got mutton biriyani from place which has been a completely new place for me to try out from. The quantity was quite reasonable and the taste was also fine.

Its a pretty new restaurant close to Arsalan (Ruby), I have been here 3/4 times and only thing I have ordered is Chicken Thali which is tasty and quantity of food is also sufficient. They also serve Biriyani and other Chinese items which I am yet to taste. This restaurant is a good option for those prefer thali's. Also, the price of the food items are on the lower side so lo budget wont be any issue.
