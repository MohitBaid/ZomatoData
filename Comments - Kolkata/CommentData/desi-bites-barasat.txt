If i had anything from here, it's :
1. Drums of heaven- Didn't relish it at all. The chicken was half cooked inside . The spices were also not blended well.
2. Chicken Biriyani- It was just too worse. The chicken pieces were not succulent. The rice, fat and short, lacked the quality which brought down the taste of the biriyani.
3. Mixed fried rice- Despite putting in eggs, prawns, mixed veggies, and chicken pieces, it lacked flavor and quality.
4. Kadai chicken- This was good. A lot of spices in it and cooked well makes it worth tasting.
And also, the service needs to improve a hell lot.
One point for their name and the other point for their location ( located on one of the busiest roads of barasat) fetches them 2 points.

The food is good. The service and the delivery is quick. Really liked paneer Akbar sand chilly mushrooms. Ordered for home delivery and portion size was sufficient. Veg Biryni was ok

i have been eating from this shop for quite some time now....this particular outlet in barasat is located near station. they have an extensive menu which is highly appreciable. because in barasat there is hard to get such a good restaurant like this and the price is reasonable. Though the place is not too huge but i liked the ambience also the service is wonderful. i have tried the scezwan noodles, Hawaiian fried rice, scezwan chicken, mutton and chicken biriyani and mutton kosha here. i recently tried mutton kosha here and it was well cooked. mutton was soft and tender and the curry was spicy, well seasoned, super tasty. lastly i would like to recommend this to every foodie. I'd love to visit this place again.

Value for money...
Some dishes are too good ...
Try fried icecream, sizzlers..and most importantly their combo meals...
Service is good..
Ambience could be little better..
Cleaniness and hygeine also good..
Ideal place for casual dine-out...

Ordered a few items from this restaurant today and we weren't disappointed at all.
We ordered veg momo, veg Singapore fried rice and veg hakka noodles from their online menu. They called up to say that veg momo wasn't available and suggested half plate of butter paneer masala which wouldn't add any extra amount to the total payable amount. We agreed and wow! They were at the door in less than 40 min.

The portions were enough for two people. We liked the neat packaging and their delivery person was really courteous. Moreover, there was no delivery/packaging charge and we got 10% off on Zomato! When you get food with benefits, there isn't much to complain about. 👍

Tastewise, nothing extraordinary. The hakka noodles was simply 'chow mein'. Tasted good anyway. The Singapore rice didn't have anything to do with Singapore, just our regular fried rice. We didn't expect too much, so it was a relief to find everything properly cooked with minimal chillies ( we added a note to add less chillies while ordering ). The butter paneer was just right. Soft, juicy and with a sauce to compliment the pulao.

Pocket pinch for us-
Veg hakka noodles- INR 60
Veg Singapore fried rice- INR 80
Paneer butter masala(half plate)- INR 70
Total- INR 216 after 10% discount. No extra charges.
.
.
-----Edit-----
On our next order, we ordered a veg biryani and chilli paneer. The veg biryani was totally yum, with a huge chunk of paneer cooked in spices, potatoes and chopped veggies. The chilli paneer was spicy, soft and succulent. Cannot expect too much from such a eatery and we rarely get a meal for two delivered at the door at such a cheap price. Moreover, the lightning fast delivery and excellent behavior of the staff made our meal better.

Pocket pinch-
Veg biryani- 100
Chilli paneer- 120
Festive discount- 10% and free delivery
Total- 198

Absolutely rubbish... The taste of the biriyani is pathetic. The mutton piece is pathetic and tasteless. Chiken chap is also very bad and like rubber. But crispy chiken is so so.

Third Class dishes with very bad taste. Don't go there to eat. Every dish is overcharged and I have nothing to say anymore.
I ordered a Kashmiri Pulao and you guess, I am so angry that I don't want to talk about this restaurant any more. I had to throw the pulao in the bin without thinking further. Very bad. Very very bad.

Disgusting food and people with equally disgusting manners. Inability to take criticism results in their insulting someone just because they had the right mind to criticize their food on zomato.

Tried out lamb for the first time here and undoubtedly it was big mistake of my life..Ordered schezwan lamb for take away but before that have to call more than three times as the staff could not remember..They packed the food in an opaque polythene packet which was far from decent..The dish looked gruesome and disgusting as everything was floating in what looks like a red pool of repulsive looking gravy with seeds of tomato scattered all over it..Literally had to do a thorough search for the lamb pieces by putting fingers inside the gravy..The taste of the dish,may god have mercy less said the better.

For those who think chicken biriyani is not delicious—suggest them to try the Desi Bites. I have tried different restaurants but they were not upto the mark. The price is quite ok. The dish is very well prepared and awesome in taste. The chicken amount is huge- actually beyond expectation. The rice quality and quantity is well and good. Of course dont forget the egg :). They delivered the food on time and it was very hot. My rating 4 out of 5.

Good service, good ambience and prime location - these are the key factors in play. The service is quick. Prices are moderate but sort of higher-ish. The biriyani and other stuffs are delicious although I guess the chicken bharta is a bit confusing. But still, if you're visiting Barasat station related areas, take a chance with it ....You'll love it.
