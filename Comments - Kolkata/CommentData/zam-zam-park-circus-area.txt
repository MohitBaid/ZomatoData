Outright one of the best places for a beef and biryani lover. Biryani is one of the best I've tasted and other beef items are surely to be tasted. Firni is another item which is to be vouched for, not too sweet but just perfect. Ambiance is nice and cozy though it is a bit interior. But nonetheless a must visit from my end.
P.S. Try out their beef malai. It's really yummy!!!

One fine summer afternoon i visited this place with one of my friend..the outlet is very small and the ambience is not that good..but the biriyani was really good..
We ordered beef biriyani, beef malai, beef Kashmira and ghol.
Though beef of biriyani was little hard but beef malai was absolute bliss..i will recommend you trying beef malai if you ever visit this place.. 
The ghol helps you to digest the food..
The staffs are well behaved and the service is really fast..
I can guarantee you..that you will not find such good food in such affordable price

Ambience is average. Gives you the feel of typical Muslim middle class restaurants, but it is also kind of nice. 
Beef malai and Biryani are a must. Especially the meat in Biryani is very tender and this makes the Biryani much better than those available in Zakaria streets. 
Service is OK.

Had Biriyani and beef bhuna from Zam Zam. Yesterday. Though the Biriyani was super good but I have had better. The beef pieces were soft and very good. The beef bhuna lives were a bit tough but tasty nonetheless. Too oily though. The phirni was different and good.

This biryani joint is just five minutes walking distance from my place..but it would be difficult to locate this place for the first timers.. But its worth all the struggle of locating it.. This is hands-down the best biryani joint in the city.. Iv been having  biryani from here evry now and then ever since i was a kid ..they serve beef mutton n chicken biryani out of which beef biryani is their trademark.. And the best part is they even serve ghol.. What better than this for a food lover.. And end ur meal with firni.. And ur sorted.
P. S..  On fridays they serve khichda biryani which is equally  good..

Located near Frank Anthony Public School. This place is famous for its biryani. It is a small restaurant. Its better to takeaway rather eat over their. They serve 3 kinds of biryani,i.e the beef biryani, mutton biryani & chicken biryani. They even serve other dishes. But their biryani is a true bliss. Overall the food is very good. The 5star is only for the food.

If you are a Biriyani lover and Beef lover, and still you have not visited this place, then its next to a crime. 
This is small joint is the best biriyani joint in town period. 
The meat is so tenderly cooked that it will melt in your mouth. 
One of the must is their Burhani (ghol)... You wont get the same anywhere in Kolkata. They also serve a special khichda, but thats only on Fridays.

Recommendation:
1. Beef Biriyani
2. Beef Bhuna
3. Beef Malai
4. Khichda (only fridays)
5. Burhani (ghol)

When one of my friend suggested Zam Zam, I was like totally in a puzzle because I had never heard the name before. Who knew that hidden in park circus there is a heaven for Beef lovers. Loved every food they served From Biriyani,Bhuna,Beef malai, Tandoori Roti to the Firni. Beef malai is a must try for everyone. 

P.s It costed ₹450 for 3 People and we tried like 5 different items, so I'll leave the​ calculation to you guys, Happy Hunting ;)

Hands down the best beef biryani in the city. The rice was fluffy, moist, flavourful and has the correct amount of essence that soothes your pallate. The only thing which I found was that the aloo of the biryani was a bit under seasoned and had extra colour. Unfortunately when we went the beef bhuna was unavailable. The beef kashmira was also very delicious but had an insane amount of fat floating on the gravy. Their price has also increased. Beef biryani now costs Rs85 instead of Rs70. Nothing fancy in terms of decor, it's kind of a small eatery. But who cares when the food is awesome.right?

When it comes about Kolkata, you can expect surprise from anywhere. Where the big brands like Arsalan, Aminia etc are ruling the chain of Biriyani, Zam Zam just came with a bang and simply just everyone. 

The Restaurant is about 10 min walk from Entally Market bus Stop, due to the surrounding ambiance, I’ll suggest you to take the lane next to St. James Church. Just 5min walk from the main road.

Went there few days ago with my friends, to try their legendary Beef Biryani & other Beef items. When we reached there, it was almost 7:30PM but restaurant was pretty empty.

We ordered –

	Beef Biryani – Aha, what a smell came out from the biryani. Aroma really impressed all of us, quantity was somehow less for one person but quality wise it was 5 out of 5. The rice came with a big piece of beef piece, one big aloo. The beef piece simply just melt into my mouth. Aloo was also well steamed and good in taste.

	Beef Kashmira – 2 big pieces of beef came with oily spicy gravy. Beef pieces were too tender and soft. The item goes perfectly with the biryani. Love it and full recommended it for everyone.

	Beef Bhuna – This one is the most ordered item here. 4 pieces of mid sized beef pieces came with more spicy gravy. Oil portion was less than Kashmira but the spiciness was greater than it. It goes excellent with biryani & also will go perfect with any kind of roti.

	Beef Malai – As we want to try something different than any spicy beef side item, we ordered this one. The item was lite in taste but oily in nature. 3 pieces of midsized beef pieces were there & the malai touch make the dish little creamy. The item doesn’t go well with biryani but surely will go excellent with masala kulcha etc.

	Salad – Nothing special, just some fresh cut cucumber, onion, tomato & beetroot with sprinkle of pepper of top.

	Ghol – Just like traditional burhani, nothing extraordinary. But quality was good & pricewise very cheap also.

	Firni – OMGGGGG! This was something, which really blows our mind. So tasty it was & the kasar touch really impressed me a lot. Love it.

Overall it was really a great dining experiences from our side. The place is really a hidden gems for all beef lover. Pocket pinch was not too high but the quality of the food was too good. Will surely visit again.

Location- Located at Noor Ali Avenue inside park circus , please refer to your navigation device properly if you want to reach the place directly without any deviation (There are high chances you are going to get confused reaching this place)

Ambiance- This is a small restaurant with a seating capacity of 25(approx) people with very basic interior. But their beauty is in their food and obviously not in their ambiance.

Food Ordered- Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Chap, Chicken Kashmira, Beef Biriyani

Food quantity and Quality- They offer decent quantity on their food.
Biriyani are supposed to be oily ,so I won't complain saying their biriyani is oily but instead I would say I've loved every bit of it. Here Biriyanis are extremely well cooked and I will keep their biriyani in Kolkata's top 5 biriyani centers.

Chicken Chap is highly recommended
Chicken Kashmira was also well cooked

Staffs- Well behaved and professional
Service-Extremely fast
Other feedback- Take your time and visit this place as you may need to stand in the queue for your turn.
Do not consider any fancy stuffs, just concentrate on their food and you will not be disappointed

This is a joint known for its famous Beef biryani...Its a good 30 seater normal restaurant, no special ambiance as such....Its just about good food...Price and quantity wise its also quite economical as far as Biryanis are concerned...Service is super fast and served hot. You can also try their side dishes like malai beef and beef kashmira which tastes yummy !!

If you haven't tasted the Biriyani here, then you have missed a large chunk of something good in life! And I am not kidding. This is our ultimate Go To place when we crave Biriyani. The perfect long grains of rice.. the tender, juicy, perfectly done meat pieces.. the soft perfectly cooked aalu(potatoes).. the aroma.. along with a glass of ghol (buttermilk/chhaanch).. it's Heavenly!! It Your taste buds will burst with delight, trust me. Even the firni is awesome. The other dishes in the menu are pretty average, but 5 Stars only for their Biriyani!! A must try for foodies out there.

This is truly a hidden gem. The Biriyani there is one of the best in town, and if you consider the value for money, surely the best in town. The beef biriyani I ordered there came with two good sized pieces of meat, and the most melt-in-mouth piece of aloo I ever had. The 4 star is only because of the beef kashmira, which was okayish, mostly because the piece of beef was not tender. Wanted to order beef malai, but was not available when I visited. Have to taste it and their famous ghol when I visit next time.

Truly one of the hidden gems of Kolkata and if you are looking to have tender juicy beef this is the place you visit. Being a foodie am not to much fussy about the ambience. We ordered "beef biriyani" "mutton biriyani" "beef bhuna" "beef malai" and sat for like just 5mins and our food arrived! The biriyani was nothing different but the beef stole the show. Moist , soft and tasty chunk of beef made our day. And the "bhuna" was just mindblowing. At the end we ordered "firni" which was just a perfect ending to the feast. A great experience and a must visit for beef lovers!@

Finally I have tasted the 'ZAM ZAM' Biryani. After so many good things that I have heard about this place, I was eager to taste this cuisine. Biryani was a bit too oily and quality and quantity were both not up to mark. So, for me 'ZAM ZAM'  was not that 'YUM YUM'. But, I am looking forward to taste other cuisines to judge this place properly.

This is the place where you get the best biryani for the cheapest price. Awesome food, lightning-fast service, good quantity and grate quality. The malai beef and the firni is just out of the world, the ghool is also good to taste. Biryani, malai beef, ghool and firni are must try item here. 
The place is not well decorated but for a true food lover, the decorations of the place doesn't matter at all. One will never think about the decoration or anything else after having the fantastic food.

I haven’t been to the restaurant, but got the opportunity to taste its food when a colleague of mine ordered Mutton Special Biryani to our workplace. All of us there were unanimous in our opinion that the biryani was indeed lip-smacking! It is also far more economically priced compared to the other much-touted Biryani joints in the Park Circus locality. A big thumbs up to Zam Zam!!

I had a chance to try their biryani at the ongoing 'biryani-and-kebab' festival(06/12-08/12) at ecospace and what a pleasant surprise this experience has been!

The MUTTON BIRYANI (4.5/5) definitely sits at the top along with the other biryanis you get at more famous biryani giants.
✔Long-grained,fragnant rice.
✔The most melt-in-the-mouth piece of potato I've ever had in a biryani.
✔Huge chunk of meat that fell apart at the touch of my spoon.
✔ Enormous quantity.

The biryani could have been a bit less greasy and the meat was a tad too salty.

PHIRNI(5/5)-My favourite Indian dessert and they did a marvelous job at getting both the flavour and texture spot on.💖

The food was very reasonable and value for money.

Frankly,I can't wait to try their beef biryani and beef bhuna.

Both chicken and Mutton Biryani.
But the cheap price doesn't mean that the quality is bad.

The Aloo is tasty nd the meat that they give both chicken and mutton are well cooked and soft.

Big and succulent meat portions, one big tempting Aloo and the nicely boiled egg are the basic foundations of Kolkata biryani... Add to that the aromatic and finely cooked rice... Zam Zam scores big on these counts... Have had their Biryani twice through delivery channels only and was fully satisfied on both occasions both on count of the quantity and quality... Their Beef Biryani (this is Kolkata and everything sells) and Mutton Biryani are brilliant... I am yet to try their Chicken Biryani or side dishes though... Would recommend Zam Zam for the signature Kolkata Biryani flavour to all foodies out there...

The Biriyani is definitely very different from what we get elsewhere. It has got a slightly wet texture which makes it extremely pleasing to eat. The Chicken in their Biriyani is well cooked and soft. The potato is delicious, probably the best among "Biriyani" potato category in the city. The staff are really friendly and helpful as well. But all said, I personally feel it's not a ideal place to take your female friend out for lunch or dinner especially if it's just you both. It may get slightly uncomfortable. Definitely a must visit among Biriyani lovers.

P.S :- Ask around for directions because chances are you may get lost if you are on your maiden visit.

Zam Zam is a hidden gem in Kolkata,well...literally.If you are on your maiden visit then you must take help of the Google Maps to reach here through the meandering chaotic lanes.There is no AC,no e-payment option,no fancy seating arrangement,no hip crowd.You may have to share the table with another group who prefers to eat with their hands instead of spoon-fork & all.But they have smiling waiters,lightening fast service and great food to iron out all other creases.It is mainly famous for its top class beef preparations and boy,you have to taste it to believe it!The beef chunk in the biriyani just melted into the mouth.Accompanied with creamy Beef malai & tangy Beef kashmira it was a superb gastronomic journey.We signed off with Firni and the whole set came at an astoundingly cool budget.Brave the obstacles to live the Zam Zam experience.Satisfaction guaranteed!

This was in my bucket list for a long time so decided to visit. It was very difficult to find as it is inside many bylanes. Thanks to my smartphone and Google maps. It is a very small joint with maybe capacity of about 30 people. The place had basic decor nothing fancy. I ordered a chicken biryani, mutton biryani and chicken kashmira. I was there for a takeaway. The biryani was very tasty with a perfect blend of spices. It was not oily at all but really tasty as I had expected. The chicken side dish was average. It had too much oil with gravy. Altogether I had a really nice dinner.

Don’t ever go with ambience- just concentrate on food- only and only food.
Trust me you won’t regret ever- biriyani too good, a perfectly cooked meat and a great balance of herbs and spices 🙏🏻👍🏻👍🏻

Must try their burani along with food and firni as sweet tooth. You enjoy a great meal at great price- and really a haven like feel.😊

One of the best Biryanis in town. Sufficient quantity, good taste and most of all its pocket friendly. One side dish is enough for 2 as its quite rich. We had 3 Mutton Biryani, 1 Chicken Kashmiri, 1 Chicken Kasa and 3 Firni. The total bill for 3 of us were around Rs. 635 including GST. Finding the place is a big issue as its located quite interior of the park circus area. It took almost an hour for us to reach. 

Do not follow the directions given by Google maps. The marker of the restaurant is placed wrong. Instead, look for Frank Anthony School from the maps and reach there, then ask any local people and they will show you the path.

Zamzam is not a fancy eatery but its popularity with those who like to partake of beef is quite legendary. I have to say that overall both the quality and taste of the biryani are pretty good and the value for money excellent. The rice is of good quality and the meat and potato perfectly cooked. The Beef Malai and Beef Bhuna are the two other stars on the Menu and worth ordering. Never eaten the chicken or mutton dishes so can' comment on them.

Been here today. This place is inside a lane lill hard to locate. Ambience is chaotic & congested. We had Mutton Biriyani, chicken masala, beef vuna & beef malai. Biriyani was undoubtedly good with perfectly cooked potato & Mutton but I've doubt if this was enough to take a place among top 10 Biriyani joints of city. Chicken masala was good beef vuna was mild in test & less spicy. Beef malai was sweet more than natural. All the dishes specially Biriyani was ttoooo oily so if you are health conscious this place isn't for you 😔

3.5 stars to Zam Zam for the best quality beef which they offer in their beef biriyani platter. The quantity is sufficient at such cheap price. But due to lack of AC facility and proper hygenic grounds I'll rate it 3.5.

Another name ticked on the culinary wishlist. It has been a longtime recommendation from friend Indrajit Lahiri as the best beef biryani in town and now I know why. It was a late lunch so I ordered only a plate of beef biryani.

The balanced play of the spices and the tender, fatty, rightly done meat made it lipsmacking (I got two mid-sized boneless pieces. Yay!). And though I am no more a fan of the potato in Kolkata biryani, I gave in to the masterly seduction of the flawlessly dum-cooked piece of potato. It drove home the point of Kolkatans' obsession for potato in their biryani. I wish I could shoot the potato ☺.

I shall definitely come back for another recommendation- Beef Malai, and of course, biryani.

Zam Zam- A Name of Purity, probably the best place to have beef in the city. Even I was introduced to beef for the first time here at Zam Zam. The Park Circus outlet of Zam Zam, lies at Noor Ali Avenue and it's quite difficult to locate for the first time goers. But the lip smacking dishes at dirt cheap prices are more than enough to make you forget all the troubles you gonna have for the first time to locate this hidden paradise.

So after a lot of thinking, I have finally decided to review the restaurants on Zomato, primarily because I think it's time I should start sharing the knowledge gained through my professional journey in Zomato. Hope I will be able to help the users choose the best.

So here goes my first review:

Sudden plan with friends to have biryani. Tired of eating at popular outlets, we decided to eat at Zam Zam. With a little struggle we managed to get a table for four and within minutes hot steaming biryani was in front of us. The restaurant is popular mostly for is beef biryani, but here we had ordered chicken biryani.

Loved the taste. The fact that Biryani was served really hot, made a huge difference. I guess this an important factor behind their popularity. The chicken that comes with the biryani, could have been kept bigger but I shouldn't complain considering the cheap pricing. 

On the downside I think the restaurant needs to pay a little attention towards the cleanliness. 

Overall a tasty experience. After having biryani in almost all the small and big brands in kolkata, I can easily say this is a highly underrated biryani outlet 'in terms of taste'. Not sure if I will visit the outlet again to sit and eat, but am definitely ordering again from this outlet.

Thanks :)

Location : The nearest bus stop to this place is Paddapukur. Now don't get confused because there are almost 4-5 bus stops named Paddapukur in Kolkata. This bus stand is specifically called CIT Road Paddapukur. After reaching there you have to walk approximately 7 minutes towards few lanes.

Exterior, Interior & Ambience : From the front (outside) it looks nothing exciting. Kinda simple restaurant you often found beside town roads.
From the inside it's not exciting as well. It's not air conditioned. Simple, warm(really warm), regular structures & I found the chairs aren't that bad in looks, very ordinary but I don't know why after visiting almost 4 times still I don't find those chairs comfortable to sit while you're eating.
Ambience umm... nothing! I'd say bad. Very crowded and ordinary.

Service : Like regular restaurants. One of few service men will come to you for order. You have to ask them the menu if you don't know. They'll tell you and will take the order and will provide you your food. Decent.

Food : I went there multiple times. The best thing here is their Biryani. It's one of the most affordable in price in Kolkata. Chicken Biryani is nice, Mutton Biryani is better, Aloo Biryani is like umm... Well like aloo Biryani but Beef Biryani man oh man! You have to try the beef biryani if you visit there! Just outstanding! One of the best I've ever tasted! The taste, the aroma, the flavour !!! Just delicious! And there are also bhuna recipies and kashmiri recipies of different meats but another recommendation of mine would be the Beef Malai(Strongly recommended). I mean you cannot get enough of it, buttery, a bit sweet, creamy, rich! Outstanding!

Concluded Verdict : Though this place doesn't look and even doesn't feel while sitting there like a very nice place but you cannot imagine how good it really tastes in terms of food while looking at them. I never expected this place to produce some extra ordinary Biryani like this. The rating I'm giving is completely over the food. It has nothing in terms of looks and ambience but the food specially that Biryani and that beef malai pulls it all off! And the price! You cannot believe the prices unless you see prices! Prices have increased a bit due to their daily demand but still it's one of the most affordable.

Behind Frank Anthony School easy to find as most of knows this school. 

I have been eating from my school days at that time it was famous into his locality may I am wrong. 
Well I am talking the year 2007. 
For me best beef biriyani in town at that time. 

Years passed still the aroma and taste never change. 
Quantity and price may differ but they kept the main thing intact. At that time we use to outside to get you table around 11pm so how popular was.. 


They serve chicken,  mutton too. 

Best part after having rich biriyani you can get ghol to digest. 

Adios

If you like your Biryani to be oily, greasy, aromatic & flavourful, Zam Zam's the place to be.
They are renowned for their Beef Biryani & Beef Malai. One must have them to relish them.
The picture however is of the Mutton Biryani which I had ordered from them. The meat was soft & sizeable and the rice just the way I described above.
Do give it a try!

Therefore ” ZAM ZAM ” may still be in your bookmark list, hidden in solitary while you are busy in exploring the new joints glorifying what already exists somewhere in an old world charm.

Visited this place a few weeks back with a couple of friends. This place was truly a hidden gem as it is located within the by lanes of Park Circus Area. Although there were a couple of hiccups along the way, but upon reaching, there was a sense of relief. The order consisted of a couple of beef biryanis, beef bhuna, beef malai, mutton masala. After ordering all of this, I can only say that it was a real pleasure to have such great food at such a convenient pricing. The beef biryani was not oily and had the perfect amount of spices to make it taste good. the gravy accompaniments were all quite great to have with the biryani especially the bhuna. And the best part of dining was the ghol that really helped us in digesting the food and was a real saviour to avoid any kind of stomach ache. Another surprise, and probably the best thing that we experienced was the Phirni made by them. By far the best Phirni i had ever had in my life. There was simply no words for that, as it did not consist of any additional sweetness and was totally made to utmost perfection. It was so indulging that our entire group of 6 had ordered another round of Phirni to completely satisfy ourselves. This was a great experience of food and more than that, uncovering these small gems that make this city so great in terms of the food culture.

It's is true that the place is a little difficult to find but trust me the effort is worth taking. The place may not excite you much but the food is real good. Tasted both mutton and beef biriyani along with beef malai kebab and was amazed at the taste. The juicy meat pieces coupled with the tasteful biriyani and the alu, it's real great. Would love to go there again. The green ghol is also awesome. If you want good food at reasonable price, this is the place to be.

As had been suggested by food-purists throughout Kolkata and indeed said true, the best place to enjoy beef at the lowest price. 

I have tried Nafeel and Zam Zam is much much better. If you have saved a good appetite after beef biryani, which is an essential must if you go in here, please order beef malai with roti. You will experience the best dish to have with any kind of bread at just 50 rupees. That sweet malai over the nicely cooked beef,  pure bliss. And the biryani is just too good, the best in the town. 

After this whole process, order firni. Take a spoon, cover it half with the firni, put into your mouth and leave it there for a few seconds. This is a ticket to heaven. Period.

One of the best beef restaurants on paper in Kolkata . Especially known for its beef biryani and beef Malai . I ordered a plate of beef biryani and beef bhuna. Tastes good with great service , fulfils a gratifying pleasure to your stomach. Rated 4 star just because of the location and slightly crowed . Anyway if you are short on cash and looking for a budget restaurant go for it . It will surely worth every penny.

A small joint located in the lanes of Entally Market. But do not let the look of the place deceive you. This place serves the best beef biryani in town. I ordered beef biryani and chicken chaap for my meal. The quantity is good. A person with a small appetite will not be able to complete the entire plate. They give 2 pieces of tender succulent beef and 1 potato. The quality of rice is great. The food is not too spicy and oily. But 1 full plate of biryani is enough to suffice your hunger. The Chicken chaap has a nice blend of spices and the pieces are juicy and tender. It has a thick layer of 'rogan' (the masala oil). After such a heavy meal one feels the craving for sweet. This place even serves Firni which is delicious. Rich, creamy firni puts a smile on one's face.
The place does not have a good seating arrangement. The food should be parcelled. The ambience is not exactly bad but it does not have air conditioner so one might feel hot and sweaty. So it is advisable to pack the food and carry it home.

Probably the best biryani one could get in town. I just love the biryani here. The taste the aroma😘😘.. just perfect. The chicken is always so well cooked. The best part is the quality is always the excellent.

Today I parcel mutton Kashmiri with tandoori roti as naan was not available. It was not spicy as I was told. It was equally good. It was very rich. I enjoyed my dinner.

The firni here is icing on top. 

Suggestion: should have some decent dine-in sitting area...

If you are low on budget and looking for some delicious Biriyani in town, Zam Zam is the place. The location is of bit, but once you reach there you may need to wait in que as the place is so popular for its biriyani.
I had their Mutton Biriyani. Sufficient in quantity and with a big piece of Mutton the Biriyani was fantastic. The only thing I would like to point out is, it would have been brilliant if it was less oily. Too much oily.
The place also serves beef and their Beef Bhuna is very good.
The Chicken Kashmiri we took as side was average. In thick yellow gravy a spicy dish. Didn't like it much.
And at the end the Firni made the lunch all more special. The firni was very good in taste.
The place is worth visiting.
Their Mutton and chicken Biriyani both are worth having.

Rightly being said "The Mecca of Biriyani"!

1. The Beef Biriyani (price: 70 INR) was out of the world! The quantity and taste makes it worth finding the place.

2. But the star item is the Beef Malai! Such tender beef in cashew and malai.. a heavenly soothing dish which makes it a must try! (Price: 50 INR, 2 pcs meat)
3. Firni wasn't upto the mark.

Taste: 5/5
Quantity: Too Sufficient.
Price: savagely cheap!

This place bursts all the wrong myths about beef. The beef melts and vanishes as soon as it is put in mouth! Too tender and delicious.

Though the ambience has nothing much to offer, but it is certainly a hidden gem for the food lovers! Tirtha Bal

Went there for tandoori roti and the famous Beef Malai. I must say it is worth all the hype. The beef was so tender! Melts in the mouth. 
The gravy that goes with it is a winner as well.
Full marks for the service which was lightning fast.
Eagerly waiting to visit this inexpensive hidden gem again for their Biriyani!

Visited with a friend of mine. Located in a small lane at Ripon Street. Great staff. Very polite and friendly. The place is small and non-AC. Ordered biriyani which was piping hot and delicious. The meat comes in small boneless cubes and it just melted in my mouth. Then came firni which was lovely. Very pocket friendly and prompt service. Loved the experience and the food.

it is a little hard to locate if you are not a local. located between cit road and ajc bose road, this mughlai joint is famous for its beef preparations. we planned on a bad day and the area was completely waterlogged. that made our experience kind of salty. anyway, coming to the food, the service was prompt. we ordered beef biriyani, beef kashmira and beef malai. the biriyani was very light and i felt i could eat a plate more. the beef pieces were very tender except the beef kashmira. the beef malai was delicious unlike the beef kashmira, in which the pieces were chunky and hard to chew even.the firni was heavenly.if you are a central kolkatan or live nearby, it's a must go if you are a beef eater.

This is lovingly called as the mecca of Beef Biryani by the connoisseurs of the city. Zam zam lies in between the Park circus and AJC Bose Road, technically Noor Ali Avenue. The lane opposite to the Missionaries OF Charity mother’s house, leads to this place. The google location can be found here.  I’d suggest not to take car here as the parking might be a bit tough. It’s placed in a quaint semi-residential area and surprisingly, is full almost throughout the day. There is not fancy decor as such, but then when did a master need those ornamental add-ons ?

They’ll expect you to know what you’re going to order and without even looking at the menu card, ask for their beef biryani and one plate of beef malai with roti (off course to be divided between two of you). You won’t find the standard smell of beef in this biryani but long, ghee soaked rice and soft meet will take you to another level and the beef malai (with actual malai being floated on top) will help you stay there. One of my friends once, ordered chicken champ there (sometimes, satan gets on normal people). The waiter froze for 2 seconds hearing that and what came on table, was nothing less that a disaster. Stick to these 2 items mentioned above and you’ll be happy. And once you’re over, order for their malai (and whisper to the waiter to put sufficient sugar on top) and you’ll feel like conquering the world. The firni is pretty ordinary, or was it after that malai ?

Very rarely do I rate a restaurant with a 5. But I must say this place more than deserves it. I am an ardent foodie and I do not consider interior decorations and ambience to be deciding factors while rating a restaurant this cheap. Definitely for a fine dine restaurant, interiors and ambience is necessary but a restaurant like this and those chinese eateries near Central Metro station , quality of food , I believe, should be the only matter of concern.
Here's Zam Zam. Well it can be a little difficult to locate the place for newbies . Tucked away in a rather narrow lane off A.J.C Bose road near Mullickbazar. If you are coming from Sealdah, cross Moulali and keep an eye out to the left. A lane entrance with Mio amore on one side and Kathleen on the other is your mark. Enter the narrow lane and ask anyone , they will happily point the place out.
Once you have known how to reach, let me take you through the foodgasm. For devoted beef lovers in BJP times, this place is HEAVEN. Two of us ordered their beef biriyani (which comes with two chunks, rather boulders of beef by default) and asked for a suitable side dish to go with it. The guy there named three. I asked which will be the best with Biriyani. The guy smiled and replied " Teeno accha laagega.. ". Nevertheless we went for the beef kashmiri. Three beef pieces without a shred of bone and very minimal fat, awesomely soft...(yes soft cooked beef , no need to dream of that anymore ) playing around in a curdy gravy. Lipsmacking. Thats the word.
Rounded it all off with a khuri of one of the best firni i have ever had.
All of this cost us a mere 300 bucks. Believe it.
If there is anyone out here who had weeped in sorrow the day Nizam underwent a change of hands and stopped selling beef. This is the place to go brother/sister. Thank me later.
What more can I say? The biriyani ? Well... I dont know enough words to describe that. I think I have rightly said to my friend then and there. "This biriyani can only be second to OUDH 1590 ". And I still stand by that statement.
Well behaved and friendly waiters...  cheap... and food which takes you to food heaven...to sum up, thats it.

And as a regular customer as soon as we reach there they serve us with beef biriyani plate(with 3 extra potato), beef kashmira and salad. we love the biriyani and beef gravy there. Beefs are so tendy and soft inside. The ambience is not nice, its very cozy ,uncomfortable and people always coming in to get delivery. but its worth going there to get the best beef biriyani in kolkata.

The best place to have beef in Kolkata. I've tried quite a few places, but I think Zamzam gets everything spot-on, right from the juiciness to the texture to the amount of spice to the duration of slow-cooking the kebabs to the amount of oil.

We had parathas, kebabs and biriyani on several occasions here. All of them are really good.

I just hope they had another outlet somewhere that's easily accessible, on a wider street. This one's in such a remote neighborhood.

Never visited this place. But opted for ordering through swiggy for a couple of time. This place z very popular among the beef lovers!! 
During Ramadan they serve some delicious haleem items too. 
We ordered for chicken wing haleem n beef haleem. Both of them were relishing!! we ordered for mutton kasa, beef bhuna, beef malai korma for dinner. Mutton kasa was below average. But the beef items were awesome!! We loved their chicken biriyani too. If u r a beef lover, it z the perfect place for u, but the dishes other than beef may disappoint u...

Biriyani was great with a standard size chicken, an aloo and good portion of rice. The beef malai was awesome in taste. It had two pieces of beef with a little fat on top.  Since i was alone i could  not have much. Planning to bring food next time as it is very uncomfortable to dine there in this heat. Prices are very cheap. I am rating them 4.5 completely based on their food.

Today, two of my old achool buddies and I took tye risk of storms and rain to appease our stomach gods with the much appraised food of Zam Zam. We reached around quarter to six. But since it's Ramzan, they were busy shelling out parcels of food and told us that seating shall be available 7pm onwards. So we poitered around and came back after an hour. The prices are so low that one wonders whether it's all a joke. We took three beef biryanis, two beef malais and one beef bhuna and later, three firnis.
The beef biryani, by portion, is enough for one but I'd have liked to have more. It was a bit oily but that made it all the more delicious. It had the essential "aaloo" as well and the beef piece in it was truly soft and well cooked and tasted wonderful.
The beef malai comprises of two beef meat chunks with a dollop of beef fat on top and served with a gravy. It's unlike any beef dish I've ever had and truly it's the star dish of Zam Zam. It's sweet and also has a nutty flavour from the cashew nuts in the gravy and the meat was juicy and tender.
The beef bhuna is spicy and the quality of meat served is impeccable. It's served with a very thick gravy like the familiar "kosha maangsho" type of Bengal.
The firni has a peculiar brownish tinge and makes you expect it to be made of "gur". It has a very thick and creamy texture and was served cold. It's like an English Pudding with a texture of thickened ice cream. It's quite a treat to end the meal with.
Thus, Zam Zam is probably a new place on the rise in the Kolkata culinary circle. If they can hold their ground and improve further, they have a long way to go in enriching the Islamic food culture of Kolkata.

Being a foodie and an avid meat lover, I love to relish all kinds on meat delicacies..and this place actually upgraded my pallet interms tasty and delightful meat preparations. I will call this place for a real value for money, if you have 100 bucks, thats more than enough for a meal for one, it will be wazwan for you. I will rate this place as 4, but this place will get additional .5 rating from me because of its value for money pricing!!..

This restaurant is a hidden gem located at a busy lane at Park Circus area. I happened to pick up the special mutton biryani and burhani from here the other day for dinner. Initially I thought I would not be able to finish the biryani at one go because the quantity was too much for my TINY stomach 😝 but as I started savouring the taste of this heavenly item my tiny appetite turned into a Gargantuan shape and within minutes that plate full of biryani vanished. The burhani was equally delicious and helped me in hogging the biryani with much delight. The price point is absolutely reasonable for the tiny foodies like us. An absolute delightful experience is what I had eating Zamzam biryani that night.

The beef malai is out of the world thing that is served here. Being a beef item, it is quite cheap and is best tasted with tandoori roti. Biriyani is also nice. I am rating it 4 instead of 5 because of the ambience. Zam zam needs an AC immediately. During any season, the inside temperature remains quite elevated which leads to discomfort while eating.

This joint is a lovely one. But it is hard to find the location. If you are going from park circus 7 point dn you have to go gobra burial ground dn take a rickshaw. It will take 10 to 12 mnts by rickshaw. Now come to food. We ordered beef biriyani, beef kashmira, beef malai, beef kabab and paratha. All of these were sooo good and yummy. Parathas were crunchy and best part was beef malai. Beef were well cooked. They serve one of best biriyanis in kolkata I think. Stuffs were well behaved and helpful. Ambiance was not so good in comparison to the food. Prices are cheap. 
Overall a good experience it was.

Went to this place to satiate my beef cravings after a bottle of beer.
It is a tad bit hard to find this place even with the google map and gprs. You will the need the aid of google maps if you are not well veresed with that area.
Coming to the ambience,  it is fairly basic but very clean. Has good amount of lighting and the place looks bright and inviting. No AC. Prices are inclusive of tax and service is quick.
Coming to the food,
Laccha Paratha: the paratha was crisp and flaky. Served hot, it complements any side dish of that place. It had a yellowish hue and tasted very good.
Beef Malai: amazing dish. Sweet and savory, the beef pieces are simmered in milk cream and beef fat along with spices. Has a rich taste of malai. The beef pieces werw very tender. Absolutely mindblowing.
Beef kababs: standard seekh kababs. Marinated beef roasted over charcoal. Had a nice smoky taste. Good meat and texture was soft and not chewy.
Yet to try out the famous beef biryani and ghol and other beef side dishes.
A paradise for beef lovers and better than Nafeel.

Note:The price was changed from 1st of July 2017. Nearly the price of every dish increased by ₹10-20.

This is located at Park Circus but it is not on the main road so for the location you have to take help of Google map or to ask local people.

After seeing the price list you shouldn't expect a good ambience & AC.

If you are very tight on budget & you want an untarnished biryani then you should really go there once. At this price point it is one of my fav biryani centre.

You can order Chicken/Mutton/Beef biryani as per your choice but I tasted 3 of them. I'm not disappointed​ at all. But you can order the #doodh_malai & #beef_bhuna but try this with roti or paratha it's good.

Best Beef Biryani I've ever had. The quantity was good enough for 70 bucks. Among the side dishes I liked Beef kashmira over Beef bhuna.and last but not the least their firni( which was wonderful esp @ Rs 25). The place is a bit difficult to locate if you r visiting this place for the first time.  My mobile GPS proved to be very handy. Overall it was a pleasant experience for me and would certainly comeback for more.

One of the best biriyanis I've had in Kolkata. Their beef biriyani is in a league of its own, and on a good day can match the more famous biriyani destinations in the city. Biriyani is served with an aloo and two pieces of beef, but the meat was a bit dry for my liking. You can get extra aloo and even eggs for an extra price. 
Service is prompt and the staff are friendly. We tried the beef malai along with the biriyani and it turned out to be a very good choice. It's a sweet preparation of beef, having two succulent pieces and a thick creamy gravy. 
Along with these we had salad and ghol. The ghol deserves a special mention as it was unlike anything I had before. It's made with curd pudina and chillies, along with salt and some masala, and is perfect to wash down all that beef, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. 
Prices are so cheap that it's practically a steal. 
The only problems were the location and the space, both of which are more than made up for by the food. 
We left the place contented with a belly full of biriyani :) 
Will be going back very soon.

This old classic had always been on my list, and I was thrilled when I finally got the opportunity to visit.

Tucked away in the bylanes near Park Circus, it may be a bit tough to locate. Google Maps came to our rescue. The delicious aroma apparent from several metres away was a good omen of things to come. It's a small, bustling outlet, with a capacity of around 30 people. Ambience is nothing to write home about, but everything is clean and shining.

Service was surprisingly quick. It's a very busy place, with nearly as many (if not more) people collecting packed dishes as those sitting and eating. Accordingly, the items are being constantly prepared at a feverish pace. Our food was served almost immediately after we sat down and ordered.

Now coming to the reason why this place will be occupying my dreams for quite a while - the food. The place is renowned for its beef dishes at cheap prices, and how well it lived up to the hype! We were a group of 3, each with huge appetites, and we happily stuffed ourselves for less than 150 bucks per head. We ordered Beef Biryani, Beef Malai, Beef Kashmira and a few tandoori rotis. The biryani​ comes in heaped plates with a potato and two pieces of beef. The rice is light and delectably spiced, and the beef is soft and succulent. The beef kashmira is slightly spicy, and goes really well with the rotis. The Beef Malai, however, is the stuff that dreams are made of. There are no words to describe the experience. It was a veritable gustatory orgasm! We finished off with the phirni, which like everything else was a revelation.

It was a hugely satisfying experience. It is one of the few remaining places where you can gorge yourselves on great food without having to dig deep in your pocket. We'll definitely visit again.

We went to zam zam on a bright Saturday afternoon. The popular eatery was a bit difficult to locate but it wasn't a disappointment. We had heard about the beef delicacies here and was looking forward to a hearty meal. Upon arriving, we were greeted by an elderly gentleman at the reception. The afternoon rush was a bit intimidating but we were quickly accommodated in seats of 3.

What we ordered:
2 plate beef biriyani
3 pieces of tandoori roti
2 plate beef malai
2 plate beef kashmira
3 phirni

Ambience: The outlet is small, with a seating of approximately 30 people. The kitchen is attached with the seating area. There's always a constant rush of people, and it gets a bit chaotic with the people's loud voices. There's little space to walk around in between the tables. Other than that, there's always an enchanting smell of Mughal cuisine wafting from the kitchen which would definitely stimulate your appetite.

How they served: The outlet would never fall short of waiters. The service was definitely quicker than being prompt. It was instantaneous. They served under two minutes.

What we ate: The Beef Malai is a much acclaimed favourite. It totally blew us away with it's taste and aroma. They were generous with the portions and it came at reasonable price. Beef Kashmira was different in its appearance but certainly equally tasty. The biriyani was a hearty experience. Unlike any other biriyani anywhere else, it was very light without the usual heavy filling. Tandoori roti tasted good with the gravy. We finished off with Phirni which was perfect.

What we paid: We paid a total of 426 which was very reasonable for a pleasant afternoon meal.

Overall a beautiful experience and I would definitely visit again.

If you are a biriyani lover, you should visit this  place once.  Although they have a vast range of menu, but among them i used to order chicken biriyani & mutton biriyani. Ghol from  them  for sure. Yestarday i visited this place for dinner parcel. I had 2 chicken biriyani & ghol but due to my surprise i found it not upto the standard which i previously had. They need to keep an eye on their quality. Best of luck...

Well, once this was a regular joint during school days... They served awesome Biryani...however with the due course of time...The quality has depreciated...The staffs are on the rough side....Obviously, the pricing strategy like this seldom upholds premier treatments.....The Ghol is still a good bet along with Beef Malai....Not encouraged for family dinning as the tables are shared with strangers..Overall, an ideal joint when you are prepared for a rough journey with  limited pit stops....

In case you want to try beef then beef biriyani complimented with beef malai.
And also I must say they make awesome milk tea which is a must try!!

Big shoutout for this legendary place. Have been eating beef biryani from here when it only costed 20 bucks. Yes you read that right 20 bucks!!! The biryani is so lipsmaking that on some days i hogged down 2  portions alone straight. The only restaurant which considers the value of ghol(curd based beveage) which helps speed up digestion. The beef rolls are also fantabulous here. One can really experience the sheer mughlai feast here. Keep it up team Zam Zam.

This restaurant ia a bit hard to find if you haven't been to the Ripon street area. Being familiar to this area I tried this food joint on my friend's suggestion as one of the best places in Kolkata that sells Beef Biryani. And I was really delighted to have their biryani. The taste is really lip-smacking. Try out their ghol with the biryani. The ambience doesn't count much when the taste is so good.

We ordered Chicken Biryani with egg, Beef Biryani, Beef Kashmira, Chicken Masala, Ghol and Firni... 
Biryanis and both the side dishes were finger licking good. We washed all that down with Ghol and ended our meal with the firni.
Dirt cheap and good food. What more do you need?

To our sadness the Beef roll out of stock.  But the aroma and taste of Kolkata biryani with a potato in it. Reminds me of home cooked biryani by ma mom.  Just awesome.  That's y they won the times award for the best muglai category. All the products in this menu is mouth watering and shahi.  Food tried here. Obviously. Chicken biryani.  Beef bhuna.  Chicken chap.  And ghol.   Every dish is amazing. Loved it to the core.   A tiny place with a tornado of taste.   Great time here. All the very best.

This place has been in business for 16 years.. although not as old as the other places serving similar cuisine in Kolkata, the food here is quite good. I had the Beef Biryani and Beef Kashmira. I washed it down with what they call "Ghol", which is a Burhani, or a spicy curd based drink. The Biryani was full of flavour and a bit spicy, but not very heavy, and the beef pieces were soft. I loved the Biryani. The Beef Kashmira was also very good. And the Ghol truly hits the spot. This place is a definite must try.

A Kabab and Biriyani festival hosted at City Centre 1 helped me get a flavour of the North Indian dishes this place has to offer. I cannot comment on the appearance of the outlet, since my only interaction with this restaurant stays limited to the Biriyani and Firni I had ordered from this place. I wasn't aware of the festival going on, and happened to just chance upon it on my visit to the place. Naturally, I didn't have much cash to try out so many different items, and so went for the cheapest biriyani - that of ZamZam's. They were also offering Firni at a very low rate of Rs 40, and the quantity they were providing was quite a lot for the price. The biriyani was mediocre - not too much oil, I give them that, but it lacked the flavourful taste of Biriyani that am much used to. The Firni, however, was pretty good. Overall, the experience was nice, and I hope such festivals keep happening, so that we can get such delicacies, all at the same place! Also, I certainly hope to go to their main outlet, to try out the beef preparations that they are so famous for.

Tried their biryani at a local food festival and it turned out to be pretty good. In fact much better than I expected for that price. The quantity was good and the size of the chicken piece was decent as well, although the inside of the chicken was a little too dry for my liking. Although overall I'm pretty happy with their product, hope to visit their restaurant soon and try out some of their other dishes.

If you love biryani and beef biryani to be particular then this place is a must visit. Although they have chicken and mutton as well but the tender beef was a different story altogether.it is a no frills restaurant. The tender meat with chunky aloo piece and sufficient rice is more than enough for one person. The ghol along side is a brilliant drink and must be ordered. Spicy and cool. Must try. Very cheap but very delicious!

Set inside a tiny area of the immensely crowded Park Circus area, this place guarantees heart warming food. Mainly serving biryani and the mughlai cuisine, its my new must-hit-joint in town. I had the beef biryani and it was absolutely amazing. The beef was tender and soft. A tad bit dry though, but I'm not complaining. The rice had the authentic Kolkata taste to it. The chicken chaap was equally good; maybe a little too oily, but again, no complaints. Could have been a little spicier though. Getting to this joint is a headache, especially with the parking, but its worth it all.

Zam Zam is PHENOMENAL.
Be it the taste, value for money or the quantity.
Went here today to pick up food to bring home..
A small tip to everyone, if you are going on Friday i.e. the Jumma day, please go after 1 p.m. They do not serve until the Jumma Namaaz is over.
We ordered 3 packets of Beef Biryani, one Beef Bhuna, one Beef Malai and four 'kulhars' of Firni. The bill came to 410 rupees.
The service was really good, so a thumbs up for that.
Now, coming to the taste.
The Biryani was just beautiful. Fluffy,long-grained rice, beautifully aromatic and surprisingly light. With two chunks of beef and a succulent piece of potato.
The beef bhuna comprised of six chunks of beef swimming in a spicy gravy. It IS quite oily but I did not mind.
The beef malai was really enjoyed by me,but the reason for that can be that I like slightly sweetened curries, not all may like it.
But, the best part of the meal was the firni. For a mere 25 rupees, the quantity is more than satisfying. Also, the taste was unlike any firni I have had before. It had an oddly caramelised flavour which was beautiful. I was so blown away by the firni that I could not even take a picture of it. Overall, a beautiful culinary experience.

I visited this place on 04.04.16. The place was hard to find even using google map from park street metro station. People helped me several times to detect it's location. Environment is average. Washroom is there. Hygiene is passable. Biriyani is very cheap w.r.t. quantity and quality. Biriyani is standout whether it is chicken or beef. More visits are awaited to cover other items.

It was my second visit. Much easier to locate the restaurant this time. Get off from bus at Jora-Geerja (next stop of Entally) stop and walk into the by lane for mere 5 min opposite of mother's home (Missionary's of Charity). You will find the lane called 'Hare Krishna Kongar Lane' walk towards 'white house'. Turn left @ white house n you will find this small Biryani joint in Noor Ali Avenue.

It was a real rush hour. So I quickly ordered beef Biryani, beef Bhuna , ghol n salad. No kebab at that afternoon time.
Beef Biryani : (5/5) The best beef Biryani I have ever tasted. Two boneless succulent beef pieces cooked to its perfection. One buttery soft potato n huge quantity of good quality rice makes it a best Biryani of Kolkata. Also the price is big woooww. Only 75/-

Beef Bhuna : (4.5/5) 4 small size boneless Mutton pieces with sinful mouthwatering greasy gravy is a perfect companion for the Biryani. It's a must try dish.
Rs 40/-

Ghol n salad : (5/5) To digest down the whole thing you should really go for the ghol (not any other soft drinks). Rs 15/-

Ambience n service : (2.5/5) Ambience is Okies . But really didn't like the standard of the crowd also sharing table due to rush hour. Hygiene and cleanliness is just above satisfactory. Though the service was real quick but didn't like the attitude of my particular waiter.

Nevertheless, I will return very soon to taste Chicken n Mutton dishes. One more thing they can add 12% GST if you ask for Computerized Bill. So no need to ask for that. Real chap n best Biryani of Kolkata. All Biryani lover's must visit this place only for food.

Beef Biryani - 75
Beef Bhuna - 40
Ghol n Salad - 15
Total - 130.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Biryani lovers like me , I should have visited this place long back. Excellent beef biryani. Kashmira is a perfect side dish. Beef malai is little sweet but it can be a great companion with nan. Ghol is a must have in zamzam. Masala in ghol will help you to digest the meal. Firni is perfectly done. Low cost but great food.

Beef Biryani!! I finally found you. :-p

Zam Zam has been around for some time now and yet, you don't generally get to hear about this place. It seems that this place has lost its way in the huge labyrinth of North Indian cuisine in which already big players like Arsalan and Aminia are making a steadfast progress. Having said that, I'd definitely add that Zam Zam has a very different clientele than some of the other Biryani outlets and that is what makes it exclusive and dare I say, exotic.

Tried the beef Biryani. Oh, the taste. Very, very good Biryani. The beef pieces are a bit rubbery but then again, the taste compensates for that. They also serve a Ghol with the Biryani which is supposed to help with the digestion(?). I saw people taking seconds of the Ghol but personally, I didn't like it one bit. 

This is not a place that you find easily. Nope, easy is not the word you're looking for. In my case, I had to circle around the whole block and even then, I wasn't sure of the way. Google maps doesn't help either. Also, if you're looking for ambience, then this place isn't for you. This place is crowded, and often congested. But the food is worth it. Not to mention that it is dirt cheap. 

A must try, if you can find it. :-D

This place really serves some mouthwatering biriyani. Quantity and quality of food is great and price is also reasonable.  Both of us being a great fan of biriyani and we were hungry too so we hogged in mutton biriyanj, chicken chaap and chicken Marsala like we're in heaven. Its a must visit of any biriyani lovers. See you soon zam zam. Next time beef for sure !!!!

The legend of Zam Zam is something most of us are aware of. The craving for good meat that I often get is hardly ever properly laid to rest. Therein lies Zam Zam's finest hour.

Biryani is almost our daily diet here in Kolkata, and Zam Zam typifies what good Biryani is. Chicken, Mutton, Beef -- any of it. Their biryani is among the most edible things I've ever eaten.

Now that Nizam near New Market has stopped serving beef, you'll be in need of a new eatery. I'd personally recommend Zam Zam. The food is sensational, and the service is fine. It's also dirt cheap, if that helps.

Now that Nizam near New Market has stopped serving beef, you'll be in need of a new eatery. I'd personally recommend Zam Zam. The food is sensational, and the service is fine. It's also dirt cheap, if that helps.

Ambience: n/a
Service: 3/5
Food: 4/5
Value for Money: 4.5/5

Thanks for reading and pardon any grammatical errors I may have made.

Today for office dinner we ordered mutton biriyani and chicken chaap from here. As expected the food was awesome. The biriyani is very light and the chaap was very tasty indeed. Will not rate the place more because of the amount of dalda they use. But surely a good place for the taste buds.

Thanx to zomato for the positive reviews , which was the reason why we dropped by to try their biriyani. Location wise it was super difficult to find the outlet. When we actually found the place ..it was exactly as it was described.There isn't much to say when it comes to their ambience, decor or service!! So all we wanted was good food. Ordered mutton biriyani, chicken biriyani and chicken chap. Biriyani was delicious. Aromatic ...tender meat.. Yum ! So 3.5 just for the food we ate there.

Been hearing a lot of good things about this place for quite some time but the location was a deterrent to my visit there. However last friday i sent my office staff to visit and got food packed . we ordered beef biryani, mutton biryani, beef malai, beef bhuna and the ghol.

The Beef biryani was mildly flavoured, less oily and had a wonderful aroma..2 medium sized boneless beef pieces and a large potato completed the dish.. however the beef pieces were a bit chewy and not soft, costs Rs 75 per plate only.. The mutton biryani had less flavour and aroma but tasted good nonetheless , the mutton pice was soft and succulent. Rs 105 per plate!!
The beef malai was a thick, white gravy but a little too sweet, however the beef bhuna was divine and was the best dish... 4-5 bite sized beef pieces dipped in a rich gravy, soft and succulent.

Definitely worth a visit, if not parcel it like we did :-)

I tried their chicken biriyani, chicken kasa, chicken karishma (nothing different from kasa), paratha, egg roll, firni and doodh malai... and all are very tasty... pocket pinch was friendly too...

By getting lots and lots of feedback from various articles and blogs. So i visited this place with my friends. As per all the Zomato reviewers the place is little difficulty to locate i will suggest just follow google maps blindly. Now lets come to the food we order beef biriyani, beef kashmiri, chicken chap, lachha parata, firni and ghol. Biriyani is just awesome and quality of beef is A-class, food was teasty and smells are mouth watering too. But unfortunately i like cold or chilled ghol but the ghol was in normal room temperature. Ambient is not like a classy resturant but rather its like a road side restaurant. But no doubt it is much cleaner thn i expected. If anyone just want to try beef for the 1st time this place is highly recommend.

I have only tried their Biryani a couple of times through delivery.

Taste was ok though I'm not a fan of biryani.However,the major let down was the amount of oil that they use which is excessive.So much so that the packs ooze of oil which is not appreciable.

Located near St. James Church, this place is a difficult find. They are mostly popular for their Biryanis, to be precise Beef Biryani. Although, I didn't have the opportunity to try the Beef Variant, my friend did get me a parcel for me once consisting of Chicken Biryani. Although reheated back at home. the rice was soft and did not go dry. The chicken was cooked properly and wasn't chewy. Although, the taste could have been better, but it wasn't bad at t the same time!

Though not everyone would be comfortable visiting ZamZam considering the ambience of this place but one should definitely take away the Biriyanis as it is one of the best in the town and at one of the cheapest rates.
This is one of the hotspots for Biriyani lovers specially Beef and Mutton. Also had Beef malai which was just awesome !

Ambiance was not good & Interior deco was nothing special, but biriyani was awesome awesome awesome.... I went there for dinner & also parcels some dishes.... Staffs are well behaved.... Cost was ok....

Reminiscing about our first tryst with Zam Zam not only gleefully transports me back to that damp and windy day but also leaves me smiling, while an aftertaste of ghee-infused firni (along with some scraped bits of burnt earth) lingers on in my mouth. 
It was one rainy afternoon during Eid when we unfortunately happened to come by right when they had just closed the restaurant for dining in. They were still open for take-away, so while we were a bit disappointed, we placed our orders for a Mutton Biryani, Beef Biryani, Beef Bhuna and Firni.
We packed away the food and had a small picnic of sorts. The rice used in making the biryani was thin, long and aromatic. Both of us however felt that the mutton was suppler than the hard and chewy beef. The biryani had very little oil and just the right amount of spices and flavours but it somehow couldn't live up to our expectations built up from reading all the rave reviews. The bhuna was extensively oily but the chunks of beef were much softer and well cooked. 
I absolutely loved zamzam's firni more than anything else. I've had firni from various places all over the city but this one totally won my heart. In tiny earthen bowls, the deliciously ghee-laden concoction of rice powder, milk and sugar churned up to perfection makes you crave for buckets more of it. I can almost still taste the heart-melting mush in my mouth and sense the earthy smell wafting into my room as I finish writing this review. :)

Famous for beef biryani, this place is not for hygiene conscious people or someone who is looking for a comfortable seating. Visiting during the winters can only be comfortable, rest of the time its really hot, so better to pack food. 

The quality of the beef biryani have degraded during the past few years. The meat is not that soft nowadays and there are better places to relish this dish. But if you are around, the biryani is still decent enough not to give this place a miss. Do order a glass of ghol / burhani to go with the biryani. Not many places serve this. 

But one beef dish I really like here is the beef malai. A bit sweet and really smooth, it is an excellent thing to order with tandoori rotis.

If you are lucky (read real real lucky) you will be served a plate of pure delight if you order Doodh Malai. It's the malai layer collected from the top of the boiling milk and only a few plates are available. Try to visit around 5 or 8 PM for this.

The place is a typical Muslim eatery located in Beniapukur near Park circus. I had been there with a friend for lunch. We were in the area for some work and were famished as we had both not eaten for quite some time. 

The place is very basic but it's hygienic. There is nothing elaborate about the Menu or the items for order. 

We stuck to the basic Chicken Chanp, Chicken Biriyani and Chanch. The food was beyond expectations. The Biriyani was a bit oily but tasty nevertheless. The Chanp was OK  and the Chanch was the saving grace in this heat. 
If u are looking for a budget eatery that provides you with filling food on a budget. This is the place to be. 

Do keep in mind it's a Muslim eatery. Please don't visit if you have any prejudices or biasedness as the servers , waiters and cook all are Muslims.

Located at Entally. Near moulali crossing. This is one of the most sought after restaurants when it comes to good beef biryani. The price is cheap and the food is nice. But the location is not at all convenient. And one of the worst things about this restaurant is the staffs are not at all friendly. The food being good remains the only attraction and I personally like this place. But given that restaurants are not rated entirely upon the food, this makes up to be a moderate restaurant.

If you like biriyani then this is an ideal place for you. They are specialised in beef biriyani. Position is very tricky and you have to use your navigation system otherwise you can enter into a small lane just beside the prat memorial school and then you have to ask the local peoples several times to reach this restaurant. Ordered beef biriyani, beef bhuna and beef malai, The malai was ridiculously good but bhuna was little bit oily side. The quality and quantity of biriyani was appropriate for one hungry soul. if you are a biriyani lover then you should visit this place once in your life time. It will not disappoint you.

overrated. I thought this will be a hidden gem. Finding the place was no less than a treasure hunt and driving my Innova through that lane was a tedious task. I thought the food will be worth the pain. I ordered the beef bhuna, paratha and beef biriyani as I went to have the meat which is sacred for some and delicious for some. It is just food for me though. Must say there is nothing special in the biriyani. It is just like any random biriyani you can have. I expected the beef bhuna to be something spicy with good meat but all I got was  four small pieces of meat floating in a tasteless gravy. Seriously Bengali mangshor jhol is better than that. I wonder who are these people who rated this place 4 to 5 and mentioned best and out of the world. DO they know anything about food or are they just paid to write good stuff by the restaurant owners. Anyway if it is the latter then I must commend the efforts of the owner. It worked out really fine. I would advise people to go to any random place serving beef biriyani in Park circus, chandni, chitpur or any muslim dominated area. I am sure it will be just the same if not better. No need for a treasure hunt and driving with GPS

Went there today, its a real pain to find using Google maps. I'd like to mention that it was really empty when I reached and I wasn't even sure it was Zam Zam but I guess it was the right place. Anyway coming to the food, I'd say the Biriyani was as good as most places but not as good as Arsalan or Shiraz. The beef Malai was only decent, I've had better numerous times. Anyway, considering the price, its a pretty good place to eat and if you're in the mood for beef then its the stop to take.

The beef biriyani is really great. One of the best i have had. The meat was tender yet strong, not the chewey type, it takes a very good cook to achieve that with beef. The rice is fine, but the potato could be better. I had also ordered beef stew, it wad served cold and did not taste good although i am sure it would have tasted better if served piping hot. Prices are standard as per beef restaurants which is way lower than the non-beef ones. Location is very tricky..... Take the lane/road next to Pratt School and walk down to a big crossing, take left and keep walking till you reah a building named white house (ehat a joke!) abd take right from there.... Its another 4/5 minutes on foot. One can also comr from the CIT Road side but its more complicated. Overall, a good place for beef dishes and pocket friendly.

Located in one of the bylanes near park circus crossing,Zam zam offers a variety of beef items along with chkn and mutton but the beef biryani,beef malai and beef bhuna are the best sellers. You can also try their chicken chaap. Its advisable to do a takeaway from here spclly for women. Prices are damn cheap. Quantity is just about okay

This place was very difficult to find.  Me and the Uber driver moved around the GPS location like Chris Columbus to spot it.  The ambience was that of a roadside dhaba with people just concentrating on their biriyani.  I ordered the vanilla beef biriyani which I heard from many people.  The service was fast.  The biriyani had a yellow tinge and was very blunt.  The beauty of beef was supposed to be juicy and chewy. But here the beef was bolied so much that there was no differentiation from Mutton. And unlike other beef joints, the meat was cow and not buffalo.  Not the best beef biriyani in the city but definitely better than many other joints. Worth a try.

located in quaint street near one of the ParK Circus crossings, this one was always on my list as I have heard so much about their food. Finally, went there for lunch today with a friend from work! Very good beef biriyani indeed. Tried it with beef bhuna.. It went perfectly with the biriyani. It was flavourful and the noticeable thing is that the beef did not stink one bit. Though, I did not get tender pieces in the biriyani but the bhuna made up for that! Was a good short trip. More is in store!

Ok .. If you are looking for a place which is polished, classy and with some amazing service don't read further .. This is not fine dine, this is not even family dine. You will not find handsomely dressed waiters servicing you. But yes, what you get here is something you won't find any where. The Best Beef Biryani in the whole if Calcutta. And of course, the burhani. Along with that you will get waiters who if asked for a spoon will say, " Sir, Chammach ke khaa ke Biryani ki tauheen mat kijiye"

When the Kings of Mughalai Dishes like Arsalan, Aminia & Royal are already ruling the city for so many years, it makes a die hard situation for other competitors to stay in the battle. Where Zam Zam is a place that not only dare to compete, even it gives a hard competition to them too.

Location : Zam Zam is located in the middle of Entally & Park Circus. But as other reviews says its little hard to find it & the locality is not so good. If you are not carrying any Gps enabled device then searching it can be a little hassle & personally about the locality I don't think any place is bad. It totally depends upon on your personal thinking, I mean nobody is going to eat you over there. As less female gender seen at the restaurant & nearby it may just feel awkward to visit this place with your special one or family.

Decoration : The restaurant is always newly painted in different colors. Neat & cleanness is at top notch that is usually difficult to find in beef available restros. Not too decorations available, neither AC cabin is there but enough comfortable to sit & fill your hungry tummy while having the taste of purity. Yes its their tag line.

Staffs & Management : This is where I need to say didn't expected that from this place. When I visited probably the owner was sitting on the cashier sit. His behavior is good he suggested us their special once as we were there for take away the food. 2nd think that blows my mind is they were having ready packed up Biriyani packets for take away customers . It just proves there sell amount. Then I noticed that the packs were divided into two colors one is white another one is red. So as for curiosity I asked a staff & he replied that white packed means its a beef once & red pack is for chicken & mutton. Then he said that as customers doesn't hesitate so they make beef & chicken or mutton in two different places. Doesn't know he was lying or not but it totally impressed me.

The Hungry Tummy : Coming to the main part. This is only a Biriyani point so the menu is not too big. They offer Chicken, Mutton & Beef Biriyani with some other side dishes. We ordered Beef Biriyani & as per the recommendation Beef Bhuna & Malai. Although it was my first time with beef. When the fragrance of the Biriyani came it literally makes my mouth watering. Biriyani was so so good that I didn't expected specially for the price. Rice was high grade, spices & jafran was mixed with the rice really well so each & every grain was of yellowish tint & tasted same. Beef inside of it was well cooked with spices & taste was coming from inside that tasted really good but it could be a little soft. I am a Biriyani lover & tasted it from so many places but I need to say that this was the best one for the price. Even it was actually few inches better than the royal Restros. Beef Bhuna on the other side was just "Chumessori". The pieces was soft spicy & juicy. Gravy of this thing felt very delicious with Biriyani. Beef Malai was marinated with curd so it is kind on the sweet side. It probably won't taste so good with Biriyani but it will definitely feel awesome if you are gonna taste it with Tandoori Rotis. Pieces was bit hard but tasted good. Gravy felt wonderful. I was got dam surprised when I just got a looked at the bill. Biriyani was for Rs.70, Bhuna - 35, Malai - 45. Now what you want for that price. This pricing segment makes its competitors to taste the dust.

Conclusion : Zam Zam definitely fulfills their tag line "Taste of Purity". They deliver excellent value for money food. It is a must try for Biriyani lovers. Sometimes trying different things feels so good & you must do that if you are a real foodie.

Whenever the urge to have Biryani comes about for me or any of my family members, we head to this place to get it. Always considered it to be more of a take away and eat at home type of restaurant, the food is just exquisite. The environment and the locality might not be as awesome as the taste of the food it has to offer but if you are a fan of Biryani and enjoy that smoked flavor that melts in the mouth, this is the place for you.

Don't have money? Looking for beef biryani? Or both? Then this is the place to be. Not an ideal place to dine in with family as it located in the narrow alleys of park circus but the perfect place to come with your friends or for take away. Service is fast, prices are very reasonable and taste excellent. 
p.s. - there might be an one off occasion when the biryani might not same as good as the previous day. So don't judge on that parameter.

Yes, this place definitely provides a quality biriyani at a very low price. This is where it stands famous. But let me point out a few points. The quality is exceptionally good as per the price but I think the quantity is less. Moreover the restaurant is fine for take away. but if u wan't to dine in here then you may complain about the cleanliness of the restaurants. i think they must take this into account to really compete with the giants in the town.
Moreover they should try to increase the seating space and also try to provide AC accommodation.

I feel this place serves biryani better than any restaurant serving mughlai dishes in kolkata.. Actually it is a bit famous in muslim community as it serves "beef" too.. I would suggest a take away, as the restaurant gets hot in peak hours and its always crowded. A 100% male crowd, hardly i find any girl.. They also take bulk orders i.e price/Kg. 
One can order a biryani & "ghol" for drink.

Being a HUGE biryani fan and having had tasted biryani from most of biryani serving restaurants in Calcutta, I find Zam Zam's biryani over hyped. 

I have ordered biryani from them about four to five times, hoping that I'd change my opinion however it hasn't. 

Besides this place isn't a great option if you wish to dine in.

A great place for the biriyani lovers...and according to me they make one of the best beef biriyanis in Kolkata...you may not like the ambience and location at the first sight but once you grab a mouthful of the biriyani, you just have to visit again. The location is really tricky and it is very difficult to find this place, also this is not a place where you can go with your family or ladies. These are all the odds I can think of this place. 

Now coming to their biriyani, its very tasty, the beef pieces were fully cooked and soft and the potato was also properly cooked and tender...with the biriyani you can add beef malai or bhuna, though according to me their beef malai is the best, and all of these come with very reasonable(read cheap) prices. I also kind of liked their firni though some of my friends didn't like it much and that's reasonable. In the end, you can finish it off with a 'must have' ghol they serve...I really loved their ghol. I honestly never tasted their chicken or mutton biriyani and have no idea how they are...but for the beef lovers, this is a 'must visit' place.

Well not much of a quite ambience you can expect here really given that this is a fast food Mughlai outlet located in one of the most busiest places in Kolkata.

If your looking for that perfect Beef Biryani and some Beef Bhuna, then Zam Zam will not disappoint you. Staying in a place such as Mumbai , I would say that the Menu has been priced very cheap, but that doesn't mean that the food quality has been compromised. I have to admit that it was the best ever beef Biryani I had ever tasted.

This Mughlai Joint is not known to a lot of people but I would recommend every Mughlai food lovers in Kolkata to definitely try this place out.

Of course improvement is needed in the field of hygiene and availability of packaged drinking water for customers , but other than that this place is perfect in catering to the needs of some of the most  inexpensive yet delicious Mughlai Cuisines.

This a David among all the Goliaths of Biryani in the city, which has slowly and steadily won over the hearts of a number of calcuttans simply just for its biryani.
Situated in the lanes leading to Frank Anthony Public School, with no expansive menu and an appearance of any other local restaurant in the area, any man could pass it of as just any small eatery. But hav a taste of its biryani and u r certainly going to overlook everything above. And it is also well priced.
Specializing mostly in beef u hav very few options in side dishes in chicken and mutton, yet they prepare it  well. Its not for family seating, so takeaway is the best option and hav ur box of biryani in the comforts of ur home. Situated next to my house I hav been having it twice or thrice in a month ever since it opened. So be rest assured of the quality 😉

Zam zam serves excellent biryani in the city. One cannot sit there with family n dine. It's apt for take aways or js fr guys to sit n eat. I've heard ppl swear by their beef biryani, but as I do not eat beef I've to do with the chicken and mutton which are par excellence. The alu is soft and tender n the meat is juicy. They serve ghol too which most of the other restaurants don't. They take party orders too a min of 3kgs. We often get a mini degh prepared for small parties and eid!  A pocket friendly biryani paradise

I have been visiting this place for its authentic Biriyani. They are most affordable given the quality they serve. A plate of Mutton Biriyani comes for a price of Rs.105/- only which is quite a competitive price. The taste is amazing and the chunk of meat is tender. They also serve the Beef Biriyani..which comes for Rs.70/- only. The meat is quite tender again. The potatoes are nicely cooked...melts in theouth quite well. The firni is wonderfully prepared there, I would say that they know their make quite well. Locality is a big problem for people not knowing the whereabouts.

Last Friday one of my office colleagues bought chicken biriyani and ghol from this place and the taste was just awesome no words. Nice fragrance, gr8 masala and most imp not much oil. Ghol which was made with curd and coriander leaves n Masala, green in colour, tasted nice after eating the biriyani. So guys I would suggest u all to taste it at least once. U will love it.

Places like Zam Zam and a few more are the reasons why I love visiting Park Circus. If you are hungry and are in or around the area, Zam Zam would be a great choice to have mouthwatering and tummy filling meals at a very reasonable price. The interior is quit nice and I loved their service.

There is always a wave of happiness whenever you enter these eateries. Some incredible sense of excitement. You can smell all that food and a place which is in ways as bare bones as it comes, you have to order whatever you can get your hands on.

We ordered the beef biriyani, the bhuna, the beef malai and some tandoori roti. The biriyani was lovely and light. A proper Kolkata biriyani. You eat that entire plate and you don't feel uneasy at the slightest. The rice being fluffy and that beef absolutely tender. It is always a joy to have biriyani that good with all these pretenders around. 

The bhuna was standard. I mean, it was really good, but it could not compare to that absolutely spectacular beef malai. That was just beautiful. Slightly sweet, rich and beyond anything I expected. 

The pocket pinch can't count. It's just horrifyingly cheap.

Unbelievable!  Zam zam on zomato and I did not quite notice. I have been introduced to this joint , ever since my school days as I grew up in Ripon Street. Either on can enter through ripon street or through CIT road entally. It is kind of difficult to locate for the first-time goers. But once found, this is a heaven for biryani lovers and specifically beef biryani. I was introduced to beef for the first time here. And ever since I have been a mad fan of this.  I have never tasted such soft and supple beef in my life. It melts in the mouth.  The beef bhuna is one of my dead favourites. The beef bharta goes amazingly well with tandoori rotis. There are lip smacking chicken and mutton dishes available. But definitely .. the beef is the only say. The prices are dirt cheap. However if you are a hygiene freak and a woman, you better get your food parcelled. But one visit over here is a must.

Zam Zam is a really nice and cheap place for Biriyani, especially for Beef Biriyani and other Beef items. It is located in Entally, and is difficult to locate being inside a winding lane. However we navigated ourselves by asking shopkeepers who guided us easily to the place.
The place looks as if it has recently been painted. It is moderately clean and neat, nothing fancy. They just mean business! I have tried a Beef Biriyani, Beef Malai and a Firni. The Beef Biriyani had the authentic Calcuttan Biriyani flavour, the potato was soft and Beef although a little tough was well cooked through. The Beef Malai was absolutely creamy and not at all spicy. It was very pleasant on the stomach. The Firni had a top layer of malai and was very rich and sweet. 
The ambience is not very good and the lane becomes a little shady late evening for travelling alone. The servers are usually in a hurry but service of swift. It is a nice place to drop in if you are looking for good no non-sense Biriyani. This is NOT a place for vegetarians since all they offer is non-veg. It is very reasonable and satisfies a biriyani-hungry stomach successfully. Do visit.

I admit the fact that finding this place is troublesome but that hardly matters if you love biriyani. The place is quite small. Not one for you, if you are expecting an AC restuarant but this place provides cheap and mouth watering dishes. I loved the beef biriyani which they serve and I don't think I have ever had anything better anywhere else.

I can see from the other comments that some of my fellow Zomatians have faced difficulty finding this restaurant. So let me help you reach the spot first. Come to Mullick Bazar crossing or Jora Girja (close to Pratt Memorial School), start walking towards the Ripon Street entrance, go in the lane and you will come across an Austin factory on your right hand side; walk straight and you will come to a cross road. Stop there and ask any paan walla about the restaurant, it’s just 2 minutes away from there.

If you love Beef Biryani, then there’s no way you can afford to miss this place. A connoisseur of Biryani recommended this restaurant to us. It is located in a narrow lane and the place remains crowded even after 9 PM of night. So there was no love at first sight. The restaurant was almost full but a waiter managed to arrange a table for us. They should consider improving the seating arrangement or else it will scare away many customers. If it was not for the love of Biryani, we would have left the place. The chairs were too small, we could hardly fit 6 plates on the table. After a while it became suffocating and uncomfortable for 6 of us. That’s the end of all the negatives. The Beef Biryani they serve is heavenly, way better than some of the over hyped Biryani joints of the city. We also ordered for Beef Malai as a side dish which was equally lip-smacking but it didn’t go well with the taste of Biryani for its sweetness. The waiter suggested a special Lassi that would help us digest the meal faster which tasted nice and he was right; by the time we reached home we were hungry again. I’d recommend this place to all the Beef lovers; taste the authenticity.

The Biryani is heavenly. You are missing out if you haven't tasted here.

Although Kolkata is flooded with huge brands supplying Biryani, Zam Zam is capable of giving stiff competition to them. The Biryani is just amazing. I haven't visited the shop but had the privilege of tasting its Biryani and Chaap. Oh how tasty they are.

Service will no disappoint you. kudos for the quick service. Beef Biryani was very tasty.. Potato in the Biryani is very soft and melt in mouth. No one can beat Beef biriyani here.. Ghol was decent.. Overall nice food.

It's the perfect place for quality Biryani,they serves delicious,divine,delightful biryani.Beef Malai is one of the other item than biryani which is superb and lip smacking. Although this place is not on the main road,but still I will not compromise for a good mughlai food.It is not air conditioned,so you may have to suffer a little if your plan is to seat and dine.It's better to carry away.But for quality point of view Zamzam is marvellous.

Indeed a brilliant quality biriyani. By far one of the best biriyanis available in Kolkata. The restaurant isn't a popular one as it's in the interiors of Entally, but if you are a beef eater and don't mind the ambience then you must try. Also try out their ghol.

When you are searching for great quality biriyani in Kolkata you should be a Beefatarian. To get the best taste of a Biriyani, the tenderness of Beef meat is necessary.I need good quality biriyani at least twice per month and hence Zam Zam is the only place I can afford to visit regularly. I have never tried their chicken preparations. Superb Biriyani. I have tried to avoid the Biriyani few times and go for something else instead. But whenever I am close to Zam Zam I have to change my decision (the smell is very intoxicating; You kind of get addicted to their Biriyani.) Other than Biriyani you should try their unique recipe, Beef Malai with Tandoori Roti or as a side dish with your biriyani. After having the heavy meal please drink a glass of Ghol for good digestion. ;)

A localite friend of mine introduced this place to me. Previously I heard good words about their beef biriyani. Honestly I did not like the biriyani. Maybe its a bad day for them. The rice was soggy, and the flavors present in the dish did not make my appetite happy. Though I am very pleased with their beef malai. I would rather suggest one to order roti, beef malai. True value for money. The location is very hard to find. And the ambience is a thumbs down from me. :)

Zam Zam = Beef Biryani. 
I was introduced to this place by one of my friends. This is a very tricky place to find. Close to Mallick Bazar Tram depot ask any one for the location. The ambiance is not that great. Its typically a very simple non ac eating house. 

Even though the decor and ambiance is not great the food absolutly is. 
Beef Biryani is their speacialty. The quantity is good enough but the taste will force you for a second plate. 

A nice place to go with friends and grab some beef biryani with stew.

If you love Beef and if you love Biryani,you MUST visit this place.For me this place serves the best beef biryani in town.
It is situated in the midst of a maze of narrow lanes and is quite difficult to locate at first.One can reach this place either from the Ripon Street side or from the CIT road side.

The food is brilliant.The Beef Biryani is full of aroma and not at all oily as in many of the relatively smaller joints.The quality of the rice used is excellent.The beef and the potato in the biryani are cooked to perfection.Apart from the Biryani,the Beef Malai,Beef Bhuna and the Beef stew are all very good.I really liked the Beef malai which is really flavourful.They offer a Ghol which is quite popular but something I do not prefer much personally.For people who do not prefer Beef they do have chicken and mutton varieties but then this place if you would ask me is only for the beef.

The inside of the place is small and stuffy.It is always crowded with locals.The service is swift and to be fair the staff try to be helpful too.The prices are very reasonable.But it is absolutely not suitable if you are looking for a decent ambience or if you are a group of ladies.In such a scenario the option of takeaway is recommended.

Overall in spite of the difficult location and the below par ambience this place stands out for the Biryani and more so for the Beef.

This is a place well-hidden within a maze of lanes.The place is small,and cramped and stuffy....and,if u are a woman,terribly unfavourable.I had gone with 5 guys....and was subjected to pointed stares by men all around.
The food was worth it,though....the biryani is the best beef biryani i've ever had....the beef tender,the rice frangrant and teeming with flavours....and the potato delicious.We also ordered beef bhuna,a spicy,lip-smoacking dish that leaves your forehead beaded with sweat,beef kashmira-a shorba infused with such beautiful flavour that i had a hard time stopping myself from licking the plate.
They serve ghol as well and mind you,it is as much of a reason to visit this place as the biryani.The meal just can't be complete without a glass of the tangy ghol.
I got out with a contented tummy and with a contented smile playing on the lips as the pocket pinch was 220 rs for 2 biryani,2 ghol,1 beef bhuna and 1 kashmira.Delightful!

If you are looking for great Beef Biryani,look no further than Zamzam...but purely a takeout place especially if you have female company....I mean its a sit-down restaurant which could seat about 30 people but as pointed out by other reviewers the surroundings could be a tad bit uncomfortable...another factor is the maze of lanes you have to negotiate to get there...its not the easiest place to give directions to...

Anyways to the food..I did a takeout of the beef biryani,beef stew and beef bhuna....I know its a beef overload but what the heck....The biryani amazing as always with a potato and two pieces of beef....the highlight for me is the beef stew.....its difficult to explain the taste,but its a must try and the bhuna was another great dish.....Zamzam is a must try if you are craving beef and don't just stop at the biryani...

The biryani was Rs 65,the stew was Rs 35 and the bhuna was Rs 30...money well spent in my opinion...
The takeout service is fast with a no nonsense air to it...

Food:10/10
 Service: 8/10

Okay. Call me nuts to have wanted to visit this place for their beef biryani. What followed from figuring out its location to the experience has been beyond crazy.

On our way from Sufisutra, my friends and me wanted to eat biryani. We decided on trying zam zam. With nokia drive on and an unconvinced cab driver, we set forth on a crazy, adventurous journey. From losing our way to being scolded by the cab driver, we faced it all just to have a plate of beef biryani. Fair enough, but the fun began when we reached the place. 

Flooded by only men of different shapes and sizes, zam zam had an invisible board which read, "Women, keep out. If you still decide to visit, be letched, leered, slurped and digested with the chaas". I make this strong a statement for I saw no women there. NONE. And my friend who was a boy overheard the next table screaming loudly, "Lag nahi raha hain ki zam zam aaye hain". And forget the innumerable times we were letched by the crowd. Mind you, not the hotel staff. The staff in fact made sure we get a place, are served properly and paid heed to our demands.

At the end of it all, I loved my food experience, for zam zam's biryani was on my wishlist and I NAILED it. We ordered two beef biryanis, one chicken biryani, one beef stew, one chaas and a thums up. Our bill came to an insignificant amount of 276 INR. The biryani rice was bloody good, steaming hot, and had the perfect balance of richness and flavour, none overpowering the other. The beef and potato was super soft and simply melted in the mouth. We loved it. My friend loved the chicken in the biryani too. The beef stew curry was insane. It was a perfect balance of tasty and spicy but the beef was considerably hard. They serve an awesome chatpata salad by the side which was addictive and I decided to give the hygiene aspect a complete miss and simply gobbled it. My order of chaas sealed my meal perfectly and I feel absolutely happy to have gone to zam zam and experience it first hand. 

Given an option now, I will only consider a take away from zam zam henceforth and go there on a bike to traverse the snake lanes.

Zam Zam is a little known place which possibly serves the best Beef Biryanis in the city. One of the reasons it is so unheard of is probably because of it's location. A friend took me there on a yellow taxi and we went through crowded little lanes with innumerable twists and turns before reaching there. The place in itself is a little better than a shack but appearances can be deceiving. The Beef Biryani there is to die for. They use the best long grain aromatic Basmati rice in their Biryanis. No Biryani restaurant in the city use the kind of rice these guys do. It is that good. In the Biryani you will find a big chunk of beef which you will lick to the bone. The Chaap is awesome too. And then wash it all down with a glass of Ghol. Just fantastic! These guys are the true masters of Biryani. And yes, feel free to use your fingers. It is not a knife and fork kind of place. And the prices are ridiculously cheap. Bless the good people of Zam Zam.

When this restaurant is specifically for those foodies who consume Beef, because Zam Zam incidently is the best restaurant in Kolkata that serves Beef Biryani any day any time. I might have eaten in Zam Zam on two occasions but in both of these times the Beef Biryani was simple amazing. The quantity of rice and pieces of Beef, potatoes all make this Biryani taste great.
Incidently i had tasted the Ghol ( a drink made with curd) that is also excellent. 

Well nothing much to say of the deco part and the service was fast but you cannot expect the waiters here to be professional when they serve since they simply plonk the plates on the table and clean tables with real pronto speed.

Delicious biryani just for Rs50.

Though the place is small and seats about 30 people there is always a queue to get in.

Takeaway is the best if you are in a hurry

They also serve Mutton and Chicken

Good for take away. The softness of beef will amaze anyone. The best part they still use wood fire to cook their dishes, the original "kather jal er ranna" that might also impart the aroma to the food. Zam Zam have a branch at Khidderpore. Beef Malai is a must try!

Three cheers for the Beef Biryani here! All hail! This is possibly one of the best Beef Biryanis I have had till date, and the prices are dirt cheap. Takeaway is recommended, but you can always sit down for a meal. However, go here for the soft beef that literally can be cut open with a fork and it is absolutely melt in your mouth. I thank my friend for introducing this place to me every time I come across this Biryani. Also, try the beef malai. It shall change your world.
