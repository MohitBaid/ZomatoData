Food, service and ambience, everything okayish. There is nothing extraordinary about this hotel. We were hungry and so we came here. Just had soup which was spicy beyond expectations.

Excellent restaurant for college going students as it doesn't hurts the wallet. :) :P
thank you food zone. They offer enough amount of food at such low rates. Simply love the taste. Try their chicken reshmi butter masala. It's superb. Try it with chicken fried rice or prawn fried rice.
Happy eating :)

this resturant is crap. from the seating to the menu tl the quality of food. the whole resturant is in a dark small dingy hall (feels more like a torture cell rather than a resturant) uncomfortable and dirty seats with hedious decorations (found a christmas bell on the wall in the month of march) the menu is huge with a lot of varieties but none of the items from the menu is upto satisfaction. i ordered an american chopsuey and all i found on it was semi cooked vegetables raw onions and a whole whole whole lot of tomato favouring that ruined my taste buds (its looked more like an american crapsuey :p) over all i would suggest everyone who is reading this not to visit the resturant and if you want to visit a resturant visit a good one. money is hard earned please dont waste your money and time coming to this resturant.

Located near hudco more we discovered this place last week when we were hungry and was running short of money too.. Tried dry chilli chicken,, chicken momos,, mixed noodles,, garlic chicken, hong kong chicken and mixed rice.. Food was good but need to improve a lot.. Disappointing was when we ordered biriyani or nun roti they were unable to serve us so we had to go for noodles and chicken and their debit card machine not working at the end of the meal.. Overall a decent experience..

Located in the lane where auto s stop at times, right opposite hudco mor. Non descript place. For a span of 2hours they got only 4customers. There is absolutely nothing of an ambience.low lit place with some sort of loud thumming sound in the background.
We ordered an momo, american chopsuey and fried chicken and were thoroughly dissappointed with both. The american chopsuey was liked papad soaked in excess ketchup and had loads of carrots cut in round shape all over. Was horrendous to taste.
The fried chicken was bits of chicken dipped in an egg batter. The batter was ok to taste but the chicken inside was simply boiled one with hardly any seasoning and was not even juicy. No sauce was served with it. The momo was only standard, five pieces with clear soup and sauce. quantity was sufficient in the money for all items.
Not a good place all in all. If u want to get stuffed without any respect to taste, this can be the go to place

Located beside the lane against P.C. Chandra. This is the lane, which some of the auto drivers uses to come to Hudco by turning left from Ultadanga Station after having completed their trip. The place has been here for quite some time but I had dropped here only once.Â 

Came for a take-away a couple of months back and ordered for Egg Noodles and Chilly Chicken. Quite average good, with the Noodles being bland, and the Chilli Chicken having less amount of Chicken and more batter. Never really came here back again.

Food zone is quite an old restaurant with small cozy old school sitting arrangements.

**Location**
At Ultadanga the lane beside the PC Chandra Jewellery showroom.

**Experience**
Food is very average and nothing special and extraordinary about it.  I tried their Indian cuisine which was a bit oily but tasty. Chicken tandoori was a bit hard though. Very average in terms of food. Service is fast.
