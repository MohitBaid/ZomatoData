Well, winter ‚Äì the season of peace as well as PEAS (Matar)!

Tis the perfect time to enjoy a great deal of items prepared using Permutations / Combinations of this divine veg ‚Äì PEAS!

So, in order to respect Mr. peas, I entered this outlet of Bhikharams ‚Äì based nearby the Chinar Park, Rajarhat! It seems that this outlet did not exist long back. You get the usual variety that the Bhikharams offer ‚Äì decent range of sweets, decent range of snacks and savouries as well as packed stuff! 

I went for a take-away of matar patties and expressed my desire to pay through PayTm. To my utter surprise, the Boudi (Read: Bong lady) at the cash counter was not aware of the mobile no. on which money was to be sent!

You expect better ambience at a Bhikharam, but that was definitely missing here ‚Äì and the outlet throws more of a sorry picture. They do have arrangements for serving live jalebis and stuff, but one does not develop that gusto of dining out at this place.

Coming to the patty, quite decent with good peas stuffing ‚Äì and also the face saviour for this place. Portion served was good, and price justified!

A 3.5 for them ‚Äì only for the quality product ‚Äì nothing else!

Good quality sweets but not as per Bhikaram's standard! Very small outlet. Waiting is too long. Staffs are really cooperative and am pretty sure that they will streamline these issues soon :-)

Have been their long standing fan. This is their latest outlet and strategically well located. The Quality has been maintained. While the sweets and packaged snacks roll out of the same factory, quality had to be the same, what impressed is that the quality of chats is also at par with other outlets. Visited again yesterday, May 21 at 5pm. Bought chats for about 100, paid with 100 rupee note. Decided to also buy masala chips for 85, offered to pay 500. Was told bluntly without even checking no change. Its a problem in this part of the world that people think they are doing a favor to customers. Giving out change feels like paying extra. That's why people from other parts of India have excelled in business here. One does not expect this from this outlet. The lady at the counter needs to be skilled. Decided not to buy. Check CCTV for details at the mentioned time.

As Rajarhat new town area is growing fast wth that development here comes a new addition to the sweet tooth of this area is the new Bikharam Chandmal. 

Located at the chinar park crossing just beside the lenskart shop. Previously the place was occupied by a mio amore outlet but now it has changed to this shop.

I had walked in with a friend of mine to this outlet to get some sweets for our office team members. We took some exquisite sandesh and kaju barfi along with us which was really yummy.

Also tried the mango lassi which was really very refreshing in this summer. They give home delivery as well as discussed with the person serving there. Also their are good breakfast options available too which I would like to try next time I visit this outlet. A good addition to this area and I presume they will do justice to their brand name in future.

First reviewer to this place. :-p

With so many small sweet outlets to some big names as Haldiram's at the new town Chinar park region here it comes another big sweet tycoon Bhikharam Chandmal. Just at the Chinar park crossing beside Lenskart showroom. They particularly deal in huge variety of sweets as well as snacks items too.

Went there to take some parcel for home. Bought some variety of sweets in forms of Rasgulla which was soft, tasty and fresh. Secondly bought some more side sweets as well which were nice too. And tried the Dhokla which was nice and tasty. It was fresh and soft and made well.

The start has been good from them. Lets see how they can continue with it..

NOTE: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.
