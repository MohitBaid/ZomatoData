I ordered chicken keema paratha from this restaurant,  curd was included in meal. They send curd in very small pouch( we get sauce in that when we purchase fast food)..... Chicken keema was in very small portion....
Paratha was half fried. Everything was bad. I order regularly from zomato & this was the worst experience. This is actually not restaurant, only a home delivery joint. Price should be less but they set their prices like standard restaurant. Whoever will order here, definitely gonna ask for return money.

I ordered a pancake from this new place in area after much reluctance. But it turned out to be surprisingly well. 
It had all the elements in right order and proportions,the pancake was soft and fluffy and pretty large and appetising, with chocolate topping

And guess what they send a small cup of fruits in cute packaging ðŸ˜Š

Order no 1134195067 on 13.12.2017.
One of the tasty foods available. However, the Rajma which is part of the thali needs to be improved drastically or else customers will stop the food. The rajmah preparation seemed to contain everything (chole, pilses etc) and very less of Rajmah.

No value for money.

Pathetic experience. I ordered for the first time from this restaurant. The menu for a veg thali said it includes 2 lachha paratha, one dal makhani, on chana masal and salad. The order that i received had paneer in place of chana masala. The bread was almost uncooked and not fit to eat. After raising a complaint on zomato, i got a call back from restaurant asking for a replacement. Since my order was prepaid through paytm, when i refused to get a replacement and asked for a refund, the restaurant refused it and asked to convey to zomato support that the restaurant said so.

From zomato support, there is no prompt answer and they r not able to fix this issue.
