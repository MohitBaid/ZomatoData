A place to satisfy your need for everything sweet, I came across this delivery-only based service through Instagram and a friend recommending it and it became on of my favorite places to order from.

With my first order I had the brownies from here and they were easily one of the best brownies I've had. In face they were so good that I was almost hesitant to eat the last one because I didn't want them to end. 

So for the next time when I had the Choco Chip muffins I saved a few for later, and I'm glad I did.

So if those weren't clear enough indications. let me tell you that I'm in love with this place. The brownies were perfectly balanced in terms of taste with them being not to sweet or too bitter. And they were well made too with a perfect balance of softness and crunchiness. 

I could tell from my first bite as to how fresh the Muffins were, and the quantity was good as well. 

And what more is you get all these at pretty reasonable prices.

I couldn't recommend this place enough, and if you are looking for something sweet I'd definitely recommend you to try this place out !

I‚Äôve had brownies from all over the world but by far Sugar Story‚Äôs brownies are the best. They‚Äôre full of chocolate, crunchy and just an absolute delight. The other thing worth mentioning is there Whole Wheat Banana Muffins. I am not a fan of whole wheat or banana but was forced to change my mind after tasting these fresh out of the oven muffins. Even my 4 year old nephew loves he muffins with colourful sprinkles on top! Highly recommend!

Been ordering from this place for quite a while now and I must say, this is one of the few best delivery-only restaurants I've ever ordered from.
The Brownies I had from here are one of the best Brownies I've had till now. They had the perfect balance between soft and crunchy which are missing at most of the other places nowadays plus you could tell from the first bite that they were fresh which is also why you need to make sure that you place the order a day in advance.
I also had Choco Chip Muffins from this place and they were lovely as well ! Considering the size and especially, the quality of these delicacies , I'd say they are pretty affordable.
Other things are worth noting too, the lovely and sweet packaging , how appropriate they are when it comes to delivery timings and so many others.
I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone out there and if you're into Brownies like I am, definitely a must try place for you, don't miss this one out.

As m not someone with a sweet tooth n never thought would review a venture like this but I was simply taken away by the appearance, texture and the taste of the muffins that I ordered so much so that hv to go in for repeats now for my son and husband and ya not only their whole wheat banana muffins are amazing but even their blueberry muffins are worth giving a try....... for the suagr story to unfoldüëåüëåüëå
Still reviewing them a 4.5 on 5 as I believe that there is always room for innovation and perfection... this sugar story definitely will go viralüëç

This place was suggested by a dear friend. So without further delay we ordered their brownies. Hands down the best brownies I've ever had. With the beautiful icing sugar on top, it was delicious and fudgy. I would definitely recommend it.

I came across Sugar Story on Instagram and when I read that their brownies were to die for,I straightaway ordered a dozen for a friend whose birthday gift was pending for weeks.

Right from placing the order upto the delivery,the service was seamless and impeccable.

My friend and his family loved the brownies and said that he hasn't had better in a looong time.

I can't wait to try more goodies from this place.Lovely experience!

I am not someone who has a sweet tooth and only like to eat at places that absolutely fit my bill. Having eaten the muffins/ brownies/ cakes of sugar story, I can safely say that this is one of the best I have had,their cakes are a perfect balance between melt in the mouth, light texture and the right amount of sweet/ flavour. I would easily compare it to some of the best bakeries around the world and say that Sugar Story stands out!

Sometimes expressing something too good becomes a very difficult task. Sugar story surpasses the best that the city has to offer. Made from the heart, it always leaves you wanting for more. This story always ends on the sweetest note.
