I had ordered food from zaika, garia several times and it was okay. But last night I was extremely disappointed by their service. First of all we had ordered Chicken Tengri Kabab and had specified repeatedly to make it as Lee's spicy as possible. They delivered very spicy Chucked tanddori. When er pointed this out they told us to keep the dish and that they would replace it with our original order. We have waited till 3:30 today. They have not replaced and have kept on postponing the order . I thought that this should be brought to the notice of other people so that people don't differ like us.

The food is very tasty and so is the service. The waiters are very well-behaved. The ambience is pleasant as well. The owner is also very friendly.

A very nice small mughlai shop. Amazing for take out. The Biriyani is the best I've had in a long time. 
Would ask anyone I know to try the place.

A small, quaint take out shop located in Narendrapur serving amazing Mughlai food. The kebabs were juicy and tender while the biryani was one of the best I've ever had. 
Would highly recommend it to others

The food was absolutely delicious.     
 And the service was great as well.  
 Now I know where I'll be the next time I'm in Kolkata.   
 Will definitely recommend Zaikaa to my friends.
 (:

Excellent food and amazing service. Although I always look for decor in a restaurant but in this one the food took my attention. Must try for students.

The food is awesome. I simply loved the ambience and the service of their staff. One of the best and most economical places to dine, in And around Garia.

Great value for its cost. Service is fast and good too. Must try it's Biriyani, Tangri kababs and tandoori chicken. Delivery is quick. But make sure to tell the delivery person if he needs to bring change.
