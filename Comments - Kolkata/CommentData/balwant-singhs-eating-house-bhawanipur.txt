This place is mainly famous for being in service 24*7.. heard they make good tea but only realised how really good they are once I had it myself! And one more thing I loved was their dudh-cola!! 
You will like this place but be prepared to be served in the most indigenous way!

Had a wonderful adda over chai here last night. A very popular late night food joint. Serves great Tea, Tadka. Decor is not that great. But if you are looking for some chai in a cold winter night, visit here to enjoy the warmth.

For everyone working and living in New Delhi, it was an occasion by itself, to make our monthly trip to Amrik Sukhdev, in Murthal to have a fill of paranthas and Lassi. Having left Delhi in 2015, I used to crave for those parantha every other day and things would get worse for me in winter's. Then one of my colleagues, took me to Balwant Singh's, for a cup of tea, the tea was something else, it was familiar and felt like something, I couldn't quite put my finger on. 1st Jan 2018, after spending an eventful new year's Eve with my better half, chatting and having sausages for dinner, I was kind of craving for the kesar tea, so I took her to Balwant singh's. We had 2 cups and I noticed a tables inside the place, I couldn't help but ask if they serve breakfast and what is the menu. Paranthas, they said and I ordered a plate of Paranthas, Chhole Bhature and 2 big Lassi. They first bite of the parantha, brought back so many happy memories and the gulp of lassi, it made me question, am I in Kolkata,or a dhaba along NH2 in Punjab somewhere. I will not be able to review this place with a simple good or bad, hence the long story. I will recommend this place to anyone who is back from Delhi NCR and craving for proper tandoor baked Paranthas.

Balwant singh is just incomplete withouth uttering "doodh cola" and "tea", and thats what it is special for, wonderful taste. Regarding the rest of food items on the menu there is nothing muchto say as the dishes are cooked in a punjabi style the does tastes good but a bit highly priced. Ambience is like okayish.

The name says it all. This typical Punjabi Dhaba is mainly famous for kesar Chai and doodh-cola. The foods are slightly overrated according to the taste and price. The snacks items are good like nimki, samosa and the hot imarti. But the Chai is love.‚ù§Ô∏è So is the doodh-cola! üëåYou can have 2-3 medium cups of Chai easily. üòã
Haven't tried their doodh-maaza, recently heard about it. The next visit will be for this and the seasonal sarso da sagg and makki di roti! ü§§

Seating area is pretty good. Ambience can be improved by installing good music system and proper decor. Food is really good with the original Punjabi taste and feel. Loved the Dal Tarka and Milk Cola was equally wonderful. Crockery can be improved too. Proper care needs to be taken as long as service and promptness of the staff is concerned.

I don't know they think they are running free food station as they can take whatever time they want and whatever quality food they will give and in fact they have not provided the whole order and they miss behaved and being really rude.  Balwant Singh Dhaba owner should realize that they are in service industry and they should hire or keep staff who are well behaved at least and nuts not with me I saw every people irate in that hotel.  And staff are damn rude and they don't even know how to behave. I should have given minus rating

It's not a five star restaurant. It's not even a fine dining one. The place has no AC. It is not super hygeinic. Then why did I give it a 5*??                                  Because of the food they served that managed to impress four hard-core meat lovers. Let me tell you one thing first. I am a non vegetarian. I don't like veg. But their food made me rethink about my liking. 
We went there around 3.30pm. It is on the lane left  of Elgin more if you are coming from Hazra. The place was already bustling with people. We took out seats at a table. But as a group of 10 came in, we had to shift to another smaller table. 
Anyway, we quickly ordered Kadhai Paneer, Gobi Masala, Dal makhani, Butter Naan. The service was pretty fast. Soon we were given our plates and we were served soon after. What amazed me first was the sight of butter naan. Nowhere have I seen the naan actually shining with the butter that the naan was prepared on. The naan was smelling of butter too. As we started having our meal, we were astounded at how delicious each and every item was. 
The Dal makhani was nice and creamy. The Kadhai Paneer has the right zing from the capscium and onion. And the gobi masala tasted superb too. Each of the dish was lovely to say the least. We were super impressed. After that we also ordered a tandoori roti, a chai and 2 gulab jamuns. We couldn't stop eating. The bill was not much. It came up to 840bucks. There was some problem with the bill as they printed a wrong dish. But it got sorted quickly. 
Last but not the least, what turned out to be a perfect ending to perfect meal was the Chai. It was just perfect. No words can describe that. 

P.S. They don't charge tax and even though service is efficient, they are not super attentive.

I give this place 5.5 for just the tea and samosa. The tea is made with buffalo milk which is not found anywhere else in this part of Kolkata as far as my knowledge goes. The food is also typical Punjabi dhaba food and so is the ambience. But if you are a foodie, head for this joint.

"Balwant Singh's Eating House"  located in the Heart of bhawanipur which is also know as Mini punjab(Feels like home).Comming back to Topic this place is amazing and is ideal for people of all age,starting from Tea and samosa to Indian delicates every thing is available under one roof! The place is mostly famous for its Tea and evening snacks,speacialy the early morning winters are something worth remembering the combination of cold breath with exchange of hot sip from a cup of tea will take you somewhere in heaven for few moments! Beside this all indian popular vegetarian dishes like paneer tikka,mushroom butter masala along with breads like Tandoori,naan etc and many more varieties are available here.
If u ever visit Bhawanipur give it a try! :)

Coming to the main topic : 
I didnt see the menu card and ordered randomly
Then stuffs came nd gave the card
A brief example of our hunger & passion :p 
We took hing kochuri ( excellent ) 
Sobji wasnt that good
Jilapi was horrible
Then came heart touching lassi
It made my day seriously
Lastly keshar cha ( bhare cha to sorgo ) 
Dnt miss the vintage flavour

As if you are from here you are well aware of this place already if don't better get your food goals right. This one of the eatery which is open when nothing else is. Even if someone isn't hungry still try the famous tea. Chhole Bhature, Sarso da Sag, Makai di Roti, Gobi Masala & last but not the least Bengan Bharta is some of the famous dishes here.

This food joint, though has a lot of name and fame, isnt keeping upto its standards. Tried the special aloo paratha for 70 bucks each, which was nothing but aloo paratha served with dahi and achar.
Now starting with the aloo paratha. The aloo paratha lacked aloo and even a minimum amount of spice and flavour.
Also tried the famous kesaria milk tea served here which was the only thing, i felt, that was upto the mark.

This place is at Bhawanipur...It looks like a Punjabi dhaba truely...the famous drink they offer is doodh-cola which I tried...The name suggests strange combination but it is very sweet and testy with ice cubes in it....they served it in a jug and give you earthen cups to drink it..the Kesari chai is also awesome...later I will surely try amritsari chole bhature which is also famous here..

Heard a lot about the place but not meet the expectations. Was there for dinner but the experience was worst. Ambience was average and service was quick but the quality and quantity of the food items were below average. 

We ordered Mushroom Do Pyaza and Sahi Paneer. Taste was average and so the quantity. Rate was much higher as compared to the quality and quantity. 
Then ordered Peas Pulao. Rice they served was of very low quality. 
Waste of money as you can't get value for your money.

Worst ever food of highly rated and cringy joint. Ran by surds who are complacent in selling the food in prices watever they want to. 

Ambience- Compared to the price ambience is shittier than a stinking tea stall.

Service- complertely ignorant staff and half of the staff is challenged. 

Food- worst evr had. Ordered kesar and normal chai. Kesar chai is normal chai + 4 strand of kesar for which these mc asks for 25 bucks extra. Chai is only milk , sugar and tea and they themselves accepted that its plain chai and THATS Y WE ARE FAMOUS FOR NOT ADDING ANYTHING. Living in their La la land.

Next we ordered samosa which costed us 15 bucks and tasted very bad.

Next we ordered dal makhani which was priced at 170 and termed as special. It was below average and still giving me oil belchs! 

Alingside we ordered fried rice fir Rs 100. Utterly pathetic and bland with sugar pieces.!!!!!
Also they used Bihari thick rice in it ....come on guys!

Also see the pics of plates they used to serve the things---

Seriously a shitty affair which costed me 350 all in all and a huge waste of time.

Its time to soon fasten ur belts else be ready to close ur shutters very soon.

If you want to taste real north Indian  quality food  in eastern part of India your feet should stop at BSEH Bhawanipur Kolkata.   You will find quality food which matches standard of Kesar -da-dhabba  Amritsar any day , During my last visit I discovered that owner plays very important role in day to day purchase of any cooking material purchased and is working round the clock supervising the kitchen
The success story of the best food in eastern India is due to hard work of owner which is unseen nowadays
My special menu pick is palak dal tadka & panir & not to forget. Tandoori alu & tandoori panir 
And no lunch or dinner is complete without Kesar chai or Makhan malai dressed lassi

Ordered------------ Malai Chai, Kachori- Aloo Dum, Paneer Parantha, Lassi .


The PROS :- 


In Food & Beverages- 1 of the best tea I have tasted in whole Kolkata, so much CREAMY & REFRESHING. Kachoris were perfectly crisp & 2 additional aloo dum & sabzi were tasty & were served in good quantity. Dahi was fresh which was served with Paneer Paratha. The  'Cherry on the cake' was the Lassi. Perfect Punjab di Shaan...


In Cost :- The total amount was 330/- which is very very moderate. Had a large scrumptious meal at a low cost.


In Service :- The service men were polite & cooperative. Waiting time was really less within 15 minutes. 


Additional Advantage :- Open 24x7  



The CONS:- 


In Food -  I didnt like the Paneer Paratha much. The filling of the Paratha had some taste of methi which was not going well. It can be only tasted good if you taste this with some sabzi or raita.


Deƒáor - I liked the deƒáor. Simple & sober but not  hygienic. They should concentrate on cleanliness but this can be avoided as I visited th outlet early in the morning so this might be compromised.

From a legendary place to a just another eating outlet. 

Thumbs up - The food is really good but I have noticed few things that quality is dipping these days which is not a good sign.  At one point of time I dint even of thought of going anywhere else apart from balwant Singh for Dinners because of such great quality of food at such a good price but now the prices are going up and quality is dipping. Still its a must visit for me during winters as it serves the best makke ki roti, sarson saag, and baigan bharta. Not to forget about the kebabs they are really awesome. The service is undeniably very good. 

Thumbs down - Again the prices are on the upper side  and in the Ac seating its quite steep.  The quality of the food is dipping due to which people are shifting to places like Jai hind and Sharma dhaba. 

The place is still very good but it's slowly loosing it's regulars.  I wish it fixes up the quality part.  Balwant singh is actually a landmark of that area. 

Dinner Cost for 2 - 800 -  900
Snack cost for 2 - 200-300

Balwant chai nowadays are very popular. It‚Äôs became a brand , people in Audi‚Äôs and BMW are coming to have tea over here but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs chai is so good that worth to be pay this much what we are paying . You get much much better chai in this price around our city and even less price than this place . My personally favourite chai near bhoothnath and ATS near Xaviers College . I have given less marks cuz it‚Äôs only a brand now , a brand needs to perform and prove its worth why we are giving so much of price . But I think it‚Äôs not the worth giving so much to chai like this one .

We visited the place for a navami breakfast. Amazed to say that the quality didn't drop amidst the pujo. We were a group of 5. Ordered 2 alooo Parantha and 2 plates of kachouri and their famous doodh cola. The food was hot and served the four of us well. The alooo Paratha was heavy enough for one us and was served with achaar and yoghurt. The kachouri was served with a alooo sabji. All were great to taste. Their doodh cola was exceptional and served for a great dessert. 

Will definitely visit again!

When the town sleeps, Balwant Singh Dhaba keeps awake to serve the night owls, the night wanderers. A place which serves amazing hot tea, and much more amazing doodh-cola, a fusion drink made by mixing hot milk with cold cola, and average food, this place has made up a reputation for itself. The food was served to us hot, we went there for lunch, and the vegetable curry tasted just fine.

Balwant Singh's Eating House is an age old eatery for Calcatians to savour aloo paranthas and kachoris along with kesar wali chai.

The special aloo parantha served here is delicious with a generous and tasty filling, finished off in a tandoor. The kachori at Balwant is unique with its puffy texture and worth trying.

Balwant knows how to make good food but is at times inconsistent so don't be surprised if you are there on a bad day.

The ambiance (Non AC) of the eatery is disgusting, unpleasant and dirty so it would be best if you call for food in your car.

Service is just about alright and again, inconsistent. Price wise Balwant is very reasonable at about INR 100 per person for breakfast.

In spite of a few unpleasant experiences, I do recommend Balwant for a tasty breakfast after your morning jog.

We went for having tea and snacks and ended up having dinner. Paneer tikka and aloo tikka were great with tea. In main course we had yellow daal tadka, aloo do pyaza , aloo parantha and butter naan. Daal had smoky flavor like traditional dhabba. Ambience of AC restaurant at top was good and enjoyed the weekend. Will savor the taste and feel of the place longer.

Balwant Singh's Eating House is one of those places who have earned their popularity by delivering quality food with a unique flavour. However, I found it to be just another eating house. Though the Milk Cola was a unique attempt. There was nothing wowww about it. Before you visit this place, please be aware that it is a veg restaurant. The tea is pretty good here but overpriced.
We ordered Butter Tandoori Roti, Masala Kulcha, Paneer Butter Masala, Navratna Korma and Dal Makhani. Going by the name of the eatery, you would expect that the punjabi dishes would justify the name of Balwant Singh. However, I didn't find that wowww factor in any of the dishes except the Navratna Korma. The Dal Makhani neither had the real colour nor the flavour. The Paneer Butter Masala was decent. Overall, it was a decent place to eat.

Some of the people who know me always have a complain that I get pleased too easily. And to be really honest, that's true to a large extent! So when I give a restaurant (or an eating house) such a low rating, imagine the extent to which I am pissed off! üò§
.
.
Location: Right beside the Elgin Road Gurudwara.
.
.
Ambiance: The ambience at this place is a total joke. Seriously? A dirty place with some filthy hygiene conditions. The tables are not properly cleaned and even when some customer goes away after having their food, the plates are kept as it is till the next customer knocks their door and tells them to clean the mess. The waiters are tremendously ill-mannered and seriously need some training about customer handling.
.
.
I was asked 4 times by one of the waiters if I have finished my food inspite of telling that guy repeatedly that I haven't. How can even a restaurant behave like this to their customer?
.
.
A small incident that shook me! A girl was having her meal on the table next to mine. She had just finished her food and was waiting for a friend of hers. The waiter came and asked her to leave the place as she had finished her food. üòí how ridiculous is this?
.
.
After she left, the table was not cleaned for approximately 10 minutes. After that when the waiter came, he was totally ignorant of the fact that I was seating on the next table. He just poured a glass of water on the table. Even some water came to my table as well which pissed me off like hell. üòë
.
.
The staffs need some serious lesson on their rude behavior. According to me behaviour is one of the most vital things for a place to flourish and if they keep such horrendous behaviour then I am sorry to say, it's not worth even a single penny!
.
.
Food: Another joke that was absolutely not funny! I ordered Veg Pulao and Panner Tikka Butter Masala on the recommendation of the staffs over there. The whole pulao thing was a joke! No trace of salt or chili or sugar or masala was there. A pure bland preparation that I can surely skip even if I am starving!
.
.
The next biggest blunder of the day was paneer tikka butter masala. Okay let me laugh a bit! It was only oil and oil in which there were some cubes of paneer. Do you really term this as food? I mean edible item? It was one of the most disgusting items I have tasted in recent times.
.
.
Lastly I ordered their famous Lassi which was rather good. Actually this 1 rating is just for the lassi. Other than this, everything deserves a glorious minus marking!
.
.
Another thing, this place has no cutlery whatsoever. The paneer came in a foil pack and the pulao in a plate that had sections in it. I literally felt I am eating on a railway platform. üò†
.
.
And the funniest part? I paid 220 rs for that disastrous paneer and a total of 440 rs for these nonsense items. I am done! üôè
.
.
If Zomato had an option to give minus marking, I would have done so! To put it the simplest way, I completely disliked the place and would just warn everyone STAY AWAY!
.
.

Everybdy say balwant singh's chai is kolkatas famous chai. Yesterday i am going to this place & try there normal chai (25/-), 
kesar chai (50/-), 
cutting nimki (15/-), 
samosa (15/-)

Its a worst experience of mine.
Chai s are like normal street shop where we can buy chai worth Rs-10/- but here we buy the same chai worth Rs.50/-

# There service staff are not proffesional
# Tables are not clean

If you a chai lover and you are planning to go there to try special kesar chai thn its just waste of money & time.

A sudden plan in the morning landed me here. Though I was there with my cousin to have their famous kachori and jalebi. But it was late so instead we have aloo paratha, butter naan and chana masala for lunch. And literally I was in awe of the taste of their food. The best aloo paratha I've ever had. Just delicious. Visiting again very soon.

Well in a word you wonder how to describe such a good place .......and then you find the word " delectable".....A truly street food ,north indian punjabi style food that makes you lick you fingers with devotion.
I myself favour punjabi food so for me this was one hell of an experience at a reasonable budget and no compromise with taste .
So go out there have some punjabi food at Balwant Singh's eating house .

Perfect place to have an early breakfast or late night dinners . Open till 2 at night and reopens at 4 in the morning . The place is 5 mins from my residence and is always buzzing with huge groups of friends . Tea here is the most famous . The best you will have in the city . The Club Kachoris and Nimki for Breakfast is very fitting . For the lunch /dinner , DaL Makhani and Paneer Butter Masala are winners .

Wanna have the real punjabi vibes on the streets of Kolkata? Well! There's hard core punjabi dhaba in Bhawanipore, Kolkata. The tea and the lassi is extremely tantalizing. And you get evening suppers like samosa kachori parathas which is equally good. And the best part is this place is open for 24hours. So if you're hungry and hunting for food in the midnight, you need not give a second thought and hop in there. 

In frame: Lassi. (Prices of tea and lassi is according to the size of the cup)

Perfect place to have an early breakfast or late night dinners . Open till 2 at night and reopens at 4 in the morning . The place is 5 mins from my residence and is always buzzing with huge groups of friends . Tea here is the most famous . The best you will have in the city . The Club Kachoris and Nimki for Breakfast is very fitting . For the lunch /dinner , DaL Makhani and Paneer Butter Masala are winners . 

Recommended :)

That day i stopped here before going to office to have a cup of tea as i was having a severe headache.
I could say it was the best tea i ever had.
And moreover i couldnt resist myshelf from having jelebi and kachuris.
Yeah it is the perfect place to munch over for the perfecr breakfast to start a day.
A must visit place.
Situated on the harish mukherjee road, along side the gurudwar.
Now it has become my often juntion to stop by to have a cup of tea.
A bhar of tea costs Rs 15.
But the tea worth the value.
This place is very much pocket friendly.
A bhar of tea with a plate of kachuri and jelebi costs Rs 60.
This place has great quality food.

One of the best restaurants offering excellent vegetarian fare at reasonable prices.
It stays open pretty late in the night and also opens very early in the morning. So rest assured of a late dinner or early morning cuppa from here.
Dishes to try out Specially Fried Tadka (with extra Butter), Naan or Butter Roti, Paneer Pasinda, Malai Kofta, Sarson Da Saag & Makke Di Roti (during winter), Lassi, Special Tea and their unique "Doodh Cola" which is their pioneer creation.

And the chatni or sauce (whatever it was)served with mushroom tikka was too good!!!! Mushroom tikka was also good bt i really loved that chatni.

Open till late in the night ..so,it is a very good place for night time foodies.

Only i wish the ground floor seating area was cleaner. I really they will soon look into that m@atter. That 0.5 extra was for the food.

Food was yummy and delicious especially that curd served with hot jalebies and paneer paratha.  I had been there in the early morning with my friends after a night party, believe me the food served refreshed our mood and we were set to go again ;) 
The location is good as it is situated beside the main road. Yeah one negative thing about this place is its staff service and premises but thats negligible as its DHABHA ;)

Firstly I must say this has been our savior of midnight outing and hunger since ages. Some of their favorites are their paneer and aloo Parantha, mushroom kebabs and their kesariya tea. But unfortunately this place is losing its charm day by day due to a noticeable dip in their quality but touchwood their mushroom kebabs are still good. Another unique drink of this place is dudh cola ( mix of milk and cola). It might sound off too some people but it's good.

must try for their tea and kulfi.cant comment on their food have never had a proper meal.
Samosa, jalebi,kachori  in the early morning hours are on my top lists.
Also try their lassi a thick and creamy glassfull more than enough for any one with medium appetite.
Doodh cola is another favourite and also a must try for the first timers!

Awesome place for having great tea and just relax. Good dhaba type ambiance. We ordered kesar tea and samosa. After finishing the first cup we ordered regular tea. Both was very good. The samosas had a strong ginger flavour, which I liked personally. Kesar tea was ‚Çπ50, which might seem a bit high; but when you include sitting arrangements (and "adda" with your friends), it was worth every penny. Overall a great place to have a cup of tea with your buddies.

The place is good for family outing,  parking is though on road,  but its never an issue.  The real issue is getting a seat during peak hours. They have not yet installed A. C. The place is famous for mouth watering mushroom items and specialised in lassi,  dudh cola,  and tea. Service is not so good,  they do not have dedicated waiters for each table.

After a long time I visit this place with my sister . It's really easy to reach from Rabindra sadan metro station , just beside the Bhawanipur Gurdwara .

As it was raining outside , first we took 2 medium tea . It was served in earthen pot ( as u can check it in pics ) so it was very tempting for the weather .Tea was little beat little beat sweeter than previous time .

Then we ordered Lachha paratha , Masala Kulcha , Paneer Do Piaza & green salad . Kulcha & Paratha was perfect but paneer couldn't reach to my satisfaction level . The salt was less , even the tomatoed were not properly cooked . Over all the experience was nice as I meet my sister after one & half year . The behaviour & service was really good. 

And the special thing I love about Balwant is it's timing   from 4 a.m. to 3 a.m. . üòç

I went there quite a few times. It's best for late night eatings. Whenever we have cravings for tea, we head to this place. It's special tea is worth having for. On the occasion of my boyfriend's birthday , it was late In the night after cake cuttings and all so we don't have many options so ended up with this. That was around 2a.m in the night. that time also it was crowded. Sitting arrangements are quite good. As we were damn hungry we orderd Paneer Butter Masala, Malai kofta, Aloo Do Pyaza, Navarant Korma with butter nun, masala kulcha, tandoori roti & lachadar paratha. All the food items are cooked in butter & heavenly tasted. Then we have chai & dodh cola . Overall a good place to eat in the middle of the night.

Punjabi Veg Dhaba located near Bhawanipur Gurudwara. This is a place where I frequently visited,for me it's one of  the best adda place in Kolkata with friends. After a hectic schedule tea and samosa over there with friends is something priceless. Heard about there doodh cola but didn't tried it yet,but soon will be. Over all experience is good.
Highly recommended.

This is one of the must go places in Kolkata. Being a dhaba the food is good. The Chaos will add to the beauty of the place. The Kesari chai and doodh Cola needs a special mention. Doodh Cola is a must try out for every college gang.

Headed to this place after reading all the great reviews it has garnered over time and primarily to try out the special drink doodh cola which ultimately I had to give up since they serve minimum one litre of it and I was alone with tummy full from sharmas kachoris :) The small eating place was packed with people on a Sunday morning, as expected. I feel they can definitely improve the hygiene and cleanliness few notches , in spite of the budget offerings it has. Ordered GulabJamun and lassi which took quite some time to arrive and the GulabJamuns were not served hot , to my disliking though tasted fine. Again the lassi served in a clay glass could have been sweeter and more flavorful, I felt rather than the sweet and sour taste which dominated it. Overall it was a very neutral experience at this place.

After planning a lot of times and failing to achieve this was me and my friends first visit to this outlet, our main attraction of going there was their so called famous dudh cola but we ended up taking butter paneer masala, malai kofta, Gujarati alu dam and tandoori roti. Let's begin with their dudh cola, in one word this prep is oddly satisfying, typically good but unique in taste, raw flavour of milk along with the fizz of cola, talking about other preparation they are just awesome, all the gravies were lipsmacking, specially the kofta one, that gravy was unique, and every prep was having that strong buttery taste and aroma of methi, was real good, recommended for every one.@ dudh cola is sold liter wise, so don't expect it to be a glass full of rather than expect it to be jug full of dudh cola.

The original "hungry after late night movie" hangout - that too a drive in.

Only issue is, damn difficult to find a place to park if you're visiting between 12am and 2am. Once you do manage to squeeze in, order a plastic jug of Doodh Cola, or Lassi in clay mugs. The Kesar Chai is another must have. Sink your teeth into hot Kesar Jalebis or Gulab Jamuns, or hot and crispy Samosas.

This place has a cult following, one of those Kolkata experiences that you need to have.

Visited this place with lot of expectations ... but was disappointed bigg time ..! 

The place is too tacky ! N environment is very dirty n un-hygienic.. GOOD for only hangouts with friends not family... the food is OKAY n only VEG ! yes drinks available might impress u.. varieties of tea n famous dodh cola is worth a try but not the food ! 

Only plus point y it is the talk of the town is its timing of service. Its open 24*7 offering food at feasible rates ! So CAN BE TRIED IN CASE U FALL SHORT OF OPTIONS LATE NIGHT !

Being an ardent fan of Dhaaba food, I had to try this place after reading so many reviews and all the recommendations by my friends. We were a group of 5 guys.. went out on saturday midnight ¬†to try ....
Started with their famous Doodh Kola.. it just blew me away.. Nothing unusual.. but the milk did all the trick... Slow boiled milk brought flavour of the malai out... 5 out of 5 ..

Then we tried Kashmiri Aloo ¬†Dum, Paneer Butter Masala, Tadka Dal, Malai kofta...¬†
The taste of the food is excellent... ¬†Except for kashmiri Aloo Dum, which was a tad greasy and taste was not as expected, rest of the dishes were mind blowing..¬†
But a big let down is their Rotis. It was all maida.. We asked for butter rotis initially... Two of us wanted crisp rotis... but finally when the bread arrived after the food, it was all soft and floppy... not to my liking...¬†
Our repeat order for rotis took around 25 mins.. Can understand the delay being the weekend... ¬†But using maida instead of aata was a bit disappointing...¬†

We finished with their famous kadak kullad chai and malai lassi..¬†
The chai counter is on the main road level... these kullads were flying...¬†

Over all very very satisfying... 4 out of 5 is over all.. if the rotis were good, then they deserve 5 out of 5...

Intro - Just beside Gurudwara at SSKM hospital crossing is this dhaba known for special tea and vegetarian food 

Food : 
Had what this joint is known for - tea - medium sized kullar - and yes the tea is amazing - the taste unique and superb .
Thing to note is that they don't boil the tea directly - water boils in a big pot and small jugs with the tea mixture is kept in that pot and it boils indirectly! 4.5/5

I love their chole bhature & seasonal saags on offer. Although the place remains heavily crowded & parking's a little challenging, u don't mind waiting for ur turn. And this corner of Kolkata transports me back to my own saddi Delhi with so much of North Indian wali accents floating around..

Nestled below the Elgin Gurudwara, this all-vegetarian eat house is the go to place for those binge time cravings. Be it tea, be it snacks, be it paranthas, this place got it all. But the midnight time factor isn't the only good thing, it also has a good old menu enough to give hunger a good beating. The food isn't something special, but still has a taste hard to find anywhere else in Kolkata. Although its tastes keep varying with time to time, the Doodh Cola continues to be the superstar. Seasonal offerings such as Sarso da Saag and Makki di Roti are a treat away from home. Not really a time oriented place but would still suggest to visit it after dark.

Shockingly terrible food and atrociously high priced. The paneer bhujia was bland and tasteless and the tandoori‚Äã stuffed alu seemed like it had been marinating with stale curd. Dal makhani was equally bad. Ended up with a huge bill of 1850 for rubbish.

Date of Visit ‚Äì 15/02/2017

Location ‚Äì Located on Harish Mukherjee Road, just beside Bhowanipore Gurudwara. 

Ambience ‚Äì   They serve you in your car, there is a non air conditioned seating space in ground floor and also have an air conditioned seating space in 1st floor. We preferred air conditioned seating space. Interiors were average, nothing great to talk about. Air conditioner just above us was not working.

Service ‚Äì Though pricing is of a dine in, but service was of a dhaba. They just kept the food on table and left. No serving. Service was not satisfactory.

Food & Description ‚Äì It was a Wednesday afternoon, we went there after a meeting at nearby place. We straight away went to the ac seating area at 1st floor. Coming straight to the food :

Veg Kabaab Platter  ‚Äì It a kabaab platter which contains small portions of all varieties of kabaabs. It had Mushroom Tikka, Paneer tikka, Veg Seekh Kabaab & Tandoori Aloo(stuffed). All the kabaabs were well cooked and tasted very good. But the presentation was very clumsy. All the items were overlapping each other. But the size of the platter was huge. 1 platter good for 4 people.

Mixed Vegetables ‚Äì It tasted great. But as all dhabas the vegetables had lot of oils. Serving size is big. 

Kadhai Paneer ‚Äì Kadhai Paneer was awesome. Again the gravy was too oily. Paneer were soft. 

Dal Makhani ‚Äì I personally didn‚Äôt liked the dal makhani here. 

Garlic Nan ‚Äì It was soft and tasty.

Butter Fulka ‚Äì When it was served it was not that hot and soft. But I love fulkas, so liked it. 

Overall the experience was good. Service was okish. Food is tasty but be prepared to have it with loads of oil. Not recommended for the proper lunch or dine in, but can be tried for late night food or early morning breakfast.

Pocket Pinch - 800 for 2 approx.

Been here last saturday i.e. 11/03/17 for post morning walk tea.

Very over-priced... Rs. 25/- for per bhaanr tea... 
Although the tea tastes good.. but the bhaanrs (clay cups) are not washed with water before serving tea ... N i saw that one of those bhaanrs had clay dust at he bottom of it & tea was poured over it.
The cleanliness of the restaurant was not very satisfactory.

A vegetarian only punjabi dhaba. Located near Bhawanipur Gurudwara. Been there few days back. We ordered Aloo Paratha & Channa Masala. Both were delicious. But, there was a waiter who took our order and served. When we got the bill, it was more than the price that we ordered for. When we asked about it, the waiter said that he had served 'Special Aloo Paratha' along with Curd & Pickle while we hadn't ordered any speciality. In this situation, another waiter came & apologized for that. He told us to talk with the manager. We talked to him. He also apologized and asked me to pay the actual amount without speciality. I have a suggestion for the management. Kindly standardize all the staffs and provide the speciality dish 'Doodh-Cola' for individuals also. Waiting for the next visit there.

The older the better? Not true in this case. 

After a really long time, I visited the famous Balwant Singh's Dhaba. 

Food - Kachori sabzi: The kachoris were not at all warm, however, they were big in size. The sabzi tasted okayish. Being a regular brekky option, I have had definitely better than this. 

Veg grill sandwich: This was extremely bad. The bread was barely grilled and it was still soggy. The filling was okayish.

Samosa: I loved their samosa. Good filling of aloo & crisp on the outside. Although I forgot to take a picture. 

Adrak tea: If its not piping hot, it spoils the taste. So it did. Although, the taste of ginger was apt in the tea. 

Ambience: We sat on the ground floor which looks like any other dhaba. Not much clean. 

Hospitality: The staff seemed unhygienic but attentive to our demands. 

Overall experience: Its one of the oldest dhabas of the city & seeing them serve this kind of food is extremely annoying. Never visiting them again.

Best late night eatery for quick snacks, tea, some Indian sweet dish. Located at bhawanipur main road, this has been an age old dhaba which serves some kick-ass late night kadak chai. Just what you need to get your head working after a heavy work schedule or late night parties. The samosa and imrati here are most well known and in huge demand for their original desi taste! Never been disappointed at this place. If you are looking for hygiene , then this is not your place but if you are ready to overlook it just for the love of chai and nostalgia then this is the place you should be.

Whenever I am in Kolkata, this place is my regular haunt at least once every morning for their kulhad chai and if possible sometimes in the evening too.¬†

Hoards of cars are parked here as they serve in cars too.¬†

Undoubtedly it serves the best tea in my view. Though Sharma Tea House is also just opposite and equally popular and busy, Balwant is much better with its unique taste.

There have been times when I have had at Sharma but just didn‚Äôt get the satisfaction and came to Balwant for their chai.

I have also had the Samosa here, which is very good and perfect with chai. Though at Rs. 15 it seems more pricey than other joints serving in Kolkata.

Food I have had the Paneer Tikka here and enjoyed. Other foods people say its not very good and hence haven‚Äôt tried.¬†

They also seem to be very popular with their sandwiches as while having my morning tea, people seem to be ordering the sandwiches.

They also have the quintessential Kolkata snacks of Kachori Subzi, Nimki which a lot of morning walkers cherish.¬†

Its also open 24x7 and is a frequent place for Nightclub crowd.¬†

Go for the chai (Rs. 25 for a medium size kulhad) and you wont be disappointed.

Amidst the hustle bustle of the city..between the rush,chaos and confusion there's this Balwant Singh serving you the most delicious food and in an affordable price. The best ¬†thing here is the Milk Cola where you can taste milk and cola separately in one glass! This one place surely awaits every foodie out there. :) ;)

A tried and tested place by many and visited often by me whenever its on my way. Tea and its numerous varients are their speciality. Had piping hot delicious samosa, stuffed aloo paratha with curd, stuffed paneer paratha, chole batura, club kachori and lassi. Each item is amazing and always served hot. Special mention of club kachori is that it was really crisp and served hot with aloo sabji which was very tasty. Will try out all items from menu eventually !! Food can be had in your car parked right outside or their restaurant premises. Prices are also reasonable for the food quality. Always gone home smiling from Balwant's.

Recently i have visited there and had few parathas. I have ordered aloo paratha comes with curd. Aloo stuffed tandoori paratha with fresh curd is one of my fav item. Butter tandoori roti,butter tadoori paratha are eually finger licking and all are just worth for your money. Must recommended.

This is one of the very famous places in the Bhawanipur area. Hence the heavy crowd early in the morning. They offer quite a number of items in their breakfast menu.
Since this is a typical eating house, there's nothing special about the ambiance. Service is swift.
Ordered a plate of Club Kachoris. They were okay. Aloo Paratha - Tandoor and Tawa Tossed. I preferred the Tawa one more. And a plate of Chole Bhature - favourite from among all.

Being a vegetarian restaurant and yet maintaining such high standard of foods is really tough , but this place seems to do that with ease. 
Very near to my workplace,  my dinner is often spent here  !! 
And the lassi and the kesar tea is just like the slice of butter to the taste ! 
Everybody must try the lasso at least once here !! And tea at midnight is pure bliss.

Samosa is one of life's simple joy. It's the best Indian snack ever and best made at Balwant's. Piping hot samosas and a refreshing cup of tea or lassi is all what you need after a long drive. If one does not want to go in then they can simply Park their car and eat in peace. Price is also reasonable :)

The doodh cola is served in Jugs of 1 liter minimum so take a friend along. Charges Rs 150. No tips are charged. The place is near Rabindra Sadan, Metro Subway Gate of SSKM. ¬†Overall the taste of this Doodh Cola is a unique one but just like any restaurant the charge seemed high. Overall it is a good experience savoring this unique taste. The restaurant is clean ans spacious and also well lit. Staff clean and well behaved.. A good place for a family get together.

'Balwant Singh's Eating House' is located just crossing of Harish Mukherjee Road & Sambhunath Pandit Street,near Bhawanipur Gurudwara.I'd been there few times but I've to forgot give the review in zomato.I've tasted their Samosa,it tastes good,their tea is tasty.Specially Kesar Tea is very tasty.I've not tried their special Doodh Cola yet,because is's quantity huge.Next time I'll try their Doodh cola.Price is reasonable.Food service is too fast.

Located near bhawanipur gurudwara.  
This place is very very famous its north indian taste. 
Went there for an early breakfast.  
We tried the aloo paratha which was very tasty and flavorfull srlerved which curd.  
The club kachori was next which was soo fitting and yummy.  
My favorite was the chole bhature.  Wow,  amazing taste. The Amritsari chole Bhatura was very very tasty and surely something to recommend for.  

The service was good. 
Pocket pinch was comparatively reasonable.

Went for an early breakfast at this place. Ordered the small kachoris, aloo paratha and Butter Tandoori Paratha. All were pretty decent and the parathas tasted good, except for the excess oil. Also, the hot jalebis were too tempting! They have a lot of other things on offer too for a bigger apetite. So might just drop in sometime later for trying those.

This veg eatery is located at Bhawanipore , mainly serves North Indian snacks.

Poor sitting arrangements.

Service is good.

Tried Rumali roti , Aloo jeera and their famous Doodh cola. All were tasty. Doodh cola is innovative and was thoroughly enjoyable. A must try item.

Pocket pinch is bit high.

Balwant Singh Eating House is one of the best breakfast spot in Bhawanipur. Come and try their Parathas they are excellent. We tried their Aloo Paratha it was so good, came in five mini parathas in a plate with Aloo Sabji and Curd.
Butter Tandoori roti was equally good. And the Butter Tandoori Paratha was another excellent thing.
They also make delicious Jilebi.

Sitting arrangments are very poor..we orderd Club kacchori,aloo paratha,milk tea and hot gulapjamun.
no.1 is Club kacchori..its taste very bad and its comes to 5/6 small panipuri like..with a aloogravy and its price ‚Çπ30...No.2 is Aloo paratha..its better than  my moms handmade alooparatha...and its comes to 4pieces with dahi and some khatta chatni..very bad to taste this..No.3 is Milk tea..its nice..but if u looks about its price...oh! my god...‚Çπ15.. its better than you go to the southern avenue near the swimming club..a roadside teashop that sets opposite of the North & South.. the milk tea price ‚Çπ5 and its just awesome...
Now lastone is Hotgulapjamun-it looks nice..hot,but again the price issues...i didn't remember the accual price but not appropriate for this gulapjamun.

This is a nostalgic place for me, being one of the oldest and famous eateries in town. Their service is really good and very fast served, though every food is served hot and fresh. The taste is really very authentic and their seasonal specialities- sarso da saag and makki di roti, are my all time favourite. But it also is famous for the very basic snacks "chai and samosa" which they make awesome. Also its open all night and as I often go for a long drive late at night, it serves at that time too. The ambience is very basic and local.

Come here for a satisfying north Indian dinner. Come how hungry you may be, it will satisfy it. Nothing fancy in food nor with interiors but they do the basics correctly. Some here for authentic maki ka roti and sarso da saag as well.

Panner tikka was good. Panner doh pyaza was also good but the Malai kofta was the best. Will like if the deserts menu is expanded a bit more

Pathetic is under statement.. After hearing favorable reviews tried this place on a Sunday afternoon with family.. Ground floor was unbearable in terms of hygiene issues hence chose to sit on level 1.. The place wasn't full but then also I have to continuously call the staff to take the order... As you enter there are printouts all over the place for trying out season's special so I while ordering from season's special menu  baigan bharta, Gobi masala etc... I was told its not available.. So ordered some other dishes... After some time I was informed that dish I have ordered is not available.. What took them so long to figure that out??.. Then again while getting the order on table I was told some other stuff also is not available... Seriously where am I ?? Are you running a restaurant or its free meal distribution.. So I have to actually eat something which I wasn't that much keen on since half of stuff on menu wasn't available or cancelled in the order.. While asking the manager he mentioned that they don't make those stuffs for lunch and wait staff mentioned first that its over and later said it not available at all neither in lunch or dinner.. Now coming to food seriously overrated just oil and tasteless.. How can someone go wrong on dal makani and sarson saag if you claim you to be authentic north India dhaba food... It was really a let down and I wasted my time and actually had to go to some other place to eat something tasteful.. My recommendation AVIOD...

One of the finest place to hookup with friends in the earliest morning of Kolkata! and the highway wala dhaba feeling will make your day definitely! Price is very low. Foods are good. Club kachori and parathas and tea are must try.

O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D thats what it is. Don't even know what the hullabaloo is all about. The groundfloor was dirty. Papers and napkins littered all over. One cup of tea costs Rs. 25 and with two strings of kesar will make it shoot up to Rs. 50. And not to mention the tea was one of the worst I had. The vendors in Dalhousie make better ones. It was so tasteless and light didn't feel like a tea at all. Next comes the very famous dudh-cola. Well where was the doodh in it??? The local milkman would make your milk less adulterated with water. Lots of water with may be a spoonfull of milk and some cola. Guys you can name it as paani cola.And 150 bucks for it... Seriously??? And this is your signature dish??? " Make chai not war" i guess you should atleast live by it before you put it up on your waiter's tee. Needless to say never visiting it again. I wish I could rate it less than 1.In short...."Paaji ne toh hamari le li!!!!üòèüò†üò†üò†üò§ü§¢"

Talking about balwant singh dhaba, it is one of the iconic eateries in kolkata by now. Although their services are deteriorating and the ground floor is always in a messy and unclean situation, some loyal patrons will never stop going and praising their food. The food is okay, to be honest. Talking about the iconic doodh cola, I do not really like it anymore. They were something a few years back but now they are losing that  magnetism.

The only thing I had there was the 'Doodh Cola', which our teacher praised a lot. So my rating is for that only. First up how on earth do people have that pathetic thing. Its milk and cola. Absolute nonsense. The taste was pathetic. The only reason I am giving 0.5 more is for the parathas that I saw on the next table.

Balwant Singhs Eating house is one of the most renowned dhaba/eatery in Kolkata. Primarily its location, which is in a very busy area, acted as a catalyst to all the hubub it created. Without a doubt it can be claimed that it has lived up to its name. The food offered by the eatery has a track record of obliging the taste buds of the foodies. I myself have tried the legendary Kesar Tea and the signature beverage named as 'DOODH-COLA'. The kesar tea has done justice to the hard-earned name of the place as it is unparalleled(due to the special method of preparing it). The 'Doodh-Cola' was equally tempting but I was not overjoyed to taste it.
So my reviews for these two will be
Kesar Tea - 5/5
Doodh-Cola- 3.5/5

Saw this interesting place on my way...and stopped for a steaming cup of tea...I blame it on the weather as I am not a chai person...had their normal chai and the strong flavour bowled me over and couldn't resist trying a new variant ! Hence ordered a cup of saffron tea!! This too was amazing just that it smells like saffron and has a stronger flavour of tea! So people who like their cups flavoured really strong should go for it! I have heard a lot about their kachodis so will surely try them in my next visit! Also try parking right in front of the dhaba to avoid parking charges!

The tea ‚ù§‚ù§
It is famous for its tea all over Kolkata. If you happen to be loving desi chai, this place is a must visit. The food here tastes wonder. Had Samosa here, and it was wonderful! Most of the samosas in Kolkata is prepared in a very different way than what I prefer to have, but this place pleased my taste buds with its samosa again!
Next time, I am going to have a proper dining here.

How could I miss reviewing this famous place! They serve veg food only but people flock here like crazy to have the special kachoris, tea and doodh cola - ¬†Balwant Singh's signature items!
Interior is absolutely basic but decently spacious. If this place is not in your wishlist, you are missing it!

Balwant Singh is a hub for vegetarians.. It is open 24 hours. It is located just near the Gurudwara.  The lassi is a must try. Although the special cola lassi wasn't upto mark. Roti and tadka is the cheapest yet delicious thing to order here.  The aloo paratha is heavenly. I had also tried the jeera aloo and gobi ki sabji(this is seasonal) which was also equally tasty. The service is amazing. Must visit at least once.

I went there a couple of times and each time I went there they asked different rates for the same chai.The rate is not even shown anywhere and everytime you ask the person at the counter what is the price he will conjure up a new price.Also there is a huge mismatch between the quality and the price of the chai.

This place has been the saviour of my hunger pangs, late night cha cravings or simply a session of adda over steaming bhanr (earthen cups) of their special cha and singara. I have been witness to the growth of Balwant all my life, having grown up in the area. And what started as a small eatery next to the Bhawanipore Gurdwara sahib is not a roaring restaurant dishing out amazing north Indian dishes. Their special tadka is to die for.... And it has so much home made butter it could clog your artery instantly.... But in the most delicious way! I am a massive fan of their paneer tikka, their butter naan which according to me the best on town! And their tea..... Served in massive bhanr  one is enough to sustain you your entire thek. And thr taste is simply superb!

NOTHING BUT DOODH COLA!
What an amazing experience! Had known and been to this place a number of times. It was one of the most desired  places I wanted to visit either during Durga Pujas. When you're tired after Pandal Hopping and want some snack at 2 AM this is the best place to be! Thei Chai and snacks are really relieving. Same with Diwali , when you're tired of bursting crackers. Mostly visited at night. But today I had their Doodh cola. It costs rs 150 for 1L . it was like 6 cups of doodh cola in that. Amazing taste. Cannot be copied by anyone else. Must visit place in Kolkata!

Balwant Singh is a place I'm sure every calcuttan has visited atleast once, it's a typical dhaba, the dishes one must try here are : 

Paneer tikka 
Aloo tikka 
Mushroom tikka 
Paneer butter masala 
Kaali daal 

Apart from this, I doubt I need to mention doodh cola as it is a trademark of this dhaba and this one only. The timings are best for your midnight hunger solutions and overall a good place to go to if you're looking to chill in your car with friends.

P.S. It's a vegetarian restaurant as it is connected to a gurudwara.

I've made many memories here.This place is a first of many sorts from being open to almost anytime of the day to giving Calcutta a default culinary experience of dining inside one's own car to serving the best chai in town( well,that was once upon a time),this place has earned a spot in the memories of an entire generation!
It's a favourite for morning walkers ,students ,bikers,car racers & late night party hawks .
Honestly,if you're going for the food here,you'll be disappointed,oily & way off the mark.
The famous tea is just that,famous not flavourful like say 5-6 years back & don't be fooled by the humble exteriors of the place,it"'ll pinch your pocket just like another restaurant.
Wanna go there,Go for the experience,rows of cars,buzzing with bikers,youngsters,great gossip among steaming bhaands of chai served right into your car in a jiffy.

A late review.. Moving back to Ashtami night... 1am... This place came to my mind when hunger took over me.... I had never been to this place hence I got a chance to be there with someone who is a regular... A long queue was there before us as expected and we had to wait for about 45minutes but the food was worth the wait... We were directed to the first floor where we ordered paneer and naan which were both awesome... Since it was Durga Puja I would like to keep the review minimum till I visit the place the next time when the crowd is a bit lesser...
This place however is highly recommended.
Thumbs up- taste in spite of the puja rush.
Behavior of the staff.

Usually ppl go for car orders here. But they do also have restaurants for sit down dining. Famous for tea and snacks, but, my favourite is the doodh cola!! Its simply unbelievable and amaZing. In one portion they give one jug filled which can easily be shared by 6-7pppl!! 
My sit down dining experience hasnt been auite nice as they serve very spicy food. But overall experience is fantastic.

This place is famous for its tea, park your car in front of the restura and you will have to signal the boys to take your order. The restaurant as such is not very clean, we visited on the morning of Dashumi (Durga Puja). For the traditional breakfast with small kachouri, usually u expect the place to be clean in the morning hours, which lacked here.. The serving was slow and very clumsy. 
Food was average.. But tea was refreshing.

This place was really close to where I was staying. Adjacent to the Gurudwara, Balwant Singh's Eating House is the best place to enjoy a nice meal. Since I was a but short of time I only had the chance to enjoy a nice Kulhad Wali Chai. Now this Chai was something very unique as I have never seen tea being poached. By poached I mean milk, tea leaves and water are mixed in a steel pot and then this pot is put in a vat of boiling water in which the tea is heated. The flavor of the tea was perfect and it was really strong or as we call it "kadak". 
I would definitely love to visit this place for a nice meal next time I am in Kolkata

Balwant Singh's Eating House is not only just about food. It's about the carefree dhaba atmosphere it creates right at a busy street junction in Kolkata, highly unlikely. Even with people packed up, you are bound to feel easy and relaxed. Either sipping the Kesar Chai or the Lassi along with your friends with a lot of adda, or comfortably eating your meal in your car with the super staffs bringing it to you. Balwant's is the old school lovable dhaba.

If you are hungry late night , then this is the place for you. Located near Gurudwara and Golmandir in Elgin Road, this place is famous for its unique "Doodh-Cola". Its a must try. Dal makhni, Aloo paratha, Aloo Do Piaza are recommended. Also try Makki di roti and Sarson da Saag. Quantity enough to serve 2-3 people. Not very clean always, but it can be managed. Staff service is a little slow. Hence I rate 3 out of 5.

This place is located right adjacent to the Bhowanipore Gurudwara. They serve the best aloo tikkas and doodh cola in Kolkata.

If you visit this place anytime during the day or night ( it hardly shuts down ), you will find it difficult to find parking space. 

They are very consistent in terms of taste and quality. And the quantity is very good too.

We went for a tikka and doodh cola session last week. The way the serve the tikkas is just the same and the condiment they serve with it ( made of coriander and curd ) is outstanding. We ordered the aloo, mushroom and Paneer tikkas. 

All were amazing, only mushroom tikka hardly had mushroom pieces so it was not worth the price. Aloo and Paneer had sufficient pieces.

The doodh cola or doodh fanta has been invented by Balwant Singh eating house. This concoction of Coca-Cola and chilled milk on the rocks has a great mass appeal. It's a great stomach cleanser and people prefer to end their meal with it.

Balwant Singh's eatery  has some of best kachori-subji of the town to offer along with that their parathas are quite good and they are more like the spiced potato stuffed naan  served along with boondi-spiced up curd & pickle. The chai is considered to be good but not the best I would say and yes I missed the chance of having doodh cola which is their speciality, so can't comment on that. Overall they have a bit pricey menu, may be because they haven't compromised with the taste.

This place is only good for doodh cola and nothing else and they doesn't even give printed bills but written ones :3

Located in Harish Mukherjee Road, Balwant Singh's Eating House did not quite live upto my expectations. The Dudh Cola for which it is very famous was fantastic but they should start serving various quantities at various prices rather than serving one premium quantity at 150/- . The Tandoori Roti, Paneer Butter Masala and Palak Paneer were all okayish. Try the Aloo Parantha which is fantastic but you'll required to pay an extra 20 bucks for the pickle which is a bit audacious. Altogether a disappointing experience for me.

Highly over hyped is the least one could say.¬†

For tea its the best - but for dinner , i would say a big "NO"

We ordered Gujrati Aloo Dum & Methi Malai - both were cold as if they have been prepared long time back. Both were "Yuck - hopelessly bad), Garlic Nan was OK.

The worst part is the charges - for a dirty environment, things lying here & there, dirty tables, the charges are on a higher side.

Surprisingly they don,t even have proper cutlery - the plates are the ones which are given at road side food stalls where one big thali is given with compartments for vegetables, achar etc.

When ¬†asked for a spoon - i was shocked with the reply " no regular spoons at our place - we have only plastic spoons and that too of such bad quality that the lips gets injured while eating with them.

strictly AVOID

Went here for dinner. 
Would not really recommend this place for a full meal. 
Dal Makhani and Paneer did not quite appeal to my taste.
The Babycorn was palatable though. That is recommended.
Even Panner tikka was nice.

PS: They couldn't even provide us with a knife which we needed for cutting a friends birthday cake. They wrapped a spoon and asked us to cut it from behind.

It's a cool rainy day and therefore we need a hot cuppa tea to warm our souls. The best place that comes to mind? Balwant Singh's Eating House. We had Kesar Tea and Samosa. It was my first time there  and the person sitting at the counter came to know this and upgraded my medium cup tea to a Kesar Tea for free! The tea was a little bit sweeter than I had expected, but the combination of crunchy samosas and smoking hot tea was unmatched. Also, the price of their tea is higher than expected. Would I go again? Yes!

Probably the best Vegetarian dhaba food that you can gets your hands on in Calcutta. 

It's a Vegetarian Dhaba yes. Well u can choose to sit in the dhaba and eat  or they are happy to serve you food in your car as well. 

The food is fresh has a tummy Taste and unlike a lot of dhaba food they are not as heavy while eating or even after. There is ways a mad rush at this place. They are open until late. It's a safe neighbourhood. Right by the Gurudwara. 

For the carnivores out there give it a try once atleast and for the Veg Clan of mine you must must try the food here. If simple is your mantra then u will love them. 

Simple only for this place but worth it.

A good old heritage spot set in the bylanes of bhowanipore just beside the gurudwara,balwant's dhaba offers you traditional punjabi dhaba like food which would be enticing for any person who is a lover of good food.

Visited this place in the evening when the it was almost empty so we got seats easily without any hush. The capacity is fairly moderate! We opted for the following items:-

1. Aloo paratha- We expected a traditional round shaped big paratha but upon serving we saw naan sized aloo stuffed paratha coated with melted butter. We opted for dahi & mint chutney as well(they charge extra 35 if you opt for dahi & chutney). The paratha was soft & the stuffing was tasty. But personally the dish was ruined for me due to the naan texture rather than what would you expect a fried crunchy paratha.

2. Dudh fanta- We were confused between dudh cola/fanta, so we opted for dudh fanta. They provide 1 ltr of either what you choose. The mixture of milk & fanta was a new experience. But personally the taste didn't go hand in hand. Dudh cola  would have been more appropriate due to its fizzy nature. But good innovative none the less.

3. Kesar chai- Balwant's is known for their famous tea & evening snacks. So we decided to taste their kesar chai. You have the option to take either the medium/big bhar of chai. Their kesar chai is just awesome. Very very different in taste than what you would get in other place. P.s. they charge Rs50 for a medium bhar of kesar chai.

Overall the place offers you decent veg items at affordable prices but mostly go there to try their tea & snacks. The service was good in my opinion,the attendant was active. The pocket pinch was on the lower side since the bill for 3 came to 410(fairly cheap).

One of the best dhaba of kolkata. The food is also awesome. The most special item is milk mixed with coca cola and the tea and snacks are also very nice.

Located adjacent to the Bhawanipur Gurdwara, this place is busy all the time with customers varying from the hungry ones to the passionate ones. Hearing a lot about their Doodh Cola, I thought of trying it while passing by. It was a nice drink made of a unique combination of Coca Cola and milk topped with ice. However, the milk should have been less diluted in order to bring about the experience better. Also, according to them, we had to take a litre of Doodh Cola irrespective of the number of persons which sounded unjustified to me as a single person cannot have it in that case. However, since we were two, we had it half and packed the remains of it. The drink was priced at Rs 150 which seemed a bit over for me.¬†
All in all, the place seemed promising to me and I would definitely come back again to try out their main courses.

Dhabas adjoining Gurdwaras in every Indian city I lived in have always been special, from the rich paranthas to the quasi religious environment inside markedly different from roadside dhabas playing 90s music. I set out to make Balwant my favourite Gurdwara-Dhaba, and it didn't work out at all. For that, I was left disheartened. 

Walking through the endless piles of litter and slippery floor inside Balwant's, Maa and I settled for their aloo parantha and small kachoris along with tea.

The kachoris were decent, but for a place that opens at 4am, it was cold and seemed like being cooked a couple of hours in advance. The aloo sabji was also decent. But there was nothing endearingly outstanding about either. 

The aloo parantha, as it turned out to my sadness, was the tandoori parantha which isnt my personal favourite for breakfast and the dahi wasn't the rich creamy one either. The Tandoori parantha wasn't bad of course, but again it didn't win me over like Russel's aloo parantha had done.

We finished our meal, and tea hadn't arrived. So we waited for a while more and eventually left paying our bills which was just 100 bucks.

Balwant Singh eating house or dhaba is a name to reckon with! Located in bhawanipur opposite to the Elgin road gurudhwara, this place has been a go-to visit for those late night cravings, addas and Indian breakfast! While the club kachoris here are nice, I love the tea they make! The lassi is divine! #musttry
Try their north Indian -  Paneer tikka, mushroom tikka and you surely are to fall in love! The mint coriander chutney with the tikkas are amazing! While the seating has improved over the years, I still order food from inside my car.
A special dish here- doodh cola is quite popular. Though I find it too sweet and somehow the taste does not work for me!
Try the Paneer butter masala and tarka with nan and onions on the side!

Pricing is like a usual dhaba place.

A must try in the area!

If you want to try proper punjabi food then visit this place. Everything is "Butter maar ke" here. "Doodh Cola" is a must try here (though, don't take a deep dive into the science of its preparation or nutritional valueüòâ). They serve proper punjabi style food at reasonable rates & you can visit this place for a dine-in with friends or family. This place is crowded all the time & waiting time after the order is quite high so,try to give your complete order in a single shot.

Frankly speaking, I feel that the fabled 'Doodh Cola' is a tad overhyped. Don't get me wrong though; it's great and tastes refreshing. However, it failed to live up to the expectations I got from all the reviews I read about it.

The rest of it was fantastic‚Ä¶ and there's no second way around it. The Aloo Paratha is absolutely divine. One piece is enough for one moderate appetite‚Ä¶ and the taste is just beyond description. Coming to the paneer dishes, both Paneer Tikka and Shahi Paneer were superb as well.

What's left for me to try here are the famous tea and a plate of club kachoris. Let's keep the fingers crossed and hope that this joint doesn't fail to impress me once more.

It's been lying dormant on my wish list for an extremely long time. Until a couple of days back when a friend of mine suggested we visit this place together. On a rainy evening reached the place without any incidence or hassle.¬†

While waiting for the said friend I treated myself to a bhar of tea which was really out of the world what with its kadak nature, minimal sweetness and the generous quantity. In fact the server suggested that I should opt for the medium size instead of the large and this really was helpful considering we were there for its iconic doodh-cola. I am surprised why none of the reviews talk about its tea...

Then in the natural progression of things we did order its iconic doodh-cola which is a concoction of fluidy milk and coca cola with loads of ice served a pitcher, it's quantity enough for at least 4 persons. I fail to understand why so many reviewers speak about the milk being thin. Believe me, if the milk were a tad more thick, the entire drink would have been a disaster! We then went for the paneer tikka and aloo tikka which were regular stuff and nothing exceptional.

Don't look for ambience and other accessories while visiting this place. Simply hang out with your friends over a bhar of tea and when the conversation ebbs down go for the kill - its doodh-cola!

This place has always been kind to me.
Especially the gentleman at the desk has an extremely good sense of humour and always suggests wisely. Whenever I visit,I ask him instead what should I go for and his advises are never disheartening. He also manages to help me out getting a place to park my car; that too in the busy thoroughfare of Harish Mukherjee Road.
North Indian and Punjabi dishes have a special place in my heart;and Balwant Singh's delicacies have never let that love to fade away.
Needless to exaggerate of what they serve,because their food and drinks speak volumes!
The fresh milk and soft drink mixture(Doodh Cola/Fanta) can possibly be one of their most unique brainchild and their piping hot earthen pot of tea is simply satisfying.
To name a few like their famous paneer tikka,rajma- chawal combination,soft naans,jeera rice,paneer pasanda,begum bahar and so on can neither upset your stomach nor your mood.

When near Harish Mukherjee Road,do stop by this place.
I do atleast!

One of the most iconic eateries in Kolkata, undoubtedly, balwant singh's dhaba is a delight for tea lovers. The steaming cup of tea here, accompanied with the sumptous samosas is quite a treat. 

However, I was fascinated with the doodh-cola that you can get here, so I went recently to taste the same. First thing's first, it is not THAT good. Yes, it has that novelty factor, which has kept the interest alive amongst the masses, but at Rs. 150, it's simply not that good. Served in a jug, and bhaands the cool drink is refreshing and easy on your taste buds though! 
Cheers!

Breakfast at odd hours when even your home can't provide so?? Well, this is the place then!!! They start serving at 4AM!!!! This is the place that never sleeps...well except for a nap for an hour from 3AM to 4AM...the timing is their USP! Like really!! We've experienced sunrise over this place many a times. Very very popular for breakfast, their Club Kachoris are simply yummmm. Their specialty, Doodh Cola is one of the most popular drink in town....a unique combination of Milk and Cola served in a large pitcher. It's a must have for most of the people along with their breakfast, though I'm not a big fan of it....I mean it's good but people seem to like it more than I can imagine. Well, well I've been going on and on with the breakfast part but let me tell you this place is not only about breakfast. You get proper meals over here for lunch and dinner. I have tried their North Indian cuisine and it's pretty decent. We have met the owner of this place, an elderly Sardar Uncle with whom we had conversed and really liked!! Nothing great about the interior and the ambience, yet this place is loved by all!! üòä

Tawa roti's, aloo dum, paneer üòõwriting this review makes me drool thinking of this place.
Lassi in KULHAD is refreshing and Cola's with milk was new thing which I tried but since tasted for the first time and had too much to eat was a bit cofused to be given a star.

This is a veg only eatery beside the Bhawanipore Gurdwara near SSKM (PG) hospital. Famous for its tea, the place serves some unique items like doodh cola. The tandoori aloo we tried here was good. Also the paneer items were decent. Price is bit on the higher side taking into consideration that the place lacks ambiance and hygiene. Big plus of this place is it remains open till almost early morning.

This place is over hyped so are their foods.....The doodh cola is innovative but not really worth the fame...I found it to be very repulsive personally though I'm a great lover of dairy products and soft drinks....The rotis,the paneer are tasty but I think them to be fairly over priced. Being an ex doctor of a government hospital nearby and a present post graduate trainee of a nearby medical college I have a long history with this place...Thankfully this is the only place which remains open at night and had provided me meals at odd hours of night during my duty hours.The legendary chai in here is also not legendary anymore. (Though I'm not a tea connisseaur )But it hurts to shell out 30 bucks for a cup of tea and a single samosa.!!!!Still the legacy goes on....

Located beside the Gurudwara at Harish Mukherjee Road, a good place for chit-chatting and having breverages. Its a pure vegetarian restaurant.

Recommended- Special tea- it will cost you Rs 40. Hot Nimkis and Amriti as snacks. I tasted the 'Doodh Cola' as its a recommended item by Zomato- not to die for it. Instead better to have paneer items...it tastes great.

Not much to talk about ambience and service. Fine one. Good place to hang out with and fill your stomach with Desi-items.

We headed to this place on a rainy afternoon to fill our stomach with yummylicious food. Balwant Singh Dhaba is well-known among Calcuttans. It serves pure veg food which can make any die-hard non veg person a fan of this place.¬†

The place is not so big, and had minimal furnitures. It is a no-frills dhaba with finger licking food from north India.

We ordered for doodh cola which is a signature item on their menu. It tasted so different! However the quantity was huge for 2 people to finish.

Next we ordered masala kulcha with mushroom tikka butter masala. I loved the kulchas so much. The mushroom tikka butter masala was again a very different kinda dish and we liked it too.

One of the worst experiences i have ever had while eating out or ordering food from any joint in Kolkata.On a rainy afternoon, dropped in the joint and ordered the following items-Dal tadka,paneer dish(forget its name, in fact not worth remembering at all),masala kulcha and laccha paratha.I was made to wait for 15 minutes since it was pretty early for lunch by dhaba standards.Now coming on to the most horrendous part- the food.Both the tadka and the paneer dish was horribly spicy.Truth be told they were not fit for consumption by any sane person.I mean- what was the cook thinking while preparing the dishes? Just because you have been in business for the past 90 odd years does not mean that you start taking your customers for granted. The paratha and kulcha were quite soft and flaky.However the stuffing of boiled potato and crushed/minced paneer inside the kulcha was quite tasteless.Had ordered an overpriced and way overhyped small chai for Rs 15/- to bide my time while the food was being prepared. Sheer wastage.It was everything but teaJust a miserable concoction of milk,cheap tea dust and overdose of sugar.You can impress the drunk party animals of the city in the middle of the night but i am NOT impressed at all. Guys, stay away if you want to save your money and stomach.

Low priced, midnight hunger stop is what it always aspired to be! And so it is!
The sitting area is rather stuffy
No chicken in a Dhaba!
Service is slow!
But still.... it'll always be there for those midnight hunger pangs! And that's what Balwant's best known for!

Balwant Singh Dhaba. Who hasn't heard of it? Best known for its Chai and breakfast menu, this place is an all time classic.

If you're trying to find this place physically, I'll suggest you to take Bhawanipur Gurudwara to be your landmark.

Coming to the food, best is if you order their famous chai. Coming to Balwant Singh Dhaba and not having a taste of their Lassi and Samosa would be a shame. This Dhaba has all of their food items veg.

This place won't be like your typical sparkly clean restaurants. It's an old, renowned Dhaba. It doesn't have shiny floors and spotless clean windows. Decor wouldn't impress you much. But what is worth is their history, name and popularity for Punjabi food.

Known for the famous doodh cola which is a curious amalgamation of milk and aerated cola as you would see on their Zomato page, this is the oldest dhaba of the City of Joy. The ambiance is noisy with the whirling sound of wall fan and chatter of eaters hovering in the air. The small crowd consisted mostly of young people and middle-aged couples dining and chattering when I entered it. The place gives you the feel of a typically busy roadside Punjabi dhaba.
We ordered plates of puri-sabzi that came in steel thalis heaped with four fresh puris, spicy aloo curry, chopped green chillies and a delicious sweet chutney. This we followed with freshly-brewed refreshing milk tea in earthen teacups and lassi made of thick foamy milk served in an earthenware mug. The food was amazingly good and wholesome enough to increase your appetite for a hearty evening supper.
This vegetarian dhaba wouldn't score well as far as ambiance goes, but for food a very good option at pocket-friendly prices.
Also to be noted: Balwant Singh's Eating House was recently visited by celebrated Italian ch√©f David Rocco of popular tv shows like "David Rocco's Dolce Vita," "David Rocco's Amalfi Getaway" and "David Rocco's Dolce India!" aired on Fox Life, accompanied by owner of Paris Cafe, pastry ch√©f and Le Cordon Bleu alumna Sneha Singhi on a street food tasting tour across the city. Ch√©f Rocco is reported to have hated the doodh cola but loved the lassi! He also expertly chowed down some really spicy food!

People say that breakfast should be in Flurys. Well, one fine morning on a holiday, I was missing the mouth watering breakfast I had in keventers in Darjeeling and decided let us have a breakfast somewhere outside today. After 45 minutes, I was sitting at a moderately cleaned table inside a just opened Balwant's. They have not yet started the cleaning process for the last night also. We were 2 persons and ordered for a plate of aloo paratha, small kachori sabji, and doodh cola. A smiling young boy served the order within 10 minutes. Oh, the aloo paratha looked so great with the melting butter on it. It was accompanied by achar and curd. And it tasted super too with uniform layer of aloo stuffed. The kachori with sabji tasted good too. Then came the doodh cola. When I ordered this I thought this must be served in glass and so said that order is for 2 glasses. But the person said that it is 1 litre in portion! That was served in a plastic jug with 2 earthen pots. Awesome it tasted. A must have. 
The total bill was within 300 for 2 persons. 
A great breakfast :-)

One of the best and crowded Dhabas in the town of Kolkata.
Balwant Singh's eating house is situated adjacent to the Gurdwara in Bhowanipore and serves the best dishes till 1am in the morning.

Most of the times you'll find people gossiping outside the Dhaba and it has become an ideal place for conversing with people(for all the late night walkers).

The tea and milk cola are definitely on the hot list.
They are sold off very fast for people like us who love to go on night walks.
The food is very fresh and delicious.Tandoori chicken,roti and rice are the ones that are served really fast.

If you are the night walker then you must visit Balwant Singh's Dhaba at least once.
This place will always be in your memory...

A very average looking place... the floor creaks when you walk on it but all is good when the food is goodüòù and the food isn't just good it's great.
Best veggies joint you can ever go to... paneer tikka is delicious... so was the other dishes... you can literally feel all the flavors bursting in your mouth...
Definitely recommend.ü§ì

An iconic place known for their Doodh Cola. A blissful combination of Milk and Cola, these guys simply excel at it. Besides, their Kachoris, Jalebis, Cutting Chai are also very popular. All of their products are cooked in pure ghee, and hence it adds to the aroma and flavor. Try this place if you haven't done before.

Heard about this and visited here and surely speaking i came here to taste doodh cola which i heard of so much so after so much searching and asking went there and the funny thing is no one came to take order(even after calling for them) and after asking about doodh cola even the waiters are confused ¬†one told me that 250 ml is the min and i asked him to bring two of them(which he did not bring) and after sometime irritated with this i asked another waiter for doodh cola he rudely said that only 1 litre doodh cola will be served(seriously who drinks that lot!!!) and that too @150 RUPEES!!! and i will tell you its completely un-worthy..

I just cant explain the happiness of this place. Sometimes we hit the road early in the morning for experiencing some beauty of Kolkata at the dawn and then to this place. 
Wow! Those mouthwatering kachauris, jalebis, cutting chai(malai marke), dhokla what not.
Filled with variety crowd from 9-90 gives a charm to the ambience.

Chai, Kachori sabji √†nd Doodh thumsup are the best selected items from heres menu you can have without thinking much about quality . service dont expect any good otherwise you will feel bad. well its a wellknown adda place for morning people and midnight hangout place for student ant PG crowd. overall good when you are with your besties. 
Visited again :Had kesar chai which was not at all recommended they give you kesar while you place your order over cash counter and tell you to put it in you tea when you get your tea delivered to you.this way I didn't like to have my tea.if you are taking its order then make sure the chef who is making doesn't skip the whole process which is boiling the tea with kesar then serve it to us so that it truly become kesar tea..

This place used to be my everyday breakfast joint during my graduation days....i love their kachori and kesar jalebi. Have u heard of doodh cola or doodh fanta? If not, please try it. Its a mixture of cola/fanta with milk. Its served chilled and u r going to love it. I have tried doodh cola in other places but nothing beats Balwant singh's doodh cola. So what r u waiting for? Go and grab a mug of doodh cola!!

This place is really awesome if you are in love with Punjabi cuisine and that typical North Indian taste. Opened in 1930s this restaurant serves some mouth watering delicacies in a rather small and shabby place. If you are with a gang returning from party late night and hungry then this place is where you can hit. The food cooked in butter is pure bliss if you are fed up with same monotonous taste of restaurants around Kolkata and craving for some Delhiwala taste in your mouth at a lesser pocket pinch.

Went on a rainy afternoon, literally to save myself from the rain and get a place to sit while I book my cab. Ordered tea, samosa and a cheese sandwich. The seating arrangement and the service was basic. The tea was good and thick. The samosa and the sandwich were fine. I finished my food, meanwhile the cab driver called and I told the driver that I am in the dhaba and I am switching off my phone which had run out of battery. He advised me to come out of the dhaba and stand on the pavement to avoid any confusion as I won't be available over the phone. I was standing on the pavement under the shade of the dhaba. Meanwhile an elderly person from Balwant Singh's family asked me to come in and sit. I told him that I am waiting for the cab, and that if I miss the cab I'll be in a soup as there is a huge scarcity of cabs due to rain. He then rudely said that I am blocking the entrance of his shop. When I refused to move, he asked a caretaker to start sweeping that area, so that I move (honestly, who sweeps the footpath when it's raining cats and dogs outside?). I still refused to move because that was my pick up point for the cab. I told him that the pavement belongs to the government and anyone can stand there. And that he can't object as long as I am causing no nuisance to his shop. Then he rudely asked a caretaker to fold up the shade over the pavement, under which I was standing. I told him that I would rather use my umbrella still, I won't move. Meanwhile my cab came and I left.

Never seen this kind of horrible behaviour from someone who is in food business. Aren't the dhaba owners known for their hospitality? Never coming back again.

The almost all day and all night open dhaba serves good pure vegetarian dhaba style food with a lot of warmth. The service is really good, whether you are at the restaurant or being served in your cars. If it's evening you could try their Samosa or kachori with their famous milk tea. If having dinner the must haves include paneer tikka for starters, hot tandoori rotis with dal tarka and alu do paiyaza for main course.Remember to ask for the green salad along with your order. You could end your meal with their creamy masala kesariya tea or their invention, ' doodh cola'. The service is rated 4 and food can easily become a 4 with small changes like not adding maida in the roti, improving the kulfi for desserts.

Balwant Singh dhaba is one of the oldest dhabas in Kolkata.one of the few places that stay open till 2 in the morning. Located in a prime location, it is pretty popular and it gets crowded like crazy during the poojas . When you enter , you'd see how typically it's a dhaba, not very posh and has an ac and a non AC part. The servers are quiet ignorant if you complain about the quality of the food. One suggestion would be to order mineral water . Coming to the food , basically serves Indian food.
Try the mushroom tikka and the paneer tikka. One of the best tikkas in town.
Try the masala malai paneer, tadka daal, the butter naan and masala kulcha. Prefer the rumaali roti over stuffed paraathas.
Would not recommend mixed vegetable, navratan korma- and shahi paneer, lassi and chai.
Do try the doodh cola, you'd either love it or hate it.

I do not think people know this place by their name. They only know it as the "Gurudwara." Their most inventive offering - doodh cola. It's a mix of cola, milk n soda.¬†
Their paneer tikka used to be good but lately the taste has gone really bad.

LOCATION:

Situated on main Harish Mukherjee Road right next to the Gurudwara. If this seems a little difficult to find, just look for a row of cars with people in it being served tea and snacks and you will know you have reached the right place.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

This tea house has been around forever and has been a favorite for morning walkers seeking tea and snacks or late nighters who want to get out in the sparse Kolkata winters for this eateries famous tea and Kachoris. Interiors are ordinary to say the least but then this outlet is not about the interiors. Its more about enjoying well made tea in mud cups. My exposure to this eatery has been their tea or Saffron Milk for years now. Very recently, I had to chance to taste their food and hence this review comes after years of numerous visits to this Kolkata tradition.¬†

WINE & DINE:

Tea -- This is the main attraction of this eatery with hunders of people flocking to this place from all over Kolkata just to have their tea. So whats so special? If you are the kind of person who likes their tea made out of whole milk with generous quantities of sugar, this place is a Mecca for you. I for one like my tea strong, 50:50 ratio for water to milk and easy on the sugar part of it. So the number of visits I talk about is because of my family and friends and not as much because I loved the Tea here.

Snacks -- The sandwiches are nice. Its a purely vegetarian outlet. The vegetable sandwich was nice but short on vegetables. It was filled with the goodness of homemade butter which is such a pleasure in the times we eat in. The cheese sandwich too is well made. They dont serve ketch up so carry some in the car !. The mini kachoris they do are alright but I have had better in the city. Coming to the North Indian flare, many swear by the food here but I found it to be ordinary and a little too greasy for my liking. The tandoori paneer was ok and so was the dal and mixed vegetables. The one thing worth mentioning is that I found the oil they used to be better than a lot of similar eateries.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

From honking in your car for a waiter to take your order to honking in your car for them to clear the plates and get your cheque. There has to be a more organized way to serve better. Moreover, I think the food definitely should be better.

VERDICT:

Avoid the food, but for well made rich tea and snacks or a Sunday morning heavy breakfast, its a must go!

That amazing and now a legendary place perfect for any time of the day's visit. Be it on way your back home from Gokhale school or college or an exhausting day at SSKM hospital or anything for that matter, this place never fails to amaze you! People flock there even at daybreak or late nights throughout the year just for its consistency and great food/snacks/tea. Don't go much by the seating and comfort. You'll enjoy just by being immersed in that aura of sheer nostalgia and sipping on that lovely tea with a really hot jalebi or while gorging on those hot straight out of the kadai kachoris!
When we were school kids, the price for a big cup of tea (yes they have small, medium, large!) seemed a little more, maybe difference in a few rupees, surely less than ten, compared to any other typical roadside tea stall but that's more than compensated by the great tea they serve!

A very popular hangout in Kolkata. ¬†The dudh cola is very popular. Place is quite untidy and a certain table near the entrance stinks don't know why. Service is decent. The food quality is good. The place is pure veg but you would get a lot of variety to choose. The taste is as good as you like. You can always go for Dal Makhani
, Butter Paneer, Makai ka Roti. And if you are in Balwant at least try their Tea.

Monday afternoon found me in Balwant Singh's. Now I have been there before but this time I wanted to review it because of a certain reason which you will soon know. 
Firstly, the food NEVER disappoints. It is deeelicious...probably the best vegetarian Dhaba food in Kolkata. We ordered palak tadka dal, aloo do pyaza and phulke. Everything was bang-on in terms of taste. We had even requested that they put less oil in the food and they complied:)
But what makes me sad today is the next part...there are pests (literally) in the premises and I request the concerned authorities to take note of this and take the required steps for pest control. 
I am aware that it takes a hard work to run a restaurant and you guys are doing a great job in terms of serving good food and at a reasonable price but please do not let down your patrons with these minor problems. A restaurant has to maintain a certain level of hygiene and thats all I expect from people handling my food. Since I had not faced this problem when I had visited 3 months back...I hope I will go back not to be faced with such mismanagement.

A legendary location which is open almost throughout the day serving late night dinners or early morning breakfast and at the heart of the city which is easily accesible from all the parts of the city.....this is the biggest USP of the joint which i otherwise found very ordinary and hyped up....

ambience...well should not be expecting any here so not writing much but the place looked a little untidy, specially the water station and the entrance.....

food...we ordered club kachori....aloo paratha....paneer paratha....poori sabji....doodh cola......and this is the reason why i called the place ordinary coz the food didnt impressed at all....example, a pc of aloo paratha with a splash of boondi raita and achar is for 70 bucks but the filling was so less that i felt it was prepared by some amature in the kitchen...the raita ws on the contrary really good and thick...the other items like kachori n sabji were also basic which you get on the streets....i was most dissapointed with the doodh cola which ws a thin mixture of cold milk and something else, i cant bet they mixed cola coz there was zero fizz....and too many ice cubes made it even more watery and tasteless....the bill with basic breakfast when we were no way close to half full was around 100 per head and you will get much better options in places like maharani or srihari which are nearby too....

Should have given them a 5 star in 2005 n nearby. But now this place has not able to convert itself among the popular dhabas. Dhaba food is not that great if compared to other similar kinds and service is a huge issue. The owners should have given more time into this rather than splitting.

This is a purely veg restaurant/dhaba, or in their own words "shuddh shakahari khanewala dhaba". You'll be amazed to see the humorous side of the staff that was great to see. The food was really good and the price was standard mostly. Quantity is good. You won't have any complaints with the overall service of the restaurant. The restaurant is clean but could be better. We witnessed a tiny mouse wandering in the restaurant. This sight is a huge no no for the food lovers. The staff were informed and they took the matter seriously. That was good to see. I'm overlooking this unfortunate incident while publishing my review and am giving this dhaba the benefit of doubt. Will visit again for sure. Cheers :)

The speciality of balwant singh Dhaba is its 'Doodh Cola'. After talking to the manager I came to know that this item is patented. It's a perfect blend of milk and cola. Also the kachori and sweets are equally amazing. The tea here tastes great and the aroma of the tea is very refreshing. A nice place to stop by.

BALWANT : A PLACE WELL KNOWN
========================================      
Well, this place doesn't need much of an introduction. Balwant Singh's Eating House is one of the most popular places of Kolkata for late night eat out. The place is always buzzing with large number of customers chit-chatting with friends. This place is running for years now and is one of the oldest food hubs of that place. But the craze of this place has increased with each passing day.

Location:
This place is located in Bhawanipur. You can find this place just beside Gurudwara. Not a difficult place to find as anyone in that area can guide you to this place.

Ambience:
Nothing much to tell about the ambience. The place is very simple without much of a decor. Just a place to sit and eat. Always crowded, and noisy. People prefer to sit outside the shop for tea and snacks as well.

Service:
Good and fast. Nothing more to say on the service

Food:
The food quality is always good here. The place is pure veg but you would get a lot of variety to choose. The taste is as good as you like.
You can always go for these things if you are here:
Dal Makhani
Tarka
Butter Paneer
Makai ka Roti

And if you are in Balwant you can't miss their Special Tea, if you miss that its a sin.
Another speciality here is their "Doodh Cola", yeah you read it right, its prepared with Milk and Coke mixing it together. You can always try once.
P.S. I didnt like it at all.

Last Words:
Always a great place to go if you are looking for a good veg place with a reasonable price tag and you don't bother about decor and ambience. The place will always give you a good vibe when you are here. I would suggest late night to this place to enjoy more.

3.5/5 for this place.

Patgetic ambience. I went there to eat in peace and some stranger came and sat beside me as there was no place in the restaurant. The restaurant is dirty like anything. I ordered paneer in tomato gravy but the waiter brought some other gravy. Hygiene goes for a toss in this dhaba. I went there to try their doodh cola. They serve only 1 litre of doodh cola. Doodh cola was really pathetic and there was nothing so special in it. Still they charged us 150 bucks for 1 litre. The crowd that comes here is pathetic. Everyone keeps shouting at the waiters and they have no sense at all. A big no for this place from my side.

Pure vegetarian restaurant and the pure non veg guys can stop reading this and ignore it completely. Kolkata does not have many options when it comes to food being available 24/7. This is what is so unique about this place. The seating area on the ground floor is best avoided. The one on the first floor which is air conditioned is just about ok. It is best to park your car in one corner and get them to serve the food in the car itself. Service is good and so is the food. This place tends to be crowded during late night as compared to normal dining hours. Don't forget to try the tea - one of the best in Kolkata.

Victoria Memorial¬†nd what follows thereafter is the story that this famed dhaba shall unfurl....... The dhaba opens floors nd doors to the warm hearted joggers around the memorial nd the maidan area at 4 am.... The dhaba,,, one of the best breakfast places in Kolkata,,, since the early hours of the morning is packed with a diverse set of joggers every time you take a sneak peek into the cinematic glory of the still frame here....
Chai is what people head for here,,, coupled with nimki, samosa, mathri nd an old, atypical favourite - doodh cola.......

A very popular eating hangout in Kolkata. Although didnt try any food items this time and jumped into having the famous dudh cola and lassi here. The lassi here is a must try and is served in earthen glasses. The dudh cola which is a popular drink here is basically a drink comprising coca cola and milk topped with ice cubes.It may be popular but I didn't like it. Next time I visit here I am focusing on the food menu.

If you ask me, Balwant Singh is one of the many places in the City that is a must visit if you are on a food trail (even if not). It is the place you go to, late at night, when all other shops have closed down, for a cup of steaming milk tea, lassi or doodh cola and paranthas. The dhaba is packed with people, inside and out, throughout the day. The kitchen, works at a hyper speed and trust me, they need to.

Not only are people lining for dine ins, but hundreds of brown packets leave the delivery counter on a daily basis. I myself make it a point to order a couple of alu paranthas for takeaway, when passing the area. While waiting, I never fail to sip delightfully on some full milk tea or the malai lassi, standing near the tea counter. 

I dropped into the outlet today early in the morning with Maa, for a hearty Mother‚Äôs Day breakfast. We ordered alu paratnthas, kachoris and¬† dosa and to gulp it all in, some lassi and tea. While food quality is superior, this is no fine dining place. Do not expect beautiful interiors. Some other things you must order when visiting are- paneer tikkas, Palak paneer, malai kofta, and the Masala Kulcha.

Some lovely breakfast with your mother is all it takes to start a great day.

Given a big foodie for Punjabi foods I keep visiting dhabas .
Well I paid a visit here especially for their famous Chai but the Jalebi is priceless here .The after taste of Jalebi and the old songs they were playing in the radio reminded me of an old Kolkata .. Had a nostralgic morning here .
I will recommend you to visit this place in the morning since it has got a very positive vibe .

Balwant singh eating house is a legendary name in itself. Very popular for the tea and dudh cola they serve. But i am a big fan for their breakfast, aloo paratha and dal makhani. It is a pure vegetarian place as it is located below a gurudwara. But you wont be disappointed by the food served here. Lassi is yummy too.

Being the first timer to taste the delicacies provided by this place, my review for Balwant Singh's Eating House includes the following- It is a place for the one who prefer North Indian vegeterian food(including onions and garlic). Food quality should not be judged by the eatery's outlook. Quality and taste of the food raises the expectation to come over here again. Doodh Cola and 24 hours of service is their added feature. However, if cleanliness is maintained properly, then, more people would join to enjoy the delicacies of this place.

I was hoping it to taste like something else at first but thennnnn I fell in lOVE with it. Balwant Singh is the only place in Calcutta that gives you Doodh-Cola and it tastes SooperDooperFooper Yummmmmmmmmm.
The place gives you full on Dhaaba vibes and the food is great. We had Paneer Kebabs over there which were so tastyyyyyy, the chutney was also yumm.¬†
Totally go to this place whenever you're in the mood for some good food and good mood!

Review for Balwant Singh's Eating House includes the fact that its not air conditioned. But the taste of the pure vegetarian food is just too good. This 24 hours open place is fabulous with its lassi, tea, all Indian gravy items and the best baked breads, all being top class, and above all the service. Always get a nice indoor Dhaba kind of feel.

The only place in kolkata where you will get food if you are hungry at 3am. And trust me you will find many people out there even at 3am.
The food is delicious but the service is not that good, but at 3am you can't ask for more. 
The much hyped 'doodh cola' sucks big time. The aaloo paraths are awsome and the chatni you get with it is mouth watering.
If you are a student in kolkata from another city. You have to visit this place if you want the night life.

Had heard a great deal about how good this place is, so decided to go for lunch.
The experience was extremely disappointing.
The food tasted average but the worst part was I saw rats near the kitchen ,even dhabas need to have basic hygiene standards.
Would not recommend it to anyone.

Mushroom tikkas and paneer tikkas are an absolute must have of this dhaba. It is always fun to go to Balwant Singh as it offers 24 hours service which means that you are bound to find this place always bustling with energy. Makes it a perfect place to go to during nightouts, morning walks and puja. Also, the food is very reasonably priced, so you needn't worry about the pocket pinch.

Went to this famed place for breakfast with my daughter couple of days back. I had read mixed feedback about this place so was a bit apprehensive. And after the visit I do endorse the views of my fellow foodies.  The place is great with food but extremely low with cleanliness. As we sat at a uncleared table a rat good 5 inches long began his breakfast under our table with all the food lying on the unclean floor.
Now coming to the better part of the experience. We ordered alu parantha and chole bature and polished them off with a kulhar of extremely rich lassi each. The bature was rightly done with no oil dripping alongside. The waiter was courteous enough to offer a refill of chole. Alu parantha was also good but definitely not the best I have had. 
The visit left me wondering why do the people who keep their place of worship and community kitchen in such impeccable condition keep this place so dirty.

Visited with my family with a great expectation but ended up with a great disappointment. This dhaba is so uncleaned that the seating  area almost look like a garbage. Food tastes good but very very oily. Butter naan was rubbery. But I liked their tea and hot gulab jamun. Anyway I will never visit this place again.

There are few restaurants who don,t care about ratings . what they care about is quality of food Service & Value for money.

Balwant singh eating house is one of them. Its a very small eatery and generally people prefer sitting in their vehicles.This eatery was and still now famous for its tea . I think they started offering full flged food service only a few years back . The best part is you can get food till late in night & late means till 2:-2:30AM. The service is prompt the food is good. I generally prefer Dal makhni, Chana Masala ,Roasted potatao along with butter Naan.I you are looking for ambiance this place is not fopr you, But if you are looking for Good Food at odd hour with great service at an affordable price then you should try it once.

They didn't have much to offer at that eerie time of the afternoon. Food was good , service was good . the only bug was the cleanliness of the place . I would visit this place again . overall a good experience.

Food 3.5/5
Aaloo parantha
Pyaaz parantha
Gobhi parantha
All were good. I'm not much of a parantha person, but they were really good.
But when we called for another pyaaz parantha, it wasn't cooked properly. We could actually see the raw dough. We called the guy, told him it's not cooked, he denied it even when it was visible. Then he took it back and after a while got the same parantha, it was better than before but still not cooked properly.

Aaloo do pyaaza : Good. Quantity was good as well.

Service 2.5/5
Service is toooooooo slow. Staff also seems rude.

Probably one of the oldest and finest roadside food stall or as commonly known, Dhaba.
Unarguably, one place which no foodie here has skiipped. From the 'morning cha' to Dudh Cola, you should certainly not miss any item on the menu :P

P.S. Never miss the chance to have your food severed in your car/car's hood.

I liked the the Doodh Cola as it is a pretty unique concept and no idea how they actually manage to make it.

Kachori is nice and hot to have early in the morning.

However, the service and overall can be improved.

This restaurant serves home like north indian desi cuisine and pure desi, south indian and Chinese snacks. Very famous for their beverages so we first try their tea and doodh fanta which were both very refreshing, tasty and perfectly made. In snacks i have samosa which was tasty and very spicy. Food was tastes like dhaba made. Spicy and tasty. In the end we have lassi which tastes pure punjabi. Refreshing and delicious. Good experience. Must try their beverages. Recommended to all.

 was dry and charred.( almost burnt) Not at all tasty. The malai kofta was good in taste but too,too oily!! The naan was rubbery... had to pull really hard to tear it. Wonder how this place is so popular and so much visited when their food is of this standard.!!!

Its a Dhaba so could not have asked for more but at least it should be maintained in much more clean and hygiene manner... Place was really bad and untidy...... Plates which was given were not properly cleaned (sticky and left overs easily visible) and were full wet ...¬†
Cuming to food...... we have ordered for spcl Tadka when served was full buttery but inside it was not properly cooked or fried....... In the gravy of Paneer Butter Masala there were raw onion pcs which really spoiled the taste (it should be added as a paste in gravy)......
Prices are very much similar to any other proper restaurants but the quality has really deteriorated....
I have loved this place and its Dhoodh Cola is always yummy but management should really look into the the proper cleanliness and food quality..........
Next time I will think twice b4 visiting this place again and hope it should work on the suggestions and try to bring the changes.....

Balwanth singh's dhaba, as it is called, is one of the most famous and well know joints in kolkata. They are actually famous for their milk -cola which you have to taste once if you are in kolkata! Its milxture of milk and coca-cola and its unlike anything that you have ever tasted before. And trust me, it tastes awesome! The place also serves other food such as samosas and kachoris which is also good. The cutting chai of the place is also pretty nice. Plus it stays open 24 hours a day. So for all the party crowd and the late night gangs, this is like an oasis. A must go.

On my friend's recommendation, I went to have Doodh Cola. I thought it would be a flop. Doodh and Cola, what a mess!!!! But, to my utter surprise I found it to be 5 star rated beverage. Oh! It's awsomeeee.....

It seems that Doodh Cola has overpowered all other items and became the King. Still, the subjects to the King are quite good.

Went to this place after college exams for breakfast. Needless to say, it turned out to be as good as we had heard from our peers. Ordered club kachori and puri sabzi. The sabzi was delicious but club kachori stood out as the clear winner. Following this, we ordered Jalebis which were totally lip-smacking with the perfect crunchiness. One thing that mesmerized us was definitely the chai served in earthen cups. Their aroma filled up the entire place. Definitely going to visit this place more often not only for the breakfast but also for the staff who didn't leave any stone unturned in servicing us. Big thumbs up.

More of a dhaba-resto set up. This place is pretty packed up most of the times. My main motive was to have their renowned doodhcola. This drink is definitely a showstopper. It is made of milk and coca-cola!! And it tastes really amazing. Must try!

This is a decent place for a Punjabi breakfast and snacks. The baby kachori, samosa, jalebi and lassi are amazing. The tea they serve is also quite popular. One major problem: the seating place is kind of unkempt with some pest infestation. Better if you parcel your food.

Should I say more?
Kolkatans are aware of this eating outlet located in the midst of the city.
You can visit here 24*7 to munch, brunch, nd to have fun...
Steamed chai, nimkee, samosa, and their very very own Doodh-Thumps up should be tried.

Best time to visit is at night... If lucky you can spot ur fav cars here ;)

I might have visited Balwant Singh Eating House uncoubtable times either alone or with my friends. I had to go to Balwant this time just to have the best tea in Kolkata after I had left this city. Went on a beautiful sunday morning with one of my friend. Had stomache full breakfast from Alu Paratha to Chole Bhature and Samosa with loads of gullads of tasty Tea!! Needless to say, a must visit for all tea lovers

Went there for breakfast on 25th December with friends. Situated just beside the  Bhawanipur gurudwara. Well known as Balwant Singh's dhaba (running time 4am-3 am). Ordered panner parota, aloo parota, sandwich and chai. Specially, panner parota was excellent. Quality and quantity both were good. Prices are cheap. Good place to come at anytime to fill your empty stomach with foods.

I went there with my friends after my exam in PG. The restaurant is situated near a Gurdwara and this is a pure vegetarian restaurant and as the name suggest they serve primarily Punjabi cuisine. The dinning space is very small and cozy and non-AC. The place was crowded in the lunch time it was more or less struggle for me to get a table for 4, thats why I had to wait outside and in the mean time I took a few sip of tea. I had ordered makke ki roti, sarso ka saag, Chana masala, palak paneer, tandoori roti, gulab jamun and milk Fanta.
The taste and quality of food is very good, they don't have a formal waiter staff but they will take good care of you. Tea was very good. They are known for there milk cola or fanta, which is milk+ice+cola/fanta which they serve in a jug minimum 1 litter. The price for which is ‚Çπ150. Firstly, I would say it is not that good at taste, certainly it has been hyped, secondly it is overpriced. All in total 4 of us had to pay total ‚Çπ750.

This is one of those places which stays open past midnight, and that is the reason we thought of paying it a visit. But the experience was very disappointing.
Let's not rate/judge it on ambiance because ambiance is not what we go here for.
Service is only average. The place was jam packed but the order still didn't take much time to come. But it was very difficult, almost impossible, to get the waiter's attention which became slightly irritating. On couple of occasions we had to scream across the hall just to get him to attend to us.
Food was good but very overpriced! A small roasted papad with barely few pieces of onion/tomato and lime sprinkled being sold for 50rs on the name of masala papad is a big rip off! Veg platter for starters for 400rs is too little quantity for the price charged. The roti department was good, proportionate to the price. Also, the dal tadka is not dal tadka. It's not dal makhni not plain yellow dal...it is just something else....
Do try the Cola Milk...something different i found here which was really good!
All in all, we ended up paying more than 400 a person for average food and mediocre experience...
Post mid night there are very few options to explore...so if you do end up here, make your choices wisely :-)

Be it clean, vegetarian food, awesome doodh cola for a late night dinner or the thick, syrupy chai and kachoris for an early morning breakfast, Balwant is the place to be at. 
I love this place and visit often but in the last few months there has been a rise in the number of drunk, rowdy men there at night, and hence it ceases to feel as safe and comforting as it used to.

I am always in search of only vegetarian restaurants in my vicinity so a friend took me here!! It was worth the bill paid.. I am a fan of typical Punjabi type Dhaba style food..
Pick up any dish and you will love it.. Staff is polite !

Balwant Singh is the legendary all day long dhaba/eatery (whichever you prefer) located at the heart of bhawanipore. It is mostly famous due to the fact that it remains open all night long, (except from 3-4 A.M) and is thronged by people of all ages who want to tuck in during odd hours of the day. It was famous for its chai, though the quality has gone down a bit in recent times.
This christmas, I went there with three of my friends, for breakfast. We ordered alu paratha, paneer paratha and grilled sandwiches, followed by a 'bhar' of chai each. The paneer paratha deserves special mention.
Its quite a nice place to tuck into a sumptuous meal or just to have a adda over chai. The prices are quite cheap. Staffs are friendly too. If you are walking by, dont forget to drop in for a quick meal.

An iconic and popular eating joint. Open all throughout the day, attracts many from around the city. Their chaai (tea) is one of the best available in the city, and their signature drink, 'doodh-cola' is so awesome, half a jug of which will cost you Rs.150, worth a try for a large group of people. The management needs to be more efficient in handling orders though. My order was taken and forgotten, had to remind to get it.

The only plus point of this eatery is its functioning 24/7. No spot for non- vegetarian , health freaks and quality food lovers. It's tea was supposed to be famous too but I found it wanting for 20-30 bucks a cup. Too much oil in all the food prepared. Only food that I liked was the Lassi. Experience was a dampener.

The best food corner in Bhawanipore. Pocket friendly. Serves you the best sarso ka saag n makke ki roti- since winter's here.  The aalo k paraathe - waaow- with that chutney make you go crazy. Same with the paneer tikka. Forget your diet for one day and enjoy eating at BSEH- at a reasonable charge. Tea is cannot be compared with anything in Kolkata.  
N.B- They don't charge you for their good service- so if you handover a tip- their smile says it all.

Dhoodh cola was as usual great and it would seem as in huge quantity if u are not with a gang. Food was great..be it rotis..paneer..palak..dals. The thing to be improved is management. Attenders tend to forget the orders placed or bring wrong orders, thus keeping the customers waiting. Otherwise, I loved this place.

Situated at Bhawanipore near the Sharma's Tea House, this place came to sight at the perfect moment. We were damn hungry and this place did not let us down. We had Butter Naan, Garlic Naan along with Sarso da Saag, Shahi Paneer and Dal Makhani. Dal Makhani was delicious, saag was okay, while Shahi Paneer had a tinge of sweet. Lassi was served in bhaad. It was not that heavy even after we had a full dinner. Worth a visit.

Well what to say regarding this awesome place !! One of the very few places of the city which remains open after 12! One of the very very few places where you get no. 1 quality Punjabi food! And, one and only place where u get thier brand marked amazing TEA!!
 Wanna hang out at night with friends over some tea and snacks!! Head straight to this place!! Wanna have some late night Punjabi makkai ki roti with sarso ka saag or palak paneer? The address is this place!! 
This place has become our hide out place for late night.. Park the car, order some Tea, lassi or gulab jamun and just chill! :D ... 
Being one of the very few late night joint, people across the city flock here at night. Sometimes u may spot youngsters in their open hooded BMW or Audi playing loud thumpy music and enjoying making the ambio even more electric!! Don't worry, there are lot of people like us too who arrive there in their  i10 or swift ! :P ... The place becomes crowded with the buzzing crowd at 12 o clock! Something very rare in Kolkata! 

Really cool place to hang out with friends or to have a late light family dinner in car! 

Keep doing the awesome job guys!!

The tea here is good. Though they open up late night, but still they serve stale food and it  tastes yukk. For the service part I would prefer not say anything, it blew away my mind. Lol. Considering it a kind of dhaba ya its ambience is sort of a national highway dhaba with chaos all around. However feeling it to be in a prime location like Bhawanipore and still going on with that condition of food and service, I would say, someday it will only be known as a tea junction for the public in town.

Located near bhawanipur Gurudwara. I had been there for two times with my friends. Good place for student hangout as the foods are quite cheap. Every time we went there, we drank Dudh-Cola  (Coca Cola mix with milk ) on which it is quite famous . But I would like to rate it 3 out of 5 as their interior is not clean enough and they do not maintain any organised way for reception.

This place is not a restaurant really... an eatery which does not score anything as far as decor and ambience is concerned. Its really a dirty place where hygiene and cleanliness do not figure amongst the restaurant's list of priorities. Service is decent. The place is completely vegetarian so well beware :p The food is really good and the pricing is very decent. And the real good thing about this place is its open nearly all through the night. I would recommend it only if you are out of places to eat in the middle of the night after partying hard.

The best place for the best tea in this city ! I love the ambience of this place. Right under the gurudwara ! The chai is just amazing . The famous doodhcola is a must try for everyone who visit kolkata for the first time just like the rossogolla! The kachoris are also very good in taste. In the morning one will always find the groups of oldies and groups of young people sitting and chatting with their bhar of chai. Its just so refreshing to view such places.

Went to this place quite recently but had a very very poor experience. Plates were not washed properly and there were no side plates as well. Water was served in very low quality glasses as compared to the very high prices of the dishes available in the eating house... On asking for some sugar, it came after 20 mins. Water was spilled in the table next to us. Even on asking nobody even tried to clean up the place. Food was not served hot and it lacked taste. Nan was rock hard and it was very difficult to even chew it.....A cockroach was crawling on the floor as well. Hav gone to almost all the restaurants in kolkata but never seen such a dirty, filthy and poor eating house. Waiters lacked courtesy and agility ... all in all a very poor experience.. shame on the management.. would recommend azad hind dhaba or jai hind dhaba to this shack

It is almost 100 meters away from sskm (PG hospital).we usually  use to  have steamed tea from here.really awesome tea.Among the food items I usually prefer palak cream spl,mixed vegetables, dal makhani and tandoori roti with butter. Another things is spl for this dhaba(we called) that is Doodh cola(milk with coca-cola). I like it. Not  a good place for family Hangout.

The only advantage of this place is it remains open whole night.So anytime at night if you are clueless about where to have small bites...then you can drive your way to Ballygunge!!!The food and tea is so-so and nothing extraordinary!!! Even have had Lassi and aloo k parathe which again was average! The doodh-cola is a super flop!!

'Oldest dhaba in city of joy' they claim in their liflet menu..might be true..but I think retirement time is near for this 'old' eating house.
At 6:30 pm,I stepped in and the surrounding gave me a jerk..papers,leftovers,empty bottles and cups were scattered all around. Apart from ambiance, I made my mind for a good food experience.
Soon,I got the info from waiter that dudh-cola is not available under one litre. So,ordered alu paratha. In the meantime,I saw a little rat was moving on the floor,eating the leftovers.!!!!!!!!! My god!! 
Paratha came after 15 min, a sideburn stuffed paratha,with low quality liquid curd and some achar. Forced myself to finish the dish. An avarage taste.
When came out,found no reason to come back again.

3 for the delicious aloo paratha only, otherwise really unfriendly place to visit. At 7 o'clock, the entrance was full with morning walkers but inside was empty on a busy day of mahalaya. Club kachori was unavailable and only options were aloo paratha and south Indian foods. The boy serving food was really unfriendly in serving our orders. It took him 15 minutes to reach our table but he was roaming to our next table. Even when club kachori was available and he was serving those to others coming after us, he was denying to serve the same. We asked him multiple times but he was avoiding. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY.

I with my parents had to visit SSKM hospital for an emergency on a Saturday evening and when we came out it was already 11 o'clock. We were worried where we should have our dinner. Then my father suggested this restaurant. Since we were in no mood to have non veg, we headed to this joint.
    Walking distance from SSKM hospital and close to gurdwara and opposite to gupta brother's. A small restaurant with very basic table and chairs. No such decoration is there. Non air-condition interior and very congested sometimes a bit suffocating. 
   Since we wanted to keep it simple we went for plain roti, Palak paneer, aloo matar and green salad. Within 12 minutes they served it. I must say the rotis were hot fresh and very soft. Palak paneer was tasty and not very rich. Aloo matar was very oily though was tasty.
Amount of food is very satisfactory and price is pocket friendly. Service is very fast.

I wanted to visit this place from a long time and finally I visited. The food was ok ok. Dal makkhani had stones (kankar) in it and that totally spoiled my mood. It's congested and the ambiance is not so good. It's famous though I didn't like it.
After hearing a lot and reading eeviews for doodh cola I wanted to try it. It is even mentioned that the place is know for the doodh cola but trust me it was horrible. My biggest mistake was to order a doodh cola. And according to the prices listed, the food is not good.

One of the best place to have lassi, samosa, tea n all the Punjabi dishes you want to explore. Situated just beside Bhawanipur gurudwara, the taste of their paratha is just awesome. But in weekend or in the morning time it's difficult for one to have his dishes due to the rush.

Balwant Singh's Eating house is synonymous to tea for most of the tea lovers like myself. The north Indian is quite disappointing when it come to flavours. The snacks on the other hand is something to opt for. The place can be enjoyed most in your car or by sitting outside rather than the humid atmosphere inside. The service does lags a little but when you see your cup of kesar tea being served you definitely end up forgetting all those.

We've all had tea at various places, from the ubiquitous tea-stalls around our neighbourhood to the more reknowned tea-shop chains, but your experience in tea tasting won't be complete without trying out the tea here. Balwant Singh's dhaba, as it's popularly known, is a place for nostalgia. Sipping the tea from an earthen pot in the early hours of the morning (or late night hours depending on your point of view) with your family or friends is a memorable treat. As for the food it's pretty good. Taste the 'Sarson Da Saag' when it's available on the rare occasions. For the adventurous there's the 'Doodh Cola/Pepsi', believe me it's not as weird tasting as it sounds. The seating upstairs is nothing special though the service is alright & if the surroundings make you feel uncomfortable there's always takeaway.

Been there so many times as its near my sister's home.. Everytime hoping that the arrogance of the staff will reduce but no luck so far.. When u cater only to take away or drive In diners then also a eatery is expected to serve atleast filtered water. But to my horror i found that even the ac restaurant up stair cannot afford to serve their customers with filtered water. The choice is either packaged water or tap water with out any filteration. Well, if one can manage traffic cops on a major junction then defi they can manage food inspection department and run an ac restaurant without even provision for filtered water. Well on the positive side I can say that they are consistent people.. be it their staff arrogance or the loud noise made by their floor( made of tin sheet) in the middle of your meal as anyone walks on it..

It's Balwant Singh Dhaba today for a quick dinner. A decades old place which gives a very nice steam chai for your group. Never forget to have a small pot of tea from this place. 
The ground floor is not at the place for spending a good time. It's not at all clean with used tissues and cups kept in the corners. You'll have a very good experience of Dhaba in its food. I had Paneer Butter Masala, Dal, Mushrooms Do Pyaza with Roti and Zeera Rice. Overall it's good as it fulfills your expectations. 
Finally it's tea which made perfect climax. :-)

And not to mention the doodh cola. 
One of the few joints who are open till around 4:00 in the morning this place is like a life saver for all those people who are out there enjoying the night. 
Though strictly veg and the ac-section a bit costly it does serve mouth watering parathas & vegetarian of North Indian cuisine.

This is pure vegetarian punjabi dhaba offering mouth watering delicacies like their signature dal tarka and malai paneer just to name a few. Not to mention their famous "doodh cola". They make great chai and samosas to go along with it..

I have been waiting to write about this place for a long time now... This 24X7 Dhaba just beside the Gurdwara is a life saver.. Be it a road trip or late night or early morning drive, this place caters to all hungry travelers at anytime of the day.. One just needs to park in front of the dhaba where a friendly smiling Sardar ji could be seen at most time welcoming all guests, the waiters will run to the car window with the menu card and you can enjoy the food without even getting down. It also has sitting arrangements inside. Coming to the food, the chai in the kulhar is just the thing someone would need in the wee hours of the morning accompanied by their Nimki with pickled chilis. The brekfast menu is standard with sandwiches, outh indian or north Indian. The club kachories were really nice. The jalebis and samosas are also worth mentioning! And of course any visit to that place for me would be incomplete without climbing up the stairs of the Gurdwara once , sitting there for a while and having the yummy sooji prasad dripping with ghee that they distribute!!!

This place is adjacent to Sant Kutiya Gurudwara, Bhawanipore. A pure veg restro , having both a.c and non a.c sections. We chose the upper floor a.c section as it was extremely hot outside. This part doesn't look like a dhaba as it's interior decor gives the appearance of a normal restaurant. We began with Kesaria Tea (good to start with) followed by Aaloo Parantha, Chilly Potato and Paneer Tikka Butter Masala. The Chilly Potato was mouth watering, however I must also add that one not used to having spicy dishes musn't go for this dish as it's extremely hot. I didn't like the Paneer Butter masala much, as it tasted pale comared to the Potato dish. The paranthas being quite thick, I think one each is sufficient for a single person. We also sipped Dudh-Cola , which is the main attraction of this place. They charge 130 bucks for a litre which we divided among us four. This was amazing, milk mixed with thumbs up topped with ice cubes.  I'm definitely going back for Dudh-cola.

Situated beside the Bhawanipore Gurudwara, this is a pure veg dhaba. Though the term 'dhaba' cant be associated properly with this place as the 1st floor ac section here is much like a moderate restaurant. The ambiance is nice with wooden floor and photographs of Sikh people on the wall. Unfortunately the ac was under some maintenance that day so we had to suffer a bit. The behavior of the staff was not that impressive, I expected them to serve the items, but they simply put the dishes on our table and left. I also expected them to serve on steel-plates as it gives the rustic feeling of dhaba, but they served on sophisticated white plates, may be we opted for the ac section, thus missed the rustic charm.
Now about the food:¬†
We had Kesar tea first, served on large Kulhar (earthen tea cups), the quantity was enough, good amount of Kesar was also added in the tea. Though it was refreshing, I feel the price was a bit too much.
For the main course we had Aloo Paratha along with Paneer butter masala & Chilly Potato. The aloo paratha was crispy, tasty and huge. We struggled to eat one & a half paratha each. The paneer dish was good, thick buttery gravy along with soft pieces of paneer. Chilly Potato was awesome, hot & sweet- a bit tangy too. It tasted great along with Aloo Paratha. It was too hot to handle and all of us were gasping for the peppery taste, still I would say it was delicious. The prices of the dishes were a bit high if u compare them to any non-veg dish, but the quantity was very good, two plates were enough for four of us.
Now came the dessert DOODH-COLA, the main reason for visiting this place, as my friend

What can someone say about this place! It's one of my favorite places in Kolkata. Been here at almost every hour of the day. Be it early morning, morning, day, noon, evening or late at 3am! This place has always made me return fully loaded! Tea is awesome! Doodh-cola is probably their invention (to say) and its outta this world! Any paratha here is flawless! This place has made me fall for Punjabi food! Every time I visit this place, I make sure that I go to the gurudwara upstairs! Location is amazing! In short its just awesome!

Been here enormous times and it's absolute fun! Go for breakfast over Kachori sabzi, jalebi n chai or go on evenings for samosa & chai and yet best go for dinner there accompanied by dodh cola. Sit in car and enjoy food or just stay out n gossip while eating. Awesome fun it is to be here!

This place is not bad I would say.
But they need to give attention to cleanliness if they want to retain the attention of foodies.I am not expecting for some eye-catching interior decoration.But at least a hygienic ambience is expeccted.

We ordered Palak Paneer,Tandoori roti,Kashmiri Alur Dum,Khichri and Chai(in earthern pot).
Except the Palak Paneer and Khichri,rest were pretty average and do not live up to the name of this place.Also items are very oily.
I expect them to put up a better show on my next visit.
In short,I would NOT highly recommend this place to someone.

It's a famous and old food joint in south Calcutta. Its known as balwant singh dhaba, located adjacent to "sant kutiya gurudwar" in harish mukherhjee road, bhwanipure. Very hard to get a parking out here. Its a pure vegg dhaba. U will get kachori, doodh cola, lovely alu paratha, chai, paneer kabab,Hot baked tandoori roti along with Dal tadka & Paneer butter masala were the perfect mates on the table for lunch. It was daily fevrit visit place.... very cheap and best food. Evr! Recommended **dhoodh cola**

Again, was on my list for a long time. But never had the opportunity to visit. A couple of days back, when I was with friends near the locality, I decided to finally give this a try. By the time we reached, it was already evening. And we were hungry. We ordered Kachori, Doodh Cola and Chai. Although before serving, we were told that the kachoris were no longer hot, I didn't expect it to be that cold. In that condition, it tasted no better than the ones I get in my locality. The Chai was not worth it that day. I can get a better one in my area for way less price. But that doodh cola. It was weirdly awesome. When I had first heard the name way back, I had thought that it was insane to mix the two together. But now, I am a fan. The ratings I gave are entirely for doodh cola. The rest what I had that day don't deserve a rating. I am definitely coming back for doodh cola if not anything else.

It's very difficult to get out of the campus so we are always looking for opportunities to make our way out of the campus. This time around the opportunity was provided by the Photo walk organized by the Lakeside Lens Lovers of IIMC. Before we set forth, we decided to have a good decent breakfast and one of the seniors suggested this place.

Situated in the middle of the Elgin Road, just beside the Gurudwara, the place is a regular haunt of the joggers and morning walkers of the area, who after the initial exert feast on the delicious meals provided by the place. We also ordered a range of Aloo parathas, idlis, paneer parathas as soon as we sat down. Though must say that I was a little concerned with the hygiene of the place and the general cleanliness of the people serving. But again it was a breakfast rather than a fine dining place. To go with the food, we got ourselves Chai which was served on earthen pots.

Looking forward to visiting this place and trying out the Doodh Cola!

Such an awesome place for¬† authentic dhaba food ! I swear I am not one extra bit exaggerating when I say I tasted the best Kali daal ever here in this dhaba. It's rich, creamy and yummy ! And their Malai Kofta is such a masterpiece. A meal so satisfying with those soft tandoori rotis brings out tears of joy. I am definitely going back there over and over again. (^_^) 

The lassi was kinda let down. Far too thin than you expect in dhabas and well, veryyy sweet.

The place where you  can head out to for a cup of tea, no matter what time it is.  The tea is excellent.  And the '' doodh cola'' pretty good,  once you  get over your apprehensions.  Sit in your car and get a hot cup of tea and some decent tasting samosas and you should leave with a smile. The food is pretty good here.  Though I've always used it as a takeaway. However being a really busy joint in a busy part of the city,  service can get pretty slow.

Nothing beats Doodh Cola in this Dhaba. NOTHING !¬†Moreover, the service is brilliant. What makes you choose this place over other places is that, this Dhaba never sleeps ! The Kofta, the Paneer Butter Masala, The Kali Dal,etc, everything here is so soft and tasty. Garam Gulab Jamuns win your hearts ! I think, if I have to choose a place to refresh my mood,Balwant Singh Dhaba will always be my pick :D

Food quality deserves a much better rating but service and other facilities are the minus points of this restaurant - the owner can do a lot for improving the condition of the restaurant - doodh cola is all time favourite from this restaurant other food items are also good - enjoy the hot tea and sabji kachori during winter season or during the rainy ‚òî season

If its really late, and you crave ghee doused food, head to balwant singhs. Post partying, post a concert, post anything, no one can satiate the alu paratha craving like bsd! Pair it with their kali dal or palak paneer or even chole...yum yum yum! Their paneer tikkas are worth a try and wash it off with their masala cola, doodh cola or even chai. Its unpretentious and true to what it does! Im feeling so happy writing this review!

My sister, who stays in Kolkata has planned a dinner to this place. She had heard about its Doodh-Kola and steam chai. So, we reached Bhavanipur which houses this Dhaba. We saw many people standing outside waiting for their tea. They were serving tea in Kulhad. But, we could not find a restaurant. Then, a guy who was serving tea directed us towards a restaurant which is upstairs near to this place.¬†

After entering the restaurant, it was a great disappointment. The place is completely shady with torn sofas and dirty tables. While walking, you may realize that the floor may fall down. Being hopeful, we ordered for Steam chai, Aaloo do Pyaza, Mushroom Kadai, Stuffed Naan and much heard Doodh-Cola. It took some time for them to serve us food. We asked for tea first, but they served us food. Then, on request they served tea. The food has absolutely no taste, I simply could not eat it. The only thing which made me have few bites was Aaloo do Pyaza. Tea was fine. After we had food, we got a bloating feeling which made us pack doodh-cola.¬†

The ambiance is not worth visiting, the staff is casual and it's expensive for the quality of food they provide. I won't recommend it to anyone who loves good food. It was a disastrous experience.

At last after waiting for 40-50 minutes we go to the counter to complaint about that but the man said they can't help it . At last he said he can give parcel the food so we take that and eat in our car's at last but the food was not liked by anyone of us. So that was the last time we go there.

We ordered jeera rice, dal makhni, shaahi paneer and naan. According to bucks we paid the food was average and eatable.

Early morning tea wid fresh fried nimkis along wid kachoris wid spicy alu curry is heavenly. Gulp that down wid Fresh made Lassi, u r good till lunch. 

Apart from that food is okayish. Good but no miracles. 
Their famous doodh cola is certainly not to be missed. 

Mostly importantly its open almost 24hrs so u can just be sure that atleast one joint is serving good food round the clock in the city. Thats a big assurance for any foodie. ;)

After all that hype that Shaheed Bhagat Singh and his party members used to visit this place for a cup of tea late nights, I was very excited to visit the place .

The place was damn crowded as we reached there at around 12:30 midnight and there were cars parked all over ,both sides of the road. The view was outstanding as we saw hundreds of people waiting or enjoying their stuff.

It is very famous for its tea and a special drink they make known as doodh cola ..

Its a harmonious blend of milk and the aerated cola beverage ... It's unique and one of a kind.

As we had already had dinner somewhere else that night , we decided to taste that specialty beverage of doodh cola

We were three persons and we ordered two doodh cola and one limca cola..
The order taker came to our car where we parked around 20 meters far from the dhaba .. He explained that one portion is of one litre and hence suggested us to have one portion instead of three .

The taste was fabulous as we had never tasted something like that before and it was served super chilled with lots of ice cubes in it to compliment the hot and humid weather of Kolkata .

Overall it was an amazing experience of the heritage restaurant .. 4.5 out of 5 from my side..

Do visit if you are in Kolkata ..

Our Maths Sir Took us to this place one evening. He had spoken about Milk Cola, which we were completely unaware of, and were surprised to hear about such DELICACIES. 

We were 4. We ordered one jug, Maybe it was 1.5 or 2 Litres. It tasted like Malai which was completely unexpected, and was delicious. It was ' Love at First Taste ' .... The sweetness was adequate and the Earthen pot they gave us, according to that, each one of us got exactly 2 pot full. As this place is located close to my school, and I've just passed out, I don't know when I'll get the chance to get back to this place. But I surely want to...
 Before coming to this place, we had kachoris at some roadside place, I don't know the name or location, but it was a famous shop, which thick kachoris... If anyone knows the same, let me know with location, its not  Sharma's.

DO FOLLOW ME IF U LIKE MY REVIEW, I PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT AND POST HONEST REVIEWS.BUT AGAIN, DIFFERENT PERSON HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES AND OPINIONS SO PLEASE READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS. FOR THIS RESTAURANT FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MIGHT HAVE HYGIENE PROBLEMS.

I am a delhite temporarily staying in Kolkata and was craving to get good north indian food. I searched this place through zomato, specially traveled 3 km by a public bus to treat me with some finger linking food. On my first visit I was disappointed. It was not better than a dhabha which mentioned AC on its zomato page but gives you fans. I ordered paneer tikka masala and butter naan and tandoori roti. Although paneer tikka masala was ok to eat, breads were uneditable. They were as if plain dough is served with butter over it. I decided not going to visit ever again. But next time I was passing through the restaurant and saw a gate leading to a restaurant and written AC restaurant, on confirmation I found it was the same restaurant having AC and non AC sections. The service and the quality served was much much better than the last time. Now I will visit it again and again.

Though i had been a regular passerby of this eating house since childhood...i had nvr been here until last week...wen a friend insisted me on having the mouth watering "Dudh Cola" of this place...
Trust me guys...u can nvr quench ur thirst bttr than dis piquant drink which will leave behind a scrumptious effect on ur throat as well as ur taste buds.

Well... Want to put it crisp... Balwant's dhaba is very few of those joints in kolkata which would drag me in, any day for just one single dish or item. Doodh-cola : a havenly confluence of chilled milk and aerated cola. Apart from this , your "must try" list should contain samosa, kesar jalebi and of course Tea.

After a couple of Veggy Friends recommended the food a few times over the last year or so, I finally decided to give this place a try ... Aloo Parathas were just average when compared to Russell Dhaba, Dal Tarka was a real disappointment - completely undercooked ... Paneer Butter Masala Special was most ordinary, mixed Vegetables were just about edible ... Would love to go for their Tea & SAMs/Nimkis again but will not waste a meal on their food ...

The kesar chai is something I've learnt to love and appreciate over years. 
This is a pure veggie place and trust me you won't regret even if you are hardcore non veg like me. 
I've had a lot of food from this place, naan , kulcha paneer and dal makhni remains my favourite. I keep coming back for more. Friendly staff, and light on pocket too.

My trip to Calcutta is never complete without a late night visit with my cousins for the Kesar Wali Kullad Chai..don't get to enjoy such things in Bombay and especially the chai in Kullad..it tastes amazing with all the earthy flavors !!

I hv gone there more than 50 times, its an awsm place to hangout with friends, you can seat outside of the hotel or if u have car they will serve in your car as well, plus point is it is open till 4 in the morning, but its fully veg. There signature items are their chai, dodhcola, paneer tikka, coolfi, tandoori aloo etc..

I love this place... Though located in one of the main thorough ways of Calcutta... The place does cause a lot of traffic snarls and getting a parking place nearby is just put luck of the draw....
I always go there to have either hot chai, dudh cola and the jilebis....

The other stuff is also very good but these three things stand out...

I'm frequently going there for 6.30am or even early for Tea( small , nearly 100ml) and tasty snacks, jalebi, Alu-Bonda etc.
         People enjoy kachouri & very tasty Sabji( curry )& it is always a big croud in the Mrng. & even at 2.00am. 
         Food is good & service is very good, very friendly . I like that place.

But no dhaba like this one.
Paneer Tikka, Rumali Roti, Dal Makhani, Chole, Dudh Cola, Lassi
You just cant afford to miss any of the above lip-smacking, kick-ass food.
You will come again and again to try the same food. I promise.
Whether you are at BHAWANIPUR or not you cant miss this.

Balwant Singh's Eating House is situated juxtapose Elgin Road gurudwara and is always bustling with customers any time of the day. 
I never had an opportunity to dine in because of the uber convenient drive inn so yes I'm definitely a bit lazy but what more do I want other than the company of my friends... 

Ambience: I've always used the drive inn but there's a catch as its a paid parking and of course it's first come first served... Feel lucky if you get a nice spot!!!

Food: 

Special Kesariya (Saffron) Chai: Just mind blowing cup of tea served in earthenware (Khullar) and served with generous amount of saffron. Best Khullar tea of kolkata!!!

Nimki: served hot with fried green chilis, tastes suburb with the tea. 

DoodhCola: This is a masterpiece and you cannot miss this. Its a rather unusual mixture of Milk and Cola blended perfectly and chilled with ice cubes. Served in jar which can be shared with you friends in a Khullar. 

There are definitely many veg items in the menu but if you're here and have not tried the above three items then probably you've an incomplete Balwant's Experience. 

Price: Definitely pocket friendly and typically a bill for two would be around ‚Çπ200.

I'd rate them 4 cause they are just too good with service and the quality of food. Be it breakfast, lunch, dinner or late dinner, they serve you right. The crowd that you see here proves how good it is. The interior ambiance is quite decent but I got only few opportunities to get a place inside as I mostly visited this place post midnight and it's full.

It's the destination for most party people as after the party, it offers nice tummy filling food at a reasonable price. I've been to it multiple times and never was I disappointed with them. A great place it is.

Having heard of this place for years finally got a chance to visit. Did the courage inspite of recent negative reviews. Worst fears came true. Worst dhaba experience ever. We sat at the Ac part upstairs. The Ac were not working , we were sweating there. Ordered kabab platter priced 375, served in a mess like plate in a hotchpotch manner, lacking on quality, quantity and taste, all fronts, served with some tasteless chutney. Main course was too nothing great to say of. Can't say that the management did not listen to, but they did nothing either. Seemed like chalta hain attitude when you have legacy working for you. Even after all these, tries their famous doodh cola, that was something unique, and can be tried. They even parcelled it on request. But not willing to visit the place again.

Came into limelight because of the Gurudwara and then it's Steamed Tea. Now one of the most well known eateries of the town. Go for the Tea, Paneer Tikkas, Bharwaan Aaloo, Kulfi etc. Main course not that great nor the entire dining experience is. A bit over hyped but still enjoyable for tea and desi starters.

Hungry after my tuitions, I rushed to this joint..this is a pure veg joint but non vegetarians won't repent visiting the place..the vegetarian good is so tasty that it won't leave you craving for non-veg.

Ambience is good..so is the food..my favourite is dal tarka, jeera rice and nan..good place to visit but you will find it difficult to get a place if you visit during the rush hours.

Celebrated a cousin's birthday at midnight and then drove down to Balwants for a midnight snack. There were 10 of us and we ordered 2 plates each of Tandoori Aloo, Paneer Tikka and Tandoori Mushroom. Also had their special Chai. Food was simply awesome! Food was served near our cars and quantity was good. Mushrooms were the best.Great VFM and an awesome place for a midnight snack after a long drive.Plan to try them for breakfast sometime for their parathas.

I have tried their rotis and palak paneer and chhole which are decent enough.
I have heard their makai ka rotis are wonderful but they are available only during the corn season so waiting for that time.

When we can't think of a place and are really hungry.. We end up going here for yummy spicy a bit greasy yet tasty food.

Last saturday it was a friend's birthday, and after partying and eating till late at night no one was willing to sleep and we decided to remain awake and to go out n seek a roadside tea stall.. But alas we din't find any so we decided to hire a taxi to this very balwant singh's eatery aka balwant's dhaba to have tea and doodh cola and it was around 2:45 a.m. .. After we got into the cab and were almost near the dhaba i found out on zomato that the timing is till 12 a.m. Crestfallen as we were and were just about to lose hope when we saw lights near balwant's dhaba and to our surprise found the dhaba was open.. We enquired and got to know that they remain open till late night on saturdays.. So guys who want to have chilled doodh cola with ice cubes in kulhars on a saturday (late) night .. Do not hesitate to visit Balwant Singh's Eating House

This place is always hustling and bustling with active waiters and frequent customers both in and out of this eating house! It provides a wide platter for all the vegans including kulchas, naans and makhanis!!

Being a non vegetarian what's more appealing to me is its range of mouth watering open snacks counter- the balwant special chai ( me, being an ardent chai lover), with the garma garam samosas are the perfect combos for my evening snack 
!! The creamy thick Kesar tea is absolute yummy..
Placed adjacent to the gurudwara this place is very lively with take aways and the waiters are quick with the orders.

One special mention has to be given to the signature 'doodh cola'. I was hesitant to try out this one, but trust me I completely fell for it once I tasted this marvelous novelty!! Brilliant- a complete summer drink to quench your thirst!!!You will not be able to have it all at once because they serve you a jar full of this drink..its a must try if you are headed out in a group of four to five people!!!

Though the place does serve good north indian food, but I have been here only for breakfasts. It is a total hustle bustle in the morning, flooded with morning walkers, who prefer chai samosa over walk..  Probably the only place in the city where tea is prepared on steam and not on direct gas burners. The tea is light. Balwant singh operates for around 22 hours a day, so one can imagine d no of tea which is sold per day. In all, one of the places to be in ur list while visiting the city.

Balwant Singh Dhabha, happens to be one of my favorite places in the city, simply for the purpose it serves vegetarian food. A super popular family dhabha, with authentic Punjabi Cuisine in their ranks, this happens to be a treat for vegetarian foodies.

For main course, try out the Butter Nan alongside Paneer Dopiaza, Malai Kofta and Navratan Korma. These supposedly my favorite choice at this restaurant although almost all the gravy items have been tasted at least once.

Try the Doodh Cola, a rare drink one can have and their specialty Steam Tea, which I personally didn't like that much. Overall, for all those veggie foodies, try out this Dhabha for a new experience of having complete Vegetarian food.

Food: It is a veggie's paradise. If you are a veggie and tired of the non-veg obsessed dhabas, you should definitely come here. The food here is absolutely delicious. The paneer items, the dal makhani and the mix veg are too good. You also must have heard of the "Doodh-Cola" available here. I must warn you that despite being the pioneer of such a weird yet awesome drink, they don't make it good anymore. In fact, no restaurant currently makes a good Doodh-Cola. They are better made at home without the water cheat. I rate it 3.5/5.

Ambience: The inside of the restaurant is very plain. It has both A/C and non-A/C sections. The non-A/C section is a bit dirty like most roadside dhabas. They allow you to carry your food to your car or something, have it there and return the plates when your done. Good for a casual outing with friends. I rate it 3/5.

Service: Speed is bit low during rush hours and sadly their rush hours mostly last the entire day. Staff is well-behaved. They used to remain open till very late hours but now they stay open only till midnight. I rate it 3.5/5.
Price: Standard rates. Worth it.
Overall I rate it 3.5/5.

One of the only vegetarian dhabas in kolkata...The food here was good few months back,but recently the standard of food and waiters have dropped considerably...The food contains alot of oil these days waiters cannot handle crowd at night,they get confused and get wrong dishes which you haven't ordered,minimum waiting time is around 30-40 min at night..the food is also half cold...the taste of the food has also become bad..Famous for its dhoodh cola which is next to pathetic now and not drinkable...
Good in the morning breakfast time for tea and samosa,if you want to have dinner then avoid the rush timings.

Here goes in my last review for the "doodh-cola" of balwant singh:
Doodh-Cola is the worst drink which i have ever had. I had this today (14/09/2015) for the last time.
Simply paying ‚Çπ150 (yes they have again increased the prices) for only 6 small servings is an utter waste of time and money.
I am well acquinted with the place so i asked the server to put less ice, out of rage or whatever he had , he made it without ice and the quantity reduced to half!!!!
When questioned, he said it we serve one litre but it was not more than 600ml to the best of my knowledge.
Heavily Dissappointed.

This place is commonly referred to as Balwant Singh Dhaba ..This is a pure veg joint which serves punjabi,north indian and its famous kesaria chai and doodh cola(or rather doodh ice cola)...
I went there to try its most famous drink doodh cola..at the first sip you are like,"what is this"! I personally don't like this at all and also it is half-filled with ice and it becomes so chilling cold and watery after some time that you cannot even drink the last serve..
Other things they serve here is pretty nice like paneer tikka,kulcha,daal and all..
Will drop here again to have chai but not doodh ice cola...

ALL NITE TEA AND FOOD JOINT

One of the only place to have late nights meals and adda zone.

Very much frequented joint for the late night party maniacs to grab tasty food on the go. The same is a preferred breakfast joint as well for all the early risers/walkers.

One can try anything on the menu. It's a complete value for money place.

It's located beside Sant Kutiya Gurudwar and is always crowded with people from¬† early morning to almost midnight.In the morning it is full of morning walkers waiting for their hot cup of tea.It is a vegetarian dhaba and offers one of the best vegetarian food in Kolkata.Palak Paneer,Malai Kofta,Alu do Piyaza,Dal Tarka taste really good and the Butter Naan,Pulao are also nice...But the stand outs are- the Paneer Tikka which simply melts in your mouth,the tea,rich milky and super delicious matched up with a few samosas,the Doodh Cola which is fantastic and the Tandoori Aloo which leaves a mark for many days in your mouth.Cheap but delicious food is here..if you are in Kolkata you should certainly try out this place

I have listen about it a lot. Last Sunday I have visited there. I went early in the morning. I took a hot cup of tea my friend took the most discussed Doodh-Cola well that item was really out of the world. After that we have ordered the traditional Punjabi cuisine makki ki roti with sarson ka saag . it is sessional item and probably very few number of resturents make this item in Kolkata we'll this item is really delicious and another thing I would like to mention the hospitality of the Punjabi gentleman is really great . so in a nutshell this is a pleasure to visit ....

Located just beside the gurudwara in Bhawanipore, this no nonsense eatery provides a haven for foodies. Not particularly pleasing to the eye, the food makes up for what you accept as the Dhaba's rusticity. Waiters seat you down, take your order and disappear for a moment before bringing back the delights you have chosen. Punjabi vegetarian food cannot go wrong! From the peas kachori to the mouth watering paranthe, this eatery dishes out some of the best eats in Calcutta at a reasonable price. 

And the tea!

"Balwant Singh's Eating House" or commonly known as balwant singh dhaba, located adjacent to "sant kutiya gurudwar" in harish mukherhjee road. This is the dhaba which never sleep. It opens up at sharp 6am in the morning and stays open till midnight. Even after its closing at midnight, technically its kitchen stays busy preparing for the morning's breakfast offerings. It is a pure vegetarian dhaba, serving mouth watering delicacies for decades. No one is anonymous to their succumbing offerings like- malai kofta, paneer tarka, daal makhani, naans etc. Their special and signature offering "doodh cola" attracts people from all over the town. Their breakfast delicacies ranging from smoking hot and crispy samosa paired with thick and rich cardamom tea is simply HEAVEN!! It has been quite a while that they have opened up an A.C. section on upstairs, but frankly speaking, enjoying your authentic Punjabi cuisine paired with a tumbler glass of lassi is better enjoyed under the normal room temperature.
This is where history is written everyday.

Balwant Singh 's is a Dhaba which is Veg! Definitely something not expected since Punjabi food is all about chicken mutton and all that, however breaking this clich√©d concept we have this wonderful old Dhaba serving good food. I remember having a veg day yet craving for some heavy food and so we Decided to go there. The lovely chai in the rains was an absolute bliss. We ordered for rice, butter nun, kali dal, paneer dish and the very famous dudh cola. It is the most unique combination I have ever known but I found it really interesting. One must try that at least once. The food is pretty good and is cheap. Very good service and they treat their customers with care and attention.

I was in kolkata in feb this year and was to leave for gangasagar early morning.  As the hotel restaurant had not even opened yet we asked our cabbie to take us to a good punjabi style breakfast place. This is where he took us.  It was very early in the morning but the place had been all cleaned up and to our surprise there were quite few people there. As for the ambience, well I wouldnt want to be there in summer and the place definitely needs a makeover. Coming to the good part this place serves amazing "Raj Kachoris" and this probably why the cabbie brought us here, also the tea in those "Kullars" was very nice, all in all a very good place for a breakfast.

I have been to this place and found it really disappointing. It's "unique creation" is the "Doodh-Kola" which is an over-hyped , tasteless concoction. The food is very average and simple tea is over-priced . The interiors are always crowded and very dirty and the staff doesn't care. This place thrives due to the fact that it's open during late-night hours and has a loyal clientele.

Pathetic service!! but food is moderately good. I visited this restaurant twice and whenever i pass by that road, I always observe the rush. I agree to one of the reviewer's point 'Always a  busy hub for Foodies'. Environment is always lively and a good hangout destination for all. But one will surely find difficult to order their food until and unless one could identify the waiter.

One of the oldest & well known Dhaba of Calcutta.I frequented this place since childhood with my parents for mouth watering "lassi"! It is open 24/7 that is the good part.The prices were reasonable but nowadays there is a hike in them.The ac section on first floor is far better then the unkempt ground floor.However I usually had my dishes served in the car by the staff who are on continuous duty rushing on the roads to serve snacks in cars.so it's been a pleasure for me always, having my favorite lassi in the car itself accompanied by delicious samosa.The tea is also amazing.Overall this place is a hub for addas  be it on the roads or inside the  dhaba or on the first floor.This place is always crowded by huge bunch of people! it is highly recommended for all food lovers! & yea  " lassi lovers"

Always been to Balwant Singh's late at night and picked up food in the car. Last week was the first time actually sitting in the eatery. 
The service was pretty pathetic and it took repeated requests bothering on begging to get them to clean the table at which we were seated.
The samosas at 10 rupees tasted really good. No complaints there.
But the doodh cola(it is now priced at 140) was a lot of ice and a very bland flavour.
I have eaten the naans and the paneer items and if my memory serves me right,they weren't bad either.
Summing up,a place you would be better off taking takeaways from. That too,only when you are very hungry.

Be it the morning or the evening or the most weirdest time of the day, this is a place which is always ready to serve you atleast the tea. I never found it closed. Kesari chai to grilled veg sandwich to singaras and drinks like lassi , masaala cold drinks and doodh cola they have it all. The unique is the Doodh Cola. It will cost you around Rs 140 for a ltr. 
The place if you talk about is never clean and always waters all around and the food is a bit above average. 
Its very very pocket friendly and a must visit.

At first, it sounds pretty gross but when you have it- its amazing. Places like azad hind have tried replicating it, but theyre not even close.

This place was suggested to me several times by my friends before I finally visited it. The ambiance is nothing worth mentioning but the tasty food and the pocket pinch do satisfy you to some extent!

I did not find much enthusiasm like my suggestive friends when it came to their signature dish DOODH COLA. Although they served 1 liter for 120 bucks,we seriously wished it was less and ended up filling our empty water bottles with the drink so that we can offer it to other people in college who would gulp down anything! 

The tandoori roti and paneer butter masala did wipe away my disappointment of the doodh cola. The paneer was soft and the gravy was well flavored. I would love to visit it again for trying other dishes maybe! :)

Balwant has been a regular hangout for me when I was in college. I used to go mainly for the doodh cola in summer and the special chai in winter,
However, in my recent visit I found out the price of doodh cola has skyrocketed to a whopping Rs. 140. :(
I think the quantity has reduced also.
I never liked sitting in the downstairs section after I saw a HUGE rat roaming around once.¬†The seating upstairs is pretty nice.
The food is spectacular. The Palak Paneer and Daal Makhani is a must try. The various rotis are absolutely perfect.
Overall a good place to curb your veggie temptation. :)

This place is almost 100 years old (as suggested by some other local people). This place serves only vegetarian food. Nothing awesome about the place, food and quality but their Tea and Signature DOODH COLA is worth trying (1ltr for Rs.120 only, its better to share with 2-3 people). The place is not soo clean though, try First floor A.C. (but prices is relatively high there).

While I am all for fusion food (and drink?), I found myself not being able to share the enthusiasm of my fellow city-zens when it came to their signature dish DOODH COLA. Although they served 1 litre for 120/-, we were almost left wishing it was less. ¬†So much ice, such little taste.

The PANEER BUTTER MASALA (PLAIN) was as ordinary as they come. The GARLIC NAAN that accompanied it was significantly better, but I felt two pieces - and not one - ought to have been served (as is done at most eateries). The TAWA ROTI was soft and pliable, just as it ought to be.

Hygiene was a let-down on the ground floor. The first floor, where AC's have been installed and the prices are significantly higher, was moderately better in this respect.

The service is as ordinary as the food itself. But that's not its USP anyway.

This place serves you the best garlic naan in the city. It is a veg food joint but you would not miss your non veg items because the food is finger licking good here. The famous drink Dudh Cola is a must try if you are going there for the first time.

Balwant Singh eating house somehow manages to please a lot of people, however, I have never ever managed to like it during my 3 visits.  The issues start right from the time we reach - Parking. If you do manage to find a suitable space, you need to go looking for a waiter wiling to serve you. After much cajoling, the waiter - who doesn't look any different from the taxi cleaners working besides the dhaba - brings the food pretty fast though. The food is undoubtedly hot - but somehow extremely low on taste. I would rate Jai hind and Azad hind much much higher than this place. The only saving grace which allowed me to give it the 2 points is the hot food they serve. A must avoid for me, but then it continues to be the favorite joint for hundreds every day. Guess, the taste eludes my taste buds ... Including their Tea.

The best thing about this place is that if you don't have anywhere to go be it either during an early morning drive or a late night one, you can expect this place to serve you brilliantly any time of the day. Take a break from restaurants, cafes and fine dining and indulge in their lovely Chai samosa and Dudh Cola.

Although having gone to school mere steps away from this eatery, I had never given Balwant's a visit during my school life. For some reason though, decided to grab a quick late lunch here a couple of days ago. We ordered masala kulcha, tandoori roti and shahi paneer. There was a raucous family seated at a table adjacent to ours who decided to throw a tantrum because there food was being delivered late. We sat there, part-entertained, part-horrified at the scene, waiting for our food. Thankfully, they didn't take very long to serve us as the waiter deposited a plate of big fat kulchas and rotis and a boat of paneer butter masala on our table.... wait, didn't we order shahi paneer? But why was this dish dark brown and had chunks of tomato floating in the gravy?

On further enquiry, we were told this /is/ shahi paneer. It had none of the sweet, almost milky taste of shahi paneer I am used to, but had a distinctly sour, tomatoey taste that is pardonable in paneer butter masala. The pieces of paneer were quite small too. The kulcha was fat and piping hot, but frankly I didn't like the stuffing. Sure it had plenty of mashed potato and paneer shavings, but it lacked flavor. They were pretty soft though. My friend decided to order a plate of Kashmiri aloo dum and butter naan. When we asked the waiter how many pieces of potatoes will there be, he said 3 whole potatoes. But on arrival, we found it contained only three halves and costs 90INR which is really steep for a place like this. On top of it, the Kashmiri aloo dum too had a overtly tomatoey sourness to it. Not a good dish at all. The butter naan weren't particularly small and much smaller than the ones you get in Arsalan and Alibaba's.

As for the hygiene, I did not expect a clean dining area, but did I expect flies whizzing around from table to table? No. 

So overall, I had a pretty disappointing experience. Next time I am around and in mood for vegetarian food, I'd head to Gupta Bros.

An outlet which comes with a long history behind it. The tea and the doodh cola is fantastic and you will see a long line of big cars waiting outside it to be served. Has opened up an AC outlet and a snacks outlet as well so that improves the things but if you go into the old outlet, you will be utterly disappointed. Wooden tables and benches, very hot, waiters sweating away to glory and you would even see a rat racing through the floor. The kachori/aloo and jalebi is good and worth a try. So with the history behind it do drop by and have a chai or the doodh cola. But if u wanna sit and have you may try the AC part of the same

Location: Elgin Road; Near Gol Mandir.

In my childhood, this place was one of my favourite spots for lunch or dinner, always a takeaway though. And thereafter, became a spot to have outstanding tea and kachori Sabji during college days. But, sad to say, this place has taken the downhill route. 
The crowd still goes back to this place either because of nostalgic connections or coz' of being one amongst the few late night eateries or just because of tea, Lassi or savories. Rarely do I doubt, people consider this place as an option for the North Indian fare. Better options available. This place would lose on customers if the food quality isn't brought back to its original taste! 

- Dal Makhani
Has simply lost the old flavors. Now, seems to be a of a runny consistency. The old thick consistency is missed. My taste buds refuse to recognize it as "Gurudwara ka Dal", the way I used to call it as a child. :-(

- Paneer Butter Masala
The Paneer is still succulent and the gravy holds the same old flavors. Just that, the oil/butter content has increased. 

- Masala Kulcha
I miss the old flavorful filling, the chopped coriander leaves on top along thinly grated carrots. What remains of it now is just the carrots on top. The filling has lost its flavors and the coriander leaves are yet to be found.

- Butter Naan 
Soft and loaded with butter. Tastes so good! 

- Tandoori Roti
Perfectly baked. Being a takeaway, the crispness doesn't remain. Acceptable.

- Rumali Roti
Thinly all purpose flour breads. Was definitely thin, but, wasn't perfectly baked. Tasted all floury.
A few more seconds of baking would have done the miracle.

- Doodh Cola 
Used to be great, but I suppose the eatery has taken a profit maximizing plan and have worsened the quality. 
Less of milk and cola, more of ice! 

- Kesar Tea 
More or less tastes the same.

- Lassi
Thick and tasty. Has the right balance of sweetness. Happy.

The staff is efficient and polite.
Prices are pocket friendly, but, with such a quality it would definitely feel a pinch.

A below-average experience in total.
- Wish I could rate it higher on the basis of nostalgia. But, sadly, the current scenario is such. Memories remain memories.
- Still in search of the quality of food it earlier had. The current quality would make you feel bloated.

Balwant Singh was always a favorite for its lovely piping hot food followed with its great tea especially late in the night, but last few years i have felt the quality of tea to be very inconsistent.

Located near Bhawanipore Gurudwara, they serve you in your car and also have a pretty big air conditioned seating space. Parking has become bit of a hassle in last couple of years. The staff generally seems to be in a hurry yet listens to you and eventually serves you well most of the time but pretty quick all the time. Hygiene is a bit of an issue but definitely better than azad hind or a russell dhaba in my opinion.

The food here is really good and i prefer some roomali roti with their dal makhani and panner do pyaza. Thats what i have been ordering for years and no other dish gives me that satisfaction. They serve dhoodh cola which is supposed to be a signature offering but i am not so fond of it. The kesaria tea served is generally very good.

Overall good food at very reasonable prices. Basically its food is still dhaba food but post renovations, they dont seem like one !!!

If you want to eat vegetarian dhaba food then this is the place! I'm not someone who can sit in the a.c section and eat as it's not very hygienic so we either eat in the car or take it home! the malai paneer tikka and tandoori aloo are starters I like! in the main course I've had the kadai paneer which was good and garlic naan! the dal we ordered was real bad! balwant is known for its doodh cola and there are few instances I miss having it when am there :)

Balwant Singh Eating House - A pure Veg place which stays open till late night. 

Location:
Balwant Singh's  Eating House, Commonly known as Balwant Singh Dhaba is located near the Sant Kutiya, Gurudwara and is quite famous as a location for the Night Goers as it operates through most of the night. 

Brief: 

Had been here with my brother to try the famous Doodh cola. I think i started drinking this drink at 80. Now, this drink has started costing 120 bucks per jug. Well, nevertheless, i had tried this last time too but they had filled more than half of the jug with ice. This time i made sure the same thing should not be repeated again. 

What i ordered:

Doodh Cola - Despite me making a request not to add on the ice, the waiter added on more than half of the jug with ice to bloat. I told him on his face to reject it. He didn't argue much and did it and told him to add just 5-6 ice pieces and not fill on the whole jug with ice. He did the same and the quantity reduced to half a jug. I asked him where is the other half. He said we just serve this much only (he thought i am coming here first time). The ground floor place was totally tacky!! I haven't been to the above A.c. section so no idea. 

I mean there was no flexibility at all towards the customer and i was quite disappointed on how they served me that day. It was one of my favorite spot to drop by and have on the paneer tikka, aloo tikka and chai. But they have degraded over time.

Conclusion:

If you guy's keep serving like this to seek maximum profits and care not even an 'inch' about your customers or take their consent on granted, believe me. The eating house won't prosper. 

Review 2: 
Location : Balwant Singh's eating house is located beside sant kutiya, gurudwara and serves pure veg food and famous 'doodh cola.'

Coming to the pros and cons

Pros :
1) food is delicious 
2) service is fast
3) newly renovated
4) is always crowded
5) located in posh area
6) purely vegetarian
7) reasonably priced

Cons:
1) hygiene not maintained
2) dirty almost all the time
3) tables not properly cleaned

Must try: Doodh cola though filled with ice totally is still its speciality. Please put less ice more of milk and cola.
Veg biriyani, tandoori paneer and aloo, and tandoori roti wd paneer butter masala.




Went Yesterday(9th june 2014) - Recent News- 
-Doodh Cola prices gone up to 120 bucks per half jug( as other half is ice.)

The doodh cola as always is filled with ice. This time i had made it a point to tell them not to add so much ice on it. Despite me saying, the guy added it and i rejected the cola. Thereafter, told him to make fresh doodh cola and add not more than 5 ices. When he served me the jug it was just half. I asked him where is the other half? he said whole jug costs 2 doodh cola. i was like you think i am a fool and i am coming here first time? Hardly 25-30 bucks(Cola 10, Milk and sugar rest, and ice)  is the total cost and you guys even can't provide some flexibility towards your customers? It's disgusting and a disgrace.

They call themselves eating house. But, it's a dhaba. Hygiene is still the same (Talking about the ground floor condition. not yet been to the above ac section). (Tip system still prevails). Food wise it's moderately fine.

The idea of me stepping into a completely vegetarian dhaba was something of a first for me. But my friend, along, was a complete veggie and having heard a lot from her, about this place, I dared to venture in. And I thank the yummy stars I did!

The place is a complete no-nonsense. Simple table and chairs, no glam quotient, but when it comes to food, I still lick my fingers. As a safe bet I tried their naan and paneer butter masala. Served piping hot, the butter had well merged with the dish and the naan was a beautiful balance of crispiness and softness. Also their dal tarka has this amazingg depth to it, which I rarely found even in some prestigious north Indian hotels. Oh, yes, the lassi was a complete hit too. But I strongly recommend you have it after you've had your meal, else, you'd be partly full, and then won‚Äôt be able to enjoy your meal.

My only regret to date is as we stepped out, I purposely overlooked the beautiful, full-bodied jelabis there. Oh, I so wish I had some. Sigh.  But you better not miss them, for a whiff of it confirmed how awesome it would have been.

This place is a must visit for those who want to get over the monotony of an otherwise non-veg dominated Kolkata.  And as for me, I‚Äôm waiting for my next trip to Kolkata for a second bite here.

Since i live in the locality i have been a regular here.  i can safely say that it is the best dhaba in calcutta. I am a big fan of their Daal makhani and kesariya chai. This is the place to be when you want dinner served in your car. Service is prompt. Late night parties, chai gupshup, post 31st night dinner or a long drive... I just need a reason to go there.

Doodh Cola. That's what drew me to this place initially. A cocktail of milk and coke, with lots of ice- shaken and not stirred !! Nothing better to beat the heat.
Another plus is it's open very late into the night, so you can drop in anytime. Mostly for take aways- best if you have your car parked nearby- there are waiters to serve you in your vehicle.
Its a veg joint, and has mostly north indian fare.
Lastly, the tea here is one of the best in kolkata !

a typical punjabi dhaba also serving few indo chinese food like chilli paneer.... I love their food and specially their effort of bringing typical punjabi food habbit in kolkata like serving food inside the car.. i love it... about their service, its very nice and prompt... and with their service in car and also inside the restaurant is appreciated... they also serve food just outside their restaurant where they have put a couple of tables where ppl can stand and enjoy their food... its a very rest for vegeteriqns... the best part about them is that they are open late nights...
their innovation towards mixing milk with carbonated drinks is really good for summer... 
highly recomended for vegeterian food lovers...
JUST ONE TIP IF YOU VISIT THE REST. FOR SIT AND DINE.. PLZZ AVOID GOING TO THE AIR CONDITIONED PART WHICH IS UPSTAIRS.... QUALITY AND TASTE OF FOOD IS FAR BETTER DOWNSTAIRS...
overall a must visit place in kolkata

The Only time during summers here in the city of joy, I want to go out is in the wee mornings or once the sun has set. So here i am sipping a hot kesar chai @ the Balwant Singh's. They should start a little early in summers.

Here in this part of the city you can notice the morning walkers and the morning gulpers too. After burning a lot of calories, they deck up some more eating samosas, kachuris and some sweet delights like the Jilebi. So slid down a few myself and was ready for the long ride home. But suddenly noticed someone eating a sandwich. Don't look at me like that, we all do the same. So went in and ordered one for me. It was good. After satisfying my envy i returned home in a blissful mood.

I don't know why but I just love this place obviously not because of the ambience but their food! Kesar wali chai and their tandoori food are my personal favourite.. though a north-indian outlet but doesn't serve non veg as the dhaba is attached to a gurudwara.. The best part is they even serve u food in ur car for the days u are too lazy to step out :P

Say Balwants and the immediately I see images of Doodh Cola! I have wonderful experiences of school days when we stopped at Balwants for just the Doodh Cola not because I liked it, but because my friends loved it. They serve it in chai bhars which is a unique concept. 

This is more of a dhaba which serves vegetarian food. However weird the idea of vegetarian food in a dhaba like place is, this place makes good mushrooms nonetheless. I personally like their samosas, over which you can chitchat if you do not mind the rustic ambiance. Usually crowded, Balwants is a must visit for its Doodh Colas. Other dishes are pretty basic.

Remember those windy evenings, Or those chilled mornings, When every Indian craves a cup of tea. And a good one too! 
Located beside gurudwara at Harish mukherjee road, Balwant dhaba offers just the kind of tea. It is heavenly and refreshing and different and everything good. Everything that will make you want to come to this place often, which I do obviously. 
 Most of the time, It's for a refreshing cup of tea which they serve in the mud bowl or whatever they call it and samosas and chutney. But there have been times when I visited this place to have the club kachori and sabzi  and once even for naan and dal tarka.
 I have to tell you that I love the tea the best. The club kachori and sabzi is fine. So are the samosas because I have eaten better samosas . But nothing compares to the tea. The daal tarka at balwants is great too. But I say again, The tea is the ultimate winner. They even have variety- the normal tea and the kesaria tea. Both of them works for me.
This place is also famous for serving a drink called DOODH COLA. Honestly, I haven't tried it yet even though I have visited this place ample number of times. Some people love it but Just the idea of cold drink mixed into milk doesn't go well with me. Maybe I am missing out on something great but it's Ok. 
Balwant's doesn't burn a hole in your pocket either. It's very cheap compared to other dhabas and is totally worth it!

There was a time when I and my office colleagues would visit this place every morning after work for breakfast (yes we do night shifts) but nowadays we have restricted ourselves to just Saturday's, the breakfast menu is not that extensive though they have introduced a few items recently I was surprised to see Maggi and Pasta among the newly introduced items apart from that there are "parathas" (aloo, gobi,paneer) whichever catches your fancy, idly, sandwiches (grilled/normal) and of course different varieties of samosas but apart from the regular samosa the other varieties are usually not always available to us probably because we drop in quite early around 6 am so our regular fare would be "kachouris" which comes in 2 sizes. Our group is not that big around 4-5 people and the bill is always around Rs.350, never burns a hole in the pocket. Now I can go on and on but instead should stop but before I end I should say among those countless "adda" sessions over piping hot tea this is the place which they say "legends are made of".

We reached Balwant Singh's around 9.30 pm in the night, cold and wanting tea. The place was mostly empty, and we decided on tea and samosas because both of us were not hungry and we wanted to just sit and chat. The joint was clean, and we got the samosas, with the chutney on the side. We loved them so much that we went for a second round, along with tea. The boy asked us whether we wanted normal tea or kesariya. We did not want Kesariya, so went for regular tea, and it was not too sweet or too strong - just perfect for a wintry night. The waiters were easygoing and did not mind us talking and just lingering over the tea. Our grand total was around 60-70 rupees.



----- 19 Apr, 2013 -----

The key to eating at Balwant Singh's is to accept that cola and vanilla ice cream are good friends, because I absolutely crave the Doodh Cola at times! Another thing that has kept me happy are cups of tea and the incredibly filling parathas, which we order a lot. I am a total mushroom malai tikka fan, and can down a few plates of it easily, and the Dal Makhani here is GOOD. I do sometimes lament the fact that this place is vegetarian, but then I completely get compensated by the food. 

Ambiance is well... um... rustic. But otherwise, a place where you dont need to pretend, just eat.

Before packing my bags and moving to Chennai, I went on an eating spree in Kolkata, visiting almost every place famous for Bengali food, Street food, late night food and the list goes on.

Balwant Singh Eating House was 1st on my list (not because of taste or ranking, it was on my way). We visited around 10:30pm at night and the place was swamped with teenagers, families, party goers and office workers (like my group). You can see the group of guys enjoying hot tea with their latest gupshup, then this car packed with teenage girls stopped by to taste doodh cola (this place is famous for their doodh cola), sedans with their glasses up ordering food by opening the window enough for their voices to reach the waiters and then there was us, all high on energy and excited to taste the food and hit the road for our night long road trip.

The restaurant serves only veg items and my colleague swore that this is the best veg food joint for veg lovers, they have a non-ac eatery at the ground floor and air conditioned one on the 1st floor. We head towards the 1st floor space and took the table towards the end of restaurant, the place can seat up to 25-30 customers. The floor is wooden and might make noise when you walk but that just adds to the rustic feel of a dhaba.

It was time to order and we were like pack of wolves waiting to dig in and clean the plates in no time. We ordered chili baby corn, Paneer in cashew gravy, butter paneer, paneer tikka, and garlic and butter naan. Paneer tikka was nice and the seasoning was ok on the contrary chili baby corn was sour and tasted old. Paneer main course was nice, the gravy was creamy and we enjoyed it till the gravy was wiped clean with our garlic and butter naan. However there wasn‚Äôt much of a difference between both the paneer dishes, we asked the waiter about the difference and he had no clue.

It was not time to head down for the famous doodh cola. The cola started a never ending debate in my group, there were few who loved the cola and wanted to order more and the other who donated their cola to the other half who loved it. I didn‚Äôt like it much, it‚Äôs just milk and cola and by adding massive amount of ice the flavor gets even more diluted, they need to think of maintaining the consistency of the drink and I would love to give it another shot.

While 2 of my group mates were still fighting on the cola, other 2 were staring away at people, I saw a guy in front of the restaurant selling kulfi, they had kesar & custard apple with falooda available that evening and it made my evening worth it.
Will I go to this place again? Maybe, it‚Äôs not in my ‚ÄúI will never visit this place‚Äù list.

My review for Balwant Singh will make it a hat-trick of Reviews for Vegetarian Restaurants in Kolkata .... this is a place I have frequented forever and in the good old days when we partied hard and partied often we would land up here regularly for Chai or Doodh Cola (personally not my cup of tea but my friends loved it ). Now the place is all jazzed up and has been given a face-lift with an A.C. Section so it packs quite a crowd. Give the Paneer Tikka , Paneer Butter Masala , Alu Do Piaza , Dal Tadka a shot with the Tandoori Roti or Naan. End with Gajar ka Halwa or Gulab Jamun ....Worth a visit in the winter months. Or go visit for breakfast for Kachori Subzi with their wonderful Chai .



----- 18 Apr, 2013 -----

The first thing that comes to mind for most people when you mention Balwant Singh is Doodh Cola .... not  for me though I prefer my cola plain ! However the food at Balwant Singh is really good ..... open till past midnight its a place we often end up there on a saturday night when its packed ! The Tadka Dal , Paneer Butter Masala and Tandoori Roti or the Alu Paratha are my favourites ..... wash it down with a cup of Balwant Singh's famous chai ! Keep in mind two things it serves only vegetarian fare and its far better to be served in your car as cleanliness is not its strong point.

One of the most visited eating joints of Kolkata and one of my favourites. Love the north Indian cuisine here and the doodh cola is a speciality. And the steamed chai...... 
It is one of those few joints which cater for 22 hours a day!
Though the dalda used for cooking is awful for health, the food is yum and very pocket friendly, a meal for 2 shouldn't cost any more than 400 bucks.
And sanitation wise this won't go down well with all...:D
With friends, a nyc place:)

this place is good for chai, dhhodh cola and snacks. The north Indian food is not that good. There is no wow factor with the north indian food.

I visit ‚ÄòBalwant Singh's Dhaba‚Äô after a long time to taste their specialty drink 'Doodh Cola', it‚Äôs a mixture of Milk and Thumbs Up. Its taste very very unique but they should put less ice and more of milk and cola. 'Doodh Cola's  price is 120/- per liter enough for two people. Ambience is very ordinary and staffs are okay also parking is a big difficulty here. ‚ÄòBalwant Singh's Dhaba‚Äô is heaven for tea lovers. Balwant Singh stands nowhere if we compare it to other big dhabas in the city but to try that special drink ‚Äòdoodh cola‚Äô, it is a must visit for everyone.

The quality of food used to be much better, but now it has deteriorated. After jogging when I went there, the milk provided was too watery. During dinner time, when I went there recently, Malai Kofta was ordered and they gave something peculiarly different.

Balwant singh dhaba is one of my favorite eating joint in Kolkata. Their chai & doodh cola is a must try. Their  mix veg, dal fry, dal tarka, paneer butter masala, palak paneer , mushroom do pyaza & their tikkas are just yummilicious. One thing which i like about the place is, if you have a car, you dont have to wait in a queue. Their service is fast and they serve food at an affordable rate. But the hygiene is a big concern.

this place is a favourite snacking joint at my college. situated right beside the harish mukherjee road gurudwara balwant serves the best tea in town. a large special tea priced at Rs. 24 doesn't deter the morning walk crowd lining up here. lately they opened up an ac restaurant upstairs serving only veg food. the food there is not that but the samosas and the pander pakoras are pretty decent. I would like to add that they serve tea way beyond midnight, as mentioned here on zomato, and becomes the joint serving cure to hangover to all those clubbing in the wee hours of the morning. but make sure one thing that you try the doodh cola or the doodh fanta which is kinda their signature drink. and don't complaint about the extra ice in the doodh cola cause it is what prevents the milk from curdling as said by the very man who very invented the drink.

Balwant singh's dhaba as this place is popularly known as is a very popular haunt of students of the nearby colleges. Its light on the pocket, offers yummilicous food and is the only place in that locality open to feed hungry souls early in the morning. The kachori sabzi & kesar chai are to die for.. but this place is most famous for doodh cola which is finger licking good.. dont go by the outside look of the place.. just walk in with a bunch of friends and enjoy! I was initially tempted to give 4.5 but will cut my rating by 1 point because of the hygiene factor.. something really should be done about the flies that abound this place and how shabby & dirty the place is .. other than that all is well!

What all should i say for this place! Amazing, always! The CHAI they have is amazing, prepared in a different way too. Paneer Tikka, Aloo Tikka, a must have everytime! Their chatni is totally lip-smacking. There have been times when I have gone with my cousins to have paneer tikka from here at 12 at night! Another specialty they have is the 'Milk Cola'. I have no clue how it's prepared but a mixture of Milk and Coke, tastes great! Do try this whenever you go here. Serving food to your car itself is fun eating too and the waiters are co-operative and keep suggesting you what they have. Talking about the cost, not a very expensive place but not cheap as well. It would cost you something between 400-500 for 2. BON APPETIT.

I found this eatery rather overhyped, as apart from its cult doodh cola and paneer tikka plates, nothing else is worth it.. The naan and dal makhani taste really below average. The vegetables, again, have oil simmering in the container and extremely spicy. For authentic punjabi food, I would definitely not recommend "Ballu's", but for Calcutta's cult doodh cola, it is a must visit for everyone visiting here!

Well, Punjabis are famous for butter and dahi.This dhaba is not an exception of that tradition. I can guarantee, you can't forget the lassi once you have tasted! Besides this, it's a cool place to hangout. It's cost effective too. but one little thing..a better service is expected!

I love Balwant Singh's dhaba, it's a place for fantastic food at great prices. You can definitely look beyond the cramped seating and the not so awesome ambience because the food is lip-smacking good. The Doodh Cola is the one drink that is the hallmark here. You have gotta try it to admire how amazing this weird concept of adding Cola to Milk can get. Very good place. I like.

You just wanna have an adda with friends with little food bseh is the best place, have tea, samosas, lassi. It'll be worth it.

Balwant Singh's Eating House - you need to be very selective of what ur ordering here! This is a real good eating joint but stick on to its popular eating delicacies, I mean when it comes to proper North Indian food, this dhaba becomes just like any ordinary restaurant in the city..!

Some of its popular picks-
Paneer Tikka-the Best I've had in the City..!
Doodh Cola- A different thing to try out..!
Bhaand waali Chai- you'll ask for another cup for sure.:)
Kachori sabji- A good breakfast option..:)
Mashroom tikka, tandoori tikka and other tikka options- Equally good..!
Sarsaon da saag and makki ki roti- Must try, however this is seasonal..!

Now..thats it and thats all..Balwant Singh has very limited good optons and apart from that everything is very average..!
To be honest..I didnt like the North Indian..not at all..! The Naan was not worth eating. The Kadai Paneer was watery and the Dal tadka was very ordinary..! May be a lot many people like it but after eating at Jai hind-ur standards are set very high and you wouldnt like thier North Indian at all..!
The Ambience-well what to say, Iv always ordered from the car and had with the plate on the bonnet..so you can say that the Ambience is Rusic and earthy..!
Its a good eating joint-no doubt, but Id stick to my old favourites going forward.
I tried its north indian not once but thrice- but everytime there was a dissapointment, so now Im convinced very completely that Balwant Singh stands no where if we compare it to Jai Hind..!
So given an option for food- prefer Jai hind..! and If you wanna have something light-then Balwant Singh is the option for you with its amazing tikkas and doodh cola aur Chai..!

To wrap it up..you guys have a lot of scope to improve the Punjabi/North Indian main course..!
Cheers.

Heard a lot about the " Doodh-Cola " of Balwant Singh's Dhaba. Had it today. Must say its a bit overrated. 

You can taste the cola, and the doodh at the same time, but that's not great chemistry.

You can't just mix random things and come up with "special inventions".

For the doodh cola:   2.5/5

Well, i love this place because of the superb tea which they prepare in a glass-shaped clay vessel..... Ambience is very ordinary and staff are okay. Its completely a vegetarian dhaba with non a.c sitting arrangement on the ground floor and a.c sitting arrangement on the first floor.
I am mainly fond of their tea which i have very seldom.
Prices are quite reasonable and food quality is good.
Plain Roti, Dal Makhani, and pepsi  are the best for me....

The best vegetarian dhabba in the city of joy.The food is great. And needless to say, Balwant is heaven for tea lovers. 

The place is pocket friendly, and the service is quick. The only minus point being parking is a big difficulty.

Tea Nimki and Adda - the perfect combination for a nice evening at this place. To enjoy it just park your car in front of the dhaba, step out of it and enjoy it standing on the pavement. I have been frequenting this place a lot for the past many years bu the quality of tea and the taste has been degrading with time and thats why I no longer go here for the tea but at times just to eat.
Apart from this they have a decent veg dhaba menu with some of the favorites like Dal Makhini, Channa Masala, Palak Corn along with butter tandoori roti, naan.
There is Doodh Cola and Lassi too in the menu and it goes pretty well with the food..

Balwant Singh Eating House. How did I not review it all this time. Located very conveniently on Harish Mukherjee Road, I am a regular at this eatery. There are two sections at this place.

The food at balwant singh is always good, the standout being the Doodh Cola which has numerous takers. The Chai is absolutely mind refreshing. Can just go there for the Chai and the samosa. The other standout starter is the Paneer Tikka which I always end up having. Among the main course, the Tadka steals the show hands down. The Tandoori Roti is a delight. Did not enjoy the other veggies much apart from the Paneer Tikka Butter Masala. 

The fare here is all vegetarian and extremely pocket friendly which makes it even better. Its open till very late night for the late party goers and provides a good late night option coupled with paan from minto park. The service is quick here. Families have an option now for comfortable seating in the upper floor section. 

Balwant Singh is always a very good option with reasonable pricing coupled with good taste. 4 stars from me for Balwant Singh eating House.

I love tea. I have always had. And this place has the best Masala Chai hands down.
I visit this place several times a week for a cuppa of cha! It's sweet and milky and has kesar in it. Amazing! 
Another good try is the Aloo Paratha. Has Paneer shavings in it. Served with curd and spicy mango pickle. Kachori Sabji isn't so good. Try Sharma Tea stall (bang opp) instead.
Winter months have Sarso Saag Makki Roti. Again delicious. The Saag is cooked for several hours on slow simmer and leaves the side of the dish as it should.
Ambience consists of a non-air conditioned ground floor seating area, a bit fancy (and more expensive) first floor area and a place where you can park your car and summon the waiter. Come here at midnight and try the tandoori stuff. Marinated stuff cooked on hot coal. Yumm! The hygiene isn't very good and it's a bit crowded at all times of the day.
Service is slow and inefficient. Don't lose your cool and patience. The food is worth it. 
I give this place a 5. Visit if your taste buds like Masala Chai and Tandoori preparations.

I have been to this place several times, and as many a Calcuttan would affirm, you don't even need to go inside to enjoy this place. The North Indian food is good, no doubt, but what sets this place apart is the Doodh Cola. Yes, it's a real thing - milk with coke. The precise quantities used in preparing a jug of this drink gives it the exact same taste each time you visit Balwant's. Having doodh cola at 6 in the morning in earthen 'sikoras' is a feeling that can't be skipped. Must-go for every Calcuttan.

the legend about "milk cola" is not 100% true. well, it is a unique dish, i admit. but not exactly an "awesome" one. When cold milk is mixed with cola, it will taste like vanilla coke. The tea is superb though. I've tasted tea in lots of places(from cozy restaurants to footpath chaye), butvthis one is really good. samosa and other snacks are okay. service is fast. Mr.Singh himself is quite a nice man.

If there was one North Indian restaurant I would recommend in Calcutta, it would be Balwant Singh's Eating House. Yes it is a pure vegetarian restaurant, and yes I would still recommend it. This place not only makes delicious masala khulcha and malai kofta, but it also makes the extraordinary doodh-cola (literally, milk-cola) which, though an absurdity to hear of, is a treat to drink.

The new restaurant area is way cleaner and comely than the original place (which still exists, of course) and is an added incentive for those who were reluctant to check the place out because of it being considered somewhat "dirty".
Balwant Singh's opens quite early in the morning and makes some great breakfast items for those travelling from South Calcutta to Howrah station to catch an early morning train. Coupled with their great chai, this is THE dhaba for Calcutta.

I was a regular visitor of this place during my college days. It has excelent north Indian punjabi food. Try the special Kashmiri Aloodum and Paneer Butter Masala, Daal Tadka, Kofta etc. and they have awesome Masala Kulcha.
ONE THING THAT ALL SHOULD TRY IS THE MILK COLA OR MILK FANTA. ITS A SIN FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T TRIED IT.
NOW THE NEGATIVE POINTS....THE PLACE IS NOT HYGIENIC AND ALSO A BIT DOWN MARKET. I WOULD PERSONALLY NOT GO INSIDE WITH FAMILY RATHER THEY ALSO SERVE THE FOOD IN YOUR CAR IF YOU PARK OUTSIDE THEIR DHABA.THIS THING I ALWAYS DO WHEN IM WITH FAMILY OR GF.

And after our order arrived I did not miss the chicken/ mutton kebabs and other non veg tandoori items that are oh-so-favorite for majority of the Dhaba food lovers.

The food is really bad here. The naan was served cold and the daal had stones in it. The service is a relief as the server was very understanding and changed both the naan and daal as he saw the unease with which we ate.
