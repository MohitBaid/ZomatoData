This place is a 2 mins walk from Lake Mall, Rashbehari and serves authentic Chinese food at budget friendly prices.
‚òÜMushroom Prawn Soup: This was a mild soup with minimal amount of mushroom and prawn served.
‚òÜThe Combo (Veg, Chicken and Fish options- customisable) at Rs. 150/180/200 only.
‚ñ™Fried Wontons (4 pieces)
‚ñ™Fried Rice
‚ñ™Manchurian (other options like Chilli Chicken, Schezwan etc available too):
I really liked the taste of the rice and the manchurian was fresh, delicious and well prepared. The wontons were crispy and really light.
‚òÜPrawn in Oyster Sauce:
This was a good preparation and had the distinct flavour of oyster sauce.
Service was fine and pretty quick.
The ambience is more than I expected and the place is hygienic unlike many other places of this category.
I was disappointed though, that dumplings aren't available in anything other chicken options. It was a good experience altogether.

Yesterday evening went to this small restaurant on the way home. Wanted something not too heavy, so ordered a starter Korean Chicken. 
It came in 4 sticks with each stick having 3 pieces of fried boneless chicken, slices of tomato, capsicum, onions..all coated in a tasty and mildly spicy sauce. The chicken was extremely soft and crispy.
The service was very quick.
This seems to be a very good Chinese restaurant. Will be definitely visiting again to try the main courses.

Tucked away in a quite corner of the lake market road, we stopped here for a quick dinner before catching the 10:30 show at lake mall. We ordered Cantonese chowmein and roast pork and pork in Hunan sauce. The service was super quick. Our server, Mr Lama was very prompt and polite. The quantity was huge. We ordered 2 plates of chow n 4 of us couldn't finish it. The pork dishes were delicious. We left with a happy tummy and a happy wallet

A small Chinese food joint located near lake mall.. more precisely just beside charuchandra college.. max accommodation capacity is 12 to 15 people...
Mainly a takeaway joint.. had a quick lunch.. as we were in a hurry jumped onto the main course..
Tried their mixed rice and general taos chicken.. The quantity was huge and can be shared between two.. The quality was also good nothing extraordinary.. but yes it won't burn a hole in your pocket..

And yes they Don't charge any taxes.. so pay for what eat.. 
But personally I felt that the cost was little bit more..
240 for the chicken dish was a bit expensive keeping in mind it's not that typical Chinese restaurant..

I have visited this restaurant many a times and the best dish which I like here is the Roasted Chilli Pork. I have tried the Hoisin Pork too.The pork here is one of the best which I've had till date.Although the accommodation space isn't that much,this place provides top quality food and the quantity given is ample.You can even tell the staff your preferences about the orders you make and they will prepare the dish according to your preferences.I have even tried the Mongolian chicken which was also very tasty and well prepared. Overall it is a good restaurant and rates here are cheap too.

Visited this restaurant today for lunch around 1.30pm and the place was totally empty then.

Location: This place is located at a convenient location just beside Charuchandra College. If you are coming from Rashbihari you have to follow Kavi bharati lane beside lake mall and after 3 minutes walk the restaurant will be on the right side.

Ambiance: Very small dining area yet well arranged. Ambiance is very simple.  Decoration is nothing fancy. Capacity is 20 people at a time. They had AC dining area and they had maintained the cleanliness.

Foods: Our today's food Journey includes,
* Chicken Chilli Garlic Fried Rice
* Spicy Hoisin Chicken
Both the dish tasted yummy. They served authentic Chinese dishes. The fried rice had perfect flavor of garlic. Quantity was sufficient for two people. Chicken dish was something totally new for us and it tasted decent. The gravy was neither too spicy nor too bland. They served 8 pieces of Chicken and the pieces were soft enough to chew. Food quality is really mentionable.

Service: Service was very prompt. Within 10 to 15 minutes the dishes were served before us. Pocket pinch is reasonable. Menu displayed in zomato is all inclusive. No extra GST added on our bill. They accept cards and paytm wallet as well. 
Overall a very nice experience. I will surely recommend this place. Keep it up!üëç

Another truly unappreciated restaurant. Located just beside Lake Mall. It's a very small place with not much decor. We sat down we went to the menu and we ordered wonton soup, pork dimsum, roasted Chilli pork and Mongolian Pork. Every single of the item we ordered was mouth watering delicious. The soup spicy and flavour full and the wantons were cooked just right. The pork dimsum the coating was super thin and the filling was very flavorful. And the roasted Chilli pork and the Mongolian pork was not the best pork dishes I've ever had. Apart from the show service, this place is highly recommended.

We went there on a rainy day after shopping.It's located beside charuchandra college.small place with near about 15-20 seating arrangements.Inner decoration is pretty good and their staffs are also well behaved.
So we orderd 2 chicken combo meals.
Let me clear about the combo meals-
It contains- veg fried rice/veg noodles+chili chiken/chicken manchurian/hot garlic chicken+2pcs of chicken wontons.
So,we choose-fried rice+hot garlic chicken+wontons.
Let's talk about the food quality and quantity:
1combo meal=1 person(enough)
And,the taste is really good..specially i like their hot garlic chicken.Taste like some crispy chicken is starfried some hot garlic sauce..Taste is really different..
The chicken combo meal price is 180/- (incl.of all taxes)
Had a good experience. we wish we will visit "sili chillies" soon.

It was my second visit to this restaurant tucked in a lane adjacent to lake Mall and I must say the quality degraded.

This time we took chicken fried rice in XO sauce and spicy hoisin chicken.
Coming to the fried rice,it was full of onions.who gives so much of onions in rice? Totally ruined the taste 
3/5

The chicken was a bit better but again it doesn't justify its name.It wasn't at all spicy.
3.5/5
Ambience is good and relatively pocket friendly too with no extra tax added.

This is relatively a new restaurant beside Charuchandra College, little away from the congested main road. I went there on Shaptami along with 10 of my friends in the prime rush hours of afternoon. We had to wait there for half an hour, but it was worth waiting. The quality and quantity of food, given that it was during the peak rush hours of pujas, is something which must be appreciated. For all the anti-basa foodies ( though I am not one of them), they don't serve basa. Their service is commendable. The price was quite reasonable, which is something to be rejoiced by students like us. All the hungry faces left the restaurant with the smile of satisfaction after lunch.
But adding the most important thing, I could feel the excessive use of msg in their food. Even if they used it only during pujas, that is to be condemned. This is something the restaurant and the future customers of Silly Chillies must keep in mind.

A very good place to have a meal. The restaurant is a small one but the food,service and behavior of the staff was very good.. I went there with my girlfriend and we had a starter dish( can't remember the name) it was very good and a new flavour for us.. We also had egg fried rice which was sufficient in amount and good quality.. and also hoisin chicken which was the combination of right amount of spice and the chicken had a crunchy crispiness to it. And the ambience was also good. It's really a gem when it comes to talking about small restaurants in Kolkata.

This would qualify as a hidden gem for me as it is a relatively unknown food joint, but provides quality food for the price. Do try their Korean Chicken, Spicy Thai Fried Chicken and Silli Chilli Special Chicken Noodles, all three of which are quite unique and I have not tasted anything like them in my entire eating out experience in the city. However, the one thing they must improve on is their cavalier attitude to timings. I have had experiences, when I have arrived at the restaurant just after 3 pm, to find the shutters being pulled down. No one should have to experience this when the official timings state that they are open till 4pm. Except that, it‚Äôs a great addition to the city‚Äôs ever expanding foodscape and I hope they grow bigger and continue to put food on our plates without compromising on what makes them great ‚Äì the food.

I visited this restaurant a month or so back on a friend's recommendation, after watching a movie, with intense hunger pangs. 

I ordered a Non-Veg Rice Combo Meal that costs 180rs. It had Veg Fried Rice, 4pcs of Chilli Chicken, 3pcs of Fried Wantons and a condiment. The quantity served was commendable for the price. The quality, although nothing exceptional, was decent. 

The place might not be adventurous or experimental like many other eateries that are popping up in the vicinity but it upholds the basics of Chinese cuisine found in the budget restaurants of Kolkata. The huge plus points of this joint are their cordial service, although tad slow, and the welcoming atmosphere for anyone, especially college students on a budget, who would wanna hang out with their pals while enjoying wholesome food.

The Ambiance is also pretty good and staffs are also well behaved. The food is delicious and quantity is also pretty well according to the price. I must say the price is very reasonable. We took the Chicken schezwan hakka noodles with Vegetable balls in Hot Garlic sauce. Honestly, we didn't expect the food to be this good. This place is definitely worth a try on weekends.

This place is a hidden gem. We wanted to have pork wanton soup. Although it wasn't there in the menu, it was made on our request. The soup was perfect for a rainy evening. Next we ordered pork dimsum, Mongolian pork and roast chilli pork. The dimsum was served with kasundi, a combination I have never seen. The filling of the dimsum was coming out and the owner apologised for that. But it tasted great anyways. The roasted chilli pork could have been more spicy. The Mongolian pork was amazing. Never in my life I have tasted pork this scrumptious. Both food quality and quantity is mind blowing. The service was a bit slow though. I would love to go back and try the other items.

Chinese food as authentic as it gets. Tasty Chinese food where everything tastes different and is full of flavour. Large quantities and reasonable cost. For starters We order crispy baby corn and chicken pepper salt. For dinner we ordered veg sweet Hakka noodles and stuffed potatoes- the noodles were different thought I wouldn't like sweet but it was well done with just a hint of sweet after taste. The stuffed potatoes was something else so different and flavourful. For non veg we ordered Singapore crab claws and chilli Pork home style and Pork fried rice. The owner also served us prawn Sui mai on the house. The crabs were very tasty and chilli Pork was the best I have had in a long time. Believe it or not the bill for all the delicious food was only 1650/-.

We got a chance to try their amazing food at Cal Bunka, second edition. Their kiosk was quite prominent and stood out.
We tried their Meat Ball Soup - full of flavors yet so light. Nice, round meatballs. Just perfect and served hot!
Also, tried their Prawn and Chicken Sui Mai - this one was equally excellent!! I am happy to say that most big places fail to produce such quality, and these just outshine that. Such light coating, and full stuffing, served with a spicy sauce.¬†

There was another dish, I cannot remember the name, it was probably hiahin rice - a humble fried rice with boned meat cooked in a sauce. Very filling, and recommended!

This place is in the vicinity of Lake Mall (3-4mins walk). I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine. We were extremely hungry after watching a movie at Lake Mall, so decided to give this place a try!¬†

I was pretty amazed by this hidden gem! This place though small yet they managed to provide ample seating arrangement. The decor is simple and the waiters are extremely friendly. What caught my attention is this place's hygienic condition. It's really good! 
We ordered Rice Combo Meal comprising of Veg Fried Rice, Szechuan chicken (4pcs), 3 pcs fried wantons and a sweet dip. My friend took Veg noodles along with chilli chicken (4pcs) and fried wantons as usual. What is the best part about this meal is it's price. Such an ample quantity will just cost you ‚Çπ180. Isn't it amazing?! The food was delicious too!¬†

I have made up my mind, whenever I visit Lake Mall I will definitely give this place a visit!

This is my first blog about a Chinese restaurant so the selection was tough. Bengalis are no more stuck to Biryani and Mughlai Parota. Chinese cuisine is the comfort food now and therefore there are hundreds of chinese restaurants lining up, each trying their best to serve their version of ‚Äúauthentic chinese food‚Äù .But at the same time it is very important to carve out your own niche among the dishes because frankly most foodies are habituated to Chilli Chicken , Manchurian and other traditional ones.So the balance is very important and therefore you will see newer chinese restaurants serving the traditional dishes and adding also some of their own.

For starters, we ordered a Roast Chilli Pork and Fish in Chilli Mustard Sauce(The fish is a must try!) And for the main course, we ordered a Chicken XO rice(whose flavour was impeccable) and a Chicken in Hot Bean Sauce. I would highly recommend this eatery for its great food and unique taste!

This new kid on the block is one of those Chinese joints in the city that believes in quality, authenticity and affordability. Almost all the soups are in the price range of Rs. 100/-. The restaurant serves some excellent rice noodles (mei-foon), perhaps the best after Golden Joy of China Town. Canton noodles are truly authentic; chicken in plum sauce and chicken in hot bean sauce are two of their true signature dishes. The fried rice here is ‚Äújust different‚Äù and leaves a lingering mark on the palate hours after you have finished your meal. A visit by our three-member gang (two chicken lemon coriander soups, two chicken Cantonese noodles and one chicken in hot bean sauce) cost us something around Rs. 720.00! Unbelievable, yet true!! And a portion of the noodles had to be packed and taken away!!! Recent introductions include squid, pork and crab. A small, humble but air-conditioned place with simple d√©cor, this is definitely going to be every food-lover‚Äôs ‚Äòparadise‚Äô in the near future.

This place is located just beside charuchandra college in lake market area. I ordered for a combo meal ( lunch ) here. They have choice of noodles or fried rice along with side dishes , dimsums and soft drink in the lunch combo meal. The food was good and filling. The pocket pinch was quite reasonable too.

This restaurant was one of my favourite take away place as it is located nearby to my place. But recently I got the food which was very less in quantity and also it has degraded alot in its quality. Beside the food is also very much over priced for such poor quality and less in quantity food.i ordered both fish and chicken. Both of them were of very poor quality and very less in quantity for such over priced food. Earlier I only suggested many of my friends to get food from this place, but now I will suggest each and everyone of them to avoid this place. I am very much disheartened with their downgrade in food.

I ordered dinner from this place last night through Swiggy.Got a discount of 20%.The orders comprised of a Mixed Hakka Noodles and Hot garlic chicken.Packaging was well done.

‚Ä¢Mixed Hakka Noodles-It had adequate portion of meats and fresh prawns in it.Seasoning was spot on. Portion was huge..more than enough for two hungry adults.Could've cut down on the oiliness just a little bit.

‚Ä¢Hot garlic chicken-Perfect for people who love Indianised Chinese.8 pieces of chicken were given in one portion.Sizes were good.Chicken was soft and well cooked.The gravy had a good punch of spice with a hint of sweetness cutting through the heat.

Pocket pinch is quite reasonable.Going to order few more times and also visit the place for a dine-in experience.

We went there for dinner and found it a bit crowded. So we decided to take away! Food quality wise? It's decent enough for the price they offer.

Food we ordered:

Thai spicy chicken, chilli chicken & chicken fried rice.

We went for Chicken Fried Rice, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup, Garlic Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken. All the items were awesome.
Overall a great experience.

A nice place for Chinese food in the locality. Love the Prawn Pepper Salt. The Hoisin Chicken is delicious as well. The mains, that is the rice and the noodles are very basic. All the attention is drawn by the sides. A big thumbs up for that.

I was there in the eveningof 25th October to check out the place, seeing all the positive zomato reviews. Not very hungry,  we ordered chicken lung fung soup and a schezwan chicken cantonese noodle. The soup was not what we were expecting.  It did not have the layer of egg drop and even the chicken pieces were very hard to find.  However,  it had an abundance of tofu, so much so that we got confused whether they mixed up chicken with tofu.  The taste was okayish. Nothing to remember. 
Now coming to the noodle,  it was abundant in quantity but the cantonese noodle lacked any kind of gravy and thus it's purpose was lost.  All we could see was a bowl full of noodles and vegetables.  The texture of the chicken provided was also kinda sandy. Special mention must go to the amount of oil they use in the cantonese noodle. The food was too oily for any decent Chinese dish as Chinese food is considered to be one of the lighter cuisines. I'll attach a picture of my plate with all the oil which was left after I finished my noodle. Also the servers stand right in front of your face throughout your meal which is very uncomfortable. 
Conclusion: I'm probably never going back again.

Just beside Charu Chandra College is this really tiny eatery which serves decent food though the quantity is less compared to the prices. The room is small but carefully arranged and clean. We ordered a chicken hot and sour soup and fried chicken wantons and they were quite delicious. It's a better option than the lake mall food court at least! Hope to try their other dishes soon.

For the first time ever, delivery was before-time and hassle free even during Pujas, for which kudos! The food comes in large portions and the Chinese stuff we ordered is the classic Calcutta version - Indianised and spicy. Budget-friendly and therefore a value proposition.

After a day long pandal hopping we decided to end our day with some mouth watering Chinese delicacies. We were near deshopriyo so I thought of visiting this place and I gave them a call in advance to let them know that we were coming. We arrived there after their closing time but they didn't mind and took very good care of us.

This restaurant is just beside Charuchandra college, two minutes from lake mall.

It's a small but very well kept restaurant with only six tables.

I and Arbinda Kumar Nayak , with lots of help from our lovely host Mr. Melvin, decided to order. :-

Wonton Soup

Spring Chicken

Mixed Chilly Garlic Noodles

Mongolian Chicken

Mixed X.O Hakka Noodles

Spicy Lemon Chicken

Let's begin with the Soup. The wonton soup is a lightly seasoned clear soup with herbs, bok choy and wontons in it. I was very impressed with the Quality of the Soup, It served as a palate cleanser for me.

The Soup was followed by Spring Chicken. The spring Chicken was made from joint cuts of Chicken, deep fried in spicy batter and the Chicken was very tender and moist. It was served with a house made chilly sauce.

The Chilly Garlic Noodles was a feast for my taste buds with lots of prawns and chicken and tons of flavours. The Noodles was soft and springy.

The Mongolian Chicken is served in a brown gravy and has a unique flavour of its own. The gravy is neither thick nor runny.

The X.O Noodles are one of its kind with a variety of different spices.

And last but not least is the spicy Lemon Chicken. Its made with crispy fried chicken in hot and tangy base which will create a storm of flavour in your mouthand a tangy punch at the end.

A special thanks to Mr. Melvin, he is one of the best hosts that I have ever met. He was patient through our non stop bickering and had a never ending smile.

This is a small and cosy food joint near the happening Lake Mall. The first thing that impressed me was the liberal quantity of the Mixed Hakka Noddles that we ordered. Secondly, the Chicken Wings in Plum Sauce had a tasty outer coating but the inside could have been better where they was hardly any spice or sauce. The staff was courteous and attentive and altogether this place is a good option for college students with limited pocket money or even a quick bite that is easy on the pocket. The best thing is that they maintained the food quality in spite of it being the Puja season.

Located at lake market, just beside charuchandra college a small little eating joint(not calling this a restaurant).
It can seat 15 people max, it has got ac and decor is very minimal with hanging chimes, chinese printed walls. But the whole place was utmost neat, with well behaved and courteous servers.
We (three of us) had ordered crispy baby corn, veg haka noodles, veg schezwan noodles and kung pao chicken. Quantity was more than we expected and three of us cudn finish the two big bowls of noodles! Chicken was the show stealer, soft and perfectly flavored. They have tax all included in the menu, the whole meal costed us 600 bucks only.
This part is edited after my second visit to the place, the combo which they are serving is really value for money meal! When you are craving for chinese in lake market this is the place you should go. üòä

Liked the Wantons and Rice. Loved the Chicken in hot garlic sauce. The kimchi though was a bit stale for my liking. Overall a nice experience. Will definitely order again.

Located near charu chandra college this is a newly opened chinese restaurant. Hardly accomodating 25 people, minimalistic ambience this place surprisingly serves pretty decent chinese. Quantity is more than good enough. Tried their mixed mein foon and kung pao chicken. Most paces that I had kung pao chicken in, use cashew nuts but this place used peanuts instead. I prefer the one with cashew nuts though.

1. Superb taste (no smell of over used / burnt oil stain)
2. Great quantity (veg fried rice we ordered was sufficient for 3 pax of moderate appetite)
3. Super economic (it should be a crowd puller as there is a college beside) 
4. Nice clean minimalistic ambience 
5. Cordial stewards 

Suggestion: 
Should start accepting Cards / E-wallet !!! 

Wish Silli Chillies a great success & a successful run ...

Suddenly found this place while on a drive.. 
Had chicken wantons.. veg steamed momos, beg hakka noodles and fish in bean sauce
The wantons were really nice and crispy
The veg momo is something that i dont like so wouldnt judge !
The noodles was a very normal one . Nothing special about it
The fish was really soft and tasty
The best thing about the restaurant is its service. Very very courteous and warm.

Noticed the veg and non veg combo deals @100 and @150 respectively.
