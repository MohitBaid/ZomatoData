Gupta Brothers' for me is the 1st choice for my portion of Rabri in Kolkata and what the sell is not the typical Kolkata Rabri but the non-bong version of the same which is a northern delight. ¬†Their Rabri¬†is not having the chunk of Malai but is a curdled semi thick subtle sweet one. apart from the Rabri, their Boondi is worth having and so other sweets are ( Cashew Barfi, Dryfruit tart, Son Papdi, Imarti, Motichoor Laddu etc). They have a decent chaat counter with the typical options. As compared to the other confectioners shop the price is a bit on the higher side but matches perfectly with the quality.

One of the oldest legendary sweet shop in this area, i have been visiting since my school days. Some of their sweets are exceptional like the nimki, sohan papri and malai chomchom. Last but not the least i love the liitle pera type misti called 'gujia' - feel nostalgic on every bite of this special sweet.

I am on the sweet journey...being a bong what can be more energizing than chomping on our traditional sweets on offer...my destination today was the Gupta Brothers outlet near Gariahat which turned out to br quite good....

I really love the sweets served at Gupta Brothers. Mostly of the non-Bengali genre, the gulab jamuns have a different flavour altogether. The Abar Khabo too, is an absolute hit over here.

The food and sweets are brilliant. The papri chart, club kachori, puchka and tomato cheese dosa are my favourite. 
Although not much of a sweet person but love their gajar ka halwa (seasonal) and soan papdi.

This place is a tad overpriced. Though the food they serve is of great quality. I have had the chat over here which is very normal yet priced high unnecessarily. The mango shake over here though has impressed me a lot and I keep going back to the shop for it.

When you are shopping at gariahat,this place is ideal for grabbing a quick snack.After a day of heavy shopping we dropped in this place to grab a quick bite.Being entirely veg we ordered chola batora,plain dosa and masala dosa.The batoras were quite huge and quite tummy filling.The dosas were also quite good.

At this place, on being asked if anything is baked,  the man at the counter looked very offended. This is one of those old world halwai shop - believing in goodness of ghee, maida and chini, without giving a damn about cholesterol or diabetes or whatever fancy restrictions your dietician has put.

I made my way to this branch of gupta brothers confectionery only serving sweets  (having had chats and lassi all through school life from ekdalia road branch) after a decade. I had a petha and parceled sonpapri, labang latika, chandrapuli and laddu (one each). The petha was the best one, as sweet as it is meant to be, reminding me of pethas sold on trains around Agra. The rest were all disappointing - the sonpapri non fluffy, the laddo grainy, and the labang latika and chandrapuli pallete-numbingly sweet. Maa got a packet of fried jhal motor - which she tells me is as good as any other good quality stuff available in the market. 

Gupta brothers is an old place from childhood memories, and after my disappointment this time,  I can hope the memories will be redeemed with the next-door chat place which I am yet to revisit in recent times.

A hidden gem.

Well,not so hidden actually if you consider that it's been around for the last fifty years and I myself have seen this place from school,the famous South Point which was nearby.

Uniformed,polite,friendly servers.

Very high on hygiene count.

Adjoining Junior brothers,another iconic chaat place.

Butter Roll

Amirti¬†

Chom chom

Gujia

Petha ( perhaps the only place in South Kolkata to sell this )

Plus I got their speciality which looked like rasmalai but forgot the name.

All excellent in taste and freshness.

Maybe low on advertising and publicity but the very best that Kolkata has to offer in conventional ' Mishti '

Long live!!!!!!

an extension of the popular junior brothers situated just adjacent this place has some good sweets and namkeens...the jalebis and laddoos are decent enough
