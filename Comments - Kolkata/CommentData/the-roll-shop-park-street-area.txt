The rolls here are very okay. The paratha is thick and chewy while the chicken of kind was undercooked. Another thing I noticed that was they were cutting raw meat right where they make the rolls. 
Expected better rolls ! Prices are high too because of the location.

Crowded almost all the time, so you need to wait for your turn to taste the classy roll they serve in the hot and happening place of Park street.

A very small eatery. Tasted their egg rolls. Loved it. The staff are co-operative. They didn't even take much time to prepare. Overall satisfied.

A small road side roll shop in parkstreet. Good for a quick bite. As usual rolls nothing special. Remain crowded at evening time. No sitting arrangements is there. Tried egg chicken roll. Taste good. Fast service, and prices are pocket friendly.

It's a road side roll joint located at Park Street , which is quite famous for its tasty rolls.

Service is prompt.

Tried Chicken roll , which was less oily and had good stuffings and the paratha was nice too.

Pocket pinch is low.

Roll lovers - a must visit.

This outlet attracts a huge crowd in Park Street. I have come here a number of time and have tasted their Egg Roll, Chicken Roll and their best Egg Chicken Roll for Rs.48. They are experts in making rolls, paratha is fine and the roll taste is great.
Drop here at evening, an egg Chicken roll is enough to fill one hungry soul for an entire evening.

After I ordered chicken roll from here I noticed Kusum Roll shop is just few steps away which is famous. I thought I had to regret since the shop looks small and unnoticed by most street peddlers. 
But after the first huge fat bite it changed my view. It was good not too much of oil and the quantity of chicken was descent too. 
The one at the shop behaved well.
So not a bad option to try it once when your wallet runs short by its essence.
