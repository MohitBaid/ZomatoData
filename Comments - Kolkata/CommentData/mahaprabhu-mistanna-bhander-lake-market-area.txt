It is one of the oldest sweet shops in Lake market area. It is situated very near to Lake market on the back side of it. The shop is small and has got few offerings to serve their customers. The place is small and hygiene and ambiance is not very great. Sandesh: I had two sandesh here. They both had some sweet filling inside and tasted great. I personally enjoyed it.

This is a very old sweet ( mishti) shop in the Lake Market area. It holds its own with regard to the quality and taste of their sweets(mishti) amongst the other renowned sweet ( mishti) outlets in the area. BUT alas when it comes to hygiene and ambience it ranks way way below them. In fact it is quite shabby.( Don't know why they don't spruce up...they have the space).
The staff behaviour also is not too good, not too bothered. They specialise in traditional Bengali sweets and all their sweets are awesome in taste. They have quite a variety in sandesh etc. I specially love their gur sandesh which they make in large quantities the winter months. The priced too are reasonable.

A very old sweet shop in this area. Usual bengali sweets along with breakfast or evening snacks options are availble.
In winter they make some old school authentic Calcutta classic Nolen gur sweets which is popular here.
Nothing extra ordinary but an average outlet all together.

Love the Radhaballavi served with a not Aloor Dum but has flavours of it type of sabzi here. Also, the sweets are pretty good, especially the Sorbhaja and Nolen Gur sweets.

A old shop though renovated sometime ago... they make  nice traditional Bengali sweets even better than some big names in the city. The best are the nolen gur sweets mostly available in winter.

ordered for paneer cutlet . they took the order and then after few minutes told that they dont have this item . they can serve singara or radhaballavi. as it was an online order , i had to chge my order list and opted for singara. also ordered some rasgollas . now if i talk about the quality, it was absolutely poor. the samosas were cold although big in size bt was tasteless. cost is reasonable. the rasgollas r were average . bt my point is that , if u dont have some items in your shop then u must not show it available on the website.the quality can be improved by a huge margin

This is a very old joint and i have been here since school days. Well they have renovated the shop now but i still find the stuff equally tasty. They make awesoem rabri. Something i can die for. Apart from that the other sweets are too quite good.

Located in lake market just diagonally opposite to lake mall, this small 'mishti' shop is not so ritzy like most of the Bengali sweet shops, it is shabby and having a broken appearance. But one should try their products     the sandesh, rosogulla, rabri everything is just mind blowing. Even the singhara which they prepare in the evening is worth tasting. These shop is one of the finest example of hand prepared Bengali sweets.

This decade old sweet shop is located in lake market area, nearby the lake mall and opposite "Charuchandra College". It has been in business since ages. I have been visiting these joint since I was a child. And till date I never miss out the opportunity to drop by these outlet whenever I visit lake market. Though there are a lot of renowned sweet shops located in the nearby vicinity like- Sen Mahasaya, Girish Chandra Dey and newly opened outlet of Kamdhenu's etc; but nothing altered the amount of footfalls in this joint and to its popularity. Being an age old joint, this outlet doesn't have any worth mentionable decor, having quite a shabby look. But when it comes to the variety and quality of their offerings, it has maintained its standard since its inception. They specializes in traditional Bengali sweets and presents them with its authentic taste completely preserved and unaltered. As we know, our festivities and celebrations continues through out the year and celebrating them without sweets is not compatible with our culture. Hence their offerings are inseperable part of our life and culture. Be it the light yet sumptuous chena sweets and sandesh(narampak), sweet curd(Misti doi) during the summer days; then notun gur(jaggery) sweets, sandesh, pithe, patishapta(Bengali pancake), malpoa, gur ras malai, dudh puli etc; during the winter days; and the succumbing offerings like rasogolla, sharbhaja, malai roll, chitrakut, pantua,etc; which are available all around the year are completely delectable.
Hence it is one of the best place in south Kolkata to relish traditional Bengali sweets oozing with authentic flavor in its best texture and reasonable price. So if you have a weakness towards sweets and loves pampering your tastebuds with mouthwatering Bengal wonders, you should definitely drop by this place.
