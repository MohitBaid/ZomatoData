Sadly Zomato didn't have any rating worse than this. Coming here was a huge huge mistake. This was the shadiest place I have ever been to. It looked like a place straight from the crime movies. I came here with my mashi who said 'this was the place where Kathleen had a restaurant and beautiful girls used to sing to the demands of the guests'. This place is located on the road connecting Park Street and Esplanade. There were two floors and since, we had gone early, we were asked to sit in the ground floor. The singing grips were not ready yet. Unmindful of the nature of the place, we settled in and ordered Chicken Noodles, Dal makhani and Tandoori Roti's. We were quite fascinated when we were served water in whiskey glasses.The prices were sky-high. Coming to the taste, the Noodles were simply bad, though the Dal Makhani was a tiny bit better. After we paid the bill, we asked for the restroom and were directed upstairs. The first floor was a full fledged bar. The place was very dimly lit. I could see two men exchanging bundles of money. When we entered the restroom, we found that it was more of a make-up room for the singing ladies. It was a cramped up place. Cigarette smoke was swirling around making the place all the more suffocating. Scantily clad ladies were lounging around with cigarettes in hand. We quickly came out. Outside we could see now a lady singing and gyrating her hips obscenely to the music. We exited as fast as we can promising ourselves never to go back.

Though having a lovely and soothing ambience this place is not cheap at all.
The value for money here is below par. But its not the quality its the quantity. Expensive for small portions of food.

Okay, I've never been to a place that can be so bad! Tired from work load, and extreme hunger made me and my friends to enter this restaurant. The moment I laid my eyes on the restaurant inside, where we were served water in whiskey glasses, I understood I'm in for something horrible! The table cloths were torn, scrapes of paint coming out, and the sponge placed on top of bar counter was literally ripped off! We ordered fried rice, mutton biryani and Manchurian. Despite making it clear that we want spicy items, we got all plain items with no spice what so ever. For all this, they charge like crazy! 
Please do not try this restaurant, with the hole that you'll be burning in your pocket you can easily visit some other restaurants much nicer than this!

An unexpected visit with friends. The food was too expensive. Quantity was not at all sufficient compared to the prices. Atmosphere was smoothing and comfortable.

This age old restaurant is located just beside kathleen towards mirza galib street. A lot of precious childhood memories are connected with these place. I was first taken to this joint by my father and after that i have been to this place over a dozen times with him. As a child don't know why but this restaurant and its decor used to appeal a lot to me. It has very classic and grand vintage type of decor. The false ceiling of this joint is indeed a class apart. The glass engavings on the walls, the lights everything had a palacious statement. The armoured statue at the entrance those sqeaky clean marble flooring everything brings my childhood days in front of my eyes. They had two level sitting arrangement both on ground and first floor. They specialises on north indian cuisines. The naan, tandoori roti, kulchas were fabulous. The gravy items like mutton keema matar, korma, butter chicken makes you lick your every finger in literal sense. This restaurant was really a "Princess". After my father passed away i stopped visiting this restaurant so i don't have much idea about the present state of it. Everything i described and mentioned is according to my past experience. But i visit again in the near future hopefully i will find it in the same state and condition.

this place brings in a lot of memory.. this review and rating is just based on those memories. Had visited the place around 5 years back. The place is located next to the Kathleen outlet in free school street area. We always tried out the Chinese stuffs. My favorite was Veg gravy noodles along with veg Manchurian and chilly chicken.. Around that time the food quality as well as the quantity was pretty good ..  yet to try it recently for an updated review....
