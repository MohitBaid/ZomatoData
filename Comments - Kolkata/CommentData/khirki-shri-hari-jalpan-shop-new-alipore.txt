Regular at khirki. Love their papri chat, soda shikanji, bhel puri, mandal thumbs up and aloo dum. They also keep ice cream soda. A papri chat for dinner is sufficient for one. 

They increase their price annually but they can improve on their sweet chutney.

Want to Eat Chaat in New Alipore? This is the only Place to be.

Must Have :-
Aloo Dum ( One Of The Best )
Bhel Puri ( Top 5 in Kolkata )
Papri Chaat ( Pretty Decent )
Masala Thumps ( Can Be Tried )

Cons :-
Felt a bit Overpriced against the Quantity served.

Can be tried Once for Sure.

Located in new alipore , this place remains crowded no Matter what . It serves veg food items which are on huge demand by the residents there . Tried their papri chat and bhelpuri , each costs rs 55 which I felt abit overpriced against the quantity they serve . They taste really good but somehow , I got bit cramps because of the chutney and dhokla duo .

In New Alipore? Want a quick bite? This is the perfect place.
Aloo dum is must have ‚úì
Papri chaat is also awesome ( though I am not very fond of the dhokla on it)
Masala thumps can also be tried here.


This is a perfect place to go to in the evening with family or friends :)

Tried their papri chat, soda sikanji, alu dam.
Also tried fuchka, alu dam fuchka from their lake kalibari outlet.

Would have given a 4 star rating if seating was available. Located on one of the lane of New alipore near dominos pizza. Better to take the help of google maps. Tried their papri chaat and soda sikanji. The soda sikanji's lemonade flavour was really nice. Chaat was also tasty and spicy, the chutney was a bonus in the chaat. A pocket friendly affair too.

Kolkata is famous for its chat and street food, and Khirki is one of the reasons why. This outlet is decades old and has forever been dishing out delicious bhel, batata, dum aloos etc. The quantity is also pretty good and worth the price. Definitely give this place a visit.

Wanted to have a Bhel Puri of lake Kali Bari but at the same time was interested in trying something new . So we landed up at Khirki.Was thrilled to see the concept that a proper window shaped shop is serving all street food deligently. Ordered a less spicy Bhel . First the good pints 1) better than the rest street Thela walas 2 ) portion size is filling 
bad points 1 ) no uniqueness in taste that will drag me again over there 2) the puffed rice is too thinner ; one should feel the crunch while munching it .

I've literally grown up eating Bhel, Paapri and their Aloo dum and absolutely love it! Not only have I seen their phenomenal growth in popularity (it's quite a landmark in the confusing lanes of New Alipore) I've also seen their prices increase multi fold over time. In terms of the food and hygiene, one cannot expect anything better than what they offer! The bhel puri has to be the highlight of ones visit couples with their soda shikanji!!

We are an old customer of khirki since last 10 years...but today it was pathetic...the behaviour of the staff was intolerable..we took aloo dum but it was totally oily so we didn't had it. When we were paying him he asked for the aloo dum also. N then the staff n we had an argument. At the end we paid him without going for a further argument...but we were very much disappointed

The problem with Kolkata street-food is hygiene. Those who manage the clean-act don't get the taste. Khidki is a hole in the wall outlet managed by a family. Gives the authentic street taste but in a relatively clean environment. Worth a try if you love the real stuff yet care for your stomach too.

As the name "khirki"  suggests, its a small shop situated in New Alipore in Kolkata in a not so crowded place. 
It was the first time I had masala thumbs up anywhere, and trust me it tasted better than tha original one. Also the bhel had that original Kolkata flavour and fragrance in it, which I just loved. And papri chat was also good. But I didn't like the rose soda. Also I just wished there was some place to sit. And there should have been more options to choose from.
Try the "chana chor garam" that a person sells outside this shop. 
Overall it was a good experience, try it when you are not feeling like eating a lot.

Just as the name "khirki" suggests, it is a small shop as narrow and small as a window in literal sense but has won the heart of new alipore's people. It is located in the "G" block nearby of my friend's apartment. She was the one who introduced me to khirki and since then whenever i had cravings for chaats and bhelpuri this was where i drop by. I am a regular to this outlet and it is utterly impossible to find this joint without being cluttered and surrounded by people with the temptation of savoring the tantalizing delights coming out from the window of khirki. Be it papri chaat, alu dam, sev batata puri, bhel puri etc; everything has a significant blend and distinctive flavor that just hypnotizes your pallete. Sipping the chilled "soda sikanji" or "masala thumpsup" during the sultry evenings of summer is inevitable from this joint. Khirki shri haji jalpan shop is a treasure trove and a glorious feather to New Alipore's crown.

This is a small place with a large sale:)
Well it is named as khirki since it serves from a window like place.so its a different way.
It is in lane beside gokul in new alipore. Has loads of space for car parking. As generally people going for walks and drives hit this place. Its quite popular for its bhel.
I have had its bhel, papdi chaat , allo dum, soda sikanji.. Infinite times. As tuitions are also nearby. It really fills our hunger pangs with a sumptuous amount of content .one entire bhel or any of the item is sufficient for a person who has skipped a meal or planning to.:P i love that the onions are very thinly sliced as it adds an amazing feel while having the bhel. It has a quick service. And priced appropriately . so do visit with friends or takeaway:):)

Best place for the chaat lovers.. :)
Everything is tasty and hygienic. Service is prompt. Soda shikanji is very good. Alu dum is nice n spicy.
There has been price hike but nevertheless the chaatpata chaat rules that out.

Location: New Alipore, few minutes away from Gupta Brothers. 

This place is a more like a small eatery where you're served the best chats in town. 

Considering it to be a chat centre, no seating availability is absolutely fine. 
This name is coz' of a simple reason - you're served through a big window. 

Coming to the point, 
Serves awesome Batata Puris, Bhel Muris, Aloo dum and definitely the sodas compliment your chat well. 

Everything is made to choice! 
Quick service! 

The sikanji is at times sweet, masala thumbs up is great and a few more coolers are on offer (yet to try).

Hygiene level is maintained. 

Prices used to be pocket-friendly but, have in this year (2014) taken a jump towards the high. Feels a bit over priced though. But, with the constant quality they serve, I wouldn't mind paying a bit more. :)

Overall a great experience. :-)
A must try for all chat lovers!

A favourite place for people living in and around new alipore, this place serves yummy chats and thirst quenchers. Though they have a limited menu with only bhel, batata and aloo dum along with various shikanjis and colas all are yummm. Since seating space isnt available, Visitors can park their car outside and the waiters are ever ready to help you. A must visit for a street food lover.

Yesterday i drove with a friend to khirki.My friend has tried chaats from russell street and vardaan market and i know i had to take him there to complete his chaat journey.
Khirki for me is synonomous to their batata papri chat.How to they manage to serve a plate full of lip smacking flavours and not use any masala at all ?Yes thats the most striking thing about that plate of wonderful chaat.Apart from papri,potatoes,chutneys(imli and green spicy)onions and the batata/ ragra there are no visible spices!No jeera,no chilli powder no chaat masala,yet from the first bite to the last, it tastes so so wonderful.We also ordered for rose soda and masala thumsup which was okay.Oh, let me not forget to mention their aloo dum? It is prepared much more hygenically than it is in different stalls in lake kali baari and they taste so goood,spicy yet not burning the mouth.

This place serves only 3 types of chaats and no its not a stall, it is a small shop which you will definitely not miss because it is usually crowded with people coming in to taste items from  their limited yet amazing menu :)

Khirki is located in the bye lanes of Block G of new alipore at a very convenient location beside the leaf strewed streets. Earlier there weren't too many cars running there which gave it a very quiet surrounding but it is not so quiet anymore. Still, being in your car or on your legs, a great place for a chaat lover to stop by and eat his heart out along with some soda shikanjis or masala cokes.

I dont know when the place originated but has been there since my childhood. There are a lot of options but the ones that sell like frenzy here are the bhel and papri chaat. I love the bombay bhel which is very good alongwith a glass of masala sprite. Overall from the taste point of view i would prefer lake road chaatwalas but the overall environment at khirki is more peaceful.

Khirki is one of the best fast food centre in new alipore. The quality of the bhel and papri anywhere in Kolkata has no match to khirki. 
For a budget of ‚Çπ 70 a person can eat and drink to his/ her hearts content.

Khirki gets its name because your actually served through the Khirki (window) .... its been around forever and serves excellen bhel and papri chat which I love. Crunchy ingredients and tangy chutneys make for a great combo and I like to go after office and have a bite on and off .... the masala thumbs up is super as is the kalla khatta ..... there is a channa and mixture wala who hangs around there as well who I patronise and he serves great stuff too.... chaat lovers am sure most of you have tried it but if you havent make plans to drop by quickly.

Khirki located in New Alipore is a favourite within our group of friends. Its a very peaceful place where this place is. The Bhelpuri and Batata Puri is amazingly yummy. The chutney that they use does the trick for them. The helping is quite good too which makes it enough for two people(1 item per person is enough). The Alu Dum is very ordinary and I am not a big fan of it. There is Soda Shikanji and Masala Thumbs Up to round off the chats.

The service is good and the pricing is reasonable. The tastes are genuinely good for the two main items I mentioned. Parking is not a problem here. I am a regular at this place for years now. 3.5 stars for Khirki.
