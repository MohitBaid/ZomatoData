If I would have known that this restaurant is a unit of Haveli... I would have never been here. My bad that I tried dinner. We ordered tomato shorba which has nothing to say good about it. We got that replaced with cream soups of tomato which was ok. 
In main course we ordered hariyali dal and we received black dal which again got replaced. Very disappointed with the service.
