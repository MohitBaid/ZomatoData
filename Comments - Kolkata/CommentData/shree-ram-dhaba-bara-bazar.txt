Shabby place yet serves great veggie food.
I had tried a lot on their menu in the past...
You get a taste of true North Indian roadside dhaba walaa flavours and demeanour.
Very pocket friendly and must go if you live nearby.

This veg eatery is located opposite to Himalaya Hotel in M.G road and mainly serves North Indian dishes.

Shabby ambience.

Sitting arrangements is there.

Always busy and there is rush , still service is nice.

Tried  Butter Naan &  Shahi paneer. Naan was soft and shahi Paneer was tasty and  well cooked.

Pocket pinch is reasonable with good quantity.

This is a small outlet selling good foods, No ambiance, No decore, only visit if you like simple food in a basic dhaba style.
I had preferred its Paneer butter masala, Mix vegetables with Tawa chapati and kheer for dinner. All are basic and simple food with reasonable pricing with good portion, but they charge for three slices of onions. 
Try their food if you like plane dhaba style food.

Location : on M.G.Road, just opposite to Himalaya hotel.

Decor : Nothing great

Service : Prompt

Food ordered : 
Butter Paneer Masala
Kali Dal
Chana Masala
Fulka
Masala Onion

Description : Had heard a lot about this place. But I believe in trying it to believe it. So went to this place on a weekday afternoon. Luckily got table immediately. After I sat, saw a big line waiting to come in. We ordered above items. All the items tasted amazing. If you are looking for a good north Indian food in dhaba style, this is the place. Masala Onion with food is a must. 
Highly recommended.
