This is a small kiosk just located opposite to city Mart, gariahat. But don't judge the food by the exterior. Their signature dishes are awesome in taste and finally got the opportunity to taste their awesome fish fry and chicken fry. The chicken fry was not that hot but nonetheless tasted good with their home made very much pungent kasundi and onion slices. The fish fry was very hot and filling, the perfect balance of soft , tender, juicy as well as crispy and crunchy. Definitely recommended and price was moderate along with the taste. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

One of the best shops for fries. I have tried most of the dishes however my favourite will always be fish batter fry. Fantastic preparation and I didn't forget to pack one for my home.

I have visited this place a few times, and tasted all their foods. And every item is very very good. Among all the dishes my favourites are the CHICKEN CHEESE and the FISH BATTER FRY. Nothing more to say, but this is a must try "televajar dokan" for all food lovers.

It used to be my favourite snacking haunt years back when I had my office in the area. The shop is known for large-sized fries and cutlets at pocket-friendly prices. The aroma of their freshly fried food is inviting.

My favourites include fish fry, chicken cutlet and fish pakora. On my recent visit, I tried the fish batter fry and liked it hot. I had the extra large chicken cutlet too and found that the quality has been retained to a reasonable extent. Each cost Rs 60. They serve mustard sauce and chopped onion alongside generously (not salad with more of cucumber like many places). The mustard sauce is claimed to be in-house and its heat packs a mean punch! I've never come across anything similar elsewhere.

The only downside is that they use basa in fish preparations and there's not a higher priced version with beckti for those willing to pay for it, like some places do. So, you are advised to have them hot in order to enjoy the taste.

If you love fish fry or chicken fry you should head towards Sankar's Fry. The congestion in front of the shop is enough to make you understand how popular this shop is. This place is right beside Citi Style. Had packed for myself fish fry. The fish fry was beautiful and there was perfect balance of flavours. I loved it. Will try their chicken cheese fry as well.

This small cabin is located in Triangular Park, opposite Citi Style and right beside Abindra (a shop for sarees) As the phrase goes, never judge a book by its cover, this place may seem small and unattractive from the outside, but the food here is amazing. This is mainly a corner where you will get different type of fries. We tried the chicken and fish fries as well as cheese chicken. The price is extremely reasonable. However there is not place to sit and eat. This place is definitely recommended if you are near triangular park and want a quick bite.
