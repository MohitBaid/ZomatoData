I really wish if I could give zero rating for the food quality. Yesterday we have order chicken tedgi kabab but chicken was spoiled and to cover the bad smell ,they used lot of masalas. We can only manage to take one bite of it then we have to throw the food to dustbin. I am really dissappointed how can one deliver such kind of spoiled food just to earn some money. Disgraceful

I would have rated it as 0 but unfortunately the option is not available. Had placed an order today at 8:40pm for 4 plates of momo for home delivery. The bill amount was paid online. 2 mins later received a confirmation that the resturant has accepted the order and will be delivered within 70mins. Next around 9:20pm received a confirmation from resturant that the order is on its way. Around 9:45pm Zomato contacted asking if I have received the order. They followed up with the resturant and at 10:40pm informed me that the resturant confirmed that the food was on its way and will reach within 10-15 mins. Even at 11pm when I didn't receive it informed Zomato again and they went ahead checked with the resturant and cancelled the order ay 11:07pm. This question is to the resturant MANAGEMENT.. DOES IT TAKE 2-3 HOURS TO CANCEL AN ORDER???? IF YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THEN WHY ACCEPT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE??? THE PHONE NUMBER WAS AVAILABLE THEN WHY WASN'T I INFORMED THAT YOU WILL BE LATR OR RATHER WON'T BE ABALE TO DELIVER AT ALL???? WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN ANSWER...

I ordered 1 boneless chicken kadhai, and one prawn 65 the kadbai chicken was with bone, and online manu says prawn 65 will contain 6 pieces though I received only 4. please check the attached pics for the same. As I called them to complain, then says ZOMATO made the mistakes. You can't believe what they shows. As cold excuse. very bad services. 

ZOMATO got back to me, and confirmed that, it was their system error. It is now Rectified. I appreciate the same. changing the ratings. now it is all based on food quality

Ordered food through Zomato at around 10 PM. They sent us the leftovers, some half cooked and some burnt breads. Kadhai Paneer was not really Kadhai Paneer. It was big chunks of paneer mixed with some other gravy topped with raw capsicum and tomatoes, and a lot of cardamom seeds. The restaurant called us after we complained, but had no answer apart from 'next time it will be good', and disconnected without listening to me. Had to go out for dinner. Money as well as the food was wasted. Pathetic food quality and disgusting service. Best to avoid, unless you're dying of hunger.

Well Garia is no more the street food area . New places, new innovations and great food is making some great name in this place .
Not just plain taste and quantity , its the quality ,the presentation , the slick display of artistic food serving is what gets us moving .
THE SAFFRON is definitely one such place to visit .
Wonderful neat classic presentation that just drives me crazy .
Mouthwatering delicacies , use of cheese in some brilliant ways for topping and spicy chicken items is my favourite .
Try out and enjoy some good food at Saffron .

This is a small restaurant in Garia and I went there to try out their Chinese cuisine. Though a small joint, the place has a decent ambience and service is also quite good.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I've tried Drums of Heaven, Chilli Chicken, Schezwan Fried rice and Chicken Hakka noodles. The quantity was quite good and so was the quality. But I must say that the Drums of Heaven deserve a special mention.

FINAL VERDICT- Apart from the Drums of Heaven, none of the dishes were anything out of the ordinary but yes, I would be willing to visit this place again for the Drums and would also recommend it to all!

Ordered paneer butter Masala & garlic naan..paneer butter Masala was good provided with small cubes of many paneer which I didn't like rather they can give 4 or 6 pieces of good sized cubes, gravy I liked it was smooth thick perfect blend of all spices , oil level was proportionate. Naan was not great as it was very thin like parathas which it should not be. Best wishesüëç

I have been ordering food from this place quite often. I stay in Garia and this food joint is really convenient for me. I haven't been to this place but the food I ordered was really good and the quantity is wholesome. I generally order Chinese food from here and surprisingly it always fulfilled my sudden cravings for food. The delivery was on time. The staff is very nice and well attended. I'd love to visit this place.

The location of Saffron is difficult to spot, situated in a narrow lane of Baishnabghata. 
The interior of the restaurant has been tastefully decorated but shortage of space is evident. We had ordered for chicken tandoori, achari murg, dal host, chicken keema and a bread basket. Though the serving time has to improve but the food was worth the wait. Tandoori and Dal Gosht would find a special mention. Haven't had such juicy Tandoori for years. 

Saffron is a welcome addition to the restaurants in Garia and Patuli region and helps us located in those parts to avoid the travel in search of good food. Pls keep up the good work !!!

The fish finger was the only nice dish among all the dishes we had ordered.This restaurant is new with very little space for seating.We had ordered babycorn with Vegetables as side dish,peas polau and chicken butter masala... the babycorn was like Vegetable stew with very little spices.It was a very big disappointment visiting this place.I hope they do better in future.

A nice restaurant to go for a lunch or evening snacks or dinner. Went here today with one of my close friends for an evening chit-chat session after a long time over some snacks. Ordered their chicken sweet corn soup and drums of heaven. Both the dishes were really good. Service was fast and the staff was really helpful.

The Saffron is a small restaurant on one of the many by lanes connecting the Garia 45 bus stand to the Tollygunj to Garia flank of the N.S.C. Bose road. With a very limited seating capacity, this place hosts a considerably large variety of cuisines. I liked the menu board mounted on a tripod outside the restaurant, the sort you would find in most eateries in Europe.
The food was absolutely top notch. I personally liked the 8 to 8 sauce. However I did not like the portions. The chicken dishes had 10 pieces, but the pieces were way too small. You would savour the taste for a fraction of a second and then it's gone. 
I would visit this place again to taste the Indian offerings. I hope they improve on the quantity part.

Accidentally discovered this little (no kidding, really is little) family friendly joint back around 2014, nothing fancy upfront.. one may even feel like a little awkward at the first time! but the thing is, one you are beyond the initial dilemma of "to be or not to be" in, they will welcome you with warmth that you'd never expect. food is decent, some hits the mark while others misses, but at the end of the meal, you'll probably come out with a satisfied tummy and a happy feeling. They delivered on time on a stormy night with a big smile on! I'd happily recommend this to anyone. üòä

Located in a prime residential area this food joint is a nice place to be atleast once or twice.. The preparation is good and its neat, clean and hygienic. Its one of those very few restaurants in southern most fringes of the city where a veggie like me would find awesome vegetable biryani in just one go. The menu is pocket friendly and this place is best known for home delivery services.
