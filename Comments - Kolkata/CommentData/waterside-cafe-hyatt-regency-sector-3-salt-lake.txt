Hyatt regency is a name that needs no introduction.Known all the over the world for it's sumptuous food,sophisticated ambiance and overwhelming hospitality,this place always stands true to the expectations.

So ,i visited their Waterside cafe some days back and i must admit i was more than satisfied with the food and service.As i entered this luxurious place,i was captivated and was left spell bound.The exquisite surrounding and intricate details is worth mentioning.

The waterside cafe is located on the ground floor of Hyatt regency.As i stepped in ,i was warmly welcomed by the graceful host.All the tables were lit with candles and that gave a very soothing feel to the ambiance.The plush and comfortable and swanky decor was soulful.

Coming to the exceptional food that we were served-

1.Non -veg salads-3,comprising of fish ,chicken and egg salad

2.Veg salads-3

3.1 veg starter-Chilli pepper mushroom

4.1 non veg starter

5.Veg and non veg soup

6.4 non veg main course consisting of lamb,chicken biryani,fish and bacon.

7.9 veg main course consisting of mushroom,cottage cheese etc

8.Live pizza counter(veg)

9.Live pasta counter- You can choose either penne pasta or spaghetti in white or red sauce.

10.Live waffle and churros counter

11.9 western dessert

12.3 Indian dessert

Each item was a treat to the eyes and taste buds as well.From the exceptional and courteous service of the staff to the opulent decor to the delectable food everything was to the point.

This is a good place . The food is good and a nice place to enjoy drinks . But only thing i did not like was . That the waiter was wearing slippers and was shabbily dressed . We visited this place around 2am . This is not accepted in a hotel like hyatt . Everything else was awesome üëçüèª

Great ambience 
Good food

Waffles are a treat 
Sometimes Biryani s available and mutton curry 
Staffs are pretty courteous 
Must say the location of this hotel steals the show

Other than ambience nothing was great, especially not the food. After JW Marriott we had huge expectations from Hyatt but it was disastrous. Buffet menu was restricted to 15 items from starters to desserts . If you don't have pork and mutton you will be left with much less choice. Thus we had to switch to ala carte. We ordered a fried rice and grilled chicken. It was so poorly cooked that we couldn't finish even a half of it. I won't recommend it to anyone.

I had visited this place a few months back and i was so wrong to have high expectations from this place.The Buffet spread had a small menu with only one or two starters and on the day which i visited this place, they had a preparation of pork instead of beef which was pure rubbish.I fail to understand on what basis had they set prices for their buffet spread. There is a live counter where you can order pizzas and pastas and the pizza which we ordered tasted very good.Main course was sub-par and i did not expect food to be that bad here.Desserts tasted good.All in all this restaurant has a good ambience, courteous staff but sub-par food, not worth its price.

The food isn't as good as you'd expect 
I had gone there on a Sunday and chose to eat the buffet 
( Sunday is the day restaurants usually put up their most lavish spread of dishes)

The choice of dishes that they provided was quiet limited if you compare it to restaurants at similar price points,

I decided to order the pizza from the live counter, which was horrendous, it was literally one of the worst pizza's ever, it did have a good thin crust that was crispy but the sauce lacked any flavor or seasoning and it seemed that the chef had decided to sell some canned tomatoes and processed cheese over some dough as some really snobish pizza.

The Indian food was good but again the choice was really limited. 

When you eat Indian main course, the choice of bread usually has a huge role to play. So I decided to order onion kulchas from the long list the server for my table
 just told me, as I ordered for them a frown registered on my server's face and she told me that the kitchen usually takes 35mins+ to prepare it and I should refrain from ordering that if I don't want to sit in the restaurant all night.  

You know something is really wrong with a restaurant and the way it is run when the staff itself tells you not to order something.

The food and service is not at all worth the money spent, one can get far more better food and service at half the price at many other restaurants.

I went with my family for the buffet dinner. The spread was good with choices from Indian to Oriental and everything tasted really good. Only thing was that the food had gone cold for some of the items on the buffet and the service was a bit slow. 
Special mention: The strawberry cheesecake was amazing.

After buffets at Itc, hhi, Marriott, maybe it was my fault that I had high expectations from hyatt. The buffet, on a friday was absolutely disastrous. For starters they just had chicken kebab and pizza. The main course had 5-6 items . NONE of the Items, except for the fish amritsari and beef curry were good to taste. All the items at the dessert counter sucked equally aswell.I felt like i shouldve burned the money instead of paying them for food that shitty.
I am not saying they should have a spread as huge as marriott but atleast as large as hhi considering hhi charges less and serves far far better food. Maybe Marriott buffet ,isn't the best tastewise but the number of items is remarkable. Hhi serves perfectly according to what they charge and itc concentrates both of quantity and quality equally. Hyatt failed at everything except service and ambience.

A birthday outing at a 5 star restaurant is always special. The staff was very friendly and helpful, food was not up to the mark of 5 star standards the beef was not cooked properly and was tough and cold, mushroom salad smelled bad ( maybe I‚Äôm not a fan of mushroom) but the desserts were top class.

Ambience:  High french Windows, charming interiors, Well maintained Greens & the aqua pool makes the vibe Formal and very peaceful.
Food: The starters were okay.We had chicken/corn/fish/egg/pasta cold salads.There were Samosa chat and Dahi Vadas too.
The pizza was really tasty!
The main course had a lavish spread ranging from tofu , tenderloin,chicken stew to schezuan curry!
The chicken biriyani was mildly spiced and beautifully scented.
The dessert section was a treat to the eyes, from freshly made waffles, caramel tart, strawberry cheesecake, mango cake,brownies,chocolate mousse to Indian favourites like mishti doi,gajar ka halwa,kheer, nolen gurh er sondesh!
They looked as pretty as they tasted!
The staff were very friendly and courteous and our Saturday brunch lasted perfect!

An utter disappointment for us, specially on a Saturday Night. 

Hyatt Water Side Cafe. A much talked about place in Kolkata. The ambience, the decoration, everything may make it look like a 5Star place, but the service and food may make you think twice where you are. Whenever you are visiting such kind of places, the things that come in mind are the:
1. Warm Welcome
2. Proper Behaviour and guidance 
3. And most importantly the food (for which you are spending your time there)

None was upto the mark. 

The buffet menu looked like a marriage reception menu. Even in marriage receptions you‚Äôll find more options than here. Never expected this. We switched to Ala Carte. 
1. Fish and Chips: No at all impressive. 
2. Beef Steak: Never seen such a rough meat and tough to eat thing. My friend was literally struggling to curve out the thing. 
3. Pizza: Nothing special. 
4. Blue berry cheese cake : Blue berry jam was spreaded out on the top of the cheese cake. Who does that. 

We had to call them everytime for the menu, ordering the food, for water, for bills.. 

Really disappointing. 

Dear Waterside Cafe, please try to learn some thing from JW Kitchen.

A much waited buffet lunch it was. Honestly speaking I expected a lot better experience from a brand like HYATT. We went yesterday for buffet lunch.

The place was quite empty and we didn't even get a warm welcome which we all except. Decor was simple and sophisticated. 
There were no banner stating starters or main course or the like. Reading the names of the food items finding out main course was very easy but regarding starters we were a bit confused at first but then we figured it out. 
Coming to the quality of food it was below average, desserts we're lipsmaking thought. There was one veg and one non-veg starter ( the chicken was dry and a bit hard). There was three types of non-veg salads (fish, chicken, egg)- fish salad was stinking, we complained about it but they said it was the smell of smoke, but trust me it wasn't the smell of smoke. Pizza tasted extremely simple- chilly flakes and origano was not even provided. Main course was okay. Very limited variety of food items. But the deserts were heavenly. We spent 1 hr having desserts. That was the best part of the full buffet

Here's the thing. The manager was attentive, the waiters were more or less so. However, I found the experience average. Make no mistake about the fact that the quality and taste of food were at par. But here in lies the problem. I had too much expectations from a brand like Hyatt. To begin with, the entire buffet spread did not have a single item of fish or prawns. Keeping in mind that it was Sunday night and the spread was more expensive than usual, this was shocking. Moreover, there was only one non veg and one veg kebab. This is what JW Marriott does. It raises the bar to an impossible extent. The desserts section was stacked though. However, I seriously hope they redo the spread. Because frankly speaking, I have had way better even in places that are not that well known, at a fraction of the price.

A much awaited Saturday dinner at one of the most talked about and sumptuous places in Calcutta, Hyatt Regency last night turned out to be a disappointing affair. I could have called it just a sudden bad evening from the management point of view but the sharp decline in ratings of Waterside Cafe over time clearly shows they are doing something wrong and now I know why. It's both uncanny and unexpected that as grand as the place is, there's so much room for improvement. Be it the food quality, hospitality or mere hygiene.
To begin with there wasn't anybody present at the reception to either guide or welcome the guests, first disappointment. Then we get seated and still nobody shows up to at least ask about how would we like to proceed or suggest anything. I could spot used plates with leftovers on them on the very next table and nobody cared to clean that up even after passing by it a number of times. It was there, as it is, for a very long time. The buffet menu was very limited and unimpressive so we opted for Ala carte. Our order consisted of Surkh Laal Chicken Tikka, Chicken Pizza, Fish and Chips and a Tenderloin steak with root veggies.
We began with the Chicken Tikka, which was okay but pretty ordinary in taste, just spicer probably to go with the surkh laal name they have given to it. The Pizza was clearly a disappointment, goes both for the toppings and the bread. Coming to the fish and chips, which was served with loads of French fries and mayonese again was too flat in taste to talk about. The batter was crispier than necessary, had to much oil in it. My friend didn't enjoy his steak either, which wasn't perfectly cooked making it harder to cut or chew. After each not so impressive main courses, I wanted to end the meal on a sweet note so I ordered for a blueberry cheesecake. They were long gone and I didn't see my cake coming so finally it was served to me after I reminded them that I, in fact did ask for a cake in the first place. And they messed that up as well. Coated with blueberry jelly on top the cheesecake was not your typical melts-in-mouth cheesecake. The freshly cut fruits tasted better than the cake. During this entire course of us eating, not a single staff member even cared to visit once and ask if we are even enjoying the food or we need anything else. Not for a single time.
So to my utter surprise, Waterside Cafe, Hyatt Regency was a total disappointment in every section. As for a grand place like this I would definitely suggest to up their culinary standard as a foodie and if the management is listening most importantly their hospitality and service. The decor was lovely no doubt, but such cold and uncourteous staff can ruin your entire mood. And it's irreversible.

Don't judge a book by it's cover. This taken in the correct sense would mean something good, not for Waterside Cafe. The 5 star environment of Hyatt, groomed by glass fountain walls and posh ambient lighting has very little to offer to a true food lover.
The decor and ambience is exactly what you'd expect a restaurant of this status to have - a feeling that you're in a hi-fi place. 

Let's come to the food: Due to lack of enough good items in the butfet, we opted for a la carte.  I had a steak, my friends had fish and chips. The steak seemed overcooked and it took rather large amount of force to cut and chew. It was dry as a desert and once I put in my mouth, I literally didn't feel like swallowing it. To tell the truth, I've had beter food at a roadside dhaba. The fish and chips was also subpar, with the fish literally soaked in oil. Taste wasn't also something you'd be proud of. For something that charges you this much, you'd want it to have better quality.

Service: Oh, so much room for improvement. I don't know if the staff is even trained or not, but they didn't greet us or offer to hand us the menu, and when we asked for the menu, they handed us one and left. We had to raise voices and call after them to get their attention. This is not what you'd expect at a place like this.

Tl;dr : Nice place, bad service, worse food. Not value for money.

Well, very much disappointed with the well known Waterside Cafe, Hyatt Regency. Here I describe some points what I felt over here personally.

Decoration: Wall made up of glass, ambient lighting and wooden table gave this place an another type of charm to have a fine dine for a dating couple.

Courtesy: Much disappointed with the hospitality they showed. It felt like we are not attended properly. Not expected from a leading 5 star restaurant.

Food: If you want to have some food in the dinner may be you have to order it from the morning. Sometime they might forget what you have ordered, so keep knocking them if you want to have your food at the end. Now comes the taste part. Frankly speaking not much impressive as expected, but yes obviously not that much disappointing. It is quite normal in taste as the other renouned restaurant provides.

In brief I felt it "Not Value for Money."

No sorry , no I will get you a new one , nothing . Eggs came cold. Tea came after asking thrice . Waiters arguing at the counter . So not a 5 star .

Went there for a Weekday Lunch Buffet. The cafe has big Windows which provide a great view of the waterside and lush green outside. Ofcourse they don‚Äôt give you a seat with a good view insisting that it‚Äôs ‚ÄúReserved‚Äù. Obviously no one ever turns up. The manager was arrogant while the staff getting certain orders to the table were polite.
The buffet menu had Chaat, pasta & live counters and Chicken Biriyani to name a few. Was completely missing the Chinese cuisine here!

4 star for the View.

Tried the sunday brunch at hyatt waterside cafe was a decent affair . The food is a mix of italian , indian and muglai food .
You have the option to take the unlimited alcohol or go for the normal one , where they only serve you one cold drink per person .

The salads and deserts are worth the try at the brunch .

As for the starters and main course it is mostly reheated cold food on display , so dont expect much.

It was a good experience but its better to goto one of the specialised food places in hyatt.

If you don't want to taste a  gross,run of the mill dinner at a 5 star hotel on your special day don't go for the buffet .The buffet menu is too simple...Twice we had it  and twice  it spoiled our mood on our special day. So this time we went for a la carte .We ordered  two spaghetti aglio e olio  with bacon and one Mushroom and chicken fusilli in white sauce.The aglio e olio was okey as we specially mentioned  not to put to much oil in it ( as last time oil was dripping from the spaghetti).I found the fusilli the most uninteresting I have ever had. It seemed to be made with least care.All the chicken pieces were just boiled and simply thrown into the pasta. They taste better even when added in raw salads.Coming to the white sauce,I found hardly any mushroom in it...the sauce at least had some herby flavour in it but it was nothing special.It was seriously lacking that X factor which cheers up our mind and we feel to come once again for the same dish.But what disappointed us the most is the preparation of a simple cocktail.I couldn't believe how a restaurant of a 5 star hotel can prepare such a horrible LIT.It was just like having a tumbler of Coca-Cola with too much ice in it( so much that it becomes terribly cold for your teeth) and a pale,far-off,faint  flavour of the spirits. Overall It was enough to destroy our mood once again.
Some of their staff really need to get trained.Their is a difference between suggesting your guest what is best at your hand and showing a "Jack of all trade"  kind of attitude .The person didn't have any patience to know what we are trying to order.Rather he was always busy to prove how much  he knows about the menu of the other restaurants of the hotel.. seems to have no idea that seafood  can very much be added in a pasta.... just hearing the name "seafood"he thought we are after some prawn tandoori or something like that...how can somebody ask for a tandoori dish with pasta!!!! Lack of basic sense!Then realising that we are asking for some seafood options in pasta  he behaved in such a way  as if it will be a sheer blasphemy to add seafood in pasta and that can never be done here! 
With this kind of food, beverages and foolish behaviour  the restaurant should have been given the lowest rating( read a negative one).But then there is one single plus point for which we choose this place to celebrate our special moments repeatedly ( every time with a new hope that the options and quality of food will be better than that of the previous time....may be it has improved...may be it has changed a bit....)
That is the ambience...the water side...the soft murmuring of the little indoor brook,of the canopy of trees ...all bringing a slice of nature into the  interior. Definitely, this one has the best look among all the other coffeeshops of the five stars currently present in Kolkata.. only for the ambience I am giving it 2 ( if there was a special category for ambience I would have given it a 5/5) 
otherwise considering food and  anything else it's a big 0.

Recently went to this restaurant, located inside Hyatt for a buffet lunch on a weekday. As the name suggests, the restaurant has a good view of the hotel's pool and lush green lawns. A lot of natural light can be expected unlike typical dim restaurant lighting.

The restaurant is mostly known for its buffet, though there might be a-la-carte options available (not sure). The cuisine available here is mostly North Indian along with some Italian and continental preparations as well. Chinese and Asian cuisine is completely absent though.

Buffet layout is quite nice and the preparations are arranged sequentially in large bowls. Salads had few different options like Roasted Chicken, Egg, Fish and Veggie salads. However the appetizer section was disappointing. There was only one live counter serving chaat and that's it. No kebabs or other appetizers were available on that given day.

Coming to the main course, there were plenty of options to choose from. There were two live counters, one for Pizza and another one was serving Pasta. North Indian dishes included Chicken Biryani, Mutton Kasha, Tawa Fish, Achari Paneer, Palak Paneer, Corn Pulao and a whole lot of other dishes with a great combination of veg and non-veg options. Continental dishes was comprised of a fish preparation, a pork preparation, baked vegetables and few other items.

Taste test of the food, it was surprisingly not that great. Chicken Biryani was below par, pieces of chicken were bony and the Biryani had lack of some spices making it less authentic one. Mutton Kasha has the same story, too bony and not that tender. The pork preparation was good though. Pasta was pretty bad, tasted too plain for my liking. Naans served to us was too crisp.

Desserts section something I can praise about. Had a good amount of variety. Souffl√© was pretty good and the strawberry ice-cream was also nice. Brownie was also available however I couldn't find chocolate sauce or maybe I missed it.

Service, though good but not 5-star standard. We asked for aloo chaat but was wrongly given samosa chaat and our pasta took ages to come to the table. It is recommended not to wait for the table service, rather collect directly from the live counter. Servers were trying their best and were dedicated to their job, plates clearing was done at good efficiency.

Pricing is around ‚Çπ1700 per head for the lunch and dinner buffet on weekdays. However there are offers and discount at times which is a huge benefit as the price drops about 50% at times costing nearly ‚Çπ800 per head.

Overall I think its always a hit or a miss with these buffet restaurants. Some days the food may be excellent while other days its completely off. I guess I got an off day on this occasion.

I was here for a buffet lunch in weekend. We had a lot of expectations and were excited for the lunch. Even though I was aware of the buffet menu but still it didnt live upto our expectations. There were a lot of salad options ( chicken, fish, egg, fruit, sprout etc). We didn't have much of options in the starters. To mention specifically I enjoyed the live pizza and pasta counters only. The main course was decent. Desserts were also good and can be appreciated. 

But on making a comparison with the other buffet's the items in the menu were less and also the taste was not so much admirable.

In regard to the ambience it has a beautiful decor and the restaurant is beside the garden and the pool which adds the tinge of romance to it.

It is just the feel of the brand name that will satisfy your mind else if you are a real food lover, this is not the right choice.

Well to start off, booked lunch buffet for 5 person. Upon arriving were welcomed warmly by HYATT personnel, valet took care of my car. Manager was very couteous and showed pur best seats by the pool. He even explained in details the various food varieties offered in the lunch. The Ambience was good. You dont need to shuffle between food counters like other buffets, waiters will serve it to your table. The main highlight was the desserts. Extremely happy with the food experience. Thank you.

This had been my first visit to Hyatt and I was quite excited for the experience of food. I have been there for dinner and I liked the way the table has been adorned with dim candles and blue glasses. It will surely serve for a romantic candle-light dinner. I loved the ambience but the only drawback is , the lights are so dim that a photocholic will be dissapointed as the photos wont come that good. (Until you have some great phone with a greater camera).
Next coming to the food --- I absolutely loved their starters of kebabs and fish. I loved their pizza.
Biriyani was ok. Pasta was not that good , I didnot like it. And next comes the desserts , I liked all the pastries except the red velvet one. Overall , a good experience !

Located in one of the renowned five star hotels of Kolkata, this place perfectly gives the feeling of so called  luxury dining. From sumptuous starters to delicious desserts , it's a treasure for delicacies. The pool side view, the background music, food presentation  , decorations - everything wonderfully made an auspicious ambience. This is the first time I tried for customised food. You can ask to make with your own choice of ingredients and they will present in the exactly same way.But what made an X factor is the courteousness off the staff over  there. I somehow did n't prefer the biryani that much. But I was surprised when the head chef came and prepared  a fusion  biryani exclusively  for me . That made my day.üòÑüòç

This splendid 5 star hotel serves lip smacking food. 
The magestic gandeur of this architectural brillance will enthrall you.  The decor of this place is quiet exquisite. It has a lovely view of the pool side and the lush green garden.  
Food- we were served with a huge option of starters. Which had cold as well as hot ones.  The ones i tasted were - Chicken salad,  Aspagragus salad,  Shrimp in tropical veggie salsa,  Grilled Chicken tossed with cherry tomatoes and onion,  Lamb liver with mints and bell peppers.  
For main course we had - mustard hilsa,  Hilsa egg soup,  Breads,  Lemon and coconut rice,  Tofu,  Chilly fish,  Thai curry,  Mutton biriyani,  Chicken chap,  Spinach tossed with veggies and many more. 
There was a wide range of desserts from quintessential bengali misti they had modern aristocratic desserts.  They served icecreams with your choice of topping which is a must try.  The food was worth having. 
Ambience - the place is perfect for a romantic dinner as it has an awesome view and is sure to impress your taste buds. 
Service - the Service of this place Isn't upto mark unlike the other 5 star hotels of Kolkata.  They must surely work on their hospitality more.  It is what makes the customers come again and again. 
Overall - 
Food- 4
Service- 3 
Ambience - 4. 5
Value for money - 4
Do Visit this place.  You will surely have a lovely time and great food.

Well, after much ado, paid a visit to the revered Waterside Caf√© @ Hyatt, Saltlake, Sector 3, only to be overall disappointed!

The buffet range and presentation does impress you, but the most important aspect ‚Äì TASTE ‚Äì is missing! The range does provide you all variety one can ask for ‚Äì but at the end, you definitely feel that only your stomach has been satiated, not your soul! Not going down on the individual items, as hardly any of them had an everlasting impact on me!

Service is great, so is the ambience ‚Äì to conclude, expect everything, even quality food, but not TASTY!

Located in Hyatt regency, one of the best places for a date night or a lunch with the special one.

Decor: Very well setup with glass wall on one side offering a view of the pool and lush green ground with plenty of sunlight coming in.

Staff: Courteous and knows about the food.

Food: We had opted for the lunch buffet and food is where it bowls you over. With plenty of cold cuts and a wide range of salads. The starters were delicious to say the least. The mains were also a hit. The meat were perfectly cooked and full of flavours. There pizza and pasta counter.
The best part were the desserts with a range of western and indian sweets. Looks as good as they taste.

Overall: Heavy on the pocket but totally worth the money. 
Tip: Purchase some coupons to make it value for money.

I visited Hyatt for the Puja Midnight buffet on saptami. It was a worst possible selection of food and the quality left much to be desired. At the cost being charged ..it was a total waste of time. I felt cheated by the overall experience. After experienceing the high quality buffet at JW and HHI we definitely will not visit again.

Seating by a beautiful green lawn and having their delicious breakfast buffet is a must try. They have a huge selection of buffet breakfst menu, provides a lot of choices.

Sometime back me and my partner visited the place. As soon as we reached our car was assisted by men near the valet parking. We were shown our way but since a party was going on near the poolside we entered the wrong place. After rectifying we finally got our table which was already reserved beforehand. The ambience was really amazing, well enough to get people stick along there seats for long. We were served the soup at the table. Being a Chinese cuisine lover I was overwhelmed to taste it. Later on after starting with the feast we tasted chicken salad, beef salad, chicken salami, lasagna and corn. The texture of the food was good enough to melt into the mouth. I ordered for pasta from the live counter. The cheese was enough to droll me over it again and again. We tried the main course. Since there was a huge variety of food I wasn't able to taste all. But the biryani, mutton and fish tikka were superb. Then came the calorie gaining part, desserts. Ice-cream, pastry, kheer, rasgulla were enough to stuff me. The experience was a great one. And the food quality was really good. But there's one suggestion, since the buffet price is 2300 per head with tax, there can a complimentary drink added to the list.

Went on Independence day for the lunch buffet.
Ambience and service was top notch-as is expected to be in a luxury hotel.
In terms of food, the buffet includes a salad and chat counter,pizza and pasta counter,an assortment of main course items including Indian , Bengali as well as continental fare and the usual dessert counter.
There were a lot of varieties to choose from in the salad and chat counter which also included a cheese platter.
The thin crust pizza made to order was delectable and so was my bowl of spaghetti aglio de oglio.
In terms of appetizers there were just two in the form of a crispy fried fish and murgh kebab.The fish was one of the best items on offer but sadly that can't be said about the murgh kebab.Overcooked rubbery chicken which lacked any flavor or seasoning.
Talking of seasoning,it seems that the chefs were perhaps a bit miserly with the use of salt.Lack of seasoning was apparent in almost all of the main courses.There was biriyani,polao and parathas to choose from to be had with three different chicken preparations, a Bengali style shorshe fish and a pork curry.Among the vegetarian offerings, I only tasted the baked vegetable lasagne which was absolutely flavorless.
The dessert section was a treat to the eyes with the Indian tricolor being beautifully represented in the white chocolate parfaits, eclairs and berry cakes.There was nothing to fault in the desserts to be true.
Overall a grossly overpriced buffet with the food quality not being up to the mark of a star address in the city.There are far better buffet options available elsewhere at more reasonable prices.
Except for the ambience, the experience was kind of a let down.

They offer North Indian and Continental only along with few types of salads. Anyways the food was too good and so were the stewards. The ambience was also good enough. They were all so well behaved. The spread was good enough to fill one's appetite. Apart from that they also have a well maintained lawn and pool.

Went for an anniversary date. Expected everything to be just perfect.
Opted for buffet dinner. Went first to the salad(starter) bar.¬†
My wife had 2 spoons of fish salad.
Bommmmmbbbbbb!
She found a long black hair in the salad right standing there at the bar.
It was horrible. Hair within food in a 5 star hotel??!!
Complained to the chef as well as the manager.
Rest of the food was cold(not even at room temperature). not even the Tandoori.
Felt really down with the quality control of the food.It ruined my special date.
To compensate, the manager offered 20% discount on food bill, which I consider to be foolish.
If this had happened in US or UK, the restaurant would hve been sued for serving unhygienic food but sadly we live in a 3rd world country with 5 star hotels.

It was an experience to be there and taste their delicacies. I was present there for a buffet dinner on a Sunday. The quad the food was top notch. I liked the salads and the chicken starter, which was so much delicious. Though they offer a variety of veg main courses but they choices in non-veg main course part was very limited. The mocktails and pizza was also good. Now, I come to my favorite part, the desserts. It was like a dessert heaven completely, they offer uncountable dessert items, I tasted most of it, yet missed few of them I believe. There were cakes, pastries, sweets, ice cream, rabri, chocolates and many fusion desserts, all of them were just great. Overall, a great visit indeed.

Comments are on the Bfast spread: Nothing that great compared to a Hyatt Delhi or even a Hyatt Ahmedabad B'fast spread. Breads, cereals, dosa/idly counter.. essentially conti & Indian was definitely in the menu but something was amiss. Not upto that 5 star category or other Hyatt category, I felt. Staff extremely helpful & courteous, will go out of there way to assist.

The starter was Ok, but very limited options.
In main course I tasted mostly everything and only tawa paneer and sorshe mach tasted well, other than that, the lamb was filled with bones and tasted bad, the broccoli wasn't cooked well, gobi was "ok".¬†
Coming to the dessert, I did not like anything. Yes everything looked very pretty but tasted very bad.

Being a big fan of buffets, I had to visit this place and judge it myself. Honestly it is a little over-hyped. The salads and desserts are to die for but the main course wasn't up to the expectations. The spread was not as much as the other competing 5 star buffet restaurants. Nevertheless the food was delicious.
We started with Cold Salads, where we had boundless choices, and thus ended up trying all of them. Their baby corn salad was truly lip smacking. Never thought baby corn could taste this good. There was Paneer, Chicken, Fish and also Egg salad. Moving on, there was Dahi Vada, one of my favourite dishes, which was so perfectly soft. This was by far one of the best Dahi Vada I had.
Next, we tried the soups, which was kind of tasteless. Also there is a live pizza counter, so we tried the Pizza which was really tasty and cheesy. The crust was perfect, neither to hard nor too soft. Then comes the Indian dishes . In Vegetarian there was Butter Paneer, Aloo Gobi, Bengali style Aloo Dum, Broccoli with yogurt stuff , Yellow Dal and Chole Masala. In Non Vegetarian , there was a King Fish(seafood), Mutton Curry, Chicken Biriyani. Along with this we could choose any Indian bread. The Biriyani flavours were just right.
Coming the most awaited part of the buffet, the dessert time. There were quite a lot of choices, but the chocolate dishes were too sweet to handle. The Banoffee, Apple pie and Apricot pudding was marvelous and stole the show. But it doesn't end there. Along with this there is a live waffle counter. The ending couldn't be any better. As it is said, Waffle a day, keeps the doctor away. We simply couldn't miss that. We topped the waffles with blueberry syrup and some vanilla ice-cream and it was simply lip smacking. Overall it was an satisfying lunch and we relished each and every dish on the menu. Only would suggest a few more options for Desserts.
The ambience was beautiful and also the view of the fountain was just cheery on top. The staff was courteous, but could be a little more attentive. It was a wonderful experience and truly had a delightful lunch. It's definitely a place to try out once and decide for yourself.

Overall it was an satisfying lunch and we relished each and every dish on the menu. Only would suggest a few more options for Desserts.
The ambience was beautiful and also the view of the fountain was just cheery on top. The staff was courteous, but could be a little more attentive. It was a wonderful experience and truly had a delightful lunch. It's definitely a place to try out once and decide for yourself.

WARNING ! 

Worst food you could ever think of. 
Pathetic mutton. Chicken biriyani was stale. Decomposed misti doi. Prawn salad without prawns. 

100% wastage of money

Thumbs up : its HYATT. The deserts . I mean u can just fill ur tummy with the crazy spread of desi n videsi deserts. Must try - marshmallows they are just ummmmm , choc mud pie , n everything in desert. 

Thumbs down : the main course . U might expect it to be tasty but its not. I was literally heart broken to not have been served with tasty food.

Overall the experience is really good. U can come here again just for deserts they are just yum.

Went there a couple of days back - the good thing about this place is the food, the ambience and the view you have while enjoying your meal. However, on the downside is the terribly slow service which can definitely be improved!¬†

Had the vegetable burger as well as a few North Indian dishes. All of them tasted nice and wasn't too heavy unlike other restaurants.

My love for food brought me to The Waterside Cafe.
We were 3 people and we went there for breakfast buffet. It is located in the ground floor of the hotel.
It is a nice cozy place with slow music in the background and comfortable seating options.
The staff is very friendly and courteous. We were first asked for coffee/tea by the server.
They have a lot of options:
Eggs, toast, south-indian, rice, fresh-cut fruits, juices(both fresh and canned), cold-cut meat, cheese, continental, desserts, etc.
They also have live counters for eggs, waffle, pancakes, etc.

Now moving on to the food:
I first indulged myself in a platter of fruits. of watermelon, papaya, muskmelon, grapes, kiwi, apples, etc.
 
Then i opted for an egg-white masala omlette with toast which is a must have for breakfast(with orange juice ofcourse!).  Mysore masala dosa was my selection from the south-indian section.
Then 

Later, for desserts we chose from the variety of muffins, croissant, waffles and pancakes with maple syrup and choco-chips. One thing I didn't like about the desserts was that were no doughnuts in the spread. 
They also have a variety of breads to choose from.
Overall experience was nice.
As for the pricing, it is 1100 for 1 person which is absolutely amazing for such a lovely spread :)

Bought a Nearbuy coupon and hence my experience was worth every penny (because a lunch buffet came for pretty cheap).
The food here is brilliant and so is the ambience. A classic rendition of tenderness and attention to detail in each dish if I can be utterly honest. As per my experience, everything on the buffet menu is recommendable. They serve beef as well.
You might then ask, why an entire point and a half less? For the pathetic sense of service. Many low end restaurants have better and more courteous attendants than the ones here. It took them a clocked 20 minutes to refill my glass of water.
When you're going to the likes of Hyatt, you expect a flawless service along with a suitable taste and quality of ingredients. Hyatt failed in the service segment by a gigantic margin.

It was a treat from my brother and we chose to go for the buffet spread at the Waterside Cafe, Hyatt Regency. Service, ambience, decor everything was top notch, as expected. However, the food, the taste, in particular could have been far better. Save for a beef salad, a chicken pizza off the live counter and the potent combination of mutton biriyani with chicken chap, all the other items were average and nothing to write home about. The dessert section was disappointing, almost all the desserts bordered on being sour and bitter. I will certainly expect better quality from a restaurant of this stature on my next visit.

It was my mother's treat on her birthday last month when we decided to visit this restaurant with a naturally gifted view. The decor, ambience and feel of the restaurant is 10 out of 10 but I got a little disappointed with the food and the service part. When you visit a 5 star deluxe hotel you expect a world class experience but I did not get that feeling over here. The spread of menu looked less to me especially the non veg part as there were only 3 non veg main course 2 non veg starters in it. The service was slow and sometimes I had to repeatedly ask  the waiters to get the order on my table. The desert section is definitely the best among all the courses of menu. For a good ambience and experience of a Hyatt property you must visit this place but not with the expectation to eat a sumptuous spread of menu.

Not at all value for money. Even if we are paying premium for it, the quality, the taste and the service is way below average. A regular restaurant at park street has beet service and food quality than this.

Our dream had come true at last, after avoiding many obstacles we reached to our dream to be here. We went for buffet through nearbuy. Firstly I would say the ambiance was superb, spectacular, glamorous...... and so on. It was surrounded by green garden area; Astounding beauty it was. Let's talk about foods. There were two sections like veg n nonveg. In nonveg there were so many items and it may not look right if I sit to write all those names. So it would be better if you can visit and see it live. But the day we went couldn't‚Äã find any grilled item in starter. So lil disappointed. However, it was our generous experience. Highly recommend for everyone. Looking forward to have soon.

Made prior reservation owing to a Saturday afternoon.
The place was not that busy and that for me is a possitive point.You can enjoy your food and relax and talk ,unlike JW on a Saturday afternoon.
This was my 3rd visit but I went through the review in Zomato and many complained the food was not good. I dnt knw but maybe the chef too read the review and decided to make the food delicious as I found the food quite tasty and delicious.
The food had chicken as starter ,beef and mutton in the main course.
There was veg lazania which was one of the best I had till today.
There was Thai fish balls which were the only thing below average.
We were given a option of a non veg pizza and topping of their choice( I guess they have one topping only for non veg). The pizza was thin crust and looked awesome (pic attached).
Now the veg counter had one of the best simple made items like gobi masala, dal and masala rice and awesome Shahi panner ( Try it with butter nun).
The desert included cakes, halwa,Bengali sweets, banana fried balls and ice cream.
So overall a well money spend and the staff was curticious. A day well spent.

The staffs were courteous. As we had gone pretty late in the night, there was nothing much that was served, but it was enough to carry on our chit chats and shoo away the hunger!!¬†

A dream come true. For the first time in my life I went to a 5 star hotel for dine in. And why not !¬†
It was my first marriage anniversary and I find it the right place to celebrate the grand occasion with my better half.

The grand ambiance and courteous staffs make it just awesome . It is the right place for the romantic candle night dinner.

We ordered a mock-tail. After that in starter we ordered Herb crusted Kolkata Betki with braised leek sauted potato and balsamic reduction. It was too good. In the main course we tried Grilled Scottish Salmon with sauted spinach. The best ever Salmon preparation it was I have ever had.In the main course we tried just scoop of Icecream.

Overall it was a grand experience.

We went there on 1st April 2017 for lunch buffet. We had reserved a table and had to change the reservation which was done easily by the hotel. We were given a table instantly when we reached.
The disappointing part was the spread of the buffet in a 5 star hotel. Even taste wise the food was not great especially being a vegetarian there was only 3-4 types of aloo available and nothing else. 

They do not have any live counter and the staff was also not very courteous. when one of us asked for a piece of Garlic bread, he was told that few pieces has been asked by someone else on the table and to go and take from their. This kind of stuff is Neva heard of. The items were getting over and the time being taken to refill was huge. Corn, mushrooms salad didn't have mushrooms ( baring a piece or two if u search diligently in the entire plate). 

Over all people might just want to go there just of they have to go to a 5 star hotel. The staff as compared to other hotels/restaurant of this category are far more courteous and willing to help and spread and taste of the food is also way better.

Had been to this place for a buffet barbeque dinner. The place was simply a stunner with and exotic ambience. It was in the month of January, hence the weather was quite chilly! The music playing was soft and soothing and the lawn made it perfect for spending quality time with your loved one. Now the food, though I am not really sure what they serve apart from the buffet, but the buffet food was definitely disappointing to the power infinity. It was bland, and lacked flavour completely. The pizza and the dessert were decent and thank god for it. They had unlimited drinks on the menu, which was the saviour. To sum it up, unless you are looking for spending a quiet and romantic time with your loved ones, or want to enjoy and chill with drinks without the cacophony usually seen in the pubs, even the pricier ones, this could be your go-to place.

I had gone for a dinner buffet on Saturday with my family. I must say that i was thoroughly disappointed.

¬†First and foremost the live pasta counter had pre-decided toppings for the pasta(the toppings being a few carrots and some broccoli) and on requesting them to add some mushrooms and olives to my spaghetti in white sauce, I was told that wouldn't be possible though i could see them chopping olives right in front of my eyes.  So basically I was served spaghetti in a very average white sauce with some carrots  as toppings.¬†                                                                                      

The buffet spread had north indian and continental.However there was no inclusion of any prawns/mutton. All i could see was the buffet was filled with paneer and mushroom(may be they saved it by not adding it to the pasta) dishes. I also saw "aloo posto" as one of the dish in the buffet spread which really surprised me(because i don't think it is a part of either north indian or continental cuisine). To add to all of this , the food was not warm/hot but rather cold.¬†

I would say that the dessert section was the only saving grace though nothing extra ordinary. I loved the chocolate pudding and apple crumble.Also the salads and appetizers were good.¬†
The ambiance was up to the standards of Hyatt, however, I wouldn't want to spend the amount that I spent on their buffet ever again. I think there are plethora of better options available at this price.

Went back to my beloved and my very own Hyatt regency after almost 7 years and nothing has changed at all. 
Same feeling of welcoming from the very first entry till the bills are handed.
Tried the spectacular fish n chips from the midnight menu. 
The pasta however was a tad bit too much on salt content but what the heck! The wine did a superb magic and complimented my meal and brought back my extensive memories with the worlds best hotel group. 

Being an ex hyattian ( not being biased ) I feel proud that we always have kept the quality at a top notch level.

This is the place where the spouse and I often come to celebrate a quite moment or two. The trickling of the water within the sitting area has a calming effect; the lush greenery that can be viewed just outside takes one away from the concrete jungle for a while. This place offers a huge buffet spread that has a wide variety -- there is something for everybody -- from sushi, to pizza to butter chicken -- you name it, and it is there. My special favourite is the carving station where the meat is beautifully carved and served. The customised salad bar is also a hit. Pocket pinch for two around 6k including beverages.

I celebrated my birthday here and it was a pleasant experience. The ambience was just perfect as we got to sit facing the lush lawns and the arched fountains. I ordered a drink that was not on the menu and the staff very sweetly obliged me so the meal started off on a positive note. Though the buffet was not extensive, the selection seemed to cover just enough....there was beef stew, chicken biryani, chicken stroganoff, herb scented fish, vegetable moussaka and paneer lifafa on the menu along with a sublime rajma that just stole the show. I loved how fast the Indian breads that we ordered at the live counter came to the table. The taste of the food did not disappoint. We were so full with the starters and mains that just had space for ice-cream for dessert. Special mention of the fact that they got me cake with a lovely sparkler atop! :)

I visited this place on my 25th and trust me it was worth it. The AMBIENCE is the reason i was there. The waterside cafe is one of the restaurents in hyatt which is opened 24x7 i guess. The view is very tempting it overlooks the pool and the fountain outside. We ordered the buffet with sparkling wine. There was not even a single moment which i did not enjoy at this place. The food is so soft and their huge variety of desserts will win your heart. In addition there was a lady singing John lenon songs inside the cafe which may soothe your mood more üòÅ. CHEERS!

It totally justifies being a part of the Hyatt regency. Just a warning, ask the staff about the contents of mocktails before ordering because fancy names might not be that great in taste. Try the pizza there, its above par.

Wonderful ambiance with poolside cafe to pull the romantic moods. Red wine with smoky bar-b-q was just awesome during the year end time and the classy service as expected. Love to go again and again.

This is the first time that I am so overall impressed by a place that I would want to visit it daily. I went for the lunch buffet on my birthday. The food had a lot of varieties and I loved every one of the dishes. The salads and desserts were delicious. Loved the ambience and the hospitality too. Extremely impressed.

Food is average 
Service is also average 
However the ambience is pretty buzzing and the silver lining is the view . 
Amazing view of the gardens and fountains of the Hayat garden area ! 
Do make sure to get a window side table :)

Revisited for lunch after a long time. Very disappointed. Used to be one of the best lunch buffets in town. Huge fall in standards. Certainly not worth the Rs 1947 (includes GST) per pax - especially when other options like JW Marriott have come up in the vicinity who offer a much better spread. The salad section had only a Mediterranean with some lettuce and unimpressive cheese selections. Not even any good dressings. Pizza - offered toppings of only bell-pepper,  button mushrooms and onions (Chicken for Non Vegetarians - not even Pepperoni or Ham). Base was Maida - no whole wheat dough available. Rest of the main courses were as unimpressive as they could get and surprisingly limited options. Revising ratings down to 2.5. Certainly off my listfor good.  Hyatt Regency Kolkata


The winter pool-aide Bar-b-que is a good idea - as no other 5 star hotel in Calcutta can provide such an option keeping away the mosquitoes. The chill around Makar-Sankranti made the ambience even more enticing with the fire on Angetis adding both to the romance and warmth. The Bar-b-Que fare was better than average. Among meats - the honey-glazed Pork Spare-ribs and Tenderloin stood out (both local - I suspect). The salads and Mezze platter though somewhat limited were interesting. In the lovely weather - the hot crepes were delightful for a short while transporting the senses to December evening in the streets of Europe as it were.

The 2nd best in town for buffet i guess now i have tried marioott. I have been here for work parties, events, meeting like 20-30 times in last 2-3 yrs.
The breakfast buffet is the best in town. If you have breakfast like this at 11 a.m believe me you don't need eat anything till dinner.
Best experience, amibence ,thumbs up for the staff and for the food i would say please come and see for yourself.

The smokey pork and the deserts are mouth watering. As well as the drinks.Specially the red wine and the dessert wine which I tested first.All over a very good experience.Want to visit there again.

A disappointing dining experience. Visited waterside on New Years to have a memorable day but returned with a huge disappointment. We had no plans for buffet but on reaching we were suggested to try the buffet as a la carte would take 45 minutes to serve. We did see the display and thought why not what can go wrong in a 5* diner. But little did we know that the food would be so average and service so ill managed. First we were told  by this lady server that the tables were reserved and seconds later we were directed to the same so called RESERVED table by another attendant. They themselves don't know the availability of tables. Seriously need to maintain their reputation.

Now coming to food. Oh my god. A 2* layout in a 5* place. In starters they had salad and cold cuts where the fish and prawn tasted bland and yuck. Only fish tikka on the kebab side and they were hard and dry. No chicken or prawn or mutton kebabs. They had a veg and egg drop chicken soup which is ok. Don't expect much. Now for mains they had pasta, chilly chicken, veg noodles, chicken biryani, mutton kosha and posto,palak panir , jungli aloo and two other aloo varieties and peas rice and daal. Now being a pure non veg I don't wish to eat veg esp when I am visiting a fine dining and it's New Years for heavens sake. Why would I pay Rs.2000 for bunch of veg delights.So if you analyse carefully they had nothing to impress. The mutton was average, chicken from biryani was chewy. Only the jungli aloo was different and good. 

The desserts were ok. Definitely nothing compared to other star hotels. Waste of money and time. They don't even have dessert spoons. We were 4 and we paid 9500. Guys if you love buffet go to bar b que nation or sigree or flame and grill , blu nile or mainland. Any other place is any day better than Hyatt . At least you will come out with a happy satisfied tummy and wallet. And if you visit a star hotel then go to Marriott or taj. At least they have variety and are maintaining their standards. 

Ambience is good but poolside was shut so yeah a bit crammed up and you could actually hear people complain about the paucity of items.

Not visiting anytime soon. Poor quality of food at a Steep price. Not worth it.

We had been here last night for anniversary dinner. Great ambiance and courteous and a good buffet spread. Salads, main course and desserts were quite good. Although the chicken tikka tasted soft and succlucent,  I was not expecting only 1 starter. Chicken biryani tasted excellent. Also, they served butter nun on request which tasted amazing with rara mutton. Spent a memorable evening at Waterside Cafe. Deducted 1 point only because number of items could have been more.

We had gone here as a walk in guest couple of months back for breakfast.
And this place surely provides one of the best and magnificent breakfast buffet in the city.
We got bread,omelettes of our own choice like stuffed with mushroom cheese or masala.
There were sausages,ham,pork,lentils,stuffed tomatoes,fresh juices etc.
The food tasted amazing.
And the pancakes were bliss.‚ù§
They are made by the chefs with fillings of our own choices.
I had a chocolate pancake served with whipped cream and waffles.
And my friend had banana pancake served with honey.
The best part was their bakery section.
Its like a small piece of paradise for foodies.
After our breakfast,the girl at the reception told us to take a walk inside.
The poolside garden is a very beautiful place to sit and chat. üòÅ

We had the buffet which comprised of soft drinks, veg/non-veg soup,salad,starters,main course,desserts. Among the dishes i tried were murgh tikka kabab,stir fried fish,chicken in hot garlic sauce,jeera pulao,chicken biriyani,mutton rezala,palin naan,chana masala,pasta in white sauce. The food was great. I especially loved the dessert counter which had macaroons,hazelnut cake,caramel mud cake,waffles,pastries,caramel pop tarts as well as Indian desserts like gulab jamun,mishti doi,etc. Would love to go back another time.
P.S. The waffles were just awesome :)

Visited a number of trademarks hotels, but the thing that made Hyatt a different hotel is its peace, calm and well decorated environment that will give you a pleasure and beautiful moment to spend .the light around everywhere should be brighter a bit so that a good quality of snaps could be captured without camera flash. the food quality could have been little bit better except desert items

This place is simply exotic. A friend of mine decided to give his birthday treat here and so we landed up in this place. We are extremely happy since we chose this place. We opted for the lunch buffet. It consisted of a huge variety of salads, of which I became a fan of the pineapple salad, for starters there was the dahi vada, lasuni chicken kabab, butter tossed veggies, fish cake, hara paneer tikka and for main course there was chicken biryani, mutton, jodhpuri aloo, paneer, sona moong daal, tarka and a few beef dishes. Each and every dish was done with intricate care and they tasted superb! The thing that completely blew my mind was the desserts and bakery section. The wide range of desserts will keep you drooling! I was so full that I couldn't try even half of the desserts, so next time I visit I'll try a few desserts first before starting with the others going by the quote, "Life is short, eat desserts first"!
In short, this place is worth a visit for every foodies ‚ù§

**600th Review**
A surprise from the dear husband landed us here on a weekday night. The chosen place for dinner was the huge and elaborate buffet spread at Waterside Cafe. Hyatt is a well versed name and quite popular. The food served is top notch and absolutely at par with that of a 5 start hotel.
I was preserving my 600th for my foodie friends but with this happening, could not have been more special! :)
The buffet was elaborate and stretched from one corner of the room to the other. They served us drinks on the table while the rest of the food was to be self served. The array of salads was mesmerizing, the beef salad stood out.
In the live pasta section, the white sauce needs a special mention, it was thin and a little runny but the taste was impeccable when teamed with the spaghetti.
The main course showcased variety and impressed us big time. The mutton biriyani and the murgh tikka kebab was excellent. I could not get enough of them.
What caught my attention and kept the smile intact on my face were the desserts!! Oh my god!!!From red velvet cake to blueberry cheesecake to bundi to malpua to raspberry pudding to tempered white chocolate sticks, they had it all!! The best caramel custard is made here followed by the berry cake. The waffles are done as per your liking, and the chocolate eclairs!! I think I can die in peace now. :D
Lastly, a big shout out to my friends who have been with me through this, as a result of which I have reached here. Lastly, thank you

Desserts were superb with wide choices from both Indian and western ¬†items. overall a good experience

A waterside cafe that stays open anytime is the stuff I look for.Went here to catch up with an old friend at 11:30 pm .The place is spacious but the decor average.we all know how much better one can do with a waterside themed cafe
Anyway we ordered a tomato & basil soup,a Greek salad and a penny arabbiata and 2 salted lemonades to wash it down.
The pasta was authentic but low on herbs and a runny tomato sauce,the salad was fresh & chilled but unappealing to the eye and largely the tongue too.
The soup was just how it should be and the lemonade average.
The staff needs better training is the least I'd say.
Overall a very average experience.And average is not what you'd expect at the Hyatt.
I am disappointed .
Way too Average!

Food was not up to the mark at all!
Quality and number of dishes were really poor.
Very disappointed!
Only thing that was anywhere near tasty were the deserts which were kind of locked up in a safe and you'd have to ask for it... which I found very annoying! No where in a buffet I've observed such bad service!

Truely living up to the spirit they proclaim, of fine dining. Hyatt being so, that the ambiance would be amazing is nothing that should come across as a surprise, hence without wasting time let's straight jump into the aspect of food. Buffet had an array of variation- continental and north Indian. The grilled fish and the Fish Amritsari melted in the mouth. The salad spread was beautifully tasty so was the mutton and chicken side dishes. However though alluring it may have looked, the live pizza did not taste that great, due to the overpowering Tang of the tomatoes. Deserts were the star of the show for me. From the finesse of the desert detailing to the taste- 5/5. Finally, though a buffet spread- the service was extremely warm and cordial with the management asking us occasionally if we are enjoying our meal (a courteous approach not so frequently encountered even in the finest of dinning at times). Over all a very satisfying experience.

Visited the place for dinner buffet. Very poor service. Online they mentioned starters but they failed to include a single starter in the menu. When asked about the same the staff ignored it completely. Dinner menu was very poor. They were not refilling the food. Long que. Highly unsatisfactory. Not promising at all. Wastage of money. Will never visit the place again. A big no no for others.

Visited this 5 star luxury poolside dinning couple of time for personal as well as corporate purpose. Ambience is classy with 5 star experience in terms of hospitality. But when it comes to dinner buffet spread the taste is just blunt for most of the cuisines. We visited with our clients and found a bit challenging in choosing the right food from the buffet except few dessert. However in terms of ala-carta we enjoyed the fish fry only.

Reading the below reviews I am really afraid and I am confused ¬†if I have done a good thing to book a table for tomorrow's dinner for my son's birthday. Though i have given 4.5 because of the experience I had over the phone while booking (I spoke to some one named Mr Amit...). I was not sure if I need to get a coupon for my 5 yr old child (from Nearbuy) as I was not getting any option to get a Kid-Coupon as Mr Amit advised, so he said ¬†NOT TO WORRY as they will do arrangements what so ever ¬†would be required. ¬†So as per his advice I made booking for 2 adults and 1 child. Later I called up and spoke to someone named Sukhriti whom I told to ask Mr Amit to do the reservation for 3 adults and 1 child and she said Mr Amit would call me up. Though no call is received yet and my fingers are crossed to have a good quality spread tomorrow for my son's birthday...The booking is done in the name of my wife S Das.

Soothing lights, shining decor, ambience with sophisticated vibes of plush highlife, with a poolside partitioned by a glass wall, is definitely sure to create an immediate perception in someone's mind so as to ensure an experience of exploring a superfine eating/dining, that is not only worth living up to it, but worth cherishing as well, as a prized possession in memoirs.
And exactly that's what is the impression that "Waterside Cafe" creates from its very first appearance.

You may call it a misfortune, or a bad day for you, the moment when the show begins and all your expectation developed, just vapourises like a piece of camphor, leaving behind a below average experience for you.
When a place is registered on Zomato, it is expected that the fellow foodies using the app, should share photographs of the ambience along with the reviews, so far the foodies code and conduct are concerned.
But my dear friend, you may face a resistance from their side in this context, and specially, if the Stewart for your table, is Mr. Abhijeet, he will aggressively stop you from clicking pictures, and will totally deny your reasoning behind the act, only to make sure that 'he is right and you have to abide by his dictations". Even you may end up listening to his version of Zomato's media sharing policies, which unfortunately do not match up with what actually is mentioned in the website/mobile app.

And coming to the service part, it is not only unprofessional, but rather can be termed as a "Stupid" one when, in a birthday celebration, someone asks the birthday boy himself that what should be the name on the cake, even when everything is informed well in advance before checking in!! And the showstealer in this act is none other than Mr. Abhijeet himself.

After all these, if you have slightest remnants of any hope left with you, the food is enough to kill that even.
Extremely ordinary, are the dishes, and comes nowhere, in comparison to a restaurant of a 5 star property like "Hyatt Regency". And if you prefer to have 'Spaghetti', it can be clearly said that it will ruin your palate for the same, for life!!
Surprisingly, if you go by the price of the dishes, you'll find it overly high, and unjustified.

I expect the management takes a note of everything written above, and take necessary measures to rectify the flaws.
All the best.

(The ambience shots shared here, are the ones taken just before the resistance came from Mr. Abhijeet, resulting in being prevented from taking any more clicks of the ambience)

A heavily overpriced place where the food is very average. Ambience is pretty decent. It's said that it's huge reputation has all come down to such shame. I would recommend to avoid this outlet but I you still want to waste your valuable money then just go ahead and feel sorry for the rest of your life.

Walk inside Hyatt and climb down the stairs and you'll be standing inside what looks like one of the finest cafes of this city.

We(7 people) went there(11 pm-12:30 am) to celebrate a friend's birthday.

There is really nothing much to say about the food. It sucks. Still, for the sake of this review, I'll write them down:

Food ordered:

‚Ä¢paratha
‚Ä¢butter chicken
‚Ä¢fish and chips
‚Ä¢spaghetti bolognaise

3 parathas were served for the price of 600 bucks. My mom makes far better parathas.

Butter chicken was palatable. Nor soicy we thouh. Thick, creamy gravy with tender boneless chicken pieces. Pretty average!

Fish and chips was again okayish. 3 pieces of Crumb fried fish was served asking with fries and tartar sauce. The first was cooked properly but lacked in flavour. And the fish was not of superior quality.

Spaghetti bolognaise was an absolute disaster. Not palatable at all! The sauce was tasteless. The spaghetti was cold and bland. Absolute rubbish!

To top it all off, Mr Abhijit was a huge turn off. Nup, not coming back anytime soon!

Hyatt Regency's Waterside Cafe is one of the finest cafe in the city with some huge reputation. Visited there with couple of my friends at midnight to celebrate a friend's birthday. Firstly we had some table issues with the management which was not a liked factor truly. Such unprofessional ¬†behavior at this kind of cafe is not acceptable.¬†
Expectations were really high as it was first ever visit to this place. It got all shattered in some period of time with some very ordinary food. Crumb Bhetki was very okayish so was the Tawa Paratha. Murgh Tikka Butter Masala somehow saved the day with some decent taste and quality. Spaghetti was not upto the mark as it was expected to be, seemed very simple.¬†
Management needs to be more friendly with the walk in customers rather than being egoistic and rude as they are in a 5 star property.

This place scores more in ambience than food. Visit
 on a rainy evening and enjoy the rain pouring on the massive glass panes. The food is 5star so is the people serving you. You can find great deal in Groupon (now Nearbuy) Dinner buffet for 999/- only. That deal is fantastic, try out the deserts, I have been there multiple times and every time the buffet menu was new and the deserts were better Everytime..  don't miss the mishtidoiüòâüòâ.

If you want to have a high class culinary experience you can visit here...you may lost while choosing which one to start from..though i found there should be more varieties in main course section it wont disappoint you..and the best part of this restrurants is the desserts..you will find a huge variety of eye and tongue candy desserts to choose from..also the drinks combo is also somewhat affordable..

Went there armed with the Nearbuy coupons whereby they were offering lunch and dinner buffets on selected days for half the usual price.

The location of the caf√© was great and the d√©cor stunning. Now coming to the food. Buffets are generally hit and miss affairs and this one was no exception. Thankfully there were a lot more hits than misses. A wide selection of fresh, good quality ingredients like roasted bell peppers, boiled sweet corn, chicken etc. allowed us to prepare some nice salads with provided a nice start to our meal. The main course was mostly a combination of Indian and Italian dishes, which I was expecting, given that the two speciality restaurants at Hyatt offer Indian and Italian fare. While there were biryani, kebab, fish etc as part of the Indian selection, a live counter offered Pizza, Pasta etc. made according to one's choice. The items that I tried tasted good, but nothing great. Also I feel the choices were rather limited with no exotic items on the menu (no pork, salmon, tuna, duck). There were only two varieties of sauce on offer for the pasta. One tomato based and one rather bland white sauce. No pesto sauce, no option of adding any meat or seafood to either the pasta or the pizza. The dessert section had pastries, ice cream, Indian sweets. A live counter prepared waffles. Again good tastes. But again nothing great.
¬†
The service was courteous with the servers bringing many dishes to the table. Overall a good buffet serving good food across the board. But sadly there wasn't a single truly stand out dish which forces one to say wow ! One expects a lot more from a place like this. More variety, more exotic items. Otherwise it may not be worth it if one has to pay the full price.

What happens when you want to experience a 5 star culinary experience and reach Waterside cafe in its quest. You are left with a wonderful feeling of satiation and craving for more. The buffet spread is quite widespread, especially the dessert section.
I wish I could start my dinner with the dessert section so that I could sample each and every dessert on display. The waffles and panna cotta were delectable. 
I would have preferred some more variety for the main course though the items available were good and does not leave you with a bloated feeling. 
A nice ambience as expected from a five star is what you get and leaves you with a real feel good experience. But the service was a bit on the slower side. Overall a great experience and would love to go back for more.

Had visited yesterday evening with family and friends to the cafe to celebrate my birthday. And what a perfect evening,  we had there. The hospitality was unmatchable with Mr.Abhijit looking after us. A special birthday cake was also served. 
We had opted for the buffet and the spread was awesome. The Indian food was very good and the pizza was also too good. We had to our heart's content with the desserts to end and enjoyed the evening to the best.

The spread is good, the seating and service is excellent just as you would expect from a 5 star, but the food quality is for the health freaks and not for foodies. I mean a simple chicken sweet corn soup was very bland and far away from the authentic Chinese that we are so used to in kolkata. The noodles were nothing great either.

Ambience is at its best.. people over there were nice and it's a perfect place to take someone who matters a lot in your life.

We planned for the buffet, but I was slightly disappointed by the food. It could have been much better, and there are other places like Barbeque Nation, who actually provides better buffet menu.

Overall experience was good and staff were cooperative  and friendly.

My timeless romance with food brought me to The Waterside Caf√© one fine Sunday morning. For a change, my extra weekend sleep ceased to matter and I dressed up to experience the wondrous food at the caf√©. Since we arrived a little early, we found a place next to the glass windows overlooking the garden. Let‚Äôs just say that the fine interiors of this elegant restaurant and the view outside were almost as good as the food.
                                                                ...

When it comes to disappointment there are many kinds of food served in restaurants...  like not up to the mark food, overpriced food, too much oil & spice but still something is missing food, dull food etc... & then there is bad food... just bad... that is the specialty of Hyatt... they just never disappoints you when it comes to bad food.... lumpy salty almost cold soup, overcooked chicken with under cooked vegetables, under cooked pasta...  everything garnished with coriander, cheesecake that tastes like glue .... you just name it! they are the best when it comes to worst food.

Being a fish lover, I ordered for Fish N Chips & Grilled Bhetki while my friend ordered for Chicken Tikka. The portions were good enough for 4 people. We shared all the dishes and were too full to order any main course, so we settled for chocolate brownie with hot chocolate sauce. Now to share the dish ratings: Fish N Chips & Chicken tikka were good, however, Grilled Bhetki was too bland for an Indian taste bud while the hot chocolate for the brownie was cold. Overall a good place with a decent view of the hotel surroundings.

There is something so serene and captivating about this place- the huge glass windows overlooking a beautiful lawn, lined by miniature gurgling fountains, the indoor ornamental plants, the spacious buffet counter and soft instrumentals playing in the background that set the perfect mood for a hearty meal. We opted for the lunch buffet which was Rs.1550 per head, a bit costly but every bit worth it. There was a varitey of dishes lined up for us both from indian and continental cuisines, though there weren't much choices in the continental section. There was a fish preparation that we really enjoyed along with cajun spiced beef... there are few places in kolkata that can cook their beef so well. Also there were the usuals- chicken biriyani, chicken kebabs,mutton curry, papad and some kind of potato vindaloo. But what really caught our attention was the dessert section- such variety and a treat for the eyes and our tastebuds alike. Among them, I thought that the caramel custard cake was the best, it was so soft and tasty..we savoured every bite. We stuffed our plates with pastries, payesh, malpoa, chocolate mousse, ice cream..what not..and by the end of the meal, we were in a food coma! Loved the behavior of the staff and the overall experience, another visit is surely on the cards!!

However wish to have some more starters using prawns..though they have a live counter to please you with your wishes.¬†
The ambiance is nice with large windows just beside the lush green lawns and fountains.¬†
The music, the staffs, the food make me wanna visit once again..

Waterside¬†Cafe¬†in¬†Kolkata¬†is the perfect answer to your midnight craving for a cup of coffee topped with cream... A high-end cafe situated inside Hyatt Regency,,, this 24-hour-open cafe has been attracting people from all across the city... This stylish nd spacious cafe is aesthetically decorated with light shades of blue and white on the walls... High ceilings,,, relaxed sofas nd classy seating are the main USPs of this cafe that also offers grand views of the atrium, fountain and pool outside.... The regular western and Indian menu here might seem a little repetitive,,, but the taste will definitely not disappoint you‚Äîwhether it is the¬†club sandwich, freshly baked pizza or chicken tikka,,, you will simply love the taste..... Try desserts like strawberry savarin nd chocolate banana cake,,, without which your meal would be incomplete... Be it¬†breakfast¬†, lunch or dinner, Waterside Cafe offers an interesting¬†food¬†spread that is quite popular amongst the foodies in Kolkata....

But thats not ALL we expect from a restaurant! 

The food was below average.. I mean chefs at Hyatt! They are meant to cook better than the rest.. But the taste of food at any Indian restaurant is far better than this place! If you are going for a status fine.. But if u are going for food.. Guys trust me there hell lot of other places to go!
Buffet menu does not have a wide spread.. The desserts were the only place to compliment (pics attached)

So quite an amount of disappointment!

This is the first time I'm giving 5 to any restaurant. This is actually an amazing place to spend your time. Huge space, big windows entering maximum sunlight. First impression is beyond amazing. We went for buffet. The buffet had wide range of food. Starters had phuchka, chaats, tikki, pakodas. Main course, Indian section served biriyani in small mud haandis, murg musallam, amritsari fish, chicken kebabs, wide range of salads. Caribbean style chicken. Fish, pork and lot more. Sushi, sea food salad even the veg section comprised great amount of food. Desert section was the best. You're visiting a 7 star restaurant food quality and quantity both are expected to be awesome however, what i loved the most was the customer Service which was above 5. We had some issues with our cards and the manager said "if you have any issue please come back tomorrow and settle the account no worries ". If you're in hospitality industry this is the least customers expect and Hyatt topped it. They didn't charge for the Birthday cake. I really appreciate everything you guys did for us today. Thank you !

To start with, it is an ideal place to go for a date, or even just a relaxing evening. 
Every time you're personally escorted to your table by the staff !!
They also let you settle down comfortably before coming to take your order. The view to the pool is amazing. You get mesmerized by the soft music played over there.
They have a moderately sized buffet menu but the taste of the food compromises for every thing.
Do visit for a remembering experience !

I was here for the lunch buffet , It's really good and had a great experience. The ambience is too good, well decorated and a five star in real seance. Lets come to the food, there were so many items on the buffet lunch menu that its really not possible for one to taste all the items. The quality of the foods and its taste are really great. The desert counter is superb. And last but not the least the hospitality is worth remarkable. Hope to visit again...

We were here for lunch buffet on my wife's birthday. Ambiance was great as ecpected. We liked the view and dessert very much. Great experiance overall. Very spacious and neatly decorated.
Only dissapointment was not having any crab dish. 
Its my suggestion to include more variety of fish.
Surely its a place to visit many times.

At Sunday night Buffet last night. Shamefully limited choice for a 5 Star Buffet. Hardly any hors d'oeuvre. NO!!! selection of salads. No shrimp no fish. No cold cuts. Two chicken dishes both Indian yuck!! mutton biryani. indian again. One edible beef dish.. hardly any sides. The pizza was good.
For the ¬†pasta they didnot even have the Pesto Sauce.. Pathetic!!
Very poor selection of desserts. Waffle w/ chocolate good.
When ones goes to a 5 star ( is it one?!!) I expect an international selection. Not Indian and then some more Indian .Hyatt ¬†Buffet sucks!!
It should rename it as an Indian boring spread.

But as their food quality is good and keeping in mind the posh ambience they offer it's a place you might wanna go again and again.

Visited this place for their buffet lunch. The non vegetarian options were not only limited but also not that impressive. The menu selection wasn't upto the mark and flavors not so great.  Had the weirdest chicken satay ever!  Such a disappointment. ..A live pizza or pasta counter would've upped the menu selection. Coming to desserts, the live waffle counter was quite good. The array of pastries looked more appealing than what they tasted. Would've expected a lot better.

Well its Hyatt. You can't ask for a better ambience than this I presume. So I wouldn't waste much effort in the ambience and hygiene. They top that in every aspect. Extra 0.5 on that.
Now coming to the food. The buffet starts with cold salads of veggies and chicken and fish. That's really refreshing. The soup and the breads are amazing. Starters continue with chicken malai tikka kebab, fish kebab and both are mouth watering. Biriyani, chicken curry and beef stew will send you in a trance. The freshly made pasta and pizzas were spectacular. And finally the desserts. There were too many items to name only. But it was great and the experience was too good to portray in words...

Well I visited this place with a friend for buffet lunch! It was a deal from nearbuy! The Paneer tikka was good! Garlic bread was nice too! There was no live counter of pizza and pasta which disappointed us a lot! The main course was not so good either! The only thing which I found nice about this place was the ambience and hospitality! It's only on the glamorous end, not much on the taste end!

that quality is enough in such a price as we are in discount offer mainly in the case of soft drinks , when i was asking him what kind of soft drinks are available here ( one waiter), His manner was not good. secondly ¬†wash room was not so cleaned.

Hyatt.... D name is enough !!! Yesterday went there to celebrate my birthday. We made a reservation one day earlier and we opted for d buffet lunch. D ambience was grande. D sitting arrangement was beyond exotic. D buffet spread was lavish. I found there salad bar a bit stale though.d main course was awesome specially d chicken biriyani,chicken malai kebabs and pork chops. I m a strict Non vegetarian .so I did not opt for any vegetarian dishes. Bt what made me " go gaga" over d buffet is d pastries from " THE BAKERY". Each pastry is like a masterpiece creation though my fav was d rosemary pastry. I loved their mango pastry and white forest pastry as well. Definitely coming back soon..

A sophisticated restaurant with a peaceful ambience located at Saltlake, sector 3. We were escorted to our booked table. Food is great no doubt. They serve different kind of salads and starters. But i was disappointed with the main course. Service is quite well. But i was expecting a 'welcome complimentary drink'. I can die for the dessert items they served. Coffee ice cream and chocolate mud pie gives a kick end to our dine. All over experience is good but Hyatt is a brand name so expectation was more

A sophisticated place with an overpriced menu. Food is tasty no doubt but I believe its priced a bit high but then its Hayatt so its expected. I had buffet which had a huge variety of foods. Everything was tasty but I found the baked fish to be pathetic. Naan and chicken reshmi was just too good. Deserts had a quite a number of varieties. I found the mud cake to be the best specially when it was served warm. Mango ice cream was the best among all the flavors but the add ons were not  upto the mark. Overall its a nice place for foodies and ambience lovers.

My most visited coffee shop amongst all five star hotels I've visited anywhere.

It's also uncanny that I invariably land up here around 11.30 pm which qualifies me to have their dinner buffet and also their midnight buffet at times.

The real beauty of this place with huge glazings overlooking the manicured lawns and water bodies can be in the afternoon.

The buffets are just about adequate and purely on quality and taste I would rate the ITC Sonar higher.I have also found the food here to be inconsistent at times.

The revelation is the dessert section which is awesome to say the least and the coffee is pretty awesome as well.

But this serves as an important meeting point post late movies at City centre and helps in catching up with friends from Salt Lake.

For that alone,the visit is worth it.

I simply love the buffet spread here. Especially the dessert section, it‚Äôs awesome! But if you have opted for a buffet here and want to order a pizza do not expect the relatively larger variety of toppings that you can chose from at The Hub in Taj Bengal. Here you would have to choose between chicken or veg pizza. And do not be taken aback if the server gives you a blank look if you request to add some jalapenos or sun dried tomatoes to your pizza. That‚Äôs what they did to me. But the spread here is no doubt better than another some other five star coffee shops like The Bridge in Park Hotel. Apart from the lack of variety in pizza the food served at the buffet is worth repeat visits.¬†
I was impressed with the live waffle counter and the array of toppings on offer to go with it....
The ambiance too is very good. This is the place you should head for a lazy winter afternoon lunch or to stare at the rain outside and dig into some awesome food.

This is probably a rare review on ala-carte in waterside cafe.
It was my 7th anniversary. An important one in our lifetime isnt it? We choose ala-carte as we couldnt hop on anything and everything on the buffet that was on offer. 
Beside ambience, seating, lighting and other stuff that are classy, well known and famous for, food earned a mixed reaction.
My grilled scottish salmon was 5/5. Nothing more to say...
My wife's choice of chicken (rosemary chicken) wasn't that great 2.5/5
We also tried chicken tikka which was extremely and inhumanly spicy. 2/5
Ordered a wine by glass. I was told after about 10 mins that the particular wine bottle is not available and will take some time to arrive. Had to change my choice of wine ultimately. Wine earned 3.5/5
And one more thing..... my dining plate was removed from the table soon after a quick question-by-gesture "may I remove your plate sir?" It happened so quick that I dint even get a second to nod my head, forget responding with words!!!!! Service earned a 3/5 which got ruined with that thing happening. 
I was on ala-carte not on buffet...remember?

This is one of the best luxury lunch buffet experiences in Kolkata. The ambience and the service is truly at par with a 5-star hotel. There are a wide varieties of choices for starters and main courses including middle eastern options such as pita bread, hummus, baklava along with Italian delicacies such as penne arrabbiata and more. The food is delicious and well-cooked. The dessert options are also numerous, specifically the Tiramisu tasted perfect.

Definitely an experience worth having, albeit at a higher cost.

Am a regular visitor to this restaurant, and I normally opt for the buffet. Each time the experience has been fantastic. The decor, the ambience,, the service, the spread, the taste, texture everything is simply great, and above all the hospitality and the warmth of the staff. They make you feel like royalty!!! Nothing to complain whatsoever about the starters, the main course or the desserts. But I wish there were macarons on the dessert counter. The fare on the Indian sweets counter however rather lacklustre, the only downside that I can think of.

A place which lives up to its fame and a place which needs no introduction..Finally got a chance to tick one more name in my wishlist with their Sumtuous Lunch Buffet.. This cafe is located at the ground floor and u have to take the downward steps from the main looby..The ambiance is simply Classy and Royal to say the least..a perfect setup to enjoy the serenity of the place while gorging on some elaborate menus.. The seats are indeed very comfy and cosy and the view outside the big glass wall was quite soothing as well..Tall coconut trees and beautiful fountains makes it a delightful sight..Coming to the service though the servers were quite well behaved and efficient in taking the leads I felt they were a bit indifferent in their approach and had to call repeatedly for some requests..Also they didnt bother to clear our Mains plate while we headed for Deserts..
Coming to the spread, well it was truly Extensive but I felt they lag a bit on the Non-Veg options..In the Salad section the CHICKEN SALAD and FISH ROULADE SALAD was truly awesome and appetising as well..Loved the concept of slicing a roulade into pieces and serving it in cold section with few sprinkles of herbs..Also among the Veg section we sampled CARROT TARTORE a twist with the good old mayonnaise and it was truly awesome..Infact we sampled the salads multiple times..Also there was Mezze section serving PITA, HUMMUS, BABAGANOUSH and FALAFEL..
The starters section was minimal with CHICKEN TIKKA and BABRI ALOO..Among them Chicken Tikka was cold and rubbery while Babri Aloo tasted truly delicious..
We then headed towards the Live Counter where they were serving PIZZA, BEEF SATAY, CHICKEN SATAY, EGG BHURJI..The Chicken was under-ccoked and tasted smelly,we had to waste more than half of it..Beef tasted better but lacked proper seasoning..Egg Bhurji was good as usual..didn't sample the Pizza..
The mains consists of 4 Non-veg options and about 9 Veg dishes..MURGH BIRIYANI, FISH MASALA, CHICKEN THAI GREEN CURRY and FISH IN HOT GARLIC SAUCE..Amongst them the Biriyani was indifferent lacking in flavours, both the Fish dishes were well balanced and tasted authentic, so too is the Chicken dish with a subtle touch of lemongrass..In the Veg we sampled ROSEMARY GRILLED VEGGIES which being a hardcore non-veggie I can't help but have two servings..it was delightful, something which doesn't attack your taste buds but packed with flavours..Also tasted GLASS NOODLES, BENGALI DUM ALOO, DAL MAKHNI and PANEER PASINDA..Nothing much to vouch as all these dishes tasted pretty ordinary and failed to justify a 5-star setup..
The Deserts section was truly a life-saver for us,simply awesome after a mixed experience so far..We had ROSOGOLLA, MISHTI DOI, SONDESH, LADDU, UMALI, CHOCOLATE MUD PIE, TIRAMISU, DARK CHOCOLATE CAKE, PESTA FLAVOURED CAKE, FRUIT SALAD with WHIPPED CREAM and Live ICE CREAM counter with various toppings..Among them only dissappointment was the fruit salad with whipped cream..Umali was the highlight of the desert section, a creamy,milk based pudding kind of dish from middle east..
Overall it was an extensive affair and the quality was good, only concern was the taste and lack of flavours in some of the dishes..A one time experience is jsutified given the grandeur and ambiance..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 5/5

Hi to all. Visited the place 4 buffet dinner. The ambience & food was good but the main course lacked variety. The starters had variety of salads while desserts were plenty but the main course lets it down. It only had chicken biriyani, a mutton item, tandoori chicken and 1 fish item. Lastly, felt price was a bit higher compared to variety.

Hyatt Regency..  delivers a lot on its Brand Value , but fails to perform. I visited Hyatt - Waterside Cafe along with my family to celebrate my birthday. 

1. I will give an lower average rating to the ambiance as it is not that appealing

2. Food choices - specially Buffet was moderate - not good or not bad.

3. By looking at the Buffet menu I opted for A -la -carte option , but that was merely a disaster. I never excepted such a poor quality of food to be served at Hyatt.

4. Food presentation and food service is Bad - I give the rating bad because it deserves it.

5. The staff was not not prompt in serving and after an order we required to wait for almost 20-25 minutes a a number of follow ups to get the average rated and high costly food.

I wanted to give a rating less than 1 , but the system doesn't have the rating.

I am really disappointed..

The place promises a lot but fails to deliver.. Went two consecutive times once for their buffet at the cafe and once for their poolside bbq buffet.

The poolside set up with live music is good in winters but that's where it stops..

Staff is not very helpful.. If you are a vegetarian and there are not many options they are not polite enough to help and get you u something special which is generally a case at most other places..

Food is very very average in compared to their specialized restaurant quality.. Be it Italian or Indian food is not as good as it is served in the restaurant.. 

Vegetarian options for main course is always limited.. For people who like to drink probably it's a good choice but not otherwise..

Also the staff is not prompt and very very slow to do the little things that's expected in a buffet set up..

Visited the Waterside cafe- Hyatt regency along with my friends, in honour to celebrate my friend's bday!! Well the ambience is great!! Variety of food items available in the buffet, starting from indian to international. After tasting the starters and main course, my most favourite part was the dessert.  Tried a coffee flavoured ice cream along with choco chips, which was yum yum!! The service was also good!! Thumps up for it! üòä

Waterside Cafe, is located inside Hyatt Regency. I've been there about a couple of times with my family, and each visit proved to be quite amazing. valet parking makes it completely hassle free. to start with, the ambiance of this place is fantastic. interiors are damn good, and the staffs are very friendly and attentive. seating arrangements are amazing, with a view of the swimming pool outside. the food here is great, especially the deserts. must try their blueberry cheese cake and the Sunday Brunch. lastly, if you are keen on spending for luxury, this is the perfect place for you. :)

This be my all time favourite Luxury Restuarant
To review on - Breakfast : One of the bests till date -
The wide spread serves you almost every cuisine you would want .
The breads - soft yet with perfect crisp , awesome Danish breads and pastries , the creamy mushrooms and crisped up hash browns - with scotch eggs - or you cold even try their Fluffy Cheesy Omelettes . The South Indian Dosas , Parathas ( although haven't tried ; heard they were equally good)
Lastly , the health counter packed with granolas of all kinds . And , freshly cut fruits with cream or yogurt .
---------------
Lunch - Again , a huge range in the buffet to choose from , The fresh salads - loved the spinach , tomato one and loved their hummus .
Coming to the main course - Biriyani , just awesome . And the Kali Dal - to die for . Apart , from that - The vegetarian array is superb - starting from the aluu matar , the vegetable chops , and the matar paneer .... Very sumptuous .
Desserts - I keep saying this - my favourite and hyatt just makes it the best for me - I can vouch : Their Strawberry Icecream is the best - and equally live up to their name for any other sweet dish too - the perfectly caramalised Pudding and The Warm bubbly Chocolate fudge and not to forget the nutty tart and the soft cheesecakes - it can make my day
-------
Dinner - Almost the same experience

Ambience - needless ; its good , Decked up beautifully .
Worth the pocket pinch .
I am so coming again .

The best thing about this place is it's ambience they provide is awesome and classic and the food was just okay types not so worth it and in the buffet there was no starters and the items over in the main course was less and there was no chicken or mutton item in main course, it was not expected from a five star rating buffet lunch.

One sunny morning long ago,  me and a friend dropped in at this place and tried a thing or two. The ambience was brilliant and since there was a wedding preparation going on outside, the whole place was done up beautifully in marigold flowers. It looked exquisite and nothing less than royalty! 
We ordered one salad each- both Greek and Caesar along with Pizza Bolognaise and Pink lemonade. We ended up ordering a chicken sandwich as well. The salads were really good- light and fresh with the perfect balance of crunchy vegetables and the bacons. The dressing wasn't overwhelming and complemented the salad instead of overpowering it. Maybe a bit more feta wouldn't have hurt :) 
The Pizza was nice and wasn't something really out of the world. I didn't like the sandwich much and found them a bit dry. The Pink lemonade was okay, it was a bit light though since I like mine with a bit of punch. 
The Waterside Caf√© doesn't really have much to offer in terms of food,  but it's a great place to have a lazy, idyllic brunch with a friend and admire the birds and the small pool outside.

So we went for a late night bite. We had ordered a spaghetti auglio olio which was divine as it reminded me of the dish I have at my all time favorite Italian restaurant. Their desserts were sublime and I would recommend the blueberry cheesecake. Though the cream was a little short of greatness the blueberry on top made up for that. The brownie is a worth a try if you have a sweet tooth.

Have been quite regular but it was a horrible experience today. Just didn't seem I am at a 5 star. The food was not refilled for the buffet on time. The lady serving my husband the beer dropped the drink on my plate, table & floor and had no courtesy to apologize. She was not even getting the table wiped inspite of serveral calls. The bread served was hard. Absolutely unexpected service. would not want to come back here at all!

yes no yes...after an inner duel choosing between hub,taj or cafe swiss - one evening,during my Kolkata visit we happened to drive in for an early evening supper.
Wanted to try this ,as it seemed rather quiet,spacious and ... cosy.The seating is quite uncluttered and gives you a sense of personal space around you. Saurav,our host for the evening was very pleasant.We ordered a corn soup,pepperoni pizza and spaghetti bolognese . The soup as per my mother,was lip smacking but extremely low in qty...the pizza,almost perfect and the bolognese minced meat - a big proportion and very fulfilling to the taste buds... !A silly mistake though - on asking for ice&water, instead of serving me ice cubes and water,i was served chilled water. Fahrid our host 2 kept an eye every time we were about to clear our plates and came over without even calling to serve us some more portions .

All in all the service and food and ambiance..all gelled pretty well...!

Well no matter what you can say about Hyatt gonna fall short of words. 
Valet parking is available. As soon as you enter, you are gonna be escorted by extreme well behaved, friendly and humble staffs. Waterside Cafe deserves a special mention due to its vast sitting arrangements and its view. Buffet menu is awesome. Starting from starters to desserts, all have wideeeeeeeeee range to offer. Save space in your tummy for some awesome range of desserts at the last. Ambience is very relaxing. Not too pricey. A must visit for a luxury dining.

I had gone there with my family for a weekday lunch buffet. To start off, the dining area is really beautiful. It opens out onto the lush green lawns and huge glass windows which lights up the whole area. Coming to the starters, there were a really lot of options n quite nice too. But i was a whole lot disappointed with the mains. The biriyani was not well cooked and the meat was very hard to find cause there were almost none. A pabda maacher jhol, which was not looking too good, n a beef roulette not so well cooked, apart from these chicken kababs which were like the only good thing in the mains. A live counter serving hot paranthas with egg curry which were delicious. In the desserts, a lot lot of options were present n just too awesome.

Honestly, waterside cafe is a place you should go for the ambiance and nothing else. The food is excessively over priced, and the quantity, well lets not even get there. For 850 bucks,a small bit of steak makes no sense at all. And on the taste bit, well thats pretty much a dissapointment too. Now there would be stuffs like, well dude you went to hyatt, did you expect low priced stuff, well to that, no i did not expect low priced stuff, but what i expect is value for money. I have travelled the country, went to places like the Westin, Novotel in Hyderabad, O at Pune etc, and the food though was expensive but the quality and quantity did cover up for it. Maybe i might drop in there next time for the ambiance, but definitely not for the money !!

Hyatt Waterside cafe, you need to take your game a notch higher !!

Cheers !! Happy Munchin :)

Waterside Cafe located inside the fancy Hyatt Regency Hotel has an amazing  view of the outside garden. 
On a rainy day you can easily get transported to another world altogether, the view is really nice through the huge glass windows. The seating is comfortable and the ambience quite pleasant ( at least most of the time), well during weekends it gets a little crowded because people like to bring in their family and family consists of screaming kids who like to run and hover around your table but apart from that minor glitch it's pretty nice. I have been to waterside cafe innumerable times but have hardly tried their buffet because I generally like to avoid huge crowd who chatter and shout at the top of their lungs while talking to the person just sitting next to them! 
Staff is attentive and courteous and goes that extra mile which is rare in some of the fancy places in the city. 
Some of my favourites dishes and drinks are of course their super creamy and super delicious cold coffee, garlic bread and the - must be mentioned Aglio Olio Pasta. 
Their garlic bread is baked from scratch, it's fresh, soft and served piping hot and the pasta is just perfect with right portions of chilli flakes and olive oil, it's a treat for sure. 
I keep coming back here from time to time and more or less my preferences remains the same. Their French fries are nice and crispy too! 
The options for desserts are just too many but blueberry cheesecake is surely a must try dessert out here! 
Waterside cafe has been serving some good food for quite some time and you can't go wrong with this place!

the view of the grand poolside & the relaxing ambiance is what you get from this 5 star coffee shop, indeed a luxury indulgence 

been there for buffet & also couple of times for late night eating ( being close to my place @ salt lake) & every time the experience was worth taking back...... their service, courtesies, food, ambiance, light music...all are placed just the way you expect things to be in a 5 star. 

Their buffet is as grand as Hyatt's stature with extensive spread all around, I mean at least 20 types of only salads were on offering & special mention goes to the dessert section... it was just damn confusing.. which to leave and which one to go for..... I rather took the best way out, "leaving none"

Went there last week for a client dinner.  It was my first visit. We were greeted and directed towards our reserved table. We could view the pool from there. The ambiance was relaxing. The buffet spread was pretty big. There were some nice salads and I loved  the fish salad. The person in the counter made us a nice spicy chanachur mix. Wasn't expecting such a dish in a 5 star üòâ. In the main section I tried the Hilsa, some chicken kebab and pork chop. The chop was the pick of the show. It was amazing. Next stop was dessert and the choices wet mouth watering. I tried the blueberry cheesecake and another dish made from passion fruit. Both of them were delicious. While returning I bought a couple of red velvet cakes for my wife and mom. They were delicious as well. Next time will come with a group and have some drink from the bar. 
Special mention to the service. Each and every person from staff made us special and their efficiency is truly five star.

Alert, 50% discount on buffet for August Fridays Lunch time
I visited here along with friends last Friday, it was a visit almost after 11 years which was back in 2004. The place has not changed much is looks more or less the same as far as my memory goes. We accidentally came across the 50% discount offer for August only during Fridays over Lunch Buffet which originally costs INR 1550 + tax. The restaurant is on the ground floor of the Hyatt Regency hotel which is one level down from the entrance. The interior is aptly decorated with the water theme nicely coming out by the water flow on the sides with a view of the green garden outside which when I came earlier in 2004 probably had some fountains which I did not see this time. 

Coming to the food, the options as usual are huge in the price range (assuming the discount of course) for appetizers and desserts although they do not have starters in tandoors (except one item that came along main course) or similar fried stuffs. The appetizer collection is otherwise huge with variety of salads, soups both veg and non-veg. I personally liked the baked fish salad and the chicken salad along with the toasted breads with olive oil and cottage cheese. There was also dahi vada and chats that I remembers and the chats were served on table. If you could have patience and wait, Burgers and Sandwiches are also made for you and served on your table.

The main course was a bit disappointment with limited options in Chinese I found only noodles but nothing significant Chinese sides to accompany it. There was of course beef, a certain type of chicken tandoor and prawn curry. However the refills were not that fast and in peak hour when there was a queue of people in front of the buffet, the maximum waiting time was for the prawn refills to arrive. There was also wide variety of chutneys, pickles and papad, especially the garlic and red chilly pickles, too good preparations. 

Finally the dessert section was another delight and something I have not seen elsewhere. You can get lost in options with 3 varieties fo ice-creams with 6 types of garnish / toppings that you can add. Add to that chocolate pastry and creamy moose. There is also an option to prepare wafers with toppings of your choice. It is definitely awesome but I recommend have it without the white cream since it makes the wafers soft and takes the munch part away, a must try option. There were also another section for cookies that I was too full to try.

One turn off is of course any soft drinks not being part of the package and you would have to order separately ala-carte and they vary in ranges of 325 and 600 / 700 exclusive of tax. We did order two fresh limes and to let you know they were huge in size and good too, they gave the sweet syrup separately to add per your taste. 

The overall service and the responsiveness of the majority of the crew is good. Overall a recommended try especially if you are going to avail the 50% discount and know what to expect and what not to expect.

I would say one of the most romantic restaurants around. This is located at the ground floor of¬† Hyatt. I had the buffet dinner out there, the spread looked fantastic and I had pretty high expectations after looking at the spread. To start off had the tomato basil soup which was kind of OK to me.

From the tandoors had, tandoori chicken which was nice, the rajasthani dal tasted really nice. Butter chicken and rice and mutton rogan josh were also tasty but truly did not kept up to my expectations. 

The desert spread was lovely, the brownies and cakes were simply awesome.

Have been a member of Hyatt since 2005. The seating area is dimly lit with floating candles on each table, in the evenings. Soft and melodious tunes which are soothing to the ear play in the background, the sounds of the beautiful ¬†sparkling fountains and birds playing and splashing water on each other in the pond to the side of the seating area add to the romantic and peaceful environment of this place. One should try out their Sunday brunch.¬†Now coming to the food- They have a lavish buffet spread including Kebabs, Pizzas, Pastas, Beef Burgers, Roasted Chicken with sauteed vegetables, Smileys, Grilled Fish, Chicken Lasagne, Gosht Biriyani , Mutton, Prawn. Then there were Baked Rasogollas, Mishti Doi, Gulab Jamun, Fresh fruits, Assorted pastries and mousse, Brownie, Waffles with the Ice Cream of your choice. Apart from this they have an unlimited alcohol section included within the buffet. The price per person is around 2,100 plus tax. It's totally worth it..I'll keep visiting again and again. Thank You Hyatt for such a warm and pleasant hospitality!!

Even though the place wasn't full of ppl still the staffs were negligent & were busy giving importance to other Guests which I felt were Staying with them. So basicaly if ur expecting a good service here u betr chceck-in to the hotel before visiting this place.

I was here for a buffet dinner last week on a Friday night- pretty okayish I'd say.  The spread was limited - the food was normal nothing really extra ordinary. The deserts being deserts were good. So I mostly had this for dinner.

I had planned to take my fiance here for his birthday lunch since my experience was good when i had visited Gucchi, but sorry to say the staff were more bothered about the in house guests and paid least attention to us. The buffet was very also limited (variety wise) and what i had in mind was totally ruined. Not a good experience! Being an employee of The Oberoi Group I know that guest satisfaction is a mandate. Disappointed!

There is hardly¬† any variety on mutton and fish sections, only Keema Kaleeji. It is recommended to improve the mutton and fish dishes and varieties. Sweets were great. If they have to compete with the likes of Flame & Grill and Barbeque Nations, they need to work hard.

The buffet diner is really good and they have an enormous variety of national and international dishes. The dessert options were quite good too. They could introduce some complimentary drinks with the buffet. Maybe some soft drinks or mocktail. It would be amazing.

I have eaten at the Waterside Cafe at least four times and always with my family. The ambience is great and so is the service. For the uninitiated I recommend heartily the buffet option since otherwise the options are limited. In the buffet, one can take their pick from a variety of meats, Indian dishes and fresh sweets. One can try the Pork chops and I can especially recommend the hot ¬†and fresh Gulab Jamuns.

The ambience and the dinner buffet is outstanding. Kebabs and desserts are superb and so are their cost . One of the best experiences of mine.

We had the dinner buffet, the spread initially seemed too wide, quality wise fresh but however individually taste wise nothing was remarkable except few. The service really scores high.. we were introduced to the buffet section and the staff explained us each section which was very welcoming. We started off with Tomato basil soup, Chicken noodle soup, Chicken salad, Fish salad, Tomato mascarpone salad and few other veg salads.
Clearly...tomato soup was one of the best we had and was an umcompared winner to its nonveg counterpart. I found nothing interesting among the salads which were very sub average.
They had a mezze counter comprising hummus, baba ganaush, pita bread, falafel etc.
The starters had one nonveg Chicken tikka with green chutney. Among the veg starters i had was Hare paneer tikka. Both were nice.
The indian maincourses had
Chicken biryani, Shahi polao (veg), Dal, Lamb rogan josh, Fried root vegetables and Shahi paneer to name some of the veg dishes i sampled.
Now, the DAL was top notch. Lamb curry was watery which spoiled the richness when it was refilled for the second time.. but the meat was very soft. Biryani was decent.
The international section had Fish in lemon sauce, Canneloni And a terderloin dish. Again everything was very ordinary.

Quite bored with maincourses offered we ordered for pints of henikein and Pasta in white sauce and Onion cheese pizza to go with it.
The live pizza pasta counter was a better option out of everything offered. But these cannot be customized. Just the basic sauces of white and red and toppings like cheese and tomato were offered. What wrong did the olives jalapenos mushroom sausages do.. that they werent part of this huge spread. However the baking was perfect with generous amount of cheese.

The dessert section was totally impressive unlike the rest of the buffet. There was a live dessert counter too.
Hot Brownie in chocolate sauce, Apple crumble, Sandesh, Rajbhogh, Payesh, Coconut tart, Chocolate mousse, White forest cake, Mixed fruit pie, Glossy fruit pie, Mango pudding, Mango cake, Blueberry cake, Cookies, Fresh fruit cake were the ones i sampled. Brownie was the one i liked the most.
So here goes my rating :
Service - 5/5
Ambience - 4. 5/5
Food - 3/5 (cooking wise) and 4 /5 (spread wise)

Went to have dinner as we heard that the Buffet spread is pretty decent. Must say that it was pretty sad for the price charged. The only thing which was appealing was the Dessert Counter and the Live Kathi Roll because the Rolls were being made fresh. Who has heard for Muli Ki Sabji on the menu. Further the Chinese selection had Hakka Chow and Manchrian which was kept with the Non Vegeterian dishes amd we had to ask to make fresh as the Non veg smells was very strong. There was no Continetal Dish for the vegetrians. The ambience was Ok, but compared to the Heat and Humidity the AirCon should have been a bit more chilled. The Serice is JUST OK and could be improved. I would not like to go back.

Went for a quick breakfast as walk ins on a weekday and the place was bustling. The location does the trick. The ambience is bright and cheerful. The buffet spread is decent but service is questionable. Not sure I would go back there for the breakfast, though I wouldn't mind trying the Sunday Brunch as its much talked about.

Had visited this plc on one fine weekend.. And i was litrlly amazed by the waterside cafe.. The ambience is perfectly done and it gvs a romantic touch! We opted for a buffet dinner and we were literally amazed gng thru the various counters..there were a LIVE salad counter where u cud mk ur own salad.. Hummus, chicken salad, fish salad, greek salad, bell pepper salad along wid a huge number of dressings.. The salads were worth tryng.. Cuming to the starters thy had chiken tikka, adraki aloo.. Didnt try the adraki aloo since m not too fond of potatoes, however the chicken tikka was lip smacking.. The main course wasnt too great according to me..the chicken biryani wasnt tht grtt however it was tolerable.. The mutton side was average too...the kaali daal along wid paneer was good.. Cumng to the italian section we ordered for a chicken pizza along wid pasta in white sauce.. The pasta was tasty.. But the chicken pizza dissapointed us!! The dessert section was huge as it was widespread.. Mango pudding, chocolate and cherry pudding, chocolate pastry, kala jamun, mudpie, waffles along wid 4 flavours of icecream which included chocolate, mango, coffee and black current.. We opted for mango pudding which was awesum.. The kala jamun was lipsmackin... But the best among the dessert were the mudpie.. Kuddoss to the dessert section!!  
Cumng to the waiters thy were friendly and tym and agn thy kpt on serving water.. Over all my exprnc was good..the only thing tht the managemnt needs to work on is thr main course.!!

INTRODUCTION: Went to this place on a sunny weekday afternoon. We had our reservations in place and were all looking forward to create some wonderful memories over some delectable food at one of the finest dining destinations in town. When you are inside Hyatt surely you will fill the grandiose touch in every element around you and that surely adds loads of oomph to the Waterside Cafe as well which is present at the basement of this property. We were taken to our reserved table and we took our seats, everything visible seemed so perfect. Seats were comfortable, temparature was perfect, remarkable architecture with high ceilings, lovely ambiance with exquisite view outside and definitely with nice people all around. We were then guided to the buffet section where we felt spoilt for choices. One emblematic 5-star buffet spread that will initially leave you lost. 

DINING EXPERIENCE: To start with, they have one extensive salad and cold food section which I just fell in love with! I kept on eating the salads and nearly tried to ignore the mains! In this section I really enjoyed the Green salads, Fish Salad, Chicken salad, hummus, olives and broccolis, American sweet corn, breads, nachos, etc. Out of these, the fish salad was a star item, the fish was all covered in herbs and served with berries that made it one awesome dish! Rest of the salads were worth trying and gives you all the fresh energy and motivation to move on to the mains. The mains according to me was not that great, definitely much lower than my expectations. The grilled pork chop was extremely hard and we could not take more than 2-3 bites of it. I really hate wasting food but in this case I had no other option since it was simply unpalatable. So was the noodles, it was too dry and fried for my liking. The gosht biriyani was not really tasty and it even had salt in lower proportion. The mutton side was again very average to go with the biriyani. Even the chicken kebabs were dry and not at all tender. Saying so, I liked the Paneer pasinda and Dal makhni, they were nice and much better when compared to the other mains. But then again, there was one star item in the mains and it's  called 'Poached Fish'. I am not sure of the quantity or net weight of the poached fish which I had devoured that day. It was an amazing dish, very mild and soul-satisfying food. Nothing much left in the mains that deserve special mention. Also at the Live counters we ordered for one chicken pizza and scrambled eggs. Both the items were nice and had good enough quantity. The  dessert section with more than 10-12 options was surely one star attraction of this buffet. Really loved every bit of the Mango Panna Cotta, the rich flavorful ripe mangoes goes great with soft and creamy Panna Cotta. Apart from this the chocolate ice cream was okayish, dark chocolate pastry was nice and the Blueberry mousse was average. Bengali sweet section was lovely though with varients of Sandesh, Rasgulla, Misti Doi. Overall if it's only the food, then I would say it was a mixed bag in terms of quality and taste, or you may term that as one 'highly inconsistent spread' as well.                                               

Here are few Pros and Cons to wrap up the review and focus on some other aspects of dining -

PROS:
- - - - - -
a) Lovely ambiance
b) Huge spread, especially the dessert section was pretty good with several options
c) Comfortable seating 
d) Valet Parking

CONS:
- - - - - -
a) No mocktails were served
b) Extremely poor service - we had to roam around the entire cafe for one single spoon (for having the desserts), they could not provide that and no one was even bothered to help. The used/soiled plates were not cleared/taken away even after repeatative requests and water was never refilled. This should be rectified pretty soon if they really care about their reputation and goodwill. 
c) Several dishes were not upto the mark, specially the grilled pork chop, biriyani, etc. The pork chop was so hard that it was inedible.

GRANULAR RATINGS:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Buffet Spread: 4.5/5
Food Quality: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 2/5
Value for Money: 4/5

MY OVERALL RATING: 3.8 out of 5 (rouned off to 4.0 out of 5.0 for Zomato user rating system).

Cheers!

No one seems to be bothered to serve you at the Hyatt the wait can be long before anyone notices you there leave alone making u feel special. Something about the Hyatt hospitality makes me feel it's so cold out there. The super expensive prices make you feel you're being ripped off for at that price they better treat you like a king and not make you feel like a peasant. The food quality is bad and cold and it's tasteless. Everything taste stale in the buffet and if you complain you get either a blank face or fake concern. Try avoiding this hotel altogether or be prepared for disappointment each time

Have been there for around 4-5 times. Every time we opted for the buffet menu. Once there was a groupon offer too! Their spread is widely ranged. From continental to Indian cuisine to the delicious dishes from the middle east, they have everything. It's a typical five star hotel buffet spread. But I love their live counters. They have a special dessert section for kids too. The dessert spread is the best in Hyatt among all other star hotels in the city. Check upon the groupon website if you have any offers from here, then your buffet price gets reduced by a huge amount. Come here. A must recommendation. Happy Dining! :)

Since its very close to my place, it was soundly ignored by me, although I ate there plenty of times. I went for the buffet lunch with my sister a few days back and ate ourselves into individual food comas. There was way too much food, including over 10 kinds of desserts, plenty of ice cream (with a DIY sundae making thing). Among other things, loved the steak sandwich, the amazing tenderloin, the very soft paneer butter masala, the dal makhni, and the very tasty hummus (which I ate with a lot of olives).¬†

In the dessert zone, i have zero complaints. Refer to photos and my blog for further signs of gluttony.

Have been to this place quite a few times and surprisingly every time I‚Äôve come across different taste and hospitality. Waterside Caf√© is well known for its breakfast menu & dinner buffets but sadly for their dinner buffet the quality and taste of the food is inconsistent. I have been surprised with bland recipes to poor quality meat and bad service at times. But again I have also come across very tasty food and the platter being replenished from time to time. I wouldn't recommend this place however in case you get any promotional offer this place can be a good try which otherwise would be expensive.

There are ways to spend an afternoon & then there is the one spent at The Waterside Cafe...

My parents went there for lunch recently - and gauging by their response - they had a great time - thanks to the superb ambiance - awesome food - layered well with outstanding service.

My heartfelt thanks to Mr Vinay & his staff for making that extra effort in ensuring their customers return happy.

A must visit place - will definitely stop by the next time am in Kolkata.

Ordered a Coke and they brought a little 300ml canned Coke. When I asked for the bill it was 325 rupees! Over $5! And that was before they added the 40 rupee tax. I talked to them but it wasn't a mistake. Those things are 25 rupees in the store. There was no drink menu to warn you.

Have been going to this place ever since it opened. The quality and taste of food is excellent, however, the buffet spread has deteriorated. Previously there were many many more options of cold-cuts, including smoked salmon, three types of chicken, bacon, etc. Desserts continue to remain excellent. The ambience is the best among coffee shops of hotels in this league, mostly because of the view, specially during thr day. Their pork chops and grilled salmon are some of the good itmes on the menu.

Finally.. Hyatt happened to me.. A shiny Monday afternoon and a lavish buffet lunch with my cousin at Waterside Cafe. We were a bit confused as where to go then the manager showed us the way to this beautiful joint at basement and offered a table for two which we booked two days back. And I looked around.. It was WOW.. the beautiful garden and the fountain created an amazing view one side which was visible through the crystal clear glass. Very comfortable large seats with a perfect temperature. Awesome ambiance. Another side had the live kitchen counter and the buffet spread. The buffet included-
American sweet corn
Green salad
Potato salad
Pumpkin hummus
Papri chaat
Dahi vadha
Hot Chicken salad
Fish salad
Nachos
Fajitas
Tacos
Live pizza and pasta
Egg kosha
Jeera rice
Veg fried rice
Dal makhni
Sabj bahar
Paneer pasinda
Palak ka sabji
Veg spring roll
Baked fish
Chicken kebab
Hyderabadi gosht biriyani with hari chatni and raita
Chicken kosha
Grilled beef
Papad
Sandesh
Rasgulla
Blueberry mousse
Mango panna cotta
Dark chocolate pastry
Jack fruit wrapped dessert
Cherry based dessert
I loved all of them except three dishes- fish salad,chicken salad and beef. I didn't have any taste of herbs in it also the fish was undercooked. Rest were amazing. Special mentions are-dal makhni, hummus, chicken kasha,nachos, palak sabji, paneer pasinda and spring roll and all the desserts. I liked the taste of biriyani which was not alike to the regular ones and i loved the sweet taste of fried onion pieces present in it which sometimes were coming while having it. Hummus was a completely different one having a faded taste of mustard sauce. Spring rolls were too crispy. And the show stopper here was the dessert spread, each of them tasted awesome. Service was great and what i loved was that they allowed to change our plates each and every time we were going to take the recipes. They kept an eye on every customer over there so that we didn't need to ask them for anything as they were already there to attend us. Excellent experience and loved it.

On Friday night at Hyatt's poolside we went with Groupon coupon for drinks & snacks. With Black Label as the drinks option along with veg & non veg starters & pizza, it was a real deal for Rs. 999.00 Definitely a place to check out for unlimited drinks & snacks.

The place and the ambience is definitely worth mentioning. I went here on a sunday afternoon and availed their brunch buffet. Well, the options according to me were quite less than what i had expected. ITC pan asian had offered more dishes and more variety. The alcohols with brunch buffet are great. Options on dishes might be less but food quality is undoubtedly of great quality.  Do try out paneer tikka in veg and a special sort of fish kebab which they make. Thats amazing. I defintely did not want to try dosa in hyatt. Among the variety of desserts, i wanted to try their rosogolla, which unfortunately was finished :/ Service is superb and overall i enjoyed being here.

Went to waterside cafe with high hopes after visiting gucchi but all the excitement and expectations were shattered after visiting the place. Went there with family and kiddos last Friday and opted for buffet dinner . firstly the salads were limited and there was hardly any choices for bead display and the cheese was absent from the display which was very unusual in a five star joint. There was pita bread minus the hummus may b I m not used to having it without it. Moving on the veg noodles and curry was OK types. Now coming to the live counters we ordered a veg pasta in a red sauce and asked it spicy and believe me it s the worst pasta I hv experienced in my whole life ordered two pizzas one with veg toppings and one with corn and mushrooms. First pizza arrived with capsicum and lots of broccoli had seen the broccoli as pizza toppings for the first time hopeless the second one came minus mushrooms with corn and olives but was descent. Italian at it worst from the same hotel which houses LA cuchina . now coming to the main course the vegetables were well cooked and descent but the condiments like onions and papads were empty and nobody cared to refill them. Ordered egg bhurjee from the live counter but they forgot to serve it. Didn't bother to savoir the desserts after having such wonderful dinner. All in all this is unacceptable in a five star joint the service was also very poor. Complete waste of money two stars were just for the ambience which was super.

Went there for a dinner buffet...Not worth...ITC,Taj,Oberoi menu is much better than Hyatt...the continental spread was very limited to only 3/4 dishes...the pizza which was made to order was also not upto the mark. Only 2 choices of bread...

Worst part we found hair in one of the salads...

1/2 choice of cheese...and salads were limited to 3-4 choices...

Overall a bad choice....will never ever visit again...

Had to meet a friend quickly in my birthday evening so decided to hit the waterside cafe. Ambience is blissfull and the service was at par with what I expect in a star property. My friend had a cappuccino and he was happy with it.we got a nice basket of complimentary bread to accompany it... I tasted the foccasia and it was nice. We called for a pizza which came after 45 minutes... In between we were informed that our first pizza was burnt so they were remaking it. The pizza was bland tasteless and hardly had any chicken in it. This is the last I could expect from hyatt. Yes it spoilt my birthday evening. We could barely have a peice each and we got the rest packed to give it to someone. We did not have to time to ask for a replacement. Buck up people :)

The Waterside cafe at the Hyatt is another an amazing place to dine in. The interior decoration is fantastic and the staffs are very friendly and well behaved. The sitting arrangement is awesome from where you can get a view of the swimming pool outside. The ambience is romantic and appropriate for a date ;) I visited with my cousins and we ordered masala dosas with several dips which were very tasty and walnut brownies with ice cream which was even tastier. It is expensive though yet you may visit once ,you will love it :)

This is a long delayed review and for the love of god dont know why I didn't write it before
To start with the ambiance and decor somehow is very relaxing and cheerful. The feng shui aspects are easily noticeable. The running water body on the window side and the mood lighting over each table adds to the allure. Do phone ahead for a pool side table. 
Coming to when to go here. We'll I've been here at many varied hours. Their midnight menu is just scrumptious so that u can drop by at late nights be it for a nightcap or a surprise birthday or anniversary. For the family lunch I definitely recommend their Weekend Buffet. The perhead charge is totally worth it. Their menu is has many aspects to please all known Indian tastebuds. Starting from chaats to pizzas & pastas. Continental choices to tandhoori dishes. But don't fill up because it gets better. Their desserts line up is truly star filled. Too delicious tat my mouth is watering just writing about it. Hats of to their pastry chef. 
Best part drinks is included in the buffet charge and unlimited. They have classy choices like black label , kettle one , Gordons, captain Morgan
If u r a wine connoisseur then may I suggest u select from their wine list and not the buffet spread. 
One of the best parts of my last visit was I got a chance to meet the great Zico cause the goa football team was boarding there prior to their match with us

Difficult to give less than 5 here. We went there once there was dry day during Durga Puja and only 5 stars were serving alcohol. Invariably the best complementary bites I have got with the drinks we ordered. Though it made a hole in one of my freinds pocket, it made a mark on my mind. Select buffet.

I still remember when I visited this restaurant, the ambiance and the hospitality offered. It was a great pleasure dining here. The bakery products are a must try and don't shy from asking assistance from any of the restaurant-people. They are most polite and were of great help. Hope to one day visit again.

Almost a year back i visited the cafe. The ambience is great with fountains going alongside. We had lunch buffet,in which the Malaysian chicken was good,but the beef salad and the ham was disappointing.
We also tried out smoked chicken pizza which had a great flavour and a thin crust.
Coming to the deserts,i was quit overwhelmed especially the dark chocolate cake.

Overall a great place to wine n dine.

I have been here many a times. From my personal experiences I would say that this is one of the best Restaurants  I have ever sat and had lunch in specially in an environment by the pool specially grilled Chicken Malai kebab and The Pizzas  and the dressed Pasta Or rather the Mac and Cheese that they served us were really awesome and finger licking good. I enjoyed their desserts as well!!  Good Food served by trained staff at a really economic and affordable price...  I would suggest that food lovers or rather foodies who haven't been here yet... Please go and give a try to the food here!!  I bet you will love it there!!

Stayed at the Hyatt for couple of nights and unfortunately could just have breakfast at the watwrside cafe both days. 
One of the best hotels where the breakfast is so well laid out and with so much variety. 
No reason why it is always buzzing and pack not just by resident guests but locals too. 
The service a excellent and all the worth. You could ask for anything and the staff will go out of the way to serve you with a smiling face always 
The South Indian or be it North Indian or continental every dish is tasty and you will love to have a great start to the day. 
The healthy conscious section too is very good. The bakery offers lot of options just incase you wanted to some great cakes or doughnuts . 
Overall it's a great place to have a brunch or breakfast

The breakfast buffet at Hyatt is something I take once in every 2 months, for a change, for pampering myself.

The ambience and view is beautiful and so is the food :)

Compared to the standards of Hyatt,I am disappointed with certain things at the buffet.
I always thought it will improve the next time, but I decided to write after 3 of my experiences.
* the hot milk is never really "hot"
*the south Indian meal (idli and vada, which are pre cooked) are always cold and dry.
*the bread loafs aren't really fresh and aren't enough in quantity.

Overall, the freshly cooked things like (dosa,omelette are perfect!), the juices are really fresh and there is a big variety, the fruits are fresh and a must have and altogether it is pretty satisfying !

I visited this place during this durga puja with my two friends. We opted for the ashtami special buffet. There cannot be any complain about the ambiance which was really awesome and quite cozy. The best part was the staffs were really cordial and they were happily guiding us and suggesting all the special items which we should try out. There were so many items which i obviously don't remember in detail but the items which i liked were the prawn cutlet, mutton biryiani ( it simply stole the show), prawn bhapa, hilsa (dont remember the exact name of the preparation) and the best part was their dessert (there were so many that in literal sense i became crazy). The salads were quite nice which apart from chicken and other veg salads also included sea food salad. I even tried chicken masala with paratha and also chicken chaap. There were many bengali preparations which i could not try out because i wanted to keep a part of my stomach empty for the desserts which were so attractively displayed that it was hard to concentrate on the main course. In dessert I tried out pana cotta, brownie, cheese cake, a blueberry dessert( don't know the name), mishti dahi, baked mihidana and last but not the least chenar jalebi. All the desserts were to die for and i was so impressed. It was only the chicken masala which i did not like so much otherwise my overall experience was quite wonderful.

Had high hopes prior visit this cafe due to memorable experience at La Cucina and Guchhi. We did online reservation and had confirmation. On reaching I realized they put wrong surname beside my name and incorrect head count information against the reservation. We were carrying Groupon vouchers and immediately the attention of servers turns into ignorance once they were informed the same.¬†On a busy evening the peaceful ambiance turns into a busy area as the seating area is close to the buffet counter and the same is passage used by many.

For mocktails they have nice variety but for Groupon vouchers they were offering only basic options (they call it Bar man's Collection). On escalating to one of their managers Tanmoy who took care of the same. Special mention for Italian Smooch and Virgin Mojito. I really love they way they served my poison on the rocks.

Salad counter has option to make your own salad dressing (like Subway) but taste is very flat. Main course has continental and Indian option but none of them had any touch of 5 star. Satay live counter was good but roast chicken counter didn't live up to my expectation.
In main course non-veg only decent taste was for Fish in Garlic Sauce and rest all lack taste, spice or flavour. One reason can be this cafe serves buffet to its hotel guests from various nationalities. So may not suit Indian taste buds. India veg dishes are served inside deep handi at the buffer counter and one have to tilt the handi to find what is inside and dip his inside handi for picking. This prevented me from trying veg courses.

Dessert counter had impressive collection as usual covering Indian and International collection. No complain on the same however the final nail in the coffin was finding hair in Moong Ka Halwa. On highlighting to their management they removed the dish from the counter but till then few people already had the same.

To compensate the experience I had they served complimentary Chana r Jalebi (tasted amazing) on my table and gifted chocolate box while leaving.

Such quality control whether hygiene or taste or even personal touch by servers are the few least expectation from a 5 star that's why people shell out extra bucks. Being a honest reviewer, even after their compensatory gestures will not recommend this cafe from my end.

I have never returned disappointed from Hyatt after a buffet dinner at waterside cafe. And I recommend it to those people who can really eat. 

Be it breakfast, brunch, or a proper dinner, the buffet laid is wide. The menu will never make you go for ala-carte. To add to the fine dining, the ambience makes it more lively with just the apt lighting and the waterside seating. Feels like a very family kind of place and a good option for a romantic dinner.

Great food, awesome ambiance, good service. You get everything that you expect from a name like Hyatt. The buffet they had for Durga Puja was awesome, ranging from Bengali cuisine to excellent delicacies from all over the world. Plus, they got a great selection of spirits, in case you are a connoisseur, and know the 'poisons'. Waterside Cafe is a must-do for any foodie who looks for quality.

I went to the Hyatt Waterside Cafe with my family on the eve of Sashthi this Durga Puja. We have been to this place before and we liked the whole ambiance and the sound of water and the soft music. The view from our table, (as we were seated next to the glass panel) was serene and since it wasn't sunny, quite pleasant. The food was cooked well and the fish and chips, the pizza, the spaghetti and the white sauce pasta were done to perfection. How ever what was surprising is that all four dishes were served together. That created a chaos on our plates and we were left with cold food items on our plates. But the big let down was the drinking water they served. It had a weird taste to it and I wasn't expecting that sort of water from a restaurant at the Hyatt. We then ordered for mineral water because we did not want to get sick and spoil the rest of the Puja time.

Beautiful ambiance. If you are keen on spending for luxury, this is the right place for you. I tried the durga pujo special buffet. I found myriad innovations in bengali dishes like Kochu and mocha. The non veg dishes were divine. I prefer a quiet place with fine dining and personal attention, so Waterside Cafe was a perfect place since i found the head chef talking personally to his customers and helping them through the buffet. A beautiful experience. Definitely calls for a revisit!

I went for the durga puja special lunch buffet. I was just dissapointed with the overall experience. They could have the following to make it more interesting by adding more varieties of fishes, rice amongst other bengali delicacies.
Being a 5star, I believe they should've been a little cautious to offer an authentic spread. I hope they offer some wet wipes for their guests. I hope they invest a little more in cross culture training in international table service standards.

Waterside cafe is indeed a wide layout for dinning option but definately lacks Hyatt touch. Food is good but service lacks warmth. Very casual approach from the staff as my friend's card was swiped twice for the same amount which is a big no. The waitress dressed in Indian attire was good and smart to help us out with a nice dinning area. Overall a good restaurant but staff can be little more trained on service standards.

Well first of all: Always leave space for dessert. This place is out and out romantic and poetic, the sitting area being just next to the pool makes it look extra special. I was there with friends at night, for drinks and food. The service is also good enough and so is the food. The pizzas and the pastas are very good, the chinese admittedly not top notch but still better than other places. And always, never ever forget about the dessert. The mousse and the cakes are particularly, I would say, a specialty of this place. Must recommended.

Day2 - nothing better than to start with a "Breakfast Buffet" that too at a Hyatt;and it sure did live  up,if not crossed it! The rains and the greys against the slanted glass walls (sitting in AC ) and next to the pool- made the whole seating "extra" poetic. Not wasting a minute- started with the cold platters- along with the mushrooms n cheeses n dates; and the Fresh fruit platter - lovely to see - each and every fruit getting sliced fresh n being laid infront. - the mangoes were perfectly sweet n juicy & the kiwis were exceptionally sweet!
The usual "sausages"- were exceptionally hot n with a slight crisp to it's Each bite.
I had to give in to my weakness- of Conjee rice & hot oatmeal- seared with helpings if chicken cubes,chipped celery & of course the soya.
Huge Tray if All the breads I know- esp the chocolate based whole wheat - fresh and soft .
An array of fresh juices, a South Indian counter, the egg station - all very upbeat,quick n equally tasteful! 
The poha- well the "Pune-ite" in me- was maybe a bit too critical ,could have used more salt ,even the wada. - but the sambhar equalised the flavours.
The desserts- in Kolkata (no pun intended) - I have the blueberry yoghurt a miss ; started with the mixed fruit compote "baked" sweet curd- somehow there was something so earthly to it's taste; and of course -Had to relish the "Mishti doi" in the end- tsch tsch :) 
And then Had been saving myself for this end- Muesli,almonds,cashew nuts,dates,skimmed (there were 4 options), with white n Brown flax seeds ( special mention- Flax seeds, brownie points for Those!) , the chef chopped up some fresh green apples and I could end my Appetite with That crunch ,Those flavours - Happy Me! ( see if u know the Me- I'm a sucker ,'like Serious types' for Muesli) 
*the only hitch - the expresso- was not Hot; just warm- n it was re served but At the same temp only ) 
But nonetheless - breakfast Bomb that was!

We had the dinner buffet here, and the theme that night was Goan in Indian and French in International. Being a  Goan resident for the last four years, I was excited to see how they fared in comparison to the real deal. And I was amazed that the King Fish Masala Fried I had here was the best damned goan fish preparation I've ever had. The rest of the Goan dishes were good too, but I kept going back to the King Fish.
In the French part, they had the usual Bouillabaisse, Veg Au Gratin, etc. And it all tasted a tad bland and boring. Nothing new there. They had a live Cut of Lamb counter which was heavenly, though. The chef cut it to perfection and grilled it before serving. The meat was tender and cooked well. 
However all this felt like the appetizers once I moved on to the desserts. Oh, the desserts. I could die at that dessert section. They had some forty types of dishes here, and I tried tasting all of them. I had a Dal ki Halwa and Gulab Jamun with Mango chutney, so rich that my stomach still hasn't recovered from it. I spent at least an hour at the desserts before giving up unable to finish tasting all of the chocolate pastries on offer. 

Over all it was one of those life changing meals one has, that remain as a benchmark for other places, in the future. I would surely love to go back but I'm afraid of losing my mind at that dessert counter.

Hands down my favorite place to eat at, especially on a Friday (theyve had 50% off on Fridays on many occassions). The buffet is so diverse, from fresh salads, to chinese on one side, a live Italian pizza/pasta bar in the middle and indian on the far left side. The desserts are heavenly. If they had 50% off everyday i'd probably eat there even more often. It's my favourite place to go for a special occasion.

I am just wondering how come i have not reviewed this place yet.... been here so so often and so many times and enjoyed myself thoroughly every time... when i was younger and alcohol is 5 stars were being served 24 hours have been here for a midnight binge for beers and drinks and food...

although this place is best on a Sunday for the brunch as they serve an amazing spread... in the recent days we stopped going to Hyaat to waterside as the place had changed and the spread and the food was not what it once was...

but i returned to find my Old Hyaat type spread with amazing taste Back with a bang... was super happy to see...

in the brunch there is a more than enough selections of Veg and the cheese platters are always a fun thing to try and test... 

the pizzas and the pasta made at the live counter is always of top notch quality and the experience of choosing what to put and in how much quantity really fascinates a lot of people though i normally leave it up to the Chef there...

the Desserts of Hyaat is the main thing and everybody (who are allowed sweets) should save up for this.... from the mousse to the mud pie to the cakes... everything is amazing and you will be in taking calories without thinking cause it is well worth it... 

the people serving you are always more than helpful to us and maximum times we dont even need to visit the buffet as everything is served to us anyway... they are super helpful...

Obviously being hyaat and everything the price is a little steep for the brunch or al a carte... but then it is well worth it and the experience of eating here is always a fun thing to remember and take back with you...

with the serene ambiance and calming feature all around... this place is a fun visit and always an enjoyable experience....

Hyatt you beauty! I have come hre a few times and I have adored the food. BUt a word of caution: ALWAYS LEAVE SPACE FOR THE DESSERT! Otherwise you will end up overeating. The soup is good and the starters are fabulous. I am especially fond of their chicken salad. When it comes to the main course, I must say that I love their cooking. One time, Chef Abdul Wahab spiced up some awesome pasta for us and it was amazing. I do not know if Abdul is still there but his Tiramisu is also worth having. In spite of delicious brownies and souffles, the ice cream also attracts me, especially since there are two or three flavours (I am attrracted by colours)! 

I had to descrive the food frist because it is that good. Coming to the ambience, let me say that your guest will not be unimpressed since it is sheer brilliance, the atmosphere! This is sophisticated dining and you should save a months eating out if you have to but definitely come here. Highly recommended!

With hyatt you would expect a high standard and all. But sadly when I visited the place it was hardly upto its expectations. I have been there before and did like the food on previous occassions but well my visit during pujas last year turned out to be a disaster. I has ordered the tiger prawns which at hyatt I expected to be moutwatering. But instead got rotten prawns. When I confronted the waiter he said it was supposed to taste like this. On demanding to see the chef he said we are terribly sorry and didnt charge us for that. Frankly the place is loosing its touch . One would never expect such an awful experience here. All in all I am never vising this place agaim

Being enthusiastic and having good taste bud we visited The Waterside Cafe of Hyatt Regency as we were stay at Hyatt and the experience was terrible. Food quality is not at per of Hyatt quality ‚Äì there are better restaurants in Kolkata that will give you best quality. Food is neither mouthwatering even nor like home made. Nothing like Hyatt special. Service is usual - very formal & straight no passion. Finally, we will find better hygiene standard in some other low price restaurant as flies have free admittance in this place. Will not recommend this place to my privileged guest, did a mistake taking my clients here.

I had much more expectation from this place because this is a restaurant of a 5 star restaurant. I had reserved this place a day in advance for a special dinner plan thinking it might get crowded on a Saturday evening. Firstly when I called in on a Thursday to book a table I was told the buffet per head is Rs.1950 and I confirmed my booking and on Friday when I called back to confirm my reservation I was told my table is booked for Friday instead of Saturday, I was shocked and then I made them book me a table on Saturday again and I was told there will be an early bird discount for people who come in between 7pm to 8pm. Then finally when we went there at the restaurant, the ambience as expected was great and beautiful. But the restaurant was not at all crowded and seemed like a very slow day. We opted for the buffet which wad the biggest mistake as we did not take a look at the spread. Goan cuisine was the theme of the day with Goan rice, dal and fish curry with usual salads. The wasn't impressed with the food at all and finally had to order for a sheekh kebab from the ala carte menu. I wish the waiters were a little more friendly as they looked quite grumpy with the expression they wore. And with a buffet that amounted to 1600+ they should offer a beverage with it which they dont. Finally durning the bill time I was again shocked to know that the early bird discount is limited to only on weekdays. How can the staff be so uncoordinated. Not expected from a 5 star joint. Expected much much better for such a price. But I would give them a plus one for the ambience and the dessert spread which made our day!

I love this place, went in thinking that I would grab a bite cause we had already skipped dinner and decided to manage with a snack.The place is quiet and neat and it is a favourite haunt when I want to step in for an informal chat or catch up after hours with friends. I ordered a continental club sandwich and a smoothie. The club sandwich was really well made and had almost everything that would make it a perfect sandwich and it was layered extremely well, the accompanients were good as well.

This is a definitely a must visit if you want to try some fancy stuff and step out of your usual coffee-shop mode. I have always found 5 star coffee shops to be a quiet retreat and an once in a way indulgence, maybe because I have worked in one, i have fallen in love with the magic and charm. The meal for two costed around 1500 plus taxes but was worth it and simply awesome.

The ambiance of this place forces me and my foodies to pay another visit and to my delight, I am sure, have again convinced me to give it yet another (let's say..numerous) shot in future. This time I came downstairs through Hyatt to have buffet lunch with my colleagues.

Ambiance:
Oh my my! Where shall I start from? Waterside, to me, is the best location in Hyatt to have a lunch and even dinner. Just fill your plates from their dishes and take the place near the window pane. Munch on the meal peacefully enjoying the view of the pool, the fountain and the beautifully maintained garden view. The plant pot placed just in the middle of the dining space gives it a nature feed to your eyes. The comfortable chairs and the ecstatic tables gives it an all together lavish yet cozy seating arrangement. 

Food:
The wide spread variety of food - from appetizers, salad to main course from different cultures and to the never ending baked desserts, gives me a watery mouth whenever I think about it. It was following the Monday buffet theme.  Not much to say about the salad section, but the Awadhi style was simply marvelous! The lamb, the chicken, the rice... all so delicious. Moving to the dessert section, remembering which helped me not to fill my stomach till my temple, I just couldn't resist the bakery delights of this place. The croissants, the puffs, the mousse, the muffins, the custards.. phew!! I still couldn't decide the winner among them! You get all of this (let's say around 100 items all over or more) by just 1550 with 20% discount! The quality and the preparation have improved a lot. This will be my next excuse to visit this place. 

Hospitality:
A top notch service, as usual, gains my attention and gives me a tremendous satisfaction to select Waterside as my favorite spot to eat. They will always take care of you yet keeping an eye on every corner, on every customer. The warmth in their mannerism always leaves a long lasting memory of a good lunch.

The class, the elegance and the sophistication - keep maintaining them not forgetting to advance your efforts on the food quality too. It gives me pleasure and peace to find myself dining at this place.

Why have i gone back to this place again? Only for the ambience - YES ! This restaurant at ground level climbing down the stairs from the lobby has a cozy sitting for friendly chat or family dinner. Evenings are especially good ! What have i eaten?Mostly the weekend dinner buffet which is a reasonable spread of cold cuts and salads, indian and continental starters, indian and continental main course followed by some amazing desserts. I LOVE their dessert spread through out the year! The starters and main course are not so exciting as i do not prefer indian cuisine which is pretty spicy and heavy. But i understand that there are customers who look out for indian fare and the Management has to consider that too. Having been there quite a number of times we considered exploring the Christmas Eve dinner which turned out to be disappointing. Other than turkey we did not find anything overtly exciting from what we usually find throughout the year in this restaurant. Will i revisit Waterside Cafe? Yes, only for the ambience.

I visited the Waterside Cafe for Sunday Brunch.
Very good ambiance, cool and clean decor, glimpse of the pool area, friendly and courteous staff, last but not the least - good food, all of it gives it the quality of a 'recurring visit' place. I would say one of the most romantic restaurants around. This is located at the ground floor of¬† Hyatt.Experience was awsm , food quality was mindblowng but expected more variety of deserts
Loved ambience n hospitality!! Behavior was very good!! Over all m loving it .. Must try

The Waterside Cafe has a wonderful ambiance but for a bit I thought they had lost their way in terms of the food. However I am inordinately pleased to announce that recent visits have show great improvement and that makes me super happy ! Both their Club Sandwich and Tenderloin Burger are delicious. The Kung Pao Chicken surprised me with its flavors and was excellent as are the Fish and Chips and the Tenderloin Steak. They also have some Thai , Middle Eastern , North and South Indian and Bengali Dishes available though I have not tasted them so can't comment .  The Cassata with Strawberry and Mango Coulis is a lovely dessert a little of the beaten track which I really enjoyed. The buffet spread  also looks pretty good though its been a while since I sampled it since I usually prefer to order from the  Menu. 
Its also a lovely place if your out with friends on a weekend and want to chill out after dinner over conversations, coffee and desserts.

I would in all fairness say that the ambience is one of the best in the city and 5 stars for it but would rate the food at only 3 stars. Its not that the quality or quantity is poor but that it lacks innovation and dimension. The buffet is repetitive so though I enjoyed it the first couple of times I got a little bored thereafter. The staff also at times is supremely attentive and at times a little indifferent. What I like on the a la carte menu is the Eggs any Style ... great especially post midnight after some partying and the club sandwhich which is really good. Their dessert selections are pretty nice as well.

The waterside cafe at hyatt! Has great service and ambience. Must try the desserts, especially melting chocolate.  Its beautiful!! 
Though the spread at waterside isnt as great as la cucina. But its a great place to just get going with work.

This is my favorite place to eat in the whole wide world. I love having the buffet here. They always have a great spread but its better on weekdays.

The salad bar is one of the best that i have seen in a long time and the dessert spread is also amazing. I have tried and liked so many unusual stuff that i would never try otherwise. For people who love trying new things, having the buffet is like a party. Although it is expensive (which is expected from a 5 star hotel) , i feel that it is worth the money spent.

They have a good selection on their a-la-carte menu also. They serve the most amazing thai curries that i have tasted anywhere. The falafals in pita pockets are also really good. 

I love going to this place and just sitting their looking at the water with a glass of wine and some scrumptious food. People who can afford it should please try it out.

The service and ambience was damn good but the food  spread, quality definitely not upto the mark, people would expect at a five star restaurant. Salads were just so so. The only non veg item available at starter spread was Chicken Tangri Kabab. The Pizza was just superb!. The pork was bit stiff. Motton could hardly be tasted as they were full of bones. Chicken prepation was also average. Best was the indian breads specially the butter naan.
The only thing that had impressed me was Desserts. It had a decent spread which looked much better comparing to the other spreads. Mango Coconut sandesh was really nice. Definitely poor comparable to the buffet offered at the other known five star restaurants in Kolkata.

some experiences leave a lasting memory...and the one at waterside cafe did just that. recommended by rahul arora, I brought my friend here on ashtami morning, which also happened to be his birthday, for the breakfast buffet, and it was amazing. 
first, the view is spectacular. add to that the sound of trickling water and it immediately makes you feel relaxed and calm. 
then comes the hospitality. good manner is one thing, but a warm and endearing one is something else altogether. and the staff here gifts you the latter! 
the food is anything but mundane, well spread out, with live counters to cater to particular needs.
but the best part of the hyatt waterside is its bakery. melt-in-the-mouth crossiants, delicious puffs, blueberry muffins...everything is top notch!

and at the end, they surprised my friend (and me) with a cake and sparkling candle!
I am definitely coming back here soon enough!

Date of Visit: Visiting since 2009, last visited on Jan 2016

An amazing place to get together with friends as well as hold powerful meetings. Very good ambiance, cool and clean decor, glimpse of the pool area, friendly and courteous staff, last but not the least - good food, all of it gives it the quality of a 'recurring visit' place. Normally vegetarians don't get too many choices in buffet spreads of five star hotels. But here we have enjoyed all buffets, be it morning, noon or night. When they had just opened, they even baked a customized cake in the shape of a billiards table for us. The head chef personally met us and took the details and delivered the same as per the instructions! Pocket pinch is rather high but that's well expected.

Jan 2016:

We went for a late night dinner buffet. Mostly, we liked the salad counter, and tried the following  - Pita Bread, Cucumber Pickle, Chickpea Salad, Tomato Olive Feta, Hummus, Babaghanoush, Carrot Taratir, Lettuce & Bell Peppers Salad and Zucchini Salad. All the items tasted nice. We also liked the Mushroom Soup and the freshly tossed Hakka Noodles. The main course was pretty average in taste, and also cold!

Good ambience. We went to restaurant with prior booking for table for 4. But after reaching there no one attended us and welcomed us. This was disappointing. I could see they had ample staff doing smethng or the other, except attending guests. We went thr with group on deal and hotel staff was least bothered and zero co operation shown. Waiter attended could not evn offer simple beverage at room temperature, later he admitted tht he forgot the order. Good brand and poor service.. But chef near the counter were very welcoming and warm and with ready to serve attitude.

I have been to this place twice and both the time I loved it like anything. 
Though both the time it was over a buffet linch with friends. 
The buffet was awesome especially the Calamari saled, Salamis salad and tender loin with Gravy.
The pork loin was a little bit on the colder side, but I could live with that, as there were not many takers at the station.
The live station for Salad, pasta and piza were simply great, howver I feel that they should have more set of choices for pasta especially the sauces (they only had Tomate based sauces. A couple of Bechamel based ones should have sealed the deal)
Dessert station was again fully stacked and presented a variety of fare. However, being an out and out chocolate admirer, I would recommend the brownie (which had mud pie-ish texture. Simply awesome :P)
I must admit that the food was not only delicious also of very good quality. 
Service is very prompt and so perfect.
 I also liked the interior quite lot. The ambience is quite pleasant and  not noisy at all. 
The rates are a bit on the higher side, but  I would like to go again for the taste and quality of the food.
 Highly recommended!!!!!!!

The ambiance is nice, u can definitely have a hearty talk at ur leisure while enjoying the food though the spread is very limited unlike the one at ITC Sonar or Taj Bengal. Non Veggies are very limited at disposal and refilling takes a lot of time...Pork was decent initially but later it tasted nothing more than chewing gum blended in spices...expected a lot from a 5 star like Hyatt and hope they improve on the spread and quality

One clarification for SHAR D who has his review posted : Maybe he is italian by heart and taste, but I completely agree with Swagata M. I have traveled many places (the hiltons, the marriotts and the leelas) and have savored authentic and not-so authentic pizza at most places. I completely agree with Swagata M that the pizza which got served at the dinner buffet at Hyatt was bland and was nowhere closer to the authenticity which SHAR D is referring to...I am sure from his other reviews he is a pure localite and thrives on local and spicy food...and thus has gone berserk after having a bland pizza, thinking that is the authentic taste of an italian pizza...

Recently we visited there and ordered for buffet in dinner. First I like to tell ambiance wise there is nothing to say ... as expected.
But as this is Hyatt the expectation rose way above when someone reached there.
It might be OK for others but not for here; Chicken fried rice was average and one of my colleague told me that he founds it might not be the most fresh. Baked fish I don't like even.
Tanduri chicken was very good and same for lamb item. 
Little bit more variations again to be expected from the desert counter.
Next time will love to write the review in more salubrious phase of  mind!

I visited the Waterside Cafe for Sunday Brunch. The seating and lookout makes you relax immediately. The service is prompt without being obstrusive. You can have your meal for as much time as you want and, with not very heavy flow of patrons, you enjoy the calm and peace.

I agree with Shar D's review below. The items to choose are vast and taste authentic. The Pizza (thin crust Italian style), pasta, lasagna are freshly made and not greasy. The hummus, falafel, etc are rightly balanced in flavor.The smoked salmon and an assortment of salaami, bacon etc in the cold section are varied and delicious. Plenty of salads to choose from. The crepe counter doles out wonderful crepes right in front of you. Starters of tandoori chicken and paneer are just tastefully done. There are Indian food also available and all are very flavorful without being excessively spicy. Even the dessert section is varied and interesting.

The only thing which was a tad disappointing for me was the lack of choices of Mocktails (just 4 options to choose from) though there are many choices of imported hard drinks.

My second review where I am perplexed at, and butting heads with same reviewer Swagata M. 

I presume she is a local who loves indian food, and expects this standard of spice for foreign foods. Italian pizza is greatly misunderstood worldwide, as it has been pushed aside by its american greasy competitor. Real pizza bread is like crusty naan roti, etc..

All I can say is, the food here is well made, close to its country of origin, and of good standard (no american pizza, pasta here). Most preparations are light, with flavor, and not bland, as declared by the indian tongue. This may be unappealing to spice loving and spice expecting indians, I applaud the restaurant for not adulterating the food to local sensitivities - like adding more garlic, onion, masala powders, caramelising sauces, etc.. The new health conscious indian may appreciate the food though. Service is slow, like that of a bygone era. Enjoy your time here over long talks with your company.

You get five star service in a much relaxed ambience here. The trees against the white are refreshing. Nothing here is uptight. The food served here is good but not extraordinary. They have regular breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet here where a whole lot of food are served but my pic would be their collection of cheeses and desserts. Im not much big a fan of their main courses as im of their desserts. They do magic with chocolate. In fact they pretty much do magic with anything sweet. So what in saying is that their pastry chef is brilliant. For birthdays, i usually pick up my cakes from here. And their service too is brilliant. About seven or eight years ago, I had forgotten about my dating anniversary and got to know at 11ish in the night that i was without a gift whereas my other half had a diamond ring ready. I quickly rushed to Hyatt. They had just closed down their billing counter and told me that the sale was closed for the day. On seeing my despair he politely asked me the matter and then smiled. He promptly took out a cake and have it to me. When i went to pay, he said, "Compliments on your anniversary from hyaat. The counters closed and I cant bill." i was moved. I went back the next day and have been going there to celebrate our dating anniversary ever since, even though now im married! Other restaurants don't have the heart that Waterside Cafe has.

Been there few days back with family.
Ambience was just great, esp. if one can grab a seat at the far end by the floor-to-ceiling glass wall seperating you from the waterside.
Food is so-so. Plenty of scope for improvement. Quality and Variety.
But the main thumbs-down is the service. The waitors seemed indifferent to the customers' requests. And very under-staffed too. On the whole, disappointed. Poor service from a 5 star rated hotel.

The first thing which grasps your mind while you enter this 24 hour restaurant in Hyatt is the ambience.....The captivating view of the lush garden from the large glass window panes takes you to different heights of ecstasy...The high ceilings and the tastefully done-up interiors with indoor trees are a few examples of the beautifully laid-down architecture !! The ambience deserves a 5 out of 5.Coming to the food,i think,putting more stress on the food quality compromises the taste of some of their items unlike Gucchi(their another restaurant)...i didnt find their margherita pizza overwhelming though.The club sandwich is good.The turkish chicken in their buffet is delectable.But what catches my taste buds is their desserts..the Mud Pie and Mango-Mousse are heavenly !! Because of their foreign clients,the quality is strictly adhered to..!! Hospitality is not something to be boasted about....!! 4 points from me overall..

I had fish and chips. the fish was cooked really well. And the chips were perfect. The club grilled sandwich which is huge and tasty. The coffee is lovely too. Will visit again to try out the other dishes.

love ambience. . after the last show at the Broadway multiplex with a friend went for a cup of coffee and ended up having a club sandwich and fish and chips.it was good. and the tiny pots of mustard, mayo and ketchup was too cute at the table. the service was nice and its a wonderful place to go for  food if your tummy growls after a night show. a midnight favorite.

Haven't had the food here. Dropped in late one cold night with mates for a cup of tea. Ordered 4 cups of Earl Grey and there were cookies to go with it. Beautiful ambiance. Good service. The funny bit was when they billed us for 44 cups of tea instead of 4. They did correct the mistake after noticing our rather amused faces. As it turns out the incident has become one the funny stories amongst friends. Will go back again.

First the good thing: The ambiance - The lovely gardens visible beyond the windows and the soothing music played in the background transport you to a totally different world. The staff are also very nice, friendly and knowledgeable.

Now the bad thing: The food - The food is complete let down. Maybe the spice content of the items have been toned down keeping in mind the Foreign/inhouse clientele that the hotel caters to. Stick to the Continental/European fare, the Indian dishes here are disaster.

We had lunch at the Cafe on a week day. The food was very good but not gourmet. The alcoholic drinks were unlimited and they made the exact drink to your choice. The Maki was fresh and nice. Will recommend trying it. The service is good and staff are polite.The seating is very calming as it overlooks the fountain and lawn.

this is one of my all time favorite places in the city. the rustling of water and the large glass panes overlooking the lawn and the fountain just calms u down . 
wonderful high ceiling and very tastefully designed. 

the staff at the hyatt always extends a very warm welcome once u come here. 
coming to the buffet first. simply adore their pizzas over all all the food in nice and the buffet is always generously stocked. although  the salad buffet could do with a face lift 

the baked yogurt in dessert section is my all time favorite. 

the a la carte portions are quite filling too.. love the huge club sandwich here 

waterside cafe = instant smile on my face.

Tasteless food.
Endless variety (the buffet - not the a-la-carte).
Broadminded service (relax..........).
Spacious.
In one of our (wife and son) numerous visits - got to ogle at Suchitra Sen's daughter (what's her name ?  .. oh yes - the double moon, such a wonderful mnemonic and yet so easy to forget !) Confirmed by a TV show later that evening at home. Why are celebrities celebrated? Sorry, no clue!

Have money - will splurge, paisa phenko - tamaasha dekho, kind of place.
Will pay for the professional service and the variety.

The ambience of this restaurant is awesome including some live tree. good for a lazy brunch or dinner. i went with my family to celebrate a birthday. but the food is not so good. the kebabs finished in the buffet and we received it on our table after almost 20 minutes. the ilish (hilsa) festival was going on at that time. the hilsa egg soup was tasty. but other items were dull. the starters of assorted cold cuts and salads were not very impressive. the only thing worth mentioning is the dessert counter with sumptous delicacies. we had some senior citizens in our group but no help was availale for them in the buffet. all in all good place if you want to show off but definitely not that good if you want to have a memorable food experience.
