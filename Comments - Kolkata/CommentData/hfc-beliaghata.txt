Replicating the very popular KFC ,but priced reasonably , this place is located in Beleghata Joramondir .If you are not getting KFC nearby , you can try out their range of crispy chicken items . The seating arrangement is generally on the street ,which is actually unhealthy ,so better you order it at home .

WHAT I ORDERED :

1.CHICKEN BURGER 
2.FISH BURGER 
3.FRIED CHICKEN
4.CHICKEN STRIPS 

The chicken strips are a boon . They taste amazingly cripsy. Also have their chicken burger. Too good.

HFC is a fast food  eatery located at Beliaghata and serves chicken items in KFC style.

Service is prompt.

Tried their Chicken burger , Chicken pakora. Both were lip smacking and well made with generous stuffings inside. Chicken pakora was very crispy, a must try.

Pocket pinch is very reasonable

Recommended....

Hong Kong fried chicken(HFC),Beliaghata
Location: 30 secs from 35 bus stand. 
It's a roadside fast food centre and they serves fried chicken in KFC style, burgers, French fries, and American food. 
I tried they hot crispy chicken pakora it's big in size with a chunk of chicken coated with cornflakes..  It's really a lips smacking one and price is only rs20/piece. 
Tried their burgers they make potato, egg and chicken burgers starting from rs30. Chicken burgers are not typical Patty Burger it's the crispy chicken with coleslaw it's yummy..  
Pocket pinch for 1 is rs100..
I'll keep visiting, how about you all?
