Located on the ground floor of Hotel Sojourn, this cafe is not a very popular spot among the young crowd. What I like about Sojourn is that for all their outlets - Bar, Restaurant, Coffee Shop they have maintained their quality!! The coffee shop is a cute outlet with good food and beverages. Staff are courteous. Everything about this place is prim and proper.

I wish them all the best for the future!!

Visited this place with my mother (she is a regular). Had Masala Tea (4/5), Chilli Cheese Toast (4/5) and Club Sandwich (3/5). Pretty decent pricing. Friendly staff too. Dont expect a great or extraordinary food or ambience, however do go in if you are around the area and need to spend some time.

This cafe is very near to my place, located strategically near the Saltlake Stadium. In matters of ambience, hospitality they are good. I like the food variabilities, though sometimes quality gets hampered!!

This cafe is pretty warm and cosy with a great view of the road outside. The breakfast buffet is pretty good. The coffee is lovely. The waiters are also very hospitable and friendly. Would love to visit it again and again!!
