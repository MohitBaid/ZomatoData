Its a destination with amazing food and brilliant service. From Kolkata after a drive you would want to be here. Brilliant is the word.The crab is a must along with the kebab platter. Butter Naan and mutton is extremely delicious. Chilli Mushroom is crème de LA crème here. Absolute value for food.

Excellent food. Excellent view. Courteous Staff. Tandoor food and Chutney is very delicious. Good hangout location with friends. And yes, fast home delivery options available.

Ordered Mix fried rice, Hot garlic chicken, Tandoori chicken. Tandoori chicken was good, but they didn't served fresh chicken on mixed fried rice and hot garlic, the smell was so horrible I complained the waiter but he didn't do anything in fact I had to pay for that shit. No apologies were said no action were taken. So I don't recommend to my friend and family to visit there and eat chicken which is 5-6 days old and refrigerated. So a big NO from my end. Third class food I must say.

Very bad experience. They have no idea about thali. Food was taste less. Maharaja and maharani thali is also not available. But they have not mentioned in on menu card. Before place my order I asked them the menu of chicken thali, they told me chatni, salad included. But when they served chatni was not available. And only only onion(one piece). Very bad.

Visited once and had hme delivery twice. Chicken drumstick and paper chicken are really spicy. Had ordered mixed fried rice, chili chicken and chicken drumstick. I didn't like the chili chicken. Quantity of the food are quite adequate!

Today I visited this outlet which is situated near Michael Bahar bus stop.Had tried their Chicken reshmi kebab,Egg fried rice, Chicken Manchurian,Chicken thali, and Mutton thali. Each and every item that we tried was excellent,delicious and mouth watering.Food quality was excellent and quantity was also filing. Pocket pinch was also small.If they maintain this food quality and standard they will go a long way for sure.Definitely going to visit again.

Great food , great quantity , nice ambiance , and pretty easy on the pocket as well. A much needed requirement for the area. The staffs are nice and friendly. Can go a long way if the standard is maintained.
