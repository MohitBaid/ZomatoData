Staffs are just too ill mannered I won’t say all but few them are just pathetic. I went to this place today around 5 with my wife, I ordered pizza afghani chicken and babycorn out of which i only recieved two items after i was served babycorn and afghani chicken i asked them several times how much time are they gonna take and they said “hora hai sir “ i waited for more than half n hour nd again called him to ask about my order and he said sir “aap pizza to order kiya hi nai” he didn’t even bother to inform us that he missed out our order of pizza where he should hav told us earlier when we asked him. There was one more guy I couldn’t click a pic, who was even worse in behaviour, i told this guy to get me some water and he just simply turned and went away,dude what kind of an attitude is it. I’m really disappointed with their service, I’m a regular visitor i go their twice a weak this was my worse experience and because of this insult i will never ever visit this horrible place where the staffs don’t know how to behave properly.

Went there with family last weekend on a super chilly afternoon for lunch. Ordered Manhattan with scapyard waterfall in drinks. Had chicken afghani and fish tikka as starters. Followed by mustard chicken pizza and pan fried chicken. It was presented in a very picturesque manner no doubt and the taste was average. The food was OK and drinks were pretty ordinary. But what was upsetting was the service. Very very unprofessional people working there. When ordered fish as starters they first refused and then after a lot of persuasion very reluctantly gave the fish tikka and when ordered chocolate lava in dessert simply refused saying it would take more than an hour coz they don't keep it ready. Asked to pack the leftovers which was also refused. Yet service tax was taken for this pathetic display as well. Ratings on the 5 most important aspects:-
Taste:3
Ambience:5
Value for money:3
Service:0
Hygiene:3

One of those perfect clubbing places in town to spend your weekend with friends. The amazing ambiance and the music just adds up to the liveliness of the place.

I went there with my friend and we ordered a "Mediterranean Pizza" and "Cheese Balls", the beverage we had was a mocktail named "Gentle Breeze". The food tastes good and the mocktail was refreshing, the hookah is also soothing. The staff were cordial too.

Ambiance - 4.5/5

Went here on my birthday after recommendation from few friends. ! 
This place certainly has the right ambience which the youth looks for. ! 
Pros- 
1. Ambience was lit AF. 
2. Tried the Sizzling Brownie with vanilla Icecream , which was a backup for my Birthday Cake and was literally mouth watering and super delicious. 😍
3. Veg Spaghetti was one of the best i have ever tasted . It had the right amount of ingredients which refreshed our mood. 

Cons - 
1. Service was bit on the slower side, despite not being so crowded at that time.
2. Hookah was quite average. We ordered Teen paan rose with normal base. 
3. The music played over there was quite depressing. DJ was on a loop mode and the live music was pretty dissappointing !

Went there on a Saturday night with friends ...starters were great and service was decent the only major irritant was the supposed  unavailability of non premium brands of alcohol which were on the menu but not available according to the waiter which was a deliberate ploy to get us to order the premium drinks...for instance we ordered absolut vodka and after 5 minutes the waiter came back and said only grey goose was available....don't understand why they don't take the regular alcohol off the menu if they don't want to serve it on a Saturday night

Great place to enjoy with friends, nice ambience with some good colletion of music playlists, you'll get hookak and also some nice starters and lots of variety of drinks. It does serve good foods. The roof top is just awesome, its a pleasure to sit at top and enjoy your order. Overall thumbs up to scrapyard.

Frankly speaking i liked this restaurant in my first look but with time goes by it started to become bitter service wise and food quality wise. 

Plus point for this restaurant is its location , in the heart of camac street it offers a pleasent view of the kolkata from the rooftop amd offers one of the best rooftop ambience. 

Coming to the food quality and quantity, its very less and favouring the people who comes for booze and shisha only , most of the menu is filled with starters and less choice is there for the main course.

We ordered fish fingers which were 8 in quantity with very small in size, next in the main course we ordered woakfried noodles along with chilly chicken which were very ordinary and there was no better choice to be made.

Service was also not upto the mark and with food quantity very less.

For the couples who wanted to have some booze and shisha, its an ideal place to visit because of the roof top ambience and the bed system for the shisha lover to get a good pep talk.But there are things to be improved in terms of service and food menu and i will look forward to that.

You know a place is going to be good if it’s somewhat crowded middle of the week, well lets just say it didn’t disappoint.
Nestled on the 9th and 10th floor,the interiors are quite nice ,going with the theme and the rooftop provides a nice view. They have different seating arrangements to fit all sort of crowds but what’s different is the bed seating on the terrace but one needs a large group to get to sit there. Although the lighting is a lil dim but its not a dampener. There was live music downstairs that was playing on the speaker upstairs as well.

Having read good reviews we ordered 3 starters 
~Paneer Tikka- Nice , soft ,well made with a tasty chutney to go with it, slightly spicy but a must have on the menu. 
~Tandoori Aloo- It was good but not great, chutney was same as the other tandoor items. 
~ Baby corn- It was surprisingly crispy accompanied with a small portion of kimchi which needs improvement but nonetheless the babycorn was amazing but despite asking for less spicy it would still burn your tongue.Also highly recommended! 

Overall the food was really nice but all the dishes were spicy, coming from someone who can handle a fair bit of spice herself i would find it befitting to give a disclaimer for the faint hearted! My only complaint would be the portion size, barely serves 2. 
Unfortunately i couldn’t click pictures owing to the dim lighting in the corner we were seated but rest assured its going to be a selfie and foodie heaven when it comes to pictures. Would definitely recommend, specially if u want to hang out with a large group. 
Finally on my foodie Meter i would rate: 
Ambience-👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻(4/5)
Food-🍽🍽🍽🍴(3.5/5)
Value for Money - 💸💸💸(3/5)

So we finally visited Scrapyard from my long awaited wish-list on the 1st day (actually evening) of 2018. It is located, opposite Uco Bank in Camac Street, seated above a tall building which also houses Kaidi Kitchen (Notice the orange fairy lights on a tall open rooftop and you'll know you have reached it) It is divided into two sections- one indoor area on 10th floor and lounge with rooftop on the 11th floor.
Luckily, we got seats in the rooftop area with pretty fairy lights, comfortable bed (yeah you read right ! They have comfy beds with tables attached to the middle section to keep food and drinks) and soothing breeze. The park street flyover can be seen from there. The rooftop is for smokers mainly, from cigarettes to different flavored hookahs ,it was all over the place. We, being non-smokers, did not have much difficulty cause of the open ambience.

We ordered the popular Pesto chicken pizza which was thin-crust and really yummy. It was my 1st time-having pesto sauce in pizza.
The alcoholic drinks here are priced according to a demand chart which keeps changing the prices- the staff have the prices on their tabs and you can also get them from their App. Some of the drinks were unavailable , much to our disappointment. So we got substitutes which were pretty good, quantity and taste-wise. With two drinks, pesto pizza and taxes, our total bill came to be Rs 865.
It gave me a Hauz Khas Village Social rooftop déjà vu , though HKV Social is better in many aspects.
Overall experience was quite good.
Ambience- 5/5
Drinks- 4/5
Food- 4/5
Service-3.5/ 5 (May be because it was over-crowded that evening, the staff could hardly hear us but they were courteous and helpful)
Cost-3.5/5
Location-4/5 (Lift service could have been better. It was a holiday so waiting time for the lift was longer)

You have got to try this place if you want to beat the week long blues. The ambiance was awesome. My friend loves this place and insisted that I visit it ASAP! After visiting it I got to know why. The music was lively and the ambiance gave a fun and positive vibe. The service was friendly and courteous. In spite of being a upscale lounging space their food totally lived up to my expectation. Can't wait to go back!

Went to this place post office on a Friday for a much needed unwinding.. after I have heard so much good about Scrapyard from my friend who is a regular there.
We ordered mushroom burmani, chilli chicken dry, breezers & hookah.
Food is good & reasonable.
Friendly staff.
Totally loved the look & feel of this place.. amazing ambiance.. the open air sitting area is highly popular & getting a place becomes quite difficult.. so if you are planning to visit in a big group, table booking is recommended.
I did love Scrapyard!

Happy eating 😊

Well getting to know about this new junction in town, #Scrapyard, just hopped in.

Now to talk in details..

Ambiance: Super amazing..it has two types of sitting, lounge as well as roof top, suggestion roof top will be better as its on 11th floor, and you get the whole city view.

Food: Super duper tasty would give a 4.5 out of 5. Pesto chicken pizza was an perfect thin crust crispy wood oven pizza which I had after a long time. Aayoli chicken was a mix of Aayoli sauce and garlic.. could taste the garlic on every bite, if the sauce given along with the same had been a bit Spicy, surely would had tasted better (my personal suggestion). Purab was extremely prompt in helping me out, and got me a hot garlic sauce, with which the same tasted much better. We chose a Sula Satori wine to go along, which is a blend of malbec and merlot, coming straight from Nasik valley. The wine is smooth and subtle, not very dry... something perfect to go with a Italian Cuisine.

Service: There is lot to improve. The hostess just took down the name and didn't escort us to the table. We were just shown the way to the Rooftop sitting. On reaching the place found Captain Shabbir, requested for a table for two... To which he seemed clueless and told us to check at the reception desk. On telling him we were only sent from there itself to this place, then he escorted us to a table. Then just went off. We had to ask for the menu. Could see the Captain only waiting at the side table only just to take orders, the servers were running all around. Purab helped us with the menu. On asking Shabbir to suggest a good wine, not dry .. he just had no idea. When asked what grape the wine Sula Satori has.. the answer was brilliant.. "jo grape hota hai wohi hai"..on asking which food will go with the wine again he was clueless. Had to choose all by ourselves. Thanks that we knew pizza was great here and just chose that. There on Purab interacted with us and got to know I was an hotelier from food and beverage service background, the service improved a lot. Netai, Purab.. and there was an another server, forgot his name.. all were great. Suggestion will be if more briefing being done one food, accompaniments, beverage and roll plays of service and selling, ordertaking.. the restaurant will be great asset to the city.

Price: Total expense was Rs.2009/- which I will say extremely pocket friendly with such food and ambiance

Overall a lovely time spent

Absolutely worth visiting! Lovely ambiance, friendly staffs and quite reasonable rates when compared to other places in that area. We had bira, hookah, this absolutely yummy ching ming chicken, dry chilli chicken, the not so good chicken pizza (forgot the name)! Would visit again and this time would definitely sit at the rooftop.

The look and feel of this place is amazing. And the rooftop is nice too. Coming to the food, I heard a lot from people about the food not being good but to my surprise they were wrong. We had ordered 
1. Crispy Chilly Babycorn. - It was really very crispy and tasty. 
2. Wok fried noodles - It had a lot of vegetables which was what I loved the most about the dish. 
3. Mediterranean pizza. - This one was decent too. The base was very crispy.
4.Paneer tikka- I loved the flavors that accompanied the cottage cheese. Tasted excellent with salad by the side. 
Food - 5/5
Presentation - 4.5/5
Pocket pinch- 4.5/5

Was not a pleasent experience for us. Do not go there if you cannot sit outside in the open air. We met a friend from US after a long time and went there. Too loud music for a small space ... literally things were vibrating! We could not hear even the person sitting next. Moreover the staff there did not help us out by providing an extra chair when one of our friend joined late. He had to stand for sometime though there were empty chairs around for reserved tables where no one arrive yet....this type of unprofessional attitude is not expected. Coming to food, it was good but the scanty quantity was a big turn down. We literally left the place after an hour and went to a different place. I do a lot of pub hopping but this place simply disappointed me.

Pathetic service. Rude staff. Served us with the wrong drinks. Didn't care to apologize. Poor quality service. Staff doesn't know half of the things. They take compulsory service charge going against the laws of the land that says it should NOT BE MANDATORY to pay the service charge. I will report to the income tax authorities. Not worth the money you're paying. I would never recommend this place.

It's on the 10th floor and the view is awesome. 
Went there with a friend. They have an indoor and an outdoor seating arrangement. They have single beds on the outside. 
Ordered pan rasna orange hookah, and a pesto chicken pizza. Both were good, only that we had a little problem with the hookah initially. 
Will definitely visit again and try out other things!

This was in my checklist since quite sometime.
This Camac Street based Gastro-Pub is one of best themed ones in the city of joy. 
Wonderfully lit this joint serves a varied section of Drinks and food which you can hit upon. 
The ambience is was so awesome that it automatically sets in your mood. 
Coming down to the food the pizza's here are worth mentioning.
Pesto Chicken Pizza and Mustard Chicken Pizza are ones i really loved, they crust is a little thin here but the taste kinda does the filling. 
Apart from the food the Liit is a must have here. This  buddy was so goood that i kinda fell for this joint. 
I highly recommend the Liit's here.
If you've got buddies who are ready to bare some bucks over some great drinks with some pretty amazing ambience you should be headed to this place. 
This place definetly gets a 'Must visit' tag from me.

When it comes to rooftops in kolkata this place would definitlely top the list.A very unique sitting arrangements on the outer deck and being on the top floor it gives a very nice panaromic view of the city skyline.The decor was pretty much based on how a garrage scrapyard looks like and the plates also had a touch of the garrage instruments gives it a unique touch.The food was pretty good i really liked the pizza,service eas descent too.All over a pretty good place to chill with your friends.

The outdoor seating looked good for which an early visit can help in weekends.

Heard a lot about this place so decided to visit there but alas it was a total disappointment. 
The staff have changed our tables three time with lot of confusion that the table was reserved for some one else after lot of discussion among each other they came to a conclusion that the table is empty and alloted to us. 

Now let's come to the food and drinks part.  We ordered prawn tandoori and fish finger.. Tandoori prawn was good in taste  but fish finger was okay-ish type and it could have been much better. And in drinks we ordered scrapyard ocean and LIIT. Both the drinks ended up with utter disappointment.  
The shisha was good which gave us some extend of satisfaction to visit the place.

The most important thing in any restaurant is their service because what I feel personally is that even if the food is average but the service is amazing people prefer to visit the place again and again but if the food is amazing but the service is pathetic people generally give a second thought while stepping in. That's because we aren't having the food for free so why should we be treated inappropriately. So I went to this place today and wished to sit in the open area to enjoy the weather....one of the staffs ORDERED me not to take that table as they were arranging the tables for an event .The way the staff told me this was really rude and weird so I got very pissed by that behaviour. Soon I saw that two friends just walked in and sat on that table and the staffs didn't say anything to them. I was shocked by that behaviour as I had been shifted to another table and where as the two girls who had just walked in weren't said anything. I was really very disgusted and disappointed with such a behaviour and just left the seat and moved down where I saw the receptionist on my way, I acquainted her with what had happened, soon she was accompanied by the manager and they didn't do anything about such a disgusting behaviour. REALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!

Uber cool upscale place to chill out the week long blues. Amazing atmosphere inside. Snugged atop the 10th floor and rooftop of the building, it is a buzzing place with lots and lots of next gen kids and young adults thriving for some action packed dancing. The DJ is not so good since he belted out romantic numbers out of nowhere on a Saturday night. Lol!! 
Coming to the food, it tasted really good. Very seldom we find good food in a upscale lounge. Finger food for the party animals. Good food with good music, ahh! Just the kind of place would like to spend my Saturdays.

The most ridiculous place I've ever visited. One of the staff members gave us a table and the manager told us that he's already alloted the same to someone else and made us leave that table. Zero coordination among the staff members. The ones who are supposed to help the guests leave no stone unturned to make it a terrible experience for them.

Went on the Sunday eve and it was full house... 

Located just on the building of Kaidi Kitchen or can be said as exactly on the crossing of minto Park and Camac Street.
 Beside Haldirams and Afra Tafri.

Ambience- It has two floors. On the 9th floor it was cafe cum pub with great ambience. The bar counter in the middle is adding up the attraction with bar chairs on its side. On the top floor the music is low with open area to dine in.

Price- The price can be seen on the huge screen placed inside it with the serving boys having tabs to give the order directly from your table. Nice concept. Though I felt it's bit too expensive. 

Food- We ordered hookah, beverages and veg items.

Hookah was nice but lil bit expensive compare to other restaurants.

In bevarages both Cocktail and mocktails was nice. As we ordered Cranberry based, Strawberry Based and Ginger lemon based bevarages. All was great.

Food was awesome in terms of taste. As we ordered Pizza, Pasta and chinese platter having Fried rice and veg manchurian. I felt it's expensive coz the quantity was bit too less if we go with the price.

The place is pretty good and well organised.. It also had some good music playing in the background. But the service could have been better when it comes to serving your guests. We had to ask for water twice before they handed us a bottle of mineral water.
We ordered Pan Fried Chicken which was pretty good and the chicken was really soft and juicy..Really liked this one👌🏻.
And the other item we ordered was pesto chicken pizza which was equally bad👎🏻  It was so hard and had the minimum amount of toppings in it.. Didn't like this one at all. 
Overall, this place is okay and you can go and give them a visit.

This cafe cum kitchen cum bar is at Camac Street on the 10 th floor of the Usha Kiran Building. It is spread across two floors. The floor below has live music arrangements and the ambiance is lively and very enjoyable. It was jam packed the day we went there so we decided to sit on the floor above which has open sky arrangements. Seats are very comfortable in the form of beds where one can lie and gaze at the wonderful night sky of Kolkata adorned with lights. Food quality is very good and the hookah was also very smooth and enjoyable. Pricing is reasonable. However, one thing which was not really satisfactory is that the restaurant charges Service Charge in top of GST. And since it was printed on the menu i had no option but to pay it. Barring this it was a great experience.

The rooftop is the highlight of this place,the 10th floor view is amazing,now coming to the orders part..
The 3 paan hookah according to the staffs were the strongest,but it was very light.
the afghani kebab was not soft,like it has been in several places i had it,the wok tossed noodles was good but the quantity was less.
Thats it folks,thumbs up for the interiors.
A big thumbs down for the quality and the quantity of the food and also the genre of the music in the rooftop.

Hey guys, so i had gone to this cafe recently and talking about it's ambience...it's really good. The music, the lights (neither too much nor too less) just perfect for that soothing or chilling time with your friends or other half. We had ordered "pan fry chicken" which was for Rs.291/-(excl. of tax) and a "pesto chicken pizza" which was for Rs.311/-(excl. of tax). Now talking about the food...the *pan fry chicken* i.e. a starter or a finger food was amazing in it's taste👌👌, there were 8 pieces in each plate, and they were really enough to satisfy your tummy. The chicken was very juicy and the flavours and masalas blended really well into the chicken. The flavours of the capsicum, chillies, onions, and that smooth taste of red wine and vinegar combination was damn good👍👍. It was very appetizing👌❤. But proboem was with the *pesto chicken pizza*, it did not taste good at all, right from the base to the crust to the flavours or toppings. It was not good at all. The crust felt like a papad...i couldn't find the bread part only of pizza leave alone softness of the crust😑. So the pizza is really a big no👎. Something that was interesting was their *bar menu*. It really had a lot of varities. But their *food menu* certainly did not have that, it had only limited options of foods. Would recommend this place for having a chilling time with your friends for a drink and finger foods but not really for appetizing meals.

I wish I could give this place something in negative. Never ever come across such a horrendous and I'll serviced place. I am still here while I write this review and trust me I don't write reviews ever about a place. I have been here once only before this visit and that day also the service wasnt up to mark . But today these people took the service to a whole new level all together. I am at the bar while I write this. I see  the manager talking to guests with one of his hands in his pockets ( Disgusting body language), probably he thinks he is Aamir Khan.  Secondly almost all the service people seem to be having a gala time along with the guests. 

I was really ashamed where I am standing at the bar and one of the service people probably a captain as per his dress code (Since I belong to restaurant line) came to the bar, started dancing, started taking puffs of my seesha,  drinking from some pickle jar 😂 and all the while dancing to some shitty Bollywood music and almost spilling my wine. 
When the bartenders noticed the same they asked me to move my drink. 😔😔

Also the manager was having drinks from the service counter 🤔 all the while and still acting like Aamir Khan with one hand in his pocket..🤣🤣🤣


I would request the owners to kindly shut down the place if they are short of some really good staff. I think you are making money by saving on your staff salary, because you have some really shitty staff and I think underpaid as well.

Trust me no matter how much you spend on the interiors, your music system or anything, you will never be a hit till the time you have someone at the entrance with folded hands. 

This is the hospitality industry and trust me I have failed myself in one out of my few outlets I could open..

Regards,  
Your well wisher.

Ambience matchs as the name ruggy, rough and scrappy. Music seemed good. 
I went on a sunday afternoon it was neither vacant nor there was a rush.. we were well attended by the staff.
Coming to food
1) Pesto Veg Pizza - it was Okish for my taste buds, classic pesto flavour was missing also the veggies were not adequate for veg pizza.
2) Spaghetti Agli olio (veg) - if you are an alio olio fan you should definitely have it.
3) Paneer Skewer - this was best Of all we have. Paneer was soft, smoky and well marinated served with onion and capsicum. Also the presentation was nice.
4) Baby Breeze - it was a punch of various fruit juice which was a total disaster for me. Didnt't like it at all, which is why i guess we didnt have any of the other mocktails.

Utilising the space to fit in almost everything from the bar stock pricing, mini bar, Dj, floor, standing seats, outdoor seating to what not.

The music played got me back the flashback of 2000s.
However, the food options as well as the portions is too limited.

Must visit. Cheers 🍻

It is no doubt one of the best places in Kolkata. The decor the ambience the music the crowd everything adds up to give you a very good time.
They have two floors to themselves...one is where you have the dance floor and the dj playing great tracks.. the one above is the open air one.
The decorations are at per the name..done with scraps. Even the seats are those of hospital beds and tables are like the ones attached to those beds at hospitals.
We had a problem with the service though.. the bill that we were given had items we didn't order for. Though they had changed the bill immediately after we notified them and they apologized, but this is not something that is supposed to happen. Price is a bit on the higher side.

This place is fun. If you’re planning to go out with your friends and having a good time, this is the place to be. We went in a group of five. The price of the alcohol is decided by its demand (something like a BSE). The food is a little above average, some part of our order was done excellently, while some was very average. We ordered the chili garlic butter mushroom, which I would recommend highly. The Pan fried chicken was also good, but could be better. We also ordered cheese balls, which I can make better at home. The interiors are done up in a fun way, literally like a well lit up scrap yard. Over all a fun place, will visit again.

Had visited this place on a Friday evening!
Its located towards the end of camac street if you enter from Park street! 
First point is theres no advertising whatsoever! Finding the place wl b a challenge!
TIP: the same building has “kaidi kitchen” which has enough advertising, so if you see that you know u r in the right building!

Ambience: that was great! 2 floors! Located on the 10th floor. One is the pub (indoor) and theres a roof top sitting arrangement!

We went to the pub! Ddnt try any food sadly! 
Tried hookah and liit! 
Prices are extremely reasonable when it comes to cocktails! And you need to follow the price chart (kinda a stock exchange) keeps dropping time to time!

The DJ to our surprise played bollywood at 9pm itself which made the crowd groove to its best! 

Overall a must visit!

I have learnt from my experience in the hospitality industry that a dining place might be able to survive with average food but never with poor service. Scrapyard has a long way to go when it comes to providing a good customer experience.

We were there for lunch last Sunday & were greeted coldly by a staff who seemed to have a problem with the way we were pronouncing "Scrapyard" (Yes, by mistake one of us said Screpyard). He had no business correcting the pronunciation but if he had to do it, he could have done it politely instead of using the tone of a strict English teacher.

Next, the tables for 4 are too small. Perhaps that's why they do not provide quarter plates and expect people to eat directly from the serving tray/ bowl. We literally had to keep the food on tissues while having it. On request, they obliged us with 4 quarter plates. But again, the round table was too small to accommodate 4 quarter plates, 1 serving tray and 4 mobile phones.

They do not offer water (not even regular water) and we had to ask for a mineral water bottle.

We requested to serve the mocktails without the ice cubes which they denied saying it's not possible!

Twice the waiters were about to serve food which was meant for some other table.
Also, instead of 1 dry chilli chicken that we ordered, they got us 2 portions by mistake and we had to remind them not to bill us incorrectly.

The 2.5 rating is for the good food and reasonable price. But considering the poor service, would not recommend this place to anybody.

The ambiance was very good but that was the only good thing about the place.. Otherwise everything was pathetic..
firstly staffs were inefficient and annoying.. We ordered pizza pasta cokes and hookah but The tables were too small to keep all the items.. We requested to shift to a bigger table but They were unwilling to shift it even though many tables were unreserved and empty.. They were Literally asking us to keep food on our hands.. 
They simply loot you.. The pizza was like a papad and it costed me 261.. And the pasta was tasteless like hospital's food.. I just left after that..
Very bad experience... Had very high expectations.. But it was just a flop... I don't recommend this place at all.. You will just waste your money..

The Place is located very centrally. Their Micro brewery has not yet started, but still they serve alcohol, which is averagely priced.

Food is also average nothing great. 

Overall nothing wow about the place.

I went there yesterday with my friend..
It is situated above kaidi kitchen, Camac Street.
Nice place to visit.
If u want to sit on roof top u must go after 6.:00PM, as it is open after that only.
Service is excellent..Food is awesome..
Ambiance is good..
I would have given 5star but what i dont like was the taste of music.. it was very bad...after a while it is intolerant...

Over all a nice place to visit..will recommend to visit after 6:00P.M and enjoy beautiful views of kolkata from roof top..

The much hyped place for now. This place is nice. It has both indoor and outdoor sitting area wide spread on two floors. They did not have any nice shakes or mocktails available. The food was okayish. The hookah was good. Alcohol is moderately priced always. The staffs are also good. Overall, a good place.

Starters are the smallest portions that dont taste so good. 6 fish fingers the size of French fries in a plate of fingers and 5 shrimp when asked for prawn. The cocktails are dismally made and are tough to get down. But one can survive on beer and Hukkah (or half of the menu that is available at any time.
They try to imitate stock exchange by flashing drinks and prices on a huge screen, which aren't live and hence don't work.

Was really enthused about coming to the place after the fancy name and nice pictures of the ambience, but majorly disappointed. Will not be coming again.

Saw this place on Zomato while looking for Rooftop options and loved the pictures. The big downside when we reached was them telling us that Rooftop is shut. I mean its ok if you shut it, its your lounge, but you should remove the place from rooftop category on Zomato and delete the picture which mis lead people. We were given a seating in the bar which was full of Hukka smoke. That was definitely not how we wanted to spend our evening so we decided to move to Monkey Bar. The moment we stepped out and told them we are leaving, Rooftop became open 😂 But we were told to place all the order in one go. May be they didn't have manpower to service guests on Rooftop. Weird but anyway we got the seating we wanted.

Ambience - As the name says, the entire place has a rusty junkyard feel to it. The ambience justified the name and the theme well. Service was allright. Nothing great, nothing bad.

Food and Drinks - I called them before going and asked them the price for a KF Beer. This is what the person on phone said - "Mam pint bottle right?" and i said "No, big bottle" to which he told me price changes as they have that stock exchange funda. Right now the price is 120/- and the max it goes is 200/-. I was surprised but thought its an exchange concept, may be it works that way in early hours with less crowd (I called arnd 5.30 pm). Now here comes Fuck Up No.2 - When we started ordering we were told they sell only Pints and there are no Big bottles. Now this call was (thankfully) made thru Zomato so the management can go back n hear the recording to confirm this. Coming to Food, this is what we ordered (Fuck up No.3 abt to happen)

• Scrapyard Platter - Good

• Scrapyard Chicken - Okeish. The chicken was hard and we had to use a Knife n Fork to piece it up and eat.

• Fish Fingers - I asked the service guy how many pieces come in a plate of Tikka - He said 5. I asked how many in FF - He said 8. Since we were 4 people I ordered the FF. He also told me there is a 3rd dish in Fish.I couldn't see it in the menu so he said he will check with the chef and confirm. After 15-20 mins of placing the order he comes n tells me that FF has only 6 pieces and the 3rd Fish Item is "Garlic Butter Prawn". I mean seriously!! I had no comments to make. We had to leave by 8 so we cudnt change the FF order either.

Overall if you want a good view of Park Street area and see the place for its Ambience, you can go once. But i don't think I will be going back again.

Would not have given the 1 star also if there was no minimum criteria, super rude staff with no sense at all. 
Firstly, they do not allow you to go to the floor above citing that there are no guests and when they finally do, they say that you can't take a particular table based on reservations. To top off their hypocrisy, they don't take reservations when you call them up. Not recommended for people who like to enjoy good service alongside food n ambience. 
In particular, the lady at the reception is extremely rude. Just imagine, if you get such a reception at this place what would be going on inside. Pathetic!!!

I would just take away 0.5 marks from the score card because of their late and time consuming services . Or else the place is just good junk from heaven made from scraps of all kinds . The decor goes nicely with the name , the lighting is not too lit nor too dimmed . We sat on the most spectacular place as we could over see our city from the corners . The night life's view was just mesmerising . The food was too good with all the quantity and quality kept in the right place . We were three and the dishes that we ordered was just content for us . We had cheese Maggie , Scrapyard chicken , Mustard Chicken Pizza where the chicken pieces were too succulent with the crispness kept intact . I must say it is a must try and we also had the citrus grilled chicken and also with brownie in ice cream in dessert . The whole meal was just awesome putting the ambience in mind however te dry day did not feel so hurting as the food was comforting . My rating will say the rest and  a big thumps up to this new start up and just work on your fast service and that's all . 
Thank you for such a lovely evening .

the best thing about this place is bar stock exchange where alcohol prices vary from day to day and if lucky one can find steller prices on drinks .the set up has two floors , the lower with high tables and upper has an open air section with a great view and washrooms I opted for SEX ON THE BEACH which i loved , RASPBERRY BASIL MARTINI with too strong flavours to like , along with pegs of antiquity blue and absolute for my friends. BRAINFREEZER hookah was excellent. The food was all well done and served fast , included SCRAPYARD CHICKEN , FISH FINGERS , MURGH AFGANI , PENNE IN WHITE SAUCE , NON VEG NOODLES , CHICKEN TIKKA PIZZA .While the servings and service easily scores a 3.5 on 5, the rooftop view adds for the extra .5

Went there on Ashtami with two of my best friends. The location of this lounge is not too difficult. The ambiance is great with an amazing skyline view. We had ordered teen paan hookah, crispy baby corn, chicken tikka pizza, and pene pasta with arabita sauce. Among drinks we had absolute vodka. Had a great Ashtami. :)

This has, hands down, got to be one of the best ambience in the city. Located on the tenth floor and penthouse themed, the full glass walls provide mind blowing experience. The interiors are all wooden. Good music and good seatings. The place is actually a duplex. The lower floor has the dj proper and the upper is a quieter lounge with seating options under the open sky. This place is amazing to hang out or for nightlife. The dance floor is very small though so if you want to hit the dance, this place isn’t for you. 
The food was just okay.  I ordered nachos chat which tasted fine. But was really disappointed by pasta. I didn’t order a third after that. Sheesha was good as well. 
The staff is extremely friendly and very professional. The service is swift despite a full house, I must say, which is extremely appreciable.  The dynamic pricing of liquor is a different, cool concept.  What blew me away with service and the decor really set me back with food.

This place never lets me down. It has been quite a few times i have been there. So as a book cannot be judged by its cover, we cannot judge it if we haven't visited here more then once. The place is extremely dumbstrucking and it makes you feel so like of a partyanimal. The drinks and food are so tasty and good. We had ordered pizza, gratin and quite a few stuff and scrapyard did not let us down. The staff and the authorities were so connecting. Thankyou scrapyard for such a amazing day.

I had heard a lot about this place before visiting it. 
Even now, you will get to hear their name from your friends. 
Already famous by their name, Scrapyard is the perfect party spot. 
Live music, ambience, food, everything is upto the mark. 
Just that, we didn't get a proper table to sit.. We managed to sit at the side adjusting our chairs and plates. The staff needs to improvise on this part. Rest, everything is fine. Do visit!

This place is one of the newest in the town, but sadly not worth a recommendation.

The place is located next to Industry House Petrol Pump and one may face some problems accessing this place because of no signboards outside. The building lift is very narrow and is sufficient for only 4 people at a time. The outlet has 2 zones, 1 on the 10th Floor and 1 on the rooftop. The 10th floor outlet is poorly planned. The tables, seating stools and bar counter are all stuffed into a seemingly small space. The space crunch is REAL and too many people make it look like a local train compartment. The DJ concept is good but he's too close to the tables and the music gets slightly irritating because of the proximity. They have the stock exchange concept on alcohol which is again not implemented well. The staff is courteous but there is not much they can do. Food Portion sizes are small compared to the price being charged, which left us really disappointed. Food isn't very great taste wise as well. They abruptly empty tables out and make space for people to dance close to the DJ which is a kind of a makeshift floor, again only adding to the mess. We ordered Pizza, Pasta and Babycorn but none were very great. Seems like the cafe is too busy only copying BSE without actually working on it's basics. We ordered the Virgin Mojito too which was lousily made and was almost like fresh lime soda. Their rooftop outlet is slightly bigger, has more space and the speakers are distant but Kolkata weather will make you sweat without AC and so the rooftop isn't an option. All in All, This is a big No-No for me. Save your money, time and peace of mind for so many other outlets on the same street. This one is a scrapyard for REAL.

This place is just Wow. 
We got a table at the rooftop and the weather added bonus to the ambience, plus this place has got lovely food. We has the Nachos which is unique of here (tasted a bit like Papri Chaat to me :p), Pizza was soo good that we ordered for one more serving. The white Sauce pasta was Cheese Overloaded too.
However I just rated the place 2.5 and that is because of the attitude of the waiters and pathetic service. You have to call them minimum 4times to place your order. Only two waiters on a full house RoofTop. 
As much as I liked the food, The Service equally disgusted me.

Cool Place. Located in Camac Street, it shares the same building with Kaidi Kitchen. We went there today in between office lunch hours.

The ambience was good with some nice music. They offer a variety of cuisines but the choices are a bit limited.

We ordered Scrapyard Chicken, Ching Ming Chicken, Garlic Butter Prawn, Spaghetti Aglio Olio, Mustard Chicken Pizza, Wok Tossed Noodles, Chilli Chicken, Grilled Fish with sauteed vegetables. Every dish was well presented and tasted really good. 

On the downside, the service is really poor. They are serving the food alright, but you have to ask for the plates to eat. They also took their own time to serve the food. 

I will recommended it for the food & ambience, but you should visit the place when you have much time on your hand.

The ambiance is great but they really need to work on few things i.e. Hospitality and quantity.
We ordered Babycorn, Nachos, Chilly Paneer, Cheese Garlic Bread, Pesto Veg Pizza, Penne Pasta with Arabita Sauce with Jagerbombs and Ballentines Finest.
The quantity of food was so less, they literally served 10 pieces of Nachos and 4 pieces of Paneer. Seriously ?
And over call they told me that they don't take prior reservations, so I said okay. Fair enough.
But when we were sitting on a table, after an hour a waitress came over and asked us to vacant the table as this table is reserved. If the table was reserved, why the hell did you asked to sit on that table without any prior notice ? Is this how you treat your customers ? 
It's a request to the Management to be more organised and serve their customers in a sustainable way. That's all for now , hopefully in my next visit, surprise us with some improvement.

Scrapyard is located on the 10th & 11th floor of the same building as that of Kaidi Kitchen, Camac Street. Visited this place last satirday. There was a huge rush over there. We literally had to wait for half an hour for a table just for two! Coming to interior, the place has been done up in a cool way. The ambience on the lower level was perfect for partying while the upper one was more of a cafe kind. There is an outdoor terrace as well, which hasn't started opersting yet but surely serves as a photo clicking area with it's funky walls. Will visit next once the maddening rush dies down a bit!

More like crapyard. Great ambiance and sort of prompt service, sort of, why because initial service was fast but as we progressed with our orders it took more and more time. Coming to the food, we had chicken popcorn and pan fried Chicken. KFC serves better quality popcorn than this place. The pan fried chicken was above average. Then we ordered pesto chicken and mustard chicken pizza. It took its own sweet time to arrive. The Pizzas were good, thin crust good flavoring loads of chicken. I wish they were a bit generous with the cheese. Lastly we ordered grilled fish with vegetables. It took ages to arrive at our table. And bland is the correct word to describe it. No seasoning whatsoever. Fish as well as the vegetables were bland. All show and no go. Coming to the cocktails oh man probably the worst i have ever had we had ordered a couple of old fashioned, long island ice tea and raspberry basil tini. They added orange juice to old fashioned, are you insane? The Long island ice tea was horrible.
Only recommend for hookah and regular drinks and nothing else.

Worst experience! Had been to this place a few days back with a thought that we would have a gala time here. But alas, it did not happen. The food they served was not up to the standard and the quantity was less as well. We ordered tandoori prawn and fish finger along with sisha  (which was okay) and cocktails. We tried Long Island Iced Tea and Scrapyard Ocean. Scrapyard Ocean charged us around 1250 rupees which was truly worst and we did not like the LIIT as well.

Overall it's not a place for those who looking for some good food and drinks. I won't recommend this place to anyone.

A highly unruly place, my brother went there sometime back, he drank alcohol from another club and came to this place bcoz he wanted to go to a new place. The manager is so ridiculous that he says if you've drunk and come we can't allow you to sit. No clubs mind people pre drinking and coming but this club has a problem. They didn't serve us water and forced to pay service charges! Thumbs down guys.

The place is good but i didn't find anything special, it's just the other pubs in Kolkata. 
This place has 2 types of sitting arrangement  1 on the 10th floor and  another one on the terrace which has a outdoor and a indoor sitting arrangement. 
N decor is good.
Food is 4.5 on 5
Hookah was good till the end so it should be 5 on 5.

But yes surely will find a place in d outdoor.
👌👌

Great place but i love the outdoor rather than the indoor.
In my next visit m gonna experience the outdoor seating.


Decor is nice.
Awesome lights!! 
Service is good even in the rush. 

Prices are a bit high. 

Indoor seating is a bit congested.


Lacking in one thing that is there is no dance floor!! 

Food is great 👌🏻

Gonna visit again👍🏻

Scrapyard is the best thing that has happened to
"The City Of Joy" in recent times. I fell in love with the decor the moment i entered the place. I loved the beer which was fruity and light. It has one of the best hookah in town. Service and food commendable.
Waiting for their brewery which is yet to open.
A must visit for everyone.

The best thing about the place is the location and the valet parking. Other than that, Scrapyard screams of the mediocrity we Calcuttans have probably gotten used to. The menu, for instance, has nothing improvisational or experimental on it, and the food portions are quite small - not worth the money you're paying for it. The cocktail menu can be revamped and redone with some research on global cocktails and with a decent bit of promotion, they can have the most outstanding list in town. The live music is far better than the DJ playing Bollywood trash and pop junk on loop - you could organise jazz nights and alternate music nights too for the masses, since you attract a good crowd. The interiors are well done and minimal but don't they all look nearly the same? The only improvisation being the "hospital beds" on the terrace for when the weather is good. There's a whole lot of mediocrity in your product, although the courteous staff manages to shadow that pretty well.

New place in town and went in with Zero expectations on a Saturday evening and was quite surprised with the footfall the place as there was a long queue. Luckily we got a table on the Top deck which is the rooftop and the view from there is pretty amazing. Contrary to a few reviews I found the staff polite and friendly and they even moved us downstairs upon requesting as we wanted to enjoy the music. The music is better than most other places that I have been to in Kolkata. The food was amazing but the only thing I would have liked is if the portions were a bit bigger. That's where I have taken away half a mark but it's not too big a deal. With the microbrewery coming up soon as I got to know from the management this place is soon going to top the charts I'm sure.

Been there number of times, must say they do keep note of every single details.
During weekdays awesome lounge music, which actually makes you feel like you are spending some quality time with your pals along with delicious menu and cocktails.
And during weekends they make crowd go mad by their awesome music which includes english retro, old school bollywood at midnight and commercial music before midnight. 
Coming to food, you don't need to go anywhere after your drinks as they have quality and delicious food.
A perfect place to go.

Worst place to ever visit if you are going bon weekends. They won't let you in unless you have an authentic source. Moreover they will make you stand for an hour. The staff are also very arrogant there. Been there for 3 weekend and returned. If you plan to visit weekday the gates are always open for you. But still service is very slow. Worst place to hang around. Instead visit what's in the name or Monkey bar nearbuy.

The food quality is so gross that my friends (that accompanied me) and I are suffering with food poisoning post the lunch in this god forsaken place. 
The menu is not that great as well leaving you with very few options. 
Drinks are very mediocre. Red sangria was disgusting though margarita was still tolerable( but surely not worth it). 
Would never recommend this place to anyone.

We were four of us and we were made to wait an entire 2.5hours and weren't even let inside. Ultimately we had to sit on the rooftop. We had been telling them constantly to let us in once it gets vacant. People coming after us had been let in but we weren't. At the end the receptionist (there were two of them) were like no you cant go in and that too in a rude tone.
Though food and ambience was above par.
The behaviour of the receptionist was way too annoying.
No grudges about the place.

Amazing location. Right at the end entry of camac street. The bartenders were good, the music and ambience were top notch. We ordered Baby Corn, Chicken Tikka and Spaghetti, apart from the drinks. The food could've been better. The staff were really a pain to handle, as we had to wait at the bar counter for almost an hour although the place was relatively empty. The staff really bring in their A game if they are to compete against the nearby Monkey Bar, M Bar, BSE etc.

Cool ambience and nice footfall, and that's pretty much it. 

There was no innovation in the menu card. The food was pretty ordinary and commonplace. The live band was atrocious. They were playing some completely outmoded songs, not syncing with the mood. No innovation in the bar menu as well. Seemed like a student and immature crowd hang out place. 

The pocket pinch was also on the higher side, which was not at all worth it.

The food's taste as well as quality were good. We had ordered a Saute Veg, Pizza, Mushroom Burmani and a few drinks which were all goods. The terrace area has specially good seating arrangement with views of enitre Kolkata. Only thing that lacked was the service which was pathetic. Even simple orders took almost 45 mins to an hour to be served. Also the waiters were literally taking away plates and dishes with little food still left in them. Maybe due some utensils shortage on a busy saturday evening which was unexpected from such a good place.

My advice would be to be prepared before hand for the long wait on all food and drink orders.

On the tenth floor above Kaidi Kitchen, the location is bound to make this place become popular very soon. We went on a weekday and the place was pretty full.

There are two floors: one that resembles Shisha in every way possible - teenagers, music, ambience. The floor above has an open space which is a show stealer. Food was pretty good and service okay too. There are no prices written on the menu but the place isnt a pinch on the pocket. Nice place to go with your gang and drink off.

(0.5 extra for the place being pretty decently priced)

Now the main drawback of the place is its staff!!!! Extremely mismanaged, nobody knows where to seat the guests its soo over crowded that the staff is running helter skelter to deliver order.Meanwhile 2 ladies who were probably the receptionists were fighting at the top of their voices right in front of the guests.So much for a warm welcome😂😂😂

Not too excited for a second visit

Had heard a lot about the place and hebce decided to visit it with friends.
We visited the place on Saturday evening. Firstly, the most pissing off activity was by the PR, who, the moment we sat came up and asked Mam, 1 hour is enough for you people? We were direct in saying that it would depend on us and not on you. 
Then we ordered a Mixed Sauce Penne, A veggie topping Pizza, Hakka Noodles and Paneer Tikka. 
Honestly, the Menu doesnt have a wide variety, neither the food was great nor the quanitity as one can see in the pictures.
The only reason for the ratings are the Hookah and the Ambience. 
Hookah was 10 on 10. Perfect till the end. 
Ambience would be 10 again because of the crowd and the DJ👌
Visit again? No. Expensive and hyped.

Scrapyard is the new addition to the pubs in Kolkata, it is well made. The ambiance will definitely give you a kick to drink. It is a stock exchange bar, so the price of the liquor keeps changing.
Only had beer here since the server told me that pizza wasn't available before 5:30pm. So I cancelled the order.
What I found a bit astonishing that the bill wasn't made at the price at which I had called for the beer but at the current price. I don't understand what is the point of the stock exchange then, if your going to bill the customers when the price is sky rocketing.
Overall a place you can visit one time.

Tall claims..... Less substance.... As a beer lover I really get put off if a microbrewery is always in the "yet to start" category and to add on to it, the imported beer section only exists in the menu!! I admit I do have a negative bias as far as domestic beer brands are concerned (BIRA being an obvious exception).

While the decor has least resemblance for the place to look like a scrapyard except for some serving pan... The place is divided into 3 section - 2 indoor and one outdoor. While the outdoor one is without an AC the bed kinda setting takes care of the discomfort which one may feel coz of the AC not being there.

I would rather rate it 4 for the food quality. Butter Garlic mushroom is a must have. One can even try Nacho Chat.. Which in my opinion is a nice experiment the chef has done. Though I found the salt content to be on a higher side in all the food items, which can still be managed. The staff is hospitable but the menu is digital hence no customization is possible. We wanted an egg wok tossed noodles but there menu only had a veg one and was hence refused. Common adding an egg is the easiest thing on the planet. Later on they agreed provided we are willing to pay extra (Rs 150) for scrambled egg as a separate dish.. Which IMO was not justified

The service is very very fast. But the place was jam packed. Loved the live music concept and the singer sang Despacito so that was like a cherry on the cake. If you want to go anywhere on a Sunday evening then Scrapyard it is. The food is okay but the ambience is amazing, can ignore the few flaws for the fantastic atmosphere that they offer. 👍🏻

Obviously this rating would invite some debates.
The location is perfectly awesome and we expected the food to be great too.
All of us were disappointed with the quality of service by the staff and also the quantity of food to be specific.
The staff was veryyy slow (even when the restaurant was just half full). They had no idea about the food in the menu, nor did they know anything about the portion of the food.
Everything kept apart, the quantity of the food is wayyyyyyyyyyyy too less for the price!
Totally not worth it.We ordered Virgin Mojito (which was just lime juice), Scrapyard fries (just okay), Veg Gratin (one small bowl sufficient for only 1 person or max 2), Mediterranean Pizza (the best we ate there). We didn't order any more food though we returned hungry.

T2 lead me to visit this place.. though wanted to visit the level up one but due to timing have to take a place at down level..
Lovely ambience.. lovely food.. well approach staff.. unsatisfied part was the quantity of the food was too less..
Not supporting the 9% service charge..

The place is located on the 10th floor of Kaidi Kitchen building..
I visited the place on a sat eve..fully packed still they tried to accomodate us .
The waiters were quite courteous and the best was the DJ..
The live music was veey groovy and tapping..
Superb crowd and very fast service

The hookah and the food was jus upto mark.
Twe ordered Teen Pan rose for hokkah.
Scrapy special fries were too spicy could have been better
Pizza was nice on the thin crust..
The alcohol service were very quick but they @din't have BIRA91
The town brewery still does not have BIRA..and drought beer not yet started..
All in all new place happening and the music stole my heart..

The rating is one less because of the behaviour of one of the staff to avoid serving us wuthout paying..
Please work on this..Customers must not go unhappy due to creation of a an unecessary situation

Ok so visited the next happening place with my bae 's at around 7pm. And I was surprised to find the whole place buzzing and bumbling with youngsters( Yes!!! All college goers ). "You have to wait ,all seats are full" this is how we were greeted after taking the slowest elevator to the 10th floor. Now 7pm is not the time to get a packed eating/drinking house. So it was a surprise.The place is quite big having happening aura. Somehow after waiting for 15min we we're allowed to enter only to b left standing next to bar and wait for the chairs to b emptied.But we dint mind seeing the ambience. The name does Justice to it's decor. Upbeat and rocking. The food menu features some interesting snacks (less options) and drinks menu features perfectly mixed classic cocktails.The dj surely was a Justin beiber fan (like me) spinning @ some amazing tracks.After taking few shots one wud b dancing and grooving In their SEATs (no dance floor) it's loud brash and Sooper fun place.

North Indian food specially breads - nan kulcha, roti were horrible, prepared along with mocktails & served 45 minutes later as Tandoor cook had to catch train to home. It's their problem, not ours. Otherwise drinks starters & desert were excellent.

Ambiance is decnt but service and variety in menu is no where close to being rated positively.
Also, the staff is too over friendly for a hospitality cause.

located above kaidi kitchen a new addition to the city of joy..
shisha was good along with staff service..
food was okay but the quantity was very less making it overpriced..
ambience was okayish, music was great..
things that pinch you is that you are forced to pay service charge @7% along with gst @18%
so if we see burden becomes 25%
rooftop was not that great and ambience can be worked upon..

Would rate this place negative if the option existed ,
We ordered two non veg dishes which were absolutely horrible to taste & they lacked the sense of the presentation too. 
The service here is absolutely absurd .
Yes , teething issues happen but not this bad.
Also the layout of the place is pretty weird , tough to identify the ideology behind the place.
Lord save the people in Kolkata from the music , it is so old , not even funny.

The ambiance is aweful and is so over priced
The food items are horrible.. Wat ever written in menu and wat served is totally different. 
Tried nachos which was horrible and i think i had the worst pizza in my life.. Cocktails and mocktails very terrible and would never suggest people to go there
Hookah was also bad

Scrapyard is on the 10th floor in the same building where kaidi kitchen is situated & itself belongs to the Kaidi Kitchen group but unlike kaidi kitchen here they offer non veg as well. This place offers you good & tasty food coupled with great ambience. When we visited there was live music going on. The decor is different as compared to other cafes in the town & compliments with its name "scrap yard'.

Finally, a new place in Calcutta to get high on. Its very conveniently located above Kaidi Kitchen on Camac Street, a perfect place for party goers, as it is situated next to the other go-to party places in Calcutta, very huge on space and even better with their decor and graffiti. Got super attentive staff, however, they could do better with the portion of their food and also the quality, the food is super bland and has the worst nachos ever with no add ons, the platter was the only saviour. Wont recommend going more than once.

The place is very new so should be at its best 
But it was not had  flaws 
The decor is a little to dark it's not lit up or bright 
Luckly the staff I was dealing with was very nice very sweet and kind I think was the only upside 
Now comming to the food and drinks the drinks are reasonable as they are the bar stock concept which keep on changing 
BUT THE FOOD DISAPPOINTED ME THE MOST I had the Scrapyard special Chicken which  was to begin with very less in quantity and the taste was not any thing different or special it just tasted like dry chili chicken with garnish of lime on top

Went there today , the interior was good but their sofa sitting was not good , it seemed the budget on sofa felt short. 
Now coming to the service , only one word pathetic.
The ground staff seemed to be roaming in the garden and enjoying the beauty.
The waiter were not at all trained , how to serve and take orders.
We have to repeat the order each and everytime , they do not punch the order .
We waited for 30 mins and after asking about the order they replied , it is not punched yet and if you want than have to wait for 15 mins.
The name SCRAPYARD totally matches the theme , sevice and food quality completly a piece of scrap.

So this place is located above kaidi kitchen on 10th floor along with a rooftop section. The rooftop section is most average. The view from there is really nice, but interiors need to be worked upon. The ambience and feel of the 10th floor is really nice. The staff too is very courteous. We ordered for a shisha, an Indian platter, Crispy chilli baby corn and an lit. Everything is somewhere between ok and good, nothing extra ordinary. If they work a bit more on the food and shisha, this place might be one of the in demand places. The service also was quite fast, specially considering the fact that it had more than 90 percent occupancy.

Pathetic food and mocktails. Waitors don't even understand the difference between a platter and a single dish starter. We had order a kebab platter and were just given a shitty single veg kebab starter which was horrendous to say the least, white sauce pasta was appalling too and the mocktail of some lichi flavour was so obnoxious that it could make anyone a diabetic.
Scrapyard if you make people wait for a table then make sure you provide that quality which makes it worth waiting for.
Lastly the only good take away was it's ambience so one point for that.
Pull up your socks and improve the quality and service or else your name says it all "SCRAPYARD".

The ambience is good. Music is okayish. However, the service is very slow. You have to call for a waiter more for more than 10 minutes because they are busy catering the needs of some "important" people. The food is good but the quantity is very little and it's a little overpriced. The one thing which upset me the most is the fact that we are being forced to pay service charge that too @7% which is quite unfair because we have to pay GST @18% but on top of that 7% service charge is a little too much.

Had a super time with my bunch of friends on a Saturday night on our visit to this long awaited wonderful new addition to the city! The place has good capacity and is set up in two floors, which includes the terrace area giving awesome view of the city! There is live liquor auction bar similar to that of BSE ! Light is perfect, the food is amazing, the DJ and the ambience blends in perfectly with the overall experience! Way to go !! ✌️✌️

Ambience 💯💯
Food served here is lip smacking and will suit to the taste buds of any foodie.😍😍
Sisha served is priced reasonably and is good too. 🔥
Staff is generous and helps with the order selection too. 💛
They lose the 0.5 rating for the food quantity which is comparatively less as for the prices. Otherwise it's a great place to dine in.

New addition to the city !
Location - camac street crossing just above kaidi kitchen beside industry house.
Upper hand - Valet Parking
Interiors - European style - spotlessly amazing
This place also has a auction bar like BSE & WIDN
I had ordered for a drink ( cant recall the name but it was good, please see my images ) & seekh kebab. Both were recommended by their staff only & were too good too.
Good music & ambience - liked it

This is their second day and hence we called in before reaching the place to check availability for a table for 3. The receiver ensured that if we come now we will get one. We reached within ten minutes. 
Upon arrival, a lady at the gate says they are out of tables. When I told her about the call she enquired whether a girl received I said no and then she is like good that means I am not responsible. This isn't a response I expect from someone who is re-presenting the place. Further as if to give us probably a 'gift' she says she can let us see the place. 

The manner and arrogance with which she was talking anyone could be a better substitute for her.

Located above the famous kaidi kitchen camac street. The place has 2 floors and even a terrace area. The interiors are good and the food quality is very good with nominal charges as per the place. We had mocktails, hukka, crispy babycorn, veg seekh kebab and a pizza. Every item was worth the price and specially the babycorn had huge quantity. Will visit again for sure.
