Small joint in baghajatin near Ram Thakur asram. The staff are polite as well as inexperienced. They take more than 30 mins to serve brownie with chocolate sauce & ice cream.

This is a nice small joint for students and foodies.
The food quality is quite good but it does need some touchups..
Price is quite low as compared to other cafes.
This is locate just beside Ram Thakur mandir ashram on baghajatin road.
The staffs are very friendly too and the time to serve is also quick.

Will surely visit again to try some more items.

Located near baghajatin more, precisely just opposite of Ram Thakur Seva Ashram, Baghajatin stn. Road. A small cafe with simple decor. Friendly ambience, perfect for college students. Besides pizza, burger, sandwiches, they have shakes, cream bell ice cream and definitely confectionery and savory items.
Food:
1. Barbeque chicken wings.
2. Non veg. Cheese pasta.
3. Non veg Combo (Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken, Salad and Coke)
4. Chicken Pizza.
Each food was tasty, specially compared to the price. Wings worked well as an appetizer. Pizza had enough cheese in ‚Çπ114! Pasta was loaded with chicken pieces. Combo was sufficient for one person. Overall total bill was near about ‚Çπ400 only!
Looking for more additions in the menu in next visit and seriously would like to taste the rest items. The cakes looked delicious! üòâ

This Cafe is famous for its Quality of Food and Service at a very reasonable rate i.e it can just fit into a student's budget. 
You can try Chicken wings, Pasta, Pizza, cofee etc. 
Veg Pizza is for just Rs. 75 and it's really tasty and worth for your money.

Today i am very much disappointed about the service,we have been sitting and enjoying our pizza ,suddenly they started cleaning floor and switch off the fan & ac at a same time,when i said that please switch on the fan/ac,nobody bother to listen or reply and that was very insulting,i asked both of them who was in the service name suvendu & the other guy,they make faces and doesnt bother. 
Newayz i am very old customer and often visit to your place,if this would happen in future than i must say...i wont b visit it again....very pathetic and i am very very upset about the attitude and approach for the service people.

The cafe is a really nice place to hangout at. Since, I live nearby, I visit almost everyday. Although, it has limited seating area, the warm behavior of the waiting staff make up for it. They are well trained and make the place very comfortable to spend time at. The only down point to that cafe is that the female employ is rude and irresponsible. she must be responsible enough to respond to the costumers when no one else is in the reception. (she just looks up and gets back to her phone as if she has nothing to do with the cafe). Since, I don't have the email id of the customer care or the management, i have no choice but to write to the feedback here.

Located just beyond bhagajatin more, Cafe Drifter is a small cafe tucked peacefully at one side of the road. It's a small cafe with limited seating which may pose a problem for larger groups, but the small area couldn't sabotage it's coziness. Coming to the food, we ordered two medium chicken pizzas, a spaghetti in cheese sauce with chicken, a fresh chicken burger and chicken and cheese sandwich. For drinks we had a chocolate milk shake with ice cream and a cold coffee with ice cream. The pizzas was the winner among all with soft yes crisp crust and right amount of gooey cheese. The cheese sauce in the spaghetti was a little bit floury. Burger and the sandwich were average; it can be more appetizing if served with french fries instead of raw carrots and beetroot. The shakes were really yummy in taste but can be more presentable. Another plus point is, this place is really pocket-friendly and can be a crowd-puller for many students. A place to hang out with friends on a lazy day and catch up on life over coffee and food.

This is a small place near baghajatin more. There are very limited seats and the place feels a bit congested. The ambience and staff is average. The only good thing I found here the food which came at a pocket-friendly price. I'd say this a good place for a quick snack. Would recommend the chicken cheese pasta with extra cheese if you are a cheese lover !

Location : Off Raja S.C. Mullick Road. 
We ordered Sandwiches , a burger and a strawberry milkshake. The Sandwiches were undercooked and the milkshake was badly presented. The staff took long to take the order and deliver, even though we were the only ones there. .
Not coming back here.

Went there all alone . I think I really wanted to be a food blogger. Jokes apart the cafe is good with lovely interiors. It's a pocket friendly joint. I had a bacon salad it tastes pretty obvious as all salads taste nothing special . Next time I am planning to have their grilled chicken with mustard sauce.

Visited it for the first time 2days back. Well, I am a cold coffee fanatic & I loved the cold coffee with ice-cream they served..loved the tomato & cheese sandwich as well.. However I think the sitting area needs to be revamped. Staff was really friendly n courteous ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Thumbs up & looking fwd to rating it 5 on subsequent visits. And yes, recommend this place to everyone in the vicinity!

This cafe is really close to my house and its been a few months that it has opened. I have been there a number of times and recently saw it on zomato so thought of reviewing it. I have tried their pastas, pizzas, chicken wings, cold coffee, blue lagoon, desserts and cookies. All of them taste delicious and the pocket pinch is also less.

Only downside is the space is really small but still it has a cozy feeling. Also there is outdoor seating. I recommend this place strongly.

This cozy little cafe is situated near the RamThakur Ashram in Baghajatin or the road towards Baghajatin Station Road, to be precise. Can house a max of 7-10 people at a go and maybe 2/3 people in the outdoor seating. This is surely a paradise for the college students like us.
Had opted for a Cold coffee with ice cream, a veg pizza, cream cookie pie, one chocolate cup and a fish fry, and believe me it costed me just ‚Çπ325/-. My tastebuds were in love with every of those items.
The staff is very well versed with their menu and are very courteous.
HAPPY EATING, FOODIES!
