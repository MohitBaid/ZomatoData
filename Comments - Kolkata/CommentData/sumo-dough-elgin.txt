We had a Penne Pasta in Arabiata Sauce..It was good in quantity and tasted well whereas we were little disappointed with the pizza we had ordered which was not that great specially its crust.. Overall a decent experience.

This place is just beside Bhaggu...
One evening me along with my foodie mates of Team Panch Phoron went to this place to explore the sumptuous food.
Okay, all we know that shakes and coolers are for summers..But those who love to have going against the flow, I'll tell them to try Oreo Shake, Kitkat shake and Mint Shake..Ooops I was just forgetting about the Strawberry Shake... 😎
Anyways for starters we had Brocoli Blended Soup...It was so good that it's tough to express the feeling..This dish was served with toasted bread...
Then we had the Signature Pizza...I must tell you that if you love Thin Crust, this will not disappoint you even if you also are a hard core Non-Vegetarian like me..
We had tasted the white sauce pasta also..it was as good as others..
Then we had baked potato and cheese burst bun stuffed with some vegies..(I just forgot the exact names)
But after finishing the starter and main course I was zapped when I saw the Chocolate Tiramisu and Blueberry Cheese Cake. Trust me, as these are my favourites I'll not write more about this cause obviously I'll write being biased.  I'll just tell GO AND HAVE IT..   

over all the experience was so good..
sometimes we the hard core non vegetarians should go and taste from those place who serve strictly Veg food.. 
 
I love food and I'm a Panch Phoron forever... ✌✌

So, I discovered this new vegetarian Italian cafe through zomato which is near bhawanipur college and it turned out to be good.
We ordered :
*Ravioli creamy cheese (5/5) : I can say this is the best item on their menu. I recommend this item to everyone. This is basically raviolli (small pasta envelope) in lots of cheese. Must try.
*12 spicy margaritas pizza (3/5) : it was good just like other restaurant.
*Jalapenos cheese poppers (2.5/5) : tried this small balls of jalapenos and cheese. It was also good.
This is the kind of veg restaurant that non vegetarian should not miss just because it's vegetarian, or else you'll be missing out on that homemade cheese ravioli !

A small little place with some good food. Located on the main road, access is easy, and they specialize in some great vegetarian dishes. The prices and quantity is fair with a great ambience and good service. I tried the Pasta, Blueberry Cheese Cake and the Soda, and all well were above average.

A perfect place to hangout with your friends, and spend some quality time!

This is a relatively spacious vegetarian restaurant at Elgin, located at the opposite of Ray st.
The ambience is quite nice and soothing, it's a fairly large place with good music and great service, the staff here attended us immediately and guided us through the menu on enquiry as well.
The food didn't take long to arrive, we ordered everything in their Regular quantity and it well sufficing in my opinion. The quantity was good, my dish tasted absolutely delicious while the other, the Asparagus Risotto, was great too but I've had better elsewhere as well.
What we ordered :-
1. Riso a la Funghi - must try
2. Asparagus Risotto
3. Regular Coke

I'll visit this place soon again and I'll update my review then.

Overall, this is a very nice place and I had a lovely experience and I'd definitely recommend it to everyone else.

Was out shopping in forum and was quite famished. We decided to visit sumo dough after reading good reviews 
Our order 
Mushroom soup 
Toblerone shake 
Verdura ravioli in ariabatta sauce 
Mongolian noodles in hot garlic sauce 
Of the above only mushroom soup n the shake was good 
They said the ravioli had six pieces but all I could see was a soggy mess
And to add to the disappointment was the Mongolian noodles 
I agree Mongolian noodles in hot garlic sauce is supposed to be on the spicier side but atleast it should be edible spicy 
The dish was burning 
And after bringing this to their notice they replaced it 
And they just added tomato ketchup in it and served us 
With the bill they gave us a complimentary coke to compensate, which we told them to take back 
So overall it was quite a turn off .

i visited this place only to try their home made ravioli  . being a non veg lover  i must admit their ravioli tasted very good . the arabiata sauce was well prepared and much spicy. but i feel the quantity could have been much more at that cost . the sumo bowl of ravioli contaied only 4 5 pieced of it. ambiance is very good.

Sometimes you ask yourself why you should visit a vegetarian joint but you maynot find a perfect answer nevertheless Sumo Dough will surely give you plenty of reasons why should hop into this place. Located in the premises of Sanjay Saraf institution just beside bhowanipore college it can be missed in a blink of an eye. Limited seating arrangements welcome to some great Italian wonders which will fill your mouth with surprises. Team Panchphoron went one fine evening to taste some if their signature dishes which goes like this-
•Milkshakes: Strawberry Banana Shake, Oreo Brownie Mint Oreo Shake, Kitkat Shake.
🔅 Oreo shake had a touch of mint flavour, kitkat shake was very regular but strawberry shake took me by surprise it was best of the lot, got sliced strawberry which added a kick to it.
•Starter: Broccoli-Al-A-Capuccino, Bruchetas, Classic Caesar Salad, Masala Cheese Herb Bread, Jalapeno Cheese Poppers, Baked Stuff Potatoes.
🔅The soup was very creamy, soup lover will find it delightful. The iceberg lettuce of the salad was simple and nice. Baked potatoes was a little unique both by its looks and taste. Cheese popper and Herb bread was a bit let down.
•Mains: Pasta, Homemade Ravioli and Sumo Dough Pizza.
🔅Customisation option are available in all the three main dishes. For the pasta there is choice for type of pasta & the sauce. The ravioli is creamy as hell, it will be cheese lovers paradise. The pizza was topped with various toppings even the portion was scrumptious. All three dishes are recommended.
•Dessert: Blueberry Cheese Cake and Kahlua Tiramisu.
🔅One can skip anything for these two showstopper. As the saying goes love at first sight can be aptly fit into it. Full marks given for presentation and garnishing. The cheesecake had a tangy taste to it with chunks of berries whereas the tiramisu had a strong flavour of rum which added a punch to it. One very strong reason to visit here. Highly Recommended.
No doubt amongst the other italian joints Sumo Dough surely hold its glory. With minimal decor but mouth watering delicacies you will surely leave the place with a smile on your face.
P.S.: Their newly opened sibling is Kath Koyla situated just above it.

Yday we went to Sumo Dough the place is neat tidy cool but trust me the drawback is their quantity. We ordered White Sause pasta summo size which they said would come in quantity but the outcome was worst. The quantity could only fill tummy of 1person. So in name of summo quantity they r fooling u. Same goes to pizza and rivoli. Even their shakes does not have taste.

This place is rightly named as vegetarians paradise. Being a hardcore non vegetarian, I was completely stunned to taste such ravishing vegetarian Italian dishes. They've all sorts of Italian delicacies from pastas to raviolis to risottos. Their flavours and the presentation is really commendable. Also the ambience is very soothing with some eccentric interiors and light music. All their dishes were cooked to perfection. Had each of one them to the last bite. It was absolutely ravishing. The service was fast as well and the staff was very courteous. Coming to the food we had - first we settled for some soups & starters,thus we opted for  - 
• Brocolli Al-a-cappuccino 
• Olive Madness Bruschettas (recommended)
• Classic Baked Mushrooms (recommended) 
• Baked Stuffed Potato 
In main course, we ordered - 
• Asparagus Risotto 
• Cream Cheese Ravioli 
• Fettuchini Pesto sauce Pasta (definitely recommended) 
• 12" spicy margerita Pizza (this was super yummy)
Coming to the best part of the meal, the desserts, we choose - 
• Blueberry Cheesecake (absolutely delish, recommended for sure) 
• Chocolate Cheesecake 
Both the desserts were really scrumptious and has a perfect balance of sweetness. 
Overall, great place to enjoy some authentic Italian dishes and enjoy a calm ambience. Had a wonderful experience.

A wonderful place located in Elgin road , Sumo dough is the answer to all your evening munching calls. 

We started with mushroom Al-a cappuccino soup - thick and hot soup , made me forget the chilly weather outside. Very creamy and tasty.

For starters, we had  olive madness bruschettas , which were simply amazing. 
Classic baked mushroom - The mushrooms were deliciously soft and so yummy.
Silver beat rissoto ... The aroma , the taste and the presentation. Just one word..perfect.

For main course we had Asparagus rissoto , my favorite from the lot. Do try this if u r at sumo dough.
Crany cheesy ravioli in mixed sauce , so creamy and so yummy ... Melts in ur mouth and keeps u wanting for more.
Fette chini pasta which was again superb.
And spicy margerita pizza , one of the best pizzas I've had without doubt.

Lastly we had KitKat shake , the presentation is commendable.
And chocolate cheesecake , my favorite dessert from here. A perfect flavour blend. Must try.

This place is a Vegetarian’s paradise very close to Bhawanipore Education Society in Elgin Road. It serves sumptuous vegetarian dishes. I started with their Mushroom Al-a Cappuccino which was very tasty ! For starters I loved the Classic Baked Mushrooms, Olive Madnesses Bruchetta, Baked Stuff Potato and their Silver Beat Risotto Aranchini. To accompany my meal I had the Kitkat Shake which was tasty as hell and a must try !Main Course left us gagging for more as each and every item was brilliant ! Must tries include Fettuccini Pasta and Mix Sauce Ravioli. The 12” Pizza Spicy Margerita was the highlight of the meal with it’s perfectly thin crust and the Mushroom Risotto which was awesome ! For desert I tried the Chocolate Cheese Cake and the Blueberry Cheese Cake which were one of the best I had !
I’d recommend everyone to try this joint and it’s a must for Vegetarians ! Enjoy !

For every non vegetarian lover who are sceptical about good vegetarian restaurants, Sumo Dough will change your notions. The place was relatively empty when we went there. This place has a very warm and cozy ambience about it. 
We ordered mushroom al-a-capuccino and broccoli Al-a-capuccino. Though both tasted good, I loved the mushroom soup. It was thick and to the notch perfect for a winter evening.
For starters we ordered Olive madness bruchetta, baked stuffed potatoes and classic baked mushrooms. The bruchetta and mushroom was cooked to perfection but baked stuffed potato stole my heart. Topped with gooey cheese, its the best starter I've tasted till date. 
Then we had some lemonade to quench our thirst.
For main course we had asparagus risotto and creamy cheese ravioli, pasta and spicy margarita pizza. The risotto and the creamy cheese pasta were the showstoppers. I'll come back again and again to have them both.
Though full, considering the quality of the food and the lovely ambience we couldn't hold ourselves back from ordering desserts. The chocolate and blue berry cheesecake were the cherry on the cake. My personal favorite is the chocolate cheesecake which I would highly recommend. 
The service is fast and the staff are too courteous. This is a must visit place for all vegetarian foodies as well as the non vegetarian foodies who are opting for a slight change in taste.

In the building next to Bhawanipur College in Elgin Rd., Sumo Dough is an all vegetarian cafe gaining popularity amongst the college goers. The decor of the place has been kept simple with ample of bright lighting which gives a positive vibe to the place. The quality of service- satisfactory. A few of the items out of the menu are absolutely stunning whereas dishes like the baked potatoes and the cheesecake need to be worked upon. My recommendations for the place includes: 
- Olive Bruchettas
- Silver Beat Risotto
- Creamy Cheese Ravioli 
- 12" Pizza

This is a small cafe/restaurant located between STORY, Elgin Rd and Bhowanipore college. The ambience is pretty cool and attractive to young eyes. The food is really great and definitely worth a try. It is a vegetarian's paradise.
The Mushroom soup is rich and creamy which was one of the better ones I've had.
The Baked Stuff Potatoes was the best starter i had there.
The pizza was brilliant, the cheese content, the taste.
For desserts, i would recommend the Bluberry Cheese Cake.

It has a really nice ambience. The colorful walls implicitly bring cheerfulness to your mood. The staff's behavior is also quite polite and friendly. Keep in mind that it is a vegetarian restaurant but the variance in the menu didn't let me realise that there was something missing. Had the sumo mix sauce spaghetti with broccoli and mushroom. It was really good. Oreo shake was mouth watering. I'll deduct 0.5 for the Caesar salad. Seemed that the lettuce wasn't fresh, so were the jalapenos. They should work on the quality of the salad. Else, it was undoubtedly worth going.

We ordered a lot of dishes, the best ones being
1. Mexican pizza- Although the addition of nachos did not work out, the taste of the pizza was very good. It had the perfect texture and crunch of a thin crust pizza. A suggestion to kitchen team would be to replace the nachos with jalapenos.
2. Philadelphia cheese rolls- Perfectly fried, filled with Philadelphia cheese, served with a nice dip. Please consider using kitchen towels to soak the extra oil before serving. That would enhance the experience of a really tasty dish.
3. Baked mushrooms- This was one of my favorites from the menu. Big pieces of mushrooms filled cheese and mushrooms, fried to perfection served on top of a really tasty and different tomato based sauce. Highly recommended! 
4. Masala cheese bread- a bread roll smeared with butter and filled with cheese and a "bhaji" like masala. What can be better than this. Recommended! 
5. Roesti with mushroom ragi- The roesti shud have been thinner because that would have made it crispier. However the presentation of the dish was superb. It was served with a scoop of sour cream and mushroom sauce. The taste was top notch.
6. Mom's special bake- three layers of Italian goodness topped with baked cheese. The dish had the wow factor. The pesto base really took the dish some notches higher along with some really well cooked arborio rice. If you are a fan of baked dishes you should definitely try this one.
7. Special tiramisu- beautifully presented and tasted equally good. Super soft and super spongy. Full of bursting flavours.
8. Tobelorone shake- took me back to good old days when I used to hog on these super tasty chocolates. Presented with whipped cream on top, every sip tasted like liquified chilled tobelorone. 
Overall, a good place for good food at reasonable prices, with some really courteous staff.

Located between Bhawanipore College and Forum Mall.This place is what you call a hidden gem.Not a big fan vegetarian food but Sumo Dough made me change my mind. The place has a lovely decor and a great ambience. The service is prompt and the staff is very good and friendly.
Now coming to the food..
*Oreo Shake (Recommended)
This tasted good and was quite refreshing.
*Jalapeños Cheese Poppers (Recommended)
If u love the combination of Jalapeño and cheese then this is a must order.
*Mushroom Duplex
This was something unique and really loved it.
*Classic Baked Mushroom (Strongly Recommended)
If you visit this place and don't order this then you are missing out on something.
*Mexican Pizza
One of the better Pizzas I have had in a long long time.It was perfect.It was the showstopper for me.
*Mom's Special Bake (Recommended)
Perfectly Baked filled with a lot of Cheese.
This is a must order
*Tiramisu (Recommended)
Loved the presentation and the taste was great too.
Loved the food..

A vegetarian's paradise :)
Even hardcore non-vegetarians like me will fall in love with this place.
We were a group of 5. We ordered a virgin mojito and toublerone shake as thirst-quenchers. For starters we had a mouth-watering array of dishes : Mushroom Duplex, Philadelphia Cream Cheese Roll, Masala cheese herb bread. We followed it up with a Five-cheese pizza and Potato Roesti with mushroom ragout. Dessert was my favourite - kahlua tiramisu.

Both the beverages were spot on. The mojito was as refreshing as the shake was Creamy and chocolatey.The starters are definitely a strong point in this restaurant. Be it the robust flavours of the cheese herb bread, the melt-in-the mouth texture of the cream cheese rolls or the delicate flavours of the mushroom Duplex -each and every dish was perfection on a plate.
The pizza too was as authentic as you can get, with the venti formaggi (five cheeses) wrecking a delectable Havoc on your palate. Also it had a nice thin crust and was not overloaded with toppings- just the way I like it. The Potato Roesti was a bit of a let down for me as I thought the potatoes were quite undercooked, but the mushroom ragout was amazing.
Last but not the least, the tiramisu was spot-on in both presentation and taste. It was a perfect end to a great meal.
Thumbs up for the hospitality of the staff and very efficient service. Do drop by Sumo Dough, whether you are vegetarian or an 'omnivore' like me :p

One of the renowned places serving lip-smacking and delectable vegetarian food, sumo dough definitely knows how to up their game when it comes the hospitality, overall management along with food presentation and preparation.

Located between forum and bhawanipore college, this place is definitely a gem for all the good reasons.

Now coming to the food, this time i decided to focus mainly on the starters mostly along with a few beverages and one dessert dish .

-- the toblerone shake is something exotic and classy and definitely Worth ordering.
-- the oreo shake packs a heavy punch too. The presentation was commendable.

-- the Mexican pizza and the five cheese pizza were definitely the highlights among the starters. The presence of 5 types of cheese were significantly evident.

-- the Philadelphia cream cheese roll was a definite showstopper! I literally couldn't get over these beauties.

-- the mushroom duplex was a classic, unparalleled in quality and taste.

-- you could also try their classic baked mushroom. It's one of a kind and definitely worth the order.

-- i am a big fan of cheese and all kinds of cheese dishes so if you are a bread person and a cheese lover, their pull cheese bread and masala cheese herb bread would be the perfect order.
-- the tiramisu was fine in terms of preparation, presentation and taste.
This place is quite spacious and beautifully decorated. The ambience resonates a positive vibe which elevates the dining experience altogether.

Visited Sumo Dough today after planning for long. Although taste wise, its OK..the quantity of food is pathetic. Ordered risotto and roesti. .. it seemed as if they had served miniature versions of the dishes. High time the management of the restaurant acts upon this feedback, which I notice has come from many customers.

Small outlet. Kitchen and dining area are one continuous space, makes it rather stuffy.
Food was mostly good.
Pasta aglio olio was delicious.
Arrabiata was barely eatable. Too sweet.
Pizza was very good, crisp thin crusted.
Beverages are not good at all. Had a kit kat shake. Was watery and thin with some weird froth on top.
Service is the main issue. They're very slow, they don't understand their own menu. You don't even get water on your table unless you ask for it.
Update- service is horrible. They need to train the wait-staff better. Food is very average. Outlet not maintained well at all. Bad delivery experience too.

One of the most pathetic place i have ever visited in kolkata off late. The manager is totally unprofessional, half of the items was not available, and this is one of the place where the manager will himself decide what you eat. Finally i ordered a paneer tikka and a make your own pizza. The quantity and quality of paneer tikka was not at all worth the price. Coming to pizza, again some of the cheese option they mentioned in their menu was not available. 
Advise to the management: 
1)Kindly train your manager as to how to make people comfortable rather than making them uncomfortable. 
2)When you charge high for something justify it with quality. 
3)Make sure you have atleast 80% if not 100% of the items on the menu available if you plan to open the restaurant. Thanks

Decided to visit this place after checking out the menu on zomato, since it appeared to be one of the few places in cal that has roesti on the menu. On visiting, however, we found that roestis were not available. Not only that, pesto sauce (my second choice order) was unavailable, as were all the mocktails and waffles. I dont understand the concept of coming up with such an elaborate menu to lure customers in, and then not stocking any of the items. 

They also messed up our pasta order by getting the incorrect veggies. The only thing that was passable here was the mushroom ravioli in arabiata sauce

Ordered a couple of things like Hakka noodles, veg dimsums and waffles. Food was average but was disappointed with the waffles. Firstly they took a pretty long time for the waffles and secondly the toppings, we had ordered 2 variants : Nutella with banana and Nutella with blueberry or strawberry I don’t remember. There were no fruits but jam and for bananas there were hardly 4 -5 slices of a banana not even half a banana. The waffle also was not tasty. I don’t think will visit again.

Before I say anything, let me point out that Sumo Dough has a new Indian menu section, and my experience with the new dishes was fabulous. We had ordered a Chelo Kebab and penne pasta in mix sauce. I will come to the pasta in a bit, but I must foremost say that the kebab was absolutely delicious. It was almost filling by itself for 2 people, and was really well made. The staff and service was also good. 
The reason why I have not given this restaurant a higher score is because of the pasta. The olives they gave were just pathetic and ruined the experience of a pasta already very sub par. And it is sad because people really spoke highly of the pasta, but my experience with the pasta was really not good. 
That said, do try the Chelo kebab.

It was one of the worst restaurant or say a place I along with my family have ever visited. Rendering of service was so poor that according to me it needs a sort of back-up crew who all can manage a red-hot situation. I don't think this place knows much about north indian cuisine so it should be their priority to focus on this cuisine from both quantity and quality wise. Please do concentrate towards staff- training since they were not aware of cleaning up the eatery desk before serving main course. Overall I was totally disappointed from this place since we visit a restaurant to relax and eat good food and last but not the least being provided with top-class service, none were being there. Service charge is also applicable on the bill amount not being a deserving charge. Hence such a low rating.

Being a completely non-veg person, this was the 1st Vegan place that I tried in Kolkata. Wasn't disappointed though. Tried their Kitkat shake and Mushroom duplex. The quality and taste was top notch.
However I felt the staff needs improvement. They were not attentive enough. Had to ask for water about 2 to 3 times. 
And yes, this place also charges 5% service charge apart from the regular 18% GST.
Overall experience was not bad, but could have been better.

Sumo dough is located next to Bhawanipore Education College and will definitely not miss your eye. It's a small place with 8/9 tables. The abstract art and pop of colour is quite appropriate. We went around 1 pm and it was empty. There were not too many servers either. 
Coming to the food- we ordered spinach ravioli with cheese sauce  and two drinks, the kit Kat shake and the brownie shake. 
Loved the ravioli. The kit Kat shake was quite good too. But I hated the brownie shake. It had a strange taste and smell too it- like it was made of stale brownie. I didn't even attempt to finish the entire drink. 
We were also served the drinks after we finished our ravioli and that's quite odd. Also the AC was turned off and was turned on after we asked them to. 

They definitely need to work on service, but in terms of food- good job!

Food - This vegan place had some nice Italian menu. And a nicer dessert menu. We ordered for stuffed baked potatoes which had a cheesy outer cover with spicy smashed potato. Fir dessert we got chocolate cheesecake and blueberry nutella waffles. The waffles were good but a more of nutella would make it tastier. Cheesecake was not worth as it didn't taste like a cheesecake but some chocolate mousse. 

Ambience - A nice place. Nicely decorated.

Service - The staff is really good and cooperative. 

Rate - Appropriate

What I absolutely loved was the waffle with blueberry and chocolate spread. 
The mushroom duplex was no doubt yummy with the cheese oozing out but I found the covering to be too oily.

Tried the vegetable lasagne, ravioli, pizza and kitkat shake. Each and every dish was spectacular. The icing on the cake would be the cake itself, that is the blueberry cheesecake that we ordered as dessert. It was truly a piece of art and it took all the courage I had to put a spoon into something that gorgeous. But the moment it went into my heart, mind and stomach was filled with unbounded joy. Go to this place to experience great food at fairly competitive prices. If only rating the food I would have given it a 5/5. However, I give the lower rating only because of slightly shoddy service where they didn't switch on the A.C until, drenched in sweat, I had to complain about it. That too was switched on after a mild protest by me, wherein I was made to change tables because the staff didn't know how to raise the flap in the AC. Once, they also had the audacity to switch off the AC over my table despite me sitting there and there being no one else nearby so rest assured that no one would have had any problem. After some rebuking from my end, the AC was switched on again. But no one expects to go to an air conditioned restaurant in September to find the management being so misery in their use of the AC and to have guests get into so much hassle to get the AC switched on. Apart from that, nothing to complain, and staff was pretty courteous and prompt in service. Hope to visit again and hope that next time would not have to get into unnecessary hassles regarding the AC of all things!

Located just beside Bhawanipur college, this restaurant has a tinted glass facade towards the open kitchen that faces the Elgin road. The ambience of the place is funky with its colorful glass shades here and there. The place is not so big but beautifully arranged with 8 or 9 tables.

This place serves only vegetarian dishes but non vegetarians must give it a try. The quality of food is really good.
We opted for risotto aranchini ball - its something you would want to order twice. The cheese and white cream blend together so well inside the potato balls.
Mushroom spaghetti pasta with tomato basil - though the quantity of the food is not so much but the taste will blow you away. 

The only complaint here was the delay in serving the food. We had to wait for 30minutes to get those two dishes in our table. That too when the restaurant was not crowded at all.

This place was bookmarked for a very long time and finally yesterday when I was in the mood to devour I landed here.
1. LOCATION (5/5)-Right on the main road beside bhawanipur college so it cannot be missed. Found a parking space near forum so had to walk a few steps to this place.
2. AMBIENCE (3/5)- It's a tiny place with 8-9 tables but is beautifully done. Extremely colorful with open kitchen. But personally the open kitchen concept in such a tiny restaurant looks like a problem to me. It was so noisy and the loud music was adding to it to such an extent that it was difficult to grab waiter's attention. Everytime we wanted to place an order or get water refilled we had to keep screaming to call the waiter.
3. SERVICE (2/5)- Not at all attentive and were lost half of the times. For two people, they provided us 1 plate. When we asked for the other one, the waiter asked us to eat from the plate in which they served the dish directly. We had to ask them to serve water which was finally served after 5 reminders. Getting water refilled was yet another challenge. Plus the waiters were confused about the order as they served our order on the other table by mistake. Then after serving the pizza, they came back to take it away as they thought it was not our order. Two of the waiters  were arguing right infront of us regarding who's order it really was. To top it all, three times the same waiter asked us to order for the main course and we kept telling him that we already did but he kept coming back asking the same. Seemed like he was high!
FOOD (3.5/5)- For starters, we called for garlic tossed mushrooms and they were quite nice. But they served mint chutney with it which completely looked off. For main course we ordered Mexican Pizza and White Sauce Spaghetti. Pizza was quite nice and full of flavours. However, I was really disappointed with the Pasta. The sauce was plain and disgusting. If a restaurant can't make a basic White Sauce Spaghetti Pasta then it should not call itself an Italian Joint.
We decided to end our meals with Tiramisu and it bowled me over. It was plated so well and tasted even better.

Though most of the reviews say it is really good,my experience was a little different. Maybe one of those days when things don't work out for the good, so I'll definitely drop in some other time.

Pocket pinch :1500 for 2.

Sumo Dough, it's sounds like Chinese named but it serves Italian and Continental Cuisine. It's stone thrown away from the Forum Mall and just besides the Bhawaniporee College, has a seen through faced. This is a vegetarian restaurant but a place which non-vegetarian should not miss out. The decor are simple with ample lighting all around and the furnishings are quite colourful and vivid with some wall art. The interior and heart-throb music made the entire expirence worthwhile. Even the staffs are courteous and attentive. They serve the authentic Italian and Continental dishes which was actually lip-smacking. 

We ordered  Cheese Garlic Bread, Penne Pasta with Tomato Basil Sauce , Strawberries Waffle and Blueberries Cheese Cake.

In recent times, Kolkata has seen vegetarian food set a strong foothold in leaps and bounds. Adding to the firmness of such foothold is Sumo Dough. The name might echo the presence of Chinese cuisine but that’s not the case. The menu is entirely Italian & Continental.

It is located just beside Bhawanipore College and has a see-through façade. As mentioned above, this a pure vegetarian restaurant but a place the even the non-vegetarians shouldn’t miss out on. The interiors are simple with ample lighting all around. The furnishings are quite colourful and attractive.

Moreover, I was blown away by the quality of food served here. Such good food available at prices that won’t drive you into the ground.

Kit Kat Shake was a drink of happiness and had a nice blend of chocolate and good quality milk. It had nice consistency.
Cheese Garlic Bread was the best I have had in this city. True flavour of garlic and cheese entirely absorbed by the loaves.
Jalapeno Cheese Poppers were a delight. Extremely cheesy with the Habanero spice element are always loveable.
Mushroom Duplex were cheese stuffed button mushrooms. Who doesn’t love cheese and mushrooms!
Homemade Ravioli was a pleasant surprise. We opted for spinach ricotta ravioli with cheese sauce. The taste was wonderful. My new favourite.
Al Fungi Pizza was again just superb and filled with diced mushrooms. Ample amount of cheese and mushrooms are sure to win hearts.
5-Cheese Pizza had loads and varieties of cheese, enough to melt our hearts away.
Blueberry & Nutella Waffles were something to die for. An abundant spread of blueberry compote and nutella was enough to wiggle our taste buds.

The service was fluent through the evening. The place is definitely worth repeated visits.

So folks that was about it from Sumo Dough.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Even not being a 'vegetarian' person this place attracted me because of its amazing Italian dishes.
Located  beside bhawanipur college, this place is serving some lipsmacking Italian cuisine for some time now. 

The interior is very colourful and vivid with some wall arts and nice music definitely gonna suit your mood.
Service is very good. And they will guide you with the orders. 

We ordered..
1. Virgin Mojito 
2. KitKat shake - the shake was amazing and the milk they used is very fresh , rich and creamy, unlike some other places.

3. Cheese garlic bread- nothing can go wrong with cheese garlic bread. 
4. Jalapeños cheese poppers -crispy fried jalapeñnos served with sourcream. Crispy, tangy dish to tantalise your taste buds. 

5. Duplex Mushroom - this one is my favourite. Crispy fried mushroom poppers loaded with cheese served with amazing dip ( recommended) 

6. Tomato and exotic veggies Risotto 
7. Hand made ravioli - hand made raviolis in white sauce. Like I said nothing can go wrong with loaded cheese. 

8. 5 cheese pizza (recommended) 

9.kalua tiramisu 

10. Blueberry waffle - crispy waffles topped with blueberry sauce, chocolate sauce and whipped. Truly magnificent. (Highly recommended) 

To all vegan yet Italia cusine lover I would love to ask you to try out this place. And no-veg people do try out sometimes may be. 

Cheers to team sumo dough !

Located right beside Bhawanipur College on the main road, this place is very easily spotted.
Interiors are vibrant with colourful furnishings.
Good music, amazing ambiance. Staffs are courteous and attentive.

Recently I have been discovering some really good vegetarian restaurants around the city and Sumo Dough has to be one of them after last night's dinner.

We had Cheese Garlic Breads, Jalapeños Cheese Poppers, Duplex Mushroom, Sliver Beat Risotto Aranchini Ball, Thin Crust Al Fungi and 5 Cheese Pizzas, Spaghetti Aglio Olio & Creamy Tomato and Exotic Vegetables Risotto.
All this to go with Masala Lemonade, Mojito and KitKat Shake.

Desserts are always my favourite part! The Kahlua Tiramisu & Blueberry Waffles won me over!
The presentation of the Tiramisu was top notch while the waffles tasted like the best thing in the world!

• Jalapeños Cheese Poppers • Al Fungi Pizza • Creamy Tomato Exotic Vegetables Risotto (I could have this all day!) • KitKat Shake • Blueberry Nutella Waffles - These are my picks!
Order these when you drop by Sumo Dough and I swear you wouldn't be disappointed!

The must orders -

Kitkat Shake
Jalapenos Cheese Poppers
Duplex Mushrooms
Silver beat Risotto aranchini ball
Kahlua Tiramisu
Blueberry Waffles

Price is reasonable. Service is great!

Vegetarian food is the term which is indeed a nightmare word for a hardcore non vegetarian. But make no mistake Vegetarian food has the power and bliss to outplay the non veg in some occasions. This happened to me today when i visited to Sumo Dough.
Located at Elgin Road, mins away from Forum mall and very close to Bhawanipur College. An exotic Italian restaurant which has some eye catchy menu with some decent and pocket friendly prices.
Talking about the ambiance so it is colorful with good sitting and beautiful lighting. Staff have been very courteous and friendly.

We tried the following items

Kit Kat Shake - this drink never disappoints me. Always gives me the happiness of cream chocolate and Kit kat offcourse. Truly it was wonderful.

Cheese Garlic Bread - Cheesy and soft, blend of Garlic and cheese just made my mouth crave for more.

Duplex Mushroom - This pizza was bang on with the mushroom taking the charge.

Blueberry Waffle - WOW!!!!!! this was an amazing pick. Recommended

Risotto Aranchini Ball - Looked so simple from the outset but this has something to make you order once again.
Colorful interiors and designed walls with some heartthrob music made the entire dinning experience worth the time. Never felt such amazing to any Veg outlet like this before. Kudos to the Team. I wish them Well.

I am not a "vegetarian person" at all. But very fond of Italian. This place , undoubtedly offers some terrific Italian food , being purely vegetarian.
To my surprise, this is a gem of a place.
A quirky interior with peppy music and vibrant wall arts. Good ambience!
For the drinks we ordered for virgin mojito (recommended) and kit Kat shake. I loved how they presented it.
Starters included : Jalapeno cheese poppers with dip, mushroom duplex (recommended) , cheesy garlic bread, Silver beat arrancini risotto balls.

For the main course we settled for a mushroom pizza (recommended), 5 cheese pizza, hand made ravioli (cheese sauce), tomato and exotic veggies risotto, and spaghetti aglio oglio(recommended).
The quality of products were top notch.

Now the best part, the desserts. They were my heroes. We orders the Kahlua tiramisu and blueberry and nutella waffles. The latter was out of the world and delicious.

This place is a MUST in your go to list.

Vistied this place on a rainy friday evening with one of my foodie friends Christia Rozario.. The outlet wasnt at its rush peak time so we could easily found a table for two.. The service personnel had a pleasant attitude with a warm smile on his face. 
Coning to the menu.. short and crisp with variety as well.. not much though on the beverage part.. 
We thought to go with obe of the fresh pastas spinach and riccotta ravioli with cream of pesto sauce.. the portion size was adequate for two to gulp on but the lemonade was not upto the standard i felt..!! A unique set of crockery i must confess though..
A must visit for italian food lovers.. !! #sumofoodie

Ambiance: 3/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 5/5

*Chef's Special* (Baked veggie lasagna), is a must try. The portion sizes served is quite welcoming and filling.
*Plain Garlic Bread* is quite crispy and tasteful, recommended.


All this for about 450 for 2, which seems decent for a speciality Italian restro.

Ambiance is fine, colorful with decent music played in the background but nothing fancy to attract your attention on the inside.

Still got to try their pizzas and desserts, until then, keep a watchout for an updated review.

Visited this place last night with my friend and Ddnt expect it to be this cool.  Helpful staff and kind behaviour. Nice and neat decor!! Coming to the menu,  it's crisp and short,  it isn't overly done!  Ordered for the spinach ravioli with cream pesto sauce,  and it was good. The sauce was delectable!! The lemonade on the other hand was a bit disappointing. Not up-to the standard of the dish!  
I personally loved the crockery.  Beautiful plates.  
Will surely visit again!!

Located very close to Bhawanipore college, its a nice cozy place. By the looks and ambience this place is mostly for pizza lovers though we ordered Mix Sauce Pasta, Masala Cheese herb bread and Cafe Latte. Pasta was good but the other two were bit of a disappointment. A seconds visit will only be to see if they have nice pizzas or not. Otherwise a pretty average place!

A hunger satisfying meal is what you need at the end of a tiring day. Sumo dough, might make you think it is a Japanese restaurant but it actually is an Italian eatery. Good seating-capacity and minimal interiors.
We had,
Broccoli and mushroom cheese fondue which is nothing like the conventional cheese fondue. Crispy fried broccoli and mushrooms topped with liquid chees sauce, eliminating wastage.
Sumo sized Spinach cheese ravioli in mixed sauce was amazing.
Mushroom risotto was just perfect.
Cheese garlic bread was also good.
Masala lemonade, which they boast as their speciality, is really good and refreshing.
Good food and great service. I would recommend this place.

Location:it's just a building before my college (Bhawanipur college).
Ambience and staffs:the crowd is real nice over here with Perfect ambience and decor..the staff that took order was extremely polite and too helpful in deciding the menu
Food:I am a die hard non vegetarian but this place being 100% veg seriously didn't give me a single scope of complaint.we were a group of three and ordered something in cheese ball(be it the presentation or the taste it was perfectly done), lasagna (this was simply too good and a piece of heaven on plate for cheese lovers),we also had the mojito and masala lemonade (both were perfect in all flavors and the sweetness was something so perfect)for dessert we took the chocolate cheesecake (this simple won my heart)
The prices were worth it's quantity and quality...and also a must try out place for pure non vegetarians like me💗

LOCATION:

Located on Elgin Road next to the Bhawanipore College on the same side of the road.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Sumo Dough opened a while back and I had been hearing about it from some of my friends who frequent the outlet. My visit took me there late Saturday night with my wife as we wanted Italian but were too bored of our normal haunt Fire & Ice. We were immediately enticed by the restaurant with its glass kitchen forming the exterior of the restaurant. I was yet to see a restaurant in Kolkata with that set up. Kudos to them for keeping the kitchen exposed and well maintained. It was clean with chefs working in sparkling white uniforms kneading their dough or cooking their pasta. It was heartening to see that and got our appetites going.

The interiors are very basic and are actually cafe like with colorful chairs and some wall frames. I liked the designed crockery provided which was a change from the typical whites in most other restaurants.

WINE & DINE:

We ordered for Cheese Garlic Bread, Minestrone Soup, Pizza with sun dried tomatoes and Sauteed Mushrooms.

Minestrone Soup -- Decent soup with a good kick of of Red Pepper Sauce. It had generous amounts of pasta and vegetables and one helping was enough to serve two. It was a good beginning to the meal.

Cheese Garlic Bread -- This was not up to the mark although one would imagine it would be easy to make. They made their own bread which was nice to see but then there was too much bread and too little cheese and garlic. Also the dough needed to rest more before baking and one could find the smell of unreacted yeast in the bread distinctly. 

Sauteed Mushrooms -- This was the saving grace of the evening. The quantity was generous and the mushrooms were sauteed just right. It is so easy to overcook mushrooms but the chef managed to get it just right. It was served with a rich pesto sauce although I would have preferred mine without added colors. Nonetheless, the dish was hearty and delicious,

Pizza -- This was the biggest disappointment of the evening. The dough was a little raw and the sun dried tomatoes had a sugary sweetness about them. It overpowered everything else about the pizza and we had to remove them with spoons before having our pie.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Despite problems with their food, I do not normally score so low. But then we asked for our pizza to be packed (over half of it remained uneaten). We waited for about 20 mins and then inquired about our package. To our dismay, the steward informed us that they had thrown the pizza. He did offer us a new one instead, but we were too tired by then and paid and left. Service really needs to be stepped up.

VERDICT:

Service and food have problems. A few dishes are good but the place lacks consistency with its menu.

This place is situated near Bhawanipur College and has a pleasant environment. 
I tried cheese garlic bread which turned out to be better than its usual self and cheese cream ravioli with mixed sauce was lip smackingly tasty.
Went there with my childhood friend and the place served us quite well.

Sumo dough is a newly opened joint serving delicious Italian food. The USP of this place is that it is purely vegetarian. I had a cream cheese mixed sauce ravioli. It was delicious. The cream cheese enhanced the taste of the ravioli. Next I ordered a cold coffee which was just ordinary. 
The ambiance is quite good and you can see the kitchen clearly. Do visit this place if you have cravings for Italian food.

Casual ambience with good service and best food, Sumo Dough sounds a nice place worth to look in on .I went with a couple of my friends and ordered a mixed sauce pasta which was actually good followed by cannelloni florentine which couldn't meet the expectation as it arouse after the first look and Oreo shake was superb. Definitely worth to pay a call on.

Review of 1 simply as negative ratings are not possible. Placed order at 7:43 PM yesterday, delivery executive walked in after 9:00 pm to inform that restaurant did not pack food properly so one item is totally smashed and beyond eatable condition (Momo special). Next Indian thali with clear instructions of aloo do pyaaza but they sent daal (restaurant "forgot to look at order"). Tikia chola in the order and in the bill was not in the package. So in all our meal comprised of 5 pieces of baked potato and 1 masala kulcha!!!

Zomato hasn't been able to help and sent me a zomato credit of 150 bucks against my order of 1050 bucks being spoilt!! Upon escalation, they sent me the restaurant owners phone number and asked me to resolve with him directly (incidentally, that number was also off). 

This is the worst experience we have had with a restaurant and zomato and will be extremely wary of ordering online with the portal.

It is the non-vegetarian in me that got a bit critical whenever I visit a vegetarian joint, especially in Kolkata and my recent visit to Sumo Dough was no exception at all. I was not much sure initially how am I going to like a vegetarian Italian joint with a Japanese name. But as they say, looks can be deceiving and here I am, happy with the vegetarian serving there at Sumo Dough.

We had been to Sumo Dough a few days after it opened up and were happy with the food. We went back a couple of days back, this time on an invite and we were happy with the food again. Located conveniently in Elgin road near Bhawanipur College, Sumo Dough has got it’s priority correct compared to so many of the new places that think fancy decor, below average food and arrogance is the way forward. So here’s what we thought of Sumo Dough.

Wondering how a hardcore carnivore like me rated full marks to a pure vegetarian restaurant? Then, here's the deal.. visit Sumo Dough and get surprised, exactly like I was! 

Located at Elgin Road, this colourful restaurant had caught my attention long back. But the fact that it was purely veg dampened my spirits, and hence the delay in visiting it. However, I was invited here with

The ambience is good and staff is friendly. We ordered for the Philadelphia cheese rolls which was really good but for the quantity they serve, it's not too easy going to the pocket. Next, we ordered for lasagne, very nice and authentic. Jacket potatoes were good too, served with sour cream. Overall good food but a negative marking for the quantity for sure.

Why you knead to check out Sumo Dough on Elgin Road. Buon Appetito!

For more visit www.konizfoodwheels.wordpress.com

Who would dole out the dough? After all, itwould cost around 50006000 rupees to hire a Sumo to travel to Kolkata. Forget it. Just drop into the newest  eataria in town - Sumo dough. An Italian Quick Service Restaurant,offering Delicious mouth-watering vegetarian Italian favorites that compliment Specialties and classics. 

This is a brainchild of friends Sumit Kariwala and Ritesh Shrivastava. Wondering what the name is all about? “My friends call me Sumo (from Sumit) because now I am slightly overweight. So when I opened this place, I named it after myself and added the word Dough because Italian food uses a lot of it,” laughed Sumit. 

Location : The address reads 6B Elgin Road. This is just next to Bhawanipur College.

Decor and Ambience : Blink and you’ll not miss this narrow strip of a restaurant with its matt-black frontage, the name painted in possible bright colors. Inside, pared-back, minimal surroundings allow the no-fuss Italian food to do the talking. Simple decor, compact menu and a hearty veg Italian meal is what defines 45-seater Sumo Dough on Elgin Road. 

Food : 
The LIVE kitchen takes the best of the day’s produce and crafts a menu of bold simplicity, offering just minimal yet authentic Pasta’s & Wood Fire Pizza’s.

Beverages :
1. Berry Iced Tea - To start with,  soothe yourself with an ice tea with crushed berries.

Starters,Soup and Salad :
1. Mushroom soup - Take a soup break and sip on Mushroom al-a-Cappuccino. The creamy, frothy and light soup is drizzled with olive oil and served with fresh cream. Served in a ceramic mug, this is a pure feel-good item on the Sumo Dough menu!

2. Silver Beet Risotto Aranchini - The Arancini with braised silverbeet and spinach drawn into balls and deep fried served with a balsamic reduction is an amazing affair. 

3. Fresh feta and watermelon salad - Easy, healthy and colorful, this is a perfect summer salad, alternatively layered with feta cheese and watermelon slices. Absolutely gorgeous looking.

Mains :
1. Ravioli in cheese sauce - This Ravioli stuffed with a delicious mushroom mixture then topped with a cheesy sauce was heavenly. 

2. Masala Cheese herb bread - The classic French toast a spicy twist by coating the bread in a mixture of herbs added and a mixture of cheese to over the bread is something that you can munch on and on. 

3. Sumo dough Pizza - Nothing beats a smoky, crispy and light pizza. mind-melting wood fired pizzas , you can't stop at one. 

Desserts :
1. Waffles - These waffles are super crisp on the outside and light as a feather inside and so scrumptious.

2. Kahlua Tiramisu - A signature of Sumo Dough, the Kahlua Tiramisu is a must-try. This Italian dessert is gluten-free, eggless and blends the cocoa and espresso flavours perfectly.

Drop by to munch on wood-fired pizzas, baked items such as Lasagne al-Vardure (baked layered pasta with veggies), risottos like Risotto al Zafferano, ravioli, crepes and waffles. Think Italian, think Sumo Dough. 
Cheers!

Visited for a Sumo bit. Although not all that is expected is received. If a sumo would visit here first he might not fit through the gates, but apart from that he might have to order all the items on the menu to fill his stomach. The quantities for all the Sumo portions are something which might embarrass the thinking of the wrong perception of the Sumos in the country. 
Even though the taste of the food was good and ambiance alright I wasn't pleased by the service.

Also, don't know if it matters much, but the crockery were pretty.

Been there last Sunday... the food is good but the AC doesn't work.... we were sweating...when I brought this (The AC problem) to the notice of the server... he said since you're sitting close to the kitchen... you're bound to feel hot... why put a table there then???

When I said will post this on Zomato... he said sir, you can post it so that it directly goes to the owner... 

Was not expecting a casual approach to a customer's concern.

Service (Timewise) - 4.5/5

There has been a sudden rush of pure vegetarian restaurants in Calcutta but the one that has recently caught my attention is Sumo Dough, which specializes in Italian. Being an ardent fan of Italian cuisine, I was pretty eager to give this place of visit. But, somehow the thought of not having meat on my plate made my hesitate to an extent. I, however, managed to curb my hesitation and give this place a visit when I was invited for a bloggers meet.

Sumo Dough perfectly depicts a casual dining restaurant. The colourful interiors look lovely. The open kitchen faces the main road. It was a summer afternoon and the first thing that came to my mind, was to quench my thirst. I immediately picked two options from the mocktails - Kit Kat Shake and Masala Lemonade. The shake was thick and consistent. The flavour of crushed Kit Kat was nice. The Masala Lemonade was chilled, fizzy and very refreshing. I'd definitely like to recommend both these drinks.

I was reluctant to try the soup and wanted to move on to the starters directly. But then, Sumo Dough is one of the rare places in the city serving Mushroom Cappuccino. So I decided to give it a try. I was actually taken aback by the amazing flavour of the soup. The soup was rich, with a layer of froth on top and full of minced mushrooms. I can anyday skip any non vegetarian soup for this !

The Modern Caprese Salad is presented in a very innovative way, like a flower ! It didn't even look like a salad, but tasted way better than my expectation. The only ingredients in the salad were tomatoes and boccanchini. The tomatoes were amazingly juicy. The basil pesto balsamic reduction was tangy and added due to beautiful flavour of the salad. This is perhaps the best type of salad to be consumed in summer.

The Philadelphia Cheese Rolls which came next, was as delicious as its predecessors. The cheese cigars were crunchy and were stuffed with molten cheese. It was served with a tangy and spicy dip of tomato salsa.

Not many places in the city serve Ravioli. So I wanted to try that over here. I opted for mushroom ravioli in cheese sauce. It tasted heavenly ! I completely fell in love with the ravioli. It was perfectly boiled. The cheese sauce was so well cooked and wasn't overpowering at all. I can have this beauty throughout the day and still not get bored !

Another speciality of this place is the Potato Roesti. It was served with sour cream and vegetable bolognese sauce. The roesti was crunchy and well cooked. A special mention goes to the vegetable bolognese sauce which was tangy and went well with the potato roesti. This is a must have over here !

The pizzas here are baked in woodfire and are the perfect Italian thin crust pizzas. The Five Cheese Pizza which I had included Parmesan, Cheddar, Mozarella, Ricotta and Feta cheese. The pizza was extremely cheesy and any cheese lover will definitely fall in love with this !

I had the Mom's Special Bake when I was almost full. But again, it was their speciality. So I couldn't give it a miss ! The bake had three layers - green peas, tomato and cheese. It tasted out of the world. The flavours were on spot ! I'm going to come back again just to try this dish.

It was time to wrap up my meal with the dessert. I went for Kahlua Tiramisu. It tasted beautiful and was definitely worth the price. The Tiramisu was extremely soft. The sweetness and the flavour of coffee were well balanced, which I loved. One can't just be happy with a single portion of this wonderful dessert !

Overall, I'm a fan of Sumo Dough now. For vegetarians, if you haven't visited this place, you're surely missing a lot. I would also recommend all my non vegetarian buddies to give this beautiful Italian restaurant a try. This place will definitely satiate everyone's Italian cravings !

Good place to hangout with your friends.  Located near The Story,  this joint basically serves Italian Food. Ambience is good.  Service is bit slow but food is quite good. We ordered  the following items :-

1. Mix Sauce Pasta -  Yummy in taste,  we choose Baby corn and Zucchini as our toppings. 

2. Philedephia Cheese Rolls - Cheese stuffed in small rolls and one of the best and recommended items in menu,  it's definitely worth a try. 

3. Mom's Special - Another recommended item by staff,  this item was sort of lasagne and was delicious. 

4. Dark Chocolate Waffle -  Quite good, but much better is available at other cafes. 

5. Blueberry Cheesecake - It's fantastic.  The moment it gets into your mouth,  taste spreads deliciously.  Worth a try 

6. Tiramisu Kalhua -  Another recommended dessert. This one surely  mesmerised flavour of coffee in one bite  only. 

Overall experience was good.

We visited Sumo dough for dinner last night. The first think that strikes you about this place are the vibrant colors, the sumo dough man in a baking outfit, the open live see through kitchen partitioned by a glass wall, a small cozy place which is buzzing with people.

The USP of this place is the food. We ordered earlier by home delivery and yesterday we dined in. Both experiences were really good.

Coming to the food we had.
The food comes in two portion sizes; regular and sumo. The pizza menu comes in a make it yourself pattern whereas you can choose the cheese, the toppings, the base sauce etc.

We ordered:

Minestrone soup ( Sumo )
Garlic bread confit loaf
Pizza with tomato base, mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes and jalapenos.
Broccoli mushroom cheese fondue
Ravioli with cream cheese in mix sauce
Lemonade

The soup came in an over sized cup bowl. It was quite tasty. The sour punch of fresh tomatoes was well packed in. This soup tasted best with the garlic bread.

The garlic confit loaf was a last order and they took almost 45 mins to get it. It was very nice in terms of taste and freshness. It was a hot dog sized loaf wrapped in foil bathed in garlic butter.

The pizzas are really thin and very fresh. I would prefer the base slightly thicker as in this case the pizza base was almost like a papad.

The ravioli was the best of the lot. You can choose the filling as well be as the sauce . We chose cream cheese filling and mix sauce. It was just melt in the mouth delicious.

The broccoli and mushroom cheese fondue was different. Sauteed big pieces of vegetables were coated in cheese fondue sauce.

Overall a great meal. The prices are reasonable. The food is delicious.

It's a small place and the interiors are quite simple. We tried the Mushroom Cappuccino which was heavenly and a must try for all mushroom lovers. The arachini rissotto balls were also quite good. The Mother's special and rissotto were good but nothing great. Didn't like the tiramisu. Overall this is a pocket friendly place and one could give it a try.

Easy to locate, but shittiest place ever. Went for the first time, ordered cheese jalapeño poppers. They were more of sour cream poppers than cheese ( did not seem to be made in-house, felt like some mcain item ) . Ordered tiramisu on the second visit. I don't know what they served in the name of tiramisu. It was shit, even though it looked delicious. Didn't have any element of tiramisu. Not to forget, we  paid 200 bucks for it!

The pizza crust was crisp and thin,the risotto was the cheesiest thing I've ever had and it needs something to gulp down with. So we had the masala lemonade which was tangy and sweet.

Well, seldom do you find an authentic Italian restaurant that's pure veg, loved the fact that someone thought of this. This place has an open kitchen, which adds to its beauty.

Visited this at evening, menu is limited but good, tried a pasta, you can customize it the way you want, be it sause, Vegetable or the pasta in the first place. Pasta tasted good. Next up tried a rissoto, which had a similar mixed sauce even when it had the name as cheese rissoto, but tased decent, didn't like the chilli presentation of the dish. Wanted to try a pizza here, but I was done by then making it to be tried on my next visit.

Coming to the drinks, ordered a mojito which was as it should be no surprises here. Also tried a blueberry ice tea, which was an enriching combination of ice tea and blueberry, truly loved it, so refreshing.

Come here for good ambiance, Italian cuisines and the very fact that its pure veg.

I have only been here once, but heard a lot about the food here. My experience wasn't really bad, all I felt was that somehow most of the dishes had tab bit of extra salt in them, which was the game spoiler. Otherwise they have great varieties of Italian food with possibly everything on the menu.

One small suggestion could be that the volume of the music could come down a bit, it was too loud while we had lunch there.

Cheers.

The most ridiculous title "Sumo " (the first thought coming in would be probably sushis) for an Italian food joint and hopeless looking staff with little to no knowledge of food combinations or recommendations....ordered a mojito with less sugar ....and turned out to be irritatingly sweet ...the salad of watermelon and feta cheese was the only saving grace of this restaurant as the pizza was a disaster in dough (not properly prepared or cooked) , the ingredients recommended on tomato sauce was ranch with basil (which was not there and replaced with sun dried tomatoes without consent) and the bill costing me 800 bucks for this disaster. #useless

Didn't quite like this place even though I was excited to come here.
Ordered a sumo pizza with hot tomato sauce, bell peppers and jalapenos. Also asked for fresh mozzarella cheese. Expectation was that the cheese would drip from the pizza and it would be very cheesy but contradictory to what I thought they just put a blot of the liquid cheese somewhere on the pizza and served it.

Fettuccine pasta with arabita sauce , broccoli and sweet corn was also tasteless.

Jalapenos cheese poppers were just 5 in quantity. Too less that is for the kind of price they charge.

Oreo shake was also not the Oreo shake we usually have.

Ambience and service is for what I gave the rating.

All in all Disappointed.

Typical, pure vegetarian place which automatically reduces the choices you have. The ambiance is good, but the music is always too loud and trashy. There's a live road-side covered kitchen. The food is too overpriced for the quantity. However, the quality is good. We ordered Philadelphia cheese sticks and tiramisu. After seeing the quantity, we didn't feel like wasting a penny more there. The cheese sticks were great, but the price doesn't begin to justify the quantity. The tiramisu was disappointing. Would not mind trying a few other dishes provided someone's giving me a treat there.

Decent Italian food have had better at different places in Kolkata itself. Though it's very pocket friendly and place is very easily located with decent environment their speghatti arrabiatta was decent and their mushroom starter was a little too watery a little focus by the management would make this place a really good one.

Date of Visit – 29/04/2017

Location – It is located in Elgin road next to bhawanipore college.

Ambience – The restaurant is around 40 seater with seating arrangements comprised of sofa seats, cusioned chairs & wooden tables. There is a road facing open kitchen.

Service – The staffs were little under trained. But I am sure with time they will be good.

Food & Description – We few foodies who are part of Facebook group 'Good Vegetarian Food of Calcutta' had a sudden craving for Mushrooms & we decided to have a Mushroom meet. We decided to order only mushroom items for our meal. Though we ordered one non mushroom pizza, but we dedicated our meet to taste different dishes which has main ingredients as Mushrooms. It was an excellent meet & we loved tasting Mushroom items. Coming to the food:

Mushroom Al-A-Cappuccino Soup – When we order soup we generally order one by two. When we ordered one by two, we were suggested to order sumo version rather than regular version. But when we received the soup, one by two version was huge. Saying that taste & consistency of the soup was excellent. Recommended

Mushroom Duplex - It is fried Mushrooms stuffed with melted cheese and herbs. Taste was amazing. Dip went well with the dish. Recommended.

Broccoli & Mushroom Cheese Fondue - Broccoli & Mushroom were fried and lots of cheese was spread over it. It was not like traditional cheese fondue dish. Cheese was not served saperately. Broccoli & Mushroom were over fried. So we didn't liked it. When we asked to replace it, they were hesitant. Still they did but replaced dish was not good either. Not recommended at all.

Sauteed Mushrooms – In this dish Mushroom was souteed with herbs and garlics. Taste was average. 

RISO ALLA FUNGI - Mushroom Rissoto had an excellent flavour and the arborio rice was well cooked. Recommended

Wood Fired Pizza - It is customized pizza with a thin base prepared on wood. We selected spicy tomato sauce as base sauce. We selected sweet corn, garlic, olives & onions as veggies. Mozrella cheese was chosen as cheese. What came out was a delicious and awesome pizza. We loved it. Garlicy n spicy flavour enhanced the flavour of pizza. A must try.

Overall the experience was good. Few dishes were great and few were not so good. Pure veg Italian restaurant is a rare thing and a pure vegetarian person should not miss it. 

Pocket Pinch - 800 for 2 approx.

This place seems like a refreshing take on an Italian fast food restaurant, even though the name 'Sumo Dough' brings to mind a Japanese relevance. Anyway, that aside, the place has a road facing open kitchen. The furniture, cutlery, it's crude in terms of design, which I don't mean in a bad way. It has an earthy feeling, though personally it's too much of a mashup of design theories going on. Now, about the food.
The cold coffee was served in a classic american glass for milkshakes as you can see in the pictures. It looks good, tastes alright. A tad bit more sugar would have been nice. 
Service is pretty fast. The Saffron risotto looks and smells inviting, but it's alright, nothing great.

I am very fond of various vegetarian dishes...tge weirder it is the better...i alwaz like to try different places....I went here as alot of people recommended d place so I was like why not.....plus I love exploring new places with different cuisines....and I was very curious at the variety dey had and also excited.....but unfortunately the experience was really bad....I had ordered a cold coffee with ice cream but there was no taste of coffee...it was super sweet n tasted like milk....then we ordered penne pasta with mixed sauce and believe me I was totally surprised.....the dish was totally bland...I was unable to taste any of the spices....i tried adding some oregano and chilli flakes but sadly it did not improve the taste at all....next we ordered pizza....it looked really delicious but it was super spicy.....my nose started running...and my eyes started to swell up.... lastly to improve the taste I thought maybe the desert will be good.....but alas the waffles were super crispy....overall my experience was very bad and I will never recommend this place to anyone.....

Sitting left to the bhawanipur college gate this place has quite a bright and vibrant colours inside . With a limited number of items on the menu you expect a taste and quality to the T ,but the promise seems to be broken when you order the food. I ordered a pasta and a garlic bread both of which were quite bland ( pasta was more than dry). The pizza had a good crust and sauce dressing but the extra charged toppings and veggies we're so scarcely put that one could probably arrange a treasure hunt on the same to kill some time . 😂 Also to my surprise the card pos machine wasn't working so I had to walk down to the ATM and make the payment (so annoying!)

 I would better suggest going my big fat belly if you're hungry and in nearby area.

Don't know about other items but the make your own pizza was very bad. We choose cheese and onion pizza . It was thin crust and the corners were so hard it would give you toothache. Also there was hardly any onions and cheese. Not worth the given price.👎👎

Awesome place for Italian cuisine!
If you are looking for a vegetarian spot in budget but with delicious food, this is the spot!
It's located beside Chaibreak near Forum Courtyard.
I would suggest this place to my friends for sure.

The food here is good and competively priced. I had order food on home delivery so all the points and reviews are based just on food and not on presentation or ambiance.  Ordered for a ravioli in arrabiata sauce which was quite decent. Only the tanginess could be reduced and a little spiciness could be added,  jalapeno poppers which were suggested by them were a let down though. The cheese quality was not perfect and had curdled. Maybe that was during delivery so will give them a benefit of doubt there. Hope to visit very soon.

One of the best italian restaurants at kolkata,as it has many varieties in italian than any other restaurants. It takes time to serve food but its worth the time specially whole wheat pasta which generally people avoid to keep in menu as wheat is easy for digestive system to digest and good for health ,dessert was lovely, we had pizza, cheese balls,wheat pasta,roseti lip smacking food and pocket friendly even when we bunk at bhowanipore a new adda,and it has kath koila for hookah lovers,and the major thing it is pocket friends.

Located near Bhawanipur College..Sumo Dough is quite famous for its wood fired pizzas..but when I went there it wasn't available that time..so was a bit disappointed..and thus settled for its Garlic Confit loaf, homemade Ravioli made in Spinach-corn. Overall the place is very lively and colorful. The place sure is value for money. One-time visit.

I would say food is good but their service is weird. Went to this place twice and both of my visit was very very disappointing..on my first visit every dish was served in an interval of half an hour and bill had to be corrected three times and the same dish which was repeated was served in totally different proportion. Top of all this, on my second visit, the quantity of the same items was reduced to halftime when I confronted for the same, the staff turned out to be indifferent and started arguing. How can a outlet change the proportion of an item within two months of their start up. Totally weird place!!! I ordered for ravioli sumo portion which is suppose to have 12 pcs, was served with 6 pcs only and was said that other pieces are stuck to each other. 
Top of all, my number was taken by the management saying the owner would call me back for my complain but have not heard from him yet!!
Owner in reading- please do have some standard set for your cafe and decent approachable staff showing little courtesy towards customers. The food taste is definitely good only if little attention is given on the above points.

This recently opened restaurant provides the most delicious Italian food that suits the Indian taste bud.
To begin with, a non-exaggerated menu proved they emphasise a lot more on quality n taste...
The menu suits each. From fulfilling salads to cheesy pastas and bakes, from munchies to desserts.
We tried modern caprese salad, Philadelphia cheese roll, tomato exotic veg Risotto, Chef spl bake, Roesti, Tiramisu and all was fantastic!
The desserts should definitely be tried. You will end up craving for more.
The host and the servers ensured that we leave their den with a fulfilled smile in terms of friendly ambience, good hospitality, value for money and above all - Great Food!

The restaurant is located beside one of the famous colleges in the city, The Bhawanipur college. I went to this restaurant today with my office seniors and colleagues with expectation of good food. The ambience is pretty vibrant as you enter the place. With limited options in the menu (couple of items were not available), we ordered for a plate each of cheese balls, brocolli fondue, spinach ravioli, risotto, potato roesti, masala n herbs garlic bread and 12" sumo pizza. Out of the entire ordered food, ravioli and pizza were at least had little flavours; rest of the food being very bland. Overall, you can go and munch on pizza, to curb your hunger pangs. But otherwise, there are better food options in this area.

The place is very colorful and lively. The walls are adorned with sumo like caricatures.The choice of furniture is basic yet tasteful.
     It has a fairly limited menu which mainly consists of italian cuisine. We had ordered the following -

Minestrone soup 
It is basically tomato soup with an italian touch to it . The soup was very flavourful and quite filling as well,with the macaroni pasta added to it.

Mushroom duplex
This was basically mushroom and cheese with a fried, crispy outer shell. Super delish again.

Pizza (they only have one type of pizza)
This was given to us for tasting (free of cost) .It was a pleasant surprise for us by the staff. However , the pizza needs some improvement as there are a lot of better options already in the city.

The prices are very student friendly and wont burn a hole in your pocket. The service is amiable and prompt . Overall , Sumo Dough even with its limited variety of foods should do well because of its reasonable pricing and quality.

We ordered arachini balls which was presented vwry well. The pizza they gave us was complimentary. It was good and was crispy. Spinach and ricotta cheese ravioli in tomato basil sauce was excellent. Rosti with sour cream and bolognese sauce was good. The rosti was crispy. Overall this is a good and affordable place. The food is fresh and nice.

By the look from the street, it appeared more of a take away then a sit down. But it's entry is from the side lane and it's a small but nice place to go. Not very pricey so a good hangout place. The staff was warm and courteous. We tried the caprese salad which was fresh and nice and presented well. Then we had the arachini balls. The balls were gooey and melt in your mouth. The spinach and pasta ravioli was  well prepared. We also tried the rosti with a bolognese sauce. The rosti was thick and crispy. 
Just a few quick pointers- the tomato basil sauce and bolognese sauce tasted similar. Also try to give 6 portions instead of 5 in a dish as it's easier to share.
Overall a very nice visit.

I picked this place for lunch because of the wood fired pizzas. But when we went there, the pizzas weren't available because of some technical issue. The stranger thing is that the staff said the pizzas are available in the evenings only on trial basis and not during lunch hours. So the exact and true reason of not serving pizzas then is not known. 

The decor is simple and urban with sufficient lights, both natural and artificial. The server seemed a bit confused himself. We ordered a Philadelphia Cheese Roll and Riso Al A Fungi, both perfectly cooked and presented. The water we were served was dirty and we asked for a replacement. It was carried out immediately but the second ones were dirty as well. So whether their glasses aren't cleaned well or the water is dirty is what the management needs to take care of.

I went to this plave for lunch with a friend. The very first reason we chose this place was because of its pizza.  However we were very disappointed to find that they were not making pizzas for some technical difficulty which was not explained to us properly.  The staff here is very reluctant.  The very basic thing in a joint is serving water which surely they did but only that the glass of water was dirty.  After asking them to clean it and serve fresh clean water they did that immediately.  For our lunch we ordered the 
Philadelphia cheese roll, 
Riso al a fungi .
Bith thr items were tasty and had an acceptable presentation.  The taste is also very good.  Its a pocket friendly place as well. Easily recongnizal,.

My visit to this place was a worth. portions were well served, value for money, cooperative staffs, good service. Menu designed is short but apt as it's easy to order. 

pasta, garlic bread, rosti, and tiramisu were the one which I have ordered for and i just Loved it.
except for the chef's special bake which I ordered in my second visit. My experience was bad but I would still refer this place to my dear friends and family.

Poor show for a restaurant which is on the main happening streets of the city.
We ordered a Chefs Special Bake which was decent.
Raviolli mixed sauce,decent but low in quantity compared to the prices.
Garic Confit Loaf - which upon asked,the waiter said its a big loaf of bread loaded with parmesan cheese and baked.what we got was a small bread loaf which we get in local market worth rs.15 max. Simple butter n sum herbs and nothing that you can call it baked.simply put in a foil n served.Upon questioning them they said its like this only.TOTAL WASTE OF RS.150 INCLUDING TAX.
NOT AT ALL WORTH THE ARROGANT BEHAVIOUR OF A NEW RESTAURANT. THEY COULD HAVE IMPROVED THE DISH IN A MATTER OF MINUTES,ONLY IF THEY CARED.

DONT GO

DISCLAIMER: Cheese is my Kryptonite and to be fair, they have used it brilliantly to their advantage. It is not very often that I disengage myself from the conversation and wipe out every minute remains off the plate. 
Sumo Dough is the Italian Stallion of the city. Period. They leave very little spectrum for the diner to complain about. 
I wouldn't bother to list the dishes we had and comment about them,as every dish stands out in it's own way. 
Although I would definitely recommend the Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli which was spectacular and the Pesto Pasta along with the Chef Special Bake dish. I loved the prices and appreciate the option to choose the servings(Normal/Sumo) which is a saviour and leaves some scope to try other stuff when the diners are in small numbers.

Located just beside the Story building. When you enter the restaurant, it welcome with the sumo made on the wall. Too many waiters hovering around as well as standing outside. Only few tables were reserved. Ambience is simple and decent. It has an open kitchen. Service could have been better. 
We had ordered Garlic confit loaf, homemade Ravioli made in Spinach and corn, Baked stuffed Potato, Potato Rosti with sour cream made in Tomato basil sauce. Staffs were welcoming. Pocket pinch was on a higher side compared to it's quantity of food. 
All over a nice place to visit, family environment.

Well, don't go with much expectations on food menu, they have kept it less which in my point of view if best, as wastage would be less.
Ordered ravioli made in spinach and corn which was good. Then ordered stuffed bake potato which was again good.
I was done in this :P :P

They haven't started brickwoood pizza yet, waiting for it.

In Elgin Road, u can go and grab a bite. :)

It's an all veg Italian place. Located near bhawanipur college, it's very easy to find and they have smartly used the spot. Little chubby characters decorate the wall. And the seating arrangement is decent too.
The food here is really good. They know their pasta apart. 

I have visited twice and i've had their
Penne in pesto sauce which tasted amazing. We had the choice of two veggies and i chose bell peppers and corn. The sauce was simple but very tasty and rich, the pasta was nice and al-dente. Must try.

Cheese Garlic bread: no one can go wrong with bread and lots of cheese. 

Penne in cheese sauce: this one is a creamy preparation. With the choice of two veggies, corn and bell peppers. It was nicely made and tasted good. The ones who eat less spicy and prefer creamier and a little sweet sauce can order this.

Ravioli stuffed with spinach and ricotta in tomato basil sauce: you can never go wrong with the classic filling. And the tomato sauce was just perfect. 

Tiramisu: if you love coffee, you'll fall in love with it all over again. It's creamy, melt in your mouth but not too sweet. Balanced with the perfect amount of coffee. Do give this a try!

Waffles: you get a choice of choosing your toppings. I chose strawberries, maple syrup and blueberries. They served it with a lot of whipped cream, and maple syrup was on the side. The waffles had crispy edges and were served warm. The tart berries went with it really well. The only complaint is that there were dead ants in the maple syrup, ofcourse it was changed as soon as we pointed it out.

The service on my first visit was too slow but the next time they were much better organized. Pocket pinch is decent.
P.S. Did i tell you they have whole wheat pasta available too? Enjoy😉

*Chef's Special* (Baked veggie lasagna), is a must try. The portion sizes served is quite welcoming and filling.
*Plain Garlic Bread* is quite crispy and tasteful, recommended.
*Spinach Ravioli* now this did not live upto the expectation as well as the other dishes did.

All this for about 450 for 2, which seems decent for a speciality Italian restro.

Ambiance is fine, colorful with decent music played in the background but nothing fancy to attract your attention on the inside. This joint does look quirky on
The outside though.

Still got to try their pizzas and desserts, until then, keep a watchout for an updated review.

Once you enter and see the place and the menu, you will be dissapoined. But your disappointment ends there.

the food is excellent .

We ordered tomato basil risotto,  mushroom rosti, and lasagna all of which were amazing.

What is a must order here are the Waffles , we ordered waffles with strawberry and blueberry with nutella and it was divine. I can go this this place again and again just for the waffles  

Hope they keep up to the amazing quality food they serving.

Located right next to Story on Elgin Road. It was almost fully empty when I went. Seemed like too less customers and too many waiters hovering around and even standing outside the gate. Ambience is simple, could have been better. 
Ordered Chef's special lasagne- had one fat layer of cheese, veggies and bottom layer was spinach. It tasted divine! Cheese lovers- dont think twice before ordering this. 
Tiramisu- Looked lovely, was really soft. Just melted in my mouth. Couldn't have been better.
The service though could have been better. Had asked one of the waiters to refill my glass with water, and he seemed like he was doing me a favour.

Lip-smacking food. Ordered for a Ravioli and Garlic bread. The ambience is perfect, also the open kitchen system is out of the box. 
A must visit place :)

Sumo Dough located at Elgin Road near to Forum. the ambiance and interior is not very hifi may be keeping in mind the young College crowd. 
Ordered the following
Creamy Mushroom soup : the soup was very thick and full of cream. Had it been a bit thinner would have like it more. Taste was good.
Bruchheta with sundried tomatoes spinach and olives was 4 pcs in a portion and was good to taste.
Creamy Tomato and Exotic Vegetable Rissoto was near to perfect. the Creamyness and veggeis mixed in right proportion.
Potato Roesti with sour cream was not as per expectations  and was very oily.

Service was ok

Overall good food 
Pocket Pinch was 755 for 2

100% vegetarian and outstanding food, no compromise on flavours, well made and just about well lit. Not very satisfied with the service, because i felt they are not yet trained enough to run at 100% occupancy. 

ACs are installed right above you blowing chilled air on your face, makes you uncomfortable to sit and the food would become cold faster unless u sit at the table right in front of the gate and the one next to it OR the first table in the middle line towards the kitchen. Everyone almost got all the ACs off while we were there. A lady landed up shouting at the staff coz he refused to switch off the AC.

Ignore the above issue and you will feel satisfied with the food. Centrally located and easily approachable. Car parking can be a problem provided you walk a little further away and walk it down the roughest patch of footpath in the city. 

Appreciate the choice of crockery but would like the management to have the good soup spoons, the regular spoons with such amazing crockery was a put off. The SUMO soup bowl is really sumo, wow!!! Amazingly prepared. Unfortunately, didn't get to taste their pizzas as the machine wasn't working, nevertheless will go once again for it. 

Do go!!!

So this is a newly opened Italian joint near Bhawanipore College just beside Story.
The name and the outside branding of the place is very innovative and eye catchy.
I was very excited about the place because I am an Italian lover and when I got to know it's very reasonable too, I had to try it without any doubt. 
We tried Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli, which was soft and delicious. The pesto sauce was great. 
Chef's special is another great dish. The presentation and the different layers on it was the best out of all. 
Next we tried Broccoli & mushroom cheese fondue. Unfortunately, it was a big turn-off. Both were served fried with the cheese sauce. It was like having Broccoli & mushroom pakoda with cheese sauce.
This dish surely needs a makeover. 
Surprisingly, we were given complimentary mocktail of our choice, for their feedback. It was a peach iced tea. It was refreshing.
The place has a simple decor with an open kitchen. The menu is also a two page one, which can be exhausted in few visits.
If you want to have Italian at a reasonable rate, then this is the best place.
I really wanted to try Tiramisu, but was full for the day. Something that would make me come again.

Located near the Bhawanipur Education Society College at Elgin Road, Sumo Dough, an all vegetarian Italian restaurant, looks to be attractive from the outside. Glancing at its stylish facade on the first go makes one want to try out its food. So one fine evening I decided to order some dinner from Sumo Dough. Ordering was a simple process as always, thanks to Zomato. But delivery was a bit delayed, after a couple of calls to Zomato, it took about 20 minutes more than the estimated time.

I ordered the following items :-
1)Jalapeno Cheese Poppers - these came shaped like cutlets instead of Poppers but were fried very perfectly with a generous filling of cheese and jalapeno on the inside. Complemented with the sour cream dip, these tasted good. (Rating 4/5).

2)Baked Stuffed Potatoes - these were jacket potatoes topped with cheese and herbs. Tasting just above average, these came with a cheese dip which was quite nice. (Rating 3/5).

3)Penne pasta in Pesto Sauce - I love pasta in Pesto Sauce and it is not common to get the perfect Pesto pasta in restaurants. This one here though, was close to perfect with generous amount of olive oil and cheese. Special kudos for this dish. (Rating 4.5/5)

4)Creamy tomato and exotic vegetable risotto - the risotto was perfectly cooked in the tangy tomato sauce. I couldn't see the exotic vegetables on this one, though. (Rating 3.5/5).

The quantity was good enough for 3 people and the packaging was done very well. Pricing is quite reasonable for the quality of food they serve. Other than the delayed delivery, overall a good experience.

All the Italian food lovers, here's a gourmet stop for you all in the prime area!

Located right near story(crossword earlier), this place has excellent Italian food and deserts awaiting for all the veggie food lovers. Yes, you heard it right, this place is pure vegetarian and has excellent Italian food menu.

With the open kitchen, facing the streets, the interiors of the restaurant is really colourful and chirpy.

The menu card is also very simple and clear with all the food items described well and the menu items are really priced appropriately and is extremely affordable restaurant.

 
So to begin with , we ordered for Bruschettas and potato roesti in the beginning as munches and the portion was really sufficent for two of us.

The roesti was served with sour cream and  tomato basil sauce and was extremelly creamy and sumptous.

We then ordered for Bruschettas which was again very fresh a dish served with freshly chopped tomatoes on the top woth feta cheese that added on to the flavour really well.

Coming to the main course, we were quite full but then couldn't resist ordering for pink sauce pastas as once you are in Italian restaurant , you can't just resist Pizzas, Pastas and canellonis..

They have live wood burn pizza area which serves you with hot wood burnt pizza with toppings and sauces of your own choice.

Jain food options are also available here, so all the Jain food lovers grab your meal hurrily here!

Coming back to the pastas, they were really well saucy and topped with toppings of our own choice.

So when we were realy just getting to the deserts section, we were told by the chef to try the Jalapeno poppers too as it was really good a dish according to them and as you all know it's quite difficult to say no for food , we ended up ordering that too and it was very delicious and crisp.Its a must try.

Coming to the deserts section , we called for the signature Kahlua Tiramisu which was really eyecandy for coffee lover like me.

I simply loved the cake and was really very tasty and was not that bitter too.

So please all the coffee lovers, go for this delicacy.


There were lot of other good food options and desert options too which is in my list for the next visit of mine which is going to be super soon!

So all the vegetarian food lovers, visit this restaurant soon and have a great sumptous meal for yourself and your family.

Don't forget to drop in your feedback here.

Happy eating and happy feeding!

We have always loved italian cuisine and when we found that Sumo Dough has some varieties of ravioli and other dishes , we did not hesitate much before trying out this place!
Its a very bright cafe with good and simple interiors! We loved the appearance from the exterior and wishes to be served well!
But alas, our experience here wasn't a hearty one...
At first we ordered Spinach and Ricotta ravioli in Cheese Sauce. It was served in a cute ceramic style bowl but the ravioli pieces were sticking to each other and some had already split into chunks! The chese sauce was too thick but the taste was fairly good!  
Next, we tried the Mushroom Duplex which was crumb coated and cheese stuffed button mushroom and fried! We did not like it as the taste was really bland!
So after these two not so good dishes, we did not feel like trying anything else!
The billing system and staff both are good. The ambience is calm and light but there is a lot of room for improvement in their food!

P.S.- They should really start serving some mocktails and not just the usual soft drinks and Red Bull!

This place is completely average. We started with jalapeños cheese poppers and cigar rolls. Cheese poppers were good but cigar was completely bald. Than came jacket potatao and roesti. Jacket potato tasted like bengali alu dum and roesti was worse. It was like a fat cake of boiled potato with little sauce. I don't why do they serve only sour cream with all their dishes. Should have some other dips. Than came pastas and mixed herb bread. Alio olio pasta didnot had olive oil. It seemed it was made of butter. Mixed herb bread was average. My last visit for sure

Well , a must go place . Mentioning right from the warm welcome that they gave ,their service and their suggestions regarding different dishes was a good gesture.
Coming to the food - i being a foodie have been to many places and have many food joints in my hitlist, this is surely one of them.
Right from the first dish we ordered *Chef's special*(A MUST TRY) followed by a *Mushroom Duplex* and ending our meal with Kahlua Tiramisu (could have been better) the taste ,the flavors , the quantity and the richness of the food was just up to the mark .
Overall a very good experience and would describe it in one phrase as "Worth the money" . Looking forward to try more dishes in this place . Will keep you guys knowing 😊

Newly opened near Prapti showroom in Elgin Road, this place is sure miss if you haven't discovered it yet.

Deciding upon a casual dining, the place is pretty much it.
We ordered for a portion of Cheese Garlic Bread (the bread could have been softer), Cannelloni Florentine, Broccoli and Mushroom Foundue (the combination didn't really taste as good as it was expected) and Tiramisu (one of the best I've had lately).

The portions are appropriate for exactly two, not too pricey.
P.S.: Being a music lover, I'd suggest the selection of tracks could have been better!
Cheers. 😁

If you are a fan of Italian food then Sumo Dough @ Elgin Road is the place you got to go. The place serves Out of the world Pastas, Desserts & Other Italian stuff.

Tried the Cheese Garlic Bread, Pasta in white sauce, Spaghetti Bolognaise was all a tasty treat. To top it up the Tiramisu was just out of the world and we couldn't stop having more of it.

This place is definitely a beautiful combination of great food, colorful ambiance and good music. Would love to come back again.

Food with a soul.. that's what came into my mind when I tasted the Italian at Sumo Dough. The minimalistic interior, the concept of a QSR are there to help you appreciate the food even more especially for the prices that they are offering. The balance of the flavors in the salads, the starters and the pasta is extraordinary. Just the kind of food that you never even knew that you wanted. They also offer much more variety than many Italian restaurants in Kolkata currently so you can visit here again and again and not get bored of the menu. Kudos to the entire team for giving us a restaurant after long which is here to stay. My recommendation would be the cream cheese bread and the mix sauce pasta, but feel free to try anything and everything.. I'm sure you won't be disappointed ;)

Sumo Dough! The Italian restaurant I was waiting to visit and review since the time it came up at Elgin! 
This Italian restaurant is amazingly done with minimal interiors which are perfect for a good dining experience ! 
The food here is outstanding ! And this place has definitely won my heart in providing for the ultimate Italian food experience ! 
So coming to what one should order :
One can try almost any dish here and expect it to be just perfect!. 
But my recommendations would be:
• mushroom al-a-cappuccino 
•modern caprese
•pasta in pesto (absolutely my favourite ! )
•Philadelphia cheese rolls
•riso al-a-funghi 
•watermelon and feta salad
•potato roesti and sour cream
•tiramisu ( can't leave without ordering this one! )

This all vegetarian dining place is just what an Italian cuisine lover had been looking for  ! :) 
Surely looking forward to my next visit ! :) 
Way to go Sumo Dough!

Once u start eating.. u will long for more.. be it the Canneloni or the Spaghetti Aglio Olio or the RisottoAl Zafferano... The cream of Mushroom soup is just like munching on some mushrooms.. the mushroom chunks make it exotic.. and beware if u call for the tiramisu.. u would definitely call for the second.. there was more to try as nothing we called for wasn't WoW.. so there is definitely a second time.. so the pizza oven not in place is definitely not an issue.. you wouldn't miss it ...

Was eyeing this place when it was being made. Finally visited it when they opened doors last week. Sumo Dough is a casual Italian QSR concept based eatery located on elgin road right beside the Bhawanipur college. 
The place is a 40 seater and they have a beautiful open kitchen. 
They have introduced pay first and then eat concept and it is a Wonderful change from the monotony. 

FOOD- 

• Mushroom cappuccino - We ordered for their individual portion which was sufficient for two. It was creamy and the mushroom flavor was spot on! #Recommended 
• Caprese bruschetta with bocconcini cheese- was a beautiful medley of pesto on the base, tomato caprese and toped with the beautiful mozzarella! #recommended
• Chefs Special Bake- a hearty Italian meal composed of green arborio rice cooked with cheese, vegetables and cheese. It was delicious and was quite filling #recommended
• Mushroom fritters were decent but a little bland.
• Penne pesto - was delicious and I loved that they made a rustic pesto with no cream! #recommended
• Blueberry cheesecake was not the best I have had. It can be improved.
• Loved the tiramisu, it was divine!

Overall, service was good and I quite enjoyed my experience here.
Will surely be back for the pizzas!

First of all...great concept..but very badly executed..staff are like a pain to deal with..the owners or the manager don't even bother to ask you how the experience was..no water served..no one to ask if you need something else..no one to suggest what to order..it's basically a Italian dhaba if I can call it that..issues started as we stepped in..no one to guide us to the table..menu presented..no greetings nothing..no glass on the table..it's not a problem to stand up and order food but then why a service charge..even if it's 5%..the only good thing was the pasta agliolio..a horrible place with horrible service...please do visit if you really wana spoil your mood..certainly was a happy Republic Day..

Pls mention on the entrance if the pizza isn't avaliable..don't waste the time of your clients by giving them excuses..avoid at all cost kind of place..

Location-Elgin,Kolkata.

When it comes to Italian cuisine,Sumo Dough has earned a spot among my top list of italian restaurant.We had been eyeing this place since we saw its long poster consisting of a sumo,wearing an chef attire and a green mark depicting pure veg restaurant.The street facing open kitchen concept is rarely found in such well established restaurants but one thing which we disliked was their system of queuing up to place an order.Now coming to food,ambiance and service-

Ambiance and service-The ambiance at this place is quite calm and soothing.The interiors are simple and pleasant to eyes.At a time they can accomodate almost 30 people.The service is also quite fast and reliable.The staff is extremely cooperative and had been trained with the dishes very well.Just a flaw which we saw was the queueing up system which should be discontinued soon.

Food-They serve pure veg italian cuisine and had a huge variety in it.The quantity served is sufficient for two and is very reasonable.We had-

1:Masala Cheese Herb Bread
2:Philadelphia Cheese Roll
3:Chef's Special Bake
4:Kahlua Turamisu
5:Nutella Banana Waffles

All the above dishes were quite good in taste and presentation but our favourite was "Phuladelohia Cheese Roll".

Food-4/5
Ambiance-4.5/5
Service-4/5

This new place will surprise you with its amazing options in the menu, and the reasonable price will delight your pockets! I ended up eating way more than i should have, and was happy about it. The food was mouth watering. From the ravioli to the crepes and the cheesecakes, my taste buds were all satiated. Plus points for the super reasonable rates! A must try new joint and surely not just a one time visit place!

I had been eyeing this place for quite sometime waiting for it to open. The open kitchen concept is old but one that is viewable from the streets seemed one of a kind to me and very captivating. Moreover, a pure veg restaurant was another big plus for me. I walked in with high hopes and tried out a "Philadelphia Cheese Roll" and the "Kahlua Tiramisu", both of which were chef recommendations. The cheese rolls were quite amazing and cheesy. The tiramisu was moist and spongy, different from the ones I have had at other places. I think I liked that too.

What was a BIG turn off was the staff's response. I asked for regular water twice and the server said they serve only mineral water. I am against the concept of cafes making business even out of water. I don't even think that is legal. Five minutes later I see a table beside me being served water in glasses. Curious (you do not generally serve mineral water in glasses), I asked if what they served was mineral water and this other server confirmed to me saying it was regular water. I understand it is a new joint, staff training must not be top notch. I can forgive some hiccups in service or your servers not knowing the dishes that well. But do they not even know whether you serve water or not? Do customers have to look at the service made to others around and demand the same? This was a major major major disappointment.

Changed from 3.5 to 1 after second visit. The staff is extremely uncourteous. Two of us went and asked for a 3rd chair to keep some of our belongings where as the entire outlet was empty,there was no rush. They kept asking ma'am how many people, ma'am keep your bags down, ma'am we cannot put a chair here people cannot walk. So we suggested we shift to a 4 people table, keep in mind, the entire outlet accommodating atleast 20-25 or more is empty. They still denied. So, we walked out. What else does one expect. First build existing client base and then up your expectations. The scenario would be entirely approached differently if : 1) the place was even half full and 2) the staff didn't go about throwing attitude.

Firstly, I would like to say dat I was happy with the food quality n presentation. What I disliked the most was that v had to stay d in a queue to order our food n pay 1st n then the waiters will get the food to our table. This method is applicable at food courts n not at a fast food centre.  I got up 3 times to order food after each course of meal. They have ample staff who can take orders n serve the food to the table and make the eating g experience enjoyable. Most importantly Just bcoz v ordered 2 cold drinks they didn't serve us water after putting in repeated request to get water. V asked for it 4 times but non of the waiters responded. 
The deserts were very average compared to the cost they had quoted. With tax Tiramisu n Cheesecake came upto Rs.450 which was not worth the place n ambience.

WHAT ERKED ME THE MOST WAS..... V GOT UP SO MANY TIMES TO ORDER FOOD N V PAID SERVICE CHARGE@5% ON THE TOTAL BILL of 1450.  QUIET DISPLEASING AND ANNOYING!
Plus Zomato has been given wrong info. Meal for 2 is by no means a Rs.300 for 2ppl. It would definitely be more as no dish is less than 150. This rate is excluding taxes so the rate definitely goes up.

Nobody was courteous enuf to ask the customers their experiences. This is now happening at all the new joints.... The owner or the head makes sure that he goes from table to table to take suggestions but here nobody was bothered.

Pizza oven had not be set up yet. This might be annoying for some people but not for me. As for the ambience it is great but a bit noisy. Spaghetti was great but extremely spicy. Cheese garlic bread and jalapeno poppers were awesome. Roesti was great too. Would highly recommend this place.

An amazing place with outstanding food! Calcutta had been in desperate need of a restaurant which serves top quality gourmet Italian food at affordable prices - and Sumo Dough does exactly that! The mushroom al cappuccino and the cheese cigars were too good and the highlight of the meal.  

Looking forward to my next meal already!
