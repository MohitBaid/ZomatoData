The smell of freshly baked products welcome you as you enter tollygange metro station, courtesy aoji khaoji bakery. A board that says restaurant and bakery, didn't try their restaurant but have tried their bakery.

The only serve a single flavour a day, tried their rusk perfectly crisp and their cake, chocolate being the flavor of the day. The cake was perfectly baked, spongy and no cream or frosting of any sort.

Visit for takeway of tea cakes.

I have always been a fan of freshly home-baked items and this place serves just that, along with the regular chinese and north indian items. As I tried only their baked items, I am going to review on the same. Located at Tollygunje metro station, this place profuses a very welcoming aroma of fresh baking that makes you take a pause in your usual saunter and breathe in the aroma! You can see live baking over there, and they serve cakes, cookies, rusts, white bread, brown bread and many more....crisp, warm, fresh...though in one flavour only. Yet this small, humble place is worth a try and brings in a plethora of nostalgic feeling of home and baking.

A small outlet just beside the Uttam Kumar metro station. This is generally famous for it's bakery items. Cakes, cookies and breads are available. Momos are also there on the menu. It's like a home bakery shop. Not many varieties are there, it only has one flavour per day but whatever is available is tasty. Quality is good. Price is minimal.
