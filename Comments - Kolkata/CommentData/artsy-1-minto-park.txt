Artsy Cafe as the name says is the first art cafe of Kolkata. Kolkata is full of creative minds which needs little exposure and audience. Artsy provides a platform for the budding artists to showcase their art to the city. The vibrant colours used for the decor, comfy sofas and rotating chair gives a fun quotient to the cafe. You can have a sip of coffee and read a book off of the shelves. 

Location: It is quite difficult to locate the cafe at first. The lane which leads to Ashok hall school for girls, Minto Park is where you will find this place. 

Coming to the Food we had, 
🎆Guava Pumpkin seed smoothie
🎆 Creamy Mango Coconut smoothie
🎆 Banana Peanut with Spinach smoothie 
🎆 Thai Chicken salad
🎆 Asian Peanut Noodle salad
🎆 Red bean Burger 
🎆 Vietnamese Summer Rolls
🎆 Thick cut French toast 
🎆 Bhetki Wrap
🎆 Grilled Three Cheese Sandwich  
🎆 Chicken Bahn mi 
🎆 Pan-Roasted Chicken 
🎆 Dark Chocolate Expresso
🎆 Hot Chocolate 
🎆 Acai Mango iced tea
🎆 Affogato Trifle with dark chocolate expresso 

All the dishes where significant and distinct in their flavour and texture. It was worth your money and I will definitely recommend  and would visit again! ❤

I've went yesterday after finding this new place. The direction of this place might be a little difficult but google map is always there as your helping hand on road. First of all, this is Kolkata's first art café with some unique dishes which you may not be found anywhere easily.
1. The ambience, the décor was the plus point of every beautifulness of them. That's truly instagram worthy!
2. In food, I would like to recommend you the smoothies! I liked creamy mango coconut one. For main course, bhetki wrap and pan roasted chicken were just amazing. You should try that bhekti wrap once. And last but not the least, dessert! I had strawberry french toast and the very beautiful affogato trifle. Both of them were just on point.
This is a really nice place to hangout with your friends and family as well.

This place is tastefully decorated with vivid colours, eye-catching paintings and unique artifacts. The ambience is so sprightly that you will want to spend hours inside. Cafe frappe was good, aromatic jasmine tea was smooth and the meditative tulsi harmony tea was invigorating. Chicken Banh Mi was excellent. The french omlette was scrumptious with the bacon filling. Congenial staff with an excellent service makes your visit even better. The book corner has an amazing collection. Icing on the cake was the music that was being played. Definitely worth multiple visits.

Be it to catch up with friends or to spend some lone time, this place offers the perfect ambience for all. The staff is very friendly and takes extra care to find out whether you liked the food or not. Surely going to get back soon.

A month old place showcasing talent and also offering cozy ambience. Ideal to spend quality time with friends or even oneself. You have great books as companions. The look and feel is good with courteous staff. It is spacious with good and comfortable seating arrangements. Food is okay though we only tried Cappuccino, Bacon and Acai Mango Iced Tea. Great place to chill and get inspired by some of the budding artists. Looking forward to more such visits. :)

This is a very new place in the city . Tucked away in a lane opposite Minto Park , this cafe looks so pretty and eye pleasing . 
Some amazing paintings adorn the walls . The lighting is so much on point . Proper seating arrangements including lush sofas , comfortable chairs and a few bean bags . So 5/5 on ambience for sure . 

Coming to the food and beverages , we had 

⚫️Chicken Banh Mi : This was recommended by the chef and we loved it . Very generous fillings of chicken and veggies made it oh so delicious . 

⚫️Hot Chicken Sandwich : This was another winner . The buns were slightly crispy and the fillings of chicken and mayo were a lipsmacking . 

⚫️French Chicken Omelette : Hands down one of the best omelettes have had . Fluffy and soft . 

⚫️Hot Chocolate : This was nice . Hardly do ppl go wrong with this . Loved it . 

⚫️ Vietnamese Iced Coffee : Disappointing. This wasn't the strong one , it left that bitter aftertaste . 

⚫️ Pomegranate Orange : This also was a letdown . The blend itself was new to me and honestly I didn't like it . 

⚫️ Dark chocolate Zucchini Bread : It couldn't have been better than this . One of the finest desserts I have had . Not overly sweet and leaves a pleasant aftertaste . 😍

Like every cafe , this too had a few flaws , but nevertheless it stands out. They need to work a bit on the beverage front . Their food is out of the world . 

Pocket Pinch :
 600 for 2 for a light snack . 
1200 for 2 for a nice lunch . 

Service : Quick and Prompt .

In the lane where Ashok Hall Higher Secondary school is, you'll find this beautiful cafe. The moment you enter you get a very artistic vibe. The chairs and tables are made of good quality wood and it's an amazing place to spend a few hours sipping on coffee & tea. 
We went on a Saturday night for dinner. The menu is small but perfect. The best dishes from around the world have been put together for foodies like me. 
We tried the 
Asian Noodle Salad - it was perfect! The balance of flavours was amazing. You could actually taste each of the flavours in every bite. 
Vietnamese Rice Paper rolls - I've had this many times in Kolkata but theirs was the most authentic version by far. 
Red bean burger- purely sinful. The bread was soft and complemented the Patty and salsa very well. 
Tofu Banh mi - this is a very authentic Vietnamese dish and if you aren't used to those flavours you may not like it but we loved it! 
Kaffir Lime parfait- One word, yummy! 
Berry Queen Iced Tea & Vietnamese Iced coffee were our choice of drinks which were both excellent! I love how authentic this place is. 

We also ordered the mezze platter but there were some issues with it. However, the owner was courteous enough to apologise for the problem and cancelled it for us. He was a very good host and took our feedback very well. The staff and service is also very quick considering they are just a month old. Definitely going back very soon! 

P.s- there will be a little problem of parking in this lane, so Uber it! :)

Only a month old , Artsy is a platform for budding artists to display their work. With cozy blue walls and heavy studio lights , it won’t be long before people start swarming into this place. 
They have an interesting menu. The selection of drinks is very good. So we had the berry iced tea, Vietnamese cold coffee , hot chocolate and the iced mocha. All the drinks were wonderful. We thought the iced tea was too overpowering. And in the end , the owner had us taste the tea again , this time made well , perfect with the balance of berries and tea. The Vietnamese coffee was tasty as well , owing to the condensed milk in it. The hot chocolate was heavenly. It’s the best I’ve had in Kolkata. A little on the heavier side and at the same time giving you the comfort and warmth on a cold winter evening , it’s the best option you could go with. 
In food , we had the summer rolls , pan roasted chicken , bhekti wrap and the mezze platter. 
The summer rolls were very good. Vermicelli , carrots , bell peppers and basil wrapped in rice paper was served with a salty and spicy soy sauce. It was a very balanced dish as the rolls had little flavour in them , and the sauce , lots of it. Basil dominated the dish entirely. We had the pan roasted chicken which was served on a bed of sautéed mushrooms and beans. They were delicious and garlicky. The chicken was cooked really well and had crispy skin on it. It boasted of a beautiful brown colour. Next we had the mezze platter which had falafel, pita bread , tzatziki, carrot hummus and tabouleh. It was amazing as the bread was warm and soft , the falafel was seasoned really well and the dips , all of them were really good. The bhekti wrap was also really good. Tender bhekti strips were wrapped in tortilla with chips , lettuce and mayonnaise in it. 
The owner had us taste the two cakes they had on the menu , the banana and walnut bread and the chocolate and zucchini cake. The banana bread was adequate in sweetness and in the bitterness of bananas. It’s a must try for people who do not like bananas. The chocolate and zucchini cake was heavenly , really soft and the zucchini added a different texture to the cake. 
Having said all of this , we had a really great time in this cafe. The staff is well trained and helpful. They apologised when the order would arrive late , they took to guiding us through the menu and were very friendly. 
The owner is a very warm and welcoming woman. She explained to us the concept behind this cafe , how it came to be , etc. 
Every plate of food was a work of art at Artsy. Such beautiful plating is seldom seen. The prices are very reasonable. It’s a really good place for hanging out and for art enthusiasts.

Quite possibly the best coffee in the city. None of the usual issues like a too-fine grind, hard tamp, hot milk, etc. The Macchiato leaves a lovely aftertaste, and does not feel bitter at all. The Cappuccino is like a dessert (do not let the apparent bubbles in the photo fool you, this was one of the tightest microfoams I have seen, with strong polish). 

Both the teacakes are great, the Dark Chocolate Zucchini has a consistency between a brownie and a cupcake, and the Walnut Banana has a lovely subtle flavor. The chips that come with the Tofu Banh Mi could be better, but the preparation of the tofu and the pickles more than make up for it.

The staff are courteous, and extremely bright and responsive. The space is also designed well, is lit adequately and has plenty of room, but has some minor coherence issues visually, which could be a result of having to design a space amenable to change, as they exhibit artists and hold workshops. Even so it looks better than most cafes in the city.

Overall, one of the best cafes I have visited in a while, definitely so for Kolkata. I hope they continue being this good in the future.

⏳I visited this cafe with 4 of my friends for a quick coffee. We ordered multiple drinks and liked all of them specially the cold mocha shake. The balance of coffee and chocolate was perfect. Since I am a chocolate lover I loved their dark chocolate zucchini bread. 

Will definitely visit this place when I visit Kolkata next,. Special kudos to the architect who has done a fabulous job with the decor!!

The cafe gives a very homely feel and I can see this cafe become my go to place when I’m in the mood for a good cup of coffee or when I need to get work done in a relaxing ambience. The music really goes well with the “arsty” theme. 
The food menu offers a good variety and the staff is extremely friendly.
The dark chocolate espresso and tofu banh mi are    must try items.

You get transported to a different dimension at Artsy.
Great art work on display, warm hosts and good vibes. The Tofu Banh Mi ( made with French Baguette) is my personal favourite! Vietnamese Summer Rolls hit the right note too. Smart assortment of Tea & Coffee.

Recommended for everyone looking to spend quality time with themselves and their loved ones! Cheers!

The cafe is new in town, so I guess we can actually rate the service in coming time..
But for the first experience, it has amazing outlook..
The interiors of the cafe are that of an elegant coffee house with books and silence to relax.. 😇
Pocket pinch is relatively high.. But we were given a complementary dessert.. So that makes staff really committed to make it a worthwhile experience..
We ordered bean burger which tasted heavenly.. 😍
And dessert could have been better..
Presentation adhered to the professional standards 👍
Service took us waiting more than usual..
All in all I guess, if worked upon some shortcomings.. The cafe can be our daily spot. 😃
