This is my "roj ka adda place". After college we go there approximately 5 days in a week. Though it a vegetarian restaurant but the food is that delicious.
The mouth watering varities of South Indian food and the awesome Chinese dishes in a very pocket friendly rate is just delightful.

NEW REVIEW : I am editing my previous review. As you can see in the bottom my old review is there where I gave 5 stars to the restaurant. However what prompted me to reduce their rating drastically to 2 stars is their consistent decrease in quantity of food subsequent to my first rating.

Earlier curd rice used to be given in a wide mouthed plastic container and lemon and tomato rice in paper box with almost full quantity. Off late their quantity has reduced. Curd rice is a minimal small round container and same round container for the other rice's as well.

Meanwhile their taste has also seen a deterioration recently. When you order these items in the night invariably garnishing or accompaniments will be missing. Quantity will also be less. By evening if the restaurant is running less of the products then they must call the customer and let them know, since we order from home and wait for delivery expecting the same amount that we always receive.

The key to earn more customers is consistency in their services. This restaurant seems to have lost that over time. Hope the management takes notice of the review and improves their services to what they were before.

Old REVIEW :
Ordered their mini Maha thali meals. Dosas were good, soft and crispy. Vada had authentic taste. Tomato chutney provided was tasty. White coconut chutney had taste like the ones made in Chennai. Sambhar had authentic south Indian taste. Meals were served with roti, rice, sambhar, buttermilk, rasam, korma, poriyal, pickle and appalam. Pickle was lemon. Poriyal was beans with coconut.
Quantity sufficient. Parcel was properly packed. No leak. Delivered in time. Meals were hot.

Ordered on swiggy. Food was okish.. Vadas were preferred over the idlis. The idlis were not soft.... 

The chutney packed with 2 idlis or with 2 vadas is too much. Waste of so much of it. Also it wasn't really authentic south in taste...

Took additional tomato chutney. It wasn't good.

Sambar was okish.. 

South indian eateries are still very few in salt Lake area so was kinda happy to spot this one.

For a change ordered a South Indian lunch today and was pleasantly surprised. There was a Maha Thali option which seemed to be a bit too much for lunch, so ordered the Mini-Maha Thali, crazy though the name sounds. 

And even that was huge, there are chapatis, 4 vegetables, and rasam and even buttermilk and a pickle. And then a Kesari Bhaat sweet dish as a Zomato treat add on too!

Its quite enough for two people having lunch this Mini thali...incredible value for money at just Rs.130 including taxes!

I have ordered for home delivery. Packaging is very bad.
Especially mango milk shake was delivered in a dirty plastic bag and in addition with that a dirty plastic glass is provided to use where you have charged for packaging.
Are we not paying money for the food??

I have been trying dishes regularly at Madras Chandni Chowk . Also Had been to Sector 5 outlets three times. One thing I have noticed their quality is degrading day by day. There has been instances of Dosa quality and taste degraded. The chutney at times has been spoilt. On informing the staff at Sector 5 they say, on your next visit we will make a better Dosa for you. While the Chandni Chowk outlet is very rude  and refuse to  accept the feedback neither replace the food. There are now many more better South Indian restaurants than this in Kolkata. Really disappointed with the restaurant. Also the staff attitude is very bad at Chandni Chowk outlet. Once I had taken my parents there . They even outspoke with my parents when they asked for a better chutney as it seemed to be spoilt.

This was during my recent visit to Kolkata. The place was about 2.5 kms away from my place. And a bus ride was enough to reach there. 
Madras Restaurant is not so big but big enough to enjoy the evening with friends and family and sip cool beverages alongside the appetizing dosas they serve. Well if you're an idly/vada guy, they still won't disappoint you in any way. The menu is a 4 page collosal and there are 230 items to satisfy your taste buds. The staff are very well mannered and polite.
There's a big open area near the restaurant for big partying and stuff. And the environment around is very much calm and soothing.
We ordered the Mysore Masala Dosa and the Cheese Masala Dosa along with 2 glasses of sweet cold Lassi.

Have been ordering from this outlet for almost 2 months now. Have placed 10+ orders. evvrytimmettee best. I love their VADA. They give so much Sambhar. Their chutney is awesome as well. We usually order Masala Dosa, Vada, Mysore Masala Dosa and Idli. Apart from Idli, everything is perfect. Idli is like stone cold, and so hard. ALso, it is tasteless as well. Otherwise, it is a perfect restaurant.

I have only tasted the pao bhaji from this place.The bhaji here is very chunky and you can really distinguish the veggies.Not at all oily or buttery but sour and spicy which I really like,the pao they serve here are burger buns,so don't make a mistake of ordering extra pao,which I did,thinking two small pieces will not fill you up.The buns are toasted well with butter.Overall at 60 bucks​,highly recommended.

Ordered paneer pakodas from here since the weather was amazing. 
I ordered it from here through a known delivery app. Once I got the my parcel, I opened it, the paneer pakodas were huge!! 6 good big pieces of paneer pakoda. They were at least worth one meal. Anyway! The quantity, quality and size was pretty good. I give this a 3.5 rating is mainly because the taste was a little off, maybe because there was less chaat masala. Also the sauces weren't that great. Otherwise, it was good.

I ordered food from here this afternoon, Veg Chowmein and Veg Manchurian. Surprisingly the Veg Manchurian price was low, 50 Rs, with enough quantity.

The order took about 55 mins to arrive, greater than the time mentioned.

The food was average. While eating chowmein I got a chunk of ginger in my mouth, maybe it was not properly mixed. 
So, the food was not that satisfactory, it was just Ok.

But it was reasonable, the bill won't burn a hole in your pocket, I got my order for Rs 160.

I went with zero expectations and this place amazed me with the tasty South Indian food and exemplary customer service. 
Their sambhar and coconut chutney was tasty and tomato chutney was superb! 
We had Dahi Vada, Masala Dosa, Medu Vada, Idlis etc. Lovely food, fresh and clean. I even loved the location.. staff was friendly and helpful. The only disappointment was the sweet which I think was a Mysurpa. 
Great value for money!!
Edit: Quality of food has gone down drastically!!!

Would recommend people to visit if u r from south India. If u r from Karnataka then don't forget to visit.

Well, this place entered my hitlist on the very day of them putting up their name plate outside their upcoming restaurant, adjacent to McDonald’s – @ Nalban food park, Sector 5, Saltlake. And bingo! They started featuring on Zomato delivery right away from inception!

I ordered a Rava Masala dosa for office delivery – which was decently packed and delivered to my seat in just half an hour – a superb effort by Zomato. A nominal delivery as well as packing charge was levied, which is fine!

Dosa was just fine – nothing great, so was the sambhar! Noteworthy that portion served was good – and one can expect almost a full meal by having just a single dosa! What impressed me the most was the semi-cold coconut chutney, which was outstanding – greatly tempered with black mustard seeds and superb on taste.

I wish them the very best of luck for great success in an area (Sector 5) where there is severe dearth of good South Indian option!

Tried this south indian restaurant today..and they indeed are an ideal south indian restaurant with variaties of south indian dishes available...it is an open to air restaurant adjoining nalban...the staffs are south indian,knowing the menu well and adding to the south indian flavour of the restaurant in the midst of the city of joy...we tried the butter ghee rawa plain dosa @160/- and dahi vada (2 pcs) @80/- ..the rawa dosa was really crispy and it delighted my taste buds with every scathing attack launched by my teeth on it..the dahi vada was really substantial in quantity and tasted very good...we also tried the filter coffee @20/- but it tasted just okay...overall had a very satisfying lunch (2 of us) @ 260/- ..the behaviour of the staffs and their service was really really pleasant..prices i would say are moderately high, though they don't charge any extra taxes on the catalogue price..give it a try south indian lovers..would definitely recommend it..

This one at Nalban Food Park is very well located with great views of the lake. We ordered a Masala Dosa & a Onion Masala Dosa. Food was presented quite fast. They also gave a small bowl of some sort of Halwa before the Dosas came, which tasted absolutely delicious. The dosas were good as well. They have a huge variety of Dosas which I will try in further visits.

Every now and then I have this craving for good South Indian food. This was one of those mornings and we were frantically looking for South Indian food joints on Zomato. Madras Restaurant sounded promising so we walked in for a hearty breakfast. The food was being freshly prepared in the open kitchen and we were greeted by friendly smiles all around. The open seating area overlooked the beautiful Nalban lake. The food had those typical South Indian flavor elements, which I have been craving. In short, it was hot and tasty. I recommend the freshly made vada and cheese sada dosa (served with copious amounts of grated cheese). Overall, a great breakfast place with a view.
