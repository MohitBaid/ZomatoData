One of the worst places I have ever come to eat. They tried to put a dim sort of ambience but it turned out to be too dim. As for food, we had ordered drums of heaven which turned out to chicken coated in a thick batter mix and then fried and tossed in a sauce. It lacked flavour and I have to say I have had better street side fried chicken than this. The service wasn't good at all, they took nearly 45 mins to bring this one dish. The water glasses turned out to be very dirty as well. There was one waiter who was busy with her work and had to call several times just to get her attention. Never coming back to this place ever again !

One of the most disgusting cafes and claming to give them service tax!
This place is not even watch you waste your money for a single day.
Today we ordered Drums of heavens and it was the fattest layer of flour coating in the chicken with a tiny piece of chicken you will merely understand when you put it in your mouth. Indecent waitress.
The glasses to drink water are  unwashed with tiny insects in it!
After having that one wish we didn't dare to order anymore. 
Please guys do not go there  to waste your money on this disgusting restaurant and overpriced food

Visited this place with great expectations. The first thing that disappointed us was the service. We selected a couple of items from their menu only to know that almost nothing from the menu was available. Instead we were given a hand written menu written on a tissue paper, by their staff. However we selected crispy chicken and two drinks. The crispy chicken was the worst of its kind. Totally dry n chewy. The drinks had no ice and were aweful. The only thing I liked about the place was it's coziness.

Been to this place, quite a some time now. The interior, ambience and the food is really good. If you love to try out different food, then The Roasted Chicken Salad from the menu is something to lookout for! I won't say that its pocket-friendly, but a good place to hang-out with your friends. The only disappointing thing was the service staff keeps on changing every now and then.  Being such a little place, its very important to have a good hospitality. Specially for a frequent visitor like me! ;) :)

It's actually kinda nice place to hang out. Located just above the famous bawarchi restaurants behind the 8b bus stand The Nest Cafe is small joint whose highlighting point is the Rs 99/ Shisha (limited period). The place is small but cozy, ambience is sort of okay to my likings. Food is not so good but not so bad either. Yes you will not get that Gastronomical delight from eating out here but yeah certainly a fine place to just lay back puff some smoke and chill with friends.

This new cafe cum hookah bar is situated at 8B Bus stand just above the Bawarchi Restaurant. Ambiance is pretty decent and the food here is also good enough. Hookah served can be improved quality wise but since the place has opened very recently it has to be given the benefit of time. Overall a good hangout place for young people and being one of the very few places to serve hookah in the locality it should definitely be a hit!!

Went there on a sunday eve.. i found the decor a bit dimmy with contradictory loud music :P .. coming to food - we had cold coffee (nice one) , cold chocolate (okaish) and a masala cold drink  ( too bland to satisfy me)..  however the Barbequed chicken wings deserve to be praised.. 4 tangy succulent well tossed chicken wings with fair amount of flesh in it , is the reason why i rated it 3 instead of 2.5.  the other two orders were a grilled chicken sandwich and a cheese mushroom pizza served with ample mayonnaise !! The pizza base was  semi soft ( i would have preferred a thin crust one ) but i really had issues with the green chilli pieces sprinkled over the toppings .. please i never expected "Kancha lonkar tukro" on my cheese mushroom pizza !! 
well the most important part - the charges ! One relief is that the prices on the menu card is inclusive of Vat & other taxes .. But then they charge 10% service charge over the final bill. So, overall it is balanced :P 

Now two urgent requests to this food-joint authority : 
1. PLEASE TRY TO AVOID CHARGING MORE THAN THE PRINTED MRP FOR A BOTTLE OF MINERAL WATER. Trust me this is not a noble gesture as MRPs are alreday inclusive of VATs & TAXES. and you charged Rs 45 for a bottle of Rs 20 and then again u charged the 10% service charge on the final bill..  
2. AND please try not to deny atleast one glass of regular water to your consumers. 
I know its a business not a charity but these two above mentioned gestures often fail to create a positive impact on the consumers ! :)

This place is a new joint near Jadavpur 8B Bus Terminal. 
I saw this not three days ago and decided to visit this place today. 

The place is very small and the smell is weird. 
Lighting and seating was kind of ok. 

But when comes to serving and food. They are the worst I've ever seen. 

We ordered Cappuccino and Chicken Alfredo Pasta. 

Cappuccino is the worst thing I've ever had. 

Pasta never arrived we waited for 20 minutes then they said more 5
minutes 10 miutes gone still norhing we decided to leave. 
Then when I asked for bill I had to wait another few minutes. 

What a waste?! 

Worst place ever. They don't even deserve 1 raring. 5 from my side. 

Don't go to this place.

A cozy cafe with a great ambience . I had visited the place last night with a friend and ordered a raw Darjeeling tea for myself while a milk tea for my friend.  The Darjeeling tea they serve is completely tasteless, and my friend's milk tea tasted like milk instead ! When we complained of the taste, they agreed to make her tea again. However, we were charged 172 bucks for two Darjeeling teas which cost Rs 49 each ! No where on the menu was the additional charges for milk (Rs 59) included. Highly dissatisfied with the food quality here .

This is an extension of the Bawarchi restaurant located right beside the 8B Jadavpur bus stand. Basically small cozy hookah bar cum cafe. None of the food items were available in the menu except grilled chicken and that also during the weekend. Staffs are not at all confident about the availability of the food items. The staff has to get the chef to my table availability of grilled chicken too.. Ordered kit kat shake and grilled chicken served with rice, veggies, smashed potatoes for take away. Taste was okish.  Rates are reasonable.

To start off with, this joint is more appropriate for the hookah smoking crowd with Punjabi songs playing throughout. It was a bit uncomfortable for us as we visited with kids and the ambience looked more like that of a bar than a continental cafe.
Since my wife had beebn wanting to have Fish N Chips over the last couple of days, we planned to try this joint as their Fish N Chips looked promising (referance Zomato pics & user reviews). However, being very particular about the fish provided, I decided to call up the reataurant to enquire about the same and was promptly informed that they serve Bekti. One can imagine our surprise and disappointment on being served Fish N Chips prepared with Basa. On bringing up this point to the owner, who had given us the information over the phone, we were even more surprised to know that he wasn't even aware of what fish was being used in his kitchen. How much more ridiculous can it get!!!!
Coming to the other dishes we ordered, viz 2 Chicken Fajita Sizzlers and a Chicken Steak Sizzler, both of them were disappointing. The Steak was nothing as compared to Peter Cat or Mocambo - i know the comparison doesn't make any sense, but they are charging almost what these 2 legendary restaurants charge. So, one wud expect a better dish than what was served. The Chicken Fajita Sizzler tasted more like Schezwan Chicken on a Sizzling Plate. The chicken pieces were big chunks as we see being used in Indian kebab preparations.

Overall a very disappointing experience.

This is the first time I'm feeling cheated by zomato ratings. Here is my sad tale of truth. In this unusual cash crunch situation felt like having some continental food so park street was ruled out , found this on zomato after a little speculation called the place to know if they serve bhetki fish fries. The owner confirmed they serve bhetki so headed for some fish n chips and some swanky sizzler names they have on the menu. Oh to add we asked if there's any tax so he said a ten percent service charge is levied however they sometimes waive that off. Wishful thinking we headed to the place. The ambience was sleazy playing loud Hindi Punjabi remix numbers with dim coloured lights and overpowering smell of Sheesha. Total turn off for a family dinner. Nobody cared for us for the first 15 minutes. When at last the server arrived he clearly had no idea or difference between a fajita to a steak sizzler. I was getting super fused. Ordered two fajita sizzlers a steak sizzler and a fish n chips. We asked for water and the server got us only one glass for my son. Overlooking this waited to satisfy my bud atleast. There came two fried fish with masala French fries mayo and ketchup. First bite. .BASA!!! Why on earth such a misleading information if I'm paying for something I have the right to know what I'm being served. Called the server and complained. I said the fried fish is basa when I called I was informed about bhetki. He corrected me that what I had was fish n chips and they serve Basa for that..I said  that I know I ordered fish n chips and the fried fish in that is Basa.Phew!!! The owner came after some time and apologized that he was not aware they're serving basa he knew it was bhetki. Is there anything more lame than this. I totally avoided as it was getting painstaking. Then voila the sizzlers arrived. I was not expecting Chili's standard of fajitas but definitely fajitas in a fajita sizzler. Well it was herb rice mashed potatoes and a close cousin of schezwan chicken only difference would be it was spiked with salsa sauce n not schezwan pepper. Now it was too difficult to remain composed. The owner was least bothered chatting away with a bunch of friends as if it was his private adda den. Excellent negligence on customer service and business orientation. Last but not the least the steak sizzler arrived. Again loaded with bell peppers overpowering smell of rosemary flavoured rice and a nearly mutilated boneless chicken representing the steak. I curse myself for not having my house special steak at Peter Cat or a fajita Sizzler at Chilis or maybe good old fish n chips.  I double dare u to try continental stuff here I don't know about Chinese or other preparations here. Misguided and lost. There came the bill with 10 percent service charge.Rock bottom customer service. Not even a Good Night at exit we opened the door and left the server busy with himself . Great going guys ,I would not recommend this place to anyone from moon n back! !! DISGUSTING ...with

Went with friends to grab a sandwich with a quick cup of coffee. Got to know that Sandwiches are not available due to Durga Puja and we have to choose from the custom menu. Ended up ordering drums of heaven, crispy fried chicken, tikka kebab and rashmi kebab, along with coffee. The coffee was actually good, so was the drums of heaven. The crispy chicken was very dry. The kebabs were okay, could have been softer. The service was surprisingly prompt. The music was sometimes a bit loud but on requesting the staffs turned it down. Overall fine place for quick bites.

Located above the Bawarchi near 8B busstand in Jadavpur. The first thing I did not like about the place was the interior with shabby lighting and clumsy decoration. Then came the menu- a cafe menu without Sandwich or Burgers, yes you heard it right. They have pasta and seafood items but the menu lack range severely. Ordered tea, which was taken out from vending machine in front of our eyes and served! Obviously it lacked uniqueness and tasted pathetically generic. The only saving grace was Fish & Chips which was decent but then we had to wait 35-40 minutes for that!!! Not worth my money and time.

It is a small and nicely decorated cafe, situated at the 2nd floor of Bawarchi restaurant at Jadavpur. I went there with my friends. The ambience was nice but the music was loud. There was provision having hookah too. We ordered  veg alfredo pasta and cranberry juice. But unfortunately they were unable to cater fruit juice so we ordered cappuccino instead of cranberry juice.  Tastewise the cappuccino was okay. The taste of pasta was good. The quantity of pasta they served was quite sufficient. The place is pocket friendly. The staffs are well behaved. If you want to hang out with your friends and want to have an adda then you can visit the place but if you are in search of a place which is peaceful and filled with soft mellowy melodies then you may feel disappointed.

Little pretty cafe, located on the 2nd floor of Bawarchi restro building at Jadavpur 8b bus stand. We had ordered for cappuccino but unfortunately that tastes shit. I believe it was an exception. The appetisers were okay type. The only reason, I gave it 3.5 out 5 because of the cute and nice interior and beautiful illumination which create a very decent ambience to gossip with pals and take sip of hot cuppa. The waiters are quite courteous. N.B. They also serve hookah.

Although I'd prefer a cushion in a hookah bar but the seating arrangements were quite spacious and comfy. Value for money and reasonably priced menu. We ordered pasta, a brain freezer and virgin mohito (that was a bit off the taste but good). Overall experience....very good. Small place but a good one. Definitely gonna get more popular. Do visit.

The water to coffee/chocolate ratio felt 90:10. We ordered chicken barbeque wings along with it, which tasted 'OK'. Only the price felt cheap but the quality of the beverages needs a great push up.

The ambience was good.But the Darjeeling tea that they served was horrible,too much of amulya in it and no essence of the tea.The waiters were frequently switching off the ac even when more than 3 tables were occupied,don't know why.

A new cafe at jadavpur 8b. It is at the same building of bawarchi family restaurant. Not many people are aware of this place. When we went there the cafe was empty, only we were the only customers. AC was not properly working but after 10-15mins they managed to fix it. We ordered chicken Alfredo and chicken wings which were nice. Also the virgin mojito is really refreshing. Overall services are good.

A small place but very attractively designed. Hookahs are attractively priced. Awesome ice tea as well. Orange juice wasn't available that day. Lovely staff as well.

Very calm and peaceful place to be. Very cosy sitting arrangement. And the Hookah to which I am hooked is excellent. The gentleman who makes the hookah is very experienced and does justice to it. Will definitely come back soon.

Not too good. Not too bad! The food is okayish. The drink Blue Lagoon is a must try. Roasted Chicken Salad was not that great as I expected. And crispy chicken was good. All in all it was an average experience.

The new cafe in Jadavpur was a pretty little place, with a concise yet interesting menu. They serve hookahs too. Had their Oreo Shake which was good, and the tea was nice too. The seating area is relaxed and comfortable. Will go back to try out their food soon.

All new compact cafe for a perfect hang out destination. The nest cafe is very easy locate too.

**Location**
It is situated at the same building of the bawarchi restaurant just at the back of the 8B bus stand Jadavpur.

**Ambiance**
A perfect ambiance for hang out with friends. It is really a cozy place which suits for a date as well. Wooden interiors with beautiful lamp shades were setting up just the right kind of ambiance as well. Kudos to the owner for the designing.

**Products**
Tried some drinks and tea from here.

1. Virgin Mojito:
Very nicely presented with great fizz added to it. The pudina and lemon mixture to the drink was just perfect .. Lovely.

2. Oreo choco Shake:
A thick rich creamy chocolate shake with oreo added to its presentation as well made it look real good.

3. Assam tea:
The tea was refreshing as my friend said and the flavor was very strong which was just apt for it.

**Service**
The staffs are well trained and courteous.
Liked their service and behavior.
A good one.

This newly opened cafe is located overlooking the 8B bus stand on the same building as bawarchi in Jadavpur. Even in it's small size the outlet has a variety of choices on hookahs, mocktails, tea, coffee (cold as well) and delicious menu comprising of Indian, Italian and continental cuisines. I have tried fish n chips which is good and grilled chicken, which is amazing. Hookahs are superb along with cold coffee. Ambience is of a typical cafe with the staff always trying hard to make your experience pleasant. This place is surely gonna be one of the hotspots of the location in time.

This cafe has recently opened at Jadavpur. I decided to visit this cafe yesterday. I found the deco nice and comfy. Only the music was too loud for my taste. As it is a new cafe I decided to order beverages at first. We ordered Darjeeling tea and cold coffee. As we were going through the menu we felt that some of the items were overpriced. The tea was sort of warm not as hot as it should be and it tasted bland, devoid of any flavour whatsoever. The cold coffee was also slightly tasteless. It consisted more water than coffee or milk. By then we decided against ordering any food and asked for the bill. When they asked we told them our opinion. They told us that it was a frappe rather that a cold coffee though why they served frappe although we ordered cold coffee specifically is beyond me. They accepted our review at last. I would probably visit it again to try out their food.

The cafe is located above bawarchi is an absolute deight . The ambience and the decor of the cafe is impeccable added with the wide varieties of hookah flavour , Free wifi and various soft beverage could turn any occasion a lovely time . The food ,especially the grilled chicken was absolutely delicious ,one of the best chicken dishes which i ever had . I would be returning to the cafe more oftenly.

Located at the heart of 8b crossing,on the bawarchi building 2nd floor,this new joint opened up around 3 days back can well and truely address the needs of the place to chill for the new gen of this locality considering the huge number of student footfall it has.Its a comfy cafe with some nice decor, the ambiance is pretty neat to be true, wood work done nicely,the staff are really nice and helpful with their advice,which is always a plus for a place.Coming to the FNB,well not all items are available as they've just opened up but will be done by end of this week as per the staff. We went for Virjin Mohjito,Strawberry Shake ,Oreo Shake and Iced tea and must say all were really good and enjoyed the drinks.Must try are all the mocktails and shakes suggested here
Coming to the food I would recommend Barbeque chicken wings for the ones who like it spicy,for the less spicy ones try Grilled chicken or Fish which is real good. In the salad section one can go for roasted chicken salad which I would to be really nice.Also Shisha/Hookah was really good ,did'nt choke at all,you have a lot of variety in terms of flavour and base,also they are coming out with bottled hookah which will be a bigtime HIT for sure.Lastly why I recommend this place highly because alongside the quality and quantity being good the pricing is extremely pocket friendly considering all prices mentioned are inclusive of taxes.Entire bill for a 1Virjin Mohjito,3 Iced Tea, 1 Strawberry shake, 1 Oreo shake, 1 barbeque chicken wing, 1 roasted chicken salad, 1 hookah single flavour along with ice base came upto 1072 INR inclusive all
