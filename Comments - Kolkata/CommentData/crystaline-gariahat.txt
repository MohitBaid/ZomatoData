Not at all happy with what they do and serve!

This Pujas, they decided to serve rotten chilli chicken which came with a complimentary rude behavior when complained. It was switched with rotten chilli chicken again! For pujas, lower quality of food and service is acceptable but not rotten foods and a waste of money!

4 years back in the pujas when I came here, we were 2, didn't get a table for 2 even though it was empty. There was another person sitting opposite to us! It was uncomfortable and we walked out immediately! 

THERE'S A REASON WHY THIS PLACE STAYS EMPTY IN PUJAS DESPITE BEING SO CLOSE TO RENOWNED PANDALS.

We visited this place as we thought elit would be impossible to find seat in any restaurants around Gariahat on Maha panchami. The fod was aveage. Portion really good. Price.. damn cheap. For rs 420 four of us had wholesome lunch of veg fried rice, veg noodle and swet and sour garlic chicken.

I don't know why zomato is showing "Cost for two : 650 approx " for this place. Everything is very average here -- the food, ambiance and all.So, for me there are many more places at Gariahat to get better food in this price.Located near Ekdalia evergreen puja pandal. Ordered egg chowmein and Sweet sour chicken here. The quantity of chowmein was enough for two people. But the Sweet sour chicken was not fresh, a bit smelly too. I can give them a positive comment only for the quantity.

Location: near Gariahat, near Ekdalia Evergreen pujo Pandal. After hectic shopping in Gariahat when we wanted to eat something and rest our tired feet we decided to go here.....a Big mistake.....
Food: Egg Hakka noodles.....was like roadside ones. The side dish of Manchurian too was awful in taste.
The food was too oily. 
Ambience: nothing much to speak of, not at all a pleasant place.

This place is situated on the left side of the lane which heads towards the famous Ekdalia puja. This place has roll centre in the ground floor and restaurant in the first floor.
I used to visit this place during my school days that is 2011 or 2012. We used to have chicken manuchurian or chilli chicken and chicken noodles. Sometimes we had crispy baby corn. The foods were really tasty that time. We used to visit quite often a month.
During 2013 i visited this place once during the puja. One of my friend ordered mixed singapore hakka chowmin. What we got was Chicken Szechwan Hakka chowmin. When we first told them that it seems there are only chicken and nothing else to call it a mixed chowmin, they told us that they don't have anything else other than chicken. They didnt even bother to inform the unavailability of mixed chowmin. Next when we discovered that it was not singapore chowmin we again complain and this time they told us that they mistakenly served the dish but refused to replace the dish. It was very dissapointing. We didn't even complete our food and left. During payment we saw that we were charged for mixed singapore chowmin. Upon asking they fix the bill for chicken chowmin. We had to pay the total bill because they would not discard the dish which they served outside the order.
Coming back to 2017. I visited the place after a long time recently at 8:30pm. We ordered Red Crispy Babycorn, Drums of Heaven, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Fish in Manchurian with Brown Sauce and Chicken Fried Rice. The starters were tasty and good in amount. Coming to the main course i guess they don't know what sweet and sour means. The chicken dish tasted extremely pale and tasteless. The fish dish was spicy beyond imagination. I guessed this time also they mistakenly served chilli fish. So we asked them what did they serve. Unfortunately that was the correct dish but definately it didn't taste like manchurian. It is not a nice place for good food. I wouldn't be coming back nor would i suggest anyone unless you don't have any other option.

Food- Chicken sweet corn soup; enough for four people which had a lot of chicken.
Dry Chilli Chicken- Moderately spicy and good to taste.
Mixed Gravy Chowmin- A bit blunt in taste but the contents were in good amount
^We found out a dead cockroach in the soy sauce,after we complained they changed the food as well as the container and didn't argued.
It's a AC restrauant but hygiene wise is not that good.Food was average.

Worst chinese food ever. Ordered for chicken hot and sour soup. Mixed chowmean and chicken hot garlic. None of dishes tasted good. The soup was cold with no chicken in it. The mixed chowmean that a road side vendor makes will taste better than what was served. And last but not the least the garlic chicken had raw garlic and not smelled but stinked. Yuk guys pls be alert.

I visited it twice, initially with my colleague and subsequently with my aunt and her friend during Durga Puja. The first time, we had ordered fried rice and chilli chicken. The rice was salty....seemed they had added more salt than was required. On the second occasion, we opted for Manchurian Chicken which tasted widely different...much spicier and darker in colour compared to what was usually served at other Chinese cuisine restaurants. When we pointed this out to the waiter, he had the gall to state that this is how it is at their eatery. I didn‚Äôt bother to go there any more!!

Came here with my friend to take parcel for my family and while waiting I ordered a plate of crispy fish on the staff's request. This particular appetiser is unique and well prepared, I must say. Coming to the food which I took home, schezwan chicken and fried rice both were moderate in taste, though it seemed the chicken wasn't of good quality and was hard . Decor is minimal. Mainly a family restaurant located in the heart of gariahat. üòä

A great place to eat rolls, I frequent this shop often as it's very close to where I live. Situated in Ekdalia they serve rolls which I believe are pretty darn good. 

I've ordered many rolls here but my favourite is the egg reshmi kebab roll. It's succulent, juicy, tender and mouth watering. The rolls are a little expensive when compared to other shops but the service is quick and well, it's really closeby for me!

The rolls are alright,nothing different from most roll shops. I had just gone once to the restaurant. Had ordered egg chicken chowmein from here.

"Crystaline" the shop is located near Ekdalia the opposite of NOKIA CUSTOMER CARE in Ekdalia. 
The price is moderate and the quantity they serve is much much more than most of the restaurants. But the place where they lag is quality. The quality of food they served was not that good, I didn't liked it much. The place is too small and you may find it dark and untidy cause of less space and less lights. Otherwise the shop is good with good staffs.

A standard Chinese joint located at Ekdalia. This is a pure case of "looks can be deceptive". 
The ac restaurant might have a shabby appearance but the food absolutely compensates for the not so good interiors.

Today, I was at Gariahat and was craving for good Chinese at a budget joint. And here we are, Crystaline is the perfect option. 
Frankly speaking, the initial impression that I got was not pleasant, but after I ate the food my opinions took a 180¬∞ turn. 

We ordered :
‚Ä¢ Red crispy potato - the quantity was very good. And the item tasted amazing. Basically it was French fries with a coating of cornflour. And the colour was orange-ish. But I was very happy with this dish. 100 bucks ey daarun pet pujo! :D 
And surprisingly it had strips of carrots which actually went well with the potatoes. 
‚Ä¢ Egg Fried rice - Full marks for this dish. The portion was toooo much, so much so, that mom and I, literally had to stuff ourselves in the end. Plenty of veggies with a generous amount of egg, this dish will be a winner for every Chinese cuisine lover.
‚Ä¢ Chicken Manchurian in Brown sauce - yes, they also have a variant in white sauce which interested me a lot. I'm surely coming back simply for trying out that particular dish. Now, we had ordered half plate so we were served with 4 big boneless pieces of chicken. Tasted perfect. 

Pocket pinch - this place is dirt cheap. Like really! I was full to the core and the bill for the two of us was only 365 bucks. Haha! Today was a 'food' day! :P

A gem of a place which had remained undiscovered by me. So thankful to Zomato. Coming back again. :D

Crystalline, located near the busy Gariahat, offers affordable Chinese, Thai and Tibetan cuisines. Small in area but neatly decorated. But two things to complain about, the side fans didn't have any covers and there's an old small TV but it was directed outside for the staffs to see. Coming to food, quality not that high but descent, tastes good. We ordered Thai Crispy Chicken and Thai Chicken Gravy Chowmein. Well, frankly, couldn't find anything "Thai" about it, except for large amount of vegetables in the chowmein. But I loved those crispy chicken strips. Nevertheless, good food, low cost perfect for satiate evening hunger. A rating of not more than 7 out of 10 for this eatery.

Whenever I went there I couldn't stop myself from ordering drums of heaven.. It tastes fabulous.. It contained 8 pieces and price is also pocket friendly.. ¬†otherwise fried rice noodle chilli chicken mandarin chicken everything I tried was good i taste..¬†
But now a days the taste becomes just good, not like before.

I have only had rolls from this place and they taste quite good.  This shop is usually quite crowded and people seem to enjoy the rolls.
I have had egg and chicken rolls from this place on several occasions.
The paratha is flaky and crisp. I love their egg rolls which tastes good and one doesnot feel heavy after eating them. They still give a filling of masala aloo in their rolls.
The chicken roll tastes decent with good amount of chicken fillings. Nothing spectacular.
This shop is a choice for most of the passerbys and shopoholics of gariahat to grab a quick roll on their way.

Please note this review is only for the roll counter which is by far the most visited place here. 
And for good reason. They make them with proper care and respectfully ask whatever you'd like to add in what amounts. 
The quality of chicken has remained constant over the years, 
But then so has the overall quality of rolls. The paratha is made well, without using excessive oil. 
Perhaps a bit more expensive than other roll joints, but the quality surely makes up for the price.

I visited this place so many times
It looks very average.. nothing special in decoration..
Whenever I went there I couldn't stop myself from ordering drums of heaven.. It tastes fabulous.. It contained 8 pieces and price is also pocket friendly.. ¬†otherwise fried rice noodle chilli chicken mandarin chicken everything I tried was good i taste..¬†
But now a days the taste becomes just good, not like before.

¬†They have both the full and half options of almost every item.. Service is also good..

I have only had rolls from this place and they taste quite good.  This shop is usually quite crowded and people seem to enjoy the rolls.
I have had egg and chicken rolls from this place on several occasions.
The paratha is flaky and crisp. I love their egg rolls which tastes good and one doesnot feel heavy after eating them. They still give a filling of masala aloo in their rolls.
The chicken roll tastes decent with good amount of chicken fillings. Nothing spectacular.
This shop is a choice for most of the passerbys and shopoholics of gariahat to grab a quick roll on their way.

Please note this review is only for the roll counter which is by far the most visited place here. 
And for good reason. They make them with proper care and respectfully ask whatever you'd like to add in what amounts. 
The quality of chicken has remained constant over the years, 
But then so has the overall quality of rolls. The paratha is made well, without using excessive oil. 
Perhaps a bit more expensive than other roll joints, but the quality surely makes up for the price.

I haven't visited the seating area of this restaurant but I have bought food from the take out counter which mostly has rolls and kebab. I'd say crystalline is most famous in Gariahat for its exceptional rolls. I am a huge fan of the fish tandoori kebab roll. Made with fresh bhetki and seasoned perfectly, the pieces are succulent and melts in your mouth creating a burst of flavours that come from the mix of cut up chillis, lemon and spices! Reasonably priced, if you want a quick snack then definitely try out their fish tandoori roll or any other roll for that matter!

Want to eat something yummy sitting in an ac restaurant without burning a hole in your pocket?? yes, crystaline promises that. Just beside the ekdalia ccd , it has both take away and dine-in options. I did both.  The rolls are delicious i like the double egg roll. Their chinese cuisine is really good both quality and quantity wise.
My suggestion would be to try the american chopseuy here :)

10 years ago when I first checked out Crystalline, it was the most happening restaurants in that particular area of Gariahat. Wonderful decor with a lovely mirror work on a pillar, good working ac, caring staff, fabulous food. Especially I loved red chilly with capsicum chicken. The dish used to be red, and the taste equally fiery red. Countless times I ate it and parcelled it home when we were in Gariahat.
Yesterday I went there with my mother. Downstairs they have compromised by setting up a roll joint which jammed the main entrance. As we went upstairs, we felt the lack of maintenance. No wall painting has been done recently giving it a shabby look. It was more apparent when we took our seats. The upholstery needed cleaning and renovation, the wall painting I have already mentioned. Only the mirror work on the pillar reminded me how gorgeous it used to look at  one time.
The staff were lolling in their chairs. They couldn't care that patrons are coming up so as to open the door. I had to hold the door open for my mother. 
It is not that there is scarcity of customers. It is that they are either untrained or underpaid, or both.
Now for the food. The Maitre de table approached us. I naturally asked for the red chilly with capsicum chicken and he suggested Thai Hakka mixed chow mein. After ten minutes, food arrived. I was disappointed with the chicken dish. It was not as it used to be. It lacked the red look, it lacked the fiery taste. In fact it tasted sweet to my tongue! On enquiry the Maitre de Table told me that they have reduced the quantity of hot from this dish and would have added hot had I so ordered. Well, I don't know about that. But the fact remains that the dish has lost its original features. Also, the chicken was chewy to taste, and lacked juiciness.
But the Thai chow mein was certainly good to taste and the quantity was huge, so that we had to parcel it home.
The price is however cheap, maybe the reason why they cannot renovate the joint. Ac was also working properly.
On our way back, the Maitre de table opened the door for us (at last!).

One minute walk from my house, Crystalline is one place we can always depend upon be it for ordering food home or eating there upstairs or grabbing a quick bite from the fast food section downstairs. Its primarily a roll shop and the restaurant is at the first floor which specialise in Chinese delicacies.They specialize in all kinds of rolls, fish fry, fingers, kebabs etc. Easy on the pocket, Crystalline serves fresh and tasty food right from afternoon till night. Must try if you are in Gariahat.

My experience at this place was not a satisfying one. Since i and my friend were near gariahat and were low on our budget, we decided to have our lunch here. 

Crystalline is located on the road that connects Gariahat Flyover with Ekdalia Evergreen club. The ambience is pretty ordinary. The menu on the other hand is quite diverse. 

We ordered for :
1. Drums of heaven: The taste was good but not the quality. The lollipops had a less portions of chicken and was covered by a thick layer of flour such that it seemed large in size. Inspite of this the taste was good since the tangy sauce in which it was made was just perfect- the way i like.

2. Mixed singapore noodles- The noodles  was not at all tasty. The quantity was enough for two and also there were ample amounts of chicken, egg, etc.

3. Chilli chicken dry- The chicken was fried to such an extent that it had become hard. Though the taste was good but the hardness spoiled it. 

I still regret coming here. Wont visit again and wont recommend anyone either !!

This restaurant was discovered by my mother 5-6 years ago and since then we ordered Chinese food from here numerous time as this place is nearby to our home. I am basically fond of their food specially the starters.. I do think they serve best of Chinese starters in the town.. Dry chilli chicken, chicken lollypop, chilli garlic pepper chicken, Thai crispy chicken/fish whatever you order all are equally awesome in taste.. Their mixed Hakka noodles or rice are also good.. But their ambience is not at all good, that's why I prefer take away..

Crystaline is one of those budget Chinese restaurants that provides average kind of food with somewhat okay quantity. Crystaline is located near Ekdalia crossing, it is a very small restaurant which can barely fit in any people. Though the restaurant is not very old, still looks quite crappy from both outside and inside.

The food is quite unimpressive, I don't recommend the Hakka Noodles as it is very oily and oil was literally dripping from it, one word - too bad for your health. Fried Rice is still fine, at least not oily. Thai Crispy Chicken is nowhere 'Thai' and I guess they don't know what 'Thai' food is like. Red Crispy Baby Corn is not crispy, not spicy and only looks red. Sweet 'n' Sour Chicken is good and can be tried out.

Quantity is neither too good, not too bad. I mean quantity for starters is very less but they make up in the Main Course section. Thai Crispy Chicken barely had like 8-9 pieces. Sweet 'n' Sour Chicken had perfectly sized Chicken pieces (neither too big, nor too small)

Prices are quite cheap, barely anyone would mind paying this much. Two starters, one gravy, one noodles and one fried rice cost us exactly Rs. 600 and is enough for 3 people at least.

Home delivery service is good, they have very good knowledge of the nearby areas and even far areas. They delivered to my address without making any calls to ask location (this rarely happens to me). The food was delivered within 1hr 15mins, but was cold enough to be enjoyed. Their packing is not good, boxes got crushed and sauces started spilling out of the plastic sachets. Since the boxes were not properly packed, there were openings in those and the food got cold. The gravy luckily didn't leak.

Ambiance of the restaurant is really bad and it's not worth to pay this place a visit and rather call for a home delivery. I don't know how did they came up with the idea of making a restaurant in such a small area.

So, in the end Crystaline won't be a much recommended restaurant from my side but yes, in case you don't mind the taste and want to save few bucks, then this might be alright.

Update 27/11/2014: Tried out their food today and can only say that they are improving quite good. The Garlic Chicken in White Sauce was a bang! Red Spring Paneer was also very good and wish they gave more than 7-8 pieces and the Chicken Pepper Salt was also worth praise. The delivery this time was made in about 45 minutes, much faster than earlier but packing was before (crushed boxes). Because of all the above factors, I would re-rate this restaurant.

If you are a chinese food lover with low price you can go for this. First of all do not expect it too be great restaurant since ambience is below average. Price is lesser or same as of the chinese fast food corners but Quantity and quality is much better than them and many big restaurants. So i recommend this.

U may visit if u happen to hav a rumbling tummy while in the area...and long for tasty food at a sweeeet price.

Well, this is a very average kind of a restaurant, though I find it more towards the negative side. The prices are more than they should have been, considering the quality of food they serve. Being close to my school I have had food here at a few occasions. The interiors are bland and smelly, the food is pretty average, though the quantity won't disappoint you. The USP of this restaurant is its location and I believe this is the sole reason its still active. You can give this place a visit for a very ordinary meal but I would definitely recommend to abstain from here.

This is the place where huge quantity of chinese food is served at very low price, though taste wise not that good but when you are hungry and low on budget then it can be an option. I opted for home delivery and the delivery was quick, i ordered thai fried rice, hong kong fried rice with kongfu chicken and lemon chicken, both half plates which consists of 5 pieces of chicken..lemon chicken was very ordinary but kongfu chicken was too good, both fried rices were decent, nothing special.. it is good for a quick low cost eating out, not for fine dining..

I first visited the restaurant four years back.Since then I have visited the place several times.The place does not have an impressive ambience.
But the food is undoubtedly mouth watering.I have tried Chilly Garlic Fried Rice,Thai Fish, and different varieties of Prawn dishes.All of them were prepared with perfection.
The prices were surprisingly low for a restaurant located in Gaiahat main road and serving high quality food.
But they seriously need to improve on the service.Service is too slow.One has to wait for a very a long time for the food to be served.

This is a neighbourhood Chinese joint where you should go in only if you are pretty hungry and low on cash. It's near the Ekdalia Evergreen Pujo pandal, and just across the road from the Cakes shop.

The food here is not too tasty, and I found it too oily for my taste. Almost everything was nearly soaked in oil. I am not a very diet-conscious person. Neither do I not gorge on yummy oily Mughlai food. But here it was too overbearing, and more over, the taste was bland. I am pretty sure that the chefs here can do greater justice if they can just cut down and control the oil content. It would actually lead to lesser expenses for them, too!

Apart from that, service or ambience are not special.

As I said before, unless I am desperately hungry with low cash, I am not going there. But then again, if I am desperately hungry with low cash, any one would just want to satiate the hunger and not go for a gourmet meal.

Verdict: The only good thing is that they serve enormous quantities, but then again, with everything floating in oil.

Well Crystaline serves really tasty chinese dishes at reasonable prices.I generally prefer their chinese dishes. This outlet is located opposite of the Nokia mobile shop at Ekdalia. 
Momos and chicken Pepper Salt were very tasty. There is a sitting arrangement on the first floor and they home deliver. Their rolls are also not bad,,pretty well done.
The Gravy noodles and Sweet Sour Garlic chicken tastes really well.
Staff are polite and ambience is not that good.

Pretty impressive place if you are looking for a reasonable Chinese meal. This one is located in Ekdalia, opposite cakes. The ambience isn't that great but not that bad too. But I suggest if you live nearby and your bill amount is above Rs 400 you can go for home delivery. 
The quantity is seriously overwhelming and there is an option of taking half plate or full plate. 1 full plate is enough for 2 people I would say. There steamed momo is very nice and so is there crispy fried babycorn. Out of the chicken dishes you may try Thai, Kongfu or Shanghai chicken, they are very nicely prepared. The prices are quite low and very reasonable. 
Off late they have started serving Indian food too, you may try it. The staff are very cordial and always ready with their suggestions. 
Overall I was satisfied with my meal and I rate it 3.5.

This place is located right opposite to Cakes in Ekdalia. There is a roll joint downstairs and you need to take a narrow flight of stairs to reach and restaurant. It is a small place with about eight to ten tables. The dine in area is not very well furnished. However it is clean and most of the times empty. 
The menu they offer has a range of options. And you might require some help to choose. The staff are pretty helpful and are ready with suggestions! You can try Hong kong fried rice which is a little spicy, or Chilli garlic fried rice which is less spicy but tasty. Similar options with noodles as well. Try avoiding the Fish, sine at times it tastes funny! Stay safe with Chicken. You can try their Kongfu chicken, or Thai chicken etc! I personally am very fond of Kong fu chicken! 
The Quality of the food is pretty commendable. And in spite of the elaborate menu, all their dishes do not taste the same.
Their quantity of food is extremely good. So i suggest you begin with one plate split into two, or two plates split into three to avoid wastage!
And since this place is not buzzing with too many people you can take your time and finish your meal. However i would like to point out again, that the dine in area is not very impressive. 
Still if you happen to be around and hungry do drop in! Have fun! :)
