We had placed a quick dinner order via Zomato. The staff was well behaved and advice us well on what should we order. 

We had ordered butter naan, lachchha paratha, chicken bharta and achari paneer. Quantity was wholesome and so was the quality. The packaging could've been lot better though. The naan breads turned hard because of how poorly they were wrapped in the foil.

Does what it knows best. Decent quality food with good taste at a reasonable price point.

This is their flagship outlet ( the other one being beat city centre). Have ordered quite a number of times via zomato online ordering. Mostly biryani and a side dish.
The oil is a bit on the higher side in all their items.
The advantage is the low minimum order amount requirement.
Give it a shot when short of funds.

Nothing fancy to be honest.

Well another option which was completely experimental was this joint. 
Tried out there late night delivery, which failed to a great extent. The delivery personal came around 1 hour late.  So the delivery definetly needs a brush up here. 
Apart from this perk the food was good. 
We tried out Butter naan, garlic fish amd three pepper chicken and jeera rice. 
The dishes were good.
The quantity was also good. 
The quality can just improve a little when it cones the chicken and the fish dishes. 
I wasnt much disappointed running down with zero expectations.
Well i can ask individuals to try this out.

Been taking home delivery from here for the last few days. Apt service. Very courteous behavior whenever I called them.
Chicken bharta was amazing. I loved how they shredded the chicken but it didn't melt away in the curry. The lachha paratha is worth a try too.
Very pocket friendly.

Ordered food from this place few days back, the taste was pathetic, definitely not at all what I can get for Rs 115. Not at all happy with the quality and taste. I ordered fried rice which I didn't get eventually. Half of the rice was made with Schezwan sauce , and few portion of the rice was just plane white rice. Definitely won't be ordering food from here anymore. Please take care of the food taste and quality.

Ordered food on Saptami. The food got delivered after 2hours. However food was good. We ordered garlic nun, butter nun with chicken methi malai and chow mein. I feel the Indian preparation was better than the Chinese one. Pocket pinch was 283 bucks with 10% discount offered by zomato. Apart from the delivery time which can be forgiven due to Puja, my experience was good.

Being biased by the good reviews of this resturant, I tried their several items. Through foodpanda I have ordered "Chicken Steamed Momo", "Chicken Liver Fry", "Mutton Rogan Josh" and "Peas Pulao". Momo tasted really good. This goodness is rare at this price range. However, they dont serve any soup along with the momo, which I actually like. Being a starter item, the liver fry is not really a fried item, its basically a gravy item which can easily be used as an alternative main course. The pulao and mutton tasted average to me. The taste is very similiar to other budget resturants. The mutton was too much oily though. Overall, the experience was average. This is a pocket-friendly resturant and they justify the price very well.
