Is there any negative marking?? Then I will definitely put it for them. Worst experience ever. Visited here at 25th of December...and had terrible foods. The chickens given in mexican sizzler was hard like hell.. yes I mean it. We couldn't find any prawn in mixed rice and the chicken gravy tastes pathetic. Will recommend to no one :(

One of the go to place to order dinner online. We always order a prawn speciality called Prawn Malai Curry which we love, and one of the chicken imdian preparation or a veg preparation. Today to get a chance of taste, we opt for Fish Amritsari and again Prawn Malai Curry. Prawn Malai is one of our favorite, so no complain there, but Fish Amritsari was a disappointment! Never will be ordering this item. It was just tasteless, and whatever fish they used was of terrible quality.

The place is situated a few minutes away from 8b bus stand,  jadavpur.  Still they have completely failed to take the advantage of such prime location. We had ordered Schezwan fried rice,  sanghai chicken and chicken lollypop.  Chicken pieces were small,  shrunken, cold in both the dishes. Also,  rice was an absolute disappointment. Staffs often sit at the dinner table and chitchat.  They don't at all know the courtesy to be maintained in a restaurant.  Try to avoid the place

Its a real under rated restaurant.  This place is located at Jadavpur just beside The Golden Gate restaurant. I have been(or ordered) here several times.  Tried quite a few things from there menu.  
1.From there Chinese section-  Mixed fried rice was really good.  All of my friends said the same and loved it.  Schzewan Chicken was good too.  But more of all loved all their Main course pork and lamb items.  Specially the Lamb is worth mentioning.  Each time i ordered lamb from here it never has disappointed me.  The lamb is always so juicy and tasty.  But yes lil extra spicy. 
2. From Indian Cuisine my favorites are Paneer Methi Malai and Dal Dalbari.  The rich n creamy taste of the paneer will make you fall in love with, for sure.  Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was good too but a lil extra sweet.  Rotis and Naans r good n soft.
There is nothing that special about there interior or their service.  But the food is really good and thankfully available through Swiggy

I visited this place when it was Chopstix, but it was my first time here, again on a treat(lucky me). I will confess that the below par rating in Zomato made me skeptic of this choice, but after dinner I am impressed. The ambiance is similar to that of Bawarchi (since they both have the same owner) and I am fine with this. Coming to the food, we had
Veg Fried Rice - This was your typical veg fried rice, full of veggies, tasty and the rice was well cooked. The quantity was pretty good too, as 1 plate is sufficient for 2, unless you can hog. Though I still prefer the same from Hatari, but having said that, this won't disappoint. 
Veg Hakka Noodles - Again, your typical hakka noodles, well cooked, tasty and full of veggies. Nothing extraordinary but it's good and filling too. 
Fish Mandraine - Definitely the (joint) STAR of the show. This was well cooked, soft, super tasty and very light. The fish was cut into around 8 rectangle pieces and draped in soy sauce with other veggies. I apologize for not doing justice to the dish, but this was good. 
Chicken Manchurian - This was good too!! The joint STAR of the show. This was very good too. 
My overall experience was great!! I was pleasantly surprised by their good quality and will definitely pay this a visit. 
PS - Apologies for the poor quality of photos. And, please keep up the good work.

We took a take away order on Navami and i wasn't very satisfied. We took mixed noodles rice manchurian chicken and szechuan chicken. Firstly, there was going in front of entrance and i nearly slipped. On Puja Evening, wasn't expecting that. Secondly went in for crab but there was no supply of it. Even the food we took didn't tasted any great though we have been regular customers from that place. Overall wasn't satisfied that day but expected more from the outlet in future.

We ordered the following:
1. Pork in Red Chili Sauce: They don't provide pork fat within this dish. It was nothing extraordinary but tasted fine.
2. Chicken Fried Rice: The fried rice was pretty good and was delicious.
3. Russian Salad: This is the fruit salad which tasted nice. Again nothing extraordinary.
On my previous visits I have tried out their baked fish which tasted great but a little overpriced. It is definitely worth trying.

I'm surprised at the low rating this restaurant has received.!! I find it to be quite an amiable place to have a good family meal.! With its dim lighting and Zen decor is really soothing. It's a small restaurant but has character. Although the upholstery might be a little damaged at places, the cleanliness this small place offers is remarkable. Coming to the food, the quality and quantity are both generous and at a decent price. Service staff are very prompt and polite.  Going for a comparison I found out better than its adjacent Golden Gate inspite of it being reasonably smaller.! Definitely would go again.

Poor and unprofessional service. And their continental dishes are pathetic. Infact pathetic is also understatement,it is a disaster. They don't even know how to serve sizzlers.

Last time I had food in Bellagio.. it was Indian, today I had Continental and Oriental. I must say, they have an excellent mouth watering vast range of food from which you can choose from. From laying the first dish till the finger bowl, service was excellent and courteous. Although some of the Chinese dishes could use some improvement. Over all experience... Not Bad!`

I really don't liked this place much cause the items are huge pricey.The quality is not very great also.Butter Chicken I ordered from here really not well prepared.The lighting is bit different in this restaurant cause it's Tibet style.The servicing is also not very efficient.I asked plenty of times to just to refill the water in my glass.Not greatly satisfied. Still you can try it out.

I had crossed this place quite a number of times but visited it today with my friends who suggested the place to me. When i entered the place, I was pleasantly surprised because I had never thought  that the place would be so big and beautiful inside. We had Chinese food which was good it taste and special mention about the quantity of the food, it's really fulfilling. We spent a lot of time eating and chatting in the peaceful environment. The staff attended on us very well. Located near Jadavpur Railway Station, a pretty good place to go and satisfy your appetite.

Ordered gravy chowmein and chicken in oyester sauce. 
Quantity is good..  But if you are craving chinese food this is definitely not the place. 
I didnt like the food. Quality and taste both. And be ready to find peas in chicken in oyester suace which is a chinese dish...  
Ambience is cozy

Ambience is good. Behavior of the staff is also good. Food is okkayish though. The North Indian dishes are better in taste than the Chinese ones. The kebabs are really good while the crispy chilli baby corn or the crispy chicken are disappointing.

Bellagio is located near Sulekha more at Jadavpur. I visited this place today with my friends to munch on some snacks basically . We had ordered crispy chilli babycorn and hot garlic potatoes initially. When these arrived, we realised the potatoes weren't tasting as they should be. We informed the manager that probably the potatoes had gone stale. We put aside the entire served potatoes and he was polite enough to exchange it for another plate of babycorn. The babycorn was properly made. My friends later ordered some crispy chicken. They were okay according to them. Coming to the interiors, ambience is perfect for dining in with dim lights. Although I feel they could improve their service more considering the fact that there are other well to do restaurants already in Jadavpur to give tough competition.

Decor if this restaurant is good. Cozy ambiance, this place is on the main road so locating this place is not an issue atall
This was my 3rd visit and this place disapointed me a bit this time around. Generally i order Continental food which is really nice over here but unfortunately this time i also ordered chinese food along with Continental and to be honest the chinese dishes are not atall upto the mark. The fried rice was oily, the veg muchurian was pathetic, chicken in oyster sauce was average. The Continental dish (Chicken Polo Indiana) was the saviour.

We visited Bellagio today. The ambiance was nice overall. But we were really disappointed with their behavior. They had an offer that said 'Buy 2 get 1 free'. We ordered 6 items and according to their offer we were entitled to atleast 2 items free which we expected them to deduct from the bill. After we were finished they gave us the bill which included service tax under VAT against the new GST system. They also did not provide us the offer of ''Buy 2 get 1 free''. When we asked a waiter about this they referred our problem to the ''captain'' of the restaurant. Now don't ask me why they call their manager ''captain''. He told us that, to validate the offer we had to inform them beforehand. This statement was completely absurd. They said that, all of their customers inform them beforehand and when asked about the validity of offers to a new customer, he had no answer. We told them to provide us the offer for the items we ate there itself, but they showed some lame excuses and started arguing with us. This incident was really disappointing and also the restaurant was completely empty. The whole management system is a cheat and liar.

The ambience is good
The interior is soothing
But it is the food that makes a restaurant truly praise worthy..
In this case,
My 1st interaction with this place was through swiggy
I ordered chicken wings and chiken salad.
I literally had to throw the food which i never do.
And today i went there because no other restro was available .
However we ordered pan fried fish , which was very oily compared to other  chinese restaurants of the town .Apart from that we also had chicken fried rice and  sanghai chicken.The rice was okay , but you will get that quality and taste in any random local food stalls; and the chicken was  sweet and disgusting .We requested the manager to make the gravy a little better and spicy  , but after that even the taste was same. 
But if you are too hungry and want to try basic kind of taste without much experiment , so you can go for it..

Average rating for a reason. We went there with a little app coupon which was promptly denied to us even though the timing and other conditions were violated. The manager was kinda rude. Nevertheless we ordered masala kulcha and chicken butter masala. The kulcha tasted different and was delicious. The chicken was also tasteful although a bit undercooked. The best part was they offered us a student discount of 15% on mentioning even though we weren't carrying our identity cards.

The good thing about this place is its ambience and nothing is as good. Food quality is OK. Manager is extremely rude and don't allow us for packing leftover. We went there through Nearbuy coupon. First of all they did not provide us all the food and said that Nearbuy has added that food by mistake. So they asked us to talk with Nearbuy. We had a small food leftover so we politely requested them to pack them rather misusing the food and wasting the food so that we can give it to some other needy person. So they are showing the rules and regulation of Nearbuy that we can have packing of the leftover. Serving of food is but slow and the rude behavior of manager give us a bitter experience. I will never visit that restaurant once again. Such a worthless branding of the restaurants.

It was last Sunday when we ordered from Bellagio via Swiggy, during a get together at a friend's place. 
The concerned delivery executive arrived in time and upon receiving the package, we could discover that the food was very hot and well packaged.
Following were the orders along with its review :
1. Toasted drumsticks - Very nice ! Juicy tender drumsticks tossed in onion, garlic and red sauce. Highly recommended.
2. Mixed Fried Rice - Nice lightly prepared fried rice with loads of prawns and chicken. Recommended.
3. Schzewan Chicken Fried Rice - An average preparation. It had the proper Sichuan flavour but the abundance of chicken, as was there in the other rice, was missing.
4. Chilli Chicken - Good.
5. Another chicken side dish (don't remember the name, probably Shanghai Chicken), which tasted tangy, was made with orange sauce and had cashews in it. The taste was good and went well with the Schzewan Rice. The only recommendation would be to thicken the gravy.
On a general sense, the quantity for the given price was competitive and the taste, much much better than many of the hyperlocal Chinese restaurants. All in all, this outlet deserves a better Zomato rating than it currently have.

Don't ever order Chinese from this place. We had ordered Sweet corn soup, crispy chicken, chicken fried rice and chicken hakka noodles. The soup was exceedingly sweet, not to our liking. The starters were over cooked and didn't get the crispy nature. The noodles were the worst of the lot. Fried rice was below average. Quantity was decent. Indoor deck was so so. 
Some of my friends said that biriyani was comparatively better. Have no intentions to try it whatsoever. Utterly disappointed on visiting this place. @sourya Sengupta

This restaurant is just located beside our college and it mostly has nice offers for students.
We get 15% off with our students id.Sometimes there is buy 2 get 1 free offer etc.
I have come here with my friends several times for lunch.
I have tried their continental as well chinese preparations and I personally like their chinese more.
Steaks are nice but sometimes its a bit smelly.
Chinese dishes are fresh and tasty.
We had several still a few mentionworthy are burnt coriander fried rice,schezwan fried rice,fish in hunan sauce,prawn in oyster sauce.
Recently I tried their butter garlic pepper prawn and it is absolutely lipsmacking.
The fish items are well cooked and very soft.
The caramel pudding also tastes good.
The only drawback is service is not so prompt.

It's located near jadavpur 8b bus stand. As we went there before the scheduled time so we couldn't order as per our choice. We wanted to have some tandoori preparations there,but it was not ready because of the time. So we ordered chicken hakka chowmin,mixed hakka chowmin and thai chicken. Thai chicken was super tasty..and quantity was more than enough. Two plate of chowmin are sufficient for 3 people. Chowmin was served with red sauce and was more than sufficient in amount. Service is fast,ambience is very nyc and food quality is good.
This restro is a bonanza for the students. As they provide 15% discount on the total amount as a student concession. 
Overall it was a good place for foodies. Want to try their tandoori dishes next tym.

Don't ever order Chinese from this place. We had ordered Sweet corn soup, crispy chicken, chicken fried rice and chicken hakka noodles. The soup was exceedingly sweet, not to our liking. The starters were over cooked and didn't get the crispy nature. The noodles were the worst of the lot. Fried rice was below average. Quantity was decent. Indoor deck was so so. 
Some of my friends said that biriyani was comparatively better. Have no intentions to try it whatsoever. Utterly disappointed on visiting this place. @sourya Sengupta

This restaurant is just located beside our college and it mostly has nice offers for students.
We get 15% off with our students id.Sometimes there is buy 2 get 1 free offer etc.
I have come here with my friends several times for lunch.
I have tried their continental as well chinese preparations and I personally like their chinese more.
Steaks are nice but sometimes its a bit smelly.
Chinese dishes are fresh and tasty.
We had several still a few mentionworthy are burnt coriander fried rice,schezwan fried rice,fish in hunan sauce,prawn in oyster sauce.
Recently I tried their butter garlic pepper prawn and it is absolutely lipsmacking.
The fish items are well cooked and very soft.
The caramel pudding also tastes good.
The only drawback is service is not so prompt.

This was my second time ordering from this place

Earlier I had ordered a prawn malai curry and veg Chinese chopsuey

Chopsuey was below average,the gravy/soup that comes along with the chopsuey was inedible with an extremely foul smell from I guess the amount of cabbage it had

On the other hand the malai curry was delicious with a really tasty curry that is coconuty,yummy and had a good amount of delicious succulent prawns

But wait,if you guys think I'm here to give a good review then your wrong

So tonight I ordered the malai curry again as I suddenly remembered how delicious it was.....I had actually completely forgot about this place

I ordered quite at night so the restaurant could have not accepted the order if they wished to

But instead they accepted the order and within 10 mins I got call from zomato delivery boy which means by 10 minutes they prepared,cooked and even packed the food

I was thinking its a good thing but its not

After getting the food I eat it with rice and yuck it has uncooked raw prawns in it n smells disgusting!!

Not a single piece of prawn is edible because its almost raw and extremely undercooked.....I had to throw out this as  how could I eat uncooked, almost raw prawns.

why did restaurant accepted my order if they knew they were in hurry and in hurry would add undercooked raw prawns in the curry?

If they didn't had the time to throughly cook it then there is a simple option.....just don't accept the order

Oh wait I guess not accepting means not getting the payment

This is unacceptable

Can you see the prawns are looking so red uncooked, almost raw?? Imagine eating these raw prawns!
Yuck!!

I'm so disappointed as I was actually planning on regularly ordering from them as the malai curry was delicious last time(when it was properly cooled,that is!)

Nah never ordering again

The restaurant is near Jadavpur 8B towards Sulekha.. they serve Indian, Chinese and Continental. have tried their Continental and chinese.. In continental  we tried
1) Prawn Popcorn - it was good and crispy
2) Barbecued chicken wings - Nothing extraordinary 
3) Chicken Tetrazzine- It was delicious 
4) Prawn Gambarothi - was barely average nothing like the original recipee 
5) Mixed  Grill Sizzler- Did not like it at all.. the chicken was chewy, the liver was half cooked and the sauce was way too salty

The chinese in this restaurant is like any other Indo- chinese restaurant very average 
It is okay for home delivery when u just want to eat out..

Its a lot better in the inside than the view you get from outside...  The service time is perfect...  The staffs were good..  And the food part is quiet good..  
Barbq chicken wings :4/5
Golden fried prown :4/5

Mixed fried rice: 4/5 
Chilli fish: 5/5

I haven't been to the outlet, but only to the stall they had set up at Khyber Paas. We ordered a Baked Crab and Chicken Drumsticks. The baked crabs were served in capsicum, which really was a disappointment. However, the taste wasn't so bad. The Drumsticks, however, were too saucy and the taste didn't go down too well with us, even though the size was quite big.

Hopped in with my friend for a lazy Sunday brunch. Ordered Chilli pork for starters (was a bit sceptical about how it will turn out ;having read the earlier reviews).We were in for a pleasant surprise.. the preparation was perfect with just the right amount of spice and the quality of the meat was better than most of the places I have tried pork in. Then came the basic Hakka noodles with hot garlic prawns on the side. Again prawn was a big hit , noodles was average. Since the menu read multi-cuisine I couldn't resist my craving for a classic grilled fish with lemon butter sauce, But I guess we pushed our luck a bit too much there. The fish was soft and succulent but the preparation did not hit the right chord. They served it with butter rice and veggies as is usually done with a bit too much butter.
Having said that, we are definitely going back there for the pork and the prawn!!

The place is easy to find, it's few minute walk from 8b stand. The ambiance is nice. They play some nice music. The waiters are very well behaved. The food is mediocre. I ordered Mixed Hakka Chow, Chicken Manchurian, Butter Nun, Chicken Bharta. The Chicken Manchurian is a bit flat, The Chow was good, The Nun was great, but the worst was Chicken Bharta, it's the worst bharta i ate even worse than what some local food chains serve us. Overall a mediocre experience.

First of all, I want to say that I have been there because I had an offer. In that offer, we got 6 biriyanis (4 mutton & 2 chicken), 3 plates chicken reshmi kebabs (6 pieces in each plate) and 6 cold drinks of 300 ml in just ₹672 instead of ₹1800. So yes it was a pretty good deal. 
Now talking about the service. It was excellent, no doubt. Sometimes even the manager came to check everything. The waiters are also great. They were always there. The music was also great. They served the kebabs as starters. It was just decent. Can't say great or excellent. I have eaten Chicken Reshmi kebab of Aminia, so in front of it, Bellagio was nothing. But again, both are a lot different. Then came our biriyani out of the house. Biriyani was ok. The quantity was good but quality wasn't that good. It could be better. The pieces of mutton & chicken were something they can be proud of. I can't say more about cold drinks. It was normal. 

So if you ask me, is it worth it ??? Yes it is if the price is  ₹672. But if the price is ₹1800, then it will be a clear NO.

-This restaurant has all the varieties for you! Continental, Chinese, everything and most of all it tastes good. I have been there several times, the ambience is good, but they can still manage to put up good music to enhance it more! 
-Service and food quality is very nice, it is actually worth it rather getting more than what you are paying for!! Got some good discounts, not sure what was the occasion but, some of the dishes which I liked I have given the snaps. 
-You all can try the Poloindiana Chicken, Chickent with baby corn, Chicken Parmesan, Chicken Tetrazzini, burnt corriander fried rice and the sizzler (which I heard is enough for 2 people). 
-Mehfoon (rice noodles) could be improved a lot than what other restaurants serves..
-Few people recommended to have the sizzler (which can suffice for 3 people atleast). Certain times, they don't serve duck, maybe the demand is less. The price is ok not too high, worth a mention they do maintain good quality and quantity!

Ordered for Lamb in Schezwan sauce , with mixed fried rice and went for Sweet n Sour chicken as another side dish. Lamb was not at all upto the mark, the fried rice was only as good as ordinary chinese resturants, the chicken dish was good enough. The ambience was good, but the staff at service were unwilling to serve the food, they will just leave the food at our table, leaving you to serve the food all by yourself. Service Not at all friendly. So I will recommend my followers not to go for any LAMB dish, better go for Chicken side items

Ordered chicken Mexican sizzler with prawn sizzlers today. Food was served after 35 mins waiting. Though prawn sizzler was awesome in taste but they served us veg sizzlers with few chickens mixed with it claiming it to be Mexican chicken sizzlers. We could notice only paneer inside it instead of chicken. Taste was horrible. But at the end they admitted their mistakes. It was originally a veg one mixed with chicken. On top of that they had taken the price for Mexican chicken sizzler. Just think twice before visiting this place. will never visit this place again.

First of all it's just beside K.S ROY T.B HOSPITAL.2 mins walking distance from KPC MEDICAL COLLEGE.
I ordered via Nearbuy Groupon.
I purchased two 4 course chinese meal coupon of 349Rs each..
Generally they offer us to choose soup,desert and main course item.
But Bellagio did not allow us to choose.. They allowed to choose only main course item
1. sweet chicken corn soup-->average
2.crispy chicken-->average
3. chicken fried rice-->chicken was very less
    ->Average quality & Quantity is reasonable
4. chicken hakka noodles-->Same as above
5.Chili chicken-->8pc was there->Good
6. Garlic chicken-->Too much sweet->Average
7. Lime soda--> Good
All over AVERAGE..
Not good like BAWARCHI.
If u wanna have chinese food then visit at BAWARCHI.

Okay..today I went to Bellagio for dinner first time..
It's located near Kpc hospital,jadavpur...
It's a casual dining restaurant...
Now come to the point..
I ordered chicken bharta and butter roti..
In Chicken bharta the half egg was not good..smelled bad..
But yet..in bharta,, it was filled by shredded chicken...which was good...
Okay type of food..(I was very hungry..,,so I forgot to take photos..)
I got 10℅ discount on the total bill... don't know why..
Overall okay..new restaurant..so thumb's up..

A nicely decorated multi cuisine located at the heart of Jadavpur. A decent place for Chinese delicacies .Food is normal nothing exceptional about that but it tastes good. Service and ambience are poor. There is a foul smell in the entrance portion and it's really awkward.

I ordered food form here a week ago and there is something serious to share. Yes, no doubt the quantity was more than enough and the packaging was quite good and neat. I ordered mixed gravy noodles. The taste of the gravy was not that satisfactory unfortunately . Yes, it was full of all the expected ingredients in sufficient amount but still there was serious lack of salt. Due this extreme paucity of salt I was even unable to finish it. Lastly I ordered mixed gravy noodles, but comparatively the amount of prawns were quite high than the others. Yeah,after all the complete experience was good. 

The most important part is that they told me over phone not to order food online further of amount less than 300. Though in their online order section on zomato , it is written that minimum order cost should be 99 only. There should be a transparency at least. It is quite unsatisfactory.

First of all it's just beside K.S ROY T.B HOSPITAL.2 mins walking distance from KPC MEDICAL COLLEGE.
I ordered via Nearbuy Groupon.
I purchased two 4 course chinese meal coupon of 349Rs each..
Generally they offer us to choose soup,desert and main course item.
But Bellagio did not allow us to choose.. They allowed to choose only main course item
1. sweet chicken corn soup-->average
2.crispy chicken-->average
3. chicken fried rice-->chicken was very less
    ->Average quality & Quantity is reasonable
4. chicken hakka noodles-->Same as above
5.Chili chicken-->8pc was there->Good
6. Garlic chicken-->Too much sweet->Average
7. Lime soda--> Good
All over AVERAGE..
Not good like BAWARCHI.
If u wanna have chinese food then visit at BAWARCHI.

Okay..today I went to Bellagio for dinner first time..
It's located near Kpc hospital,jadavpur...
It's a casual dining restaurant...
Now come to the point..
I ordered chicken bharta and butter roti..
In Chicken bharta the half egg was not good..smelled bad..
But yet..in bharta,, it was filled by shredded chicken...which was good...
Okay type of food..(I was very hungry..,,so I forgot to take photos..)
I got 10℅ discount on the total bill... don't know why..
Overall okay..new restaurant..so thumb's up..

Dashami afternoon five of us decided to have our lunch at Bellagio. Thought there might be a long line of customers but was surprised to see that some tables were still available. The place was a bit noisy and they took long long time to serve. But at the end of the day they served good food even during those rush hours of Pujo days. We ordered a Chicken Hakka Noodles and Hunan Chicken and let me tell you that quantity was more than sufficient that we 3 couldn't finish it. In starter we ordered Pan Fried Chicken but it was not up to the mark. Some of us ordered Mexican Sizzler they served it with rice l,again it was average. But their American Chopsuye was good but the serving option could have been better. Overall nice and budget friendly.

We had visited this restaurant as a group of 6 people. We ordered pepper chicken and crispy chicken for starters. Both the dishes were tasty enough. The main course was chicken Hakka noodles with hot garlic chicken and sweet and sour chicken. The sweet and sour chicken seemed more sweet than usual and it threw it a little off balance. We also felt that the prices were a little on the higher side for the quantity of food served.

Bellagio Restaurant proudly claims to present Continental cuisines, but the restaurant is in no manner exemplary. Located just beside Golden Gate restaurant and very near Calcutta Bistro, it is up for a tough competition when it comes to garnering consumers. The interiors are extremely dim with a good music. The lamb and mixed grill sizzlers we ordered were aplenty in quantity, the flavours however could have been improved a lot. I was very disappointed by the lack of choice for desserts, when our server explained that there was nothing to offer but caramel custard. The custard was not very silky either and the caramel extremely watery and cold..The food is not overtly costly but the dearth of a good continental restaurant continues to persist in the locales, and Bellagio could definitely fit the bill if it manages to tighten its seat belts.

Well I am writing the review after having visited this place for quite a number of times now...

It provides a good variety in menu...have tried Indian,continental and chinese starters till date and all of them was good.

Food is very moderately priced and every price on the menu is inclusive of tax which is great.

Must try the shrimp starters which I feel is very moderately priced.

A hell of an evening, turned to a good dinner resumed by a good management team of bellagio. Mr. Partho Sarkar (hope i got the name right), with whom we spoke on phone, was extremely sweet to treat us nicely, deal with our grievances and finally delivering the order at 10.30pm which was supposed to be delivered at 9.07 pm.
The delivery boy MANASH BAIRAGI was first assigned the order via Zomato, whose behaviour was rude, unethical, disrespectful and logic less. He said many things which we normally don't say to any person let alone customers, moreover we don't speak like that to any lady.  We were forced to return back the order, but the former mentioned person on phone as well as the second delivery person was extremely polite and served us well. 
We ordered chicken lolipop, chicken with baby corn which was nonetheless tasty as per the restaurants standards. Apart from this we are regular in bellagio, that is why they had sent the person for delivering who handles the counter second time.
Just a suggestion to this restaurant, firing is not an option, as we mentioned earlier to the counter guy, please train the delivery persons too for customer satisfaction, which is most important for restaurants that deliver.

To be honest it was an amazing experience.  I guess its not the right way to start but it's just what comes to mind first...  
The place had a pretty nice ambience and a knowledgeable staff.  They came in regularly and asked if I had enjoyed the taste or whether everything was cooked to my liking. 
If its your first time there...  Guys i ask you to order the bbq chicken wings with yours eye closed.  Feel the sauce sting your lips and tongue and yet you shall not be able to stop yoirself from gorging on them. 
Cold drinks are served in those jar like things with a straw which seems to be the trend now and i fpr one aint complaining. 
For the main dish we had Singaporean fried rice and pork in red chilli sauce. The food was just awesome and the pork was juicy and spicy.  The rice and chicken came in enough proportions to serve two. 
By the end we were breathing fire and the caramel custard to top it off was welcome.  It wasn't out of the world or the best but it gets the job done. 
All in all a great place and highly recommended.  
Plus they give you a 100bucks coupon to redeem off on your next visit.  Win win.

Fresh lime soda ...good and refreshing
Sweet corn chicken soup ... absolutely bland and disappointing
Fish finger ... once again just thick coats of crumb and batter...not worth
Momo ... the saviour...it was best of the lot...the rating is for that only...

Located near KPC medical college and hospital, Bellagio gave us the most horrible experience in a restaurant till date. This is basically a multicuisine restaurant with nice decorations. But that's it..the fairy tale ends here. The so called chicken drumsticks they served wasn't properly cooked and with one bite blood came out. Next came the chicken sizzler. The chicken pieces were dry and dint seem fresh. Only the cabbage leaf was edible. Next came fried rice and chicken side dish. Both were average and came in miniscule quantity. The tiger prawns looked like tiny worms swimming in a bowl of gravy. Our disappointment was further enhanced when we heard that all the desserts were not available. With utter disappointment we promised ourselves not to visit this place again.
Service is worst. 😝😠

This place used to be Red Chopsticks, earlier. It has been handed over to the new owners with the name Bellajio. I remember visiting this place in 2013 and having scrumptious dinner. Beautiful pork ribs in BBQ sauce, chicken marcopolo, pecking duck, and mocktails. The decor and the service were fantastic.

Visited this place with the same expectations and was thoroughly disappointed. We wanted hot and sour soup with honey glazed fries to be served at a time. The waiter brought us the fries. When we said that we wanted it with the soup, they took the fries away. The soup arrived after almost 15 mins, and they brought the same fries which had become cold by then. Next was the duck in wine sauce was full of thin fish like bones. There was barely any meat between the bones. Then we ordered BBQ pork ribs. The waiter informed us that the ribs are not available and we could try pork shoulder. We agreed, and the shoulder again was too full of bones. Finally had ordered the chef's special sizzler. This is the worst sizzler I have ever had. Bland pieces of chicken in curry like gravy. The mocktails were fine. The price is too high for the service and the food quality.

If is really sad to see such a nice restaurant turn into a horrible eating experience.

Located near 8b bus stand this is a new kid on the block. Pretty interiors and well behaved, polite and efficient staff are the high points of this place. It is a quiet place with dim lights giving it a very relaxing ambience in totality.  Low points being the food quality and the price charged for it. The food is very average ( menu is fairly explicit) and according to me, a little overpriced considering the quality. At the end of the day one comes to a restaurant for the food essentially. I liked the sizzler and the rice but the side dishes and starters really need attention.

A very descent restaurant. The entrance is small , located near golden joy restaurant, Jadavpur . The service is good, I liked the ambience. The starters are good we ordered crispy chicken and drums of heaven . In the main course the quantity was okay. The side chicken dish or chicken in oyster sauce could have been better so giving 3.5 instead of 4. Price is very reasonable.

This place has a very good ambience nd polite waiters , good service. But these things are always over shadowed if the quality of the food is bad. The food they serve are almost equivalent to the road side chinese thellas .... The schezwan , pan fried , chicken in oyster sauce everything tasted the same.. Blunt nd more blunt infact they were  purely tasteless. The noodles they serve is very cheap nd ordinary. Very dissatisfied with their business strategy , whn they started they served good food nd now whn they r gaining a bit of good reputation in the market they are lowering down the quality  day by day.

It was post a lunch invitation , my friends & me realised that we still have some space left. As it was raining, we without any prior plan dropped in.

The staffs are welcoming but not as active as they should be. We opted for Mixed noodles and Manchurian chicken but they took so long that it left a bad impression. I didn't find anything extraordinary and it was as reasonable & simple as it's pricing. I somehow liked the ambience out here. 

They gave 20% off on student concession which in a way excluded the vat that they had earlier added.

I love this place anytime...perfect for lunch or dinner or even if you wanna grab something quick. Everything in terms of ambience, lights and decor are in tune with your mood. We had Schezwan fried rice, pan fried chicken and Thai chicken and they were pretty good. The quantity is ample. One thing they need to improve on is their service. It's quite slow. Otherwise, you'll not be disappointed.

First of all sorry for giving review so late, I was quite regular to bellagio. When it was newly opened its make good hype in Tollygunge n Jadavpur area as  the continental food @ this price range is really tempting. 

I think I been to bellagio not less then 10 times every time I visit there I always order continental cuisines. So my review will be on all over my 10+ visits. 
First about the decorations n interior, it's is really good and it's quite set the mood for the appetite but somehow I feel like the interior is more like bar inclined. 
Now it's about the staff , trust me are not @ all professionals. But they are trying to do best from their level, as I said they are not PROFESSIONALS. There is an incident, me and friend order three dishes Pork ribs, Sizzler pork and pork steak . Waiter took the order and to give us two orders.  For pork ribs we waited for that 20mins after that he came and told us that we didt mention him about pork ribs.
Now let me tell about the food as I always order the continental, you must've guessed that I like their continental food. Pork ribs , sizzler pork and pork steak all I just loved it.
Pork ribs are too good and it's perfectly blended with spices. I can say that it can be USP for Bellagio. But once I ordered pork steak, the steak was cold from inside. 
Chilly squids are good but some time they over fry it. Sour lime soda is as usual. 
But due to work for last three months i didt visit Bellagio. So right now I have no idea about the foods .

from Chopsticks to Red Chopsticks and presently Bellagio. This outlet changed the ambience and menu with its name. formerly serving Chinese now a multi cuisine restaurant. most of their Chinese preprn are very tasty.
 
1. but remember if they say medium spicy it means actually reeeeeeed hot. and a lil sweet means as sweet as honey. so judge yourself don't go for suggestions.

2.also their garlic chicken and fish are zero spicy dishes. go for same in garlic sauce those are awesome.

yesterday we experimented mix n match
starter
 pepper fish (very salty)
lahori murg tikka kebab(good a lil salty again)

north indian
tandoori roti(soft as hell just tooooooooooo good)
murg chatpata (indeed chatpata delicious)

chinese
mix meefoons (wow again you wont need any side dish its really tasty)
garlic fish(a total blunder as sweet as honey)

last fresh lime soda to save our taste buds from garlic fish

Over all good Experience and really very pocket friendly as all the prices in the menu were inclusive of taxes

I love the food. They have got so much variety in food and many options to choose from. A lot of exotic meats on the menu. The food tasted really good and it was of good quality but they took more than half an hour to bring the starter to the table. We were just about to leave till they requested us to wait a little more for the food. The restaurant was almost empty but still it felt kind of stuffy. They can remove all the wall fans. It will look better that way. I will still give it an okay rating because the food made up for their bad service.

from Chopsticks to Red Chopsticks and presently Bellagio. This outlet changed the ambience and menu with its name. formerly serving Chinese now a multi cuisine restaurant. most of their Chinese preprn are very tasty.
 
1. but remember if they say medium spicy it means actually reeeeeeed hot. and a lil sweet means as sweet as honey. so judge yourself don't go for suggestions.

2.also their garlic chicken and fish are zero spicy dishes. go for same in garlic sauce those are awesome.

yesterday we experimented mix n match
starter
 pepper fish (very salty)
lahori murg tikka kebab(good a lil salty again)

north indian
tandoori roti(soft as hell just tooooooooooo good)
murg chatpata (indeed chatpata delicious)

chinese
mix meefoons (wow again you wont need any side dish its really tasty)
garlic fish(a total blunder as sweet as honey)

last fresh lime soda to save our taste buds from garlic fish

Over all good Experience and really very pocket friendly as all the prices in the menu were inclusive of taxes

I love the food. They have got so much variety in food and many options to choose from. A lot of exotic meats on the menu. The food tasted really good and it was of good quality but they took more than half an hour to bring the starter to the table. We were just about to leave till they requested us to wait a little more for the food. The restaurant was almost empty but still it felt kind of stuffy. They can remove all the wall fans. It will look better that way. I will still give it an okay rating because the food made up for their bad service.

Located in the busy area of Jadavpur 8B (just beside Golden Gate). The restaurant is in the 1st floor. The initial impression will be the ambience and interiors. Well furnished and dim lighting. Quiet spacy..
Coming to the food, ordered Hot n sour soup, chili garlic noodles, nd sweet n sour chicken. The quantity was maintainable, but serving the food to the table took some time. The rating is mainly for the ambience and decor. Food is regular in taste.

Jadavpur has now become a hub of restaurants. Bellagio is a fine dining family restaurant and trust me you are just going to experience the best of taste within the best of prices. Ambience is quite normal just like any other restaurant but to mention that the music they play will take away all your tiredness after a long day in office. We took #FishChips with mayonnaise as a starter and what a sumptuous start it was for our dinner. In main course, we ordered #GarlicNan #MixedRice #ChatpataChicken and #GrilledFish. #ChatpataChicken was mouth watering along with all the other items.

Only good food can beat the heat and your bad mood after a fucked up day at offc. Well that quite sums up my experience there

Jadavpur is the place to be when you're broke. So many places offering reasonably good food at unreasonably low prices. I've had a full meal here for under 130 rupees. (per head cost. There were 6 of us) no specific recommendations, try your luck.

Today went there with some friends for having post poila baishakh special lunch. We have a groupon coupon for North indian combo meal. Firstly the ambiance is cozy and the dining space is very nicely decorated with dim lights hanging from the ceiling. Coming to the foods we have ordered non veg shorba, chicken reshmi kabab, Lahori murg kabab as starters and peas pulao along with chicken tikia butter masala and chicken reshmi butter masala as main course. Also oredered butter nan and daal darbari along with green salad. The non veg shorba was disastrous to taste having no salty or spicy taste. Both the kababs are good specially the lahori kabab. The peas pulao was a little bit extra sweet but tasty. Chicken reshmi masala was very much sweet as it was any dessert which is really disappointing. Chicken tikia masala was comparatively better but nothing extraordinary. The butter nan and daal darbari tasted best among all other items. Lastly the fresh lime sodas were served which refreshed us. As desserts butter scotch ice cream was served and that was also good. Overall not really happy with today's lunch. Overall the experience was not so much satisfactory.

Since Bellagio is right next to my college I'm quite a frequent visitor there, and that says a lot about the quality of food they serve. 
The Reshmi butter masala is to die for. Biryani is also quite delicious. I wouldn't suggest the continental salads a lot thought. My suggestion would be to stick to Mughlai and North Indian and have a feast at one of Jadavpur's most underrated restaurants.

All the items were freshly prepared,the taste of the foods were equally good. !

The place is nice and so I'd the interior.
On the main road.
The manchow soup: not good. Tasted of soya sauce and extra vinegar.
The chef salad: this was good. Fresh veggies. Boiled egg. Mayonnaise.
Crispy chicken: it tasted better. Crispy and delicious.
Masala cold drink: excess jal jeera. Too much sugar. No fizz. Bad.
Orange juice: it diluted tropicana. Not good.
Summer bloomer (I don't remember the name) : orange juice mixed with ice cream. Tasted like antacid.

Chicken corriander soup- it was good and a clear soup.

I haven't seen a more idiotic and obnoxious place than this one when it comes to home deliveries. We ordered Ham steaks and got a lot of chicken drumsticks instead, that too after of 2 hours of wait. When we confronted the delivery people about this misplacement, they were adamant to acknowledge such a problem ever occurred. We insisted on a refund, but they repeatedly  told us they would correct the orders in few minutes, And then, another hour of waiting,followed by the delivery of 3 poorly cooked steaks which we could  not eat out of  disgust. Also other items were really substandard, for instance the roasted chicken salad had no  chicken in it. Moreover after we reported ours grievances,they were saying this kind of thing cannot happen instead of apologizing.  I would   not recommend this place if you want to have a nice dinner in your home.

Thr worst dining experience till date. The restaurant might look good but trust me, the food is down to 0. 

I wanted it to be a simple dinner so i ordered plain rice and chicken curry and a veg dish. Three of them equally bad. The rice that they served had something strange in it. The waiter took that in again and the plate that my sister was served was not clean. I really question the hygiene of this place. 

I m really disappointed. Still a 1.5 for the interior.

This is a relatively new place right on the main road in Jadavpur. A multi cuisine restaurant, serves even sea food.  It stays pretty empty though. We had ordered a chicken stroganoff , a mixed grilled dish that had rice and chicken in sauce with mashed potatoes , a Mexican sizzler and a mixed seafood sizzler.The food is pretty good though I have had better stroganoffs. The sizzlers were tangy and spicy and I struggled to finish my sizzler on my own. The prawn in the seafood sizzler was yummy. Their service is a little slow. And they have a tiny candle lit on the tables that doesn't quite create the necessary ambience for candle light dinner and makes the place dark and gloomy.

I visited the place couple of times, the last time being on the saraswati puja. This is a place which will not disappoint you with the food quality and quantity. But the service will disgust you. They will keep you waiting for an eternity to provide the ordered food. The decorum doesnot bore you but still a star gers deducted for that.
But i find their food great.

Went there for dinner. Worst experience i have ever had in my life. We went there after getting groupon offer for indian meal....
1) Non Veg Shorba-- Tasteless,even they forgot to add salt,after adding so many salt and pepper i hardly had 3 spoons.
2)Starter was quite good.
3)Main Course- we ordered chicken reshmi bt masala..It was a pulpy gravy with lots of sugar.i dont know how they made it.
chicken tikka masala-same dish was repeated they thought we will not recognize..why the chef adds so many sugar in every dish?? i dont have any idea
chicken varta- that was edible.
butter nan- again they put sugar instead of butter.
only lime soda and chocolate icecream was good..worst food.. service was good. if you dont have anything to do go sit with your partner..have some starters with lime soda.. dont go for lunch or dinner..i wish i could rate it -5..

Well, ratings are subjective yet its amusing that this joint has got such an abysmal rating on zomato... yes, the entrance.to this restaurant is narrow,waiting lounge under the staircases is not a welcome idea ,interiors are not authentic but these negative points aside I must say the restaurant offers a variety of food right from squids to duck , a rarity in jadavpur area and the prices are not too steep. I went with a colleague yesterday as I had a site visit..it was a hot sultry afternoon and we were exasperated and hungry..  alongwith fried rice we ordered a duck and a pork dish alongwith soft drinks and..... surprise, surprise , a bottle of fruit beer!! The duck was the best of.the lot, moderately spicy and soft ,it was a delight!! The pork dish with all.its spicy,.aroamtic flavour was a.delight.too.. the only damp squib was the fried rice which was a little too dry for me... i loved the service it was quick and prompt, and the waiters were well behaved..  definitely worth visiting.

I don't know why the ratings are so low for Bellagio here in Zomato, for me it was an above-average experience. 
6 of us went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon with groupon coupon. There were just another family and one group of friends at that time, so we didn't face any problem getting a table instantly. Service is satisfactory; the people are polite and well-mannered, though they can try to speed up a bit. 
Items we chose include chicken shorba, chicken tikka, lahori fish tikka and mahi kebabs, butter naan, Daal Makhani, Peas Pulao, Chicken Reshmi butter masala and Amritsari Fish.
To be honest, the chicken starters were too much salty to our taste, both of them. The fish one was good though. But that's all I have to complain about the food served. Because rest of the items were really good, both in quantity and taste. Special thumbs up goes to Amritsari fish and Peas Pulao. Butter naans were perfect- neither undercooked, nor too dry and stiff. 
We finished our lunch with a scoop of ice cream each and left the place happy and satisfied.

The small lump of mash potatoes was full of lumps. They don't even bother to add cream/butter to that. The chicken were batter fried chicken with a thick coating. Overall really bad.
In another occasion we ordered chicken tikka kebab. The kebab was not at all tender and it was not even grilled well

went there last sunday evening around 7pm.
 asked at the parcel counter below, whether their special dish, Galauti chicken was available or  not, they answered positive. I went upstairs, to have it on table.
the raestaurants was empy except a couple in the corner.
the lights in the middle are so dim, that u cant even read the menu card properly.
I ordered for Galauti kebab, he waiter nodded and went off.
After almost waing for half n hour or so, the waiter came up with a plate of CHICKEN LLOLIPOP !!!!! When askedabout my order, he simply said, I had orderd lollipop only !!!  after some argument, they were ready to take it back, but asked them to parcel i, nd whiffed off from that dingy place !!! never to go again there !!!

I don't remember how many times I have been there..... since it has opened. Bellagio is mainly the modified version of Red Chopsticks with the same decoration but with different staffs. The quality and quantity is quite good according to the price. Staffs are also very good and courteous. But the only problem I have faced with their slow service. Otherwise all is okay. Here, I have tried their so many dishes but some of them are my favorites:
❤hunan chicken
❤chicken drumsticks
❤chilly prwan
❤mixed gravy noodles
❤chicken steamed momo

If can wait after ordering for half an hour then only go. Their sevice is really bad. I entered around 6pm and left around 7.45 out of which i had to wait for like an hour for all my dishes to come to the table. Now regarding the food had chicken shorba, fish tandoori, chicken peshwari murh tikia, peas pulao, fish tikia butter masala and chicken reshmi butter masala.
Shorba - Tasted like chicken stock and only three to four small pieces of chicken.
Fish tandoori - Average nothing too great
Chicken murg tikia - Tasted weird masala wasnt cooked properly
Peas pulao - Ok but a litte sweet.
Fish Tikia - Tasted like fried fish tossed in masala a bit spicy okk i guess
Chicken reshmi butter masala - Too too sweet I think i never had chicken reshmi this sweet 
Overall not recommended

Last week we went there for a lunch. It was my 1st time visit at Bellagio. It is near the KPC Medical College. When we enter we saw only two tables were occupied and when we start our food, totally empty. When we ordered the menu, for example Peas Pulao, the waiter went to kitchen for asking whether the rice is prepared or not. When we drink our water, every time we asked to fill up. They couldn't see that. When we complete our starter, then we asked to serve the main course. The service was pathetic. We ordered Chicken Reshmi Kabab which taste like processed chicken, not fresh, no fiber was there. Main course Butter Nan and Dal Makhani were good, Chicken Methi Malai was so so type. Ice Cream was good. Highly not recommended.

Food: 2.5/5

Pricing: 2.5/5

Service: 0.5/5

Ambiance: 3/5

Should I begin from the atmosphere of the restaurant ? It was visibly fabulous. I have visited for the first time and impressed by it but if I talk about the food quality it was a bit of embarrassment. We ordered their especial combo for club solitaire members. Chicken and mutton biriyani and mutton pasinda those are average and the chicken was very sticky and bad in quality. AND finally the the dessert .  Desart caramal custard was not good and don't know why they serve it ?It's remarkably bad enough to end you dinner with this .I found it all embarrassing.

Last week we went there for a lunch. It was my 1st time visit at Bellagio. It is near the KPC Medical College. When we enter we saw only two tables were occupied and when we start our food, totally empty. When we ordered the menu, for example Peas Pulao, the waiter went to kitchen for asking whether the rice is prepared or not. When we drink our water, every time we asked to fill up. They couldn't see that. When we complete our starter, then we asked to serve the main course. The service was pathetic. We ordered Chicken Reshmi Kabab which taste like processed chicken, not fresh, no fiber was there. Main course Butter Nan and Dal Makhani were good, Chicken Methi Malai was so so type. Ice Cream was good. Highly not recommended.

Food: 2.5/5

Pricing: 2.5/5

Service: 0.5/5

Ambiance: 3/5

Should I begin from the atmosphere of the restaurant ? It was visibly fabulous. I have visited for the first time and impressed by it but if I talk about the food quality it was a bit of embarrassment. We ordered their especial combo for club solitaire members. Chicken and mutton biriyani and mutton pasinda those are average and the chicken was very sticky and bad in quality. AND finally the the dessert .  Desart caramal custard was not good and don't know why they serve it ?It's remarkably bad enough to end you dinner with this .I found it all embarrassing.

Today went there for dinner with my wife. Took chicken corn soup and sea food sizzler from their winter carnival menu. The soup was clearly taken from extract of rice. It was evident from the taste. Sweetness was missing from the soup. The sizzler was too not up to the expectation. Sea foods like fish prawns and squids were very less in amount.rice was much in amount which tasted like "ghee bhat" rather than tossed in sauce. The base of the sizzlers which was cabbage leaves were burnt too. On a whole not a pleasant experience at all.

Went there a few days ago with 2 friends of mine.Nice ambience.We were starving and ordered right away.We had ordered @pan fried chicken,mongolian fried rice,chicken hakka noodles and a side dish of fish whose name I don't remember.All the dishes tasted good.I didn't like the fried rice because it has cashews in it.But I guess that's how mongolian fried rice is supposed to be,can't blame them.The noodles was really really nice.Quantity is good,enough to satisfy 3 hungry souls.

I entered Bellagio with a lot of expectation. The restaurant looks very small from outside, but once you are in, you may actually like the ambience. Being a Tuesday noon, there was no rush at all. The lights were dim, with soothing old day English pop songs being played in background, in low volume so that it doesn't interfere with your conversation with someone. I ordered Crispy Chicken for starter and Mexican sizzler for main dish. The crispy chicken was really really good. Quantity was good enough for 2 person and definitely worth 150 INR. But what disappointed me was the Mexican sizzler. It was boneless chickens, about 6-7 in number, along with finely (too finely) cut mushrooms served with mashed potato, boiled veg and 2 spoons of butter rice. The plate, on which it was served was so small that even the waiter spilled some rice before he could put the plate on table. Also, unless you manoeuvre your plate properly, you will end up spilling half of the rice on table. Taste wise it isn't very good compared to hardcore sizzler joints like Peter Cat or Mocambo. I can't say the dish worths 250 INR. Over all, my Bellogia experience was a mixed one. I can't rate the restaurants based on only 2 dishes, but I am surely not ordering sizzler if I visit Bellogia again.

The erstwhile Chopstix renamed and re started as Bellagio...an earnest effort from the new owners I must say. The interiors havnt been changed at all and are identical with the erstwhile Chopstix.Seats are very comfy with chairs and sofas both being available...ambiance is good enough. Food is decent..but the quantity served really disappointed me. I had ordered 1 Lung fung soup to be served into 2..however, from the portions served it was really difficult to tell whether 1 was served into 2 or 4!!Quality wise the food was ok...Golden fried prawns and the Thai chicken tasted decent enough. Price is also resonable and have been made much cheaper than the erstwhile Chopstix which is a plus point. Overall the place offers decent enough food (a few issues might be raised against the quantity served) at a reasonable price.

I went to this restaurant yesterday with my GF. On the way I planned to have a dinner there  and buy a deal from Nearbuy. As it was not possible for me to take the print out so I called them to confirm whether they will accept it or not if I show the deal from mobile app. They confirmed that it will work if I buy it from nearbuy as they have machine to scan the voucher code. So I went there with lots of expectation but shocked with their reception. First off all they asked me for the print out and also denied that they have confirmed mobile app will work. I also talked to the manager and nothing worked. At last I had to call Nearbuy and after the discussion with main branch manager they agreed to serve with the voucher code. Mean while it not only destroy my 30/45 minutes of time also spoil the mood. 

Starter started with  mix seafood soup which was a disaster. Other items in starter were Chicken Reshmi Kebab / Chicken Tikka Kebab / Lahori Murgh Tikka or Sarson wali Mahi Tikka / Fish Tikka were average in quality.

Items in main Course were Fish Masala /Fish Amritsari / Fish Tikka Masala ( In deal it was writen Fish Tikka Butter Masala but it was not there in the menu) or Few dishes of Chicken. We had to choose one among all. Taste of the Pulao was good and have not tasted tested Dal Tadka. Beside this Green Salad, Nan / Rooti, Fresh Lime Sodas and ice cream.

I can't give more than 1.5 for their wonderful behavior and average  quality food.

The restaurant runs "one on one" offer on every Tuesday. Under which if you bill minimum ₹350 excluding the price of naan, roti, cold drink etc you get the 2nd plate of cheapest item free of cost.

But apart form these terms and conditions of the offer once you order items where you as a customer finds good deal or pocket friendly the staff formulates new conditions the moment you order or that particular item they say is not available.

After visiting the place I realized that these was the place belongs to red chopstick before... the same deco.... same ambience... and perhaps same furniture.... I liked it... feels nostalgic... these was the place where we used to visit with friends during college times..  today I gone there for having there sizzlers... I ordered 1. Mixed grilled sizzler.... there mixed grill seems little different... all the meats are good only the mutton was little smelly... overall tasted good....and 2. Blossom.... a mixed fruit mocktail with ice cream base... very good... taken home coolfi chicken tangri... very very good... recommended to all... minced chicken stuffed in chicken tangri... staffs are very friendly and well mannered.... pocket pinch was a little bit high....

This place was on my radar for quite some time. One being the font in which they write their name and two being the name. Always reminds me of oceans eleven(yes, we all have our quirks). To the more important issues at hand, namely the food. The spread has the usual tikka masala, reshmi butter masala and the usual bla bla...what caught my eye was lobster duck pork and lamb which to say is quite unusual and totally inviting to me. The pork ribs in barbeque sauce were a disappointment though. There was too much garlic in the sauce and there was much rib and almost no pork. Also lean meats is something they don't serve, so if you like lean red meat, stay out. Bought chello kababs, and it was not at all bad. The quantity was in plenty, quality impeccable and all in all nice. The trouble with something like chello kabab is that it comes with the constraint of too many multiplied meanings, which is why its difficult to judge it simply by taste. At 350/- plus taxes it is a pretty penny pinch. All my food was a takeaway, so didn't get to see the interiors of the place. Although, the management has tried to make the best out of space constraints. The pricing in the long range could be a factor as it is above average prices. But then, never send to know for whom the bell tolls. 
I would give this one an acquired taste restaurant simply for the fact that I couldn't love it truly, definitely couldn't hate it but will for sure try some more before judging it from my gastronomic pedestal of judgment or so to say. Hope you guys don't disappoint.

Small but sweet...the ambience puts you in the mood. Customer service is good. The American Chopsuey deserves a thumbs up. Fish and Chips is alright for a starter. Fish dishes need a better finesse. The chicken served was however well cooked but not up to the mark at all. Can do better. Best wishes for the new establishment.

Didn't feel like giving 1 even ! Negative ratings are required for such restaurants !
Was told to wait for 30 minutes due to the Puja rush for Chinese ! But after waiting for more than 1 hour we were served nothing !
We had to leave after that coz it was unbearable ! Horrible ! Won't go there anytime soon ! And the staff wasn't too cooperative ! They were clueless about what was happening ! So i suggest people to find someplace better or eat at home than eat here !

We went there yesterday i.e. Astami. We ordered Fish Tikka and Chicken Reshmi Kebab for the starters. The kebabs were served not too hot and without any chatni, sauce or lime. When we asked for the chatni they failed to serve one since it was not made. In the main course we had Plain / Butter Nun, Chicken Tikka Masala and Bhuna Mutton. Nuns were soft. But the mutton was a bit sweet. Chicken was so so. You don't have an option to choose from the desserts menu since it only contains Caramel Custard. But again it was unavailable. Bellagio also has a Chinese Menu which was not being served yesterday. So its hard to tell how hard it will be. Apart from all these, the interior is nice. You can visit once with your family but again it's a one time visit.

Went to this place for lunch on a Sunday during Durga Pujo, and we were highly disappointed. The things that we disliked:
1. The staff are untrained. They were always in a state of confusion about everything. Maybe, they were ill-trained to handle the rush during Durga Pujo.2. Sub-par food. The fried rice was like plain rice with a few pieces of chicken carelessly thrown in.
3. Serving was very delayed.
4. Quantity was very little.

The only thing I liked about the place was it's decor.

Secondly they recommended crispy chicken which was average, which is not the actual recipe of crispy chicken. Then we ordered Mixed Fried Rice which was good, also the chilli Lamb was good enough but not good compared to Chowman.
Ambience was good and clean, the staffs are not well trained made many mistakes during the serving of the main course. Needs a lot of improvement. But yes it was average, Chowman was much much better compared to this restaurant.

Interiors are great, and looks like a posh bar! The best thing about this restaurant is its variety! Tried the Pan Fried Chicken, Honk Kong fried rice, and Fish in Garlic Sauce! Quantity is great, and food was good as well. Only one thing, the food might be a little less spicy for everyone's taste! Overall cheap food, good quantity , good service!

The ambience was nice only the central tables were little dark to see the menu, the management can easily improve that. Prices are good i.r.t quantity, the best part is prices displayed in the menu are ALL INCLUSIVE, so no worries of taxes. Great job keep it up.

Bellagio maybe slightly away from the food hub, but it is definitely worth a visit, preferably even more than once.
The food is well made and the flavours are just right.
I would personally recommend bacon wrapped prawns. 
The music and lighting add to the ambience and has made the Bellagio experience even more special.

The food is as always great. The place is relatively small but has great lighting and interiors. Availability is a bit of a problem here, as i missed cuisines just because their dedicated chef was not there that day.

Bellagio maybe slightly away from the food hub, but it is definitely worth a visit, preferably even more than once.
The food is well made and the flavours are just right.
I would personally recommend bacon wrapped prawns. 
The music and lighting add to the ambience and has made the Bellagio experience even more special.

Not really up to the mark, which will tempt you to get in to this restaurant for the multi-cuisine purpose. The duck which I tasted was not that appealing, but the quantity and price will satisfy your pocket. With a nice ambiance, this restaurant must gear up on their food menu and quality in order to satiate the guests.

Went with a lot of expectations for the diverse menu at a cheap price that they offer. Very ordinary standard of food. The pork and duck dishes are just not up to the mark.Heard some good review on the prawn here.The only good thing is that they provide a cozy and comfortable ambiance for a cheap price range on dishes. The price is the winner.

The place is very classy & the atmosphere was awesome.....i went there with my friends....ordered mixed gravy noodles , mixed hakka noodles , chicken in oyster sauce ,  red chilly chicken & tuti-fruity ice-cream. The price was reasonable with the perfect quantity....i did not like the red chilly chicken as it tasted dull.....! Loved the dessert and the noodles...lots of chicken , prawn & eggs....! Pocket pinch :- Rs. 240 each.

In order to explore new food joints in jadavpur locality we dropped in here...as soon as we entered,the decor and ambience made us feel comfortable. We ordered chicken salad, mixed sizzler, panfried mixed noodles and garlic pork..it seemed like ages after which we were finally served! Taste was average.
But the service was terribly poor! We were three and the staff had no clue how many forks and spoons were to be provided! They were courteous though. Price was reasonable.
I wud rate them on:
Ambience: 3.5
Service: 1
Food: 4

The seafood dishes are quite amazing especially the prawn and lobster. The crispy chilli baby corn was really good too. Delivery service 👍 . 
Cons : 
1. The Thai fried rice was not spicy and tasted a bit bland and sticky.
2. The prices are a bit steep with non- satisfactory portions of the food.

Old name of this restaurant is 'red chopsticks'. They have changed the name but the menu remains same. I went there five times because  it's a pocket friendly and good restaurant. I have tried their noodles, chickens, duck, prwans and some soups. Location of this restaurant is good, just beside the road and decoration is average. All the staffs are good but they take a lot of time to serve the food which is a negative point. Otherwise it's ok. Thank you.

It was a sudden visit to this place but I would say worth a visit... Wide spread menu Chinese Indian and continental as well....
The first impression was nice as the man at gate was very good to us.. Ambience was perfect for a family restaurant and loved the wall decor with Buddha.. Very nice..
Coming on to the food we ordered Chinese ... Chicken Lollypop, Thai chicken fried rice and Mandarin fish.... The quality and the taste of the food was very decent and quantity is also good.. The lollypop was a bit hard bcz of the butter quoiting ... Rice was very tasty and also quality of the fish is very good... I would say please keep up this quality and the price range...

Coming on to the service and behaviour of the staffs were excellent.. They have been very decent and well behaved that many of the famous outlets should learn the customer service from them.. Most of the people like simple thing in good package ... This is one of them.. I recommend them strongly also I would love to visit again surly ... I would have rated 3.5 stars but .5 stars extra for the staff and Management.. And guess what I got 15% discount on my club solitaire card as well...

I went to this restaurant for the first time. The entrance was looking good but was not exactly like that as when u enter the hall you pass through an open kitchen door from which I received an awkward smell and also u can get the glance of the untidy kitchen.
The interior is very good, it is cozy too and the temperature was also ok.
The service is very slow and there is a lack of individual attention too. Crockery are so so.
Now as per food is concern I ordered for a simple chicken sweet corn soup and chello kebab. I got a smell in the soup and I think the chicken was not fresh. The kebab palate was the speciality of the day. It tested good but was not presented nicely which is not expected.
Overall I rated this place 2 in a scale of 5.

This place is beside the KPC hospital. The decor is nice and the menu holds a variety of choices. I ordered a Chicken Alfredo pasta which was delicious but my friend's tryst with the Chicken Rezala wasn't very enjoyable.  It was too bland. Soon, the couple seated next to us, complained of their average chello kebabs. I guess the Mughlai and Indian cuisine should not be your first choice here. However the prices are quite reasonable.  Overall it's a great place to hang out.

As we were looking for a place to eat around jadavpur, the enthusiastic security guard doubled up as their marketing guy and ushered us in. 
We had crispy fried babycorn which was pretty good. For mains we ordered a chicken sizzler and spaghetti bolognese. Now, I had mixed feelings about both these as though they didn't taste like how they should have, they were tasty nevertheless. The spaghetti was more like an indianized minced chicken in noodles. Maybe I was in a very good mood or very hungry, but yes I did enjoy the meal.

We went to this place today. Well, to begin with, though the building doesn't look that big from outside, it has enough space to accommodate a moderate reception space and a good staircase to take you to the first floor, which houses the main eatery. On entry, there was a feeling that having a bit of more lights around won't do much of a harm.Now, coming back to the main part - the food. Yes, to be honest, it is Good! I mean not exceptional, but really delicious. Quantity, yes on the fair side. Quality, you can bank upon. But yes, having a look at the price on the menu card, you might feel that it it is a tad on the higher side. Value for money, no I won't go with it!

But the main drawback, I feel about this restaurant is the behaviour of the managers and the attendants, though the waiters did their part well. But oh God! We had a forgettable time, dealing with the managers. We had actually brought the vouchers for this restaurant from Groupon and we were made to feel as if we were being served free of cost. I mean, come on man, this is not the way you deal with your customers. On entering we were given a 'warning' from the reception-guy, "Hey, if you want to avail Groupon vouchers, please don't come on the weekends (today being a Saturday), and on the weekdays, (when we are 'privileged' to avail Groupon vouchers), please turn up before 7:30 pm to avail the voucher". Let me point out here, we had gone there before 7:30 pm, at 7:26 pm for the records, and we were told this, in spite of the prior booking that we had made. These conditions are never mentioned in the details, when you buy the vouchers. Thus, you might feel like a sheep, if you happen to 'violate' any of these. (For the records, again, we were not allowed to avail the Groupon voucher, last week, when we had arrived at 8:30 pm. Funny really, in this world of great competition.

Again, after our dinner, when we were having a bit of gossip, before heading out of the restaurant, the manager intentionally asked us whether we would like to order anything more. Clearly, the waiters were doing the cleaning and swiping job then on our table. So it was a bit of an insult to just remind you that you have not given a single penny out here for the food that had been served. So you should not occupy the table a single minute more. Unprofessional to say the least!

So yes, to wind up things, if you want to enjoy good food, but can really ignore such nuisance from the attendants, you can surely head out here once, of course with the feeling that the price was a bit on the higher side.

Previously known as Red Chopstix, this newly named restaurant has nothing new to boast about. The menu boasts of a variety of cuisines, but the food is not quite upto the mark. The service is specially painfully slow. We had ordered for a crispy chicken but got served a crispy fish instead. The sizzler that we ordered was of a pretty neat portion and tasted good. The quality of food doesn't quite match the price. Nothing special to write about this place, a very regular fare restaurant just like most in this belt.

Good food at moderate price, that's what this place is all about. We ordered egg wrapped fried rice, chicken sides and momo on a rainy afternoon. They informed us that the delivery would take some time, say 1.5 hours. And they kept their promise to deliver within the stipulated time. Food quality was good, quantity was huge, packaging was also good. Overall, a nice experience.

A simple request to the management: please include the container and packaging charges while we order via Zomato.

Edit 12/07/2015: Ordered for Chicken Stroganoff. It was great but the quantity was small enough to keep me hungry :(

This restaurant was previously known as Chopstix.....nice ambience and a not so good service.About the food....everything I ordered was good except 'crab in oyster sauce'. The gravy was fine but the crab used in this preparation was in the refrigerator for many days...basically it wasn't fresh. The flesh inside the shell was dry and consuming it was not a very pleasant experience. And the price is a bit high...Except the crab part I really liked the restaurant.

First of all, very poor service. We've ordered an Italian sizzler among other dishes, it was served almost an hour later. And the place is quite overpriced compared to the amount. The food was just average. The most strange thing was that I've never seen a plate of sizzlers can actually burn your hands. Seriously. I still have a blister! Also, the people in there were quite unprofessional. Having so many great places to dine in around jadavpur, this place couldn't stand out in any way.

We had some horrible (if not worse) experience in this pathetic name of a restaurant. We went to have a good Chinese Lunch here.
The items we ordered were Tom Yum Soup, Golden Prawns, Veg Rice Noodles, Chicken in Oyster Sauce.
The Golden Fried Prawns were actually prawns coated with "Besan" and fried. It was pathetic and we could not more than 2-3 pieces.
The Chicken pieces were small (unlike any standard restaurant size), the gravy was BAD.

So, those who are planning to visit, I would suggest otherwise.

It took them hell of a lot of time to prepare the food. And then we found that the quantity was so less that we had to order double of what we had initially. The food wasn't great either despite the high cost. Needless to say, that was the my last visit to this shit place.

A nice new joint endorsing semi authentic Chinese food, but small kitchen leading to excess wait time and waiters need to be more smart and helpful.. I was a bit astonished when a senior waiter could not gauge the number of prawns in chili prawn. The drumsticks are a delight though..

Very poor when it concerns service.

Waiting for the starter for over an hour is not something joyful I guess. You are lucky enough to get a 1 out of 5. Buck up guys. Have you doped yourselves with opium ???

Went to this place again 2 days back and I have to say I am highly impressed by its rebranding to "Bellagio". Food quality, quantity & variety and speed of service has gone through immense improvement. So I am increasing the rating from 3.5/5 to 4/5.
Below is what I had felt when I had visited this place in its "Red Chopsticks" times.

Ambiance: Simple and impactful. Clean and cosy. I give it 3.5/5.
Food: Quantity is a bit low but quality is very good. I never knew that a simple paneer can taste so delicious. Go there early because they start running out of grocery during late hours. Bright side-- they don't serve stale items. They need to increase their veg menu, however. I give it 3.5/5.
Service: Very courteous, attentive and well behaved staff. Speed is slightly low. I give it 4/5.
Price: Slightly in the costlier side, especially the exotic items but worth it.
Overall I give it 3.5/5.

Decor- good. Goes with the name and creates a nice ambiance.

Service:- Take a lot of time, more than expected.

Food:- I had a lot of things out of which I had a sizzler , which did not taste like a sizzler at all. I had ordered a fried rice which was very dry and had less salt. Two chicken dishes I ordered were served cold. not even at room temperatur

I would not recommebd going to this place because the amount they charge is not less but they usually serve cold food.

20 stairs had to be climbed to get to the restaurant. the environment was not good, there were small candles glowing on every table but there was hardly any air conditioning so it created a very suffocative environment. some particular items on the menu was satisfying but the others are very disappointing. The dessert part on the menu was very short with only two items. The staff were somewhat inexperienced. There are other restaurants at Jaduvpur which are better than the Red Chopsticks, So I would not recommend this restaurant.

The food was brilliant! While we went for Thai food, it was unavailable. So we tried continental dishes and nothing disappointed us. The decor is wonderful, the atmosphere is cosy and the main courses are absolutely smashing. I'd recommend this place to everyone. Reasonable prices for outstanding food.

Another one in the city for its top-class sizzlers!!
Though the veg sizzler lacked broccolis and corn, (but later apologized by them) the service was decent and humble..
But it's definitely a good bet for Sizzlers and steaks rather than the Peter Cats and Marco Polos!!

Apart from the fact that we were made to wait a really long time, I'd say it was awesome. The duck there is amazing, so its a must. Pretty spacious and neatly decorated, Red Chopstix is right up there. Even the service was quite decent. Also, one should try out the seafood sizzlers they serve. They really sizzle. Only down for me was, the preparation time they took.

So, my Kolkata chapter concludes with 2 back to back visit to this mind boggling food joint. I really don't know why we were the only visitors in this place. No one else were there. Enough said, my oriental cravings are something that will remain unbridled. With a flurry of options, me and my friend zeroed down to Red Chopstix. I was hesitant at first, but what we got, was beyond expectations. The Chinese cuisine is really really good over here. It's the taste, I was actually longing for. I was so much delighted that I made the call, to visit it again the day after. Again we found the whole place was empty. But who cares? We again had a joyride through heavenly pieces of chicken drumsticks. Go for it guys. You won't be disappointed. The ambience adds up to the greatness of this place. There's a whole bunch of Oriental delicacies waiting just for you. :)

I had an overall good experience in this restaurant. Visited the place some months back with two friends for dinner. The staff were good and helpful. The place isn't much crowded,mostly thronged by small families out to dine-so we got a seat easily. Coming to the orders placed,we had crispy chilli chicken,mixed fried rice,veg fried rice,lamb in thai sauce and sweet lime sodas. Now the crispy chicken was good,the fried rice platters also had ample amount of rice and was of good taste. The lamb dish was really great,tender and tasty which is why i might visit this place again. The place is well furnished and decorated and the pocket pinch is on the lesser side.
As we were about to leave,it started raining heavily and the staff were courteous enough to come down and request us to stay back and wait for a while.
Overall good food,good place and good service :)

Visit to this place was more of a disappointment during a Durga Puja evening. This year during pandal hopping at Kolkata, we found this place open in Jadavpur, and had a decent review score in Zomato, so went in. 
The ambiance was quite nice and soft and well maintained. And that was the only good part. Food and service was a disaster.
Going by the trend of others, this place also had a separate festival menu, and there were not a lot of interesting things to eat.
We ordered chicken lolly pop, veg sweet corn soup, chilly chicken, sweet and sour chicken, chicken fried rice and mixed noodles, nothing extra ordinary.
Lolly pop and soup just met expectation. The chicken sides and rice noodles mains were not at all tasty, more blunt than even spicy.

I have been recently visiting this place and must admit that this place has slowly started to play with the tastebuds nicely. The food quality is damn good, a bit on the expensive side considering other choices nearby, but still very much edible ans comfortable as well as far as the sitting and dining conditions go. The chicken drumsticks is like heaven along with other food. The quantity is a bit on the lower side but the quality is unquestionble. A very good option if you want to go on a date. Highly recommended.

After visiting the restaurant today I had no choice but to change the rating from 3.5 to 4. The quality and taste of food has drastically improved and so did the service. 

Starting from the ambience of the restaurant to the music played everything was upto the mark and most importantly the courteousness of the staff was extremely amiable.

We ordered for barbeque pork, gamborith grilled prawns and mixed seafood sizzler. Each and every dish was superb. The pork was very tender and tasted excellant. The sizzler tasted better than that of peter cat and the continental prawn preparation was mouth watering. Overall the food made my day

i have visited here for over 30 times ....doing it since the last 1 and half years i guess ...... the thing that draws me to this restuarant is their chicken item named CHICKEN DRUMSTICKS ....... 
On my first visit to this restuarant , i took sizzler(which i didn't like that much) , mixed fried rice ,etc ....but drumstick(i didn't know about it at that time) was  referred to us by one of the restuarant persons ...... and that was it ...... from next time, i made sure that whenever i visit this place, drumstick is to be there for us in the menu we order ........ i haven't found it better in any other restuarant in kolkata ...... the chicken pieces are quite juicy and are very large in size ...... 6pieces for 280rs ...... heaven ..........  its just once we had a bad experience few months back when the chicken drumstick pieces were not fresh ....even other customers reported that and the restuarant manager came and apologized ...... recently again i went there .....i think its taste has changed a bit .... it was slightly better when i used to take it till last year ..... newayz its still the best in the city ...... :)
Other items are ok ...... not the best but not bad as well .....fairly priced i should say considering its location .......
A number of times i have seen the waiters are confused sometimes ..... u order something and they bring something else ...... :) ..... but they are very courteous in their behaviour .....

Went there to celebrate Mother's Day with my Ma, Mom-in-law, and of course my wife! The ambience was cozy and it was pretty full that evening, and we were told they are shortage on staff that day. 

We went for a soup, golden fried prawns for starters and ordered a chicken hakka, mixed fried rice, green chilly chicken and duck in chilli garlic sauce for main course. The starters were served pretty fast and we enjoyed them to the fullest.

The main course  arrived after 1 hr, as the staff was struggling to meet the customer needs with limited manpower. There were heated yelling from a table or two at the food being so late. But since we 4 are a good company, we didn't mind it much.

However, when the food arrived after so much delay. we were just blown over by the taste. A slight innovation like a 'green' chilli chicken was made to its perfection. It had flavors full of green chilli. The chicken hakka had generous shares of chicken and egg. Actually the noodles were minority in the plate with so much of chicken and eggs in the hakka. The fried rice was also in similar lines.
However, the deal clincher is the duck preparation. I savored it to the tee with the wonderfully blended garlic and chilli flavors. It was just mindblowing!
We had a glass of sweet lime in the middle while waiting for the main course, and it was made as perfect as possible.

I would want to praise the management for serving such tasty items amidst such chaos and manpower shortage. Kudos, and keep it up :)

The staffs are quite courteous and if you visit on fridays you will be able to dine in candlelight. Now as far as the food is concerned i was really surprised when i tasted their continental food. They are simply awesome. I never thought they can serve such nice roasts and sizzlers. Their Chinese is equally tasty.  However their rates are bit high. Apart from that I just love this place.

OLD REVIEWS
WARNING FOODIES. Last evening I went to that restaurant, just because I got a voucher from 'Club Solitaire'. Personally, I feel that again I'll not bring my rear end , near to this restaurant. Its pathetic.

FOODS: Frankly speaking not good at all. I tried Chinese dishes out there, they were neither dishes nor Chinese. The chef should go to Bar-B-Q or Tung fong or Red hot chilli pepper just to know what the hell Chinese dishes are!!!... even roadside shops are worth of their every penny regarding foods and price fixed for those stuffs. At least they know where to put oils and where to put spices. Amount of food is okay and it is enough for 2.  {rating: 2/5}

SERVICE: They took almost half an hour for a simple starter dish of baby-corn. And totally 1 hour for 1 Plate of Hakka Noodles and a chicken preparation as a side dish. Thank God that there was a wonderful companion along with me. Unless you need to wait like a beggar. Floor managers were not well responsive; one of them even started a quarrel with another party sitting next to us. There were hardly 2 other tables which had visitors and the time was around 8 PM.  Waiters forgot to serve the food. On asking them they replied that they had forgotten. They just pissed on my weekend evening. {rating: 0/5}

AMBIANCE: Well, ambiance and the decoration was good. 1.5 marks are just for this. But Kolkata has a whole lot of better examples. {rating: 3/5} 

PRICE: Why should I pay this much for tasteless bulky carbohydrates!!! I mean I go to  Mainland China, frequently. Yes, they are overpriced. But, still they sell something worth of those bucks. {Rating: 0.5/5}

This sucks a big time. (This is an Old Review From my old Zomato Account almost 1 yr ago. Let me know their current situation.)

I came up to this restaurant quite by chance. Upon entering over here, we got a nice feel of Chinese ambience with welcoming staffs. But the good thing ends just there. The food was not at all up to the mark, and believe me, there are plenty of better options available in the city. The waiters were too pushy and very disturbing at times, when they were repeatedly coming to serve the foods on our plates after every 2 minutes. I literally had to ask them not to disturb until we finish of the plate for the next servings. The pricing is really high compared to the quality of food provided.

The worst experience about red chopstix. first of all the spelling itself is not correct, the system is not up to the mark. whenever you visit to this horrible restaurant either lunch, dinner or any time before pleasing the order you have to kill your appetite first then only you can think to please your order. after pleasing the order nightmare starts. if you have hell lot of time, hell lot of money,or if you want to fall in sick then only you can go to this bloody restaurant. i don't even feel like calling its a restaurant. so all my friends be careful about this junk.

We went there in some food festival time. we ordered something and within a 2 mins they gave a different dish and tried to convince that its the same. Some senior staff came and said they will change the food. Again a different dish was offered and again surprisingly it is not the dish we ordered. After that they said to wait for 45 mins for our dish. So, basically they were trying to give us some food they mistakenly prepared for some other customer. We left.

Before this incident we went there 3 times and the food is not anything special

We went to Red chopstix for our regular lab party. We were a group of 15 people and were looking forward to have a nice evening. The ambiance was pretty good on the first floor and the seats were comfortable too. I was initially impressed. Then we ordered chicken drumsticks, which i heard is pretty famous there. Six large pieces of chicken legs came to our satisfaction. Till now everything was good , but then the horror part started. As everyone took a bite on drumsticks, almost everyone found out that chicken legs were not properly cooked and there were significant amount of blood inside. We complained to the manager and he agreed to refund that dish. Then there were sizzlers. Small amount of rice was ok but the chicken didn't tasted fresh. Hunan chicken and Shanghai chicken were again too less in quantity and didn't tasted that well as they promised but we gulped it down as we were too hungry. Same thing goes for tiger prawn too. Singapoor fried rice tasted good but the amount was too less for even one person considering its price. But later i found out that the prawns in fried rice were not fresh. Finally we ordered for 15 kesar pesta icecream and not to our surprise they disappointed us this time as well. After taking the order they came back with 5 icecream and said they dont have more than 5 kesar pesta and therefore replaced us with butter scotch icecream. We all were very unhappy after this experience and we would never visit Red Chopstix again. I would not even recommend anyone to visit there.

now the food., I found it very lightly taken..no great taste..no good quantity.no speciality simple thai and chinese..dishes...that too nt tasty..waste

not recommended if u are looking for tasty food.
giving 2 caise.it lacks basic criteria.i.e tasty food. yet with such no.of staffs...they should work on improvement...

This restaurant has opened last year and this was our second visit in last 6 months. Though we had to wait for 30 mins , it was worth waiting. We had ordered the Chefs Special Sizzler as per my daughters request. For our main course we asked the person taking the order, for suggestions. He suggested Chicken in Red Curry/Sauce, Chicken with mushrooms and Chefs special mixed noodles (gravy style) and off course fresh lime soda which is a favorite of the ladies in command. I will say that all the stuff we had were mind blowing and awesome. I have started advertising on their behalf :-) & will go there whenever we get a chance to eat outside. I would have rated them 5/5 but that waiting took off the 0.5 marks ! Maybe next time.

we were three people and ordered Italian sizzler, trifal fried rice and duck in chilly garlic sauce. duck preparation was less marinated and was not boneless also . at that cost it is better to be boneless. they charged two hundred and thirty five bucks without tax. but another two preparations were good. ambiance was also good.

We went to Red chopstix for our regular lab party. We were a group of 15 people and were looking forward to have a nice evening. The ambiance was pretty good on the first floor and the seats were comfortable too. I was initially impressed. Then we ordered chicken drumsticks, which i heard is pretty famous there. Six large pieces of chicken legs came to our satisfaction. Till now everything was good , but then the horror part started. As everyone took a bite on drumsticks, almost everyone found out that chicken legs were not properly cooked and there were significant amount of blood inside. We complained to the manager and he agreed to refund that dish. Then there were sizzlers. Small amount of rice was ok but the chicken didn't tasted fresh. Hunan chicken and Shanghai chicken were again too less in quantity and didn't tasted that well as they promised but we gulped it down as we were too hungry. Same thing goes for tiger prawn too. Singapoor fried rice tasted good but the amount was too less for even one person considering its price. But later i found out that the prawns in fried rice were not fresh. Finally we ordered for 15 kesar pesta icecream and not to our surprise they disappointed us this time as well. After taking the order they came back with 5 icecream and said they dont have more than 5 kesar pesta and therefore replaced us with butter scotch icecream. We all were very unhappy after this experience and we would never visit Red Chopstix again. I would not even recommend anyone to visit there.

Average size room wth a platform a foot high, having 16 tables...i think place s a lil bit crowded with tables, ths also makes da place noisy wth...people chatting all ovr...da place.

Service is exceptionally bad....it took 1 hr to serve only a few common items.

now the food., I found it very lightly taken..no great taste..no good quantity.no speciality simple thai and chinese..dishes...that too nt tasty..waste 
l
not recommended if u are looking for tasty food.
giving 2 caise.it lacks basic criteria.i.e tasty food. yet with such no.of staffs...they should work on improvement...

Most Third Class Restaurant ,    Very Highly Priced,     Food Quality is Horrible,   Un-Cooked Food with  No Taste, 
Very Very Poor Service, 
Best Advice - Never Vist this Red Choptixs Restaurant in Jadavpur beside KPC Hospital 
only if like to Donate your Money without tasting the Horrible Food , then its upto you.
I have visited on very recently ,  with my family to celebrate a special occation, spent Lot of Money, but not even 1 % satisfied with their Food quality, Service, compare to the Very High Price of Food.
Though I was a  Regular and Local Customer.
Think before you step in !!!!!!!!!!!!--- Thank you.

i like the ambience of this place,near jadavpur but is bit over priced as per the location.my only was during last durga,2012 on nabami with 3 friends of mine.we went for lunch and were impressed with the hospitality of their staff,and the red and black decor on the 1st site,which looked very elegant.
we ordered chicken drumstick as suggested by the waiter,this was one of their speciality and tasted OUTSTANDING! there were 6 large leg pieces,very correctly blended with spices and sauces.
next the sizzer served with small quantity of rice was also too good.
my friends preferred thai,and opted for thai red chicken with some nonveg fried rice.both tasted xcellent.
i persued my bf for checking out their italian pasta and opted for spagetti bolognaise,and i have to admit,that was LIP SMACKING!!
all that costed about 1100 and we were pretty happy.they also have a clean washroom both for men and women.
the cons-
they dont have a bar,
and the food is nice quality and quantity wise,but prices are on the higher side.
but overall its a nice place to dine in with family and friends :-)

I've been here a couple of times. But frankly this place does not deserve a second visit!

The ambiance is fine, the wall decor is worth mentioning but alas not the food! Especially the Chinese food. Its a major let down.

The last time I visited, it was just the two of us. We ordered for a Tomyam Soup, Chicken Cantonese Noodles & some Chicken Pepper Stick (suggested by the guy taking the orders). To start with, the soup was fine (too much of Lemon grass & much lesser Chicken). Then came the shocker !! Cantonese noodles, the noodles was under-prepared & smelly. To top it they have put such vegetables which are rarely heard of with noodles & again the Chicken was very less in quantity. The side dish was nothing great either & we had left half of it in the dish itself. To simply put, this place serves the worst Chinese food that I ever had. 

Warning -  Do not visit this place if you want to have Chinese food !!

I visited Red Chopstix last Sunday with other two at around 9pm. Food is very tasty and serving time is good. Good environment and nice staffs. The only thing is the items are really overpriced and the way the prices are mentioned in the menu (not numeric; in words), it's really confusing.

Another search for good Chinese food nearby.The location is very well-known to all as it is situated just 2 min walking distance from 8B bus stand in Jadavpur,beside KPC Medical College and Hospital but there is no parking place like many other restaurants in kolkata,and roadside parking is also risky as it is a strictly no parking area.But im not giving any negative mark for this,because this is a problem not created by them,its a problem of our unplanned old city.

The ambiance starts since your entry pushing the door, though the actual place is situated at the 1st floor.They decorated the roof of the staircase also which is really soothing.The restaurant is big with many sitting options,the walls are decorated with chinese statues,pictures,chinese lanterns and a big wooden sculpture of Gautam Buddha,the colour combination is typical of chinese restaurants,i.e red and black with dim light and soft instrumental in their music system.Over all a nice and soothing environment is created along with cosy sofas and chairs to make us relaxed and graceful.

We ordered chicken lemon coriander soup and chicken lolypop for starters from their huge menu book (yes,book..not menu card),the manager came himself to take order for starter and he also suggested us if we want any fish items.This approach made us satisfied and we felt homely.The soup was thick and hot and delightful in taste,the lolypops were also full of meat not to bony.Then for the main course we opted for mixed fried rice and duck in chilly garlic sause.The rice was nothing special rather i found it quiet bland in taste though my girl friend told it was not that bad.The duck item was pre decided even before we came here,and we didnt change our mind even after the manager's speech that it wont be boneless.Taste of the gravy was quiet delicious and little bit spicy just what we wanted,but in case of meat,im sure that there must be some pieces of duck with more meat than bones but unfortunately they didnt appear in our plate.Otherwise its a good experiment to taste.

Regarding service,Two things i have to mention before everything,first,they didnt provide any bone plate though we were eating a bony item,not every table needs this,but this is the individualistic approach which is must and its quiet embarrassing to store all left over bones in the main plate from which we are eating.
secondly,we always have to use our hand instead of spoon and fork when we are taking a bony item,but after we were over,when we asked for finger bowl,they said its not available in this restaurant,so we should go to the wash room to clean our hand,its truly annoying.Though we know most of the chinese dishes doesnt require hand wash as they can be taken easily by spoon and fork,but for the bony dish....again im telling about the personification of service or the individualistic approach...otherwise service was prompt.

We paid Rs 820/- for 2 (courtesy the duck dish,it costs 250/- a plate),so we can say about Rs 700 for 2 is the usual  costing here.

To sum it up,a mixed experience and a change of taste.

@Bhavesh Bhatia-if you want to write a review..better stick to the restaurant than writing nonsense about a hospital.The K.S Ray TB Hospital did not "only" treat TB.You use a much a greater word when you write about a hospital that has treated such a dreaded disease.Theres nothing creepy about eating next to a hospital gate...the food isnt served in the ward itself.
As far as the restaurant goes really beautiful ambience,friendly service and the food was pretty good.Definately not in the same league as the Chinese biggies of Kolkata foodwise but nevertheless its pretty good!!

now to the food...the quantity is decent...a bit overpriced(pocket pincher).....
word of advice
try the toasted chicken drumsticks!!!!!!!!
a 3.5/5 restaurant................

So here it goes.....

The Best part of this place is that its full of red and they do not have chop stick. Funny part is that steward has no idea about preparation of dishes.

Now lets talk about the food..

STARTERS:-      Very good n really tasty.( chicken lollipop & sesame crumb fried prawns )

SOUPS:-            Could have been better. (can't suggest the best one)

MAIN COURSE:- A mixed one. few dishes were really amazing where few were uncooked.
                          (chicken pepper stake, chicken red thai curry, crabs congeta, fishflorentine)

DESERT:-           They do not offer much items. better to have a cup of coffee outside rather
                           than trying mock tails. (do not drink)

SERVICE:-          Very slow, inexperience, noisy kitchen,staffs are not friendly at all.
                           (have patience)

LOCATION:-        On road, no parking space,busy traffic.

MY VIEW :-         Good starters, main course not that good, mock tails not to be ordered,
                           common washroom for customers and staffs, billing is too slow better
                           carry cash, preferred language is Bengali, u'll have hard time in explaining
                           them in english. prices are changed which is not updated over here.
I hope this review helped you.
cheers mate !

I was looking for a 0.5 while rating this restaurant!! I was shocked to eat the food!! The crunchy crispy chicken was harder than my shoe hide and stale. The capsicum garlic rice was tasted for half a spoon and then thrown away....I felt like chewing paddy!! It was as if they had fried some 2 days old leftover rice.......Shanghai chicken was clueless as to its origin.....rest I have even forgotten what I had ordered. Afterall one always tries to get past his nightmares.
