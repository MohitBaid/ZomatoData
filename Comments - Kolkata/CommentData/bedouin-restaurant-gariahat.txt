Loved the food and the ambience. Value for money, spot on. The quantity and quality complement eachother.  Loved the mixed fried rice, the drumbs of heaven and the chilli chicken. An ultimate chinese fantasy.....

The food tastes no good. The staff's are so not aware of the menu. I wish they did. The prices are quite reasonable. Located at the right place for a quick bite. Do improve your service as well as the taste of the food. Not at all happy!

We have visited the place on the day of Dashami... Quality of the food and the ambience were good... But the behaviour and the sarvice could be better...

Had a casual dine. Food is good but not great. There are lotta more better options around here. Took Mughlai dishes. Don‚Äôt have a great ideas about Chinese dishes. Prices are good. Real pocket friendly. That‚Äôs the best about this restaurant. Decorations are okay. Behaviours were okay.



Food- 6/10
Decor- 7/10

Had a roll from here by chance. Terrible in one word I must say. The filling was bad too. Felt like I was eating a leather roll soaked in oil. Sad , but it exists. I  hope they improve seriously.  Location is lovely. Food needs to move up in leaps and bounds, both quality and taste.

Tasted their Chinese Veg Thali.. The Thali consists of Veg Rice/Veg Chow(I opted for rice), 2 pcs of Veg Manchurian, 2pcs of Chilli Paneer, 1 Roti and 2 types of sauce. Overall good but the paneer was really disgusting.

This place serves chinese and mughlai delicacies which are very delicious and prices are reasonable. I tried the mutton biryani and chicken bharta which tasted really good. The ambience is also peaceful and outlet is quite big and spacious. The staff service is good. Would love to visit this place again.

Horrible experience !!
The food is very tasty though! But the food is poisonous...We all had food poisoning...Loosemotions and diarrhoea!! Severe stomach upset. Even the food which we packed for our home...We found a dead roasted baby cockroach there.
Never ever visit that place.

Had chicken roll. Very average. Not anything special. The Parantha was a bit stiff. Not comparable with best roll centres. They have varity of rolls including spl. Chicken roll. Not sure what is so special to cost Rs. 70 for one roll.

I don't know why this place at nandi street is'nt listed from a long time but this place has a nostalgic sense to me as I visited this place from my childhood.Don't know about the quality and taste of food but once this place according to me served one of the best classic kolkata biryani in town.Would definitely like to go back to this place and judge by myself if it is the same nowadays
