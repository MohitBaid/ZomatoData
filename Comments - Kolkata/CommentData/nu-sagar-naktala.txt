Cheap and tasty. Mutton biryani just for 90 bucks. Quantity wise also fine. Good enough for sudden biryani craving. Definitely giving competition to the other fast food centres in that area.

A small takeaway counter just 5 minutes from where I stay. They make great biriyani which is tasty,light and pocket friendly at the same time. The chicken chap, chicken biriyani and mutton biriyani are my favourites.

A sjop that serves decent biryani at afforable prices. The quality of the biryani is somewhat good and the pocket pinch is also not painful at all.

A small biryani takeaway counter.. It provides decent quality at a budget price. It was a welcome change as prior to this there was no biryani outlet in naktala area.. Now its a chance for the naktala people to savour the taste of the aromated rice with meat pieces without having to go far.

A small takeaway biriyani shop which came as a welcome change since we dont have any cheap & decent biriyani outlet in naktala area. Also the area in zomato for this outlet is wrongly showing as tollygunge but in fact this is located at opposite of nsc bose road petrol pump.

Till now i have only tried their chicken biriyani & chicken chap. The biriyani they serve is very light & not oily at all. They use rose syrup to flavour their biriyanis which many might not like but it works for me & gives a different taste. You will get a chicken/mutton piece along with a potato piece with the option of having an egg which would cost you rs.5 extra. Their chap is decent as well & at rs.40 they provide quality piece of chicken in not a very thick & cloggy gravy.
