A highly underrated restaurant in the city. Just try their drums of heaven, the slight crispy feeling coupled with the tenderness of those chicken leg pieces as you bite into them, will love your mouth flooded with flavours. If you want super crispy something for a starter, go for their crispy fried chilli chicken. They have one of the best hakka style noodle selections among Chinese restaurants. Please try it out. Among main chicken courses, their chicken in black bean sauce is just delicious. It's one of my favorite places where I take out my girl for occasional lunches. The ambience is very intimate and guarantees privacy especially on a weekday late lunch.

P.S : THEY HAVE THE FRIENDLIEST STAFF AMONG BUDGET SEGMENT RESTAURANTS IN THE CITY!

This restaurant is located at Purna Das Road in close proximity to Triangular Park. I had been there for Dinner on Astami night. The place was jam packed and they hardly took any time to serve the food. Quality was there was not any compromise  at all which really impressed us. Most of the items were decent enough and pricing was reasonable as well. Overall a decent experience and one which was highly satisfying as well.

We went during durga puja'17 and unlike many places where the puja menu is too expensive or the food not good enough, we were very satisfied with this place and it's food and price. The quality is pretty good, quantity is decent. We were a group of 10 and they joined 2 tables and arranged seating for us. Staff is cordial. Pan fried noodles, dry chilli prawn, pepper chicken, crispy baby chilli corn, paneer manchurian, veg friedrice, mixed fried rice, hot garlic chicken, devil's chicken - all taken together cost us about 3k, whick is pretty decent. Overall, good experience.

This small joint is close to Hindustan Park. When we entered into this joint, this joint was quite empty, I guess we were the only customers, but we liked the ambiance.¬†
We decided to opt for Thai section. We started with Prawn Tom Kha Soup, it was quite good in taste but they gave bit large ginger pieces in that, I would have preferred finely chopped one as it melts in your mouth easily.¬†
Then we had Chicken Jhad Thai and Kaeng Kiew Wan ( Spicey Green Curry) ... yes, we both liked these quite ¬†a lot both in terms of quality and quantity. Staffs are very cordial here. So yes, i would definitely love to come back here

I ordered for their...

‚ô° Chicken Chinese combo¬ª¬ª¬ª Very good... quite tummy filling one...

‚òÖ Peeper garlic chicken¬ª¬ª¬ª Good...

‚òÖ Triple chicken schezwan rice¬ª¬ª¬ª Quite tasty...

The reason behind my average rating is... they changed an extra 30 bucks for delivering the order at my doorstep over the bill shown in zomato... which I came to know from the person who came here to deliver the order... they called it as over distance change... so funny...

I and my friend went here on sashti evening that is on 7th of October 2016.The most worst restaurant I ever went to. First of all the staff were not at all courteous. Secondly they literally asked us to leave quickly while we were eating. And thirdly my friend fell sick the very next morning and still he is unwell. Don't know what they put in their food whatever it is must be very poisonous. If there were option for some negative rating I would had given that. Never visit this place if you r concerned with your health.

Location : Take a few steps along the lane just opposite 'Citi style' and walk a few minutes taking the first bilane you meet & you will find the bright red sign board with the name 'Hongkong Express'.
Ambience : It is decently decorated.The staffs are cordial and will guide you through the menu,if required.
Food : We've been here thrice.They offer a wide range of old school kolkata style indo-chinese dishes.The flavours and texture of the dishes are pretty awesome.The 'Drums of Heaven' were perfectly crunchy ,tossed with a dash of tangy sauce.
The mixed fried rice and Singaporean noodles come in fair quantities.The chicken and fish side dishes fills stomach and a foodie's heart,all without pinching the pocket hard ! üòä

I had a mood for thai, hence the order was CHICKEN PHAD THAI NOODLES and MINCED CHICKEN IN HOT BASIL. The food was all right , came hot in proper package and seemed value for money quantitively though the recipes could be improved to some more extent , to make them taste exquisite.

Honk Kong express is an old destination for Chinese lovers. The interior is shabby and needs renovation. But this place scores high in terms of service and food. The burnt ginger fried rice we tried was nicely prepared and was a complete different taste. The Rice was well cooked and full of chicken and shrimp. Though the Tsing hoi chicken, we took as a side dish, dint suit our palette. The chicken was juicy and tender, but a little bit sweetness would have enhanced the dish.

Instead of going to other Chinese Restaurant thought of having Dinner over here. We ordered Chicken Momo(8 pieces), though they said food will be served within 15mins, they took 45mins to serve Momo (we wanted it as a starter). Rest we ordered Chicken Chowmein, Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Cashew. The Food was neither that bad nor that good, it was Okay. Chowmein & Manchurian was tasty, but Chicken Cashew was not that good, it tasted same that of Chicken Manchurian with Gravy in it & Roasted Cashews added to it, actually it is supposed to be dry. The Level of Spice was absolutely alright, the way they promised. Yes, it's a Tax Free Restaurant

A decent Chinese eatery option which serves some quality food.

**Location**
Near the triangular park area on the side lanes of purna das road.

**Experience**
I really prefer Chinese cuisine and they totally make justice for the same. Had chicken gravy noodles my all time favorite with chilli Chicken dry simply loved it and appreciate them genuinely. Quality and taste was excellent and the best part was there is no after effect on my stomach after having so much. Light on stomach too. The sweet corn soup was thick and smooth too. Will surely come back for more. Pricing is reasonable too. Value for money. Quantity is worth for sharing between two people.

Ordered for home delivery from this restaurant using Zomato's online order feature. Hongkong Express, as the name suggests, is a casual restaurant that deals in Chinese and Thai cuisines. Located on Purna Das Road, this restaurant is quite popular in the locality and attracts descent amount of crowd.

Now to the food. I ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken in Chilli Oyster Sauce and Chicken Pepper Salt. Chicken Hakka Noodles were quite ordinary, just like any other budget friendly Chinese restaurants, tossed well, had all the necessary veggies and had descent chunks of chicken. Chicken Fried Rice was also sort of okay but the pieces of egg scrambles were very less. Chicken in Chilli Oyster Sauce was good, the gravy was prepared well and had veggies like mushroom and broccoli inside. Chicken Pepper Salt was also good, but don't expect wonders. Overall the food was just above average I would rate. Good thing, the food was pretty low on oil.

Pricing was standard one plate each item mentioned above gave us a bill of ‚Çπ785. Strangely they charged ‚Çπ25 for home delivery which was nowhere mentioned on Zomato's online ordering page (Zomato showed an amount of ‚Çπ760). I ordered well above their minimum delivery limit and my home is within their delivery range (otherwise why would they list that area as delivery area on Zomato if they are going to charge you extra). They also charged for containers which was ‚Çπ20 but the charge for delivery was nowhere mentioned even in the bill. I suspect that that amount went straight into the pocket of the delivery guy.

Quantity was just about okay for two persons if you order one plate of the item. Delivery time was clocked at 1hrs 15 minutes and there were no problems with finding address and anything like that. Packing was done really good, everything was packed in transparent plastic containers and not cheap cardboard boxes.

In a nutshell, descent restaurant. Good for casual tryouts but don't expect an authentic experience.

After watching Prakton at Priya I came here with a friend for dinner.It's a pocket size dynamite I must say.Place is small,minimally decorated.But they have really delicious oriental treats to offer and at a very nominal price.Lighting is very soothing inside and it's a neatly done place.

We ordered chicken sweet corn soups to start with followed by mixed panfried noodles and bang bang chicken.

Service was very efficient.They didn't make us wait long for food.Cleared the soup bowls immediately after we were done & mains were served within few minutes after it.

Now coming to the dishes I tasted----

Chicken sweet corn soup-Its a classic and Hongkong express didn't go wrong with it.It was hot,sweet,thick with ample amount of chicken and sweet corns.Every sip made me feel warm from within.Ultimate comfort food it was. :)

Mixed Panfried Noodles-This was a clear winner too.Slightly crisp noodles tossed in soya sauce and it was topped with ample amount of veggies(apart from usual ones there were zucchini,mushrooms,babycorns,cauliflowers) and proteins(chicken,prawn,pork).Portion was huge.It was very hearty and amazing in taste.Inspite of being ardent spicy flavour lover I felt that this dish was good enough on its own..didn't need any side dish to lift the subtle,delicate flavour profile in it.

Bang bang chicken-Even if the staple was good on its own this dish nonetheless was a great addition to it.We went for the dry version.This too was quite big portionwise.The chicken was crispy outside and so soft within.It was tossed in a spicy dark sauce with stirfried onions and capsicums in it.The combination spicy side dish and mild and sweet staple went very well together.

Will come back here soon sometime later to try the Thai cuisine. :)

A small eatery on the outskirts of Triangular Park, in Hindusthan Park Area. With proactive staff and cheap prices has a thing or two going about itself. But there isn't much of an interior. It's basically a house turned into a restaurant. Apart from some neatly placed tables & chair and the huge red wall outside with the sign board there isn't much of decor. The food is nice, but not exquisite. Even though it's a small eatery they have¬† a myriad of choices to offer, I'm yet to try their combos(looking forward eagerly). It's best if you are in the area and are looking some cheap eat.

A super affordable chinese restaurant. If you know the Raymond shop at Triangular Park, following that lane, walk up towards Hindustan Park and you'll find it on your right.
Went for the combo. That gives a starter, fried rice/noodles, chilli chicken, salad and coke. All that for 250 inclusive taxes. 
Surely recommended.

A decent Chinese eatery option which serves some quality food.

**Location**
Near the triangular park area on the side lanes of purna das road.

**Experience**
I really prefer Chinese cuisine and they totally make justice for the same. Had chicken gravy noodles my all time favorite with chilli Chicken dry simply loved it and appreciate them genuinely. Quality and taste was excellent and the best part was there is no after effect on my stomach after having so much. Light on stomach too. The sweet corn soup was thick and smooth too. Will surely come back for more. Pricing is reasonable too. Value for money. Quantity is worth for sharing between two people.

Ordered for home delivery from this restaurant using Zomato's online order feature. Hongkong Express, as the name suggests, is a casual restaurant that deals in Chinese and Thai cuisines. Located on Purna Das Road, this restaurant is quite popular in the locality and attracts descent amount of crowd.

Now to the food. I ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken in Chilli Oyster Sauce and Chicken Pepper Salt. Chicken Hakka Noodles were quite ordinary, just like any other budget friendly Chinese restaurants, tossed well, had all the necessary veggies and had descent chunks of chicken. Chicken Fried Rice was also sort of okay but the pieces of egg scrambles were very less. Chicken in Chilli Oyster Sauce was good, the gravy was prepared well and had veggies like mushroom and broccoli inside. Chicken Pepper Salt was also good, but don't expect wonders. Overall the food was just above average I would rate. Good thing, the food was pretty low on oil.

Pricing was standard one plate each item mentioned above gave us a bill of ‚Çπ785. Strangely they charged ‚Çπ25 for home delivery which was nowhere mentioned on Zomato's online ordering page (Zomato showed an amount of ‚Çπ760). I ordered well above their minimum delivery limit and my home is within their delivery range (otherwise why would they list that area as delivery area on Zomato if they are going to charge you extra). They also charged for containers which was ‚Çπ20 but the charge for delivery was nowhere mentioned even in the bill. I suspect that that amount went straight into the pocket of the delivery guy.

Quantity was just about okay for two persons if you order one plate of the item. Delivery time was clocked at 1hrs 15 minutes and there were no problems with finding address and anything like that. Packing was done really good, everything was packed in transparent plastic containers and not cheap cardboard boxes.

In a nutshell, descent restaurant. Good for casual tryouts but don't expect an authentic experience.

After watching Prakton at Priya I came here with a friend for dinner.It's a pocket size dynamite I must say.Place is small,minimally decorated.But they have really delicious oriental treats to offer and at a very nominal price.Lighting is very soothing inside and it's a neatly done place.

We ordered chicken sweet corn soups to start with followed by mixed panfried noodles and bang bang chicken.

Service was very efficient.They didn't make us wait long for food.Cleared the soup bowls immediately after we were done & mains were served within few minutes after it.

Now coming to the dishes I tasted----

Have been checking out this place for quite some time on Zomato. Finally dined here tonight! Located centrally at Triangular park, this is a quaint little place with minimalist d√©cor. Ordered :
‚Ä¢ Crispy chilli potatoes - the quantity was fabulous. And so was the taste with the perfect amount of crunch and flavour.
‚Ä¢ Triple Szechwan rice (chicken) - I was pretty delighted with this dish. I've never ever had something like this before. This was a combination of rice and soft and crispy noodles. Wow-ed by the taste!
‚Ä¢ Tsing Hoi chicken - This dish had a mild flavour and went very well with the rice. This too was delectably prepared.
So basically, I had a good time here. And the food is authentic and easy on the pocket. The service is prompt and my tummy is extremely happy at the moment! :D
Pocket pinch - 540. Oh, and VAT free! Yaaay. 
Definitely coming back again.

In the scorching heat and having a low budget for lunch at the same time being damn hungry while we were nearby this restaurant gave me the idea of giving this joint a shot as we were unable to walk any longer. This place seems to be bigger from outside but when me and friend entered it we found the place to be pretty small with 7 to 8 tables approximately. The place has no decor and is very simple with no fancy chairs or tables but quite clean and that is what matters. We quickly ordered chicken burnt ginger fried rice and tsing hoi chicken. I did not order anything more because of the terrible weather. The service time is fast and the staffs were efficient. The fried rice was very very light and had ample amount of chicken and egg but few tiny pieces of chicken were black in colour which was a turn off for me. The chicken tsing hoi was really wonderful in taste which was medium spicy with ample cubes of chicken. The chicken pieces were very tender and perfectly cooked and it was definitely fresh. Our total bill amount was rs 370 (no tax is charged separately). The quantity is good if not great and overall we were satisfied with our lunch. I will definitely come back to try other items.
P.s: the bathroom of the restaurant was not very clean.

Recently went to this restaurant. I immediately wanted to walk out after entering this place. So tiny and dull interiors. The entire restaurant was empty and only one waiter was sitting. However we thought of giving it a shot. We called for pan fried babycorn and it was quite good. Next we ordered a Thai papaya salad which was good too. Thai green curry was amazing but the rice portion they served was way too much for the portion of the curry they served. Also, the phad Thai noodles were a big disappointment. We ended up paying 700 for 6 dishes so it's quite affordable but I don't think I'll go back to this place only for Thai green curry.

As i sit to write this review , i am very confused. I liked the pan fried chilli fish and the pad Thai noodles a lot so much that we ordered another plate.
Rest everything we took was simply bad. Hunan prawns had scales. The golden fried baby corn was not fried properly. I could feel the semi fried batter in my mouth. The gravies were mostly tasteless.

Wanted to taste Thai at this place for a long time. After having local food at Thailand I always searched for some good place in my city where I can get that taste and aroma of those authentic Thai dishes. Hongkong Express somewhat fulfilled my expectations, hope to taste all their other Thai dishes as well sometime in near future. Yes, no price for guessing, we ordered Thai dishes at this place, like Jhad Thai Noodles, Kai Rue Moo Rue Koong Kratium Prik Thai and a Chinese dish - Chicken Taipei as starter. There was fresh lime soda along with these and couple of complementary dishes.

There is a narrow passage like 'Baranda' from where you can enjoy your food while watching the pedestrian. I ordered 'Pepper Garlic Chicken Sizzlers' which was so tasty.. I was disappointed with the sweet and sour chicken,which was too sweet. Otherwise price is reasonable,service is excellent and the staffs are well mannered and humble.

Today, for the first time I ordered food from HongKong Express online through zomato. I was happy with the delivery, the food was delivered within 45mins, though they charged Rs.25 as delivery charge. The minimum order price was written Rs.300 and my actual bill was Rs.535 (including packing charges), still they charged Rs.25 as delivery charge and I was not aware of that. Moving on, the food was satisfactory. We ordered Chicken Hakka Chow, Chicken Fried rice and Crispy Fried Chilli Chicken. The chow was really good with lots of fried chicken and egg. The fried rice was a total flop. It was blunt in taste, actually it was simply white rice and some fried chicken. The crispy fried chilli chicken was something new in taste. It was crispy and really spice. So, it was an average kind of experience.

It was Chaturthi, Durga Puja. Found this place in a time of great strife. There were 28 of us, it was past 4 pm, we were hungry like hell- it was then that Hongkong Express took us in.
The location is just behind Triangular Park, not that hard to spot at all. Nice cosy interiors, good seating, decent decor.¬†The menu was well loaded.¬†
We pretty much ordered bits of everything, so I will focus on those which I tasted personally.¬†
There was the Chicken Fried Rice and the Chicken Hakka Noodles which were good.¬†
I ordered a plate of Konjee Chicken, which turned out really crispy and nice and dry. Loved that one! Then there was also some Garlic Chicken which turned out really good as well. ¬†We actually ordered a second helping of that one.
The service was excellent, waiters very co-operating. The prices were quite easy on the wallet.¬†
That is a place I'd definitely go back for more.¬†
Would I recommend? For sure.

Never got a chance to write about this little place. This place holds a lot of good memories of mine. The place is small and we discovered it after a movie in Priya. They serve good food and at a very reasonable price. The 'tsing hoi chicken' is the best that i have had ever. After that day I have visited the place quite a lot of times and enjoyed all of those visits equally.

not to mention that it was my friends birthday alright now that i have mentioned it i can say that cash was not the problem, after a long search for good chinese joints in kolkata our fragile mind got titilated with hong kong express { names catchy } . so it took us some time to figure this place out not because it is located somewhere ¬†in the jungles but this generation is getting stupid not pointing fingers or anything .
so we reached he place and we were like ohk small but comfortable the waiter addressed us with a smile which was quite admirable and it was time to indulge . SO LET THE GAME BEGINS¬†
we ordered babycorn mushroom pepper salt which was heavenly small cute little mushrooms and babycorn fried with a batter so crisp that it would give kurkure the run for thier money ,sprinkled with garlic ¬†delicious and the quantity well quite a lot .¬†
next starter that we order was chilli prawn dry because we wanted to explore the spicy side of us and when it arrived on the table it was done and dusted in a ten minutes it was so good ..little sweet and spicy good .
time for some main course i heard a lot about their triple schezwan rice so it is basically layers of components one dish i.e bottom layer rice , middle layer crispy noodles and top ¬†layer hakka noodles . it was good not great but the side dish that we ordered it was a chicken dish called tsing hoi chicken , if u can pronounce this properly do write below i will say" thank you" ¬†{what you expected cash price }, so anyways it was amazing not to spicy not to mild ¬†seasoned to perfection little cashew crumbs which can be done away with , it was like sex in a bowl . not exaggerating at all .
final words people looking for a different chinese experience should go ahead and try this joint and it might make your day ..it made my day .

I ordered a plate of Konjee Chicken, which turned out really crispy and nice and dry. Loved that one! Then there was also some Garlic Chicken which turned out really good as well. ¬†We actually ordered a second helping of that one.
The service was excellent, waiters very co-operating. The prices were quite easy on the wallet.¬†
That is a place I'd definitely go back for more.¬†
Would I recommend? For sure.

Never got a chance to write about this little place. This place holds a lot of good memories of mine. The place is small and we discovered it after a movie in Priya. They serve good food and at a very reasonable price. The 'tsing hoi chicken' is the best that i have had ever. After that day I have visited the place quite a lot of times and enjoyed all of those visits equally.

not to mention that it was my friends birthday alright now that i have mentioned it i can say that cash was not the problem, after a long search for good chinese joints in kolkata our fragile mind got titilated with hong kong express { names catchy } . so it took us some time to figure this place out not because it is located somewhere ¬†in the jungles but this generation is getting stupid not pointing fingers or anything .
so we reached he place and we were like ohk small but comfortable the waiter addressed us with a smile which was quite admirable and it was time to indulge . SO LET THE GAME BEGINS¬†
we ordered babycorn mushroom pepper salt which was heavenly small cute little mushrooms and babycorn fried with a batter so crisp that it would give kurkure the run for thier money ,sprinkled with garlic ¬†delicious and the quantity well quite a lot .¬†
next starter that we order was chilli prawn dry because we wanted to explore the spicy side of us and when it arrived on the table it was done and dusted in a ten minutes it was so good ..little sweet and spicy good .
time for some main course i heard a lot about their triple schezwan rice so it is basically layers of components one dish i.e bottom layer rice , middle layer crispy noodles and top ¬†layer hakka noodles . it was good not great but the side dish that we ordered it was a chicken dish called tsing hoi chicken , if u can pronounce this properly do write below i will say" thank you" ¬†{what you expected cash price }, so anyways it was amazing not to spicy not to mild ¬†seasoned to perfection little cashew crumbs which can be done away with , it was like sex in a bowl . not exaggerating at all .
final words people looking for a different chinese experience should go ahead and try this joint and it might make your day ..it made my day .

The location given here on the maps might lead you looking for it for hours. A simple way to spot this small yet offering delicious food restaurant is by reaching triangular park. Its situated just behind the park, near kaya skin clinic or simaya.

Now about the food. We had ordered Pan fried chilli prawns and babycorn n mushroom pepper salt for starters. Perfect blend of spices or rather foodgasmic it was. Then for main course, go for triple schezwan rice. It has three layers, bottom one being Hakka noodles, topped with crispy noodles and then rice. It's the first time I had such a dish and it was amazing. Tsing hoi chicken was a perfect side dish to combine it with. 
The food comes in good quantity. A plate of all these was sufficient for three people without burning any hole in our pockets. 
Also, go for what the waiter suggests. He knows the food they offer too well and we were not at all disappointed.

PS: I forgot to take pictures of the dishes because we were too busy eating.

Went to Hongkong Express, on a lazy Saturday afternoon when I was out shopping in Gariahat.

Loced in Purna Das road, adjacent to the raymonds showroom, this is a place with minimum fuss on its decor/interiors. The place is small, like you would expect one pocket-friendly restaurant to be with ordinary seating arrangements, and ordinary ambiance.

Food ordered included:

1. Chicken Sweet-Corn soup : Good to taste, nor extremely creamy neither watery it was overall above average.

2. Chicken Fried Rice: Tasty, with sufficient chunks of chicken in it.
3. Cashew chicken with dry chillies : It was really a good one, and I so missed having this dish with a bottle of chilled beer¬†
4. Shredded Chilli Garlic Lamb : It was ordered dry, but they brought it in gravy, so they missed a point here. However the lamb was tender, nicely cooked and overall had a richness in it.

So I would suggest, if anyone is looking for a nice decent eatery which goes light on your purse its a good place to be in.

On a raing day I went to this restaurant with my partner. The location is a bit interior from the main road near Triangular Park, but we found it quite easily. The place is well organised. There was only one person who was taking the order and serving the dishes and he helped us to choose fantastic dishes. For starter we picked a Shredded Lamb dish from side dish section of the menu card and told to make it dry so that we could have it as a starter. The dish was mouth-watering and quantity wise also very good. After that, we ordered Chef's Choice Fried Rice, Prawn in Chilli Wine Sauce and Schezwan Prawn. Rice was a let down for us as there was nothing special in that even being Chef's Choice and it tasted actually very normal. But Prawn in Chilli Wine Sauce was just too good and it was very unique in taste. Schezwan Prawn was also tasty. Overall it was a good experience for us.

This is a relatively small outlet serving decent chinese food at an affordable rate.

The ambiance of the place is okay is all i would say with minimal decor and the seats are reasonably comfortable. The place was quite empty when we went and hence the service was not an issue. The staff was courteous and ready to accommodate our demands.

Now coming to the food. We ordered for chilly garlic noodles both veg and chicken. I liked the noodles though i would have preferred it a bit more spicy. We also ordered for the mandarin chicken which was again good. The babycorn was decent and the american corn veg was also not bad.

The bill was around 1400 for 4 of us and we really did eat a lot. So definitely this place is on the cheaper side.

All in all a good dining place. Go there only for the food and nothing else. Takeaway would be highly recommended.

Well It was well time spent ¬†here over dinner. I read and heard about this place a lot and finally decided to drop in there. Its in my neighborhood area and hence was much easier to drop in. Coming too the restaurant,¬†
Ambiance- 2.5/5. could have been much better and indeed it has the potential to be one of the best in the area.¬†
Food- 4.5/5. I ordered chicken taipei for starters and it was indeed good. The chicken inside was tender and moist. Good one to have an appetizer as! Then ordered the chilli garlic noodles with sweet and sour chicken with honey! Both of them tasted great and was perfectly cooked! Next was the turn for triple schezwan rice. Honestly speaking its one of the best experimental chinese food I have ever tasted! This I recommend as a must try one! This dish has noodles. fried rice and crispy noodles all combined in one. It was one heck of an experience having that. Its a must try for chinese lovers.You'll fall for it. (Try this dish extra spicy. It tastes even better and its not even fiery spicy. It tastes just perfect. :P :D)¬†

Service- 4.5/5. This people are very helpful out there.¬†

Overall its a must go chinese joint. ¬†You'll not regret it.

Located near Triangular Park, Hong Kong Express is hugely underrated. With great Chinese food, decent service and seating space guaranteed almost every time, this place really has the potential to compete with the bigger 'Chinese' players in the vicinity including Hatari.
They serve quickly even during rush weeks (visited during Durga Pujas) which is a big plus.
Last I went, they did not additional tax to the bill which is makes any hour a happy hour!

I went for a lunch on a weekday.Restaurant was quite empty but clean and peaceful.Ordered Chicken sweet corn soup,Salt pepper chicken(a bit spicy),Mixed fried rice and bang bang chicken(a must try). The staff was quite courteous and helpful. A must try among the south calcutta restaurants.The food is sensibly priced and portions served are wholesome and fulfilling for a Bengali stomach :-P..Overall the location is also quite convenient and it was a good experience.

A suitable place for nice family dinner with in the budget. Price is cheaper than many other equivalent chinese restaurents. Though chicken dishes have nil variation as same as most of the other chinese restaurents of the city but the food served was of good quality. Service is timely and the place has cordial atmosphere. Not suitable for party as there's crunch in spaces. But best for normal weekend dinner outing with your family within budget..

Not that this is a bad dining place, but it oozes potential to be right up there at the top! They have a nice list of offerings actually!
But yes, make sure you know what you are ordering as the waiters seem to be a little less knowledgeable.¬†
We ordered pan fried noodles which was filling and good, fish in chili wine sauce which tasted a little bland but the fish was very fresh and tasty. Pepper chicken sizzler was a let down as it tasted more or less like any other typical dry chicken preparation.¬†
The pricing just about manages to do justice to the food but for me, I would consider Hong Kong express only as a second fiddle to Hatari, which is a stone's throw away.

Hongkong Express has always been one of my all time go to restaurants. Being in the same area as the famous Hatari, this place attracts lesser customers because if its location. But standard wise, I feel this is much better than Hatari. Good, clean, tasty dishes, with generous portions, this place makes a great Chef's Hongkong Special Fried Rice. Non veg dishes are all decent, the standard Chinese food that most kolkatans appreciate. I liked their toffee walnut with vanilla icecream as well. Overall, value for money and a good choice to satiate the Chinese food pangs.

First lunch of 2015
On the occasion of new year, I chose this small and descent place to have the first lunch of the year. It can accommodate 30-40 people at a time. A nice restaurant with simple decor and a calm atmosphere. 
I was hungry and hence rushed straight to main course avoiding starters. Being confused of what to order as my girl friend wanted to try something new, we ordered Hunan chicken and chicken fried rice. Well I know that most of the foodies from zomato are familiar with Hunan chicken but as I was not, so I want to tell a few words about this thing to those who have not tried it yet. 
Trust me, this is worth a try. It was long and threaded chicken spiced moderately dipped in tangy gravy. It went very well with fried rice. The best part of this item was it's light yet tasty nature. I didn't feel any disturbance with my stomach after consuming this. We came out with a happy and mouthful experience. Definitely I will visit hong Kong express again and that time I will go for the starters and soup.
Best of luck for hong kong :)

Now,it might take a little time for you to get a place on a weekend but the staff are polite and ready to help. We sat in¬† the sitting area towards the outside and ordered for BBQ chicken and coke. It took quite some time to be served (precisely 15mins). But the food was really great. The BBQ sauce tasted perfect and the pieces were tender and well cooked. Some revellers might complain that the pieces are a bit small but the taste surely made up for it. I'm surely going back for more :)

No, this did not live up to my expectation. The waiters were very well behaved and the servings were generous but the outlet missed to impress in the most important category, the food. The food was below average. The Lung fung soup was a disaster, having an odd raw smell of boiled raw chicken. The egg droppings were uneven. The noodles was passable, and the chicken side dish, the name of which I cannot remember was truly not worth remembering, if not, just to avoid it next time. Will there be a next time? Let's see...

Went there in September end just at the peak of the pre-Puja rush in this marketplace of the city. The place came across as no-frills no thrills honest eating joint. Seating was comfortable with the temperature and AC just being perfect. Our order was taken fast and served quickly. We ordered (2/3) manchow soup and two varieties of mixed gravy noodles along with a soft-drink each. Soup was good chicken pieces being slightly rubbery though. Noodles was really nicely cooked with fresh vegetables,, soft chicken and tasty prawns. The best part was the bill which came to INR750 for 3 well fed people. This was my second visit and third one's definitely on the cards.

And what I tell you about the food...Superb will be an understatement. Every item was perfect left us with immense satisfaction. Fish is a must try. Must visit for chineese lovers. Price is reasonable considering the quality.

The food is great,the service extremely fast and the staff ever so helpful and efficient.  
Although the place has minimalistic interiors, this is a good place to enjoy great food at very reasonable rates!

Went there in September end just at the peak of the pre-Puja rush in this marketplace of the city. The place came across as no-frills no thrills honest eating joint. Seating was comfortable with the temperature and AC just being perfect. Our order was taken fast and served quickly. We ordered (2/3) manchow soup and two varieties of mixed gravy noodles along with a soft-drink each. Soup was good chicken pieces being slightly rubbery though. Noodles was really nicely cooked with fresh vegetables,, soft chicken and tasty prawns. The best part was the bill which came to INR750 for 3 well fed people. This was my second visit and third one's definitely on the cards.

After bwing totally disappointed from various chineese joints recently, I was dragged to this place by my bro.We got the food packed from here.Menu was Drums of heaven, Pan fried chilli fish, chicken in schezwan  and pepper, chicken with cashew and green chilli,chicken meifoon,chicken chilli garlic rice and chicken noodles. And what I tell you about the food...Superb will be an understatement. Every item was perfect left us with immense satisfaction. Fish is a must try. Must visit for chineese lovers. Price is reasonable considering the quality.

Compared to the other Chinese restaurants the food they serve at this place is very very less in quantity. Yesterday 2 of my friends and I had two Chicken Sweet Corn soups which was not at all sufficient for the 3 of us. But the price was the same, like any other Chinese restaurant. This place is ok, if u really want to experience this place ALONE.

Definitely one of "the" best Chinese joints in South kolkata.good food, nice ambience, pocket friendly. D pork items r mind blowing...highly recommend. Quite a cozy nook tucked in a serene locale. For first time goers the place may b a little complicated. D easiest landmark is it is just opposite to d entrance of traingular park gym.

First a huge amount of appreciation for Zomato for providing the 500/- gift voucher. Seriously being a North Calcuttan never would have found this awesome Chinese restaurant. Though it's very small in space, but decor is pleasant and makes it quite cozy. Seats are very lower there and makes it uncomfortable to sit.
However, coming to the food. Its just lip smacking. We started with a Chinese veg soup then a potato and a corn dish with hong Kong special fried rice and chicken Mandarin. Soup was warm and fresh filled with vegetables in good quantity. Rice was amazing with toasted cashew nuts in it. It made the taste different. Chicken and the veg dish was enough in quantity and very fresh and tasty. Though excessive flour batter made some pieces of chicken quite soggy. And the sweet lime soda on the sour side. On the whole today's lunch experience was just wonderful. This restaurant is very pocket friendly too.

One of the places serving"Indian" Chinese... Modest place, huge amount, taste quite ok (I never try to experiment with exotic named food in such places and stick to the basics). Have had food from here quite a few times be it a dine in, takeaway or a quick bite and have always enjoyed their food. But one thing is that they put too much coating on their chicken / prawn and that interferes with the taste... Pricing is a tad bit higher when compared to the quality of food...

Hong Kong Express.... Hmmm... well near my house and is mainly for delivery... have visited this place as well on a number of occasions.... the seating and the decor is average and the ac is nice and strong... the food here is very good and they give a good variety of dishes in sauces which normal places like these do not give.... for example they have the black bean sauce and the ginger sauce which is very uncommon in places such as these....

all in all i have tried many dishes from this place... from the spring rolls to the Manchurian to the Chinese salad to the coriander lemon soup to the burnt ginger fried rice.... everything is very very good and the taste is spot on....

this is an ideal place though a little on the steeper side compared to other Chinese place around this area, to call for food or to dine in.....

Now the the creme of it all... THE THAI!!!!! i am not a great Thai food enjoy-er per say but i know good food when i see it... and this place can give you that... the papaya salad or the green curry or the mushroom preparation.... this places Thai is just to die for... it can give benjarong a run for their money which is saying something.... 

the only problem i have with this place is the staff.... they are not that courteous or they don't have the whole idea of the menu or they are just plain lazy i don't know.... but this department lacks big big time in this place... like if you say you want a Manchurian with extra gravy he will simply tell you that it cant be done.... things like that... for me that's a downer...

another thing... if you calling for delivery they will take almost an hour to deliver but if you pick up the food or do a take away it will take like 15 to 20 mins for them to give you the food which is very weird.... i normally just take away the food cause does not make sense waiting for so long....

I recently visited this place near triangular park as I had just received a gift voucher from ZOMATO-for which I am thankful to them. But  as I sit down to write this review I really cannot find any substantial reason of liking it or going back ever there for that matter. Needless to say that my  excitement  to redeem my token of appreciation was doused badly by the person in the billing counter when he told with an apathetic face that they are not ‚Äúinformed ‚Äú about any such thing called vouchers!   Bummer ÔÅå  However, we somehow coaxed them to call up the helpline and finally got it sorted ‚Ä¶ but by then I was already quite annoyed and hardly bothered about the order ! We ordered a prawn pepper salt and a devils pork-portions though good the food tasted very ordinary and the pork was dry . Overall my experience with Hongkong express was far from good . P.S. the photos uploaded are the only good memories about this place !

First of all I would like to thank Zomato for gifting me a food voucher of Rs500 at Hong Kong Express. Initially I was very happy after getting the voucher but then I didn't know that this would turn out into a horror story! 
     It is 40 degrees in kolkata now and thus we decided for a home delivery . I called them about the redemption of Zomato voucher, they answered my call after calling them thrice and later when I called  to place my order they answered after 2 calls!! And that's how my horror story for the night began. I placed my order today at 8:15 pm and they said it would be delivered between 30-40 mins but we got the food at 9:15! 
Things ordered------------
1) 1 burnt ginger Veg Fried Rice
2) 1 burnt ginger Chicken Fried Rice
3) 1 chicken with exotic vegetables ( I wanted to order Sliced Lamb hunan style but they told that lamb is not available)
4) 1 devil's Own Chicken 
    I thought that now, we are going to experience some good Chinese food but they had decided to ruin our dinner I guess!! The food looked yummy! The quantity was pretty good!! But the taste! :( It was horrible , utter rubbish it was. There was very little amount of Chicken in the burnt ginger chicken fried rice and was not at all tasty. The taste was also not good , pretty ordinary or rather 'below average' will be the correct phrase to describe it. Chicken with exotic vegetables was average and in the devil's own chicken the hotness quotient was so high that it drowned any taste , that the gravy may have had. Utter disappointment!! Ruined my dinner!!

Located opposite Triangular Park, this place is really great for takeaways! I have only tried their Thai menu and I loved it. A very price-friendly place, and they usually deliver quickly around Hindusthan Park area. Now coming to food, I love both their Green Curry and Red Curry and the 1st time I had tried them, I had done so with no expectation. But was extremely pleased that they tasted so good. Lamb Patani is my second favorite, however it is not always available. But they make it quite well - stir fried lambs. There is one more dish I enjoy - Minced Chicken in basil and goes very well with plain rice like all the rest. Nlow what I do not like are the noodles and rice. I had ordered them couple of times- the phad thai is nowhere near the authentic version, even the thai rice felt a little overdose of veges. These days I enjoy ordering the sides only. Over-all I am very satisfied with this place and get food very often!

Visited hongkong express with my sister and niece..read its good review in zomato,so decided to visit it.
We reached there around 9.10pm,but to our surprise we didn't have to wait and we got a place.
The decor was ok.
For starters we ordered barbecue chicken and drums of heaven,both were yummy..then we ordered chicken hakka noodles and szchewan prawns.The noodles were a bit of disappointment,it was very ordinary,even szchewan prawns was ok, but the quality of prawns were good.
They could not serve us any desert since no ice cream was available.
But the place is very pocket friendly..and the service was quite prompt..Thus the overall experience was good..

We are regularly ordering food from HK Express, but the last time was a disaster. Extremely spicy food after specifying that little spice, so much so that it had to be sent back and remade. Then the main course which had been told to be STRICTLY vegetarian turned out to be non-veg and contained several pieces of chicken/meat. And to top it all, they were least bit apologetic.

Have been to this restaurant quite often.. and I've never had anything which was something that I can really complain about..
However, once I had lung fung soup, which was, rather is the only dish I didn't like that much,  as compared to the other dishes..
Konjee crispy lamb, triple schezwan rice, lamb/chicken in Hunan and honking style, Singapore noodles are among the dishes that are my all time favorite..
The staff is also quite well mannered and very prompt in service..
In all, a great place to dine in, would have rated as at pointer, only if they could have served all day and not shut down between (3-7)p.m

Thai Items prepared here are also Delicious .... Patani is what i loved here !! 

The only place where i can't mark good about this place is the way they prepare Soup.... Its different but maximum soups here are clear and taste almost the same ..... 

But apart from that this restaurant is really a very good place to try out Chinese and Thai !!

Was wondering where to go for a reasonably priced chinese meal, in South Kolkata. Zoomed in, on this restaurant after browsing through zomato. The encouraging reviews helped making up my mind.

Unfortunately, wasn't as hungry, and we were just two, so couldn't try out too many dishes. Also on the evening they were out of stock on pork & lamb,  which was a huge disappointment, as most reviewers were raving of the pork.

We tried the mixed pan fried noodles & prawns in garlic sauce.

Good portions, we couldn't finish the noodles! The prawns were batter fried, which I didn't like, however, the garlic sauce did please my taste buds. I quite enjoyed their pan fried noodles, which was filling as earlier mentioned. 

Ambience - your neighbourhood family dining room, serving thai/chinese food.

The place is simply awesome though might be a little hard to find  for people who are not accustomed to the area.... The lung fung soup was just great and so was the BBQ chicken..... The mixed hakka noodles is simply a treat to the taste buds and so was the konjee crispy lamb.... Darshan with ice cream was no less tasty in the dessert section.

Pros: 1. Awesome quality and sumptious quantity in the dishes.
          2. Real fast service.
          3. Nice ambiance which adds to the beauty of the place.
          4. Moderately priced (With no extra Vat which is already included in the price in the menu card).

Cons:1. Staff is a bit less than 100% professional.

This oddly named restaurant is a hidden gem in the Rashbehari - Gariahat area. Located a stones throw away from the lake end of Sarat Bose Road, with all its fancy establishments, this place just behind Triangular Park on Purna Das Road can compete with any of them. This is low budget foodie paradise. We chose this place for lunch on Panchami. The low number of tables notwithstanding,  we found ample seats. The service was courteous and quick. The crockery specially attracted my attention. All original Bone china plates and salvers, it was the works. The sophisticated ambiance, though nice, could be revamped a bit more to include the far eastern element. Price is a tad bit higher than you'd expect on most dishes and unbelievable on a few. Choose wisely. Finally, although I appreciate a toilet on the premises, you are inviting my wrath with an unclean, ill equipped one.

The menu here is long with specific sections devoted to cantonese and hakka dishes. The veg, non veg and sizzler and fish/prawn sections are incredulously priced. Stick to the lamb,pork and chicken which give you plenty of options at prevailing prices. The soups are also worth a try. There's a host of unique authentic chinese dishes. I liked the fact that they've included a large number of dishes that are their personal take on a more popular dish. They've twisted the flavour and named it in funny monikers. Ergo, the bang bang chicken. The 3 desserts at the end look out of place. :)
The thing to look out for is the Thai part of the menu. It has it's own starter, main course and soups section. Though priced quite high, they are still delicasies which will cost you a fortune at a posher restaurant. I'd suggest buying at least a dish for sampling.

We had the predictable Garlic Chicken which though delicious, tasted just as it should. The Shredded Chicken Mushroom with Chilli Garlic had a more adventurous taste. With the tangy garlic tinged chicken providing a delicate balance with the sweet prawns. The chilli kept the show running. The two noodles, namely the common Veg Chilli Garlic Noodle with a beautiful dark rolling gravy and the Chicken Pan Fried Cantonese Noodles were both sizzlingly great. The latter having a delectable mix of spicy dice cut vegetables out of which the capsicum held pride of place. 
The Chicken Hakka Special Rice was a crossover between a polao and a biryani with peas and tomatoes. It had a smooth feel with just a dash of oil but I felt this one could have spent a few minutes more in the oven. 

or you could just read that the food was entirely smashing. :D

Chakraborty Tips : 
 These people take the saving electricity campaign a bit too seriously. The lighting is a bit too muted. Try  almost non existent. Be ready to peer into your dish.

The sophisticated ambiance, though nice, could be revamped a bit more to include the far eastern element. Price is a tad bit higher than you'd expect on most dishes and unbelievable on a few. Choose wisely. Finally, although I appreciate a toilet on the premises, you are inviting my wrath with an unclean, ill equipped one.

The menu here is long with specific sections devoted to cantonese and hakka dishes. The veg, non veg and sizzler and fish/prawn sections are incredulously priced. Stick to the lamb,pork and chicken which give you plenty of options at prevailing prices. The soups are also worth a try. There's a host of unique authentic chinese dishes. I liked the fact that they've included a large number of dishes that are their personal take on a more popular dish. They've twisted the flavour and named it in funny monikers. Ergo, the bang bang chicken. The 3 desserts at the end look out of place. :)
The thing to look out for is the Thai part of the menu. It has it's own starter, main course and soups section. Though priced quite high, they are still delicasies which will cost you a fortune at a posher restaurant. I'd suggest buying at least a dish for sampling.

We had the predictable Garlic Chicken which though delicious, tasted just as it should. The Shredded Chicken Mushroom with Chilli Garlic had a more adventurous taste. With the tangy garlic tinged chicken providing a delicate balance with the sweet prawns. The chilli kept the show running. The two noodles, namely the common Veg Chilli Garlic Noodle with a beautiful dark rolling gravy and the Chicken Pan Fried Cantonese Noodles were both sizzlingly great. The latter having a delectable mix of spicy dice cut vegetables out of which the capsicum held pride of place. 
The Chicken Hakka Special Rice was a crossover between a polao and a biryani with peas and tomatoes. It had a smooth feel with just a dash of oil but I felt this one could have spent a few minutes more in the oven. 

or you could just read that the food was entirely smashing. :D

Chakraborty Tips : 
 These people take the saving electricity campaign a bit too seriously. The lighting is a bit too muted. Try  almost non existent. Be ready to peer into your dish.

The place is pretty small .. Visited during pujas.. had to wait for 20 mins.. ordered food and got the delivery in 5 mins...
Horrible food .. Food was served cold... chicken had a weird taste as if some medicine was put to it .. Noodles was bland with inappropriate addition of salt  n  was Smelling .. Only relief waS fish szechuan which was not spicy but edible in comparison to the rest of the items...

home delivery calls ate seldom responded to. so i dexides to walk to the place. food took 30 mins to deliver for takeaway. forgot to check the bill items...maybe ny fault as i trusted things to be in order. alas, the fried rices were not delivered the lamb turned out into chicken the fish was mostly batter! upon calling them and finally getting through my protest was met with rude and unhospitable behaviour. no efforts were even made to apologise let alone take a corrective stance. anyways....i guess this is what chinese food and customer orientation is in kolkata nukkad eateries. very disheartening exoerience. its a STAUNCH NO !!!!

Not for the ambience, but just for the food that I like visiting this place. I have not tasted their Thai dishes but reading the reviews, I definitely know I want to try them. On more than one occassion and over a few home deliveries, we have tried the Chinese chopsuey, double fried pork, hot garlic chicken, pan fried fish, hong kong special fried rice, mixed fried rice, ginger rice, hot and sour soup, pan fried noodles, so on and so forth. Except for the hong kong fried rice which was more like pulao, everything else till date has been extremely praiseworthy. They serve huge portions, making every dish win a well worth quality-quantity-taste equilibrium. 
My reservations with the ambience do not cater to their cleanliness or so. On that note, even their washroom is really well maintained. But I absolutely loathe their seating, it is really uncomfortable for sharing a happy, comfortable meal. A quick grab is ofcourse fine. Hong Kong Express has a courteous home delivery service and delivers well within time. Located in the budding restaurant zone of Triangular Park, Hong Kong Express stands a promising future. I love the pork here, so the management better continue the service the way it is. :)

I always order thai takeaway from Hong Kong Express. They deliver free from Hindusthan Park to Jodhpur Park while many other restaurants in the area do not. Once we called them around 11 (closing time being mentioned as 10.30pm) and they gladly delivered food for 8 hungry people... what's not to love? I do not care much about the chinese menu but their Thai dishes are excellent. We have a staple order of Khaophad (the one with prawns and chicken is the best) with a red or green curry and a lamb patani, which is stir fired shredded lamb. The patani is so good, tastes great with just plain rice. The prawn red curry is delicious, the chicken and lamb red curries are also great, the green curry is not bad but better to order the chicken or lamb versions. I have also had the tomyum soup which is nice enough and the one fish dish on the menu which is quite good, some more fish and seafood dishes would be a welcome addition since Thai is all about the seafood. But one complain is that we keep asking for some fish sauce to be sent with the order but never get it. Also it is a bit expensive for a takeaway meal, for two people the bill would come to around Rs 600. 4.5 stars to Hong Kong Express for their Thai food.

Hong Kong express has been right next to my place for several years but I didn't have the courage to try it out. I ordered a bunch of stuff and well, I was quite surprised. First of all, it is extremely affordable. Secondly, food was YUMMY. (The noodles could've been much better. They were very dry) 
Other than that, GREAT place if you're looking to fill your stomach and still have money left in your wallet.

Menu Ordered:
Tom Yum soup Veg (made 1/2)
Paneer Manchurian Dry (starter)
Chef Special Hawaiian Egg fride rice
& Kar rue mue rue chicken (hopefully spelled correct)

The soup was excellent. Spicy and lemonish flavoured as it should be. But quantity was just ok. Manageble for just two people. 

Paneer manchurian wasn'tas crispy as it should have been. 

The hawaiian rice was good. Tasted different with pineapple and pepper blending nicely with each other. Sweet and hot at d same time.

The ......chickn was nothing but a replica if any other chicken manchurian. It had the same flavours as in tom yam.

Service quality was below sub standard. Ambience is not something u can find there. So forget it. 

Try out once widout any hope. U may...may like it...As far as I am concerned m just experimenting and m done. 

Rate: 2.5

I had wanted to try this place out ever since it changed its name from Pakwan to HongKong Express and then when Zomato sent me a voucher for the place which was valid till 31st August I was determined to go. But owing to a very hectic work schedule, was not able to make any time to go out for dinner. But last night when a late evening meeting got cancelled, I immediately called up one friend, and made plans to have dinner at Hong Kong Express.

When I reached, I was a little apprehensive since I could not call up earlier to inform them I have a voucher. We found the place to be eerily empty. We were the only diners. The waiter took our voucher smilingly and directed us to a seat. The decor is simple and nicely done. I do wish that they had more comfortable chairs.I am going to deduct one point for their uncomfortable chairs

Now coming to the food. I have been having Chinese on a regular basis and was really glad to find that this place served Thai food as well. We ordered the Kai Roo Mue Roo Chicken and the KhaoPhad Chicken. Both the dishes were excellent. The proportion of both the dishes were more than adequate for both of us. The Khaophad chicken was spicy, falvourful and the aroma of lemongrass was just right, not overwhelming the other flavours and ingredients of the the rice. The Kai Roo Mue Chicken with peppercorn and garlic reminded me why I had started liking Thai cuisine way back when it was introduced in the city. Since both the dishes was spicy in true Thai signature style we decided to order two separate dessert items. The Darsaan and the Walnut Toffee with icecream. The Walnut Toffee with icecream was strictly okay, both taste-wise and proportion-wise. I have infact had better.The Darsaan was something else. Proportion wise one plate can easily be shared between three people. In general I am not a very big fan of Darsaan since the fall under the category of sticky sweets, but this one is definitely worth a try.

Thank you Zomato for sending voucher to one really nice restaurants in the city.  

Also I would request everyone who reads this review to pay a visit to Hong Kong Express. It would a shame if such a nice restaurant has to shut down for lack of customers.

Location: Well, it might seem difficult a bit for the newbies (like me) to find this place. The reason is because the phone number given in Zomato was wrong maybe missappropriation/mistyping may have happened. Well, i had been searching the whole Purna Das road and after asking couple of people(local people) i reached to this place 'Hong kong express' it was located in a lane when you go straight from Baati Chokha towards the Gariahat main road on the left and side you discover this lovely 'Hong Kong Express'. I visited this place with my family. They serve Chinese cuisines. i am really thankful to chef 'Milan Bhagat' for preparing such wonderful dishes. Looking at the front page of the menu, it seems like its a composition of some pictures cut copy paste from different places. Anyways, must say a brilliant idea and a good composition.

Nevertheless,
Coming to the pros and cons of this place: -
=====
Pros

1) Staffs out here are very polite, well mannered and properly trained. Very cooperative. They are very friendly as they guided me in trying their favourite dishes which turned out to be simply 'Outstanding'. 
2) Prices are very reasonable. 
3) Delicious and quality food at reasonable prices = Hong Kong express.
4) Ambience is super simple. Not at all noisy. Simple with little decorations. Not too crowded. No Tv music or any type of chaos. 
5) Service totally up to the mark with proper serving and no compromise even at the closure of the session. Service is quick and prompt.
6) Place can easily accomodate 30-35 people. 
7) What i noticed in this place was even at the closure of the day, they had kept all the tables cleaned(using colin sorry for noticing too much :P) and maintained after shuttering it off. 
8) At some places, i ask for 'normal regular water' they do not provide it cold even if asked for it or with no ice. But here, there is a twist. They provide you with cold regular water. So no worries. 
9) Located at a posh place, local people are very much aware of this place. 
10) Quantity of the food is up to the mark.
11) What makes this place perfect is its simple and easy menu/a la carte which clearly talks about each and every item.

Cons
1) A simple instrumental music could have got the fire heated up.¬†
=====

Food description: Coming to the starters and soups, we had ordered lemon coriander soup which had turned out to be unique and superb and chicken tai pai which was outstanding and sizzling, it had the crisp and the tenderness also, Superb composition. I had ordered tsing hoi chicken, chicken fried rice and chilly garlic noodles all were perfectly made without any flaws. I would like to suggest that ask the staffs before ordering something new, they will definitely guide you better. 

Superb Experience. Planning to revisit it soon. :)

We have ordered almost all the chicken starters and main course and they were about average. Very spicy at times and not all that desirable. The fried rice and noodles were a bit too bland for my taste. All in all, a decent meal experience but nothing worth flaunting.

After finding a long queue at a nearby popular Chinese restaurant on Shasti evening, we decided to give it a try. This place was moderately crowded, and we got a table in just 5mins. After hours of pandal hopping we were very hungry and tired. So the obvious reflex was to order in excess. Wish i had known their portion sizes are pretty good and filling. We had ordered szechuan noodles,mixed fried rice and two chicken prepp. I would say quality was quite good as per puja standards. Prices are not too high,that's the biggest relief. It can always be given a try!

After reading a few reviews on this restaurant by my fellow Zomato users, I created a list of must-haves at this restaurant. Thanks to my fellow users, and thanks to Zomato for the voucher.

Food was served within 10 mins of order.

We had :  

1) Konjee Lamb- Crispy and salty pieces of lamb. From the taste, its difficult to tell if its a lamb or not.   

2) Crispy chicken- Dry and crispy pieces of chicken, well cooked, COULD HAVE BEEN better by adding stir fried Chinese grass, onions and capsicums.

3) Triple Schezwan Rice- Mixture of crispy noodles, spaghetti and rice with right amounts of spices. Innovative. Loved it.

4) Hong-Kong Special Rice- Well cooked rice with cashews and spices, very tasty.  

5) Shredded Chicken in Pineapple Juice- The pieces of chicken were chopped very nicely, tasted good.

6) Darsaan- A good way to end it.

Complimentary Wanton salad was delicious. Staffs are not well trained but they are polite and friendly.

 Overall, this place serves rather good food at reasonable prices, and is conveniently located for South Calcuttans.

While I lived in Calcutta, this place was right next to my home and hence most of our home deliveries were from this place. The food was just about decent but not quite up to the mark. And  this comes after having food delivered from the place about 30-40 times. 

We have ordered almost   all the chicken starters and main course and they were about average. Very spicy at times and not all that desirable. The fried rice and noodles were a bit too bland for my taste (i like them spicy). All in all, a decent meal experience but nothing worth flaunting.

This restaurant turned out to be surprisingly good, and has a very neat outlook to it, which makes you comfortable and cozy. Service was spot-on, and so was the quality of the food. The overall experience was extremely satisfying. I believe they also provide home delivery services apart from the dine-in facilities.

Absolutely Delightful !

LOCATION : Get off at Trangular Park bus stop and follow the lane starting with the 'Adi Dhakeswari Bastralaya'.

Chinese/Thai was never this good!! Ordered the Triple Mixed Schezwan Rice with Konjee Crispy Lamb and Chicken Chilli Garlic Fried Rice.The Quantity was satisfactory for every dish.What struck me the most was the crispness and the spice factor of the Schezwan rice.Yup you read it right ! Mixed with noodles and what not ,it was such an amusing amalgamation. But the highlight of the evening was the Konjee Lamb, crispy and juicy. Could eat that all day long. Even the Chicken Fried Rice was a class apart because there was no sign of the word "fried" in it. It was so light and so non oily. Yet it was best Chicken fried rice that i've ever tasted.

AMBIANCE : A very subtle approach with white and mauve colours. Seats are purple. The waiters are extremely polite and responsive. Especially the fair,short haired guy. He placed the contents of the meals from the bowls onto our plates without us even calling him ! Waiting time after ordering was around 7-10 minutes.

FINAL CONCLUSION : Totally worth it. For people like me who are not a fan of chinese/Thai preparations, you might as well change your mind after the meal is over or in my case during the meal. Unique and authentic dishes that render you speechless. Thanks to "ZOMATO" my bill was halved. But even if i had to shell out the entire amount , I'd gladly do so. 

I'm going for a 5 out of 5 because every aspect of the experience was just delightful. They'll be seeing a lot more of me from now on.

The trend of delivery and takeaways have finally taken over. Till about a year back, a delivery seemed like too much to expect. With places like hong kong express, its such a relief to be able to enjoy thai food at home (considering there were other chinese take aways around). This is pretty much our only resort when there are guests over or when any of us lazy to go out yet want good food. Very reasonably priced, almost 80% of their menu is prepared well.

My favourites from their menu would be:
1. Crispy konjee lamb (shredded chunks of lamb, lots of spices, fried yet not too oily)
2. Chicken lollipops. (lots of meat and less of batter)
3. Garlic chicken (semi gravy, golden onions and lots of garlic)
4. pan fried chilli fish (impressive quality of fish, soft, melts in your mouth)
5. Green curry prawns ( aroma of lemongrass, prawns are not rubbery, goes best with steamed rice)
6. Hot red curry chicken (Not for the faint hearted, quite a spicy curry made with red chili paste)
7. Grilled chicken satay with peanut sauce. ( crunchiness from peanuts and so creamy, love the dip)
In a delivery parcel they should give more peanut butter sauce.

Satisfaction: 4 on 5.
Pocket pinch: Rs 800 for two.

Definitely a good place for takeaway food! Last night I was super-hungry, so decided to pack home some food. Got me the chicken pepper salt, shredded lamb in chilli garlic sauce and chicken fried rice. The food was amazing, and I could not resist nibbling on the pieces of chicken pepper salt while coming back. 

the food, even after 1 hour in transit, tasted very good, and I am quite happy with the fast service, good food and friendly staff attitude.  Great going and keep it up!

P.S. Next time I want pork.

My go to Chinese restaurant!
Ambience: It is a small place, about 40 seater or so, tucked in a quiet niche just off Triangular Park area. The decor is nothing to brag about as well. Its simple and clean. But you don't come here for the decor you know..
Service: The staff is cordial, efficient and the service, prompt. Kudos to that.
Food: I rated this place a 4.5 just for the food, which is light on the tummy and the pricing, which is light on the pocket. The place offers a wide but regular choice of Kolkatan Chinese and Thai specialities. I always have their buttery, cashew-filled, but light, Dragon Chicken for starters and move on to Shredded Chicken with Pineapple Schezwan sauce with HongKong Special Fried Rice or Chilli Garlic n
Noodles. That is my staple here and I love it! The flavours are well balanced and the quantity is pretty good for two.
Recommendation: Try the Dragon Chicken if you are a butter/cashew person or just love to try out good food. And the Pineapple Schezwan sauce is a winner according to this foodie. See you there someday!

Had discovered this place because of its location.Turned out to be better than expected.Good food.Liked the salt pepper prawn and triple schezwan rice.Service is quite fast but the no of staff is bit less so you might be required to swrve yourself.But for the quality at such good price I think it's a decent place.
One might need to wait long for a group of 6 or more since there are only 2 tables to seat 6 each.Also the place becomes little noisy wih a full crowd around.
But if its the food this place is definitely a good visit especially because of the decent pricing.

Recommendation: Try the Dragon Chicken if you are a butter/cashew person or just love to try out good food. And the Pineapple Schezwan sauce is a winner according to this foodie. See you there someday!

well, when ur hungry and u walk in to a restaurant alone.... u expect speed.... and what i got was commendable 

wanted to order a quick bite... 

shredded hongkong lamb 
chili garlic chicken fried rice ... 

the food was brought to me in 10 mins flat and the staff was very prompt and efficient 

intentionally i had half and asked to pack half .... so that i could taste it after it cools down ... 

the lamb was very well cooked and i loved it even after 2 hours of cooking... 

over a great meal.... looking forward to go there again ...

Had discovered this place because of its location.Turned out to be better than expected.Good food.Liked the salt pepper prawn and triple schezwan rice.Service is quite fast but the no of staff is bit less so you might be required to swrve yourself.But for the quality at such good price I think it's a decent place.
One might need to wait long for a group of 6 or more since there are only 2 tables to seat 6 each.Also the place becomes little noisy wih a full crowd around.
But if its the food this place is definitely a good visit especially because of the decent pricing.

Well, this is one of the decent restaurants.
For starters, Chicken Lollipop and Pan fried chilly fish was awesome.
Then for dinner, Chicken Noodles and  Crispy Fried Chicken with Lemon Sauce are always my favourites.
Ambience is good and staff is okay but they should be trained better.
You can try: Golden fried prawns, crispy chicken, pepper chicken, sweet and sour fish, devil's chicken(was very good). 
I did not liked: Mandarin chicken, fish with ouster and wine sauce.
Prices are quite affordable.
 3.5 from me.

Yes undoubtedly its an awesome place to have food. The number of choices available is just outstanding. The food tastes really nice and especially the starters are scrumptious. The quantity is also quite impressive. The pricing is very reasonable and not a thing to worry about. You will have an amazing food at affordable price. The location is also convenient for people staying in south Kolkata. The ambience is well done though nothing out of the world. Their babycorn is a must try I'm sure it will not disappoint any of you. Their chopsuey is also nice. The do have the Indo-Chinese taste that we Kolkatans look for. 
It deserves 4 for its good taste and low pricing.

Yesterday went to Hong kong express for dinner, though i am seeing this restaurant for many years but never tried their food, this time decided to drop in. Ambience was very soothing, when we went there only one table was occupied so no problem getting table.. waiters were attentive and helpful.. we ordered triple sezwan rice, hong kong special rice with chilli prawn and cantonese chicken.. all the food items were great, their chinese preperations were very close to authentic, those who like spicy indian street chinese may not like hong kong's food but i liked very much.. service was very quick, they served within 10 mins.. we specially liked the chilli prawns, the prawns were big and very soft & juicy..price is moderately high but worth spending money here for tasting authentic chinese.. they serve Thai cuisine also..

I am a food lover and I always prefer tasting dishes at different restaurants, cafes and snacks bars, regardless of how big or small the place is. In the Gariahat area, I have been at many restaurants (both big and small ones) but I was unaware of Hongkong Express, located on 70 B, Purna Das Road, Hindustan Park in Kolkata. 

Recently, one or two months back, I discovered an amazing offer flashing on Crazeal's website for dining at Hongkong Express: "A meal for two for Rs. 850/- is available for only Rs. 299/-." I soon grabbed the offer and went there with my best friend for a lunch the next weekend to explore this Chinese and Thai world. Very close to Triangular Park, Gariahat, we did not face any hassles in finding our destination. As we entered, we felt the calmness and silence of the place. Simple but sophisticated, the interior decor is fully influenced by Chinese artwork. The manager (who is probably Chinese) greeted us with a warm welcome. Although we understood his English accent his gestures were totally different from what we generally come across in Kolkata. 

While placing the order, the waiter assisted us with the best options that we could have. For starters, we ordered Crispy Fried Chilly Chicken, and then for the main course, we chose Mixed Triple Schezuan Rice and Chicken in Chilly Oyster Sauce. After a long time, I got the authentic flavor of Chinese dishes sitting in Kolkata. Their triple Schezuan Rice was a totally new item for both of us and we enjoyed having it. Their triple Schezuan Rice is a mixture of three different types of ingredients: rice, fine noodles and thick noodles. Our meal ended with Darsaan, a special kind of dessert which includes our well known sweet dish, 'gaja' served with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. This dessert topped the menu list that was served for us. A perfect combination of authentic Indian dessert and ice-cream, the hot 'gajas' were amazing to taste with frozen ice-cream. 

Our stomachs were full and we had very little space for Darsaan but its heavenly taste did not allow us to waste any of it. We took our time, relaxed and finished it and my mouth waters even today remembering that superb and delicious dessert. I will love to go back to Hongkong Express many times in the future and if others are also planning to explore this gastronomic enclave don't miss their Darsaan.

We had visited the place recently and found the food to be quite decent. Especially the crispy konjee Lamb was delicious. The main course that comprised of mixed noodles and diced chicken side dish was also good.

A deal bought from crazeal marked my first and hopefully the last visit to this "God knows how they run" restaurant. I had to personally approach a waiter to oblige him on coming towards our table. His reaction seemed as to suggest "Can't you see i am busy?", whereas our's was the only table occupied at that time. When I informed him of the deal I bought he didn't understand a bit and went on to call the manager. Then came the food after a long long wait. The starter seemed chicken  tossed in oil and nothing else. As for the main course the quantity of the food is just not enough for a single person whereas they suggest it to be ample for two. And not to speak of the dessert, they just have 3 varieties of which two are unavailable. I mean i had a "facepalm" moment all throughout the evening. Overall a lousy restaurant and I shall never visit again.

I think it is the only restaurant in Kolkata which has got good potential in it but they don;t seem interested in doing good business. 
Food was pretty good but the service was really bad! You may lose your appetite while waiting for the menu card. When I first visited this place it was, 2009 and at that time both the food and service were really good. But I was totally disappointed in my last visit. Me and my friend had to wait for 20 minutes before someone turned up to give us the menu card! The person who took our order (it took 15 mins more after giving us the menu card) was very arrogant and rude. While we were waiting we saw two families who left without eating because of not getting any service and they were really pissed like we were. The person who took our order even got involved in an argument with us. I don't want to give this place even a single star rating but I have to after having posted my review.. :(
