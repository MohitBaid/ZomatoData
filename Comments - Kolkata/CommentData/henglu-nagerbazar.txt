Very bad experience. Went for dinner on Diwali night 19th Oct 2017. Asked for Mutton Biryani and Chilli Chicken - fried rice. Biryani was very bland in taste. No smell, no taste just rice full of oil. I never tasted such poor Biryani in my life. Small pc of Mutton but it was soft atleast. Same applicable for fried rice n Chilli Chicken. No taste no seasoning. Throughout dull taste. Dirty place. Very disappointing with overall experience.
Mutton Biryani 120
Egg Fried rice 60
Chilli Chicken 80
Total 260 waste of money. Value for money - a big 0.

Chinese tasted average and place seems less hygienic. Prices are at par with other local restaurants.Hope they will improve with the time . I will revisit this place again in future when I will be in Nagerbazar.

A very useful eatery at nagerbazar area. Seating arrangement is of 4 people so for most it's a mere take away counter. Food is decent and is quite pocket friendly. I've tried their egg rolls and chicken rolls as well as biryanis. Items are standard. Food is simple but good. However the eatery looks quite messy from the outside. That is something that the authority should look into.
Service is quite good.

Fast food center in Nager Bazaar. People usually take away their food because not enough space to sit and dine. Rolls, chow, rice - everything is available here at a very low cost. Food is okay types.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:
Jessore road area has now some very fine cafes, restos. From the top variety of foods available at this region there are some small outlets too which are looking good to make their name here soon. Henglu, the name sounds very peculiar and different and it located just near the Nagerbazar crossing and near to satgachi auto stand. Deals with chinese cuisines and north indian as well.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:
Very small ambiance. just three tables with 10 seater. Place is dirty and dosen't look impressive either. 

FOOD:
Needed some evening snacks. Very hungry indeed so went to this place and after entering and dinning in i was not going without eating. After seeing the kitchen Just ordered Veg noodles to silent my hunger.
Thou veg noodles was a bit satisfactory to me. It was lightly made with less oil including onion capsicum etc. Taste seemed nice to me. 

QNQ AND PRICES:
Quality and quantity was average. Prices are pocket friendly.

CONCLUSION:
My 2.5 is just for what they have made up this place. Improvement needed in the ambiance. Can't explain everything with just a noodles to be honest.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

A very small food joint just between nagerbazar and saatgachhi. The place runs mostly on rolls and chowmin. Around 6 chairs are kept inside but preferably I would be happy to stand outside and have my roll. Price is very cheap, now a days even the thela-wala charges 25 rupees for an egg roll- they are still on 20.
The paratha is kind of a ring paratha which has been incepted from Haji and other big roll corners across India, though a bit oily but who cares when you have decided to have fast food??You alredy told ur liver and stomach "All is well" dont you??
While they were preparing the egg roll, I was going through their menu card and to my utter astonishment I found- mutton biriyani 100 rupees...dude seriously!!
To keep ur mouth, tongue, and teeth twisted in the evening, you can definitely try this place.

Though it's called henglu yet even if you are drunk never go to this place... Henglu is near satgachi mainly fast food and rolls which is really bad... I don't wanna hurt your sentiments henglu but this is what you are.

Just under the Nagerbazar flyover this small restaurant is located on the main Jessore Road. This is a kind of restaurant that delivers pocket friendly foods in such a crowded place.  Although inside of the restaurant no decorations are there & neither its neat & clean. Somehow the dining is not so preferable for everyone. But coming to the food : They make pretty good Chinese dishes actually, Chowmin & Fried Rice are testier & well cooked, less spicy but enough to make you happy. You can't expect more for that price. Somehow their Biriyani is not too great, It tastes dry, spices are not mixed together with the rice. Chicken or Mutton of the Biriyani is not well cooked too. Their Rolls are pretty average, made with slim kind of paratha & no special taste rather than its too light melted sauce.
Conclusion : Concluding the price of the foods & quality this restaurant becomes an average place. But if you are hungry & nearby to this restaurant then you can give it a try with no harm at all.
