A nice concept of something like 'taste bhi health bhi' but a little more over health part here, I guess.
The ambience is good; the tables over the grass was something of a good concept. Interiors were really good.
Staff was quite friendly, they gave suggestions on food nicely. 
Food was made healthy by various means of using whole wheat instead of white flour which is really good but lacked a little taste, not because of flour used but the stuffings and toppings used. 
We had ordered Burrito, Falafel wrap and pizza (which was a little let down). The wraps were good. The pizza was just okayish, wheat bread can also be fermented but I think they used normal flat wheat bread as the base. 

Also, we came when there was a guy performing on guitar and was really good but I feel that he should have given a mic and a little podium maybe (just saying) just to add some more order to the place.

Overall, it was a good place, wouldn't mind visiting again if I am done with the unhealthy food for some time.

After a number of visits I am happy to say that this place has rapidly become one of my favorite in town to hang out and/ or take people out,  with fun healthy drinks, good service, great ambience and lavish food, it has made its mark as a star player in Kolkata's food scene. We had mix sauce pasta, some awesome pizzas and some unbelievable drinks...  The service was just too good. I would rate 5 out of 5.

Quite known in the city for their health friendly food and beverages and sports and games theme.

Ambience- yes looks quite attractive. They have some really cool looking seatings like one like a boxing ring. Seatings are quite comfy.

Staff- They are very welcoming and helpful.

Menu- Priced at average rates and variety is satisfying like any other standard cafes.

Food- we took the special pizza with added chicken. For beverages we ordered coffee.

Review- the food was not at all up to the mark. The cheese over the pizza was not at all molten. The pizza sauce didn't taste appetising at all. The pizza bread was also crusty.
The coffee was too sweet inspite of telling them to give the sugar separately. It wasn't wellmade at all.

Will not recommend this place to anyone who prefers taste and quality. I understand an innovative theme to attract health freaks but healthy foods can also be tasty.

The place is really cool. Nice place to sit and hangout with your people. The juices served here are really fresh, tasty and refreshing. We took Pinneaple Blossom and Kapal Bharti. Both were awesome in taste.

Then we ordered Fish Augratin (not in their menu) which was really tasty. One of the best in this city. 

Keep it up.

Special mention about the staff and their courteous service.

The place is very interior and also very less number of  people are there. Interior is good with 3 types of seating area but no of staff also very less. And the delivery time is also prolonged. But nevertheless the taste of food is good and only for this the visit is successful.  We ordered chiken tikka, nun roti and chiken kasha. The table is so small that we could not adjust the plates and the servings. It is a bit clumsy and need professional touch.

The ambience is outstanding. So is the service and everything BUT THE FOOD. The coffee tasted like it lacked milked, ice cream appeared stale and most surprisingly the burrito they suggested would be tasty tasted bad enough for me to not finish it. However just a cup of coffee with a date or a group of friends wouldn’t be a bad idea owing to just the ambience.

Decor and ambience :
It's spacious and has really good sitting arrangement. They provide u really cozy and comfortable ways to sit and chill with your friends . They have a books as well. Decor is impressive and really cool enough to woo you.
Food :
The menu is actually vegetarian but since I had seen many reviews mentioning about nonveg dishes, I was relieved to go. But they didn't have any Nov veg dishes. It's just that on asking they would convert few of the veg items into non veg ones by just adding chicken cubes to it. The taste was disastrous. We had chicken clear soup, dry chilli chicken and chicken spring roll. Chicken clear soup was a disaster. They even charged for the extra chicken along with the veg soup price. Chilli chicken was okay.
Budget :
I did not find it budget friendly when compared to the quantity they provided.
I gave 1 star only for decor and ambience and nothing else.

I was just passing by today and was feeling like having a salad. So I stopped by to ask them if they make salad .. it was not there in the menu but they just completely did an ala carte for me. This salad was perfect. Its a healthy cafe so there is less of mayo and more of olive oil. The salad was perfectly dressed and well plated . Wonderful experience will love to go back.

After seeeing the review I thought of visiting the place yesterday evening 14-11-2017.
It was just a horrible experience . I never knew that veg pakoda means 2 pc of round shaped potato, 2 pc of round shaped onion, 2 pc of round shaped tomato are dipped in the batter and serving it with 2 pc of normal chilli. this horrible item of veg pakoda cost 180/- which was really shocking.. 

The staff guided us to order Lebanese Falafal wrap which was in reality one chapati rolled with some vegies.. which taste horrible.. but amount 180/-

The chicken preparation was also just worst which amount to Rs. 280/-.

Tea was just normal but it cost 50 without any reason.

These horrible stuffs in total amount to Rs. 873/- .
Instead of spending over there it would be better to spend in Konetto pizza counter in cc1.

The staff claim that the food items are made in olive oil, but believe me it was  not olive oil.. because in my kitchen only olive oil is used.. and I am accustomed with that taste.

Money doesn't matter if the food quality is better.

The staffs were just unprofessional. They at first took the order then then after wasting some time came back with the answer item is not available.

Never visit again ......

Located between Swimming Pool Block and CAP Island ,this standalone restuarant stands in just beside the road and quite easy to locate . D Talks Adda as the name suggest will give u the feel of a adda atmosphere interiors once you are inside the cafe .  In a nutshell , D Talks Adda , boasts to be a funky sporty themed health cafe. So if you are on a diet or need to have guilt free food,this is the place to be .

WHAT I ORDERED - 

1. REGULAR LIP 2 LIP : Served in a unique flat bottomed laboratory flask , this is basically watermelon detox cooler. Perfect if you want to detox your body .

2.ANTI OXIDENT BOOSTER :  Mint and lemon amalgamated together makes a perfect detox booster for your body. And this one is  totally healthy, rather I would say super healthy .

3. POMEGRANATE ICE TEA : One of the best drinks that I had ordered .The whole pieces of pomegranate makes it a perfect yet healthy drink . 

4. CHICKEN LOLLIPOP : Fried to its brim in olive oil , this is quite a lovely starter . 

5.FISH FINGER : The fresh smell of bhetki fish once you bite it ,is all that would crave for again and again . 

6. CHICKEN NUGGETS : Too crispy ,yet fried in olive oil ,so you can keep the guilt aside while you munch on it . 

7. CHINESE CIGARS : Basically these are chicken spring rolls cut into the form of cigars giving it a fancy look yet tasty . Must try . 

8.CHICKEN POLLENTE :  This is chicken breast  mixed in a vegetable creamy gravy ,served alongside with ghee rice and vegetables. Too good. Must try,.

9.CHICKEN KASHA : This was totally a yummy dish  , the gravy was so tasty , you could literally keep o n licking the bowl . Have it with rice or roti asc preferrable. They use whole wheat atta in their roti ,so you can have it easily .

10.KHEER : Less in sugar ,yet tasty , this is one of the desserts you should definitely try . 

11.ICE CREAM : Filled with fresh fruits and again less in sugar, this was a perfect ending to our meal .

Overall the Cafe is brilliant , prices are reasonable , ambience is perfect , food is healthy .

D Talks Adda is located in Sector 1 Saltlake.The thing about it which will instantly attract you is the Ambience.The theme of sport and fitness is mindblowing.

They are known for healthy foods and juices.We have tried many of it,between them Regular Lip 2 Lip was impressive,I liked the way they served it in a glass flask which uses in Laboratories. Ice Tea was refreshing. 

In starters, Fish Finger was yummy and lipsmacking, a recommended one of them. Chicken Spring roll was delicious and enjoyable.

In main course,Chicken Pollente was terrific in taste,served with rice and vegetables.This is something new I have tried in Chicken,really enjoyed it,a recommended one.Chicken Kasha was excellent in taste with Rice.Chicken was very light and amazingly tasty.

Ice Cream with fruit is a fair choice in desserts,it was toothsome and tasty.

Overall the Healthy , tasty food and the cool ambience makes D Talk Adda a true winner.

Now this food as I would pitch in is way too "Hatke"..as the name suggests it's a paradise for foodies and not so foodies who keep their calories on check.. this place will burst the myth that delicious food need not be unhealthy..
Quirky interiors will remind you how important it is to keep your body and mind healthy.. from high seating chairs designed as cycle seats to a boxing ring..D-talks Adda has it all..
Though I was a bit apprehensive on how a low calorie dinning experience would be but when our orders arrived..we were mum..so here is what made us mum..
Coolers: anti oxidant booster and iced tea ( let me tell you that antioxidant booster is a very innovative drink and a must try)
Starters: Fish fingers (I still can't believe that things fried in olive oil can be this tasty) and spring rolls..(exteriors were amazingly crisp)
Main course: Chicken pollente (a complete dish serving you chicken in pesto sause, herbed rice and veggies) and Chicken kasha teamed with steamed rice ( you need to taste this mind aromatic chicken.. it's a winner)
Dessert: mixed fruit ice cream salad 
A guilt free happy lunch it was..the best part is it was very close to where I stay..and it's in a very prominent location in salt lake.. you can't go wrong with this..

With the launch of their new non veg menu, this sports cafe is all set to steal the show.
Located near the swimming pool area of salt lake, this joint is perfect for an outing with friends. What adds more to the delight is the total sporty ambiance.
The decorations, seating ideas and finally the healthy food makes it all the worth.
And yes, this sports cafe here serves healthy food!!

Visited the place with my friends and tried the lip to lip drink, and it was totally refreshing and amazing!
Then we ordered some fish finger and chicken spring rolls for starters. I must say the starters are absolutely amazing here and the best part is inspite of the fry, it's totally healthy as they fry it on olive oil.
 For the main course we ordered chicken pollente which was absolutely amazing and finger licking. The chicken was wonderfully cooked.
We wrapped our meal by ordering some mixed fruit ice cream which was tasty as well as healthy.

The overall experience here was really good and I absolutely love the idea. This place is totally ready to steal the show.

Tucked in one of the busy Lanes of salt lake, this place shouldn't be difficult for you to locate if you are acquainted with salt lake, it barely takes 5 mins from City centre. Google maps are highly recommend otherwise!

It is very interesting and highly praise worthy to see creative thinking and innovation behind upcoming Cafe's and this place surely scores high in terms of ambience, hospitality, decor, interiors and the concept! A sports themed cafe which serves some really amazing delicacies, this place reverberates a positive vibe which naturally elevates your experience!

We started our journey with a few beverages, namely, the lip to lip - quirky name, even quirkier in taste! Pretty healthy!
The anti-oxidant booster- the sip of this beverage would take away your guilt in terms of your junk food intake! And lastly the good old ice tea!

Now coming to the food, the chicken lollipop was pretty delectable and highly recommend! The amount of sauce was just perfect. The chicken nuggets serve as the perfect slider so you could go for it!

The main course stole the show for me basically! This place surely knows how to make a steak! Do try their chicken steak! We also ordered some rice along with chicken kasha which turned out to be a really good combination! Thumbs up!

We ended our stay with some ice cream which was really good! To sum up my experience, i really enjoyed coming to this place. More often than not, the ambience plays an important role in terms of satisfaction and this place definitely won me over.

A perfect place for adda with good food. Heard a lot about this cafe as they serve food which is only healthy and fat free food.
Ambience was pretty good as it was all related to sports. A mixture of health and sport and they maintained the theme pretty well.


BEVERAGES

Regular lip 2 lip - A perfect blend of fruit juices which was healthy and tasty.

Ice Tea - Iced tea never felt this way, it tastes amazing.


STARTERS

Chicken Lollipop - Chicken was really tender and it was cooked perfectly fine.

Fish Finger - Fish wasn’t oily and it was cooked in a really less oil, yet it tasted heavenly.

Chicken Spring Roll - Spring rolls are generally oily but it contained very less oil and yet it tasted really good.


MAIN COURSE 

Chicken Kasha - It was very light and creamy, didn’t felt heavy after eating it at all it felt homely good food.

Chicken Steak - Chicken which had really yummy stuffing and baked veggies to please your soul.

Rice - Chicken kasha with rice was the perfect combination, rice was fluffy and it was light.


DESSERTS 
Ice cream - Ice cream never felt this good, a mixture of fresh fruits mixed in ice cream was perfect for any weather.


LOCATION - Salt lake sector 1, near swimming pool.

Recently visited this sports cafe in salt lake sector one and I must tell you it lives up to the name. Starting with the interior, it was very innovative, each wall decorated differently from the other. Really loved the seating rangement near the bar where they used cycle tiers on their seats. There were number of other add ons too
Next we come to the drinks. The anti oxidant booster drinks were freshly made and healthy to drink. We also had the ice tea which was really amazing and looked really pretty.
Next we had the starters and in that we had spring rolls and fish finger. The spring rolls was nice but I think the sauce could have been better and the fish finger was crispy.
Main course was my favorite part. Their main course is definitely not a miss. The chicken kasha was damn good and tasted very homely. Love their chicken polenta which was creamy and very tasty. Over all the main course was the best.
The dessert was simple and average.
Overall I loved the place and it's a must try.

Ordered their whole wheat margarita today. It tasted OK ok. The good part is its thin crust. I think it's little overpriced moreover they should use mozzarella cheese that's how a pizza should be and also deliver the pizza in a square box and not pile up in an container that's my suggestion for you guys.

The moment you step in, this place emanates a sense of comfort and warmth. The cafe is unconventionally furnished with bar-stools, individual chairs, sofas and a wooden platform where one can lean back with cushions on his lap and indulge in hours-long adda sessions. Apart from board games, there's a section with books too. We ordered moccachino, chicken nuggets, dry chili chicken and chicken-au-gratin. Each item was a delight. Hospitality was note-worthy. A guy-singing-songs-while-playing-his-guitar was so refreshing compared to the artificial music they put on in most places. Overall, a perfect place to relax with friends or spend some time alone.

Located in between swimming pool and CAP camp island, this place is quite easy to locate. As the name suggests, this place is great for adda with your pals. It even has a place where you can sit cross legged with cushions behind your back. When we went there, live music was being played. Full marks for the ambience. 
Coming to the food. I loved the hot coffee they served. Although their menu shows only veg items, non veg dishes are available too. We had chicken nuggets, dry chili chicken and chicken au gratin. All were done quite good. The person serving us kept on asking if we liked the food or if anything else could be done. We really liked the hospitality.

This is a healthy food cafe..with a funky- sporty theme... The ambience is amazing... The decor of this place is quite a mix and match.. Exquisitely designed to be liked and appreciated by customers..

This place serves good food.. their main goal is to break the myth that tasty food cannot be healthy..
So the foods are prepared in such a fashion to simultaneously be healthy and also satisfy the taste buds...

We ordered..

Watermelon Lemonade
Anulom Vilom
Crispy Stir Fried Chicken
Hara Bhara Kebab
Peas Pulao
Chicken Bharta
Paneer Tikka Masala
Gajar Ka Halwa

Food was very tasty and healthy.. I was not feeling heavy at all.. It was an amazing experience all together.. Would love to visit this place soon..

D -Talks Adda is a cafe at Salt Lake, Sector 1. The outlet is located in BF 31, Near Swimming Pool. This outlet is nicely decorated with soothing music in the air and also with sports themes. There is even a sofa seating for large groups. This outlet is known for its fusion food from around the world like Mocktails, Iced Mochaccino, Mediterranean Wrap, Chinese Cigar and Oil free Biriyani. It's also a health adda cafe that means all of the food items have health benefits. 

This place is a perfect place to hang out with friends as the music played here was amazing. Absolutely loved the food at D-Talks Adda the first time and this time was excited to try it again. The place is very neat and the placement of tables is outstanding. The place is decorated with sports themes and the flooring is also looks clean and nice. With sofas on one side and the other being chairs there are plenty of options to seat.
                    

The things I really loved were : 

DRINKS :

1) Watermelon Cooler :
Fresh Watermelon with mint, a combination much needed in summers.

2) Lemonade :
Another summer cooler made from fresh lemonade and is every bit as refreshing as it is beautiful!
                    

STARTERS:

1) Chinese Cigar :
Crispy thin pastry Chinese cigars filled with chunks of vegetable, perfected with Asian spices sauce. 

2) Hara Bhara Kebab :
One of the most loved kebabs in Indian restaurants around the world, the Hara Bhara Kebab is interestingly made with the humble spinach! Bound together by mashed chana dal, green peas and paneer and old alike, thanks to its sumptuous texture and lingering flavor.

3) Chicken Nuggets:
This nuggets have a super-thick coating of crisp and flaky batter encasing moist, tender, and juicy bite-sized pieces of chicken.
                    

MAIN COURSES :

1) Oil Free Biriyani :Yes, you heard it right. It's oil free biriyani. Do you want to keep your taste buds happy while enjoying your favorite Lunch or dinner ? If so, then you are the right place. Noticeable benefits of zero oil veg biriyani includes reduced cholesterol levels, reduced triglyceride levels, improved immune system, increase in stamina and healthy reduction of weight.

2) Yellow Dal:
This Spicy Yellow Dal is so tasty you will want it every day. It's just heaven.
                    
3) Mughlai Chicken:
Mughlai Chicken is a restaurant style, north Indian dish with a creamy, dark brown onion gravy that will have you licking the plate!


DESSERTS:

1) Fruits Ice Cream:
Do want a healthier alternative to ice cream ? Try whole fruit "ice cream" and artificially created flavouring simulating the combined flavour of many different fruits.

2) Gajar Halwa:
Carrot halwa or gajar ka halwa is one of the post popular Indian dessert. It is a traditional Punjabi dessert made with carrots and milk. It was just awesome. 💕 


Overall, It is one such good place and hygiene food. I loved every dish, that was served. The soothing ambiance is perfect to chill with food and drinks. To discover more, just drop in and you would definitely be delighted by the food. 

I will definitely visit this place sometime soon and try the other dishes on the menu.

Located in between swimming pool and CAP camp island, this place is quite easy to locate. As the name suggests, this place is great for adda with your pals. It even has a place where you can sit cross legged with cushions behind your back. When we went there, live music was being played. Full marks for the ambience. 
Coming to the food. I loved the hot coffee they served. Although their menu shows only veg items, non veg dishes are available too. We had chicken nuggets, dry chili chicken and chicken au gratin. All were done quite good. The person serving us kept on asking if we liked the food or if anything else could be done. We really liked the hospitality.

This is a healthy food cafe..with a funky- sporty theme... The ambience is amazing... The decor of this place is quite a mix and match.. Exquisitely designed to be liked and appreciated by customers..

This place serves good food.. their main goal is to break the myth that tasty food cannot be healthy..
So the foods are prepared in such a fashion to simultaneously be healthy and also satisfy the taste buds...

We ordered..

Watermelon Lemonade
Anulom Vilom
Crispy Stir Fried Chicken
Hara Bhara Kebab
Peas Pulao
Chicken Bharta
Paneer Tikka Masala
Gajar Ka Halwa

Food was very tasty and healthy.. I was not feeling heavy at all.. It was an amazing experience all together.. Would love to visit this place soon..

D -Talks Adda is a cafe at Salt Lake, Sector 1. The outlet is located in BF 31, Near Swimming Pool. This outlet is nicely decorated with soothing music in the air and also with sports themes. There is even a sofa seating for large groups. This outlet is known for its fusion food from around the world like Mocktails, Iced Mochaccino, Mediterranean Wrap, Chinese Cigar and Oil free Biriyani. It's also a health adda cafe that means all of the food items have health benefits. 

This place is a perfect place to hang out with friends as the music played here was amazing. Absolutely loved the food at D-Talks Adda the first time and this time was excited to try it again. The place is very neat and the placement of tables is outstanding. The place is decorated with sports themes and the flooring is also looks clean and nice. With sofas on one side and the other being chairs there are plenty of options to seat.
                    

The things I really loved were : 

DRINKS :

1) Watermelon Cooler :
Fresh Watermelon with mint, a combination much needed in summers.

2) Lemonade :
Another summer cooler made from fresh lemonade and is every bit as refreshing as it is beautiful!
                    

STARTERS:

1) Chinese Cigar :
Crispy thin pastry Chinese cigars filled with chunks of vegetable, perfected with Asian spices sauce. 

2) Hara Bhara Kebab :
One of the most loved kebabs in Indian restaurants around the world, the Hara Bhara Kebab is interestingly made with the humble spinach! Bound together by mashed chana dal, green peas and paneer and old alike, thanks to its sumptuous texture and lingering flavor.

3) Chicken Nuggets:
This nuggets have a super-thick coating of crisp and flaky batter encasing moist, tender, and juicy bite-sized pieces of chicken.
                    

MAIN COURSES :

1) Oil Free Biriyani :Yes, you heard it right. It's oil free biriyani. Do you want to keep your taste buds happy while enjoying your favorite Lunch or dinner ? If so, then you are the right place. Noticeable benefits of zero oil veg biriyani includes reduced cholesterol levels, reduced triglyceride levels, improved immune system, increase in stamina and healthy reduction of weight.

2) Yellow Dal:
This Spicy Yellow Dal is so tasty you will want it every day. It's just heaven.
                    
3) Mughlai Chicken:
Mughlai Chicken is a restaurant style, north Indian dish with a creamy, dark brown onion gravy that will have you licking the plate!


DESSERTS:

1) Fruits Ice Cream:
Do want a healthier alternative to ice cream ? Try whole fruit "ice cream" and artificially created flavouring simulating the combined flavour of many different fruits.

2) Gajar Halwa:
Carrot halwa or gajar ka halwa is one of the post popular Indian dessert. It is a traditional Punjabi dessert made with carrots and milk. It was just awesome. 💕 


Overall, It is one such good place and hygiene food. I loved every dish, that was served. The soothing ambiance is perfect to chill with food and drinks. To discover more, just drop in and you would definitely be delighted by the food. 

I will definitely visit this place sometime soon and try the other dishes on the menu.

D Talks adda is located at BF block of sector 1, salt lake.

The ambiance was superb as well as the decor. You will love the sports themed ambiance if you came here.

Space was huge and easily accommodate groups of people.

Its basically a health cafe that means all of the food items have health benefits even they fried things in air-fryer with less olive oil.

Drinks I had Anulom Vilom (pinapple and orange mixed drink), surya namaskar (the mixed fruit drink), and Watermelon Lemonade. Loved the Anulom Vilom and lemonade. Surya Namaskar was also good though.

Appetizers I had Chinese cigars, a veg stuffed cigars  dipped in some spicy sauce. Also I forgot to mention all of the sauces are in-house so there was no harmful ingredients.
Stir Fried Crispy Chicken was air-fried shredded chicken. It was tasty.
Chicken nuggets were very good, I loved it.
Hara bhara kebab is again a veg filled kebab. It was nice also.

From the Main Course I had Peas pulao, Veg Biryani, Mughlai Chicken, yellow dal, paneer tikka masala and desi Ghee roti.
All of the item were awesome.....

Desserts I had the gajar ka halwa. It was so tasty that I ordered again for myself.

Classic ambience... Best place for having adda over geniue good food... They are running the concept of serving cheat healthy diet food... It's not easy for everyone to switch from junk to healthy diet all of a sudden... So, one can try this place while having that journey from unhealthy to healthy diet... With a smile n nutritious adda over here... We tried their...

#Moctails#
❤ Watermelon Lemonade ~ Extremely refreshing...

❤ Surya Namaskar ~ Excellent one too...

❤ Anulom Vilom ~ Awesome one...

❤ Kapal Bharti ~ It looked like anulom vilom but tastes very different... Good one too...

P. S. All the dishes are healthy... So order bajhijhak...

#Starters#
❤ Chinese Cigar ~ Very tasty...

❤ Stir Fried Crispy Chicken ~ Crispy n crunchy... Nice one...

❤ Hara Bhara Kabab ~ Great one too...

❤ Chicken Nuggets ~ Mind blowing n yummy...

P. S. You guys will wonder how these starters can be any way healthy !!! Isn't it ??? They are using airfryer for frying all these... And as all know airfryer needs extremely less oil, making it a healthy one in comparison with the deep fried ones...

#Main Course#
"Yellow Dal", "Paneer Tikka Masala", "Chicken Bharta", "Mugalai Chicken", "Peas Pulao", "Phulka" & "Oil Free Biryani"... All were decent enough... Rather very good as far the heath factor is concerned...

#Desserts#
❤ Fruit ice cream ~ It was yummy...

❤ Gajar Halwa ~ Just awesome...

No... This are not healthy at all... But after all these healthy dishes... Thora unhealthy tho bantahai...

Overall, an awesome place... Great food... Highly recommended...

Photos coming soon...

Sporty ambience with quirky, vibrant and colourful interiors. This place has a cozy seating arrangement with live sports screening. Staffs were courteous. Prompt Service.

BEVERAGES

STARTERS
Chinese Cigar: Presentation of this dish was perfect as it tasted. It was absolutely delicious, more with its spicy chutney.
Hara Bhara Kebabs: A healthy and delicious Indian Vegetarian snack made with spinach, potatoes and green peas.

MAIN COURSE
Veg biryani (fat-free): Vegetables in your biryani is actually very healthy. Biryani without oil to reap real benefits.
Yellow Dal: Dal itself is high in protein. This dish is absolutely flavourful and delicious.
Mughlai Chicken: Creamy dark brown gravy, absolutely mouthwatering. The pieces of chicken in was was meaty and soft.

DESSERTS
Gajar ka Halwa: It is a light nutritious dessert with less fat than many other typical South Asian Dessert. It became my favourite ❤

D-Talks Adda specializes in providing us delicious lip-smacking food with a healthy twist. Yes you heard it right. They have incorporated the world healthy in their segment. Keeping it at par with their saying, they have decorated their cafe taking the theme of sports. You will come across beautifully decorated unicycles, boxing ring and so on. We were eager to get a glimpse of how they are gonna project their concept. We started of with Hara Bhara Kebab, Crispy Chicken and Watermelon Lemonade. Now keeping the health catchline in mind, the kebab were baked and the crispy Chicken air fried to perfection. Flavours were there and you wont be able to differentiate much. So definately a big thumbs up. The Watermelon Lemonade was beautiful. It was pulpy and from this you can get an idea that it was healthy and healthy.
Coming to the main course, we had Peas Pulao, Chicken Bharta and Paneer Tikka Masala. Loved each and every item. To our surprise, they were packed with flavours. 
We ended our meal with Gajar Ka Halwa. This was awesome. It was not overtly sweet and wasnt greasy at all. Loved it totally. I am totally amazed as to how they managed to full off gajar ka halwa keeping in mind the calaroie. 
I had a lovely time here. Definately a big thumbs up to them. The concept is absolutely wonderful. Fitness lovers will surely love this place.

Today I visited this place for lunch and to hangout with my friends as we were really excited if a health cafe would be able to deliver in terms of food and we were pleasently surprised.

Ambience and Dećor: The ambience is really good with spacious seating areas which is great for a group of friends,the decor is also really quirky with stools which resemble bicycles and a seating space resembling a boxing ring.It is a health cafe promising to give us tasty food which is also healthy.


Food and Beverages: 

Beverages:

Watermelon Lemonade: A very healthy drink consisting of fresh watermelon juice,really refreshing in the heat.

Anulom Vilom: Another healthy drink,consisting of fresh pineapple juice and correctly named after a yogasana because it is not only refreshing but extremely rejuvenating.


Food:

Starters:

• Chicken Nuggets: These are air fried chicken nuggets with a brush of olive oil and are extremely tasty served with an amazing dip.They are comparitively much healthier than the regular nuggets.

•Chinese Cigars: These were presented really beautifully in shot glasses and the dips within those glasses,the taste was good though a little on the spicy side.


Main Course:

•Veg Biryani: This was an oil free preparation,really tasty but healthy as well, now this is what we never hear in case of biryanis so this is quite unique. Give it a try.

•Mughlai Chicken: This dish was really good with the chicken well cooked and the gravy was really flavourful.

•Yellow Dal: This was the regular dal which is always healthy and it was decent aswell.

Desserts:

•Gajar Halwa: Made with dried fruits,milk and khoya this was a healthier take on the regular gajar halwa we have at home but the taste was amazing as well.

•Fruit IceCream: Ice Cream served with fresh fruits such as pineapples.Really loved it.


Service: The service was very fast and the staff were really well behaved and attentive.


Great Place to hangout with friends along with tasty and healthy food and a great ambience.

Recommended.

Very less cafes and eateries have such pretty and varieties of interiors. You will have no idea what this place has in store , from outside the gate.

Sigh unique seating, lovely graffitti walls, vibrant interiors and a huge checker board on a wall.

This is a health cafe with sports screening .
We took the following beverages :- Anulom vilom, watermelon lemonade, kapalbhaati, surya namaskar.
All of them were made with fresh fruits and were really healthy.
For starters we took , chicken nuggets - air fried with a brush of olive oil served wig their house made sauce. Chinese cigars, presented amazingly .

The main course comprised of veg biriyani, oil/fat free. Mughlai chicken, with almost no fat visible in the gravy. Yellow daal.

Desserts were fruits and ice cream, and gajar ka halwa.

It was a new discovery for me.. The interior was quite unique and was a right place to hang out with friends with long chats.. The food was also good.. I ordered a chicken brochulie soup and wheat pasta.. It tasted good. I hope the quantity was little more for me I felt the quantity was less.

Nice decent place which serves healthy food. The Wraps and other Indian foods they say are cooked in ghee while Italian items are cooked in olive oil. They revise their menu every six months which is why the gnocchi we had this time had different sauce in serving . The ambience is good and the staff are courteous and polite. The food I’d say needs a little improvement both taste wise and quantity wise but considering certain replacements e.g. maida with atta to make the food healthier (as their theme goes), the taste is decent. We also had a Mediterranean wrap which had a very strong mustard flavour which kinda spoiled the taste. Apple crepe was okayish . The presentation of all the dishes were good. Overall a good place to visit and chill.

First of all this place is inside salt lake.

If u have a car or an uber then location is not the issue.

Now about mocktails and shake. I must say i had a best cold coffee ever at this place.

Sitting arrangement is very unique . I mean if u want a chair table,u want a recliner bed or unique wooden well type seat .wow 10 out of 10.

And nice place u be with ir close one .

Serving good.

All the best

Had an amazing dinner experience today. The place was almost empty when we entered. The interiors are quirky and themed like a sports club. We ordered french broccoli soup and spanish tomato mushroom soup, served with slices of bread, both were so amazing that we reorderd.
We ordered, Chocolate shake, pineapple blossom and bubble tea, all were good. Except for the bubbles in the bubble tea were a tad bit too chewy which I disliked.
Cheese ravioli in mixed sauce was good.
Rajma corn tikki was average.
The continental sizzler, having creamy mushrooms and tangy veggies with side of rice, and a fried Mexican fajitas wrap, was amazing.
Service was prompt. Had a good experience.

I was impressed with the interiors and look feel.looking at their menu-I couldnt find options for healthy item.Since I was too hungry so went ahead.The kind of price and quantity served is not justified.I think they should revise their menu and justify their theme with food items availability.
Much way to go.

D-Talks Adda never disappoints me. I have tried most all of the Indian restaurants around the salt-lake area, but I still keep only coming back to the D-Talks - their delicious food is always consistently the best, and the service bends over backwards to make your experience truly memorable- Try the Tandoori paneer tikka, and Dal makhni. Yummy!!

My rating is based on a recent visit to this cafe during their first year anniversary. They had an offer going on- unlimited food for ₹200.

Ambience: D-Talks stands for detox or detoxification, so it would only be wise to have a rather healthy life style choice as the theme for the interiors. What better than sports -  very nicely done. The unicycle bar stools, the boxing ring seating, roller skates as shelf and hockey sticks as door handles are pretty creative.   But from a comfort point of view, the chairs didn't seem to do a good job. Or maybe it was my ultra fat wallet with all the world's coins in it. One would get an upbeat feeling on entering this cafe, that's for sure.

Service: It seems they have good service. At least that's what I have been told by few. And indeed they might have. The introductory pleasantries were nice, we were showed our seats and the nice lady kept coming back to us to check how things were. But it might be because of the anniversary offer, they could not manage the crowd and things seemed haywire. I waited for some of my orders for about an hour to finally not actually receive it. I waited for thirty mins for my bill, which never came and instead I went up to the billing desk and made the payment. Yes, the staff was very polite and courteous indeed. That's the one reason I could suppress my disappointment and rate them at 3.5.

Food: The main story. I'm not a big fan of healthy food joints. Some rip you off with the expectation of actual healthy food and give you really bad old stale stuff, while some others are outright boring. D-TALKS on the other hand seems to have managed to fine tune and find the balance. Crispy chilly baby corn isn't really a healthy option with the corn flour and oil, but it was very light. Clearly no funny stuff added for the crispiness because it was not so crispy at all. Just the natural crunch of the baby corns. I cannot say anything remotely closely nice about the rajma-sweet corn tikki though. Rajma is healthy, but the tikka was clearly prepared hours before and heated in oven before serving. Oil was oozing out and it didn't feel good. The Mexican wrap didn't feel like one. It was some dry tikki rolled in a roti dusted with excess atta. I have never tried a California roll before, so cannot comment how it's supposed to be, but again felt like some tikki inside a roti. Oh I forgot about the soups. The clear veg soup was amazing. The best item among the whole menu, I thought. And they also served European red lentil soup spiced with cumin seeds, aka daal with jeera tadka. It tasted nice too, because one can't screw up daal. The chocolate pizza felt sinful, although I was a bit unhappy as they didn't top it with Gems as shown in their menu card. It was too chocolaty and cheesy. Perhaps the best way to say to someone - "I love you". We also had Chinese sizzler. It was okayish, but certainly certainly not healthy. I don't expect a dish like this in a place that has detox in its name. I mean, chocolate and cheese are healthy if you want to look at it that way, but deep fried "I have no clue what it was" is definitely not healthy. The do fried cabbage patty also sucked. Then came spaghetti in red sauce. It was nice but seemed to have a lot of vinegar? Gave me an upset stomach. Again, maybe it was all because of the offer going on, but most of the dishes were clearly prepared hours before and just reheated before serving. I didn't like them. Also the items in the menu look very expensive if this is really the quality. 

My first experience at this joint was certainly not so good. I went in with a lot of expectation and came out disappointed. I wish to visit this place again someday when there's no rush. I hope this place is really good quality because its surely looks good and is walking distance from my house.

The first thing that strikes about this place are very interesting interiors as if you are in a playground and the food is amazing as well. We were looking for some light food and what struck us was chocolate pizza which tempted us a lot and with reluctance we ordered it. It was chocolate indulgence and was surprisingly light on stomach. Will come again to try the rest of the menu soon. Good job d-talks...amazing experience..

I went with my friends to this place on their 1st anniversary as they offering a great deal on food.
They were offering buffet at Rs.200, so I was already sceptical about the quality of food. Nevertheless we went there expecting good food and ambience. Their rating was also quite high.But what we experienced was far from good. Firstly, they took a lot of time to serve food. Secondly, the food offered was tasteless, and stale. We were served daal when we ordered soup. Overall it was a forgettable experience and I would not recommend this place to anyone.

They were celebrating their first anniversary by giving unlimited food @ Rs 200 as per the coupon I purchased from nearbuy app.But the menu was totally different, chapati rolled with stuff was sold as falafel and shawarma rolls, the chocolate pizza was actually chapati with a filling of chocolate sauce and cheese which was really pathetic. Then they had club sandwiches which were nothing but three layered with cheese and touchings of potato filling which I think any amateur would have prepared better sandwiches.
Coming to their service! Oh boy, that was pity-worthy. That sandwich took a lifetime to reach our table and when we ordered our main course which was Punjabi paneer pasanda and mushroom gravy with masala kulcha( which we have to return as it was not properly baked and when we showed this to one of the waiters, he too laughed at it and offers to exchange). So, instead of having that thing again we asked for veg biryani (yes, they only serve veg food!) and thank god, that was nice but the guy who served the veg biryani to us came with a big bowl of biryani and went to have fun with other waiters which really disrespecting as there was no cutlery on our table and in spite of doing his job he was having fun with other staff.
Never going there again. Until they improve the taste and service quality and staff behaviour. Worst experience ever.
PS: after having such a slow service they asked us to leave by 11:15 pm of which on the app from where we have purchased the coupon, it clearly stated till 11:30 pm, and when we showed the timing on the coupon they were cool with it.
I don't know whether they are here for some business or a time-pass thing.
PPS: NEED A SERIOUS UPGRADE!!

A good place to waste your time by waiting for food. But it has some good item. When i said some that means realy some. Only one item i.e. Crispy baby corn. Apart from this it has all dumb food items. Yes you can try desserts, they are good. But remember it is a good place to waste your time in waiting for food. You have to order very very early (may be about 2hr before) to get food by your expected time.

A vegetarian cafe cum boutique , with an innovative name : D-talks sounding 'detox' which the cafe menu features , all healthy options from detoxifying and protien drinks and whole wheat carbs ranging from wheat pastas to pizza crusts ; Talks synonymous to the bengali word 'Adda' which is an intricate part of cafe culture , the fusion of these words wonderfully  used to name the cafe holds true to what they offer , conversations over healthy eating.
Also very strategically located opposite to Talwarkars (near swimming pool), the cafe is quite alluring for all like minded and calorie conscious customers of the gym to relax after heavy sessions of work out , sipping on a vitamin booster or leisurely munching on some light snacks.
The sports themed interiors , quirky 3d wall arts of footballers and many indoor games , different seating arrangements from low couches , bean bags to high benches with chairs standing on cycle wheels and cricket stumps , hockey stick door handles , cushion beds in a boxing ring and a wall tree book shelf are to be distinctively​ noted.
I am strictly a non vegetarian hogger , but can't skip family imposed exceptions to hindu practices of restricting to vegetarian options on few auspicious days , and health cafes never fails to spot my interest for trials . We were two and could order just three dishes from the menu. The GNOCCI was an innovative start with few potato tikkis in a lipsmacking gnocci sauce , SOYA KEBAB WRAP made of thin whole wheat tortilla was quite dry and bland , served with salad and dips , GAJAR HALWA EMPANADAS had a lucrative colourful plating , were simple brown bread rolled gajar ka halwa drizzled with chocolate syrup on top . Portions would seem to be on the lesser side , unless you are used to VLCD , for the prices charged.

P.s. We asked for water and were charged a bottle of mineral water , thumbs down for that.

Health food is food considered beneficial to human health and a healthy diet required for human nutrition. food marked as healthy may be natural foods, organic foods sometimes vegetarian foods also called as healthy foods. in Calcutta there are few healthy food joints which serves really good healthy foods “D-Talks Adda” is one of them. located BF 31, near swimming pool, Sector -1, Salt Lake Area. here you’ll find various types of healthy juices, protein salads which are quite beneficial for our health. the first thing you will notice the sporty ambiance with quite unique decoration. if you’re a sports lover then this is the place for you. extremely beautiful decorated place with lovely sitting arrangements.

I went there with one of my besties as she said that there's a new cafe that serves only healthy food and it has got taste a well . Though I am not into so much nutritious delicacies however I like being pampered to those kind of dishes if it tastes good . We had a burrito stuffed with brown rice which was sautted with mixed herbs and Indian spices , served with a coleslaw and a dip made from sattoo ( donot remember the English term of it ) , Soya kebabs which was served the same way with dips and coleslaw . For drinks we had two chocolate milk shakes and it tasted good . I loved the burrito however not the kebab since it was a new start up hence found these two out of the box . In regards to the ambience it had a boxing ring , numerous football , cricket personalities which tried to imbibe the feel of a gym or a work out place . Over all the name of the cafe is justified in its true significance however would like to see a variety in case of the menu for those who likes to eat more than soya or brown rice but it's a body builder's den for a hang out .

Proper nutrition is an essential part for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. As physical activities have reduced, thanks to our desk jobs or the educational burden for kids, we tend to miss the optimum balance between food and workouts and end up getting overweight, feel low, get mood swings and become prone to ailments. 

Why I said all this is just because, there is a “Ctrl Z” button to normalize our daily lives. D-Talks Adda is all set to uplift your mood with vibrant colors, board games, innovative and well thought interiors and “Healthy Foods”!! 

As the name “adda” signifies the Kolkata culture, where we feel light hearted after spending quality time with friends, and the same has been replicated in this one of a kind sports café. The interior has been designed with sections dedicated to different sports like football, cricket, boxing, table tennis and so on. The boxing ring ushers you to spend time on it, not for a fight but with available board games. These innovative touch points helps to recover from a dull day at work and gives you a healthy mindset.

Now the food… healthy eating gives you nutrients to maintain your health, make you feel good and gives you lots of energy, and D-Talks Adda has taken this up literary. I tried out few of them and was totally impressed not only with the presentation but also the taste. We all tend to have this preconceived notion that healthy food in not tasty, but D-Talks Adda will change your mindset all together. 

Some of the juices that I tried were: Antioxidant Boost, Iced Mochaccino, Surya Namashkar (Mix Fruits Juice) and Banana Milk Shake, these are healthy and flavoursome at the same time, and you won’t believe that the ingredients are most common vegetables and fruits which we think are “super healthy” and hence we avoid them!!

Now the Soups: Veg Clear Soup and Mushroom Soup – again well-presented, where you can see all the veggies that has been added and of course yummy. And the best part is that, it is served in a mug, which becomes easy to sip even though you are busy in a board game.

Appetizers: Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Paneer Amritsari and Chocolate Pizza. All were up to the mark, as I being a consumer of all kinds of unhealthy food, was feeling happy that I am doing some justice to myself. The chocolate pizza was presented fabulously and was a visual treat.

Main course: Kashmiri Rajma, Paneer Pasanda, Masala Kulcha, Laccha Paratha and Veg Pulao. The freshness of the food could be felt from the first bite itself and also the quality. The quantity served was good and filling. My taste buds are hard-core non-vegetarian, but they were really enjoying it.

And finally the dessert: Apple Crepe and Fruit Ice Cream. By now I was full, thanks to the wonderful service, hospitality and personal care taken by the D Talks Adda team, but could not stop myself from having these conclusive dishes. The apple crepe will remind you of the “patishapta” from its looks, but it tasted totally different. The fruit ice-cream came with a generous serving of healthy fruits and in house ice creams. 

I wish D Talks Adda Team all the very best for putting up such a great show, keep up the good work!!

D-Talks in Salt Lake is a new sports-themed cafe that boasts of serving healthy vegetarian food. The first thing I noticed here was the fun decor. From sports personalities on the wallpapers, to a seating section in a boxing ring - D-Talks is absolutely lovely for a relaxed time with friends. Plus, the incorporation of different sports-related elements, like cycle-wheel seats, shuttle-cock lamps, etc. makes the place quirky - there's something uplifting in the ambience.

Coming to the food - I tried a number of their items, starting with their freshly squeezed fruit juices. Among the starters and mains, I quite liked the gnocchi and nachos. The desserts were also quite mouth-watering.
Considering this place is a health cafe, I found a little too much carb on the menu. As a vegetation place, its sources of proteins mostly include lots of carbs. I must acknowledge their efforts to make things healthy, like using stevia instead of sugar for the juices, opting to bake instead of frying, replacing regular oil with ghee, adding certain elements like drumsticks to increase the nutritional value, antioxidants, etc. in the dishes, etc. However, there are certain things that I found missing. Every person on a diet has specific food needs, and D Talks offers no option to pick dishes according to the diet one wants to follow. There are no macro breakups on the menu. Their options and their details need to be increased.
Aside from these, the place was quite a fun hangout zone. Plus, the portions of the dishes are big enough to keep the diners busy for a long time.

How many of you consider healthy food to be tasteless? I know, most of you consider this to be true. Infact, I myself had a similar notion which got completely shattered during my recent visit at D-Talks Adda. This is a beautiful sports themed restaurant in Salt Lake whose expertise lies in preparing healthy yet delicious food.

I was invited here for a food tasting session, specially to try the new menu which is going to be launched soon. The place has been beautifully decorated with different types of seating arrangements. One can engage into several games and activities, and also into reading books. The graffiti on the wall adds to the charm of the place.

I've been to quite a few healthy food based restaurants and what I've hated the most is their drinks. Mostly those are tasteless, bland and awful. So, I wasn't confident to try the mocktails which were served here. But I was quite amazed to notice that the presentation was pretty good. I started with Surya Namaskar which was a beautiful blend of pineapple and watermelon. Being a health drink, this didn't deprive me from the sweetness I desire in a mocktail. The drink was sweetened using stevia, which is a natural sweetener with zero calories, and the usage of sugar was strictly avoided. This was followed by Antioxidant Boost, which was prepared using drumstick leaves, the role of which is to detoxify our body. This was flavoured using mint and lime to give a wonderful tangy taste. The Banana Milk Shake and Iced Mochaccino were good as well, where once again stevia was used. Thus, even health conscious people can give these a try without worrying about the calorie intake.

The soups were as amazing as the drinks. My favourite was the Mushroom Soup. It was rich and consistent. It was tangy and slightly spicy as well. The Veg Clear Soup had juicy veggies in a clear broth. It tasted subtle and aromatic. The soups were served in a cup instead of a bowl. So you can have it with a spoon or sip it directly from the cup.

The Chocolate Pizza, which came next, looked stunning. The base was prepared using whole wheat. Two slices were sandwiched with a layer of molten chocolate in between. The topping was done using feta cheese, which has the lowest amount of calories among all variants of cheese. Finally a caramel cage was placed on top, which displayed the effort and beauty in the artwork ! The pizza was delicious, with chocolate oozing out of it.

The next appetizers were Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Paneer Amritsari. Firstly, these were air fried with very little usage of oil. And secondly, ajinamoto was not used in any of these preparations. The babycorn was light, crispy and slightly sweet. The panner was crispy and well fried. I particularly loved the mint and mustard sauce, which complemented it really well.

Moving on to the main course, the Laccha Paratha and Masala Kulcha were perfectly done. The kulcha was stuffed with carrots, cauliflower, cabbage, etc and tasted delicious. The breads were accompanied with Kashmiri Rajma and Paneer Pasanda. Needless to say, both the dishes tasted beautiful and the preparations were distinctly different from one another. The Veg Pulao was sweet, and the sides went perfectly with it.

I was too full for the desserts but they had some amazing options to offer, which looked delectable. The Fruit Ice Creams were home made and tasted brilliant. They were sweetened with stevia and the sweetness was parallel to any other fruit ice cream available in the market. You won't regret having a healthy ice cream. The Apple Crepe tasted heavenly with juicy apple chunks. These gave a wonderful end to an amazing meal.

Overall, D-Talks Adda is one such place that will help you restore your faith in healthy food. There is ample space for you to relax and chill with some delicious food. Moreover you can order anything and still not worry about your health. The owners have made a lot of research and then have come up with this place, which is way ahead of all other such restaurants in the city in almost all aspects. So if you're looking for some healthy food, give D-Talks Adda a visit soon.

D Talks Adda is one among the ‘still fairly novel’ Health Food Restaurants in Kolkata. I say ‘still fairly novel’ because the onset of health joints begun in Kolkata some years back and now there are now a couple of options to satiate the health buff in you. This meant that this restaurant also faced the challenge of getting into a territory which was new, yet Kolkatans had a taste of it.

We always want to eat the best and go to the most amazing places in and around without thinking twice about health hazards .Yes the truth is that we consume a lot of food which restaurants/cafes don’t really bother about the after effects of one’s health.Excess amount of oil or sugar intake can seriously cause harm to the human body,even you know that but probably like always you wont pay any attention to it . Similarly like you or anyone i also have the same habit of not caring much about it and to be honest it’s next to impossible to find places which are providing a control and alternative in ingredients change.However off late i visited a place called ‘D-TALKS ADDA’ in Saltlake city,Kolkata which has taken a step in changing this thing by keeping a check on excess or absolute intake.Now if you are going to wonder how and what will the food taste like, then the answer to it is simply that here food is baked mostly in the menu items given and some have less oil or desi ghee sourced from Hariyana .There is Stevia instead of sugar added as a sweetener and for a better detox process Moringa oleifera does the job.Does that sound pretty good ? Now if it doesn’t then to make it sound good ,let me break in the interesting part which is the taste of the food and drinks here. And you will be surprised to know it maintains the deliciousness and flavour balance in the food and drinks both even after cutting off the excess stuff and applying the alternative health benefit ingredients.But my concern over here is going to be that how people are going to accept this place as a healthy place ? Well till date people believed in eating clean,but never really wanted to give this kind of a scene where our regular consumed food will have a change in ingredients for our good,so probably i would say it is a place close to being healthier than before as the Carbohydrates levels present in food is a little high for a health food claimed place. So saying that i can recommend this place not just as a healthy eating place but you can consider this like the places you go as always ,but don’t tell your brain and heart that it takes care of your health replacing regular ingredients that they crave for (Poor joke but appropriate).

The USP of this place is that every item is well cooked in a healthy manner retaining the spicy taste and prompt service.Calm and Cozy !!

I am writing in brief of what we had :-1)Wheat Laccha with Paneer Tikka Masala - (5/5) Jhakkas
2)Mixed Sauce Pasta - (4/5) Loved it
3)Lemon Amla Green Tea - (3/5) Just to taste
4)Pizza Boat Sandwich - (3/5) Good but not worth of its penny :p
5)Knocci - (3/5) It was actually aloo tikki.It had good taste 
6)Sunday Special Ice Cream - (3/5) Filled with Dry Fruits 
7)Vannila Filled Biscuit Ice Cream with Chocolate Topping - (5/5) Wowwwwwwwwwwww

Although a bit over-priced but you will love this place if you are a vegan. The pizza boat sandwich and open faced Sandwich were awesome. I loved the special bubble tea as well. All in all a good experience if you are looking for a vegetarian place to Chill in salt lake. The boxing ring decor, the quotes on the wall and the interiors are superb no doubt.

Eating out these days often seems pretty scary, especially for food bloggers like me. Well, you can hopefully guess the reason. The ingredients that the restaurants are using can cause serious damage to your body in the long term. The momentary explosion of joy for your taste buds doesn’t always guarantee a nutrient-rich healthy meal. Also it’s not always eating good, it’s about not eating the unhealthy ingredients as well. And at eateries you can not always get into their kitchen to check what they are using to cook your meal. And often, we tend to ignore these factors when we plan to eat out. But slowly with increase in health issues and ailments worldwide, people are becoming more conscious about what they are consuming. It’s not only necessary to work-out; the major element that can keep you fit and healthy is your food and beverages. Recently I was invited by a café in the Saltlkae Sector-1 area for a food sampling session, called D Talks Adda and immediately after receiving the mail it struck me that the work’D Talks’ must be actually meaning ‘detox’. When I confirmed with the owner, he said my assumption was correct, and I was immediately interested as this was one place that promises to detox and revive your body and soul, paired with some awesome ambiance fitting for a great adda session.

What you eat in private becomes what you wear in public, said one of the walls in D Talks Adda.
And how true! :D Living in Kol means having access to some really delicious food, be it street or high end which unfortunately resulted in a good amount of weight gain for me :(
So recently I have been on a quest to find the healthy foods in the city which brought me here.

As for the ambience it's a cute little place overall. Ordered masala tea and Lebanese falafel wrap. The tea was good but the Lebanese wrap gets extra points for keeping the taste very balanced and the humus served with it had a unique taste too.
My friend ordered a Mexican wrap and a banana shake. The Mexican wrap was just OK to be honest but that could be because I'm not a big fan of kidney beans and also unsure of whether they should be inside a Mexican wrap! :D
The banana smoothie was good too. Later we also ordered pesto pasta which was good on palette but a little too much on the the creamier side for my liking.

The service was prompt and the staff is friendly.
Total pocket pinch was 994. They also have a tie up with eWards which means you save money by earning credits every time you visit.
I would surely be visiting them again to try their other other items.

I don't know why my friend and I agreed to drop by at this place. I am very particular about the places I choose to go out to and since this place had good ratings (which seem like a huge farce at this moment) we agreed upon this place. A huge mistake! 

When we entered, we saw that there was nobody in the cafe. No one. Seemed liked we were the first customers of the day. We ordered an Alfredo Pasta, Tandoori Paneer Tikka, Cold Coffee, and Chocolate Shake. The only things we liked were the coffee and the shake and that's the reason this place has gotten a rating of 2. The pasta sucked, was too sweet and we had to add tons of oregano and chilli flakes to make it edible. The Paneer tikka was hard and tasteless. The worst ever. I don't know how this cafe is still open. With this kind of food, they won't last long. Our bill came up to 850 for 4 items!  Overpriced place and terrible.

Do something about what you are offering to your diners! Bad experience. :/

Why can't Kolkata have more of these themed based cafes? Amazing ambience, extremely supportive staff and amazing food. Have always been hesitant of walking into an all-veg place :P But the pasta was really amazing and so were the fresh juices. They need an aggressive campaign to make themselves popular, otherwise places like these will die out quickly. Hopefully they will start this!

I was rather disappointed being here after seeing all the positive reviews on Zomato. I am ready to pay for healthy eating if the food tastes decently but clearly this cafe didn't offer anything great to us. I had ordered a cold coffee which had too much ice, sugar and milk with minimal coffee. Ordered their mini pizzas which were just 4 micro circular breads topped with a lot of stuff but just tasted extremely hot because of the heartfelt amount of chili flakes it had. Ordering just these two items came with a bill of Rs.357 so it clearly isn't a value-for-money place either.

The main course dish of Amritsari Kulcha and Chola also tasted very good. The use of olive oil in their preparations makes the food healthy too. Service was very good and prompt. Will visit again.

So, I have been to this place earlier also. It was not great then but looking at the recent reviews we went ahead with the plan.
The location, decor and service is good. The seating arrangement is comfortable. 
The idea of this restaurant is also nice but the problem is implementation. 
4 out of 6 items we selected from the menu were out of stock.
From the food we got, Falafel wrap was good but the pizza was stale !! The staff agreed that the bread has become stale. (At a healthy food joint, we are served stale food)
There in-house pasta was so creamy and so cheesy that 4 hours after dinner at there restaurant, I am bound to write this negative review feeling all uneasy, heavy and therefore cheated in the name of healthy food. 
I have got this hunch now that there ratings on Zomato might be rigged.
The owners need to pay more attention to save this place.

Chilli paneer is too sweet, otherwise it's quite ok. Price is comparatively normal and is delivery is also fine. Also, we ordered for chutney but were not offered.. instead we were given some random chilly sauce which was not at all good . It was not at all  satisfactory and we were not very happy with the food . We advice them to Increase the spice in the food.

When you order their lunch box, they give very little sabzi to go with if. When you ask them to give more sabzi for an extra charge, they give you half the quatity of the already less quantity. The customer relation is very bad. When you ask them to send you another box, they say that's the quantity we give every time. Sad to see good businesses go down because of uncompetitive staff.

Finally, a place where you can get healthy food. Was becoming rather tired of scanning the menu for the lowest calorie options possible in other restaurants.

I mostly get my breakfast home-delivered from this place - the Bombay Grilled Sandwich, the Chilli Paneer Wrap, the Paneer Shawarma Wrap, the North Indian Chholey Wrap : all are absolutely delicious, and considerably low on calorie count.

Physically went to the restaurant only once - the Dugna Lagaan (smoothie) and Lemon Ladies were absolute revelations. Especially the Dugna Lagaan smoothie - a yogurt based drink that delicious? Kudos!

The Pasta Alfredo was disappointing though. Atta pasta prepared in their own kitchen for the health factor, yet the white sauce was so very rich and creamy, that it sort of beat the purpose. Maybe a slightly healthier version of the pasta in white sauce next time?

In any case, a laudable effort for health conscious people! Thanks a lot!

A quaint little place at the food hub of Salt Lake. The place boasts of a unique menu and an amazing interior. The staff are super friendly and the food is healthy and tasty which is a very rare combination. They serve keeping in kind the health quotient so you won't get any flour(maida) or mozzarella. Every flour dish is made using wheat flour thereby increasing the health quotient. The gnocchi and the pizza were superb. The sandwiches were also decent really like the warm vegetable salad which is a wholesome meal in itself. They serve good with feta cheese which is a really healthy option. All in all a great experience. Would like to try their combo meals next.

Hands down, one of the most interestingly and lovingly done up restaurants I've seen in Kolkata. The 2 running themes are sports and romance, with health/nutrition thrown in of course. Visit to see the interesting use of space and quirky pieces of furniture. Surprisingly, we were the only ones that evening so we had the staff's full attention. No major complaints with the food. Some of the dishes were good concepts but I felt they missed the mark taste-wise. Ex: fruity shots of pani puri & zucchini rolls. The more conventional fare of alfredo pasta & bombay grill was more fun and better done. The menu is innovative enough. There is a lot of potential here, especially if the board games were in good enough shape to be played ;)

Overview & Decor :- This recently opened veg cafe (opened in august 2016) is one of the most innovative outlets i have ever been too..it is completely a sports themed restaurant wherein u get to sit in a couch resembling a boxing ring , or chairs with the stands made up of cricket bats and wickets..the decor deserves appreciation beyond words..

Food :- Well their catalogue is as diverse as it gets and i have not seen the dishes they have in too many places...they are one of their kind...The dishes as well as the presentation and preparation are absolutely unique and one u must not miss..We had ordered :- 1) Brain Booster Fruit Shots served in test tubes :D 2)Gnocci ( A type of tikki pasta in red sauce) 3)Feta Cheese Pizza (5 tiny pizza pieces with a feta cheese and veggie topping)...Each of the dishes were really delicious and we enjoyed every bit of what we had...Do try the item nos. 2 and 3 mentioned above which are infact their special dishes..

Staff Behaviour & Service :- Staffs are extremely well behaved,listen to u,recommend dishes and serve u really well...service was perfect....the staffs are well informed about the dishes in the menu as well which i see missing in many places these days where the staffs are clueless as to what we are asking for,despite the dish being there on the menu..

Pricing & Quantity :- The prices on the menu card are inclusive of taxes and u don't have to pay any extra tax....you pay what u see on the catalogue...personally i would have liked a little more quantity per dish and considered reducing 0.5 because of that but then i am too impressed with the uniqueness,food quality and service to not give 5..they also gave us 2 complementary bottles of fruit water which was also something new..

Note :- The only problem is that it is located a bit in the interior of salt lake and not in an area buzzing with people..i am not sure if that will affect them but this cafe surely has the potential to be one of the best and most popular in salt lake..if you are going towards ultadanga from karunamoyee..then take a left turn from the CIP camp island and it isnt far from there..pleaseee do try this outlet...its amazing.

This is the place other than home where you get healthy AND more importantly tasty food!

I came in on a Friday evening and there was a live band performance going on and I had the time of my life first listening to them perform and then joining them for a couple of songs as well! I spoke to the management and it seems that they call bands quite often and they also show all the big games on the TV (well its a sports cafe!)

I didnt think that healthy food could be tasty until I went here. I had the mini pizza which was pretty good. They manage to keep it healthy by using feta cheese on it.
I also had the livable salad which was actually an innovative way to keep a salad tasty, healthy and in quick bites.
Do try some of their health drinks, I sipped from different drinks out of my friend's glasses and they all were well prepared with different flavours.


In general, the presentation for all their dishes are quite nice.

Coming to the ambience, I was quite impressed by the various seating arrangements and the things to do there. While your wait for your order to come, you have an option to play chinese checkers mounted on the wall, have a throw at darts, watch different sport's matches on the TV or just chill inside the boxing ring or astro turf seating area.

Its a very innovative concept and first of its kind in Kolkata!

I strongly recommend to all sports lovers as its everything you need: sporty ambience, matches playing on the TV and healthy food to keep you fit!

I heard They recently launched to juice that tastes and looks like beer!! Im eager to try that out in my next visit!

They missed 0.5 only because they serve only pure Veg!  😜

But all in all, its an enjoyable experience and I think everyone should at least visit once to enjoy the chill, relaxing and one of a kind experience they offer!!

Colourful theme based interior, perfect for taking pictures and fixing your mood. Coming to food, its the perfect blend of mouthwatering flavours 😋 so is the mocktails. Staff do good work and they are hot too. 😜 Infact they voted for me and help me win a contest! So.. HAPPINESS is a place like this ❤😍

Nowadays, there are a slew of healthy food joints in the city, and i decided to give this one a shot as it is located in my locality. The first thing which stuck me was a bxing ring having comfy sofas with a huge sketch of the legendary mohammad ali !! Then there were rows of high stools with pedals in them.... highly impressive! We ordered a mexican platter comprising of mexican soup (light and tasty), mexican rice ( superb), rajma burritos (excellent) and a sweet crepe( unique and tasty)... we polished it off with a hit brewing cup of coffee.... they also have a small boutique side by side,those interested can buy beautiful pullovers,comic t shirts, kurtis from there.... i am definitely paying a visit once again.

the menu is quite vast and varied. on my last visit checked their meals menu as well, it's wholesome. 
We particularly like paneer shawarma, rajma burritos. my son's favourite is mini feta cheese pizza, now my fav also
the owners say they keep adding new delicacies every now and then based on the customer feedback, as long as they can prepare with healthy ingredients and preparations
their breakfast menu is to die for

Went with 4 more friends and ordered the paneer tikka, and the mexican balls - we swear by meat and seafood but were quite pleasantly surprised with taste.The ambiance is really good with a wrestling ring to just lie about in, or sit by the counter for a great refreshing mocktail. They have anti oxidant boosts too! Try it soon. you won't regret it.

While having conversation with the staff, we also came to know that they are not using sugar rather using the healthy alternatives to make the dishes sweet and healthy. 
Highly recommended place to go...

In my views place is really good in terms of everything specially for interior, I don't think you will find such type of interior anywhere. Since we are giving feedback about a restaurant than it can't be complete without talking about food. I believe people who want taste with health will definitely love to go there. Basically maintaining the taste without using extra ordinary oil and spices is the USP of D-talk Adda. Kudos for that....At last... everyone should try atleast once, than you can decide at your own.

Went to this small café near swimming pool. The interiors are like a fitness club. Grass floors, a boxing ring and colourful interiors. Coming to the food, I had a French Onion soup and a salad (the live salad). Loved the salad. It was fresh, the vegetables were crunchy and the vegetables were in equal proportion too. The soup was good to taste, but usually a French Onion soup is more creamier and there is usually a garlic bread dunked in the soup. But keeping in mind the theme of the restaurant, I would say the soup was warm, healthy and comforting.

I did here what I do when I visit any restaurant- ask for the chef special! This place always surprises me with the special dishes and drinks they offer. 

Latest check out for the chocolate pasta, live salads and the special breakfast menu

So wonderful to have a place like this in Kolkata.  No sugar, no oil!  These two naughty items are at the core of so many health problems.  Of course they taste good, but you will pay for it later as your body gets to be frankenstein for the modern medical and pharmiceutical industries.

Anyway, the food here is creative and yummy and can be eaten with a clear mind knowing that you won't be bringing pain to yourself in the future. The menu is huge and interesting, showing off all the tastes one can savour in life minus the nasty duo of sugar and oil.

Ambience is sporty and playful, with a large rack of games and entertainment if you feel like killing an hour or two with a friend, munching healthy and interesting food bytes while you chess or checker it out.

Bravo DTalks!  There is so much more to food than indulgence.

This could also be called as a sports deck, the ambience is related to different sports theme. Pocket friendly. Diet conscious. Went there for breakfast. Staffs were cooperative and welcoming. Food was delicious. Calm place. We had ordered Mexican platter, which consisted of wrap, juice, salad, sandwiches, as well as cutlet, mini pizza,  cold coffee. Quantity and quality are too good. 
A must visit place.
Highly recommended 
Cheers!

Amazing place to be with friends or colleagues..fun places to sit around have fun with board games..sitting arrangements are nicely done. Coming to the food..its a strictly veg place but a healthy one. They don't serve any junk food. Their food are non fried..free of oil butter and cheese. No Maida...they use atta for wraps. The food is very innovative and uniquely plated. Taste wise its good..I'm sure for any all veges these items would be yumm...but cant say that being a hard core non vege. Pocket friendly if u have a large groupto go with. We ordered phuchka shots..wraps...zucini wraps..veg kebabs..filling alu...roti sabzi and veg biryani...it was good taste. Good place to hang around with health conscious friends.

This is an awesome place. Made for people who are looking for delicious healthy food. My favourite is the popsicle amongst many other great dishes. This is worth a visit and your time. Brilliant service and brilliant ambience. Kids enjoy it as much as us. I am also a regular there when the football matches are on. So if you like watching those epl matches, you might get good company there!

My friend recommended me this delicious gem while I was in Kolkata.  After too many typical restaurant meals, D talks Adda was a fantastic alternative. The food was wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing and the fresh juices were incredible. I tried apple crepe and bubble tea. Both were amazing. Fruit cubes and bhapa doi were equally great.

This is the perfect place to bring your kids or a business associate who is tired of luxury restaurants, but still is picky on what they eat. Can't wait to go back and try a few of their breakfast options - and of course more delicious healthy raw treats.

Went here today with my family. A great place to go with family and friends. You can spend nice quality time. Ambeince is superb. Kudos to whoever thought of the various ideas!! 
This is a helath cafe and they actually mean when they say its healthy food. By talking to the owner i understood that they actually gave lot of thought and research inwhat food they would serve and how so that its totally helthy yet appealing. And the best part is that they are constantly researching and reinventing. 
A fun place to be and yummy food they have to offer!! 
A must try for everyone!

Visited the cafe with my kids and we loved the experience. Loved the concept which is new to the city , a healthy food menu and interiors on sports theme. The boxing rink seating area is awesome but my favourite would be the reading area.
The food is delightful, filling and the best part- it doesnt make u feel guilty even after hogging like a pig ;) 
The rajma corn tikki, bombay sandwhich, zuccini rolls are yumm. My kids loved the chocolate milkshake and i enjoyed the bhag milkha bhag smoothie. It was fresh and fruity. 
Keep up the good work Dtalks Adda!

You can spot this in the popular swimming pool zone of Salt Lake. Though it's a Sunday the place wasn't thronged at all. It was very easy for our group of 9 to get a cosy seat for "adda" inside.
Quite spacious,vegetarian joint offering indoor games. Service was not that great, it took them surprisingly longer to serve tea.
The tea was really refreshing with a tinge of elaichi flavor. For me it was a li'l high on the sugar but no one else complained. So I guess it would vary.
The ordered finger food includes Tandoori Paneer Wrap and Mediterranean Wrap. The Mediterranean Wrap was stuffed with a mix of cabbage,carrots and onions. The taste was average.
Complementary indoor games options are there like Ludo,Dart,Jenga,etc.
f you want to have a laid back evening with no intention of gorging on interesting dishes, you might consider of hopping in here.

D Talks should sound like "Detox" when you're pronouncing it. A sports themed restaurant, not a cafe. They have tried to carve out a between line when it comes to healthy and Indian food. They are a fusion food restaurant. 
It is a vegetarian restaurant but include eggs as part of their breakfast menu. Run by two brothers, these guys know so much about their food, its almost like you see their vision. 

The mocktails are all meaning inspired, and have additional benefits. They will take you through the menu, and explain what comes after what! 
On the food part, stay tuned for their newest menu here:

Location - Opposite to famous talwakars gym near swimming pool area of saltlake.

Ambience - The ambience is surely to fall in love with. Varieties of seating arrangements. Option to play dart games and many other games. Few books are also there.

Service - Trained staff and excellent service.

Food Ordered & Description - 
Early morning craving for breakfast and I straight away took the help of zomato for places opened at that time near my home. I found this new place opens at 8am for breakfast. So thought of trying it. 
The menu is here is extensive. It is health cafe and in most items are not fried, no oil or butter or cheese or Maida is used. It means guilt free eating. Just loving it. Coming to food :
Rajma Corn Tikka : This dish is new and different in taste. The dish is very tasty. A must try dish. But I missed the mint Chutney with it.
Lebanese Falafel Wrap - Excellent taste. Again a must try dish. 
Cottage Cheese Sandwich : One of the odd average dish. The taste was not to my liking.
Antioxidant Boost : Healthy drink with high on mint flavour. 
Peanut Butter Milkshake : Again a master piece. On the 1st sip it is not likeable. Very high on flavour. But with each sip I start luving it. Strictly not for those who dnt like peanuts.
Overall amazing experience. Highly recommended

Lovely place with a lot of positiveness and cozy corners. 

Bright ambience and comfy arrangements to spend hours reading, chatting, networking with a lot of healthy food. 

So eat on guilt free and the innovative names of each serving on the menu is eye catching. 

Adding some Non Vegetarian finger food on the menu should fetch them a 5/5. 

Cheers!

Quirky and Bright interiors. And illuminated place with good set of board games available! Food is nice. But , I will suggest to add on more options in the menu. The Popsicles were too cold for the teeth and perhaps needs to be more flavoured. Staff is courteous and prompt. Overall a happy place to be with friends.

Its a NO MAIDA, NO BUTTER, NO FRIED Adda, but you won't feel the difference in taste.. Its so yummy! Bhaag milkha bhaag(smoothie), fruit sticks & Paneer kathi rolls are my favorite :D 
And there are lots of things to do like there are books, board/card games, darts and then there is this huge spray painted wall for selfies ;)

Well.... I tried zucchini roll, peanut butter milkshake and popsicle. One must try zucchini roll and popsicle for sure!

This place is barely 2-3 mins from my place and is located very near to CAP Camp. It is very new and it has just been a week since its opening.  My friends and I thought of giving this place a try. I love the ambience and the decor of this place. The place has games, comfortable seating and innovative walls. We had ordered Burritos, Spinach Paneer Triangle,Chocolate Shakes and Banana Shake. Everything their tastes good and is very healthy. Burrito wrap was made out of whole wheat flour( aata) which made it even more healthy. The sandwiches are served in brown bread and the shakes were yummy too.  This is a place for every healthy foodie. The only suggestion I would like to make is please increase the quantity of your food and beverages. It is tasty but not filling. I've been to places which have almost the same price but the quantity served is pretty decent. Overall I loved the place :)
