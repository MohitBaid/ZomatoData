Extremely pocket friendly place, and naturally, almost always crowded. Their Rumali Rotis are quite nice, and paired with their spicy, tangy Dry Chilli Chicken, it's just happiness on your platter. Their Mixed Chowmein is also pretty tasty and the quantity is humongous. At a price this low, I am sure you won't find better food elsewhere in Santoshpur. Above average food, definitely, but hey, gotta deal with the crowd, buddy!!!

This place is a hot take away food joint at the heart of santoshpur , located just adjacent to the santoshpur lake. There is no provision for dining but you can parcel some delightful treats at a fraction of what would have pinched your pocket had you been at a similar eatery nearby. From Chinese to Indian to moghlai , every item on their menu is jam packed with flavours , and will definitely keep your taste buds busy. Tried most of what they have to offer , as it is just minutes away from my grandparents place and is a popular choice for a family lunch or dinner when the maid is off work. They make some splendid rolls and you can actually feel the freshness of every ingredient that goes into it's making , thanks to its huge turnover on a daily basis which leaves them with no other choice to introduce fresh produce into their daily routine. All this for a very nominal price , the cozy book is certainly my recommendation for takeaway orders but be patient if you visit it on weekends or public holidays , as you might have to tackle a tough queue to get your order heard by the very limited staff members that they have.

Dry Chilli Chicken,  DalTadka, Roomali Rooti and Biryani - Their evergreen and most popular items. Small takeaway joint. Always crowded. If quick bites are your priority, trust me. This is probably the best in the region.

It's a small takeaway joint at santoshpur shibmandir  bus stop which is quite famous among the fast food lovers. Have parceled food at many occasions. Chicken noodles are really good to taste and portion size is quite large. The chicken rolls are good too. For daily stuffs,  roti and tarkas are okay types. Service is good.

This is a small take away joint near Santoshpur Lake. Being a resident of this area, I'm a very frequent visitor of this place. I mostly have snacks over here in the evening, which include Fish Finger, Fish Fry, Chicken Cutlet, Chicken Roll, etc. Chicken roll is fairly good, with enough pieces of chicken, and it is the best in this area. Fish Finger & Fish Fry are tasty too, but once or twice out of my innumerous visits, they have served us with stale food, but it was eatable.

I've also had dinner quite a few number of times, and the dishes that I've include Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Rice, Hot Garlic Chicken, Chicken Kasha, Pan Fried Chilli Chicken, etc. The quantity is enough for two people if your appetite is normal. The quality is fair considering it is just a road-side take-away joint.

One thing you must keep in mind before visiting this joint is, don't plan to sit and eat over here. This is just a take-away joint.

One of the best take away in santoshpur area. Their service is fast. According to me their best dish is dry chili chicken. Its worth a try. The other Chinese options are also quite okay. Never tried their Indian options. Would like to taste them well. :-)

I wasn't actually hungry, but sometimes I feel the urge of tasting noodles/chow mein. Don't ask why. Today the urge was at the peak. I was so desperate that I was willing to sample out from the roadside stalls. And then my eyes fell on Cozy Nook.
I have passed by it without giving it a second glance. But today it was different. I parked my car on the opposite side of the road and crossed the road across towards it.
It is a refined road side stall actually. A man who is the manager showed me the menu. Indian, Chinese, Tibetan- it claimed to serve the cuisines of all these.
Any, I had come to purchase noodles, which I did. I asked for mixed gravy chow and the manager immediately shouted out the order.
It is a small place with no sitting arrangement, a takeaway joint actually. The cooking area is covered with transparent glass through which we could see cooks doing their job by donning shower caps on their heads. Besides them there is a separate unit which only prepares chapattis and tandoori rotis. This is situated in the open air and as far as I could see, is very much popular.
My food came some 10 minutes later. In well sealed parcels. The manager explained that gravy has been put in a separate parcel. I paid and took it home. The price is also reasonable.
As soon as I reached home, we opened the parcels. First one contained the noodles - well boiled, plain, bland and white. The second one contained the gravy. Not a bad idea actually. We could pour the gravy according to our likings and requirements.
The noodles tasted quite delicious and according to our tastes. I would have loved if tissue paper and sauces, but doesn't matter much since the food is delicious and the service is prompt .

I have had lots of dinners here since it's inception. For the past few years they have been preparing momo which is ok. But for me, the only thing I love to have here is Egg Fried Tadka. It's quite reasonable and if you are a college goer living away from your house this place is a life saver for all those study nights.

This place on zomato?!?!

Have been a regular here for rolls and just rolls for the past 3-4 years. They have recently introduced momos which has been a big hit at Santoshpur!

I am yet to try the filler items because this place is so near and dear that we end up getting rolls at every possible meet up with friends at the lake. Oh and I also like the fish finger that they serve here. Although the info mentions 'dine in available' but the place is very small and you should rather take away whatever it is that you want, at a pocket friendly price and eat in peace at home. Visit if you stay at Santoshpur and still have not. Nothing amazingly spectacular about this place, just a nice little place near home which serves food fast :)

Really now....I love the fact that cozy nook is in Zomato.
Good  for take away, though not many special recipes out of this place.
I love their chicken tikia and chilly chicken,of which I found the former best amongst others that I have tasted.
Biryanis needs to be a bit more juicy,and needs improvement in the comparatively bland dishes...like mushroom chicken.
I almost visit them regularly,so guys....will visit again.!!

I've been living on their take-away for about a year and it's really nice to find Cozy Nook listed here. I guess I must have tried everything on their menu by now. The review is-- decent food at decently listed rates. No frills. I haven't fallen ill from eating their food so I'm assuming the hygiene quotient isn't too bad either.
I like the lemon chicken they make. Also, I feel they make one of the best rolls in the neighbourhood. I wouldn't recommend their momos though. So, if you're at Santoshpur and living out, out with friends or living on a tight budget, Cozy Nook will not let you down. Give it a dekko, i'd say.

Can't believe this place is on Zomato. This is the take away place for everyone, love the friendly attitude, and the food is available whenever we want them. On my trips to Santoshpur this is the only place we rely on when everything fails. "Cozy Nook will be open" is the line that keeps up our hopes. I'm sure you've tried this place if you stay near Santoshpur or Jadavpur, there's nothing special about it, it just is our favorite place to take away food because we have been taking food away from this place for like forever.
