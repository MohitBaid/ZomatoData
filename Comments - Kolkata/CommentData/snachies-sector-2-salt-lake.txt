Today i ordered 1 plate steam and 1 plate fried momo. They were not upto the mark at all. The feeling was all mashed up and there was bo traces of chicken. Greatly dissapointed.

The closest food joint to where I live and hence I'm a commoner to this place.

The have two tables laid out in the open if you want to sit and have your food. Otherwise they deliver amazingly fast.

The menu is pretty limited. They have stuck to primary Chinese and other than that some Indian styled fries.

Coming to the quantity and quality of food, all their items come in huge potions (difficult to finish for one person at a time) and tastewise they won't disappoint you. They might not offer you high class Chinese but the outcome on your plate will leave you satisfied.

Their chicken roll, chicken gravy noodles, chicken sezchuan , chicken Manchurian, mixed fried rice, chicken kabiraji and fish finger are my go-to-dishes.

Menu is a little limited one but very quick home delivery service and good food. Try their momos, chicken roll, soup, fish fingers.Value for money.

Located in a residential area in BK Block, itâ€™s a small fast food joint. Serves mainly Chinese, momos & rolls. However, not much to choose from.  Food is kinda ok. Pretty reasonable. Quick delivery.
