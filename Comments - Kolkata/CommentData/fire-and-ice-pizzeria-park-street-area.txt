Mostly the place gives food and I have never really had much issue when we visit the restaurant! Try ordering the chocolate mousse to be delivered at home and you will be amazed that for 320 bucks they literally send you 3 spoons of the dessert! Absolutely astonishing!

One of the first fine dining pizzerias in kolkata. Was a favourite diner since childhood. Tried their halfmushrroms- half caramelised pizzas. The pizzas are thin crust. Their garlic bread is also awesome and the fresh lime soda is a good drink to digest. The staff is friendly.

Total waste of money! As a pizza lover, if in any circumstance I have to choose between eating pizza there or giving up pizza, I would prefer giving up pizza! The bread was burnt and hard. The inside was empty. The pizza was as thin as a leaf! It was a total disaster! Other pizza places are much better. The atmosphere is good, I must admit. I didn't try any drink, so I can't say about that. But anyway I'm never going there again.

Probably the best pizza in town! And the most authentic one according to me.
Ambience- high end Italian. Lovely!
Order- 1 large pizza and 1 apple pie.
Food-- no complaints really. Amazing food. The pizza is very filling and the taste is unmatched! Apple pie was also nice.
Pocket pinch-- very expensive. Just these 2 dishes cost us more than 1500 INR!
Overall-- the food is amazing but wish it was a bit easier on the pockets. The heavenly pizza however soothes down the pocket burn a bit!üòã

I have been visiting this restaurant since years, may be more than 10 years now. the service and food quality is maintained.

The Pizza server here is among the best in the city. best part is they are consistent.

Located near a metro station, it is easily accessible, however, parking one's car could be a trouble here.

The ambience is nice with not so loud music.

A perfect place for dinner at Pizzeria.

One of the few quiet places in the city you would find on a Saturday evening. I've visited this place 2 or 3 times, by myself all the times. I haven't seen much footfall here. That makes it a great place to enjoy an evening alone or with your partner. I wouldn't comment on the food as I'm not a pretty good judge of the Italian cuisine. All I know is their food tastes good!

I felt like cheated giving 420 RS extra from 540 Rs food,almost extra  80% of the food price, Better avoid.

Situated in the Park Street area, Fire and Ice Pizzeria beautifully brings Italian flavours to Kolkata. The place is spacious, unpretentious and good for catching up with friends. The Italian score in the background just added to the mood.
We ordered a Fire of Bengal Pizza and was not disappointed. Thin crust, succulent pieces of spicy mutton bathed in green chillies and mozzarella. However, the coriander leaves were not available. We paired it with lemonade which was nothing special though. The pizza was pure indulgence and having a single fare retains the palate. Helpful staff. Overall a good experience.
Looking forward to visit again to try the other fares.

I guess having tasted authentic Italian cuisine right in the heart of Italy, I've become highly particular of the places I go to try Italian in India.

With many establishments, mushrooming and promising authenticity, I still stuck by visiting city's old favourite Italian haunt Fire and Ice, Kolkata. The experience post a 5 year lag however, has been disappointing.

For starters, the staff now bore a seemingly arrogant attitude and if one questioned the dishes being served, they make you feel illiterate and that's just sad.

Coming to the food, the quality has become average or maybe I've had better. Either case the taste of dishes being served especially the spaghetti (Gomberi Di Fiume- fresh water prawns cooked with tomatoes, parsley and olive oil) weren't Al Dante(slightly undercooked)like a typical Italian pasta should be. The pepperoni pizza had one pepperoni piece per slice which is just sad. Moreover, the items have suddenly become 10 times more exhuberant in pricing. I mean who pays 600 for a Mojito?

All in all, I've been to better places, but I sincerely hope Heritage doesn't suffer in the name of arrogance in the long run especially when there's an ice cold attitude and fire in the bill üôà

PS. I wish the food was as beautiful as I felt while taking the picture.

Feel like having authentic thin crust, hand tossed, stone oven Italian Pizza? Feel like having it in a place that closely resembles your definition of what being in Italy would feel like? Want to have alcohol to go with it and wash it down? Ready to bear the cost for all of the above? Fire and Ice is the place for you.
If you love Italian, then you are gonna enjoy this place.

Nice place to grab a pizza and a lovely place if you love Italian. Am not a big fan of their service. Bit clumsy and unprofessional at times. Food does taste good. Huge variety of drinks is also available. Ambience is very cool and its got a funky vibe to it. In my opinion this place serves one of the best pizzas in town. Do drop in to know for sure.

Ambience- 5/5
They have done their interior very impressive, the moment you enter, trust me you will be impressed by the decor.
Food-3/5
Ok, I am not an expert, so I won't give detailed explanation, just two things, the taste doesnt make me crave for more, or a second helping. Secondly, the amount they serve is like really less, I mean, they should know, this is kolkata they are serving, where we get a lot more amount at same price and yes, good restaurants serve sufficient quantity at same price. You will know, if you go around eating every 2 months to good places


Value for money- ????
1.COSTLY
2. Apart from CGST and SGST, which amounts about 18% total, they charge you service charge, our bill was Rs 1540, and service charge about Rs 86, around 5.5% i guess.
When we asked the staff, that service charge or tip is something that is upon customers wish, they said that, they tale it on their own, and it is optional, we said that, they never mentioned it anywhere, upon which they proposed if they would take out that amount. I mean, when a person can pay 1540rs, 86rs he can pay, that is no big deal.. also, the person said, that usually people pay without any problem.
Nice reasoning for additional payment!!!

Also, I ordered lemon tea, but they billed me for honey lemon tea or something, when u asked them, one of them said, that the price is same, when I said that they are not as far as I remember, and asked them to show the menu again, then they changed it.
I mean, first they do some mistake (or intentional, don't know) , then shrug of the responsibility by saying that price is same. I mean, if I had not remembered the price, they are basically fooling customers like this.

Service- 2/5
The highlight and most discussed, with extra charge.
Nope, it ain't no special, they aren't cold but not very warm either.

Alternatively, BHAIYA, YEH TO LOOTERE HAI, If you are just a student or care for value for money while eating. Then....Your choice!!!

We ordered crepe with gelato, aglio olio spagetti, caffe tiramisu, hot lemon tea. We were very dissatisfied and dissapointed with the quantity and taste of food. The quantity of the spagetti was too low compared to the price. Initially they didn't even provide us with the coffee menu. We had ask for it. Anyways, when the bill came, they charged us extra for a lemon honey tea instead of lemon tea which was a more expensive item. They were not willing to rectify that so we asked for the menu and then they were forced to reduce the amount. They even charged us with service tax along with cgst and sgst, which is not at all acceptable. Only Upon asking about the service charge they told that we can choose not to pay that. Anyways, our experience was not so pleasant.

The manager probably needs to learn the way of speaking to the customers! The attitude he has is the least anyone would expect at a restaurant so good. Go up to him with a problem and look at the amount of rudeness you have to deal with.

We ordered for two nutella crepes and guess what we just got the crepe with a little nutella sprinkled in-between. So the dessert was just the flour crepe with icing sugar and if you are lucky you get some nutella. On asking him to increase the amount of nutella in the crepe, he said this is what it is..Wow!

If you really want to try good pizza and are willing to do away with the ‚Äúdominos‚Äù and ‚Äúpizza huts‚Äù of the world, then please and definitely visit Fire & Ice. The location is good but you may find it difficult to get parking. The pizzas are amazing and so is the decor. It will give you a very european feel. The thin crusted and not so commercial toppings will give you a bliss. Ask the staff for suggestions. Try them with wine. And please don‚Äôt just stick to pizzas try the risottos and the antipastis. It is obviously fine dining and specialized cuisine so do not expect to go cheap. The money spent will be well worth. This place is a must visit for all Italian food lovers.

Too expensive for a place that bad. Mushroom soup was good. The arlecchino pizza was tasteless. The pasta was quite average. The fire and ice delight was good although I didn't like it that much but my friend liked it so I would say it was good, could hv been better. They had almost no flavour of gelato that they had written on d menu. Also most desserts were unavailable. The vanilla gelato that we ordered did not taste very well but costed us a fortune. And the bill was of course shockingly high. They really need to revise their prices I believe. Ambience was good..only got a little hot in there as they had kept the AC at such a temperature that we were sweating. Wouldn't go there agn probably even if they offered free food

I travel extensively and mostly alone. My visit to Fire & Ice yesterdayevening was disastrous. As I walked in the restaurant to be ushered to a table, I could just see waiters busy, running around to serve their customers. I still asked one of them who just walked away and the other one that I asked told me to wait outside. There were 3 tables empty. There were no other people waiting for a table. Still I waited outside patiently. Then I saw people just walking inside the restaurant and the waiters guiding them to the tables. I too walked inside as I was hungry and maybe I was 'invisible' to them again. Waiters hurrying past me, I made my way to the cashier and told him that I have been waiting outside for long and need a table. He told me to sit at one of the tables close by. I waited for a long time to give my order. I must say I have never, ever felt so ignored in the restaurants that I visit. I have visited some of the most fine dining places alone and was always served with a smile and was always welcomed warmly.I wanted to walk away but I had come to the restaurant after a long drive of one hour and was visiting Kolkata for few days as I stay in Bombay. Of course they had all the time for a large, boisterous group of foreigners ! But even my meal order was no less. A meal for one person without alcohol - a salad, a soup, bread basket and ice tea was Rs.1500 with taxes and service charge.. ! They took forever to come to my table and take the order, serve me and give the bill ! This review is to the management to train their staff in customer service. My bad review is for the service, the staff, the attitude of the staff. I am sure with all the positive reviews they have, this review is not going to make any difference. Maybe this is not a place for single women or single guests..I can only say my evening was spoilt..I was thoroughly disappointed as I was looking forward to this meal and maybe I will never visit Fire & Ice again.

This is one of the best pizza place in not only Kolkata but I would say in India . Saying Only pizza place won't be an ideal description . Rustic-chic, Italian-run dining room with a menu of classic pizzas, pastas and antipasti. The ambience at night is absolutely great . N no of options with great and gorgeous taste . Totally loved it . I would recommend any of my known to even with my eyes closed .

Decor of this place is pretty amazing.
It's pretty good place for a date or reunion hangout.
Spaghetti with meatballs are totally worth the wait and their speciality focaccia with melted mozzarella is just heaven for pizza lover.
Desserts were pretty decent tiramisu is a must try and apple pie with gelato.

Loved the food! The pizza was the hero of our order.
We tried the pepperoni pizza , and it was exactly how pizza should be , crusty and juicy and cheesey. Perfect. The penne pasta we ordered was very spicy and exactly how we like it. And the interiors are great. Overall was a brilliant experience.

I've been there for lunch yesterday. The ambience of the restaurant is quite good. But the menu was too plain and simple. There was very few choices in Salad and the word "few" is actually too much. I couldn't find any signature dishes worth trying and Italian food is much more than just Pizza. Anyway we ordered a Salad " Insalata di pasta", which tasted quite good. It was buttery and taste was balanced. Next we had Prosciutto e Funghi. I would say Pizza was quite disappointment. We surely did not enjoy the Pizza. But I would like to another visit to this restaurant for Cocktails, as we didn't try those. But overall the experience was moderate.

What was supposed to be the first of our many go-to places for the Christmas of 2016 turned out to be an absolute bummer!
Entering at around 6:45 PM, we were left breathless by the paintings and decor that adorned the walls of this place. The atmosphere was electric and the Park-Street Christmas crowd frolicking on the other side of the glass walls only made the scene more magical. Our expectations, like our spirits, were soaring.
We ordered a Pollo from the list of wood-fire thin-crust pizzas. ¬†However, it turned out to be a sham. It barely contained ANY Mozarella cheese, and the chicken pieces were too scarcely spread to even begin to justify the exorbitant amount they charged. The base was badly burnt, the crust wasn't soft or edible. The accompaniments were bland and useless. It came as a rude shock for what was supposed to be the perfect start to a wonderful evening. The bill arrived and it was close to Rs. 900. Just for one plain, burnt piece of bread. Needless to say we left the place without giving another glance at the menu.

Pathetic food and service.  Over priced.  We ordered for potato fritte which tasted like cheap potato chips. The waiter neither served water not accommodated any requests when it came to the toppings on the pizza. Paid 1000 rupees for tasting the horrible potato chips. Neither was the food improved nor cancelled. Worst service ever! Left and went to a different place.

After a long time I finally got to eat a non-dominoes pizza and with every bite I cursed Dominoes. The thin crust, the cheesy layer and the background french music( not sure whether it was latin or french or Italian) was perfect. We ordered a Melanzane and it had 'Baingan' as a topping. Which was quite hysterical as we abstain from the so called aubergine at home and we paid for it in a restaurant. However, the huge pizza would serve Atleast three people and the cheese would definitely melt in your mouth making you crave for more.
All the names are so complicated that it is atleast 15 mins to decide what to eat and drink. It was a delightful experience overall. A friendly atmosphere perfect for hanging out with a lot of friends with whom you have a lot of catching up to do. I washed down the pizza with a breezer (chilled) while my friend preferred water as he abstains from alcoholic ‚Äãdrinks. We thought of ordering pasta as well but we were filled. I would definitely come back again but order a different pizza which won't have aubergine in it. üòèVishal Agarwal

Fire&Ice is sorts of a legend when it comes to wood fired Pizzas and classic Italian dishes and it still lives up to its name.
On a recent visit,found the same cozy charm of the place and brilliant food.

What I ordered:

-Napoletana Pizza : beautifully thin and crisp ,loaded with the toppings and enough sauce to keep making you go back for another slice

-Al Forno : seemed like a home cooked bake dish and it worth it. Creamy and flavorful. Would go amazingly well with some gaelic bread.

-Funghi Pizza : another beautifully done pizza with loads of mushrooms and cheese. Add some olive oil and its smooth as alls hell

-Porcini Risotto : did not like this at all. There was something weird about this.

-Arabiatta : just how it should be. Amazing sauce and we'll seasoned pasta

-Chocolate Mousse : its good but I've definitely had better

The service is quick and efficient and the prices are still decent. I think its still the best place to
get some good authentic pizzas in Kolkata

Perfect place for the authentic Italian cuisine lovers. The ambience is really good and perfect for a date with your loved ones. The food is delicious and very original. We ordered for Crostini Misti in starters and an Arclecchino woodfire pizza. Both the dishes were very authentic and astonishingly tasty. It is recommended to add the olive oil dipped with oregano and chilli topping to the pizza for even better taste. The pizza was perfectly baked, not too soggy or nor to hard. One of the best pizza I have ever tasted in Kolkata. It's a must for the pizza lovers to visit this place once without fail. They'll undoubtedly love it. Along with food we ordered for a Cosmopolitan and a Budweiser beer. The cosmopolitan was really refreshing along with the food. The decor was really beautiful and also the staff was very friendly and courteous. So if you love Italian food this place should definitely be added to your bucket list.

I haven't tasted authentic Italian pizza, having said that, the restaurant has an ambience similar to the pictures I have seen or restaurants in Manhattan. Coming to the food, pizza was a thin crust, I am not sure if they use brick oven but it was better than Domino's or Pizza Hut, by a country mile. Lasagna was best, I have ever tasted. I will looking forward to visiting, soon.

If you want to have authentic Italian food, then you are in the right place. Fire and Ice is very easy to locate. It is near Maidan Metro station. This is also one of the best place for pizza in Kolkata. This was my very first visit here and I was absolutely thrilled. From the decor to the food, everything was really good. This place is popular for its Woodfire pizza. The people there are quiet courteous. The ambience is soothing. All in all I am extremely satisfied with my experience here.

I love pizza so much that I can eat any type of it. So i pretty much know by the look of it if they are good or bad (atleast for my taste). I have been visiting this place since my Loreto college days, which dates back to 2009-2012. So, whenever there is pizza on my head, this is the first place I wana visit. Almost all their pizzas are good- but Fire of Bengal, my God, is just something else! My mouth waters even when I am writing this review. Others have names too complicated to remember which are good too. 

Oh! Service and interiors are decent too! A must visit for pizza lovers in the city.

Since we were a kid, Fire and Ice has been one of the go to places for pizzas and authentic Italian cuisine. Even with so many new places cropping up Fire and Ice remains highly regarded. We visited this place after quite a while to try their pizza for our countdown of the top ten pizzas in the city. We had the plain fire and ice pizza and were thoroughly impressed. The crust. The Cheese. The seasoning. Absolutely spot on. It was easy to see why this place has been a benchmark for pizzas in Kolkata for so so long. This place simply guarantees a good pizza. It would take a lot for this not to make our top ten pizzas in Kolkata. The more pertinent question will probably be how high it features in the top ten list. Do stay tuned to find out!

A spacious restaurant with chic d√©cor and a fun ambience, this place serves some mean Italian food. Loved the pizzas - fire of bengal and Pollock were both thin crust and filled with cheesy goodness. Crespelle con carne is a wholesome dish of chicken wrapped in crepes and baked in cheese. Finally, the spaghetti with meat balls was tangy and well made. The drinks are also well made, particularly the mocktails. However, this restaurant can be slightly heavy on the purse.

I had once visited it some years ago; the place appeared rather empty, there being only another table with patrons. My friend and I quite liked the ambience ‚Äì spacious, exuding a cosmopolitan feel! We ordered the Calzone al Prosciutto ‚Äì a type of folded pizza. It was comparatively mellow...and both of us, habituated to the spicier version at Pizza chains, viz. Pizza Hut or Domino‚Äôs, initially found it bland. However, with every bite we soon realized that it was an acquired taste. By the end of our meal, none of us had any complaints...all the more because we had supposedly experienced the authentic Italian taste of a pizza :P

If you are looking for authentic Italian food, this is the right place for you. Original thin crusted pizzas with original Italian toppings. But if you are a Dominos or a Pizza Hut lover then, their is a high chance you may not like it. But for a person like me, who looks for those authentic rustic Italian pizzas, this is the right place. But the prices are too high. It needs to be rationalize a bit.

Just near Maidan metro station, this place has been on my go to list for quite some time now. Though a bit too overpriced for the quantity they serve, the food tastes good. We orders two pizzas 'Paesana' and 'Pollo'. The first pizza was good but had a little too overpowering taste of spinach. We also ordered Lamb Lasagna which was also really good. The ambience is pleasant and the staff was also very helpful.

I have lived in Italy for half an year and returning back to India this is the closest to authentic Italian food I've eaten. The pizzas are classic hand tossed and Fire of Bengal is an outstanding fusion. Less options for chicken eaters but that's how Italian food actually is. More vegetarian or meat, less of chicken. The salads are fresh and potato ronduelles are a hit amongst kids. Having the lamb lasagna I was transported back to Italy and I am not exaggerating while saying that. Even though the menu has been modified to suit the Indian pallette, the essence of authenticity is still there.

I have been passing by this restaurant for years without putting a foot inside. Last Saturday, finally I dared to go in.

It is a complete Italian food joint. I have tried Italian cuisine before, and I love it. 

The moment I entered the restaurant it felt like a little old Calcutta come up. The same atmosphere, the same decors. I loved the wall hangings of popular Italian Hollywood artists and the posters of the films they enacted. I loved the seating arrangement, but most of all I liked the display of beautiful amateur drawings made by the visitors over here - mostly children - which they pin up against the display board. A very novel idea indeed.

The staff was very welcoming and saw to my requirements. I sat at a table overlooking the road and chose my food helped by them - picarta de pollo. It is a composition of chicken breast with spaghetti and mushrooms. The food arrived shortly. It is non spicy, but the staff added grounded spice for my benefit. The chicken breast was juicy and soft. The mushrooms were out of this world and I happily dug into the spaghetti combination with a satisfied heart. This is what good food does to us.
Car parking is a pain on the neck here, since it is a busy place. If you get one, you are lucky. Price may be too steep, but on looking at the ambience, well, you might think it is right.

Along wid pasta they served bread which I feel it was two three days back bread . I even ordered sweet lime soda this was up to Mark

I have visited the main branch of Fire & Ice, located near the Maidan Metro station, a few years back.  Famous for its pizzas and pastas, Fire & Ice is all about authentic Italian cuisine.  In spite of the number of eateries  offering the same cuisines, Fire & Ice stands apart as one of the oldest and truest pioneers of this cuisine. Classy and spacious interiors add to the ambience, and the quality of food is great, even though its a tad bit pricey. A definite must visit if you are looking for clean and good quality Italian food.

By far the worst service imaginable.The restaurant was quite empty when we walked in - despite that, the waiter was very keen to know if we were going to take very long to finish. I didn't disappoint him at all and left right away. With this kind of an attitude their place will be forever empty. I will not recommend it to anybody ever again!

The service is horrifying, the guy at the entrance ignored me when I asked how long it would take to get a table. After a 7 minute wait, they got us a table where we waited close to 20  minutes for someone to take our order. The food was good though. But the service ruined the night for us.

Why is this place so underrated? It has great service, quick and polite waiters and the food is out of the world! We ordered the bruschetta which, although lacking in a smidgen of feta was just delicious. The pepperoni pizza is out of the world and the fresh pepper they add gives it a nice kick.. The long Island iced tea packs a super punch and the apple pie is perfect,although I prefer it without the ice cream it's served with..to conclude, a lovely meal, best enjoyed with a couple of good friends!

First thought I had in my mind after I finished my dinner was a bit too pricey for just average food.
The place is spacious and gives the feel of any European cafe, but I would say do not keep very high expectations from the food 'cuz it's nothing like what they serve in those little roadside cafes in Europe. Well I definitely have eaten better pizza and pasta and everything else as well I'm sure that's there on their menu. Well you can give it a try if you really want to try, but not the kind of food I would love to visit again for.

I am a regular at this restaurant and absolutely love the food!  However, my last experience here was horrible because of the service. 

The server who took our order complete forgot about us.  Our order for soups and pasta didn‚Äôt get placed and we had to wait for the longest time. We had to keep reminding them about our order and Still it didn‚Äôt arrive on time.  In fact, the soup came last - after the pizza.  Even the pasta came as an after thought.  

When we told the server about this, he had a grin on his face and was not even apologetic about anything.  He was smirking.  The whole attitude seemed wrong.  And I am a regular here.  

When they brought the dessert the served us the mousse without ice cream.  










If you're looking for good Italian food, this is the place!!! 

Excellent salads, excellent focaccia, delicious pasta, and fantastic pizzas! This place has it all. 

1-2 Long Island ice teas here is enough to get your Saturday evening set!!!

It was a saturday night eat out. After having a week long hectic schedule, me and my husband planned to visit this place. We made a thorough research about this place, as we do for most of the places we visit, and we already got to know that this place was expensive. However, what we liked about the place instantly was its ambience, decor and the behaviour of the staff. The second important thing we liked about it was that we were given a chance to choose our table (A 5star was dancing in my mind already). As we were given the menu card, we noticed the price of the food and not much to our surprise, it was on a pretty higher side. We ordered foccacia with melted mozzarella cheese for the starter along with Brodetto di Pesce Alla Bengalese and Piccata di Pollo for the main course (we also had a 60 ml whisky and a 30 ml vodka). The foccacia, what we expected was to be soft. However, we felt it to be a bit hard. The mozzarella cheese had no taste at all. The Brodetto di Pesce which was actually a sea food soup had a sort of raw fish smell in it. This might be because either the fish was not fresh or it was not cooked well. Amongst the three dishes we had, piccata di Pollo was probably the only eatable one. However, given the exhorbitant price they are charging, the products they used for the dishes should have been much better. Spending Rs. 2710 for this quality of food was a total waste of money.

Part of the Fire  &  Ice chain,  located few steps away from Maidan Metro.  We ended up eating here coz we were craving for pizza. Spacious interior but pretty empty.  A Few groups came by. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and a ham panini. As soon as the panini arrived,  we realized  we should have gone for the spaghetti or lasagna. It was dry and overpriced. The pizza was a 12" and ' big enough  to share'.  It wasn't as cheesy as I'd have liked.  The crust was very  brittle.  I was quite disappointed with their pizza considering that I had heard  such great reviews.

I will write a tough review extremely critical in nature for this place...wait for it...wait for it...wait for it...and yup...Wow. Been coming here since I was a kid with mommy and now looking forward to visit with my daughter. I discovered my love for Italian food here, never knew the city has pasta perfectly al dente, soaked with the best quality olive oil, exquisite quality of capers, artichokes and Pizza dough and the perfect mousse, no wait...the tiramisu is better...nope the gelato is the best...wait, wait, wait it is the crepe that is the best dessert here...ok I can't pick, I love them all. They make a mean bloody Mary and a delicious Cosmopolitan. Fine selection of reds and whites. To top it all up really good coffee is aavailable to round up an exquisite dining experience.  Recommended items: garlic foccacia bread, veg antipasti platter, Pizza Hawaiiana,  Pizza Pollo, Aglio olio el pepperencino pasta, Pasta Carbonara, Spaghetti with meatballs, Savoury Mushroom Crepe, Gelato with frean fruits, Almond biscotti,  Chocolate Mousse,  Tiramisu, Caramel Flan, Pannacotta if available and  crepes with banana and nutella or simply crepes with lemon and sprinkled sugar. Seriously try the latte afterwards.

I discovered my love for Italian food here, never knew the city has pasta perfectly al dente, soaked with the best quality olive oil, exquisite quality of capers, artichokes and Pizza dough and the perfect mousse, no wait...the tiramisu is better...nope the gelato is the best...wait, wait, wait it is the crepe that is the best dessert here...ok I can't pick, I love them all. They make a mean bloody Mary and a delicious Cosmopolitan. Fine selection of reds and whites. To top it all up really good coffee is aavailable to round up an exquisite dining experience.  Recommended items: garlic foccacia bread, veg antipasti platter, Pizza Hawaiiana,  Pizza Pollo, Aglio olio el pepperencino pasta, Pasta Carbonara, Spaghetti with meatballs, Savoury Mushroom Crepe, Gelato with frean fruits, Almond biscotti,  Chocolate Mousse,  Tiramisu, Caramel Flan, Pannacotta if available and  crepes with banana and nutella or simply crepes with lemon and sprinkled sugar. Seriously try the latte afterwards.

Totally my kind of place. I loved the whole menu actually. Just tried one pizza and another dish (forgot the name) but both were extremely tasty. The people in charge of serving were extremely humble. I really loved it. Hope to try out some more soon.

The restaurant is in the prime location of kolkata and they maintain the good standard since long, still i can remember my first date their. Their pizzas are really nice with so many options. After this many restaurant came like Casa toscana, Elsango, Amigos , blue potato no one can exit. But consistency is the key word for this restaurant. Kudos team.

If your idea of pizza is created by going in the numerous pizza places who churn pizzas from a production line, you must go to Fire and Ice. The world needs more places like these...

Pathetic food and pathetic service. Came here to have dinner. Ordered an Arrabiata pasta. The pasta was absolutely tasteless and it smelled of Garlic, that's it. The server and the chef apparently believe that's how an Arrabiata pasta is supposed to be. They refused to change it or make it better. Would not recommend.

This is one of my favourite places in Kolkata because Pizza is almost like an Italian pizza, the first time I was so surprised and happy! One of the oldest of Kolkata. So many such eat-outs have mushroomed up but this place has a class of its own.¬†
Everything from entrance to food to people to exit is amazing in its own respect. It is huge and spacious.
We ordered a pizza and brochette and a dessert. Everything was lip smacking and amazing and we loved every bite of every single piece.

And the chocolate mousse is something very special! ¬†I welcomed the opportunity to eat authentic Italian pizza. Would Highly recommend Fire & Ice if you are in Kolkata!

Fire and ice had been in the block a while now, very famous for its Italian food. The oven baked pizzas are quite authentic. The pasta,  lasagna is tasty too. The only down side is the extremely high price range and adding tax will make a big hole in your pocket. It's fine for a once in a blue moon visit but for the general public it can get very expensive.

And the liquors were exquisite. Tried LIIT here but was a waste. Tried and tasted many Italian dishes here and overall enjoyed my experience. Would visit again if someone gives me treat here. Ty for Looting me but was worth itüòã

Two words : Ambiance & Decor.
Couple that with decent variety of Pizzas and overall professional staff.
You will get beer and this can get a bit costly if you don't watch it but the time spent there with someone close (father, friend or fiance) is going to be worth it.

This is the place where I was introduced to Thin Crust Wood fire Pizza, and since then I am in love with Thin crust pizzas. They have a lot of option for vegetarians. I like The Fire and Ice Pizza which is made with Tomato, pesto, rosemary and oregano, it's different everyone might not even like it, but i enjoyed it a lot. I liked their Alfredo ai Funghi pasta, it's super cheesy with yummy mushrooms. This place is owned by an Italian family, if you want to try good Italian food this place is a must visit.

This restaurant is by far the best serving authentic italian food in kolkata. Their wood fire pizzas are the best. Price may be a little higher side. Place is also very nicely decorated, spacious and calm.I tried a pizza with caramelized onions and it was tasty but even better with some extra sauce. The crust is thin and crispy not like most pizza I've tried in India, free of the char you get from a super hot pizza oven.

I went here for first time..!!
And guess what the experience was amazing.
I ordered a 12" pollo pizza along with the LIIT..!!

The pizza was wood fired for which the cafe is actually famous for. And the pizza was perfect according to me. The flavours were amazing.

Though  the LIIT could have been a bit more better. For a person who is fond of alcohol will love it but if a rookie drinks it he may not like it that much. 

The ambience and crowd was amazing.

Best place to visit with family and friends and even alone.

Cheers..!!

Just happened to try this place on Christmas as it was less crowded and looked inviting enough judging by the exteriors. The ambience was indeed warm, vivid and a happy one.
Tried the much famed, Focaccia with melted Mozzarella cheese . It's perfectly crisp on the outside while soft and chewy on the inside. It's a must try.
The service was good and courteous. The pricing is moderate. Loved the experience here and I will be going back here to try more.

Visited this place few days back. Very decent place to hangout. We've ordered Arrabiata and 2 whiskey (Jack Daniel's). Both were up to the mark. We visited this place at around 9pm so it was not at all crowded. The staff who served us was very polite. The price is a bit high but if you want to try some Italian cuisine  you should try this place.

I decided to give this place a try on Christmas, since the other options at Park Street were too crowded and needed a long wait. However, I was disappointed big time. 

The interiors are extremely well decorated, with movie posters hanging around and the lights and their reflections on the big window make up a beautiful decor. Also the bar and the glass showcases containing the dessert items looks great. 

However, coming to the object of interest: the food- they are extremely overpriced and definitely not worth the price. I have read about their thin crust woodfire pizzas, and decided to try one. I had ordered Pollo - which was supposed to contain Mozarella, Chicken, Onions and Sweet corn. However, the Mozarella was barely there, the base was almost burnt, the pizza was neither soft, nor crunchy, and the sauce was too bland. The Chicken pieces too weren't generous enough for the price. 

I was too reluctant to try out anything else after this experience, because this alone cost me 800+ bucks with taxes. So, I am definitely not willing to go back.

We went on a vegetarian date and we remembered this place as our good old hangout place during our dating days! ;-)
Been here a bunch of times and yet they disappointed us (the Mr & Mrs) on our anniversary date. 
We wanted a vegetarian pizza and specified we wanted the pizza crust 'well done' and didn't quite like the outcome. 
But the Garlic foccassia bread was the usual delectable self served hot! 
The portions are good for a couple and the price is fine.
They ve kept the decor pretty much simple like some American canteen but a lil upgradation wouldn't hurt! After all we re the ones who pay for it, right?

The service also felt particularly cold that day with the guys acting like they couldn't care less. 

The food quality is definitely top class. Taste could be better. They were one of the best in the city at one time. Not anymore apparently!

Yes, it might be a little on the expensive side but the pizza they serve here, with a fine thin crust, is pretty good and the ambience in particular with the d√©cor they have in place is pretty good too.

But there is the twist in the tail the sauce of the pizza is  bland and even after the pizza had great base and perfect fresh veggies on it.
Failed to do the trick.

The food is good too. Had ordered for-

This place was on our wish-list for a long long time. Visited it finally during last Puja. But the overall experience was not a good one. 

To begin with the Antipasto Misto was good. Don't have an idea if the Italians like it that way or not, but their pesto sauce was horrible. Salty to the extent of being inedible. There was almost no topping on the pizza (the base was good though). And the drinks were just ok. In all a really overpriced and overhyped place.

Having crossed this place a billion number of times in the last 17 years coupled with my undying love for pizza, it was ironic I took so long in giving this place a visit.
However, the ball finally did hit the bat, and at last I was heading to this place. 
Starting with the interiors, the place is spread over a huge area. There is a bar as well as an open kitchen which makes the place looks classy and gives the X-factor. 
Now coming to the food, we were 8 of us, and we ordered 4 12" pizzas.
Each one was a class in itself. Here's what we had:

1. Pepperoni : A fan favourite of all times. This one is a hot seller, and you should be a pork cum pizza lover to be able to savour this  one.

2. Terra E Mare : This one had Tuna Fish in it. Yes, you read that right. A pizza with fish. All of us were skeptical with this one but as it turned out that this one was unanimously judged as the best of the 4. And, I would definitely ask you'll to pick this one if you'll plan to order one.

3. Paesana : Again a fan favourite, and one can't go wrong with bacon and pizza. This is a deadly combination. Well worth the hype, this one was amazing as well.

4. Prosciutto Funghi : If you are a fan of juicy cheesy pizza, close your eyes and go for this. This was my 2nd favourite among all four, and the juiciness added to its flavour.

This place is a must for all the pizza as well as the non-pizza lovers. Definitely one of the best pizza spots in Kolkata. Highly recommended!

If you're looking for authentic Italian food, your search ends here. Fire and ice has one of the most authentic Italian food that I've eaten in the city of joy. I've been here on multiple occasions and will hence pick out my top picks from this restaurant.

Rondelle di patate fritte - In layman terms, these are home made chips, served with a homemade pesto sauce as well as a homemade tomato paste
Fire and Ice Pizza - This is definitely our pick for the best pizza in fire and ice, try it yourself and you won't regret it 
Apple pie - classic apple pie with the hint of cinnamon hitting your palate with every bite
Chocolate mousse - just the right texture that melts in your mouth, it's made of dark chocolate so if that's not your kind of chocolate, you might as well avoid it.

This was back in 2011. Visited this place in the evening. I had just returned from San Pedro, where Pizza had become my staple food, and was looking for a place that served authentic pizzas in Kolkata. This place more than satisfied my cravings . I ordered a mushroom pizza and a nutella-banana crepe.
The pizza turned out to be quite big in size-enough for 3 skinny guys like me.üòÑ but I devoured it alone anyway. The mozzarella cheese was the star-you could tell by the aroma that the cheese was fresh and different from the widely used cheese. Totally loved it 
The crepes were very tender and provided the perfect finishing touch. 
I hope the pizzeria is as good today as it was back then. 
All the best. Will visit soon.

I went to this place especially fir desserts. This place offers amazing Tiramisu and brownies!  As I was quite light on my pockets, I found the menu is slightly on the higher side. Thankfully the desserts weren't! But as I have heard from other sources, they offer some mouth watering food. Whatever, the dessert section is a must try!

Fire and ice is the best Italian option in Calcutta today! The thin crust pizza - specially the al funghi is something I have to order each time I go there. The pastas are also really nice, again I would recommend the pesto spaghetti. But what I would particularly want is more options in their veg risotto. All in all an amazing place though slightly overpriced!

This is my first visit to Fire and Ice in Kolkata and the food as expected was authentic italian, slightly overpriced but the ambience and service were top notch. The biggest shock to me was when I visited the restroom. The restaurant, although authentic Italian, is location in an Indian city and caters to majority of Indian crowds. If facilities are not provided for the average Indian, I am a little uncertain as to why this resturant is still in India.

I gathered information from the waiter that the owner was a foreigner and wasn't happy with how the toilet was handled after a certain situation. I am surprised that how can a restroom be designed for the owner's unrealistic expectation? Shouldn't the restroom be designed to cater to customers? Maintaining the cleanliness is purely the management's responsibility.

The owner needs to be aware of cultural sensitivities in understanding the Indian mindset before making such decisions. Unless some action is taken, I will never visit nor recommend this place to anyone.

Fire and ice is not the best pizza in calcutta,Its not the best priced either. But it is quite consistent with its quality and delivery timings.With generous toppings and crispy bases they continue to serve good food all around.
Desserts are probably the only let down of this place.Never have i ever had a decent dessert here.

One word verdict: Good pizzas but not in great category 
Went there for lunch and ordered focaccia with melted mozerella and a veg pizza with cheese caramelised onions and tomato sauce followed by apple pie with gelato
The focaccia was fantastic but the pizza was mediocre with overwhelming taste of only onions 
The disappointment was the dessert where the pie came without gelato and tasted little below average and moreover I was charged for the complete dish though gelato was not available and on enquiring the same they said the price will be for entire dish ...??????
Will I go there again: probably

Fire and Ice has remained my favourite eatery in the city over the last 8-9 years. I always try and drag my friends and family in there. The quality of food, service and ambience has remained staunchly consistent over the years.
Their high points are the pizzas and the desserts (esp. the creme brulee!). Do not leave the place without ordering one of their thin crust pizzas. The flavours, cheese and toppings are just right! Unlike most fine dining restaurants, their quantities are pretty substantial as well. The pastas can be slightly unpredictable at times, so order with care.
The ambience and service too, are faultless. On my mother's birthday, the server even agreed to halve a pizza and put separate toppings on each half, to tailor it to our individual tastes. I have always enjoyed going there and my companions have never had a complaint either.¬†
Stay just the way you are, Fire and Ice.

Had heard a lot about this place bt was nt of my types..  It's typical Italian restaurant n v r use to a bit Desi touch in all dishes..  Ambiance was k, nothing great bt yes footfall was amazin..  Ppl wait in que to hav there food here...  Soup was good...  Bt in starter v didn't find much in menu n spcly for the veggies..  Den focacio was nothing great..  Cheese garlic bread n lasagna was good n cheesy..  Pastas were realy dry n as already mentioned in d menu were nt that soft, were a bit chewy n no option for mix sauce pasta..  N further v need to add vegetables separately n each ingredient vl cost approx 120, nt worth enough...  N last Pizzas were really soft n cheesy bt again v cannot get our choice of ingredients so sumhw didn't njyd...  Staff n service was good..  But after such experience n hav to pay almost 1k per person without any satisfaction was hurty..  Vl recommend that management makes the menu customer friendly or if guests asks to make sum changes in the dish then should be entertained...  Pizza lovers should try...

Dropped in here on a Sunday for lunch. My friend insisted that he wanted authentic Italian taste. We ordered carbonara, bologne and penne pasta (veg). The prices we felt were way higher than other restaurants on Park St serving continental cuisine. And the taste- personally I found way to bland for the Indian palette though I do not prefer too much spicy and hot food- where as in other similar places the taste more agreeable. ¬†

The seating is not very relaxed either as thought one is out on a working lunch. Another strange thing: a 'serving charge' was added to our bill! Is it the tip?!

The ambiance inside is good and the place is not cramped with a lot of space between tables. The staff is good and courteous, though would be great if they could guide people through the menu better. What really makes the place worth it is its very authentic food. The pizza was outstanding, light, crispy and fresh. The Lasagna was great, but a bit runnuy...maybe it is a good idea for them to serve it after 15 mins it comes out of the oven (that way it would set well). Avoid the sizzling brownie and stick to the tiramisu. Nice place surely worth a visit, not so easy on the pocket though....

Pre-Review Pro Tip: Have a sip of wine before you take a bite of a spicy-tangy pizza. It would create a volly of flavours in your mouth.

Want to try lip smacking unique pizzas not available on the menus of the famed restaurant chains of Kolkata? Come to Fire and Ice Pizzeria. Located near American Embassy, this gem of a pizzeria comes draped in brown interiors with just the right amount of Italiano streaks on its canvas of furniture. The waiters are hospitable and the menu is quite varied. We took a Paesana pizza laden with bacon strips.
The pizza was out of this world. I have never had a better pizza in my life. I forgot about the other restaurant chains as I took a crunchy bite of my thin crust Paesana. It was a blast of flavours, textures and tangy tomatoes with mozzarella. There were peppers, black olives and it was tasty to the point you could almost taste it with its smell. The bacon added a different and surprising layer of taste to an already unique pizza and although we were two people ordering a 12 Inch Pizza and our tummies were full, we wanted more of it. We had ordered wine and it gave a lip smacking depth to the pizza as the wine was sour and a bite of the pizza after the acidity imposed by the wine made flavours explode in your mouth.

Verdict: Hands down this is the best pizzeria in Park Street area and I would love to go again.

One of the oldest of Kolkata. So many such eat-outs have mushroomed up but this place has a class of its own. I have been long waiting to be here and try out the pizza as i simply love pizzas. 

Everything from entrance to food to people to exit is amazing in its own respect. It is huge and spacious. I went with my wife and child. We got a comfortable seat. They were very generous enough to provide my child with a plain paper and colours which he loved immensely and started his activities right away. Not many places you find such a sweet gesture.

We ordered a pizza and brochette and a dessert. Everything was lip smacking and amazing and we loved every bite of every single piece.

I would highly recommend this place. Not once but twice. Full marks for everything.

This was on my wishlist, and I am happy now that it has been ticked off. It is known for serving authentic Italian, and while I haven't been to Italy and had food over there to verify that reputation, I can certainly say I loved what I tasted. Far far better than a Dominos or a Pizza Hut.

First up was the antipasti or starter. We ordered Rondelle de Patate Fritte, which is fried potato slices, served with their own made tomato sauce and pesto. The slices are thicker than your average chips, and is enouh for two people. The pesto is awesome.

Next is the main course, and we had to have a pizza. We ordered the Pollo Pizza, which was very tasty. The thin crust, the mozarella cheese, and the buttery juices that flow in your mouth when you take a bite of the Pollo is amazing.

Then came the desserts. Icecream Cappuccino and Gelato in a bowl with chocolate topping. They cappuccino was OK, and the gelato was good, but a little too sweet for my liking. The bill came to a Rs. 2035, but is very reasonable considering authentic Italian.

The first thing that strikes you about the place is the ambiance - beautifully set up, with a nice and courteous staff. On top of that, the place offers some of the best pizza and anti pasta in the area. Recommend reserving a table on weekends to avoid a long wait, to try out their half-pizzas.

Amazing place but disheartening to say that they use Parmesan cheese with animal rennet derived from calf intestine after killing. 

They mark all such item such as cheese pasta and pesto pasta as Vegitarian in their menu. 

Tried to convince them a lot ,sent many emails to encourage them to use microbial rennet based cheese but they are adamant and not budging . 

Many of the 5 star rated hotels also recognize this issue and care for people's choice and don't misguide them to consume such stuff. 

Vegetarians and vegans be careful !!!

Date of Visit : 26/06/2016

Location : Near Maidan metro station

Ambience : Very elegant. It truly feels like you are entering an Italian restaurant. Photo frames of Italian movie are all over the place. You dnt feel like you are in an Indian restaurant.

Service : Service is top notch here. Nowhere in the earth I can imagine pizzas and lasagne being delivered so fast even though the restaurant was full. The staffs were well trained. 

Foods Ordered & Description : It was a lazy Sunday. After watching movie in evening, decided to try this authentic Italian restaurant. As we entered the place, we fell in love with the ambience. The restaurant was almost full. Somehow we managed to get a table. Coming to the food -
Crema di fungi (Cream of Mushroom)- The soup was average. Though it's consistency was good but somehow the wow factor was missing.
Pizza Alle Verdure Miste - this pizza was one of the best I ever had. Thin crust with loads of vegetables and cheese. Things cnt get better than this. Loved every bite of it.
Lasagne Vegetables - awesome lasagne. Pasta layers were soft. Its every bite melted in mouth. Taste was great.
Alvorada - this mocktail was made with combination of strawberries with cranberry juice topped with lemon juice and fresh mint leaves. This drink was very refreshing.

Overall a great experience. Though the pocket pinch was on higher side but it was worth each penny spent because of great food and service. Someone who loves Italian food must try this place.

I've been here a couple of times long back and on my visit to Kolkata i decided to try their food after hearing very good reviews about them but sadly, my experience here at Fire and Ice was a very disappointing one. We ordered the mozzarella focaccia, which was very bland and their was a very weird smell in the cheese. We also ordered their pesto pasta, which had too much pesto and tasted very bitter and the pasta was a bit uncooked. Their margarita pizza was thin crust and one of the best one's i've had so far. Their staff is very friendly and apologised for the experience we had. The ambience of the place is very nice and relaxing and their staff is very friendly..

Enough said about the pizzas .... Completely think they are the best in Calcutta without a doubt ! 

What needs real mention is the lasagna which is delicious. The food quality across visits and over the years is fabulous ! The beverages are also well presented, something that most restaurants don't pay much attention to. 

I have to say one must leave space for deserts ... Not a real dessert fan but I do truly enjoy them here ! Venture beyond the tiramisu and you will be pleasantly surprised !

Located near to my workplace , it's a pizza joint which promises to usher in the Continental pizza style as opposed to the mushrooming Pizza Huts and Domino's. However, I was extremely disappointed. The thin-crust pizzas are not at all tasty , toppings are scant and the ¬†flavouring just seems off. The olive oil is a nice touch , but that's about it. Prices way too high in relation to the quality dished out. Sorry , but give me Pizza Hut any day.

So people say Italians invented pizza but the Americans perfected it. But if you are tired of the chain store pizzas and pastas head here. This is as authentic as it gets . Run by an expat  this place has done of the best pizzas and pastas in town. Do have the artichoke risotto and the lasagna along with the pizza. Get a  tall margarita aswell just because.

If you are an authentic Italian cuisine lover, this place is your go-to. They serve delicious Italian dishes. However, this isn't where you would want to go if you prefer Indian Italian food. I had no complaints regarding their service either. An excellent fine dining experience, I'd say.

Recently visited fire and ice and had ordered ¬†spaghetti carbonara & prosciutto e funghi. Spaghetti carbonara was a little less ¬†for 2 people ¬†while prosciutto e funghi was sufficient. Taste wise both were amazing. Being a pizza lover i've tried pizza in many places in Kolkata but i have to admit fire and ice is definitely a class apart. Price wise this place is absolutely fine as portions offered are generous in most cases . In addition to great food other reasons to revisit this place are the speed at which food arrives,courteous staff and a great ambience. Have visited this place many times and will continue to do so in the future!

I am very finicky about my Italian food, to say the least.
Like I did sail the extra nautical miles to visit the tiny island in southern Italy, where the first Pizza Margarita was born.
Like, I did wait for hours outside a tiny restaurant in Florence, just like I waited in patience to see Michaelangelo's David, just because they reportedly served the best t-bone steak in the whole Toscana.
So I always felt like suing Pizza Hut and the like, for ruining the hand tossed, thin crust, classic Italian Pizza.
And felt ashamed to see Tanduri Chicken or extra spicey Mutton Boti Kebab as Pizza toppings in India.
Then Fire & Ice happened! Truly authentic Italian cuisine. No frills, wholesome Pasta, Pizza and Risotto. They import their mozzarella, the sun dried tomatoes, their Pepperoni and Oregano. For the Pizzas, they have log fire oven. For the rest, they stick to tradition. The result is divine!
They also serve simple, heady cocktails besides the regular beer.
I am in so much love with their food, that I put the original Fire & Ice of Kathmandu in my itenary, while travelling in Nepal. That's another fun place!
My only regret is, I cannot go there as often as I should! They opened one branch closer to my home, but closed down after a year. The Kolkatans are more used to the Domino's and Pizza Huts, I guess! That's a pity!

It's just beside the maidan metro gate number 2. As a student of St.xaviers i know this area very well. We bunked our college and went here.
I ordered the La Mrina pizza and i don't remember what my friends ordered. Loved the pizza. If you love italian food you've got to come here. Their service is excellent. Well trained and well versed staffs. The price is a bit high. Well nothing comes for free.

This was on my wish list for a long long time now. Finally I planned to visit this place. I had pizza ala verdure and asparagus risotto. Loved the risotto. Has cream caramel, which was again sinful. Service was quick. The place is so calm and relaxing and plays the right choice of music. The staff is humble. Loved the warmth of the place.

Let me just begin by saying, that they play opera in the caf√©. S√¨, let that sink in. If you are a culture geek, you are sure to love it here. With retro advertisement posters, glinting vintage photographs, they set in a lovely mood. The food is wonderful. 
The pizzas are perfect, but I will keep going back for the crespelle con carne. That is mozzarella-fused bliss.

Just that you cannot talk easy as tables are too close and too loud. But that cannot be the reason to miss this place. A must go.

A near perfect authentic Italian Restaurant which serves up the best Aglio Olio ever had in town and their lasagnas are also to crave for but one will be disappointed with the pizzas as it had a very weird after taste which let us down a big time. The service is okay nothing special but yes there servers are attentive, you look around they will be there at the table asking if you need anything.¬†

Procrastinator's review 001
This Jan my friends and I went to this place to have something authentic Italian. We ended up ordering a large Paesana and a La Marinara pizza. While the first once was to good to end, the second one was way to fishy- literally- for us to finish. The pizzas were utterly delicious and the crust optimally thick. The food was served properly and matched the ambiance- which is also thought provoking. The addition of spiced olive bottles were a nice  touch on the managements behalf. I would strongly recommend this place for those who are sick and tired of Domino's and PhD. 
Also if possible try the spaghetti meatball. Highly under rated I believe. And as always bon appetite...

Full marks for the ambiance and food here. This place is famous for its authentic Italian cuisine and beautiful interiors and lights. The live music played here is also Italian opera music. The walls are adorned with pictures of old Italian classic movies. Food is bit expensive here. We had a 12 inch Pollo pizza which had a wood baked thin crust and has onion, tomatoes and chicken pieces. Bit different from the Indian version of pizzas we are used to having where ample amounts of tomato sauce are used. The best was the dessert dish which was a lemon meringue pie. Simply heavenly. Next time I am surely going to have the Spaghetti Carbonara and Bolognese which many praise here. The staff is extremely courteous. They also have imported gelato in the menu. In the dinners you can dine in candle light. Loved it.

Went to this beautiful joint to celebrate my birthday. I must say I wasn't disappointed. Everything was top notch. We loved the decor of this quaint place, especially the canopy of climbers that surround the entrance. Dim lights and opera greeted us. What I liked the most about the service was that the waiters suggested us just the right amount to order. 
The experience was made perfect by the pizza and mocktail we ordered. The thin crust pizza made my day and I'm looking forward to visit again. Highly recommended.

Great ambience let down by very average food. 

We ordered 3 dishes .... saut√©ed mushroom, margarita pizza and a mushroom soup. Except the saut√©ed mushroom the other dishes were completely insipid. It was as if the chef took the ingredients out from a deep freezer and/or tins and cooked them. Not a hint of flavor anywhere. I could well be having a 'knorr soup' for all I know.

Cooking Italian is my speciality and so when I write a review I know what I am speaking of. 

This was a huge dissapointment.

Fire and Ice exudes palpable good cheer and comfort. The pizza is consistently good, sometimes outstanding, and easily the best in the city. The staff is excellent. There is even a chap who wields a hilariously fanciful Italian accent. I ate there last night but I'm already looking forward to my next plate of Paesana.

Bonus: Best vanilla ice cream (smooth and subtle) and apple pie (tart and succulent) in the city.

This restaurant has a great choice of music but poor lighting. The service could also be improved as the waiters are quite inattentive.
The pizzas and spaghetti is a must try!

Authentic thin crust pizzas and their pasta are my anytime favourite. Yes, this place is a bit overpriced but we r ready to pay for quality food! People who prefer the indian version of pasta and pizza should avoid coming here. They serve authentic food and wouldnt add cumin and coriander powder to your pasta howmuchever you insist!!

This is the best Italian restaurant restaurant in Kolkata, their Pizzas are absolutely top notch. This restaurant offers a variety of dishes which are not available in any Italian restaurants in Kolkata. One of my personal favourites is Crepelle Con Carne. Honestly speaking I would give more than 5 for this restaurant. The only con is that is very expensive.

Being an Italian born and at heart I am really critical of Italian cuisine considering I've had my fair share. This review has to do with my visit many days ago, I was looking for some originality that is a place which does not only have an Italian name but also thinks like it. Dominos, Pizza Hut and other American MNCs  are a tarnish to the art of pizza. I got to know about the place cause I am an acquaintance of the owner and I was really happy that she was Italian. Now I had mainly gone for pizza as I was nostalgic to the pizza night that I used to have in Italy and I wasn't disappointed, the guy who made the pizza knew what he was doing. With the pizza we ordered some pasta and some other dish, just one blemish was that one topping was missing from the a pizza we had ordered other than that really flavoursome food. The prices can't be complainted about as they are the same in every other restaurants who serve Italian dishes and as far as pizza goes for that price in dominos I would have gotten a much smaller fatter and grotesque pizza. Overall great ambiance and a nostalgic experience.

Authentic Italian, if ever there was one. They have the best thin crust pizza in Calcutta. We also tried their Lamb lasagna which was out-of-this-world. Combined with a mojito, it was the perfect lunch. Ambience is good, with controlled AC, Italian music and Posters to cater to all of your senses. Service is fast and decent. Pricing is a bit on the higher side though. But would go back for their pizza time and again.

The drawings made by children is an extremely innovative gesture. The interiors are well done and the vintage posters add beauty to the place. Be prepared for a big amount on the bill but i can assure it'll be worth every penny.

The cheese was less in quantity though quite a large quantity of toppings was there. Blue eyes mocktel was good. I personally don't liked the taste of the pizza but it's good to try once.

We ordered for Some soup, A Pizza, Pasta and some Chocolate Mousse in the end. Sadly none tasted the way it should have. (Fire and Ice gives you the option to order 2 half Pizzas instead of one - but we were told of this, only after we finished the food).¬†
I think members in my family makes better Pasta & Choco Mousse - and the Pizza was just about decent. The place needs to get its act back together again.

One of the best places in Kolkata to have Italian food, especially thin crust pizzas. Near the Maidan metro station, the location couldn't have been more convenient for thousands of us who work in so many offices around. The ambience is very good, meant for long hours of lunch gapshap. The potted plants add to the vibe. Prices are a little on the steeper side, but totally worth it for infrequent visits when you have some time on your hand.

This Italian restaurant has a very convenient location, right opposite Maidan metro station. The interiors are very bright and colourful with indoor plants, and the ambience perfect for a lazy indulgence. First we ordered Spiedini alla griglia (chicken and vegetable skewers served with green lettuce)- delizioso...that primed our taste buds for the gastronomic extravanganza that followed!! What followed next was Prosciutto de funghi with ham, mushroom and generous helping of mozarella with added bacon and chicken. Move over Dominoes and Pizza hut...and welcome the original pizzas!! The pizza itself took my satisfaction to a whole new level. Next up was lamb bolognese with spaghetti and it too didn't disapppoint. The desserts were another toothsome experience. The Victoria sponge cake was a explosion of sweetness in our mouths. Also, we couldn't have enough of the crepes laden with the goodness of creamy nutella and banana (sigh)!! However, the bill was quite a shocker. A meal for three cost us 3500 bucks, but we really couldn't complain having gone straight to gastronomic heaven!! Looking forward to my next visit already...cheers!

Best Italian in Kolkata? Perhaps yes. Amazing pizza and pasta fare..specially their thin crust pizzas. Spagetti Bolognaise is my favourite there from my last visit. Tad bit expensive, but this place really scores high on ambience. Well-lit, friendly staff, overwhelming choices of food. Parking is a problem in that area, but you must visit there once for some amazing Italian fare.

I come here for dining every week with my friends solely because i love the funghi pizza here. Its my most favourite dish of the menu. But i was highly disappointed today! Rather felt insulted. Before placing the order i clearly mentioned that i want a lot of mushroom in my pizza. Just like the way it used to be. But i was served a pizza with hardly any mushrooms, it rather looked like a margarita pizza. When i complained to the waiter, he said that they would give me a side of mushrooms which would be chargeable. I said i want a pizza al funghi with good amount of mushrooms and asked him to change it since i had specified this before i placed the order. The waiter goes to the kitchen and has a chat with a lady who comes to my table and claims to feel offended that i mentioned that the pizza earlier had a lot of mushrooms but now its just not there. She started arguing without giving me a chance to speak and started to tell me that they wouldnt do any such thing for 50 gms of more mushroom. Instead of fulfilling the customers request, she kept arguing and kept telling me how that pizza would go wasted and the fact that she hates wasting food as if i love doing that. She finally agreed to make me a fresh pizza like i wanted and said next time the extra mushroom would be chargeable. After 20 long minutes of waiting, they serve me the same pizza with extra mushrooms on top. And to add to it, when i receive the bill, the mushrooms are charged for as extras! 130 rupees for the added mushrooms which were not even baked properly since the same pizza which i returned was served me back with the uncooked so called extra mushrooms. I thought the customer was always right. I wonder what policy the lady  at fire and ice follows!

This being my most fav restaurant for the longest time has disappointed me so badly today... I have always been eating funghi pizza since the day it has opened and the quantity of the mushroom has decreased by half over time. On reporting about this before placing order it seemed that I was wrong to send my pizza back and I offended them to have spoken freely about my love for this place and the food.. If 50 gms of mushroom makes no difference why is it not just added like before.. Why should I be paying for extra mushroom when the pizza is already priced at 550+ tax. If needed the price of pizza could have been increased. I always order n pay for extra garlic and extra pesto coz I know I want more than they give and they give enough and the quantity of that hasn't changed.. Infact I have felt I've been offended on sharing my concerns esp when every single staff recognise me there , I eat minimum once a week and over time I have notified that they are putting less mushroom in funghi pizza over and over again. Most of the waiters know my order also by heart that's how much I have loved that place.. I was so shocked today even after my concerns which was only for the quantity of mushrooms having been decreased I was charged for extra and spoken badly by the management. Customer is king and I guess most people have forgotten that over time and clearly it doesn't matter whether they are losing a bunch of most regular customers. Posting the quantity of mushrooms they used to serve a year back which was very generous and all of you can compare to what we get now, along with a recent image of scarce quantity . As a matter of fact the staff confirmed that the quantity of the mushroom that goes in now has been changed and the management denied it to our faces and was extremely rude, while we were eating our dinner she came and started speaking rudely without even hearing our concerns,' actually a single small concern. That being said I will miss  my fav arrabbiata and at my most favourite place to eat. If such a small concern out of love of the food being served for years is offensive then I rest my case !

Visited this place for a weekday lunch! Parking your car at Russel Street is a headache. The place was almost empty. We got a nice and comfy seat for ourselves. Ordered Pollo Pizza and Spaghetti Carbonara. Pizza tasted great. Right amount of cheese and taste wise it was perfect. Spaghetti Carbonara was a little dry. I expected it to be cheesy, though it did not taste bad. Had Fire and Ice delight for drinks which tastes too sweet. It was a wrong choice for me. With strawberry, cranberry, blackberries and apple juice, it is supposed to be sweet.¬†
The place is well decorated and loved it absolutely. Must go place if you love Italian Food!

Fire and Ice is an institution  in itself as far as authentic,yummy italian food is concerned. Evokes nostalgia for me since it was my goto place during my work stint at Russel Street. The Pizzas are thin, crisp and to die for! Their tomato base, the mozzarella they use and their variety of toppings are superb. I woould vouch for their anti pastis as well as the pastas. And to finish of your meal with their nutella filled crepes.....yumm yummm! Im having serious cravings over here!!

located on russel street this place immediately invites in all pasta and pizza lovers. i went in the evening and was craving carbs and i made the right decision in choosing fire and ice.
ambience - warm and cozy (you would wanna bring a date)
service - good and friendly
food - we ordered the pork carbonara and it was delicious, i especially loved the added touch of extra cheese. portion wise its enough and more for one and very filling. i wanted to order their pizzas but next time, coz yes i am coming back!

Food quality-Good
Decor-Good
Service-Very poor
Taste-Good.
I was really disappointed with their service. 1st -It wasn't  crowded in the restaurant still they took 15min to bring up the menucard & more 10 min more to take the order. 2nd-They didn't have the basic curtsey to distribute the plates they just lined up it in the table & left to us for distribution of our own plate. 3rd- They brought us water after the completion of our food.(really??) It was a disgusting as pizza is a dry food it requires water to gulp it down. Comming to the food,the quality was good,portions were appropriate. We ordered Irish coffee with whiskey,Foccacia with mozerell cheese, Arrabiata nd a pizza (no-13) given in the menu.Overall it was ok.

Just as I entered, the place seemed right as the aroma and the ambience brought back some happy memories of time spent in Italy. I had a sense that the food must be good too.

My hunch was proved right as I tried their pizza and the calzone. The Roman style thin crust pizzas made with mostly imported ingredients is surely one of the few¬† good pizza options available in Kolkata and a very very welcome break from the Dominos/Pizza Hut kind of stuff. But their dessert section as well as the main courses do not offer much options. This is primarily a pizza/pasta joint.

Prices are a little bit on the higher side compared to some of its peers, but once in a while one can splurge a little if the offering is good.

Honestly i think this place is overrated. I have been here 3-4 times, even visited their outlet in Kathmandu. Had visited their Picolo once on sarat bose rd ( now shut) which was a complete disaster. Their pizzas are good, minestrone soup too. Anipasti misto is good. Their lasagne is too cheesy,too heavy & bland.¬†

Their apple pie is probably the best in town, the one at Tangerine comes a close second.¬†

They are overpriced! There are better alternatives like TCC, Little Italy.

A perfect escape in between the hectic corporate schedule for a yummy lunch. A place that will be enjoyed max in a group and not suited for someone who is looking for that quiet calm indulgence. Terrific pizzas.

Visited this place after a long time. ¬†We ordered La pizza Verde¬†along with white wine. ¬†Pizza was nice except there was too little jalapeno for my taste. ¬†A little note to myself next time I should ask for extra jalapeno. ¬†Here is my final verdict

+ Good food
+ Fast service

- Noise
- Tight spacing
- Parking could be a problem, at times

One of my fav places for Pizzas in the city. Have been there only twice still i loved it completely and long to go back whenever i am in the city. Though lil on the higher side on the pocket but the food served ¬†compensates it. You really find it hard to compromise on pizza once you have been here.

Ratings 

Ambiance- 4/5 

Food - 4.5/5 

Service - 4/5 

Cost - 3.5/5 
(lil on the higher side)

Overall - 4/5

It was an amazing experience on last Saturday when i visited the place. Very good ambience and good decor.. the staff is super friendly and helpful. now lets come to the main part: the food.
They have a wide range of veg and non veg pizzas. I ordered a hawaian pizza with extra chicken. It had ham, capsicum, and pineapple. The crust was very lite and not over done with cheese... the toppings and the cheese was sufficient ammout.... i enjoyed the pizza very much. Its better that dominos and the pizza huts. One unique thing i noticed is that they have a bottle of spiced olive oil on every table. And it gave another dimension to the pizza.. best pizzaria in kolkata

Fire and ice was on my wish list for quite sometime.
Location: Location is perhaps one of the best thing about this place, being very close to maidan metro station, opposite jeevandeep building.
Ambience: Nice mix of western and Indian cult. Brightly coloured walls cheers up the decor!
Food: We had indeed high expectations considering zomato reviews and the location of the pizzeria.
We ordered:
#fire of Bengal pizza: It is tasty, hot and nice. We loved the thin crust, the minced mutton and cheese topping. It actually lived upto and raised our expectation.
#pollo pizza: It came next and of course seemed rather bland after the fiery Bengal style pizza.
#focaccia with molten mozzarella cheese(garlic): It was full of cheese. The main reason behind tasting it by hard-core non vegetarian is that its recommended in zomato.it was disappointing!
#cold coffee: Quite bad! Very thin and full of ice cubes. Not worth the price.
#sweet lime soda: Ok, nothing remarkable to mention.
Service: Not worth mentioning, pretty ordinary.
Price: Though food is not extraordinary, prices are on the higher side, may be mainly due to its location and ambience.
Overall: According to me the place has great potential, due to its location, ambience and space. Under proper supervision and careful polishing of the management the place can really turn into a glittering diamond of Kolkata!

Fire and Ice is on the edge of Park Street. Conveniently located, this quaint restaurant,amidst the bustle of the office para around it, manages to retain its Bistro-like feel. However, I found the food to be pretty mediocre. I have had a better Spaghetti with Meatballs and definitely a better version of Garlic Bread elsewhere. Not even remotely moderately price, it'll lighten your wallet by quite a few ounces. We had ordered:
1. Focaccia with melted Mozzarella cheese (garlic) 
2. Pepperoni pizza. 
3. Prosciutto e Funghi pizza. 
4.  Hawaiiana pizza. 
5. Pollo pizza. 
6. Carbonara. 
7. Pasta e polpettine. 
8. Assortment of drinks. 
Every dish was priced at an average of ‚Çπ400. While I have no qualms in paying if the food is worthy of it, however I was disappointed. While, I'd go back there just for the ambience, I won't recommend anyone to expect a fabulous gastronomical experience at Fire and Ice. 
PS: The meatballs were excellent though.

When you taste the most authentic Italian food in town, you have to say Va Bene Signora. This is the place to be if you want to taste the best pizza and pasta. The good food coupled with great ambience are perfect for a memorable experience. The place actually lets you be and it does not matter whether you are with friends or girlfriend. The candlelit wooden table, the music, the vintage postars ( such as vacanze romane) and of course the open kitchen and the bar counter make it a one of a kind place. Not to mention the service they provide and the variety of imported wines. This place is hard to resist and definitely teases one to make further visits. Grazie mille.

possibly one of the best pizza joints in town. Everything's great about this place - great food, great ambiance, great folks behind the scenes. I'd rate them a 4, however for the following misses during my last visit: 

- paper napkins instead of usual napkins
- the table that was alloted to us was messy below, i had to call for someone to clean it. 
- the food served this instance was slightly below expectations: pasta sauce was not great, pizza was slightly more burnt etc. 

I still like this place and have been visiting them since they started. all in all a great franchise, one can have bad days... 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an authentic Italian experience.

"Cibo delizioso"... As Italians say.... Fire and ice Pizzeria needs no introduction... And what is amazing is that they maintain the same exquisite standard of food over the years.... We ordered the classic.... Pepperoni pizza.... Dripping with extra virgin olive oil and fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese, blissful to say the least.... And pasta bolognese.. Yummy minced lamb spiced with Italian herbs!!! And to cool it all off.... Fresh watermelon juice!!! A sultry summer dinner couldn't have been better!!! I can't wait to return and dig in again!!!
Pocket pinch: Moderately high... But who cares when the food more than makes up for it!!! ;)

The ambience is average, and the place is over priced.
The food is one of the all-time favourites. 

But, in my recent experiences of going there,  food quality has degraded without a doubt.

Classic Italian restaurant where you can't go wrong. Knowledgeable and friendly staff who can modify dishes to suit your demands (try the pizza with a basil pesto sauce and balsamic caramelized onions, an off the Menu secret!). Going by my sister's demands, best pomodoro sauce in town. The fire and ice pizza is an experimental try, potent LIIT'S, great desserts (tiramsu, lemon cake, Victoria cake), great home fries!

Definite visit when u don't wanna experiment something too wild. Classic Italian sticking to its roots!

This is truly a place where you can get authentic Italian food. To start with, the ambience is excellent, with the posters of old movies everywhere. I went at an odd timing, so didn't see much of the crowd which comes to the restaurant. But since it is located at Park Street, you can be certain it's a good looking crowd you would get there. :D The food was good, but ofcourse there is always space for improvement. The gnocchi and pizzas we ordered were good, but yes the pizza could have been better. The staff was good, well behaved. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and would like to come back here in future.

PS: If I could give a rating between 3.5 and 4, I would definitely give a 3.8, because 3.5 seems too low, and I have to be back to this place to give it a 4.0 and above.

I haven't eaten pizza better than F&I's anywhere. 
Ambience, food, service are top notch. 
Although the seating could be a little more comfortable; but then again - the wooden chairs lend an authenticity to the pizzeria so I don't know if my complaint is justified. 
You need to ask for John, get garlic, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms in your pizza - ask them to bake it well. Call for the white sauce pasta. 
Thank me later.

Fire and Ice was long-due and topped my wishlist specially because of it's 'authentic Italian' fame. So last evening when I finally got a chance to visit this place along with my friend, I was really excited. But unfortunately the experience was rather disappointing.

The interiors are good with pictures of classic movie stills and vintage brands that scream Italy, complemented with Indian themes and old Bollywood pictures. It also has nice lighting, lots of green foliage and a classic bar counter, but the music they played was too slow for my liking.

So it was a long day and although both of us were really hungry, we did not intend to have an elaborate dinner, instead wanted to grab a chicken pizza with some beer. But sadly, the menu had only one chicken variant, Pollo, and we had to settle for it. Surprisingly, the server neither asked nor served us water which is the very first and basic thing at any restaurant. That was followed by another bizarre act, they left the plates and cutlery stacked on the table and we had to lay them by ourselves! WHO DOES THAT?!

Coming to the food, the pizza was thin-crust but strictly OKAY as compared to the price, but the beer was fresh and chilled. Later we ordered a Tiramisu which tasted fine, but lacked precision in the presentation. Again that too could not justify the hefty price that they charged.

Our bill came around Rs. 1500 which was not at all value for money. Although the menu looked intriguing enough to encourage a second visit, but owing to the sky-high prices, the service and taste left a lot to be desired.

I went to fire and ice after a long time for dinner! It was a Saturday n it was bustling with crowd. However fire n ice went much below my expectations this time n it was shocking. 
First there were paper napkins on the table and they said were short of the cloth napkins! Out of the entire order only lasagne and chocolate mousse were made apt! Rest were too bland n could not satisfy the taste buds! Be it the Virgin mojito or the fire n ice pizza or the penne Alfredo!
It was just a high pocket pinch with no satisfaction!
Wouldn't want to go there agn for such blandness!

I swear it was the best pizza I had ever.. perfectly crunchy,  juicy & thin crust.. the dessert CHOCOLATE MOUSSE was a sinfully   sweet ending.

But about pizzas or pasta or spaghetti I would say some preparations could have been a bit better...
But the price of the place is LONG ISLAND ICE TEA...
Simply a awesome cocktail...
Just no comparison to it with others...
Have tried it at other places but this one was the best of the lot...
But the thing is the place is overpriced like anything...
To sum up if u r not paying the bill it's the best place to go...lol...

Fire and Ice pizzeria started mid 2005 by an Italian Chef, Annamaria Forgione who hails from Naples, Italy. There are two outlets, one in Kolkata and the other at Kathmandu.¬†
I visited this place because of my love for Italian cuisine and with such high ratings on Zomato, I couldn't give this place a miss.¬†

Located conveniently just next to Jeevan Deep Building and can be easily spotted. ¬†¬†

Ambience: Very lively ambience with striking red and black interiors. Chairs, a tad too small, for a restaurant, not very cosy. ¬†

Service: The serving time is commendable but, one thing that really bothered me, was that the plates or cutlery were not laid, rather was kept neatly on one side of the table. Doesn't look good if the customers lay there own plates and cutlery in a proper restaurant. Hope you rectify this next time.¬†

Food: My First visit so, I can testify only on what I tasted.

Focaccia with melted mozzarella cheese garlic (Garlic Bread): Looked really promising. tasted a tad to flat but I must say the chef was really liberal spreading the mozzarella.¬†

Hawaiiana 12" woodfire pizza: Dig into the thin slices and hallelujah! Completely mesmerizing aroma and an incredible gastronomical piece of art. The toppings were exactly what one expects from a Hawaiian pizza. Very fresh toppings and some added fresh basil complimented the cheese palate. 

I hope they make all of their pizzas with equal love and care and each one of them a marvel. I have to revisit and try others too.

Penne Alfredo al Funghi: This was even better than the pizza. Just the right amount of cheese made the alfredo sauce to die for. Funghi/Mushrooms added flavor to the sauce. A Must have dish here.¬†

Drinks:

Fire and Ice CLASSIC Long Island Iced Tea (LIIT): Sinfully refreshing and comes with a bottle of coke to top as per taste.¬†

Price: For two without desserts but two rounds of alcoholic beverage comes to around INR 3500. So a bit heavy on the pocket restaurant. 

Overall a must visit place for anyone who wants to taste authentic Italian dishes.

Liked-¬†
Chocolate mouse - nice; creamy, chocolatey and not too sweet. was supposed to be served with cream but was served with ice-cream. The ice -cream was good too, creamy and not too sweet. I liked them individually but as a combination it was weird.¬†

Disliked-¬†
> Pizza Alle Miste - Cold and soggy. A bit tasteless. Stingy amount of toppings.
> Wine was served in Mocktail glass.

>> Service - Arrogant and rude waiters. Seems like they are doing us a favour by taking the order.¬†
As we were getting late, I gave him my card and asked for the bill but he swiped the card before presenting the bill. Then he was flustered and rolled his eyes as I asked for the bill.
The second time, the machine where we punch the pin timed out and he decided to throw a tantrum and came the third time saying, "Are you sure, you are ready?"¬†
This is the first time I have seen a server not knowing how to use the machine and having to go back to the cash counter to enter the bill amount and then ask the customer to be quick or he will make a fuss! Quite stupid!

Paid over 2K for two drinks, pizza and coke. Not value for money.

Not happy. Not going back!

Having heard great things about this place I had very high expectations about it. But sad to say, it didn't meet those expectations. The tomato based pasta sauce was too tangy. The quality of the food didn't match the prices charged for them. The only good thing about the place was the portion sizes.

I ordered lunch from here last Saturday. After having passed by this place for the last 3 years and now working in office just nearby giving this place a try could not be given a miss and was something which was long overdue. Having said that, the pizza ordered was Napoletana Cheese (got Mushrooms added separately) perfectly made thin crust pizzas - really amazing came packed in a heavy cardboard box which felt like something really big is inside. Along with the pizza Alfredo Ai Funghi (white sauce penne pasta with mushrooms), Fritto Misto (assorted vegetables fried in a batter mix) and Spiedini De Verdire (Vegetable Skewers) were ordered. The pasta had a very simple and smooth flavour - light and plain. The person taking the order was kind enough to call and mention about Fritto Misto mentioning it would be dipped in oil and confirming if I was aware what it really was. Fritto Misto was a miss in terms of taste, finishing and the very fact that it comes from a place like Fire and Ice. The Spiedini De Verdire (vegetable skewers) consisted of two skewers with assorted vegetables grilled with mozzarella cheese - unique offering but a must try if you like having exotic variants of different vegetables. Having said that, of all the things I ordered the Pizza was right on the money in terms of taste, packaging and of course the feel of having it from a pizza joint that enjoys such a great reputation!

I am quite choosy when it comes to Italian cuisine. Its more than a pizza or lasagne or pasta! For me a pizza has to be thin crust with decent toppings and the right amount of cheese. This place perfectly goes with my kinda taste. The other retail franchises doesnt work for me at all.

The lamb lasagne is delightful though slightly dry but its ok as long as its yummy.  Ummm order anything that looks good and grab a glass of wine with it for that perfect evening. The ambiance too is very much designed for the dine in experience.

Best Italian cuisine in Kolkata. Period. And they also serve amaretti and campari, which are really hard to find in Calcutta. Wish they were a little less expensive, though.

When it comes to Pizzas and other Italian dishes.. Fire and ice always comes to my mind.. It is super tasty.. It's an awsome place for dates and family get together.. Even though it's a bit pricy still it's really very nice ..

Having heard great things about this place I had very high expectations about it. But sad to say, it didn't meet those expectations. The tomato based pasta sauce was too tangy. The quality of the food didn't match the prices charged for them. The only good thing about the place was the portion sizes.

I ordered lunch from here last Saturday. After having passed by this place for the last 3 years and now working in office just nearby giving this place a try could not be given a miss and was something which was long overdue. Having said that, the pizza ordered was Napoletana Cheese (got Mushrooms added separately) perfectly made thin crust pizzas - really amazing came packed in a heavy cardboard box which felt like something really big is inside. Along with the pizza Alfredo Ai Funghi (white sauce penne pasta with mushrooms), Fritto Misto (assorted vegetables fried in a batter mix) and Spiedini De Verdire (Vegetable Skewers) were ordered. The pasta had a very simple and smooth flavour - light and plain. The person taking the order was kind enough to call and mention about Fritto Misto mentioning it would be dipped in oil and confirming if I was aware what it really was. Fritto Misto was a miss in terms of taste, finishing and the very fact that it comes from a place like Fire and Ice. The Spiedini De Verdire (vegetable skewers) consisted of two skewers with assorted vegetables grilled with mozzarella cheese - unique offering but a must try if you like having exotic variants of different vegetables. Having said that, of all the things I ordered the Pizza was right on the money in terms of taste, packaging and of course the feel of having it from a pizza joint that enjoys such a great reputation!

Last time I went to fire and ice was precisely 3 years back. Before that it was a weekly stop for me. They really need to introduce something new. Apart from that they were in fact the first restaurant in the city to introduce liquor with food. So they have been trend setters.

Probably my most favourite place for Italian food in Calcutta!¬†

Their drinks are moderately priced, and they have a good bar - very well-stocked. Very prompt service. Their food is out of the world! Just the right balance, not too oily or spicy, and never over or under cooked. Favourites are:
1. Pasta salad with tuna
2. Pepperoni pizza
3. Aglio oglio spaghetti (MUST TRY!)
4. Risotto - though they could try and include sea food risotto in their menu

Qualifies for comfort food. :)

Just went to fire and ice today, to eat a pizza and lasagna. I'm sorry to say, but Fire and Ice SUCKS. They've taken such austere cost-cutting measures, its disgusting. There was barely any tomato pury on my lasagna, and that tinge of sweetness which needs to be there was completely lost. There was half a stick of asparagus, instead of the full stick that should be present. Just cheese and pasta in my mouth, and they're charging 650/- for that? 

I ordered a half and half pizza (half margherita, half alle miste), and I was VERY surprised when I got the cheque. They're charged me 0.65 of each pizza's costs, instead of 0.50 of each. Their server gave a stupid explanation bordering around them putting more cheese or something along that lines in the pizza. That is Bullshit. The Alle Miste comes at 585, and if I half it and supplement it with a half margherita, my cost should come lower, and I shouldn't be charged 685. Next time, I'll order a miste, and remove the toppings from half the pizza, giving me a half margherita and a half miste, at the price of 585, since Fire and Ice has evolved into nonsensical money looting caterers.¬†

Besides, I was scavenging for any pury I could find in the pizza, which too had, ironically, lost its sweetness. So not only do they overcharge extravagantly, they have the audacity to reduce the quality of the food.

Ambiance- 2.5/5 (Music sucks)
Quality of food- 2/5 (w.r.t to the pricing, plus austere measures)
Service - 1.5/5 (They're ironically faster on days when they're full with people, unlike when I went where there were a few people yet they took so long, plus the servers gave the most stupid reasoning possible).¬†
Pricing- 1/5 (Totally not worth the price).¬†

Overall 1.5 on 5

Fire and ice is arguably one of the best Italian restaurants in Calcutta. The dishes are normally good as well.
The RANDELLE is a great starter and one can call it their signature dish. The CAPRESSE had olive oil unevenly distributed which made it a very normal dish in terms of taste.
The rice in the RISOTTO was perfectly cooked and  ratio between the rice and cream was well balanced. The PIZZA was a classic thin crust pizza which you can go on eating without realizing that you have been over eating. The ALIO OLIO pasta was great and cooked very well.
The restaurant's NUTELLA CREPES are a perfect ending to a great meal.
The service was fine in the starting but the crepes took too long.
The staff were good.

Pizza is a very ordinary food item for me. Something very easily made ¬†at home if you have the right ingredients. Having said that I decided to try Fire and Ice today ¬†only because my friend wanted to have vegetarian meal.
Ambiance - Yuppie with ¬†a Bar n all!!
Menu - choices vast.
Ingredients on/ in Pizza, salad and drink - very fresh and authentic.
Toppings on Pizza very sparse.. like one sun-dried tomato piece per slice,cheese not enough. For the price they could do much better!!

1. Tiramisu ¬†Cold Coffee drink - Different, worth a shot.
2. Pizza ¬†with ¬†Sundried Tomato/ olives - very stingy w/ the topping and cheese.
3. Spinach Salad w/ goat cheese ¬†and bread basket - good and very fresh.
4.Brownie - Excellent, made with the good stuff and walnuts.

I like fire and ice for a very simple reason - they use high quality ingredients and don't try to do too much with it . Eat the pasta here, and there won't be too much in it, but you will be able to distinctly taste each and every ingredient that has gone into it. I love the ambience - usually come here with a friend, have a glass of wine, enjoy some fresh pizza and pasta and end up feeling very satisfied and happy at the end of the meal! My latest favorite is the Fire of Bengal pizza :-)

Food was good. Ordered the focaccia garlic bread with cheese & 12 inch pizza - half fire of bengal & half pepperoni. Both were very tasty however if your not in the mood for indian then avoid the fire of bengal coz it tastes something like kheema pao. For dessert ordered the chocolate mousse which was light & chocolatey & too yummy!!! Shall definitely visit again!

An authentic experience is what you get when you seek something above the rest. One of the best Italian restaurants it is and I was never disappointed with it. The thin crust pizza is their speciality along with many more.

Beginning from the starters to desserts it ensures a fine journey. The menu is quite spectacular with different combinations of meals and beverages.

It's a bit expensive but then hey, you get the treatment quite like it. You can expect somewhere close to Rs1200-1400 for 2 in the place. It's very refreshing l must say.

Perfect destination for italian food. We ordered skewers for startars which is ok, then in main course we ordered Picatta di pollo with sphageti - which is sphageti with chicken breast cooked in olive oil. The taste and look of this food is heaven and so is the chicken lasagna. I have to say instead of trying pizza one should try out these typical italian dishes.. And I found the ambience inside the restaurant is very warm and cozy..

The best Italian food In the entire city you will find it here. Its fresh awesome taste. Pizza & Pasta both are equally good & one can even try soup & salads also. Fresh juice or drinks served are also good. Ambience is nice & on the walls you can see paintings which gives vintage look to the entire restaurant. must visit and eat any pizza & caprese salad with fresh lime or any other drink. They must come up with new concept to put small miniature herb pots like basil , microgreens and keep on the table which will be more interactive when one eats and actually plucks the herbs and eat with pizza or pasta. Cheers!!!

Yes you do get authentic thin crust pizzas but if your are clung to Dominos/ Pizza hut you might not like this place. The pizza itself could do with a bit more of topping. The price that you have to pay for this pizza is kind of a set back!

Heard about their pizzas and thought of tasting them...but for a salad love like me its really very difficult to refrain from their salads.
the place is good....its quiet and u can chat a lot ..for a long long time if u have the desire to do so
I was meeting a friend after a long time and we decided to chat over a glass of ice tea...
so minty so lovely ...soon we completed sipping at three glasses of them :)
next we ordered for pasta salad
And And And...it was sheer delight
fresh ingredients ....authentic flavour....and the heavenly aroma of olive oil
we had garlic bread to compliment it and it was a nice combo
love the 2 hours we spent over there...
Want to try their pizzas...may be another day with another friend...
:)
So if u come here ...go for a pasta salad instead of a pizza ...it will be different and real good.
N.B:-...the only negative point is the service...was a bit slow and the waiters lacked attentiveness....but then the food compensated for that

If you are a tomato person, their Spaghetti Pomodoro with some extra sauce is A MUST MUST MUSTTTTTTTTTTT TRY. For starters the Rondelle di Patate Fritte is also highly recommended. For all those who want to get high, their LITs is the best of all the places I have tried. Italian lovers, do not miss this place!

Pesto pasta and the pizza alle verdure miste that we ordered were very good, specially the pizza base was soft and very different from the ones we are used to having at dominis and pizza hut.. that apart, the chocolate sparkle shake made for a delightful evening and excellent outing...

The only thing not so good about it was that it took more time to bring the bill than it took them to serve the food ;)

We went there on a weekday night, and it wasn't crowded, so the service was very good ‚Äì although it did take a while for the food to arrive. The pizzas were actually quite proper ‚Äì thin crust, authentic tomato base and the toppings were a natural fit. With very few pizza options (real pizza, that is) in Kolkata Fire and Ice is a welcome arial. We don't live in Kolkata, so this was new for us. The mocktails are good, and the Funghi pizza is done quite right. Some of the other dishes aren't necessarily what you'd get in top Italian places around the globe, but A for effort here in Kolkata.

As soon as you step inside you are treated well, provided with the menu card and a lot of options to choose from. It was around 8 P.M I reached the place and it was moderately empty. The plan was to order a pizza and a spaghetti but the waiter informed us that the pizza is going to come in 8 pieces, so we (read me n my sister) decided to go with only the Capricciosa pizza and a fresh mint mock-tail. The pizza was perfectly thin, sufficient toppings and authentic in its taste. The mocktail had a nice tangy flavour to it, and fresh mint is always refreshing to me. The ambience is justified with frames all over the place. I have deducted 1 mark for the screaming children and people talking so loudly, forgetting the basic etiquettes! 

I would be soon coming back for the spaghetti and tiramisu and I hope to enjoy a nice and quiet dinner that time. God be kind.

Okay I'm genuinely impressed, after all these years this restuarant still looks good, feels good and the food is great. Staff are friendly and prices are reasonable. We tried the La Pizza Verde and Paesanna. The veg pizza was good and i recommend the non veg one... I loved the combination of bacon and spinach.

Just want to add that the fact that they had some pretty nice special offers was a plus for me. I opted for the free soft drinks... ice tea all the way.

This was the first authentic Italian joint and now that it's about 10 years old, every visit still feels like the first and the taste is the same even today. Hard to believe that the standards of cleanliness and quality of food can be maintained day in day out. Impeccable service and not very expensive. The bar is rich on menu too. The taste is so settled on the buds that many other places feel just not up to the mark. Cheers F&I!

Aglio Olio e peperoncino. Funghi, arlecchino, Bruschetta, focaccia - they all rock. The ambience is even better than the food that makes it all the more fun. Food is as exquisite in taste as it can be. Every experience here and the consistency of food makes it all the more a compelling reason to come back. With Artists' posters all around from the 70s 80s, retro with contemporary seating makes the place come alive further.

Fire and Ice the Pizzeria and Bar on Middleton Street (crossing of Russell Street and Middleton Street) opened it‚Äôs door in July, 2005. The Neapolitan owners of this purely Italian restaurant landed in Nepal in 1988 with her family and settled there. They opened the first Fire and Ice in Kathmandu, a joint which none other than the Time Magazine says ‚Äúserves nirvana on a plate‚Äù. The journey from Kathmandu to Kolkata was but, a natural progression. What sets this pizzeria apart is it‚Äôs wood-oven baked, freshly-made dough with a tangy and robust tomato sauce prepared in true Sicilian style. This is perhaps the closest Kolkata has come to authentic Italian Pizza as far as fast food joints are concerned. Reading the menu, I daresay, requires know-how of the Italian lingo, but that is the only work one puts in. The rest is pure and unsullied indulgence. Every bite on the menu transports one to the streets of Italy. 

The starters provide a brief but interesting choice of Antipasto Misto or if you prefer Focaccia with melted mozzarella Garlic Cheese or Rondelle di Patate Fritte. The pizza section spoils one for choice, the Prosciutto e Funghi (Ham & Mushroom Pizza) or the melt-in-your-mouth Paesana and Calzone Coi Formaggi (Calzone with Ricotta and French Spinach) pizzas are flavours heretofore unknown to the Kolkata palate, and yes, there‚Äôs even a Fire of Bengal Pizza. Side orders of Lasagna Tradizionale or Vegeteriana or the highly recommended Crespelle Con Carne provide sustained accompaniments to the divine Pizzas.

The Pastas here are a class apart. You could opt for Spaghetti or Penne. Recommended pastas here are Alfredo al Prociutto (Creamy Parmesan Sauce with Ham and seasoned peas), Piccata di Pollo (Marinated Chicken breast with olive oil, mushrooms, tomatoes and herbs on a bed of imported spaghetti), the Bolognese and of course the Al Fiume (Fresh river King Prawns with Olive oil, tomatoes and parsley on a bed of spaghetti). They serve a delectable range of Risottos and Salads as well. The desserts offer a range of imported Italian soft Ice Creams, Crepes with various toppings of ones‚Äô choice, a delightful Apple Pie and Chocolate Mousse. 

For foodies of the city who dote on authentic Italian food, this restaurant is a must try. The restaurant has a website at http://www.fireandicepizzeria.com .

I am surprised that i have been on Zomato for more than a year and still have not reviewed The Holy Grail of my family for italian food... FIRE and ICE!!!!

in my family when this place had opened to almost last year.... if it was italian we had only 3 places to go... Hyaat.... Taj and then came FIRE AND ICE!!!! soon we realized that we are visiting this place more than the hyatt or the taj just because of the place and the feel of it and the of course the food...

Soon we did realize that we have fixated the whole menu and what to order... from the starters being the Patate Fritte and a Mista Salad.. to a pesto pasta and a funghi pizza... this place food is spot on...

whenever we go there we find so many people form other countires seated and upon asking they will always say that this place serves the most authentic italian in the city...

more so no matter if this place is empty of full to the brim... the food quality does not change even a single percent... meaning in kolkata even during durga pujas which makes the city food take a turn... this place (if you do manage to get a seat) will still serve the ultimate experience of a dinner that you can imagine...

the ambiance of this place is of a casual diner with a noisy look around and everything though the prices of the same is not like that at all..

but for the food that they serve it is well worth every penny...

An any time visit for me for great food

ate here last year, ordered garlic bread and my personal favourite, a cheese and pepperoni pizza. the pizza here tastes like it should. fresh, and totally yummy. do not compare with the regular dominoes fare! even the garlic bread was a step above the normal doughy bread we get everywhere. that they serve alcohol is a bonus. 
i loved their seating arrangement, and the fact that the place is always full and abuzz. it feels alive! not like you typical restaurant, usually sleepy. 
worth many many visits, this one :)

The name might not seem very Italian, but this place serves one of the best and most simple Italian dishes, I have ever had in Calcutta. With a well balanced menu of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, their simple pizzas; the margherita and pollo are fantastic! One might try the pastas, which are cooked to perfection; 'alla dante'. My favourites being the the carbonara, arrabbiata and bolognese. For desert, you might want to have the crepes, my favourite being the one with Nutella. But since I am not a salad or antipasti loving person, I have always avoided having them. The best time to visit would be for a weekend lunch or a weekday dinner.

Great pizzas. Love the pepperoni and many of the veggie ones. The pastas are yummy too. I really enjoyed the spaghetti carbonara. The focaccias are delicious too. I love the decor and it attracts a very international crowd. Word of caution, do not taste the olive oil that's found on every table like I once did. I'm pretty sure it's for decorative purposes only!

So be it pizzas or anything else you wont be disappointed. The selection of drinks also is good. Without mentioning any specific dishes I would say you can order all that you want and it will be good. The only point is that its a little heavy on the pocket so that is something once has to consider if u wanna go there regularly

Best Italian restaurant I've been to (so far), manages to make its way to my list of must-visit eateries in town. Parigina, Funghi and Melanzane are amongst my favourite pizzas that taste even better after adding Chilli Oil and sprinkling some Parmesan cheese on top.  Pesto isn't my bowl of pasta though, I realized. Oh, and their Apple Pie is possibly the best, so make sure to try that if you haven't already. Looking forward to trying their Bolognese Spaghetti and Prosciutto Pizza, on my next visit.

I am not going to meander much, but to hit the nail I would regard it as the haven for the one's who just can't have less than a proper authentic Italian. Selection of the menu is well conservative and non-experimental and almost the same for many months of Sundays. 
Service is good but mind it that the waiters find it uncouth if you tell them to serve. I have tried all the salads (which are only three), and for each time I was highly criticized by my fellow mates for ordering it.
Dessert section is too limited but there are a plethora of options to choose from in the anti-pasta, pizza, mains and of course pasta. 
The pricing is towards the higher side and with the same budget one can always choose Little Italy. But still Fire and Ice is a good one time visit with your pals.

The only place that comes to my mind when i think about italian food is fire and ice. I discovered this place in my college days while one of my bunking sessions with friends. This place offers the perfect recipe for a chilled out evening with friends n family. My personal favourites from the food menu are its anti pasti platter n picatta di pollo.. Their virgin mojito is d most refreshing drink to beat the heat. The one place i recommend n always opt for when i wanna go out.

I first discovered this restaurant on a holiday to Kolkata back in 2008 and instantly fell in love with it. The Spaghetti Carbonara here is so good that I couldn't get it off my mind till I visited Kolkata a few years after that and went straight to Fire And Ice to have it again. I recently visited Kolkata again and tried a bunch of new things from their menu.  The Non Veg Antipasto Misto is really delicious and comes with bite sized pieces of a variety of things. The only improvement they could make is if it had a little more non veg in it as its pretty much the same as the vegetarian version besides a few slices of Pepperoni. We had a bunch of vegetarian and non vegetarian pizzas and all of them were really good. A great place for Italian cuisine in Kolkata! Don't miss it!

The experience of dining at Fire and Ice was good. Even though the place was very crowded we got a seat without having to wait too long. The service was good and prompt and the food was very fresh and tasty. We ordered for a pizza which had the wheat based bread and it was a healthy version of the regular pizzas we eat. The ingredients were crisp and fresh and that added flavor to our pizzas. The wine they served was served in the right temperature. All in all it was a good family dinner at ice and spice.

Undoubtably the best ITALIAN restaurant in Kolkata! 

Fire and Ice has a great ambience, fast service, very hospitable and well trained, they never fail to disappoint their customers! 
I've been there a couple of times and everytime it has been an utter delight! The Pizza's are the best I've had in Calcutta, thin crust, cheesy, crisp everything you'd like to have in a pizza. 

They are a lot of variety! Even the bakes, pastas, garlic breads, risottos and aglio olio is great! They have a bar so alcohol is present too and the prices are very standard and totally worth every penny! I've always had a great time and never been disappointed. They have some nutella roll there in desserts which is just so delicious! 

a 5/5 favourite for me. If it's Italian it's Fire and Ice, ALWAYS! <3 

A must try!

Undoubtedly the best place for pizza in Kolkata. This is my go-to place for all those pizza/italian cravings. Over my many-visits I have tried all their pizzas - Prosciutto, Paesana, La marinara, Hawaiiana, Capprisiosa. And I always get the half-n-half option in toppings which is great way to explore the flavors.  The prawn-pizza La Marinara is my favorite with a good cold beer, as also the chunky pineapples in Hawaiiana. They serve very good pasta and desserts. The apple pie being the best I have tasted in this town. However on my last visit the Tiramisu felt a little dry and hence disappointing. But the authentic food, great flavors, great ambiance are all you need for an amazing evening. That is very much what this place offers.

We first ordered drinks and they served nachos along with it....they seemed to care very little about service. Waiting time was insane and finally they added a couple of items extra on the bill.
Though they reversed the charges, the service of the people who were serving was disappointing...
With the kind of prices they charge, you are bound to expect good service atleast.

Even before Casa Toscana and Spaghetti Kitchen came in to the fray Fire and Ice was dishing out the best Italian food in town. It still serves some pretty good Italian food. The decor is a little casual and is decorated with frames of movies and movie stars' posters. There is a bar counter which is quite appealing as far as I am concerned. The food is quite good here. I totally love the pastas here and unlike Spaghetti Kitchen the pastas in red sauce are really very good here. This is one of the few restaurants in Kolkata that started serving food with imported processed meats. They still continue to do so. They have quite a no. of amazing pastas and some very innovative pizzas. My favourite pizzas are the pepperoni and the proscuito pizzas. Do try the pasta with meat balls and the spaghetti bolognese. The lasgana too is pretty good. In desserts I like the crepes. The only cons are the decor and the seating. It just is not comfortable. Else this place has no other negatives.

I have been a regular here for past 4 years now and never get tired of it, even though most of the menu has remained unchanged.
Probably the reason for this is that it is the closest you will get to authentic Italian food half way across the globe. The place is owned and operated by an Italian lady, Mrs. Annamaria Forgione,  and she has basically used her own recipes, as i understand from the news articles. But that aside, I have always enjoyed the simpler, more rustic Italian cuisine. These dishes are more wholesome and satisfying than complicated ones like what you would get in star hotels and restaurants. The pizzas are excellent as are the pastas and breads. They just need to work on their desserts.
I can't suggest any dish in particular as they are all great but my regulars are spaghetti arabiatta (the best arabiatta sauce I have had in Kolkata) and the Fire of Bengal Pizza (spicy lamb keema pizza). Yes, thats not very authentic, but then the potato rosemary pizza and the 3 cheese pizza are superb as well.

This is my favourite italian restaurant mainly because you can enjoy your food in the great ambience and another because the food here is good too. 
Even though the costs are that of fine dining it sadly isnt. 
Must have: 
Chocolate mousse with ice cream and al fredo fungi pasta. Yummmm.

Fire and ice, the place me and my sister chose to relish good Italian food after hefty shopping. Very hungry we ordered 2 antipasti, a pizza and risotto. Flavoured olive oil and balsamic glaze given to further enhance the flavours. The ambience is very comforting and many foreigners are seen enjoying the food. Antipasti was just awesome! Pizza was thin crash crust, fine quality mozzarella cheese, a little burnt base on the corners ending up to be the perfect and authentic Italian style pizza. Many may find it bland, but it is very flavourful. Risotto was perfectly cooked and creamy. A great satisfaction and smile emerged on my face after eating everything.

The place gives a happy vibe. It didn't seem to be an authentic italian cuisine. It was amazing to indulge in enticing aromas of freshly baked whole wheat pizza. The chicken steak served with steamed rice was not really up to the mark and didn't live up to my expectations. 

You might have to shell out more and much to my chagrin, it is not really worth it.

Okay for one time visit.. There are better places in the city..I rather go to Spaghetti Kitchen or Taj Bengal for a good meal..

Went with my "Italian food crazy" children. Normally picky eaters they enjoyed the Carbonara and Lasagna. Even the desserts were good. We had  caramel custard and Apple pie. While the restaurant was not that crowded I was not very impressed with the service. Quite indifferent with really no initiative to service. But since I got what I wanted and it tasted good I don't penalise them for the poor service.

Fire and ice undoubtedly the best Italian restaurant in Kolkata situated in Russel street. The ambience is great with great servers who are very friendly. There are not many options for veg appetizers but the items available are awesome. Pizza here is authentic thin crust unlike other pizzas available in the city which are triple the size. Pasta here is also very good.  For the appetizer basket of foccasia is good and for the main course Pesto pasta and Napolitano with cheese pizza should not be missed. Anyone opting for a mocktail should try the ice mint cooler it's really  refreshing

The best pizzas in town. In India, where you usually have places serving Indianised versions of pizzas - both good and bad, this is a place which could give any pizza place any where in the world a run for it's money. 

There nothing quite as warming as good Italian food and good pizzas are some where on top of the Italian food mountain. Fire and Ice produces great pizzas, not just good ones. Subtle, delicate flavors, great cheese. 

 The interiors are excellent too. It is the right balance of chilled out and fine dining. 

This is one of the places which are a must stop in the Kolkata food map.

As you see a painting of city taxis at one end, and a poster of Fellini's 'La Dolce Vita' you feel wonderful. Anita Ekberg could do a little dance of joy here and it wouldn't be out of place.

First off, I am reviewing only the vegetarian food. 

I have been to fire and ice about 5 times in the last 2-3 years. It started off as a decent restaurant with good food. On my last few visits however, it is very evident that the quality has diminished. 

It is a popular place for Italian food and I always have some expectations going in. But its always a let down. 

The ambiance is decent, spacious and cafe-like. The seating doesn't justify the price - not comfortable (read - wooden chair bottoms) for a restaurant so priced. 

There are literally NO appetizers (menu shows 10, all are basically bruschettas/garlic breads). The vegetable with melted cheese was rubbish.

The pesto pastas and mushroom risotto lacked flavor, were overcooked and soggy. The Funghi pizza was about the only thing that was average. 

Overall, a place with popularity, but no substance, not sure why it is rated so high.

Pepperoni pizza, apple pie and a bottle of beer. It's excellent for a Calcutta pizzeria. When I say fine for Calcutta, I mean... in Bombay the amount of pepperoni would certainly be more and slightly more cheesy. The only complain about the apple pie is it lacks cinnamon. And the price, it's just too much for pizza. Working in its favour, is the midnight-closing hour.

Fire & Ice is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city. Located in Middleton row, the place is very spacious, comfortable and serves a good, long menu. The service is warm but may be a bit slow at times.

I love the thin crust pizzas it offers especially the fire and ice pizza. The italian preparations are very authentic and amazing. The risotto they serve is too good. The restaurant is priced on the higher side but its worth every dime spent in there. Deserts include several crepe preparations. I just love their crepes and the one that i would recommend every visitor is the Banana and nutella crepe that is heavenly.

Pros:
1) Spacious, comfortable
2) Delicious and authentic pizzas, italian food
3) Amazing crepes
4) One of the best italian joints in town

Cons:
1) Bit heavy on your pockets

With the surge of Italian restaurants in the city, Fire and Ice has certainly become one to reckon with. Authentic Italian food, coupled with lively ambience and super-good service makes the food experience here a very satisfying one.

We were a vegetarian bunch, and I must say, the food choices in the said category were plenty. The lasagna is one of the best I have had in Kolkata, and that's saying something, as most restaurants have a very wrong idea of what lasagna essentially is. The mushroom risotto though was a let-down, but the pizza (we had 3 varieties of it) was insanely good. The spaghetti was good, though could have been better. 

As for the location, its in Russel Street, which is in near proximity from the most frequented areas in Kolkata. Also, please reserve at least 5-6 hours in advance, as it has a good list of patrons. You might feel a slight pocket-pinch. but you know what, the restaurant deserves a try.

Happy Feasting!

Kolkata's hottest hip and much talked about restaurant fire and ice is a comfortable
above the average eclectic restaurant, its an Italian food lover's haven. 

It offers modern european menu specially Italian food which is truly mouth
watering to suit every taste. Overall enjoyed our evening here, staff were friendly, knowledgeable and
attentive, you really can't ask for more than that, very well presented.Though they have a bar attached, the menu is not very extensive
We were a family of 9 and we ordered assorted items to share
like pasta, soup. salads and pizzas..that is when my mind lost it!

This is by far hands down no questions asked the best pizza I have ever had in 
entire Kolkata... ever..simple, thin crust having good amount of chew and crispiness to it,
with balanced topping of olive oil, mozzarella
and tomato sauce.. I literally still have dreams of the dough..

Final say.. besides being a pricey restaurant it has become my favorite atmosphere
to dine in, be it with family or friends. I highly recommend everyone living in or visiting Kolkata
to drop by this joint to experience good authentic Italian cuisine. You'll not be disappointed ;)

Bon Appetite!

Being a debut visit to the place, must say that the place serves pure Italian food in the city (with no Indian Taste in the food)

Located in the heart of city, please do make reservation before coming here since the place is full.

Food: The food is quite authentic Italian where the thin crust pizza are to die for.. We ordered Garlic Cheese bread where it serves 8 pieces (pizza size), Whole wheat thin crust pizza (jalapeno) and one spaghetti.. The taste was pure Italian and they do not have any other topping for your pizza (Since we were vegetarian)

Price: It's a bit pricey but paying for good food this should not be considered.

Service: The service was quick while serving food but overall it was little delay while asking for suggestion for order, water etc...

Do visit this place for sure...

Honestly, as far as Italian restaurants go, I'd rate this the highest in our city. 
The food items are all so heavenly in taste, and there's the authentic Italian feel to it......not Indianized.
Whether it's a pizza or pasta or any of the antipasti, this place is just brilliant.
I love the decor too. The walls are filled with pictures .....and several old Hollywood stars. There's a very classy yet warm touch to the ambience.
The prices, I'll admit, are a tad high. Yet, for this quality and service, I wouldn't mind paying up.....and adding a proper tip.
A great experience, truly.

The staff uniform is also very trendy and they have their heads covered which is very hygienic and adds to the presentation. They donot serve any dish on your plate.  They take your order and serve the food on your table.

Food recommendations:
Garlic bread
Potato item
Fungi pizza
spaghetti aglio oglio

The pizzas and pastas are good. The mozerela  - cheese - they use are said to be their own recipe. Alcohol - beer specially - prices are a bit on the higher side. But a good dinning experience overall. And yes, authentic Italian cuisine! expect to shell out at least Rs 1k for a dinner for two (mocktail and beer included).

Being a vegetarian i get ample choice and feel proud to take my guest to Fire & Ice. I have lived and studied in Spain and Italy for almost two years and i get lots of guest from Europe. For me this is a good place to get my European friends. To be honest each of them love this place and the food. 

My suggestion is that, one should visit once, i am sure you will be regular....

Fire and Ice was my go-to place last year for a special reason. You see, they have a little secret menu not known to those who do not frequent and are not old customer. They make these things on request. One such is the Farcita, slices of cold tomatoes and thick cut mozzarella sandwiched between piping hot bread, straight from the oven, and then liberally doused with olive oil and Italian seasoning. I am generally a raw-tomato hater, but I absolutely love this, and my best friend can probably polish an entire plate off herself. I am also a fan of their lasagna, as well as their wild mushroom soup, both are good, to say the very least. 

Personally, I feel that their pepperoni pizza should have more pepperoni on it, but I like the pizza base, so crisp and tasty, and another favorite is the panini with ham in it, as a light lunch with a cup of coffee. 

One other thing that I would recommend here is the chocolate mousse. I like it. Its light but very intensely flavored, served with a small quenelle of ice cream on top, and I like the essential richness versus the light ice cream top. 

Among the drinks, the only one I actively would recommend is the Long Island Iced Tea. Hands down, the best in town. I have tried all other, but this one provides the balance the best, and ends up making it boozy and tasty at the same time, and one is enough to make me giggly. 

However, I actively dislike several things on the menu, which i deem tasteless. For example, the pesto pasta, which, for some reason, is always overly salty, and never well-made. Have tried it twice and disappointed both times. Also, the frutti di mare has tough seafood, so no, I am not going to endorse it to anyone. Service is nice, if a little slow, so I will cut points there too.

Fire and Ice. My blue food place, my low place, my safe haven and many more such words are what I often use to describe this quaint pizzeria on Park Street. Hated by some for its plain food, I love the joint. It's overtly expensive for a daily meal but a lovely indulgence when you're low. 

I have sampled most of the vegetarian food there. My favourites are as follows:
Funghi pizza with a lemon iced tea - I think that's sets my mood right no matter what
Pesto spaghetti or penne with vodka martinis. The bar tender makes it just right
Aglio olio and the Arrabbiata are also good choices for those who like it slightly spicy
But the pizzas there are to die for. The thin crisp 12 inchers with the slight smell of burnt dough is a treat at any time of the day. Next in line would be the garlic bread when you are not in the mood for pizza. The garlic bread with cheese serves as a good replacement for a plain margherita.

To end the meal one must certainly try their chocolate mousse. Its distinct form and taste beats any of its kind in the city. 

Once the meal is done and you still want to hang around listening to the 70's music or work or read on their large comfortable tables you could order a coffee, tea or hot chocolate. Beverages, though expensive by Calcutta standards, are blended to perfection. The tea is never too sour, or the coffee never too bitter, or hot chocolate never too sweet - it's always just right.

What keeps me going back there is the service and the black and white posters of yesteryear's Bollywood and Hollywood actors. I get terrible service when I'm with people but excellent service when I'm alone. I've never had to wait at the restaurant irrespective of the rush. A place at the bar is always reserved for me and my guest even if the tables are full. And yes, I get my pizza there at the bar itself.

What I like best about the place is the big steel oven where the pizzas are baked and the maroon painted ac ducts in stark contrast. Mixed with these two colours are madhubani paintings as a paneling running right across the areas and black and white posters. Colours and styles run a riot there and yet the place has its own distinct character...I guess somewhere it reflects who I am, all over the place and yet look one.

For many years, Fire and Ice enjoyed the status of being one of the few restaurants in the city that served "authentic" Italian food. Sadly, over the last few years, the quality of the food has gone down badly while prices have gone up, making this restaurant a bad place to visit.

On the credit side, they still make decent pizzas, and the thin crust used as a base is good. Unfortunately, these go unappreciated in a city where most people use Domino's and Pizza Hut as benchmarks for pizza, and Fire and Ice probably caters to that demand by providing condiments like ketchup along with their pizza - a travesty. The other item I liked was the Lasagna, which appeared well made.

However, almost everything else served by this restaurant is bad. Their antipasti have miserly amounts of cheese, fish, meat or vegetables in them, depending on the kind of dish ordered. A particular horror is the tuna salad, which is made from tinned tuna and liberally doused in vinegar to hide the taste of the brine. Naturally, the salad tastes so incredibly sour that it cannot be eaten.

Pasta dishes that are supposed to contain cheese do not have much cheese in them, in particular if the cheese in question is parmesan. The quantities in each dish have steadily reduced over time. The wines are priced so high that it would be impossible to order them, and the practice of serving by the bottle means that it would be difficult for one customer or a couple to finish it.

The desserts are probably the worst items on the menu. The tiramisu tastes like the stale pastry found in a neighbourhood grocery, and the profiteroles are floury shells in insipid cream.

In short, a place that does not deserve to be visited, as it would put you out of temper and pocket.

Hands down the best Italian restaurant in Kolkata, not just in terms of food, but also ambience, value for money, and service.

When it comes to Italian restaurants, the pizzas HAVE to be good, and Fire n Ice comes up trumps. In fact, I prefer Fire n Ice pizzas over any pizza I've had even in Mumbai or Delhi. The sauce and dough just make for a satisfying meal. 

Pastas are top quality too, with the Penne in Arrabbiata sauce being my favourite. Their Pasta is a Pesto sauce is really good as well, and is creamy without being overly heavy. This was the first restaurant where I tried Spaghetti Aglio Olio, and it's still the best I've had. For vegetarians, do try the veg lasagne, which is a knock out! 

You must also go for their "Basket of Focaccia" whether it's plain or garlic. Their fresh bread is a treat for any bread lover! Do try to visit early on weekends, because the place is packed!

The food is delicious, and it's proven by the high frequency of  local celebrities visiting this restaurant quite often. Have your reservation in place for weekends, I'd suggest. 
The service is also brilliant and the ambience actually helps you fell good.
Talking about the price, yes it's a bit high but then again, it's all worth it.

If it's Italian in Kolkata, it's gotta be Fire and Ice.

Went to this eatery for the first time yesterday after having heard a lot about it from people. We started off with 'Rondelle di Patate Fritte' which sounded so good but tasted awfully bad. It was potato chips at its worst.

Next we ordered Penne Arrabiata which was undercooked. In the pizza section we ordered a Margherita which was okay and a 'Pizza Alle Verdure Miste' which was good except the broccoli which someho didnt go with the flavours. The saving grace was the Fresh Mint Cooler which was fantastic. 

It was extremely crowded when we went in and we had to wait for 20 mins. Dont know if the big crowd was responsible for the taste of the food but I wasnt very satisfied. Plus it was very noisy in there.

2.5 stars fro me..

one of my fav restaurants in cal where I can go anytime wearing whatever I want. I like the no music but the buzzing chatter noise of this casual laid back relaxed place. This is fast italian like fast foid mcdonalds style  plus more in the form of super efficient quick service. smart servers smart alcohol drinks good pizzas pastas. nice to catch up with anyone here. Eat and talk fast and enjoy a good meal. Biggest con is that no vallet parking is provided which makes it a nightmare during peak traffick hours.

This is just another joint where Yuppy Calcuttans likes to hang around; offers basic service standard and food options usually found in Park Street food meccas. 

Folks I think "authentic" is an over used term and rarely conveys reality. Trust me this isn't "authentic" Italian, though food isn't that bad and its worth the occasional visit. 

Lets take a step back and look at something bit different - IndianChinese cuisine - this was first developed in the Chinatowns of Calcutta, about a century ago. Most Calcutta Chinese were immigrants from Guangdong and Fujian provinces. They found that Hakka was too bland so started adding Indian spices with a traditional Chinese name and so was born IndianChinese. Guess Annamaria Forgione tried the same formula. She initially started a pizzeria in Nepal and then opened up this place to Calcuttan's, hoping to cater to a much needed foreign cuisine outside the perimeter of a five star property.

Annamaria's culinary stopover in the heart of Calcutta at this joint is an attempt where traditional Italian flavors (basic) are revitalized to enhance the food experience with some irresistible Calcutta fusion cuisine. This is business, you give what people wants, that's how you run it and make money. 

For most of us the Italian cuisine is restricted to the few dishes that have managed to gain world wide acclaim, namely Neapolitan styled spaghetti and pizza. We tend to assume that traditional Italian cuisine is all pretty much alike. The truth however is Italian cuisine in its entirety is extremely diverse, rich and varied. The peasant heritage, climatic differences spread across its geographic region gives you the rich culinary heritage of Italian cuisine. The Greeks, Romans, Turks and the Arabs have all had a great influence on Italian cuisine. 

So if you are looking for gorgonzola gnocchi, Osso and  Bucco w pappardelle, Rabbit cacciatore, Caciocavallo, Peconrino Marzotica or Mascarpone cheese, Fettuccine rigatoni with boscaiola sauce, may be some Riso from Lombardia region or perhaps you are in the mood for Bucatini all'Amatriciana - this place may disappoint you. This is nothing close to being "authentic" - some form of Italian - yes !

If you are out to have fun, eat half decent food and be be able to tell your friends you had Italian food - this is your place. 

Couple of pointers - they have steadily and cleverly increased the food prices, expect to shell out a pretty penny, post 7:30/8 they fill up real quick so make a booking, service is basic so have a moderate expectation, don't order Lasagna - they don't know how to make it :(  Washroom is real lousy and it mostly stinks

Oh they give free WiFi I believe, if it still works.  

Cheers.

Rarely have I been so disappointed with a restaurant after having heard so much about it. Clearly it caters to the kind of client√®le that is in love with the thought of having a taste in Italian food, and paying good money for it - but has neither  been to Italy, nor is interested in finding out how authentic Italian should taste.
To start with, we tried to order La Marinara, the pizza with anchovies. The waiter kept trying to dissuade us, by repeated warnings that this pizza would be very salty. Of course, we knew anchovies are meant to be salty, thank you very much - so, not heeding these warnings we went ahead anyway. But when the pizza did arrive, the anchovies were of small amount and poorly distributed. There was nothing to balance the salt of the fish, and the supposedly "thin crust" was actually brittle - more biscuit than crust at all!
But then, this pizza was still the saving grace. To give credit where it is due, Fire and Ice did have anchovies in store. This is more than can be said about most restaurants anywhere in Kolkata. The other order in our meal was Polenta - and this was an unmitigated disaster.
The menu says that Polenta should be made from coarsely ground corn. The dish contained just a very fine corn dust (or cornmeal). Added to this, the creaminess came from too much white sauce and very little cheese, and the proportion of salt was totally miserly. I do not know what is it about these fancy "Italian" restaurants in Kolkata that they think Italians are allergic to salt!
It is a sad commentary on the state of World Cuisine in Kolkata that restaurants like the Fire and Ice are unleashed on its people and still find takers. Forget about world standards, these do not even match up to the standards of standalone restaurants in other cities of the sub-continent. You can get seriously better pizza in Kathmandu. A couple of places I went to in Kolkata recently have strengthened this feeling of mine (another being The Steak Factory). Wake up restaurateurs - Kolkata deserves better!

Loved the place and the atmosphere. Their vegetarian risotto with artichokes and their pizzas were exactly what I was missing after coming back from living overseas. The arrabiata, though, was a disaster. The service too was lacking....took them way too long to serve water. The olive oil they had on the tables was kinda disgusting. This, however, still is a great pizzeria to have a casual evening out. Went with family, will definitely go back with friends. 4 stars purely for atmosphere and their pizzas.

This is one place eternally full everyday of the week that says a lot about the popularity....a surprise discovery few years ago and numerous visits since then this place has time in time again has been consistent by delivering quality food everytime.. I even remember that we used as regular as twice a week visitors.. Our favorites are Fritte ( Italian style potato chips) with pesto and salsa dip...Anti pasti nonveg platter... If you are small eater these two itself will suffice your appetite.. But if in a group of Four or more proceed for the Pizza( two ppl can easily share one) in Pizzas our fav are Fire of Bengal with chilli and coriander sprinkle on minced lamb topping... A super innovation considering Bongs love their Non veg another favourite is Paesana toppings of. Bacon spinach and riccotta.. You have the choice of going half and half pizza of any toppings etc... pastas are good but not exactly great... But still better than the typical cheesy options available in the rest of the city.. Pasta with garlic prawns or grilled chicken is yummy..
The desserts are limited ( after eating so much food hardly any place left) but still their chocolate mousse is divine ..and even the variety of crepes... 
Overall charming staff  great food ambience and vibe!! That makes us come back again again and again...  Some times best things in life are served simply..

My favourite Italian in Kolkata ! I start out with the Lemon Iced Tea ... which is a wonderful palette cleanser , then onto the mains with perhaps one of the best thin crust pizzas in the city .... followed up by their pasta ( my personal favourite is the Bolognese or Carbonara ) and to finish off the chocolate mousse or the lemon meringue pie !!!! Heavenly !!!!

Fire And Ice.. Amazing place to go with preferably your friends but can also go with family for Authentic Italian Food.. It is one of the best Italian restaurants in Calcutta according to me.. Much Much better than what you get at Pizza Hut.. actually it is no comparison. Everything is great especially the Pizzas.
They recently introduced a Happy Hours kind of a thing which is a steal for college goers at less than 200 you get pizza and a cocktail colada :D ;)
Four stars from me :)

A very nice place for having pizzas. The actual taste  of italian food we can get here. Something named "Fungi Pizza" i ate with spaghetti. The ambience is also pleasant and i liked the way of serving the spaghetti. A best place till now where i had pizza. Their pricing is reasonable but the pizzas are nummy. It is obviously better than dominos and pizza hut. A nice place.

Fire N Ice quite deservedly occupy among the top spots when it comes to Italian dining out in Kolkata. The location is good, right in the hub of the heart of the city. The restaurant is cozy, not too crowded, with the ambience reflecting a lazy Sunday afternoon.

The food is good. Really good. Try out their lasagne and pasta. They have a very nice collection of wines as well.

I have not really been to this restaurant many times, I have probably been just thrice. My experience has always been good. The thin crust pizzas, lasagna, and pastas are well made with a perfect Italian flavouring. The restaurant has a very apt ambiance for the food, kept simple yet interesting. It is an up-market restaurant yet worth its value.

Have been to this place several times and I still don't get tired of it :) Love the Rondelle di Patate Fritte starter and even though Parigina is my favorite pizza, all others are worth a try. The crepes with nutella are to die for. 

Initially the place used to be quite, but off late it has become noisy and on weekends its packed. 
Service is nice and the staff is courteous. Never had any complaints from this restaurant and they are doing a splendid job. The ambiance is warm and friendly.
I, personally, find it better than Spaghetti Kitchen.

It is sad when a good restaurant slowly starts disappointing till you no longer feel like visiting it. I have been a regular patron of this once quaint little eatery from 2008 till about 2012. What they were known for were these thin crusted Neapolitan pizzas loaded with stringy cheese and a generous amount of topping be it ham pepperoni or a variety of other offerings. It was therefore a rude shock for me when I visited it in 2012 to find that not only have the toppings been lessened to a half of what the restaurant would formerly use but there was hardly any cheese and tomato base. I was so disappointed that from being a regular patron who visited the place once or even twice per month I completely stopped visiting this place till I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and I must say I am extremely disappointed. I wanted a fresh caprese salad and specifically asked our server whether the mozzarella was fresh.¬†

What I was served was fresh tomatoes with a cheese which was rubbery, tasteless and hard. I was sorely disappointed. For the first few bites I was in shock and then requested my friend to take a bite and she decided that her palate said it was somewhere between cottage cheese and something else.¬†

I wanted to bring this to the manager's notice but the staff was having a meeting while patrons were waiting for them to serve their customers and so I left paying an amount which gave me 0 value for money. It was like a slap on my face.¬†

What saved the day was the Affogato , the ice-cream was soft and delicious and the strong coffee complemented it perfectly.¬†

The decor which once had these beautiful wooden chairs is replaced by these steel chairs which take away the charm and beauty of the restaurant.¬†

I am very sad that a once lovely restaurant has turned into one of the worst restaurants in town.

I have been here twice - once on a friends job treat and once on a date. The first time I had their Vegetable Lasagna because I was intent on trying the dish ever since a friend of mine said all good things about it after returning from a trip to Texas. The dish was much much better than I had ever expected it to be. But the price seemed a bit high, since we were students at that time. The next time it was even better, we had Lasagna and alcohol and the total bill came to around 800 for 2.
Nice place over all and highly recommended.

I love fire and ice
It has an old world decor with exposed brickwork and black and white photos, which gives it a mysterious touch. Since I frequent it so often, as often as once a week, I get the best service and I have never come back unsatisfied. My favorites are the Margherita and La Regina Pizzas. I really love the veg antipasto misto and the rondelle potato chips for starters. Since i dont drink alcohol there is a bevy of mocktails to choose from. The best drink to be invented in the world was the mojito and fire and ice makes a killer virgin mojito ( mojito pronounced "MO-HEE-TO". I hate it when people mis-pronounce words). Very few places do justice to Pesto preparations, Fire and Ice has the most amazing pesto  penne pasta. I for one can eat the entire desert menu as everything is fabulous. Especially the chocolate mousse, frutta and crepe filled with nutela or sugar and lemon. Fire and Ice also has wi-fi service and the coffee is great. Italians traveling through Kolkata will flip for the food. The downside of Fire and Ice is the amount of noise the customers who eat there make. Foreigners who frequent Kolkata should be aware of two of kolkata's specialties: one,nobody minds their own  business and stare rudely and secondly, no conversation is complete without yelling. The prices are slightly over the roof for the without alcohol party but I for one, will go to fire and ice even if 20 years down the line the pizza will cost me INR 10000. The only other place to go for Italian is La Cucina in Hyatt Regency, but that again is for special occasions because spending 3000 per head is steep even for the moneyed class, because obviously they dont want to drain their hard earned cash. So enjoy fire and ice and please get back to me with what you thought of my recommendations! thanks for reading!

Food is average at best, nothing earth shattering and the service is not very consistent, the restaurant has a nice decor which oozes a retro feel, the place is usually full which means its a bit on the noisy side, this highlights the fact that this aint aimed at any fine dining discerning customer but more gives of more of a relaxed feeling where you don't need to be at your best.

Try their Penne Arrabiatta, Pasqualina Salad and Choc pudding desert. It will be one of your best meals in India.
