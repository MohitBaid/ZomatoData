Awesome food .. my go to Cafe at jadavpur ! Serves good food at reasonable price. This place never fails to impress me and I have tried almost everything in their menu. The place might be small but the sandwiches and wraps you get here will fill your heart with joy. I am a fan of their seek kebab wraps and egg mayo wraps. Chicken wings and drumsticks taste delicious! Brownie with ice cream is the perfect desert for every mood! Cold coffee with ice cream and pineapple float is a must try.

London Lounge: is a very small place located near 8b bus stand. The motto of this restro is to make foods with lesser amount of oil. Ordered chicken pizza which was ok in taste and there was walnut brownie this thing was quiet good..
Though I appreciate there good attempt to go for oil frees but I am sure they will surely upgrade the taste.

I ordered sandwiches and bbq chicken wings from here and was utterly disappointed. The breads are stale and the contents of the sandwiches were not fresh either. They smelt bad too. The chicken wings were also stale and tasted disgusting. The entire experience was rotten and everything was total waste of my money.

Ordered brownies from London Lounge through Swiggy. It was mentioned that brownies were one of the more popular items,  however after tasting it, I'm sorry to say that I'm quite disappointed with the item. The brownies were very dry and lacked taste/ flavour. One could also taste bits of sugar while having the brownies (maybe that's how you prepare it there). Spending 69 Bucks for the brownies is definitely not worth it (due to the taste). The plus point is the size of brownies is quite big ( two people can share it) .Instead a better suggestion would be to reduce the size and improve the flavour.

It's a small little store beside the HDFC ATM at 8b. Easy to miss unless you're looking for it. I was meeting a friend and this teeny weeny "lounge" seemed a fit.

The decor is simple, bamboo tables and seats placed at the inner corner, and plastic tables and chairs lined the wall.

They have a fair few items to offer: sandwiches are quite popular. You can also sample chicken pakora, chops etc. And then there are fruit based drinks.

The 2 points which didn't sit very well with me:

The lack of proper ventilation. The air conditioner  wasn't working well and the heat was quite bothersome.

The food is average, really. Nothing fancy. But they do come with fancy names.

Overall: pocket friendly. Good for a quick grub on the way from University.

This place is situated near 8B bus stand, a 2 mins walk from there towards sulekha. We had initially ordered food packets from here for a college fest. Their sandwich is average. It had cucumber onion slices along with chicken. The choco chip muffin was quite good. The normal muffin was nice too. The brownie cake was average. 
Later however I had gone to try their brownie with ice cream. Priced at ₹85 it was delicious. It was a bit solid though, not like brownies in other restaurants. Chocolate sauce wasn't given adequately it seemed. At that price it was okay but it can be improved. It's a small place. There are little chairs and tables around 4. Ambience is average. Service is quick. GST isn't charged. Yet to try the wraps.

Its a real small outlet near Jadavpur 8b bus stop beside HDFC atm, can be a little hard to locate.  
The interior is good for a small wee cafe.
If you are feeling like having a smack its quite a place to visit.  I was with a friend of mine one evening and felt hungry on my way back home.  Had a Desi Spicy mayo chicken grilled sandwich and A pineapple drink with vanilla ice cream on it.  Sandwich was okayish and you have nothing to complain about.  The drink was really good as we were really thirsty the fruity,  tangy and as well as perfectly sweetened drink gave us relief.  The service was prompt. Overall a good visit with affordable pocket pinch

London Lounge is a small and well decorated cafe. At   the heart of Jadavpur (Opp. of KPC clg and just beside of HDFC atm) this place is really good for chit-chat with little bit of snacks or sandwitches. Small group of people (max. 4 to 6 in a group) can really pass their quality time here.

Foods are good. Mocktails are also very good. But if you go there you must check their various sandwitches. Those are really awesome. You can try their brownie as well. Rates are reasonable and pocket friendly. 

Staffs are very polite and well behaved. One thing the room temperature. They should work on this. Though there is an AC but still I felt quite hot there. Otherewise everything i like there.

Today was my third visit to this place. What I love about London Lounge is it's easy accessibility from my university making it a go-to place whenever hunger pangs hit me in campus. It is located bang opposite KPC medical college, adjacent to Bank of Baroda.
I love their wide array of sandwiches, which are real value for money. Today, my partner and I ordered a fresh lime soda, a cheese and chicken burger, a Croque-Monsieur which is a pork ham, cheese and tomato sandwich and warm brownie topped with vanilla ice-cream and chocolate sauce.
The burger was pretty basic, the flavour was good but it could have been bigger. The sandwich was amazing. The ham was seasoned perfectly with freshly ground pepper and the freshness of the tomato created wonders in my palate. The brownie with ice cream is cheaper than any variant of this dessert I have had elsewhere and tasted pretty good. The fresh lime soda was more salty than sweet and I did not really taste the soda, it just felt like good ol' nimbu paani.
I would recommend people to stick to ordering the sandwiches here. Believe me, you won't be disappointed.
Also, it would be nice if they stopped serving food on shiny paper plates, I am sure this place can afford crockery, even if plastic ones as they charge taxes from customers.
All in all, a nice place for sudden dates or adda over steaming cups (albeit paper ones :p ) of tea and coffee and delicious sandwiches and muffins.

Ordered few heavy stuffs for breakfast from these place.Me along with my friend ordered jumbo egg chicken burger, grilled chicken tikka wrap and grilled chicken satay and pepper sandwich.The ratings and taste are below:-
1.Jumbo egg chicken Burger-4/5 (The bun was fresh  and crispy, but I personally the chicken patty a bit salty).
2.Chicken tikka wrap-5/5 (The wrap was soft and with the  creamy chicken tikka inside made our day).
3.Grilled chicken satay and pepper sandwich-4.5/5 (Bread was grilled to perfection and I also liked the fact that they put peanut butter with the fillings).
 Overall we had a quite filling breakfast by slightly pincing our pockets.

Not spacious. Some food items are over priced in compared to their quantity n taste. I had chicken 65 which was very small in size n quality. I bought custard( Rps-49/- each) which had smell of raw egg in it. The taste was very ordinary. We can make better custards in our home. The apple pie is so so in taste. 

Over all it was not at all a nice experience for me. 
Food=2.5(whatever I tasted=chicken 65,grilled sandwich, Apple pie, coffee, tea,)

London Lounge is an example that how  well my home place jadavpur is coming to the top regarding the best zone for foodies....By far the best adda zone jadavpur has ever seen...if college Street has coffee house then jadavpur can well compete with that because of London Lounge...the food items are heavenly mouth watering and delicious...The behaviour of the staffs ads an extra aura to the place...Very quick with their service ....i have tried most of the items..special recommendations lke ham and cheese sandwich...the oil free wraps are excellent that will not add anything extra to your adipose tissue....Apple pie is a must have...And with all these try their cocktails....So just go and enjoy to the fullest...

Don't mind going here for a quick bite. Small place with cute little tables and stools and graffiti on the walls. Do try their freshly made sandwiches. You get an option to suggest any alteration in any sandwich. Good service and friendly staff. This place also offers desserts like apple pie, pastries and even cupcakes.

I visited London Lounge in numerous occasions. Initially it was a very small eating joint but after some space arrangements, it seems a bit more spacious. However the food is cheap and they have variety. On a daily basis, they put up on display various combo meals, most of the time within 160 to 190 Rupees, sometimes even less than that and I find them pretty impressive. I normally opt for a combo, which comes with chicken sandwiches, a coldrink and a pastry. But foods are served in paper plates and plastic cups which reduces the beauty of the presentation. But overall food is good, if not something to die for. And their pastries are really worth trying.

I have tried the Russian potato sandwich which was pretty nice. The lime soda is nothing special although they charge around 25-30 for it. The confectionery is also okay , nothing great about taste though.  All in all cool place , young ambience, great to hangout with friends often.  😊

They told me to have thier tangri kebab and chicken sandwich. 

Place was not clean, that chicken leg as not properly cooked and dont know how old it is. Too much spices on it. Tge sandwich was tasteless and had no mayonnaise.

Yesterday me and my friend decided to had some snacks in the evening at London Lounge. It is near Jadavpur 8B bus stand. First when we saw from outside it was full. We waited for sometimes then we had two seats. The place was very small in space. The seating arrangment was not good at all. It was too adjacent. When we placed the order one of the staff moved our bags to a different chair without asking for it and gave our seat to another person. This was really very offensive activity. But we stay clam and placed our order without any argument.Now came to the food part. We ordered
one shredded chicken sandwich 
one chicken sausage and chess sandwich,
chicken wings, 
cold coffee and 
virgin kiwi margarita.

The sandwiches were good in taste and also fresh. The wings was ok. I didnt like the kiwi mocktail. But my friend liked that. I enjoyed the cold coffee. The total bill was 353. I wish the place had more space so that everyone will get some privacy to enjoy the food and ambience much better.

London lounge is a small food junction near jadavpur 8b bus stand.
Prices are pocket friendly and food is fresh and good.
Have been here several times since it is located just opposite to our college.
Today I went here after a couple of months to find it all newly painted and look cooler.
We took a chicken pizza cold drinks combo.
•Pizza-The pizza was made on pizza bread,with olives and good amount of shredded chicken.The sauce used in it was very tasty.
•Chilli sausage wrap-The oil free chili sausage wrap,it was well cooked and very yummy.
But they can be more generous with sausage pieces.

We went here again and availed another combo of chicken mayo sandwich+Sausage wrap+One kiwi mocktail.
•Sandwich-Two pieces of grilled chicken sandwich with good amount of chips is recommended.
Also,the sausage wrap today had good quantity of sausages in it.
Apart from this,I had a chocolate muffin which was soft and fresh.

In our previous visits,we had their burgers,caramel pudding and brownie with ice cream.

Food is nice here.Service is prompt.
Pocket friendly cafe.

An extremely narrow place converted to cafe.
Caramelized pudding and apple pie cake are worth trying.
Fast service.
Pocket friendly too.
Nice place ..atleast go for the pudding for once

Food is good.
Service is good.
Ambience is also good,
And it's good on your pockets also.

Was a regular here when I was at Jadavpur.

Must have is the chicken drumstick.
Didn't like the desserts much. And best part is it's very good for conversations over a coffee and some evening snack.

I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into this little known cozy nook and found it's casual fervour really charming.Its a great place for your casual addas over the excellent mocktails that this place offers.Their cocktails and coffees are really fabulous.Variations of the grilled sandwich served here should definitely be on your must try list.The brownies however are not upto the mark.The prices are pretty decent and makes this place an affordable cafe cum adda zone.On the whole, a great place to try out for meet and great and stopovers.

A little place in Jadavpur near 8B bus stand...The food here is great! A nice place for "adda"....But it is not at all spacious...If it is full it may turn out to be a bit claustrophobic...Overall the food is good and price is decent...and the service was really good...Worth a try! :)

👍 affordable, tasty and fresh, well behaved.
👎 Not a big lounge though.

My evening at this place went pretty nice as the ambience is so friendly. Even when overcrowded, it has a charm of "adda", a warm service was given to all by the staff. We tried their CREAMY AMERICAN CORN N CORN SANDWICH, CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD, CHOCOLATE WALNUT BROWNIE with CAPPUCCINO and HERBAL TEA. We also tried GONDHORAJ CHICKEN CHEESE SANDWICH from their on board menu.
I must say, the twist of our very own Gondhoraj did it's magic and pushed a normal chicken cheese s/w to a new level. A thumbs up 👍 to this thought. We actually liked all of their dishes. simple, homely, tasty and economical. To my thought this is the place one would like to hangout with friends regularly without a hastle of money. 😄

If you want a vibe of London in Kolkata, you could wait for a couple of years from now or check in to this small cafe and snacks outlet in Jadavpur, near the 8B bus stand. The outlet is small and seats 20, but they serve one of the best grilled sandwiches.

You may feel a bit awkward to sit in very small stools and eat off an even smaller table, but that is the whole idea I suppose. The graffiti on the four walls will take you to London in a jiffy. I had the Italian Basil Pesto Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Oilfree Caesar Chicken Wrap. The former was delicious with the perfect taste of basil. It was served as two triangular pieces with sauce and potato chips. The latter however was even better with mayo, cheese, salad inside the wrap. Both of them were equally filling.

I ordered Virgin Kiwi Margarita and Green Apple drink which were simple but otherwise good. Both of them had their unique taste and light fizz. I ordered Cream Caramel to finish it off. It was delicious, exactly how it should be like, with the cream melting in my mouth within minutes.

The price is moderately high, but no added taxes, so wouldn't be too much on your pocket. Overall it was a nice experience. The service is prompt. Food was served in paper plates and drinks in plastic glasses. It is a nice place to sit and chat for long hours, but might get stuffy with a lot of people inside. Rating it 4.5/5 considering similar outlets.

I'm absolutely in love with this place because of the grilled sandwiches they offer. The creamy American Corn and Chicken, the grilled ham and chicken grilled sandwiches are delicious. As for the wraps, they are oil-free yet so soft and creamy. I'd swear by the caesar chicken wrap. The staff is really cooperative and make you feel comfortable without making you wait for long. A great pocket-friendly place to hang out with friends!

The review is based on the desserts that my mother got from this place for us. We had a hand bill providing which we got to avail a 10% discount. Now coming to the food items-

Pure Chocolate Pastry - Simply loved. The chocolate layer was thick, apt for my sweet tooth. Looked good too.

Choco-Walnut Brownie - Superb. Too good. 

Apple Pie - Looked good, something different, less sweet, okayish.

Cream Caramel - Good presentation, less sweet, did not like the taste.

Choco-chip Muffin - Mediocre. 

Hope the place adds more desserts. 😊

Food is quite good as well as reasonably priced. We had sandwich combos & frappucino topped with Vanilla ice cream. The caramel custard was a bit too sweet for my taste buds.  Overall a cosy little place to hangout with friends for a little adda & quick bite.
P.S- Tall people may find it a bit difficult to fit into one of those super small stools (they are cute though).

We have tried Chicken leg piece, it's amazingly tasty and mouthwatering. Apple pie is their one of the biggest lipsmacking item, it's delicious, delectable, delightful.Eagerly want to try their other items.Place is small but ambience is pleasant. Staffs are well mannered. Overall it's an enjoyable experience.

Tried their turkey (I personally didn't like it much, as the frozen turkey meat was hard to chew) anyway, we also tried bar-b-que wings, drum stick, a sandwich (I forgot the particular name), chicken chat (just another name of chicken shawarma salad with a different touch) and a kiwi mocktail. Wanted to write a review on their wall too but forgot again. Oh god!! Help me to remember some things at least

The kind of quantity they provide is good to feed birds and not human being...been here twice took chicken Caesar salad which is below average in quality and quantity is one-third of the quantity you get in any other restaurant...on my second visit I took chicken wings...they mentioned chicken wings on the menu and all they serve was a tiny (real tiny) piece of chicken which is an entire plate...their coffee and tea is horrible and any roadside tea shop can serve way better!! Avoid this place and don't even consider it as your last option!!

Today i decided to order some evening snacks due to the unavailability of cash purchase in nearby outlets, so i ordered via swiggy.

I had the following:-

1. Chickbites 65- Another name for chicken shashlik. Consists of 5 chicken pcs(small) marinated in tikka masala & had the perfect meaty texture and bite to it. Although the pricing seemed a bit steep.

2. Crispy Mexican Chicken Burger- Medium sized burger with cheese,jalapenos,olives,chicken patty in spicy flavours,onions & chips. The burger was super tasty & jalapenos gave a superb taste to each biteful but my only complain would be the non-crunchy of the patty. It was a bit overdone so it didn't have the perfect crunch to my liking. But overall i was satisfied with the item.

The dish that I love the most is their Chicken Vol-au-Vent, not just because of its taste but also because of the pricing. It costs just Rs. 20 and it is complete value for money, if not more. Their Roasted Chicken Oil-Free wrap is also nice; so are most of the sandwiches that they offer... Fantastic food-joint in this part of the city

Near 8b bus stand , this place has been newly opened .. noticed it quite several times but did not visit. Today thought that why not giving it a try.. the place is very small, very much cozy.. do not go if  you are thinking of having a good time with perfect atmosphere.. its jst a small area with some chairs kept very closely.. food is average.. prices are low.. in terms of quantity the price is ok. I would not say its very cheap. We had vegetable sandwich worth rs 75 nd a cold coffee fr 50. Now the amount of coffee was very little.. so price is ok.. not so cheap. Nd the thing that i did not like was the ambience.. it was hot inside even during afternoon. The fan was not working.. they had their air condition on. But it was not making the room cool.. i personally did not enjoy the whole experience.  Because the food is average. You would apparently feel that price is low.. but after looking at the quantity you will change your decision, nd overall i did not like the service. If you are hungry and want some food immidiately with sitting arrangements then you may give it a try.

Food we had was cheese and corn sandwich,bbq chicken wings and cream caramel.Sandwich was good..it was served with potato chips.Bbq chicken wings didn't have a tinge of the sweet and smoky bbq sauce.It was very average in taste.Best of the lot was the cream caramel.It had the perfect balance of sweetness and was super smooth and creamy.Loved it!

Looking for a cafe for chit chat in and around jadavpur? Hop into London Lounge the quaint little outlet selling everything from mocktails to snacks to pastries. Located right on the heart of Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick Road in Jadavpur, it records a good number of footfalls each day. Try out their chicken drumsticks and grilled wings that get sold like hot cakes. The pastries are pretty good and so are the sandwiches. You get value meals as well. However, the mocktails will disappoint you. Other than that you can be sure to have a happy tummy!

Do not judge this food joint by it's looks as it appears from the main road. It is actually very misleading for this particular restaurant. Located near the 8B bus stand it often goes unnoticed amongst the many shops and ATMs situated in that area. The outlet has a very narrow gate which might make people think that there might be a lack of room inside but it is actually not so. It has ample space and the place is extremely hygienic. 
Coming to the food, they have a few special items,value meals which you might not get in the menu. It is written there on a white board and I have added a picture of the same. We ordered samosa followed by a value meal consisting of roasted chicken sandwich+grilled sausage wrap+a mocktail and as a dessert we ordered brownie with hot chocolate & vanilla ice cream. The samosa was delicious as it had a crispy covering and the filling had a very spicy taste. Next came the value meal;the person serving was sensible enough to give 1 item at a time so that we can enjoy the warm food. First came the wrap;it was excellent as it was full of sausages,capsicum,mayonnaise. The filling was enough in quantity and infact it was overflowing,so much was the quantity. Then came the sandwich and this too was amazing. The chicken was properly roasted and the sandwich was perfectly grilled. The mocktail was a little turn-off as I have had better homemade mocktails. The final item was the brownie;it was served hot as per the name. The brownie when mixed with the ice cream topping and devoured gives a superb feeling. They give 2 scoops of ice cream on the brownie which might prove to be insufficient if not had wisely.
All the items except for the samosa were made right in front of us and hence there cannot be any question about how fresh are the items served. You order,they prepare and give it to you. This might take a little bit more time than usual but the wait is worth it.The prices of the items are slightly higher than other confectionery stores like Mio Amore or Kathleen but the quality and taste of the items served really justifies the little insignificant higher prices charged. A must try for all.

Well...this place was in my wish list for a looong time...finally I made it here today and I am glad I did so because missing out on such amazing a place would have been a great loss!First things first this isn't like other confectionery stores like mio amore Kathleen etc. It's like any regular cafe where u get a menu card and you choose from the options available.Few items are already prepared which is just warmed and served but most of the items are freshly prepared and served-so they aren't on display!Also icecream,iced tea,coffee and other beverages are available.
Ambience ---
As far as the ambience is concerned there is nothing much to it...few sitting arrangements are made with proper ventilation and it's AC so much of the comfort is already secured there. Extremely hygienic and has the minimum furnishing-nothing mentionable! There is a Bengali magazine placed on every table.
Food---
We tried:
Samosa (15 INR) :gigantic in size and the filling was superb extremely 'chatpata'! Worth a try!

Grilled sausage wrap: it had red yellow green bell peppers grilled chicken sausage and mayo!!was served with ketchup and very little quantity of chips.just loved it!!The quality of food is tremendous! I have tasted such wraps only at high end cafes that too at twice the price!!

Lichee mocktail:it's actually syrup and soda in the right proportions mixed together!Though there is nothing more to it yet I would again stress on the fact that it was not just a regular syrup-its from the brand Mala's which is one of the best! You know about it the minute you taste it!

Roasted chicken sandwich: It had shredded chicken and cucumber with a few add ons.This was good but nothing seemed to match up to the standards the wrap had set!again served with chips and ketchup it was grilled to perfection!
The wrap sandwich and mocktail were a combo offer for 175INR only!A must try!

Brownie with hot chocolate & vanilla ice cream---well this was the last and the best item we had today!two scoops of vanilla icecream in a heated brownie base with chocolate sauce- a combination that would melt everyone's heart!a spoonful of this heavenly mixture in the mouth and that's all you need to experience food Nirvana!! And the best part-this just comes for 75INR.I am sure the ones reading my review WILL try it! :)
You sure should!!!
Staff behavior---
Extremely well mannered and they help you out with your choices! But I would suggest insisting upon a bill as bill is given only when it is asked for!
Overall my take on London lounge will be that hygiene,food quality and even the price everything is at its best!!I would strongly recommend this place to everyone!

Visited once for a quick cup of coffee. Nothing fancy about this place. Run by one person and has limited sitting arrangements. The menu was interesting, and we ended up having coffee, veg-cheese grilled sandwich, roasted quail, and chocolate avalanche. To our surprise the food did compliment the taste buds. And the best part is, the entire menu is dirt cheap. Recommend for those who aren't looking for restaurant or cafe like environment, and are focusing only on having quality quick bites.

I ordered food from this place from an online ordering app. So in a nut shell I'm saying. I have no clue where this outlet is, or its decor.

Moving to the food. Firstly the food took a lot of time. I ordered grilled chicken with bbq sauce and roasted chicken wrap(oil free). Well, the grilled chicken had a poor quality of bbq sauce and was oily. The chicken was well marinated though. And the roasted chicken wrap tasted bad because again, a sauce problem. The sauce was smelly like uncooked soya sauce. The veggies(capsicum & onion) were fresh and the chicken was plain minced boiled chicken(tasteless).

I marked this place once while I was walking by the pavement. London Lounge actually sounded quite bizarre to me.

Soon, on a Friday, late eve, I decided to visit the place with a friend of mine.

They have nice variety and the food is tasty. We opted for sandwich combo & burger combo. Sandwich combo comprised of Chicken grilled sandwich+ pastry + cold drink & the other one was chicken burger and cold drink. Instead of pastry they had served us bread and butter pudding which tasted fabulous.

Though the sitting arrangement is not very comfortable but it's cute. Lol.

I might go back soon.

Enjoy the place👍🏻

I was there, was quite hungry.. wanted to grab a quick bite. Usually one goes to a Mio Amore or a Kathleen or similar confectionary outlets, London Lounge offers such an alternative with lil bit extra items like sandwiches and wraps and pie. But the style is same. Place to grab a quick bite.

Just about okay. Items are somewhat okay for the price. Apple pie is something u dont get in other places. 
Can be visited 1-2 times.

Portuguese style Stroganoff Chicken Sandwich and chocolate truffle pastry, were our choice of order for home delivery this afternoon. The food is decent and pleasing, but for a sandwich that costs over Rs. 100 for home delivery, I sure did expect more.

The name of the sandwich did set the expectations high for me, as I love stroganoff. Though the sandwich tastes good, I was expecting some more flavor out of it. The pastry was decent too.

Tucked away among an array of shops near the Jadavpur 8B bus stand is London lounge and one summer afternoon we decided to give it a shot and well it wasn't the best experience.
Firstly to start with, the staff aren't really the friendly sort which you'd come to expect which is outright disappointing.
Coming to the food, we ordered a cold coffee , chocolate pastry, an apple pie , grilled chicken sandwiches and soft drinks.
The chocolate pastry was stale and tasted sour as a result and to top it off they refused to acknowledge it to begin with.
The cold coffee was very ordinary and was served in a crumpled disposable plastic cup.
The apple pie was as hard as a brick and tasted bland.
The grilled chicken sandwich was better and was the only saving grace.
All in all, it left a bad taste in the mouth as well as the mind.
Service is on the faster side though and the rates are pocket friendly.
But definitely wouldn't recommend it.

London Lounge is a bijou yet unique joint. Located beside axis bank, this joint serves us with bakery items,wraps,sandwiches and so on. There are few seating arrangements. The staff is very helpful and the service being good. Took a chocolate truffle pastry,a black forest cake and a walnut brownie.

Chocolate truffle pastry- look wise elegant. The quality is very good. I loved it. 

Black forest pastry- i didnt like this as much as the brownie and chocolate truffle pastry. I found it a bit hard. It was not too sweet but i wont try it again.

Walnut brownie- i loved it. Yummy and tasty. It was too good. 

Overall the flavours were well balanced. I loved the bakery portions. On my next visit, i will definately try the sandwiches and wraps as well.

I have always been curious about this little shop near Jadavpur 8B bus stand. I wanted to visit it for a long time but somehow I could not. Finally, I got the chance today. I saw some combo offers being given here, so I went in. A narrow lane leads to wider area, where sweet and savoury items were kept in a large glass case. There were tools  here and there. There were four combo offers in total. I ordered grilled chicken sandwich, pastry and coke. The food took ten minutes to arrive. The sandwich was delicious. Grilled bread stuffed with shredded chicken, mayonnaise and veggies made it a truly delicious meal. The pastry was perfect. It was not too sweet, just the way I like it. Impressed by their food, I ordered chicken wings in barbeque sauce. This item was delicious as well. I loved the food. The staff was well behaved and helpful. And one thing, they should use proper cutlery instead of paper trays. I will visit this store again.

This small joint is situated just beside the HDFC Atm near Jadavpur bus stand.
The food is decent. We tried the grilled chicken sandwich combo that came with a pepsi and a chocolate pastry and the egg-mayo wrap. Both tasted alright. Special mention to the pastry which stood out among the rest. The prices here are pocket friendly as well.
The only let down is the cramp for space and the seating arrangement, which needs to be improved a bit.

I wasn't much satisfied as I expected this place to be on reading the reviews. This place is in a hidden corner located near Jadavpur 8B bus stand in between the HDFC and Axis Bank ATMs. We had been there for some snacks after a movie at Inox. The place is too small and congested unlike what it seemed to be in the pictures. Anyways, we got in and for a long time we could not manage a complete separate seating arrangement for ourselves.
Mango Flavoured Hot and Sweet Chicken Sandwich, Grilled Sausages with Kachumber Salsa, Black Forest Pastry, Black Forest Mousse and Caramel Pudding are things that we ordered. The sandwich was below average. There was not even a tinge of the flavour of mango, even the fillings was not that good. The sausages were usual. The dip was okay too. The pastry was hard and the balance of cream and cake was not subtle. But I liked the mousse very much. It was soft, creamy, totally delicious and perfectly yummy. Even the caramel pudding tasted super yumm. I liked the last two items pretty much although the starting was much a kind of disappointment. London Lounge is a kind of place not very common in the university area. Although very crowded, still I think places like this require a lot of improvement for that ultimate touch of finesse and perfection. Thank you. And of course, Happy Dining! :)

Small place with small entrance, hence easy to be missed. Interior is equally small with sitting arrangement for 8 to 10 people. The shop offerers various kind of sandwiches, burgers and wraps. I ordered a salami cheese sandwich that costs 109 INR. The food was freshly prepared but was served in cheap paper plate. The sandwich tasted good, so no complaint there. I had a look in between the breads to see the contents and was disheartened to see the amount of salami served for that price. The item shouldn't cost more than 70 INR. So, I would say food is good but definitely overpriced.

This one has aces all over it. Pocket friendly, decent variety, good combos, plus their pastries are better than the unholy triumvirate of mio amore, kathleen and sugar and spice(again, strictly my opinion). Its tucked in between two shops right on the main road and so much so that many people tend to miss it. The proprietor has invested a fair share of time adorning the walls with london posters and all things london which to me was crying out too hard to convince me this was indeed "london" lounge. Good food in itself is a best seller. Try the sanwiches, muffin and coffee combos. Sufficiently filling and reasonably priced makes their case even stronger. Oddly enough, i have never seen a crowd here. I wouldn't recommend donuts here as they are too too too sweet. Half a donut and suicidial tendencies tend to stream into your consciousness. You tend to realise why too much sugar is bad for you. The pies are good. Too bad they don't make shepherds pie. A job well done

Too tiny a place. The food options are also a few. Seating is cramped, and the tiny fans do not make things better. 
I liked my chocolate chip muffin, though admittedly I've had better. The chocolate mousse was also fair. With a plethora of better options available all around, I'd give this a miss.

Happen to chance upon this place one day while waiting for a friend. Have to say as a whole, the place is okayish really. The ambience, seats, alright. Menu looks good. I had ordered a chocolate doughnut n a cup of coffee. Doughnut was either stale, or overheated to the point where u have to tear it with your hands and feet almost. Not a very good experience with that. Coffee was OK, not very bad, n fine for the price. The menu is really diverse n quite pocket friendly. But food quality needs improvement. Although I would say it's still too early to judge. I'll like to visit once more, give it another chance n see.

Wanted to try out this place since quite a few days so ordered via food panda. I ordered for a chocolate truffle pastry, a butterscotch pastry and chicken vol-au-vent. Firstly they sent me a black forest pastry instead of butterscotch. I'm assuming they probably didn't have butterscotch pastry or they didn't read the order accurately. Secondly the chicken vol-au-vent was the size of a mini cookie containing only filo pastry with a little chicken and mayo as an icing on the top. However, the pastries were not bad. I would like to try their wraps some day. All the items
are quite reasonably priced.

Decent in all ways : food and seats and the price. I wasn't really expecting it to be good considering that it's a small shop along the 8B footpath.
I had cold coffee,caramel custard cream and butterscotch pastry the first time.
Caramel custard was actually very good,tasted great and it came for just 40!
Butterscotch pastry had this subtle taste which was nice,won't say it was very good or something.
Second time I went for the bread pudding which was again very nice and had a subtle sweet taste,not too much not too less,very impressive.And the chicken drumstick was soft and spicy as well.

Nice place for a quick bite,not for addas. Seating arrangement is comfortable considering the fact that the place is really small. Prices are very reasonable which is why serving in paper plates and plastic glasses is okay.
Basically a roadside cake and coffee shop providing you with seats and AC! And decent food.

With mostly good reviews from fellow foodies in Zomato, I was planning to visit this cafe from a long time. I already knew about the space crunch so it wasn't an issue for me. Having decided to try out their burger and the brownie, I ordered one chicken burger and coke first (combo offer for 72). 
[I asked the person making sandwiches about the combo offerings and he didn't even have the courtesy to respond at first time. The next time I asked, he pointed to a white-board without saying a word. Can't say I liked the behavior, but decided to ignore it as food was the main thing I went for.]

The service was quick. They served it on a paper plate with tomato ketchup. It looked decent, till the moment I took a bite. The chicken patty was absolutely burnt and so had a bitter taste. Plus, I expected a little bit more mayonese in the burger (not even demanding cheese). At times, it was really dry with a bitter taste - not at all a good experience to order something else.

For 2nd August I had ordered a 'Ben 10 ' - 5 pound cake worth Rs.1500 from this shop.The promises that was made during the time of order was awesome...but when I got the cake I felt like kicking the cake,because it doesn't matches even 1 % that was promised.If you consider the size it seems that i have ordered a 2 pd cake and the picture of Ben 10 was horrible.you have to write Ben 10 below it to identify that it was actually Ben 10.Most surprisingly my son's name was also missing in the cake...well can you people belief that ! I had to buy 2 cakes from Sugar n spice that day.Money is not the main issue but when u ordered something and you get something else in return you feel totally disappointed.

I have been eyeing this place for quite some time and recently had an opportunity to drop in and sample their sandwiches.
We ordered a grilled chicken tikka sandwich and a grilled chicken stroganoff sandwich. Both turned out to be decent in taste. They were grilled nicely and the chicken inside were good as well. But pulling both the sandwiches down were the sides that were not cut and the fact that there was not enough mayonese in them. Also a very meagre 4 chips a sandwich was served. 
The sandwiches came in paper for plates with small sachets of ketchup. The inside is air conditioned but the seating is extremely limited. 
The service was prompt but considering everything I believe pricing is a bit on the higher side having shelled out 170 fr both together.
Drop in if you are in the area as and need something to munch on.

This one's not the kind of cafe where you'd want to go for a long session of chatting with your friends. Go there when you are hungry, and willing to have decent coffees, sandwiches and other bakery items.

Location: Walk towards Sulekha along the footpath starting from 8B bus stand, and you'll locate it. 

It's a small shop, with small seating arrangements. The menu is small too, meaning, it's pretty straight forward, and you don't have to scan it for long to choose what you'd want to have.

I had cappuccino, and muffin, and both were pretty good in taste.

I'd surely visit the place for a few more times.

This place is located just within a short walk from 8b bus stand and pretty easy to miss. But the food they serve here is pretty good. I tried burger once by home delivery and went there at the outlet once. Both time the experince was good. Although the  selection of desert is limited due to.availability sometime. A quick filler for your fast food cravings.

Well  it's adjacent to 8b bus stand in jadavpur... Went there a couple of months ago.  I liked the cozy ambiance of the place but was disappointed with the food. The apple pie was dry n overpriced compared to it's quality. Overall my experience with this little food joint wasn't really satisfying :(

Tiny shop,very easy to miss ,if you donot know where exactly it is,even though situated on the main road,beside the  8b bus stand.The food quality is quite good! Only three tables could fit in the small space.Personaly love the doughnuts and the brownie! Apart from that,we have had the masala chicken puff,grilled chicken sandwich,burger and apple pie .ice coffee with ice-cream is a must everytime. It is quite pocket friendly and very near the university.

This is located just beside 8b bus stand in jadavpur . The main drawback of this outlet is space crunch and only 3-4 seats are available for dine in. It serves several kinds of bergers , pastries , doughnuts , coffee and beverages. The quality of food is okay but I personally didnt enjoy the experience

Went here yesterday with a friend. We had the grilled chicken sandwich, cola and tart combo. We also ordered the vul au vent and a truffle pastry. The pricing is really pocket friendly. But a few things that I'd like to mention are, the puff pastry of the vul au vent was a tad bit too chewy, and even the pastry of the tart was crumbling apart. It wasn't firm and the foam was not at all zesty. It was a lemon tart. So I'd wish the flavour of it would improve a bit. It was heavy with the cream. It seemed like it might have been kept out for too long, these two items. But the truffle pastry was really good and the sandwich was fresh and crunchy and yum! I am surely going to go back for more. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The only other thing, it's a bit small on the space front, and it can get cramped.

My first review while going through a personal crisis, I had a take away meal from this eatery.
02 Chicken pizza and 01 apple pie. The pizza was good as portion and the soft but the pie was a bit stiff,while i expected it to be crunchy outside and soft inside.
Overall, a medium experience.The staff is courteous.As this is in my area,maybe I will go again.

London Lounge is my favorite little place for coffee around Jadavpur. 
The food is nice  and the coffee cheap. But the best part about the place is the staff. Supriyo and his staff will make sure you have a nice time and cater to all your budgetary needs. 
The decor needs to be worked upon though.

I visited this place today with a friend of mine . It's a small eatery with 3 small tables. Honestly speaking,they can do a lot better with the decor.We had ordered a cheesy sausage sandwich,a shredded chicken sandwich,a cold coffee with ice cream and an iced tea.The sandwiches were okayish but the beverages were simply amazing.And the prices are extraordinarily cheap.I mean,where else can you get a cold coffee with ice cream for just 40 bucks?And the best part...NO VAT.I would definitely go there again.

Revised review(16.2.16):
Went there a few days ago for a quick bite.They have raised the prices way too much.That would have been okay if the quality of food was at par.But that is not the case.There was only one person there and he took way too much time to serve us.We had ordered a combo which had a chicken wrap,a grilled sausage sandwich and a coffee.We traded the coffee for a coke.The sandwich was really bad.It hardly had any sausages in it.The wrap was okayish.The combo cost us around 180 bucks.We had to order an egg devil and a chicken cutlet.The cutlet seemed to have gone bad.It smelled funny.The devil was good.My experience this time was disgusting.I am reducing my rating from 3 to 2.If you are gonna increase the prices,you should take a better look at your food too.

Was walking to have some snacks at Bake Club but then suddenly eyes fell on London Lounge. The name in an instant brought back nostalgia as my favourite pub in Europe was named the same. 
Anyways first impression was not good, the place looked deserted. Though the place is a small cute eatery, but the staff haven't maintained the place a small eatery should be maintained. 
Food - tried ordering the chickens eggs veggies club sandwich, only to be told that eggs were not available. I mean what does it take to keep a few boiled eggs. So finally we ordered -
1. Apple pie - crust too thick & soggy. The filling tasted of anything but apply. Overall disappointing.
2. Chicken sheek kebab sandwich - was hopping to have a rustic Indian kind of sandwich. But the sandwich was very thin. The filling was OK, disappointing it tasted nothing of chicken sheek kebab.
3. Cheese sausage roll - had cheese. Had sausages. But the veges was just lettuce & cucumber. Had expected much more. 

Overall, unless its durga Puja and I have no other options to eat I wouldn't enter again unless they improve.

I was passing by Jadavpur when I saw this place and it was an instant decision to go there ..so we jumped off the bus instantly ;) and we were not disatisfied I must say.What attracted me was the name.
Though its called London Lounge you wont get the feeling of either London or Lounge.Inside its a small cafe with seating capacity of 8-10 people.
Going by the Zomato suggestion I ordered chicken Vol Au Vent.Roasted chicken wrap and brownie with ice cream.

Chicken Vol Au Vent priced at 20/- rs each is quite a surprise.Looks small but tastes good.Finishes  in one big bite.I wish it was a bit bigger in size.

Next comes th wrap.Healthy option with salad n chicken  served with chips.Nothyn exceptional.I only had complain about the size again.

The brownie was good as well.

On a whole it was a satisfactory meal for two at 180 bucks ..not bad ..

P.S:A good pocket friendly place to hang out.
To the management it would be good if you can provide a wash basin.

Having read some decent reviews on Zomato, I visited the outlet last Monday and decided to opt for takeaway.

Location: It is at a prime location in Jadavpur, just besides the 8B bus stand. Hard to miss!

Ambience: I spent 10 minutes at most, but the ambience was nice.

Service: There were a couple of servers. After one handed me the menu, he let me know that not all of the items would be available The service was prompt as my order was ready within 10 minutes.

Food: I decided to go with a Chicken burger and a piece of apple pie.

Firstly the chicken burger. It was freshly made. The patty was a little bland for my taste. The lettuce leaves were pretty dry, but abundant red & yellow bell peppers and onions made up for that. The mayonnaise was perfect. My biggest complaint with my burger is that I discovered a strand of hair when I opened my takeaway bag/packet, just beside the burger. That is a huge mistake from the staff and frankly put me off.

The pie was delicious. The crust was smoothly baked and the filling had a rich flavour to it. I'd have definitely gone back for the pie, had I not had such a weird experience with the burger.

To be honest, I will probably stay away from the outlet, coz I'm not really sure about their cleanliness standards.

So London Lounge gave a stall at our college fest where we tasted some of their items like the chicken sausage roll, chicken vol au vent, and this other item whose name I can't recall. Oh, we also tried a brownie. The food was quite good, and we were impressed by the fact that they cost just 20 bucks each, so we decided to pay their outlet a visit. We ordered a roast chicken wrap and a chicken seekh kabab wrap. I really liked my seekh kabab wrap. The mayonnaise, which we noticed they made on spot was delicious, and the chicken pieces were soft and succulent. I took a bite from the other wrap and did not like it as much. The chicken was a little hard.
The service took some time. The prices are really, really cheap though with two wraps setting us back a mere 150 bucks. I'm definitely coming back again.

I had gone here for breakfast, and it is a nice little nook.
We ordered an herbed chicken grilled sandwich, along with a chicken value meal, which comprised of chicken grilled sandwich, a cold drink, and a lemon tart. The sandwich was nice, the chicken was well cooked, though devoid of any spices. The chicken was cooked without any masala, and will seem bland acc. to the Indian standards. The tart was good, but since am not a fan of them, it seemed okayish. The whipped cream on the top looked beautiful. The value meals are good value for money, and is very filling.

I went there yesterday on the hunt for a decent sandwich for lunch. I am happy to say that it didn't disappoint. This small shop tucked into one side of the street has a beautiful assortment of sandwiches, deserts and wraps. 

I ended up getting a chocolate doughnut and a sandwich, all the while trying to stay away from any more of the tasty looking deserts. The icing on the cake was that it was prepared in front of me, looked fresh, tasted good and was extremely affordable.

I hope to become more acquainted with this place in days to come.

The pricing of the food items is worthy of mention and their quality always made me to visit this place quite often. The cafe s very clean and tidy. The owners are very gentle. The combo meal is a great value for money. My favourite is shreeded chicken sandwich and the Choco chip muffin along with the chicken vol u vent. :-)

I had been eying London lounge fro some time now and finally decided to pay a visit, me and my girl went there and were overjoyed when we saw the vast array of desserts , baked goods, sandwich choices. 10 mins from my house , i am becoming a regular here for sure.

we ordered for chicken vol au vent, its their small puff filled with cheese and chicken and one bite  into it and you will understand the flavor and taste packed into it, the black-forest pastry , the shredded chicken sandwich ( fresh made), the chocolate mousse, everything is a delight , also they have a daily combo menu which combines interesting type of combos. The seating is okay, considering the space they have to work with, the decor is simple and appealing, but none of this matters as long as they cater to the taste buds of the people. 

Amazingly pocket friendly, easy to find, variety of grub, i thank the proprietor for taking the initiative. may u prosper leaps and bounds

P.S Have to try the vol au vent....

So, I have been visiting London lounge ever since it opened it's door to us. 
This small cafe nestled in Jadavpur is the best in the area. Since this cafe is about 10 minutes from my place so whenever I have my coffee over muffin craving, I rush here. 
I have tried almost everything that they have to offer, ranging from masala chicken puff to chicken vol-au-vent, to chicken sausage wrap/sandwich to danish pastry, to lemon tart to chocolate brownie with ice cream. 
The best part is they prepare the sandwiches and wraps right in front of you with freshly made ingredients. 
Their combos are to die for and worth your money and everyday they have a new one popping up their board. 
My favorites are the Stroganoff chicken sandwich and chocolate chip muffin. 
The staff and especially the owners, the brother duo, are humble and courteous. 
The joint is well decorated with creative posters and the quantity of food is appreciable. :)One time they even let us play our own choice of music by lending their in-house speakers. :PNeedless to say, their food venture is worth the money you would spend here. 
And, because of these reasons, I keep coming back. I cannot wait for them to expand their dream. :)Highly recommended for those essential quite times with a date or friend.

I visit this place at least two days a week...i am kind of in love with this little place. The freshly grilled sandwiches are what pulls me each time. 
 The club sandwich and the green olive chicken sandwich are my favorites. I really love the decoration they do with sauce and potato chips and I always end up asking for extra chips..
Among the many tit bits, i like the chicken vul-au-vent the most...but obviously the others are equally good. The apple pie is worth mentioning. Tarts are ok-ok type. 
But the best thing is the quality of their food compared to what they charge. This little joint does not burn a hole in your pocket....its truly pocket friendly.

I stumbled across this place by accident and was left pleasantly surprised with the food that I had. It wasn't the stale reheated stuff that is offered by other similar cafes. The food was fresh and the prices were reasonable.  The sandwiches and wraps come with some chips and tomato ketchup and it all tasted good. I really wish they would stop decorating the paper plates with ketchup in circular patterns though. It becomes a hindrance and one swipe turns it into a mess. Seating arrangement is a bit wonky too but its something that they are probably trying to figure out.So decent place, good effort by the people running this place. Hope they remain consistent with their standards as the place becomes more popular. 3.5/5 as of now.

Situated near the hustle and bustle of 8b bus stand in jadavpur, is this small eatery.. From outside, it looks pretty small, but dont judge it by that coz the food is really nice.. The place is not that comfortable due to lack of space, but what the guys have done in that small space is remarkable.. Its completely air-conditioned and the sandwiches r like d ones like u make in home.. So just give it a try.. M sure you will b surprised..

London Lounge is a sweet little confectionery right off the Jadavpur 8B bus stand. And it is the only such shop which offers seating arrangement (though they can accommodate only 3 tables with 2 chairs each). 
The biggest cheer goes for the menu. Their superbly reasonable combo meals are enticing in every aspect - quality, quantity and price. 

Next thumbs-up is for the chicken SANDWICH and WRAP ; they are made freshly as per your order.

It is a new joint and deserves appreciation for the quality and pricing of the food. Special menus are there as well (which I'm going to try out very soon!) 
Happy eating. :)

This is a new place near my university and I absolutely love it. :3

 It's a very small place and can accommodate maximum 10 people at a time. The serve great combo meals at a very friendly price. The food has a homely feel.

The chocolate truffle,the danish pastry and the sandwiches are very good. :)

As I was tired ???? from the same baked items of monginis Kathlen & cookie jar flury's are little out of reach due to price point , thought to try a new outlet at jadavpur named London lounge. Frankly I didn't expected much from them but after stepping in I was little shocked to see their offerings as they are little unconventional. The price point is also very budget friendly. The most amazing thing is the taste of the...felt like having the same items from cookie jar or flurry's.....so fresh..soft...yummy ????. Portion size is also very good and the best part is that the owner of this place Mr Supriya jana himself prepares the mocktails and grilled sandwich in the evening...which are simply delicious ????. Love ❤ to visit this place again and again. God bless.

Okay, so this place is new, and it has won my heart. This shop is like monginis, bake club etc. But, they have "sit-and-eat" facility, and above all the food is far far far better than those sold at the mentioned shops. I have provided the menu, and if you check it, you will see that it is a way too pocket friendly place. And, the desserts sold here are so tempting. Brownies were so nice. I visit Jadavpur often, and am glad I have found this place. A perfect place for snacks. Looking forward to visit it again and again. :D

Visited this tiny cafe last week. Ordered a grilled sandwich and a brownie with ice-cream. Though the look of the place failed to impress me much, the brownie earned a lot of brownie points for sure. 
Honestly, it's not a place I would travel a long way to visit, but if one happens to be near Jadavpur, then one can surely head towards this new joint. It's a pleasant change from the CCD or the Coffee House and prices are really pocket-friendly.
P.S. - They had a tempting looking apple pie to which I am yet to try out.
