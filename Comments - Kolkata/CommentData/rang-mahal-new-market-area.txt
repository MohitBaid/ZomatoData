Had biriyani and chicken reshmi kabab.. The biriyani was awesome.. The charged 80+tax for one glass of coke thats annoying. And the waiters are all ways rushing to take the tip..

The service was prompt.. Ambience can be easily given 3-3.5 out of 5.. It's pocket friendly place for eating up with friends on low budget.. The food is likely to be given a 3.5.. However is a nice place for low budget hangouts

Went for an quick lunch at rang mahal located near roxy cinema. We ordered mixed rice,chilli chicken,cold drinks,and fresh lime soda(salt). Food was not so impressive. Prawn in mixed fried rice was not fresh, chicken was thickly coated and fresh lime soda was too salty to drink.

Both chinese and Indian is available here.

I visited this place one evening long ago though with two of my friends. Well the place wasn't crowded that much. But the food quality was below average. Pocket friendly though. Not much recommend.

Just beside the roxy cinemas, a very average eatery. The place is cramped up, crowded. Food is also not that great. It is cheap though. At best, its worth for a drink or two with friends. Polite and decent staff.

This bar & restaurant is advisable to be visited during lunch time till 6.30 max if you are having any lady friend with you or if you are a girl going with your girl friends. Cheap booze and cheap food. But trust me you cant handle the crowd after 7pm coz it turns to a singing bar after that(i wouldn't mention anything else). 
Service personnel are extremely nice, polite and decent. Food was average, we had mixed haka chow and drums of heaven. Decor and ambience is basic with comfy couches on the mezzanine floor, the restaurant is clean and looked hygienic that's the best part.
We had no idea about it until the clock struck 7.30, it was a limit less cheap thrill. So early hours is safe for girls if you are in search of cheap menu in new market area.
