We had ordered chilli lemon chicken and Hong Kong noodles. The food was tasty and good both quality and quantity wise. The prices are inclusive of taxes and are quite reasonable. The ambience and staff are also good but it cannot accommodate a lot of people.

Momo Hut is located near Tala Park.
Here its more famous for takeaways.
They serve delicious rolls especially try the cheese egg roll,fills your tummy and value for money.
For takeaways they have counters outside.
Now,the food is good if you even go for dine in the service is a bit slow but food quality and quantity is good and mostly people try out momos and Chinese cuisines here.
A good place for family dining too,but cannot fit much people at a time.
The ambiance is not that bright but gives a warm feeling.
Overall it is good but needs some improvement like seating arrangements if possible and more options in the menu.

Their rolls are extremely tasty, i mean at par with the most sought-after joints in town. But, their mixed chow aint that good; i mean theres this stark contrast between the quality of their rolls and kebabs with that of their chowmein and the other stuff thats available.

Well found this little food buddy.
I didnt try much of dishes from here. 
But i am a go to visiter for this place whenever i land up here in a friend's place. 
I just can blindly point out that the Roll's here are amazing, close to any big roll joint the city.
The special mention from this place goes to Cheese chicken roll. This can highly please you from here. 
I have had 6-7 different kinds of roll's from here. This is my personal favourite.  
I would definetly recommend to all my roll loving buddies. If you have this hunger for roll's this place can just be the perfect joint for you.

I tried the momos they are awesome according to me. But the only drawback is that the place is small and the workers are slower than ever. I ordered only two plates of momos had to wait more than 30 minutes. For the delivery. If one oder rolls one need wait and eat outside as rolls are not allowed inside. The food is hot and fresh.

MOMO HUT, where I tried only two items FISH FRY & STEAM MOMO. These two items were not bad yet the momo soup could have been  better, prices are reasonable. (I think present zomato menu chart with price, of this restaurant , needs to be updated).

Quite a small place, AMBIENCE is so-so. Nothing, to say more. 

Although I am going to share a very old incident that I faced here but it's is something every one must need to know. Although the place is quite renowned in Paik Para but I must say it's a filthy place. The manager is rude , arrogant and loud spoken. He doesn't care about his customers at all. It happened such that I visited the place with my little sister and my friend we ordered food. The food came after some time I noticed that the food that I ordered contained small piece of glass. The whole noodles had piece of glass. Now tell what do you expect broken glass piece in your food. When we complained to manager he denied the whole thing and said we made false statements and we have purposely put the broken glass piece. Plz tell me how can a hungry person do such thing with her food. I feel this was the worst restaurant I have ever visit.

Take R.G. Kar hospital on your left & head towards Belgachia crossing & from there turn left walk around 5-6mins, on your right you will find your destination "Momo Hut"

Service:5/10
Quality & Taste: 7.5/10

In Zomato menu you will not find any "Roll" menus but if you go there you can take a cheese egg chicken/mutton roll. It's really good, before taking a bite you can't believe how much tasty it is. Except this I took #crispy_corn_chilli_chicken #red_hot_garlic_fish #american_chopsuey.
Chopsuey wasn't chopsuey at all form my point of view, it's ok 60% but flaws on the rest

I shouldn't tell anything about the ambience-decor because I took my food & deal with it at my home

I wanna confess that I am a true lover for momo. I love to have momos whenever I go near Belgachia. Each time I visited momo hut restaurant , they provided me with delicious momos. I had veg momos as well as non- veg momos in the restaurant with green chilly chutni and tomato sauce. The soup is incredibly delicious and is unlike any other soup which are provided with momos in other fast food stores. Also they have another flavour of momo called cheese momo and paneer momo which is truely yummy and mouth watering. 

The price is also cheap and you can go with your friends, family or your partner a perfect place to eat.

Located near Belgachia Metro, Momo Hut mainly serves Chinese & Tibetan dishes.

Ambience is nice with sitting arrangements. Chinese props used in decor.

Service is fine.

Ordered Chicken Momo & mixed Schezwan chowmein .
Momo was very nice with nice fillings. Soup provided with it was average. Chowmein was well cooked and was nice, spicy and tangy. Chowmein had ample fillings too.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Located near Belgachia Metro, Momo Hut belongs to one of the oldest joints of Paikpara, Northern Avenue area. I have been eating their Momos and noodles and fried rice since my school days. They have a very limited seating area though, with dim lights, below average interior and fast service this place has always been popular for take aways. Over the years they have increased the prices of their dishes but their has not been much change in the variety or quality of food.

This place is situated near belgachhia opposite to tala park. If you visit this place in the evening all u can see outside r ppl waiting for their rolls to be prepared. Inside place is a lil small with 5-6tables for dine in. We r a frequent visitor of this place as this area lacks a good place to get food. I had their pan fried chicken momo which are perfect in terms of their thin momo coatings and pan fried sauce. Fish fry was crisp thin slice and thank god the coating is thin and not coated thick which usually most shops does. Chicken rolls r good evening snack. Once ive availed there take away service whre ive orderd for chicken fried rice,chicken wok tossed noodles pan fried fish and chilly chicken. Pan fried fish was not properly marinated and cooked so was a lil smelly apart from tht other food were ok but they need to improve in there main course item's cooking.

Ordered fried momo.. (with complimentary soup)
Price: ₹90.00/-
Description: The momo was tasty and was smelling nice. But I personally did not like the soup. Outside of the shop, you can have roll and chow mein and inside you can get other meals. The restaurant is decorated with Chinese pictures and Chinese lights which basically adds a bonus point to the outlet

This restaurant is located very close to my house, exactly opposite to Tala Park. But I hadn’t tried it before fearing its poor quality. However, about a year ago the management underwent a change, which has brought about some major improvement.
The interiors used to be blunt and dark, but are much brighter and sophisticated now. Chinese themes have been rightly adopted while undertaking the décor. The seats are well arranged in comparison to before.

Not only the outward appearance, but also the class of food has been upgraded. As the name suggests, the restaurant specialises in Chinese cuisine. I haven’t went there for a dine-in, instead opted for a takeaway.
The Veg Sweet Corn Soup was nice with optimal quantity of corn bits and vegetables. The soup wasn’t too thick indicating the low amount of starch, which was nice. The Veg Fried Rice was also nice, not being over or under cooked. The Veg Gravy Noodles is an Indo-Chinese preparation. The chow mien had good assortment of finely cut vegetables. From the stall outside, we ordered a Cheese Paneer Roll and I have to say, it was one spectacular snack. I haven’t had so good rolls before, be it in any part of the city. There is literally molten cheese and considerable amount of paneer chunks stuffed inside.

Its decent place where you can have a good meal for a pretty reasonable price. My approximation for a filling meal for two souls is ₹500 or even lesser.

It is a low budget restaurant near the Paikpara crossing, towards Tala park. One could visit for a quick taste of Chinese food, mainly momos, chowmein, chopsuey, chilli chicken and similar items. 
I had ordered for a Chicken lung fung soup, halved into 2 bowls, it tasted ordinary, but the quantity was enough for two people.
Then came the pan fried chicken momo, which was really yummy!! All of it @ 160...

I didn't actually visit this place but was treated to a takeaway dinner at a family friend's house. We were served veg. sweet corn soup and crispy chicken for starter, followed by a main course of egg chowmein, mixed Schezwan fried rice, chilli paneer, garlic fish and chicken with baby corn and mushroom. Liked the chicken, sp the babycorn and mushroom which I am extremely fond of. On the whole, their food is moderately good and appetising, though not very satisfying when it comes to the essential taste and feel of Chinese cuisine.

A street side place with nothing very great about it but yet I rate it a 4.5 for its cleanliness... Decent ambience and most importantly for the fresh food that it serves. The gravy noodles is one of my favourites along with the cheese rolls that it serves. A great place to value your money .. The PAN fried Momo and the dry chilly chicken is also a must try at this place.

Momo Hut is a small street side joint exactly opposite to the Tala Park Circus Ground. The fact that I stay very near to Momo Hut makes me want to write this even more.
It is a fair joint for rolls and snacks. It makes decent food, where nothing is extraordinary and at the same time not disappointing also. The point that I would like to specify is the freshness of the food. They might not have outstanding chefs, but they serve fresh food. Also, they have revamped and redone the place as there are new owners now. Hence, it is worth a shot.
P.S. pan fried momos are on my must order list.

The decor is good , food is average but what makes it attractive is the price on the menu card... It is darn cheap by today's standard.
