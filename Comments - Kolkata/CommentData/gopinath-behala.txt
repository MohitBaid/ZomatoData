The best bengali Mishtis are available here. There are a variety of Mishtis to choose from. Each has it's unique blend of flavours and taste. You will get the authentic bengali Mishtis here. It's a sweet paradise for any bengali. I would definitely suggest you to try out all the sweets if possible! I love Gopinath <3

Having mistis and desserts from my childhood days. My family believe that if you want to taste sweet of behala try it from gopinath. My grandfather used to take me out there for kachuris and misti, so somehow  gopinath connects me with my late dadu. Staffs are very friendly, some of them knows me from my childhood days...it is my family sweet shop...

This sweet  shop is located between Sakher Bazer and Pushpashree. Basically they have two outlets in the same location just at a distance of 8 to 10 steps from one another. I love their Cadbury Sandesh, and Radhaballavi too.  Try the bati sandesh . They provide and customize sweets for any type of occasions.

Gopinath is a sweet confectionary located at Behala. It sells a variety of sweets & a few snacks too.

Tried Malai chamcham , butter scotch sondesh and vegetable chop. Sweets were fresh and had balance in sweetness. Chop was nice too. 

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

It caters the need of local people pretty well.

This is a bullshit sweet shop. The Fatty Black Mamba sitting in the middle adds to its ugliness. He doesn't know courtesy and behaviour. Now coming to the quality of sweets, many a times they serve 2-3 days old rasgullas. They taste sour and rubbish.  I also found spider in rasmalai once. With this quality and behaviour, the end of this shop run by some arrogant and ugli people is very near.

One of the most well known sweet shop in behala - its a hidden gem. Their sweets are perfectly balanced with sugar content. Die for their deep fried kachori and sabzi, which rins out of the stock if you are a late visitor.

Dalpuri with there aloor dam is for the laid back morning to cherish.Samosa is another item that has a unique taste at Gopinath.Patrons can identify the taste any given day. Coming to there sweets , the variety is quiet a page full, with a few must tries like Mihidana and Malai Cham Cham.For me to doze the fire of my Sweet craving , I look no further than Gopinath.

Gopinath is one of the most renowned sweets shops in the Behala area. It has two branches, both are situated in the same area. I have tried their many items over years. There is no doubt about their food quality and quantity. The price is reasonable. Evening snacks are also available. Their hot rasgullas are my favourite. So 4 stars for them.

Gopinath is still the leader among the sweet shops in Sakherbazaar and its vicinity. I started visited this place from my school days - I used to have Dahi Vada and Vegetable Chop in the early evenings while returning from school with my friends.

They keep churning out new varieties of sweets to compete with their peers like Ganguram which has come up and also Shree Krishna which is also quite good.

But nowadays I have heard that under the new ownership the behaviour of the staffs have degraded which is not a good sign.

Talsash is one of my all time favourite :)

Its countless times that I have been to this place from my childhood and now I am logically a daily customer here. Sweets are something I need at-least once a day and as its a shop tats close to my place and serves good sweets and snacks than the others close by so I always prefer this place. Now coming to this place: They are old and have two outlets just within the gap of three shops in between. It has improved a lot from before and you will find quite a few variety of sweets here. The price is reasonable and the taste is also good. You can try their new addition thats a mango flavoured sandesh, their rashomalai and rabri and the komola bhog as they are really good. Staffs are very friendly here.

Located in Sakherbazar, sakherbazar just become Ganguram & Gopinath. It has a variety of sweets that you would be too tempted to choose. Misti doi and mango doi is famous here.

The quality,quantity & the behaviour of the Fatty Young Owner has degraded. There was an incident of my junior, Junior didnt had Re 1 change & he said he would return next day & that fatty..kept the entire Rs 10 from him & ask him to bring re 1 next day and then take the Rs 10 note with a very rude tone. Being such a reputated sweet shop and that you call 'Behaviour'. 

Now comming to thier one of the sweet namely gulab jamun. 
Taste it sometimes..then u will understand what piece of 3rd class quality they serve.The sugar syrup in which gulab jamun get mix with will taste more like water rather than sugar syrup..and who the hell, will call that gulab jamun.. WORTHLESS!!

Glad that Ganguram came up.. & with this behaviour and this quality END IS NEAR!!

The food  here  is  good ,  for  a  true  Bengali  style  breakfast  comprising  of  kachori  sabzi  and  jalebi   this  is  the  right  place  to  hit  if  you  are  in  the  vicinity. The   kachori had  a  nice  filling was  good  to  taste and  warm ...the  sabzi   was  subdued   much  like  a hygienic  homely   version  of  the  spicy  palate  offered  at  many  sweet  shops . The  amriti  we  tasted  was  quite  nice though lacked the crunch a little in my  opinion ,  but  was  not  too  sweet  which    was  a  nice  change  and  much  suit  the people  who  are  not   too  keen  on  tasting  overtly  sweet items  or  are  forbidden  to  intake  a  lot  of  sugar  in  their  food...Overall  a  good  place  for   breakfast  at  an  affordable  rate.

A lazy evening and i was at home and was too bored. Decided to go and have something. Soo went out , saw this shop. The sweet lover in me woke up and i decided to give it a try.

Location -- at behala sakherbazar. It is located at a distance of only 5 mins walking distance from my home. A simple sweet shop more or less located at behala sakherbazar more towards silpara. They have two branches located side by side.

Ambience -- just a typical sweet shop. Nothing to mention about ambience. 

Sweets -- the sweets are very typical and has a touch of bengaliness. Everything ranging from rasgullas to kala kad to dhokla to singara is available. Everything is pretty decent.

2 minutes from my place and have visited this place enormous times. Located in Skaherbzar, this is a well known sweet shop in Sakherbazar and in the behala area.

In the evening and in the mornings you get kachuri which is nice. You can even pound on the khasta singara, but some how I do not like the taste of singara from this place. 

A strict no to the malpoa, I hate than oil draped sweet. The good ones being the kancha golla and sandesh along with rasmalai you can also try the dhokla if you are loucky enough to get it. But I must admit that the quality of the sweet in this place have degraded over the years.

Had a very bad experience today. Purchased 20 pcs of chanar roll and amsotte mora sondesh. Before taking,  confirmed from the shop that whether those were fresh. The shop employee confirmed that these were absolutely fresh. But ultimately when we had after some time....it had turned bad. Had taken to the inlaws house for some function. Completely feeling embarrassed. I would not recommend any body for this shop.

I have lived in calcutta for over 30 yrs and in the process have become more of a bengali than anything else....and for most of bengal, a box full of delicious bengali sweets beats almost any other gift!!

For people who live around the behala area in calcutta, you just can't miss a trip to gopinath at the sakherbazar crossing. they have a very wide variety of sweets for all types of choices.

My personal favorites there are their mishti doi, raabri, kachouri and gulab jamuns. Obviously bengalis dont need a guide in a sweet shop!

Their specialty is their taste, variety and innovation. They make several kinds of new @and innovative sweets during festivals and special days too.

I now live in bangalore but every time i visit calcutta, i ensure i parcel about 100 - 150 sweets to last me a few days after i return to bangalore! and i am NOT exaggerating!

This place serves the best sweets in the locality and I have had their sweets from the the very initial years of my life!!!  Surely they have a good variety of sweets which are more or less equally tasty I should say. But in the recent years their chocolate sandesh has been a favorite. The jalbhaara sandesh they make are good and this winter they have just brought out the spread of nolen gur sandesh which I have tasted and relished as always. Besides this special mention goes for the pink sandesh they often refer to as the paturi sandesh,the ice cream sandesh and the pista sandesh.
Other than this the snacks they make are equally great. The radhaballavis they make are heavy,crunchy and tasty. Overall a good place for people with a sweet tooth!

Sometime back this place once saved me when I was at Behala for some work, they serve samosas and kachoris in the morning and nice old style bengali sweets, though this place is a small one but the varieties of sweets they serve is really great. Try out their Kora paak-er sandesh and rasogolla if you are here. Would like to visit again for sure when I am at this place in future.

A must place for the sweet lovers to visit, Gopinath offers a rich variety of sweets as well as snacks.

Chocolate Sandesh and Pista Sandesh are the two favorites which I never miss out whenever I visit this place.

The sweets are very fresh and soft and tastes simply great!!

Gopinath is the best sweet shop that we have in the Behala area other than Rabindra sweets. All their sweets are fresh and the yogurt they prepare is absolutely lovely. Most of the sweet shops now put a lot of dalda in the curd to make it thick, but Gopinath's curd is very light and tasty. Also I love the Dahi Vada they make and their Chocolate sandesh as well as the GaWja. The samosas have a perfect blend of spices and badam in it and makes for a great evening snack.
