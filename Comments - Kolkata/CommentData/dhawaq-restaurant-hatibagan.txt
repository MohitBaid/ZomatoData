Chicken Bharta is too good. Small restaurant but good ambience. Great place to have food with limited pocket pinch. Looking forward to have tandoor items and biriyani over there

It was nice place... Newly opened,  ambiance is good as compare with little street restaurant. Price is cheaper. Hospitality is good but food is some spicy. I have a suggestion to cook that to make the food less spicy & don't decorate with napkin.

Me and my friends went during d pujas..
But the food quality was not at all good..
We order two mutton biriyani, one chicken biriyani and one mixed fried rice..
Talking abt the biriyani, the meat was not boiled properly..
In mixed fried rice I got only egg and less amount of chicken and prawns..and the dish was too sweet..
The place was cozy..
