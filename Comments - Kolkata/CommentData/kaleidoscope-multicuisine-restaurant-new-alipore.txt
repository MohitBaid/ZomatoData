One of the worst restaurant I have ate from. They have no consistency in terms of their taste, quality and quantity. We have had chicken soup, crispy chilly baby corn, tandoori chicken. Every time I order from there the same food tastes different. Sometime it's too spicy or less crispy. I don't understand why do they do that

I ordered tandoori roti and mutton do piyaza at Nobomi for dinner as home delivery. The rotis were unexpectedly soft and they served four pieces of mutton in one dish with gravy. Their packaging way is also good. Though I didn't find the wow factor, but I had a very good dinner experience in that night.

This was one of the best home delivery food. I had ordered a Chinese fish combo. It comprised egg fried rice, fish in manchurian sauce and fish pakoras. 
The rice was perfectly cooked,very good quantity (neither too much nor too less) and the fish pakoras were also nice. The fish in the gravy was a bit soggy but can't complain as during puja it must have taken more than usual time to deliver. 
Overall a very nice meal. 
Looking forward to try other combos as well.

Rice was the best. I had a tongue ulcer so most food was tasting like fire though i believe it was not soooo spicy. Excellent atmosphere.  cozy. Went with a friend who is the owners sister. He's recently quit his 5 star hotel job to return to India and opened this restaurant. Best of luck man

I tried veg biryani and veg thali here....the quality is good but dont expect north-like taste here....but places like these are rare in Kolkata, so pay it a visit if you cant find anything else around.....

Had a get together with a group of friends.  Was really surprised by the high quality of the foods specially the top class quality of the ingredients used.
It is a multicuisine resturant which does justice to its name. Must try the Mongolian pot rice and Chicken malai kebabs. Simply irresistable.
Great show guys! Keep it up.

Finally a good place to have Chinese food in New Alipore at a decent price. I've been to this place twice. Once for Chinese and next time for North Indian. Their North Indian section is yet to be fully functional. Out of the limited menu of North Indian food, we tried Butter Chicken and Dal Tadka, and found them to be absolutely delicious.¬†
In chinese, we had tried Chilly Chicken and Pan Fried Chilly Fish with mixed Hakka Noodles. They were absolutely mouth watering and came in decent quantity.

The restaurant is run by a family who have long stint in restaurant industry. They monitor the food quality and taste personally. Will keep frequenting this place !

A quaint new restaurant which is as of now more of a take away center for its limited seating capacity, which we discovered on our visit to Kolkata this time. We had ordered home delivery for chicken hakka noodles, pan fried chilli fish, dried chilli chicken and chicken spring rolls. All the items were perfectly cooked and tasted just wow. The pan fried fish and chilli chicken were on the spicier side and satiated my taste buds perfectly. I am a bit picky when it comes to spring rolls as in most places, either they are overtly fried or underdone. The spring rolls out here were just perfectly crispy and had great chicken fillings. Our friends recommended the vegetable momo here which we plan to try next time. A big thumbs up to this new venture and a definitely recommended place !!!!
