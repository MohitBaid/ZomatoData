Order chilli fish, food quality is okay type, taste wise also okayish, but it serves good food well under budget, very cheap as compared to other restaurants in barrackpore.

One of the worst place to Dine in Kolkata..I stay in Delhi and had come to kolkata near barrakpore for some work...It was my big mistake to check in to this restaurant...Food quality is pathetic and smells bad.They do not even know how to properly cook a gravy dish..Chicken was really hard and they dont know what do you mean by tandoori chicken and Chicken Biryani smells so horrible.
Guys, dont even go near this place ,you have lots of better options at Barrakpore.Even Biryani and Tandoori available on the streets of Delhi or even in Kolkata are much better.
,How can zomato allow the owners of this restaurant to rate their own restaurant with 5 stars (Hilarious!!!!)I guess the whole objective of review is about the opinion of customers or third party....

Quantity is too small.
The quality is the worst.
They charged so much for each and every food item and yet their food quantity and quality is so so so so bad.
We ordered a chilly chicken and the chicken's size is so so small that hardly anyone can eat.
Even they charged 5rs. Extra for the mineral water which is offensive nowadays..

I have visited this place 3-4 times food was really good... I liked their Thai chicken curry and sizzlers a lot... Staffs are also very hospitable...mocktails are also yummy.. At this price segment.. 
The only issue is they took a lot of time to prepare the food.. So most of the time you have to wait for  at least half an hour...during this years durga puja we have to wait for almost 1:30 hrs.. It was quite frustrating.. But overall as I rated it 7/10... Considering the price..

Hey guys pls do not (I say DONOT) ever consider this place for food delovery. Generally I do not write negative reviews but this case is something separate.  I placed an order of a spl mutton biryani, paneer rice and kacchi mirch walla murgh at approx 8PM. They have delivered it with a delay of more than 2 hrs. In the mean time I have call them several times and they told me that the order will be delivered within 10 min (@ 9 PM approx). I call them thrice and every times I was told that the delivery boy is on the way only. After 10:30 they even stopped receiving  my call. At 10:50 I received my delivery. Initially I thought that I will not receive the delivery but considering the apology from the delivery boy I received my order. Now come to the point of the items delivered. Delivery box was broken and all the greavy was spreaded inside the plastic packet. Biryani mutton was too stiff and hard. Quantity and quality both very poor. I will not order ANYTHING from this restaurant ever in future. Beside thanks team Zomato for your support in this issue. A thumbs up for  A ZOMATO and a hard slap on #Daawat-e-ishq (mera saare ishq Nikal Gaya bhai tere upar se. Sorry and shukriya).

Please be sure whether you can deliver before taking an order. It is disgusting and really ridiculous to cancel an order after 2hours of wait right at 10:30pm when the customer is waiting for the food.

Worst food quality. Food was not even fresh. It was smelling not good. Even the chicken pieces were so small after paying 150rs for this. It's better not to buy anything from them.

I ordered the food from zomato. The taste was good, had to pay extra 20 rupees for packaging even after booking the meal online. My suggestions would be please add the pricing in Zomato itself as many people don't use cash nowadays. Secondly, I ordered Kung Pao Chicken and I was shocked to receive a gravy dish of Chicken with no cashew nuts. I would suggest the restaurant to google about Kung Pao chicken before adding it in the menu. I was left disappointed extremely. The Schezwan noodle was good, the crispy chicken was not crispy but tasted okay, Kung Pao Chicken was really not Kung Pao Chicken and I haven't tried the chicken bharta yet but I do believe it would be good. Thanks for the food and please rename the Kung Pao Chicken to "Boneless Chicken Gravy".
                    

Note: Expect the food to arrive late. It took more than a hour for the food to arrive.

Too late service,  waited for nearly 40 min for a plate of biriani. Too bad facility. Service quality bad.  Need to improve in all segment.  Surely not suggesting any other one.

Newly opened resturant offering some great cuisine. The Interiors r cozy and well decorated. Expertise in their mocktails so do try them. Food recommendations- special mutton Biriyani, chinese is worth tasting here.  Value for money as the quantity is enough to serve 2 people at a go. Service is quick as this place Isn't crowded with customers and those who loves solitude can surely give it a try.

Awesome place for hanging out with friends and family. The food quality was good. We ordered chilly garlic, chicken do piyaza, virgin mojjito. The ambience was good too. Daawat-e-ishq is little different from other restaurants in Barrackpur, they create a quiet romantic atmosphere inside it..

Good place , cozy .. the wait staff are very helpful & interactive . We ordered the chili fish , tangri kebab , Kashmiri nan , mutton bhuna masala & biriyani which was also the special of the day .. every thing was good & tasty . The only criticism probably is that the food took a bit long to arrive . All in all a good experience .
