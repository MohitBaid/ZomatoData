Overpriced roadside restaurant trying to pass of as fine dining. Charged 100 for a plate of Momo which was bland and definitely not upto the mark.

Strictly below standard....that’s the only word which comes to my mind when I think of my experience there. We had ordered a parcel of mixed friend rice in the afternoon; we informed at the counter that we would be picking it up later in the evening, prior to our dinner. We even made advance payment for their convenience. However, when we reached home we were stumped to find that it contained not fried rice but chowmein. This was after we had clearly mentioned our order to the person sitting there at the front desk. It was too late in the night to change the parcel, so we decided to have the chowmein itself for dinner. That proved to be a blunder on our part, for the bland noodles simply killed off any appetite that was left!

Extremely unpalatable food. Biryani is probably the worst I've ever had, the fried rice had chunks of sugar that completely ruined the taste. Affordable, yes. But absolutely horrendous food.

This restaurant is located opposite to Tribarna Sangha in Kasba near Acropolis Mall. It is a small shop with a modest seating capacity which provides a full money's worth with its food. We were a group of 3 and had Veg Hakka Noodles along with Garlic Chicken and were very much satisfied with the quality of the food at that price.

The place has been a staple takeaway joint for two years now and has not disappointed me till date leaving aside a very few dishes. Starting from their pulao, to other Indian non veg dishes, chilly chicken, manchurian chicken, hakka noodles, fried rice, everything tastes good and the quantity is on point as well. Recently however, i ordered their chilly fish, which was not good and smelly. So guys, i would recommend you not to opt for their fish, but the rest is definitely a yay!

I had ordered food from this joint few days back and waited for 2hrs to get it delivered.? When I had called restaurant they said order cannot be delivered.this is something very unprofessional because its a face loss in front of guests when your food is not delivered at 10pm and you cannot order it from anywhere else. Pissed off from this unprofessionalism. I think zomato should remove such restaurants who donot have such minimum commitment levels from their list.

Located n Kasba, this small restaurant/roll-joint belongs to a very close family friend. From the outside it’s a small take away – cum- restaurant like any other ordinary place.What makes it different and special is the food it offers!

Needless to say, I’ve been here numerous times. Among the dishes they offer, I love their dry chilli chicken, tandoori chicken (roasted) and mixed fried rice. The hakka noodles, gravy noodles, fried baby corn and paneer Manchurian are mouth-watering too. Another dish I would recommend is the chicken Manchurian. The chef is a specially talented one, and his chicken dishes are among the best in the city. But the main reason people visit this place is for their take-aways. Even on dull Saturday nights, the front counter is swarmed with people ordering a horde of dishes for take-away. The prices are really less for the quantity and quality of food served. One can gorge different items one after other and still fail to get a substantial bill in the end.

The small seating arrangement, and barely visible nameplate is hardly a thing to attract the customers who pass by one of the most regular stretches - the Rashbehari Avenue Connector. Yet what can make it stand out is the value-for-money did that they serve. I got to have a taste of some of their better dishes, thanks to a friend. They serve excellent Tandoori Chicken, which can give even the better restaurants of the city a run for their money (or was it the special treatment?), and even the Crispy chilly bany corn was delicious. I equally loved the Dry Chili Chicken they served, which had, surprisingly a great balance between sweet and spicy. Overall, it's primarily a take away joint, but it's one of the hidden gems that is worthy of a try.

It's one of the oldest outlet in the area... the place was pretty unhygienic... deco was very ordinary... ambience was nothing great too... had some seating inside... I never dine there... only tried their egg chicken roll... and it was good... staffs are very well behaved n service was good too... pocket pinch was friendly...

It might not be appropriate to call this one a hidden gem but it definitely deserves the attention of hardcore chicken lovers. If you love your tandoori, tikkas and reshmis, this place is the ultimate 'value for money' joint. The pieces are really good and wholesome but I've noticed that the quality of main course dishes fluctuates depending on whether it's a weekday or a weekend! Good place to try out once in a while when there's a cash crunch!

Went there with my friend. Its basically a delivery outlet . Inside there's a very small setup with only 3 tables , hardly an area of less than 200sq ft. An AC does make the atmosphere quite comfortable inside.Now, coming to the food, myself ordered a Chicken Biryani with Mixed Raita and my friend a Veg Hakka Noodles with a plate of Crispy Chilli Baby Corn. Food was served within 10 minutes and it was fresh and hot. Biryani was quite awesome with almost no-oil from outside,quite dry .. Tasted good too. Had an egg and a fairly large chicken chest piece inside. Spices were perfectly mixed with a fair aroma. Raita quantity was good too. Tasted fine. Noodles was of good quality, cooked well and Crispy Chilli Baby Corn was quite a bit too spicy though quantity could have been more but it was okay , red in colour but tasted fantastic with the noodles. The best part : NO TAXES, SERVICE CHARGES AND IT WAS MORE THAN POCKET FRIENDLY, ONLY RS.400 FOR TWO PEOPLE ... !!!! Can be visited again anytime by anybody ...

After a hectic schedule some food was required.. Blues served as a best friend at that time by providing quick service... We had 5plates mixed fried rice, munchurian chk,  hong kong chk and red pepper fish.... And we were 6 people total.... And we all could not finish those items due to their ample quantity... 
The price is also quite reasonable... For all these we were charged with 1100 only... 
Isn't that cool??!!

Visited this quaint little place for a sudden dinner plan with friends. It has only about 3 or 4 tables, but the place is nice and clean.
We ordered Chicken Biryani, Butter Na'an, Chicken tikka masala and aloo raita.
The food was EXCELLENT.  The biryani was not greasy, the raita was well-seasoned and the tikka masala was bursting with flavours. 
We split the bill equally (we were 5 people) and each had to pay less than 150.

Definitely visiting again :)

Blues's is one of those restaurants that serve very Indian version of Indian-Chinese, and local version of Mughlai food, in good quantities and at reasonable price. It will suit you on a day of quick take-away cravings, when you want to eat non-home food, but do not want to fine-dine (or spend money). 

In essence, there are hundreds of Blues scattered around each neighborhood in Calcutta, and if this is in yours, you should try it out. 

What I absolutely love about places like this, is the absolute disconnect and in-congruence of names these places chose to be christened with - like an Indian Chinese restaurant being called Blues, after a genre of music, its owners and staff must be unaware of, or another named after Moonlight Sonata, even though Beethoven's composition had nothing to do with Chicken Manchurian. Such restaurants are wonderful, not for the food they serve, but for the unique identities they add to a city's urban-scape.

Blues has been a life saver for three years now. Have been getting rice, rolls, rotis and curries from this place and the food has rarely disappointed. One of those places where you park your bike, get food packed in ten minutes and leave. Very cheap as expected and 100% value for money.

The only thing I have tried here are the Steamed Chicken Momos which are decently priced and comes with a good serving both in terms of the quantity as well as the Soup that comes along with it.

The menu is pretty vast and gives a lot of options which might tempt customers.It also has options of ordering half size portions which is good.

It is very crowded during weekends so one can expect a good amount of wait time.

This little place huddled just off the R.B.Connector has been there since forever.And it is the best place for takeaway that I have found out in the stretch inspite of all the fancy places around.Has a small seating area which can be perfect for a little bite.Coming to the taste..Having tried allmost everything from North Indian to Chinese and the Rolls this place can make a mark.Gravy Chowmein tastes wonderful so does the Dry Chilly Chicken.The chicken Momo is filled with stuffing to the core and perfectly cooked unlike the heartless over softened momos that we get commonly.The Biriyani from this place is my absolute favourite coz it is light and full of flavour!Rolls are large in proportion and can be very filling too.Even the Lasuni or Reshmi kebab that they serve are surprisingly at the same level of other branded mughlai places in the city.They serve a pleasantly large quantity and  1 portion of main course can fill two hungry people with ease.This place hardly bites into your pocket so can experiment and splurge.Delivery is prompt and the packing is also hygienic.Staff helps you out with the food selection and service is prompt.
Have never been disappointed from this place so would recommend it for the flavours.Don't be too judgemental by the looks coz you are there for a gastronomic experience!It might look old and tucked away but it is a hidden gem when it comes to tingling the taste buds!

A decent place for a quick bite.
None of the items on the menu are likely to tingle your tastebuds, but based on what they cost you can hardly expect them to.
An accceptable joint for college or school students to visit for a snack when running low on cash.

Located at the Trbarna Sanga Crossing on the Rashbehari connector this is more of a take away than a sit in, though they have a small dine-in place.
The Food is average. The kababs and tadoori is just above average, one cant complain. The Chinese is typical feel good taste of Kolkata cuisine.
They make a good kathi roll.

If you are looking for ambiance this is not the place. They have the cutlery right next to a wash basin with basin water sprayed on it, so not very high on my hygine list either.

But this is  place that is on your way home, and you can duck in for some momo and thupa in this winter. The taste and feel will largely depend on your hunger rather than the skill of the chef.

Not a place I recommend to go and have dinner, but as evening snacks, decent value for money.

Blues is a small restaurant in Kasba serving Chinese and North Indian cuisines. The place is located near Tribarna bus stop and is an old shabby looking place. The place is definitely a penny saver and should be treated as a cheap eatery and not for regular dinning.

The food is nothing out of the blue as it is quite average. I tried out the Chinese section and can say that it is very plain and simple. The Chicken Hakka noodles were quite fine and so was the Chicken Sweet and Sour. However the Fried Chilli Baby Corn was a total disaster as it was completely tasteless and horrible. It was very oily and had no taste of Baby Corn.

Prices are very reasonable and quantity is also very good. Home delivery was appreciable as there was no confusion regarding my address and the food was delivered within 1.5 hrs, seen such good home delivery service in a long time. Packing was also done great with no gravy leaking out.

So, could be worth a try for a cheap Chinese lunch or North Indian dinner if you live nearby.

GOOD FOOD AT AFFORDABLE RATES!

The restaurant is located near the Tribarna Sangha bus stop. You can add this to the list of places to visit for those family lunches and dinners. They have an extensive offering of Chinese and north Indian dishes. Anyone who decides to have a meal here will definitely be spoilt for choice. As much as we could manage, we sampled both the Chinese and north Indian fare. But we liked more of the north Indian dishes than the Chinese ones.

From the Chinese section, we ordered mostly their meat dishes like Crispy Chicken, Chilli Prawns and Sweet and Sour Fish. The dishes were well cooked and simply tantalized our taste buds. The chicken pieces were crispy and juicy like the ones you get at KFC. Similarly, the fish pieces in the sweet and sour dish were covered in thick gravy, and the pieces were meaty and succulent. Had those with veg fried rice. After the tasty Chinese dishes we simply couldn't wait to devour their tandoori items. So, we went ahead and ordered Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Mutton Rezala and had these with Nans. The kebabs were simply mouth watering and well turned out. Even then, our food experience wasn't complete because they did not offer any tandoori mutton items. Though their Rezala and tandoori items are not like the ones you get in the more established Mughlai food joints of Kolkata, you still cannot fault them for that. We simply couldn't resist ourselves and had to take home some fried Momos as well. The prices at which the food is available are affordable in terms of quality and quantity. The waiters are friendly and well mannered.

Though it was a chance discovery and had gone there with my family; it is definitely and positively worth checking especially for people living in south Kolkata.
