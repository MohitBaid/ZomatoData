If you are a fan of south indian food, who wants to break the monotony of the masala aloo and vegetable stuffings in your dosa, then DOSA@TWIST is the place for you. It's amazing how their innovative combination of flavours can work wonders with your taste buds.
Not into the south indian cuisine? As long you are open to experimentation, don't let that come in your way of visiting this eatery.

LOCATION- It's inside a lane, at a walking distance from lake mall, near Deshapriya park. A bit hard to locate. You may miss the entrance at first.

AMBIENCE- It's a cozy little place, with nothing as such remarkable in the decor, except a decorative mirror and some paintings. The wash basin is in a seperate space beside the seating area, so to wash your hands you have to go out of the eating area, which is inconvenient.The place needs to up it's setting.

SERVICE- Was okay. The lady at the counter ( probably the owner) was very well behaved.

FOOD- We had ordered chicken pizza dosa, butter paneer matar cheese dosa and chicken achari masti.

The Chicken pizza dosa was the highlight. It was sooo delicious. It looks like a pizza but you get the taste of dosa along with the chicken n cheese. It was cheesy with ample toppings.

Butter paneer matar cheese dosa and the chicken achari masti were served like masala dosas with their respective fillings, and accompanied by sambar and 3 different types of chutneys. The sides were served as many times as needed.
The chicken achari masti had a quirky flavour which i loved.The butter paneer matar cheese dosa was also good.

PRICE- The pocket pinch isn't much.

Looking forward to trying their chocolate dosa on the next visit.

While searching for affordable good food I came across this place. The ambience was ok ok. We ordered a chicken pizza dosa and a chicken cheese butter masala dosa. The pizza dosa did not please me but since my friend enjoyed it I think it all depends on the personal choice of a person. The chesse butter masala dosa was good but cheese was less. Coming to the price, it has increased than what is shown on the page here. We felt it was a bit overpriced but overall fills up the stomach. @

Innovative dosas. That basically sums it up. But wait, the sheer number of varities they offer is immensely huge. So, hearing about this place for a while now from a friend I tried giving it a go. You might miss the entrance at first go bit it's adjacent to Zeeshan at Deshopriyo Park. But thankfully the friend with me know the place well.

Coming to the food, we ordered a cheese chicken dosa and a egg mushroom chesse butter dosa. Haha! I know, that sounds epic, right?! It was. The chesse was plenty though, me being me, I wouldn't mind a little bit more. üôÑ The dosas were fairly large and served with sambar, dal and two types of chutney. As many servings of the sides as you want.

It's a pretty small place but perfect for a cozy meetup, pretty okay, decoration wise. But I'd have loved to see some drinks on the menu if possible. Something along the lines of buttermilk, maybe. ‚ò∫Ô∏è This a hidden gem with a lot of potential. Until your next meal, stay hungry, stsy foolish!

Ordered chicken dosa from dosa @ twist, lake market area today afternoon. Derivery took more than 1 hour.  

Dosa was pretty decent. It was still hot, thanks to the excellent packaging. 

Overall, good experience. I can say that I had something different. The place serves exactly what the name suggests!

I read an article listing the 10 most cheesy dishes one can try in Kolkata and there was the mention of the Mutton Cheese Dosa from Dosa @ Twist. Being a crazy cheese lover of course I ran straight down here to try it üòÇ and I really liked it. Some of you may think it's a strange combination, mutton and cheese but it was actually very good. The Dosa was crisp and the filling was cheesy and mild spicy with generous quantity of mutton. The Dosa was served with three kinds of chutneys- the white coconut chutney which I loved, an onion chutney and a green pudina chutney which were okay. Then there was the sambhar of course and we all love sambhar don't we? üòÇ
Now about this place what I came to realise is that it is run by a group of amateurs so professional behavior is not expected of them but the place also makes you feel at home üòä
The ambience here is kind of mundane. They can really work on jazzing up the furniture and the walls a bit. 
This time I went there to try exclusively the mutton cheese dosa but I would surely go back to try the other dishes on the menu.

Ordered a Pizza Dosa because I was delighted to see the photos already posted by others. The order came to my house within 40 mins. The packaging was done nicely so that the pizza doesn't get jumbled up inside even if it was held vertically. Coming to the taste, it tasted almost like a pizza due to the amount of cheese but the base gave a constant reminder that it is a dosa. Overall its a wholesome meal. Will definitely try other items next time as they have a huge variety of items in the menu.

The dosa's served over here are way different from the regular ones found at any south indian restaurant.
Chicken egg mutton  n many other whacky things stuffed inside the humble dosa. The taste is a big hit.
Gives u break from the regular potato and onions.
This place is a dream come true for people like me who equally love non-vegetarian food and south indian food.
A must visit place for all.

I love South Indian dish, it's healthy but it became even more tastier when I tried fusion flavored Dosa at "Dosa @ Twist" A super blend of non veg with South Indian dish. I tried Chicken Pizza Dosa and Chicken Dosa both taste good. Ambience and service is nice. And last but not least it is pocket friendly.

This place is situated next to zeeshan restaurant at Despriyo park, kalighat.

I will strongly recommend this place for south Indian food lover.

They offer variety of Veg and Non-veg Dosas and other south Indian dishes.

We took PIZZA DOSA, BABY CORN DOSA,  UTTAPAM & EGG PLAIN DOSA.

all taste awesum, but be careful of green chutney its really hot,  but i love to eat chilly so i loved it.

Lady who run that restaurant is very kind and polite, she respond very nicely to every customer.

Its is true that place is not very big and ambience not very attractive but the same is enough to make you love that place.

In last 3 month i personally visited 3 times.

In my next visit i will try KEEMA PAO

Prices are Reasonable.

Yesterday we visited the place. Tried the chicken cheese dosa which was good. Pizza dosa was the best and innovative. Never tried before. Keema pao which I didn't like. The keema gravy ought to have been a bit thicker. Taste was simple not so good. Lastly for the dessert we had chocolate dosa which was very good indeed. Overall a good one to try for low budget. Prices are cheap. Would like to visit again  to try their other stuff.

A small nicely done up place beside the Zeeshan outlet near Desapriya Park, it has a modern take on dosas. It serves non-veg dosas along with the regular veg varieties and the menu is quite extensive. I have been there a couple of times and I quite liked the chicken cheese and the mutton cheese dosas. The chicken pizza dosa wasn't that good though. Rates are reasonable and staff is alright. Clean and bustle-free, this place is your saviour if you have a low budget but want to have decent food.

It's a nice place to have Dosas at. The ambience is not bad. We ordered Idli, Uttapum, Chicken Cheese Dosa, Schezwan Cheese Dosa, Chocolate Dosa and two cream bell ice creams. The Uttapum and the Chicken Cheese Dosa were really scrumptious. I didn't quite like the Schezwan Dosa and the Chocolate Dosa tasted very weird. It was not that good. And the cutneys they served were okayish. But the sambar wasn't all that good. But the Chicken Cheese Dosa was so good in itself that the taste of the chutneys or the sambar didn't matter. I was told they don't include GST and they prices are very reasonable. I will visit this little place again for sure for their amazing chicken Dosas.

Had an awful experience here a short while ago.
My grandmother was spoken to extremely rudely by the owner/woman in charge for asking whether separate utensils were used for veg and non veg items.
The onion masala dosa was good, but the mutton in the mutton egg dosa was very undercooked. Despite all of it being left uneaten, the waiter and the woman mentioned above rudely refused to accept the possibility that the mutton wasn't flawless, saying no one else had complained today.
I saw a large cockroach scurry next to the door, there was a spider-web on the bathroom sink (spider included) and the "soap" in the soap dispensers was about 95% water.
Shockingly, these might all be relatively minor offences because 2 out of the 3 waiters looked nowhere near 18. I can't confirm their ages but I hope I'm wrong.
On the plus side, they serve 3 types of chutney. Nice.

Loved the twisted dosas! Chicken cheese masala dosa was fantastic!! Generous amount of stuffing of chicken,which is quite heavy for a single person. The concept of having non veg dosa was very new to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The veg dosa ( schezwan cheese masala) too was tasty enough. The quality of the coffee was quite good. Service was pretty quick, staff were cordial. Highly recommended food joint for all the food lovers üëç

This place is great!! The boy that was serving us was very diligent and attentive. Even though he couldn't have been older than 10 years old!! Like the inventiveness of the menu really good inviting options. The decor is a mismatch of things but it won't change my rating for the better or worse. The taste is where I did have a problem. I had a chicken dosa. Was a bit disappointed to have it been keema instead of actual pieces or even shredded chicken.
The dosa itself was made well but the overall taste wasn't to my liking. The sambar i didn't like but that could just be because I'm not a fan of sambars. Loved the other chutneys. I would definitely visit this place again.

OMG! Never expected the tastiest Dhosa ever in Kolkata. It is very small cafe so had to struggle a lot to get a table, more pathetic was the wait time. But when we got our order, we were flattered. Much say they make awesome dosa. Will try their all flavours for sure. Only one suggestion, please reduce the wait time and maintain the quality as I just had. :)

Dropped here last week for lunch. Since we were looking for a South Indian lunch around lake mall,first we went to Banana Leaf but the waiting que was so long,I searched for an alternative in zomato and it lead me to this place.

It's a small restaurant at Sarat Bose Road. We were the only people in the restaurant when we entered, but gradually few more guests stepped in there. They have a long list of different kinds of dosa with e twist. We had ordered Mysore Masala Dosa and Pizza Dosa. They didn't take much time and served the Mysore Dosa first. Their presentation is quite good and the taste of the dosa along with 3 different chatneys and sambar was really good. Then came the Pizza Dosa. It looks exactly like a pizza and they use Dosa batter instead of bread in it, topped with mushrooms and olives. The aroma and taste is exactly of a pizza.

The food was good and price is also‚Äã very reasonable. The only thing which was missing is their hospitality. The owner is a middle aged lady who doesn't know how to behave and how to talk in presence of guests.

Yaa this restaurant definitely comes with dosa that has got lots of twists!!!! I have never found so many varieties of dosas anywhere else in Kolkata. We tasted the chicken cheese babycorn dosa and it was yummmm!!! May sound a bit odd, that how can dosa be a non veg one! But do try out this small restaurant at Deshopriyo Park which serves tasty dosas with 3 kinds of chutneys along with sambar!!

This restaurant is a must visit place for all dosa lovers out there. They serve a large variety of dosas. I have tried Chicken Babycorn Masala Dosa , Chicken Pizza Dosa and Chocolate Dosa . All of them were amazing. The dosas are served with three types of chutney - coconut , pudina and carrot. Quantity is sufficient. Moderate service. Budget friendly place.

After being exhausted and hungry, suddenly I found this place and It was completely new at that time.. After going through their menu I was surprised by their prices of foods and variety of dosas. I had masala dosa.. And again I visited this place few months ago and tried chicken dosa and Manchurian dosa. I can't explain in words how amazing those dishes were. They serve one of the best south Indian food (especially dosa) at such an amazing low price in Kolkata. The ambience of the restaurant and their service is also commendable. I would suggest everyone to visit this place as I do normally and of course I would love to visit this place again and again to enjoy their amazing food and service.

Excellent! Is what sums up the food taste and quality. Non veg dosas and idlis are uncommon in Kolkata, thought not so in south and Maharastra, hence a new flavour. The idli n Chicken curry though simple yet stands out and has certainly become one of my favourite. However, it will nice if they do something about the entrance to the joint.

as everyone said it is right beside zeeshan.. excellent location for a restaurant. we had tried chicken masala dosa and chicken pizza dosa.
the chicken masala dosa was mind blowing.. this was the 1st time i tasted non-veg dosa..
but the pizza dosa was total disappointment. it was completely disaster..
u can definitely go once and check for some regular dosa with a twist..

The ambience is quiet here. Food is clean and well cooked. To add to that, it's delicious.

Try the pizza dosas as they are wonderful! We had an item called  'Idli chauka', which was something new for us . If you are a chocolate freak , do go for a Chocolate dosa for dessert which is served hot with a cup of vanila ice cream that makes the combo worth it.

It's a nice place for snacks.

I would have given a higher rating, had there been a better and cleaner ambience when we visited the place unlike the claustrophobic feeling we encountered.
We ordered a Mutton Pizza dosa and a Chocolate dosa.
The latter was lovely and really tasted well. As for the pizza dosa I liked the concept, but the taste didn't last long on the tastebuds.
The service is so-so. The restro needs a more hygienic aura given its popularity.

Competitively priced menu is hall mark of this south Indian eatery. Situated near Deshapriya Park crossing the entrance has Lucknow's Bada Imambara kind of feel. But once you managed to sneak in. The choice of Dosas will astonish you. Schezwan ,Rava, Corn. You name every variety they have it. Fried idli is a must try here. Interiors can be worked upon. Service is prompt.
Food- 5.0/5

A pocket friendly restaurant with excellent and unique food.  I mean, have you ever even heard of non-veg dosa?  The name itself drags you to have a bite of it. The ambiance isn't very good, its casual. We had mushroom cheese masala dosa along with egg masala dosa and both were yumm üòã.  If you are looking for a pocket friendly, yet excellent food near deshapriyo park, do go for dosa@twist.

This was my second trip to the outlet. The first one was very hectic, so writing a review on the 2nd time. We ordered Cheese Onion Butter Masala Dosa and the famous Chicken Pizza Dosa. The pizza dosa is unique and looks beautiful. Its tastes good too. The onion dosa is quite same as other outlates. Service, can be improved. They should take cards too. Expectation is more from this outlet with a twist.

It was a very bad food experience. I went to this place after watching a lots of recommendations. But it could not satisfy my taste bud at all. I had the pizza dosa. It had a so so taste , though the crunchiness was there but was very little and was missing the punch. The vada I ordered was a big 0. Not even a pinch of salt and the chutneys were no where near its original tastes. Though one thing at last was a delight and a thing which was not in the menu, was the choclate dosa. It was a experiment hitting the mark. With icecream it has a nyc ring to it. Only th last dish dragged the rating to 3.5. Otherwise its a no go for me atleast.

This tiny place is located near deshapriya park . Took cheese mutton dosa and chocolate dosa. Both of them were very good. Mutton dosa had generous amount of mutton keema in it with cheese. It came with three types of chutneys one was coconut chutney, one was Pudina and the other one was orange coloured which I couldn't recognize. Chocolate dosa was also very good which was served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. But the dosas are really smallüòû compared to the price charged. I think the place is slightly overpriced but tastewise it's a thumbs up.

SCHEZWAN CHEESE BUTTER DOSA-- it was too yummy.i. hv had such an awsm one for the first time.the coating was very thin & crispy.stuffing was well cooked,buttery as well as chessy..last but not the least it was served with two types of chatni along with the normal samber nd chatni..that was unique
2. CHICKEN PIZZA DOSA--dosa & pizza..a great twisting it was..i have tasted it for the very first time.it was too yummy loaded with cheesy chicken topping.one is more than enough for an individual.
3. CHOCOLATE DOSA-- One may try it as a desert.dosa in crispy choco wrap with choco chips.served with ice cream..
Altogether nice place.was totally satisfy.would like to visit the place again.

 But they offer great food at decent price. 
Quite a place to hang out with your family or friends and enjoy dosa.
Ordered chicken cheese dosa, and it was an absolute delicacy. 
Though the service was a bit slow, but again I was never in a hurry. Courteous staff. 
Looking forward to try something else soon :)

Ever heard the words 'Twist of Fate'?... 
Well 'Dosa@Twist' gonna swap the 'Twist' to 'Luck' in no time. Let me clear to everyone in quite simple way; "Try this or you're making a Big Mistake Amigos". We stuffed ourselves with 'Egg Chicken Cheese Mushroom Dosa','Pizza Dosa' & 'Chocolate Dosa'. Yes chocolate lovers, I've given you another reference to be bloomed with chocolates once again. Crunchy Chocolate Dosa and a 'Vanilla Dip'. It's a Blast of flavours. Although the soft mushrooms carved with cheese will be a more than a pleasant delicacy and the 'Pizza Dosa' was one fine crafting you should try out. Its more like thin crust pizza but you'll be much surprised figuring out 'Dosa' being 'Pizza'. Try once and I'm sure that twist of taste will really gonna make you happy!

Dosa twist. Seriously they know how to make this boring dish so teasty and innovative , I personally like dosa , but we generally know masala dosa or rawa dosa , which is mainly available every wear , 

But dosa twist will definitely change your thoughts regarding South Indian food , 

Tried their Chicken cheese dosa and chocolate dosa both are just out of the world , 

Price also very reasonable

Decent experience @ Dosa @ Twist.¬†
=====
Intro & Location:

It is located right beside Zeeshan, Deshpriya Park. To be more precise, near maharani kachori, salam namaste and biriyani company eating joints. It was previously paparazzi, a dingy hookah parlour which have been converted into a small and cozy eating joint.

I had been here with three of my friends day before yesterday. Ambiance is just fine here. Nothing fancy with paintings of Monalisa and other artistic works. It does not have a large seating arrangement but sufficient enough for 16-20 people. (4-5 tables) We ordered different varieties of Dosa.
=====
What i ordered:

Rava Masala Dosa - As we were three, we ordered three different dosas. One of my friend ordered the babycorn masala dosa, another manchurian and i, rava masala dosa. The babycorn masala had more of american corn. The manchurian one tasted average to my friend. The rava which i had was nice. However, it was stuffed with masala and lot of oil. It was served with sambar, green chutney, onion chutney and normal coconut chutney. I found it decent enough to fill stomach and was very reasonably priced too. They took a lot of time to make the dosa's which does not usually should happen.¬†
=====

Pros:

‚Ä¢ Pocket friendly.  

‚Ä¢ Ambiance is fine.¬†

‚Ä¢ Good food quantity at affordable prices.

‚Ä¢ Dosa is their niche. They make chicken and mutton dosa's too which i might try the next time i go here.¬†

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Food Quality is a bit compromised. 
=====
Meal for two: 200-400 approximate (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc)

Summary:

Food Quality 3.4/5

Food Quantity 3.7/5

Taste 3.7/5

Presentation 3.4/5

Hygiene 3.4/5

VFM 3.5/5
=====
Conclusion:

They make so many varieties of dosa's. I want to try the non vegetarian ones so i might come back here to give it a try. I liked the sambhar and onion chutney but i feel if it's more thick, it would be much much better.¬†

As the name aptly suggests, their dosas are prepared with a twist indeed. The chances are you might have missed this place due to the location. This is one tiny joint sandwiched right in between Zeeshan and Royal Lebanese at Deshapriya Park, opposite to the Deshapriya Park Petrol Pump. 
A friend of mine had suggested this place some time back and this weekend was the perfect opportunity to try it out. After a long and very confusing go through with the menu card we decided to order a Mutton Cheese Dosa and a Mushroom Masala Cheese Dosa because of our obsession with cheese.

This wasnt the first time i was trying out a non veg dosa as i had visited the now closed Madras Tiffin House located on the Prince Anwar Shah Connector. So comparison definitely kicked in. And i should say Dosa@Twist fared quite well. They were quite generous with the cheese and the quantity and quality went hand in hand. The mutton was in the form of keema as against the expected mutton cubes. But not only was it well done but also the molten cheese made its way through the mutton and dosa batter thereby making it an oh-so-foodgasmic experience. My advice to anyone visiting this place would be to try this particular item. 
The mushroom masala cheese dosa was also good especially due to the mushroom masala stuffing and molten cheese mixture.
The only con about the food is that we found the dosas to be a bit oily. But that wont stop us from visiting this place again.

Went to this much talked-about dosa joint today in the afternoon and really jumped down to review an amazing experience there...
Firstly it's just beside Zeeshan opposite deshapriya park and it's very easy to locate.. as you enter you would see two stray dogs being pet by the owner which was kind of awesome since I have four stray dogs as my pets.. really touching to see so much effort was being put to take care of them.. all buckled up and clean...
Then the food.. omg!!! I really don't know where to start from?! We ordered 1.chicken cheese masala dosa, 2.mixed pizza dosa and 3.neer dosa with chicken curry...
I just loved the twist added to each.. the filling of chicken cheese masala dosa was so fresh n tasty..
The mixed pizza dosa was better than Pizza Hut pizza.. seriously.. the topping had mutton & chicken Keema with vegetables,olives and a lot of cheese... Just amazing.. a must try
Our tummy was pretty full after these two,but not our heart..so ordered neer dosa with chicken curry.. oh man!! A south Indian styled chicken curry not much spicy was so much good.. I was sipping the broth the chicken curry till the last drop..
Will have to go back.. cz I missed the chocolate dosa.. so see I will have to go..no choice!!! Or may be I have no other choice when it comes to dosa!!!
Loved the concept,loved the food!
Sorry can't enclose pics, cz we ate up all! ;)

The mixed pizza dosa was better than Pizza Hut pizza.. seriously.. the topping had mutton & chicken Keema with vegetables,olives and a lot of cheese... Just amazing.. a must try
Our tummy was pretty full after these two,but not our heart..so ordered neer dosa with chicken curry.. oh man!! A south Indian styled chicken curry not much spicy was so much good.. I was sipping the broth the chicken curry till the last drop..
Will have to go back.. cz I missed the chocolate dosa.. so see I will have to go..no choice!!! Or may be I have no other choice when it comes to dosa!!!
Loved the concept,loved the food!
Sorry can't enclose pics, cz we ate up all! ;)

The approach may be terrible and the space small, but don't let that discourage you - the food here is excellent, and absolutely value for money. I'll definitely be going back for the Chocolate Dosa some time. That sounded terrible on paper, but the dish itself tasted fabulous!

Authentic South Indian joint near Deshapriya Park. Only problem was to locate the place. Budget dishes is the hallmark of the place. The range of Dosas is amazing. Service and interiors is the area which needs improvement. Otherwise a healthy getaway for shoppers and Hoppers around Gariahat.

We visited here after reading reviews,¬† in search of non traditional dosas, I mean good fusion dosas. Service was very slow. Ambience is OK with AC room. We ordered Pizza Dosa and Chinese Dosa. All preperations were not upto the expectations..There was no taste in the crust of dosas..even chutneys and sambher were not at all tastefull. If you ever had good dosa any time in your life..this place is not for u...

If you're a "foodie", you just CAN'T AFFORD to miss this place...
Nothing to talk about the ambience.Considerably cheap(no tax charged)... service is decent and reasonably quick.But the food is just yummalicious, specially for South Indian lovers !!
We ordered 3 dishes -

Mixed(non-veg) Pizza Dosa - Similar to a normal pizza, it's base being mainly the dosa part,simply a delight for all food lovers !! Loaded with chicken & mutton as well as cheeze,it's worth every penny of yours !!

Chicken Masala Dosa - Expected a lot from this but it didn't turn out to be that good. The proportion of masala and chicken wasn't quite correct but yes, all the 3 chutneys were delicious.. (probably simply chicken dosa would have been a better choice).

CHOCOLATE DOSA - This was the showstopper for me. Not mentioned in the menu(Rs.120), it's crunchy, not too chocolaty but goes well the scoop of vanilla ice-cream served with it..Has those butter scotch nuts too..something really unique and a delight for your taste buds.
0.5 points deducted for the unclean entrance...Though a little shady, it's definitely worth a visit provided food is your main priority !!

I visited this place today and to my suprise the lady sitting in the counter was so rude. We ordered for mushroom babycorn masala butter dosa and they gave us mushroom dosa and later when we denied to accept the order they were furious. The lady said to the other staff the next time they visit us please throw them out. This is no way acceptable. 
I am sitting here with my order and repenting.

Saw the ratings on zomato and decided to order from this joint...It was A big disappointment in terms of quantity,quality and packaging.

The sambhar was watery and tasteless and the dosas were just average.
Quantity of the sambhar and chutneys was not sufficient enough.
Moreover they charge 30 rs extra for packaging and send their food in polythene packets which is so cheap.
It felt as if i ordered from a road side stall and not a restaurant

I tried mixed pizza dosa.. and tasted the chicken cheese dosa and mutton dosa.. I personally liked the mutton dosa that was delicious followed by chicken cheese one.. but somehow I didn't like the pizza dosa..  the base of the pizza dosa was more like uttapam.. I had pizza dosa earlier in Delhi that was quite different and was more tasty. Over all it's good place to try.   And best thing about the owner is they help and rescue dogs. So next time you visit don't forget to contribute a little amount for the betterment of helpless animalsüòäüòä

First of all, I am a great south indian lover. But I am also a chicken lover. But sadly you wont get this combination together everywhere. 
But the good news is, this place have it! This place has the most of awesome dosas for all the non-veg lovers. 
The Egg-Chicken Dosa was very good. 
Though the place is a small one, just visit it for the food.

Tucked in the parallel joints of deshapriya park like zeeshan & royal lebanese, this was the place which earlier hosted paparazzi but now it transformed itself into this south indian delight, what a TWIST!
The front entrance will not please you as much as the interior will. A small joint having 4-5 tables limited decor, trying to win hearts from their dishes. We settled for,
‚ñ´Ô∏èSchezwan Cheese Masala Dosa: one of the finest dosa i have ever tasted, proper amount of filling with crispy wrapping outside. Surprising to see they serve 3types of chutneys with sambar. Highly Recommended.
‚ñ´Ô∏èDahi Vara: two full sized vara served in a full plate of curd topped with tamarind sauce & bhujiya. Generous amount of curd served to fill your tummy.
Pocket pinch is also very minimal. With not so many south indian options in that location it will be the favourite place.
Points cut for tidiness in the front entrance.
P.S. They even serve non-veg & chocolate dosa also, now that's a TWIST!

As in Bengalis refrain from south indian dishes but to all those shirking from dosa and idli , guys its my earnest entreaty to gibe this place a visit! The food quality, quantity , service and the decor well they are all really appreciable to a great extent! We ordered mutton pizza dosa, chicken cheese dosa and their famous chocolate dosa! They are all as i mentioned would give you a literal food-gasm! All in all its the best place to change your notion about south indian dishes! üòá

It can be easily located near lake market area. The decor is quite simple and space is little. Apart from this the quality and price of the food is awesome (no vat charges). We have ordered onion masala dosa, chicken dosa, chocolate dosa and ice creams. The quality of dosa was 5/5(chicken was fresh, dosas were crispy).The total bill was only rupees 385. It's an unique concept of dosas in Kolkata (5/5 to the new concept).

First visit: I went there with friends.We were on a hurry so we only had the chicken pizza dosa and it was sooooooooooo good (cheeesy and sexy and soft chewy and had generous chicken toppings) and really cheap too.
rs 120

Second visit : the two of us,had the Schezwan chicken cheese dosa and it was wow.Just blew our mind.And also the three chaats/dips it was served with, individually,tasted perfect.They asked us if we wanted sambar and chutney with that,we aksed for sambar and it's probably the best sambar we tasted in town,as well.One dosa was filling for the both of us as an evening snack.
.rs160

ASK FOR THE OLD MENU FROM THEM AS WELL,THE ITEMS ARE STILL AVAILABLE FROM OLD MENU,BUT THEY GIVE YOU ONLY THE NEW MENU,UNLESS ASKED.

Tiny little pretty place, you'll miss if you don't pay attention while you walk...It's right beside this place called Zeeshan that serves rolls and kebabs.
( 0.5 deducted only because it's still difficult to find and is like a hidden gem,but then again,that just increases its appeal all the more!!)

It's located just beside Zeshan near Desapriya Park..I really liked the innovative concept of serving dosas with a twist.So many varieties of items are there..We ordered Paneer masala dosa and pizza dosa..Pizza dosa looked amazing-exactly like pizza with loads of cheese olive mushroom in one word "fabulous"..Paneer masala dosa was also excellent which was served with sambar,coconut chutney,corriander chutney and another spicy chutney..A pocket friendly joint with cozy ambience and good service..Definetly will visit here soon..

Dosa@Twist, absolutely justifies its title. If u want some pocket friendly south indian dishes or even fusion south indian dishes, then this is the place.

Devouring ourselves in various cuisines all this while, we thought of trying something healthy..
So, we visited this eatery yesterday..
This place is located in sarat bose road, a few steps ahead of the Sarat bose road post office..

The interior is quite simple, nothing extraordinary though..
But i was really excited for the food.
We ordered
1) CHICKEN CHEESE DOSA
2) CHICKEN PIZZA DOSA

Both of these dishes were much raved by my foodie friends so i thought to try them out.
Really liked the chicken dosa..
There were ample amount of ingredients in it and the dosa was very light and crispy.
Now, coming to the pizza dosa.
I had high expectations from this dish.
Probably it was not their day. 
It was okayish, but was topped with generous amount of chicken, cheese and veggies.
Being a pizza maniac, i quite didnt like the dosa base. It was not even a lil bit crunchy and went all soggy.
Tastewise it was ok, not that bad but could have been way better..

The bill was 290 bucks, which was great. They don't charge any tax, making this restaurant quite pocket friendly..
Well, they have a lot of dosa options here, which sound mouth watering..
What i didn't like about this place was they don't have any drinks apart from cold drinks. I wish they had some drink options too to beat the heat.
Otherwise i had a good experience and would recommend this place for their variety of dosas.

Flanked by Zeeshan and Royal Lebanese, Dosa Twist is a pocket-friendly restaurant located near Deshapriya Park. We ordered Chicken Baby corn Masala Dosa, Chicken Pizza Dosa and Chocolate Dosa.
Chicken Baby corn Masala Dosa was perfect with delicious stuffing and the Chicken Pizza Dosa had substantial amount of assorted toppings like Mushrooms, Baby Corns, Cheese and obviously, tiny Chicken pieces! The crunchy Chocolate Dosa with Vanilla ice cream dip(not mentioned in the menu, cost us ‚Çπ120), however, did taste a little tangy, but overall it was worth every penny. Considering the unconventional Dosa varieties that we get here, the name of this restaurant is a befitting one!

Even though from outside the place is bit shabby, but inside it is well decorated with paintings, wall hangings etc and unexpectedly it has AC as well. Staffs are friendly and well behaved and the service is quite fast.

Now coming to the food part, it was a rainy evening, me and my friend decided to visit the place after seeing their unique menu and high rating on zomato, and have to say we are not disappointed with the decision. We ordered Chicken Cheese Dosa, Chicken Pizza Dosa and Chocolate Dosa.

Chicken Cheese Dosa : Though the quality of cheese in the dosa could have been better but still it was delicious and quality and taste is actually better than what I expected. The staffing was full of chicken, with a tangy flavour from the tomato. It was served with sambar and 2 kinds of chutneys.

Chicken Pizza Dosa : South Indian and Italian, what a perfect fusion of two different types of food. Pizza dosa was full of different toppings from olive to babycorn and others and ample amount of cheese to make you go wow if your are a cheese lover like me.

Chocolate Dosa : Without any doubt this was the best part of the visit. As the name suggests, chocolate dosa was full of chocolate. It was hot and filled with melted chocolate, choco chips, nuts inside and ice cream to accompany it - in short, Heaven.

For taking a break from Mughlai and North Indian food we thought of trying out some good South Indian food last weekend. Was browsing through Zomato for some good places and came across this one which had pretty decent reviews and pretty good number of items on the menu. So finally gave a visit to the place. The decor is pretty simple and the waiters were quite well behaved. We took cheese onion uttapam and upma. Both the dishes were very good I must say, especially the uttapam. The cheese on the top made it so awesome that it could give the ever loving cheese burst pizza a good competition. A big thumbs up from our side and definitely looking forward to visit again.

Thumbs Up : You'll be amazed how great this place is ! Just go !

Thumbs Down : The service is a bit slow. However, considering how amazing the food is and the consistency that they maintain, all can be forgiven. :D

-> Chicken Dosa ¬†- I've never been a fan of Dosa but this place made me question myself with this preparation. This dosa was jam packed with delicious topping and the flavours were perfect.

-> Chocolate Utthapam - The utthapam is perfect, the hot molten chocolate is delicious and the chips on top just melts in your mouth. Foodgasm !

-> Chocolate Dosa - This is a recent addition to their menu, they suggested that I give it a try and I was amazed ! The Dosa was chocolaty and crunchy and every bit amazing.

This restaurant is one of my new favourites, primarily because of their innovations! Their non veg dosas are a delight, and I've loved their Chicken Dosa, Mutton Dosa and their Chicken Pizza Dosa! I look forward to trying their Neer Dosa with Mutton Curry, as I love anything with Neer Dosa. The only complaint (sort of) could be that their restaurant is rather small and thus you might not get adequate seating at times, but that's hardly a cause for much complaint.

This place is located just beside zeeshan at desopriyo park. The entrance is that of a house and the space of the sitting area is fair. What I loved about this place is it's food. I was a little hesitant at first but my friends proposed to go to this place. I just agreed cause it had non veg and i wanted to see how they brought a twist in the typical vegetarian south Indian dish. My visit was worth it as they did justice to the food and prompt service to satisfy my hunger. We ordered the following:
Mutton dosa: the mutton keema inside was sufficient in quantity and good to taste.
Chicken cheese dosa: I loved it. The proportion was perfect and so was the quantity.
Chicken Keema Pao: it tasted to me like Pao bhaji with chicken cause of the typical taste and smell of corriender leaves but that is what a keema Pao is expected to be.
Chocolate dosa: it was again very delicious. Served with vanilla ice cream the chocolate dosa was a perfect desert.
The best part of the food was inspite of being dosa based it didn't have the common tangy taste. This made it so great to taste with the non vegetarian twist.
The staff was poliete and their service was quick. 
I would surely visit this cozy food joint again.

I was not aware of this place before. It is a sudden a visit just based on the zomato review. And truly the food has met all my expectations. They serves some South Indian dishes with various combinations. Today we have ordered egg mutton dosa and paneer masala. Both the preparations are delicious and finger licking.. like to visit this place again to have some other tasty dishes.

They have reinvented the Dosa and the Idli in the most unique way imaginable. These two age old South Indian favourites would probably get up and give their twist a standing ovation. I just loved their Button Idli in Mutton Curry and the Egg Mutton Cheese Masala Dosa. The sambhar and the chutnies provided along with the mains were awesome. The other item we had ordered was the Mushroom Cheese Butter Masala Dosa, and this too was at par with the rest. 
Really intrigued by the twists and turns on this foodie journey and planning to be back on this 'Twisty Trip' again. The other items are surely on my waiting list now.

This one really has a twist. First of all it is really difficult to understand that an AC restaurant really exists inside the dingy alley past the narrow frontend!
But once you manage to venture inside braving the dinginess and hot air emanating out of ovens you r in for the Twist‚Äã!
It is a small cosy joint with frugal decor but a frantic atmosphere. The lady in charge looks flabbergasted but is vigilant of everything and manages everything efficiently. After we have settled down we ordered paneer cheese onion butter masala dosa, cheese onion masala dosa and the twisty chicken mushroom cheese dosa. With loads of mozarella it was all twisty and stringy. Accompanying chutnies and sambhar was classical though...Especially the sambhar was classical udupi style..Sweet and tangy with fresh flavors of coriander. 
Very tasty and affordable....A popular place for the genX....

This place is located right next to the Zeeshan,Deshapriya park outlet.Well to be honest am not much of a South Indian food lover but I absolutely loved this place, solely for the good.It's a small place which can accomodate 15 - 20 people max.We tried Chicken Cheese Dosa,Chicken Butter Dosa and Keema Pao,each of these tastes good.You should definitely give this place a try if you are bored of the conventional south Indian food.

This place is a hidden gem. Once found, it welcomes you with a nice and cosy ambience and a bit of homely warmth. We ordered the chicken dosa pizza which had a nice and yummy crust with generous, tender bits of chicken. The mutton keema Pav was good. Though the bread was a tad too oily for me but the Keema was as it should be; had the right flavours. The highlight of the night was the chocolate dosa which left me want to come back again and have just that. At first glance it seemed too much but proved to be surprisingly light.

Overall nice ambience and service. Not costly at all and completely worth it! Looking forward to my next visit.

I have heard about this place alot from my friends and went to try out their creative dishes.
This restaurant is beside Go Lebanese at Sarat Bose Road and Gariahat Road junction. The place is shabby which turned down my mood a bit. I believe good food must be hygenic also which I think totally lacked here.
The restaurant is really small and you will get a homely feeling. Now coming to food we wanted to try out their innovative dishes so ordered Chicken Pizza Dosa. 
Well visually it really looks good but when you give a bite to that pizza most of the things will taste stale. The cheese thrown in ample quantity tasted like thread and the dish was way too sour. So, we did not ordered anything more and went away half heartedly without completing the full plate of the food.
Moroever, a dissapointing experience.

Visited this afternoon with two of my friends. Located just beside zeeshan near deshapriya park. The place though looks quite shabby from the outside but is decent enough from the inside but cannot accommodate many. Coming to the food, they were delicious. Ordered chicken pizza dosa n chicken cheese dosa. Both of them were very tasty with generous amount of filling served with different kinds of chutneys n sauces. Loved the fusion of dosas served. Would definitely visit again.

This one has been in my target list for a long time and finally‚Äã went there yesterday! Well it's neither south Indian nor Italian or Indian, it's Twisted!! Located near the Deshapriya park crossing.
The fusion has been executed excellently‚Äã in every dish.
As per zomato reviews, we ordered Chicken Pizza dosa, Mutton Keema Pao and Chicken Aachari Dosa.

Chicken Aachari Dosa was the best - Dosa with a filling of chicken cooked with spicy pickle and that being served with chatni and dip was heaven!!! The crispness of  dosa is retained.

Mutton Keema Pao was just too good! We kept on licking fingers !
And the pizza dosa was so unique ,with chicken, mushroom,olive and baby corn topping!!! Yummmm!

Service is quite prompt! A small, tastefully decorated cafe! Best part is this place is absolutely pocket friendly!

In both veg and non veg. I tried chicken masala Dosa and mushroom masala Dosa and both of them were mind blowing! Not only the Dosa but a south Indian restaurant is graded by its sambhar and chutney! Everything here was good. The waiters were also well behaved! I would definitely come here again for trying more.

Dosa...This one item, which reminds us of the stereotype south Indian cuisine with a same old potato filling, served with sambar and chutney.

But, this notion surely changes when you first enter this small food joint!

Located near Lake Mall, it's very easy to locate...Though the exterior look of the place won't be very appealing, but the food is worth it. It's a small place with about 30 seats, and decent interior.

From a wide variety of exotic dosa, they also make non-veg dosa. Yes! You heard me right! :D

We were five people, so we ordered 3 veg pizza dosa, 1 chicken pizza dosa and 1 chicken cheese babycorn dosa. And it was just fabulous!
The stuffing of the chicken dosa was very filling which came along with regular chutney, ketchup and a mint chutney.
The pizza dosa were, however, the main attraction of our luncheon.. the toppings were a lot more than those clich√© pizzerias like Domino's.. and it tasted just like a normal pizza, but the twist being, the spectacular layer of dosa instead of the pizza bread.. Complimented the toppings completely!

And the best part? Prices are pocket friendly with no tax :P

I'll surely pay my second visit :)Kausambi Biswas Sangeeta Ghosh Vedasree Talukdar

Truely what a twist to the humble dosa.Not only the varieties available of dosa and Idli, even the quient essential sambar taste so unique and fantastic.
Ordered for three Egg Schezwan Masala dosa and it tasted unique, and very tasty. 
This is a small outlet with minimal interiors or panash in service, but they are in no ways minimal in terms of variety , uniqueness in quality, and taste . That's why this twist to dosa is such a hit among foodies.

The name says it all....Here the dosas are different from the ones served at the other south Indian food joints. Everywhere else you get Veg dosas, uttapams and idlis, here you can get chicken and mutton dosas and even uttapams. A very small and basic place with a few wrought iron chairs and wooden tables. The decor is minimal with a few big pictures on the walls.The service is reasonably fast especially so because there seems to be only one person for service. The butter egg dosa was good and the Chutneys too were excellent. The sambaar was also tasty. My friends had the chicken dosa and they praised it. The prices too are reasonable.

The name says all !
Indeed you will get happy twists with your order.
The neer dosa was so delicious. It had shredded chicken pieces and plain sada dosa 3pcs.
The egg masala dosa had omlette stuck to the covering with aloo stuffing.
Nice ambiance. Good food. Pocket friendly.

Well looks can be a bit deceiving from the outside but they have a decent sitting space inside. Located opposite to the deshapriya park this place was on my bookmark list for long. And it perfectly stood up to my expectations.
          We had ordered the infamous chicken pizza dosa , babycorn cheese masala dosa and keema pav.  Just as the name suggests the pizza dosa was one of a kind. With a crispy dosa crust and usual pizza toppings along with chicken keema, it was absolutely lip smacking. The masala dosa was crispy with the right amount of cheese . We were really skeptical regarding the keema pav but it turned out to be the best of the evening. Delectable keema in apt quantity but they serve two pavs along with it so I suggest you order two extra pavs.
            This place has strengthened my faith in experimenting new dishes. Will definitely visit again.

One of the good south Indian restaurant in town. They are innovative. Good quality food. But service is not prompt. You have to wait for a while. The taste inclined towards the eastern part of south India. The place is small, but the ambience and lighting wont let you down. 

On our Second visit We ordered Pizza Dosa, Neer Dosa With chicken curry And Cheese chicken Dosa. Every thing was fantastic. Specially the Cheese chicken dosa. It was really cheese and the newness in pizzaa dosa. Only thing we didn't like the chicken Curry which was served with neer dosa. It was a bit Salty. First time we thought it was kinda mistake but both the time it was the same salty.

Loved the dosa here.. It was very different from the regular fare .. The variety n innovation was just what we had been looking for... I had the cheese butter plain dosa.. Mixed non veg pizza dosa and paneer butter masala dosa... And every one of them was just finger licking good... And this place beats banana leaf in variety, taste, and quality... Will step back here again for more...

It's located in sarat bose road exactly opposite side of deshapriya park. Its a small outlet..having less space beside zeeshan. We ordered one egg cheese masala dosa,one chicken pizza dosa,one chocolate dosa. Cheese dosa was served with 4 chatney and a sambar. It was really tasty. The cicken pizza dosa was very large and different in taste. The Chocolate dosa was also tasty and crispy.

Dosa twist is a perfect definition of a hidden gem . It's a shame that I had kept it in my bookmark list for such a long time . So, when the opportunity came I grabbed with both hands and finally had a meal here . Frankly , there were some negatives in the overall experience , but the food was simply something . Something that not only overpowers many South Indian joints in price but also innovation and taste . For non-veg lovers there is finally a cheap South Indian restaurant that's high on innovation and taste . Finally , after such a long time it felt good experimenting .

¬∞ Location :- Okay , so this lies on the stretch of sarat Bose road that falls in the rashbehari avenue and stretches to southern avenue . The place is located between zeeshan and Salam namaste , it has a tiny nameplate so very easy to get missed.  

¬∞ Service & Ambience ( 3 / 5 ) :-  Not really much dazzle in the decor because the joint is low on maintenance and staff . I think there are more people in the kitchen than in the interior . The walls are not the most attractive and the wrought iron furniture doesn't much add any glamor but all of these are justified enough for a proper meal . The service is not top notch either . The first serving took a lot of time and we were almost impatient but the food saved the day . Given the quantity of people around the restaurant I seriously don't have any suggestions . Just keep the quality of food intact , anything on top of that is simply cherry on the top 

---------------------------------

FOOD :-  Let's start taking about the part where they really excel . Firstly , the menu was huge and it was really tough finding out the best of them all but we managed to sort out 3 terrific items which I will go into :- 

1. Button idli in mutton Curry ( 5 / 5 ) :- I simply don't know why this dish is not spoken out loud . This should be one of the legendary items of the city . And this is me crying out loud that this dish is simply "out of the world " . The gravy is between a spin-off between a mangshor jhol and a broth . There are enough button idlis and they go just find with the medium spicy meat broth . And there are 4 pieces of small mutton pieces which are so good that you will thank the chef for making this dish . The meat is so soft that you can chew the bones easily . The first time I saw this dish I felt like having it with appam but trust me just a spoon is enough . You will go crazy and if you are missing out on this dish then you are truly missing something .

2. Chicken pizza dosa ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Another gem of an item . So much has been spoken about this in the reviews that I just had to order it . And it was absolutely classic . Most broadly can be explained as a thin crust pizza and here the thin crust is the dosa . And the topping is something that truly makes it worth having . An excess amount of chicken keema, cheese , mushrooms form the heart of the masala that acts as the topping and trust me it tastes so good . A must must order for me and I will suggest for the meat enthusiasts to go for the mutton counterpart as that keema is more tasty . A highly recommended item .

3. Egg schezwan cheese butter masala dosa ( 4 / 5 ) :- Did you read how many items were there before the actual word dosa !! Sounds insane but it was rather simple and to the point . The dosa had a regular potato masala in it which is tasty . And the main dosa was crisp , layered with egg while cheese was inside the dosa so that once you pull a thin layer of dosa out the cheese will start coming from.the inside.  Frankly it was an awesome experience . Not a big dissatisfied expert but to me the texture was good enough to make it a good dosa . The 4 types of dips namely sambhar , coconut chutney , tomatoes chutney and pudina made the dosa more convenient to eat . The sambhar was not like usual south Indian restaurants and I liked the taste . But there was very less schezwan in it which was a little dissapointing but still it's a good dosa . Highly recommended once again .

We were literally full after having these items and had to drown them with Coke . 3 items are more than sufficient for 2 hungry foodies .

------------------------------------------------

¬∞ VERDICT :-  A big yes and truly deserves to be in the hidden gems category . This joint is truly a gem and a place worth multiple visits . Following are the main points:- 

1. Chicken pizza dosa and idli in mutton Curry are 2 must must have items .
2. Innovative and tasty food that does not burn a hole in the pocket .
3. Cheese cheese everywhere.
4. No taxes .

Places like this sometimes remind us how overpriced other joints are really . Such a wholesome and hearty meal at under 500 rupees makes you wonder why all restaurants are hidden gems . But that's the trade-off for no ambience and less service.  Anyways , a stunning place to visit and do it if you have not already .

I went to dosa@twist with my girl gang as a birthday treat ! Initially the d√©cor didn't impress me much n we were complaining..bcz not only the place seemed a bit dingy, the lighting was inappropriate n inadequate. We ordered 5 items..3 fusion dosas- achari masti, mushroom and mutton dosa, 1 cheese uttapam n 1 chicken pizza dosa....all were simply mouth watering:):)..we finished the fusion dosas in no time...the chicken pizza dosa was totally awesome!! Since I'm a big fan of dosas n south Indian food, I think this place is a must-try for all ppl who love south Indian!

Tired of the same old dosa?¬† Love the same old dosa? Dosa@twist caters to both types! This place offers a variety of dosas, all with twists and turns as the name of the restaurant conveys. The place is around a 5 minutes walk away from Deshapriya Park, situated in the same building as that of Zeeshan. Actually, both the restaurants have the same entrance.

¬†The place is cozy and clean, with beautiful interior decor. We ordered Chicken Pizza Dosa, Egg Schezwan Cheese Butter Masala Dosa (:p) and Chocolate Dosa. The service took around 15 minutes, but the food was worth the wait. You can chitchat and click a hundred selfies to pass the time.
¬†
One will definitely fall in love with Chicken Pizza dosa with its delicious toppings and cheese . The masala dosa, its filling, the four different chutneys altogether was 10-on-10 . The Chocolate Dosa was brilliant,¬† and something I had never imagined to exist. It comes with vanilla icecream for just 80 bucks, making it an amazing dessert!

Prices are very reasonable, food is fulfilling and ambiance is perfect. No extra charges! If you're not very fond of the normal south Indian food, I'd recommend to try this place out!

The place was on my bookmark list for a long period of time. Long time ago we had dosa from the place when this place was not a restaurant but a small eating joint. 
Visited the place for Sunday dinner. The place is small with 5 to 6 tables, the interior is decorated with lager framed painting for Buddha, Mona Lisa etc. With wrought iron chairs. 
First thing that we did not like is the service time. They took a lot of time to bring the dishes to the table. Their excuse is since it's Sunday they are understaffed. 
We.ordered 2 Masala Dosa 2 Cheese Masala Dosa 1 plate Idli, 2 plate Dahi Vada. 
We specifically requsted for 2 masala dosa with 1 plate idli. However the dosas came first, we were so frustrated waiting for the ildi we asked the guy to cancel the order but minutes later he came up with the order and since the Idli order was for idli mixed with sambar we had to take it. 
The Dahi bada took another 15 minutes to come to the table, so we packed it for home. 
Taste wise, I had better dosa in other places. Anand, Banana leaf to name a few. The dosa batter had too much salt to my taste. The utensils were very modern . They chatnis were good too. Particularly the coconut one. The idlis were freshly steamed and were soft and tasted awesome. The dahi bada was okay. The consistency of the curd was not heavy. 
The bill was 500 for 4 including 2 container for take away costed 20.
The place is good to have a experimental dosas as it serve Mutton and chicken dosa. 
One suggestion for the management would be to try make the dosas more crispy and service bit fast. 
The place is good. And definitely deserve a second time visit.

Situated between Zeeshan and Royal Lebanese near Deshapriya Park, this dosa joint is what you have been looking for if you like variety dosas.

I ordered chicken cheese dosa, chicken cheese mushroom masala dosa without masala and chicken achari dosa.
Each and every item was delicious and the price was on the lower side. Do try the chocolate dosa as dessert too.
Wanna visit again soon :)

Bengali and south indian food!!Naahhhh!!but what about non veg south indian food??Now it seems interesting right??No its not a dream,finally we have non veg south indian food in kolkata..Located beside Zeeshan in Deshapriya Park,be very careful from missing the entrance since their is hardly any mention of the place.
Everything seem pretty okaish but what will definitely catch ur attention is the menu and the price!!Aaahhh the wide variety of dosas for such a low price,will definitely make your mouth watery.
Comming to the order,we had:
1.Pizza dosa- Please do try this dish,trust me it will beat dominos and pizza hut in terms of taste!!Topping was too good with chicken,cheese,babycorn everything.Simply amazing.
2.Achari dosa-Aaaaaaaahhhh!Now this one...it will transcend you to another world.Filling was too good..Chicken was fresh and you will feel the taste of home made achar in your mouth.
3.Chicken cheese babycorn dosa-Filling was good,cheese was enough to meet the expectations of your taste buds and chicken was fresh.
4.Egg chicken cheese dosa-Please do try this one if you are an egg lover.Filling was too good with loadz n loadz of scrambled eggs,cheese and chicken...love this dish!
Awesome place..only if they could make provision for expansion,then it will be great.Highly recommended.

üëç presentation, taste.

üëéit can be a little hard to find.

We both followed Kiranshankar De as he bought us to this place, a small yet decent Dosa joint, and thanx a lot for that. :) The little clumsy entrance of this place gave us no guesses about how the huge mirror on the wall, the small corner wall clock and the well matched seating arrangement inside was actually beautiful.
we were very hungry and ordered,
SAMVAR IDLI, ONION CHEESE BUTTER MASALA DOSA, MIXED UTTHAPAM, RAVA MASALA DOSA. I have nothing bad to say about their food, each of the dishes tasted super good.
You know they say, Food is all about presentation. Here you will feel that saying may be, they served such so simple foods in such a colourful manner that even the simplest Samvar Idli platter melted our heart at the first glance . ‚ù§

Situated on Deshpriya park crossing, the outlet may go unnoticed most of the times but after you have had the food here, the same wont happen again. The menu introduces you to numerous varieties of Dosa's most of which have never been heard of. 
Pizza Dosa is one of my favourites here. The must try list for me would be the schezwan dosa, Manchurian dosa and the pizza dosa.

No matter what is the field, I rate innovation very highly. So I am willing to award very high ratings to this eatery. They are one of a very rare breed of restaurants in Kolkata which dare to go beyond the usual. This is a small, easy to miss restaurant sandwiched between two other well known chains. There is nothing fancy about the d√©cor, but they make up for it with some truly innovative dosas, ones filled with chicken, mutton, mushroom, babycorn and what not. 

The mutton dosa I tried was somewhat smallish in size, but it had a generous amount of minced mutton filling inside a crispy dosa. I came with an assortment of three chutneys and the overall combination tasted quite good. The prices are very reasonable too. I wish to try out a few more varieties in the future.

Today I along with my girls gang went to taste the twisted dosas. The sitting arrangement was more or less adjustable for our gang of 5. We ordered chicken pizza dosa, chicken achari dosa, egg mushroom babycorn cheese butter masala dosa, onion cheese butter uttapam, mutton mushroom masala dosa and some cold drinks. 
I must say that chicken achari dosa, egg mushroom babycorn cheese butter masala dosa and mutton mushroom masala dosa were just fabulous and spicy. After having them, chicken pizza dosa and onion cheese butter uttapam (which was also good) might seem a bit down. 
Having all of these, the pocket pinch was only Rs765 which was very reasonable.

Located between zeeshan and royal lebanese at deshopriyo park crossing towards southern avenue, this one really is a hidden gem. Despite modest seating arrangement comprising of 6tables and service slightly on the slower side,their food outshines everything else.

The ambience is very homely, we had a nice little chat with the owner as well as the staff and I cannot praise the food enough. The food is served piping hot and is fresh and tasty!

Coming to food,here's what we ordered
‚óè Egg Mutton Dosa
‚óè Egg Mutton Cheese Dosa which was stuffed with a generous amount of cheese and tasted absolutely delicious. Do try!
‚óè Chicken pizza dosa: MUST TRY. If there's just one item you wanna try out,this is the one. The topping had chicken,baby corn,mushroom and the base was infused with oregano..extremely tasty. Just thinking of it makes me want to go back there asap!
‚óè Medu vada
‚óè Egg schezwan dosa: Anything Schezwan makes my taste buds happy but this particular dosa seemed a little bland compared to the others.

Every dosa is served with 3 chutneys, onion and tomato chutney, coriander chutney and the standard coconut chutney.

It's such a happy little place. I personally loved it and would highly recommend everyone to visit it once atleast and trust me,it'll leave you wanting to go again! It's easy on the pocket and great for the taste buds! :)

I absolutely loved the place and the food they serve. Such a wide range of options that people will get confused what to choose and what not to. I had the egg chiken babycorn masala dosa. It was lip-smacking. The ambience was soothing too. I really really loved the place.

P.S - There is a dropbox inside tge restaurant where they collect funds for animal welfare. This is a wonderful attempt from their part to help the needy souls. I would hope each one of you who will visit will donate whatever amount you want to and support them for achieving their goal.

Today me and my girlfriend wanted to satisfy our taste buds with some dosa's before we decided where to check-in, we browsed Zomato and found this restaurant was at a good rating. We checked-in and following the recommendation lists we ordered 
1.Chicken Masala Dosa
2.Egg Munchurian Masala Dosa
Both were really tasty and beyond what we expected it would be. For the first time we tried Non-Veg dosa's and wow wot a twist it had and that to at a pocket-friendly price.
Will surely visit this place again to try their Chocolate Dosa.

An interesting twist to the regular dosa and south indian food, the variety includes mini idlis and non veg dosas. A good deal for the money. It is a small place and type of roadside eatery.
            
This place has changed the concept of dosas and idlis with mind blowing options on the menu which you have not seen anywhere else.

I had heard a lot about this place and i finally visited it yesterday. Located in the same building as zeeshan it is an amazing outlet serving both veg and non veg dosas. Seating is limited but it is a good place. Prices totally affordable. We tried the pizza dosa , fried idli with cheese and chocolate dosa with ice cream. All were good . Fried idli was yum . And the pizza disa was the show stopper . Do try it.

Food : Too all the Dosa lovers out there. This is the place with unique and amazing Dosa. Both non veg and veg with a immense and toothsome list of dosa in the menu.

Well, just yesterday we visited this place after hearing about the non veg dosas and believe me it did not disappoint at all. A tricky place to find, located in the same building as the zeeshan at the ground floor at the convergence of sarat bose road,and deshapriya park. It was a small eatery with hardly 25 people to sit together. We ordered the egg cheese chiken masala dosa. Well I never had such a different taste of dosa in my life, certainly a twist. Then we ordered the chocolate dosa- again a twist, it tasted great and was served with an icecream. Overall very much pocket friendly and the menu is inclusive of the tax. So if you are low on budget but still want some mouth watering twist in your life with food, go for it..

The Chicken Pizza Dosa and the Chocolate Dosa (with ice cream) are superb. The Veg Dosas, served with 3 types of chutney and sambar of the right consistency, are good too.

Nice, clean and quiet AC seating area.

Prices mentioned in the menu are all-inclusive. And you can pay using Paytm if you don't have cash.

If you order the Pizza Dosa be prepared to wait a little longer ( than for the usual dosas). But the wait is worth it. Really. For ‚Çπ160/- only. With generous amount of cheese and chicken along with other toppings like olives, mushrooms, capsicum, onions, babycorn, tomatoes, etc. and the right amount of seasonings. Looks like a normal medium-sized pizza. But the base is of dosa instead of thick bread.

The Chocolate Dosa is crispy, chocolatey and hot. Comes with a scoop of ice cream. Only for ‚Çπ120/- . Ask for this item. (It wasn't mentioned in the menu card).

Have been having south indian from here ever since their seating area had not opened. This outlet started off with just delivery at economical rates. Presently the restaurant is open with a decently done seating area covering 30pax. 
The twist is the way you approach Dosa and south indian. Whether it is the schezwan cheese Dosa or the mushroom one, Dosa pizza or the dessert chocolate Dosa. Everything here is a must try. 
Non vegetarians rejoice as there are plenty options for them too!

The chutneys are well made, and the sambhar is good. 
Prices are reasonable compared to the experience. 
Overall a pretty good place in Deshapriya Park ( close to royal chow, near the string of eateries)

"Dosa @ Twist " - quite a twist indeed!!
When it comes to food, the word 'experiment' does not goes very well with bong families who always support authenticity over mix and match. Mine was not an expection either. I have been visiting this place since the time it was just a food stall. As this eatery is just a few minutes walk from my tution, so it more or less serves the purpose of a quick bite for me between college and tution gap.
I have never been quite an enthusiast regarding South India food as it always portrays the image of dosas or idlis in my mind, whom I have always found bland and unappetizing vegetarian dishes untill Dosa Twist was there. Bored of trying all of their veg dishes, this time I thought of trying out their much hyped non-veg dosas. Despite my parents repeated discouragements that chicken and dosa combination is a big disaster and with some initial ambiguous feelings finally decided to order - Cheese Chicken Dosa. My mom as usual ordered her permanent favourite - Butter Masala Dosa and this time was able to convince her to try out their famous - Chocolate Dosa atleast.
The food was simply Amm....Aaa...Zing!!! I just cant express that blissful feeling while having the cheese chicken dosa in words!! :p.... it is the BESTamong all their dosas I have tried till now!! Butter masal dosa was also very tasty and is one among my top hits as well. And about chocolate dosas I would say whoever visit this place its a must try.This is served along with ice -cream.... and this exquisite dish is just heavenly!! Even my mom was so impressed by it that she immediately ordered another plate.
Had a very joyful meal there! I think every food enthusiast should visit this place once. Definitely going back to try out their another speciality - Pizza Dosa. Have to admit quite impressed with their twisted and innovative recipes!!
HAPPY EATING TO ALL!!! :D

Even though I have been seeing this place for a long time, it was just a few weeks back that I decided to finally, give this place a try. Another take away counter, located just between Royal Lebanese and Zeeshan. The food, as the name suggests definitely has got a twist to it. The Egg Chicken Cheese Masala Dosa and The Fried Idli was something, I have never even heard of, before. Not very fond of the South Indian style of cooking, I absolutely gorged on it. On one of the staff‚Äôs suggestion, we also tried their chocolate idli, it was unique and amazing. This small brightly colored place is certainly a hidden gem and the foods are a must, must, must try.

South Indian food with non veg fusion!! Seems quite odd naa??? Yes, Dosa @ Twist play the real twist with it and offers you a wide range of Non Veg Dosa, Idly etc. Come, lets explore this twist.

location - Located at Desapriya Park. If you are coming from kalighat Metro, take a right turn at Sarat bose Road Crossing you will find Zeeshan.. Dosa @ Twist is at its ground floor. Both Zeeshan and Dosa @ Twist occupying the same building. ¬†So don't get confuse will entering the building.

Ambiance - It is a small food joint with 2 room dining arrangement. The place can hold 24-25 persons at a time. Big portrait are hanged in every wall, a small wall clock is also there which i really a eye catching item.

Stuffs and management - When we entered the restaurant no one was there, only a lady was there in the cashier table. Soon a boy came to us and offered the menu card and glass of water. The service is really quick and the restaurant is well maintained, so kudos to Management.

Menu - They offered a wide variety of Veg and Non-veg Dosa, utthapam, idly etc. Some non veg combination is really eye catching. Chicken Dosa is most popular item over there, so we ordered Chicken Masala Dosa at first and then Egg Manchurian Cheese Butter Masala Dosa at a random choice.

Chicken Masala Dosa - The Dosa come is a curvy plate with three types of chatney i.e Red(Onion-Garlic), Green(Coriander) and White(Regular which is served everywhere) chatney. The Texture of the dosa is so perfect that you become fan of it. Crispy in nature, not over fried. Mashed chicken fillings with various spices make this one just woow, so mouth watering. It was my first Non-Veg Dosa I've tried and believe me it makes me fall in love with it. Super Recommended.

Egg Manchurian Cheese Butter Masala Dosa - Honestly speaking, actually we ordered this item by getting influenced by its name. :D The dosa came as same as Chicken Dosa with three types of Chatney. But additional Sambar daal was there. The texture of the dosa looks little lite than Chicken dosa but the surprise is hidden inside the outer crust of the Dosa. Thick layer of Cheese are there which tastes really awesome. believe me this one is actually far far better than Domino's' Cheesy pizza, melt in your mouth. The feeling was also awesome cooked. Little tangy in nature and perfect blend of Manchurian spice really makes our wild guess item a super hit one.

Price - Well, thankfully there is no such hidden twist in there pricing unlike other restaurant. The mentioned price in the menu card are all inclusive of all taxes. No extra charges are added. So it cost us only 250INR, which is very much impressive one.

In conclusion, I don't think I have to say anything more about this restaurant. From entrance to exit, everything was so perfect that you hardly found in a well known restaurant. A such type of experience from a hidden gems make its own place in my heart. Super recommended.

A small but good place to hangout. There are lots of south indian dishes to choose from. i liked the fact that they have over 20 varieties of dosa and i have to say the ones I have tried were Pretty good. I feel the service could be a bit better and the dishes can be cheaper. Nonetheless a good place to hang out for the teens

I learned about the place through zomato and was actually excited to try non veg dosa. Finally I could manage to visit here today. Ordered chicken cheese dosa and chocolate dosa! Well the place is pocket friendly with the bill coming to 250. The chicken cheese dosa was really tasty served with 3types of chutney. The green one probably a coriander leaves and chilly one was the best. 
Well coming to chocolate dosa I was a bit disappointed. IT was salty. The ice cream they served was tasty. But the dosa contained too much salt for a dessert. May be they made it out of the same batter with which they make the normal dosa. 
I would like to visit the place again and try their pizza dosa.!

A hidden gem, located at main road still a deserted place. Entrance such which will make you doubt to enter and adding to that empty seats, being no one inside. But the uniqueness and experimental will make you come again.

Tried cheese fired idly which was a disaster, morzella cheese which didn't melt. Pizza dosa was brilliant and so was babycorn cheese masala dosa. The quality and taste of chutneys are good and sambar is one of the best. For desert they have a choclate dosa which is brownie infused and you get tuti-futi icecream in place of chutneys. A brilliant combination but I found the Brownie to be over cooked. Overall a nice experience but the menu lacks some sorting and with nothing to drink in the menu with only option available being water. With-

(although in zomato menu its given to be 85) nevertheless ordered an egg chicken cheese pizza followed by a chocolate pizza . both of them tasted great . the chicken pizza was filled with chicken and cheese served with 3 types of chutneys . but the dish of the day was the chocolate dosa it was amazing. ¬†i want to know the recipe :D will try some more non veg pizzas as well. last thing i want to tell is that they dont accept cards .pics will be uploaded shortly :)

South Indian Dosa with Chicken & Mutton doesn't seemed to club together & isn't very common too. But Dosa @ Twist does this twist & provides some excellent tasty results.

Location : This one is very easy to find located on the Sarat Bose Road just beside Zeeshan. Both the restaurants are having the same entrance where Zeeshan dine is on the 1st floor, this one is just straight. Nearest metro is Kalighat & 15 min of walk towards Desopriyo Park is required.

Decorations : A simple 2 room dining with hardly 20 peoples sitting that's how hidden gems are like. Beautiful portraits on the walls & wooden textured tables are eye catcher over here. Warm white leds lighting & cool ac breeze makes it more elegant. This place makes you feel comfortable instantly after entering into the restaurant.

Foods : Their menu is quite big covering a huge number of veg & non veg variety of Dosas & other south indian dishes like Uttapam, Idli etc. But their most famous is Chicken Masala Dosa. So we ordered the same & another uncommon dish to justify their real quality.

Staffs & Management : The restaurant was empty when we reached. At that time they served us very quickly. Management gets a credit point for maintaining neat clean & beautiful ambience.

Chicken Masala Dosa : Not too big not too small, nicely crispy fried, not excessive oily, fully stuffed with mashed chicken, 3 different red, green & white coconut chatnies served in matching coloured egg shaped small pots, all this made the presentation nearly perfect. But the taste made it completely perfect. Stuffed chicken was yammy, outer layer was tasty. I haven't tried a non veg dosa before neither I have tried this good dosa before this. This twist will surely make you fall in love with.

Egg Manchurian Cheese Butter Masala Dosa : Just as its name it was filled with all the items mentioned. Looks & taste wise it was lighter than Chicken Masala Dosa. But the same crisp was present here too with the cheesy feeling Wow! Actually this felt more cheesy than Dominos Pizzas. Taste of perfectly used Manchurian spices felt great with dosa. They also served sambeer with this dosa. The tangy & sweet mixed taste of this made me fall in love with & I asked to them for more.

Pricing : Well its where they don't play the twist unlike most of the restaurants. Even they offer an AC dine still they don't add any VAT & Service Taxes. All the items on the menu card is decently priced. Our bill for both the dishes were only Rs. 250. If this doesn't impress you, I don't know what will!

Conclusion : Wonderful, Delicious, Awesome, Excellent all this words fell very less to define them. 2 min of silence for those, who enteres into the same entrance to go upwards to Zeeshan by ignoring this magical tasty treat. Such a lovely place for every kind of foodies. This one is a must go & it also goes to my favorite list.

This is a surprisingly good place. At 10 pm last night, I was going to Banana Leaf but found it had closed its doors. Searching at Zomato, I discovered this place and oh boy, I was pleasantly surprised.
The passage leading to the entrance is not very welcoming but once inside, you will like it. Its a smallish restaurant with around 8 tables but well done inside.
The menu is the most extensive I have ever seen. And it has all combinations possible and including non-veg items and also a range of veg items as well.
We ordered the chicken and cheese dosa and chicken ¬†and cheese masala dosa. Both were extremely well done and very tasty. It isnt very large in size but the prices are very reasonable for the size, quality and quantity of the ingredients inside. The non-veg dosas are served with 3 very tasty chutneys and they serve the sambhar on request. The veg dosas come with the three chutneys and the sambhar.
Another great thing about this place is that it is open till 11:30pm so one can hope to get food even if deciding very late in the day.
This will be my 'Go-To' south indian restaurant henceforth. And thanks to Zomato for helping me to discover this place.

Do try it out. Believe me, like me, you will love it here !!

Okay.. we didn't actually plan to visit this restaurant, but since it was Durga Pujo and all the places were kinda packed up, we visited this place. We were made to wait for half an hour..that too near the kitchen. There was no proper line being maintained. Whoever stood nearer to the door entered first. The menu was a surprise to us. There was a wide variety of dosas you can choose from. We ordered two Masala dosas, one onion cheese dosa and one babycorn cheese dosa. It took ages to prepare them. Oh btw, let me tell you, the table wasn't even cleaned when we took our seat. Coming to the dosas, maybe the worst we have eaten. I don't know if it was because of the pujo rush or that's the normal quality there, but it was far from satisfactory.

Located opposite of deshopriyo park in between zeeshan and Lebanese corner this place is truly a gem. The entrance is so small that anyone will hardly recognise. The food here is splendid. So much variety in such a reasonable price. The taste is excellent. We had a chicken dosa, a schewan dosa and chilli tomato onion uthapam. All of them seemed to be gods gift. The ambience and decor of the place is simple and rustic with beautiful paintings.

A hell lot of twist indeed!! Kolkata is coming up with a number of innovative restros recently and Dosa @ Twist justifies it's name to the utmost. The rating of this restro speaks for itself. Have been planning to try this place for quite some time now and finally ended up there with my friend today. Being a bong I have always loved spicy and non veg dishes and hence south indian never appealed to me much. Basically I opt for them ¬†only when there's no other option available. So its evident from my rating that how pleased I am with this place. To me south indian is equivalent to having veg. But the whole concept of this ¬†place changed ¬†my outlook. ¬†Finding the place may be a bit challenging as the entrance is easily mistaken as an entrance to a residential building. Its a tiny place with sitting capacity of maximum 15 persons but as the saying goes "do not judge a book by its cover". Once seated I knew what to order. So Chicken Pizza dosa and Button idli in chicken curry it was, folllowed by Chocolate dosa. It will be an understatement to say that each of the dishes are very very unique and tasty. Chocolate dosa is not included in the menu and you will have to ask for it separately. So to sum it up- excellent food, dirt cheap price and nice ambiance. The only issue i had is that they take too long to serve the food(reason for deducting 0.5 point). Otherwise kudos to the innovative concept. I'm sure that this quaint little restro is going to make a name for itself very soon. Recommended for everyone who like me have a prejudice towards south indian. Finally a thanks to Zomato for finding out such hidden gems in the nooks and corners of the city.
¬†

P.S-no tax is charged:)

This will be my 'Go-To' south indian restaurant henceforth. And thanks to Zomato for helping me to discover this place.

Do try it out. Believe me, like me, you will love it here !!

Okay.. we didn't actually plan to visit this restaurant, but since it was Durga Pujo and all the places were kinda packed up, we visited this place. We were made to wait for half an hour..that too near the kitchen. There was no proper line being maintained. Whoever stood nearer to the door entered first. The menu was a surprise to us. There was a wide variety of dosas you can choose from. We ordered two Masala dosas, one onion cheese dosa and one babycorn cheese dosa. It took ages to prepare them. Oh btw, let me tell you, the table wasn't even cleaned when we took our seat. Coming to the dosas, maybe the worst we have eaten. I don't know if it was because of the pujo rush or that's the normal quality there, but it was far from satisfactory.

Intro : Tucked between Zeeshan. and one more joint is this gem !  Narrow entrance leads you to the dining place .Decent interior nothing out of the box - but good cozy feeling .
Food : We wanted nothing heavy - hence just ordered Chicken Masala Dosa  - yes the name suggsts the twist ! 
Well it was a delight - Minced chicken and mashed potato stuffing in a dosa - and it tasted amazing . Truly superb - what an idea and what great taste 
The dosa came with Sambar & 3. Chutney s - Green Mint Chutney,Garlic - Coconut Chutney & White Chutney - all were fantastic 4.5/5

Located opposite of deshopriyo park in between zeeshan and Lebanese corner this place is truly a gem. The entrance is so small that anyone will hardly recognise. The food here is splendid. So much variety in such a reasonable price. The taste is excellent. We had a chicken dosa, a schewan dosa and chilli tomato onion uthapam. All of them seemed to be gods gift. The ambience and decor of the place is simple and rustic with beautiful paintings.

A hell lot of twist indeed!! Kolkata is coming up with a number of innovative restros recently and Dosa @ Twist justifies it's name to the utmost. The rating of this restro speaks for itself. Have been planning to try this place for quite some time now and finally ended up there with my friend today. Being a bong I have always loved spicy and non veg dishes and hence south indian never appealed to me much. Basically I opt for them ¬†only when there's no other option available. So its evident from my rating that how pleased I am with this place. To me south indian is equivalent to having veg. But the whole concept of this ¬†place changed ¬†my outlook. ¬†Finding the place may be a bit challenging as the entrance is easily mistaken as an entrance to a residential building. Its a tiny place with sitting capacity of maximum 15 persons but as the saying goes "do not judge a book by its cover". Once seated I knew what to order. So Chicken Pizza dosa and Button idli in chicken curry it was, folllowed by Chocolate dosa. It will be an understatement to say that each of the dishes are very very unique and tasty. Chocolate dosa is not included in the menu and you will have to ask for it separately. So to sum it up- excellent food, dirt cheap price and nice ambiance. The only issue i had is that they take too long to serve the food(reason for deducting 0.5 point). Otherwise kudos to the innovative concept. I'm sure that this quaint little restro is going to make a name for itself very soon. Recommended for everyone who like me have a prejudice towards south indian. Finally a thanks to Zomato for finding out such hidden gems in the nooks and corners of the city.
¬†

P.S-no tax is charged:)

Small outlet of dosas with a bit of twist in them. Not much of a time that it has opened but still has managed to get people going there. i am not a frequent visitor to deshapriya park but on one occassion i had gone to a relatives place and for the bengali tukitaki snacks my cousin took me there. we ordered a chicken cheese dosa and a mysore masala dosa. they serve it with three different kinds of chuneys. i must tell you the taste was absolutely wonderful. i could never imagine that non veg dosas would taste this good. It was a delight.

Visited this eatery mainly to try out their non veg dosa. Ordered BabyCorn mushroom chicken cheese butter masal dosa. Taste was bit different from typical regular south indian masala dosa. The stuffing tasted good, but somoehow the taste of coconut white and red chutney was not upto the mark - too sour. Ambience is average, with lot of huge painting on the walls.

Superb stuff served here. Came at around 1am on sashthi night, found the staff very cordial. Minimalist and pleasant decor. We tried the chicken cheese dosa, the egg Mutton dosa, chicken baby corn cheese dosa, the chocolate dosa as recommended by the owner. We loved the dosas, cherished the old school dosa in a new Avatar. Will surely recommend a friend.

Recommendations: Egg Mutton dosa, chicken cheese dosa

Puja time it is. All places are over crowded. So I searched on zomato...and found this place nearby. We were the first customers of the day. So the place is neat and clean,with simple iron chair-tables...few pictures hanging on the wall. 

They had a large variety on dosa..but they told us it will take same time. So we ordered normal masala dosa..and one rice combo which consists of fried rice and chicken kasha with one cold drinks/ice cream.

The RICE combk was served early. I was surprised to see as they served the food in thermocol plates... didn't expect that. ü§î The rice was of decent amount  with two chicken pieces. But the rice was not cooked perfectly,a bit hard...though good amount of carrots,bins were present..but it was lacking in flavours,in salt...in sweetness. üôÅ I was a bit dissapointed.. So okayish was the chicken...just like normal chicken we eat at home. üòê

The masala dosa was comparatively good. Crispy outside..with lots of potato fillings inside..served with sambar and chutney. A bit oily though...but tasty. üëå

We had cold drinks,and the bill was 270. 

Though I never read in their reviews that food is being served on thermokol plates and also always three kinds of chutneys are served. Maybe it was puja time...so we had a experience like this. But I wanna go there one more time to try their different variety of dosas. And also the place is pocket friendly. So worth a visit. üëç

This place is cool because it offers out-of-d-box gastronomic awesomeness in tht age old rice batter recipe we call dosa at dirt cheap prices!
MY BIGGEST TURN ON - all the crazy combinations you thought were impossible on earth with a dosa were listed on dt frill free menu.
I had Pizza dosa which was too hot to handle for my taste. and I had chocolate dosa which is DEFINITELY A MUST. ( its more of a desert served with ice cream + butterscotch buds inside a thin crispy dosa blended with chocolate spread). 

MY BIGGEST TURN OFF- it is only a 6 table restaurant. n late afternoon when I went thr one of d table was occupied by a serious lady with papers all around who seemed to b doing something important(sure to b from dt restaurant) n I cudnt choose the section I wanted. 
Also the menu offers hardly anything exciting to drink.

The restaurant entrance is somewhat hidden beside the takeaway counter . Once you find your way in the place amazes  you . I think the most versatile dosa menu I saw , a neatly chosen ambience and a smiling owner and a fantastic pricing. The seating capacity is small but not the warmth. The mutton keema was soft  and not overfried a superb sign of care . The rava dosa had its crisp and the neer dosa was soft and tender perfect to accompany the mutton curry it comes with . Had a small t√™te-√†-t√™te with owner and couldn't stop congratulate her over her great job.

On the day of Eid decided to have a twist with cuisines so selected this place as its one of the best in this type of pocket friendly cuisine twist.They fulfilled their promise of providing my order even though being late was very much impressed by their dedication. The twist in cuisine consisting of Pizza Dosas were wonderfully churned out by them.Looking forward to trying more of their dishes in the future maybe visiting their joint sometime

** Location = At Sarat Bose Road just beside the Royal Lebanese.

** Brief = One of my friend introduced me to this gem of a place. A place where you get chicken dhosa was a completely new thing for me.

** Ambiance = The place is small yet brightly lit and the servers are good people. We happened to meet with the owner of the place who was present and she helped us a lot to choose our dishes and she was a wonderful person to talk with.

** Things tried = Cheese Chicken Dhosa, Mutton Dhosa, Chicken Dhosa and Chicken Pizza Dhosa. The str was "Chocolate Dhosa".

The dhosas were served along with 3 perfect chutneys which added to the delight. One who has not tasted nonveg dhosa would be in a different world altogether after having them here.

All of them were just too good and we had great time enjoying the food here.
Then the lady dropped the bomb, yeah she announced "Chocolate Dhosa" and the moment it was served we ordered another before tasting even, mesmerised by the looks of it. It was not in the menu though.

** Recommended = Chicken Cheese Dhosa and Chocolate Dhosa.

** Purse Check = It is very much pocket friendly. Rs.500/- would be great for 2 people.

** Overall = Definitely going back for more. Thumbs Up :)

This quaint resturant beaide zeeshan is an unsung hero of fusion food.I am neither a sputh indian food lover nor have a sweet tooth but their chicken pizza dosa and chocolate dosa have made me so much i terested in fusion food.the dosabaseof pizzadosais difficult to distinguish from thin crust and the topping is generous with chicken and cheese, sp much so u will drop them off fromyour base. The chocolate pizza is not on menu and you have to order them separately. Thehot chocolate dosa is flavouredwith rich glueee chocolate and cru chy sesamese seed served with a scoop of vanilla. Tbis may giveany dessertof coffee shops a stiff competition.Theportions are pretty large and two of us had to struggle to finish it off aftera day of shopping and walking arpund which will make you incredibly hungry. The place is small woth 4-5tables but we found only one table other than us occupied on a busy second saturday eve,less than a month ahead of puja, at 7 p.m. perhaps it is yetto be discovered by many.The bestpart is it isso lightonyourpocket. A chicken puzza dosa,a chocolate dosa and 2fresh lime sodas costyou arpund 350/-...there are no taxadded on the menu prices.

This little gem a.k.a 'Dosa @ Twist'  is located in Desapriya Park in between Zeeshan and Royal Lebanese. We went here last night at around 8 pm. The restaurant is a small one located inside the building. It is well decorated with giant pictures of Monalisa, The Last Supper etc. We ordered 'Chicken Pizza Dosa' first. The food took twenty minutes to arrive. They must look into this as they take too long to serve their food. The 'Chicken Pizza Dosa'  was delicious. It was a bit tangy owing to the dosa batter. It was topped with chicken keema, mushroom, baby corn, olives, bell pepper, cheese etc and was served with tomato sauce. We thoroughly enjoyed this dish. Up next, we ordered we ordered 'Chocolate Dosa'. It took ten minutes to arrive and the first sigheof the dish blew our minds. Dosa wrapped around warm brownie tasted heavenly with the vanilla ice-cream served alongside it. It was delicious. The staff is polite and well behaved. All in all, a great store and will definitely visit again.

I visit the Deshapriya Park area often, either for work or just to enjoy my time with my dearest friends. Both my occupational and friendly visits are compulsorily indulged by the different varieties of tummy warming food options, served in the locality. I have no clue why I have missed stepping into this place earlier.¬†

I had already heard a lot about their non-veg dosas, hence one fine evening a little nudging from a friend and a hungry stomach led me into this small place. I immediately ordered for a plate of dahi vada and the chicken cheese butter masala dosa. While the dahi vads is nice, with fluffy, soft vadas, resting amongst a pool of cold, whisked dahi, topped with chutney and fried vermicelli, the dosa is on another level all together.

It is nothing like you have had before. The dosa is crispy, just like a dosa should be and remains so for a long period of time, mostly because of the level of rava present in the batter. The chicken, cheese and the masala is delightful, but also very heavy on the palette. It is hard to continue after a few mouthfuls, just because of the cholesterol over load and nothing else. The flavours are spot on. 

Will surely drop in again, maybe, this time with someone to share the dosa with.

The place has a pleasant sitting arrangement. Good service.The food is terrible. Tried Mutton dosa, Egg Masala Dosa the fillings were Ok. The dosas were micro size and worser than those of the footpath vendors. No Sambhar served with dosas and the chutneys were tasteless.Quality wise certainly not worth the price.

This restaurant is truly a hidden gem. For those who might be confused as to the location take an auto from gariahat and get down at Sarat Bose road, ask for Zeeshan, it's in the same building. The ambience was lovely...quaint but subtly elegant. The staff is extremely attentive and service is quite fast. We ordered Mushroom cheese masala dosa and Chicken achari masti dosa. The mushroom cheese had lots of stringy cheese and a vegetable filling with mushrooms, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. The chicken achari masti was just wow! It had a tangy flavour...you could smell the achaar and it was so full of chicken keema that the chicken spills out if you try to cut it. An excellent experience overall not to mention that prices on the menu are inclusive of taxes. So it's extremely pocket friendly. Definitely going to visit again for the schezwan dosa.

They've expertised the art of creating variations in the good old south indian dosa of ours. Loved their ideas.

Located just next to zeeshan, make sure you follow the arrows that lead you to the dining area. 

We ordered: 
Szechwan Plain Dosa- amazing is the word. Since when did dosa become so tasty? üòÖ Coming back for more of it.
Chicken Pizza Dosa- kudos to their imagination for coming up with this. Pizza toppings with dosa crust. Too filling. One would be good for two people. 

All the dosas are served with 3 kinds of chutney. The original coconut one, pudina one and a spicy one. Also, sambar dal. I do not like sambar dal, hence avoided it here as well. 

Lastly, its pocket friendly and the above for Rs. 225. Tax inclusive menu, a real good deal.

There are places that please you so much, that you can't help but rate them a 5!
Dosa@Twist fills in the gap between traditional south Indian flavours and the affinity of the typical Bengali palate for more greasy, fried and non vegetarian food. It also manages to please the pocket along with the taste buds. It is extremely well-located too, and the variety of dosa stuffing available here alone blows one's mind.

I have tried the chicken, egg and cheese dosa, fried idlis with butter or cheese and a spicy south Indian mutton curry with baby idlis swimming in the gravy. All these dishes were top notch. Everything down to the sambar and chutneys offered are mouth watering. 

The owner herself is sweetness personified. Very accommodating and friendly, she explained to us that it had been a Bengali friend of hers who had a penchant for south Indian food, but also could not stand vegetarian dishes, who urged her to open this joint. Whoever you are, thank you sir/madam for making this happen!
I am going back soon. What about you? üòÅ

It was a rainy day and thunderstruck outside, me with mom entered this restaurant for a rainy day date ;) .Though it looks small from outside,located just beside zeeshan at deshopriyo park but as soon as u enter, it's a nice food joint with clean and minimal decor. 
Here comes the twist, dosas with those usual aloo stuffing: an old story.. but some nonveg dosas with chatpata chutneys will definitely won your heart. Ordered chicken cheese masala dosa, mutton cheese dosa. Both were superb. Wanted to order button idlis too,but we were already so full. My mom loved this place.
There's no extra tax. Taxes already included.
Cheers dosa@twist! Will surely visit again.

First visit was accidental.. and it was a good accident. They delivered the dosa at Lake gardens withing 30- 45 mins. These twisted tales of dosa is quite tasty and unique. The restaurant is a bit small, but staff behavior is good. ¬†Overall good experience

This place was in my wish list since long. Finally me and by friend visited on a Saturday evening with our little kids. The sitting area is very small and there are only 5-6 tables. The decor is pretty simple and the wall paintings are quite aesthetic. 
We ordered four types of Dosas as we wanted to taste as much varieties as possible. There were Egg Cheese Babycorn Masala Dosa, Chicken Cheese Dosa, Chicken Pizza Dosa and lastly a plain Dosa for my friend's son. 
The Plain Dosa was served in the shape of a conical hat. All the Dosas except Pizza Dosa were served with Sambar and 3 types of Chutneys- coconut, pudina and onion tomato chutney. Pizza Dosa was served with tomato ketchup. We first dug into the Egg Cheese Babycorn Masala Dosa. The stuffing was in huge quantity. The cheese was generously added. The Potato Masala was not the typical South Indian sour type and we found it really tasty. The Chicken Dosa also contained  ample amount of cheese and chicken and was equally tasty. The Pizza Dosa was the most interesting one. The base was made of Dosa batter. Apart from chicken and cheese it also contained mushrooms and was garnished with chilly flakes. My son enjoyed the Egg Cheese Baby Corn Masala Dosa the most. Me and my friend enjoyed each and every bite of the different varieties of yummy cheesy Dosas that we had ordered. It was a delight for our taste buds. All these costed only Rs 500/. 
This is a place I would like to visit multiple times and would love to taste all the varieties available.

Absolutely Wonderful. This place is definitely a Hidden Gem. The outlet is very small, but yes, when it comes to the food, it is lip smacking. 
We tried the mutton pizza dosa and mutton cheese dosa. They were outstanding and over the top. It was followed by Neer dosa with mutton curry and kima pao with mutton. Just unbelievable. 
Last but not the least, it was time for chocolate dosa. Brownie inside a dosa with vanilla ice cream. Pure bliss. It was an absolute pleasure to be here and taste something so awesome. You definitely are a Hidden Gem. No doubt about that.

Located in desapriya park just in between go Lebanese and zeeshan.


This is a small eatery with minimal decor yet clean and some nice paintings and wall hangings. And the washroom is super clean (point to be noted) ¬†


I visited this place with few of my friends ¬†almost 15-20 days back and am writing it today. 


We ordered..

Cheese masala rava dosa 

Chicken pizza dosa 

Button idli in chicken curry 

Neer dosa with chicken curry 


Out of the 4 the first two were my favourite of all definitely a must try.

Cheese masala rava dosa served with 4 chutney is definitely lip smacking, and all those cheese inside aah! Mama Mia .


Never thought about chicken and dosa together, and that too in a pizza style. Definitely will hit your taste buds. 


The neer dosa was something new I tried. 

It's soft and pretty awesome. 


Well it was awesome to try out some fusion dishes with such lovely foodie friends. Definitely will visit again.

As the name suggests, Dosa with a twist...and a really tasty and innovative twist :)
Went there for evening snacks on a rainy afternoon, good location...on DP more just beside Royal Lebanese.
A small way led to the seating area inside, which was almost empty, save for one. A homely ambience, but nicely decorated, a soothing place.
We ordered Chicken Dosa Pizza and Chocolate Dosa.
The pizza was very well made and tasty and tingy!! The chocolate dosa was the star of the evening with molten chocolate in every bite of it :D
Took a parcel of Egg Chicken dosa...which had sufficient amounts of chicken and egg in it, with the chutneys. Very good again!

Overall, it was a fantastic experience, will visit again :) 
Please try to make a bigger seating area...am sure more ppl will visit with time and popularity, as food quality is quite good :)

This is a small eatery just beside the Desapriyo Park Zeeshan outlet,offering some amazing one-of-a-kind dosas. The place is clean and clutter-free.
This should be the go-to place for dosa lovers as well as those people who like a bit of meat in everything they eat. The non-veg dosas here are amazing and are available at very pocket friendly rates. My top picks will be the chicken mushroom masala dosa,chicken babycorn masala dosa,egg mutton butter masala dosa,chicken pizza dosa,plain cheese masala dosa,and there are many more to choose from. You must absolutely order the chocolate Dosa. It's an absolute treat with dark chocolate and caramel filling inside the crispy dosa. All in all,it is a great place that you should visit at least once.

First of all Dosa were full of salty taste, so couldn't enjoy... and rest two items were just BAAK-BAAS....
Over all very bad experience....

This place is absolutely a hidden gem. Located in between royal lebanese and zeeshan near deshapriya park. Don't judge this place by it's position and counter. They do have a seating arrangement inside the building of the counter. Once we were taken inside we forgot about the initial hustle of finding this place. Their menu card offers a variety of south indian dishes in an absolutely unique concept. As we were already full, we tried their chocolate dosa for the sweet tooth. Chocolate dosa was amazing and it would be a recommendation for all of you guys to atleast try this one. I am sure you won't regret on your choice. Atleast I did not. The manager and the staffs were courteous. Service was fast. Pocket-pinch is pretty cheap too.

Contrary to what most Calcuttans think, non-veg Dosa is not a fusion food and is quite popular in it's originating Southern states. Neer Dosa with Chicken Curry is an age old popular dish. And being a huge lover of this combo, we visited Dosa@Twist with huge expectations. When the food was placed in front of us, we knew we came to the right place. The fluffy neer dosa made our day. We don't get this non crispy type of dosa easily here in Calcutta. The chicken curry was full of flavours with soft and juicy pieces of meat. 

We would suggest visit this place with an open mind. Even if you have only consumed veg dosa till this date, what's the harm in trying something new. Am sure you would love the meat curry dipped soft neer dosas.

A very close friend of mine recommended this place to me, so i had to try it. And i was not disappointed. Infact this place just blew my mind! The innovation with the food! Just wow! 
We ordered: 
1.Chicken pizza dosa
2.chicken baby corn dosa
4.fried cheese idli
5. Chocolate dosa
The chickens pizza dosa is an on point dish. You HAVE to order it. Its just amazing. The chicken babycorn dosa was great too. In fact we started off with it, and boy, it was love at first bite!
The fried cheese idli was good. But it was a little too crunchy for my taste. But tasted good all the same. 
The winner of all was the Chocolate dosa with a scoop of ice cream. It tastes just like chocolate darsan. Just more goodness and more chocolate. 
The service was prompt and staff friendly. In fact, the lady who owns the place was a sweetheart and gave us an extra scoop of complementary ice cream( Yay!)
A must visit.! And for the vegetarian friends, dont worry-there is an even better variety of dosa for you guys.

Well didn't know dosa could have such varities! This is a small place tucked away near deshapriya park beside royal lebanese and opposite the monalisa guest house.  nice ambience and well behaved staffs.   we tried the oh-so-famous chicken pizza dosa, egg cheese manchurian dosa and the chicken achaari masti dosa.  the chiken pizza dosa is like a regular pizza only with thin crusts and the crust is a bit sour which goes nice with rest of the flavour.  the only drawback is that they don't have any dessert or beverage section.

I visited the place today after reading the good reviews . I ordered chicken egg dosa. The texture of the dosa was soft not too crispy with a layer of egg inside, kind of mughlai paratha. The quantity if chicken inside was adequate, but it tasted normal dry lacking south Indian touch. Service was prompt, ambiance good, very neat and clean. I would visit this place again.

The concept of non veg dosa has always appeared oxymoronic to me! Hence, I was surprised to say the least, when my wife mentioned this place to me. 

To make non veg dosas one needs guts, not because how weird the dish might taste, but because of Mr. Quickgun Murugan!! This guy actually swore to defend the sanctity of dosas from the heretics!

Last Sunday evening, the ladies, missus n sister decided to go to this place. I, on other hand was a bit skeptical about this place! Obviously, I didn't want to waste my evening after some hashjaru type of dish but also the fear of Mr. Murugan stepping out of nowhere n  finishing me for daring to even try those heretic dishes, kept me at bay. But, then we were there (I'd take a chance against the wrath of Mr. Murugan rather than the ladies)
It is located right on the Sarat Bose road, adjacent to royal Lebanese , rather it's the previous paparazzi cafe renovated.
Nothing much to look at, the diner consists of two rooms with basic amenities like chair, table, photo frames etc.
We ordered a chicken cheese dosa and chicken dosa pizza.

The dosa arrived in no time. It looked like a normal dosa. However, slicing thru it's outer core when I reached the inner core I got the taste of its hashjaru origin. Instead of usual alu, curry leaves masala, it had chicken keema, cooked in South Indian style with grated cheese molten over it. It didn't taste as bad as I thought it would be. On the contrary, it tasted nice. Actually, the taste grew on me with every bite of dosa I had. But the con was that it was salty and soured a bit more. The dosa was accompanied by three chutneys, usual being the white one, the sambar had bit of twist to it and the 3rd being pudina. The twisted sambar was actually yum. Rating: 3.2/5

After the dosa, came the dosa pizza. No surprise for guessing, the dosa outer cover actually formed the base of the pizza. Only difference from usual pizza was that the base was super thin crust and had the usual sour taste of South Indian dosas. The topping was meaty, cheesy and accompanied by some veggies. It tasted nice, better than the dosa. 3.7/5

We packed a plate of sambar vada which was okay too.However, we terribly missed the coffee on the menu, which is a must after any kind off dosa. Hope they add it to the menu.
Overall, this place is simple but the dishes are quirky enough . This place confirms the age-old custom/moral of our city Kolkata i.e. you can do whatever the heck you want to do in here and we will be waiting for it with open mind, in this case with open mouth!!

PS it cost us 400 bux

The food here is really tasty as well as pocket friendly. Best suited for college group. Interesting part about here they serve a non vegetarian dosa. Interesting and nice concept.
They serve every meal with not only sambhar and coconut chutney but with also a green chutney and tomato chutney as well. It's a must visit for someone who is looking for pocket friendly place near Deshapriya park for quick snack or light meal.

The restaurant is located at Desapriya park, beside Zeeshan. Good ambience, the shop is small but very¬† clean and well decorated.You get different kinds of veg and non vegetarian dosas, idlis, pizzas here.

We ordered : Chicken¬† egg¬† & cheese dosa, Button idli in chicken curry and Chocolate dosa.

The chicken egg & cheese dosa was just too good and they served 3 kinds of chatni with it.
Button idli was very innovative, small pieces of idlis with curry leaves in a chicken broth with chunks of chicken pieces.
Chocolate dosa was crunchy, filled with caramel and chocolate, really yummy.
service was Quick and the staffs were Friendly.
Prices are also Reasonable as there are no additional taxes. 
Will surely visit again...

Heard a lot about this new place so decided to drop in. It's not extravagantly decorated but has a decent ambiance. We ordered
Chicken cheese dosa, chicken pizza dossa, egg mushroom cheese dosa. I loved the chicken pizza dosa most among all. It had thin crisp dosa crust topped with lots of meat and cheese. We were recommended to take CHOCOLATE DOSA . It turned out to be the hero. It had brownie and lots of nuts within it .oh my god! I am salivating even now writing about it .
There was no added tax. These guys just need to speed up their service. They make you wait a bit much but as u get the food you realise, it's worth the wait.
I would surely visit back for the chocolate dosa and the pizza dosa.
I would recommend this place to all dosa lovers as well as non dosa lovers. Drop in.

It's a small place, d√©cor was fine.
We ordered 5 different types of non-veg dosas. They were all well-prepared.
In the end, we ordered a chocolate dosa, which was absolutely lovely- all crispy and warm and chocolate-y (but not too sweet, which was the most important point for me), containing nuts and what seemed to be honey. A must-try, I would say.

As far as food is concerned, both of us have quite a few common weaknesses. And a well made dosa is definitely one of them. Unlike a typical Bengali, for whom Dosa means either plain or masala and definitely veg, we love non-veg dosas too. Be it the keema dosa or the plain ones with chicken or mutton curry (much like we eat rotis), we just love them. The problem is, there were no restaurants in Calcutta which served keema dosa and only one we knew of which served dosas and meat curries. Naturally we were more than happy when we heard about a new place serving exactly what we want.
                                                                ...

Location: Deshapriya park (in the direction of southern aveneue), squeezed in between Zeeshan and Royal Lebanese!

This is a small restro with minimal decor. Clean, simple and minimalistic stuff amplifies the available space. The washroom is super clean and the toilet ware is of superior quality.

Food ordered:
*Cheese masala rava dosa
* chicken pizza dosa
* button idli in chicken curry
* neer dosa with chicken curry

The cheese masala rava dosa was Awesome. It came with 3 chutneys and sambar . Filled with mozzarella cheese and potato mix, it was very delicious!

* chciken pizza dosa cut into 4 quarters and served with ketchup, was delish as well.

* for both the other dishes, the chicken curry was same. Very tiny pieces if boneless chicken cooked in a regular garam masala curry patta gravy. It was very funny, the kind you will wanna eat when you're sick.

The button idlis were just like mininature normal idlis, nothing special.

Neer dosa is typically made by churning the rice with coconut milk and making a watery thin batter, hence the name 'neer'( meaning water). Their neer dosa was perfectly soft and so tender. 4 pieces were served.

Service was ok. The guy gave us the notepad and asked us to write down our orders. And no added tax!

For the veg haters and veg South Indian food being pretty low in the activity charts, you have reasons to rejoice. 
Ordered cheese masala dosa, button idli in chicken keema, neer dosa and all of them were just amazing. The family loved it. Neer dosa in its traditional veg form tasted better as suggested by the owner. A very hospitable and sweet lady and you can trust her recommendation. 
A small non assuming place but one with a huge promise.  Would love to be back again soon.

Okay so if you are bored of the same conventional type of dosas, this is where you should go. This place, located in Deshapriya Park, serves dosa with a twist, as the name suggests. So I had visited this place with my friend. From the outside, it looks shabby but please don't estimate its standard from the look of the entrance, coz it is an entirely different world inside. We had ordered for Chicken Cheese Masala Dosa which came for 160 bucks and OMG it was heavenly! It is dosa stuffed with masala and chicken covered with a layer of cheese. They served 3 types of chutney along with the dosa and everything about the dish was perfect. Next we ordered for Onion Tomato Cheese Chilly Uttapam priced at Rs.120. Once again, this one was filled with cheese, and according to me looked similar to a pizza. It was the first time I tried Uttapam and I didn't like it much, so I guess Uttapam is not one of my favourite south indian dishes, but my friend loved it.
Service was pretty quick. And pricing is absolutely justified. Pocket friendly place, a must try.

The proprietor was present and offered us suggestions on the food. The best part was the food. We had ordered egg chicken mushroom masala dosa and mutton cheese dosa. But were awesome although my vote goes to the first one. We had chocolate dosa for dessert which was nice too. A pocket friendly place for good food.

A place which serves south Indian delicacies with a twist. Their speciality is non vegetarian dosas. 
#location: The place is easy to locate. Just beside the zeeshan of desapriya park.
#ambience: Small sitting area with good decor. Simple but graceful ambience. I liked d paintings on the walls. Nice cozy place.
#food: I had ordered chicken dosa, egg chicken Marsala dosa and button idlis in chicken curry.
The dosas were really tasty. The masala of the dosa was full of minced chicken. They server the dosa with three types of chutneys.
The button idli dish was really full of twist. It was slightly on the sour side. I juz loved it. A must try one I would say.
Staff: service was good, welcoming. 
Overall i had nice experience with pocket friendly yummy food.

Another place on my wishlist which I sas looking forward to for a long time...and another disappointment. Visited this place for a quick bite on a friday evening. The seating area is small bt well decorated. There's no waiter as such except for a small kid. Randomly ordered for a Manchurian veg masala dosa and  coffee. The dosa was served quickly but when we started eating,it tasted like plain masala dosa at any random dosa outlet. I was sure they had mixed up the orders.We called the person who served us to check that it's Manchurian dosa or not...he promptly said the order is correct. I was stumped...because it had nothing manchurian/chinese whatsoever. The coconut chutney was good. Bt sambar was bland and the spicy orange chutney tasted as if I'm having momo chutney. 
Now comes the worse part of our eating...The coffee was still pending...even after we finished our dosas. We went to check for it (as no waiter was available) & to my surprise saw they were making microwave-coffee. Finally the coffee arrived in a overflowing cup...it was watery and not hot at all. I could taste that the water was not even boiled,justed microwaved ! My whole point is...don't put something on your menu just for the sake of it. I will expect a decent coffee at Rs.30 and a plain masala dosa in tge name of Manchurian dosa at Rs.75 is just too much...! 
Never to return again !

This awesome place is a hidden gem i must say...thanks to Zomato..
Simple ambience with nice decor is pleasing..and indeed they serve dosas with unexpected mouth watering twist..the chicken cheese dosa was a treat to my taste buds..with generous amounts of chicken tossed in spices and veggies..bathed in cheese...the chatnis were good as well..the minty one was the showstealer..
The veg pizza dosa was somethimg unique and innovative..pizza with the crust of dosa was awesome..a tad bit sour only..fresh veggies and spices made it the dish of the day..
The chinese cheese dosa with chowmein stuffing was a bit off the track.i guess due to the previous megastars..
Good for apetite..extremely good for pocket..

went there with my family ...first of all its a really nice place at an affordable price. The food quality is good and the service is also prompt ....few things which they need to look into is the condiments which they serve like chutneys and sambhar should be made nicely..I felt it was little tangy.amd the chutneys little bland...tried the chicken as well as masala  dosage..Both were excellent ..but the keema pav needs improvement ....
will visit shortly..cheers

I‚Äôm a person of QUIRKY food; strange concoctions or bizarre fusions have always allured me. Dosa Twist with its concept of non-veg dosas had peeked my interest since its inception, I finally got a chance to try their food.

Dear Readers, if the concept intrigues you, then the food will definitely blow your mind!! This place is hands down the best dosa joint in the city. Well, you can't blame me, I'm a non-veg lover and a fan of innovative recipes!! 

WARNINGS: Do not expect the typical 'Madrasi' taste that you get at all the run-of-the-mill dosa places in the city. Go with an open mind.

I don't know why but looking at those paintings give me a feeling of calmness and positivity. The food is undoubtedly amazing but the ambience is more serene. My favourite out there is the pizza dosa. Do visit!

Yesterday I went to this place. 
I liked the decoration...it was very simple with some beautiful wall paintings.
The staff was polite.
We ordered
1.veg pizza dosa: we liked the fusion. The dosa was a bit thick with topping of mushroom cheese olive etc. 
2. Mango juice: they most probably outsource all the juices. But who cares!!!  It was perfect!

Price: I was very much satisfied with the price.. Our bill amount was just 170!

Last but not the least....their washroom! It was sparkling clean. Many outlets doesn't maintain their washrooms in proper manner...but when I went to the washroom.. I was amazed.. 
Surely Will visit again!

Want to have Dosa but tired of the same old kind? Think no more as this is your place to be. You get different kinds of veg and non vegetarian dosas, idlis, pizzas here. It is located at deshapriya park, beside zeeshan. A modest looking restaurant which hasn't spent a bomb on its appearance but tries to draw crowds with the power of its food. It's a very neat place where the hygiene factoris taken care of. The staff is helpful and informative. My patent order is chicken cheese dosa. However inspite of being a staunch non vegetarian I absolutely love the schezwan cheese masala dosa. The food is served promptly and hot. The size of the dosa is sufficient for one person. Highlight of this place is the brilliant chutneys. They serve you a green chutney, red chutney, the usual sambar and coconut chutney. You can ask for as many refills for the chutney as you want. It's very affordable and thus all the more popular amongst students.

Dosa@twist has come up with a menu that serves non-veg dosas. You will not be able to locate this place very easily. It is quite small and looks very shabby from the outside. The restaurant is located in deshopriya park in between two other food joints, Zeeshan and Royal Lebanese. The quality of food is really good. Chicken cheese dosa and button idli in chicken curry are my favourites! And also, if you're low on budget and want to eat to the brim, this is the place!

In this highly competitive world people are always aiming to excel in every field and this competition is no less in the food industry. In fact at present, in Kolkata the gastronomic scenarios are changing pretty rapidly and changing almost everyday with new restaurants opening up, while several others are closing down. There are several initiatives being undertaken, food walks taking place, new portals or food delivery apps coming up, new bloggers deciding to come up with their unique blog posts, food festivals going on, etc. In these times, to stay ahead in the competition there is only one weapon that can give you the acceleration, and that is ‚Äòinnovation‚Äô. And yes, my latest visit to an eatery only reminded me of this innovation factor. Many of us are familiar with the name, it is Dosa Twist at Desapriya park (beside Zeeshan). ¬†True to its name, the place offers some amazing twisted flavors of ordinary south Indian food items that you can probably only dream of, it has got chicken and mutton stuffing in the regular dosas or idlis, and more. Food and its flavor along with the innovation quotient is the biggest plus for this place and the sole reason why I am rating this place close to 4 out of 5. Let us discuss about the food a bit and derive the final rating from there. This was an invitation from my friend Tanwyee,¬†and I had ordered most of the items which she had already tried beforehand and found them to be pretty good. Though I wanted to try something in mutton but sadly mutton preparations were unavailable on that day.

I visited dosa twist with friends yesterday. It was located near desopriyo park. The place is small and cozy.There was varieties of dosa idli uttapam pizzadosa etc. We ordered 4 chicken cheese dosa, one egg cheese dosa, one achari masti dosa. It was given with 3 types chatni(red chilli, green, white) with sambar. Each dosa was tasty with mouthful of chickens. Sambar tastes yummy. At last we ordered two chocolate dosa which was too good.

It was a friend's treat & was supposed to be somewhere else.However the first one being yet not open for the day she proposed to kill the time at this one. Had already heard about their innovative experimental dosas, & me being an out & out dosa lover immediately agreed to the idea.
Location wise it was quite easy to find. From Deshapriya park crossing walk towards southern avenue, right beside 'Zeeshan' you'll find this outlet. A repurposed old residential building, if I'm not wrong, this seems a bit out of place that a south indian restaurant operates from some of the rooms. The air conditioned seating area seats around twenty five people.
Coming to the food we ordered the following items. Tried to order their mutton delicacies, which unfortunately weren't available.

1. Button Idli Chicken Curry:
We started the meal with this one. Small mini idlis & chunks of chicken immersed in a bowl of what seemed to be a variation of sambar Dal. However on tasting we found out although the curry leaves dominated the curry, it's far more spicier & oilier & undoubtedly tastier than regular saambar. The chicken pieces were bland to one of our friend's taste, I however found them quite soft & juicy & the curry gravy quite enjoyable with the button idlis.

2. Chicken Cheese Masala Dosa:
The next item to arrive at the table was a Chicken Cheese Masala Dosa. Well it was not as super sized as some south indian restaurants usually serve, but still was adequate for a single person. The filling comprised of mashed potato , veggies & minced chicken meat blended together along with generous amount of cheese. Generally other joints use grated cheese between the dosa & the filling, but here we found thin¬† noodles of cheese inside, & it was quite fun trying to bite the dosa in a pizza style.

3. Egg Mushroom Cheese Butter Masala Dosa:
To say the truth I didn't have anything in mind & ordered the highest priced dosa under the 'egg dosa' section , & thank God that I did. Coz unanimously this one was declared best of the lot. The button mushrooms covered in semi fried gooey eggs, the melting cheese all wrapped in a masala dosa which was fried in butter, it just had to be delicious. All of us liked this finger licking good item.

All in all this has to be the best south indian food I had lately. Of course that has something to do with my love for poultry, egg , mushroom & cheese. Really loved the idea of giving this non veg twist to the usual veg items. One more thing the dosas were so tasty, we just didn't touch the accompanying sambars & chutneys.

Will definitely visit again & recommend to my friends.
Till then happy eating,
Cheers,
Deep.

PS. The total bill came to be 390 rs which is quite pocket friendly if not dirt cheap. Surely another good reason to pay them a visit.

Have been  there yesterday, it's so close to  my home but never knew about these place and their huge variety of dosha, but after seeing zomato rating and reviews about this place we went and had chicken chese dosha and Mutton masala dosha and its just mouth melting.. I love the chicken chese dosha so much and it poured with a good amount of chicken and chese in it with that price range was amazing, Mutton masala  was too very tasty, their ambience was also very  good and they often come to ask  you  weather everything good or anything else would be needed.. And one of the amazing thing they  don't take service charges, you  have to only  pay the price you eat... So amazing place have dosha, love to visit more and want to taste their chicken pizza dosha which is well  known

A place for those¬† who want to try¬† Non-Veg South _Indian Dishes .Food quality and taste is too good. They have lots of varieties in their menu. But the most important thing is that u can customize the menu as per your choice. In fact some dhosa's are not mentioned in menu. They also have chocolate dhosa. I ordered Egg chicken baby-corn cheese and Egg chicken Schezwan dhosa. ¬† Both tastes good.

This place is simply wow. Located just beside zeeshan this is a small food joint with a very cosy interior and perect to hop in anytime. I went with my friend and we ordered a paper plain dosa and a chicken cheese dosa. The food is yummy and tasty. The service is excellent. The waitor who was serving us repeated chutneys for three times and thats too without any hesitation and indifference. Now coming to the quality of the food.. the filling of chicken cheese dosa was nice and heavy. Full of chicken and yummy cheese. The chutneys were simply awesome specially the orange one with a tinge of onion like smell. And i would recommend this place to everybody and myself will go again to taste something different. They have a plenty of options to much on.

So where I don't prefer veg much when it comes to eat outside, I discovered this place where we get Non-veg dosas. Thanks to Zomato. A pleasing ambience. Tried their mutton cheese dosa, butter masala dosa, chicken cheese dosa, etc. The chicken cheese dosa being my personal favourite. They serve an unique orange-coloured chutney which tastes excellent. Pocket-friendly too.

Aligned with the name, this restaurant truly gives you the fusion food with a homely atmosphere. Owner of this joint is a lady with a smile in her face, which makes you feel overwhelmed & if you are interested in some new experiments with your food, this should be your destination. I couldn't get to know the huge variations of dhosas, if I didn't came here.

Much contrary to the popular opinion, am not going to rate this outlet high. Having steered up the gastronomical kingdom of this city, this restaurant has been making quite a name for itself in the last few months. People has been talking about this, both online and in person. It was after reading a particular review here in Zomato, that I decided to hit up this place and see what the hype was all about!

Coming to the concept, they are not doing anything unique. During the initial glory days of City Center-I, Salt Lake, right beside where Mobile Store is located opposite to the tram, the place used to be occupied by a popular fusion restaurant then who had been serving the likes of fusion food, mainly pertaining to the cuisines prevalent in the southern part of our country. Although, it has been many years since they had shut down their business, I still remember how much of an ardent fan was I, and how eager I used to remain to hit up their restaurant atleast once in a week.

My favorite there being Chicken Manchurian Dosa, I have never had anything even remotely similar ever again in my life. Understandably, I had a little idea on what the buzz relating to Dosa Twist was all about and what was possibly in store for me. With the location being right next to Zeeshan, few metres away from the popular Maharani and opposite to the Kahani famed Monalisa Guest House, one needs to take a narrow lane to enter the restaurant. Try and not take the stairs unless you want to end up feasting on some Mughlai offerings.

The first thing which would strike you upon entering, is their neat and clean interiors. Absolutely no-nonsense decorations, clean white walls, with beautiful and large photo frames hanging upon it. The photographs may be of the mystical Monalisa or of any other awestruck figures. The size of them are very large and brings in a different kind of vibe altogether. Something, which can only be felt in person. The tables and chairs are wooden, and their color makes the perfect happy couple along with those of the walls. The place is tidy, neat and clean, giving you absolutely nothing, to complain about.

I immediately settled down, and ordered for a Chicken Cheese Butter Masala Dosa. It was not a prolonged wait and the food arrived in no time. It was a young lad, probably not even 18, who was serving me. First bite of the dosa, and I knew I was served a Chicken Cheese Dosa, insteaf of the Chicken Cheese Butter Masala one. Nevertheless, I decided not to create a fuzz and carry on with whatever I had received. The Dosa was crisp and gooey, but slowly turned into a sheer disappointment.

1) The Cheese wasn't of the highest quality. It was indeed more than sufficient in quantity creating a magical aura, but the quality befuddled me.

2) The outer top crust became quite hard in no time. Perhaps, the result of excess cheese and/or excess butter, whatever it or they was.

3) The chicken filling inside was sufficient in quantity but they were absolutely bland! If I were to simply pluck out the chicken portions and have it as a loner, I would first need to recook them. Hard, mushy and absolutely without any flavors, the boiled chicken pieces which goes into the Hakka Noodles, usually tastes better.

The savior of the day was the coconut chutney. Being so familar and used to the likes of Sambhar, this was the closest link I felt which one may have with Sambhar. The other two chutneys, Dhania Chutney and Tomato Garlic Chutney was just ordinary.

The saddest part of the day was when I wished to go to a washroom. I was directed to a room just beside the sitting area. Much to my dismay, it was a mini playground with a big glass on the front, perhaps to do make-up and all sort of nonsensical things and a washbasin in front. The actual bathroom/washroom/loo was locked out with a lock and a key. Dejected, perplexed and humiliated, I quietly came back, paid my bill and made my way out of that place.

I understand, there might be limitations. However, setting up a restaurant without a basic washroom is as big a sin as not having one in your own residence. The ambiance was sweet and simple, the sitting chairs were comfortable, the interiors were sleek, the behavior of the staff was courteous and humble. However, all these positives could not outshadow the negativity of the plain bland chicken and the locked washroom. With the concept not so new (atleast to me), 2.5, is the maximum rating I have to offer.

It's a tiny place near Deshopriyo Park crossing, comprising of two tiny rooms with a seating capacity of probably a dozen or so people. The interiors are nice, and not pretentious. The AC works fine, the lighting is good and the place is clean and that's more than enough for me.¬†The dosas are absolutely brilliant. We ordered the Mutton Cheese Dosa and the Chicken Achaari Dosa. The 'achaar' in the Achaari Dosa was pretty strong, and I'm not a fan of so much tang. Palettes might differ. The mutton cheese dosa was more to my taste, with the cheese brilliantly gooey, and the mutton perfectly smoky and tender. Mutton dosa is what dreams are made of.¬†
Chutneys were refilled often enough, without asking, and the fresh lime sodas were as good as they get. Overall, a good experience. At a really reasonable rate (hope they don't charge more).

Don't judge it from outside... it had a beautiful dine in space... just walk inside by the door just beside the counter... 

Staffs are courteous... but the service was pretty slow... although they said my ordered dishes are time taking... but then also it was quite a long wait...

My order...

1. Dahi vada... excellent one, soft and fresh vadas with good quantity of dahi and chutney, perfect combination...

2. Egg chicken dosa... good one, my mom and didi liked it to much, I felt it ok type as I'm not at all a dosa person...

3. Egg chicken cheese dosa... copy from above...

4. Kima pao... Now these one my mom and didi didn't liked at all, but it was awesome for me, I felt the keema curry quantity is huge in comparison with the quantity of pao...

5. Button idli in chicken curry... wow what a dish, totally innovative and gr8 in taste... a must try...

Over all a good experience... South Indian food lovers will surely love the place... 

Pocket pinch was very friendly...

2 of us visited Dosa Twist three days back at around 8 pm. The place, uninviting from outside turns out to be quite a find once you step in.

Location: Sarat Bose Road, a few metres away from the famed Maharani and right next to Zeeshan (closer to the Deshopriyo Park crossing)

Food: We ordered 1 upma, 1 fresh lime soda, 1 dhania plain dosa and 1 mushroom masala dosa between the 2 of us. The chutneys came in 3 varieties- orange, green and white, along with the sambar. Now coming to the food, the dosa size isn't exceptional but is enough for one person. When we asked for Neer Dosa we were met with disappointment. However, we started off with the fresh lime soda (average) and then moved on to the upma which too was accompanied by chutneys. Very average fare. Having lived in Maharashtra and the South, I sure know my upma. It was hot and piping leading to major expectations but ended up being quite a disappointment. Which good upma doesn't have a generous sprinkling of curry leaves and coconut I wonder. Next, the Dhania Dosa smelled authentic: I mean I could actually smell coconut oil, which I personally love- the mark of a good dosa. It was 70% crispy but could have been better. The chutneys were average and lacked the coconut-y freshness of the dhania dosa. The dhania  dosa was a 4/5 while the mushroom masala dosa was simply a 3. Inspite of having such an innovative menu, I wonder why this restaurant stuck to the regular 'aloo masala sabzi' when it came to the filling. They can create wonders by playing around with the masala stuffing I feel. Overall this place is a 3.5/5 because of the freshness and variety of menu and can be much better, if they focus on being as close to authentic South Indian food (which, mind you is sumptuous and caters to all palates very well) instead of serving the Bong version of the cuisine (albeit with a twist), which we are anyway so used to. 

Pocket Pinch: Only 280 INR for 2 people, thereby indicating that this place is a perfect idea for a quick bite, esp for college goers, working professionals and basically anyone looking for a healthier alternative to Roll, Chop, Cutlet. Please don't expect any phenomenal ambience here though. This place is functional and more than that with a very impressive menu. I wish they work on their food (by that I mean taste, since presentation and hygiene are good so far) a little more. 
I'll rate Dosa@Twist a 3.5 and would like to visit again!

This place deserves each and every point that I have given it.
A friend recommended this place to me, so went here today on a date.
We were blown over by the ambience and decor when we entered, it was so tastefully done up.
We zeroed in on a chicken mushroom masala dosa and an egg cheese dosa. Both tasted BRILLIANT. It was perfectly balanced in terms of taste and impeccable in terms of presentation. 
The owner herself was present and was quite interactive with suggestions. 
The service too was quite prompt, with the waiter refilling our glasses of water and our bowls of chutneys without even being asked to do so.
Definitely visiting again and will be unabashedly promoting them :)

Who would have thought non veg and dosa would be a good combination, thanks to people at dosa twist its now possible. Simply loved the food. The people at dosa twist took the mundane dosa breathe a new life into it. The place is very clean and decor is good too, bonus points for that.
Would definitely love to revisit this place.

After waiting for a long time¬†finally, we went to this place. From outside it does not look much but ¬†once you follow¬†the narrow corridor to the dining room you will be impressed. The room is exclusively well decored with just the right amount of everything. I loved the hanging clock especially.
We ordered chicken cheese dosa as it promised to contain two of my favourite things and they kept their¬†promise. The dosa was crunchy enough, the butter option would have been crunchier. It was stuffed with only chicken kima¬†mingled with melted cheese. It was very much filling. The chutneys were a hit especially the green one!!
The brilliant idea of fusing Dosa with nonveg filling made me very much excited. The staff was very helpful and nice people. The owner¬†herself took our suggestion and asked about the food. We really forgot to ask her name but would like to thank her for twisting this great opportunity.

The name justifies the menu card. Its got a VARIETY with a TWIST definitely. We had visited this place earlier and had schezwann chicken dosa, which tasted great. Today we ordered chicken cheese dosa and chocolate uttapam. The dosa was yet again beautiful and the uttapam had an unique sweet and tangy taste to it which just makes a nice blast with the taste buds. The place is very cosy and homely, with warm decorations. Would love to make it a regular spot. :D

First off, I would like to start off with the fact that this place gave Kolkata something that we all needed, a refreshing perception about the delectable South Indian cuisine. The mental image of non-veg dosas crammed with cheese is enough to get anyone drooling.
INTERIORS: Not a strong point of this joint. This place has replaced a hookah parlour which went out of business. Anyways, anyone who is going to the joint for the first time will think it to be just a take-away place. The indoor air-conditioned seating area is difficult to find out. On the way to the seating area, there is a kinda bad smell in the air. However, inside, the place is wonderful. Good lighting accompanied by gigantic paintings.
SERVICE: For a fast-food joint, the service was quite good. The best thing about South Indian eateries is that you keep on getting refills of the chutneys and the sambar daal. The waiters take good care of you. They even don't miss the small things like filling water into the glass when it is even half empty. So you know you won't be disappointed.
FOOD: Coming to the best part of this restaurant, the food is amazingly good and cheap. I went there twice and tried the chicken and cheese dosa (‚Çπ130), the corn and cheese dosa (‚Çπ100) and the plain cheese dosa (‚Çπ80). The corn was babycorn and not the normal one. The amount of cheese in the dosas is enough to justify your expenditure. The corn and cheese dosa was really good, and so was the plain cheese dosa, with oodles of cheese. However, the showstopper was the chicken and cheese dosa. The filling in the dosa will make you think you can't have enough of it. The dosas were accompanied by threw different types of chutneys, the traditional coconut one, a mint chutney, and a special red chutney that is a recipe of the restaurant. The vegetarian dosas were accompanied by sambar dal. The sambar was the best I have ever tasted, and believe me, I have tasted quite a lot of that. I felt thankful to the restaurant for keeping the sambar as an unlimited accompaniment. I had three helpings of it. Coming back to the dosa, it was perfectly cooked, crunch, yet soft, and gooey cheese all over.
Kolkatans, if you want to have some of the best and most fulfilling fast food you have had in a while, I earnestly urge you to try this restaurant. Believe me, you will love it.

I had been patiently waiting for a dosa joint to open doors in Kolkata which would have Non veg dosa options. There was one restaurant which did come up with Chettinad cuisine and was located near Kalikapur. Unfortunately it did not do well and shut operations before I could try it. Then came Dosa Twist with similar items to offer. Hence I instantly decided to try it out. Thanks to the incessant heat outdoors, I decided to order in. I used the online order facility of Zomato to order a Chicken Cheese Dosa and a chicken mushroom dosa. The order was placed on a busy saturday evening around 9.45Pm and arrived at my residence (around 2Kms away) at 11pm. The wait was quite long but thats natural on a busy Saturday evening. The dosas were nicely wrapped in multiple layers of newspaper. Although, I would prefer a foil wrapping to keep the freshness and crispness intact. The Dosas were warm and well stuffed with chicken keema. My pick of the two would definitely be the cheese chicken pizza. It tasted yum and filling. The accompanied chunteys/dips were pretty good to taste but the sambar was missing. Overall a refreshing change to the usual south indian fare and a welcome one. Probably I should visit the joint and try the other items piping hot to better judge the entire experience. As of now a decent 3.5 for Dosa Twist

Dropped by this charming little place today that undoubtedly serves the widest variety of dosas. We tried the Chicken Cheese Dosa - which provides us with the winning combination of chicken and cheese. Every bite was delicious! We then tried the Chicken. Pizza Dosa, which was a bit of a disappointment.

Went out for dinner with my friend.
Ratings as per my views would go like :
Ambiance : 4/5
Food: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5

I would give it a plus point to the ambiance. How gracefully the owner designed such a small place with a neat touch of sitting arrangements and paintings. The space is small for which there is very less sitting areas. But however it is, its very nice and cozy.
Food: My god their innovation on variety of dosas. I must say that am impressed. We had Chicken dosa. Seems like I will go back again to try each and every item in the menu.
Tastes perfectly awesome with right taste of the side sauce and chatnis to go along with the dosa. I am not a very big fan of dosa honestly.. but this is something I would love definately. 
Service was good also. It was quite early for dinner, so they took time to prepare the food which is perfectly ok. But service is very prompt and polite.
Its definately a many times visit place. Guys do check in and taste their awesome innovative dosa platters.
Happy eating ! :)

I was never too fond of South Indian food, but one look at the menu and I knew I HAD to visit this place as soon as possible. This is probably the only place in Kolkata where you get dosa with egg, chicken, mushroom, babycorn, cheese and whatnot! So, on a warm evening of an ephemeral Spring, we went out to experience our share of this awesomeness. ¬†

Dosa Twist being right near the Deshapriya Park and Sarat Bose Road crossing, was extremely¬†easy to locate. Its a small, nicely decorated and clean restaurant having two tiny rooms with 2 tables each. The menu card really, really spoils you for choice, making you utterly confused and almost pushes you to the verge of ordering every item on offer. We took some time to overcome all of that and settled for Fried Idli with Cheese and an Egg Chicken Cheese Masala Dosa.¬†

The food came in together and within 10 minutes. There were around ten slices of the fried idli in a bowl, nicely laced with a lot of cheese. They were served piping hot and crispy, with 4 different accompaniments; sambhar, coconut chutney, a red paste and pudina chutney. I took the first bite without any dip and later decided that to be the best way to eat it as then, the original flavours are not tampered with. A molten network of cheese mingled with the slight sourness of the idli and topped with a super crunchy texture was no less than perfection melting in my mouth. It tasted fine with all the dips as well.¬†

Now, the dosa was another exceptionally lovable riot of flavours. A crispy thin dosa was first coated on the inside with an egg and then a layer of cheese, followed by a filling of a rich masala made of chicken keema. The masala was pure bliss and there was absolutely nothing that could've made it taste any better. Again it was accompanied by the same 4 dips. All of the dips individually tasted perfect and I loved them all.¬†

The nice person who was serving us, made it a point to come by our table every few minutes to refill the bowls of chutney and dips, which I really liked. ¬†This is a place where I would love to go back to again and again. Firstly because I want to have so much more from this place. Secondly, any place that serves yummy food at reasonable prices, wins my heart. :)

The location of this restaurant is very convenient for any visitor though it is unexpectedly difficult to spot. Its a small place but well lit, clean and sufficiently decorated. A south indian place has never impressed me more. We ordered the chicken achari masti dosa and loved it. the chatnis along with it were absolutely on point and went very well with the dosa. The dosa was adequately stuffed with spicy tangy chicken. The menu has a huge spread covering mutton chicekn paneer egg and veg dosas of many varieties.
Looking forward to going back there again soon.

What a place! Simply wow! Well they have literally taken their name seriously to really good results. They boast of some of the oddest combinations when it comes to dosas and bring out some lip-smacking dishes on our plates.

The place is located diagonally opp to deshapriya park, along with Zeeshan (a little hard to spot though). It is actually a residential building. The seating area is situated well inside the building. It is a small 24 seater, air conditioned, well lit and decorated with paintings all over the walls. I personally liked the tables. 

After another interview, me and my friend(a pure veg) were famished. The reviews on Zomato convinced us to take this (food) adventure. We ordered Veg Schezwan cheese masala dosa and Egg Chicken Masala dosa. Superb preparations, very tasty. They might appear to be small but the filling is quite generous in quantity. I had only dreamed of these weird combinations, but having them was equally satisfying. The dosas come with Sambhar, green coriander chutney, coconut chutney and a red chutney probably of chilli and garlic. All of them equally good, green being my pick. It went well with the nonveg stuff. We also ordered hot coffee (not on menu), at just 30 bucks. You wud not hesitate to pay more for such good coffee.

Quality food and very reasonable pricing give you a satisfactory food adventure. The service is decent. We arrived around 4pm, so it was relatively empty. The owner ms/mrs MoonMoon is a lovely lady to talk to. We had a short conversation about the place, and she even gave us suggestions on what to have. 

Thumbs up to the concept. Will be back here soon. Best wishes to Dosa Twist and Get well soon ms/mrs Moonmoon (she had broken her left leg).

The entrance is a bit modest but the small cozy dining area is really pretty..the walls are adorned with famous da vinci paintings and the lighting is perfect for a wonderful selfie :P
This place has the widest variety of dosas you would find anywhere..at the most affordable prices too

I've had chicken cheese masala, egg schezwan cheese masala and egg mushroom cheese masala so far...all three were par excellence..as is the service.
But whatever you order do not omit the cheese...they serve you more than a standard pizza brand's cheese burst pizza :p

Looking forward to future visits :)

This place is located near Deshpriyo Park, just beside Royal Lebanese. The place is clean, but a little small, I guess it's just a 20 seater. 
Coming to the food. We tried a plate of idli, onion vada, mushroom dosa and onion rava masala dosa.
The food was pretty basic. They serve three kinds of chutneys which are pretty good. The best thing which I liked was onion vada.
In this area there are several other joints which serve better South Indian.

I've been here quiet a few times. A small clean place on southern avenue when your craving fusion dosas!! My favourites here are the idli upma... The mutton keema dosa which is a little more spicy than I like it, the chicken cheese dosa which is amazing. The lady who owns the place would always greet you with a smile and help you order. I tried the mutton pau bhaji which was just ok :) the service is quick and I would keep going back.

The restaurant is situated very close to desapriya park,on sarat bose road,on the ground floor or Zeeshan and beside Royal Lebanese. very neat and clean place. nice decor,cozy ambience and more importantly clean washrooms.

Coming to food,we ordered egg masala Dosa,cheese chicken masala dosa,cheese mushroom plain dosa and mutton keema pao.
All dosas came with 3 chutneys and sambhar.the dhania chutney was tasty,coconut chutney was average,but the tomato onion chutney was wonderful,sweet and hot at the same time.We ordered a refill twice.

The chicken cheese masala was the tastiest with stringy cheese and full of chicken keema and some tasty masala.Its a must have.

The mushroom cheese dosa was also yummy.The plain dosa doesnot have the porato filling along with the chicken/mushroom etc.if you feel like eating light order the plain versions,the masala dosas are really filling.

The egg dosa was good but not greart.the egg and potato made the dosa less crisp. however it is a matter of personal taste.

The keema pao is basically a pao bhaji with the bhaji made with mutton keema.It was very tasty,but the bhaji could have been a bit more spicy.

We will be definitely visiting again.

Undoubtedly a twist in the usual South Indian restaurants with unorthodox food served at this place. It stands neck to neck with other south indian restaurants like Tamarind, Banana Leaf, etc.

You would find a hard time in choosing one or two dishes among the plethora of options available.

After much delay, we finally ordered a Veg Scheswan Cheese Masala Dosa,Egg chicken Masala Dosa, Button idli in chicken curry and Cheese Fried Idli (must have).

The presentation was excellent. The platter included three varieties of chutneys (coconut, dhaniya and tomato garlic) and sambhar which were tasty.

Scheswan cheese masala dosa was delicious with ample amount of cheese added to the base.

The egg chicken masala stood as the favorites one among the non vegans.

Button idli was a very unusual dish consisting of mini idlis with chicken curry and turned out to be delicious.

Fried cheese Idli topped my charts. Nicely Fried and abundant cheese added a soft texture to the dish.

Edit: During my second visit at this place we tried the Cheese Pizza Dosa ans I must say I became a fan straight away. Cheers.

The place demands expansion in terms of seating capacity and number of staffs as the service slows when the place is crowded.

P.s: Its economical and a must visit.

It is not possible to get better than this place! This is the kind of place that the city needs. It takes up minimal space but can accommodate almost 20-25 people. The decor is soothing and has an aesthetic appeal. The place takes simple traditionally vegetarian South Indian dishes and adds chicken and mutton to them! What can get better than that! The place gets the fusion of South Indian cuisine and Continental cuisine absolutely right. The Mushroom Cheese Chicken dosa was amazing. The dosa pizza with a base of fluffy dosa with toppings of cheese, chicken, babycorn, mushroom and olives was a creative idea and tasted great. The quantity of chicken in each dish was extremely satisfying. The service was prompt with an attentive waiter who offered multiple helpings of the delicious chutneys. Amazing amazing!

Dosa twist is a new addition to Calcutta's food scenario. For the ones who crave for non veg south Indian food and are bored with Tamarind and Ammini, here comes a new and pocket friendly option!

Dosa twist is located just beside Zeeshan, opposite desapriya park. The seating area can accommodate around 15-20 people. The decor is fine. There is a sun shaped mirror and some paintings hung on the walls which doesn't match with the south indian theme of the place. The good thing is that the place is air conditioned !!

Coming to the food, we ordered for a veg schezwan cheese masala dosa, egg chicken masala dosa, button idli in chicken curry and fried idli with cheese.

First came the veg schezwan cheese masala dosa. The dosa was crisp and the masala filling was good too with generous amounts of cheese. With it, were provided three chutneys - the coconut chutney, a dhania chutney and a tomato garlic chutney, accompanied by sambar! All of them were equally good.

Next came the egg chicken masala dosa. It looked similar to the veg one, except that it was cut into half. It was stuffed with a brilliantly tasty egg and chicken keema masala. A new twist to the normal dosa which left me crazy. I could never imagine such a taste out of a south Indian dish. Highly recommended!

Next there was button idly with chicken curry. It was served in a huge bowl with chicken curry containing three pieces of chicken and 15 button idlis. The gravy was spicy and sour and the chicken well cooked.

Lastly, we had fried idly with cheese. This was suggested by a lady who might be the owner of the restaurant. And, excellent it was!! Cheese was given in generous amounts and we liked it!

Surprisingly, our bill was just 435 bucks. The prices in the menu are inclusive of taxes. It was a great meal and I would love to be here again !

Dosa served with non-vegetarian curry is an age old non-Brahmin culinary tradition practised all over South India by various communities - Coorgis from Karnataka love their dosa with pork curry, the Nairs from Kerela eat appams with Beef masala, and multiple communities across South India, relish a meal of dosa (ranging from neer to nadan to other varieties), with a hearty bowl of chicken or mutton curry.

Of course, the dosa+nonveg combo, unlike its vegetarian counterparts, didn't spread beyond South of the Vindhyas and that is where Dosa Twist made a first move to fill up the gap and introduced a whole new array of dosa/idli in chicken/mutton curry combo to a predominantly non-vegetarian food demography. It's a smart move, of course, given that there is an abundance of vegetarian options in the somewhat saturated and already competitive vegetarian South Indian food market in Calcutta.

The Egg Chicken Masala Dosa we had today was excellent, with egg chicken masala stuffed inside of a soft and crisp Dosa. Button Idlis, served in a bowl of chicken curry with two whole pieces of chicken, was also good.

The Schezuan masala dosa in the vegetarian options was a really good vegetarian dosa, except that I didn't find any Schezuan-ish taste to it. Fried Idlis, topped with cheese and served like French Fries, was a delight to have - after all, what can be more comforting than anything deep fried, served with cheese ?

Dosa-s here come accompanied with an assorted collection of three chutneys - the standard coconut chutney, a fresh coriander chutney and a really wonderfully spicy tomato-garlic chutney, which is a standard chutney served at least with Chettinad cuisine, but often not served universally with Ildlis and Dosas. Of course, I liked it, like I do, for anything tangy + spicy. However, for non vegetarian dosa combos, I would like it if it were served with raita + salan. 

All in all, Dosa Twist is a wonderful addition to the Calcutta food scene. Even though a vast majority of its menu is South Indian food, Dosa Twist has done a great job by substantially customising it for the local palette - for example, the Egg Chicken Masala inside the Dosa, even though inspired by the masala of Chettinad Kotthu Paratha, wasn't overpowered by the pepper and curry leaves as in the original recipe and the Chicken Curry in which the button curry came dunked, was a wonderful version of very Bengali Sunday chicken curry.

The prices, inclusive of service tax, are very pocket friendly. However, a slightly prompter service will help. The ambience is pretty neat for a pocket friendly place, though I wish the paintings of Mona Lisa and Lady with the Ermine by Leonardo Da Vinci weren't hung around randomly with a bunch of Indian paintings.

In short, should you visit ? A big yes !

A very small joint beside the royal lebanese counter of sarat bose road near deshapriya , a narrow shabby lane leading to a small room , airconditioned , well lit and decorated with wall paintings and having basic wrought iron seatings.
The 1st time ever we tried non veg dosas .CHICKEN BUTTER MASALA DOSA and MUTTON MUSHROOM MASALA DOSA . I liked them being a hardcore non vegeterian , the three carrot coconut and coriander chutneys were killers , and they come without the regular sambar.Everything was nice , just felt its Slightly overpriced.

Dosa twist is what we got attracted to and not just "Dosa". Being a bengali I wont mind adding pieces of meat anywhere. So entry to the place was not so overwhelming as there are a lot of resturants, joints on the same building. Easy to locate as its right on the main road. Interiors are kept simple and sober with some beautiful paintings. Coming to the food. I was very suprized to see a 14 year old kid taking order, This is a request to the owner/ management of the Dosa twist not to entertain kids as waiters no matter whatever the reason might be. Ordered for egg cheese dosa which was "okay", the cheese given was absolutely mouth watering however my feedback is something was missing. Considering Udipi stone throw distance Dosa twist might have to pull up their socks to attract more customers. All the best and please no child labour.

A small place in Deshapriya Park located just beside Zeeshan. If you want to try something new, you should definitely visit this place. I had a Chicken Cheese Dosa. It was good with a generous amount of chicken, and the chutneys were good as well. Service does take a fair amount of time as everything is freshly prepared. Not that expensive as well.

Yes i have given it 5 for it deserves a 5. Yesterday went there to have their dosa. I already had an idea regarding the non veg dosas they serve. I was a bit unsure of the taste of the dosa. I did experiment them. When i entered the room i was like its gorgeous. The way the owner decorated the room was totally amazing- pictures of Mona Lisa ,Mary Lamb ,Mirror ,an Antique Wall Side Clock.One will feel so relaxed and comfortable.Coming to the food tried the masala dosa and my boyfriend tried the chicken masala dosa. And later we tried manchurian cheese dosa.

Masala Dosa- damn yummy. I mean its sooooooo delicious. The filling is sooo good

Chicken Masala Dosa- chicken in dosa? Well thats quite a new thing. I had a lil bit of it. My god it was soo beautiful. That south indian flavour with a punch of chickhen. Wow. Absolutely awesome.

Manchurian Cheese Dosa- i loved this dosa. The chef has very beautifully combined the tangy south indian flavour, the chinese manchurian flavour with cheese. Definately represents art of food. The cheese was soo good. Its mah favourite dish. It is totally a sinful food to indulge in.

The chutneys- 4 flavourful delicious chutneys. My favourite is the green spicy chutney and the tomato one. The sambar was sooo good. Its yummmmy yummmmy yummmmy

And guys the most important thing,there is no tax. üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ

Ambience- 5
Service- 5
Quality- 5
Quantity- 5

So one must try the Manchurian Dosa. Dosa lovers please do give a visit to this place. I will definately come here to try more of its variety.

Can be easily found between Zeeshan and Royale Lebanese near Deshapriyo Park. The decors are simple. I ordered a cheese chicken dosa which cost around 160/-. I won't say its bad but still not that good too compare to price. The service and behaviour was pretty awesome.

Sitting snug between Royal Lebanese and Zeeshan,on the lane right opposite Deshopriyo Park,Dosa Twist caters to those very fantasies that you wrongly assume can never be realised. We headed in, repeating what we would order out loud to each other lest the extensive choices on the menu muddle us further. But then we overheard the manager suggesting a certain Keema Pao to a couple of diners and of course we had to have that stat. The Keema bit of the dish did not disappoint as the meat chunks were infused in a bit too generously. A set of two sinfully buttered Paos is what you get with each dish but you can always ask for more as the manager told us to. And ask we did.
As the friend we were waiting for while having spoonful after spoonful of the Keema, arrived, it took us a total of 30 seconds to place our order for the Dosas to the ever-hovering-at-arm's-length waiter. When the three dishes arrived each armed with green and coconut chutneys and a take on sambar dal placed around the Dosas,we couldn't help but stare and sigh. The beauties are stuffed excessively with whatever preparation of the meats that catch your fancy and are cut down the middle, a thoughtful gesture as you can pick up a portion and get right down to business without having to work your way through the ends. Or it might have been done for the purpose of giving the other half to whoever accompanies you without you having to make a sloppy mess on your plate. I think not. We got ourselves a Chicken Achari Masti Dosa, an Egg Chicken Mushroom Dosa and A Chicken Cheese Dosa. And no we couldn't have possibly polished our plates off but yes we did. They even refill the chutney bowls quietly and deftly just how we preferred. Though the Dosas are crispy and fine, the oil seeping out of the stuffing can make it a tad bit soggy but that is just a minor quibble since the filling in itself was a total knock out. Achari Chicken had bits of pickled mango in it. Yes, you read that right. Cheese Chicken was tough to eat as the liquid cheese that kept oozing with every bite messed with our make up. First world problems. The Egg Mushroom Chicken had exactly that.
Dosa Twist left us giddy and our wallets only partly empty (the 4 dishes amounted to just over 500) .
A shoutout to the tasteful d√©cor and the station clock that stands out from the rest of the furniture. You wouldn't be able to tell how pretty it is inside if you stand on the pavement gawking at the shabby doorway,contemplating your visit. Walk in and come out smiling.

Located beside the Zeeshan outlet at deshopriyo park, this is one of the quirkiest joints I have eaten at (dosa meets chicken and mutton. Wow!). The place is small and the decor is minimalistic. But the food is really good. We ordered 3 things - Chicken egg dosa, Chinese dosa and egg babycorn dosa. They were yummy and filling. Pocket pinch - just 300! Perfect place for snacking. Definitely coming back. 
P.S. VAT free!!

Discovered the place the week it opened and I have had their food many a times since then !!

Their menu range is very new and exciting.
(Hello? Chicken. In dosa??)

Had their wide range of veg dosas - cheese dosa, mushroom cheese dosa, paneer butter masala dosa, masala dosa and ofcourse the sada dosa.

I liked most of them, but the Paneer butter masala dosa was EXTREMELY oily.

I really like their Rava Dosa and the cheese onion utappam!

Waiting to try their chicken dosas :D

there are places which try to do something different and in maximum times they are not all that successful. well Dosa Twiist is not one of those places. one thing is for sure. whoever set up the menu has tried each and every variation which is available and they have been changed and twisted to give you a ride in a weird way. the chutneys served by them are of 3 kinds... the normal coconut chutney... the dhaniya chutney and a spicy red chutney.... all 3 tastes are spot ¬†on for me and they were tasting pure and fresh. their idlis are soft and did not look that they have been reheated or otherwise. now coming to the dosa.... so a person who really likes pure south indian i was a like sceptical after seeing the menu... cause there is like weird dosas available... but trust me the taste is pretty good and is fun to have something like the the mushroom cheese dosa or others... i can say one thing their paper dosa though small was spot on and the masala dosa the masala was really good... the only thing that i did not like too much was the samber as it was on a sweeter side... though tasty samber is supposed to be spicy and tangy.... the place they make you sit inside there was no noise but the waiter and the owner were talking in such loud tones that it hampered the peaceful nature of the place... ambience wise they have big paintings of buddha and the last supper and all which makes it nice... they were clean as well... all in all if you are feeling adventurous do give this place a try... great fusion food.

Dosa Twist is an absolute delight for a dosa lover.. It is situated near Deshapriya Park crossing, just beside Zeeshan.. The ambience here is good with large painting on white walls, wooden tables and iron chairs.. They have a large variety of dosas and innovative ones too.. I tried a non-veg dosa (mutton dosa) for the first time here and I highly recommend this.. They serve dosas with sambar and three type of chutneys - coconut, coriander and carrot.. The service is moderate and the budget is reasonable.. Overall, this place is a must visit for a dosa lover..

The decor is very english..classy beautiful paintings,an antique clock and a sun shaped mirror makes people gaze
Now coming to the food quality..this place makes outstanding dosas.superb quality.superb taste.superb variety for both veg and non veg lovers
I had the Manchurian Masala Cheese dosa.
The dosa was very crispy.It had a very generous amount of cheese.The masala tasted great.I loved the dosa so much that I took one home for my mother.They really know how to parcel food.The dosa was still very crispy.
It came with 3 chutneys and all of them were lip-smacking.The sambar was good too.Overall I was very pleased.
Try it out.Its fantastic

It is a small place but I like the simple yet chic look that promises of innovation and creative dishes. Dosa Twist keeps the promise. 
With generous amounts of mozzarella and chicken, the chicken dosas come in two halves. It is delicious. The mutton keema is tasty too though it is a lot more other things than mutton - did not exactly love that.
The owner is a nice lady and she helped us make our order.
However, a little boy serves the food, brings you water, and takes away the dishes, which is really sad. That is one thing I did not like about the place. And the boy works during the afternoon as well as night, so, it is not just that he earns in his free time. In the 21st century, I cannot support this.

I recommend:

Dosa is one of my favourite food and I am lucky that I have finally found Dosa twist through Zomato. Dosa twist is located near Deshapriya park crossing and beside Zeeshan. Now about food, I ordered "Egg Chicken Cheese Masala Dosa" and "Chicken Pizaa Dosa". The taste of the "Egg Chicken Cheese Masala Dosa" was just out of the world, ridiculously good,first time tasted something different. They served it with 3 different types of chutneys. The fist two was coconut and coriander chutneys but I didn't understand the taste of third one but it was little bit sour .They didn't serve any Sambar with it but it was okay with supplied chutneys. Now about "Chicken Pizza Dosa", it was little bit sour side but the size was very big, personally I don't like too much sour so it was little bit disappoint for me but overall experience was good. They have proper dine in facility with extraordinary ambiance.

Dosa had never been a food item which I really liked- it had always been an item which I would have once in a while, mostly for a change of taste. But things changed since I joined sishumangal hospital as a resident and came to know of this eatery. The name says it all, and the twist is a pure bliss. 
I tasted nonveg dosa for the very first time here, and since then I had been regularly ordering home delivery. Chicken cheese, chicken mushroom n babycorn and mutton cheese dosa are my personal favourites. They make a brilliant keema pao too. 
Would love some more of such lovely twists in future. Highly recommended.

Locate the door between Royal Lebanese and Zeeland just off Deshapriya Park crossing towards Sarat Bose road. Walk in to find a surprisingly nicely decorated well lit up place. The seating furniture is modern and sleek with black wood topped tables and wrought iron chairs. The walls are white and decorated with large framed paintings. I have no idea about footfalls but when I went out was empty. The specialty of the place is non-vegetarian dosa and some fusion dosa. I was intrigued by the concept yet was a bit put off by the idea of chicken or egg or Mutton inside dosa, so being moderately adventurous I ordered a vegetarian schezwan cheese plain dosa and opted to pack a plain rava cheese dosa. 
Dosa was on the smaller side but apart from the sambar and the regular white coconut Chutney there was a green (quantity was minuscule and it was hugging the bottom of the bowl) and a red chili and carrot Chutney. Sambar did not taste good, was on the bland side and the vegetables were diced too big for my liking as well as for the bowl for that matter.  The coconut Chutney was good and so was the green  one, but the red Chutney had a funny taste I did not e joy. The dosa was nicely crisp with generous coating of schezwan paste I side which was more sweet than spicy. Cheese was of generous quantity and pleasantly stringy. 
Prices are quite reasonable considering portion and quality. But when I came home I was disappointed to find that they have packed a plain rava dosa without any cheese despite having been charged a rava cheese plain dosa.  The rava dosa tasted nice and crispy with generous smattering of coriander seeds,  jeers and coriander leaves. They had packed generous amounts of all three Chutneys as well as sambar. But i still could not get over the fact that despite ordering and being charged for the cheese variant I received something else. I don't know if this was an honest mistake or was deliberate, but it's disappointing none the less. 
If you are feeling brave do try the non-vegetarian dosas. I for the time being is not planning to visit this place in near future.

Undoubtedly one of the best South Indian joints in the city, Dosa@Twist offers a huge variety of dosas to choose from. The unconventional Non-Veg dosas are their speciality. During my 2 visits I have tried the Chicken Cheese Dosa, Mutton Dosa and the Egg Cheese Dosa. Each one was a unique experience to my taste buds. The chicken and mutton dosas come with generous portions of meat and cheese ones have enough gooey cheese for one's complete satisfaction. It is a pocket-friendly place with a wonderful ambiance. Service is good, the waiters are very polite. A must visit for all the South Indian food lovers and people who wish to experiment something very unique.

I love dosas. So coming across this place was the best thing that could happen to me after a crazy day of shopping. I ordered a cheese masala dosa and it came with 3 types of chutneys and sambhar. The cheese was perfectly melted and incorporated in the masala and the best thing about this was the sambhar. Whenever i order a dosa i tend to skip on the sambhar because they make it soggy and heavy and not at all tasty but Dosa Twist made the best sambhar i ever had. And we also got a Chili Tomato Onion Uttapam which is equally filling and delicious. Their quantities are good and so is the presentation. I remember when it opened almost a month back or i had ordered Upma and that was delicious and filling and 2 people can easily fill their stomach with the quantity they gave and mind you, this place is pocket-friendly as well :) And thumbs-up to their service.Thanks

The thing about experimental cuisine is that it gives you a first in market advantage, and people like to satiate their curiosity. Indeed they come to try, but more often than not they pledge to not try it again‚Äì hence this explains my take on Dosa twist. 

I would like to applaud their courage to try out a plethora of different sorts of dosas, colluding chinese and what not with the evergreen south indian staple. It is not at all awful, rather if you consider it as a different entity and try to subdue your 'south indian' memories off your brains, maybe, just maybe you might end up liking it. As for me, I'm glad that I tried their chicken dosa and pizza dosa but yeah I would like to stick to dosas as they are, and I'm one of those who tried but never went back. Cheers!

One of the must visit place for all south indian food lovers. The place has a large varities of dosa's. Infact it was the first time i heard of non-veg dosa's. The place is situated near deshapriya park more just beside zeeshan. They have a nice sitting arrangement. The place is very well decorated with beautiful paintings. Previously they didnt have a sitting arrangement and people had to stand outside and eat but now they have added a restaurant to eat. The owner is very friendly and if you cant decide on a dosa she will suggest you among their specialities. 

We ordered for a cheese masala dosa and a masala dosa. The cheese masala dosa was just faboulous (among the best dosa's that i have ever eaten) . It had cheese stretching out of it with ever bite that i took. The masala dosa was also great. A big dissapointment was that most of the times they do not have sambhar vada and idli. 

Overall its an amazing place to eat for all dosa lovers. Do not underestimate it by its looks, the food is really worth going for.

This dosa outlet is simply unbeatable. It offers incredible value for money. It's located just beside Zeeshan , Deshapriya Park . I had the Chicken Dosa here which was served fresh and hot reasonably fast . The stuffing was plentiful and thankfully with a lot of chicken. The people were friendly and well-mannered too . It is a great place for an evening snack but the only thing that's missing is a proper covered dining area.

Went here on the recommendation of a friend. We ordered Chicken cheese babycorn and Chicken butter masala dosa. By mistake we were served a cheese masala dosa but the owner acknowledged the error and asked us to have it as well! 

Food was amazing. Very well prepared and taste wise was fabulous. Just a suggestion to the owner to allow an option of having white sauce/mayo/mustard sauce with the non veg dosas as the chutneys were not that good as an accompaniment with the dosas. Also, the sambar was a bit diluted but tasted good nonetheless. 
The owner is a very gracious lady and it feels as if we are at home, eating sumptuous food. 
All in all a must try for people into "hatke" gastronomic concoctions! @

Zomato lead me to this nice cute eatery last night. Though Zomato lists this place as a take-away counter, Dosa Twist houses a nice restaurant for 15/20 people. And it's an AC restaurant, mind you. The owner is a cheerful lady who helped me with placing my order. Chicken and cheese is a combination that can rarely go wrong, hence I settled for a chicken cheese dosa. Now dosa purists may sneer at the thought of having meat inside dosa and may say it's not authentic. I cannot say it's authentic either, since this was my first tryst with non-veg dosa. However, what I got was delicious. Chicken keema, gooey cheese, green capsicum and onions inside a crisp dosa, served with three chutneys or dips. I loved the mint chutney and the red chilli chutney especially. The idea is definitely innovative. Portion size was huge for one person. And the best part was it comes in for just 130 bucks, no taxes as of now. Those who are willing to try out something different, head over to this place. You may savour something exquisite.

Even though I've never really been a fan of South Indian food, this joint did make me change my opinion. The non-veg dosas here are to die for! I personally love the chicken-cheese dosa as well as the mutton-cheese dosa. The centre of the dosa is filled with gooey melted cheese and stacked with keema! For vegetarians, there is the mushroom-cheese dosa which is equally good! As for old school, there is idly and regular dosas too. Prices are on the lower side and it stays open quite late so, its a win-win situation if you're out and dying for something to experiment on!

non veg dosa itself is a rarity in kolkata and that too at such affordable price makes this place unique....a pretty small take away counter serving surprisingly good non veg dosas at really reasonable price

Possibly one of the few joints that serve non veg dosas unlike the numerous south indian joints around. Its a take away joint and their service is good. I have ordered dosas at 10 at night and they were still willing to deliver.

Although i do believe dosas should be had then and there itself the next best thing is delivery. The dosa is neatly packed with the sambhar and the other stuff separately.

I have had their plain masala dosa, cheese masala dosa and the chicken dosa. Although it does sound wierd to order one, the egg cheese chicken dosa taste pretty decent. Nice of chunks of chicken nicely done up in. Prices are reasonable so definitely worth a try I say!

It was again an accidental discovery. This tiny store was packed with surprises. Located in between Zeeshan and Royal Lebanese this food point has the most amazing menu and in a very reasonable price range. I tucked in their cheese dosa which was a modest 50 bucks and crispy and filled with cheese and then went on to try the lovely 90 bucks chicken masala dosa. Would go in again to try the other ones. Pocket friendly, healthy, filling and located at a stone throw distance from my home.

Being a hard core South Indian food lover this place has been on my wish list for a long time now, finally managed to visit this one, one month back and since then their food has been on my mind! 
The problem which I face while having South Indian cuisine my non vegetarian friends and family hardly get anything to eat but dosa twist is definitely an unique concept and the non veg dosas are really fun especially the egg mutton cheese dosa! I am a little traditional hence I stuck to my cheese masala dosa but for my family it was rather an innovative concept. I would really suggest this place to everyone who loves to gorge on South Indian delicacies and find something missing because of the absence of non vegetarian items. 
This place is rather modest but located in desapriya park it's rather easy to spot and definitely a place one should try.

Okay, I'm seriously not a south Indian food person. But hey, Dosa Twist changed my the way I thought. The owner Munmun Dasgupta is such a cool lady and an amazing host. What a concept. Non veg dosas are a must must have here. Try the Mutton Cheese Dosa and Schezwan Cheese Masala Dosa. Simply mouth watering. Its a road side joint. Dine in not available yet, likely to be up by first week of June'15 (with AC :))

PS: try going in the off peak hours. Ideally a little late in the night. They are open till 11:15pm. Have fun!

This place experiments with dosa in a brilliant way. The food quality is good and taste wise it is average. I had the chicken masala dosa from here. The portion is huuuggeeee.... Like really huge. The food was good but they used too much oil. And they definitely need to improve on their chutneys.

This joint would satisfy a non-veg foodie in every way!

Heard about it from a colleague. The concept ¬†seemed pretty interesting. Took a chance to visit there and please our grumbling tummy. Ordered Egg Chicken Cheese Masala Dosa. Honestly speaking, I was a bit apprehensive, as I don't like South Indian food much. But the moment I took my first bite, I was delighted! Crisp coat with plentiful stuffing left our stomach and heart both satiated. A must try!

They don't have proper seating arrangements till now, but we had a talk with the lady (supposedly the owner), who confirmed of having it done by 3-4 months this year.¬†

To all the non-veg lovers out there, don't give a second thought. It's a must try!

Location: Adjacent Royal Lebanese, Desapriya Park.

‚ÄúDosa@Twist‚Äù! The name says it all. Yes, this place serves a wide range of fusion fare along with the usual fare which includes dosas, idlis and uttapams, both in the vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian category.

The AMBIANCE might not be loved by many since it is a road-side eatery and has a few stools on the pavement as seating arrangements. If you don't mind the ambiance, you can give this place a try. :)
But, the FOOD they serve is pretty decent. Have visited this place thrice and the following has been tried until now:

- Schezwan Cheese Dosa
The Dosa was thin and crisp on the sides, but soft from the middle thanks to the generous amount of cheese. A generous amount of Shezwan sauce was spread across the dosa. 
Tasted great!
Recommended.

- Plain Dosa
Thin and crisp Dosa. Good to taste.

- Chinese Dosa
Street-style noodles filled inside the Dosa. Tasted decent.
The noodles was prepared on order and had a nice flavor to it but, oily. 
The Dosa was greasy thanks to the oil content in the noodles.
Was served along with their usual chutney which didn't compliment well, could have been served with Sweet Chilli sauce.

-¬† Idli [2 pieces]
Mediocrity towards the softness, tasted average.

- A parcel of Button Idlis was made which is nothing but, mini idlis (melted in the mouth) dipped in sambhar and topped with a dollop of butter. 
Had coriander leaves on top, which didn't seem to be fresh. 

‚Ä¢ All products were served along with three types of chutney in a compartment plate and Sambhar in a bowl alongside:
- Coconut Chutney was flavorful.
- Coriander Chutney was well prepared.
- Garlic Chutney had a slight zing of garlic and spice; can be improved.
- Sambhar was of a thick consistency and was flavorful. But, has scope of improvement. Have had better. :)

‚Ä¢ This place also has home delivery facilities for nearby areas, would update on it soon.

The STAFF was found to be polite and friendly.
The SERVICE was slow.
PRICES were found to be pocket friendly.

Overall an above-average experience.
- Being an ardent lover of dosas, I am coming soon here!
- Yet to try the remaining fare, would update on them soon.

Its not often that i write here but this time i had to. Had been hearing about this place for a while now and finally ordered some food home. Before anyone reads any further,i'd advise you to go and eat there and not order food home because the delivery isn't as  efficient as it should have been considering the food here. Having said that,the food is pretty good. The weirdest thing about the food we ordered, considering the name, was that the regular masala dosa was leaps and bounds better than any other dosa on the menu. The other dosas are basically like the regular burrito. Its a must eat nonetheless!

Its abt Dosas with a twist literally n guess they idlis n vadas wid twist too... ????

The items like cheese schezwan chicken dosa or button idly wid mutton curry are things of fusion fantasy which we hoped that it wud be true wid our ubiquitous south indian food... n voila... this joint gives us that.

The proportions are generous... cost to quality ratio just right n attentive attendants. Only thing is that no proper place to sit... have to do wid stools on the front pavement. Rest evrything is cool abt this joint.

Review Edit. : Now they have place to sit. They acquired the place behind them and have a AC dining place. Also new are items like Dosa Pizza ! Fab !

Brilliant food at superbly affordable price! They are generous with the stuffing (which by the way is cooked to perfection) .. 
The chicken cheese Sosa is a clear winner!

" Dosa @ Twist " is the name and it clearly bowls the googly cleverly enough to castle our taste buds ! I just hope they keep up with their brilliant creativity.
The joint serves veg and non-veg dosa , thats it ! With a variety of menu to choose from , the cheese egg chicken dosa and its paneer variant are the clear winners. The chicken keema filling is cooked to perfection. The chef carefully layers and prepares the filling for each dosa , and the result is truly a treat !
What I loved was the so very generous quantities of chicken and cheese provided by the chef.
BTW , the veg and non-veg tawas are different. The takeaway butter paper and newspaper wrap is just perfect to carry the food as well.
For a fast food joint , it's a clear 4 from me. I am sure , this joint is going to be swamped during the durga puja , in the next couple of days.
