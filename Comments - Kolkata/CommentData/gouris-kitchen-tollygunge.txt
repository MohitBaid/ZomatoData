An unassuming little outlet adding to the craving and convenience of the people in and around the area of haridevpur. This is a local place, quite cheap but nothing great. The taste factor is ordinary. Not  something like a good, popular local business. But it does get a lot of business as there isn't any other proper eatery in that area.

I live nearby to this food joint and this implies that i have had food from this place quite a number of times, willingly or unwillingly..
So lets get this straight & simple:
Food: fair
Quantity : very good
Quality: fair enough (never had any health issue)
Cleanliness : poor
Service : moderate
Items worth trying: steam momo, pan-fried momo, fried rice.
P.S. it's not a restaurant, just a take-away joint.

A great place, of no great looks, but with great food at affordable prices.
My picks are the chicken momos , noodles and the well known side dishes like chilli or manchurian chicken.

I was hanging out with my friends and certainly saw this restaurant Gouri's Kitchen. We all were hungry and decided to go and have something. I ordered a Pan Fried Momo which was really good I have to say. My other two friends ordered mutton biriyani. I also ate a little amount from those two but the quality was ordinary. But it's a very pocket friendly restaurant and services good food..

I first chanced upon this place when I had moved to Dharapara area, and never regretted it. This is just the kind of cheap, succulent Tibetan-Nepalese-Chinese food which I really like. Its not just the hybridized 'para' Chinese, but also has authentic Tibetan-Nepalese flavors woven delicately into the food. They provide home delivery within 5 kms. There is no place to sit, but you can stand and eat out of plastic plates too. I highly recommend the momos, the noodles, both hakka and gravy and the chilly chicken. But you must have them piping hot, because otherwise the starch in the food settles and becomes gooey and then runny. Also do try their rolls, not bad at all. Overall great value for money and pretty sumptuous!

Rolls are of lachha paratha rolls, very crispy & quite cheap. The best rolls in the area.

The Chinese dishes are excellent, particularly the Gravy chow is yummyiiiii. We have tasted Biryani also, which matches the quality of top restaurants.
