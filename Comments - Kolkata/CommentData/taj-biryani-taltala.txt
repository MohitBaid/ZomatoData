Taj Biriyani - A takeaway experience.
====
Intro: 

As my office is situated in the Sealdah Area, my co-staff did a takeaway pack for a special chicken biriyani from here for me. I have not personally visited the biriyani shop.
====
What i had:

• Special Chicken Biriyani - The rice was quite sticky but the chicken was tender. The aloo was fine but not cooked to perfection. Overall, it was good. At Rs. 110, two chicken pieces, one egg and one aloo is totally not a bad deal. 
==== 
Pros:

• Reasonably priced.
• Ample quantity served at the price.
• Tasty food.
====
Summary:

Presentation 3.5/5

Quality 3.4/5

Quantity 3.7/5

Taste 3.5/5
====
Conclusion:
It is a good place to order especially if you want to satiate your stomach and you are tight on your budget.
