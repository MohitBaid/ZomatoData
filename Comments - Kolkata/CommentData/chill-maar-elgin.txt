Worse experience so far on Zomato. Second picture is Zomato's response. Third picture is of the food chill maar is displaying that it's supposedly serving. First picture is what I received by the delivery boy in exactly the state as you can see in the picture. Weighted less than 50 grams. Made me wait for 1 hour and 30 minutes. The food they sent is just because they're too kind, they need not have done that. Chill maar you need money in charity do let us know. Please just don't cheat us for God's sake! Worse experience ever. I returned the food and Zomato was kind enough to refund my money. Zomato has promised for a strict action against this restaurant, I hope they keep their promise! Rest is all worse!

so today I visited this place fr the third time and I was literally shocked at their service ..
let me elaborate .
1.we ordered hookah brain freezer..they served us in about 10 mins and the frst thing we noticed was that the pipe was cracked..we asked them to chnge it..they took it back and served us another cracked pipe ..when asked..they clearly said all pipes are cracked
2 we ordered coke..they sd one glass comes for 55 bucks so due to low budget we decided to cancel it and askd fr water..they served us one glass..for three people..wen asked fr two more..they very blatantly sd there is one glass and ones we finish it they will pour it fr us...so clearly a cafe had one glass...seriously? or was it because we cancelled the coke..anyhow let's move on
3. we spent about 45mins chatting and then thy changed our coal and evrythn was fine..the cafe was almost empty...later on a single grup came in though..anyhow they came and sd...shall I get the bill? we sd yes..after few mins one of the waiters came and sd 348 ..we askd fr the bill so they brought us a hand written bill..now we ordered hookah worth rs 219 how cud it be 348..we checked and saw tht instead of levying 18%tax they added a lot more..on asking for clarification they sd we give handwritten bills and tht thy askd for a mint to check the rates..one of them came back and sd we hv to pay 300rs ..
now somethn is nt clear..y a hand written bill? y was their service so poor, why was an employee's shirt hanging on a chair back?...y were we askd to leave politely by stating the bill amount ..n y did they initially not give the bill....if they r levying gst y a hand written bill?.they had no words to justify..all were confused...
my third visit was disastrous..will never visit the place or recommend it to others.i am attaching the bill..

First, the NAME should not be Chill Maar. The A.C was not working when we went there . Bad food, even they don't know what a cappucino means. The place was absolutely empty when we arrived at this place. This place is not worth visiting for anyone who has a taste for good food. An absolute thumbs down to this place üëé

Most of the items from their menu was unavailable.
Ambience was okay. It's a small place and lacks non hookah zone. The customers that were already there treated it as their dad's place and that was annoying.
Service was good but a little slow. They made us available the items we had asked for i.e. nuggets.
Food was good too.
It was a little difficult to spot the place.

The place is just in the lane next to Bhawanipur College. You can see a hoarding on the top of the lane and its easy to find. The place is mostly empty and you rarely find a crowd here. Though they have worked well on their interiors and food quality is pretty decent, they have a long way to go. Specially in the Elgin area which has a lot of competition. They have a long way to go. The staff was good and you find pretty decent deals every now and then. I guess that's what keep this place going towards its goal.

Was utterly disappointed with the visit. The place was easy to find. But there was hardly any options available from the menu. Whaetver we seemed to decide to order was turned down by the waiter saying that they were not available. Moreover the crowd disappointed. Young people relentlessly using cuss words at the top of their voice went unnoticed by the authorities. The music being played was dumb and 'faltu'. The interior look is decent though. Won't be visiting again anytime soon.

A small cafe near bhawanipur college. A tiny place decorated with various masks, posters, lights. We went there on a Sunday afternoon. We were the only customers at that time. Staffs seemed very reluctant. We ordered corn and cheese sandwich, kiwi crush and tuty fruity ice cream. Food quality is somewhat okey.

Went there with my friends.. a nice and cosy place. Not too far from forum mall and just beside bhawanipore college,this place is quite easy to find. The ambience was nice and decor was attractive. I personally would go again just for the decor. The place is quite comfortable but a bit too small. With nice music being played in the background we were tge only customers as of for then . We ordered a combo of a regular hookah with a coke and cheese garlic bread. This came for 320. Which is quite affordable. The hookah was oaky.. and the garlic bread was tasty. Then we also had a crispy chilli babycorn which was a bit more salty and a non veg duplex sandwitch which was kind of okay. We also orderd a nonveg chilli noodles but they gave us veg one. The quality of the food was okay.but all in all its quite pocket  friendly and the service was great. The people were friendly and well behaved. So i would recommend this place to others.

So, this is small shisha parlour not to far from Forum mall. Easy to find. The ambience is quite good though the place is not so big. They offer different combo offers with specific day wise deals. Took the combo of a coke, one shesha, a cheese garlic bread. This combo was priced at 320 which i found very cheap. Also we took one spicy chilli baby corn, one noodles, one double wrap non veg sandwich. The food was good. Although the service was late in spite of there being no customers other than us, would like to recommend it to all.

A very small place just beside Bhawanipur College with very simple decor inside. The place is comfortable and can be considered as a decent place for hangout with friends. The big positive which they have is that they do not give much stress in our pocket. The price is reasonable compared to other places. The combos which they offer in Happy Hours are nice. Though the quality is not that great, but I was happy with what I was getting in that price. The staffs are well behaved and attentive. One thing which I liked about the decor is the colourful windows. The multicolour windows are just beautiful.

Location: Just few steps away from Prapti Showroom in Elgin Road. 

Last Words: 
A place to smoke some shisha, hangout with friends and save your pocket. Though there are many other places like this, you can always visit this if you are nearby.

3/5 for this place

Ambience is ok, small place, nicely decorated. We ordered strawberry shake,cold coffee, baby corn & noodles.. Drinks were good, baby corn very ordinary, but noodles were good, liked that. One very negetive point is service, veryyyyy slow, they took too much time to get our orders, not only ours but others were complaining to them about their slow service as well... If you just want to chat with ur friends, need a quiet place & have lot of time, then its a good place, or else hmmm ok types.

Totally awful place... not worth it. The food is crap. Hookas are just some flowery mist. The brainfreeze one doesn't freeze anything. The waiters are rude and lazy except Tushar,  most of the time they disappear into their staff section and people cant grab their attention even when they holler and bang on the door. Otherwise the place had potential with it location. The ambience and decor is welcoming though.

A newly opened hookah place with a very chilled out ambience and quirky interiors. The place is next to Bhaggu. Getting here is pretty simple though parking can be a bit of a trouble.

The major thing that made me go here was the fact that they served non vegetarian as well. Most of the hookah places in town are pure veg. So we entered the place and it was actually empty. 

We ordered for the gum supari hookah which was really well made. Zero complaints from that department.

Unfortunately their main chef was not in the establishment as he had to leave due to medical emergency in the family. So the helper made us what he said he is good at.

So we ended up having cheese garlic bread and chicken sandwich. The garlic bread was nice but could have been a bit more crispy and the chicken sandwich tasted decent with the chilli mayo dip he prepared on our request.

The staff is forthcoming and honest as well as polite. The bill was around 600 which is pretty cheap. 

You can give this place a try if you are tired of the tried and tested ones in town am sure you will be pleasantly surprised.

Went there with a groupon deal. Loved the cheese wai wai. Food is really tasty. However the seating is a bit uncomfortable. Good service and pretty pocket friendly.

Come here with your pals for a pocket friendly tasty meal!!! We tried the Penne Alfredo chicken pasta, Pasta in white sauce seasoned with Italian herbs... Yum... 
The fresh lime soda could improve but the sweet strawberry shake was yummilicious!

A newly opened hookah place with a very chilled out ambience and quirky interiors. The place is next to Bhaggu. Getting here is pretty simple though parking can be a bit of a trouble.

The major thing that made me go here was the fact that they served non vegetarian as well. Most of the hookah places in town are pure veg. So we entered the place and it was actually empty. 

We ordered for the gum supari hookah which was really well made. Zero complaints from that department.

Unfortunately their main chef was not in the establishment as he had to leave due to medical emergency in the family. So the helper made us what he said he is good at.

So we ended up having cheese garlic bread and chicken sandwich. The garlic bread was nice but could have been a bit more crispy and the chicken sandwich tasted decent with the chilli mayo dip he prepared on our request.

The staff is forthcoming and honest as well as polite. The bill was around 600 which is pretty cheap. 

You can give this place a try if you are tired of the tried and tested ones in town am sure you will be pleasantly surprised.

Chill Maar!!!! Suddenly came across this place while going through Groupon.Since this cafe is very near to my place thought of giving it a try.The deal was really tempting,for 249/- they had 1 Shisha(single/double flavoured),2 beverages,1 starter & 1 coal change (Like i said the offer was tempting enough to try). This place is located on elgin road in the next lane to Prapti...very near to Bhaggu...not much to talk about the ambience,its decent but nothing too exciting.Since this is a relatively new place it doesnt remain crowded at all,when we went there at about 7 in the evening only one couple was there....and in next 1hr only another small group of 3 people came there....now if i talk about the Hookah..we ordered Double Apple with mint,it was good,and the first coal lasted really long,which is not very common with us.But after the coal change it started to choking(We didnt really bother much about that,since we were about to leave).The pasta was also decent(i am not much of a Pasta lover,so that might be the reason i found it ok)....Overall a decent place for hookah.

Visited this place after hearing the name and the reputation bhawanipur has for hookahs.  The ambience is cool.  The service blew away my mind! So pathethic it was. The slowest service ever even after having 2 or 3 staff members and a number of 3 tables to serve that only hookah.  The staff took nearly 40 minutes for serving the hookah and 25 minutes to get a glass of cold drink. Me and my friend screamed after waiting a long time and then the staff finally did get us the hookah. The hookah was good and i have no complaints against the hookah but the service sucks.

On a Sunday afternoon thought of visiting a new cafe in town but was disappointed.
Reasons:
1. The hookah was not at all smooth. Smoke was also disappointing given the triangle base. 
2. Many flavors were not present.. E.g rose, royal pan etc.
3. A masala tea is supposed to to be served with milk but was shocked to c dat it was liquor masala tea which was pathetic!
4. Lack of staff. Had to wait for 10 mins if I wanted to communicate with staff!

This place is located near to The Bhawanipore College...
The place is good.  Its ambience is nice with good quotes..
As I went wid one of my friend at happy hours so we ordered a combo of sheesha with maggie & tea...
The sheesha was good mild as ordered n smooky but maggie was horrible... it was not cooked well nor it had any taste... The green tea was good as it was made by us only... bcoz the staff just place a cup of hot water wid some sugar n a green tea bag..

This place can be visited again for its sheesha n if the staffs are trained well...

Location: In the alley beside Prapti Showroom; A stone's throw from Bhawanipur College.

This place was visited post-lunch along with a couple of friends for a casual chill out. This place has a pretty different AMBIANCE with the old-style stain glass arch windows, modern style textured walls, photo frames, masks and compact discs stuck across walls. Not much of a pleaser not too pricking. The selection of music wasn't pleasant.

About the FOODING, we had dropped by during the happy hours and since we didn't have much of an appetite, stuck to a combo (Sheesha + Veg. maggi + Tea) they had on offer.

- The Veg. Maggi¬† was the usual Masala Maggi one makes at home. Visually looked well-prepared, but, wasn't cooked well. The masala in it wasn't well mixed and thus, gave it a grainy type taste. 
A Veg. Maggi is expected to have vegetables in it, which was found to be missing. If you wish to serve Masala Maggi along, kindly mention the same.
A miss.

- The tea was to be of our choice. Thus, ordered Green Tea. Expected green tea leaves put in hot water, prepared, strained and served in a cup. 
But, were served hot water in a cup with a Tetley Green tea bag and sugar alongside.
No credits to the place.

- The SHEESHA was decently (average) smoky and lasted for a decent span of time. A lot of flavors were found to be unavailable. Stocks should be maintained. 

The STAFF was polite, but needs a lot of training. This place lacks ground staff, all the staff vanishes into the kitchen once an order is taken; no one to attend other customers. Sad.
The SERVICE was way too slow.
PRICES were inclusive of all taxes and looked reasonable. But, might feel a pinch with respect to the quality served.

Overall a below-average experience.
- A huge scope of improvement.
- The widespread menu is yet to be tried, comments due.
- A slightly better rating has been given thanks to the sheesha, else this place can be given a miss.

Went there during the afternoon on a Sunday. The place was completely empty. Asked for a hookah and we were informed that we get a tea with it. Told the waiter to get a normal tea without cinnamon. He came back with hot water in a cup and a green tea bag. We asked him to change it and get normal tea. He came back in 2 minutes with the same cup of water and a tea bag and sugar. This was shocking since he mentioned a machine which would be used to make the tea. Anyway,we then asked him to bring some milk so we could mix it in with the tea and he went into the kitchen, came back asked said that there is no milk. This is shocking as the menu boasted of cold coffee and other milk based items. It was pretty apparent that they just did not want to take the effort of bringing us milk or making a decent cup of tea.

It has everything you would desire under one roof at very reasonable prices.. The pizzas, pastas and hookahs are all my THING when i enter this funky, ¬†ritzy and tony cafe.. From the ambiance to the hospitality till the end would make you feel ¬†that you need to back soon(even if its for a glass of water) ¬†.. I would recommend everyone to try it and experience the CHILL of Chill Maar .. :)

Chill Maar indeed as the name suggests is a place where you can chill and recall your college days. More so the location also reminds you of your good old college days when you must have sneaked out of college to a nearby joint for a quick bite.¬†
Chill Maar offers a wonderful all in one experience of Sumptuous vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian food items, Scintillating Hookah flavors and Refreshing Beverages.¬†
You can even tune in to your favorite television channel and play the music of your choice over Coffee and much more........!!!!!!!

If you are looking for a cosy caf√© with good ambience and food and yet not far from centre of the city, This is the place. Located in the heart of the city on Elgin Road just beside Bhawanipur Education society. Was totally bowled over by the ambience and the d√©cor. Very neatly and aesthetically done. But that was just the beginning. The warmth and behaviour of the attendants were really heart touching. Already visited twice with in 7 days of its opening and trust me I am just looking for opportunities to visit this place again and again.One must try the Pizzas out here ... Its an absolute beauty. But you can find almost all types of food in this caf√©, Be it Indian or Continental. The menu is very elaborate and you can drop in anytime between 10 am to 10 pm and treat your stomach with just the right kind of food as per your hunger status. But the main USP of this place would certainly be the pricing. Being priced extremely economically in comparison to all the cafes around the same area this would certainly be the hunting place for many in days to come.A totally Chill Out Zone ............................

Spent a splendid and enjoyable Sunday evening yesterday with friends at Chill Maar!This was my second visit to the joint and I recommended it to my friends who wished to go through the same awesome experience that I had last time when I was here a few weeks back.I had ordered chicken pasta in white sauce which was wholesome and delicious!My friends ordered chicken dhamaka pizza which was like a blast of cheesy chicken in all forms (actually!) getting melted in your mouth as soon as you take the first bite...in one word, it was italian at its best!To top it all we tried out the double green apple hookah which was exciting and interesting as the flavour is unique and lingers on refreshing you from inside!A true value for money experience - strongly recommended for people who want good food,perfect hookah,enchanting ambience and most importantly friendly and helpful staff!!So what are you waiting for.....go for it NOW!!:-) :-)
