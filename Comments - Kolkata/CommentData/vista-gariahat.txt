Went on a new year's eve.the restaurant is basically a large hallroom with sober ambiance.it was completely empty and we were the only customers throughout.we really enjoyed the hospitality they showed us.the food they served were average,nothing extraordinary.
P.s.price is reasonable

Easy to locate. The rooms are not that large, but ambience is okay. Food tastes good. Their 'Kulcha' is really tasty ❤ And prices are reasonable.
