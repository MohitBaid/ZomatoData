Visited this place days back. It's actually a garage cafe. Doesn't have AC. You can smoke here. So it's ideal for a winter evening. Service is pleasant & quick. We have orederd French fries, chicken sandwich and assam tea. Food was good but the quantity of the frech fries should be little more. Sandwich was good though. 

 We thought assam tea would be milk tea. But it's actually tea bag which is providing with hot water and sugar. It's black tea. But the good part is they will refill your cup with hot water, so that you can make 2-3 cups of tea with a single tea bag.

This cafe is extremely pocket friendly.. you can check the menu to understand how inexpensive it is. Located just opposite to Saltlake Big bazar, very easy to find.

Been there several times for evening snacks. Loved that place. Though very small place, but great in ambiance. I loved their wall art.
We have there assam tea, french fries, cheese and corn sandwich , egg cheese sandwich and gondho raj soda shikanji.
Egg sandwich was great and really liked the gondho raj soda shikanji.
Loved their courtesy too.

Running short on cash? Yet you Need a good snack to calm your cravings? Want them to be delicious too?? Then this is your place!!
Pocket friendly and a cafe that serves really tasty food and beverages, Stargazey is a real surprise for anyone visiting this place. Had been there twice already and sorry for taking this long to write about it.
I have had Chicken Burger, Chicken Sandwich, egg sandwich and corn n cheese sandwich along with a cup of hot coffee on both the occassions. I was there whenever i had those nasty cravings for sandwiches or burgers and Stargazey did well to calm my inner demons for the day! :D
This cafe will never cease to please me.
One tiny piece of query, rather a suggestion, Stargazey can you plz move to a bigger space or add some more seats to your restaurants and can remain open 7 days a week if possible?? Am pretty sure you dont know how popular you are.

A small Cafe located at the curve of hb block, is a quiet place for very few guests to sit in,the food quality is good just like home food, but the quantity served is really not worth the money. The ambience is like a perfect night, n a lot of food has continental touch.

"Size doesn't matter"-whoever said this must have visited this cafe sometime.Went to this cafe with zero expectation.Located at a stone throwing distance from Carnival Cinemas,this cafe is small but impactful.The manager or owner was standing for us in front of his cafe proving that customers are very important to him.Now coming to the food.Both the coffee as well as the tea were good.Ordered Chicken Sandwich and it was a mouthful.Only con is that with no proper fans and AC's the place will be difficult to visit in the summers.Also the space is very small but deserves a visit.All in all very easy on the pocket and provides good food.

A local garage of a house converted into a small cafe like joint,a few steps away from Big Bazaar Salt Lake.There are seats for around 15-20 people.We went there on a Sunday evening and the place was absolutely empty.There was only one person who was the waiter as well as the cook.We ordered for a egg sandwich,a chicken bacon sandwich,black coffee and green tea.The egg sandwich was hearty with good amount of veggies and boiled egg, the amount of mayo was a little overload which was not quite to my liking,the next time I will make sure of telling then from beforehand.The chicken bacon sandwich on the other hand was quite average,tiny few pieces of bacon and chicken scattered here and there.Again overload of mayo.Both sandwiches were served with potato chips and ketchup sachet.Coming the tea and coffee,the black coffeeâ€‹ was nice and strong but for the green tea they just casually put hot water and a sealed green tea pack infront of us,would have been better if the tea was premade.Service needs to be improved a lot more if this place requires to strive through.

A really tiny restaurant opposite to carnival cinemas , sector 3 salt lake with only two tables. Basically a well decorated garage with only one staff.
As for the food its good compared to the cheap price.
We had bacon sandwhich , chicken hotdog and hot chocolate. The sandwhich was good with fair amount of bacons tomatoes and onions. It tasted quite good.
The hotdog and the hot choclate was so-so.
Overall its ok for a quick bite for low pocket pinch if your hungry after a movie..

Little App offered me the Chicken Burger Combo at quite a reasonable price at Stargazey.
It's just opposite to the Big Bazaar and very easy to locate.
Although the place is a bit cramped up (space not more than 12-14 people), I liked the way they had remodelled the garage space into a small eatery with interesting pictures, photo frames and paintings.
Now coming to the food, I wasn't very satisfied. The chicken burger didn't have bacon in it; it was just a simple burger. The soda shikanji was good but too much of pepper had made its taste different.
Just an average experience!
I would suggest to put up some more pedestal fans during the summer, so that customers don't have to feel the scorching heat.

Very near to carnival cinemas , a garage converted to a small cafe , fan cooled with seating capacity of around 10 people. Nothing much to talk about the decor , its a student friendly place serving  limited and common menu consisting all easy home cooked recipes therefore without any show of culinary skill. The CHICKEN SOUP was simple boiled chicken with garlic and onion in stalk helped my sore throat a lot , the CHICKEN OMLETTE was not fluffy at all , instead very oily . The cooler named VAMPIRE had the most disgusting taste ever , the BACON CHEESE ROLLS looked great , but isn't a dish i was happy worth paying for. Simply a sheet of amul cheese and white bread rolled and wrapped with bacon and topped with swirls of mayonnaise , neither theres a crunch , nor any seasoning . The MILK COFFEE was okayish , i  don't expect a cuppaccino at a price of Rs 40 .
The prices as i said before are kept low but the menu lacks something to come back for.
Only plus point is you get an easy car parking nearby.

i visited the small cafe today.first the location is 15 seconds distance from carnival cinemas just opposite lane inside the ground floor of a house.a small differently decorated small joint.such a scorching heat was outside i thought it would be a bit disaster to seat without a.c..but it was not...
lets come to the point of food.we took one chicken salad,one pepperoni sandwitch with cheese.later we took one cooler named vampire.the food quality was nice.the sandwitch with alu chips was really tasty...i loved the chicken sandwitch too...the cooler vampire is basically roohaafja  with a bit of lemon and jaljerra.it was good for summertimes...the price is apt no vat or tax there thats a bonus i guess.
one star i didnt give only because it looks like a old garage used in a different businesslike way and secondly in the salad onion was too much though taste was good..and i wanted to taste bacon but it was not available...

After a visual treat of Beauty and the Beast in 3D, dropped in here on a hot summer afternoon for a quick meal. The quirky decor of the little cafe with colorful graffitied wall, the starry lamp in accordance with the theme etc. immediately caught my attention.
Ordered the iced lemon tea and veg sandwich.
The tea that came in a pretty mason jar was absolutely gorgeous to taste and very refreshing in the heat; the plate of two vegan sandwiches looked yummy enough, accompanied with potato crisps and ketchup. They were so very fresh with the tastiest fillings.
For some yummilicious snacks or beverages a quaint little cafe outlet to be tried out at least once indeed!

This place is by one of closest friend and coolest senior of the college- Rano da. This man has always been a charmer - well-behaved, soft spoken, and a gentleman. But, it is a pleasant surprise to see that he has an impeccable sense of taste and culinary.

'Stargazey' is one of the coolest cafes I have been to. The menu is awesome, and what comes on the table melts the heart. I have not had such delicious sandwiches and shakes (and I am yet to taste everything that Ranoda has kept in the menu).

I strongly recommend this place, not just because it is by a friend, but because it is one of the authentic cafes in the town. It offers quality food in pocket friendly prices.
 This place has PayTm too.

The cafe welcomes you with a warm decor, and has an owner -Rano da- who welcomes every guest with his warm smile and attentiveness, which assures great hospitality.

All the best, Rano da... 'Stargazey' rocks! <3

I am writing this review after my sixth visit to 'Stargazey', a new pocket friendly cafÃ© in my neighborhood!
This is easy to locate coz its just opposite of Salt Lake Big Bazar.. Car parking no issue!

I usually don't go to cafÃ©s and all coz I don't prefer gossiping, taking thousand selfies etc etc and eating little little lol :D
When I go to a restaurant then my one and only motive is to eat & eat & eat!

'Stargazey' serves extremely yummy as well as quality food! The decor is neat and good, accommodates around thirteen people! The staff is very caring and service is fast too! 
***************************
Some of the dishes I tried till date -
Chicken Salad, Chicken Burger, Sausages, Cheese maggi, Cheese Omelet, Chicken Sandwiches, Egg Sandwiches, Chicken Soup.

Coolers- Vampire , lemon iced 

Shakes- Black current, Choco Peanut
Cookie n cream

Cold coffee and Hot Chocolate..
*****************************

This is a must visit cafÃ© if you really wanna satisfy your taste buds!

Stargazey- A catchy name indeed.
It was a Sat eve, and for some unusual reason, neither of our friends had a booze-party in mind.
So, we decided to visit a nearby cafÃ©/joint just for snacking.
Was hearing good things about this new place which has popped up in the hood, and decided to give it a shot. Well, we were a 10-odd-something, and since it was a newly-opened place, we decided to call the folks whoâ€™re running this place inquiring about the seating capacity and availability. The guys, Ratnadeep and Abhishek sounded very hospitable, and confirmed that theirs is a 12-seater joint, and asked us to call them once again just before we arrive, so that they do not accommodate any further customers , and make it our private joint kinda thing. Great gesture guysâ€¦!!!
Location: I would give it a 10/10. A mere 2 min walk from the Carnival Cinemas and Big Bazaar, Sector 3, Salt Lake..
A 5 mins walk from 2 hospitals- Columbia Asia and AMRI and the Salt Lake Stadium.
5-7 mins drive from Sector V, Karunamoyee, EM ByPass as well. Tucked inside a lane, completely secluded from the hustle-bustle.
Parking: Absolutely no issue. In fact, this lane is the de facto parking lane for people visiting Carnival Cinemas and Big Bazaar.
The Setting: People should actually learn how to effectively utilize a garage space and turn it to a pretty shack.
The dÃ©cor: Simpleâ€¦ Black walls, quirky grafiti festooned, and yellow star chandeliers, lighting up the place.
Menu: Okay, Surprise- No Printed/ handwritten menu. 
Upon asking, we were shown the doorâ€¦ Literally! The kitchen door has the menu written all over it by chalk. Interesting! 
It had Sandwiches with interesting combinations like Pork Ham , Bacon chicken etc. as well as the regular ones.
Maggi: Veg, Egg, Bacon etc. Lots of Options to choose from.
Upma,Salad, Burgers and omlettes tooâ€¦ In other words, everything your stomach might crave for one fine morning/evening.
At least 5-6 varities of tea, same about coffee as well.
Cold coffee with ice-cream and Hot chocolate, Some interesting coolers like Lemon Iced tea,Cookie and Cream shake tooâ€¦ Go ahead, Choose your poisonâ€¦ :P
Well, since this was the first visit.. I decided to play safe and ordered a Pork Ham Sandwich and a Cold coffe with ice-cream. Both tasted fine.
One of my friends had ordered a Chicken maggi, and I sampled a forkfulâ€¦ Boy, â€˜twas greatâ€¦!
Abhishek was shuttling in and out of the kitchen and was asking us if we need something else, how was the food n allâ€¦making us comfortable! Nice fella..
The ambience of the joint reminded me of a few reggae shacks Iâ€™ve been to in Pune,Goa, North east India. But probably thereâ€™s not many such in Kolkata yetâ€¦ Only the music was missing. If only Bob Marley was played in the background, things would have been perfect. I casually asked him, if he has installed a speaker system , or has plans of doing so. Well, he got us a nice Philips Bluetooth Speaker and we started playing songs we like from our phones directly.
It became more like a My Private joint, with my closest friends, and my favorite music with great food on a Saturday evening. What more could I have asked forâ€¦ Oh well, one more thing.. Super pocket friendly!
A sandwich plus a beverage will be within 200 bucksâ€¦ Yup!
Room for Improvement :
The Looâ€¦ Was not upto the mark. Needs renovation.
The billâ€¦ was calculated by hand and was incorrect by 10 bucks. Not a big deal, still workable.
Overall, a great great experience.

Have only been twice to this place so far, but have already fallen in love with it. Good food at reasonable rates and a unique ambience with excellent service. Professional in honour, yet so personal in care. Be it a lively evening with friends or a quiet afternoon meant to be spent exclusively in your own company or with someone special, this is the right place for all of it. It seems, now my beloved city has one more reason to come back for. Keep up the good work Abhishek, Ranadeep and all others behind this venture whom I didn't have the fortune to meet yet. Wish you all the best!

Loved the drinks, and the chicken omlette. But the portion sizes are quite small wrt the bacon and cheese rollups. I would like to see more than 3 pieces on my plate if I'm paying that much for it. But the ambience is nice, and so is the music. The owners are are helpful and nice as well. I'd visit again but I do expect to see more on my plate with the other dishes.

A great place to sit down for a warm cup of tea while chatting up the extremely genteel proprietors on a lazy Sunday afternoon.This place serves good hearty portions of well cooked food with an ambience reminiscent of South Goa cafes. The menu is likewise. So drop by and enjoy this quaint little place with your friends. 

PS: Evenings can be quite crowded so order in if don't find a place, you won't regret it.

Fellow Food Lovers,
While all of us know what good food does to our tongue, stomach and soul, what takes the entire experience to another level, needn't be anything more than a warm reception, the friendly smile, the pleasing decor,and the joy you can see on the face of the person of presenting food in the beautiful way it deserves!

So, dear reader, welcome to Stargazey- the place for excellent food, and brilliant people! Everytime we have been there- no less than 5/6 already, we have tried something knew, and never been disappointed! And if ever undecided, the ever helpful and vibrant dadas guide us to our new loves.. Â The Desi Drumsticks are but manna from heaven, so fresh and juicy, with just the right amount of roast! The Squid fritters are so light and munchy with its gorgeous tamarind dip, and the deliciousÂ Club SandwichesÂ keep the stomach filled for hours to go.
Last day, we tried out the Bread Upma and the New Chicken Salad, and a Rasgulla Truffle, and I think we have found our new fixture!

What's more, the pricing lets us students visit it many times over a month without guilt! So dig in as soon as you can, we are surely going back soon.

Visited this cafe last evening ... It's a very cool place to hangout with friends incl a pocket friendly manner ... Now I would tell , they are having a long list of shakes n coolers which are much much more tastier than ccd... As well as the quantities are sumptuous.. we also tried out the chicken salad which was exceptional... And one good part is they are giving a complementary cooler if ur bill is above rs 200 .. the owner of the cafe is a very my dear person n he is always busy in giving you the proper hospitality..

Great place with wonderful service. They have a very interesting and fresh menu. Loved their bacon cheese sandwich and the double bacon & cheese Maggie. Casual but comfortable ambience. The best part is that the prices are extremely reasonable. I am sure to become a regular at this place very soon! Keep up the good work! :)

Good food, great service! We had visited this place on Saptami after a long and tiring day. Must try the Egg and Cheese Sandwich and Bacon and Cheese Roll ups. This place goes easy on your pocket. Hoping to be back pretty soon.

A great place to be with your best buddies or loved ones. Good food added with good ambiance. The most striking thing for me was how they decorated a small place into a grand one. Must try Chicken burgers.

I was waiting since ages for something like this to open near my place.
It's an amazing place.
Food? We need a new word, because "amazing" is just not enough.
Visited 3 times and feels like home already.
Extremely friendly people there. 
Its a Must Visit Place.

A cute and cosy place. Good for a pocket friendly casual outing. Small space, but well decorated. The passion for food comes through from every corner of this cafe. We ordered the choco peanut shake, bacon and cheese sandwich and hot chocolate. Food was quite good and satisfactory. I would definitely like to visit this place again and again.

Small but beautiful cafe. By observing the people in the cafe it seems college buddies or childhood buddies have opened this joint together.

Coming to the food, we went for a Chicken Burger, it was really good in taste and the quantity was cool too. Then we went for the simple Hot Chocolate, served buring hot but it was tasty.
Overall a good experience.

P.S. they were a little hestitant to talk to me , I guess because I was their same age lol.

Bad food. Uncooked pasta. Asked for iced tea, got musk melon juice. Portions for burger and sandwiches not enough for the cost. Â Service was bad as we were served pasta after waiting for at least 45 minutes, and that too uncooked and bland. Â Many things on the menu were not available.
