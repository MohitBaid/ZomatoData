Pathetic service from the restaurant and worse still is the response from Zomato. We ordered popcorn chicken and what we got is attached in below. On calling Zomato, they connected us to the restaurant and the conversation with the lady representative from the restaurant is as follows :
Me: Ma‚Äôm, this isn‚Äôt popcorn chicken which you‚Äôve given us
Ma‚Äôm: humare yaha popcorn chicken aise hi bante hai.
Me: Ma‚Äôm I‚Äôve had popcorn chicken from restaurants across the country and this definitely doesn‚Äôt resemble anywhere near it
Ma‚Äôm: aapko pata nahi popcorn chicken kaise bante hai. Hum chicken toh diye na? Woh kaafi nahi hai kya ?

I was shocked. Even the Zomato representative refused to cooperate. If we are ordering from a trusted platform like Zomato, we expect some minimum quality from the listed restaurant. If nothing else, they should at least do a background check before listing any tom dick and harry restaurants on their platform. Very poor service from Zomato. Highly disappointed. Would definitely think twice before ordering from a lesser known restaurant featured on Zomato in future, because well, it‚Äôs Zomato (very sad to say this)

Not that the food is bad, but not worth the money. Just came back from there. Got one Veg sandwich, one chicken sandwich and small French fries. You wouldn't believe the quantity of French fries. It was so less in portion. Also the sandwiches were full of just pizza sauce, hardly any veggie chicken or mayo. Not going back.

Great place to order home delivery from. The burgers taste really good and aren't too small. The Wings(get the Wings bucket as it is PURE value for money) taste amazing. Be sure to try out the Pizza Sandwich as it is just delicious üòç. Food is usually delivered hot and on time. Definitely recommended if you're looking to eat American at VERY pocket friendly rates.

Had ordered a chicken zinger burger and it was value for money.
The burger was juicy with adequate mayo and ketchup. The patty was a fried piece of chicken, kfc style. An onion slice could have done wonders to the item. Keeping the price in mind it was good enough. You can't expect anything fancy at this price point.
A thumbs up from me.

It is truly amazing. Definitely pocket friendly. Located at 8B, Ibrahimpur Road, Bidhan Pally, Jadavpur, Kolkata. They have delivery service available on Swiggy.

Trust me you guys will forget KFC when you will eat from here. I just loved its crispy chicken. It was so crisp and delicious. I also ordered chicken popcorn and it was perfectly cooked . I loved its chicken burger too. The drumsticks and wings are pretty good but not that spicy.

This place is highly recommended.

Well i have tried their almost all the items from zinger burger to chicken drumsticks. It seemed really nice getting KFC style food at a cheap price. Recently i tried their chicken popcorn roll. The roll was nicely packed. It had plenty of chicken stuffing in it but the paratha was hard a real test of my teeth. Probably the paratha was old cause the food was served to me within 5 minutes. This is absolutely unacceptable given its previous goodwill.

Fried factory serves kfc type battered fast food in jadavpur area. They have delivery service available on swiggy. Till now i have tried the following:-

1. Fish popcorn half - New addition to their menu. Both half & full versions are available. Basically they use frozen ready to be fried fish popcorn. The quantity is disappointing for half. Pea sized 5pc fish popcorn for Rs 40 is a steal.

2. Chicken popcorn - Both half & full versions of this is available. Half version consists of 4 medium sized deep fried nuggets. The popcorns lack good seasoning due to which it tasted bland. Disappointed.

3. Chicken zinger burger - Medium sized burger consisting of chicken nuggets,mayo & bbq sauce. The burger tasted decent although a flat chicken fillet/patty would be a better choice instead of using nuggets. Good dish.

4. Rice Combo - Their platter consisted of spiced yellow rice,chicken popcorn,french fries & a fried chicken leg. The rice was tasty & also had a bit of gravy which really gave a good hint of taste. The french fries were good although inconsistent with some of them being soggy. The fried leg was decent although it could have been cooked more.

The prices are on the lower side but quality must be improved.

P.s. Pics have been posted separately

Yesterday i was literally craving for KFC zinger burger with extra cheese and chicken bucket but  i dint have enough money for buying them...so my friend took me to this place called THE FRIED FACTORY and said that its a good option if one cannot afford KFC.

This is situated in 8b jadavpur and its kind of like a takeaway but there are these small stools where one can sit and have...

Its a very small place beside the Ajooba Biriyani Outlet and on the wall you will find the menu pasted . On one side there is the combo meals and on the other side there is the other items that they provide.


I ordered ..
‚óèCHICKEN ZINGER BURGER (WITH EXTRA CHEESE) which was 70 rs 

‚óè CHICKEN DRUMSTICKS which was 70rs for 2

Now coming to the taste and quality of food...the burger was verrrry verry verrrry good ...not exactly like the KFC one maybe but you wont be disappointed for sure. It was filled with cheese, mayonnaise, a chicken breast and some sause...

Next comes the drumsticks...to me the coating was a bit thick and above it they sprinkled some pepper and salt...but the chicken pieces were huge and they were juicy though not that crispy but i was not disappointed...

They also deliver food via Swiggy and thats great for me because i am gonna order food from them when i can't afford KFC.

Lastly i would say that yes i loved the food of The Fried Factory and i would recommend all to try atleast once...i am sure you would agree with me and next i ll try the combo and add on the review of that with this.

If you are badly craving Crispy Fried Chicken...somewhat KFC chicken cravings..
But you budget is tight...Then my friend...this is the place to hop into... üòéüòé

These guyz are making very tasty fried chicken...which is surely gonna satisfy your KFC chicken cravings...
Burgers...Fried chicken basket( the only leg basket specially) ...all are lovely...

They also have very good combos to take extra care of your tight budget üòâüòâ

I have tried various items 2-3 times n every time my tummy has been satisfied...So no complains here :)

Just one thing makes me sad..they don't deliver to my location.. :( I so wanna order from home...its not that far away also from my house at Broad Street yaar...Common guyz...increase your delivery radius a bit plz.. üòïüòï

Re-Review --- Recently had their chicken burger and Chicken Drumsticks...Burger was very tasty like before but the drumstick didn't taste that good at all man...I have had better drumsticks here previously...so that needs to be noted.

Went to this place last week. It's situated on Ibrahimpur road,opposite CIT market. If you are coming from 8b take the road where you get Tollygunge metro autos and turn towards left (the very 1st lane). It's located beside Ajooba Biryani.
The place is very small and it's quite easy to miss if you're going for the first time. There are a few chairs hardly ten, without tables. So I had to use another chair to keep the plate. 
I had ordered vada pav and chicken popcorn, the latter because they didn't have ‚Çπ100 change. They took almost 20 mins to serve. Somehow I felt the portions were small and they aren't enough if you're really hungry. They can just serve as good  evening snacks. And compared to the price too quantity isn't that great. The vada pav was okay. The patty inside was quite crisp and tasty. The chicken popcorn which I by-chance ordered turned out to be amazing! I personally felt it was better than KFC's! The covering was very tasty and crispy and though they provide ketchup you won't really need it! The only shortcoming is the quantity. Will try a few other items soon though I'm having second thoughts regarding the quantity.

Food is good and different. Its unique with its desi touch in american food. But only problem is that i had to wait 30 min for my food. I ordered american pasta .it was not bad. But very late service. They tend to do the deliveries first for which the customers have to wait which is very annoying. Othetwise a nice outlet. Try to be a bit fast .i am looking forward to go their again then.

My rating is completely based on the food. I feel a lot can be done to enhance the quality. Though it is a QSR but an enhanced food quality can do wonders for this place. The place is small but menu is good. Seating arrangement is a bit hafazard. The work staff is good. I think they are doing an overall good job. But a few observations here and there can make it an wonderful rival of KFC. Parking is an issue. Prices are superbly good. My best wishes for you all.

Nice place for fried snacks. I had their burger meal which had a chicken burger, chicken drumsticks, chicken wings, chicken popcorn and French fries for Rs 180. The burger was good and tasted delicious. The drumsticks and wings are pretty ordinary. Just simple chicken with a heavy fried coating. The chicken popcorn was a surprise. Little spicy chicken pieces delicious in taste. French fries are spiral shaped fries which tasted similar to other such fries. Overall decent place.

Places near campus are very important in my life as they are forever ready to satisfy my sudden cravings. This is a small place serving burgers,sandwiches and pastas at a very reasonable price for college students. It is nothing like kfc though! Please don't fall in that trap. Their food is spicy and oily. But it is anything but bad. The chicken popcorns are very tasty. The burger is good too. However,its the americanised chicken pasta that steals the show. The quantity is epic and two people have to struggle to finish it. The taste is very like what our mothers make in the kitchen : Spicy,tangy and full of chicken pieces! I really liked it. 
The service lack a bit. They didn't have paper napkins. They served the food late. But this place deserves a try!

A little gem tucked away in a small lane. Really small place and can be uncomfortable if you sit here and eat. So, I would suggest take-away or home delivery.
But, the taste and value for money more than makes up for the lack of space. Me and my partner ordered a chicken pop corn(small) and  a chicken zinger burger with extra cheese.
Loved both the items. They got the crunchy exterior and juicy interior thing just right. It was a tad too spicy though, but I liked it.

Total crap. We went there today and ordered chicken sandwich and zinger burger, the sandwich bread was very cheap in quality, like those local breads, 4 small sandwiches were for 60rs, total waste, the burger, it's funny how they copied the name from KFC yet couldn't match up to their taste even by 1%, still better than the sandwich. My bf took home bucket chicken said that it was also very disappointing. Total waste of money and time. They charged 10rs for extra cheese, if that was extra cheese I wonder how without extra cheese tasted like.

Ordered few evening snacks from here to enjoy with my buddies.We ordered vada pav, burger meal and non veg grilled sandwich.Now some serious talks regarding the meals.The vada pav which was around 30 bucks the best item we ordered.Its highly recommended as you get a high value at such low price. The Burger was okay,the  patty was also crisp and the melting cheese also did it's job well.The chicken wings was great I personally  liked the coating.My least favourite item was the non veg sandwich I felt the sauce was too spicy for it quite takes away the taste of the fillings that were inside.Overall it was a pleasant meal.Plus the delivery was also prompt.So thumbs up.

It is a small shop at Jadavpur with not much space for seating available. But it's well decorated with reviews from customers written on small yellow papers stuck to the walls. I think it is a great alternative for Kfc and though the taste may not be the Kfc like 'finger-licking good', it is definitely great and the price specially is quite reasonable. I have tried the sandwich combo, the drumsticks and the popcorn and specially loved the popcorn and drumsticks. They taste pretty good! I would also like to mention that the service is quite fast and the guy taking the orders is polite and helpful. For me it a great place to grab some american food!

Since it was too hot to go outside, I decided to stay in and order online from a place nearby and from some place that I hadn't tried before. I ordered a rice meal which comes with rice with sauteed veggies and American salsa, popcorn chicken, two drumstick and french fries. The rice was okay-ish, it lacked any specific flavours which was expected. The french fries weren't crispy at all, they were soggy and oily. The popcorn chicken tasted more like boneless chicken pakoras just deep-fried. I could at least eat them, however, the drumsticks were off-limits. The batter was tastelss, soggy with no crispness whatsoever. The chicken was dry and not juicy.
I hope they improve their quality and they've got to work on it real hard in order to do so.

The out-of-location place is tiny without much seating area. The main attraction would be the peppy songs booming from this place and the fragrance of the freshly made indian home style fried chicken.
Had ordered a #BurgerMeal for ‚Çπ150/- which had a chicken burger, some french fries, chicken wings and chicken popcorn.
The burger was good enough. The french fries were crispy and perfect. The chicken popcorn was too small, but somehow proportionate to the value being paid. And the chicken wings were warm, crispy and just appropriately juicy on the inside.
A good enough place to catch up on some good music and freshly fried desi chicken.
The food quality can be improved.

An amazing outlet for the real chicken lovers, if u love chicken you will love fried factory. They serve American style of fast food with a pinch of Desi swag, as they say, it's really that is..All the items are too damn cheap but Tate's sooo good, it might not be finger lickin good but it tastes real good, only problem is there is a raw flavour in drumsticks, so they need to improve that a lot, sometimes I've even found some blood clots too. Tow owners I.e a gentlemen and a lady they re really good at their service, liked it very much. Wings are also good you can Tate it too...But best thing is there combo

A fairly small, almost hole in the wall diner in a somewhat out-of-the-way location, the first thing you'll notice about this place is the music playing and the delicious aroma wafting out. Their popcorn chicken roll is simply to die for, and their chicken buckets are great, too. The owners are super friendly as well. Amazing food and pretty cheap prices - what more could you want?
