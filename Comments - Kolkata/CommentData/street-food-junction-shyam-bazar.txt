Wanted to have a quick bite, specially roll. Seeing this outlet on my way I dropped here. I asked for a Chicken Roll and it was prepared in few minutes. The roll was good in taste. Good pieces of chicken and good Paratha. As a street side place their prices are very nominal. Chicken roll was just rs.35

Walking in the road in search of food is such a  hard work to do when your cravings are on the top. But Shyambazar  is one place where you get everything from Indian, North Indian, Chinese, South Indian and Pure Bengali food. But i was all looking for some quick bites with fast food stuffs so dropped at this place which looked very horrible but displayed some tasty food items in the front. Place was a bit dirty and quite small. Had a talk with Prasenjit the stuff maker who was alone and running  in the entire place. Ordered Chicken Momo and Egg Chowmien.
Momo was good but the coating was very weak as it got broken as i picked it up. The fillings were good with minced chicken but the soup was very average.
Egg Chowmien was pretty tasty and satisfactory most importantly both the items didn't disappointed.
They keep many more Fast food items for ur offerings. Prices are very reasonable.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

while returning from college tried this place..its a small outlet..yet a prominent one in the bhupen bose avenue..i was very hungry and wanted to grab a bite of a roll..suddenly came across this place..
we tried an egg chicken kebab roll and mutton kebab roll..egg chicken kebab one is very good as compared to the price..it was huge one with adequate kebabs in it..mutton one too was good..we tried their chicken momo which was edible bt not that good..6 pieces of momo they give..
their service is slow and street food as we get is grt ..juz they need to be prompt in servce..otherwise u get here good food in less price!
