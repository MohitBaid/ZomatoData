This shop may not be comparable to the quality of Gupta Brothers or Balaram's. But still within their limited budget, they are one of the best sweets shop in Southern Avenue Region. They have a wide range of products and the quality is above average. The pricing is decent too. I have seen this shop f from my childhood. The shop had a good reputation for Curd. The shop once used to be quite dirty but for past few years the thing has Changed a lot. They are now one of the best decorated sweet shop near to my place. If you are looking for good misti s at low price, this shop is a must try.

Another sweet shop quite close to our house.. with good variety! !
SWEETS-》As bengali's are born with their sweet tooth.. so sweet shops are like treat for us! ! This shop is famous for Doi ( Curd- Sweet/Sour). Also many varieties of sweets like gulab jamun, rasgullas and many types of sandesh.

The atmosphere is quiet average and I would suggest you for take away.
So, a must visit whenever close to
this shop..

A wide variety of sweets are available from roshogolla to  sandesh. This is one of the most famous sweet shop's of South Calcutta. There are around 40-50 type of sweets that they serve on a normal day. The sweets are always fresh and tasty. They are open form the morning itself till 11. Although they serve tasty sweets,the cost is also not very much. You also have place to sit and eat. Quality is overall good.Ambiance can be rated average as there is not much to decorate here. Must Visit if you are nearby.
