Located at the food court at Lake Mall. 
Serves pocket friendly dishes and they taste well too. You can generally sit there with a bucket of fries and spend hours.

Ok. I was looking forward to having here. But this kiosks simply has very limited vegetarian items. Whatever I ordered (or rather, wanted to order) wasn't available. Had to settle for something else. 
Taste wise Grab & Go is decent, but it seems like it should reduce it's pricing policy, and make available more items that are on the menu at least (especially the McCain items).

A small kiosk at the food court of Lake Mall, ideal for grabbing a few bites on the go. Food is just good I must say, and service is prompt. Even if you are not in a mood to have an entire meal, you can indulge in to some munchies that you can select from its moderately wide options. Overall, I should comment this place as "Just Good".

This is located on the food court of Lake Mall,Yum Street.

I found some of their items a bit overpriced for what they were serving,many of which included Bengali street food like Kabiraji,cutlet etc. To be on the safe side,I just ordered egg chop which again was a bit expensive for the portion...They served two chops and each of the chops had one quarter of an egg!!!The filling was nicely done...not too spicy!!!They served it with ketchup and kasundi in a single bowl as a result of which they got mixed!!!

This is a great tea joint to rejuvenate after a shopping trip. A wide variety of choices to choose from, this place also offers a quick bite. I have had the awesome kesaria tea, kulladwali chai as well as the lemon tea here. The vegetable chop that I had here on one occasion was also very tasty.

Grab and Go is a kiosk in the food court,Yum Street,of Lake Mall. Had masala tea and veg.cutlet...both were reasonably good but overpriced. Also they had very few veg options and what they had was also not available. Service too could have been faster.

Grab n go is located at yum street, lake mall 4th floor in rashbehari.  Since its a food court in mall,  ambience has to be good.  We ordered for combo offer which included 4 piece fish fingers, 1 mutton chop,  and as a drink we chose fanta instead of tea or coffee.  We also ordered a veg chop also.  Food tastes good and also the lady staff was friendly and attentive.  We need to make card with a particular amount of your choice and they will swipe it acc to your orders.  Since,  its a mall food court, price is bit costly.  Looking forward to check the other outlets over there. :)
