This small roadside eatery located in park circus area.
I was in park circus area for a work and found this place. No seating arrangement was there, so stand & eat or take away is the only option. Tried chicken chow, it was good, but little bit oily. Service was quick, the place is perfect for quick bite. Prices are very much pocket friendly.

Aroma Fast Food Hub is really a hub for street Chinese food. Chowmine is the main reason the shop runs. Visited here while passing by to taste their Chicken Chowmine once. Food was good in taste. Prices are also marked keeping in mind of Street restaurant. The Chicken Chowmine costed us about Rs.45-50 I don't remember the exact.

Decent price range , go for Chinese only . Mostly for take out. You can try the food if you are passing by , not worth to come from a long way to try it. Nice for evening snacks.
