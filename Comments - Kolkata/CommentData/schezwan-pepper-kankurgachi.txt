Had Non-veg Combo; non-spicy one. Combo included  Noodles/Rice, 4 pcs Chilly Chicken and 2 pcs of Chicken Drumsticks. Had noodles and it was good. Chilly Chicken was average but Chicken Drumsticks was not at all good. The quantity of the combo was value for value but not the quality (chicken dishes).

Its located in 4th floor of Mani Square mall... I tried their Mini combo... Which consist of 2 pieces of Drums of heaven , 4 pieces of Chilly chicken , Egg chicken fried rice... Quantity is very good... but rice was nothing special... Chilly chicken was okayish... Drums of heaven was outstanding... Perfectly cooked... Perfect ratio of spice and sauces... Prices are reasonble... Service is quick...

Been there a no. of times, and mostly ordered their non veg combo meals with noodles/rice , chilli chicken, chicken drumsticks and Kimchi Salad. The noodles with the chicken are very average, not too extraordinary, but the drumsticks are very dry and ketchup-y. If you're trying it for the first time, try out their non veg noodles combo. According to me, the noodles are way better than the rice. And all the prices are exclusive of taxes, so that should be kept in mind when recharging the amount for the Food Court Card.

As per price food is not good below average. We took chilly chicken gravy which was not a proof of great cooking skill and quantity wise also not value for money. Chicken fried rice was average expect better quality!

This is to notify all of my friends that 'Schezwan Pepper' is the lousiest counter among the entire Mani square food court. You'll be felicitated with 1st, Late serving; 2nd, tremendously bizarre food quality. We ordered "Non-Veg Chinese Combo". It comes with fried rice, noodles, drums of heaven and chicken manchurian along with salad and sauce. Though we haven't received either of the salad or the sauce. The rice was ill cooked, noodles were oddly steamed @and was stucking at threshold, drums of heaven will lead your mind to the hell and the manchurian was hard to tear. The only thing they can get the points for the quantity of the food. Don't even think to hit it, unless you want to spoil someone's mood so badly. Peace out!

Well been to this place an numerous number of times.. whenever I visit mani square this place is a must.. They serve the best Chinese combos..
Located in food court of mani sqaure..

Food :- Chinese non veg combo (294/-) this dish quantity wise is humungous.. enough for 2 adults with good appetite.. It comprises of chicken schezwan ric.. chicken noodles.. chicken manchurian.. chicken lollypop in red sauce.. The schezwan was rice was a bit bad in taste thus tym.. but the show stealer is the lollypop

The place is good as it is situated in mani square food court. I visited this place for twice and both time we ordered crispy chicken. First time the taste was quite awesome but honestly speaking second time it was just disgusting, there was no crispiness in the chicken at all. It seemed that the chicken was not fresh.

Its a food court, so ambience depends on the crowd. Food her used to be good, quality of food has really deteriorated over time.

My last order was, chicken noodles with drums of heaven and chrispy chilly baby corn. Noodles were tasteless, drums of heaven had less chicken and more of batter, and the baby corn had no chrispyness.

Will not recommend, there are plenty of other outlets and if the quality is not improving you guys may have to vacate the place.

Went there during the only Rs.55 Poila Boisakh festival. With added tax, it came up to Rs. 65. And at that price, they had only a few items to offer. ¬†Nevertheless, the food was good. But quantity was decreased. We tried out the Crispy Chilli Babycorn-taste was delicious.

It is in the Mani Square food court.
Whenever i go Mani Square food court i have it.
It remains crowded most of the time.
I generally prefer combo pack for two people.
Mini combo 225 Rs
Medium combo 300 Rs
I prefer medium one.
i do take -
chicken lollipop of 4 Pcs(just awesome)
Schzewan fried rice(Average)
Chicken hakka noodles(good)
chili chicken of 4 Pcs(average)
Although taste is average, it is really value for money.
If 2people goes then you should try it atleast once.
You will love it.

It is at the food court of Mani Square. Have tasted their dishes for the second time. Today we ordered crispy chicken and two combos. Each combo includes two plates of chicken fried rice four chicken drumstick four pieces of chilly chicken. The price for combo is 300 only. The quantity is enough for two where as the quality of chicken rice is not upto the mark.

This place is located at Food Court,Mani Square.
They serve you Chinese dishes which are pretty basic in taste. Nothing extra ordinary about the food but the good part about this place is that they serve you food in combo meals which are tummy filling for 2-3 people. The quantity they serve is good and the food is worth the money.

The outlet situated at the Food court of Mani Square Mall! It is one of the popular Chinese food stall in the food court and remain busy all the time!

Visited this restaurant few days ago during Poila Boisakh Festival! We ordered Crispy Chilly Baby Corn, Chicken fried rice and Chilly Chicken!

Chilly Baby corn - There were huge quantity in one plate and sufficient for two! But the baby corn was too dry from inside and a strong smell of masturd oil was coming out, may be it is due to deep frying! Overall ok!

Chicken Fried Rice - The quantity of the rice was enough for one person! Rice was well cooked but lack of veggies and chicken slices is too much noticable!

Chilly Chicken - 5 pieces chicken pieces were there and the chicken pieces were soft and juicy! But the chicken pieces were itself small and deeply covered with cornflower! The grevy goes well with rice or noodles! Overall ok!

In conclusion, this counter remains one of the fav stall for all Chinese lover at food court! They also served combo meal, which is also good and price is reasonable!!!

Roadside quality, no difference between Manchurian and chilli chicken. If any how decide to have a lunch don't order the fried rice ever, noodles still negotiable. Had better in some roadside fast food counters though. Drums of heaven was crispy and sweet taste but the chicken had some stinky smell in it. Only the crispy chilli baby corn was good.

So better to avoid.

Schezwan Pepper is another small hub in Mani Square food court. They serve simple Chinese veg & non veg dishes. Tried their following dishes...

Drums of Heaven : It was quite impressive with tangy & sweet sauce. Spices used were great & it tasted great too. Chicken was well cooked soft & juicy inside & crispy outside. This dish is recommended over here.

Schezwan Chicken Noodles : This looked very hot & fiery. But actually the noodles tasted very bad than its looks. It just felt hot & no other taste were found. Chicken pieces were hard to found & if found that also felt worthless. Not at all recommended.

Chicken Manchurian : Chicken Manchurian was another disappointment. 5 medium sized boneless chicken pieces were there wrapped a thin layer of cornflower on it. Chicken pieces were somehow cooked with no taste in it. Gravy was very bad & felt worst with the noodles. Don't give this dish a try.

Except their Drums of Heaven no other dishes deservs a try over here. Pricing was also not very good. Don't get attracted with the looks of their foods it tastes really bad.

I have tried food from here during the Noboborsho food carnival at Mani Square food court. The chicken dumplings and the crispy chilli babycorn were pretty good. I won't say it's a must have but when you're having it at a very cheap price, it's alright. Definitely should not be in your must try out list.

I have no idea why I decided to have food from this place ,they never looked appealing to me. 
I was really hungry so ordered the combo meal that had fried rice noodles lollipop and chilly chicken.
Everything was terrible. The food was so spicy ( i am a spicy food lover)that I had to waste the entire food after having two spoons. I really felt bad about that. 
Terrible quality, good quantity but then what's the use of you can't have anything.

Schezwan Pepper is one of the many restaurants in Mani Square's food court. After a day of shopping, we decided to order lunch from this place. It offers an option of combo meals which we opted for. The meal consisted of chicken drumsticks, fried rice and chilli chicken. It tasted pretty average. The staff however were courteous and the service was quick, and the quantities were generous. ¬†Recommended for those who like Chinese food and are on a budget.

Situated at food court of mani square mall... They served mainly Chinese food. We ordered the non veg combo (two plates chicken rice, chilly chicken boneless-4pcs, 4pcs chicken lollipop ) . you can also take noodles instead of rice. My friend and I prefer rice so we took rice. The amount of the items were sufficient but the taste was average.  But I suggest not to take the chicken lollipops.. It's all about the coating.. Inside of the coating, chicken was very little..

One fried rice,chicken hakka noodles,four piece of drums of heaven and four pieces of chilli chicken costed around 300. We also ordered for one extra plate of fried rice..The food was ready within 10-15mints. It was served hot,the quantity of rice and noodles were enough for 4 people. It was full of veggies and chicken chunks. Drums of heaven tasted yummy,well cooked,coated with flavourful sos and crispy.The chilli chicken tasted delicious too.. we loved every bit of that food,,visiting again soon.

A certain day off from work place when its drizzling outside, u cannot think but having good food if you are inside a shopping mall. After finishing our shopping at the specncers inside mani square we went up straight to the 3rd floor food court, reloaded the food cart with just 300 bucks and started watching for options for good snacks. We decided not to have pizza or kfc or subway today as those have been very regular now a days and are easily available everywhere. So we stopped at Schezwan pepper this evening. After taking a glance at all the food items in the display, we opted for mini non veg combo which consists of a huge amount of noodles, one chilli chicken boneless with gravy (4 pc) and 2 pc chicken drumstick. Noodles was good, I personally prefer thick noodles more than those which are used in rice noodles and it was exactly of my flavour. The gravy chicken was going nice with the noodles. Last the chicken drumstick - and this was also ok but the amound of chicken was very less in it. Overall, a good experience - won't say "must try" but with small pinch in your pocket, it is definitely a good option.

So here comes my review about schezwan pepper...located in d man I square food court...I just ordered fried paneer momo.corn soup,and also tried the special schezwan fried rice..all the items were really good..also pocket friendly...I think in this food court only they know how to prepare momo items
.because all those bestate momo and other  counters not worth for it!!although these momo items are best prepared by mani square haka branch but they recently stop serving it in buffet menu...

Schezwan Pepper has been at Mani Square since the beginning of time, and that's to their credit. Regularly churning out decent food, and serving up massive portions is no small task. I've had their food pretty often and they've been the standout stall in the food court everytime.

Quick, and efficient is what Schezwan Pepper is. Their food is what I've come to expect from Chinese fast food stalls. Their meals are proper -- excellent quantity, satisfactory to taste.

I can ask for no more.
Great work!

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

This food joint is located on the top floor of Mani square beside 'Grill mates' and is a popular option for many who go for a combo meal . The taste of the food here is ordinary , with nothing to recommend it , yet it provides a decent quantity of food for two in its combos for a quick lunch on a busy weekday . The noodles , rice , chicken , drumsticks combo is very popular here and usually does not disappoint. The chicken drumsticks are made in a slightly sweet sauce with a Crispy outer coating that makes them good as nibbles while enjoying your adda . The Crispy chicken here is also another good option if your not super hungry and have friends to share it with . The crispy chilli baby corn I tried here tasted slightly undercooked . Overall , if you want something non vegetarian and pocket friendly in the comfort of the food court , Schezwan  Pepper is the right place to go !

Located at the Mani square Mall food court. Went there with family as it was ¬†Poila Baisakh holiday. After shopping and Mall hopping we dined in at the food court.
Poila Baisakh food carnival is been going on where you get all the Stuffs at Rs. 61/- till April 17th.¬†
They displayed so many delicious items on the front row but from all we chose only Chicken Lollipop which was looking very pleasant. We had to buy quite variety from many outlets so only one from here.
The choice of Choosing Chicken Lollipop turned out to be a great pick. Dipped into the chilly gravy it was just beautifully made. From the marination to the entire preparation i guess all were spot on. Every one just loved it.

Note: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Schewan Pepper is located at the food-court of Mani Square Mall.Visited them just few hours ago, with one of my friend. We ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Hakka Noodle.
The quantity that they provide is enough for single person but the quality is below average. Both the dishes tasted pretty dull.
Among all the stalls at the food-court, we found this particular stall is pocket friendly.

I have been fooled by this joint many a times but whenever am low on cash the food displayed at its counter attracts me like no other joint. I have had their combo innumerable amount of times and fallen sick the very next day. I have to confess that I did commit the mistake of ordering from here yet again during the rs 61 offer. I ordered 1 chicken drumstick and they asked me to wait for 20 min which was too much considering the fact that their was no crowd yet but I agreed as I was again hypnotised by their displayed food items. Once it was served I saw the pieces to be quite small and all the pieces were not fresh as few were stale and smelled. As usual it had more coating then the meat. The most disappointing thing was that after they made us wait for 20 min they served us a cold dish instead of a piping hot one. May be I will learn my lesson and never ever have food from this place ever again as they have no conscience of serving fresh food to their customers.

Schezwan Pepper, the name suggests the link of this place with food. Nothing much to say about this joint. According to me the only stall with reasonable prices in the Mani Square Food Court. Ordered only Crispy Chilli Babycorn. The quantity impressed me. Tasty foods, pocket friendly prices and good quantity, what else will anyone want from food stalls. A well deserved rating of 8 out of 10 for them.

Have had food from this outlet in mani square food court few times. A pretty pocket friendly non veg combo is available with to choices of rice or noodles with a chicken dish and drumsticks, which suffices for sudden group outings. The crispy chicken is good here compared to the other options available there.

It is located at the 4th floor in Mani Square. The place looks good. Service is fast. The food quality is not quite good. We had ordered for a Non-Veg mini combo. The fried rice was very good. The Chicken Manchurian wasn't quite good. Drums of Heaven was very bad.

One of the worst noodles I ever had in my life. The noodles were not fully cooked and it had no taste at all. It was as dry as a desert sand with no spice no oil and not even the right amount of salt. Hats off to the guy who recommended this place to me.

Combos are really good...they offer good deals. I've been with my friends there and ordered for combos. A plate of fried rice , a plate of noodle, a of chicken Manchurian n 4pcs of chicken drums (or maybe the name vary , I forgot üòú). Infact the quantity is also more..
Foods are really awesome .. finger licking üòã

Crispy chicken is tasty but a bit hard .
The non veg meal is over all good in that price. Drums of heaven is best in it and munchurian is average and fried rice has a good flavour but noodles needs a lot more improvement.

This is my go to stall in the Mani Square food court.
They serve really great Chinese cuisines.

My favorite is the Crispy Chili Babycorn...but we generally order the Combo Meal which includes Fried Rice--Crispy Chili Babycorn--Manchurian--Noodles
Thai Bhel is a disappoint though.

Plus all this comes at a real affordable price and even the quantity is good. More than enough for a person.

Its an absolute shitty place to be. U come for having a good time with good food but what u r served with is cockroaches in your food and the best explanation offered is that chinese cockroaches are to be found near chinese food n hence we are served. Wats surprising is that dis cockroach serving counter, viz., SCHEZWAN PEPPER is the highest selling counter. One can absolutely wonder why!

We were hungry after watching a flick at mani square on a Saturday afternoon. We decided to experiment and landed here. The service was good and so was the staff. Coming to the food our order comprised of
Veg szechuan noodles
Veg Manchurian
Chili potato
Crispy chicken
Veg rice
All the items were average to taste. Quantity was suffice. Price wise its reasonable and does justice to the food quality.To sum it up a decent place.
