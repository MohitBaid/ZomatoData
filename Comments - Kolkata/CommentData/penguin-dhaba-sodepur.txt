Had been there with my folks..bit disappointed with their food quality! Not too good which i thought...! There are two sections in this dhaba...AC SECTION AND NON-AC ONE! We prefered AC section!We ordered mixed chowmein and reshmi kebab and hot and sour soup! But the quantity was enough only for 1 people...!if two people share one plate..then it wl really not be enough! Anywys...when the rashmi kebab  came there with garlic sauce..trust me!!it tasted like ordinary home made fried chickn only!i had visited many more restaurants before...amongst them..this one has poor quality!!
Hot and sour soup was okay in taste...not bad!
But the problem.is with their quantity and as far as quality is concerned...thatz not upto d mark!!
Service: servicing is good...the waiters were well behaved..no doubt!
But in a nutshell...m not satisfied with food quality and quantity!

In Sodepur Penguin Dhaba is one of the popular among few family restaurants . Having ¬†A.C and Non A.C separate section with spacious sitting arrangements. ¬†They make good quality ¬†North Indian and Chinese dishes. They serves adequate quantity in almost every dishes with well cooked Mutton or Chicken. The Mixed fried rice and noodles contains rich amount of chicken, prawn, egg etc. You can enjoy their mocktails too.

Such an awesome Biriyani they cooked (mouth watering) & Chicken Butter Masala too. If they serve good food, what else do you need! Services were excellent and we enjoyed a lot. Keep it up.

Penguin Dhaba is located at Sodepur . If mainly offers Chinese & North Indian delicacies.

Ambience is nice with proper sitting arrangements.

Staffs are nice, service is bit slow.

Tried Fish finger, Butter Naan and Chicken Butter Masala. All the dishes were pretty decent and well cooked, still nothing to die for, but can be tried. A nice place to dine in .

Rates are reasonable.

I've been going to the joint for 4 years now. Amazing place for a quick meal. Some foods are generally bland and sort of spice-less, but if you ever go there, never forget to eat their Dhaba special chicken curry.

Pros.

+Amazing ambiance in the Non-AC diner.
+Speedy and cheerful staff.
+Incredibly low rate.
+Reasonable amounts of everything in each bite.
+Can get you addicted fast.
+Their Garlic Sauce is f***ing amazing.
+Biriyani is delicious.
+Incredible non-menu items which you have to personally ask for.
+The wide variety of a-la carte allows for every experience in a single meal.
+Did I mention their Garlic Sauce was amazing?

Cons.

-Food has sometimes been served undercooked.
-All items are not available everyday.
-Every drink is a joke except the Cold Coffee.
-Non-AC diner is really unsettling.
-They rush their cooks, which sometimes leads to flavourless meals.
-Will occassionally favour customers over others.
-Not enough Garlic Sauce in everything.

Seriously, the Garlic Sauce is one of the best things about the place.

A gem in Sodepur. I have been here for quite a few times now. Each and every time I have been here it has never ceased to amaze me .

Today I was there with my fiance and we had to take snacks. We ordered the Fish finger and the Chicken Pakora. Both the items were delicious. The sheer quantity of filling in both the items were really generous and I would go so much as to say that not all places stay so honest and give fillings so generously. 

All in all I loved this place. I have always loved this place and in Sodepur there are a very few places who serve food as good.

I've been here only once with a few colleagues and based on their recommendation opted for Indian dishes instead of Chinese. The AC section had a decent ambience and offers spacious seating arrangements. The service was slow and the staff lousy. We placed an order of Kashmiri pulao, Jeera Rice, Mutton Handi and Chicken DoPiyaza. Again, after a long wait the food was served. Although a little irritated by the work-shy staff, the food calmed us down. Quantity & Quality wise everything seemed pretty good. Whether it was our hunger working up or not, we couldn't really complain much about any of it. Although not a "dhaba" in any sense, be it in appearance or prompt service, we left satisfied with decent quality food at reasonable price. Although I haven't tried many restaurants around this area, this did not disappoint me at all. It is highly recommended that the staff puts up a work-friendly & hospitable attitude though! Location is good but it's best to not expect fancy dining ambience or food quality.

A nice standard reataurant amidst this part of the city, in the stretch between Dunlop and Barrackpore on the BT road. Mostly visited by families and groups. Standard parking zone available outside the place. Food is standard. Ambience okay. Service standard. Price reasonable. Its your "anytime goable restaurant"!! Overall experience: good.

Located on bt road, these people serve very good rice recipes and chicken recipes. 

I usually go there once in a while. The price is pretty cheap.

A very nice place to dine out.

Food- They serves indian as well as chinese foods. I have eaten their biryani, tandoori chicken. They are quite good.

Others- Nice ambience. Good to take your family. Situated just beside the bt road. Do visit them as there are very few good dine outs in sodepur.

It was a quick visit to Penguin Dhaba while returning from office. We ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chilly Chicken, Paneer Butter Masala and Masala Cold drinks. The pocket pinch was around 800. The quality of food was good but the Pander Butter Masala was a little bit spicy. Over all it was a nice experience. The interior was like a ship cabin and the dim light made our evening. One thing needs to be mentioned that biriyani may not be ordered.

Just a mediocre suburban restaurant. Visited only a handful of times only because of convenient location. Food quality and quantity isn't very good, just digestible considering the price.

My first visit to penguin dhaba. Ambience was okay. At first as starter we ordered chicken coriander soup and crispy baby corn. They both were equally yummy. Especially crispy baby corn really impressed me. It had the perfect taste which is absent in many outlets. Then as main course chicken biryani, masala kulcha and chicken tawancha were ordered. I was not impressed with tawancha at all. Biryani was nice. But they took so much time to serve these three dishes that those starter dishes were almost digested. I would give them 3.5 for their hospitality, ambience and food but deduct 0.5 for keeping waiting.

Have been an age old customer here. The interiors are spacious both in the a.c. And non a.c. section. The food is great given the prices which are cheap. But the taste has gone down a tiny bit in the last five years. Don't take the biriyani. It has become mutton curry and rice. The naan preps and chicken dishes are good. The gravy chowmeinis really nice if you are a health conscious foodie. Do take the Jal jeera soda along. They really make it well. I am refuse at this joint and will continue to do so.

I have been a regular at Penguin Dhaba over years now, with this being the best option in the area that lacks better dine-out places. There is nothing extra-ordinary about this place, but the food is kind of good. 
Their Tandoori chilli chicken, dal makhani and veg navratna korma are definitely worth trying for and I really love the tandoori roti here (my favourite roti in the city, yes I mean that!).
I would say, dont go for chinese when you are here. North indian wont dissappoint you as much.

Ambience and service are average but I do feel like home (since I have known the people there for long), though there is a lack of professionalism in the staff.

Overall, worth giving a try. Afterall, it doesnot burn a hole in your pocket!

The restaurant is a bit clumsy and the ambience is not something to boast about. Buy boy... As soon as you dig into the menu, it's totally a different place altogether. Easy on the pocket and awesome on the tongue. Tandoori Chilli Chicken is a must try. I was surprised by the fusion of a Chinese and a Punjabi dish. Anything you take from the menu is just awesome. The waiters are courteous and would suggest you the best on their menu. The Biriyani is nothing extraordinary, but much better than what I had in some popular joints. Definitely a place I'll visit again and again.

Rejected it. Asked for onion along with the order was served when we were nearly at the end. That too the onions were the ones which were dipped in Vinegar which are served in Chinese food.
Have decided never ever visit the place.

Penguin Dhaba is one of the famous and only good restaurant in Sodepur. I am a regular customer in Penguin from my childhood to till now. I have never disappointed here with the food and ambiance.
Food quality is very good and plenty of options on menu card.
Taste wise it is also very good.
Price is cheaper than any other famous restaurants in Kolkata.
Ambiance can be improved, but as of now it is better than any other local ones.
Behavior of the service peoples are also appreciable. they will try their best to feel you comfortable.

This is one of the better outlets of the Penguin franchise. The ambiance is not that nice though, a little dark for my taste, so I ordered a takeaway. They make almost all the Indian and Chinese items as nicely as any next door Indian-Chinese-Tandoor restaurant. However one item deserves special mention, that's their crispy chilly baby corn. In another outlet of theirs I tried a horrible version of this dish, but they really make it quite nicely. Sadly they don't have a home delivery option, otherwise I would've ordered from them more often.

 But that is the thing, they are just okay, not more than that. That's not a good thing, right?

Washrooms, not good at all. They should work on ambiance a lot more. People look out for the ambiance these days. If you're making a restaurant chain, make it a nice one.

There are very few good dine-out restaurants in Sodepur and this is one of them.

The restaurant is located just aside the main road (B.T.Road) and can be easily reached from Sodepur Station via auto. However, travelling via B.T.Road is the best option.

Ambiance: The restaurant has two sections the AC and the NON Ac. The Non AC section has wooden seating arrangement and the AC one has couches and chairs. Both of them are well decorated and fine for a dine-out with family or friends. They do not have any table for 2 or 4 in the AC section. During occasions, when the place is filled, you may have to share the table which might be an intrusion of privacy (if you are a group of 2 or 4).

Food: The food is good. They have both North Indian as well as Chinese food items in their menu. The menu is not extravagant and non veg is limited to chicken mutton and prawns only. ¬†I like the proportion as compared to the price. I like their crispy chicken from Chinese starters and Kebabs from North Indian.¬†
However, the last time we ordered Drums of heaven and they simply served us chicken lollipops claiming they are drums of heaven. That was unacceptable. Even the nun and the chicken items in the main course were not up-to the mark.The food was cold and quite blant. Every chicken dish tasted almost the same.
As I have frequented this place quite a lot, I guess they were just having a bad day.Previously, I have always been satisfied with Penguin Dhaba except the last time.
Service: Service for the Umpteenth was quite decent. Again, except the last one when they seemed least concerned even about filling our glasses of water.
Overall, I have been quite upset with the degrading standards of this place.

Good place, good location, finely decorated indoors with good ambience. However the main part that's the food could have been better by a huge margin. The amount of food per plate could do better too. However reasonably priced. Constantly over crowded during pujas with no home-delivery makes this place a definite no go unless you are completely out of options. Their Hundi biriyani is worth a try though.

Visited Penguin Dhaba with my family for dinner this Friday. Having been a regular at Penguin Dhaba for over eight years now, I can safely say that their standard of food and service has remained much the same. Penguin Dhaba is not the place to be if you want to taste something different. The place was small and does not score very high on ambiance. We did not try the starters and moved directly to the main course. I ordered 'Crispy Baby Corn in hot garlic sauce', 'Singaporean Chawmin', 'Mix Fried Rice', 'Mutton Bhuna Gosht' and 'Blue Lagoon' for me and my wife & ‚ÄòTri Colour‚Äô Mocktail for our son. All the dishes were mouth-watering and well cooked. Crispy Baby Corn in the hot sauce with the mixture of herbs & spices was truly a great temptation to the tongue. Their Mutton Bhuna Gosht is one of my all-time favourites it has marvelous flavour and tasted really great. 'Blue Lagoon' was well-made, and taste amazing. Every time I drink it here feels better than last time. The quality and quantity of food is very very good & we really enjoy the dinner.

Used to be the best when it was cheap and good quality. But now it looks like a washed up business. Last visited couple weeks ago. The only thing that improved is the staffs' behaviour. Other than that it's not worth. If want a good biriyani don't go here. Instead do a little legwork and go for Zaika's biriyani.

It's a decent restaurant in sodepur with good quality food and a nice ambience (including a wooden look of the walls). Pricing is decent. Special dishes would be Biryani and other North Indian Dishes. The exclusive Hundi Biryani tastes a little different from other Biryani restaurants/outlets which is actually not very rich and tastes pretty good. The only drawback would be the waiters. I found the waiters to be non cooperative at times, specially during rush hours. Had they been a little more cordial, this could have been one of the best food joints of sodepur.

i am a regular to penguin dhaba .this definitely a good one if you love to have biriyani and north indian chicken items.it has a non ac and an ac part.the ambiance is average but the waiters r not so co-operative.they some times lack the general gesture of attending any guests. it is a go for anybody who is in the sodepur area who wants to have good biriyani without burning a hole in the pocket. two plates of mutton biriyani one chicken chap and two bottles of cold drinks will only cost you 400 rs

I was a regular at penguin for a year when I was in gnidsr. I used to go there with my friends for treats and som adda over food when we had saved up enough money. I don't know the quality of this place at present but it was quite decent when I used to go there.
The seating arrangements are quite comfy. And there are long couches which can seat 8 at a table (tentull patai 9 jon as the bengali idiom goes). So it is quite ideal with friends.
The quality of food is quite decent though not excuisite. The service is good too and the waiters pleasant. You can drop in for a bite if you are in the area. You won't be disappointed.
