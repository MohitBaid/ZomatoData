Good place ..foods are ok not soo good but beer are cheap and they offer papar for free other bar offer bhujia thats a down side and also smoking not allowed which is a big let down not a family bar and bit crowded in evening sound like fish market

Nice place to hang out with friends. Nothing posh but a simple and sweet ambience. You will find it pretty good even if you go there alone by yourself.

A very busy bar, people are always busy drinking and the waiters are always late in refilling the drinks....that's what the scene looks 365 days a year. Jokes apart it's a decent place to drink at real cheap rates. The complimentary wafers are mouth watering ....among very few bars in India where they still serve poached eggs

We managed to get a sight of this restro bar on the busy dumdum nagerbazar road..the restro stands on the road while for the bar u have to take a stroll down the backlane and reach there..the atmosphere is a typical pocket friendly always buzzing with crowd type..we ordered green salad and french fries followed by garlic chicken dry,chilli chicken and baby corn alongside kingfisher and tuborg beers..the food was average while the rowdy crowd felt a bit too loud sometimes..the bill came way too cheap and perhaps the strongest point of the visit..must visit when low on cash..

Well it's a very old bar cum restaurant thronged by the localities looking for booze and ac , it's moderately priced but not as cheap as dimple(not listed on zomato and doesn't have ac) . Well if you are looking for either ambiance, decor or proper service, well keep on searching. A little understaffed , hence the service is pretty slow. The smoking zone is outside but atleast they have seats. The food isn't any good , but when you are high you just need something to munch on so had ordered chilli chicken dry. Nothing good , was just about okay. But the price compared to quality and quantity is quite high.

This place is purely a Bar located on the bylane of dum dum road. Its a old one which is still quite popular among the localities specially the booze lovers. Pricing is very low cost but the place is quite shabby and not so good for food. Also the staffs are disorganized and not a place to food at all. Try to avoid if you wanna have food only otherwise the booze part is quite cheap here.
