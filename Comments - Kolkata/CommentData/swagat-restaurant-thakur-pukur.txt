One of the worst places in my dineline till then. So many negatives about this place, first they a huge menu ninety percent of things are not available, second their prices were also high, third is that they have very bad ambiance though the size is good but they have just wasted the whole place. After asking about two, three to which they told that they stopped it, we finally settled for a egg toast. They served it quickly but it was nowhere close to Egg Toast, it was just like a simple Bread Omelette and doesn't justifies for paying thirty rupees for it. Then we took Coffee, which tasted good it was the only positive thing about this place, but it again costed twenty rupees for such a small amount.

Poor service. Overpriced ,delivery boy did not come at desired address.
Though the paneer was good and so was the paratha. Dal tarka was nt as expected.

We tried this place recently to satiate our monthly south indian craving. The ambiance was decent compared to some of the other contemporaries. 
We called for the usual idli, vada & masala rava dosa. Although the idli and vada were nice, i specially enjoyed slurping on their sambar. Easily one of the best i have had. The rava dosa was served almost cold but the hot sambar made up for it. 
We even tried their cheese chilli toast which surprisingly turned out to be quite a star in its own right in a south indian joint. 
Would want to come back for the other delicacies we missed.
