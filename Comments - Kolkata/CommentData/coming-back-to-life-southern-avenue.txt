Outstanding experience!! Peaceful, soul touching looping music, d grass, sitting literally on the floor and some tasty food. 
Ordered chicken satay, stuffed chicken breast and brownie with ice cream. The food tasted really good, with the chicken very soft and moist. 
Fell in love with the concept - really brought us back to life!! üòäüòä
Revisit guaranteed!

The overall experience was A-W-E-S-O-M-E..... The ambiance is simple and good... The unique thing about this place is the sitting at the basement... Coming to the food,we ordered-
1) Cold Coffee With Ice Cream
2) Mediterranean Chicken Sandwich
3) Harrisa Chicken With Boiled Vegetables
4) Roasted/Grilled Chicken With Boiled Vegetables And Herb Rice

The food was great... The best thing about the Cold Coffee was the Ice Cream which was given like a bottle Cap... The creamy meyo inside the chicken sandwich was something which will make you crave for it again and again.. and the other 2 dishes doesn't need my review becoz I would recommend each of every person to try them...

Nice concept restaurant of eclectic mix which also offers massage.  However it fails in the basic need of a restaurant/cafe,  which is good food and good service.  Why I felt so bad for it, was they spent so much on d√©cor,  but none to ensure that service was good and quality is maintained.the waiter itself is also part-time cook, half the stuff on menu is not available, service is very slow.  How i hope the scrap the d√©cor,  sell it and hire so quality chef or waiters.

I always have a thing for pretty decorations. And silence. How amazing it is to find a place which offers you both of that in the chaos of life and city. This place is beyond beautiful. They even have separate Kids corner. And for book lovers you will get a reading corner too. Even they have a beauty corner. They serve amazing food as well. So if you are willing for amazing Instagram worthy pictures and good food, you can head to this pretty place without a second thought. üíû‚ù§
About food,
We ordered Cappuccino, which was good really. 
Along with that, we ordered Penne Pasta with Parmesan and Mushroom, which was served with 4 slices of garlic bread, it tasted amazing. Being pasta lovers, we loved it.
For main course, we ordered Stuffed Chicken Breast with Boiled Veggies, Mash with Cheese served on a bed of rice, it was good as well. Mash with Cheese was as smooth as it could be. They serve good amount of food.
And their hospitality was really good. 

The ratings are as follows,
Food- 5/5
Ambience- 5/5
Service- 5/5

A great experience after age! What really got us excited was the floor level seating arrangement, the coming back to life ambiance, the artificial grass, wooden furniture and offcourse the food! The roasted lemon chicken salad was mixed to perfection. Sicilian risotto had the balanced flavors and their signature dish stuffed chicken breasts was the very much required high in the menu! Its a must try! A sure revisit!

Looking for a place to sooth yourself while you enjoy a talk over some healthy food and drinks ? Then this's the ultimate solution. With a huge space, CTBL provides for a kids corner. The music is in sync with the concept. 

The best part is you gotta sit down on the floor and lean back on the innovative seats. There's just peace to stick around you. Lots of positive energy and soul pleasing decors. 

Drop in and enjoy!

Been there today with my friends for lunch. We were 8 of us and ordered 8 items. The service was very slow. The 8 items came between 30mins - 1 hour. And the restaurant was almost empty. 
Full marks for the ambience and comfort. The basement area is very spacious. Food was good. Hope to come back to try more dishes if they provide quick service.

Location near to menoka cinema . This place was there in my list for a long time , the ambiance was beyond brilliant so there it gets a straight 5 . Decor - it has both a gypsy blend and Chinese blend , the write ups on the walls was amazing . The best part is the sitting arrangement that's really unique , we don't generally sit on the floor for our lunch or dinner well in my childhood I use to do that but it's too much chair table affair . This sitting arrangement was totally Chinese thing but the glitch is there speciality is not Chinese ,so decor -4.5 . Now food most important part - me and my friend went to this place ,we had ordered roasted lemon chicken salad well I loved it and the other dish was grilled chicken in mushroom sauce in this one veggies was a bit less boiled or I would say it was almost raw but the herb rice was nice I asked them not to put butter they listened well the chicken was scrumptious , it was soft and tender , so food gets 4 . Service was really nice - 4.5 .

As a woman in my late twenties, I feel like I‚Äôm living the toughest phase of my life. This is the time when I am supposed to start taking responsibilities ‚Äì not just of my family, but of myself. I am supposed to have chosen a path along which I will roll for the rest of my life, professionally or otherwise; I‚Äôm expected of me to have set myself into motion. Dealing with such responsibilities and expectations makes me anxious, which is normal. It is even normal to fail. And yet, when I stumble, I feel disappointed.

The cafe is situated in the interior of the southern avenue and a little hard to locate initially. That place has a nice vibe to and the decor is really innovative. The dream catchers, the low seating arrangement makes it really different. 
Coming to the food we tried the blueberry mojito and Oreo shake. The Oreo shake was nothing great and it tasted more like a plain chocolate drink.
The burger and the skewers were nice. The best thing about it that it's pocket friendly.

This new cafe is the perfect place to spend some calming and refreshing time with oneself or with others. They have a smaller seating area on the ground floor and a sprawling basement. I love the basement area with its hanging dream catchers, super comfortable floor seating, soothing music and immensely positive vibes. 

Of the food, I absolutely loved their Chicken Caesar Salad. The Chicken Satay was another thing that I quite liked. I happened to visit the place twice, on invitations, with friends, but will surely visit this place alone some time soon to just curl up with a book and relax which sipping on my coffee and munching on the Caesar salad.

Amazing ambience. The decor sets it apart, with DreamCatchers adorning the walls,  soothing music,  dimly lit conditions,  that instantly calm you down! Probably the first of it's kind with basement seating, with an artificial grass matting on the floor. The cushions on the wooden skeleton of the chairs covered with jute cloth,  and are both comfortable and close to nature.  
Definitely a place to hang out and for private parties. You have a book shelf, picturesque walls for the perfect portrait shot! 
The food is good, equal parts spicy and juicy.  The chicken wings are recommended and so is the shake.  It's reasonable too.
It deserves a place on the check list.

The name goes very well with the kind of ambience this place provides. It will seem just like you are having a food and adda in your or your friend's house. Located near Karma Fitness Studio, its not very hard to find. As soon as you enter, you can see a long stretch of green grass laid till the end with tables and chairs with no legs. You need crouch and make yourself comfortable the way you like to sit. To be judgemental we went for:
‚Ä¢ Watermelon Starry Sparklers: to quench your thirst it will be a perfect option. It will also go well with any spicy dish as a coolant.
‚Ä¢ Peri Peri Chicken Burger: when you find onion rings in your burger you are sure your burger gonna taste fab, and surely it didn't disappoint. You need to make your hand messy to fully gobble it up.
‚Ä¢ Roast Chicken with boiled veggies & mashed potato: typical continental dish with chicken skewers roasted to perfection and topped with tangy tamarind sauce alongside boiled crunchy veggies and mashed potatoes.
‚Ä¢ Chilli Garlic Noodles: yeah they serve chinese but in a limited option. You will not find the menu in zomato. But I must say the noodles tasted really well, wasn't expecting it to taste this good.
I think its one of a kind place in kolkata where seating arrangements are made like this, which is truly the USP of this place. With mystic music playing at the back and the whole place decorated with dream catchers will indeed soothe you out surely defines its tagline "find your inner peace". Pocket pinch is on the average side. Unique place for a calm & romantic date or to chill with friends & family, one visit is must; Highly recommended.
P.S.: They have separate reading section, kids playing section, and beauty section. And you need to be comfortable enough to take off your shoes.

There are so many things around us which truly fascinate us but we are mostly unaware of the actual cause that‚Äôs making it so fascinating!

These days cafes are opening up almost everywhere to delight you with their interesting affair of food and ambiance to be absolutely top notch. What i love mostly about Cafes are the informal and no judgemental kind of time spent there. You don‚Äôt have to bother or worry if your need to be in a formal state to dine ,it is as simple as dining the way in a relaxed manner you like (Of course respectfully) . But when a cafe not just helps you to feel free but also helps you cope up with some stress and feel better in the negative lifestyle that you live, then it is a place much needed for one and all .The cafe that i am talking about is COMING BACK TO LIFE CAFE that helps you reconnect with what nature has in store for you. Elements like Spirit,Air,Water,Fire & Earth is what one needs to look upon to live a peaceful life . This Cafe stresses on rejuvenating oneself to a better lifestyle by taking a pause in life from your stressful life and feel the elements that nature has for you. Some of the activities and stuffs that you can come across here at first is a huge spread of turf grass that has low level seating arrangements easily to accomodate 90 people at least . The idea behind having a low level seating is so that one can connect everything with ease at a ground level. Moving on you would hear soulful trance music which keeps playing on loop mode to connect with your mind and inner soul over here. The total experience of letting your footwear go and walking with your naked feet on the turf grass is a way we can reach out to Mother Earth without any interference. The walls of this place have everyday life messages scribbled here and there which helps as a motivation to overcome failures and struggles. The whole atmosphere is maintained in a very pleasing and spiritual way with hanging dream catchers all over the place and almost dim lights setting the mood just so right. There is a little libary in one of the corners if you wish to sit down with a book, or if you come along with kids then you can let them free to play at the children‚Äôs corner . And the best part about this place is that it is all underground letting you be really away from the outside world. The next time you want to spend some alone time or want your group eating in the most peaceful and different way then you know now where to set your destination.

Sit on grass(Indoors) and spend a quality time with your bae accompanied with soft music and GOOD food.üíù
Where: southern Avenue. Take the opposite lane of Tolly P.S and it's close to "Take a break" cafe. Better to book a Uber rather.
Ambiance: I am spellbound with the tenor. You gotta to believe it when you see it yourself. This cafe is beautifully decorated with wall paintings, amazing lights and flowers.
The basement is full of surprises. Beautifully covered with faux grass and brick wallpapers this place is bound to give you some good vibes.
That's what we need amidst all the chaos in life, right?
It's spacious with a 90 seater arrangement.
They even have a book corner. Also there's a cute corner for kids. Can you believe that?‚ù§

Now coming to the food, they serve a pinch of love with every dishes. Thumbs up to the hospitality.üëç
Quality and quantity deserves special mention.
Pasta served with mushrooms and chicken in white sauce tasted like heaven. Soft..filling and perfect!
Chicken steak was equally good. Mashed potato stuff was huge in quantity and that made me happier.üòÑ
Healthy and delicious altogether!
We were charmed with the finale of "chocolate mudpie". Not too sweet yet it left a sweet impact on our tongues and minds.
Loving the spirit of Pentagram (what they believe). Keep growing!üëç
Being a food blogger  I would to visit this place again!!

I would like to thank First Idea PR and Atreya Paul for inviting me over to this cafe that is so different from everything we have in the city.¬†
Coming Back to Life is one of a kind place. I have never encountered something like this before. This place has a very zen vibe to it, a calm and composed feel. The cafe sprawls across a huge area, with the main cafe just at the entrance. You may want to take the stairs and go downstairs to find a huge seating area that is mostly used as a salon, spiritual workshop and kids area. Nicely furnished with faux grass, it is well maintained and nicely lit. This place is perfect for days when you want to have a little 'me time' and is also great for going on a date.
In case you want to show up with your gang, you can do that too!

Coming to the food, here's what we tried :

Elderflower Iced Tea - Very different from what I have tasted so far. Had a nice and quaint aftertaste. Give it a try.
Watermelon Mojito - Nice and refreshing. Nothing to write home about.
Roast chicken and lemon salad - Crunch, fresh and a breather from all the regular junk.
Pesto Chicken Bruschetta - THE BEST OF THE LOT. A must try at this place.
Smoked Chilli Chicken sandwich - Spicy and nice. The quantity is quite a bit so this can fill you up easily.
Harissa Chicken skewers - Another favourite. Lovely texture and very juicy as well. Would order it over and over again.
Schezwan Veg fried rice - The usual indian-chinese mix. Definitely order this with the chicken.
Pepper Chicken - Liked this quite a very bit. Goes very well with the veg rice. Give it a go.
Chilly garlic noodles - Pretty decent fare. Give it a try.

To sum it up, the experience was far from average. It was nice, but because we were a group of 7 we did get a little bored albeit the music that did not sync with the place. That being said, you should visit this place at least once to experience that peace of mind.
Thank you

Coming back to Life is a place where you can reconnect to life.  It's a huge 90 seated restaurant boasting of a mixture of Chinese and Continental soul food. The decor is absolutely brilliant and has some interesting trance music. 
The restaurant has a reading corner, a nail and foot corner and a children corner. One can sit down on false plush grass in the basement. 
I have tried some interesting options like  lemon roast chicken salad, grilled fish with sir fried vegetables,  mixed noodles and fry chilli chicken. 
Apart from these I have tried some mocktails too served in interesting glasses which were refreshing.

This beautifully decorated cafe is located in Mudiali diagonally opposite of Karma Fitness and just next to Mandarin restaurant and on the way to my office of course. Though most of the time I don't see many people inside but somehow I wanted to visit this cafe 'cause I said the decoration is beautiful. Finally visited it during puja time with my friend. We both wanted the table next to the glass wall and there's only one such table. But as the entire place was full we were asked to go downstairs. Downstairs is completely different. Dimly lit, entire floor is covered with faux grass carpet and seating is on floor ( very low table with floor touching bench) ideal for long adda with a big group of friends. But as we wanted to sit upstairs so they arranged it immediately when others left. Staffs are very courteous. Food we ordered very basic & simple 'cause we were not hungry enough. Ordered Mexican fries ( French fries with Mexican spices) along with 2 mocktails. Mocktails were good but the potatoes in Mexican fries were soft and not crispy. Next was chicken sausage in balsamic dressing and it was good. Lastly ordered chocolate mud-pie and it was super yum. I liked the food but the interior and ambience I liked even better. Very eye soothing decor, very peaceful place. Will visit again. Debanjana Raha

This is a spiritual cafe, a place where you can find peace and solace. The tranquility will help you rediscover your inner self. 
Location: This place is located near Karma fitness studio , close to Menoka cinema. 
As you enter, this place appears to be a cosy beautiful cafe, but once to go downstairs , you are up for a surprise!! 
Underneath is a huge 90seater restuarant, complete with a kid's area, a mini spa and a nail paint studio.
The food and drinks served made  the whole experience all the more magical.
Drinks served : cold coffee, passionfruit mojito, watermelon iced tea. The cold coffee tasted perfect where as the other drinks were soothing.
Items served : 
Lemon roast chicken salad: Light, with generous amount of chicken, lettuce and a hint of lime, this salad is filling and perfect for those who are looking for something healthy and light.
Grilled Fish with Stir Fried Veggies : The dish is beautifully presented and the grilled fish with exotic vegetables , in white sauce made for a lovely dish.
Dry Chilli Chicken : A perfectly prepared dry chilli chicken is simple, common but comfort food for me.
Chicken Sweet Corn Soup : Another common item but prepared with extra helpings of chicken and corn.
Thai Spicy Crispy Fish : Large chunks of fish satayed in a spicy ,sweet sauce is a fish lovers delight.
Pesto Chicken Brusetta : lovely dish , beautifully presented.
Chocolate Mud Pie : Every meal must end in a sweet note and this is indeed a delightful dessert.

This place is very near to my residence. Initially I never knew that the place has a basement sitting as well. The basement is simply nice and well decorated. Ambience tends to a dark gloomy eatery.But the music is not nice, the music is very irritating and resist you to have food. We had 
Chicken Bruschetta, victorian fish and chips, burgers, Harisa chicken, Peanut butter and dates shake and tiramisu flavored cappucino.
Food is nice and well spiced, most importantly the cost will surely not create a hole in your pocket, a good visit with friends.
Just to add, they are also planning to start nail art and tattoo, but I am not sure when

The restraunt near mandarin aka COMING BACK TO LIFE is a beautiful restraunt. It has two floors.It is a bit overpriced. The food quality is'nt that good, but the quantity is good. The service is good and interior is very nice. It remains a bit empty even on Sundays which makes it a peak place. The food is okay. The restaurant is worth a visit.....

I would give it a 6/10

My friend recommended this place. It is a very pretty well lit cafe, has two floors! The seating arrangement at the basement is very unique and cool. Ordered burrito and elderflower iced tea which was amazing , wasn't expecting it to be that good. The staff is very very courteous and very efficient. Would love to visit again.

This is located under Mandarin Restaurant in Southern Avenue.We sat in the basement.Loved the ambience and d√©cor. The basement has grass carpet on which you have to tred barefoot and chairs are also on floor level.The ambience is calm and soothing with soulful chants and dreamcatchers.
The food was offbeat too. We had green tea with lemon peel and rose petals,harissa chicken skewers,thai spice crispy fish,fish n chips,sweetcorn balls.
They also have a side beauty section with tattoos,soothing massage,nail art,etc.
A great experience and i recommend a visit to this place.

Visited this cafe two weeks back. The theme is spiritual and everything that brings you back to life and keeps you positive. Though I hated the music, eriee, spooky and I didn't like eating out here at all. The interiors are also a little odd. While some corners are good with plants and good vibes. One corner had red hand painted imprintd. 
The place miserably failed to create a good vibe.

We ordered for the following- 
1) Hazelnut cappuccino- was good 
2) tiramisu cappuccino- was good
3) garlic bread with cheese- not good at all
 Strands of I don't know what kind of cheese. Taste was really bad
4) Aglio Oglio spaghetti - was the best dish of the evening! 

Not very happy with my experience and I won't visit the place again. Though it is a stone's throw away from my office

Boost your inner self @ Coming Back to Life

Follow on www.konizfoodwheels.wordpress.com

Ever thought of rewinding back going back to your roots? Ever thought of relaxing during your odd work assignment? Ever felt like running away from your hectic schedule and walking barefoot on grass? Ever thought of sipping your smoothie while mantras are being chanted at the backdrop? If you haven't, it's time you try it out and bring yourself back to life. 

Energy and health cafes are trending the food map of Kolkata recently. But this one is a bit different. Introducing you to the newest energy cafe of town - Coming Back to Life. The cafe has been energised keeping in mind the fact the five basic elements (air, water, fire, spirit and Earth). It is a place to search for your inner self at peace,  a place to relax and a place to evoke the positivity in you. The cafe is a brainchild of Ms. Meenakshi who is a distinguished astrologer herself.

Location : This cafe is located at Lake Avenue, near Menoka Cinema.

Decor and Ambience : To start off elucidating about the decor,  I probably cannot stop penning down. Its soothing and serene. You will feel a sense of calmness. The dream catchers,  the peacock feather,  the nylon grass,  the Green carpets,  the amazing messages on the wall,  the rustic appearance on the wall and much more. The outlet is a two storied structure, the cafe being on the ground floor and a beautiful section lies underneath in the basement. The basement divine - low seating arrangement with natural jute fibres, the Green carpets,  the barefoot walking all connects you to your self. The cafe has a well stocked library, a beauty zone for distressing one‚Äôs self, kid‚Äôs corner and an art pad for the young and talented artists for showcasing their creations.

Food : Energised and detoxifying food and drink items feature on the menu of this cafe. They offer Grilled salads, pasta, burritos, risotto, shakes and smoothies. They have a tie up with the unit of Crossroad  Cafe who are their food partners.

Beverages :
1. Cherry banana smoothie - Bananas and cherries in this delicious yogurt smoothie give you a break from the same old strawberry-banana smoothies.

2. Blueberry yoghurt smoothie - Healthy blueberry yogurt smoothie  is great to keep you energized. Nutrient-packed with fruit, protein, greens, fiber and antioxidants , it's a must try.

3. Virgin mojito - The Mint Lime Mojito is a great summer drink. The sweet taste accompanied by fragrance of mint and addition of tangy lime makes for a really refreshing summer beverage.

4. Chocolate cookie cold coffee - Simple and delicious chocolate chip gelato with iced coffee. 

5. Mint Oreo shake - The Oreo Mint Shake is a frosty dessert that features a mint-flavored shake with crumbled Oreo wafers blended in.

Salad:
1. Grilled zucchini salad - Grilled Zucchini Salad with fantastic Mediterranean-inspired flavors is  the perfect summertime salad. Tender grilled zucchini gets topped with a light, refreshing salad of arugula, pecorino cheese, and toasted pinenuts.

Starters:
1. Harissa chicken skewers - This is delectable chicken skewers seasoned boldly with harissa paste. Harissa spices up this chicken dish for a tasty Middle-Eastern flavour. 

2. Pesto chicken brushchettas - Pesto Chicken Bruschetta is a simple versatile dish made of pesto baked chicken and baguette. With the wonderful flavor of pesto, cheese and bruschetta topping it feels decadent without all of it. 

Mains:
1. Harissa chicken sandwich -  A tasty Moroccan grilled chicken sandwich with preserved lemon tapenade, pickled red onions and spicy harissa mayo. Amazing indeed. 

2. Classic chicken burrito - A soft  flour tortilla filled with seasoned chicken, rice, beans, Cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, guacamole and lettuce sets up a filling option. 

3. Egg chicken roll - This is a classic egg Chicken wrap, which is indeed filling. The mayonnaise simply enriches it. 

4. Grilled chicken in pepper mushroom sauce - A simple and wholesome chicken tossed in mushroom sauce,  topped with mushroom and caramelized onions. 

5. Roast chicken - This is served with mashed potato, rice and garlic bread is simply awesome with mild flavours livening up your taste buds. 

6. Penne with parmesan and chicken - The cheesy garlic parmesan chicken penne pasta is indeed a flavorful and delicious affair. 

Desserts:
1. Monte carlo - This is a layer of yellow cake and a layer of chocolate iced in buttercream and topped with a smooth layer of chocolate fudge .

2.Red velvet - This has a very dramatic looking gait with its bright red color sharply contrasted by a white cream cheese frosting which is a visual treat by itself. 

3. Mud pie - This is a chocolate-based dessert pie served with ice cream.The treat contains a gooey chocolate sauce on top of a crumbly chocolate crust which is heavenly.

Drive off all the negativity around you. Drop into CBTL, rejuvenate your souls and spread positivity  around.
Cheers!

This is a very nice place.¬†
And this is going to be in the top-5 list, if I'm suggesting someone any cafe.
This is a Continental Cafe which offers food and at the same time peace.
                    

The whole cafe is nicely decorated. They have an arrangement in the basement area too that can accommodate more than 50 heads offering toys for the kids.

You can sit on the carpet grass and take selfies with the wall.

On the wall, you'll find so many life's motivating lines and DREAM CATCHERS.

I'm basically in love with the basement area of this place.

Now coming to the food..Food is super good.
                    

Me and foodie friends were invited for the food tasting. And we tasted -
Banana Smoothie,
Blueberry Yogurt Smoothie,
Mint Oreo Shake,
Grilled Chicken Zucchini Salad,
Harissa Chicken Skrewers,
Presto Chicken Brushchettas,
Harissa Chicken Sandwich,
Classic Chicken Burrito,
Egg Chicken Roll,
Grilled Chicken in Pepper Mushroom Sauce,
Roast Chicken with Mashed Potato, Rice and Garlic Bread,
Penne Pasta with Parmesan and Chicken
Red Velvet cake &
Mudpie
                    

So now what are you waiting for? Don't waste your time reading the reviews only go and give a treat to the taste-buds...
thank you for the invitation team CBTL...

Rajdeep da thank you for leading our team. I'm a foodie and I'm a Panch Phoron forever.

A soulful trip to calmness and tranquility to rejuvenate one's tired self - Coming Back to Life..!

Imagine a small little cozy place, down the alley of a little road, offering cozy sitting options along with a relaxing atmosphere and fingerlicking delicious food and drinks; who would not want to throw away the hectic mundane life and run here to have some peace of life. While the interior is soothing and gives a pleasantry upon entering, the culinary offerings are equally good, if not less. The entire place has been decorated beautifully mostly resembling a natural paradise. Ask for the basement, as it has been decked up a notch higher, with the entire floor covered with grass. The seats are all low laying, where one can sit down comfortably, with their legs folded, without the formal atmosphere of showing up in a stylish table and chair and enjoy the relaxing ambiance and the surrounding music alone or with your friends. There is a separate beauty section as well, which gives you tips and suggestion to groom yourself, in order to uplift your grace and personality, and lets you be the person you always wanted to be.

Very recently we were invited here for a brief tasting session and what followed was a array of surprises and gastronomical delighters. Following were the items which was served to us:

1) Cherry Banana Smoothie

2) Blueberry Youghurt Smoothie

3) Virgin Mojito

4) Mint Oreo Shake

5) Grilled Zucchini Salad

6) Harissa Chicken Skewers

7) Pesto Chicken Bruschettas

8) Harissa Chicken Sandwich

9) Classic Chicken Burrito

10) Egg Chicken Roll

11) Grilled Chicken in Pepper Mushroom Sauce

12) Roast Chicken with Mashed Potato, Rice and Garlic Bread

13) Penne with Parmesan and Chicken

14) Montecarlo

15) Red Velvet Pastry

16) Chocolate Mudpie

While most of these items were a hit to our tastebuds, a special shoutout and mention goes to Cherry Banana Smoothie, Pesto Chicken Bruschettas, Egg Chicken Roll and Roast Chicken with Mashed Potato, Rice and Garlic Bread. The Chocolate Mudpie served as an exotic dessert, complimented very well by the softness and lusciousness of the Red Velvet Pastry. There were a lot many items we missed out, but then there is always a next time. Being a new entry to the food scene of this city, the food quality will definitely be exceeding than what we had today, but considering all the aspects of judgement, the caf√© did fairly well according to my consideration. A perfect place to mingle with nature and enjoy the calmness and tranquility, this place surely deserves to be on the toplist of the next best thing this city has to offer.
