Located at karunamoyee beside Bapi Da's momo.

This stall is primarily run for deliveries because the crowd generally belongs to Bapi Da's Solid Gulp. One of those evening when I was really hungry and solid Gulp had run out of stock and hence visiting Khyber. 

I had ordered for an egg chicken roll and a plate of chicken noodles to be packed. The chicken roll was decent, nothing extraordinary. The spoiler was the noodles. I had to dig in to find chunks of chicken also it was too oily. Until and unless you're totally out of options , I wouldn't recommend going here .

I can not rate this place even. Had to take a chicken roll in an evening, but I was much unhappy than ever. They are very much unprofessional in making the food. Very bad experience.

I have tried fish finger at  this place. It's very bad. Almost no fish inside at all. Moreover it's pretty dry and smelly. The experience is so bad that I will not recommend my enemies to go there. 1 is because can not rate lower than that.

The food is okayish, and as the name and place seems, for a quick takeaway.
They should really work on their tandoori items. Has a stiff competition but this place does not disappoint.

This is a recently opened place. Good place for takeaway. Has a wide variety of food at reasonable prices. Especially their rolls are very good.

This is a roadside outlet at the karunamoyee, sector 2, salt lake..it specializes in different types of mouth watering tikkas and kebabs and delicious rolls and they offer the same at a very pocket friendly rate..i have tried their chicken tandoor roll with cheese add on , which cost me rs 60 + 20 (for the cheese)...it tasted really good and nullified my hunger as well..one can easily try this outlet to satisfy their kebab and roll cravings without creating an emptiness in their wallets..
