Those who read my last review,please ignore a part of it!ONLY CHICKEN & BEEF PYARE KEBAB IS GOOD HERE!Else than that,THE TIKKA & BANJARA KEBAB WHICH COMES FOR ‚Çπ 30 PER PLATE IS UNDERCOOKED,ITS RAW,HAS BONES,AND DOES NOT TASTE GOOD IN ANY WAY.Only 3 stars for the Pyare Kebab....
(From a true food critic!!)

I recently had a Chicken Roll but unfortunately it wasn't to my liking at all.It is very filling mainly due to the Laccha Paratha that was used which I'm not a fan of in any way.

A small restaurant with amazing food offerings. This place is known for its rolls!! The pricing is dirt cheap. 25 bucks for a beef kebab roll which is my favorite here. Trust me it is very filling and delicious. Must try place for all roll lovers.üòç

On 20.12.2015 at 2 PM I rang up to book food order for home delivery. The staff who received the phone was perhaps uneducated, did not understand English, absent in manner and courteousness and¬† as a whole¬† was a bull shit. I wonder why and on what strength they serve the home delivery orders when they are unable to understand the order. It appears as if the restaurant is in any Mouzi Busti area what I gathered from the back ground of shouting and slangs.

It is situated on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road.They serves quality beef rolls,kebabs are very delicious. They also used to serve snacks in the evening. Chicken haryali and chicken tikkas are amazingly tasty. Prices are also reasonable and pocket friendly. But,yes,it is not air-conditioned,so you have to suffer a little if you have a plan to seat and dine.Otherwise it's awesome.Winter special Nihari and Mutton paya with Puri in the early morning is speciality of them,highly recommended.

Serves one of the best beef rolls. Paratha and kebab both were awesome in taste. Kebabs were so soft and mouth melting. Best place in locality for evening snacks...

This place is just awesome if you have small budget or want to have good beef. I visited three times here. The beef seekh, khiri kebab is a must order. Beef is well cooked, moist except one time. Lachha paratha or nun is good. Beef quorma, hariyali kebab, tangri kebab is also good. 
You can have a feast (for two) in a budget of Rs.500

I generally target Arafat around 7.30 pm since that is the time when the beef kati and the kheeri kababs start getting cooked. K decided to join in so we entered and ordered the following - Beef biryani, Beef Bhuna, Beef Kheeri, Beef Kathi, tandoori roti, and two cold drinks. The Biryani arrived first with a plate of Beef Kaliya. We did not order this, so we asked if there were other options. The server said there was a rezala, and we decided to go for it. The Rezala came in within 2-3 minutes, but K did not like it much, because the meat piece was not soft. I had to break it down into bits, and mixed it with the gravy and it tasted okay with the Biryani.

However, then begun the best bit - the kababs started to come in. The kheeri and the boti were both melt-in-your-mouth, and we had to order a second round, and both of us marveled at the softness of it. We downed the perfectly made tandoori roti with  the kabab, and drank tall bottles of Mountain Dew and Pepsi to finish off. Our bill came to 190/- for two.

Arafat has been my savior in college when it came to beef, and it continues to be so till date. I have never really eaten anything but Indian here, and that too, only beef. Especially the beef biryani and the beef kabab. Although they do have mutton and chicken in their menu, right around 7.30-8.00 p.m.  they start grilling beef kababs, which are mindblowingly tender and incredibly tasty. I would run out of wherever I stayed around Kolkata, because this gets over by 8.30 at most. 

Apart from the Biryani, they also make a tasty bhuna, which my friend loves. I am more of a beef chaap person, but truthfully, I dont mind the bhuna. I have never really seen the Chinese menu, indeed, I am heavily doubtful such a thing exists. But I am not much of a fan of the fried beef kababs here. Its too oily for my liking. However, I absolutely adore the kheeri as well.

After having read so much reviews about this place, a desire had triggered within myself to visit the same. So I was also seeking for the perfect opportunity to bang at this place. 
On a winter evening was passing through Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road. Suddenly a smoky smell surrounded my nostrils. And then my eyes were looking for something special, something hot. Just then it caught hold of a place called Arafat right across the road. Yes today is the day I was longing for. Had crossed the road and ordered their beef kebabs. I ordered three kathis. It was served with some onions and garnished with some coriander and lemon. Amazing is the word that first hit me. The kebabs were the best beef kebabs I ever had. It was soft, juicy and succulent. I wondered whether I was having beef or anything else. Because the beef kebabs in any eateries are always stiff and tough. But this one was way above the rest. Words might fall short of describing this awesomeness. And I ended up having seven kathis alone.
The ambiance is nothing great to talk about. But the service was. They were very prompt with their action. I am looking forward to try their other dishes as well. Thumbs Up..!!!!

I had seen this place one day while driving down Rafi Ahmed Kidwai one day and then I decided to Google it and the reviews on Zomato were the first few hits. I liked what I read. I had to be there. So I got hold of a fellow beef lover. And we landed up there late....really late. I called them up and kept them from shutting down. They relented. We asked for a few romalis, beef sheekh kebabs and beef bhuna masala. They said their cook had left and they could only provide tandoori rotis. This time we relented.  One of the three kebabs turned out to be undercooked and the beef bhuna was a tad bit salty. The tandoori rotis were very soft, so no complains there. Honestly I expected a lot more but at the same time landing up as late as quarter past eleven and eating leftovers cannot be the basis for judgement. I did like what I saw and somehow I have a feeling they are going to dish out really good stuff in the near future. Yes, I am willing to give the another chance. No actually to be frank I am willing to give myself another opportunity to have a go at their beef-y menu again. Soon.
Went back last evening with a few friends. And we were simply blown away. The beef seekh kebabs were simply out of the world. Really tender and succulent. Also unimaginably good were the boti kebabs. Then we gorged on the beef bhuna and parathas. The parathas were delectable and so was the bhuna. The combination itself was blissful. We ordered seekh kebabs, boti kebabs, tikka kebabs, bhuna and quorma and parathas and shelled out only 330 bucks. Going back soon. Really soon.

As my fellow foodies said this place was a regular for us in our college days ...... the food was pocket friendly and cheap and filling three very important criteria for hungry and broke youngsters !!! Our favourite was the beef roll .... though it was not the tastiest roll its taste and price insured our regular patronage .... the beef bhuna combined with either the  paratha or the egg biryani were also pretty good and we ordered it often enough. Please note that this is a place strictly for meat lovers.

Tasty food from a local eatery!
3 out of 5

Of the many food outlets in Wellesley, Arafat Chinese restaurant is a value for money kind of place. This very simple looking food outlet creates decent Chinese fare. Despite their name, their north Indian dishes are delightful preparations. Their speciality might in fact lean towards their north Indian delicacies (strange but true). The comfortable sitting arrangements only serves to further enhance your dining experience. The prices are reasonable and justify the kind of food served here. The food does not take very long to arrive at your table; you will always get piping hot food here.

They make very flavoursome and light soups that are well seasoned and contain a good amount of meat and vegetables. Whether it is their hot and sour soup or Thai soup, all of them have a perfect balance of sweetness, saltiness, spiciness and sourness. Even their sweet corn soup is tasty and heart warming. 

Some of those delightful preparations that you can sample are chilli chicken, hot garlic chicken, Manchurian chicken and Sichuan chicken. Their one plate of fried rice and Hakka or gravy noodle will prove quite a task for people with a very small appetite to demolish.

The place is essentially a great place for having north Indian dishes. Their biryanis (though not like the ones that you get in muslim restaurants Shiraz or Zeeshan) are definitely satisfactory in taste and flavour. Thus, do not hesitate to try out their light but aromatic chicken and mutton biryanis. For meat lovers, their juicy and succulent kebabs are one of a kind. Chicken tandoori, chicken reshmi kebab and chicken tikka kebab are some dishes that you have to order here. Even their mutton rezala, mutton chhap and chicken masala are mouth melting options that go really well with their rotis.
