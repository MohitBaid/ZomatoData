I celebrated my son's 13th birthday at Hondo's. We were 6 of us. At first i found the place shabby, but later stayed back and ordered 'Thor burger'. Herb rice and Basa in lemon sauce. The burger was the best in Kolkata according to me. The music was good..there was something 'fun' about this place. Writing post cards , photographs and the friendly staff made the day special for us. We promised to come back to this place again very soon.

One hell of a place! It looks small from outside and you will have to wait because it is always full of people. The food is incredibly delicious. With a wide ranged variety of delicious food the service is excellent! A place where you can go hundred of times not just for the food but the people there!

Lets find out what this small 24*7 food has to offer to a already full of cafe city.

I went there with a friend and luckily got a table.

Ambiance and decor: None. Not those fancy caf√©s out there. Tables are small and cramped. But they have a nice collection of music. Around 3 to 4 tables. Definitely not the place for that cozy date.

Staff: Not very knowledgeable about what's on the plate. Not the most polished ones out there. But the owner to there to solve your queries. 

By this time you must be wondering why the hell i rated this 4. 5, and the answer lies in what they serve, THE FOOD.

Yummy moist meat balls, and juicy steaks. The pork ribs were full of flavors and they cook your meat just right, be it chicken, beef or pork as well as fish. The burgers are a treat to watch.  A must visit place place for all the meat lovers. This place beats places like the steak factory and chillis hands down when it comes to Food. They pair their staks really well with the right amount of veggies. The dessert section lacked options but tasted good.
I also ordered white chicken pasta and it was also good. Quantity was amazing with the loads of grilled chicken.

Overall: A very pocket friendly place when you take the food into accout. A huge thumbs up for their food the the guy running the place deserves a special mention. Thank you, for serving us such good food at not so steep prices. Kolkata needs more places like this.

Great food. Loveeeeed the burgers. Tried the roxette and the Thor. The Thor is so huge that I couldn't finish it. Every burger is served with fries. And I loved the Teekha Mojito. Usually, nonalcoholic drinks are too sweet. But this was anything but! Wish the place was a bit bigger. Great music too.

The very first thing I had in here was the classic hamburger(without chees) and that too at my home, because I was in a hurry and decided to take it home. They told me that it won't feel that good if I take it home. Instead to get the real feel of the burger I should have it there only. But I insisted on the other way, I took it home and it was and still is the best burger in the whole city. It was so amazing that I fell in love with the food theu serve.

Later I've tried some other items like the bacon wrapped chicken, wolverine burger, chicken noodles, fried chicken balls and all were super awesome. It's a must visit for every food lover. Or if you feel a bit down just go and have a hamburger in there. Don't take it home, because the ambiance is something in here. Though it's a small joint but the vibes in here are not small ladies and gentlemen.

This is such an awesome food place. It has all my favourite continental food like burgers, steaks and salads and it is served by Sisir with so much love and warmth. The atmosphere is homey, the decor quirky and the postcard game innovative. We had the Greek Salad, Bacon wrapped Chicken ( Hogged Chick ) and Beef Tenderloin Steak ( Cow Beef thankfully not buffalo ). They also gave us a souvenir pic of our visit to the place. Its a little cramped for space but one could always order take aways or home deliveries.
Worth a try for conti lovers !!

The beauty of this place is such that it has a unique quality of transporting you to happier times. With innovative graphiti on the walls to dim lights hanging from the ceiling, this restaurant boasts of a capacity of 12 people, i.e 3 tables. Though the restaurant is small, the magnitude of the doze of warmth it provides is huge. Spick and span, it is a tidy outlet with a very beautiful vibe.

The most notable part of this joint is that they are open 24x7 which is one of the very rarest quality of a restaurant in the City of Joy.

It remains crowded most of the time. With people always waiting outside for their turn proves the class of this place! Starting from the superb hospitality to the splendid food, one will surely have an awesome experience here at Hondo's.

As the manager of the place suggested, we went for :

‚Ä¢ Hogged Chick : Six pieces of bacon wrapped chicken fillets tossed in sauce will definitely attract a foodie for sure. The fillets were soft and slightly crisp from the outside. It was a simple dish yet very delicious.

‚Ä¢ Roxette Burger : The burger consists of Grilled Chicken Patty seasoned with Cajun Sauce and Cheese and is served with French Fries and tomato ketchup. The bread being on the harder side though, the burger was cheesy, juicy, spicy and sweet. The patty being crispy made it absolutely delectable.

‚Ä¢ Hell boy Burger : This burger consists of Chicken patty with Hell sauce seasoned with Cajun spice and is topped with Onion Rings. This is a signature dish of this restaurant. A must try delicacy to be honest, this burger specially was a classic delight and had a tangy as well as a cheesy flavour to the same. The onion rings tasted equally good with the tomato ketchup and left me craving for more. Loved it absolutely!

‚Ä¢ Cola Mojito : This is the cola version of the Classic Mojito. Nothing special to be honest, but yes the taste was something to cherish for.

They click a picture in every visit you make to this place and hand over the printed image of the same when you're done with the eating. Along with that, they have a unique concept of postcards where they provide you with blank postcards where you can write anything for your loved ones and hand over it to them which they'll deliver it for you. Such unique concept of reviving the old means of communication and entertaining the customers with it acts as an added advantage of this place. While you wait for the mouth watering food to get ready, you can do something really great by writing the post card.

The price being totally pocket friendly, the service being quick, the hospitality being fantastic, Hondo's has become my personal favourite. When it comes to taste and flavours, the joint will definitely not disappoint you.

Burger cravings? Do drop in anytime of the day you want.

I visited Honda's today afternoon and I absolutely loved my experience there. Its not just the memories of delicious food that you will keep with you but its the lovely hospitality thats remains engraved in your heart.
The restaurant has a 8-10 seater arrangement with a beautiful decor and quirky drawings on the walls. Though we had to wait for 20-25mins for a place, it was worth the wait.
We had ordered Pig in the pocket as starter and masala cola and sweet lime soda. The dish was very appetising. Now coming to the main course we ordered two tenderloin steak-one with brown sauce and another with pepper mushroom sauce. Both were cooked medium rare and served with mash and boiled vegetables and poached egg. This is the best steak I had in Kolkata. Both of them were cooked perfectly and the sauce had great flavours.
Further, I had informed them that its my friends birthday just as I entered. They had arranged for a molten lava cake and written happy birthday with chocolate sauce.They even played birthday songs and clicked photos for us. It was a overwhelming experience.They even gave us a printed version of our photo which I felt was really a sweet gesture.
Moreover, I also packed cheesy potato jacket with mushroom and corn for my parents and they absolutely loved the innovative dish.
In short, Honda's is a small restaurant with a really big heart ‚ù§
I will definitely revisit again!!
P.S. - They are promoting the habbit of hand written letters that are dying nowadays and gave us a postcard each and we got a chance to sent these post card to our friends living outside Kolkata.

I went to this place on a Wednesday afternoon for a lunch. I was with my 3 other friends, we literally had to wait for 1 hour.
The place ***
The place is really small. Only 3 tables. So sometimes they make people share their table.

Now comes to the food. ***
It took them like 30mins to serve us. It was the Christmas week so they had a special menu for that. We ordered two plates pork ribs , 2 plate hog chicks and 4 mojitos.
_HOG CHICKS= 3/5 only the sauce added some flavour. The bacons were a bit over fried.
_PORK RIBS= 3/5 the plate consisted of two pork ribs , an omelette, some veggies and some smashed potato. From my pork experience I can tell you it wasn't the best ribs I've tried they gave us the lard part.
_Mojito= 5/5

***
I'm never visiting this place again. And if you're really hungry do not relly on this place.

Small, a very small joint which can accommodate around 10 to 12 people but when you go inside you feel none the less than your own house... It was my first visit and who knew they can be this friendly... They'll click pictures, give you post cards, you can play their ukulele and so many fun things to do... And to add on to all these are their food... It was a dream to taste all the food that I had been watching in TLC and Fox Life until I found this food joint which serves you those humongous burgers and juicy steaks... 
We ordered beef steak, the kumro potash and the Thor burger....
The beef steak was juicy af and served with mashed potatoes and boiled veggies... It was served medium rare and had all the spices reaching upto the core of the meat loaf...
The kumro potash might be a funny name but is actually a burger with chicken patty and fried bacons, served with mayo and fresh veggies...
The Thor burger is the ultimate burger stacked with beef Patty, fried bacons, cheese, mayo, veggies and what not...
If you try the burgers then get ready to get your hands dirty....
The price is a bit above the line but the dishes are worth the price... 
Looking forward to visit again and again and again till I try most of their dishes...
P.S... For the next visit I'll be trying out their food challenge... Me vs The hulk (Many of their dishes has the name of marvel characters which is another good thing I like about them üòÅüòÅ)

I had ordered pork chops after hearing a lot of good reviews about this place but am highly disappointed by the food I received. The pork chops barely had any meat on (10% meat and 90% fat) and were more like fatty ribs. The sauted vegetables were stale with the putrefied potatoes giving off a stench that'll make anyone leave the room. The brown sauce was lumpy and the spices raw. The only saving grace was the poached egg which couldn't have gone wrong anyway. Overall a complete let down.

I am in love with this place. This place will definitely make you feel home. The staffs are too cordial and the food is unparalleled. My personal favorite would be the tenderloin steak which is cooked to perfection. The pork chops, smoked bacon and burgers are A+. The only drawback would be the time they take to serve but if you want to surprise your culinary expectations with some top quality food, you have to be patient.

Saying 24/7 delivery has a catch to it because the delivery happens according to the restaurants moods and there is a packing charge for delivery which is not there in any other restaurant and is basically a delivery fee ! The chicken pongs and the jacket potato have the same marinade chicken inside and they charge 20 rs more for a little more dip in case it finishes ! Good place to snack at night when no other options though !

Stumbled across this place where we were strolling around Prince Anwar Shah road. The graphic work is pretty cool inside and guess what !? This place is actually open 24X7 ! Grabbed the menu next and was awestruck with the diversity. They sure know how to keep you delighted! We went ahead and ordered some custard, pudding. Then we went ahead with some burgers . The hell boy burger was packed with quite a pound of meat with a pretty decent disposition. We ordered some chilly beef next, the dish known to be Sher Khan. Overall the food was excellent. Tho we hoped that the chilly beef were a bit more on the drier side. The place is a bit cramped. Extension could be a future modification.  The staff were quite courteous. They would probably click a snap of your group and give it back to you as a memento. Really liked it here. Hope to be back here soon!

This was the second restaurant on our list for the food marathon. Situated on prince anwar shah road. With funky and creative wall art and amazing Christmas decorations! This small cozy place looks like the perfect hang out for college gangs after college. With multiple choices for burgers and pork items.
We ordered for the famous Thor Burger: the burger was huge. Filled with 2 patties. The onion rings were crispy. The great thing about the burger is, it is HUGE filled with cheese! I would have liked crispier bacon!
The only reason for a lower rating is service. They took 15 mins for taking the order and another 40 mins to serve us with the burger. We felt there was a bit of partiality between the way they treated the customers. While everyone was given post cards to fill. We received none.

This was the first time I was happy after coming out from a restaurant. Yes I've been satisfied, surprised and disappointed after coming out from a restaurant before, but this was the first time I was happy.Their music taste is a whole lot better than Spotify's 'top hits'. A great ambience, an ever greater staff with tons of hospitality with perfectly cooked sumptuous food and a little aesthetic background ! What more does anyone want ? Go out there as much as you want and gift yourself this happiness !
Definitely give it a shot, if you haven't already. 
I really think Zomato should develop a '6-star' rating system, because a 5-star rating is not enough for this one !

So, I had heard of this place since a long time. Finally been there today. 
The place is cozy, probably would have been better if the space was bigger.

Now coming down to food,
We ordered the most recommended Beef Tenderloin Steak and Thor Burger. Both were equally mouth watering.

About the hospitality,
They offered us to write postcards to our loved ones. That was such an amazing way to keep the authentic way of keeping the communication with our loved ones, I truly believe, in this era of social media communication life. 
And to our great surprise, they clicked a picture of us and handed us offer a printed photograph too. Such an amazing gesture indeed.
Thank you team. 
I'll definitely be back again. üíû

After a lot of recommendations, last week I finally visited Hondo's with a friend.

I liked the pretty decor there. There is a friendly atmosphere, which is now a days missing from restuarants. We laughed, and talked with the manager and staff. They even came up with suggestions. The letter writing concept rendered a tinge of nostalgia.

Coming to food,
I ordered three dishes.

1. Smoked bacon fried: Being a huge bacon lover, I could not miss this item. The salt was just perfect for me. Few people might find it a bit salty. Must try.

2. Hogged chick(6pieces): Tasted good. The bacon was seasoned properly. Though the chicken was a bit dull in taste.

3. Pork ribs: Liked it. The quantity was huge.

I definitely going back to have smoked bacon fried and a couple of more new dishes.

Unfortunately, I haven't been to the place yet, so I cannot comment on how good the staff and ambience is, but judging from what others had to say, it's pretty good. What I can talk about is the food as I had a Pork Wolverine burger delivered to my house in Jadavpur. Delivery was on time. The burger was wrapped in an aluminium foil and there were some potato fries and a pouch of ketchup as well. Being a burger enthusiast, I was really excited to taste this one after all the accolades it received from many in this city. I have to say I had great expectations from it and maybe that is why it didnt quite live upto it. The burger was stuffed with meat, no complaints, good amount of mayo and cheese, but it lacked flavour. It was juicy, but not juicy enough. If you are hungry and you have one of these, it will satisfy your hunger, but the lack of flavour sometimes made it hard for me to plough through it. The bun, however was soft, grilled and I liked it. The potato fries were just not good enough. I would say that the burger was better than most others in the city, but it definitely isn't the best. Also, the price wasn't too high, but it wasn't cheap either. 340 rupees can get you better burgers in the city and if you are willing to pay a little more, you can probably enjoy the best burger in this city according to me, the Southern Smokehouse or the Ultimate Bacon by Chilis. Hondo's is worth another try for sure though. Cheers!

A tiny place with a big heart. While the food didn't exactly float my boat, the service and attitude went a long way. Also, I wasn't aware that they are open 24 hours! That's no mean achievement at all. As for the food, the cheese pongs were lovely. Having read raves about the burgers, we stuck to that section of the menu. The double patty veggie burger was better than most but was strangely not even warm, considering it was freshly made. My companion had the Wolverine which looked massive but he was able to finish it easily because it was good.
PS: Must mention that I approve of the music they play 100%. The hour that I was there, they played Pink Floyd classics.

Came to know about this place through zomato. I'm a hardcore pork lover and thus the menu and the reviews tempted me and I visited Hondo's with my husband on 16th December. Coming straight to the orders and at the end I will let you know why my rating is 2.5.
1. Beef momo - Rs120/plate (6momos)
The beef stock was tasty but the momo needs to be more juicy to make it outstanding. It was mediocre.

2. Pig in the blanket - Rs200/plate
It is Hungarian sausages embedded in mashed potatoes and baked with cheese. It tasted awesome. But the quantity was very less. It can be increased little bit more.

3. Jacket potato - choice of meat Ox tongue - Rs160/plate
This dish was overall nice. Guys who doesn't like any kind of meat odour should avoid this as it has a slight smell of the meat. Overall this was good.

4. Beef tenderloin steak - spicy Jalapeno - Rs430/plate
This was the best steak I had till date. The meat was soft and tasty. The marination was perfectly done,the taste of the herbs and Jalapeno sauce was full in the meat.

5. Pork ribs - Rs310/plate
I was shocked. This was the worst pork ribs dish I ever had. The base of the meat was totally burnt which made the entire meat overcooked and hard and tasteless. I was really disappointed with this dish. It was impossible to eat after sometime so I had to gulp down with the help of water. It was that bad.

My rating is based on this in particular and also the ambience is not at all up to the mark. Also they took long time to serve the 'Pig in the blanket' order. Service needs to be prompt with tasty dish, not prompt with horrible dish,like pork ribs which was served soon but it was horrible. Very very mediocre restaurant. The place is too small.
Considering my first time experience of Hondo's,I can't recommend it to anyone as there are places which serve much better food and are also good in terms of ambience.
The pictures are attached as per the order in which dishes are mentioned above. The last picture is of ours. That was something special they did to everyone who visited. They took a photo of us and also gave us a copy.

So finally I got to taste what this place has to offer, and OMG! I loved their burger to bits. The Original Hamburger, which I had with an add on of cheese and egg, made me fall in love with it at the first bite. 
The pancakes however, could have been fluffier. But then, they use real maple syrup and not honey as a drizzle over them, which is a rarity!
Will surely give the other burgers on the menu a try very soon.

Introducing Kolkata's 24*7 Continental Cafe Hondo's

Am or Pm no matter what is the time,
"HUNGRY KYA? HONDO'S JAA"

It was on my list from a long time, so on a rainy frustrated Saturday evening, I went to the place with my friend & lots of expectations.

A small cafe on Prince Anwar Shah Road near to Dhaka Kali Bari Bus Stop (walkable distance from South City Mall or Nabina Cinema Hall).

Luckily we got a seat as soon as we entered because they have a very small place with three tables. They also do home delivery nearby, areas like Dhakuria, Jadavpur, Santoshpur, Golf green.

Sandwich, Starters, Meat Platter, Burgers, Shephards Pie, Steak, Dessert, full of a meaty affair and delicious continental options on the menu card.

I thought to give a surprise try to a starter "Chicken Pongs with Corriender Mayo", chicken balls melted in our mouth. Cheesy & Chicken Paste Ball with tangy coriander mayo gave a perfect mouth-watering start.

I asked them about their iconic options, and they suggested me to have "Chicken & Pork Double Decker Thor Burger" or "Kumropotas Burger" with some potato wedges.
I ordered the Thor Burger, which was Huge in size as well as the amount of Double Deck thick patty (one chicken and one pork, Full of slices of bacon, Cheesy Onions, lots of Cheese Slices.
You can't have that alone, neither you want to share with anyone. So fantastic to taste. BEST BURGER IN KOLKATA, yes not one of them, "THE BEST".

As the winter came, and rain was drizzling outside, my friend's meat carving ordered the Hondo's Speciality "Beef Honey Glazed Tenderloin Steak", a big, soft, tender, juicy portion of beef steak accompanying boiled beans, carrot, sweet corn and potato wedges. The honey flavoured steak was yummy, the sauce enriched the portion, our taste buds had literally foodgasm.

Then they clicked a photo of us and surprised us with the printed copy. Wow, such a nice gesture to start the long-term friendship.

They gave us two postcards to send it to our beloved friend or family. They took an initiative to start the habits of letter writing. I wrote and put inside of the Hondo's postbox. And came out with happy memories.

Thank you Hondo's, I will definitely come back very soon to try the Kumropotas Burger. I fell in love, with the burger of this place.

The price range was moderate but worthy of the experience.

P.N: Place is little slow to serve the food, due to a small and non-fire kitchen but they deliver a quality of foods.

Absolutely stunning experience. It was there for a long time in my bucket list. Went there in the december rain. Amongst their various interesting menu, we ordered ox tongue sandwich, orange based pork ribs and beef tenderloin steak pepper mushroom. Each of them were mouth watering. The beef steak was so smooth and tender. Display of the food were nice. I am eager to visit their soon. The restaurant is small and cozy with lovely wall arts here and there. They give u opportunity to write a letter on postcard and they even have a post box and they actually post these letters for their respective destinations. They click ur photo and give you the hard copy of that sweet moment. All the people out there are so friendly and polite. Only one issue is that the place is a small for large group.

Went there in the evening. My friend and I were the only people there. They play contemporary hits, so that's pretty nice.

Tried out their burger Roxette and Chicken Salami Sandwich. The fries aren't that great. Less in number and not crunchy enough. Both the burger and the sandwich were quite dry.

Decor is amazing. Staff is courteous and polite. Service is fast. Could improve on the hygiene part. We had an insect on the table.

Tried Pork Ribs, Steak and Burgers. The best items were the burgers, specially Hellboy and Hunny bunny.
Also it's one of the few restaurants that really care about their customers; service was perfect.

Special mention: Their song collection is as good as their service ;-)

Final Say:
Food: 4.0(The ribs can be improved)
Service: 5.0(The best in the business)

Will be back there for more.

Probably the best economical burgers and steaks in town, and the bonus point? Well, all of these at 4 o'clock in the morning.

They pay a lot of attention to customer satisfaction. To the extent of clicking and printing a photo of me and my friend to take home! 
We even got to post a letter to our friend in Pune thanks to their new idea of giving out postcards and posting the letters for the customers. 
Their beef steak is brilliant and pork ribs are good although slightly too fatty for me. Mains are a little costy compared to other stuff on the menu, but worth the experience.
Try the Jacket Potato with meat of any choice.. a very simple, satisfying yet innovative dish. 
Pigs in the blanket is another tasty combination of cheese potato and sausage.
Definitely a worthy visit for meat lovers .

Visited this small joint one fine evening after college. I'd heard quite a bit about it, so I decided to check the place out. Accompanied by¬† a friend, I ordered Chicken Pongs with Coriander Mayo, chicken momos and pork ribs. The chicken pongs were bland. The pork ribs were chewy and undercooked. Naturally, we were instantly disheartened. The momos were satisfactory. The ambiance is soothing and the staff is courteous

Best Place in town. To gorge on to some delicious burgers and steaks. I've been hearing about this place for so long. I walked passed it and never even bothered to look at it. It was recommended by Ankita di to give this place a visit. It's a small 12 seater joint with exceptionally well behaved waiters. The owners Arindam da and Upal da are very generous. 
I ordered Wolverine Burger Pork delicious. While writing this review I'm feeling like going back and have a Burger. Quite unique names. The Honey Glazed Steak was not upto the mark because it was very much tangy. Though the beef was delicious and tender. Virgin Mojito and a new thing called Cola Mojito along with the food is absolute gem. I'm looking for the dessert next time and The Burger named "THOR" 

Happy Eating!

I was curious to visit this culinary destination for a long time. Just happened to pamper my taste buds here after along aimless voyage. It was a busy affair at Hondo's that day with preparations for display of new menu and the gentleman at the far end corner of the restaurant, passionately coordinating everything. 

Once, you step inside, the meticulously done amazing decor and the carefree ambience will take you to a multi culinary land!

Those cocktail sausages were so so so very delicious and mouthwatering. 

I would just request the owners to make the seating arrangement in full operation only when it is spacious enough. Otherwise, the tiny space with the kitchen close and people sitting very close to each other might lead to an unfortunate incident.

We visited the outlet about a month ago. The ambiance was quite ordinary and they took almost 45 minutes to serve us a Chicken Hawaiian salad and a Hell Boy's burger with beef patty. Now if you're like me, having food on the go and hate waiting for it to arrive then this is bound to be your worst experience ever, especially given that we visited during a non-rush hour. Anyway the burger overshadowed everything from the poor decorations to the late arrival of our food. IT WAS THE BEST BURGER EVER, QUITE LITERALLY, not even exaggerating. The kind of burger that you can wait another 45 minutes for, even when in a hurry (they even served french fries along with it, crispy fries are a personal favorite of mine going with a good burger :p). Now for some weird reasons, they served the salad after the burger, even though we meant it as a starter. The salad is what I@ can describe at best as an average, especially coming after the burger. Overall was a decent experience, and would definitely visit again!

Although a relatively small place, it's beautifully decorated and serves delicious food. We tried the chicken pongs, hellboy burger, pork chops and roasted chicken. Chicken pongs was good with some delicious dip. Hellboy burger was huge and very satisfying. I loved the pork chops. Roasted chicken was okayish.
Definitely a must try.

This small restaurant is located on Prince Anwar Shah Road near the stop Dhaka Kali Bari. The inside has 2-3 tables and has an overall cozy environment. But it is a bit too small, and not enough to fit a large group of people.

But what really caught my attention is the food served in this place. The price to quantity ratio is really good and the quality of the foods are so good that it has become one of my go to places to eat in south Kolkata.

During my numerous visits I've tried various dishes here and my favorites are definitely The Oriental Rice Chicken and Roasted Chicken.

The Oriental Rice Chicken is abundant in quantity, enough for a heavy meal for one person. The perfectly cooked rice with a hint of sweetness and the chicken pieces were an absolute delight for a Saturday lunch. I really liked how it tasted and would love to have it again.

The Roasted Chicken was served with brown sauce and vegetables, sweet corn, mashed potato and a poached egg. The quantity again with this one was enough for one meal and I cannot stress on how good it tasted. I would say the Roasted Chicken is a must try from this place.

During one of our visits my friend ordered a Cottage Love which he seemed to enjoy so if you're craving any kind of burgers then this is a good option.

For desserts, my favorite is the Molten Fantasy which is basically a choco lava cake and there's nothing not to like about a choco lava cake.

During an evening visit I also a Cappuccino, and this is really nothing special. It tastes like one would expect and nothing too fancy about it either. But given it's the same thing you can make with little effort in your home the price is not really good and I'd say save your desire for caffeine for some other place. This is the only (very minor) gripe I have about this place.

And to top it all off, during our visits we were offered and given a post card in case we wanted to write a letter to someone as the art of letter writing is getting lost with time. And while the food was being prepared we were offered an Ukulele to play in case we got bored sitting idle for that time and I think both of these two things are a really good initiative from the staffs there.

The staffs themselves are really good and makes sure you are comfortable and having a good time, so no complaints there.
This is a place that I will definitely recommend to everyone.

The burgers are to die for.
The Piggy Chow, a South African dish they have remade the Hondo's way, is a fantastic twist to pork preparations.
The Pasta dish was perfectly prepped and do ample in quantity that two people struggle to finish it.
Coming to the best dish of the afternoon, The Wolverine. Besides the catchy name, this giant burger, overstuffed with all the favorite meat, is just the perfect ending to a filling brunch. The meat was cooked to perfection, portions were huge and it just leaves you craving for more!
It's the best money spent on overtly pleasing dishes.
All over extremely satisfied!
They've this very nice idea of clicking pictures of customers. And have recently introduced postcards.

Reasonably priced, available with both pork and beef offerings that too 24*7 and they took the pain to deliver to my place which is not typically within their delivery area. Last but not the least, food was damn good! 

I visited Hondo's a month back with my friends and we cherished whatever we had there including the beef momo, Pork Chow and a few more items. I liked the food that day but decided to opt for one more try before writing the review. 

Yesterday, we were craving for both beef and pork and I called them to check in case they were ready to deliver in my place and they did it. Our order was for 2 Hamburger with added cheese (beef), one portion of Pepper Mushroom Tenderloin Beef Steak, one portion of Pork ribs and one large Egg and Cheese Sandwich. The Ribs were the best of the lot, Balanced flavor and soft chunks of meat. The Sandwich was just perfect and loaded with more than enough egg and cheese stuffing. The steak was decent and the burger was perfect with a big fat beef patty within. 

individually, each item was sufficient as a single person's meal. 

Considering the price, Delivery options, timing, and the quality of the food, Hondo's is doing great.

Definitely proven to be one of my current favourites, this place is a delight to visit. One can only hope such a small place can be so joyous, until they visit this place. This is a small place, very small but the environment is so friendly that it's hardly an issue. Apt service from the staff comes with their friendliness, you can even writes letters to your loved ones from here and play their ukulele while you wait for your dishes. The food are delicious, great in quantity and at a relatively good price.

1.Burgers - Had their Cottage Love and Thor Burgers and they were amazing ! These are huge Burgers with soft buns and a load full of stuffings within. They look stunning and taste even better ! Definitely a recommendation to everyone !
2. Main Courses - Love everything from this section, especially the Roasted Chicken which is an absolute stunner ! No compromises on quantity, quality or taste, which make 'em worth every bite.
3. Love for Rice - Had the Oriental Rice Chicken and I can assure you this is one of the best rice dishes I've had recently, They're well-cooked, served hot, in great quantity and taste amazing ! Keep in mind that since they're made afresh , they do take time to arrive.
4. Deserts - In love with this section, especially the Molten Fantasy and Custard Chicochips, the latter being my personal favourite. The Molten Fantasy is served so hot, the chocolate literally melts out once you put your spoon through it and the Custard is so smooth that it doesn't take much effort to cut through it in the first place.

This is a small joint located on prince anwar shaw road, near dhaka kali bari crossing. The interior is a little disorganised and unfortunately we spotted two houseflies hovering over our food. The waiter was however polite. Coming to the food we ordered thor burger, devilled crabs, jacket potato with shredded chicken, mango masti, fresh lime soda and molten fantasy. Having heard a lot about their burgers, we were frankly disappointed with the thor burger. Though the quantity was huge, the taste was too salty and the flavours were not well balanced. Devilled crab was good. Jacket potato was also good and huge in quantity. The mango shake was good but the best was molten fantasy or molten lava cake. I felt the food was overpriced given the ambience and taste.

Visited this cafe on recommendation from my brother who was all-praise about this food joint I had never heard of before. It's a literally tiny cafe on Prince Anwar Shah road with only 3 tables for now (although they are promising to expand soon), but it is really interesting. The ambience is good with nice music playing on the background. They gave us postcards in an attempt to revive the age-old practice of letter writing, and encouraged us to write out to anyone we like to, and promised to get them posted on our behalf. They also took photos of us and gave us a printed copy immediately. Interesting eh?
Now coming to the food. They cook really good continental food that will surely make your mouth water. They offer multiple meat options, and the pork is very soft. We tried pork cocktail sausages, hondos chicken salad, MCB burger with pork Patty and mushroom and cheese sandwich. Each of them were worth trying, but the hondos chicken salad and MCB burger won my heart. In the drinks we took cola mojito and Aam Panna. Cola mojito is the regular virgin mojito made with cola but it tastes different. But the most shocking fact is, in spite of devouring such a heavy meal, our bill fell short of 1000 bucks!! 
So if you are in search of good continental cuisine but need to take care of your expenses, hondos is the perfect place for you.

This is the PERFECT place for those who love 'meating' instead of 'meeting'. It only seats around 13 persons but the hospitality and the food is just AWESOME!! If you are looking for a good steak, do not go to Steak Factory, try Hondos! The chef is blessed and makes the perfect steak, do try that in case you are into beef, they also make crazy burgers, do try the Original Hamburger with cheese, its fantastic!!  
The music is also great, the best part about this restaurant is that it is open 24 hrs!!!!! Go enjoy it, thank me later!!

27th nov 2017 had horrible experience. Ordered chili DRY pork , which took more than 30 min to prepare 04:00am( not rush hour). 
After reaching home found the meat was undercooked and curry pot with vegetables were delivered. Called up Hondos and inform them that we have ordered for Chili DRY pork and not a gravy pork dish. The person politely informed that they will replace and send us another serving but it will take another 1 hr. Hopeing to get some quality food i agreed to exchange with the new food to be delivered. What was delivered was not only upseting but also irritating as we were longing to have it as finge@r food along with the beverages. 
When asked to the shop guy he informed that this is how they prepare . 
I am attaching the pic of chili dry pork which was sent to us, the second time even after explaing what we were asking for.

The little space with just four tables, this little joint is sweeping the city and Hondo's has made a name for itself. Satisfying the midnight craving of the citizens Hondo's is slowly climbing up the Culinary Ladder. Frankly the Food is just above Average with a lot of scope to improve. The menu can be more constructive. The burgers are really good, the sandwiches are very good. The BLT sandwich was specificcally made for me off the menu and it turned out to be great. Serving Beef & Pork at anytime during the night is really something Hondo's is doing right. The manager was extremely humble and the stories as well as the problems which they face while midnight were really fascinating. Keep up the good work.

Visited this cafe on recommendation from my brother who was all-praise about this food joint I had never heard of before. It's a literally tiny cafe on Prince Anwar Shah road with only 3 tables for now (although they are promising to expand soon), but it is really interesting. The ambience is good with nice music playing on the background. They gave us postcards in an attempt to revive the age-old practice of letter writing, and encouraged us to write out to anyone we like to, and promised to get them posted on our behalf. They also took photos of us and gave us a printed copy immediately. Interesting eh?
Now coming to the food. They cook really good continental food that will surely make your mouth water. They offer multiple meat options, and the pork is very soft. We tried pork cocktail sausages, hondos chicken salad, MCB burger with pork Patty and mushroom and cheese sandwich. Each of them were worth trying, but the hondos chicken salad and MCB burger won my heart. In the drinks we took cola mojito and Aam Panna. Cola mojito is the regular virgin mojito made with cola but it tastes different. But the most shocking fact is, in spite of devouring such a heavy meal, our bill fell short of 1000 bucks!! 
So if you are in search of good continental cuisine but need to take care of your expenses, hondos is the perfect place for you.

Food was great ... loved the flavours of the burgers and paella! 
Make sure you are really hungry when you order as the quantity is BIG! Advantage ... one of the few places open 24*7.
As every dish is freshly cooked and not taken from the freezer the dish to arrive will take some time to be served. 
Great place for the college goers & young professionals! 
Only Disadvantage was that the place needs to be better decorated and more tables ... currently a very small place.
I recommend this place for a nice hearty, fresh and a tasty meal!

I ordered from Hondo's for home delivery quite a number of times, but never checked in there. Finally I did in the Diwali evening and tried some super awesome mouth watering continental experience. We ordered Cola Mojito, Jacket Potato, Honey glazed tenderloin steak and crispy bacon. The fact that it was just a cozy little food joint, it delivered the food which was out of the universe. Prompt service, courteous staffs and cozy ambience. They also clicked our photo and printed it to us as a gift. Thank you for delivering happiness Hondo's

Did not have anything worse in near past. We ordered pork thukpa , pork wolverine burger and pork ribs on day before Diwali. What arrived is definitely not it or the chef doesnt know what thukpa or pork rib are. The thukpa was full of soya sauce and capsicum. I have had thukpa in many good places including Mcleodgunj and Darjeeling. Never seen anyone using soya sauce or capsicum !! Even momo plaza makes better tasting thukpa. And in what word was the chunk of meat swimming in some kind of syrup pork ribs.... I really dont know. We couldn't eat even half of that utter rubbish

The food is great and I usually visit the place like once or twice in the week. But Mr. Sushil Nandi, who is the manager at this place is really an unsuitable person to have as a manager.
¬†
I was with one of my female friends and I simply asked for a charger as I had to book a cab, Mr. Nandi simply denied the charger. The whole conversation took place around 2:30 am and my friend was not feeling safe to go outside and wait for a yellow taxi.

I hope Hondos could have people who are more sympathetic to their customers and have some common sense.¬†

Lots of Love to Hondos.

After hearing much about this place we went to this small joint which is at Dhaka Kalibari,Prince Anwar Shah Road.Very easy to locate & we reached out on a sunday night. It can accommodate at most 15 people. As we heard a very  unattractive decor with an air conditioner!The choice of music is great. My rating is impacted by their slow service & almost cold steak!

We ordered one jacket potato with corn & cheese. It was mashed potato with corn & garnished with cheese. Tasted okayish, nothing to recommend! This preparation took 40 mins to reach us after much insistence & it was quite disappointing. Any other place would serve this kinda dish in 10 mins!
Then we had pork ribs, with an add on of garlic bread! The taste was great but when it reached to us it was not hot & by the time we finished 1/2 of it, it was cold as dead. That ruined the taste of the dish!
The same is with beef tenderloin steak. if you serve dishes like steak not steaming hot then it loses half of its taste!Both the steaks were heavy in quantity served with veggies,mashed potatoes & sunny side up. The garlic bread was not crispy enough & no smell of garlic at all. The cola mojito was experimental but had very little appeal to me!

The staffs & owner are very courteous. At the end of the meal they handed us a photo taken there & asked about the meal. We said the - ves & they apologized. I also pointed out that the steak knives are not enough heavy to cut & they said these were the standard knives but I beg to differ & I would request them to visit steak factory or chili's to take a look at what a standard steak knife is!
Overall I would be tempted to visit this place only if I hear they're serving quick & hot food! We almost had to wait an hour before we got a bite @our steaks!That much of waiting is not worthy!I think the home delivery option will be good instead of dining out!

Most eateries love to serve shitty, uncooked food, even to their regular customers, during Durga pujas. But Hondo's came to me as a pleasant surprise and that's why I have completely fallen in love with this place and their food.

I had heard a lot about this one so we decided to give place a try. Serving customers during the Durga pujas in Kolkata is a tough job and couple of us friends decided to dine here at 3 am and that too on a Saptami night. Upon arriving, we were informed that they are currently restocking and are closed for an hour. We were dissapointed for a bit but since we didn't want to try any more places we decided to wait. After some time, we were informed that they can serve us just the burgers off their menu. That seemed like a good option for us hungry lot so we ordered a hellboy, a classic burger and the sunbun burger. I don't know about the rest of us but I definitely expected them to disspoint us. What came to us after half an hour completely blew my mind. The burgers looked AMAZING! And not just that, the patties had been just made and were totally packed with flavour, the buns were fresh, the fries were freshly fired. In a word , the plate looked and tatsted just PERFECT. We also tried their beef steak in mushroom sauce and another one with a honey glaze. Needless to say they were perfect as well.

So there is no doubt that I would highly recommend this place to everyone . And I can completely gurantee that none of you would be dissapointed to spend you hard earned money on the gorgeous plate of food these people serve. 10 stars from my side.

So we ordered pork ribs, a large shredded chicken sandwich and a Thor Burger. The sandwich was good but the pork ribs required a lot of effort to cut it in pieces; it was not tender at all. The winner is obviously the Thor burger. It was a fulfilling dish.
The waiting time is something that they should work on. It took 45 minutes for them to serve us just the pork ribs.
The ambience is cozy. It would be nice if they can add a few chairs and tables although I am not sure whether that is possible or not.
Also they clicked a picture of us and printed and gave it to us then and there. I thought it was a really sweet gesture.
Overall, the experience was good!

Though they pleased on our fiest visit our next visit wasn't up to the mark. A very small outlet and clumsy indeed. In terms of food Bacon pasta is delicious with perfect smoky flavour to relish. Crispy bacon and pork sausages are delicious too. The chilly pork - Bagheera turned out to be disastrous. The taste was ordinary and the pieces were chewy if not hard.

Do try their chicken balls with coriander dip.
Burgers are something there are known for.

Here is a tip:¬†try going to Hondo's around early noon instead of the late evening! Chances of getting a favorable parking spot are bright, and the wait time could be less.¬† I would recommend¬†to Uber it down instead of spending the time to park. Last time we landed up around¬†9 PM, waited about 30 mins and left for another restaurant.

Ambience :

Well, prima facie, the place looks a bit cluttered and compact, with about 5 tables stuffed in a¬† small garage-like space. But as every steak lover worth his sauce will tell you, if the food is good, the comfort becomes secondary. However, I must add, washroom will be a challenge, so plan well, especially the ladies, since the nearest loo is a Sulabh Shauchalay bang opposite the road.

Menu : 

We ordered Chicken Sandwich, Devil's Crab, Chicken Shepherd's Pie, Honey Glazed Tenderloin Steak, and some potato wedges.

What works : 

The quality of ingredients is quite good and the portions are generous. The quality of the meat was very good, not chewy at all, and medium rare was pink inside,¬†quite impressive indeed. The honey glazed sauce on top had just enough sweet and salt balance to not lose the taste of the meat.The Devils crab was baked well, the plating was good and salt was nicely balanced with the crab meat. The Chicken Sandwich was good, nothing extraordinary but good. The Chicken Shepherd's pie was at par with some of the other places in town, good presentation and baked well. The best part of the place was the fragrance of good food. A food lover's definitive, unscientific, guide to assessing a restaurant!

What could've have been better :

The Shepherd's Pie, (Chicken) needs to balance the tomato puree some more, otherwise, it runs the risk of getting too sour too soon. Rosemary and Thyme need to make their presence felt as well.¬†¬†
The steak needs to have some mashed potato served with it, perhaps a barbecue sauce would also be a great option to have. The portion of the veges was¬†inconsistent, and the potato wedges were a bit overdone.¬†
These are not like a show-stopper in my view, particularly because of the quality of meat and the near perfect medium rare preparation, which was much appreciated. The Devil's Crab had a remnant¬†sea-smell in the shell, perhaps need to be boiled a bit more. And the French fries need to be a little less deep fried.

Anecdotes :¬†

The service quality was excellent. Mr.Raja , who was double-hatting as a cashier and chef, was well aware of the menu, and it's by his recommendation we narrowed in¬†on our choices. Must say we appreciated it a lot. As most cuisines around the world, if you miss the timing then the entire dish can go awry, but he managed to do both quite well.¬†

The restaurant is open 24/7 and I would certainly visit post-midnight someday to check the consistency, but I am surprised that in such a cosmopolitan city like Kolkata, there are so few late night eateries. There are scores of people working late nights and there is nothing more dampening than wrapping up your order by 11 PM. So Hondo's¬† is a sight for sore eyes.

The price point is just right and will appeal to a lot of people as a total value for money option. The economics of it really balances off the lack of a sophisticated¬†ambiance in some sense and more than makes up for it in the taste department.

Overall: It was a good experience, with some tweaks, this restaurant has a potential to become better and I would recommend it to try if you are deep into good European or Continental cuisine. I would like to see a "secret" sauce in the menu which becomes adorns the signature dish for the place in the future.

We reached the at 2:30 am  on the day of vijayadashami, as they are the saviors for midnight munchies. What we ate and the review - 
1. Cheese burger - amazing patty, crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside! Loved it to the core.
1. Tenderloin steak - one of the two best steaks I've had in Calcutta in the past 10 years, and my hunt includes all the steak houses one can possibly imagine (leaving the 5 star hotels aside). Amazingly soft and tender and the sauce was perfect with hints of rosemary. I can compare this steak to the ones I've had in Scotland.
Thank you Hondo's for the amazing pic and print :)

We ordered chicken pongs, hell boy burger,chicken penne pasta in white sauce ans another amazing chicken dish I don't recall the name of.
Starting with the first dish,chicken pongs is the best of this place . If has freshly cooked chicken with coriander mayonnaise dip. If you don't order it when you are here you are missing on a great talent.
Then the Hell Boy burger,it is really as funky and promising as the name sounds.
The pasta is also great , combination of the perfect amount of cheese and chicken.
The last dish I would like to mention is the chicken dish , ot has chicken chicken sausages cooked in cheese with mashed potatoes. It wasso good I can survive on it for life.
The pocket pinch is decent enough . All of this was just for 1200 bucks.
My 5 stars to this place has another story. We got a picture clicked by the restaurant personnel and he was sweet enough to give us a copy of it.
I would visit this place again . Places like this needs to be like the must visits of the town

Pocket friendly ..and what i loved was at the end of our meal they took a picture of us and gave us the printed pic..and that was really special..highly recommended.

I have heard a lot about the delicious food that Hondo's offer and hence finally decided to pay a visit to this place. Its small resturant situated near Dhaka Kali Bari on Prince Anwar Shah road. If you are looking for some mouthwatering pork, beef delicacies then Hondo's is definitely the place for you to be.
I have went to this place with a group of friends for dinner on a Sunday night. This is a small resturant and hence do not have much scope for decoration, but interior is decent and clean with seating arrangememts perfect for a small group of friends or a family dineout.
Hondo's serve continental delicacies along with American fast food. The service is decently quick and the food is palatable. We ordered Chicken Pongs with coriender mayo, pork cocktail sausages, hen in the blanket and Thor. Each and every food that we ordered were delicious and mouthwatering, but my personal favourite was the Thor. Don't go by the name, its not any marvel comic charecter but a double decker burger stuffed with loads of becons, cheese, onion rings. The burger was very juicy and the onion rings gives a crunchy feel at times. One should definitely try this at Hondo's. Apart from delicious food what make this resturant standout from the crowd is its 24*7 service. Yes, thats true Hondo's is open 24 hours 7days a week.
The last but infact the most important thing that we all look for while dinning out is the pocket pinch and Hondo's comes out with flying colours in this parameter as well. Its a very budget friendly resturant, which offer delicious food without burning a whole in your pocket.

It's a small good place with honest food. But honest food, I mean good quantity, good quality at a pocket friendly price. I've hardly seen any place serving noodle, where the quantity is almost equal to the amount of noodle, and in beef noodles, they serve flat noodles (thankfully). The beef momo was another revelation. Though not the best, but it can definitely be counted among the bests in town (I'd suggest to reduce the momo size and increase the number of momos though) and a complementary bowl of clear soup will definitely be a feel good factor. The stir fried beef chilly couldn't stand with these rockstars and I expected it to be slightly more spicy. But, overall, great place and mostly, great hospitality by the owner.¬†

I'll definitely come back again ...

Lives up to its name.

The Wolverine and Thor burgers were unbelievably good. The beef was cooked to perfection and the bacon was slightly burnt, but that's how I love it. The quantity was sufficient and the quality was top notch. The chicken pongs were one the best starters I have ever tasted. The spices were perfectly balanced in every dish that we ordered. The cola mojito is better than the masala cola in my opinion. 

The serving time was around an hour, but that's understandable given that it was Durga Puja, and that we had ordered food for 11 people. The space is a bit cramped and I'd recommend giving them a call before visiting. The place lacks a washroom, but there's one exactly on the opposite side of the road. The overall pricing is a little high, but the quality of the food makes up for it.

Overall experience was very good. Will surely visit again.

After a delightful puja shopping a sumptuous meal is mandatory. So without any delay we have picked Hondo's for that evening. Location wise it is very easily accessible from the different parts of the city. The joint is extremely small. But never judge the quality of the food by seeing the area ;). Anyways so we had baked sausages as a starter. It just melted in the mouth. The layers of beef momo was extremely thin and the stuffing inside it was very juicy. Meat lovers platter was really a treat. Had a really delicious cheese omelette after a long time. Pork chop was a little hard but the sauce was yummy. For dessert molted chocolate cake and nutella cake was just perfect after a grand meal. I have also tried their varieties of rice. All are unique. I always look for a chance to visit this place :)

We ordered for Beef Steak of all the available variants in our home. Ordering over phone and delivery were all smooth. Coming to the food, it was a HUGE piece of steak. So big, that I couldn't finish one myself. However, all of the steaks tasted almost the same - the base was the same only that, Jalapenos and Mushrooms were added to the respective variety. Also, there was too much of broth in the steaks which I have never experienced before anywhere though I have taken steaks in different parts of the world.... None of us liked the heavy broth in which the steaks were almost sunk. Maybe we can suggest to reduce the quantity of the broth. We are however, yet to try out the other foods in the menu, which we will surely do next time.

Piqued by its name, we visited this 'open till late' eatery yesterday midnight. Highly popular and jostling for space, the menu packed a punch and variety. We ordered the house speciality beef steak platter & wolverine burger, pasta in white sauce, chicken salad and some fried rice with ginger lemon fish. While the other items were really good, the pasta sauce could have been more cheesy (like the ones in Big Chill cafe) and burger was mostly fried patty based, with some bacon in it. I loved the pricing and the zeal of the owners as well as their marketing ideas. With a small place to cram in, the service was pleasant and a good experience overall. I hope they open up in Delhi as well...

This is going to be the most happening place in Kolkata very soon
The wide variety of food and their timings have already gathered the attention for many .
Though haven't visited the place, but have ordered in multiple times.
The best thing is the quantity .
The quality could still get better( maybe it's because I order in and not visit.).
There is so much on the menu you want to try.
All the best hondos

At last found this unique tiny little nook in my city which serves every meat i know... Being a hard core meatie my life simply does not circle around chicken.. And here is Hondo's serving me beef pork chicken üò±
We landed up there at midnight and had to wait for a while and the staff made sure we were updated abt our turn... Thums up.. We pre ordered 2 varieties of beef steak and boy were we happy... üòÇ the steak was juicy... Medium rare.. And had a lovely gravy over it... We cleaned our plates without leaving a single scrap on it...and i eyed everything else on the menu..
They are really friendly... They even took a photo of us and gave us a printed copy of it.. ‚ù§Ô∏èAnd now i can't wait to get my fingers on the rest of the items on the menu.. 
The place is small but then they cant help it..

This place is quite good for continental. This is located on anwarshah road. The Shepherd's pie was more of a spicy kind rather than the cheesy kind which we are all used to. They have it in pork and in chicken. The tiger prawn wrapped in bacon was also very good. There were 3pieces and it was served with a bit of gravy. The mixed fried rice which we had ordered was very good with generous amount of chicken and prawns in it. The chicken noodles wasn't that great. It was the flat noodles used in pasta. Overall the taste of the food is very good. I am going back to this place again. 

The service was all up to the mark. The staff at this place were very courteous. 

A thumbs up to this place.

Relying over last time my experience we again came to Hondo's today which leads to a great disappointment. The main thing that disappointments me is that when I saw the claw of a roasted chicken in my plate.. still I managed to overlook the fault and tried to cut the chicken to have it but what I found is blood inside the chicken leg and the flesh is not properly cooked.. inspite of having those sumptuous dishes they can't showcase the food... The penne in Alfredo was okay okay... The burgers were not up to the mark.. it's a big zero for me..Haven't tasted this bad continental dishes ever

Very pathetic experience. Roast chicken served after one and half hours. Entered this place at 10 pm and ordered one Singapore noodles, one lemon chicken and one portion roast chicken. They served the noodle dish at 10.30. The lemon chicken dish came at 11 pm and the roast chicken at 11.20 pm. 
They were busy serving one food blogger with their delicacies and one normal customer like me was made to wait for no good reasons.
Avoid this place as they do not even care for their mis management.
Taste of food was extremely bad. The noodles were half cooked and the chicken pieces of lemon chicken were a bit softer than pieces of stone.

After reading some good reviews about the place we decided to order from here on a sunday evening .. the order was placed at about 8:45 pm they didn't mention anything about delays .. time went by and when it was 10 pm we called them and to our query they replied "deri hobe" ... telling them to speed up a bit I hung up .. finally a few cuss words later the food arrived at 11:15 pm .. yeah they took two and a half hours to deliver and the distance is barely 3 kms -_-

Now coming to the food... 

Thor burger: the patty was excessively salty and a bit undercooked  .. 2/5 

Mcb burger: 2.5/5

Cottage love burger: 2.5/5 

Caesar salad: the stuff they sent can qualify as farmented assorted vegetables of some sort but not as any salad ... like it was the rotten dead-body of a caeser salad 
0/5 

Roasted chicken quarter: they forgot to add salt to this dish and gave it a bengali touch by making it 'roasted chicken er jhol' ... I mean come on it's chicken you need real talent to make chicken taste so bad -_- 
0/5 (this dish deserves negative rating actually) 

Cheese stuffed topshe: simple 'topshe machh er fry' with microscopic portion of cheese 1.5/5 

Molten fantasy: I tried molten chocolates at many places from dominos to chilis.. this was literally the raw cake dough dipped in chocolate .. this shit is the worst molten chocolate cake I ever tried .. they even recommended it as their best dessert -_- 
Again 0/5 

Now lastly everyone of us got stomach aches and a bit of diarrhoea eating their shit food .. we literally paid 3700 rs to buy a culture medium for E. coli -_-

P.S. the only explanation for this which I can think of is being a Sunday evening the cook got so busy that our food was prepared by the gatekeeper

Though the ambience of this place is a little shabby, it is compensated with good behaviour of the waiters and the manager. The suggested some of the lovely food.
Coming to the food, the menu card itself is so innovative. We ordered the following:-
1) Fresh lime soda
2) Pig in the blanket: This was small pieces of pork sausages wrapped in cheese and mashed potato. It was delicious and unique indeed.
3) Beef momo: They were stuffed with meat.
4) Pork chops: The meat could be a bit softer but the brown sauce was delicious.
5) Meat lover's paradise platter (pork): This had bacon, meat loaf, sausages, omlette and a delicious dip. It was really good.
6) Pancakes with nuttella
7) Molten Fantasy: it was a choco lava cake
Overall, the food was really good with unique taste.

Worst food quality ever. Ordered food at 2 am in the night to enjoy a good meal. The food was pathetic. Worst taste. I am still in shock how can a restaurant cook such pathetic items.i would never recommend anyone to try this restaurant if they want to have good food. It will be a disaster. I am a foodie and I try almost every restaurant. However in my experience of food tasting , this is the worst. It is not actually worst, it is worser than worst and I do not know the word for that. Maybe the word is not in the dictionary to describe how worst it was.

This place is like a meat paradise. You want chicken, mutton, pork, beef you get everything here. My personal favourite dish here is the bacon pasta in white sauce. My boyfriend loves the pork chops. Both are amazing. I have also tried the Shepherd's Pie, Pigs in the blanket and the Thor burger. All of them were pretty good. With good food you also get to listen to great music. This place is like a hidden gem. Also, it is open for 24hours. So all the late nighters, this place is for you all.

I haven't visited this place yet but yesterday I ordered some food for home delivery. I ordered the food 8:30 PM and it reached us at 10 pm - a long wait for items. I had ordered Pork ribs and the Chicken Pie. The Pork Ribs came with boiled veggies, mashed potatoes and an egg, sunny side up. The Chicken Pie which was basically a lot of minced chicken, corn and other spices jumbled together with a topping of cheese was deep red in colour and had a weird after taste. Not bad, but definitely wierd. The ribs were done up in a brown sauce which was good, but the meat was tough and there was the thickest layer of fat possible on them. It was a tough, tough task attempting to polish off the pork ribs. After so many positive reviews, ordering from Hondos definitely was a big let down.

We ordered for  MCB and original Hamburgers. It was a take away order. The bun was not soft as I would have liked it to be. Possibly because the restaurant doesn't bake their own breads and sources it locally. The original hamburger beef patty was over done. The patty should be succulent and very juicy. However, the edges were almost burnt and was crispy. Not used to burgers like these. Also, too much lettuce and mayo. Was disappointed.

             The staff are good and helpful. The menu has a wide variety to offer and of course is a meat lover's place.
              So we ordered beef Thor which is basically a hige beef and bacon burger. It's one of the best burgers I've tasted in the city. The tenderloin beef steak was really great. The mutton shepherd's pie is something you can count on here. The pork chops were a bit turn off, too much of fat with the ribs. The Russian Salad tasted amazing after all the meat.
             The price is worth every penny. Will definitely recommend this place and definitely coming back.

Bacon wrapped chicken was out of this world then we ordered for Monkey, a Singapore chicken noodles and roasted chilli pork they were so good... If u are a foodie u can't afford to miss out Hondos. I deduced .05 from rating for time issue otherwise they are too good

The Wolverine burger was a perfect balance of four kinds of meat and sauces. The space and decor are nothing much but they make up with their food quantity which is as remarkable as their quality. They also have good music playing. This place ensures various revisits. Special mention for the cola mojito!

Went to this place after going through a lot of good reviews in Zomato about their Burgers. Was thoroughly disappointed to see the quality and taste. We had ordered one "hell boy" and one "thor". The patty smelled and tasted strange. If my opinion of burgers are right, then these 2 do not deserve to be classified as good burgers.

Lot of improvement needed.

We have been to Hondo's a numerous times and it has been our favourite ever since the first visit. This restaurant has never disappointed us in any way. But this morning we had gone there with our pet for the first time and it was indeed very kind of them that they provided him boiled chicken on our request. They were very kind. Thank you so much Team Hondo's. It was a very special experience. We are lucky that our baby experienced the food from our favourite restaurant. And the Hell Boy was amazing. Great work Chef!

I have been to Hondo's three times now. Their burgers and steaks are awesome. I didn't like their kumropotash burger much, but that is because I personally don't like pineapple in my burger. Their thor burger is definitely the yummiest I have tasted in Kolkata. The best item I have tasted there is the pork ribs. It's just incomparable. The only item that has let me down is the cheesy topshe fry. I have no complaints about the preparation, but the fish used was not at all fresh. Will I ever visit Hondo's again? At least once every month, but I can guarantee that I won't order any fish dish there ever again.

The best part I love about this place is that it's open 24 hours. Love this feature! Here are more reasons to fall in love with this place:
Coziness of this place is what I like. A perfect place to hang out with your close friends.
Food - Pork Chops and Pork Ribs are the items that I frequently order from here. These are love! Perfectly cooked, soft and juicy. The egg poach and the saute vegetables also goes perfect with this. Also, I love their Smoked Bacon, it's yummy as you get the flavors of bacon as well as enjoy the subtle crisp, along with the glaze of honey. I must keep coming back to this place for their awesome food.
Courteousness of staff - 10/10 very cooperative and helpful; goes out of their way to please their customers with their food and service.
Also, the restaurant owners have taken a brilliant initiative of supplying free food to the needy, for which they have installed a refrigerator as well.
Hondo's is a name now; specially loved by the youngsters a lot.
Space crunch is an issue, however, they will soon overcome the same.
Kudos Hondo's

Value for money. Meat used is of superior quality. Not high on ambience or decor. Makes up with quantity and quality. Loved the hash browns and eggs as well. Will visit again!

There is a weird smell at this place.. a bit overpriced.. not so up to the mark when it comes to beef burgers, the patty is not succulent, the bun is not fresh and patty lacks seasoning, something is greatly missing in your burgers.. ‚òπÔ∏è

Heard few good reviews about this place, so I was eager to visit this joint for long. Yesterday I got the chance to drop in with one of my friends. Unlike me, my friend had visited this place previously, so she gave me the initial idea that I should not evaluate this place based on the ambiance, because there isn't any! Thanks to her, otherwise the rating would have gone further down. The place has got an ambiance which isn't cozy, warm or remotely classy. But she told me that this place can surely be visited for its food. And I really do appreciate the fact that, the items which this place is serving deserve some appreciation, attention, patronage and encouragement. But I would suggest the service can be a tad faster and a bit of staff training can do wonders.

Anyway, coming to the food we ordered for Bacon wrapped chicken fillets, Virgin mojito, Cola mojito, Pork Chops and Pork Ribs. The drinks were nice and the balance of lemon juice, sugar and mint leaves were perfect. The Bacon wrapped chicken fillets were nice and was covered with dry crushed herbs, could have been awesome if the chicken was tad more succulent. But overall, flavour-wise it was really nice. The pork chops and ribs were nice and flavourful for that brown sauce and sprinkle of dry herbs on top. They were accompanied with mashed potatoes which I didn't like that much as it wasn't creamy, also it had nice saut√©ed veggies and sunny side up. Though my pork chops had too much fat in that piece, almost 90 percent or more maybe was filled with fat. I have had pork chops in the country and abroad and I'm more than aware how it should be. But anyway, I hope this would be taken care of and it can only improve from here. I really hope they do well in the coming days. Pocket pinch is extremely bearable and that is a plus point for them, for sure.

Cheers!

A great place to try out some irresistible and mouth watering (innovative) dishes. ¬†I went for a treat with my Dada. ¬†We tried some pork momos which were too good to explain. Chicken roast was good.. but i was actually blown away by the WONDERFUL Shepherd's Pie (pork). Having the pie with garlic breads is a must have for every foodie out there .. loved it.. As we were full we couldn't ¬†try the KUMRO POTASH Burger and bacon. those are in my bucket list. Will surely try it Next time.

It was a terrible day at work. I was returning home and was very hungry. Hungry and a terrible mood. Very bad combination. The bus stopped in from of Hondo's, I was supposed to get down at the next stop. I just got down there in front of Hondo's, went inside and asked someone, "ekkhuni taratari ki pawa jabe ? But Beshi bhaaja bhuji cholbe Na ". Another person asked " grilled chicken steak cholbe with veggies" ! I thought for a second, it's healthy. I nodded and waited for my food. After around 20 mins it was there in front of me, grilled chicken with veggies with mashed potatoes. Oh there was one fried egg as well. I finished it off in 10 mins. Thanked them for satisfying my hunger pangs and left. 

Am looking forward to another date with Hondo's. Next time I will try the breakfast platter. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

One of the best places in South Kolkata if you are craving for a mouth watering beef burger. The food is delicious and will only leave you wanting for more. 

I had a choice of meat sandwich and an original hamburger with french fries. Both the dishes were remarkable and very well presented. 

Also, they service 24*7 and  do home deliveries. 

I strongly recommend everyone to visit Hondo's  and treat their taste buds.

We were here famished after a long drive and it was quite late so we dropped in at this place. Some of my friends recommended this place for its Beef Burgers and Steaks we gave it a shot. 

Not to be disappointed at all with the food were we. The Honey Glazed Beef steak was medium rare and was quite nice. 
And we ordered run of mill Beef Hamburger and the Wolverine and Thor burger as the name will entice you to. Now in Marvel universe cant say who would win between Wolverine and Thor but here the Thor definitely drives it home. Going by size, burger was made for some asgardian if u may üòÇ

Anyway.. the decor is nothing much to talk about.. service okayish, little bit sloppy if u ask me.. 
but the food deserves applause. Bang for the buck and that at wee hours of night its an added advantage.

Drop in.. have the Thor burger along with steaks.. leave home happy. 
*The tallest one in the my burger pics is the bad boy Thor !

Visited today. Took short menu. But excellent. I would like to try other dishes there. As other reviews say, this is not a dining specialist. But focuses on the food. And they are a straight success there.
____________________________
Visited again to taste the stir fried chili beef. Really nice experience.
____________________________
The best experience now I had when I ordered a Beef Thor Burger on the night of Ashtamee this year for a home delivery. Order was taken through direct phone number. Not Zomato UI. But the food that was delivered was worth remembering until end of my life. Each and every bite was like a memorable dream. All my best wishes to Hondos and team with a hope that they would become one of the significant restaurants of the city in coming days.
____________________________
Another wonderful experience I had today from Hondo's. Tried their Beef Kumropotash Burger. Very difficult for me to comment on which one is better amongst Thor, Wolverine and Kumropotash! The packaging for home delivery was perfect and dine with care. Delivery was on time and any comment is unnecessary for the food quality and taste. Each bite of it had a surprise hidden underneath. I should specially mention about the pineapple slices, they made an extraordinary combination with the rest of the ingredients!
I need to plan for my next visit there again.

Discovered this place over a quick search of Restaurants in the area on the zomato app. The food over here is value for money and it helped fill the famished souls we were that evening without burning a huge hole in our pockets. If you're a bit low on cash but would still want some premium food come here.

Talking about the food, We had ordered a Cheese and bacon pasta and the pork chops.
The pasta was plain old plain old nothing out of the ordinary but not bad either, the quantity was good enough to feed two hungry college students who missed breakfast.
The Pork chops looked visually pleasing, brownie points for presentation. The meat was tender and stripped off the bone at ease.

Definitely a must visit for college goers around Jadavpur and Ruby area.

if ever there was a small eatery with a big heart, it is Hondo's! there are 4-5 tables stuck in the cafe with barely any space to move your elbows. the menu card is exhaustive but very hard to read given the style that has been employed with dark paper and small font. but forget, that - those are the 2 inconsequential issues to an otherwise fantastic experience.
we ordered the chicken caesar salad as we waited for our main course. we decided to go in for the burgers. so, we ordered a kumdo potash and the Hellboy burgers. we were stumped by the size of the burgers! HUGE! and, delicious! every bite was succulent with the freshness of the produce hitting every check box! how we finished our meal is a surprise to us...because we were quite sure that we wouldn't be able to! dessert was flat - strange puddingy wants to be something i am not sure what! but what the hell, the burgers were enough to make us want to return for the steaks and the grills. their breakfast menu is tempting too. ¬†this is open all day and all night! in calcutta, that is a huge plus. give it a shot, you won't be disappointed! wishing the owners of Hondo's all the very best for a fab future! <3

Ambience is kind of not good. It's a minimalistic design better to say that it's a cube without any design and a split AC. But the food they offer is reasonably cheap and big in size. The price is quite moderate. If you are trying steak then it is a good place to visit and they have a huge range of sauces to choose from. They make great noodles with a wide variety of noodles to choose from. One thing that this restaurant offers unlike other restaurants is the variety of food. Plus their food sizes are always big. This makes it a must go restaurant for a foodie. Their 'Thor' burger is really big and very tasty.

Only, good thing is that they are always open 247. So, if you live in South Kolkata like in Tollygunge or Behala then you can drive to get some food or else just pick the phone and order them.

I could rate it a full 5, but I will give this place a little more scope to improve in terms of decor and ambience. üòä

To begin with, the food comes in excellent quantities. The portions are filling and the presentation enhances the appetite. Hondo's is value for money.
You get chicken, fish, pork, beef, and what not. The food is served neatly, and they are all well cooked. The pork ribs are tender enough to be deboned easily. The momos are larger than the average size, and delicious. The Pig in a Blanket is a remarkable tasty dish. It is a must try. I love all their pork dishes, and anything that comes wrapped in crispy bacon.
I enjoyed the HellBoy burger. The hell's sauce was excellent, so were the Cajun spices and onions.
The double beef double cheese patty burger is a treat for the eyes, the taste buds as well as the soul of a foodie üòä

And what's the icing on the cake? 
This joint is open 24*7. It has a solution for all the untimely munchies. 

I'm coming back here again, and again, and again ‚ò∫

This was a sudden visit one Thursday afternoon. We entered Hondo's as it was on our wish list for a long time. The ambiance was not that pleasing and the waiters we're reluctant even to get up and take the order. The seating area was small and the AC was not even on. Well we were exhausted as it was schortching heat outside and I was deemed to give the restaurant a 3 or a 2.5 after this. But then after the food came we were awed! We ordered two dishes namely
1. Pig in the blanket and
2. Mcb burger with extra cheese added. 
The pig in the blanket was simply heaven and the burger beautifully decorated, though not as good as Chilli's, was well cooked too! 
The price was inclusive of taxes even after the introduction of GST so the bill was eventually pocket friendly! Overall a 4 for the price and food!

Hondo's has always been a go-to place for me, mainly because of the 24 hour service, ready to satiate your hunger pangs whenever and where ever. 
It's hard to make a solid choice out of the numerous delicious items on the menu. 
We finally decided on the Kumropotash burger, the Mushroom burger, the Mango burger and the Spicy Jalape√±o Beef Steak. And for starters, we took Cheese Pongs, Hog Chicken(bacon-wrapped chicken) along with Virgin Mojito and Aam Panna.
The Hog Chicken was one of the best items I've ever had and the Pongs were crunchy on the outside and warm and soft inside with a refreshing coriander mayo. The Mojito and Aam Panna were the perfect accompaniments to wash things down. 
Well,  I'll start with the Mango Burger, which was absolutely gorgeous! At first, the combination of mango and meat may make you feel a bit apprehensive, but trust me, it will be one of the best burgers you have ever had. The patty was juicy and the sweet mango was going with it wonderfully! 
The Kumropotash burger was a delight both to the eyes and the palette. With its juicy patty and crunchy onion rings and generous amount of bacon, it was fantastic!
The mushroom burger was beautifully balanced and a treat for all those vegetarians out there! 
And finally, the spicy beef steak had just the right amount of spice to tingle your taste buds with a side of mashed potatoes and boiled, saut√©ed veggies. 
Overall, it was a pleasant experience, the staff was friendly, the ambience was cozy and though there is bit of a space crunch, the food will be enough to make up for it and bring you back, craving for more!

A friends party near Kalikapur, and Hondo's was our obvious choice to call in dinner. Spoke to the owner, he was very helpful. Guided us through the menu - and we finally decided upon pork ribs, and pork rice. The ribs were huge with excellent bbq sauce. The rice was a standalone dish in itself. The pork meat adding much flavor to the rice! Highly recommended, and thank you for making our parties more happening with your food.

Hondo's had been on my bucket list for a very long time! And finally when I was invited here for a food tasting session, it was time for me to visit this very popular joint!

Located on Prince Anwar Shah Road, this caf√©/restaurant is not at all hard to find. The place is small and cozy and has no interior decorations. Anyway, that won't bother you much, because the food is gonna blow your mind. The food is the USP of this place and the fact that they make it their sole priority is what makes Hondo's so popular!

I was accompanied by Subham Ghosh and the first item that we ordered were the Chicken Momos. The juicy momos arrived in no time and were served with a spicy red sauce. The momos were soft and succulent, with ample stuffing. What makes it a winner is the price which is only Rs. 90! I don't know any place where you could get such delicious momos at such low rates!

Next up was the Mango Beef Burger, which is again a house speciality. I was really excited and when the burger arrived, it was an appetizing sight! The combination was a unique one, beef patty and mango! What took me by surprise was the amazing taste of mango mayo, and how well it tasted with the fries. However I felt the flavour of mango overpowered the beef patty a tad bit too much. So if they can tone it down a bit, this is going be one hell of a burger!

The next item that was served had a rather catchy name - Pigs in a blanket! Grilled pork sausages on a bed of mashed potatoes baked with cheese with a layer of egg, this dish spells perfection. I haven't ever tasted anything this perfect! I can't explain how much I loved this dish! I'm absolutely going back for this one!

The stunner of the evening arrived next - Pork Chops with mashed potatoes, sauteed veggies and a sunny side up. First, the size was mammoth! Second everything tasted brilliant. The brown sauce was perfectly flavoured, the mash was creamy, and the pork chops were tender and juicy. The pieces had slightly more fat, but that's how I love my pork. Hence, I can say that this pork chop is the best ever in the city!

We had also ordered Virgin Mojito which tasted fabulous. The amount of zing and fizz was perfectly balanced. It was refreshing and chilled our souls.

Overall, I would say that Hondo's is a must visit! You can never miss this place out! The affordable pricing and the amazing quality makes this the Holy Grail for all foodies. A place which has an amazing range in terms of menu, you can never be satisfied with only one visit! I'm in love with Hondo's and will surely return again!

This is a small cafe on Prince Anwar Shah Road, which is a hidden gem for meat lovers. The best thing about them is the 24*7 delivery, which is rare to find in the city. I was recently invited by the management to try some of the signature dishes over here. 

This place isn't tough to find, owing to its proper location on the main road. The seating area is rather small and shabby but you won't come here to enjoy the ambience. It's food which would make you visit this place again and again. Well, getting into details of my visit, I started with the chicken momos. Five relatively huge momos were served with a spicy sauce. They were priced at just 90 bucks, which is way cheaper than any other restaurant you can think of. Also, the outer coating of the momo was thin, and the proportion of the chicken stuffing was generous. I wouldn't complain about the lack of soup, since I was totally lost in the beauty of the momos. The texture and the taste was perfect. It would be silly if you don't try the momos here. 

The Virgin Mojito was fizzy. The tanginess and sweetness were balanced. It was chilled and I wouldn't expect a better mojito at a meat lovers paradise. 

The Beef Mango Burger came next, which proved to be a visual delight. It did sound interesting as well. What won my heart was the mango mayonnaise sauce. It was one of the best things I've ever had. However, the sweetness of the mango mayonnaise was somewhat overpowering the taste of the beef patty but when had seperately, the sauce was extremely appetising. The burger, otherwise was juicy and extremely filling. The fries were crisp and tasted heavenly with the mango mayonnaise. Full points for that. 

The pig in a blanket was an interesting name and I was actually anxious to try this out, from the moment I had heard numerous praises from my buddies. Well, grilled pork sausages were served on a bed of potato mash, baked with cheese. The taste can't be described in words. It was simply amazing. The sausages were tender and juicy, depicting the quality and freshness. The potato mash with cheese was something I have never had before. It was a perfect accompaniment with the sausages. 

However, the show stopper was the Pork Chops. Undoubtedly these were the best pork chops I've had in the city. The portion of fat was a little more than it should be, but that's something I love. The meat was extremely soft and juicy. The brown sauce was perfectly made. The potato mash was creamy. The omlet was an additional bonus. I literally fell in love with the pork chops. This is what I'm definitely going to try at my next visit here. 

Overall, being a pretty new place, Hondo's already is a popular name among foodies. And why not? The beautiful stuff available here at such nominal rates is hard to find in the city. Also, the different innovations are praiseworthy. The menu is literally huge and I've to keep coming again and again to devour all the signature dishes in the menu.

When its 2 am in the morning and you are hungry and you got no place to go, go to hondo's. Its affordable and the food is awesome. The hospitality they give to you is beyond expectation. It would be be better if the restaurant was bigger. Try beef tenderloin steak and jacket potato with extra cheese on top. And the smoothies you get here are really good.

Its one of the best place for midnight meals. The food is really good here and the price is super affordable. Their hospitality is really overwhelming and very welcoming. I have been to this place a 100 of times and its still the best. Try veg penne pasta in white sauce and jacket potato corn and cheese with extra cheese topping.

This is a very small cafe on Prince Anwar Shah Road. Probably the most easiest to locate. The decor of the palace is pathetic and space problem remains unmanaged. At a first glance you will feel the decor is made of cobwebs.
Now the food. They have an extremely large variety on the menu most of which are available. We ordered a Mango burger and a burger with mushroom sauted on it. Both had pork patty. I have had no better burger in recent times. The mango burger is a must try. That is one of the most innovative dishes I ever had and was satisfied. The price is worth the quantity. Will fill your hungry stomach up. The staffs are amicable and well behaved. Will visit again once I go back to Kolkata.

Situated very near to South city mall. It's a very small restaurant with only 3 tables but it serves you amazing food. Went there to have steaks and burger on a rainy Sunday afternoon. We ordered pig in the blanket for starter. For main course we had wolverine pork burger accompanied with fries and sauce and beef steak in mushroom sauce accompanied with mashed potatoes,sauted boiled Vegetables and sunny side up egg poach. Overall a very nice experience with a pocket pinch of Rs 880 .. happy dining!!

We went there for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was completely empty may be because of the heavy rains outside. The place was dark and some sort of weird odour was coming out of a corner. Their service was so bad that they didn't even offer or serve us water until we requested them to! Since we were extremely hungry after our 3 hours of shopping session, we kept our patience and ordered for a starter. Even after serving the starter we weren't given any dishes to have it on. We were kind of pissed off and asked impatiently, loudly for dishes. But fortunately, the food was very tasty.

We ordered Chicken Pongs with Coriander Mayo as starter. Then we ordered Chilli Pork, Chicken Stroganoff, rice cooked with herbs, and Pork Chops. In the end, we ordered for sweet lime soda. Each of the dishes was extremely delicious, especially the starter and the Chilli Pork. Even the Stroganoff was just yummy. The dish Pork Chops mainly consists of Pork Fat so if you're not fond of pork fat, do not order it. Try out their food by ordering online or on phone rather than having it there in their restaurant.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: Rs. 800 for two

It was past 2 in the night when my friends and I had serious hunger pangs. Browsing through Zomato we came across Hondo's and Lord bless their 24*7 delivery anywhere in South Kolkata.

The staff who took our order told us that they have a huge order in line and hence ours would take a little time but ensured they would make it asap. We ordered burgers, Roxette and MCB.

About 50 minutes from then we good the delivery. The burgers were not piping hot but warm enough. Each burger came with name bearing flag , sauce and a sealed pack of wafers. Impressed already?

Roxette is a basic chicken patty burger in cajun sauce with layers of lettuce, cheese . The burger was bit crispy on the out side and soft and moist from the inside. You can totally make out the cheese blended with the cajun mix. Too good.

MCB had a beef patty with sauted mushroom and cheese. This was milder in taste but the flavour of the patty was pretty gripping.

Hondo's hence not just talks about good food , they provide you with better. Would love to visit the place sometime soon and try the other delicacies.

If you're on a diet and want to cheat this is the BEST place for that because once you order your food it will never reach you on time. It will reach you so late that either you will end up having something else or your hunger will die. So you won't end up cheating on your diet. I had a horrible experience last night. They say it's 24 hrs delivery. üòÜ what a joke. That just means it will take 2-4 hrs for delivery (they missed the '-' in between). I ordered my food around 9ish and I didn't get it till after 12 am. Naturally my hunger had died and the food ended up in the refrigerator instead of my stomach. Worst of all was the delivery executive who came just near the location and while I was explaining to him which way to take next his phone went off. So he went back to the restaurant after being so close to my house to get another phone. It was such a mess!

Ordered one ham-burger with bacon and cheese as add-ons through Zomato. The burger was good but not awesome or something like that because the beef patty was a bit crunchy instead of being juicy. However, everything else was ok. The burger is quite heavy and will kind of fill your stomach. Anyways, looking forward to the other items when I will order again.

This little gem was hiding from my view for a while until I was told I HAVE to check it out. Now owing to my insane schedule I have been unable to actually physically go here and eat my fill. But on a Sunday evening, sitting in office and getting some prep done, my colleagues and I decided we were so hungry we could eat an entire cow.

Cow reminded us of Hondo's and we just HAD to order in some burgers. We all ordered their classic hamburger and a chilli beef.

Taste was on point, the bun to patty ratio was fine, the lettuce and tomatoes fresh and crisp adding the perfect zing. We took some extra cheese and bacon, the bacon could have been more generous, we only got one strip each, which was really not up to the add on charge. The cheese was good and made the entire thing taste better (or is it just me?). The patty was perfectly cooked, not too well done which tends to make beef chewy and hard.

The chilli beef was beautiful. It was tangy, the meat was tender, the veggies were crunchy and well cooked. Although we had asked specifically for dry chilli beef, we received the gravy one. But we can let that slide, can't we? And it's because the whole thing was so nice. It really was. Even for people averse to chilli, this is mild and just tingles your taste buds the right amount.

The prices are a tad steep, I'll be honest. But the food is worth it. The experience would have been even more more memorable had the little screw ups not happened, but hey, to err is human. The delivery took a considerable while, which perhaps was because it was a Sunday. The bacon grudge I'm holding against you, until next time.

I will recommend this little joint to all my friends and family strongly for a (un)healthy dose of good ol' American and continental cuisine. And I will of course go here, I just have to now!

Owing to some scintillating pictures on Facebook, we decided to give this joint a try that promises to serve authentic European food.. And, honestly, we weren't disappointed at all!

It is a small cosy joint with a good ambience, lively decor and friendly staff! We ordered a classic Hamburger and Beef tenderloin steak ( served with veges). The beef was moist, juicy and melt-in-your-mouth, the burger was a mouthful piece of heaven. They serve hearty portions of perfectly seasoned goodness that can fill a hungry stomach and fix a broken heart!
Definitely worth your money and repeated visits!

A little smaller than what I expected but since I went during brunch time it did nothing to diminish my experience there. Loved loved loved loved loved the Shepherd's Pie. I am so going back there. In fact so far as the pigs in blanket are concerned, the version at Hondo's is better than the original one. Please keep up the good work. And if any expansion happens at the cost of quality don't do it. I'd rather haunt this while its a joint and have a hearty meal.

I had ordered twice from this eating joint and everytime it was a surprise. My second order a beef steak was particularly good. It was well cooked and the sauce was simply mind blowing. Pork is plentiful in the city but getting a joint serving equally good beef is really rare. Specially where the country is heading with regards to controlling eating habits of common people (pun intended), this place is a boon. The seating area is a little less nevertheless compensated by the plenty that they have to offer from their menu. It's a must try out. Also I am yet to try their momos.

Located on the main road to the right at Prince Anwar Shah Road near Balaram Mallick and Radharaman Mallick sweet shop while coming from South City Mall side...

Visited few months back with my friend and her husband for a quick bite in the evening...Both of them had visited this place earlier and were in all praise for their burgers...it was my first visit, wanted to give a shot...

The place is small and minimally decored.. the manager was friendly and helped with our orders...we ordered 2 Roxette Chicken patties (one with Bacon) seasoned with Cajun Spice and Cheese, 1 Roasted Basa in Lemon Butter Sauce and 2 Fresh lime sodas..

The food took some time to hit our table... I loved the Roxette chicken patty...it looked small but was very much filling...My friend liked the Roasted Basa that came accompanied with beans,carrots,corns and baked potatoes but she felt the lemon essence lacked... Fresh lime sodas were a bit too sweet..

After we were done the manager took the time to know our feedback..appreciate the gesture..

Overall food was good...but prices are on the higher side..friendly service...easy to locate...all the best guys..

Really disappointed with the service I got for the 1st time while ordering thru the app after placing the order I get a call allmost after 15-20 mins saying rather asking I had placed an order it seems , after me confirming person tells apparently they did not see as no sound came and apps just started it seems and it wld take about more 30mins for the order (funny) , why have an app if it's not functioning fully so is claimed by the staff , have been regularly ordering thru phone , guess ordering Thur the app was a bad idea , really sad to say  pathatic service , I think either get the staff to be more alert or don't have options that won't or don't work properly. What's the point of 24hrs aNd having an own app wen the staff won't even check up the to see about orders in the app .and what is sad lastly they did not really care also not even apologetic about what has happened , guess losing 1single customer does not matter .... 
Anyway all the best guys ...

The pasta was awful,it dis not have any white sauce it was just some boiled and cooked pasta with cheese. The nutella crepe had also become really soggy and messed up. The mango smoothie was fine. You guys need to buckle up. 
Also I had given specific instructions via zomato and calling the restaurant to not ring the door bell as it was really late at night but the delivery executive was not even informed about the same.

Unlike the big name it holds Hondo's is a small restaurant with 3 tables inside and 1 table outside with a maximum capacity of 21-22 people. The place is cramped- the space between the tables has been adequately maintained minimal!

The perk at this restaurant is 24x7 service.

We were 3 people who went to this restaurant with hunger pangs. We ordered for a Roasted chicken, Penne pasta with chicken in white sauce and Egg Soft noodles. Our drinks included Blue lagoon and Lemon ice tea. 

We received our first dish despite telling him to keep bringing whatever is made first-after 45 minutes. This delay was not really convincing. The next at 54 minutes.

The skin on the chicken was not removed which was a major concern to me. Moreover the sauce used in the chicken was not very happening- we didn't like the dish. The boiled veggies served with the dish too was not tasty (at least some salt and pepper). 
The penne pasta with chicken was very good- I would recommend anyone going to this place to try this pasta.

The proportions are very good and value for money is good enough. The delay was so high that I had to cancel the noodles though.The management did not create a scene and wilfully accepted their mistake and removed it from the bill.

Hondo's minus delay plus a little more interest in making those dishes tasty is a happening place to hang out with friends for a nice evening chat.

I had ordered one cottage cheese veg side dish in Chinese 5 spice and it was such an awful dish. There were pieces of paneer which was elastic and were swimming in light soya sauce which was almost 80% of the container. Moreover the lady over phone does not how to speak and promised the food delivery to be done by 15 minutes that is 11p.m that day where as it had reached us at 11.50pm almost midnight. Never going there again.

Food- The burgers are amazing here, probably the best in Kolkata. I've been here for 5 times in the last 3 weeks and i'm working my way through the burger menu. I'll suggest Hell Boy Burger or the MCB and also avoid ordering Molten Fantasy, it sucks(won't if you're into puddings).
Ambience- Cozy little joint which is not overly decorated and they play Pink Floyd.
Service- 10/10 on this. They are open 24/7, like they never close and that is a dream come true. This joint is like the white castle from the harold and kumar movie, the burgers are worth all the trouble.

Ordered in from Hondo's , 
Fast delivery , but the food was quite disappointing .

Too start things off .
The potato wedges were over fried :/
The chicken burger patty was burnt and I'm guessing the oil they used was the same oil they had fried fish in, hence the patty absorbed the fish smell .

The restaurant offered me a replacement for the burger which was a cottage cheese sandwich , which was also a disappointing affair.

The restaurant is quite reasonable and offers good service otherwise and has a fairly large and interesting menu .

Visited this place few weeks back. The only feeling I'm left with is to find enough time to give this place another visit as soon as possible. 
The food is way too good to belong at a time in Kolkata where the new eateries are coming up with more innovative ways to burn a hole in our pockets rather than leaving a satisfactory taste in our palates. The burgers are hugely portioned with the actual and proper stuff that is expected from the description in the menu. Their version of Pigs in Blanket with hungarian sausages, mashed potatoes and cheese, is the closest combination of heaven I've come across.The only thing I would've loved more is a bit more cheese sprinkled on the top. 
The best part is they are successfully delivering what they promise. Needless to say, I'm in love with this place for their burgers. Can't wait to taste the rest of the dishes!

Now, this is the perfect place if you have a burger or pork ribs appetite late night. The place is small and they have only sitting arrangement for like 16 people, but it doesn't matter; you just get it here, order a Thor or Wolverine burger and enjoy! Prices are inclusive of all taxes, so it's pretty pocket friendly. Will surely visit this place again.

Read a lot of positive reviews on Zomato and got recommendations as well, hence decided to visit this place. But the experience turned out to be pretty average, to say the least. 
First and foremost, I really wouldn't recommend anybody to dine in here, especially in summer. Rather opt for takeaways or home delivery. The place is extremely small and cramped for space, and insanely stuffy. There's an AC which doesn't really seem to be working, and the few fans are so tiny that they are as good as null. I kept sweating throughout, and it's quite hard to enjoy your food with that. 
Now coming to the food, we ordered hen in blanket, baked crab meat, lemon grilled fish, fresh lime soda and lemon iced tea. 
The drinks were good, nothing too extraordinary though. 
Hen in blanket was probably the only dish that stood out for us. Nicely grilled sausages baked with mash and cheese (and we also opted for scrambled egg as add-on). 
The crab was also well done, but the quantity for the price paid, in a restaurant like this, is rather small. I probably wouldn't have complained if it were some speciality restaurant in a shopping mall. But with seating and cooling like that, I definitely expected more for 350 bucks. In fact nothing came on the side as well, except one boiled egg (lol). 
The grilled fish disappointed as well. The cut of the fish was way too thick for my liking. Also, too much lemon had been used and the fish tasted sour. Nothing short of a disaster. 
In spite of that, we ended up paying ‚Çπ980. So don't make the mistake of thinking that this place is too cheap, judging from the seating and interiors (which suggest so). 
Hope to have a better experience on my next visit, if there is one.

Nope..this is my fifth visit..but no, Hondo's food yesterday wasn't as expected. The veg items (mushroom burger n JP mushroom n cheese) was awesome..but something was wrong with roasted Chill pork..it is supposed to be dry and spicy, but was same as chili chicken at any restaurant..pork noodles was bland and laden with soya sauce..


Thumbs down this time!!!

The place is pretty small but that doesn't matter. The burgers will surely make you visit this place again. Huge variety to choose from. We had Roxette, Shepherd's Pie and Pudding. And the price is inclusive of tax. Pocket friendly with good quantity.

Went there for first time and it was a mi dblowi g exoerience.Though the place is a bit small , it iffers you the best food you can expect in anytime. The burger I had there with a little customization was outstanding and I would love to go to this place over and over again. Thank you Hondos for serving my empty tummy at 1.30 am in the night with some awesome food.

The thing which strikes most about Hondo's, is not only are the food selection great, but the prices and quantity are mind blowing.

Till now, I have ordered from Hondo's over 15 times, but still have never been to the restaurant in person. There are highs and lows of my experience with them, some of them I'll highlight

7th Feb 17 - First order. Pork Chops and Hen in the Blanket. Absolutely stunning. Succulent pork chops, with absolutely juicy ¬†fat content, and the hen in the blanket was very good too. The sausages were nicely coated with a light oily layer with cheese and the potato was delicious. Totally 5/5 experience.

Over the next few order, I've tried multiple items including Pork Ribs, Jacket Potato etc.

Sometime around late April 17 - I ordered Pork Chops (x2), Quarter Chicken, Hogged Chicken. by far the most disappointing order. The chops were really overdone and plastic-y, the bacon in the hogged chicken was too hard, and there was a queer smell from the quarter chicken. This was the first time I was introducing Hondo's to my parents, and it was just sad.

There has been 3-4 orders between this period, most of them were good, but on another occasion, I got Pork Ribs instead of the ordered Pork Chops, no big deal.

22nd May 2017 - ¬†Ordered the original hamburger with cheese and beef tenderloin steak, both for the first time. Oh god, the burger is just heavenly, has to be one of the best burgers I have had. Perfectly crispy patty on the outside, soft and fall apart insides, the sauce applied goes really well. The beef steak was pretty good, but somehow, the mashed potatoes provided surprised me. Surprisingly buttery and fluffy. Again a 5/5 experience.

25th May 2017 - Hunger strikes early morning. I wanted a burger, but it was missing from the order menu in Zomato, so I got a Non Veg Breakfast Platter. Perfectly cooked bacon, excellent eggs and crunchy hash browns. The onions were a little too peppery, but overall again a 5/5 experience.

This is just a small preview of my experience with Hondo's. All of them has been on delivery, so I don't know about their decor and hospitality as such.¬†

PS: Ordered the famous Hell Boy and Pudding for first time today. Surprise me :D

The food quality is not over the top but it is definitely not something to negate about ! 
A try out place for people who wants to have a small hangout and a heaven for late night cravings !

Serving size is decent and prices are pocket friendly.. their mojitos pay perfect homage to the food. A must try restaurant for all ' secular' foodies !üòâ

Expected authentic Continental food from Hondos....
Ordered for the first time....Chicken stroganoff....The taste was not good and far from the authentic taste....there were lots of chicken pieces but the gravy was of weird taste with lots of capsicums and tomato.....The cheese flavour and the perfect smell of the dish was not at all there......The rice had peas in it......
Overall didnot enjoy the food at all and not worth the price of Rs.376
Have tried stroganoff from so many places.... I do agree taste may vary but this was far from my expection.
You guys may be good at making other dishes and I can't comment unless I taste them but stronganoff tasted really bad......

This place is a bit clumsy though they have placed 6 chairs in table which usually other restaurants use for 4 people. Judging by the price etc. it should be have a better ambiance, but the food was delicious no doubt. We ordered the Thor and Wolverine burger. The Thor burger was huge in size and is comparable to two burgers. Both of them tasted very good and both had a nice combination of many kind of meats. Both of them comes with a good number of french fries.

Try their burgers.its really good.the beef patty in their burger is awesome.so just go for a simple beef patty burger,to my opinion if you really want to cherish their awesome beef patty thn go for a double patty burger dont pverload it with sausages or bacons.but you can add extra cheese ofcourse because cheese is cheese.a bucket full of cheese is not enough for me.
Now coming to beef tenderloin steak.
Its awesome.i tried with brown sauce.and its best.
And dont forget to ask for more brown sauce in a monkey bowl.though i would prefer more cooked steak than medium rare.
And last but not the least their custard. Try it with honey.
Its heaven.
But i didnt like their bacon wrapped chicken.
I think they can satisfy me with their crispy bacon.hope so.
Jacked potato is good.

No comments after getting the wrong order 5 times in succession, with 3 times occurring in a span of 1 month. Especially when they deliver a bowl load of capsicum as a Russian salad after saying no customisation available. They cannot get a salad, leave alone a sandwich right. Having a new chef is a one time excuse that was placed this time. Thank you. You lost me.

The resturant  is too expensive compared to the street cafe like look.The ambience is horrible.We had to wait for 55 minutes before any food came to our table and everything was overcooked .The service was horrible.The only served the food without giving any plates or spoon or anything .You have to ask for each and everything .Moreover for two people they expect that they will provide 1 plate and other can have from the main dish itself.It was a horrible experience. I have been to every continental  restuarants serving european based cuisine but I really found this place to be worst and expensive compared to the standard.

Looking for a pocket friendly restaurant? Well this place is one of those kind. If you're craving for some palatable dishes then they will serve you in the best possible way. The dishes are immensely delectable and equally cost-effective. They have also added some cool food items recently. The place is open for 24hours.

Despite ordering from it many times, I still go back to this place because the staff are polite and the food delicious. The quality of ingredients used is top class and their turkey, available at the year's end, is extremely tasty.

Interesting Menu! Tiny eatery on Anwarshah Rd. Seats about 10 people. Not for fancy dinners. They are open 24*7 and are available for all night deliveries as well. Very slow service however. We had ordered a Grilled Fish in lemon butter sauce, grilled chicken steak, a beef steak in spicy jalapeno sauce and a beef steak in pepper mushroom sauce. Thankgod that this place sells beef steak. Its a rarity. The steaks are amazing, though a bit on the spicy side. I loved the jalapeno sauce. The fish was great too. The chicken not so much. Quantity wise as well, the chicken steak will not fill your tummy. Prices are slightly higher than expected. Looking forward to trying out the Burgers.

Edit: I went back again with my friend and I WOULD NOT recommend getting the pork ribs. I received a plate full of fat with barely any meat. It made me nauseous eating it. The burgers are still as delicious as always though.

Hondo's was on my wishlist for a long time as I have heard it is a paradise for meat lovers. Though the small outlet is not that impressive at the first look, the menu changed our mind. We ordered Hell Boy burger and beef tenderloin steak with jalapeno sauce. We also ordered virgin mojito and cola mojito. Mojitos were a bit different from the other places. I think they use some jelly sort of thing as the base of mojito; which makes it so good. Now‚Äã the food, the burger was a really big one. I don't think anyone can have it alone unless he have an empty stomach. The patty was juicy- it was a pork patty and the meat was very soft. And the beef steak, it was the best beef steak that I have ever had. It was medium rare and the meat was properly cooked. It was served with mashed potatoes and veggies. The bill was 800 which didn't hurt our pockets. Another impressive thing is, it is a 24*7 open restaurant.
Overall experience- 
Decor- 3.5/5

Also had bacon wrapped chicken which was extremely well-made. The manager heard me praising the sticky sweet sauce the bacon came doused in, and promptly offered an extra helping of sauce! Very good service and great food. Would love to visit again.

This place is food heaven. Tempted by their mouthwatering pictures, decided to order in and give their burgers a try. The Fatboy and Hellboy burgers are the ones i went for and surprisingly, the food tastes just as good as it looks. Both burgers were cooked to perfection with juicy patties loaded with flavour. I would even go so far as to rate them better than the burgers served at Hard Rock Cafe. I will definitely be eating at this place again.Special mention: The Fatboy. This burger is HUGE and has an entire egg in the middle of the patty. Nothing like anything I have had before. It is as delicious as it is beautiful!¬†Keep up the great food! :)

Next we had the hellboy burger, I really liked the spice kick of the burger. Not a big fan of burger, but this burger was awesome, the patty was nice and juice, good flavors, the bread wasn't soggy, so definite thumbs up.
Would definitely like to visit this place again.

Tried their food for the first and in all probability for the last time on 13th April 2017 at 2:00 a.m.

The person who took the order was courteous and we went for Grilled Chicken,Roasted Chicken and Roasted Bass in Lemon Butter Sauce.The food reached on time at around 3:00 a.m as was mentioned.Below are my observations regarding the food:

Grilled Chicken-1/4th of a dry and smelly piece of chicken and the awkward smell was not because of the grilling.The menu mentions marination of special tandoori spices which didn't get reflected in the taste at all.Priced at INR 230 it was absolute high way robbery.

Roasted Chicken-Was a quarter of a Chicken(1/4th) coated in a brown sauce with mashed potatoes and veggies.It tasted extremely okayish and nothing to be blown away with.Priced at INR 180 which was not worth it.

Roasted Bass in Lemon Butter Sauce-First of all,they missed in providing the add ons which were Buttered Herbed Rice,Fries and Veggies.Thankfully I checked and called the outlet about it to which the person taking the call had the audacity to actually ask as to whether he should send it over rather than offering the same proactively.However,when I obviously answered in the affirmative,he obliged.The supposed add ons arrived at 4:30 a.m. and I had lost my interest and great deal of appetite by that time.However,I tried it and was the most horrible Basa that I have tasted.It was an over "roasted" piece which was thousands of miles away from the word "soft & succulent".It had a negligible amount of sauce which in any case didn't have any flavour.There was no trace of "butter" in the herbed rice and the fries were as tough as "Nimki".Priced at INR 300 which is obnoxious and an exquisite example of looting customers at its best.

Medocrity seems to be a way of life for some outlets and this place by far takes that coveted title.

The management/owner MUST stick to what they can deliver instead of making a fancy menu of which they know nothing about.

The only PRO is they operate 24/7 which doesn't help when they provide what they did and they don't charge any extra taxes though no one should even try what they offered even if it didn't cost a dime.

I so wish Zomato had a way of negative rating because my fingers are itching to provide the same to this very well deserved place.

Update 16th April 2017:
I received a call from the owner soon after my review got published and he wanted to know as to what exactly went wrong.He was apologetic and wanted me try the same items or other items from the menu on a complimentary basis.He went to the extent of saying that it will compell me to change my view and it surely did.I decided to try the following items the day after and below are my observations:

He'll Boy Burger-It was a great burger that I had in a long time.The bun and Chicken party was perfectly cooked.There was a generous amount of mayo and was not overpowered by veggies which didn't make it soggy.The size was the burger was also pretty good because of the thick patty.I wish they added some Jalapenos for that extra kick as it was only midly spicy.Priced at INR 180 it's pretty good.

Bacon Pasta in White Sauce-The pasta was cooked nicely and the flavours were good as well.The only turn off was the lack of any creaminess as the whie sauce as not sufficient and seasoning could have been better.The quantity was decent and should be sufficient for 2 moderately hungry people.It was priced at INR 250.

Jacket Potato in Mushroom & Cheese-Seasoning was the only concern otherwise it was nice in taste.Priced at INR 110 which was decent enough.

Chicken Pongs with Coriander Mayo-Perfectly cooked,soft and melt in the mouth.The only concern was lack of sufficient mayo and the coriander was blended in too smooth in the mayo.Priced at INR 140.

I called up the owner and shared my feedback and that is when I learnt that they were short of mayo and hence they were trying to ration the same.

However,we went onto to order the below on the same day and following are the observations of my family members since I was unable to taste them as I had to step out.

Bacon Pasta in White Sauce-The person who tried it didn't like it due to lack of white sauce though I specifically asked for it.

Veg Pasta in White Sauce-It was again not appreciated due to lack of creaminess and adequate seasoning.Priced decently at INR 180

Jacket Potato in Corn & Cheese-It was nice and good but seasoning remained an issue.Priced moderately at INR 90.

Grilled Chicken-They provided a juicy and moderately sized chicken breast which was soft as well but somehow lacked flavour.Priced at INR 230.

P.S. I added extra seasoning in terms of salt and pepper though I didn't want to but had to due to lack of it.

Overall,it was a much better experience and hence changing my previous rating of 1 to 3.5 for now.

Special note for the owner who really has respect for customer service and satisfaction.

Hope they improve and do well in the future.

I loved this place. Situated on the main road. They have a 24hr home delivery to south Kolkata. The ambience is good. 
The chef and the waiters are really very courteous who always asked for suggestions to make the things better. I really appreciated their attitude for perseverance. 
Food served here is absolutely awesome.

Pork ribs: it was very succulent and delicious. Well cooked. Served with a sauce, veggies and mashed potatoes

Beef steak: the steak was medium rare. Pretty well cooked and very delicious. Served with mashed potatoes and veggies.

Beef burger: this was really great. I had got this delivered. It was awesome. I really loved it.

Chocolate brownie: this was served hot and was very delicious. Not very sugary. Soft in the core and hard crust. I enjoyed having it.

Pros: The service was very courteous. The mojitos tasted good.

Cons: The place was unkempt. The table mats were dirty. Cutlary was unclean and sticky. Every food item was too salty. And there were actually some kind of insects in my potato chips.

A much hyped, fast growing and popular name in south Kolkata. With a menu of rarely available options for meat products, this place has surely made a good name and a greater reputation. I had been hearing about them for a long time and had ordered food online using Zomato from them. 
Finally I decided to try them off in person and had a very mixed experience. 

Firstly, the one thing you need to know about this place is that they mostly rely on home deliveries and take aways. Eat-in isn't a big thing for this place.
Starting with the shop, located very close to Lord's More, this place is basically made of a small shop converted into a kitchen with a small sitting arrangement. The staff consists of a few casual guys with a casual friendly attitude. The decoration is really basic with no proper planning or design. The sitting is just a set of few tables and normal chairs. So there's actually nothing to be impressed about environment.

But what steals the game and took a 4.5 from me is the food. 
We ordered an appetizer called "pigs in a blanket". It was made of home made fried pork sausages placed on a base of mashed potato and covered with a layer of shredded cheese. It was really well prepared with a great taste.
As for the main course, we took, an MCB burger (P.S.: this is supposed to be their best and most popular item)with chicken patty and a wolverine burger with pork patty. Both the burger were made with homemade patties and freshly cooked ones. They were really juicy. The MCB burger had a fat patty with a few types of sauces, a slice of cheese and a layer of mushroom. However, the Wolverine burger was much bigger and consisted of a patty topped with some English sausages, bacon and cheese. Everything added into the burger made it really heavy. But nonetheless, it tasted amazing. Similar juicy fresh patty with a great combination of sauces. 

To top it all, the place puts up all the prices in the menu including the tax and there's no extra charges other than the food prices.

Surely, this place should be a must try for everyone specially meat lovers.

I had heard a lot about this place and finally decided to go. There are two tables outside and 3 on the inside. It's a tiny yet cozy place. The staff is extremely friendly.
FOOD
We ordered pigs in a blanket and it was more like pigs on a carpet. It was slightly bland and the seasoning wasn't well done. It was well cooked though.
Next, there were jacket potatoes with bacon. Again, it was too bland.
The Shepherd's pie was quite a delight. It had good flavor. Two people can easily fill themselves up on a Shepherd's pie.
The Hell Boy burger was pretty filling as well. The onion rings in it were a tad bit soggy. The rest of it was pretty good.
We ordered an English pudding and we asked them to substitute the honey with chocolate sauce. It was a decent pudding with Nutella and chocolate sauce. Not the best that I've tasted but pretty good.
SERVICE
The staff is pretty communicative. They, however, did not give us plates when the food came. We had to ask for it separately. They were pretty quick about it though.
AMBIENCE
Some of the customers were requesting songs and they played it which was pretty nice. The decoration isn't much but the place is quite cozy. I liked the blue lights on a branch above our table.
POCKET PINCH
The food is worth the price which is again not much. For a group of five, we shelled out less than 200 bucks each for five dishes that totally filled us up.

Situated near South City Mall it is an easy place to locate. However the number of seats are limited and so it may get crowded. We had pigs in a blanket, pork Chops and beef steak. Pigs in a blanket was really good. The steak was done well enough. However the pork chops where a great disappointment. The waiter was courteous but the food took a lot of time to prepare. It is a great place for giving adda. It is very pocket friendly and hence a very good place for college goers.

Well, there's no easy way to say this - Hondo's is near Dhaka Kalibari, but in case you are unable to locate it - look out for the 'sulabh', Hondo's is right opposite to that, across the road.

I have been there a couple of times, tasted a lot of their dishes, but the burgers stood out, hands down.

üî∏ Chicken pings with coriander mayo : It's basically balls stuffed with minced chicken and coriander - sometimes the coriander flavour might be over powering, but the mayo stands out!

üî∏Jacket Potatoes : I tried the pork one. The filling filling‚Äã is delicious.

üî∏Pig in blanket : It is basically pork sausages with a super tasty dressing loaded with herbs.

üî∏Burgers : The burgers are hands down delicious. One of my favourite is Sunburn. Though never order a Thor unless you are totally ravenous or haven't eaten in a day or two. :P

üî∏Pork Chops: It you are not a burger person, go ahead and order the pork chop. They are almost as good, honestly!

üî∏ Shepard's Pie : To tell the truth, I tried it once and it tasted really bland.

I always complained about how they served store bought chips with the burgers, but the last time I was there it was a pleasant surprise to see the chips are being replaced by french fries. And the weird sweet sauce that they kept on the table was replaced by actual ketchup! So. A biiig thumbs up for the management!

I had a nice visit to the Hondo's a while back . This review is pending for a long time . Continental food with minimum decor but with a lot of heart is what sums up a dinner experience at this place . And , this is that place where you can go twice because of its approach towards this type of cuisine . One of the main or probably the only reason being the quantity of food served is really commendable . Whereas , this is something you won't really get in the other outlets serving continental dishes. 

¬∞ Location :- This outlet is located a few steps before Lord's more in Prince Anwar shah road . 

------------------------------------------
¬∞ FOOD :- We ordered the following 3 items and because of their humongous quantity , 3 items are more than sufficient for 2 hungry person .

1. Pig in the blanket ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Sausages make great starters and when they are accompanied with mashed potatoes and cheese , it's bound to be a yummy affair . This is a good starter to have . The sausages were good but a bit on the saltier side . But, it was a dream having it with the layers of cheese and mashed potatoes which formed the bedsheet . We ordered it with an egg add-on so it that was icing on the cake . Could have been rated a little higher but the salt sausages could have been made better . Still , recommended.

2. Beef tenderloin steak ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Easily , can be voted as one of the top 3 steaks in town . And the attribute that works in their favor is the huge amount of meat that is served . So, Beef lovers , mind it . This is the place to be if you are having beef steak cravings . If the dish is to be consumed by a person they will serve you a huge chunk of meat , if it is to be shared then the huge chunk will be cut into 2 pieces . In other restaurants half of the meat is served to be honest . So, it was a huge boon for us the beef lovers . We loved the meat , it was medium rare . The meat was properly rubbed in herbs and nicely done . This is really a good beef steak to have and if you are one of the steak lovers, don't miss it .

3. Pork ribs ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Once again huge chunks of near served . 3 big rib pieces were served with meat and fat on the ribs . One of the pieces had fully fat . The good part of the dish was that the sauce was amazing and it went perfect with the meat . The not so good part of the dish was that the meat and the fat was not that tender . It took a lot of effort to cut it . So, if you are impatient with your food this is not for you but if you are you may order .

4. Cola mojito & virgin mojito ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Expertly made and we loved both of them . Went perfect with the meat . Their mojitos are highly recommended .


-------------------------------------

¬∞ Service & Ambience ( 3 / 5 ) :- Service time is a worry . The first dish took close to 10 minutes . The beef came after 10 too , but it took a long time to serve the pork item . Although , you won't find the restaurant jam-packed , it is the goid deliveries that mostly cause the delays . Ambience is minimal but convenient enough for casual dining . Yes, there is a basin for washing the hands and that is really a saving grace .

¬∞ VERDICT :- A big yes from my side . Following are the main reasons to provide base of my verdict :- 

1. Only continental restaurant where quantity of food is commendable in decent price .
2. Excellent beef steak .
3. No taxes , easy on the pocket after a whole hearted meal .

An outlet with enough items to let you wonder of visiting for a second time . And , I am looking forward to the much talked about burgers . As for those who live in South Kolkata and a big fan of steaks and meaty stuff , this is a must for you .

Swarnaditya Da,¬†I was blown away by the food. The quality of your food is outwordly. Though small, the place is comfortable and I loved the ceiling decor. It was our farewell party, and OHTHEFOOD!¬†

We had Chicken Penne Pasta in Red Sauce, Bacon Pasta in White Sauce, Shepherd's Pie (minced beef one), The famous Sun Burn and Hamburger (How satisfied I was to finally get HAMBURGER after being deceived by the same name for years ), Meat Lovers Paradise Platter, and MCB. For desserts, we ordered Molten Fantasy and Brownie with Icecream.¬†I will be visiting HONDO'S soon. Those Burgers are just Yum!
                    Update 08/06/2017: The Beef Tenderloin Steak is something to die for. They promise you medium rare (customizable) and it is medium rare (Seared outside with a red/pink centre) and the brown sauce with rosemary is mindblowingly amazing. The vegetables were well cooked, except the beans which I found a bit un-cooked to my taste. The accompanying mashed potato was perfectly cooked, no lumps and it was creamy, mushy and buttery. Highly recommended.

After 3 visits to this place... All I can say is that it's a heaven for meat lovers.
The place is homely but a bit cramped up!
But then ... The food compensates for it all.
The beef steak is undoubtedly one the best available in Kolkata....Moist and juicy just as I like it.
Choose anything from the menu... Be it their mammoth sized burgers , creamy pastas , pork chops or grilled sandwiches... It's bound to please you.
Affordable..Yes
Late night delivery.. yes
Courteous staff.. yes
The 'to go' place for all those young people who are hungry at the oddest of times....This place is open 24*7 dishing out some really seriously good food.
Hop in at Hondo's with friends and get started with your fork and spoon and knife!
P.S WOLVERINE has a whole new meaning now!

Hondos, the new kid on the block has indeed come of age in the recent past with its unique and variegated menu options to choose from. All the items have an exclusive aroma and flavour of its own which will surely tickle the taste buds of the foodies in the city. They continuously keep experimenting with their offerings quite successfully and perhaps they have the most diverse range of dishes in their menu. Specially their pork chops, steak, burgers, bacon, bombil fry, pig in the blanket deserve special mention. Each of the items are worth trying. They have a nice cozy compact dining area with soothing music and courteous and helpful staff. So you get real value for money considering the quality of the food that is served here. I am a regular customer and I am dying to taste their new offerings which indeed makes me excited as an experimental foodie. Looking forward to more delightful meals at Hondos. Wishing good luck. Highly recommended for all kinds of food lovers.

We often go for late night shows, and once the movie is over, find ourselves famished. Restaurants which serve all night hold special places in our heart (and stomach).

Hondo's was a special surprise to us, when we discovered its existence in Zomato, and visited one night at around 2am. It's a very small place (almost suffocating), and extremely nondescript - the kind that works strictly based on variety and quality of food and word of mouth publicity. Opening the menu was the first surprise - a restaurant in Kolkata which serves pig in the blanket, cheeseburger, beef collar and ox tongue? Incredible.

I ordered the Chicken Thukpa, my husband ordered the Beef Steak (recommended by the manager/owner).

Quality of food was undoubtedly great, it is evident that the place is run by a genuine connoisseur of food.
Speed of service leaves a lot to be desired for, as does the sitting arrangement. 

The second time, I visited with a friend, and we ordered a mutton shepherds pie (take-away). Even though the owner had warned us that the dish would not taste as good in a plastic container, as it would straight out of the oven, we took the risk, which did not really pay off. So, we cannot hold it against them.

All in all, a great little all-nighter joint, serving "different" kind of continental food for people with taste for such food.

Foodgasam at it's best . This is what came into my mind first . Visited this place with my friend the other day , not at all difficult to find . It's a small outlet , but you know as the saying goes 'great things comes in small packages' . The menu card was so interesting and satisfying for a movie buff like me üòÅ . So, going my the movie thing we had ordered wolverine (such a king size burger , instantly I said I love you ) . Then we ordered roasted chicken in herbs ,with that we ordered platter rice (there is no greater and better love than having good food ) . The best part was when we went it was happy hours ,so yeaayyy very thing was happy . More than 5 points for their behaviour .üòäüòäüòäüòä

Will keep it short and simple - its not the best in the town but definitely worth a try!!! I prefer ordering online since the place can accommodate hardly 16 people. I found it pretty odd that they give onions in penne pasta. Do try out chicken pongs with coriander mayo..its amazing. ¬†I personally feel they should drop the thukpa/momo from the menu and become purely continental outlet.

if i had written this review after my first visit i would have rated the restaurant 4 cos the pork chop was bang on at that time. but unfortunately my second visit was a disaster. firstly i was informed that they had some issues with the vendor so they had discontinued the voucher i purchase a month back. thankfully the owner then stepped in and agreed to accept it. We order pigs in a blanket/ grill chicken/ pork chops. the pigs in a blanket were very tasty but just a wee bit salty may be they can make the adjustment when the order the sausages if future. but what is good is that they dont use ready made sausages or frozen processed sausages. they get them freshly prepared hence the salt quotient can be handled. The chicken grill was decent however the disappointment was the pork chops which was not done well and tough. the saving grace was the feedback was given to the owner and staff and they didnt charge for the same since we were unable to eat the chops. i will visit them once again and hope that my last visit was just a one off incident when they were having a bad day and maybe my rating will increase post my next visit.

a place which was on the radar for long specially since they serve till late which is perfect for people who has a schedule like me.... and the chance came when i along with my wife and friends could manage a late night outing and reached Hondo's at about 11.45pm....this place is located bang opposite to Dhaka kalibari on prince anwar shah road.... parking cud be a bit of a problem but we managed to still tuck our car in one of the adjoining alleys... this is a tiny place with large glowsigns outside and a nicely lit up tree.... the seating is cramped up and it can accommodate around 12 people which can go upto 16 if the guests are kind enough.... there is not a lot of ambience or decor apart from some log fence with leaves which is not par with the menu or theme... coming to the menu card which is a simple binded print out of list of items,  they serve pork,  chicken and beef(no fish) yet.... we ordered a hen in blanket as starter.... a pork shepherds pie... a thor burger(seems like the most liked and recommended on zomato) and a quarter roast chicken.... the shepherds pie was really good and proportionate with the price... but shud come with some accompaniment like breads.... the starter too was pretty good.... the roast chicken was nicely cooked and rested,  a little under seasoned but was that is ok since we can adjust the seasoning from the table.... the sauce was a tad thinner in consistency but again that was acceptable but the burger was a little let down for me specially it is supposed to be the SHOWSTOPPER of the place.... it was huge,  no doubt but was dry,  served with roadside style wafers and ketchup.... and at around 400 bucks (including taxes) i expected juicier patties,  french fries or wedges or some mayo dips.... so overall the food to me was okayish for me considering the quality and the fact that the menu is not that elaborate.... being a tiny place,  the noise from the kitchen and the operations was constant and there isnt much of an ambience..... where this outlet scores is the fact that they serve that kind of food that late at night when every other place is a dead rubber.... and i think that is the most appreciable fact.... the service is pretty fast considering it to be a continental food restaurant..... this place has an extremely big potential to do really great due to the location and the operating model with a little things here and there..... all the best for the hard work they do so late at night which goes unnoticed at times.... i am sure they will overcome these things in the days to come

I am always on the lookout for good burgers, and naturally was excited to try Hondo's. Got it delivered to a friend's place so can't say anything about the ambiance. Ordered a Hellboy Burger. It was supposed to extra spicy, it was not. Plus a good burger always has French fries and a homemade sauce. They gave a packet of chips and ketchup. The burgers are huge, and no issues with the quantity. However the patty was a bit salty. Maybe it was their off day, but I won't be going back to this place.

well,  it's pretty late right now,  around 1:30 am,  and when you get that midnight hunger after a long day of work this is just paradise, i ordered roasted tomato and garlic bread along with chicken salami sandwich,  there were glitches with the order with another service vendor who backed out after an hour of placing the order,  but zomato came to the rescue and got my food delivered within 20 mins,  the food was warm and healthy,  didn't find any fried items in the sandwich and the bread was also really good both for sandwich and garlic breads and the salami tasted good too,  the best part is you can really customize the options for your sandwich and burgers,  as an add on i must admit their great customer service,  immediately after the order was delivered i got followed up on the quality of food  which is kind of rare these days.

Had the Thor burger and Wolverine burger along with shepherd's pie and a brownie. Needless to say the burgers were delicious. The meat (and there was lots of it!) was perfectly cooked. The buns were soft and fresh. Cheesy and dripping with mayo. Combination of spices was brilliant.  The quantity is huge. There were two of us and we couldn't finish all of it. Even though i was a lil confused as to what to order as their menu is never ending,  Upal da's suggestions were very helpful. Best place to get value for your money. Had the food home delivered and the service was right on time. For anyone looking for a good, affordable, continental meal,  please please visit Hondo's. Keep it up guys.. BURP!

I and my friend ordrd a Roxette chicken burger with fried egg and a veg sweet corn sandwich large ... I wanted to try the place before smday i cld risk ordrin other special items. i would be very short and crisp the burger was far better than i had expected , absolutely juicy and tasted heavenly , probably one of the best burgers i have tasted so far .. The sandwich was equally good , fresh and tasty. The best part is the price is so reasonable that it dsnt even pinch ur pocket . I wld highly recommend this place as a must try and i am looking forward to more visits soon as luckily its located just in my neighbourhood .. keep up the good work guys ... all the best.

A great joint to satisfy your stomach..! We ordered chicken pongs which was absolutely fantastic..! Loved the flavour... next we had chicken pasta in white sauce... in spite of not being a pasta fan I finished half of the plate.. so doesn't really need to explain why they're 4.5 rater..! And at last we had chicken 1/4.. it tastes really nice inside out.. i loved the crisp of the skin..

Visited this restaurant today.. This small restaurant is located in Lords bakery just opposite to Shree's beauty salon. This restaurant only fits around 20 people, but when we got there we got a seat.. The decor is quite simple, nothing extraordinary but we were really looking forward to the food. As starters we ordered
1) PIG IN THE BLANKET AND
2) JACKET POTATO IN SHREDDED CHICKEN.
Both the preparations were quite unique.. The pig in the blanket was good, but the sausages were salty.. Again, the jacket potato was very different.. It was ok but nothing extraordinary.. As main course we ordered PORK CHOPS. After hearing mixed reviews about this preparation , we thought of giving this a try. Well, it was a complete disappointing.. I have tasted pork chops from a lot of restaurants but this made me upset.. A huge piece of pork chop was served which was 80% fat.. It was so fatty that i had to cut and throw away the fat layers and had the bits of meat. But the brown sauce was tasty. Nevertheless, not quite sure of re-visiting this restaurant but the pig in blanket with fried egg was innovative and can be tasted..

Been here a few times already in a very short span and am looking to double the frequency of going. Yep its that good. The bacon is almost always just right. The ribs, chops, steaks all have an air of European cooking style... It's not your Indianised spiced up versions. So depending on your taste, ur either gonna love what you eat and come back every two months or you're gonna sell your soul every week at this joint. 
The people are very hospitable and know what to suggest. It's a little small and that I find is perfect as it gives a private and cozy touch to the meal. For the prices, it's the best deal anyone can get.

It's a really small place near Dhaka Kaalibari at Prince Anwar Shah Road.
We had ordered Pork Cocktail Sausages, MCB Burger and Pork chop in Brown Sauce with Saut√©ed Vegetable & Mashed Potatoes.
Pork sausage was good.
Pork chop was average. Didn't like the brown sauce.
The MCB Burger was disappointing. The patty was dry and over-cooked. It was nothing but an ordinary buger.
It's student friendly and the food is pretty cheap.
The interior is basic. Staff is well behaved.

I heard about this place From a colleague ¬†and then saw the reviews and photos in Zomato and finally was there on a Sunday evening. Small place, decent menu but I couldn't have pork or lamb for which I opted for this joint at the first place. My bad!!
Only had burgers and Hen in the blanket.
Will sure visit soon to have some pork .

So I ordered food for the 2nd time from Hondos and I can safely say that this time I got the order right. Pork Chops simply blew my mind, a very nice cut of the meat with the right amounts of fat and meat in the delicious gravy made it lovely. Secondly the beef tenderloin though slightly tough was again a hit, special mention for the slight gravies that come with these dishes, goes perfectly with bread or rice accompaniments. Another item which I loved- not much by my fellow diners- was the crispy bacon in honey sauce, the sweet and salt combo seemed perfect for my palate. The breakfast platter was average, with an average ham(pork), average hash brown, and the scrambled eggs seemed more like an anda bhurji and lacked in creaminess, but the platter did come with an excellent guacamole dip. Then the chicken cocktail sausages- I strongly feel sausages should never be chicken, were ordered to please a chicken loving friend - was surprisingly tasty, tossed in a red sauce which had a tang and punch about it. They can definitely improve on the mashed potatoes which can be ordered as sides with the pork/beef dishes, it lacked consistency in its texture - like Bangali barir aloo sedho -and needed some more butter and black pepper to enhance it's flavour, but then again you rarely do come by excellent mashed potatoes. All in all this place is a must visit for pork lovers, I plan to try out their pork ribs and the burger on my next order.

What a wonderful place this is! Cheap continental yet delicious food. Hondo's is arguably God's best creation. 

So today a few friends of mine and I decided to have something light but somehow ended up having a heartful. 

We ordered 1 red sauce pasta, 1 double chezz burger, 1 white sauce pasta and 1 brownie(cause nothing can match that).

The food was brilliant and so was the hospitality. Definately coming back here again!

I visited this tiny joint last month because i had only great things to hear about it and boy oh boy was i right. The burgers are amazing! I went safe (roxette) with my option but it was so yummy. My friend tried the the hell boy and that was great too. I also tried the lemon ice tea and it again it was made nicely. The service was fast and they helped us in choosing and recommending the burgers too. 
Will visit again!

Actually when you try to grab a quick lunch at an affordable price at a decent enough place, this seems like the one....
Ordered a triple omelette with wafers with mushroom & chicken salami add ons....
‚Çπ243 for the fare was not at all bad since it was fantabulous üëåüëåüëå
However what mars the celebration is the scene in front of the joint....not a pretty one....
Folks, as you yourself acknowledged, this is putting your business down, do something about it if possible....
Other than that the service, cleanliness, quality and behaviour was also great....full marks for that....
Finally, all said a 4/5 goes without saying....

A  small place serving good food in dirt cheap price. We ordered Pork in Blanket and Hellboy Burger. The pork dish was very unique and it tasted awesome with all the cheese. The burger came with chips. I personally don't like burgers but this one was worth trying. The place is surely a show stealer in terms of price. There's no added tax. I personally found the place to be a bit congested. They should have a seperate area for managing their orders and deliveries. There were many staffs and delivery people around. Service was fast. Would love to revisit the place.

The place at Anwar shah road is easily located and they serve good food at affordable price. The space is little cramped and the decor can be worked upon. I tried their noodles and immediately became a fan of it. They serve flat spicey noodles which is v.good and unique to taste. Tried their potato wedges and pudding too. Heard from friends they make good burgers nd steaks too..yet to try them..good luck hondos.

Nice food. I liked it. On the first day I ordered a MCB and a Pork cocktail. The Pork coctail was quite yummy. On the second day I ordered a Wolverine, the burger which I felt was bit costly than the quantity. Then I had Bombil fish fry, which was a regular fish fry. Lastly I had Shepherds pie, it was a preparation of pork sausages, smashed potato and with a little bit of cheese with the flavor of oregano. The taste has no unique ness. I was bit disappointed. Still I want to be there again and try some other dishes for a change. Thank you.

It was really not an over the top good experience as we expected. We heard about it so many times so thought of giving it a try. We ordered wolverine burger, hen in the blanket and pork ribs. The burger was huge and delicious but the fried bacons in it had too much salt. Hen in the blanket was good too though it could have been a little more cheesy coz we didint find enough cheese in it. But the pork ribs were disaster. The sauce was tasty but the ribs were not at all succelent or juicy. We had to try too much to tear them apart. It was extremely hard so we had to leave almost 3/4th the dish as it was not at all edible. We had pork before and i personally love pork so i know how soft they can be. But since i was excited for this dish specially so it was very much dissapointing. The prices are okayish according to the quantity and quality.

I have visited hondos couple of times and this time I had the ever feeling pork chops . 
The first time I came with my friends we ordered 6 items and it costed us 1700 rupees and we were in awe . 
So Hondos's is my go to place whenever my pocket is not friendlier to the other places . Jokes apart the food quality is great and the hospitality is homely .  These guys are masters on burger ( check out Thor ) and steaks . When you will taste the pork chops or ribs , you will fill the juicy flesh on your taste buds with mouthwatering oil dripping from the meat . Yum 
Go eat them all

Small joint serving good continental food. Situated just off Dhaka Kalibari, this place has a couple of discounts for students and for happy hours. 
The ambience there is decent and the service very amicable. 
Easy on the pocket and good it's a decent place for a snack or two. 
We ordered two sandwiches and chicken coriander mayo pongs. The pongs were really tasty along with the dip. The sandwiches were the usual. Grilled. Crispy and crunchy. 
Worth a try

Last but not the least, custard with Choco chips.
The dessert was really good.

In short: great hospitality, extremely pocket-friendly, heaven for meat-lovers.
Firstly, being our first dine out at Hondo's, out of such a huge list of meaty delights, it was really hard for my friend & myself to choose a few. We finally chose to order Pig in the Blanket (spicy sausages with cheesy, mashed potato & added egg toppings.. delicious), Pork Chops (2 giant size loins well-cooked and soaked in liquid fat), &, Shepherd's pie with pork (yeyy, I was so happy after ordering so much of pork in a day!). & We were not disappointed at all. I would rather say that food taste & quantity was better than many other over-priced food joints. I really hope that I can get back soon and try out other items and won't stop until I cover all!

Went in and it immediately seemed a bit cramped. Once we got in and found a seat however, it felt quite nice and cozy. We ordered the beef steak, the jacket potato with mushrooms and cheese, fried bacon, garlic bread and the thor burger. It took them around fifteen minutes to serve.
The steak was brilliantly cooked and tasted really good.
The thor burger is huge, and with two beef patties, two layers of cheese, bacon, onion rings and tomatoes, it is a bit too much to eat, especially if you order it after eating the steak.
The jacket potato tasted average.
The fried bacon was a bit less crispy than I usually like.
The garlic bread was a major let down. It lacked flavour, was toasted till it's edges were burnt and it tasted really bad.
Hondo's is a great, pocket friendly American diner apt for anyone looking to grab a quick bite for a very reasonable price.
P.S. The best thing about this place is the behaviour of the people running the establishment.

Went yesterday for dinner and enjoyed the suggested ones on Zomato, namely the Thor Burger and the Tenderloin Staek along with Cheese Pops and A double patty beef burger. The staek was a PROPER medium-rare continental staek. I say this because it is the order of the day to cook a mutton and a pork steak with the same sauce and that speaks volumes about the effort put into making the steak. This was very different with all the essentials like rosemary and thyme and the right balance of flavours, which makes you want to eat two.
Even the Burgers were decent, but we had expected something a bit more filling, judging by the description.
All in all, its quite an experience to have a continental eatery delivering from Prince Anwar Shah Road to as far as Newton.
Here's hoping they do actually go 24/7 very soon. :)

Thor burger was humongous which i always wonder to have a burger of that size. And the tenderness of pork chops you can see the juices flowing. 
And there amazing fried bacon with honey, which was so pleasant. A must try for all the bacon lovers 
Brownie was a bit let down but they can do better. 
Staffs were good. Hope to visit there again and again.

At Hondo's, you are never strangers - when you 'meat'.   Simple yet delicious continental fare - sandwiches, burgers, a little something for the vegetarians and cheeses and dips used creatively.  Their English Breakfast, with the jacket potatoes, rashers of bacon, salami - including chicken and pork cocktail salami, fused with kebab style mini salamis and the triple omelet, scrambled or sunny side ups, would not make you die : they would make you want to live a little longer, just to taste them all.

You will get everything right from Beef, Pork and ofcourse the stupid bird called chicken, they are adding fish & mutton to thier menu very soon. Hondo's undoubtedly serves one of the best Burgers in town. I love thier Jacket potato, Ox -tongue is something to die for. Pork ribs were excellent, juicy perfectly cook. Forgot to add Sandwiches which stands out tall. Simple and classy. 
A place one should always visit.

This little food joint is easy to spot on Prince Anwar Shah Road. Though not much spacious, it can fit maximum 15-18 people at once. Coming to food, we ordered Pig in Blanket and Chicken 1/4th.

Pig in Blanket: This dish was prepared with pork sausages on a bed of mashed potatoes topped with cheese. I really liked it, the sausages were delicious! I would have definitely loved it if the cheese topping would have been more! üòâ

Chicken 1/4th: It was an entire chicken leg piece cooked in herbs and served with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I liked the flavour of the herbs in which the chicken was cooked. 

Probably the cook himself took the orders, he was very friendly! üòä Prices are affordable.

Finally I have found a decent place in Kolkata that serves amazing breakfast platter at a great bargain. I had ordered a breakfast platter from Hindo's and it was delivered very promptly within the specified time. The packing was impeccable and it did not have any spillages. The frankfurters were aptly fried, the hashes were hot and fluffy. The scrambled eggs were made to perfection. The caramelised onions were tasty but not soggy. The dip was mindblowing. I had only one issue, the garlic breads were not crunchy enough, maybe because I opted for order. But, really great food. I recommend this place to breakfast loves.

Dropped in with great expectations specially on food , which didn't meet at all. Ordered four dishes :

HEN ON THE BLANKET : fried chicken suasages placed on more than required thick bed of mashed potato and topped with cheese . Little less of potato and more of cheese and also tossing the sausages in some sauce would take the dish to another level. The sausages very dry , the mash can be improved tastewise and the overall recipe wasnot interesting at all .

BOMBAY DUCK : three pieces of 'lotte maach' deep fried in a tasty batter and served with mayonnaise dip. This one i liked.

PORK CHOP : the dish that took me here all the way from north kolkata. Dissapointed to be honest , the meat wasnot well done at places , brown sauce was oversalty, saute vagetables were not impressive at all.

HELLBOY BURGER : we added extra cheese. It was no way better than a normal burger we get at other places ,bit on dry side and can be made juicier . Nothing worth a recommendation.

Though food was nothing worth praising , the hospitality definitely is. But again serving time was way too much, the first starter took even more than half an hour to arrive . Decor is 3 basic table for six placed in a small white washed room, so don't expect any kind of ambience , just a sit and eat joint.
But again, food needs to improve to match up to the hype hondo's has already created.

This place is one of the most amazing discoveries that I've made in the near past. Located exactly at Dhaka Kali Bari more of Anwar Shah Road, this place was very easy to locate. The restaurant is very small and cozy. At a time a maximum of 12 diners could occupy this place. The decor is basic, and service is prompt. The waiters are very courteous and helpful. The main attraction of this place is the food. We had ordered chicken pasta in white sauce and pork ribs in brown sauce, which came along with the accompaniments of mash and boiled veggies. The pasta was incredibly tasty, so very flavoursome. One of the best I've ever had. The pork was delicious. Juicy, succulent, perfect cut of meat with the right amount of pork fat. The brown sauce prepared with coarsely ground spices gave a wonderful punch. The mash wasn't up to the mark. It barely had any creaminess. The veggies could taste better if saut√©ed instead of boiling. Overall a fantastic experience.

Would have given a 5 if the mash stood out. 4.5 as of now. Would come back soon for some beef steak, ox-tongue sandwich, and of course, pork.

I had the "Hellboy Burger" with double beef patties and extra cheese.
First of all, the service that really fast, and the price is okay according to me.
Now, coming to the taste part, I did love the burger, no doubt about that, the quantity was definitely enough for a single person but the patties were a little dry according to me since I like my burgers greasy.
The only thing that disappointed me was the heat. Though I was looking for a challenge in the burger since it has "Hell" in its name but the heat was not enough for me, it was very mild.
Anyway, all together it was a nice tasty burger.
I will definitely call it a meat lovers place, and will be visiting again soon.

This place was a favourite for its great food at affordable rate. However I was disappointed recently when I went there and ordered one pig in a blanket and one pork chop platter. The pig in a blanket was very okay,nothing excellence. The pork chop platter was disappointing. The pork was good but the herb rice was rotten. Expecting more from you

It's a massive task to be able to pull off good food, good service and good value, all under one roof. There are only a handful of places which manage this and I can proudly say that Hondo's is one of the bunch.

Just walking into the place is comfortable. Big waves of a casual, carefree atmosphere hits you and you learn that this meal will be a good one. The service is genuinely good and honest. The nicest men and women and the brightest smiles. Chefs come and take the orders themselves, a detail which places Hondo's high on the list. There are a total of probably 30 chairs, all in a small little space. They play new age electronic music throughout, which to be honest, isn't the least bit off-putting.

The food is superb. They could give any steakhouse a run for their money. The Wolverine and the Thor burgers are massive, and they taste just as good as they look. The Tenderloin was very well made - medium rare I asked for, and medium rare is what I received. However, I do wish they served their steak sauce in a cup instead of pouring it onto the steak while serving. The mash was good, although there wasn't a whole lot. The veggies were outstanding. I felt a good glass of red wine was lacking, and if Hondo's can get that going, then we've got a real winner.

A mean for 2 won't exceed 850, unless you're ordering massive amounts.

Interior/Ambience: 3/5
Service: 4.5/5
Food: 4/5
Value for Money: 4/5

Thanks for reading and pardon any grammatical errors I may have made.

Quality service with top-notch food quality is what you can be assured of at Hondo's.. Great food and a cosy ambience is an add on. The fact that I gorge on every delicacy I had here choosing a particular dish would actually be quite difficult for me..  Since its all about experimenting trying out as many as you can would be the best option!!!

So ordered from here today. My review will be limited to the one dish ordered and presentation.
Firstly the estimated time of delivery projected is a lot more than natural but luckily the food arrives well before time.
I ordered pork chops. The packaging was well done. It came in a nice bag, with the foils double wrapped so it doesn't spill.

The pork were exceptionally well done. It is cooked in a mild brown garlicky sauce seasoned with ginger. The taste was exceptional and the quantity was way more than what I was expecting. Even for pork chops, there was almost no bone present, which is a huge bonus. It comes with a side of mashed potatoes and veggies. The meat was juicy and succulent and the whole thing was a treat for the taste buds.

Will order again soon from this place.

Edit:
Rating goes down from 4.0 to 3.5
Visited the place for a dine in on 27th May. Now the place doesn't have much of an ambience, and I'd suggest that one get delivery or takeaway from here instead.
Coming to the food, it takes a long time to serve, but as they had mentioned that beforehand, this can be excused.
We ordered Pig in a Blanket which I absolutely loved. One of the best appetisers I've ever had. Pork sausages in a base of creamy mashed potatoes served with cheese on top. Absolutely amazing.
We ordered Pork Ribs, which were not ribs at all. Too many places in the city do not know the difference between ribs and chops, and this place too serve chops instead of ribs. 
We also ordered tenderloin Steak in Spicy Jalape√±o Sauce which turned out to be nothing more than the standard steak with spices Jalape√±os on top. The sauce remained almost unchanged expect for the disappearance of the brown sauce's garlicky flavour. Not a fan.
Quantity wise, both dishes were amazing, taste wise, the tenderloin steak, not so much.

Ordering here quite a few times made me realise that I'd be sticking to burgers, sandwiches and other appetisers here.

This hidden place in prince anwar shah road did please me with their unique flavours..i was not expecting much..but this place had lots to offer me..we ordered jacked potato with mushroom and cheese..the first bite was not that entertaining but as i munched on..the flavour of cheese mixed with baked potato and mushrooms..did taste good..
Hellboy..well this was a great burger i had in weeks..though i wished it to b a tad bit spicy..i was elated to taste the soft juicy pork patty..the cheese and veggies..made it as fresh as ever...dish of the day for me..
Next..the hen in the blanket..this was also a showstealer..the crunchy spicy sausages on a bed of mashed potatoes and cheese baked together was something pretty unique to my taste buds.
Ambience is good...staff are courteous..and the best part is they charge wat u see..

My first taste of hondos was at a friends office nearby where they had ordered beef burger and the taste blew me off. It was all rich content n no fluff food. Since then I had my eyes on this outlet every time I passed that area. Today I made up my mind to visit them n try out the lovely beef burger a second time.. Boy!! They got me again with their astounding taste n no fluff food. This is by far one of the finest places for alternative continental food. I have my eyes set on their Tenderloin BeefSteak and am convinced that theirs would be far more appealing to the taste buds than Mocambo or Oly steaks. Completely easy on the pocket, extraordinary taste and simply a delight to the foodie clan. A must visit for all those who love the alternative style food. A much welcome food joint for the 'hatke's breed.

The restaurant is located near Dhaka kalibari in Prince Anwar shah road.

We ordered : Bombay Duck with Tarter dip,Pig in Blanket,Beef Hell Boy Burger and Chicken Pong with Coriander Mayo.

The first dish we were served with was bombay duck. It was bobile fish coated in a tasty batter and deep fried.The fish inside was amazingly tasty and its actually the fish what we call in general as 'loitya fish '. The dish was served with mayonnaise and we totally loved the dish..
Next came pork sausages.Sausages were served on the bed of mashed potatoes with a hint of cheese on top.The sausages were soft juicy and tasty. We really enjoyed this dish thoroughly!!!
Then we ordered beef burger.Now this was really a tall burger with onion rings,a slice of cheese, a deep fried beef disc,tomato slices,mayonnaise inside two fat bun.This dish was really filling and it tasted good but nothing extraordinary.
Next we orderd chicken Pong.There were 6 deep fried chicken balls altogether and the dish was served with flavoured mayonnaise.Chicken balls were very crunchy and tasty as well and we ordered this as per the recommendation of the man who was attending us.

The interior of this cute little joint is not so decorated. Its just okay. But this becomes very insignificant as the food they serve is really amazing!! And the biggest USP of this small joint is the behavior of the man who was attending us.From the moment when we entered the restaurant till we stepped out,the man treated us very cordially and took care of us.

We really had a great time eating at Hondo's and had a lovely start of our day. 
I would recommend everyone to give Hondo's a try and I'm sure that you'll love the place......

Visited this place at 00:35 hours in the night and we had requested them to keep a table for us. The restaurant was so keen on having us to dine with them for the first time that they were willing to keep it open till late for us. This as per my experience,  is good customer service! 

Apart from the restaurant being conveniently tucked in one corner and easy to find, the food was simply delicious. We ordered the chicken pongs for starters; Beef steak and the Thor Burger for mains. We would definitely be coming back to this place again only because of their good food and great service!

The size of the burgers were so immense that we had to share each as we didnt want to lose appetite for dinner. And the taste was equally awesome. Looking forward to visit this place for a full course meal.

We went there for a Christmas dinner. Firstly, we  really appreciate the reception we got while waiting outside the restaurant for our partners.
 we were a group of 6 and list of order was big. So giving this review based on only those items which i ate.
 1) pig in the blanket- i liked the combination of the sausage and mashed potatoes.
 2) thor burger- as the name indicates it was a really big burger with pork and chicken layers. And i absolutely loved it. Highly recommended.
3) pork chops- It was really the star of the show. The meat was perfectly cooked and the dish was amazing. It is a must try.
4) virgin mojito and 5) brownie with chocolate sauce - these two were equally good.
     The food was good and wallet was happy .
   overall it was a great experience.  Will visit again for sure.

It's a small place with nothing much going on for the ambience. But the food totally compensates for it, and that too at a reasonable price.
Here's what we ordered-
Coke Mojito- A little sweet but nice.
Pigs in a blanket- a layer of well mashed potatoes (yes I'm a fan of a well prepared mash) with cheese, with pork sausages covered on top. The meat was soft and went well with the potato.
Pork chops- as was warned, it took around 20 minutes to prepare, but worth the time. The chops were well cooked and not rubbery (thank God) and totally worth spending some energy cutting through the meat. The jus was well seasoned and the mash and veggies were adequate in terms of taste and quantity. The best dish of the lot.
Chicken MCB Burger- as my friend had previously tasted a chicken burger from here via zomato delivery and had found the patty to be dry, they took the then-poor review seriously and made amends. Good moist chicken patty with salad and sauce covered in a grilled bun made for a good dish. Might I suggest French fries instead of potato chips? Otherwise well enough for 200/-.

The bill came to be 800/- which was a pretty good deal for all the meaty dishes we had. The service staff was cordial and the in-charge very open to suggestions and warm. A good experience without much harm to the pocket. Will recommend.

Went there for a for a christmas lunch. Had the worst restaurant experience of a long time. 

Okay so since Rubi's Grill closed (which was the weekend hangout joint for the gang), I was in search of a good burger place. The newly opened Hondo's seemed to do the trick. Went there only once before last week, that time I opted for a take-away. The guy who served us was very polite and co-operative, and there burgers were good and reasonably priced. However, the recent experience made me swear off from the place. 

So on 25th December we reached there at about 3 pm. We were only two people instead of the usual 6-7, don't know if that's why there was this change in behaviour. The guy from last day was absent, and upon entering we were informed that they were closed because they were preparing for the 'evening rush'. Don't know how much rush there can be for a restaurant which is not even one month old and very few people know about it. Also their working hours are 9 am to 1 am, and not like we went there at 10 am or something. 3 pm is already pretty late and they said it'll be another couple hours before they open. If they cannot maintain their own timings, at least they could update that on zomato. Also, refusing customers to prepare for more customers make no sense. However, it being christmas day and all, we said okay and left.¬†

While we were standing outside and contemplating where to go for our lunch, another group of four people were let in and immediately seated! We were pretty shocked at this point. I went in and asked again that why are these people being served if they were indeed closed. The guy behind the counter turned quite rude (he seemed flabbergasted that we even dared to raise such questions) and said that they had made reservations earlier. When we asked that if we had made reservations earlier would we be served too, in that case we can reserve now and come back in half an hour; he said that they had some 'technical difficulties' and they did not have the raw ingredients to serve us. While right in front of us they had enough ingredients apparently to serve four other people. And in the whole conversation he had the audacity to not apologize to us even once about the whole ordeal.¬†

It is a long distance from north calcutta to anwar shah and we ventured there just because I liked the burgers the last time. However, only good food amounts to nothing where you handle customer relations so poorly. If you're that rude and egotistic, you're in the wrong line of business. So congrats on losing quite a few loyal customers; never setting foot there ever again.

Horrid food even worse delivery experience.  Delivery guy was rude,  couldn't find my place inspite of proper directions and when we ourselves called to direct him he rudely said we're confusing him.  He even dropped one of the fresh lime sodas we had ordered 


Coming to the food:-

1) Beef tenderloin steak : I'd be hard pressed to call it a steak.  It's a hunk of misshapen out of proportion meat Grossly over cooked.  It bent my forks and steak knifes.  
2)  Pork chops : pork ribs with barely any meat on the bone served with a bland tasteless mash. 
3) the fresh lime soda is barely drinkable. 

Will never order again

Ordered for their quarter roast chicken w veggies, mashed potatoes and herbed rice today
The chicken had a lovely rosemary brown sauce base to it but the sad part was the chicken was RAW and the mashed potatoes tasted like there was Grease added to it.. nothing very special about the veggies as they were just boiled uglily sprinkled w pepper and the 'herbed Rice" which just had peas and pepper in it also tasted like shit.. I feel extremely disappointed after receiving raw chicken after waiting for more than a hour for it.. also not very kind on y'alls part to send someone such bad quality food at so late when they hardly have any other option !!!

Never go by first impressions. This is what I learnt.


While this quaintly food outlet at Prince Anwar Shah seemed promising at first, it suffers from the same problems that any upstart restaurant has. I have ordered food from this place via Zomato and also directly. The latter option was suggested by the restaurant delivery people to apparently ensure "better customer experience". ITS NOT! Let me illustrate. 

They had a different menu which was revamped and burgers and some other stuff was added or revised. Food quality is okay, but not at par with top notch American style restaurants like TGIF or Chili's. They are on days similar to Steak Factory quality, if you know what I mean. The only reason you may end up ordering steaks or burgers from here because Mocambo (steaks) is in Park Street. TGIF is too costly. So is Chili's. 

The food setting space is small but that's not a problem if a few friends go there to have food. They usually get late night office crowd.

The staff behavior is okay.

The problem that I want to talk about is different. They will insist that you directly place orders with them on WhatsApp or phone call, bypassing Zomato. The moment you remove Zomato, you lose both online ordering and punctual service delivery. When orders come directly, they are open to wallets like Paytm and Airtel money etc.

On Dec 16, it was not before 1 hour that their guy finally came up with how much I have to pay via Paytm. This was on WhatsApp. I asked them whether they are taking normal orders at 11 pm and the potential bill amount was finallg told to me at 1158 pm. Their response: we told you it will take time. That's it? Maybe they were casual because the bill amount was just Rs 376.25. 

I guess the primary reason why they insist on removing Zomato from an order is because they gain monetarily while dealing with customers directly. There is nothing wrong with that, but build your customer service capabilities. Right now they don't have it. They are not qualified technically or resource wise  to deal with customers when there is a rush.

Just one hour waiting time to know a bill amount is unheard of, even for somebody like me. 

Small restaurants, who want to become big, only focus on customers. That's how they grow big. Bringing people on WhatsApp and then making them wait for an hour is not professional. 

Say no to customers if you can't service orders or attend to them on time. 

But don't make us wait so long.

I will not order at this place without Zomato. If you order food directly, do so at your own peril.

Must say I tried their burger and the sandwich also and, they serve in authentic Indianised way. I am grateful to the owner himself as, he himself came to deliver the order that I placed in the middle of the night and shared a good gesture along. Very much welcoming. Looking forward to try all their dishes ahead. If someone is craving to have good nick nacks one should try this place. On time delivery is one of the remarkable identity I should say. Above all, the gesture matters which I do believe brings half of the taste in the food. Cheers to Hondos..üòä

However next I will surely try chicken pongs with coriander mayo, as it is something that suits my taste. Love and keep up with the mouthwatering servings.

If you want some good quality burgers, you should definitely hit this place. 


Located near Dhaka kalibari (it falls towards your right on the way to Anwarsha crossing) 


The place is a little small, but the food they serve is absolutely lip smacking, with some quality service. 


We ordered beef burger and pork burger 

And both were equally good. The patty was juicy, and melts immediately inside you mouth revealing all its unique flavours. 

And they serve it with chips. 


For dessert we ordered brownie. It's was good. 


Definitely coming back to this place for more BURGERS.

This is a first time that ever happened to me that when I wrote something in the comments was actually read by a restaurant. I always write to avoid oily stuff while ordering online and never before did I see any restaurant even noticing it. These guys not only read it, but they called to tell me that their dips contain ¬†cheese and mayo and they are providing the dips separately so that I may not use those if I wish. They also assured me that the actual food is barred of any cheese or mayo.
When they asked for the delivery directions, I gave them the directions once and also told them hat my house is marked on Google Maps. After that, no further questions or calls and the delivery guy was bang at my door. These gestures are too good to be true and I hope these don't fade with time.
As I come to the food, they marked dips and there was double layer packing!!!
The food was good for sure, lovely so much that I ended up finishing the coriander dip too ;-)
The behavior, the concern and the carefulness tops it all!!! All the best guys!!!

A great place which offers heartfelt foods within budget. The approach of this joint is to serve American fast food and they know what they doing. The beef steak was good.

This is a cute little place, which I wish I had found earlier.

I mean, the food is fantastic. I haven't been here that often. 5 times maybe. Had the Chicken Pasta. Both Red and White one. Both on point in terms of flavor, and quantity.

Then there are the burgers. I visited in November. They had a special offer thing going on. Buy one, get one free. Had the BLT burger. Bacon. Lettuce. Tomato. Was good. Suits different taste. Then there was the chicken burger. Loved it. Delightful presentation.

Ambience is nice. Homely. And so is the service. Very helpful. And friendly. WiFi, check.

Tag along with your friends. I'm sure this place won't disappoint you. :)

***Edit***Bumping up the ratings on account of their very consistent and delicious offerings. Have eaten from here multiple times and they maintain prime quality and taste. Much Kudos.***********Hondo's falls on your right if you're heading towards Anwar Shaw crossing starting from South City Mall, in about 800 meters. Easy accessibility & recognizability is a key head start for any eatery.

Hondo's should capitalize on that & should now really focus on making their interior & their sitting arrangements just a little more eye catching. I believe the place is really doing very very good when it comes to their food & they need to take care of this tiny bit of disarray to rope in more sit-in customers.

We had ordered Potato Wedges & Pigs in a Blanket after taking our seat. The wedges were crunchy & lightly ( and rightly ) spiced. And the Pigs (Hungarian Sausages covered in cheese & baked on a bed of mash) were delightfully nice. The seasoning in the mash deserves a mention. It brought out the wonderful flavor in d sausages when had together.

Next we ordered the Hellboy burger & a portion of Pork Ribs. These orders took just a tiny bit of time but the food made up for everything & more. The burger was really the hero of the night. The beef patty was just perfect. Perfectly juicy, perfectly spiced. It is one of the best burgers I have had in Kolkata. A 10/10 & highly recommended. In the Ribs dish, two handsome pieces of Pork were served in a sauce spiced with herbs ( I think I spotted rose mary ). This was also a very tasty serve but I personally would like to suggest two things: 1) The pork pieces were just a tiny bit fattier than what I like. 2) The brown sauce could be made a little bit thicker & could add in a little more kick.

Overall, all of this cost around 650 INR; which for the quality & quantity of the food they serve; is absolute value for money. Hondo's triumphs when it comes to the food. Also a major plus point is here you can talk to the people in charge of cooking & you can tell them what & how you like and they listen to you. That is such a must have but rare quality for a place to have these days. There are a few room for improvements on the whole, but again, the food they serve absolutely steals the show.

Looking forward to many more visits & happy tummy experiences. Keep being awesome.

Neatness personified as far as appearance is concerned except the hand writing. Almost packs enough punch for a burger named Thor. The patties could be kept a little more juicy rather than crispy and some more sauce inside the burger would make each mouthful better. The bun is probably nicer than the buns served in burgers in some of the star rated hotels. Bacon quality is pretty good. But the shocker for a burger that is otherwise almost top quality is that measly wafer chips are served instead of French fries. Ordered wedges and 2 plates didn't seem enough. At this cost a burger at Chilli's would be cheaper and more wholesome but the burgers at Hondos are much better and am sure will improve in time. Hope this finally becomes that one top burger store that this city is missing.  Would have been a 4.5  rating but -1 for the no fries with every burger(-0.75)/patty crispness/less sauce. Look forward to many more meatier times.

This is a place which is just a couple of minutes walk from my pad. It's pretty neat and cozy and the staff are very polite. But the real knockout is the food be it nibbles like the pongs, sausages, jacket potatoes or the sandwiches it's yum and very pocket friendly. The burgers are juicy and flavourful but the best deal is their tenderloin steak, it's a monster and probably one of the best in Kolkata. Keep up the good work guys and I am always gonna swear by your food.

A small joint with a surprisingly varied menu, and extended working hours, till 1AM. The focus is on meat and their steak is excellent at the price point, perfectly done with huge portion size. The host has a casual at-ease approach and is frank about the joint's aim and restrictions.

This place bought the new meaning to beef steak.. I am an avid lover of stakes and I have ordered and dined in almost every restaurant in kolkata in search of best steaks .. finally I found it . The medium rare beef tenderloin steak was just amazing. Perfectly done with sealing all the juices inside and in reasonable prices.. this restaurant is highly recommended for the all steak lovers of kolkata.. I will be updating my review after dinning in there pretty soon ..

So finally I dined in their nice and little diner next to dakha Kali Bari more in Prince anwar Shaw road .. They kept the theme minimal and simple . there is not gimmick or show-off in Hondo's . they provide a nice and clean environment with a friendly touch ..

Food - this time I ordered their newly launched burger line - the "Thor" burger and I am told that I am the officially first person to eat that particular Burger.. The burger was nice and juicy with good proportions of everything needed but a bit salty to my taste but the owner promised to take care of it .. 
The next thing I ordered was pork ribs and let me tell you it's pure bliss .. I have dined in various restaurant ranging from Street ones to couple of thousand buck for pork ribs but trust me no  one , I repeat no one could do the ribs that good within that price bracket .. It was perfectly mix of fat and meat with tender and juicy inside .. I highly recommend their roast menu .. Especially the beef tenderloin steak and the pork ribs .. It has quickly become the restaurant for my weekend stake cravings..

PS - the owner of the restaurant keeps ad friendly and person touch with you . you'll fill as if you're dining in your friend's house

Home delivery on a Friday afternoon. Expectations were obviously low. Since I had a carb craving and no one at home to stop me , I went ahead and ordered a BLT burger with the works. Incredible... They don't skimp on the bacon, the bun was fresh... Very satisfactory to summarise.

I was quite impressed by the menue and so got some roasted pork ribbs delivered. The roast itself was nice but the mashed potatoes and vegetables were not the best and there was way too much black pepper in everything, so much that it overpowered all other flavours and tastes. I hope it was a one time thing and if I order again I hope the food will be better.

Was feeling hungry like anything and suddenly saw Hondo's. Small cosy place with seating for 20 people. After going through the Menu selected Hondo's Sandwich Large size with Shredded Chicken as choice of meat. Once the sandwich arrived the portion size astonished me. It is big and quite heavy for one person. The shredded chicken was fresh and very tasty. The most interesting part was the size and thickness of the Bread which the Manager said is specially customized. Liked the overall ambience and presentation. Will come back some other day to try the other dishes since today km full :)

A tiny eatery with a few tables and a very warm staff. They offer some good stuff at a very reasonable rate. The owner himself recommends you as per your preference. We finally settled with a Hondo's mogambo sandwich and shepherds pie. 

Hondo's mogambo sandwich : Yummy! I won't be able to say what exactly was in it because too many layers. I could see and taste egg, mashed potatoes , mayo and two layers of chicken. It was very filling and tasteful. It's served potato wafers . I felt the lack of a dip . I think they should have a mayo based and another spicy dip to go with it .


Shepherds pie : this is one of my favorites of all time. Minced meat covered with mashed potato baked and topped with grated cheese. To my surprise they used pieces of sausages as a substitute to the mince. That spoilt the whole essence of it . The sausage also happend to be a little stiff. I'd recommend keeping an option of using mince or sausage. I'd say it spoilt classic dish , not very pleased . 

Value for money: 5/5
Presentation:2/5
Ambiance:3/5
Food:3/5
Management and service: 5/5 

Happy eating!

** MY 600th REVIEW **
This review is very special to me again but couldn't celebrate it with my foodie friends due to our personal busy schedule. Hence, came along with dad here few days back and the experience was fantastic, I must say.
Hondo's is a very small eating joint located inside the garage of a house in Prince Anwar Shah Road for sitting arrangements of about 25 people. They used to run a delivery service earlier which they still have. Service was very good, so was the food. This place is definitely recommended. We had -
Ox Tongue - This was a complimentary dish for free sampling. The taste is good but has a very unusual smell underneath. We had it plain but I think this won't make an issue in sandwiches or other things.
Chicken Pongs - A very unique dish. Shredded chicken balls served with an add on coriander mayo. It tasted great.
Jacket Potato with Roasted Bacon - This was a hit. I have had this earlier with cheese only. Here it was with loaded cheese and bacon. The cheese melting inside the mouth with the jacket potato and roasted bacon tasted so nice. Sheer bliss I must say!
Open Face Toast with Ham - This dish was good. Lived the combination. Ham slices on top of one side of a sub dressed with mustard sauce and tomato ketchup. Tasted good.
Pork Ribs - One of the best ribs I had in a while with the Classic Brown Sauce. Served with mashed potato and veggies, it was very good. Portion is huge. If you're eating alone, this should be enough to fill you up.
Classic English Pudding - We were kind of amazed that it was not the usual pudding we have in other places. Rather the classic one, famous during Christmas at traditional shops. It was served with honey and loved it.
Drinks - Virgin Mojito and Cola Mojito are what we had. There were several complaints about the granular sugar in the drinks in Zomato reviews and elsewhere. Mentioning of that, they took care of it and the drinks were pretty well.
I would say this place is definitely recommended. It's good and it's cheap. Eating so many things couldn't make us cross the bill amount above 1000INR.
Brownie points for they remain open or take their last orders upto 1am at night. Shout out to all the hostelites and other night owls, do pay a visit or make sure that your mid night hunger pangs are resolved as they make home delivery also. Recommended totally. Happy Dining! :)

I came here last Saturday for lunch randomly.I have eyed this place for few days.Ordered a jacket potato with bacon in it and a plate of pork chop.

‚Ä¢Jacket potato with bacon- 2 jacket potatoes came with filling of cheese and bacon in it.I loved it to the fullest! The seasoning was spot on.The potatoes were soft and who can hate a filling of cheese and bacons? Quality of bacons used was good and they were perfectly crispy.

‚Ä¢Pork chops-It was a winner dish for me! A big portion of grilled pork meat was given with a single bone in it with sides of mashed potato and veggies.The ratio of meat to pork fat was perfect.It was cooked in classic brown sauce.The meat was very tender with nice crackle on the exterior.They didn't ignore the other components in the side of meat.Mash was silky smooth and seasoned well.Even the veggies compromising of carrots,beans and sweet corns tasted so good.I loved the fact that the took extensive care of all the components of this dish to be delicious..not only the meat.I was too full after the meal.

The owner is a friendly guy.He makes u feel at home.Hondo's stay open till 1am and it's really useful for people who works late in that area.They are planning to go 24/7 soon.They are also starting more varieties of burgers in few days and showed me the new menu that's going to be launched.I am really looking forward to tasting them all!

Warning:The only con of the place is the small size and lack of washroom.There's a pay and use toilet just opposite to it though.

Food was served a bit late to me that day because they were low on manpower.Also they prepare their pork chops freshly instead of reheating pre-made food.But its worth the wait believe me!

Come for pocket friendly continental food and a friendly environment.Foodies won't be disappointed here with minor issues as long as their tastebuds are satisfied! üòäüòÄ

this is possibly one of the few places where the food looks as good as the pictures on the internet! we are a long-time fan of the BLT and bacon fries. a little extra crispiness adds to the bacon adds a new meaning to the entire evening. event their brownies are great. not too gooey, not too sweet. just the right amount of crunch outside, with the slight bitterness of cocoa inside. :)but hey, we would definitely love some coffee to keep us awake after an elaborate meal. doing a great job guys, cheers!

this is an epilogue to the previous review. Hondo's has made some recent changes in their menu and it's absolutely delightful. the molten fantasy is dessert section is a must-have after the bacon-wrapped chicken!! these two are the crowning jewels of Hondo's new menu atm.¬†

Hondo's, you have proven it's always possible to improve and achieve something bigger even when people tell you, you are perfect. thanks for the amazing food!

Had ordered for chicken pops with dip which was amazing, these people use minced meat for the pongs which makes it more new.
Jacket potatoes were ordered too but it was not very much up to the mark as the pepper seasoning went more, though no doubt the filling was in good quantity.
Also, had ordered for scrambled eggs and cheese sandwich where the sandwich was very much complimenting to its name, but i felt a little less of salt in the filling.
The aam panna was very much going hand in hand with what was ordered. overall pleased with the service and food, but yes there are rooms for improvisation

Have visited the place, cosy comforting ambience. The employees are great , greeting always with a smile. The head chef came to ask for feedback personally , which as per my experience in this city and even outside, was the first time and I am highly impressed. A must have in life !

Judging by the menu, it seemed quite a delight for meat lovers. Ordered in for the first time from this one on a Sunday morning. French Toast with meat envelope and Beef Collar grilled sandwich with egg and cheese as add ons. It was worth the money but the delivery was late. When I called them up they said they were swamped with orders.Nevertheless, the taste was decent and the meal was quite filling for a Sunday brunch! Would definitely love to visit the next time.

We visited this place after coming across the lip-smacking photos of the dishes on the restaurant's Facebook page. Our order comprised fried bacon, beef tenderloin steak, Shepherd's pie, and cola mojitos. The bacon was a little too salted for my taste and the pie was just okay enough. However, the beef steak was quite good; the meat was tender and seasoned well.¬†
The service can be a lot better though. We had to wait close to 45 minutes for our order to appear. All in all, this eatery has the potential to be a well frequented place, with time.

My colleagues had visited this place and recommended it a lot so I dropped by last Saturday to eat. A very small outlet near the dhaka kalibari stoppage in prince anwarshah road. 
Ordered 2 cola mojitos and 1 virgin mojitos. They are overloaded with sugar and they are not even dissolved properly which makes it very annoying.
The cheese and chicken poppers were good and the accompanying dips were good as well.
The chicken burger was good but the buns were a bit dry. My colleague had suggested the jacket potatoes with ox tongue. God knows why I listened to him. It was horrible. It had this very bad pungent smell and I hated the taste. Although the chef came later and explained why the taste was like it but still be very brave if you want to have it. The pork ribs with rice, fries and veges on the sides was the best item. Loved the sticky gravy the ribs were cooked in. and that is why I am giving 3 and not less. Service was good but very slow. A lot of time is taken to serve the food. I hope that can be lessened a bit.
All the best to the management.

After a late night movie at Inox, South City, two of us were hungry beyond measure, and were about to call Don Giovanni's once we get back home. Just then, while coming down along Prince Anwar Shah Road, we found Hondo's still open. And walked in. This place is a venture of an acquaintance I have known over social media since a number of years, and we found his lovely family at the restaurant, and got introduced to all. The restaurant is small-ish with a handful of sitting space, but with the response that Hondo's is getting, I am sure it will be time for expansion soon. Then it was time for some lip smacking food. We ordered the Protein Platter, Chicken Roast Platter, Non Veg Special Pizza, Fried Bacon and Virgin Mojitos, yes we were that hungry! Loved the food. The Protein Platter with choice of egg and sausages was an instant hit, so was the Roasted Chicken. We had a completely satisfying meal, along with a wonderful conversation with Upal and his family. We walked out around 1 am., our tummies full and hearts filled with warmth. Wish Upal all the very best for this amazing venture, and looking forward to my next visit to this lovely joint.

The beef platter was sumptuous , meat slices being succulent. Mojito was really delicious and the same goes for the brownie. Pretty pocket friendly and the guy who owns this place ( Mr. Swarnaditya ) always puts on a smile every time u ask him any doubts. Surely another visit is due in the pujas

You won't mind waiting since the cuisine, with its presentation and taste, is worth the wait. I have tasted quite a few items, but the chicken roast needs a special mention. Its lip smacking and simply awesome. Not to be missed. I have already tried and tasted Open toast(with pork), shakshouka, shepherd's pie(chicken), brownie, jumbo non veg sandwich, French fries, pork ribs, cheese pongs etc. in my few visits. 
Needless to mention, the staffs are friendly and polite.
Special mention to the complementary paan masala. It's nice and unique.
Great location, ample parking space on the lanes behind the store and presently my favourite joint :)

This restaurant was earlier a takeaway service only, and when they disappeared me and my friends were really very sad. So imagine the surprise one day to find a post from them on Facebook (I liked their page back in 2013) that they're reopening. 
So at the first opportunity my and a beef loving friend if mine headed out to try the beef burger. It was amazing, and the portion was beefy enough to stop two voracious carnivores from ordering anything further, so we settled for some Virgin Mojitos which were also very good.
Will surely return to to try out the protein platter very soon and here's hoping they don't disappear again. Kolkata's food landscape needs a place like this, where inexpensive awesome food is more important than decor though I must mention that the simple clean arrangement does highlight food very good.

I loved this place. Great food with lovely ambience to compliment the same. The French toast envelope with mushroom was amazing, so was the chicken burger and the pasta. Brownie with Ice cream was delicious. What I liked the most about the place is the quick service and affordable prices. Highly recommended if you're looking for good food and don't have much time in hand.

Though appears to be a small snack corner, the place has in store big surprises for all. They will surprise u with some Lip smacking contienental cuisine. The beef tenderloin steak and lamb chops are worth dieing for. To top it all with the all time favourite fried bacon. Its really gonna stir ur taste buds and make u want fr more.

So glad Hondo's reopened again. I used to love their burger, now they are back again with a bang. Guys if you love continental food then this is the place to be. Its commendable that they serve such good quality food & that too continental at such prices. Total value for money. The food tastes too good. Please try out the BLT burger, Steaks, Shepard Pie. They also serve English Breakfast which is hard to find in Kolkata. What i love about the place is the ambience & the warmth n love they pay to the customers. The presentation of the palates are just amazing, its not just that it tastes good it looks great too. If you're in South Kolkata during puja's, which I'm sure you would be dont miss out on Hondo's. Trust me you will love it.  I highly recommend it.

I am so glad Hondo's came back with a bang. I had been and can now remain a fan of their bacon jacket potatos. The shepherd's pie is the ultimate comfort food when you are tired and in no mood to cook. To be honest I havent yet tried their new arrivals as I just had to bite into my favourites first. But it wont be too long till I try them all out. üòä Its the perfect laid back foodies paradise.

Today's newspaper had a menu informing us of the relaunch of this old favourite which was earlier only a take-away based out of their home in Golf Green. We decided to go to the new outlet for dinner spurred by the promise of the reworked menu.
OK now I'm sure I have no right to tell anybody how to run a restaurant as per their format but I found the plaque saying "Fixed Price", and the printout (as well as the proprietor telling us) of their policy of paying upon ordering, much like a Caf√© or a quick-service restaurant, quite odd. I honestly don't see the sense of this practice especially when they offer home delivery in addition to being a full-service restaurant.  Nevertheless it was done in a polite manner and so it was not a deal breaker.
We decided to try the Shakshouka poached Eggs to start with. This was a new dish for us and I must say we found it moreish and enjoyed it thoroughly.
Our mains were however a letdown. I was told that my Shepherd's Pie which I had ordered with Pork would be made with Ox-Tongue which I personally relish and so agreed with the proprietor's call. However judging by distinctive strong and sweet smell of what was finally served I believe there was generous use of Hungarian Sausage. Again I was not put off by this fact as I love the said sausage. My only real concern was the portion size was pretty small. The second main was the Tenderloin steak (ordered rare) which came much later than the first one. And this was after reducing the standard add-ons from rice/bread+mash potatoes+veggies to just veggies. We wish the steak had been juicy and melted in the mouth but instead it was stringy, tough and had gone grey. Further the portion was also again quite small although the veggies were quite a lot.
Overall I think they need to seriously look at firstly their ability to turn out food fast (we were the only ones being served today and it took nearly an hour for the final main to reach the table), secondly their portion size and finally and most importantly delivering on taste.
Two last suggestions - firstly, the background music - Indian classical, and secondly, the "paan"  offered at the end of the meal, while we filled out a feedback sheet, seem a bit opposed to cuisine being served.
Fully appreciated the service of the staff though.
