My must go place whenever i am in south kolkata. A small hole in the wall of a place, serving best of bengali savory items like fish fries etc. Their prices fluctuate since they buy their produce fresh! And its actual bhetki and no basa!! I have been going to this place since childhood!

I decided to try this takeaway food joint - Apanjan as I came to know of its popularity for its Anglo-Indian snacks from various YouTube videos and blog and as well as from Zomato's hidden gems collection. The reviews too were very much assuring for this tiny food joint. And yes they are right it is the Mitra Cafe of South Calcutta.
I ordered some of its items via swiggy and before I even opened the packets the mouthwatering essence started escaping from the wraps.
So finally after opening the packet I couldn't resist and started munching on them and was unable to take proper photos(as you can see I have taken few bites already)
Fish Chips(5/5) : Crispy fish coated in breadcrumbs with stuffed coriander ginger garlic paste and some herbs. Quite delicious. Dip it in the kasundi and have it.
Fish Kabiraji(4.5/5) : Fish fry coated in egg white mixture and blended with nice aromatic spices. Accompany with chilli tomato ketchup and kasundi.

Point to be noted is the fish used is mainly bhetki fish . So pure quality and fresh ingredients. I am a fish lover specially fish fries, cutlet and chops so this place gets bonus points for that.

Mutton Kabiraji(2/5) : This is a let down considering Apanjan's standard specially their other Kabirajis. Not as nice as the mutton was not soft and not delectable. The spices and aroma was not complimenting that much. So a let down for me.
But again Mutton Breast Cutlet is their top seller in mutton dishes which was sold out. Mutton Samosa too got sold out. So choice was to either try Mutton Kabiraji or Mutton Keema Cutlet. It seems the later would have been a better choice as per other reviews.

I need to try their Chicken Lal Fry, Chicken Foul Cutlet, Fish Finger, Fish Fry, Mutton Samosa, Mutton Breast Cutlet, Mutton Keema Cutlet as they are their best sellers too.

We have ordered it's signature mutton breast cutlet, chicken fowl cutlet, fish kabiraji, chicken lal fry and chicken dim sum roll through swiggy. The two cutlets were very good with good amount of meat. The kabiraji was smaller to my liking. The fry was good but too much bone in it. But the roll was utterly worthless. Overall my advice is stick to the cutlets..

This was in wishlist from long, long, long back. Heard a lot about it. Always I had a thought, why so much popularity this shop has. They do not provide you the modern dining, they even do not provide the eye catching outlet, they even do not give any big advertisement.

But as you know, the biggest advertisement is the world is the word of mouth advertising. And this one is an example of that.

Location:
___________

Well I actually was not to this outlet. Lucky me, I got their stall in AHARE BANGLA MELA 2017.

Food:
________

✓ Fish Kabiraji : undoubtedly the best kabiraji I have ever had. It was just less oily. And the taste was just mesmorizing.(110 INR)

✓ Chicken Kabiraji: another wow. I would say they are just in best in kabiraji. But yes to me Fish Kabiraji was more tastey. (60 INR)

✓ Egg Devil : I had never thought egg devil can be so tastey. Just owssum.(50 INR)

✓ Chicken Dim Sum Roll - owsum one. The Chicken stuff in the roll was excellent.(40 INR)

✓ Chicken Lal Fry - chicken leg coated in red coating. Tasted superb.(70 INR)

Each item I tasted was just mouth watering. Loved it. "Televaja" can not be better than this.

Will love to visit their outlet.

And till my next food encounter, happy fooding.

Apanjan is pretty much the Mitra Cafe of South Kolkata. An out and out favourite, I had their famous Chicken Lal fry priced @60 and Fish Fry @110 at Ahare Bangla this week. The chicken leg was deep fried with bread crumb and tasted amazing. The fish fry had some solid stuffing and the rates therefore are totally worth in every way. I was full after tasting a number of dishes in the festival and yet wanted to try much of their offerings. Next time at Kalighat, don't forget to try this gem out.

One of the oldest food joints in Kolkata. Certainly one of my favourites. Apanjan has its own class when it comes down to authentic fish fries. I can't get enough of Apanjan every time I visit this gem of a place. Apart from the humongous fish fry, Lal chicken fry is one of my favourites at this place. Excellent value for money.

An iconic fast food corner of South Calcutta, apanjan near Kalighat serves as Mitra cafe of the South. People swear by the fish fry of this place. A must have dish for any foodie in Calcutta. It's as popular as the kabiraji of Mitra cafe. Other than this, the cutlets, kabiraji and fish are to die for. I had the privilege of tasting their mutton breast cutlet, and fish chops. 4 pieces of soft crunchy fish chops at 100INR is heaven. The mutton breast cutlet is equally good and comes at a price of 110INR. If you love fish fry then head to this place.

Food- 4.5/5 ( The freshest and best fish fries and Kabiraji you ever get)
Ambience - NA ( Roadside eatery, moreover who cares when you get the delicacies)
Price- 3.5/5 ( Bit high even considering the excellent food served)
Hygiene- 4/5 ( Even considering roadside eatery have maintained well)
Service- 4/5 ( Even with maddening crowd and each customized orders dispatch food quite fast)

Name fish fry and only name that comes reckoning first if you are in Kolkata is this place called Apanjan.

They have wonderful varieties of all kind of fries in both chicken and fish varieties. Each of which comes generally in 3 sizes and obviously the prices are also different. But if you are headed here the first thing you should have is the "Fish Fry" and the "Chicken Kabiraji". The the latter one is a well marinated piece of chicken dipped into it egg white and powdered biscuit, deep fried nd served along with a mustard sauce which we call in Bengali as kasundi.

"Fish Kabiraji" is also very nice but I like the chicken variety more.

There are many other varieties of "Chops" which are basically the quintessential Bengali evening snacks of anything mashed dipped into a batter. of Besan and then deep fried. But something which stands out is fish kabiraji, chicken kabiraji, fish fry and fish cutlet.

Word of caution they prefer only cash. They may take some online mode based on a minimum amount which keeps changing from time to time. You go there after 7 pm and you must be very lucky if you get anything good available that time. The best thing about this place is that the raw material used is the freshest and the best in quality. That is why you will find the price of the items that this sell is almost three to four times of what they serve in other places.
There is no complaint on the quality, however be careful of how much you didn't do as too much of it can surely cause your health and stomach upset.

Apanjan is one of the oldest and legendary snacks joint in Kalighat Area, the are famous for their Fish Items like Fish Fry and Fish Finger.

It is located at the Sadanada road 2 mins walking distance from Tapan Theater.

They offered variety of fish items (mainly deep fried) and chicken items, I tried Fish Chips which is not like fish and chips. Its full of fish wrapped in some herb and crisp coating shape like a potato chips, very tasty.

If you're a Fish lover and not very health conscious then please go and try them out.

A couple of minutes from Tapan theatre, this roadside stall has acquired legendary status because of their out of the world fish fries. Yes, they serve the best fish fries in town hands down and I have never tasted anything like it anywhere, not even in upbeat fancy restaurants. All said and done, they are pretty expensive if you consider it to be just a roadside joint. They sell a variety of dishes. The fowl cutlet is good and so is the dry chilly chicken. Service is super fast and you can either stand on the pavement and eat or take home and enjoy their delicious fare. If you are in Kolkata and you like fish fries, you just cannot under any circumstances miss this place.

Pit Stop!

We all have crave for different varieties of street food, whether it's unalike fries or fuchka. It ain't matter how much quality of food we avail from renowned eateries, but emotion always hankers after these less known eateries. Well, I don't believe they can be called as less known eatery stops, cause they are indeed famous and antique to the facts and to our heart. 

Therefore, visited Apanjan with pals and decreed for Chicken Kabiraji and Egg chop. And trust me their delicacies indeed proved why are they famous for. Both of them were mouth watering and heavy to dissolve in tummy. Just cherished every bite of it.

I would suggest you guys to pay visit to it.

Thanks for reading. Follow me on Instagram/ Zomato @ Supratik Chakravarty or on chakravarty8supratik.wordpress.com

Heard a lot about this place. So wanted to give it a try this time. But my experience was not that great. Tried different items like chicken kabiraji,fish chop, mutton keema cutlet and few other things. Everything was too much oily for me and nothing outstanding on taste also.
May be when I visit Kolkata again wld give a try once more.

This place was the best hole-in-the-wall food of Kalighat!Though I struggled to find it initially because the location on Google is not where it really is (it's on right side BEFORE Hazelnut cafe). I was very impressed with everything I ate: fish fry + potato wedge, mutton samosa, chicken pakora, fish kabiraji (misspelled by me). It was all super tasty, quick, and cheap! I loved it

It's located near Kalighat temple. It's an old street fast- food shop. It's popular for specially their fish fry and fish fingers.
I atlast have tried their fish fry and chicken balls recently. The fish fry had an amazing taste , stuffed with pure vetki fish. This item is available in different sizes too.
Next was the meat balls. It is enough for your appetite obviously. It's full of boneless chicken with a fried outer coat surrounding the inner chicken layer.
Satisfied totally. Too good!!

A very tiny shop near the S.P. Mukherjee Rd. Though the shop is a small one you can not miss this one because of the crowd that wait outside during their opening hours. No need to add anything about their quality, they serve the best fish fry and fish kabiraji in South Kolkata. Visit Apanjan, you will love them.

Apanjan is one of those many shops in Kolkata where people cannot enter the shop. They interact with shopkeeper / salesman (who is located inside the shop) while standing on the footpath. A glass counter has rows of unfried chops, cutlets etc displayed. As u place the order, the shop guy picks it up from the counter, fries & serves it.  The frontage of the shop is so less that the menu card is displayed on the pillar.

Bengali cuisine of today has many British influences like batter fried fish, orly, chops, cutlets, fries , kabiraji, dimer devil etc. By the way, Kabiraji is the Bengalification of the English word ‘Coverage’ since the fish / chicken is deep fried after covering it with whipped egg. ‘Dimer Devil’ is the Bengali version of ‘Devilled Egg.’ It is called ‘Devilled’ coz the original yolk of the egg is replaced by minced meat / potato filling. Apart from the Anglo Bengali food described above, they also serve Bengali snacks like Radha Ballavi etc.

First, I tried the Fish Cutlet – It had a thick layer of solid betki fish, a mild spicy coating & crumb fried. The external crumb layer was thin & that helped in enhancing the taste of fish. The next order was Fish Chop. The fish chop was a ‘fish, dry fruits & spice mix’ covered with a thin layer of solid fish & then crumb fried. The taste was not to remember by. Though an extra helping of over-strong Mustard paste ‘Kasundi’ induced some flavors into it. 

My uncle strongly recommended ‘mangshor singara’ – mutton samosa. His recommendation is better than mine – So u can surely try this out. Look forward to trying out devil, kabiraji etc in my next visits.

Tucked in a lane right next to Kalighat area is Apanjan..Its a one blink and you miss kinda outlet that serves arguably among the best fried foods in Kolkata.. It has a heritage that goes quite a long time back... Definitely a must try outlet.. You would more than often be asked for another option as the food items sell in a flash.. Must tries here are the Fish fries... All 3 sizes... The Chicken Lal fry.. Yunmy succulent fried tender chicken pieces that ooze juice and is super hot... And the Prawn pakoda which they have introduces recently...and yes. Do ask for an extre potato wedge...It complements the meal perfectly

Ordered chicken foul cutlets and fish fingers from apanjan, kalighat few days back.

I love fish fingers and those were really good fish fingers. Fish inside was really fresh with a crispy outside! I will rate those as 3.7/5

I love spicy and the foul cutlet tasted slightly sweet to me. It wasn't really my kind of a thing, so an average rating 3/5

Overall, good experience. Will try other items next time.

Located in the by-lanes of Kalighat, Apanjan is your go-to place if you love anything fried. But to find it you must take help of Google Maps and by the time you get there, you will be greeted with the aroma of fries. Keep a keen eye else you will miss the place. The eatery has no sitting option available, you either take away the order or stand while eating. Since on the first day I had not enough money with me, I ordered a large fish fry and a fried leg, the fish fry for 150 and the fried leg piece for 60. The service is prompt, I hardly waited 3/4 minutes before they handed me the parcel and the man who took the order and the money was polite. Now coming to the food. The fish fry was heavenly and I mean it.Pure  Bhetki fillet with a crunchy outer layer, it can make you close your eyes. The fried chicken was good too but I cannot stop thinking about the fish fry. With more money in hand, I will surely try the other items they have to offer and if you love fish and fried goodies, which almost all of us do, go for it, you won't be disappointed.

Yes they don't have dining facility,yes they don't accept cards,yes the place is too small to locate but Apanjan is a Bengali style snacks counter par excellence.The fish & chicken fries are drool-worthy,soft warm portions under the crispy crust.Works best as a takeaway counter it is a prominent part of the city's traditional food map.From Fish fingers to Chicken lal fry to Mangsher shingara every item is irresistible.I bet you can't stop with just one!One statutory warning,they don't serve mutton on Thursdays!Located conveniently near the Tapan Theatre the gathering of food lovers in front will tell that you found out the place & then just dig in!

One of the best street food joints in South Kolkata. Most people prefer the takeaway service. Their Fish Fry is to die for. Not many places actually use real Bhetki Fish while this place stands out. The fish is absolutely delicious and the quantity is huge. I've tried their fish finger and fish kabiraji too. The fish finger wasn't that good but the fish fry stole my heart. It's a MUST try. Their pricing is quite reasonable going by the quality and quantity. Also the staff is good. It really turned out to be a hidden gem amidst the fancy shops.

If you love fish fry, mutton cutlet and kabiraji, then apanjan wins big in South Kolkata. I love fish fry and the butter fish they make and these appears to be perfect evening snack. A must visit for fish fry lovers.

Food Quality is to die for. 
Go for Cutlets, that's the best. 
But be there on time, otherwise availability of your favourite snack won't be there for you.

I ordered chicken Momo from here and they sent fried chicken Momo. As condiments they gave onions, cucumber and mustard sauce. Not sure if they are in their senses....

This is a good "televajar" dokan, with various snacks to choose from. They have many good dishes. I tried their chicken laal fry, mutton keema cutlet and fired wantons. Mutton cutlet was great; one of the best I have ever eaten. But honestly speaking neither the chicken laal fry nor the fried wantons were up to the mark. Overall it was worth trying out.

So the first time had their food was during some food festival at city centre 1 ,when they had given their stall. And bingo their food instantly made me a fan. The first item i had was the fish pasinda , it was really great . It cost me around 150+ but the fish fillets were quite big and really juicy with a chutney type thing inbetween the layers. Even now whenever i go to their shop in kalighat i always have it.
The other items are also great, specially the mutton devil , mutton chop. Filled with lots of meat it is a great treat for the price.
Although it might look like any other TELEBHAJA r dokan, but the items are really tasety.

Well this place doesn't need a special introduction I believe, it's been one of my all time favourite ever since have visited their food joint. Located at 50, Sadananda Rd, Anami Sangha, Kalighat. Have tried Fish Pasinda which is lip smacking for sure one would suffice as it's so heavy, fish kobiraji, fish fry are some of the best items have had lately.

Fish cravings? Shoestring budget? Well, precisely Apanjan is the name you're looking for.
Located quite near Gate 10 of Kalighat Metro station off Rashbehari Avenue Apanjan is sure to give you a wonderful ride on the highway of divine and tasty fish items.
Been there on one of my street food day sprees, and came across this place. Little did I know that this shabby little place caters to the fast food needs of entire Old Calcutta. 

I ordered fish chops and fish fry. There was a huge crowd, so after a lot of struggle and hullabaloo I finally managed to get my order. But as busy as the cook was, he instead of fish chops he gave me fish kabiraji. I won't say I was unhappy, getting a kabiraji only made me happier. 

The Kabiraji was too oily (but street food, can't complain!). However, it was cooked beautifully. The Fish Fry was the highlight of my discovery. Priced at 60, the fish was fresh and that's it. Seldom do I come across street food outlets wherein fish fry literally means fish fry and those places should truly be awarded. The biscuit layer was crispy enough to let the juice squeeze out thus making a cushion for the tender meat to melt in your mouth. Sorry that I am going overboard on a fish fry, but let this show how amazing was this dish.
Definitely going back there tomorrow.

Bon Appetit. :D

PS: I am also of the belief that the chicken items are equally appetising. Do give it a try and let me know. Thanks

I order multiple times Mutton Moghali through  swiggy. The Moglai is excellent in taste. Potato curry needs special applause.It was one good Moghlai available in Kolkata  and does not cause any kind of digestive problem. Chicken Kabiraji was fine but not meeting my expectation. Chicken pakora have similar coating like the kabiraji really a bonus.

Great place to have evening snacks. Mostly nonveg snacks. Snacks are really delicious specially the fish items. Fish orly, fish fry, fish pasenda, fish fingers all are excellent. Mutton breast cutlet are also testy. Sitting not available only take away or to have snacks standing beside the shop. If you really want to try here  you have to be there before 6.

Apanjan is at number 9 in the list of top 35 of the must visit small eateries of Kolkata. Located near kalighat metro station, it is only a takeaway. The food is just awesome. Starting from the kabiraji, cutlet, fish fry, egg devil, dimsum roll, wantons, leg fry, foul cutlet, mughlai, mutton singara, radhaballabi all the items are exquisite in taste. It is must visit if you are nearby. People also come from far away just to takeaway food from this joint.

The place wasn't too shabby...though a little run-down I suppose but the food was very nice...I had ordered some hot crispy fries of chicken, mutton & fish just to compare...the prices and quantity seemed fair enough...one downside was none of the food I bought was hot or crispy to my liking...the chicken and mutton preparations were better compared to the fish as I found the batter to be uncooked to a certain degree for the fish...other than all this I'll recommend it to people who would like some heavy snack in the evening...

Nearest snacks shop from my house. It is one of the most reputed foodies place of south kolkata. If you reach there after 7pm you can buy only chicken pakora and few other dishes. Evry fry sold out within 7pm. And they never compromise with the food quality.
May be you find there price is high. But the food worth it.
I love their FISH ORLY.
Chicken pakora is up to the mark.
Fish fry is awsome... you will taste the pure vetki.
I tried chicken wanton. Nice.
egg devil is also nice. My maa loves it.

This is a fantastic place for evening snacks as long as you do not shy away from deep fried items. A wide variety of (mostly) non-vegetarian fried items are available here every evening. The rush at this tiny hole in the wall eatery may surprise many till they sample some of the savouries they dish out. 
Their 'mutton breast cutlet' is one of my favourites. Their fish fry is also a must try.

This small fried food joint is one of the famous stalls of Kolkata. Located near Kalighat metro station, Apanjan serves the much loved Bengali fried delicacies. Their fish fry and cutlets are famous.

It is situated at Dacres Lane, the famous lane which is famous and just 5mins walkway from Esplanade metro station.

They have two stores there one is bundled with #chowmin, #roll, #appetized stuffed Paratha & with that you can customise what you really want as your side dish. Another one is fully flavoured with "Chop - Televaja". There you can get #egg fry, #fish chop, #chicken chop, #cutlet, etc. I don't like to taste that fish chop every where for the bad quality they used but here if you can then you should really check this out once & as noticing the price tag it is one of the best of Kolkata. 

But every time you can't get all the items because many times they are running of out of stock of some of there items.

To be truthful I didn't get any flaws but if you are kind of person who is very concern about his/her health then you shouldn't go Dacres Lane because there you can't get the hygienic food at all the time.

I wish I could give a zero star. The rating has nothing to do with the quality of food served. Infact there was none since the food wasn't served. I placed an order through Zomato and made an online payment. The restaurant conveniently chose to decline the order. My point is if the restaurant doesn't have sufficient delivery staff, why would they list it for home delivery in the first place? Secondly, Zomato is equally at fault. If Zomato lists a restaurant for online delivery, then they should take some responsibility to ensure that the food is delivered. But sadly, Zomato never does that. Delivery from Swiggy is a much better option.

Apanjan - This hidden gem failed to impress me.
=====
Intro: 

For the first time, i had used Zomato Delivery App and ordered food online from here. Thanks to the Zomato hassle free online ordering service which helped me in getting food fast from here. I did not want to stuff myself much and went on trying few chicken items as i am a chicken lover. I have not visited it personally but seen it a couple of times while crossing the Sadananda Road. It is a small food kiosk. 
=====
What i ordered:  (Costed me 130 bucks all inclusive as i had applied Zomato coupon too)

○ Chicken Pakora - The pakora's coating was way too thick. I had got packet with just cut onion and cucumbers. The pakora's inside were just fine. 

○ Egg Chicken Roll - I had expected roll to be roll not chicken wrapped in egg and fried like that. It was way too oily to my liking. 

Both the items though delivered to me fast were stale and cold. 
=====
Pros: 
○ Pocket Friendly

Cons:
○ Way too oily.
○ Batter too thick.
○ Did not find it of great quality.
===== 
Meal for two: I had these two for 130 bucks. Meal for two would be 150 - 300 approximate (Prices subject to change due to macroeconomic factor such as inflation, etc.) 
=====
Summary:

Presentation 2/5
Taste 2/5
Hygiene 2/5
Quantity 2.5/5
Quality 2.5/5
VFM 2.2/5
=====
Conclusion:

I don't know why everyone seemed to have a great experience here. Maybe, i did not order the items which they excel at. Nevertheless, this is my experience with Apanjan. The pakoras were just average and so was the roll. I had to leave the coating part as it was way too oily. They should deliver sauce satchets as well (Mustard and Ketchup). It was really dry.

The price of the fries are high but one you taste them u won't complain for a single penny. Quality of food is cent percent satisfying. If you visit this place don't forget to try fish fry and chicken kabiraji

It has been proven by years of eating that some of the most delicious food emerges from the most humble of eateries. Apanjan is not a fancy designed eatery, in fact it is a small roadside hole in the wall kinda stall which serves the most delicious fried food items in South Kolkata. After all these decades they have now attained an iconic status, which no one can take away from them. When you are near the stall you will be mesmerized with the aroma of fish fries, cutlets and kabirajis. The place is bit pricey according to some, but I vouch for every penny you are paying here, it’s worth your money. They serve you fresh bhetki fish unlike all other road side snacks stalls in this part of the city. The place is located near Rashbehari crossing, you need to take the Sadananda road and walk towards Hazra when you will notice a roadside stall on your left opposite Tapan Theatre. You can easily identify the place by (a) the captivating aroma of fish fries in the air, and (b) huge crowd waiting outside the stall on the footpath for their food to arrive, or you can notice many savoring the delicacies right there standing by the busy road. The menu is written on a yellow board that stands upright outside the counter. And the non-fried stuffs are kept in glass box in the stall which is extremely cramped-up to be honest. You check out the menu and order your stuff, which they will then and there fry for you and serve piping hot with mustard sauce and chopped onions, pure bliss!
                                          ...

"South Calcuta has no good joint for fried food, barring Bijoligrill" my friend told me. That set me thinking. Though I am a lover for north Calcutta's dingy old fry shops, still I can remember at least couple of great joints from my old para, bhowanipore who can easily compete with city's best and most hyped joints anyday, just any single day. And, this hole in the wall is one of them.

You need to find this place. You've to come down to Sadananda road (very near to Kalighat temple) and follow it until you find a hope-in-the-wall with the hell lot of people flocking it. Alternatively, it's very near to Rashbehari metro station, take the opposite lane from the old CTC green colored gate and on Sadananda road, lies this place. Parking is not really an issue, but timing issue. They maestro starts from around 4 PM and all the good items tend to get over by 7 PM. You can easily ask "why ? They can easily prepare some more stock..." But then, all masters tend to be a little cranky- na ?

When I am saying a hole-in-the-wall, please be assured I am not exaggerating. It literally is. And all you can find it the boss sitting in one aged, wooden tool and an unimpressive showcase with lots of to-be-fried items. Look no further and till the time you decide upon your prey, order for their Fish Fry and I hope you're not ordering for anything other than the large one- or are you ? They serve their food fast. Once it reaches you with a tinge of the home-prepared mustard and some rubbish unwanted salad (who wants that ??? ), snap it, feel the heat coming from inside the beauty, put one slice inside your mouth and start thinking of ordering the next item. In the meantime, the kolkata betki will be starting its magic inside and an orgasm will start building up.

If you ask me, I'll vouch for their Fish Orly (fish battered fry) as their next item. Being a bong and Social Bong, I'm biased towards a good calcutta betki- love me or leave me for that. Shout for that and start licking those mustard from the plate with another piece of the fish fry. The second one will arrive soon enough. Again the same eating routine will follow I presume.

By the time you finish this and approach the counter for your next item, the owner will recognize you as a food fanatic and like in my case, might offer you some fish balls. I was kinda skeptic about these things, but had to apologize after popping one in mouth. They're small bustards filled with joy- missing my rum with thums up.

If you're brave enough, you'll go for their egg devil (Devilled Eggs) and fish kobiraji. But, after you've listened to and enjoyed Ustad Bade Gulam ali Saheb, Arijit Singh can hardly satisfy you... (no hard feelings to anyone please). Remembering Niranjan agar and fantasizing it, ask for the bill and be surprised. When had happiness come out this affordable ?

Will I go again ? But off course. I've been there maybe hundreds of time and definitely again...

Bon apetite !!!

Apanjan is a gold mine for fast food diggers. It is situated close to Tapan Theatre. This small joint serves some authentic Kolkata street food which can melt any foodies' heart. I ordered online through Zomato, and the delivery was prompt. I had fish finger, chicken roll, fish chop and the legendary chicken cutlet. Every item was piping hot and freshly made. However the fish fingers were a bit salty, but the rest were heavenly. Chicken Cutlet was just out of this world. This is a quintessential food joint that everyone should visit.

Gist : A small strictly delivery place (without any seating arrangement), food lacks any signature taste but still good. (Pricelist given in Photo)

I visited this place on 15.1.17 around 2PM. Easy to locate. A small delivery joint without any seating arrangement. Ordered 2 Fish Fry (Large) and Fish Finger (4 pieces). Price can seem to be on higher but quantity justifies the price. Quality is also good but expected a signature taste of the foods which was missing.

This is a very popular place in Kalighat area. If you are a fish lover, then you must visit this place! The rates are very average, the quality is just perfect! The service is very quick. The fish rolls, fish fries, and fish kabiraji are just too good. Keep up the good work.

Its located near my grandpa's house in kalighat and whenever I visited them I also visited there. The fish fry is to die for. They serve the best fish fries, genuine Bhetki fish. They served three types of fish fries according to it sizes. Chicken kabiraji and mutton moghlai are also very good. Its a hidden gem in south kolkata. Best place for evening snacks. Prices are very reasonable. Every items they served are very delicious. Its a must visit place for foodies.

Being a resident of the area I highly recommend this hidden gem of a place. This place is a two minute walk from the kalighat metro station. A small outlet, good things come in small packages. This joint is one of my favourites for quick bites as well as fish delicacies. Their kabiraji can compete with any A class restaurant, their mutton chops are sheer pleasures, to be very true I like all of their items be it their egg chicken special roll or the bhetki stuffed kabiraji cutlets. This little place will not dissapoint you.

This is a small joint near kalighat metro station. famous for the fish items. being a bong you can never be mistaken about the fish quality and this place serves real bhetki fillets which justifies the price. the fish fry, fish kabiraji are a must try. also we tried the mutton chop which was also good in taste. a very decent place for evening snacks in south kolkata.

Contrary to the high rating i found Apanjan to be quite ordinary. Being a bong fish is always a part of our daily meals and thus opted for a chicken kabiraji although the reviews suggest that they specialise in items of fish. The size of the kabiraji was huge. Justifiable pocket pinch. Good enough for an evening snack. The outer coating seemed tad thicker than it should have been and hence the essence of kabiraji was somehow compromised. The sheer bliss when you bite through the layer of external coating to dig into the juicy chicken filling was lost. Overall quite okayish actually. I did not find anything in this place to rave about. However that being said I will definitely try out the fish items next time. I'm positive about the fact that it will not disappoint me.

Located in the bylanes of Kalighat, this place can be truly called a hidden treasure chest....a treasure chest full of delicacies. The fish items like kabiraji, cutlets, fries and orlies are amazing. I find the chicken items intriguing too. Must try for all food lovers.I keep trying the various stuff every now and then and when everything in the menu has been tried and tasted....I'll start all over again...😋.

Being a true bong by heart, I am an aficionado of great fish fry, kabiraji and mughlai parathas! And if you share a similar kind of taste bud like mine, then this is the best place to be! :D
This quintessential bangali shop offers excellent "chop bhaaja bhuji" in an absolute pocket friendly price and it never fails to tantalise the taste buds. My favourite pick will be the fish chop which was filling enough as compared to its price :)

In all, this place serves one of the best fish fry in the city so don't miss !

Simply a hidden gem - the best place i will recommend the fish lovers to try out their fish kabiraji - taste is just brilliant, thick fillet of bhetki chunk inside the batter. even the mutton chop tasted so good.  Their fish kabiraji can beat any star restaurants in kolkata . This joint  has better crowd than Bijoli Grill next to it.

A place worth trying for every fish lover. It is a legendary place when it comes to the quintessential bangali snacks. 

The fish items here are lipsmacking. Do try their Fish fry and kabiraji.

We opted for the medium kabiraji which is priced at 110. Quite a big piece, and excellent quality of fish was used. Really worth price.

I also decided to take the egg devil which is priced at 30. This was a good choice, too. The size was large enough. 

Overall the food was filling and talking of the price, it was cheap. This roadside shop which has no interiors to boast of is a gem in the south Kolkata food scene. Highly recommended!

A legendary name when it comes to writing the history for snack and street food in Kolkata, Apanjan has been, will be and probably will always be a prominent me in this feature. Primarily a take-away and a standing joint, the quality of the products served here are above par and excellence, and will thus give you very little or no reason to be fussy about. Try their Radhaballavi or the Cutlets, but whatever you decide to order, do not miss out on the Fish items. Pricing here is quite reasonable, and rightly justifies the price tag attached to it..!

I have been eating Apanjan's food for the last 30 years . The outlet is a small one located on Sadananda Road and is accessible from Hazra as well as Rashbehari. The owner and the staff members are very warm and go extra miles in terms of hospitality. No sitting arrangement . One have to stand in the footpath to eat or the best option is carrying to home . 
The Radhaballavi with Kashmiri Alur Dom is the great one to start with. I used to eat it at ₹5 in 1985. The shop specialises in Fish Items , since the owner Probash Da is an expert in fish . The fish Orly, fry , Cutlets , egg mutton devil , chicken and mutton cutlets are mouth watering. 

If you are around Rashbehari , you cannot afford to avoid this place .

It's currently a must-try, primarily street-eat/parcel/delivery  place I strongly recommend:

Apart from most of the stuff being freshly prepared in front of you depending on when you visit, the thick single piece fillet of fish in the fish  is the clearest indicator of the taste.
The prices are reasonable and the mutton, egg and chicken dishes too I can recommend. With the chops also coming with beautiful Kabiraji like coverage/coating. Prawn dishes and fried dumpling, etc are available too but I did not try.

For vegetarians, the chops, radhapallabi, alurdom , Moghlai Paratha, Egg dishes, Chicken dishes and Fish dishes can all be recommended. Although beyond this, most of the other dishes are non-vegetarian and use mutton in some form or the other. Please note for the radhapallabi-alurdom, etc and mutton singara and other such snack items go before evening, as by the time twilight sets in, those are all exhausted.

They provide pretty good streetside service in terms of plates, cutlery, tissues, bins and a make-shift handwashing arrangement. Although there is no seating-service there officially, I recommend visiting and eating at the shop itself and going-as-you-like ordering some more dishes based on which tastes you might savour. It's hard to eat just one or two menu items at this shop once you have tasted.

And don't just limit yourself to the fish. Even the post -afternoon snacks like radhapallabi are recommended.

Apanjan, is a small food joint near Kalighat,  that is known for it's fish fry. People either eat at the joint or take away. The behavior of the person at the counter is very friendly and caters to the requirement of the customer. Most importantly, the taste of the items at Apanjan is so tempting that one keeps on visiting the place. Coming to price,the items here are reasonably priced and one will not complain after consuming it's Fish fry or the fish chop

My first trial for this famour chop shop was satisfactory. I got chicken dimsum roll , 2 fish chops , mutton kancha keema cutlet ; mentioned in the order of my liking. All came with mustard sauce and sliced onion cucumber salad. The chops had kabiraji kind of coating which i usually donot prefer. The dimsum roll had a tastier stuffing . Mutton keema cutlet was really a value for money thing, Somehow i felt i had tastier chops and cutlets so far , but the quality of the food sold here is appreciable .

Apanjan is a tiny shop which can fool anyone with its appearance, but if you are smart enough, you would go straight and order their Mutton Kancha Keema Cutlet right away on this rainy evening. I have had cutlets from an umpteen number of places but none like the one here. Priced reasonably at 50 per piece, the juicy chunks of mutton covered in a thin and crispy coating stole my heart. There's an interesting item called the Chicken Dim Sum roll which is almost like a spring roll but with a fried cover resembling a Kobiraji. This place is a MUST try for all the foodies out there. Their fish chops are amazing as well.

P.S.: As I write this review after a whole month, I can still salivate at the thought of that Mutton Cutlet!

Had been hearing about this place but never could find out the place since it is located in an obscure place opposite Tapan theatre, and it was never in my way back home. One fine evening I was stuck in a traffic jam, so just started walking along Sadananda Road. Then came across it. Could not believe how such a famed place could be hidden in such a dirty manner. Could not resist to buy a couple of fish items and take them to home. I boarded a shuttle from Chetla, and each of the commuters were wondering about the fragnance of biye bari items. hahaha. 

Quality: Had fish fries, rolls, kabirajis from many places in Kolkata. Nobody comes close to their fares. Unbelievable, just out of the world. Since then I had been visiting this place time and again. You would just detest other fish fries once you had theirs. 
There is a saying in Bengali about Kashmir - "sworgo jodi kothao thake ta ekhanei ekhanei ekhanei ". Same applies to Apanjan and their fries. 

Deducting 0.5 for the ambience, otherwise 5/5.

Thanks to zomato for letting me have the opportunity to find this hidden gem. I was in the area and wanted to have something as an evening snack and came across this joint. Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. It was really hard to find as it is a very small joint by the side of the road and can be easily overlooked. Either u wanna take away or dine u have to stand in line. Wow that rhymed. It is always crowded with customers. I decided to go for the mutton breast kabiraj and egg chop. They served those hot in few minutes. And the next 10mins was just bliss. The taste rush was just too good. The prices are a little high considering the way the outlet looks but looks can be deceiving. They don't compromise with the quality and taste. A must try if u are in the area.

Apanjan has been the quintessential ''Chop Fry er Dokan'' for all the Bangalis living in this part of the city. Their fries and chops were once a rage and I have been lucky enough to munch on a number of their deep fried chops throughout my childhood.

But according to me the quality of the food put out has taken a gradual dip while the prices have soared. The fish fry can still give many a run for their money, but it is just not the way it used to be. The coating has gone thicker and the fish thinner, which deliberately used to be the other way around.

The mutton breast cutlet and the fish finger are a must try, if visiting.

Places like this are exactly what foodies search for, all the time. And this is where Zomato comes in. I wouldn't have found this place, if not for zomato. The place is a gem, hidden in the bylanes of kalighat. 
It is a small shop. Ppl who want to parcel or dine , have to stand on the pavement. I was there for around half n hour and I could figure out that this place had a good turnover. 
Almost 80% of the crowd were trying the fish kabiraji and so did I, taking the cue. It was tasty, and had a good thick layer of fish. 
I also tried the mutton egg devil, which was pretty decent.
Pros:
1. Taste
Cons:
1. Not that cheap for the type of establishment 
2. No seating or waiting space

This has become a heritage outlet of Kolkata. Though I have been there a few times earlier but never bothered to write a review..as the exorbitant pricing always overshadowed anything else in my mind. Granted, the fish quality is fresh and good for all the items they offer. But ₹150 for a fish fry at a roadside joint is more than too much. Even pure bhetki doesn't justify this steep price.
I can see it has got a high rating at Zomato. Probably I'm not able to see the way others are seeing. Other than nostalgia value I don't see why this should be rated so highly.

Pros:
1. Fresh quality food.
2. Tons of nostalgia for older people which definitely trickles down to their younger ones.

Cons:
1. Exorbitant pricing.
2. Lathergic and/or arrogant behaviour at counter (perks of being popular).

Apanjan - Opposite Tapan theatre near Rashbehari crossing (lane next to Bachhan dhaba). A haven of fries and quality fish items. You will love the fish fries (the price varies between Rs.110 to Rs.150). Perhaps the best quality bhetki used by them. Other items are equally good and tasty. Also, a special mention of the fish radhaballavi which has a remarkably tasty filling.

Overall a great place to visit if you are craving for bengali style fried cutlets/fries and kabirajis.

This shop is very close to Tapan Theatre. After watching an intellectual, political play by Mir and others at the Theatre on a sultry evening we'd stood in line to buy their egg pakodas which'd turned out just awesome-tasting. Even though I'm not much into eggs, I've tasted their egg chops & egg devils which are deliciously appetising, hot and fresh with crisp coatings. Their fish chops are also great quick bites. After an event or program at the Theatre if one's hungry one should certainly pay a visit to this place to satiate one's hunger with some of the crispiest and freshest snacks in town. Known for their 'fresh fish' this shop truly is an "apanjan" when it comes to Bengali-style street food.

Popularly meaning "ones own", this place is a teeny weeny place to enjoy authentic Bengali snacks. I have tried almost everything they serve. And trust me, there is hardly anyone better than them in South Kolkata. Although I would rate Niranjan Agars " Dimer Devil " to be superior to them, it is without any doubt that I can say that their Fish Fry is grander than anyone elses. Oily but yeah you would literally gorge on the fish rather than nibbling the crumbs. Where places are commercialized beyond recognition, Aponjan retains the aura of old Kolkata charm. Serving unadulterated hot food, its truly a common man's delight. Roaring thumbs up!!!

This is a hidden gem of Kolkata. They literally serve the best cutlet/kabiraji of Kolkata (South). They are amongst the few shops who has to close down due to exhaustion of raw materials from their huge sale. In fact some of their items are only available for around an hour or so. The items are a bit pricey but their quality is awesome.

Popularly meaning "ones own", this place is a teeny weeny place to enjoy authentic Bengali snacks. I have tried almost everything they serve. And trust me, there is hardly anyone better than them in South Kolkata. Although I would rate Niranjan Agars " Dimer Devil " to be superior to them, it is without any doubt that I can say that their Fish Fry is grander than anyone elses. Oily but yeah you would literally gorge on the fish rather than nibbling the crumbs. Where places are commercialized beyond recognition, Aponjan retains the aura of old Kolkata charm. Serving unadulterated hot food, its truly a common man's delight. Roaring thumbs up!!!

This is a hidden gem of Kolkata. They literally serve the best cutlet/kabiraji of Kolkata (South). They are amongst the few shops who has to close down due to exhaustion of raw materials from their huge sale. In fact some of their items are only available for around an hour or so. The items are a bit pricey but their quality is awesome.

In both the city centre there is an ongoing classic food festival in which apanjan has given their stall. I went to city centre 2 as it is near my house only to have food from apanjan as I absolutely devour their fish fry.  Without checking any other food stalls I ordered fish fry (big) which was priced at rs. 160 and chicken leg fry. The fish fry is the best here  and if based only on this dish I would rate it 5 out of 5. The chicken leg fry was priced at rs. 60 and was very attractive looking and good in quality and taste but not extraordinary also it is very heavy on the stomach. I also bought fish fry (small) for rs. 120 and chicken cutlet for rs 70. The small fish fry is not really small and taste wise it was no different than the big one with a thick fillet of fish with no other unnecessary fillings. The chicken cutlet was also excellent as the chicken fillet was thick and juicy. As the kalighat shop is really far away from my place I have visited it only once and mostly i do not get the chance of visiting that area so I never miss out the opportunity of trying their food items in the food festivals where they put up their stalls.

I can never say I've eaten every thing on their menue no matter how many times I eat at Apanjan coz they keep innovating, never eaten anything that doesn't tastes super. Another good thing about Apanjan is that they always sell items to suite one's pocket even if that means 3 types of fish fry. As fried food is usually my favourite evening snack in my mind its apan- jaan

Its a small little take away near Kalighat and is famous for there fries and cutlets. They start the shop at 2 and by 7 you will find the racks empty, so is the demand!! My personal favourite are their fish chips, an unique creation, a signature item of this famed joint. You can also try their mutton muglai paratha which is sumptuous to say the least.
Do try their spl mutton singara..

First of all menu here is I think of 10 yrs back. Fishfry prices according to sizes small/med/large are 110/130/150. Chicken roll fry 60,chicken fry 40.Mutton cutlet small 50. Quality good no doubt. A large fillet of real Bhetki and very thin crust with very little spice. A good fishfry always is made like this. Too much flavouring of ginger, garlic, coriander is actually to hide bad quality smelly fish. Anyways small place stand and eat kind of near Kalighat temple. Spent 300 bucks for a 4 items. For non veg snacks lovers this is a must visit place.

This is another review based on my dad's opinion and he calls this one of his favourite snack shops, a small little take away counter in Kalighat. He says this place was one of his favourites in his younger days and he is still happy to see that the quality of their food hasn't detoriated one bit. 
Even I personally loved their Fish Fry & Mutton Cutlet. Dad's favourite though is the Egg Devil they serve, need to taste that one soon.

It is a small but highly popular take out joint in Kalighat. People living in that locality swear by it. I have also tasted its delicacies. My father was a lover of deep fried food. We have taken fish fry, mangsher shingara, chicken cutlet. I did not find it much extraordinary compared to other renowned joints such as Mitra Cafe. But that may be because I don't like fried food much. My father loved it.

Yes, if one considers taste then no doubt that this age old joint is one of the best in kolkata, but on the contrary there are some cons which need to be mentioned:
1. Hygiene of the place needs a lot of improvement.
2. Price of all the fried items of fish is on the higher side when compared to equivalent good similar joints in south kolkata.
Nevertheless the freshness of the food served  is the USP of this place and hence the 3.5 rating.

Apanjan--->the heavenly and famous joint in South Kolkata, best known for its fish fry, fish pasinda, prawn pakora, chicken pakora, mutton chop, egg devil..etc etc and the list goes on and on.
Me and my sis, often being tagged as 'Complete Foodies', doesn't miss a single chance to hop on in front of this joint whenva we are near Tapan Theatre located @ Kalighat. Though the price chart is a bit high, no complains from our side as we remain full with the yummy items welcomed my our hungry stomachs.

'Apanjan' true to its name will make you their own people. The wide range of Chicken, Mutton & Bhetki Fish items definitely feature in Kolkata's best snacks and perhaps has no competition in its category especially in its area of Kalighat. As is the case with most legendary food joints in Kolkata, ambience, service, location will have to be discounted when you are getting the excellent quality snacks which will satisfy your tummy.

This is a place for foodies. If u love telebhaja,panorama and cutlets u have to try this place or else u are really missing on something. Every food item is great. But the greatest are the fish items. They use good quality fish. The price is in accordance to the quality. It's an experience u have to have if u r a Bangali.

A joint serving classy kolkata fries and cutlets for years.
Good quality ingredients,fresh ingredients,excellant preparations and courteous and polite behaviour is what makes this place stand out.
Most of the items are like hot cakes and gets exhausted by 7 p.m ,so you have to be an early bird.
Must tries are
fish fry(the big one)-you will love the neat thick slab of bhetki.
kabiraji
fish chips
fowl cutlet
egg devil-very good
this joint is an addiction if you travel through the route regularly

LEGENDARY. And justifiably so. Apanjan is the last word on Kolkata Fish Fry. Made with a solid fillet of the Calcutta Bhetki, it is pure bliss as soon as it hits your palette. The pricing at Rs 120 and 150 may feel a bit steep, but once you taste it, you will know that it makes perfect sense. I would pay a bit more without any qualms if the product is as good.

And add Fish Pasanda to that list of heavenly goodness - two thin fillets of Bhetki stuffed with Mutton Keema - and also the Mutton Chop - slightly sweet and spicy mutton keema croquettes fried in an egg batter. These three items are absolutely delicious at this place.

But it's not over yet. The Chicken Cutlet, Chicken Pakoras, Fish Finger, Mutton Braised Cutlet, Vegetable Chop are all amazing and the best you will find in South Kolkata. For me, this is the ultimate pit-stop to sample Kolkata's snacks, and a place every tourist should visit. 

I have been carrying stuff from here back to my college and office for the last 4 years, and people swoon over it. They even pay me to get extra! Delicious and well worth locating it. Near Tapan Theater, if that helps.

You can easily miss this place, if you're not aware of it beforehand. But then, it is quite impossible to be in kalighat and not know about this heavenly place. 
Apanjan are known for the quality which they exhibit in their products, especially compared to the other rival outlets. As soon as you bite the fish fry, you realise it is nothing but pure bhetki (river bass). Same goes for other items on the menu..particularly the fish ones (as it is easy to substitute them for cheaper varieties). Hence it justifies the pricing, which is a bit on the higher range. 😀
Nevertheless, it is very popular and rightly so. Highly recommended. 😇

It's a street snacks shop that can give competition to many branded restaurants serving fried goods.Its very much near to my home & I come here lot of times.I've tried almost all items on menu but their fish dishes are to die for! They use fresh good quality vetkis of which u get sure about the moment u bite into the fish fries/fish fingers/fish kobirajis/fish orly.They don't kill the freshness of flavour coming from fish itself with overuse of spices.The filling is wholesome too within the crispy coating.They don't have proper sitting arrangements and pricing is bit higher than other street food stalls but the quality of food is totally worth it.

PS-Reach aponjon early if u want to have their best dishes because most of the good items fly out within 7pm.The shop opens at 3pm.

Few things to mention about this place : 
1. This is one of the most highest rated street snacks shop available in Kolkata. 
2. This place have a lot of fanboys.
3. Healthy & most authentic taste is what this place is famous for.
4. They use pure "Vetki" unlike others use "Vola Vetki" as per their fish related dishes.

Observation :
First of all this place was in my bookmark list for a long. Wanna thank Taniya that she made me to move this place to my been there list.

Secondly when I reached there I realized that the Zomato database is absolutely outdated than the current one. Price chart on Zomato is so outdated that current prices become 2-3 times of that.

Decorations :
Nothing special than a street food experience. You can expect a lots of crowds in front of the shop almost every time. Their snacks are viewed from a glass showcase in front of the restaurant. Plastic chairs are on the footpath to make you feel comfortable. This street restaurant definitely holds a big name in all over Kolkata but unfortunately their Main Title Banner can't hold their name properly. Some letters are fallen off from it & from this it can be assumed, Apanjan doesn't invest on the presentation of the restaurant. Probably their main concentration is on foods rather than decorations, especially when you are paying 4 times than other street food shops then its highly expected. Finger crossed lets taste the foods...

Coming to the authentic taste : She ordered a Fish Fry for me. Stuffs & management were pretty fast because at that highly crowd of Durga Puja they deliver the food on our hand pretty fast. The first thing that I notice is the Mustered Sauce was of very high quality that tastes really really good & isn't found easily on other shops. I was willing to order something more but the actual fish fry disappointed me a lot. It was fried well in fresh high quality oil that was totally visible. Inside of it was fully poured with Pure Vetki no spices, no other spices or pouring was there rather than the streamed fish. The fish tasted itself only so you will miss other richness that is usually seen from other restaurants. Somehow this is kind of healthy food that offers pretty average taste. All this doesn't actually deserves the price point of the foods over here.

Prices : Prices are unexpectedly extremely higher than same kind of street food restaurants even when neither they offer any dining or AC Cabin. Although they use very higher rated fish & stuffs but still the taste of the foods didn't perform well with the taste bugs & offers very average taste.

Conclusion : If you ride a Class C Mercedes Benz but cant afford Grand, Then its the right street food experience for you. ( If you know what I mean ). It is a overrated, overpriced place that is ruling just because of their fanboys. There fore it is a complete day night robbery restaurant for what they actually offer. Still it is a must single try restaurant if you really want to believe its authenticity.

Being north kolkatan I am too fond of fries irrespective of veg or non-veg. Till date I always thought north kolkata is the palce to have fries but apanjan proved me wrong. Last month I was in Kalighat region so I decided to try my luck on apanjan. I ordered fish fry. It seemed damn costly at first but then after the first bite I got to know why they charged me the bucks. It is just too good. If you are a fry lover, do try this place.

Apanjan in Zomato!!
Man, this feels just as good as a plate of Radhaballavi there when you're hungry!!
...
Anyway, okay.
Thing is, I grew up right in that neighbourhood; so naturally my affair with Apanjan started long, long ago. 16years. Yes, 16 it is.
Snacks from here was a regular thing in our household back then - and as a kid all I used to get was bits and pieces from baba, jethu, dadu!
I still remember the day when dadu took me there after I got badly bruised while playing, and planned not to stop until they allowed me to eat a whole Kabiraji ! (Though I don't really remember whether I managed to eat the whole thing :P)
Yeah, the portions were definitely bigger then. And everything was way more tasty ! Really !
(But then again, that may just be an illusion of my juvenile mind :P)

Though we live there no more, everytime I'm anywhere near I pay a visit, religiously. And today what I eat doesn't really matter, what really matters is all the good ol' memories that I have !
But then again, Apanjan never disappoints me.
The only chaap is, they run out of stock real taratari ! Aro beshi beshi kore kano banay na ke jane !

Oh. And.
They don't serve any mutton items on Thursdays.

The best place in south koltkata for fast food. Near to Tapan theatre in kalighat area a small takeaway counter of heavenly fries and cutlets. Fish fry , fish kabiraji, fish worli r just out of the world. They use very good quality bhetki and that's why the cost is a bit on the higher end considering it to be a takeaway counter only. But believe me u won't regret coz the taste is awesome. Fish kochuri, egg devil is also very popular.

Fish Kochuri is a speciality. Egg Devils are made with duck eggs. Chicken and mutton items are also great here.
You will always find a crowd of people in front of this small shop.

It's simple. Apanjan - a place to have Fabulous fish fry. Go and grab a fish fry. The well done fish fry is bigger than a hundred rupee note. In fact, it costs you approx Rs.150. The thickness of the fry reconfirms that it's filling. On your first bite you get the taste of thick fish fillet coated with thin layer of bread crumbs, fried to brown with care. Second bite onwards you will get engrossed in the taste of the delicacy and start ignoring the ambiance and usual roadside cacophony. Once you are done you will start appreciating it more.  Its a must try for fry-lovers. They have other weapons in their armory like mutton cutlet, veg chop , kabiraji which equally tempting !!!

Lot of childhood memories attached with this place ..when ever we had guests at our place my father used to get fish fry or kobiraji or egg devil....when ever I pass that area I ensure to taste fish fry which is my personal favorite... During my child hood they even used to make radhabhavi and onion free aludum  ...that taste still I do not find any where

Nostalgic place for me... Spend almost 15 years residing in that locality and Apanjan was the best and will always be the best snacks bar... Still now I love the mughalayi paratha and all the other snacks.

Nostalgic place for me. My college was at Hazra so while returning home or going for tution, it used to be our frequent stop for evening snacks after spending a tiresome day at college. Located just opposite of Tapan Theater at Kalighat, don't go by the looks of the shop. There is no place to sit, you need to stand outside on the footpath holding the paper plates in hand and enjoy the food but the food is worth that effort. My pick will be fish fry, chicken cutlet and offcourse egg devil, other items are also delicious as well. If you are late by 7-7:30pm each and every item will get finished, so going there within 4:30-5pm is suggested. Now days also when ever I go to kalighat or rash behari area, i always visit Apanjan for their mouth watering fish fry, chicken cutlet and egg devil.

After some disastrous eating experiences recently,at last some sunshine.

4 feet frontage,forgettable signboard,you will probably miss this place if you are not really looking for it.

But swelling crowd outside and the old glass showcase displaying some of the most delectable old school fish,chicken,mutton and egg items in raw form,which on being fried in front of you transform themselves and also you,as it did me.

Mutton cutlet,the large fish fry of the three available sizes,egg devil and chicken kabiraji.

All of them uniformly good with the mutton cutlet and fish fry being top notch.

Long live and God bless this institution.

Apanjan in Bengali means 'the near and dear one'. The food sort of smacks of this familiarness of authentic north kolkatan telebhaja which has been so near and dear to me for decades. I had chicken cutlets and fish fry. The chicken cutlets were out of the world and excellent. Very fresh and not overtly spicy, the cutlets will linger on my mind for a long time. The fish fry was decent and average. Nothing special. I will try this place again for sure.

My affair with Apanjan started around 17 years ago...and I am not lying! My mom's mamarbari is in Kalighat and it is a complete traditional joint Bengali family. My grandmother had 10 siblings so whenever I visited this place with my mom I had the privilege of relishing a quintessential Bong poribar. My uncles and grand uncles took me out to try out the dishes that held the old Calcutta charm and that's when my affair started!  However my nostalgia doesn't influence my review friends.... these people are experts in their own style of cooking!!!! It has become expensive but its worth it. Have the fish kabiraji and cutlets, they are magnificent!! The place is little hard to find if you are new to this area but ask anyone in the Kalighat area and they will easily guide you....it's quite a landmark here!!

This place is very nostalgic for me as since childhood i used to have fish fry and kabirajis from this place everytime i used to come to kalighat with family for darshan. Though the quality has degraded and price increased considerably in the past few years still this place i bet serves one of the best fish fries and kabirajis in kolkata.

Location -- if u get down @ jatin das park metro station and come out on the foot where hazra pathfinder or ginger stands , ask anyone for kalighat temple road. A little toward the temple and take a left turn , u will find first bijoli grill food counter and then walk a little further u will find apanjan. Though now , the banner only spells panjan with the " a " missing. :-P

Ambience -- this is a very small shop serving fries and kabirajis. No seating arrangement or even chairs on foot path. U will have to eat holding ur plate. But sometimes we don't need ambience at all as the food does all the talking.

Food -- now, coming to the best part. Food is as usual very good. Though the quality is not same as before still better than most. U can feel the bhetki in the fry. And yes, they serve real bhetki not aar or bombay bhetki like other stores. All items are lip smacking but however i feel a little too high priced. The fishes are filet and not smashed soo the taste prevails.

However all good things have a price and so does apanjan. Soo doesn't matter really.

Snacks are good.. but the attitude of the person i.e prabash uncle's son is just not good... we asked for 10 egg  chops asked like 3 times and waited for like 10 mins .. the  a reply came ' Apnar ki lagbe'  replied egg chops as i told before.... then the reply came  'if i don't give any answer  thun understand i don't have it in stock. ..'

My guy and I-we simply love paying visit to apanjan whenever he returns to town. No qualms,Apanjan indeed is a diamond beneath its shabby coal appearance. Have their chicken pakoras and I can vouch on this fact,you will get over your exuberance for kfc! Nothing can be more comprehensible than that statement to elucidate my experience in Apanjan.

Small joint,no place to sit and standing on the footpath with paper plates on your hand to have some WONDERFUL SNACKS is the small definition of this place called APANJAN..
The best way to locate this joint is to reach Rashbehari Avenue(Kalighat Metro) and then walk towards chetla and turn to your first right lane and walk straight for around 2-3mins and you will find Apanjan on your left hand side..I am a frequent visitor of this place..
They have a wide varieties of snacks to choose from..All the items are beautifully kept in a glass showcase and you can choose from them and they will serve you hot and fresh..
Now coming to the food..One should not miss their Rs.130 Fish Fry..ITS WORTH IT..the fillet of bhekti fish is incredibly thick and beautifully marinated and served with kasundi ,salad and potato wedges..Some of my favourite picks are:-

1. Rs.130 Fish Fry-- A MUST TRY
2. Chicken Dimsum
3. Chicket Cutlet
4. Fish Kabiraji
5. Egg Devil

So dont miss this place..You wont regret..An awesome place for some awesome cutlet and snacks..The price is not at all heavy on pockets..A MUST VISIT FOR ALL CUTLET LOVERS..

A must visit for a foodie who is in Kolkata.
My picks are the Egg Devil and the Chicken Cutlet.
That perfect taste with a touch of experience and expertise. 
Try this place during early evening or else you might have to come back again on the next day as they run out of stock very early. Also, try the egg pakora. They are good.

I've never been to this place but mom packs food from here atleast once a month. She calls it a small shop but I've always loved all things she has brought home! I've tasted the fish orly which is perfect... The chicken kabiraji is great and the fish fry is decent. Recently they had their stall in a street food festival in city centre. I tried a fish fry which was smelly and my favourite kabiraji was horrible too... I dont think I would like to eat from there again!

After hearing a lot about this place and finding it on zomato's list of "Hidden Gems", i decided i just had to try out this place. So on a lazy evening me and my friends dropped into this joint near kalighat. It took some time locating. Its basically on the street beside bachhan's dhaba. You have to walk beyond Tapan theatre.
      Its basically a stand and have joint or a takeaway. We preferred to have our food there itself. The famed mutton shingaras had exhausted themselves so we went with the other famous item - the fish fry. We also had chicken wantons and a chicken roll a piece.
           The fish fry and wantons were mind-bogglingly good. The chicken roll was not the usual roll. It was a kabiraji sort of a preparation. We didn't quite like the roll. But full marks for the fish fry and wantons.
          Planning to go there again just to try out the mutton shingaras which we sadly missed?

I went here today evening after finding this place highly rated on Zomato. I was not sure what would be best to try on my first visit. The place was a bit crowed and most people were ordering kobiraji, fish fry and egg devil. I tried the mutton singhara and mutton kobiraji.

The mutton in the kobiraji was not minced at all but had large chewy piece of meat. Was thoroughly disappointed and threw away more than half of it. The mutton singhara did not have any mutton in it (at least could not taste it). It tasted like a sweeter Bengali singhara; had a wet filling and some raisins in it.

Did not have the heart to try out another item. Wonder what the hype is about! I guess my expectations were set really high with a 4.5 rating.

Want to have the best Chops,Pakoras,Cutlets or Kobirajis in Kolkata? Stop by Apanjan in Hazra. It is too small to notice and maybe the small size of the outlet might disappoint you,but am very much sure you wont remember much of anything,as soon as your teeth sinks into your food you ordered from Apanjan.Its like a beautiful symphony in your mouth,taking your palate on a journey to the food heaven.I would never forget their Egg Devils,Mutton Kobirajis and Cutlets.One bite and am lost in an unknown world where its just me and that cutlet :') I can never have enough of their dishes.
P.S : Do go in as early as they open.And its an takeway counter,so no places to sit around!

There is no word to described the taste and quality of the food they serve. Every little thing they prepare is delicious whether it is egg devil, fish fry, moglai, chicken roll. One should try once the food of this joint. Go little early by four in the evening otherwise you have come empty stomach as they keep limited stock of their items.

A nondescript outlet. Had read the reviews and was searching for it. At first glance you probably won't even notice it. But 'heritage' speaks off this place, which can be understood from the customers here!
Packed fish fry and fish pasinda for home. Would say that the price is on the higher side. (dont exactly remember but above 120rs) The quality of the item makes up for it! Had the price been a bit low, would have rated it 5.

It's among the very few places in kolkata that uses real 'bhetki' to make fish fries. and its perfect, in all sense of a word. hot, crispy and fresh. apart from the fish fry, the mutton kabiraji is also lip smacking, tastes best with ' kasundi chutney'. you can also try other varieties of chicken or mutton or fish cutlets and fries here. they are equally delicious.. ;)

You got to be there to believe how wonderful this tiny place is.. Apanjan is a food lover's little paradise. Its a small shop, which sells everything from Fish fries, fish orlies, chicken fries, dimsums, wantons,to kabirajis..is a sheer delight. Its popularity looms so large that everything is over by 6pm. So if you plan to try their foodstuff, make sure u be there earlier than that. Yesterday after a long.time went there wit my mom to parcel Fish orlies..but unfortunately they were.over by then. Then we ordered chicken kabiraji n chicken fry, whch we ate inside our car parked opposite the shop. Although it was little oily, nevertheless the taste was great. Later we quickly parcelled 2 plates of Chicken Dimsums, Chicken Wantons n Bhekti Fry to eat at home. Immediately after reaching home, we wasted no time n ate all of that. Wantons were amazing, with just the right filling n crisp. Dimsums were good too. But Bhekti Fry was mind blowing! Next time, i plan to reach there asap to try their signature Fish.Orlies..since  its been a loooong time. :)

It's surely a pocket sized bomb. You will have no idea how great is this place just when you see this. It's dirty and a little odd. But famous for their fries, everything is sold out everyday by 7pm in the evening. Everything they make, the fish fries, fish fingers, fish diamonds, kabirajis, chicken items, mutton items, everything is just so good that you will keep on licking their fingers. KFC comes to no place beside Apanjan. And that's true. You should try this place out once. And you will keep on coming here for the sake of their fries. True that is. So, happy dining! :)

One of the few shops of kolkata where you can have original bhetki fry, Apanjan has delighted office goers as well as food enthusiasts for many years. The shop is not difficult to locate and it epitomises the phrase "don't go by looks alone". The place offers varieties of fried items like Fish Fry, Kabiraji, Cutlets, Chop etc. If you are one tight budget as I was during my college days, you will be content with a nice Fish Chop. It's worth the price. But be warned. The items are only available for a couple of hours as they do not make large quantities. This philosophy enables them to serve fresh items everyday.

Lucky that I was born a Bong... and one heck of a hungry Bong.... And so long as places like Apanjan would live.. I wish to continue being reincarnated as a hungry Bong. Kalighat metro, the smell of the Rajanigandha flowers..and telebhaja (deep fried in Bengali) smell they jive together so well... And in one such alley , very near to the theater, a small take away kiosk serves all the reasons to stay a Bong... And yes they specialize in the 140rs fish fry... But man, everything they serve is a masterpiece.... We ordered the famed costliest freshest slab of bhetki (godly taste made to perfection) fry... And the mutton breast cutlet.. The cutlet is simply stunning.. The best ever I have ever had.. This was followed by the mutton kabiraji cutlet.. Again very specially made... The person who looked to be at the helm offered a dim sum kaviraji ,which is a unique battered chicken Momo/ dimsum... An innovation they have recently launched... Overall this place is an epic.... You will love this experience I can vouch for that...

went to this place yesterday with a friend..it is located a few steps away from tapan theatre. we ordered two egg chops and one chicken cutlet but just when we were going to receive our plates the man said that we ordered egg devils and so we had to take it coz it was ready to be served.
the egg devils were okayish and my friend felt that the inside was a little bit under-cooked.however the chicken cutlet was good.
hope to visit it soon and taste some few other items..but it is definitely worth trying..

Okay so there's no way on this earth that I can rate this place below 4.5! My love for deep fried food is legendary and so is this gem of a place! Very near to the Kalighat temple, I have literally grown up eating their food! 
Their fish fry with kasundi is mouthwatering! Also the egg devil, chicken cutlet & chicken kabiraji is beyond excellent. 

If you are a little late in the evening there's a fairly good chance that they might be out of their famous fish fry! Everything sells like hot pancakes out here and literally! With no seating space, this place offers some heavenly authentic Bengali snacks. Staff is super fast and fries,packs and serves food in a jiffy! The place is so crowded that sometimes I feel as if I am standing in front of some puja pandas queue! The best thing about them would be their quality, they never have and I don't think they ever will compromise upon their quality. Generation after generation have maintained their consistency. 
Proportions are really good and for the price you pay it's worth every penny. The crust of the fish fry is crisp and always served hot and the inside is soft with the best quality bhetki! I don't like fish personally but even I can't resist their quick bites once in a while. Will have to go back soon, just writing this review is making me hungry!

I simply can not believe I have not reviewed Apanjan yet! Apanjan is legendary and I have been having their fries since my school days. Located in kalighat this place has been serving up quality stuff since ages and even today the quality of their products is top notch.It is extremely popular among the locals and for good reason too.

The place is small with facility for takeaway or stand and eat only.But still you will find it is crowded almost each and every afternoon.The Fish fry and the Fish Kabiraji are the most popular products here and they are simply superb.The fish fry here is one of the best you will get anywhere in town.The fillet of fish they use is incredibly thick.The quality of the fish used is also extremely good making all the fish preparations extra special.The Mutton keema cutlet is another of my favourites here.The nicely chopped minced mutton pieces fried to perfection is an absolute delight.The kabirajis are light and crsip and really good.They also have simple dim er devil,fish chop,radha ballavi etc which are decent too.

The staff are quite friendly and swift and in spite of the rush they do a commendable job.The only issue with this place is the price.The prices have increased considerably over the years and at present it is quite steep for a small stand and eat eatery.e.g.the fish fries are priced at around 120 bucks.But then the sheer quality of their products is enough to satisfy the customers.

Apanjan is one of the pretty old Bengali snack shops which has successfully maintained its quality even today.The prices might have gone up but the quality is there for all to see.For me this one of the best places for fish fry and fish kabiraji in all of Kolkata and it is surely worth recommending.

Very very good takeaway joint in South Calcutta.. I always believed that the Chop Cutlet culture is a predominantly a North Calcutta affair... with gems like Allen, Mitra Cafe, Kalika and many more... but few places like Apanjan and Bijoli Grill still serves great snacks at quite low prices... I had the Fish Kachori which is very tasty and unique... the Fish fry, cutlets and pakoras are perfect evening snacks... Everything out here sells out pretty quick.. and there's always a small queue of people at this place..

To the place that needs no introduction in the world of Fast foods, i found Apanjan a very authentic takeaway joint,

Fish Fry - authentic Bhetki with a very thin crust that covers it, the fry is just delicious
Mutton Breast Cutlet - Absolute stunner, just loved it. It was served hot and crispy and was too good in taste.

Surprisingly, they do not serve you the food stuff with any spoon or fork but just in a plate on a white paper/tissue. I guess tasting your fingers while enjoying the food is the reason they do not provide you the spoon/fork :P

Will keep on coming back to taste the rest of the items!!

Recommended to me by one of my closest friend... i thought to give it a try once i am in the vicinity.
In a quiet thursday noon... after a long haul in the city and with two hungry stomach aching for some muchies, me and my wife ... decided to taste some stuff from Apanjan. It was after 1 pm so.. the road should be entered from the Kalighat side. Parked my vehicle on the left side. The shop is just few buildings after Bijoli Grill. And few buildings before Tapan Theatre.Enough with the position... lets get back to business.
Its a Takeaway counter as i saw from outside.
An oversized menu card was on the wall like a poster.
Many items were displayed in the glass shelf.
Pretty confused about what to order...i decided to go by my wife's choice.
chicken leg kabiraji, an oversized fish fry,(there are 3 sizes of fish fry )and a fish kabiraji. Couldnt try mutton coz that was a thursday.
Anyway , after a few moments of eager wait.... there came out delicacies from inside.Boy! Totally dripping in Oil.
But looked too good.
Had a first bite ... and then felt the pain of having a Fireball on the tongue.It was so hot.Managed it anyhow.
After i settled for some more... realised these-
Taste -10/10
Consistency-9/10
Freshness-10/10
Health-5/10 ( it was definitely oily ) One suggestion- carry tissue papers - soak some oil and then have it.
Aroma-11/10 (:-D)
Quantity-10/10
Cost- A little Pocket heavy
All total was Rs330/- for 3 items.
Loved every bite of them. And filled up tummies pretty fast owing to the high oil content.
The fish was awesome and i should say it was real bhetki fry with the distinct aroma.It was pretty big.
Chicken was totally succulent .
I was satisified i should say....Next time would like to try out the "fish kachuri".
Definitely recommended.

I have never offered 5/5 even to the most amazingly stylish and upbeat places I have rated here. Then why 5/5 for this? Simple - It is a stunner. An uncle of mine told me that the first time he went here was in the early 80s when he was in his teens! The size of the place has not changed. Honestly, when I stood outside this really quaint joint, I shrugged off my uncle's emotions and thought what can these guys possible make out of this space. Absolutely zero ambience, no place to sit, and bang in the middle of nowhere. I even thought of cancelling the plan and going elsewhere. But, then I tried it out! My goodness! Perhaps this place tells you the tale of Kolkata - the best things here are the most simple! (just like Baul music or any contemporary artwork) I was awestruck at my first bite of Fish Pasinda. Packed 15 Fish Chops too! Went back to my uncle and told him, "I did not eat. I had an experience." Might well end up to be my most frequented place in the city. I bet it will be!

This tiny joint located on Sadananda Road, near Kalighat Metro Station, never fails to satisfy my taste buds.. They serve lip smacking fish fries,chops and all other so called unhealthy typical Bengali snacks.No. You wont find much variety!neither will u appreciate the decor..They dont even have chairs to sit ..Bt nonetheless, foodies flock round the shop everyday and during peak hours, u need to wait..But I would happily do that given the quality of food..The fish fry as mentioned in other coments is heavenly..It uses pure Vetki,not bassa. The fish chop is also something unique,so are the cutlets..It also serves few veg items, bt nvr tried that..

Even a few months back I used to recommend this place for the best fish fry in town. Certainly not anymore, coz my recent visit had a bad experience. When you pay 130 for a fry, the least you would expect is stale fish but this was the case. It smelled stinky. Currently,I would choose Sankar's fry or Mitra cafe above this place...

A small uninteresting looking simple space located just opposite to tapan theatre in kalighat...this place serves the best street food in the town!!
U prolly won't look at it or walk past it unknowingly, like I did for years. But mistakenly if one day u try out the food from here, I bet, no matter what, u will come again n again to this place!!
What they sell?
Nothing new, age old fish fry, kobiraji cutlet, chicken leg cutlet, mutton breast cutlet, fish n chips, fish fingers, chicken cutlet, mutton singara, dalpuri etc...
Basically, as per Bengali concept they are essentially unhealthy Bengali junk foods.
But then, eat as much as u want from here, unless u have real digestive problems, I bet you won't feel any problem with the food. Such is the quality of food served here.
The taste of it....well they serve real bhekti fillet for their fish fry, cutlet, fingers etc. The real deal, no Bombay bhekti or stuffs like that. The hot freshly cooked fish fry will just melt in your mouth. U won't have to chew even, its so tenderly n perfectly fried. The mutton breast cutlet is pure poetry, soft juicy tender piece of mutton freshly fried n served for u. U will just say its awesome n try to blow air in ur mouth cos its very hot but u will want to bite a large piece of it again. I can go all day long abt their ever other dish. All of them are yummy...but the above 2 are my top of the list items.
I one day discovered it...I wish I had known this place like from my birth. But better late than never.
This place essentially is one of the flavours of kolkata. Providing best street foods in south Kolkata.
PS its costlier than ur paras' regular chop roll centre. But its worth every penny spend here.

UPDATE:
Visited today, like any other day, but today I managed to click some pics....thank god I was not too hungry today!!
It is a true #hiddengem !!

Apanjan....This is a vintage bengali shop selling authentic fries, mughlai, chops, cutlets etc. I have gone by this shop so many times but never thought of giving it a try. Partly because the decor did not attract me at all...and partly because the price was way too high. Finally gave it a try today because my girl told me that this is a very popular place. A crowd was there ordering, eating and taking away items. We ordered one chicken fry and two egg chops, though she was hellbent on the mughlai. Coming to the food.. IT. WAS. AWESOME. The chicken fry was yummmmyyyy... The chicken was tender, juicy and perfectly fried. We loved it. The egg chop was delocious as well. The mustard sauce was awesome as well. Highly recommended. Looking forward to visit again and try more of their items.

This popular outlet is at Nale Jhole, the 3rd Dumdum Food Festival. Having previously tasted their items at the Kalighat outlet itself, I and R decided to satisfy our taste buds by their delicious savouries. We ordered a Chicken Dumsum roll and a Mutton Egg Devil. Surprisingly their stall wasn't crowdy at all and we got our stuff within a few minutes. The Chicken Dumsum roll came in four pieces and each and every piece was heavenly. The chicken bits inside were succulent and so soft and moist. We both simply loved it. I didnt like the devil though, the filling inside tasted like those of samosas with a little hint of mutton here and there.

A typical bong way  to reach heaven. This is very small shop selling Kolkata favourites. The quality of food is excellent.And to maintain that the prices are quite steep. To me their fish items are best in south kolkata. Problem is every item finishes fast. If available try fish kochuri. At Rs15 pp its just heavenly. The fish roll . Then kabiraji.Or fish orly. Every item finger licking.

The outlet is literally a hole in the wall. But the food is nothing short of great.
Besides all sorts of fried snacks, you can also have a filling mutton moghlai parota with spicy aloo curry. 
The prices may seem to be on the higher side. The price of a fish fry may buy you a plate of biriyani elsewhere. But the food here is still value for money. The fish and meat don't have too many layers of batter and crumbs like most of other roadside outlets. There's lots of fish and meat in each item. So you do get what you pay for.
One word of caution - don't be late! The outlet sells out pretty soon.

This popular outlet is located nearby the "Tapan Theater" in sadananda road nearby kalighat temple. It is a very small joint, running for ages now. They specializes in various fried mouth waterinf savories like egg devil, egg chop, fish fry, fish finger, chicken cutlet, chicken pakora, mutton breast cutlet, kabiraji kutlet, chicken leg fry etc; it always stays cluttered with people eagerly waiting in a queue for their turn to place their order. Temptation of the tantalizing aroma of their offerings won't let you pass by this joint without crashing into this joint to satisfy your cravings. "Apanjan" is one of the best places in town to indugle yourself to the best quality fried savories.

The outlet serves one of the best fish fries that I have tried in recent days. This one is so famous that we had re-routed our way to home in order to cross this and have a quick bite. We stopped our car right on the opposite side of the shop. One of my friend went and placed the order, came back with plates of large fish fry. To me the quantity of fish is ample and the crust is thin - which summarizes the quality of the item. It was hot and tasted really good. Will definitely try it out again sometime in near future.

For fish based typical Bengali snack lovers, Apanjon is peerless.................. nowhere else will one get such Fish Fries, Fish Chops , Fingers and the like .................. the quality of the fish used by them is better than all others I have ever tasted    and in my opinion that makes the main difference.
 
While there is a high chance of your finding all the favourite items out of stock as early as 630 in the evening, it makes sense to go early and even wait for log on the pavement, rather than go back disappointed..........

Don't be decieved by the looks of this tiny place.Anybody who has spent some time around Hazra/Rashbehari knows this place well,though it might be hard to locate for people who are not frequent visitors of this locality.
I first came across this place during my college life and have been visiting since. The radhaballavis and fish kachoris they make are fantastic and its tough to get them if one doesn't reach the shop by 4:30pm. Their veg and chicken chops are good too. Besides,they serve really good cutlets and fish fry,arguably one of the best in Kolkata,if not THE best!!! They are heavy and leave little place for any thing else in your stomach. The food quality goes in line with their pricing. People happily gobble down the contents on their plates and pack food for home here every evening(In fact some keep thronging the shop from as early as 3pm!!). 
The guys serving or cooking here make sure to wear caps(a rule that no other such shops around choose to follow) and the shop is a pretty clean one. I remember them once replacing the fry ordered by an elderly couple,which they complained about. Overall-good food,nice service,clean kitchen makes this shop a great visit.

Have tried this place a couple of times. Small takeaway. Very east to miss. Its right after Bijoligrill outlet. Everytime I have their Fish Fry. Its really really nice. Perfect quantity of fish inside. The batter is not very thick (though Oh Calcutta fish fries are the best I have had). The good thing is that the fish, which is Bhetki (not bhola bhetki), does not smell. Its fresh. The special fish fry costs Rs. 130.

The fish finger is decent. Not the best I have had though. 

Give it a try. Will update once I had their meat dishes.

This is a small take away place on Sadananda Road, which runs parallel to the main SP Mukherjee Road running northwards from Rashbehari. It's in the Rashbehari neighborhood and a small walk from Tapan Theatre. If you're anywhere remotely near to the area, I'd suggest you to drop in. 

 There's no place to sit although you can always grab a bite standing. The main claim to fame for this establishment is the variety of chicken, mutton and egg dishes in all their fried and sizzling glory. With items called " Franky Chicken " ( Chicken encrusted in layers of Bhetki fish ) and " Gold coins " ( Egg fried within a round enclosure of golden hued chicken ), this place is sure to draw you. The items are lip smacking. However it is advised that cholesterol freaks and health buffs give the place a miss for obvious reasons. Everything is deep fried in oil. 
Hygiene is maintained. The wait time is a bit long since there's always a crowd. The prices are average with quite a few items in the Rs. 25 - 45 bracket.

Chakraborty Tip : You need to queue up at the store just after it opens around 5:30 -6 in the evening. Most items on the menu go missing soon due to a large demand and the unavailability of proper display or storage space.

My dada (bro) had first introduced me to Apanjan from that time "Apanjan" is my favourite food joint in South kolkata... Its been ruling the street foods from ages now. 
A small shop serving mouth watering street food. They're enormously popular that's why always have to wait in the queue with a barely standing space , its always crowded all day long. 
When ever i visit i try out their best of the best speciality - fish kabiraji,fish butter fry,fish kachuri,fish fry,chicken cutlet, mutton cutlet,mutton chop...Yummm 
I love pretty much all of their items. 
However do lined up early evening for their foods as because they sold out in the blink of an eye.

Apanjan is quite a famous fast food outlet for all the college students surrounding this area..It remains always crowded at the afternoons and evenings..Being one of such college student i have explored almost all of their items.. More or less all the fish items are good with the fish fry and fish pakora the most recommended and are also consumed on large numbers.. Some other good picks would be chicken and mutton kabiraji , fish orly..The food might not be that healthy but it is obviously damn tasty.. So foodies - What r u waiting for?

For people who have spent their childhood in Hazra and the surroundings, Apanjan is quite a landmark .... The look of the shop it pretty deceptive.... In fact people overlook it and don't know what they have missed .... 

The star of this small shop is its fish fry .... The fillet is thick and juicy and perfectly cooked ... there ratio of fish to crumb is just right 

Also the next hero is the Fish roll :  used to be a Allen's lover for fish roll but this has outdone it ... solely because of the quality of fish is much better .... 

Both these dishes sell like hot cakes and one might have to queue up... and the best thing about them is that they done smell even slightly fishy .

I also like the vegetable chops here ... they are pretty decent too .... The egg devil is good but the egg chop is pretty lame ... people swear by the kobiraji ... but not one of their strengths....

So a few days ago, I was out to a friend's place, and he had ordered food from Apanjan, which is pretty close to his place. He had ordered fish roll and chicken kabiraji, and the food was fresh and very tasty. Although not piping hot, it was still quite warm when it reached me, and I have to say, the kabiraji was very good, and so was the fish roll. In fact, we had just ordered one of each, and after eating just half of these things, both of us were pretty full!

Don't misjudge the enormous popularity of this place by the look of it ..... its tiny with barely standing room and often so many people lined up outside that you can barely see the shop just the sign above ..... BUT they serve out some brilliant stuff ! If your diet conscious and watch your weight then this one is not for you but if you are a true blue foodie like me who will pretty much go anywhere anyplace as long as the grub is good then line up guys ! Chicken Cutlet , Mutton Chop, Fish Orly , Fish Fry , Fish Chop Chicken and Mutton Kabiraj are all yummy. However please line up early evening because they are sold out in the blink of an eye. A lovely evening snack for one and all !

The best "real" bhetki fish fry in Kolkata - thick pure slabs and very thin crusting - best to be bought without frying and take home to fry and serve hot.

You need to go before 7 pm, because by then - the fish fry is all over. I found 6 pm the best time to go and collect. Other stuff worth it are fish roll - though a bit spicy for me.

i have been hearing about it since my childhood from my father who used to live in sadananda road during his school days. i tried to buy something from this place but failed on two occassions due to the crowd. it is so popular that materials get finished even before it is 7pm. on the third occassion i was lucky enough to  get their chicken cutlet n fish fry.
the cutlet is the best in kolkata. even better than dilkhusa's. but i think they should increase their capacity. lovely little  treat very true to one of the oldest areas of kolkata

‘Finger licking good’ is the only phrase that comes to my mind while writing about Apanjan. I specially love the chicken cutlet from this place. You may find it a little over priced while buying but once you bite into the thick juice slab of chicken you will not regret paying the extra bucks.  The chicken and mutton kabiraji too cannot be ignored. If you like a thick slab of fish you may try fish roll, fish kabiraji or orly. You can also try the chicken / mutton or fish chop from this place. It is easy on pocket and great to taste. Egg chop, non veg singrara, chicken pakoras too are good. 
The place is tiny, in fact you may miss it while passing by. One good tip for find this place would be while going towards Kalighat temple from Sadananda road look for  for a small queue / crowd in front of a tiny stall selling chop-cutlet on the left side... Yes, this place is always crowded, which says a lot about the quality of food and taste. But the service is prompt.

Overpriced food. Although they serve solid amounts of fish in their fish fries, still they are really overpriced. And, once you start eating, it feels monotonous after a while to chew all that fish. 

Its better to add spices of all kind, which they don't. I have tasted better and cheaper fish fries at Fry Corner, Triangular Park and Great Taste, Ballygunje.

the quality of food has degraded tremendously and so the attitude of the staff .... price is too high according to the food  quantity.... its bttr to try for bijoligrill fast food which has opened recently close to this shop just two mins walking distance .

A small over-the-counter food joint. No dine-in available. But it has some of the best of street food in South Kolkata. Fish fry, fish butter fry, cutlets, kabiraji..... They make it pretty awesome. There is generally a crowd in front of this small wall-eatery. I recommend.

Ohh... of course, they don't accept cards.

Overpriced food. Although they serve solid amounts of fish in their fish fries, still they are really overpriced. And, once you start eating, it feels monotonous after a while to chew all that fish. 

Its better to add spices of all kind, which they don't. I have tasted better and cheaper fish fries at Fry Corner, Triangular Park and Great Taste, Ballygunje.

its really one of the best street foods corner in Kolkata. But little coastly in comparison with others street foods stalls. still its coast worths. The most amazinz stuff of Apanjan is chicken samosa. its just mind blowing..
