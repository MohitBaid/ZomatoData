The experience was not so good. The place has an interesting interior but i would say they should focus on lighting a bit . When we entered  it was hot we requested to switch on the ac after that they switched it on. Krongy crispy chicken(mostly this was the name) it was a bit spicy for people who do not prefer spicy staff but it was damn tasty i loved it. We tried the nachos which was good too. The chicken nuggets was extremely bad may be they used frozen nuggets which tastes bad and very unhealthy as well. Won't recommend to give it a try. We didn't try the shisha though so cannot comment on that.

I live exactly 200 metres from this place. Wanted to visit but after seeing this thread cancelled that plan. If you visit Peter Cat's page, you will find 1* reviews over there as well, but the only difference is you won't find owners criticizing the reviews directly, abusing and downtalking someone. Shameful act by the owners.

I didn't like the ambience. The food is okayish. Tried crispy chicken and also a shisha. It's a place for shisha lovers. I am definitely not one. The washroom is too small.

Cafe 80's is a decent place to spend some time with your friends and family. Food is good enough and they will allow to sit and have a good time without any intervention

North Calcutta's first Retro Cafe..a super cool place to hang out with your friends and family. Excellent ambience and service and amazing food. Mixed sauce Pasta and Crispy Chili Babycorn are a must try. A must visit.

Being a regular at Cafe 80s all I can say is that everything about it is  really good..The ambience is good! So is the food, drink and staff behaviour : music is nice. The price of food is worthful comparing to the other cafes, the quantity of the  food is also nice. They also serve hookahs which is fantastic  as there is no place in the area which serves it.

An average place, both decor and food wise. Ordered a shake, a starter and hookah ( can't remember the names exactly ). All were okayish.
Hookah was good though.

Well i shouldn't even rate it one..
The cafe is a small place ..Near binayak enclave..
Dumdum..sinthi more..
I had tried the CHICKEN white sauce pasta..
There was hardly any or zero chicken..
I had to tell them..as i asked them that i ordered chicken white sauce pasta..bt its veg..
Then The owner came and he took the pasta plate in his hand and just said "khaa ke bataya ya dikha de"
And he was trying to show the chicken which wasn't there..while doing that he dropped some of the food..
Instead of being apologetic for his behaviour towards the customer he showed his attitude towards us..
Well doesnt really matter how is your food as there are plenty of cafes with the same taste..
It's the behaviour which counts!
I would recommend not to go there.because we are paying for the food..and no one can treat a customer like that...as the owner really needs to know how to talk to his customers..

Really loved it. Food is very reasonable and quality is also A1. The ambience, decor, service is also satisfying. It's the best place to chill out with friends and throw b'day parties. P.s :- Good food at best price is all cafe 80's is about.
