Went there the other day,  the ambience is nice well decorated and painted also it has a nice cosy feeling, ordered hot and sour soup it was nice, however slightly sweet. Tried the Hakka chow fried rice and garlic chicken, food was good but nothing worth raving about. Prices are reasonable and the service is fine.

Tried it once when i went to my friend's place in kalighat after reading all the positive reviews in Zomato. Really an authentic chinese restaurant which serves excellent momos. Chilli chicken is a must try and steamed pork momo is really delicious. Fried spring chicken was a let down though. A very small eatery which doesn't even deliver food. Will try their main course items the next time.

Quaint old Chinese takeaway.Has its own style you will remember the Chinese cuisine of the 1980 s . Typical Tirreti bazar school of cooking. Fairly pocket friendly.

Not good at all. I had ordered teriyarki chicken. It really tasted like ordinary chilli chicken. Very dissapointed. Especially those who have tasted teriyarki chicken in other south east asian countries
 You'll be thoroughly dissapointed.Hope they do better. Thanks !!!

Located near Gariahat

A congested place.

The food is good but not very good and the quantity is not good but not bad

We ordered Fried Rice, cantonese Noodles, schezwan chicken and Chilli Duck.

The duck was over fried but the rest seemed good to the tongue.

In love with the meifoon and gobbled it once again. And anyone visiting this restaurant must try out the lamb and the Teriyaki fish , its a bit salty however....Cheers  and enjoy !!!!

Never had food sitting there as there is hardly any space to sit comfortably - 'n' number of times our staple parcel included Veg Hakka Noodles, Chilli Potato & Garlic Chicken...really don't remember how many times we have taken the same set of dishes packed for our dinner - it always tasted the same (tasty of course & less oily).

Quantity is enough for dinner for 3 people...considering the quantity, you would find this place quite economic.

You also get various sauces & chop-sticks to purchase at this outlet...
