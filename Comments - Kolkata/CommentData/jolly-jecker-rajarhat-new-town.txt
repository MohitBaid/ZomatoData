Good for home delivery. The price is a bit high but the quality of food is good. Could be a good option to dine once in a while.The chicken based dishes are the best ones. To summarize, it's an average food joint in terms of all essential parameters including quality of food, service and value for money.

Tasty food and friendly staff. great for take out as seating is very limited. their Chicken Jolly Tangy and Rolls are a must have. They have recently started with breakfast options of kachori sabzi, idis and dosas which is a big relief on weekends.

They used to serve surprisingly good idlis and dosas on weekends but lately have fallen a good few notches both in quality and the variety of available items. Ditto for the afternoon snacks. Haven't tasted their lunch or dinner for quite sometime.

Not great. I tried the non - veg thali, liked the chicken, but not the sabzi and paneer! The menu doesn't offer a lot of options, and the food isn't worth the prices!

ITS ABOUT JOLLY JECKER GROUP SHOP IN UNI WORLD CITY WHICH IS GROCERY SHOP AND SUPPLEMENT SERVICES GIVEN LIKE MILK , NEWSPAPER OFFER SERVICES WHICH IS VERY RUDE AND PATHETIC , ALL RESIDENTS ARE AWAITING FOR OPTION TO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN NEARBY VICINITY . AS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CUSTOMER FOCUS BUSINESS , THEY SHOW THEIR  TEETH AS NO ONE IS OPERATING INSIDE PREMISES . MONOPOLY IS GONE HIGH HEADED INTO PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING THE SHOW ON DAILY BASIS LIKE MR AJAY KUMAR WHO TALKS RUDE DON'T HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING OF CUSTOMER ISSUES , BEHAVE ERRATIC AND IGNORE CUSTOMERS COMPLAINTS AND DON'T EVEN TAKE IT IN HIS AGENDA TO IMPROVE , RATHER HE BEHAVES AS IF HE IS DOING CHARITY BY EVEN TALKING IN THAT MANNER . SLIPPAGE ARE HUGE IN SERVICES AND WHEN SOME ONE COMPLAINT TO HIM HE TAKES IT SO LIGHTLY AS IF NOTHING HAS HAPPENED AND IGNORE IT COMPLETELY . SO I CAN ONLY SAY CUSTOMER ARE AT HIS MERCY . BUT I AM SURE IF SOME ONE COME UP WITH EVEN BASIC FOCUS OF CUSTOMERS FIRST AND KEEP QUALITY PRODUCT CAN KILL THEM COMPLETELY AND BRING THEM ON THIS HOLY EARTH WHERE THEY START RESPECTING CUSTOMERS WHICH I SNOT AT ALL IN THEIR AGENDA AT THE MOMENT

Today I was with my wife & a family friend at  my D'ter's place & we had a heart ful lunch on home delivery . Garlic Nan, Butter Nan, rice , Matar Mushroom & yellow Dal Butter Fry ( arhar dal, rare in Kolkata but my Fav.) & Chicken Kasha .  Foods ,were tasty & portion were more than enough . Whenever we are at Uniword city, we are always get food from there & we've the same taste and they are delicious. Total bill is very pocket friendly I.e. quite reasonable though they have increased the rate by 20-25% ,but not compromised with quality & portions.

Jooly (or Jolly?) Jecker is Uniworld City’s in house restaurant for when you are not in the mood to cook, head out or spend a fortune. Given your long list of constraints, I guess the food here serves your purpose :) I have ordered roti and subzi from here multiple times and not once did I find the food less than passable. Are my expectations low? Indeed and as they should be. This is neither memorable nor outstanding food but on a rainy day, it is not bad at all. I recommend palak paneer and paneer matar. Expect a bill of Rs.300 for a meal for 2.
