Their chicken bharta and egg tarka are my favourites of all time..although i would really visit this place more often if my favourite dish palak paneer would be available..each time i go there i ask for palak paneer and they say its not available

Located near the petrol pump in ballygunge phari.This is a small outlet for fast food. Rolls of this place are average. The chicken curries like chicken butter masala and chicken bharta are nice. Ambience is poor.

I Have Visited 25th Time To This Little Joint StopOver, Ballygunge Phari Location: Near Samsung And UBER Showroom And Near Petrol Pump As Well.

Thank you StopOver For Making My Day Fantastic.😄😄

Been to this place long ago in my childhood days when my Aunty use to live here at Ballygunge phari. I have some memories with this place as well when i use to come here with my elder bro. They serve some very good rolls, before they use to be a complete restaurant which served quite decent Non veg food items but now they have restricted themselves to just rolls.

Grabbed a couple of keema type rolls from here on the go as we were super hungry but late to an appointment 😛 the roll was pretty good, generously stuffed and very filling, if a tad oily maybe. Overall not a bad roll and I might stop again if on the way.

I have been having the rolls since my school days. The rolls taste great. Quality is nice and they maintain hygiene. They have been running in the same way since ages.

Just beside Ballygunge Phari petrol pump and Kolapuri Centre...
Used to visit regularly during college days while returning from tutions...
Love their Chicken Rolls as the parathas are soft fried in adequate amount of oil and the Chicken chunks were juicy and marinated well...
We also used to have Chowmein and Chicken Kassa with Parathas or Rumali Rotis...
Nostalgic about this place...
Remember gulping Fuchkas after Rolls just on the same foot...

I have lots of childhood and teenage memories associated with this place as me and my sister always rushed to this place when in Kolkata during vacations.

Located very conveniently at the heart of Ballygunge Phari,this is a very old outlet.I have hardly seen staff getting replaced over the decades.

There is nothing fancy associated with place but the food is really good and exceptionally economical.They make great rolls,tadka,paratha,roomali roti etc and also serve meals during lunch time.

We keep coming here for their egg tarka and paratha. A joint which lives up to the saying - "looks can be deceptive". It might look like a bit shabby but hell, the food is damn good! 
And I can vouch for it. The egg tarka for only 40 bucks is a steal. Teaming it with paratha makes a sumptuous dinner. 
Very very reasonable! And the rolls are good too. 
Happy eating!

I've only tried their rolls but I absolutely love them. My go to comfort food is their egg chicken roll. 
Only that,there's almost always a huge rush,many already waiting for their orders,so it takes quite some time. Would like to see atleast one more person helping out the lone one in the roll section.

It's a small shabby eatery near ballygunge phari. Basically it is a snacks corner where you can get tasty and cheap food. A popular destination for students of Ballygunge science college and Hazra law college.

Nothing too great. But not bad either. I would have liked to give it a 2.75, if it was possible.
The rolls are good.
The parathas are good.
The noodles are only like a roadside chow-er dokaan (chow stall).
The gravy noodles however taste good and are very filling too.
It is in a very congested area and eating inside is not at all recommended with all the sound and pollution and crowds of people.
But do not take the rolls home. They become dry and hard that way.
Expect a minimum waiting time of 15mins during rush hours.
Like i said, I recommend
# Their rolls

I went there once only with my friends. We have ordered egg chowmin, The place is just beside the road and nothing special about it's dining place. The chowmin was not boiled enough properly and the vegetables had a weird smell. So it was still less prepared. Very poor quality.

The name of the restaurant is really very significant. College students, office goers stop there for lunch. Reasonable price. Rice, roti, chicken, tarka are few common dishes.

This place had been only good memories to me.... I remember I tadted my 1st Chicken Chaap n Rumali Roti there....those who are looking for luxury dinning experience... Sorry ud b dissapointed. But those who want to eat good food for dirt cheap price...this is the place. I eould blindly recommend there egg potato rolls,egg chicken rolls and their chicken bharta are a delight to have. I am not a big fan of their tikkas as they are very dry....but for me the winner is their paneer sashlik roll.

I visit this place every Sunday. Well almost every Sunday. Not because its good but because its convenient. Every Sunday, irrespective of the weather my friends and I play cricket. Once we are through we have an 'adda' session. Summer means beers and winter means rum. But we nees to eat something too. Something cheap and something not too heavy. They don't make the best rolls here but the chicken or mutton rolls from Stop Over serve the purpose because they are relatively cheap and its situated close to my house. The kebabs rolled in the paratha taste good but the paratha itself is pretty ordinary. If you happen to be hungry and if you are passing by Kolapuri Centre at Ballygunge Phari and if you need a quick bite stop over at Stop Over. But for an average roll mind you!

Had Egg Chow and 7up :P Tasted great with the sauces :D
It was served sizziling hot with adequate amount of egg :) Had a nice time as I was damn hungry :P
The bill was Rs.96/- for 2 Egg chows and 2 cold drinks :) Value for Money Indeed :P

We the students of Hazra Law College have a habit of visiting this place. I went there yesterday with 4 more friends :)
We decided to have some egg-potato rolls to satisfy our hunger :P
The rolls were nicely prepared(though oily) but the stuffing of egg and potato was just magical :D Its yummy and very much fills your tummy. I am a petuk so had 2 egg potato rolls, my friends ordered egg potato rolls and chicken rolls. The chicken roll is though not that tasty.
The bill is very much pocket friendly for college goers and I wont change my ratings for this restaurant :)

Do visit for having some quick rolls :D Enjoy :)

----- 28 Jan, 2014 -----

Stopover an important place for the foodies of Hajra Law college. Me being the same, visit this takeaway roll joint almost the other day.
The chicken roll,egg roll and very spcl egg potato roll(egg roll stuffed with boiled potato) are some of the favourites if u are in a hurry.
And if u want to dine, lol i never had the opportunity to have rice in lunch :( but the parathas are good with chicken bharta or roti tarka also rocks when u are hungry.
Its never a must visit but one can try the rolls for sure :)

This diner is very easy to locate on Ballygunge Phari bus stop. This ancient looking diner furnishes with very few wooden settings, take two or three steps and you will bang into end wall. But they also cater rolls in their take away counter. 

One of my Amigos has been their food follower throughout since as a student in school, so he described me most of the items on the menu. So when I got there first to consume a fair chunk of food during my firing hunger. When I rested my belief on gravy noodles, my friend was happy enough to order Dal Tadka and Rotis. It took some while to see our food on tables. My ordered dish did look handsome in plates, when I took the first gulp of it. I was saying to myself, “Being a non-Chinese they made good out of the ingredients.” But when began to eat third fourth gulp, the heaviness of food rocking in my stomach. The stickiest gravy was not complimenting the noodles, when the stomach decline to go any further, I stopped right there. But out of curiosity, I have tasted my friend’s dish, Dal Tadka which was a marvelous blend of spices. 

Their roll counter has few varieties, but they sell good rolls. One of my friends has his favorite, Potato Egg roll, in which you will a fare amount of smash potato swelling in an egg paratha wrap. 

On the subject of servicing, they score A grade in my score board. The waiter who has been there for a decade now is humble and always welcomes you with a bright smile.

The two selling points for Stop Over are as follows - a) Its right in front of an important bus stop. b) The smell of freshly cooking eggs. I am always sold on freshly cooking eggs, and the egg rolls they make here, particularly, is very good. Also, unlike most other places where I actually tell people to not add sauce to my roll, with this particular eatery, I go the completely other way round and ask them to put a lot of sauce on my egg roll. They also make a nice chicken roll but the egg roll is what I come back here for. Service is quite fast, and the person who takes in the order is a brisk, no-nonsense fellow.

This place is more of a 'take-away' food joint type and NOT your regular family restaurant. It is frequented by folks looking for a quick bite like - rolls, etc. This is a dingy looking place. I have not tried their sit-in option, and hardly you would find anyone dining there - since the place where the tables are needs bit of tidying up!

I have tried the wide varieties of rolls there and they are quite tasty and nice on your pocket. Even the plain 'tadka' and egg 'tadka's are quite tasty. They make chow-mein too and I would suggest going for the 'veg hakka chow' as I didn't find their 'egg hakka chow' very tasty. I have even tried their gravy chow-mein and that was moderate in taste. Chicken Bharta is quite good and goes well with the rumali-rotis there.

I would only recommend this place for various rolls and for take-away side-dishes like chicken bharta, 'tadka', etc. - other than that I didn't find anything worth mentioning.
