Very disappointed with there food. Alibaba food is getting worse day by day. Ordered food from here, Chicken & Mutton Biryani, Butter Nun, Pees Polaw, Chicken Reshmi Butter Mashala, Murg Tikka Makhni. The biryani was bad both chicken and mutton, mutton pice was very stiff and tasteless. The taste of Biryani and Polaw was very bad. Only the side dishes ware well. Overall the quality and quantity were unexpectedly bad.

They seem to have made it a policy of passing rotten food for parcel orders. Today I ordered for Chicken Biriyani (parcel) and when I opened the box at home, I found the rice has completely melted! Rs.180/- wasted. 
Previously when they used to sell rolls (now they don't in the DLF outlet), I ordered for Chicken roll (parcel), when I opened the packing at home, I found it to be Egg roll! 
I am not going back again!

This review is about the outlet in DLF IT Park, New Town, Rajarhat.

If you are hungry and have a taste for biriyani, please stay clear from this place. The biriyani is probably probably cooked somewhere else and ported to this outlet. One should expect to get served cold biriyani and hot cold drinks during peak hours. In a word the taste of any biriyani is "pathetic".

The other food items are marginally better and to be taken only if one runs out of choice. This joint enjoys the location within a office campus with no worthy competitor around. The value for money is as low as the rating.

The outlet has around 6 or 7 tables. During peak hunger hours one must share the table with strangers. No comments on the service. The food will reach once the turn comes and the clock turns significantly.

This outlet located in rajarhat new town, inside DLF IT Park.  A small place with good ambiance. Ordered food from here to deliver at Office. First of all, the food was delivered late. And after opening the food at office cafeteria we were panicked. We ordered Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala, Butter Naan, and Green Salad. Tadoori Butter Masala was tasteless and was smelling like stale, Butter Naan was very hard. And in Green Salad they have provided only Onions, Lemon & Green Chili. Is this a Green Salad?... We just got shocked. Not recommend this store for Home delivery.

So i went to this Alibaba joint located inside DLF IT Park 1 at Newtown , Rajarhat . The food was very ordinary ; the service was poor ; we were sitting there for ages and the attendants were just not interested in serving the food ; it was almost like they knew that the food was bad and wanted to spare us the trouble . Anyway , enough said . Visit this place if and only if you have completely run out of options.

This place don't need any introduction, famous for its mughlai dishes, though with time it loosing its charm! This outlet located in rajarhat new town. ¬†A small place , with good ambiance. ¬†Ordered mutton biryani ¬†with mutton bhuna gosth and firni. Service was little bit slow took more than half an hour to serve. Biryani cooked well, but didn't like bhuna gosth, too much spicy and oily. Firni was really really taste. Pocket pinch reasonable.

A day at client's office doesn't seems to spicy up if you aren't getting treated with Biryani. With this thought in mind, I have planned to place an order for lunch at Only Alibaba.

Opening the site of Zomato, it hardly took me half a minute to scroll down the menu and find the desired stuff to order. The restaurant at my location was showing a 45min time banner which was considerate, but, on successful placement of order the time lapse increased two folds to 90min. Whether this is a glitch on the part of restaurant or Zomato is debatable, but, the ultimate sufferer was me.

The delivery guy reached my place in 80min and while I asked him to open up the contents and verify the items, he looked perplexed as if he had no idea what I was talking about. I repeated him, to pinpoint the item and match it with the invoice. Reluctantly, he did that with an emotion of resistance in his face.
¬†
The order consisted of 1 Chicken Biryani (Badshahi Murgh Biryani), 2 Mutton Biryani (Mutton Nawabi Biryani), 3 Firni, 1 Full Plate Tangri Chicken Kabab followed by a plate of Green Salad. Eventually, while sitting for the much awaited lunch, I was extremely disappointed at finding the food to be cold. Yes, the excitement dropped in no time but since the oil in which it was cooked was good, the food was eatable. The Tangri Chicken was devoid of taste and I was utterly bewildered at the salad they provided. The green salad wasn't green from any possible angle and it seemed they provided stuffs of a week's back stuffed in a refrigerator - it was awful to speak the least. However, the Firni tasted good and it was the sole item I ate in full. The whole order of ‚Çπ1059 was utterly a waste with the exception of Firnis costing ‚Çπ50.

Well, the visit is not recommendable!

Not recommended at all but yes comparatively very cheap, so if one finds a tolerable dish in the menu then the experience might be a price valued one but I am not very sure of it still. Chicken bharta and naan is just a no no.

This small food joint of Newtown was discovered by me and my colleagues on a Sunday evening. Although our expedition to this place was not that exciting as we all had expected it to be, the foods were quite good. The ambiance and the service of the staff members were also satisfying. 

We all decided to go for the Chicken Tikka Kabab and Badsahi Murgh Kabab. Both the dishes were quite good in flavor, but the platting of the dishes could be better. All in all, this is quite a good place for you to visit with your pals.

I have had dishes from Only Alibaba since many years ago..during that time the restaurant near Park Circus used to give tough competition to¬† Arsalan and Zeeshan. The dishes were really good, especially the Biryani. Nowadays, they seem to have lost that glory. This time, after a long time, I tried their mutton biryani. The taste was good though not excellent. It had a big piece of mutton which was well cooked but mostly boney. Quantity was decent. The price tag of 215 bucks (with tax, deliv. charge etc.) appears to be a bit above reasonable.

The place was like local streetside outlets with normal seating arrangements, not like verryyy tidy!

DO NOT EVER VISIT THIS OUTLET.
Pathetic service; we were given a table that was partially damaged, just after five minutes the entire glass top collapsed on us. It's a miracle that none among us were injured. So there we sat, drenched in water and foodstuff loitering on the ground, what did the staff do? They graciously offered us another table to sit while they would scrape of the leftovers and then serve the same again. ¬†

No compensation for our suffering, no new plates, not even a single person apologised for the inconvenience! What if the glass shards contaminated the food leftovers? When we refused and moved out they took the entire bill amount from us even though we could not complete 10% of our meal! We complained to the outlet manager Paltu Mukherjee - here also we received a causal and nonchalant response 'Dekhchi' ('we'll see').¬†

SO NEVER GONNA VISIT AGAIN.

This outlet is inside an office building and a good and welcome option for office goers. The best part is the difference between chicken and mutton biryani is only 10 bucks! You can feel the rich smell of ghee in the biriyani, something which is absent in many of its competitors. Good value for money.

There is no room to give a zero here so I had to give 1/5. They take just forever to deliver the food to you. Took more than 3 hours to deliver one biryani. And even if you enquire to the restaurant about the status of your food, they don't give a proper reply.

All in all please never order food from this place.

My office was at DLF IT Park and this was my go to shop for my biryani cravings. This is a minuscule outlet where you never get any place to sit, literally never. But this joint is very popular for takeaways, not much of a dine-in place. Many a times it has happened that i have had biryani from this place more than once a week. Well the biryanis are just plain awesome. Not to oily or masale-dar ; the biryanis are just perfect. A few of the chicken side dishes are also pretty good, but slightly oily.

The visit to this place was kinda long back. I have been here one afternoon for lunch after desperately searching for food. We found this place to be quite awesome and in budget as it offered us with delicious food at a time we were starving.


We ordered the chicken tikka masala, chicken bharta, Moti pulao and green salad and had literally hogged the food at the table asking for repeats for about 3-4 times.

The phirni was our staple desert and please dont mind the picture quality as we were too busy eating. We were 3 people and the bill was about 800 bucks which was unimaginative considering the amount of food we had taken. 

This was the DLF outlet of Alibaba located near the Oval restaurant and KFC counter near Nazrul Tirtha. The staff is super friendly and service was good.

We had ordered via Zomato for Laccha Paranthas, Badshahi Murg Biryani and Murg Tikka Makhani. The Food was good. But the only issue we faced was with the Delivery. We were supposed to get the food delivered by 9:30 pm, we received it (after calling 6-7 times) at 11pm and that too we had to collect from a different point as they were unable to identify the location. The Laccha Paranthas were actually Plain Paranthas, but since it costs Rs.10 only, one can't complain.

Very small place so its always difficult to find a place during lunch hours. Most of the time they are out to nan , etc . I suppose only limited cooking facility they are running the place primarily based on delivery from the cenyral hub.

First of all the delivery was on time, although found the delivery person's attitude a bit annoying.
Now for the food... The plain naan were irresistibly soft.. The chicken bharta was very flavourful and was as imagined... We had ordered chicken tandoori butter masala which had almost Halffff tandoori chicken(which made me a little excessive happy) with the gravy exactly same as that of any butter masala dish...
Overall if I ignore the delivery person out of this, the whole experience was great and a 'Treat to the T-Buds'. HAAPY FOODING...

Favourite joint when I was working out of DLF. I visited this place even on my last visit to Kolkata. Food is good. Biryani is tasty. Quantity is good as well. Indian breads and Kebabs are a bit difficult to get, as they prepare fresh, take longer time and have fixed times for serving these. Rolls are good as well. Overall god economic option in DLF.

Must say they cant maintain their quality always. Sometimes they serves good tasted biriyani. Sometimes equally bad. The main disappointing thing is they mostly don't serve any naan or tandoori rotis. I usually bebome bound to have biriyani if I visit them. I tried their kababs as well. not extra ordinary but good. Evening time they prepares rolls. That also carries good marks. Next thing is their variety is very less.

5th of Feb 2016 went to this particular branch at DLF1 with some 10 other friends....ordered some non-veg and veg dishes as there were some pure veg friends...as a result one of my veg friend found a MUTTON BONE out of the paneer dish that we had ordered and which is supposed to be a veg dish....when informed about the same they did just nothing......their glasses are stincky, as of fresh meat....

Dear Zomato team please donot remove this post as everyone should be aware of this, specially the PURE VEG people.....this is my feedback about this place and should not be removed

I had ordered their food for home delivery so i can't comment on the ambience and service. The delivery was on time. The packaging was good. Coming to the food,  the chicken and mutton biryani tasted good but the quantity was not sufficient enough for one person. Maybe because it was the 25th of December that they decreased the quantity but that's not how it should be, given d price remains unchanged. The nan was soft and tender but the paneer butter masala wasn't up to the mark. It lacked that spark and aroma. Nevertheless, I loved the chicken reshmi kebab pieces which were juicy and delicious. Hope for improvement. :)

I only used their take away service so won't comment on their ambience or service. I had their chicken biriyani and chicken chaap. Most of the items are unbelievable no matter when you go. Food quality also was not at all impressive. Biriyani was very oily and greasy,meat was also not cooked properly. It was very dry. The chicken chaap was anything but chaap! Very overpriced considering the quality of the food. I would not recommend this place.

Food quality- 2/5

Last week we ordered a bulk order of 12 Biriyanis, 1 Pulao and some Kababs for dinner. The food was delivered at 7:30 PM and half an hour later when the Pulao was served, it was completely spoiled. The dinner for all the guests were served at around 10:00 PM and we discovered that 5 Biriyanis were spoiled. Obviously at that point we hurried to make alternate food arrangements and somehow covered the dinner for the guests. Next day we called Ali Baba and let them know this and some of their replies were "We receive the food from our main center" (so it's not them!!!) / "Why did not you call us at the night to let us know". I explained to them when this kind of a situation happens at 10:00 PM in the night with guests waiting for dinner to be served, my first concern was to arrange for alternate food for them rather call Ali Baba for this mess.
I was surprised to see such an apathetic display of service from Ali Baba store..

Overall experience here is perfect for a foodie or may be only biriyani lovers. Just one thing the quantity is a bit less in biriyani should take extra rice to burp;)

Went to this place on a Saturday afternoon during the lunch hours to get our food packed. The place was strikingly empty and had just one customer having his food there. Maybe they were having more home-delivery orders or maybe because since it's located inside an office complex it remains this empty on weekends. But since my tastebuds were badly craving for some good biriyani I had to settle down for Alibaba since there is no other good Mughlai restaurant near Newtown bus stop area.

LOCATION ----- This outlet of Alibaba is located at the Ground floor of DLF building that is beside Najrul Tirtha near Newtown Action area-I. The outlet of Alibaba is located close to the KFC outlet which is also located at this DLF building. You can easily park your car inside the DLF building (sufficient open parking space is available). When you enter the building the security will ask you ‚Äòthe reason of visit‚Äô, you just need to tell them you want to visit Alibaba and they will let you in.

AMBIANCE ----- The place has got a simple interior d√©cor that is not too gaudy yet it‚Äôs just right for the place. I quite liked the simple false ceiling and the lighting up there. The place is not very big and is moderately sized. It has got several four seater tables which are just simple glass-top tables with pretty common aluminium rod based chairs that are quite common in the office canteens. Though the ambiance is quite acceptable I found the best cleanliness was not present there, salt shakers looked quite unhygienic to me.

FOOD ----- Our order was pretty simple. We went in for Badshahi Murgh Biriyani which is the common chicken biriyani with a fancy name. The price was higher when compared to the quality of the food served. The Badshahi or Royal Biriyani had no boiled egg in it. The quality and texture of the potato was not good, maybe the cheaper variant was used, it was boiled so much that it was almost melting while picking it up with spoon, also the taste of the potato was not the best I had tried, infact it was far from that. Previously Alibaba Biriyanis were well-known for its high oil content, but now things have changed, the biriyani was pretty dry and non-greasy. But the quality of the rice can surely be improved. One chicken leg piece was served which was good in size, well marinated and cooked, but was very dry again. Overall the taste of the biriyani was average, though the first bite was pretty pleasing, then the dryness and lack of good ingredients took over. Also we went in for Firni, it was well packed with aluminium foil and served in earthen pot. It was nice to taste, but since I am not very fond of Firnis I actually can‚Äôt comment much on this.

SERVICE ----- The person taking the order was pretty courteous and our take-away order was ready by sharp 5 minutes, very prompt indeed. The price printed on menu card are tax inclusive and that was also pleasing on our pockets.

SUMMARY ----- Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 4/5
Food quality: 3.2/5
Food presentation: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3.6/5
Value for money: 3.4/5
Service: 4/5

¬†One nice place to grab a plate of biriyani if you are near Newtown bus terminus, real scarcity of good mughlai restaurants (like Arsalan, Rehmania, Shiraz, etc) at this area has helped Alibaba a lot to thrive, so this outlet should try to capitalize on that opportunity. Surely you can pay a visit to this joint if you are craving for some satisfying mughlai meal or you may even go for home-delivery.

Cheers!

A small hut in the greenery of Ecospace. The trademark Only Alibaba has been our soul Biriyani centre if not for deliverers across. They have quite a brief menu, serving the Biriyanis, the chicken and mutton kebabs (few items), the firnis, the chickens main courses and rumali rotis. One will not find the elaborate menu of the restaurant here.
Getting onto the Biriyanis...I always prefer the mutton. This is their USP...the Biriyani...and oh yes...we bongs are always in for it. Quite good...no complaints. The rest of the food is completely based on availability.
The service is simple..takeaway...either have them packed or get served on thermocol plates.
All in all, a saviour for the IT-ian's but not quite the level hyped.

A small joint located at the ground floor of DLF IT park, with very limited seating capacity, but comfortable enough for everyone. During lunch hours its a bit congested and almost always runs out of seat. When it comes to the food, its moderately average both in taste and quantity. The biriyani is certainly not the best of the town, and the kebabs are also not that great quality if compared to the mughlai food legends of the town, but still enough it's not as bad. The quantity of the food is very low, especially for food maniacs like me. 

This place has the facility of office deliveries and the delivery is moderately fast, still lags by about 20-30 minutes.

This outlet is in my office building. I would say it is a moderately good place ti visit if you are craving for some spicy Mughai cuisine. But the interiors are not up to the mark. You will have to wait for hours before they deliver your order on your table. I think the authorities should think of the betterment of the interiors and sitting arrangements of the place.

Since it is located within DLF IT Park, where I go daily for work, I visit the place regularly, but this is ideal place for a quick bite like Rolls and some Kebabs (they are ideal for take home ). But only a portion of the typical Only Alibaba menu is available here, more of the standard items and there is a chance of being told that the item one is looking for is out of stock for the day.However, the staff is friendly and helpful and that is a main plus point for the store. The Home Deliver phone no of Only Alibaba in general is pathetic - half the time no one picks up or will tell you delivery not possible if amt is not such and such or only some items are available and the like - but these are a problem with the chain, not this store specifically.

They dont keep sufficient stocks and you may have to wait for a long time to get biryani particularly on fridays. and please if they say that "sir please wait the food is coming"--better to place order for something available and there van will never arrive soon as they say :)
The staffs are polite 
Mostly the items are available and here you can eat properly , no fragrance of kitchen cooked foods inside.

A favorite biryani joint for us office goers. A lot of dishes and biryani's are listed but some may not be available and if you are really interested give them a call or make a reservation beforehand.
Do try out all the rolls they offer.
Each one is a masterpiece in itself.
This particular branch has really less sitting space and long waiting queses so please make a reservation before you go especially on Friday's and weekends.

To be honest, I visited this place with my friends because we were looking for a quick meal and this was the closest option. When we were entering the restaurant, some earlier customers were storming out with allegations that the mutton was not chewable. This frightened me even more because I had never received any good feedback for this place. However with limited time, we entered with dim hopes. The first thing I mentioned during our order was that the meat should be soft which was met with acknowledgement. We ordered reshmi kabab, chicken and mutton biryani, mutton rezala and firni. Very honestly the quality was not bad. The mutton rezala was in fact above average though I detected Dalda in the taste. The other teams were passable, nothing too great but nothing bad. The firni was however not anywhere what a firni should be. If you remember to remind the waiter to make the food at least chewable, I think this can pass off as a place for a quick meal. Not cheap though, costing more than 300 per person for the spread I mentioned.

i often visit alibaba in dlf tower c as my office is in the same building. earlier, the food quality was good but off late, it has degraded. the biriyani rice is no more fine, dalda is used in making them instead of good ghee, chicken pieces are smaller each day, mutton pieces in side dish is hard to chew and under-cooked - few issues which we faced recently. only good part is the classical mutton biriyani which still has good mutton pieces and classical chicken sides e.g. tikka masala or lababdar. the space is small and often has long queue in waiting. the menu has no option for sweet dishes except firni and cold drinks! so, if you want to have good mughlai food right here in rajarhat/newtown, call up arsalan and order over rs. 400 so that they deliver your food from their park circus outlet.

this place is average. the food is nothing great. chicken biriyani is ok. most of the days the food gets finished by 2pm. if you visit this place say after 3 pm, you will not get any biriyani. also they will deliver the food only if you order for Rs 500. which is a bit high. they take at least 1 hour to deliver even if it is just a 3 km distance from my office. the only good part is the pricing.
