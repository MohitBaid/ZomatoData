It is small place for not many people to seat with minimal decoration. I tried hot garlic chicken and schezwan fried rice . Both were quite spicy and flavorful. Prices as damn affordable and service is fast and polite staff behaviour . All this makes d place good for a quick snack or take away .

A small restaurant located in mudiali. A good place for take away your food. The taste of the food is good. Price is pocket friendly. People who can't each much but love to try out the variety of food hope it will be a good destination for the foodie.Staffs are really good.

Good food compared to the price.  No place to sit and eat, only take aways. But very very bad at customer service, taking orders and delivery. My suggestion... Please change the person who pick ups the phone and takes the order. Last day there was this man who was continuously talking to other people while taking the order on phone. I had to call him thrice as it was getting very annoying that a person is talking to you, trying to give the order and you are not listening and talking to other people. Today there was this lady over the phone whos behaviour was very rude and as a result she did not take down the address properly. At the time of delivery they had to call thrice then also they went to the wrong address and after much of a struggle they delivered the food. FYI - MY HOUSE IS 10 BUILDINGS AWAY FROM THE RESTAURANT!

A small takeaway near my home, I frequently order from this place.
Talking about the ambience, it's a really small place with 2-3 tables and the place is not air conditioned. 
So it's not an ideal place for dining. It's more suitable for takeaways and deliveries.
Next coming to the behaviour of staffs, I wouldn't say they are good because they can be quite rude to you over the phone.
Now coming to the main part that is, the food.
It is the only reason why I'm giving this place a good score.
The food is really good. In starters the momos, wantons, crispy fried baby potatoes are my favourites. 
The main course is also good. And moreover the cost is very reasonable. One more good thing about the place is in main course they provide options for taking half plates as well. So you can order food for a single person as well as a large group.

All in all, I keep ordering from this place because the food they serve is lip smacking.

Food is amazing. And the price is extremely efficient. They do not compromise on taste at all (speaking of non veg stuff only). I keep ordering from here as it's cheap and tasty. But yeah they sometimes make the dish a bit spicy so I have to mention "MAKE IT LESS SPICY". Other than that it's just amazing. Also, sometimes they give low quantity and sometimes they give too much quantity. So I don't understand how do they measure and pack xD

A simple good restaurant located right beside mudiali club. Food is good, but the quantity is very less, specially the size of the chicken in side dishes are extremely small. Delivery is okay. Prices are reasonable. It has a small seating arrangement inside with 3 tables and chairs. its not air conditioned. Usually people opt for delivery or take away. ¬†The worst part of the place is the behavior of the management. If i wish to make a little changes in the order they will get irritated and rather behave badly with the customers, simply they just put down the phone. Rest it's okay apart from the behavior.

Came to have dinner herr with family on a friend's suggestion . I have tried chinese at all the well known places in kolkata but the chinese i had here today ! OMG !! 
lipsmacking starters , and in ample quantity to make ur tummy feel satisfiedüòç. The best starters to try here are butter garlic fish and chicken , crispy chicken and hunan prawn and many more . Specifically the fish and prawn are to drool over. Dont at all worry abt the rates , they are so reasonable that u won't even feel the pocket pinch.

A decent joint located in southern avenue. Not a place to sit and eat but order in. Ordered food from here in office 

‚Ä¢ Mushroom salt and pepper white came in with nicely costed mushrooms crispy fried, tossed in vinegar with onions, peppers, chilli and garlic. It was nice but I have had better ones.
‚Ä¢ Pan fried veg momo in garlic sauce which was delicious! Burnt garlic and tomato  smothered dumplings were an absolute delight.

Prices are reasonable and the food is tasty.

I am a regular here, but was ignored by the staffs today.
I sat here for 10 mins, in an empty place and no one comes to take our order.
After waiting patiently one staff comes and we give him a very simple order: Chilli Chicken, Fried Rice and Steam Momos. He confirmed the order with us 3-4 times. Yet for all, for the next 10-15 mins the kitchen remained empty with no one making our dishes. The staffs were at this time sitting outside the restaurant and chit chatting amongst themselves and ignored us as guests or customers.
This is a terrible experience of mine.
Just because the food is good this shouldn't have been the right attitude.
I feel this is unacceptable and should be addressed at the earliest.

Most of its key features have been dissected threadbare already, I won't delve further into the nitty grtties. They are a pretty decent eatery at competitive prices. The only thing they need to work on is their hakka noodles- All their hakka noodles variants look and taste exactly same. They claim to have quite a few, and they better work on it. In terms of quantity and quality, they are really competitive. A good choice if you're on a budget and need a quick bite or a small house party.

Very poor service. Never maintain time. When they say half an hour you should be ready to wait for at least one and a half hour. Food is so so. Overall not a place you should check in.

Dropped in today for a quick lunch. Small place with only 5 tables but interiors are colourful. Ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles & Velvet Chicken (couldn't understand the logic of this name though). Noodles was tasty while the Velvet Chicken was average. A bit more professionalism can take this place far.

A small joint in Southern Avenue, near Mudiali Club, serve quality food in a reasonable price. Mainly a take away/ delivery counter with hardly 10 seat.

Try their Pan Fried chicken or Momo.

‚ô¶ LOCATION-(3/5)
 It's a bit tough to locate, somewhere close to Mudiali.

‚ô¶ AMBIENCE - (3/5)
Actually as it is a new opened one, hence it's a tiny place not at all fancy.

‚ô¶ FOOD - (4.5/5)
The best thing about this place is their food, huge portions with perfect Chinese taste, the dishes I ordered are quite palatable.. Schezwan fried hakka noodles, Velvet chicken, Mongolian fish, chicken steam momo...each and every dish were upto the mark taste wise! 

‚ô¶ VFM & SERVICE : (4.9/5)
 Although service is a bit slow, but prices here are much pocket friendly , this is one of the best place in the cities for students to dine out. üéì 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! üòÑ

I've tried their Beck Bagan outlet earlier but this one has a much better location and ambience. It's a very small place located just beside Mudiali Club with very courteous and polite servers and great food. I'm in love with their food.
Till this date we've ordered :-
Chicken thai soup- This one deserves a 3.5/5. Good taste. Good quantity.
Chicken gravy chowmien- I'll give this dish a 3.5/5. Quantity wise this one was also very good. Taste could have been a little better. I like my gravy chowmien to be a little light and less oily. This one had quite some oil in it. Taste was though very good.
Velvet chicken- 4.5/5. Loved this dish. The gravy and the juicy and succulent chicken pieces are worth every penny you pay for them.
Pan fried chicken: A perfect 5/5. This is absolutely delicious. It's near perfect.
Chicken Steamed wanton: This one deserves a 4/5. Loved the dumplings. Juicy and soft. Great taste.
Hot bean chicken: I'll give this a 3/5. Good but not upto their standards. There are other dishes in the menu that are far better.
Chicken steamed momo: 4/5. Again a great dish. There are many momo joints around the city but considering the pricing and quality, I'll highly recommend this to everyone.
Chicken chilli garlic fried rice- I'll give this one a 4/5. The taste is awesome. My only complaint being that the amount of chicken in the rice is not satisfactory. There should have been more chicken in the dish.

I fell in love with this outlet of noodles kitchen and I'll come back to try out all their awesome dishes asap.
