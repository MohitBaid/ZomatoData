Located in Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road(Ripon Street)
This is an underrated bakery shop. It has a variety of cakes on its menu. They basically specialise in plain cake,walnut cake, chocolate walnut cake, plum cake,etc. They don't have a proper shop, its a takeaway shop. They even take orders for birthday & wedding cakes. The cakes over here are delicious, actually much better than most cake shops.

What a find in the bylanes of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road. Thanx to facebook foodie groups and zomato, i found this place on my recent visit to Kolkata. You cn reach the place by navigating thriugh gps. It is basically a bakery run by an ango indian family for many years and truely a hidden gem. Do try their walnut cake and rich fruit cake. Perfect for xmas. The coconut macaroons are to die for.. very filling and tasty. The ladies who run the place are so sweet to talk to.. prices are competitive. Just go and grab your cake before it finishes for the day :)

I've brought Christmas cakes from this store suggested by my father's colleagues.
I must say it's worth going the distance from my home. The fruit cake is a bit on the mid range but so evenly distributed and so densely populated with nuts and all other ingredients at same time. It's great.

Ok ... It totally represents the old Calcutta bakery culture ... Old residential place with bakery in the parking area .. the moment you enter this place u will be overwhelmed with the smell of freshly baked cakes and cookies .. hidden is an alley off Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Rd, this place is THE PLACE if you are looking for some classic recipes .. The leader being The Walnut Cake.   Never tasted any thing like this ever.

√Ä must-visit before Christmas. The choco walnut cake was dense and delicious, with adequate sprinkling of nuts. Buy the fruit cake during this season of Yuletide as it is not available round the year. Looking forward to taste the savouries next month.

They say you cant find heaven on earth but the feeling of pure bliss while having the Chocolate Truffle Cake of Saldanha Bakery makes me say that you should have this for that feeling.It probably is the Best Ever Cake I had in my lifetime on my birthday. The host extended the extra courtesy as I also had the privilege of tasting their Chicken Patties and Veg Kee.Saldanha just ensures that it keeps up with the rich heritage of our very own vintage Calcutta. Love it!!!

I'm a regular with this saldanhas. My church loves ordering from them, i love ordering from them, my mum, uncles, aunts all love ordering from them. Coconut macaroons and wanita cakes are to die for. Not forgetting their savoury counter parts like the sandwiches and patties. I would recommend ordering in advance as they are always packed and busy. The girls are always chere ful and willing to serve. Old man saldanha on the other hand is grumpy. But all in all good stuff.

This review was long overdue... Read about this place on zomato and also in many features which wrote about the best places to eat... So it was a must visit... 
The bakery is more than 80 years old located in a bylane of central Kolkata... The bakery functioning is carried out in a huge house... The best thing I liked when I entered Saldanah was seeing the huge brick oven, the taste of fire in the oven cooking is unbeatable... They take orders for parties and cook biscuits and cakes on orders... I just dropped by and was greeted by a wonderful and sweet lady... They were finished with everything, but was lucky to get walnut cake and salted biscuits... 
The walnut cake was the best ever I had...  it was super soft with crunchy bits of walnut inside and even the biscuits were crisp and too yummy... The owners were polite and so courteous... I wish I could get more items to taste... But I shall visit again... A must visit... üòÑüòÄ

Located in one of the many complicated lanes of Wellesley, I dint know it was a home business with no fixed menu. But fortunately they had Walnut Cake and Lemon Drop and it was simply delicious. They mainly take orders for parties. The cake was full  of chopped walnuts which added to the crunch . The jam in the lemon drop had a perfect balance of sweet and sour. I would definitely love to try the rest of their menu.

I have had their rich fruit cake, coconut macaroon and chocolate walnut cake. The macaroon is delicious. The fruit cake is filled with fruits so much that there's no room for any more. The chocolate walnut is my favorite. The sweetness is not much, yet you get a chocolate flavor with walnut.

No-one and I mean no-one makes better Walnut cake in town. This is a heritage joint run by an Anglo Indian family from their residence for decades. Old world charm and cake go hand in hand here. The true worth of the place comes out during Christmas when the queue outside this place is longer than that of Eden Gardens!! Must try for all.

'Saladanha Bakery'  is a very well known bakery of Central Kolkata. It is located in q bylane of Wellesley, just opposite to Hotel Afreen. 

This bakery is situated in a huge house and is more than 80 years old. There is no seating arrangement or any eating arrangement. One has to take away the food. 

I visited this bakery at 2 p.m yesterday. I came to know that you have to pre-order the food items. Still I got one chicken envelope and one chocolate truffle pastry. The chicken envelope was delicious. It was filled with chicken and veggies. The chocolate truffle pastry was good in taste but felt a bit dry. The lady who sold me the items was very friendly and I will surely visit again.

When the yuletide cheer is in the air, and all you are thinking of  is plum and fruit cakes, then you must visit this bakery tucked away in a warm and cozy corner of the  Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road. As you step into the  yellow, green and red painted building you will be greeted with a whiff of freshly baked cakes and as you walk up the stairs leading to the delivery area, you will be wrapped up in the aroma of breads,cakes,macaroons. The chocolate walnut cake is a must! The soft walnut cake with crunchy bits of walnut melts in your mouth and all you can utter is ummmmm...unmistakably!Their fruit cakes and cheese puffs are delectable.So cake lovers...do not miss out on this joint, not a very fancy one...but when you are there you know...u have stepped into old Calcutta!

Awesome!!! Yes that's what defines the cakes of Saldanha bakery. Had the opportunity of tasting their chocolate walnut cake and rich fruit cake for Christmas this year and I must say that both the cakes were delicious. Established in 1930, it's a four generation legacy running in a quintessential central Kolkata lane. As you enter the premise you can smell the Aroma of freshly baked cakes and confectioneries. The typical old Kolkata house is itself nostalgic and as you reach the top floor to order your stuff it feels like a retro age that you have entered. You look around and there's only freshly baked cakes, patties etc and all other paraphernalia related to a bakery shop. The best part is that they never compromise with the quality of the products and you get fresh baked items only. The pricing is competitive and that's fine I guess keeping the quality in mind. A must visit for cake lovers for sure.

I went to the Saldanha's cause people go so much gaga over the quality of their cakes and nowadays Nahoum's is just overhyped.... Bought a walnut cake and a plain one.... 
But to my disappointment those were not upto the mark at all.... Both the cakes were under-baked which is a serious flaw... (I know something about cake baking cause we do that every year in batches of 10-12)..
Maybe it was due to festive rush... Maybe I was unlucky with  my samples... Or maybe this place is also a hugely overhyped one.... Gonna check that place once again after this festive season cause I truly believe such an old place wouldn't have deteriorated so badly....

Its a very old bakery in a lane on Rafi ahmed Kidwai Road. Recently tried their rich fruit cake and the famous walnut cake. Both are rich, moist, soft and mouth watering and melts in your mouth. Never had something so delicious in any other cake shop/bakery. Also tried the chicken envelope. The taste was mind blowing. The filling and the patty both were really good unlike other shops where u'll hardly find any trace of chicken. A must try for all.

The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away.

ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :)

Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking.

There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story.

I don‚Äôt know how many of you have heard about this place, but to those who have no clue about it, need to order and have some of their awesomeness! And to those who are acquainted with this beautiful place, you know what I am talking about. Saldanha Bakery was started in the year 1930 by Ubelina Saldanha. The address is 19, Nawab Abdur Rahman Street Kolkata ‚Äì 700016, ( beside 74, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road). None of you can understand right? I will simplify it for you. Take Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and when you see the big B.C. Sen Showroom, take the lane beside it. Walk few seconds and on your left will be a big green door, and bingo! You have reached your destination. One has to pre order anything one needs, even if its a single brownie is what you are craving, you need to place an order beforehand.
                                                                ...

This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth.

This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time.

One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata.

Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery.

Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items****

This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery.

Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items****

I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss

Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price.

I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious.

Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it.....
