Located at Behala Parnasree, the name suggests that it gives out something similar to KFC.. Bt burgers were a bit let down.. nd coming to the fried chicken part, can't say that they were at par with KFC.. bt still its great value for money.. tasted quite same and moreover pricing was reasonable and quality was also very good.. big thanks to the owners who came up wit such a idea of making fried chicken  so reasonably priced..
