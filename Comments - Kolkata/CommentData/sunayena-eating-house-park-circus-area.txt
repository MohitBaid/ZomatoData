The paneer do piyaza is definitely worth a try. Although the food is great, they should really focus on hygiene, though the place is moderately spacious.

When we started visiting here, a meal of rice and chicken curry used to cost around 22 bucks.That was 2007.Yesterday evening,a decade later,now it is 90! So you can imagine how long people like me have been patrons of this place.To many in the CIT road area and to the students of CNMCH and Lady Brabourne, this is a second home.

Highly recommended- chicken bharta, dal makhani, chicken curry,tandoori roti,palak paneer,any meal that has some kind of fish curry.

The decor is minimalist and its a non-ac 24-28 seater eatery. The manager of this place,Siddhart,is a very friendly chap just like the rest of the staff. 

Do pay a visit.

Anyone can come for a great lunch in a great
 price. Great Bengali food!!!  But the hotel size is small and it needs a lot more cleanliness.

Had some rumali roti, chicken bharta, butter chicken. Its a small eating house but the quality of the food is quite good and must mention about the hygiene and the price. Local people will appreciate this place

It was a hectic day when I hopped on a cab and asked zomato for directions to fill my tummy.A perfect random arrival,anyhow,but I didnot regret that.I sat in one of the corners,my spot,and ordered Tandoori,Chicken Bhartha and Onion Salads.Dissatisfied with the decorum,yet it is quite hospitable,with staffs perfectly mannered.The food is a bit high spiced,tossed up with much oil.I found the hygiene and catering beautiful.Yet there is still a lot of scope for improvement in delicacies.The prices were a lot edgy, and the food served were below average amounts.
Hop in for a joyful time.But Non-veg is a bit tawdry I guess.
