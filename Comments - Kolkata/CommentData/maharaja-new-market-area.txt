It's a small restaurant which serves us with the best chicken rolls and chicken manchurian. I have had a lot of chicken chowmin and egg roll from here. Chilly chicken , Veg manchurian ,crispy alloo and fried rice are ones to go for.
Home delivery is available and sitting area is also available.

Maharaja is located on Mirza Galib Street.It is a small place and difficult for people to sit and dine.Have tried their Chicken fried rice and Dry chilli chicken.Rice is not properly fried and taste is average.Dry chilli chicken is enjoyable.

I have grown up eating their food. Located away from the hustle and bustle of Park Street. The rolls are tasty. With seating arrangement now, this is the perfect place to enjoy kolkata's favourite snack ''The Kathi Roll''

I'm not sure what the public opinion on Maharaja is, but I'm sure it's not a bad one. They look as if they've been here a long time, and have perhaps mastered the art of roadside cooking.

They don't have the most extensive menu, nor the most inexpensive one. But the options you'll get, are true to their word. The kebabs aren't kebabs, but basically the roll fillings you find.

When it comes to service, you'll notice how pointless it is to even expect any. Just tell them what you want and pay. That's how transactions of this sort usually go about in the city. There's hardly any seating and to be fair, they're all about the food.

The rolls are pretty standard, and they won't ask you to specify what you want in them. So be sure to tell them before they start. The Chicken Kebab is good, a little hot but that's a good thing. The chaaps too are edible if you've got the time.

Rainy night and comfort of hot and spicy chicken roll. The place Is quite old. Serves indo-chinese food. A huge variety of roll is available that are not available in other parts of the city like chicken cheese roll, mayonnaise roll and others. 
Place is very conveniently located. Though not a large place, this place have no sit and dine, its just a take away eating joint. 
The chicken roll we had is nothing outstanding, they don't even use laccha paratha and of you are in the area you have many other options like Kusum rolls. 

Even though menu is elaborate, taste and quantity and quality is nothing more than normal.

It is a small joint where mainly take away facility available as there isn't any proper seating arrangement available. So its better to had take away from them or try rolls. 

I have tried many of their roll varieties from normal egg rolls to double egg rolls,chicken rolls to egg chicken rolls and many other. I must say that the quality of their rolls were on good side. The paratha were always good so were the stuffings. They tested good.. 

But once we had chicken gravy chow from here and that was a disaster. No taste at all. Most of the vegetables remained raw. And tasteless too. Although it was good in quantity but one couldn't finish it due to the taste... 

They should improve it in the future...

Very popular joint for rolls and snacks. Situated in Mirza Ghalib Street, this place serves some great rolls, specially their Chicken n Mutton rolls. Yesterday tried their Double Chicken Roll.. And loved it to the core. Big pieces of chicken wrapped in less-oily crispy paratha.. For just 65 bucks. Awesome.

Not fancy to write anything. Ordered mixed Hakka noodles nd it was simply horrible. Just lost the mood to have lunch. Only fried chicken fat was there instead on chicken pieces.

Have tried the Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka Chow, Chilly Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Sandwiches, and all have been very good to eat.
The delivery is swift and the quantity served is enough for two people.
Great value for money!

I love this place because they deliver the food within 15-20 mins at my work place and would recommend you all Mayonnaise chicken roll and Mayonnaise chicken sandwich along with cheese omelette. :) Prices are more than reasonable :) Worth every penny. (y)

It you are looking for a way-side sandwich shop, Maharaj is the place to be. The sandwiches are delicious , prepared with good ingredients and does not pinch your pocket. The eatery is frequented by hungry office staff, students and foreigner tourist staying nearby. 

Hygiene is a concern but is nice if you like street food.

Just below office, Maharaja is just another road side outlet. Though the food tastes good, I cannot guarantee about the hygiene factor for the same. The rolls are good as well as the various types of sandwiches you get. You can also try the chinese, its bearable but sandwiches are something which are surely recommended. The are nice, crisp and made fresh in front of you.

ok, now Maharaja is literally the saviors for the hungry souls in the Park Street/ Mirza Ghallib Street area. It is this tiny stall that delivers quite decent food. we mostly order home delivery and the service almost always is quite prompt and timely. I like their chicken mayonnaise roll quite a lot, the mayo tastes like freshly done. The food is quite cost effective, they serve a huge quantity at an affordable price. The Chilly Garlic Noodle (dry) and Chilly Chicken is also one of the preferred combinations from Maharaja. The sandwiches are also great. if you are looking for cheap and quantity, Maharaja is your sure bet.
