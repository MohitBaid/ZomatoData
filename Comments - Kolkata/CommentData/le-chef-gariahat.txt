Chicken Steak Lasagna and Chicken Tetrazzini.
Both were amazing.

This place is really easy to miss thought being situated on the main road. This is just situation just beside the Gariahat Spencer's. This is a small place but is beautifully decorated with pictures showing the very essence of Kolkata. The food is pretty good and so is the quantity. The price is also pocket friendly with a quick service and polite waiter. Would definitely come back here a second time.

Visited this place on the 1st of January with my family. Ordered chicken sizzlers, chelo kebab and brownie with ice cream.
Ambience is cozy, a bit small but well decorated.
Quantity of food was good enough.... One Sizzler for one person is way more than enough. 
Quality of food was really good. The kebabs, the rice and poach, saut√®d veggies all were amazing. The chicken cooked with mushroom, herbs and white sauce was the best part of the Sizzler. ‚ù§

Good Restaurant. Ordered Pan Fried Chicken and Chicken Yum Yum Noodles. Pan Fried Chicken is a must try! It tasted yummy. The noodles was soupy. It was good too.
Also tried their muglai and special muglai paratha from their fast food counter just outside the shop. It's really difficult these days to get good muglai paratha and they certainly made me happy with theirs. 
The Quantity of food served is also abundant.

Ambience is also nice and comfy. 

Service was also good.

Overall experience was very good. Hope they will continue with the food quality and quantity in the years to come.

A little space with amazing inteiors. Quality ambience. The pictures on the walls are a startler. The staff is extremely polite. A reason I would consider in revisiting a good restaurant. 
Coming to the food the soups at the given price are tasty enough for the price. The fried rice was exceptionally good and amount was perfect for two. The noodles was good too.  The schezwan chicken that we took had a really nice gravy. Superb taste and the chicken was really soft and good. Would definitely recommend.

Located within Gariahat Spencers premises. Don't follow the map. It's newly opened. Small and good place with nice interior. Went there yesterday for lunch. 
Ordered hot and sour soup, pan fried chicken(house fav), fried rice,hot garlic chicken and blue lagoon. Price is reasonable and every food item was perfect. Loved the soup. Pan fried chicken needs special mention. I will recommend this particular dish as it contained perfectly cooked pieces of chicken with exact proportio of spices and lots of veggies. Quantity was also good. Main course was nice too. Lovely experience. Hope to visit soon. And ya 5% VAT appicable.

Located in the heart of Gariahat (in the Spencer‚Äôs complex) Le Chef is a cafeteria promising its customers an ‚Äòat-home‚Äô ambience, quaint decor and, to top it all - lip smacking food. While artistically put up B&W pictures of Kolkata build around an ‚Äòold world‚Äô charm , we quickly dig into delectable Chinese and Continental food -  crispy chilly garlic chicken, Bon Garlic Rice, Garlic fish , Chelo Kebab, Chicken Steak sizzler, et al. Their Caramel Pudding and chilled mocktails need special mention. We especially loved the tangy Chilly Mojito. Should be one of their USP s. Thank You Le Chef for the awesome experience.

A cozy cafe environment with a wide variety of cuisine. 

We went in a group and ordered Chinese as well as continental. The favorite amongst Continental was the chello kebab, and it didn't disappoint. Perfectly balanced buttered rice with delicious kebabs and a beautiful gooey fried egg on top of the rice. For people staying in South Kolkata, one definitely need not travel for close to an hour and wait for an equally same amount of time to satisfy the craving for a delicious chello kebab. This one is a good value for money. The mixed grill sizzler is also worth having. The mocktails were refreshing too.

The ambience with a slice of Kolkata thrown at, is sure to make you happy and comfortable. Definitely in my list to make a next visit very soon.

Le chef is right near the exit of spencer, gariahat. I found the decor to be absolutely stunning yet simple with pictures of old Calcutta. We dropped in there around 2pm yesterday. There was only one service staff who behaved politely. We ordered chinese chopsuey and schewain chicken with a pocket pinch of Rs. 347and a sufficient quantity for two. The dishes tasted good. Pocket friendly. Would look forward to visit again.

I gave this place 1* cause there was nothing below it. This place is disgraceful and negative in so many ways. So basically I had ordered:

Crispy congee chicken- It was completely bland (no flavour, no spices) it was not crispy either and the vegetables were slightly seasoned by just salt & pepper. On sending the food back so that it would be remade properly they instead switched the chicken to tiny pieces which was totally burnt and was so crispy that there was no chicken left inside basically all I got was corn flour and all purpose flour added to such a huge amount that it became more tasteless and indecent. I did not even have two spoons of it and had to pack it up to give it to a beggar.

Veg Schezwan fried rice- this was my second dish that I ordered so there was no schezwan flavour so I had asked them to remake it and again the same thing repeated and the funny part was it was more tasteless & it did not even have salt this time in it. I was so disheartened that a place which is serving Chinese cannot even make schezwan fried rice properly.

For the Staff - while they had to take back the food to remake both the items the staff‚Äôs been commenting something rude amongst them and there was a certain irritation agitation.  At least an apology was expected!
Kindly work on the restaurant and ask the staff‚Äôs to be polite enough! Badly disappointed.

no wonder this restaurant is empty all the time

Interior is cosy, decorated with snap shots of old Calcutta. We tried Cantonese rice and kung pao chicken which was good in taste and ample in quantity. Both rice and chicken was full of veggies, mushrooms and cashew nuts...full of flavours. Service is quick and polite. Complete value for money.

First things first... kudos on the service. The waiter we had was polite and wonderful and good service is a very important factor in me visiting a place more than once. That being said let's us move onto the food. I ordered momos, some fried chicken dish and the bongarlic fried rice with an ice tea. The momos were slightly on the dry side. Not much seasoning put into them and the momo skin was slightly tough. Definitely there are better momo places scattered in the city. Then we move onto the chicken dish which was basically strips of chicken breast coated in batter and seasoning and then deep fried. The chicken unfortunately was overcooked and as a result  had a chalky texture. The batter itself was too thick so it was like 80% batter 20% chicken. Lastly we look at the fried rice which I can try but I found no faults the rice was cooked perfectly and so we're the vegetables chicken and egg. If I could say something was that I was missing the flavour of the garlic. Lastly only after we were served the rice did I get my ice tea which was a bit disappointing. On the other hand the ambience and feel of the place was good liked the fact it wasn't a dimly lit restaurant. One more piece of advice is the plates had finger marks on them which should be taken care of cleanliness is important in the restaurant industry.

A very nicely decorated restaurant that serves very quality food at a pocket friendly price. A very good place for college goers to excite their taste buds at a cheap price. I feel very proud for having discover this hidden gem. I tasted both their Chinese and continental dishes and i absolutely fell in love with the Roasted chicken that they made! The fried rice  and drums of heaven were also very well prepared. Very good effort. Keep going. A big thumbs up from my side to this place. Very much recommendable!

So my search for good quality, pocket friendly restaurant came to a halt when i spotted this restaurant.
Located just on the exit of gariahat spencers, is this really cool restaurant.
Really liked the decor. This restaurant is nicely lighted, with photographs capturing the true essence of old Kolkata having pictures of the Howrah bridge, fish mongers etc..
Now, coming to the food.
We ordered
1) ROAST CHICKEN
2) DRUMS OF HEAVEN
3) CHICKEN FRIED RICE AND
4) SCHEZWAN CHICKEN.

The service was quite quick and we got our food within 10 mins.
All of the food items were freshly made and was piping hot.

DRUMS OF HEAVEN - We were served 6 pieces of drumstick. Tastewise it was quite good and the hot sweet and sour chicken drumsticks were really satisfying to the taste buds.

FRIED RICE AND SCHEZWAN CHICKEN - Both the dishes went really well with eachother. The rice had ample chicken and eggs in it and came in more than sufficient quantity.
The schezwan chicken was the perfect balance of a lil bit of tangy and hot. And loved every bit of it.

ROASTED CHICKEN- A friend of mine had this dish and she was complimenting it a lot. Still i tasted the chicken, which was nicely roasted and it was going very well with the sauted veggies, butter rice and mashed potatoes

Overall, had a good experience..
Pocket pinch for 3 was around 860 bucks including GST and it was worth the money.
Highly recommended!ü§ó

Though starter was served after the main course :P the foods were really tasty and good. In fish & chips, the portion of the fish was very fleshly unlike the usual and the desert Monte Carlo was not on the menu but the person who was servicing us suggested it . It was very yummy and a great gesture indeed.

A nicely lit place just under the Gariahat Spencer is a pleasant way to refill your dropping energy levels after a shopping spree. Mexican wrap is a must try snack here . However dropped there once for an odd dinner with zero expectations ,but minted a real delicacy chicken jai thai noodles. The interiors are well lit with an euphemistic‚Äã effort to dub Bengali culture with Bengali cinema only. Service is a big let down. But do not complain if you order a Chicken noodles and receive a mixed one at the same price. üòõ

The location is just beside the spencer at gariahat... The quantity of the food is more than enough ... It offers both north indian and chinese food .... The place is a bit small but the ambience was quite beautiful... The reason of giving a .5 less is that they didnot ask us of which cold drink to serve instead they served us sprite when we can see other cold drinks were also available....

Firstly I want to mention today was really a hectic day. At the beginning only one of my mates arrived lately and it slowed our pace. But still we managed and started our pandal hopping. After 1 or 2 hrs of walking we felt very hungry and decided to chose our restaurant. Finally, after another 30 mins of  chaos and bustle, we reached le chef. The only problem we faced was that there was no google map location of the restaurant which I had also complained to the manager. Hope they add it soon on zomato. Now going to the food part. 

In appetizers we had :

1. Chicken malai kabab (4.8/5)- juicy tender and quite large pieces of chicken skewered with indian herbs and topped with gooey malai gravy. It just turned the way round. 

2. Crispy chilli baby corn (4.2/5)- an authentic chinese dish which everyone must try out. The baby corn was soft and they were literally 'crispy' and not soggy or sauted with excessive sauce. I would recommend it to all. Surely try it out.

3. Lemon honey chicken(2.8/5) - it was sadly the dish I did not like at all. The chicken pieces had a queer smell and the taste of lemon and honey was not at all satisfactory. I would request to uplift the flavours of the dish so ot can stand out to be excellent.

Now going to the main course. Firstly I would rate the north indian delicacies

4. Butter naan(4/5) - the naan pieces were fair enough in size and well brushed with butter. A good dish.

5. Chicken reshmi butter masala(4.9/5) - the star dish of the day. Boneless succelent chicken cubes skewered in tandoor and cooked in white creamy cashew gravy with cream of course. Heavenly indeed. Surely try it out, my recommendation and I assure it will blow your mind. 

6. Fish tikka masala(4.6/5) - againa great dish. Tender bhetki basa simmered in rich tikka gravy. Thumbs up.

Now moving on to the chinese dishes.

7. Chicken fried rice(3.8/5) - did not taste extraorndinary classic but good. No description needed.

8. Kungpao chicken(4.4/5) - another worthy dish. Small chicken pieces simmered with sauces and vegetables and topped with cashew nuts. Tasted great. One can try out.

Now moving to the desserts

9. Tutti frutti(5/5) - my favourite dessert. The one in there was a whooping kind with huge amount of fruits and icecream and syrup. Tasted just awesome. It first looked excessive to me but after eating a bit it changed my mind. I think its probably the best tutti frutti i have tasted. Please try it out. Hats off to the restaurant.

10. Le chef spl. Mojito(4.5/5) - a good dish and tasted great except the quantity. Good still.

The ambience was great and service was quick and restaurant was well maintained. The staff attended us nicely . Altogether a good restaurant. Surely try it out.

Puja is here and it's that time when you have to search for a good place without waiting for long hours. Located beside the Spencers at Gariahat, this newly opened restaurant impressed me quite much today.
We had ordered the following items:
Crispy Conjee chicken; it was very well flavoured and prepared.
Malai Kofta; very few places nowadays serve koftas made entirely of paneer it was quite well prepared and very creamy.
Kulcha; this could have been better.
Cold coffee; this was too watery we didn't like it.

The service was good, the waiter even apologised for the delay. I liked the ambience too, it was quite well designed.
I guess this would be a possibly good option for normal days as well as Pujo.
They haven't charged extra for Pujo days which is a plus point again.

For all those who feel that the only disadvantage of Gariahat shopping is the lack of restaurants on Main Road,  here comes a perfect solution. An amazing restaurant right at the doorstep of your previous shopping destination in Gariahat.

Le chef , the name being synonymous with good food  is a must visit place for any foodie. The food was ambrosial and the ambience is soothing. The picture  adorning the walls is sure to impress anyone. The city culture is truly shown here. Chicken sizzler is recommended. Mind blowing experience.

Just had a little evening snacks with a very unusual mocktail called ladies mojito. Never ever I had this kind of amazing mocktail in my life. This restaurant is cosy and the food tastes awesome. Mocktail are exceptionally nice here.

A nice cozy place... the first thing which attracts is the entrance... The look is cute with the fence on either sides of the door... the seating is comfortable with comfortable moving space... staff is friendly and attentive... the food is good, we tasted the gravy noodles, fish finger and pan fried chicken- all tasted fresh and good... the only thing missing was the Kasundi with the fish finger but we got it as soon as we asked for it... Value for money... must try...

Le Chef is a much awaited addition to the vivacity of Gariahat....its array of mouthwatering delicacies is its usp as is its cosy ambience as well as the  warm hospitality offered by its owners and  staff. The decoration though simple  speaks volumes for the aesthetic sensibilities of its owners.A great place to take your family and friends.

SIRCARs - On a date with the mentor of SIRCARs ,  landed up @Le' Chef - Spencer's Mall , Rash Bhari Avenue .
A cool and cozy place to chill out ! This 30 seater "multi cuisine" restaurant opened its doors on 1st of August 2017 .
A cool and "easy on eyes" ambience but quite tastefully done . 
On our first visit 

a) Mocktails - As recommended by the Resturant Captain . The sweet, sour , salty one with lots of "green chillies "surely needs a special mention .

b) Fish & Chips - The Fish Fillets  were as thick, soft and juicy as they come . Highly Recommended !

c) Chello Platter - Rice,  Sunny-side-up egg , mutton and chicken kebabs; Worth every penny of its price .

d) Mixed Kebab platter - Along side the variety of chicken kebabs  it includes Prawn and Fish too . 

We could not try the the "Sizzlers" , this time , but they looked good while being served . On priority list of next visit .

A very nice team of people running, handling and maintaining the place !

You can always find a couple of the @promoters , of the place, around, keeping a watch on the service, quality, convenience of guests and  ready to  take suggestions .

While we hope to be back there quite frequently , we recommend the place for a cool , laid-back "adda" session  with some very pocket-friendly and delectable food and mocktails !
