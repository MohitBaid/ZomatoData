One of the oldest joint in the area... Nothing to say about the ambience n decor... Very dirty, unhygienic and not maintained at all... But they are attracting a good crowd what so ever... I tried their samosas... Which were decent... Staffs are clueless like local joints... Pocket pinch is friendly...

Probably 2.5 would have been the exact rating but still giving 0.5 extraa as this place have served my stomach for years. Once upon a time their kachuri was hot sellers as it was yummy as well very less oily. The oily point still stands firm but the yummy part has somehow vanished which is actually very disappointing for me personally. Their kheerer chop is good and other snacks item also but was far better before. But still this place will not be a very bad option for choti choti bhook.

The very first thing being an old customer I would say,is The QUALITY has degraded.It is located in Hazra More and if you are hungry and wanna try out something.Try their  kochuri and Rasgulla.I still love the Misti Doi,kheer er chop and Rasmalai.
They still make kaja(which is only sold on the day of bhai phonta) which is not bad in taste.
If you look for hygiene,this place will not impress you much.

Excellent location....Right at the Hazra crossing from where SP Mukherjee Road starts. So it's quite popular as people just drop in to have mithai. Some of their sweets are good like the chum chum , some of the sandesh also looked tempting. The mishti doi too was good though it was lacking the creamy thick layer on top ( so I was disappointed, since I love that). But hygiene is a problem here and the person serving you also doesn't seem too keen. Just serves mechanically without any expression...No smile.
Prices are reasonable.

হাজরা মোর এর কাছে দিয়ে গেলেই চোখে পরবে । ছিম ছাম এবং মোটামুটি পরিস্কার ই বলা যায় । আলাদা করে মনে রখার কোন কারন নেই তবে কচুরি টা  খেয়ে দেখা যেতে পারে আর শেষে একটু মিষ্টি দই হলে মন্দ হয় না । স্বাদ বা মান অনুযায়ী মিষ্টির দাম বেশি বলেই মনে হয়েছে ।

Located just beside the Bata showroom, Hazra crossing - used to visit this place very frequently while returning from work to try out their kachori and aloo sabzi, best seller of this sweet shop. Beside this i like their rasamalai and misti doi.

Located at Hazra near Bata, this used to be a nice place for some decent sweet and snacks. The Kochuri was a best seller here, until sometime back, when the quality of most of their snacks and sweets have degraded. The pricing though remains on the economical side.

Located near the Hazra Bara store, this place is pretty old. I love the kachoris from here along with rossogollas and sarbhajas. Good to try out if you're hungry and running on a low budget.

Good place for sweets and snacks. The mini kachoris available here are quite good. This place has been around for the last twenty years at least, if not more.
Located exactly at the Hazra crossing in the ground floor of Amulya Mansion next to BATA has been a landmark by itself.

I will be a little partial reviewing about this place since it belongs to my friend but frankly speaking their sweet quality is quite good and their snack items especially their kachauris are damn good. And the service is excellent if u consider the morning and evening crowd since it is located at the crossing of Hazra Rd. Overall the experience is worthy.

This place is located at the Hazra more near ashutosh college beside Bata Showroom. It was always crowded with people and kinda popular in here. I tried some of their sweets and samosa, very average taste..

It's usp is it's location. But the food and the sweets are nothing much to write about. It's quite economical. Skip it if you have a better option.

its a very  good shop... many varieties of sweets are available here. its located at a prime place - Hazra Crossing....Its a well known shop down there!  I tried the samosas,radha ballavi,rasgullas,sandesh,chamcham,kaju barfi,son papri and jalebi. quality was good , service was fast and the shopkeeper was polite and decent . prices were quite reasonable.
If they work a bit on the cleanliness then this shop would be worth a try.
  Overall was an good experience :-)

Location: Hazra Crossing; Beside Bata stores.

Raj Confectioners is a small sweet shop just round the corner of the crossing. Happened to visit early this evening for a light snack.
About the ambiance, nothing great apart from wall-side table.
Ordered a Samosa and Chena Payes. 
- The Samosa was hot and had a flavorful filling.  But, was a bit oily.
- The Chena Payes was delicious. But, the milk content was a bit high. Could have been slightly thicker in consistency.

•Hygiene levels were quite low. The tables were dirty and I cleaned. Turn off.

Prices felt a pinch in respect to the quality.

Overall was an average experience.

This place is located wondefully right at Hazra crossing.The quality of the stuff on offer is decent too.But the issue with this place is hygiene and cleanliness.

The shop is quite spacious but the space is not used properly I felt.Many of the sweets are left uncovered.There is a huge garbage can that is also left uncovered and thus understandably there are lots of flies in and around the uncovered sweets.This is an absolute turn off.

Coming to the food,I have tried only the stuff that are kept inside the shelf.The singara and the radha ballavi are both pretty good.They are served hot and both are tasty.Among the sweets the rosogolla was average.There was quite a good variety of sweets available but many of them were unfortunately the breeding places of flies so I refrained from trying them.

This place will be far more worth trying if they look into the cleanliness issue.

Actually I had to ask the man serving in the shop about the name of the place. :D

**Location = Located just beside Bata at Hazra More :)

**Brief = I have had their Mishtis(sweets), Shingaras(Samosas) many a times while returining home :) Just checked Zomato today and came to know that they are also enlisted here :)

**Ambience = A pretty unclean place. Specially the wash basin is very poorly maintained. Cleanliness is an issue here.

**Food = Its a sweet shop. They serve snacks like Samosas,Kachoris,Nimkis :)
Samosas - Served hot,with chutney (if you ask). Tastes good with the potato filling inside.
Kachoris - Also served hot with a potato "torkari", and tastes pretty decent as well.
Kaju Barfi - Nothing special. So So !
Ras Malai - Yummy, actually this one tastes great everywhere.

**Purse Check = The items are pretty decently priced.

**Overall = Not a must go sweet shop. But still you can try out their samosas and kachoris in the evening :)
They must indulge a bit more into cleanliness which would attract more customers. They have a prolific location, which they should utilise for their benefits :)
