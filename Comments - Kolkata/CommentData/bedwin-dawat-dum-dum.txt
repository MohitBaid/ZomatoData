Serves very good rolls. Personally I like their egg chicken roll with the onion and capsicum tossed in oil, a pinch of lemon juice and no sauce. Try it. Rolls have very less oil and so you can afford to have it once in a while. Their moghlai was pathetic with peanuts inside and the aloo sabji tasted horrible. So I would recommend any rolls specially the non veg ones.
Now talking about the hygiene part the owner has a pet cat who roams about inside the shop and sits on the tables here and there.

The rolls they made. A decade back they were the guys you would have gone to have those deliciously made rolls. Their mutton roll could compete with any of the famous roll joints of kolkata then. I remember they were the first to start aloo stuffed rolls in dum dum. But sadly they cast just a shadow of themselves now. The rolls are still good. But not as awesome. Still i would prefer them over hajis any day.

I can anyday die for their egg chicken or egg mutton rolls. Located just beside the motijheel gate, this place has been very famous in dumdum area for mainly the excellent rolls they prepare. Though It's been a long time now that I had been there when they didn't have any sitting arrangement but the taste of the juicy soft rolls were enough to keep you standing and enjoy the moment followed by cold drink!! Ohhh!! Pure bliss!!

As a roll joint it deserves to earn full credits.. I still choose this place out of all if I want to have egg chicken roll.. One will be spared of indigestion if one chooses this joint.. But the other items needs fine tuning.. They should hire more men as the service at times is slow.. But again.. Rolls are too tasty

This placs is on the DumDum road, just after Motijheel and is a small place. Dine in is available but no AC, at least i didn't see one when i last visited, long time back though. 

Ordered various stuff over the years. The roll is not bad but overpriced if quality is kept in mind. The Paneer items are just okaish. 

For take away in desperate needs, it's fine otherwise avoid. Go for Hasty Tasty, just opposite. Much much better and quicker.

Bedwin was a prominent name 10years back but with time cracks started to form and now this place is at the lowest point.. It was my favorite roll centre back in my schooldays and i used to drop in here once or twice in a week..
But now this place is a nightmare,this place is unhygenic and cleanliness is on the negative margin, the owner also lost hope i guess with this place, chairs are broken,gates are broken even the sign board also doesnot work anymore..
The tables are getting thick with dust and sauce over it and no one cares to clean them..
Bedwin was a quality snacks corner and the owner should start to make improvements about this place, starting from cleanliness..
If you found a review helpful n informative,have the common courtesy to drop a like,it helps to separate useful reviews and potential craps..thank you
