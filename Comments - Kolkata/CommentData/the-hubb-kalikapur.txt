My first time experience of this place was really bad. We ordered hot chocolate, cappuccino and chicken nachos . They mixed some weird sauce in chicken nachos which made it taste horribly bad. Try anything out there but not chicken nachos . Cappuccino wasn't that good either. Hot chocolate was somewhat good but wasn't worth the money paid for it . Overall I did not like that place and will definitely recommend others not to waste there money in such a place which is not worth it.

Don't know about others but my first-time visit and the last was pathetic. Yeah initially¬†I loved the ambiance and decor but a cafe doest runs based on that.
I was sitting and waiting for almost 1 hour still didn't get my order only when I tried to cancel my order it was served. I ordered¬†4 drinks and 4 food items didn't¬†get the full order served. They were busy serving for Swiggy constantly¬†while kept us waiting. Even the waiter didn't¬†serve us water although he asked us twice to know whether we like mineral or regular water.¬†
Food was nothing exceptional. The pasta I ordered¬†was one of the worst I ever tested.
Never going again.

Located opposite to Kalikapur Bandhan Bank Branch.
Small restaurant yet very well decorated.
Food wasn't that great also.
We ordered :-
Barbeque chicken- it was simple boneless crispy chicken in some sweet sauce.
Momo- Very dry and the sauce was bad too
Fried rice- it was okayish 
Hunan chicken - The chicken was very stiff and the gravy wasn't that tasty.

Total bill for these was 731/-

This tiny cafe is located on the Prince Anwar Shah Connector Road.
Ambience is cosy and the slick decor makes it homely. The music playlist is at par with the latest hits which makes this cafe groovy and lively.
We ordered Chicken Nachos, Chicken Cheese Momos and Chicken Cheese Pancakes.
Pancakes are actually known as a sweet dish but then, this was a savoury serving. I didn't like it at all as this savoury dish was garnished with splits of honey. 
But the overall experience was pretty average.
‚Çπ650 for two, approximately.

A newly opened junction this year mid of may..caught my sight as was heading to ruby from Jadavpur thana.searched for the place immediately and the menu being quite tempting dropped in
We were the the only visitor at that moment there
Staffs and ambience..the decor is real welcoming and the staff too..who seemed to manage from taking orders to every other services outside the kitchen alone
Coming to food, took brownie blast(had the perfect sweetness, loads of brownie crumbs,a scoop of vanilla ice cream and bits of walnut.. perfectly made)
Chicken coleslaw sandwich (served with french fries and sauce and the filling was much enough and perfectly made with the creaminess of mayo and and tenderness of chicken)
Spicy chicken salad(well this was a bit spice and lill more tangy but had heart warming pieces of shredded chkn mixed with lettuce and purple cabbages and cubed bell peppers)
BBQ chicken (this was really nice one but it more represented chkn stir fried in some sauce..still it was too good with large chunks of tender chicken perfectly sauteed in sauce)
The bill came riding in a bicycle that made the satisfaction of a perfect lunch date

Got Home Delivery for Crispy Chicken. Priced @ Rs - 150. The quantity was more than expected. Sufficient for 2-3 people.  Taste was good. Really crispy. Not spicy at all. I liked it. A good snack to go with tea or coffee. üëç

Ambience is superb, staff is friendly. Food is good but can improve! Salad was slightly salty and had lack of a proper dressing. It can be improved to the palette.

Surprise ! surprise ! Found this place on zomato and was happily surprised to find a new joint in town. Wonderful food and polite staff and a personal touch by the owner. Thoroughly enjoyed a Chinese meal of soup, crispy chicken, chicken fried rice, chicken noodles, and a lovely chicken salad. The dessert was recommended by the owner which was obviously the showstopper. Will be back again soon to try some other dishes.

After visiting this place a few times and after trying some of their dishes, I can say am more than hooked onto this place for their comfortable and relaxed set up, posh and elegant decor, simple yet classy, and more so for their lip smacking delicacies. 

I tried Chinese here and I was elated with the quality and quantity of the food. The Babycorn Gravy had the perfect taste and the Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice is the best I have had anywhere. I have never had better Manchurian anywhere¬† than the ones I had at The Hubb - It was soft, yummy, tasty and perfect. 

Momos were amazing. I loved the new taste of Momos that you have brought to the city. 

Cheese balls just melted in my mouth and was delicious. But whats best of all is the Cheese Roll that I had tried after your recommendation¬† and I must say it was very tasty. 

I had also tried your Russian Delicacy¬† Veg Stroganoff. It was the first time I was trying this and I just loved it. It was very saucy and tasted delicious with the rice. 

Your Italian spread is new and perfect. I have tried the Aglio Olio Pasta and Mushroom Risotto. Both were just amazing and I must mention that the Mushroom Risotto was one of the finest Risotto - authentic and delicious. 

I have to mention you serve the best coffee - much better than any of the coffee joints. 

Looking forward to trying on some more dishes that you bring under your roof. A much recommended place to chill, listen to some good music, chat with the very humble owner if he is around, eat good food, and relax.

Heard a lot about The Hub but in reality, it came with horrible experience. We have ordered for 12 Plates of Chicken fried rice, 8 Plates of Hunan Chicken, 4 Plates of Thai fish, 4 Plates of Crispy baby corn but none of the items were properly prepared and they failed with quantity and quality too. 

1. In chicken fried rices, I found hardly chicken pieces. 

2. Thai fishes the size of fish is just like double of the glass marbles.

3. Hunan chicken comes with 8 pieces as communicated but half of the plates contained 7 pieces.

4. Now the height is with the crispy baby corns. They send us 4 big containers containing baby corns with the really BABY amount of corns. 

Although I have not taken photographs of all items here you can see the image of crispy baby corn delivered. Trust they may be good for small orders of 1-2 plates but for bigger ones they just shuffled. This is my first and last experience with them :(

Good place, cozy ambience, service was prompt though they needs to work on their food a bit more. Bar-b-que chicken was great, crispy chicken was disappointing and and 'chocolate cake submerged in hot chocolate...' wasn't hot at all, it tasted okayish... Would like to visit again to try the other dishes.

A quaint new cafe has opened up in Kalikapur. This is located on the anwar shah bypass connector, I live in the area and miss the lack of good food joints.¬†

Starting with their logo, and signboard. Although I liked their logo, it's kinda difficult to make out what exactly is inside. Out of curiosity i went in, I ordered an egg crepe with a chicken filling. i loved it. The crepe itself was thin enough- and was fully loaded with the filling.¬†Staff is courteous.¬†

Would recommend, and frequent.

A very new and bright place which is calm and the same time pleasantly energetic. The staff and especially the owner are very cordial and suggestive whereas the food is one of the best in terms of quality in the city. The place is a mix of a cafe and casual dining outlet which serves chinese, continental and thai cuisines. With a big projector placed, it is even a good place to watch your favorite sports. The Thai Fish and cheese corn momos are must haves. Ordered a simple frappe (cold coffee) but found the chocolate sauce to be more than welcoming because I like my coffee to be, well just coffee. But again, others may believe in 'more is better'. Overall, a fresh new experience.

An uber cool place to hang out with your buddies. Located in a quaint street along the Prince Anwar Shah Road by-pass connector,  the appearance of this cozy culinary destination is mind blowing with a sophisticated appeal! 
The minimalist decor,  done with care reflects the aesthetic taste of the owner. While I was not in the mood of filling my tummy, I was pampered with this amazing 'Zesty Chicken on Toast'. Truly an applaud worthy variant from the commonplace sandwiches. I gulped down cold coffee along with this yummy dish. 
Seldom do we witness such hospitable owner at restaurants. I sincerely believe if you are a recluse and want to try a cozy lil space for yourself,  do come here.  
They also have plenty of chinese and continental food to grace your platter.
