The location is not that prime and one can easily say it is in off location. The place is on the main road. No matter what it is easily reachable with the google maps.

As you enter everything is modern and gives a good feel. We went there to dine and also because we were so very hungry.

The ambiance is good. We ordered basic dishes which we generally have along with the Mushroom Cabana. Everything was perfect. We simply savored the Mushroom Cabana and it was so tasty that we licked off even its sauce from the plate.

We ordered a paneer dish and a dal. Both were simply amazing and we loved every bit of what was served to us. For drink I had the sweet-salt lime and it was simply perfect as I wanted.

Overall the place is good. They also have 2 private cabins for private gatherings if anyone wishes so. The seating is good and can seat quite a lot of people. The decor is also amazing. The staff is courteous. Service is also good. The quantity portion of the dishes was also good.

All in all it is a must try and enjoyable place. Highly recommended by me.

The ambience is fab.
Food even better. 
Staff very much interested.
Decor is awesome.
Bit odd location 
And pricing is a bargain.. Overall it's fantastic.
We ordered veg..And non veg both. 
I didn't expect much from chana masala.. the veg one but it's way beyond the veg barriers.
And so was the paneer starter.
The fried rice and chicken dishes are always good. I mean very good.

This is an amazing amazing place. .5 being deducted for its weird location, though it's not difficult to find it. The decor is not top notch but it's surely very pleasing. Service is prompt and the quantity is great.
 
Coming to the food - we ordered cheese balls (won't recommend but good) and kasturi kebabs(juicy and amazing) for starters. We had biryani (just ok, a bit oily), panneer kulcha (soft and stretchy), chicken coriander soup ( flavoury clear soup with exotic veggies), hukka noodles(pretty good), oyester mushroom chicken ( amazing if you like mushrooms ) and something like Malai kofta which was mind blowing. Sorry I don't remember the name. 
All in all a great worth for you money. Best place to visit if you want to avoid rush on days like new year's Eve or Christmas etc.

The remote location of this place makes it so so hard to find.
Even a direct Ola to the place scared us at night coz the roads that lead to it are scary.
But as someone told me, once you enter the place, it will make you forget all that.
The interior is pretty and the staff(thought it was a bit understaffed but i guess it was so because there weren't many customers) were good.
Coming to food, we tried 
Chilly pan fried fish- Amazing,and on a cold night, it will make you hot. üòÇ 
Jokes aside, it was very tasty.
Chicken steak- The looks were amazing, and taste was pretty good too. It didn't disappoint me at all, considering the amount of steaks i had at various places. But it could have used a bit more seasoning.
Gulab jamun- Hot and sweet, one of the best i had. Maybe too overpriced (considering everything else was cheaper and tasty) but worth it. Specially since it was hot. üòç
I just hope they reach out to people, coz no one will know there is a restaurant there.

Without much ado, let me dive straight to the food. We ordered a chicken steak, pan fried chilli fish and hot gulab jamun.
The chilli fish was as good as it could possibly have been!
The steak was good too, the mashed potato of the steak lacked a tad bit salt, nonetheless it was quite aperitive.
The gulab jamuns were the best I've had in a looong time! The best, hands down.
Food presentation wise, this restaurant deserves a 5/5. Ambience wise, a straight 5 again.
The staff were very responsive and well mannered.

Taking into account both food and presentation(food/restaurant interiors), this restaurant deserves a 4.5 stars, but I'm taking the liberty to deduct 0.5 stars for the location. It is located in a very inaccessible place. So if you're planning to go here, avail the cab services, otherwise it's gonna take forever to reach the location.

To round up, a lovely place indeed!

Seldom, in the rarest of rare cases do I care to rate restaurant 5 star. But, this outlet truly, irrevocably and rightly deserves it.
1. Ecopark is located at the extreme aisle side of the city and after spending good time with your friends or family. You really need to find a decent place to dine out. I give my word to you guyz: you can blindly trust on this area. As the name, so the food!
2. The outlet has a complete contrast to the area in which it is situated. So if you guyz wanna book a cab to this area, location entered should be MAJESTIC SUITES. Now, dont thank me for that :) I know how desperate foodies can be. I am one of them!
They greeted us with roasted Papad.
We were 5 of us. For starter we ordered:
1. Fish finger: (6 pieces) Perfect crisp and crunchy with finely baked fish inside. Added to it was a mayonnaise chutney that was served with some shredded nuts or fruits or dry fruits may be. Mayonnaise tossed perfectly with the fish when dipped and taken a bite.
2. Kasturi Kabab: (6 pieces) Forget about Kabab lovers, even non Kabab lovers should try this. Its not just the kabab that matters but an aromatic creamy layer above the pieces of boneless chicken. It was their signature dish as a starter. They nailed it!
Main course:
3.Chicken biriyani: ( A handi full, more than enough for a person, for two it will be short) I had gone through some of the Zomato reviews but I did not find anyone ordering biriyani. I am a staunch biriyani lover. Wherever I go, I first search whether the area serves a decent biriyani. I took a risk. I ordered the Biriyani cos I was done with Aminia kinda tastes which I loathed deeply. 4 biriyanis for 5 people Trust me, guyz I cannot explain what my tongue went through when the first morsel rested on my mouth. See, you have biriyanis where you have a bit more of Jaffran smell or a bit less of spices like the Aminia outlets. This outlet had perfect blend of masalas and spices and every other bits of ingredients put into it. A true Biriyani lover will get it, not everyone is expected to get the taste! And, If you are not that voracious eater.. 3 biriyanis for 5 people will do.
4. Fish Begum Bahar: ( 4 boneless bhetki pieces) As the signature dish, so the name, and so is the taste! The gravy was a bit of North Indian style that perfectly blends with fried rice, naan, kulcha and any other combo. The gravy perfectly blended into the fish balls. It truly was one of a kind, nailed it again!
It was truly a right decision to choose this outlet.
The staffs are so so friendly, so down-to-earth and courteous. I was impressed. Later, the chef also cared to attend to us and ask about our feedback. Thank you.

First of all its a little bit wierd to find a restaurant so outplaced. I had a hesitant about the resutuan from the beginning. After reaching all vanished in instance by the hospitality. Unbelievably sophisticated behaviour. Well maintained table's and decorations. Food no doubt one of the best Chinese I have ever tried. Wonderful experience. 

Just a little tip is that to try to give some fragrance of flavour as room freshner in the restaurant.

Ordered food online via zomato. Below are the feedbacks. 
1) Order was delivered 45 minutes late, when asked was given silly excuse.
2) Food delivered was very less hot/mild hot. This was enough to degrade the taste of food.
3) Food was excess oily snd sweet, instead of spicy. Taste was absent and chicken biryani was worst then road side hotels. 

Will never order form this restaurant in future. I dont know how it has 4.3 ranking in zomato. May be zomato should check and  before certifying rankings.

We went there on a rainy Saturday night. The place is pretty difficult to located but once you enter, it will win you over with its ambience. The decor is beautiful and comfy. The staffs are friendly. Coming to the food, we ordered Tandoori Murg, lovely corn, fish begum bahar, pulao and caramel custard. The starters Lovely Corn and Tandoori chicken were heavenly. It was one of the best tandoori chicken I ever had. So juicy and flavoursome. Perfect. The corn was crispy and light. The main course was brilliant too. Navratan pulao and Fish begum bahar are their signature dishes and it truly deserves to be. The fish was so soft and the gravy was perfect with the pulao. Last but not the least, the caramel custard was a tad too sweet for me and the consistency of the caramel was a bit on the watery side, though my partner loved it.
All these dishes and the bill came up to 977, which is pretty reasonable.

I absolutely loved this place and am coming back again to try out the other dishes.

We ordered for tomato soup with cream taste was great, then tangri bhurwani - leg pieces were juicy and quality of the kheema was really good, made my dinner very enjoyable. Peas pulao and kosha mutton was very nice. Overall it was a great experience and will love to go with my friends and family very soon.

‚ÄúReflexion‚Äù located inside the hotel ‚ÄúThe Majestic Suites‚Äù, Rajarhat. The d√©cor and the ambience was praiseworthy. From the lighting to the furniture, everything was elegantly designed to perfection. Staffs were cordial. On Panchami, when we reached there, it was lunch time and the place was quite packed, yet our lunch was served on time.

We ordered: -
Pan Fried Chilli Fish- The fish was fresh, soft, succulent and cooked to perfection. Though it lacked the crunchiness, yet it tasted fine.¬† [4/5]

Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani- A Chef‚Äôs Specialty and it was truly worth it. I‚Äôve never tasted a Hyderabadi Biryani as good as this. It had 3 medium size Mutton pieces, mixed with the right amount of spices, curd and mint. The mutton was fresh, soft, succulent and well-cooked. The quantity is enough for two people to share. !!! Highly recommended!!! [5/5]

Murg Kagani- This dish deserves a special mention. The taste was heavenly. The chicken was fresh, soft and perfectly cooked in curd rich gravy, finished off with some cream. It went well with the Biryani. !!! Highly recommended!!! [5/5]

Overall Verdict- Outstanding.
Pocket pinch is reasonable, considering the amount. It definitely deserves another visit. A true Hidden Gem.
¬†
It‚Äôs a little hard to find, mainly due to the locality it is situated in. If you don‚Äôt know the area well, just take a cab and put ‚ÄúThe Majestic Suites‚Äù as your drop-off location.

This restaurant was bookmarked since a long time,but I was not being able to locate it exactly..... Recently took the help of Ola and Google map to finally reach this place....It is located inside the Hotel Majestic Suites....
The place is wonderfully decorated and has nice lightings....When we reached there at lunch time,the place was quite packed,but the order was served within appropriate time.....

We, a group of 4 people ordered the following items:
1) Mushroom Cabana- Had heard great reviews about this dish,so had to try it
2) Kasturi Kabab- It was soft and very well prepared
3) Mutton Biryani
4) Chicken Biryani
5) Murg Kagani- Another dish of this place which deserves special mention
Overall,our experience at this place was quite enjoyable.... All the residents of this area must try this place atleast once....

Yesterday it was my sister's birthday and we decided to have lunch at this place... Although we reached there late as this place quite far from Kolkata... The ambience is very nice and they have parking facility ... This restaurant is a part of Hotel Majestic Suites so it is easy to find ... Talking about the food , the food here tastes delicious ... We had kasturi kebab, salt and pepper fish, crispy babycorn and bharwan tangri .... All the starters were so good and the meat was fresh ... We also ordered for some mocktails like Apple mojito , regular mojito , Cinderella and pineapple cranberry fusion.. All of them were refreshing but Apple mojito is the best( Must try) .... In main course we had their famous FISH BEGUM BAHAR which was awesome .... All in all the place is very nice and the food is Great .... Loved this place ...

It was a very splendid experience to be their celebrating birthday party with friends in a PDR. Polite & gentle staff recommended foods briefly. Food was very deliciously yummylicious. Green apple mojito was refreshing. Everyone must try murgh keema Bhara Kabab. Fish Begum Bahar was yummy. Last but not the least Mr subhasish guides and helps you to make a memorable day. Thanks a lot.

Location is a bit offbeat.. Food was excellent. we had apple mojito, kasturi chicken and bharwan tangri as starter. I should say each one is a must try item. A special mention to bharwan tangri which are tangri kebabs with chicken keema stuffed into it. for main course we had butter nun and veg polao with fish begam bahar and chicken kagani, and the equation blended perfectly.
Only thing to note is that they prepare fresh food after order is placed. So, a delay of 20-30 mins will be there even if you are the only customer present.

This particular outlet was long in my wishlist . Reflexion is actually located in the ground floor of majestic suite near derozio memorial college, rajarhat. Decor was splendid and ambience was top notch . staffs were cordial , they guided their customers very well. Our menu comprises fish begum bahar,chicken handi lazeez and butter naan. 1. Fish begum bahar- this dish had the right blend of flavours in it. Fish was cooked to perfection. Soft inside and perfectly crisp outside. An absolute delight. Highly recommended.
2.Butter Naan- Naans were soft and it had  generous amount of butter on it. Goes very well with the side dishes .
3.Chicken handi lazeez- personally I didn't like the dish personally because the gravy was too sweet and the chicken tasted average.
Conclusion- Apart from the location this place definitely satisfies your taste bud. Their hospitality is commendable.
P.s.- their price is very much affordable compared to their quality

Been here for a lunch, we were a group of 10 people. Firstly, ambience of the restro was nice and perfect. Food quality was really good, and we got some nice dishes, which are mentioned in the ‚Äúmost popular‚Äù list. The overall serving time is a bit more, so some extra time should be reserved for the food preparation. But the quality of the food has managed the delay.

Went yesterday after seeing high rating in tomato. The resturant is a bit hard to locate for those who are not from rajar hat as the name "reflexion is not written , rather try to spot "the majestic suit". The resturant is inside.
The ambience was good enough.
Coming to the most important part. Food.
We ordered the famous kasturi kabab which had a very unique test and the pieces were damn juicy. Tasted great with the green chutney. In main course we had fish begum bahar, murg kagani, masala kulcha,cheese garlic naan, navaratna polao and grilled chicken. I usually don't try fish gravy outside as it never come out to be good. But this dish proved me wrong. It was a mind blowing combination of gr@avy and fresh succulent vetki pieces which went perfectly with cheese garlic naan. Murg kagani, the gravy was awesome but the pieces were bit hard and not that fresh. Navaratna polao was average. It was more fried rice and less polao. Grilled chicken also disappointed me. May be because i seldom try continental and have little experience about the taste. This.dish looked best but taste was not that good. The vaggis were almost uncooked. Masala kulcha was okay but cheese garlic naan was awsome. 
 In one word, we did not regret and the resturant deserve the rating it gained.

Reflexion is a true hidden gem which we visited few months back. Location is it's only drawback . But in all the other aspects, it deserves a 5 star. The ambience is very calm, peaceful and soothing . Coming to the food, we ordered kasturi kebab, mushroom cabana, fish begum bahar, mushroom peas risotto, butter nun, gulab jam and vanilla icecream. The kebab was out of this world, one of the best in the city. All the other items were perfectly balanced in flavours and quite delicious. Service is a bit slow. But the ambience and food overcomes the minor flaws. A must visit.

I was cluless about the exact location of this place so took help of Google maps. I called them up on their zomato number and they were quick to respond. On navami night this place served us nice dinner. 
I am in love with their Kasturi Kabab. It looked tempting and tasted delicious. We had butter naan and Mutton Roganjosh in main course. They were good and filling. Fresh lime soda was also nice. 
The staff were attentive and friendly. Overall, a pleasant experience.

One of the first things to notice upon entering the restaurant is the stark difference between the neighbourhood and the restaurant itself. The restaurant's interior is elegantly designed and it is designed to impress.
We were the first customers of the day it seemed but the service thankfully was prompt. We ordered the much heard of Kasturi Kebab, pan fried chilly fish, roasted chicken, chicken pasta (w/ arabiatta sauce), mixed fried rice, chilly oyster chicken and tandoori murgh along with of course fresh lime soda; I kinda regret not trying their mocktails but oddly enough they didn't provide us with a drinks menu and I forgot about mocktails. üòê
Anyway, The food really is good but the winner of the day was the Kasturi kebab. I'm not a big fan of kebabs but the Kasturi kebab was amazing. 
The staff here were very friendly and helpful and for an upscale place Reflexion is surprisingly easy on the pocket! Definitely worth multiple visits.

Walked into this restaurant on a quite Sunday afternoon. Located inside the majestic suites hotel, this place is not so easy to find without a Google map BUT once you get there, you have nothing to complain about. Beautiful, beautiful ambience! Very eye-catching and intricate decorations, courteous staff and amaaaziing food too. 

I went with 3 of my friends and we ordered a little bit of everything from all of the cuisines. And sweet lime soda too(because we order it almost everywhere we go)

For the starters, we ordered pan fried chilli fish from the oriental and chicken Kasturi kebab from the Indian menu. The fish was like a normal oriental cuisine which you get in any other posh restaurant serving Chinese cuisine but the Kasturi kebabs were an absolute delight! The pieces melt in your mouth like butter and tastes ethereal *_*

For the main course, we ordered mixed fried rice, chilli oyster chicken, pasta arabiatta with chicken, grilled house chicken which is a special on their continental menu and lastly tandoori chicken. All of the dishes tasted fantastic and last but not the least, the pasta arabiatta was a vegetarian item on their menu but they didn't charge extra for the chicken :)

So a delightful experience overall and we would highly recommend this place to everyone. Will visit soon.

Far from city buzz you get this fine dine restaurant. Easy to locate yet far from city.

Ambience- A complete fine dine restaurant. Dim light over the head, Soft music and well behaved staff.

Food- I ordered Stuff tandoori aloo, Dahi ke kebab , Gallic Naan and Dal Majestic.

Starter were just perfect. Plating was Extremely well and tasted equally well. Tandoori Aloo was best however they just served 4pcs i.e 2 full pcs of potato. Tandoori aloo had filling of mawa paneer and dry fruits and was served with pudina chatni in tequila glasses.Dahi ke kebab was sweet in taste and extremely soft and was served with saffron hung curd.
I was almost done with starter still I ordered Dal and garlic naan and the mess start.
Dal Majestic turned out absolutely awful I added salt lemon and still it remain same however they changed the Dal to Jaipuri Aloo dum. Now it's my bad day or there bad day I don't know the salt was excess I just a bite and left it. Garlic Naan was Average.
Just to leave on happy note we thought of having a mocktail and guess what they don't have any mocktail menu. Ordered a fresh lime which hardly had any fizz.

Suggestions- Have a mocktail menu. Your staff are best in business and your chef is not the same.

Verdict- I would have rated it 4 but No mocktail menu followed by Dal Majestic disaster stoped my hand.

Thanks to its location, this place is less known and less crowded. This place is featured in a romantic collection in zomato. My husband found this place and when I went there it is not at all romantic. We Reached around 7.30 p.m. no other customer was there. But it is very nice decorated place and their food is very good. I loved crispy chili babycorn and their Mocktails. Staff is very friendly, service is good. But its too far.

Located on the Rajarhat road within a hotel by the name of The Majestic Suites. Difficult to locate the place if one is outside of Rajarhat as this place is on the outskirts of Kolkata. Google Maps is a sure shot savior in this case.

My first visit to this restaurant after I read the reviews on Zomato. Must say that the ambience is good. If one is on a romantic date, certainly this is the place to be in Rajarhat locality. The staff is polite and courteous too.

Coming to the food, we ordered Mutton Roghan Josh, Fish Begum Bahar, Garlic Naan, and Cream of Caramel. Food was tasty and good. Reasonably priced.

All in all, we enjoyed our time and with Definitely will come back.

Located in a distant location. Don't even try to walk yourself there. 
Google map is your only hope if you're not from Rajarhat. 
It's located inside a hotel. The majestic suites.
It was great. You get the posh feeling. 
No complaints with the ambience.
Went there on the panchami night and as its distant it was like the only restaurant in Kolkata who had no other guests than us.
Ordered -
Bharwan Tangri - it was chicken leg pieces stuffed with chicken Keema, absolutely delicious. Highly recommended.
Ceaser Salad- the mayo they used might have not been fresh. It didn't smell alright neither tasted fine. 
Coming to the main course. 
Ordered fish begam bahar which was absolutely outstanding. The fish was soft and it just melted in the mouth 
Tried it with garlic Naan which were very decent probably not the best but very decent.
Couldn't post click any pictures. Very sorry for that.
The service was not good though.
The waiter took the soda lime ordered but never brought it to us. 
Very inattentive I must say.

Today on nabomi evening we went there for  couple dinner.. We ordered kasturi kebab, green chilly chicken, tandoori roti, fish begum bahar and last but not least brownie with ice cream as dessert from their durga pujo special menu. Every items were good but specially we liked green  Chilli chicken which tastes quite different from normal chilli chicken.   

Ambience is  good, free from crowd, quiet and calm. 

Service  was also very good, all staffs were courteous. 

Though the location of this restaurant is a little bit odd but I recommend everyone to must try this restaurant once.

Unfortunately the tandoori chicken we ordered was faulty. But the manager managed the situation fine. He cancelled the order and offered us an alternative dish and didn't charge for the same. The best restaurant in it's locality.

Decor and ambience :
This place is difficult to find as it is at a quite secluded place. The ambience is okayish for casual dinning. The decor is very simple with nothing extraordinary or interesting. The ambience is soothing and pleasant.
Food :
We had salt and pepper prawn, kasturi kebab, garlic Naan, jeera rice, fish begum Bahar, mixed raita, mutton Rogan joshand fish begum Bahar. Amongst  drinks we tried chilli mango delight mocktail and sweet lime soda. 
Kasturi kebab was  good. Salt and pepper prawn was way too salty which we did not like at all and mango delight drink was not good at all. Mutton Rogan Josh was also not good in taste and too oily. 
Kasturi chicken kebab is a must try here. 
Service:
Service was  just upto the mark. Buffet was just for the people staying in the hotel which was a big disappointment. 
Overall this a place you can try if it's near to you or else it has nothing extraordinary to wow you.

This eatery is not known to most and hence less crowded thanks to its location. The ambience and service is pleasant. They serve Continental, Oriental, Indian cuisines along with heartful mocktails. The first time I had visited this place almost a couple of months ago gave me enough reasons to pay a second visit. This time however i missed the Mohitos which I had on my last visit.
The starters were amazing with Mushroom Kabana and Crispy Babycorn among my favorites. The main course of Daal Makhani, Nargis Kofta and Narvatra Pulao was a perfect combo.
The Bell Pepper, Cherry Tomato and  Risotto was good and contained good amount of cheese. 
The quantity served in a portion is enough for two and the quality of service is upto standards. 
A nice place located in the vicinity of IT hub of Kolkata for foodies who are searching for a new place to satiate their foodgasm.

Reading the reviews on Reflexion helped me make up our minds that Reflexion was where we would go for lunch but after getting there and experiencing the place reinforced our decision to be the right one. Everything from the welcome to the departure was perfect.

 

A special word of mention goes out to Mr. Subhasis Das Manager who made us feel at home. He‚Äôs a person who not only knows his job but goes beyond his duty to make you feel comfortable. Thanks for the invitation once again to reveal the first look of Durga Puja Special Menu for 2017.

I had a wonderful lunch at Reflexion recently. I was invited to try the special menu which they are going to have for Pujo. First of all, the place looks elegant and lavish. Secondly, the service is exceptional. I was quite delighted to visit this place. 

The entire menu was restricted mainly to North Indian cuisine. We started with the mocktails - Apple Mojito and Spicy Mango Delight. The Apple Mojito was fizzy and perfectly served to quench my thirst. The Mango Delight was salt rimmed and had a punch of spice. 

Moving on to the starters, The Afghani Paneer Tikka had succulent paneer cubes which were soft and creamy. There were two chicken starters, Green Chilli Chicken and Chicken Kasturi Kebab. The former had juicy chicken pieces cooked in a coriander sauce while the latter had delicious chicken pieces grilled to perfection. The last among the appetizers was Fish Amritsari where the fish was coated in a spicy batter and fried to crispness. 

The main course started with a number of veg and non veg delights. The vegetarian section had Dal Makhani, Baag Bagicha and Saam Savera. I particularly loved the Saam Savera which has koftas made of spinach and cream cooked in a sweet gravy. Among the non veg section, the Posto Murgi tasted great. However, I completely fell in love with the Fish Begum Bahar and Kosha Mangsho. These dishes were paired up beautifully with Veg Pulao and Naan. It was good to witness that no compromise was made in the main course section. 

The dessert option was Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. The brownie had a wonderful texture. It was served hot, spongy and was full of nuts. It was topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, which was further drizzled with chocolate sauce. 

Overall, it was an amazing lunch. Everything in the menu was cooked to perfection. These dishes would be available in their buffet at INR 799 + taxes per person. I would definitely recommend this place if you're planning to skip the hustle and bustle of the city during pujo and enjoy a grand meal.

Reflexion is a grand looking restaurant, and I was here to try there Sharodiya special menu. The place is well decorated and looks very elegant. 
The spread had a number of items, maximum from the Indian section. This pujo special menu was quite a lavish one. 

So we started our gastronomical journey with two fabulous mocktails - Apple Mojito and Spicy Mango Delight. The former was chilled and refreshing, while the latter was spicy and was served in a salt rimmed glass.

Next up, we started with the appetizers. The Afghani Paneer Tikka had succulent paneer cubes grilled to perfection. The pieces were creamy and had a beautiful flavour. The chicken starters included Green Chilli Chicken and Kasturi Kebab. The chilli chicken was adorned with veggies and had a wonderful taste. The Kasturi Kebab on the other hand was moist and juicy which made it perfect. The last starter of the afternoon was Fish Amritsari. Batter fried pieces of fish were served with green chutney. This tasted brilliant to say the least. 

Moving on to the main course, we started with a number of side dishes paired with Naan and Veg Pulao. The first item was Dal Makhani which tasted quite good. Next we had two veg dishes - Baag Bagicha and Saam Savera. Both tasted extensively good. Definitely a good choice for vegetarians. Finally we moved on to the non veg dishes - Posto Murgi, Fish Begum Bahar and Mutton Kosha. The Posto Murgi tasted fantastic with the Pulao. However the Fish Begum Bahar tasted out of this world. The gravy was spicy and flavourful. Special mention should be made of the Kosha Mangsho which deserves a standing ovation. It tasted heavenly when paired with the Pulao. 

The dessert option was Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream. The brownie was rich and gooey and tasted sinful.

Overall, this place deserves a full score because of its excellent interiors, fast service and amazing food. You can't give this place a miss during Pujo! Perfect hospitality and more than perfect food.

I happened to visit , reflexion just a day back, and I must say I was amazed by both, the interior decoration and the food I was served. 
It really did stand up to my expectations. 

We ordered for green apple mojito, virgin mojito and the spicy mango delight, out of which the first 2 are a must haves. 
For starters , I would recommend the afghani paneer tikka, green chilli chicken and fish amritsari. Loved them. Also the kasturi chicken kebabs were tasty. 

Coming to the main course, we settled for the classic daal makhani, a mixed vegetable called baag bagicha, shaam savera kofta , fish begum bahaar, and posto murgi as sides for veg pulao and naan. 

The kosha mangsho (mutton) needs special mention because of its amaazing taste. And quality. It complemented the naan perfectly.  Alongside, all the other items were delicious. 

For the sweet dish, my pick was the chocolate brownie with ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. 

Please note, that all of this are a part of the new sharodia menu at reflexion, the majestic suites. Rush to get all of this and more for reasonable pricings.

I came to know about this restaurant from a family friend and after hearing so much praise about it, I decided to visit this place with my family. It took us 1 and a half hours to reach this place after a long drive from the city area to Rajarhat, New town. I was awestruck by the ambience just after I entered. The staff greeted us with a cosy welcome and the place looks so beautiful with yellow lights and pretty decor. It's spacious and has a private area as well. It has enough tables to accommodate a large number of customers.
We went for lunch and we ordered:
1. Apple Mojito- This is the first time I tried apple flavoured mojito and it didn't disappoint me.
2. Spicy mango Delight- Never had any spicy drink before, so I wanted to try this. This drink has a perfect blend of spicy chilis with mango juice and they will make your throat burn a little but you will love the taste.
3. Green chili chicken - this doesn't taste like the ordinary dry chili chicken. It is served with veggies and the presentation looks fantastic. Tastes top notch.
4. Chicken kasturi kebab- this is a starter dish and has a perfect mixture of Indian spices served with pudina dip. I can't get over the taste.
5. Fish Amritsari- this is a Fish kebab, the pieces are tender and juicy and melts in your mouth in no time. It is very taste and I had an extra piece as well.
6. Afghani Paneer tikka- I am a meat lover but my mom wanted to try this paneer kebab, but it didn't disappoint me at all. The paneer is so well cooked and soft that it made me like veg kebabs for the first time.
7. Dal makhani- this is the basic and best North Indian dish to try with butter naan. We ordered two naans for each of us.
8. Baag bagicha- this is a mixed veg dish cooked with veggies and corn and the staff recommend us to try it. We were pleased to have tried it.
9. Sam savera kofta- the dish is so well presented that I took a lot of pictures of it before trying it. It has stuffed kofta with thick gravy. Looks greenish and one dish has 5-6 pieces.
10. Posto murgi- posto, a bong's favourite when used in cooking chicken makes it taste even better. The dish has a good quantity of leg and breast pieces cooked in a mild gravy and posto. Tastes fantastic.
11. Fish begam bahar- this is a recommended dish from their menu and the thick gravy with the soft and juicy fish pieces tasted great with the naan.
12. Kosha mangsho- this is my favourite, I love mutton and they made one of the best mutton dishes I have ever tasted.
13. Veg pulao- the pulao was great to taste and has peas and veggies and they give a good portion of it. All the side dishes go perfectly with the pulao.
14. Brownie with ice-cream- finally after a scrumptious meal we had to try my favourite dessert, brownie and ice-cream.
The ambience is perfect to dine out with family and friends, the staff is very helpful and always ready at your service, the presentation of the dishes are top notch, the quantity and quality of food is commendable. The price is also reasonable and the best place to drop in during the festive season.
Highly recommended from my side.

Durga Puja is all about New Dress, New plans with friends and trying some new fashion. But what‚Äôs about food? It is going to be like traditional way or the food will take its own Puja flavor? Well, to find this answer we reached Reflexion - The Majestic Suites (Lundia Group) to try their Sarodia special menu, which was specially designed for the Puja Days! So let‚Äôs come and explore this place whether the feelings will be like Majestic or not!

First come to the Location. Well, for those Puja times dining, everyone likes to have their favorite food in their nearby restaurant but Reflexion seems like odd in this case. The restaurant situated at Chotopol area, Raigachi, Rajarhat. Few minutes driving distances from CC2 or Chinar Park. So better follow your Google Map, if you are coming here for the first time. But I think their off track location is good for Puja Hoppers who likes to avoid the line queue for dining and also perfect for the Airport Comers.

Before starting the food section, I want to thank you Mr. Subhasis Das for inviting Munching Monks for such an awesome lunch session with their Puja Special items. Special thanks to

Have you ever been to a fine dining place and just went awestruck? If not please do as soon as possible or else you will miss each and every bits of perfection  and pampering you need. Service being top-notch and the ambience just charming, this place is all set to provide you with the best comfort. With a couple of friends i went to this place. On reaching there, we ordered apple mojito and spicy mango delight. Apple mojito was refreshing and cool while the spicy mango delight was indeed a delight. The latter drink will leave you with full of flavours as you drink it- its sweet and spicy. In between drinks, we also ordered paneer afghani tikka,green chili chicken, chicken kasturi kebab and fish amritsari. Paneer afghani tikka was soft and creamy with that subtle flavour that just takes you to heaven; accompanied witht he green chutney it was a perfect combination. Coming to the kasturi chicken, the chicken cubes were juicy and the blend of kasuri methi,cheese, cashew paste and other spices gave way to a beautiful creation. Green chili kebab too was beautiful and lastly the amritsari fish was soft and flavours were balanced perfectly. For main course, we had Dal Makhani, Bag Bagicha,Sam Savera Kofta, Post Murgi and Kosha Mangso, Veg Pulao and Naan. Loved the naan,bag bagicha and kosha mangsho. They were my favourite. The naan was soft, the kosha mangsho was rich and yummm and the bag bagicha(which is basically a blend of vegetables tossed in a delicious sauce/gravy). I loved these items. Posto murgi was good. The pulao too was aromatic and tasty. We finished off with my favourite dessert- chocolate brownie with ice cream. Well this combination never lets you down. The dense  rich chocolatey brownie and the smooth ice cream is a match made in heaven combination. 
I had a wonderful experience. As mentioned above the service is top-notch. They will indeed provide you with the utmost comfort. Will defintely visit this place again.

'Reflexion' by 'The Majestic Suites' is one of the best places in Calcutta that provides its customers with utmost relaxation and quality food. Being near to the airport has added to its growing customer base.

When bangalir maha pujo starts with a maha bhoj then you know good times are here. And the pujo special menu at the reflexion is nothing short of a maha bhoj. Invited by the #MunchingMonks for a unveiling of the special menu, we stepped into the Majestic Suits lounge which lives up to its name. The theme is reflected in the festive decor , and the specially commissioned art work which transforms the otherwise modern interior .
We are welcomed with a cold mango serbet spiced with green chillies and a salted rim. An absolute thirst quencher akin to amer tok. This was followed by the green apple mojito which is so refreshing that you barely miss the alcohol. Out comes the specialised Afghani paneer tikka which is mammoth in size and mild in taste. Flavourful but I would consider making the chunks smaller.
The chicken kasturi kebab is a shammi kebab marinated and cooked with kasturi methi and I'd really tender. The fish amritsari looks great on the plate and has a lovely coating but I wish they used bhetki instead of basa. The green chilly chicken is a must order , it's fun and an explosion of flavours .
The main served with the most delicious of naans , crispy and soft at the same time. The hero of the show is the Kali daal, which you must order even if you hate vegetarian food. The cream on top is the cherry on the cake. The other thing with a cherry on it here is the shyam savera kofta which is alright I guess but nothing Bengali about it.
However the posto murgi , kosha mangsho, fish begam bahar with the veg polau is your dream team for this pujo.
The sweet served after isn't Bengali but nice never the less . You can't really go wrong with brownies and ice cream. However the treat for me was the surprise Dahi ke kebab very considerately arranged by Mr das and the superbly talented chef. These kebab are the bestest Dahi kebabs in Kolkata and they deserve to be in a culinary museum. Hung curd flavoured with garlic and spices works like a charm. They aren't a part of the 799+ taxes set puja menu but you could always get it additionally.
Everything about the restaurant works to its favour including the management, staff and food. The location is a bit of a pickle since it's 15 minutes away from the back of beyond but for good food it's worth every minute of the drive.

Durga Puja is special for every Bengali out their, hence at that particular time they wish to spent best possible time with their friends, family or loved once. On this special occasion Hotels and Restaurants work die hard to create a special menu for this special days. Reflexion of The Majestic Suites is already ready for this with their special menu.

Location :
----------------¬†
Reflexion is a part of The Majestic Suits located at Rajarhat, Raigachi, Chotopol area. Its bit off route & little hard to find. Takes near to 15-20 min of driving from Chinar Park. Their off track location is mainly targeted for Airport comers & people working at Rajarhat IT sectors.

Staffs and Management :
-----------------------------------
First of all, Many thanks to Mr. Subhasis Das for inviting the group of #MunchingMonks for a pleasing lunch of their special upcoming Sarodia Menu. Being a member its my responsibility to thank

Went to this restaurant a week ago and here is my review about the restaurant :
LOCATION(2/5) : You might fall in trouble locating this restaurant but if you take the GOOGLE Map then you can directly land up to the hotel.

FOOD QUALITY(4/5) : For starters we ordered Kasturi Kebab as I have seen many reviewers in zomato highlighting about this starter as their "speciality".The kebab might not be as soft as per my liking but it tastes GOOD I must say. Now coming to the main course we opted for Butter Nan, Fish Begum Bahar along with Murgh Kagani and I have to say that both Fish Begum Bahar and Murgh Kagani was AWESOME (special credits goes to Fish Begum Bahar, it's a must try).Then we ordered Fresh Lime Soda and Virgin Mojito but unfortunetly it was unavailable at that time so can't comment on that.

P.S : This is a restaurant which I will recommend anyone to give once a try. I would rate this restaurant 4/5 but due to its location and the inconveniences faced before entering the restaurant,I am going with 3.5 rating out of 5.

My perfect date afternoon started with a grand lunch at reflexion. As a first visitor we were expecting some delicate mughlai cuisine to lift up our taste buds and we were not disappointed at all.. Starting from tandoori murg then masala kulcha (just melts in your mouth and a great aftertaste...spicy and buttery) a gravy chicken and kashmiri pulao (so delicious i want to have it again and again) and last but not the least tooty fruity icecream.
PS: Only drawback was their service..It was quite slow. Nevertheless it was worth the wait. Surely visit this place again. üòä

The ambience was good...though it was empty when we visited the place. The menu is elaborate but most of the  "chef's special" items were not available on that day...so we had to settle down for the usual north indian cuisine. Not a single continental dish was available...!
Service was ok. Food was tasty no doubt...but overall experience was nothing special...we didn't get to try any of the speciality items. I don't really know how it received such high stars on zomato!

Behaviour of the staff are good but very slow service and they need to improve it. Now coming to the food we ordered Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Mutton Pasinda Kebab, chicken Hydrebadi Biriyani and Mutton Rogan Josh. Quantity is enough for two people and quality was excellent. Pan fried chilli fish was yummy but Mutton Pasinda Kebab was not that good and it was quite salty n spicy. And last Chicken Hydrebadi Biriyani and Mutton Rogan Josh made perfect combination. Over all it was quite good experience. And thanks to Zomato for recommending this place..

Wanna check out for a majestic dineout? Reflexion is the perfect place for you then.Keeping aside the odd location where it is situated (almost 16 mins from Chinar park, Newton), this restaurant provides you with sumptuous delicacies which are pocket friendly as well. 

Location- Interiors of Rajarhat . A 16 min cab ride from Chinar park. You can also avail public transport.

Ambience -  Well furnished and beautifully decorated with golden lights.( 4 out of 5)

Staffs- Extremely friendly and polite. ( 4.5 out of 5)

Food ^_^
Starters- Chicken Kasturi Kebab(Chef's spcl).The kebabs were too good to eat. Soft and juicy. 
Main course - Peas polaw, Navratna polaw, Fish begum bahar and Murg Kagani.

Peas polaw was good. An overdose of peas and beautifully garnished with beresta.
Navartana polaw - The polaw was cooked with chunks of paneer and pineapple . Beautifully garnished with cherries. Since this polaw had a sweet taste, the waiter suggested Murg Kagani as the side dish for this polaw. 
Fish begum bahar (Chef's spcl)- A must try dish. The bhetki fish was so soft and fresh. I usually don't go for fish items in restaurant, but begum bahar was indeed one of the best items I've tasted. 
Since we had our Facebook checkins, we were offered with Complimentary mocktails ^_^

Give it a try. Happy eating :D

Its really a hidden jem in Rajarhat. 
Last nite we enjoyed their few food and more enjoyed the pleasing behaviour of the restaurant staffs as they are very caring and positive towards the guest demand. 
Thanks a lot to zomato for guiding us. 

Will come soon to reflexion again.

I have mixed feelings about this place... The food served borders on the average though some of the items were excellent is taste... However, all my good feelings about this restaurant vanished into thin air due to the behaviour and incompetence of the staff... Apparently, zomato reviewers have a special offer that they would be served a complimentary dessert once they review the restaurant... When we inquired about the offer and said that we wud review the restaurant after dinner and showed them my account...  They said we wud get our complimentary dessert... However... throughout the meal... They kept pestering us to review the restaurant and only then wud they give us the complimentary dessert... I uploaded the pics at that moment and since i was in the middle of my meal, I told them that it was utterly irritating that we were being disturbed to start writing a full-scale review while eating... We found the logic completely appalling and it was the most disturbing thing in the world to be irritated to that extent while having a family dinner... Well... To the food,
The starters were perfect. The crispy chilli babycorn was the best I have ever had.
The fish finger was equally good and the chicken Kasturi kebab was absolutely succulent and juicy... The chicken was soft and delectable.
The mains were on the whole disappointing...  We had butter naan, murg lajawab, murg kagani, paneer butter masala, nasi goreng and chicken biriyani.  The naans were good enough while the paneer and murg kagani were really beautiful to taste... However the other items lacked flavour and perfection... Especially the biriyani was too poor in taste and the murg lajawab was overpoweringly sour in taste... 
The infamous desserts, chocolate ice cream was really good in taste while the gulab jamuns were hot and lip smacking...  Perfect for a sweet tooth like me...
Overall... The staff made our experience worse than it actually was... Wud have visited again but for the inadequacy of the staff... Definitely not sum place i am looking forward to for a second visit.

I dined in this restaurant once. The dine-in experience was good. I have also opted for food delivery several times, mostly via zomato. Experience with orders placed via zomato was good.

Here is the summary:
Food: 4.5
Ambience: 4
Delivery experience with zomato orders: 5

Requests to the restaurant officials:
1. Please add kung pao chicken, hunan chicken and other oriental items in zomato online ordering menu.

2. If I am not wrong, the CGST and SGST for food deliveries are 6% each. Please correct the billing system for delivery orders, where CGST and SGST are being charged at 9% each.

After seeing such a nice review I planned to visit Reflexion. It is 3.5kms from chinar park crossing on Rajarhat road. Restaurant ambiance is very good, staffs are very courteous, food is excellent. We ordered for veg manchow soup, dahi kebab, mushroom cabana, dal makhani, paneer butter masala, fried rice and caramel custard. Food taste and quality both are excellent. Will definitely come back and would recommend friends and family.

Reflexion has been on my wishlist for over a year now,and finally I got to strike it off from my bucket list on this 17th. We had to cancel our plans to visit this place earlier because of its odd location. Located on the outskirts of Kolkata,in Rajarhat, it is the most convenient to take an Ola or Uber to reach this place.

But once you take the pain of all the odds to reach here,the moment you enter the place, you get a majestic vibe.The wooden walls,glass doors,golden lighting and everything gives us the perfect posh and glamorous ambience.We simply fell in love with the decor ‚ù§.

Coming to the food,we ordered :

‚àö Mutton Pasinda Kebab - These were soft succulent pieces of kebab,though they could have been a bit better.

‚àö Jeera Rice - This was good enough.

‚àö Kabuli Naan - It had too much aniseeds which I didn't like much.

 ‚àö Fish Begum Bahar - This is the best dish we had that evening. Four brilliantly cooked fish were served. The fish was fresh and was extremely soft and delicious.Definitely recommended.

‚àö Chicken Kagani - This dish was well cooked but it was nothing special.

‚àö Tutti Fruiti - A tall glass filled with vanilla icecream and fruits,this provided the perfect ending to our meal ‚ù§.

We expected a bit better quality of food after getting such positive reviews about the place.

The staff was courteous and was pretty cooperative.

The overall experience was pretty satisfactory .

For an elegant dining experience Reflexion is the best place to be. This restaurant is actually a hidden treasure located far away from the main Kolkata. The bright, chic interior gives you a posh dining experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Warning: for people who stay very far from Rajarhat, think wisely before paying a visit because it's difficult to locate (maps and uber/ola are always a saviour) and this place is still working on its menu. For example: They do not have a separate menu for mocktails. Moreover this place looks huge in pictures and trust me pictures are deceptive.
Coming to food, good quality Indian food served in a timely fashion, and above all, the taste is supreme. What I really really liked was the *apple mojito* which had a classic, refreshing and delicious taste. Also the *veg biryani* was absolutely delicious perfectly cooked with ample veggies.
Fortunately the prices are not high and won't hurt your pocket :)

A newly opened resturant which is in a remote place of kolkata......so many of the people don't know about this place.....But I will recommend everyone to come here atleast once to taste the delicious foods in a negotiable price.

'Reflexion' is located at The Majestic Suites, Star Residency, 3, Chotopol, Raigachi, near rajarhat area.It is 3-4 km distance from City centre 2.I'd visited here last week with my lover for sunday lunch.First of all ambience is good,staffs are well behaved.We took Mocktail:- 'Virgin Mojito',they have not any other mocktail,It tastes good.Then we ordered Starter:- 'Chicken Kasturi Kebab' & 'Pan Fried Chilli Chicken'.both starters are also tasty,nothing special.Atlast we took one plate chicken biryani,it tastes good.price is reasonable but location is very odd.

Firstly, its a difficult place to find.... one should let the google map lead the way.
The decor and the ambience is good.
Yet the food very much ordinary in taste ..
The service is just too slow.
Really dissapointed , as they had forgotten about one of the dishes ordered.
Hard to believe the high rating that prompted me for a visit.

A little restaurant located slightly offbeat in Newtown but serves some of the most delicious continental delicacies. Staff is extremely friendly and cooperative. Best places for online delivery in Newtown. Try their grilled chicken served on a bed of mashed potatoes and saut√©ed veggies. I frequently order in and have had a good experience everytime.

Though it is located at the outskirts of rajarhat,it's romantic ambience and the hospitality makes you up.Nice wooden decoration with golden lightning complement each other.We have ordered a murgh hariyali kabab which was splendid followed by hyderbadi dum biriyani and murgh kagani.Biriyani was just perfect neither too spicy nor so much oily,and the murgh kagani also.Services are truly amazing and the stuffs,murgh was suggested by them.We end our lunch by such delicious gulab jamoons.

Then we ordered dragon and phoneix soup which is very exceptional and very tasty. After that we had pan fried chicken as starter and majestic suite special grilled chicken as main and last of all bwonie with vanilla ice cream. All together its superb. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

Zomato menu shows a different price list and they quote something different.. Also the food comes from a different named restaurant. 
Food quantity is really less and took more than an hour to arrive.. Spoiled my lunch.

We started off with the drums of heaven.  The chicken was cripsy and the gravy was fabulous. Our main course included mixed fried rice, the rice was quite well cooked and two bowls of rice was enough to suffice three people. The other two items included hunan chicken and oyster chicken which was Mesmerizing. This is a great restaurant for dine in, and the ambience was great. I loved it. üíì

Though this place is located on the outskirts of the city but with its magnificient ambiance and outstanding hospitality it makes it up.As you enter you will see a grand lobby with restaurant on the left.The fine wooden finish all around and golden lighting just makes you feel high.

1:Apple Mojito-This drink was extremely refreshing and tastes excellent and was presented very well.

2:Crispy chilli Babycorn-This was a regular chilli babycorn which was quite good in taste.

3:Corn spinach and cottage cheese grating-This was a chef special receipe in which corn,spinach and cottage cheese are baked in cheese sauce and just tastes excellent.

4:Fish begum bahar:-great fish preparation

5:Daal Makhani-Nothing much to say about this finger-licking dal.

6:Caramel Custard-This caramel custard was quite good in taste.Neither the sauce was too bitter nor too sweet and this made this dessert a perfect meal to end with.

Opted for buffet. But after reaching there, we came to know that there is no buffet. Then we decided to go for rice noodles. However, they again said that the rice noodles that they have written on the menu is actually 'rice' or 'noodles'. Therefore, in my opinion, those who are deciding to come here, please opt for a better option, as there are far better restaurants near Chinar Park.

Situated at the ground floor of Majestic suites, Reflexion is a very popular eatery of Rajarhat area. We went there for a Saturday lunch and opted for the all indian menu. Chicken Kasturi Kebab, Fish Begum bahar, Kabuli Naan and Butter Nun. The kebab was soft succulent, melting in mouth : the most delicious thing we had there. Fish Begum Bahar tasted okayish but nothing extra ordinary. The butter nun was very tasty but I was very much disappointed with the Kabuli nun. The presentation was very nice but it was stuffed with lots of aniseeds which I don't prefer at all and couldn't have the Kabuli nun. The desert section offered many bangali sweets and ice creams but no firni or kulfi so skipped the desert part. Ambiance is nice. Service is quick also.

This is my first ever zomato review. I organised my parent's 25th anniversary in the imperial banquet hall of this hotel. And I must say, I don't think it could have been better. Fully satisfied with their service. Right from the decoration, the food, quality everything was taken care of properly and as per our instructions. Also the rates are reasonable. Their signature dish Fish Begum Bahar is such that even people who don't like fish will crave for it. And the manager and staffs were very polite in their dealings. Overall had an amazing experience.

We visited this restaurant on a weekday for lunch hoping to try their most talked about buffet spread!

First of all, this restaurant is very far from the city and is really difficult to locate in Rajarhat! 
So on reaching this place, we were greeted by the staff cordially and then we were seated in the restaurant.
The restaurant is done beautifully and the ambience is calm.

The buffet spread on that day did not have variety or preferred options , so we chose ala carte .

For starters we ordered:

Veg minestrone soup- The soup was good and not extraordinary. They had mentioned in the menu that the soup would contain macaroni but instead we got spaghetti. This disappointed us a little. 

Chilli mushroom- This was a typical chilli mushroom cooked in Chinese sauces and was flavourful. 

For main course we ordered:

Nargis Kofte- Creamy and had the perfect taste!

Masala kulcha

Veg biryani- It was really fresh, aromatic and yummy. They served it with a portion of Raita.

Overall the food was good but not the best we have had. The prices are reasonable and the staff is cordial and attentive.

We had our son's First Birthday Celebration at the Majestic Suites on Jan 28th 2017.

I had called up the hotel to find out about the place. I was asked for my email address and was responded via email the next day by Santanu. We decided on the details over emails (which was great for me as I was outside India during that time).
Once I reached Kolkata , I met with Subhasis Das who guided us with the right menu options and suggested a few items to be added.

The price was negotiated and all was set. They even arranged a decorator with whom we discussed the theme and the price.

On the day of the event, ¬†we were satisfied with the decoration and the arrangement.
The food which is the main part of the event was simply AWESOME!!!!!

Machchi ka Salan was being suggested by Subhasis to be added to the menu and boy we sure did the right thing. The Executive Chef himself had come around the hall to check on everything and ask me for any queries/feedback. This was highly appreciated by me and my wife.

Every dish prepared - Goat Curry, Chicken Dish, Starters, even the welcome drinks were awesome.

Staff was friendly courteous and very professional. Every staff member present at the event did a wonderful job.

I am so glad I chose this place. Will be back here for sure for another event.

On saturday night, we decided to visit this place situated in chinar park area. With calming ambience this restaurant is best for a family outing. We ordered kebab platter first, which had 3 chicken and 2 veg kebabs. Apart from one or two kebabs it was pretty disappointing. In main course we ordered chicken kagani(as mentioned cooked in red gravy) was served with white gravy having khoya in it. Apart from that the 2 veg dishes were also below par having tastless panner and uncooked beans inix veg. All in all had a bad experience there, apart from nice ambience they have SLOW service and food lacking flavor.

Okay , its there in my wishlist from a long time .. But could not make out to visit because of the location ... Becoz the location is very odd .. There no direct public bus, atleast i did nt know .. The best way to go is by ola or uber .. 
So , after a long travel from kolkata , towards outskirts of rajarhat , its a beautiful hotel with romantic ambience .. The resturant is bang on at the ambience .. So coming to food we ordered Chicken Tandoori at starter .. In the main course we had jeera puloa  and fish began bahar , chicken kangani and the caremel custard and brownie ice-cream will satisfy your sweet tooth üòÄ ...
TANDOORI CHICKEN : Bang on the taste .. Properly cooked, proper taste, perfect moist 
Lovely :) 
JEERA PULAO:  I have a complain regarding this, becaz at first they forget we ordered two they just  came out with one .. The second time we told they said they forget to take the order, after sometime they came with the 2nd bowl of the jeera pulao , but i dint understand i got the 2nd bowl which was smaller than the 1st one .. Dont know .. We just forget to ask them .. Other than that taste was good :) Its the best jeear pulao i had ..
FISH BEGAN BAHAR: Its the signature dish .. I loved it totally .. The one who will not love fish one suggestion for them just go and taste it :)
CHICKEN KANGANI:  The dish which win my heart that day .. Perfect taste .. Very thing about this dish is just perfect.. :)
CARAMEL CUSTARD : ITS a good one .. Nothing unique :) :) 
One complain is , service is slow and they just add up extra taxes which one dont know extra than 
Vat and service tax .. 
Food is tasty :)

A hidden gems in Rajarhat! A bit odd place to find out but I know you have Google Maps! :)
It is placed on the ground floor of Majestic Suite Hotel in Rajarhat! We booked an Uber so we didn't find any difficulties finding this hidden Gems!

Coming to the review,
Positive Points:
1. Food - Just fabulous! We had continental and this
 place famous for its varieties of continental dishes. They will give you enormous quantity for two and you will be full!
2. Serving time - They served within 15-20 mins of placing order which is really good!

3. Ambience and Decoration - One of the finest Decorations I have ever seen! Ambience is awesome
 too! Decorations with Mason Jars and Old Bottles along with Fantastic Light Beams will make your day!
4. Staff behaviour - Waiters behaviour are good and they will make you understand the dishes, which one is better to have which one is not!
5. Pocket Pinch - I will not say it is a Pocket Friendly restaurants but when there is good food money doesn't matter right? They accept Paytm.

Negative Points:
1. The place, the only one thing which can be your concern. Best is to get an Uber or Ola! Quite an Odd place it is!

We ordered two items:
1. Non-Veg Ceaser Salad - Damn tasty! Contains Chicken Pieces, Loads of Vegetables, Butter and many more!
2. Majestic Suites Special Grilled House Chicken - With bread, rice, potato and two very big pieces of Chicken Breast and Thigh! Taste was fabulous!

If you are a continental lover, like me, please do visit this place once, I will recommend! You will love every bit of it I can assure! Now, next time it will be Indian Cuisine! Must Try!

We went for lunch with another family on a Saturday, we were the only people there. This was a surprise to me since the reviews are otherwise so good & I was expecting to see some crowd on a Saturday afternoon. Guess the reason is the location and lack of advertisements by the hotel management. 
Service was ok-good and food was good, not great. Reasons are the chicken shorba and d Reshmi chicken kebab were both hot. We have never found these 2 dishes which our likes so much, this hot anywhere else. I believe the chef put more pepper powder than required. Rest of the dishes were good - Tomato and lime-coriander soup, haka noodles, chicken buttermasala and peas pulao. However tandoori chicken was also a let down, wasn't up to d taste we have had elsewhere.
Hope there is improvement n good aspects maintained.

It's truly a hidden gem hidden in rajarhut. The food was extremely tasty.. And the behavior of the staffs were really good. Only the location is a little bit difficult to locate. But the food makes it up.  We ordered non-veg ceaser salad and grilled chicken.  Both were very tasty. We Would like to visit them again and try their Chinese and Indian cuisine.

Ordered mixed fried rice for home delivery to try their  food as I saw the high rating. Delivery was on time. Taste/Quality is ok but highly overpriced. Will not order again.

A majestic experience last Saturday we had a friend's birthday so after brain storming a few restaurants.i chose Reflection for our destination & I am really happy I chose it.coming to the placement of the hotel it's bit odd as its location is quite inside the Rajarhat area so we booked a Ola. When reached the place we were only two groups in the restaurant.we were greeted very warmly & friendly way.as we were 6 people so we were placed near the end of the restaurant near the mocktail bar.Coming to the ambience it has his own beauty with the wooden walls rustic chairs and tables.4 out of 5.service was the most desired one.not to fast not to slow.they were really courtesious,so I would really like to mention their name but I couldn't get those.but surely sharing their photos.so for service for first time I am giving someone 5 out of 5.Coming to foods we started with starters like crispy chilly baby corn, Tandoori murg,Ceaser salad,Blaken chicken.Mocktails Blue lagoon mojito & white mojito.The Best crispy chilly baby corn till date perfect crunch with perfect taste I loved it.The tandoori murg was soft like cotton & tasty like it should be.ceaser salad was good with all the fresh herbs,Blaken chicken was also more like a salad than a starter dish.coming to the main course we had a vegetarian in our carnivore lot.so for him we had Nargis kofta,Dal makhani & Masala kulcha.for us it was Fried rice with Fish Began bahar,Ghost Hyderabadi & lamb in hot garlic sauce.a special mention for the vegetarian foods it was as awesome as it looked & also the taste was yummy.fish begam bahar was a little sweeter in taste but the fish was tender it was well balanced.Ghost Hyderabadi was a Mutton dish with a bit of curry leaves & red chillies.again a tender mutton dish with well balanced taste.Lamb was bit tough compared to the other two dish but was as tasty as others.In dessert we ordered for Butterscotch ice-cream but they said it was spoiled some how so it was a single let down of the whole day.so we settled for mango, strawberry & vanilla ice cream.So yet another happy tummy for me.5 out 5.This is the second restaurant which has made me give them a full rating.Happy to visit numerous times.looking forward to visit again soon.Bon appetite.

Mutton Pasinda Kebab : 10/10

Butter Naan
Murg Lajawab : 10/10

As beverage

This place is simply amazing. I visited Reflexion for lunch, with a group of friends.

We started off with APPLE MOJITO. It was very refreshing.
Then went ahead with Chicken Kebabs, Blackened chicken, salt n pepper fish for starters. Everything was very well prepared.
For the main course we had fish begumbahar, nasi goreng and few mutton dishes.
The food is really superb.

Reflexion, or you call a reflection of perfection of a restaurant.  The restaurant is situated in rajarhat, but the Ambience is something you will fall in love with.  
I visited the fine dining last weekend with my friend for lunch. 
We tried numerous dishes but here are something which i will surely recommend and something i really liked- 

Strawberry blossom - Awesome Blossom. Just wow,  very much flavourfull.  Loved it 

Apple mojito -  Something which is  perfect to start with.  Very well presented and Good taste.  

Mutton Pasinda Kebab -  Mutton kebab are very rarely perfectly brought in the city.  But not this,  it was very tender and tastefull.  

Fish Pepper salt - Fish lovers should not miss on this on. Very fine with decent taste.  

Nasi Goring Rice- Mouth Watering. Lovely in taste and very appealing. 

Fish BeganBahar- Very fitting and get quality as well as quantity.  

Murg kagani - Delicious Gravy with tender chicken which melts in your mouth. 

Dessert - 

Caramel Custard - Decent Sweet in taste which makes the dish taste rich and perfect.  

Tutti Frooti -  Very cute and treat to eyes.  This was perfect to end with, little sweetness and lovely brought up.  

Lastly the Service was attentive, Friendly and professional.  

It was a great after spent, happy visit. 
Recommended for sure

Reflexion is the true reflection of what a restaurant should be.

Though this place is located on the outer skirts of the city but with its magnificient ambiance and  outstanding hospility you are surely gonna fall in love with this place.As you enter you will see a grand lobby with restaurant on the left.The fine wooden finish all around and golden lighting just makes your experience a royal one.They have a huge and comfortable seating capicity and few private spaces in restaurant for a small gathering.We were also driven by the service by them and food that was served.We had-

1:Apple Mojito-This drink was extremely refreshing and tastes excellent and was presented very well.

2:Crispy chilli Babycorn-This was a regular chilli babycorn which was quite good in taste.

3:Corn spinach and cottage cheese grating-This was a chef special receipe in which corn,spinach and cottage cheese are baked in cheese sauce and just tastes excellent.

4:Shabnami Kofta-This curry consist of a vegetable balls cooked jn golden yellow gravy and was quite good in taste.

5:Daal Makhani-Nothing much to say about this finger-licking dal.

6:Caramel Custard-This caramel custard was quite good in taste.Neither the sauce was too bitter nor too sweet and this made this dessert a perfect meal to end with.

7:Tutti Frutti-We were just amazed at the presentation and taste of this tutti frutti.It was just amazing.

Reflexion is a long way drive from Kolkata, but your journey isn't a waste. Make your appetite because something wonderful is in store at Relfexion.
The ambiance is truly majestic you can see that from the pictures below.
Food is mind blowing. Here are few things that i loved.
For drinks order Apple Mojito, this is wonderful to have. Also try the Strawberry Blossom was brilliant.
For the starter we had Majestic Chicken Kebab and Fish Begumbahar and both of them were wonderful to taste.
Coming to the main course we ordered Gosht Korma Masala and Nasi Goreng Rice both of them were lived very much around the table.
Tutti Fruity at Reflexion is something you can't afford to miss at the end. This was the perfect desserts to end our lunch with.

Reflexion is located within a three star property in Gopalpur, Rajarhat Area. Free & faraway from the hustles of the city. Its a whole new world as you enter the place..it wows & dazzles you with its unique interiors. Coming to the gastronomic part, i tried the Majestic Chicken Kebab in staters which was excellent. Out of the mains, i opted to go with Fish Begumbahar & Murgh kagani, again i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of fish they had on offer. A superb experience & would love to visit again in the days to come.

The Saturday scenes began for me by visiting ecopark in rajarhat with a group of friends. Two hours through the activities when the hunger pangs gave us a gentle notification to look for food. Looked up zomato and found Reflexion in the listings. Switched over to the maps and reached the place in a jiffy without any hassle.

Much to my delight the valet service was available. Went inside the restaurant and was given a table pretty quickly.¬† The interiors has been laid out keeping urban conceptualisation in mind and it looks fantastic. The seating was very comfortable too.

Now coming to the food. As we were in a group it enabled us to order for variety. The food and beverage ordered were-

1) Apple mojito- It was a muddled drink which had mint leaves and thin wedges of apple. Just the right refreshing drink one can ask for.

2)¬† Strawberry blossom-¬† served in a beautiful margarita glass it sure will go down as one of the best blossoms i had.

3)Mutton pasinda kebab- boneless pieces of mutton marinated with different spices and cooked in tandoor. This starter is for all mutton lovers.

4) Majestic chicken kebab-¬† The name was apt for this kebab as it was truly majestic. It had a hidden flavour of pomegranate which came as¬† an after taste to the palate.

5)Fish begumbahar- basa fish nestled in a smooth consistency gravy which was a lip smacker.

6)Nasi goreng rice- This is a lovely Indonesian¬† version of a fried rice served with prawn chips and a skewered chicken.

7)Gosht korma khara masala-¬† The highlight of the luncheon was this item particularly because of the sheer juiciness and tenderness of the mutton. Must try item here with the select indian breads on offer.

8)Caramel custard- it was a smooth textured rich dessert having squishy consistently with a layer of caramel on top . I was more than happy to see that this place has justified the authenticity of this french dessert.

9)Tutti fruti-¬† Vanilla ice cream containing mixed fruits and glassed with a wafer roll is an old school dessert. Loved every bit of it.

The service here is brisk and they anticipate well with regards to the diners requirements.
Lovely ambiance , scrumptious food and courteous staff are the highlights of this restaurant. Highly recommended for all the gourmand in the city. Keep it up team Reflexion!! üëå

This place should be easy to locate using maps and gps and can be easily spotted from the road.
Ambience 10/10
Service 9.5/10

**Review**
‚ô°Strawberry Blossom(9.5/10): This drink is delicious with accurate sweetness and favour. Handle the glass with care or you can spill, they should consider this.

*Starters*
‚òÖMutton Pasinda Kebabs(10/10) are the best choice for a starter, it serves 3 people easily if multiple starters are opted. The flavors sprout from the very first bite.

‚ú©Majestic Chicken Kebabs(8/10) is their speciality as you can make out from their name, which was a very good item with well cooked and aptly sized 6 pieces.
‚òÖFish Pepper Salt(10/10) is a must try if you want a fishy starterüòâ. Palatable pieces of tender, golden fried fish are magical.

*Mains*
‚ú©Fish BegumBahar(10/10) is love. I haven't tasted a better begambahar than this. It's completely value for money.
‚òÖNasi Goring Rice(9.5/10): This comes with 2 big prawn chips, a poached egg and 2 chicken skewers. The rice has a remarkable flavor in it, try it.

‚ú©Murgh Kagani (9/10): This serves 4 and the quantity is good. The Gravy was delicious and depicts the chef's expertise. The pieces of chicken are so well cooked and tender that it melts in your mouth.

‚òÖIn the breads, the cheesy bread/paratha was my favourite followed by the pudina bread. Goes well with Daal Majestic.

*Desserts*
‚ù§‚ô°Caramel Custard(10/10) is pretty healthy for those who avoid too much sweetness. Mildly sweet and delicious, it even a sweet treat to your eyes.
‚ù§‚ô°Tutti Frutti(9.5/10): Didn't have this much since it's winter but this won't disappoint your sweet tooth. It's cute too.

I don't review veg items always because I don't like veg much, so am not easily impressed no matter how delicious it is for the vegetarians.

There's a reason this is rated 4 in zomato because it deserves it, though located in the interiors of the action area 2, rajarhat the restaurant is attached to the hotel above & lounge beside. The restaurant had a valet parking 
We had went for dinner at 10 and ordered Tom kha khi soup, cream of mushroom, veg malai kofta, garlic nun, dal makhni ,Kashmiri pulao & papad was complimentary.
It took 30mins for the soup to be served, the Tom kha khi  soup was SPICY & the mushroom soup had little shredded mushroom pieces.
The food took another 15mins to be served but it was worth the wait as all the ingredients were fresh & well cooked.
The service & ambience was 4.5/5 & the prices were really economical compared to the restaurants near cc2.
The down to the restaurant was its location but else it's worth visiting for you're late night food cravings..

Main course served with nargis kofta, san Francisco veg roll, chicken shaslik, american corn kernel and hakka noodles with classic mojito. For the desserts we had fried ice cream which was a great innovation by the chef. The ambience was very calm and sober. The food tastes amazinggg!!

We were a group of five people.The  place is near city centre two. The ambience was a class apart. We ordered kasturi kebab and nargis kofta which were fairly served as starters. San Francisco veg roll got me drooling. Chicken steak was juicy and soft. I had Tom som soup and American corned kernel . Mushroom cabana and Cantonese chicken also added up to the foodie delight of the group. In the drinks ,I had mango spice mocktail which again was a soberly served drink. Pretty amazed to dine at this place.

Reflection is a restaurant attached to the Majestic Suites Hotel in a remote area of Rajarhat. I ended up with a mixed experience after dining in here.

Likings -
1. Cozy environment, good ambiance
2. Well mannered staffs
3. Parking place

Dislikings -
1. Service is not value for money considering the taste of food
2. Tremendous delayed service
3. Not all the items being available throughout the days, which is not mentioned anywhere

We, a group of six people entered the restaurant at about 5:45 pm and found that total Continental section is closed due to unavailability of chef, no Kebab/Tandoor/Roti is going to be available before 7 pm, the later was no-where mentioned. We have no choice other than to order Oriental Items. We tried 'Lemon Coriander Chicken Soup', 'Thai Chicken Smoke Style', 'Lat Me Kai', 'Mix Fried Rice, 'Chilli Oyster Chicken, 'Lamb in Hot Garlic' along with a mocktail 'Blue Lagoon'. I didn't found the range of their mocktails anywhere in their menu card, don't know whether they maintain a separate menu card for this or not. All the items tasted above average. 'Thai Chicken Smoke Style' was too much spicy. I think it will be worth to expect a bit more quality and taste in food at the price range of this place. We did not ordered all the above-mentioned item at one go, and the result was a hell lot of time was taken to serve each dish, on an average it was 20 minutes per dish. At the extreme, they took about 45 minutes to serve the Rice along with the main course items of chicken and lamb. Later we found our luck in ordering an Indian Tandoori item, 'Bharwan Tangri', which was the only real gem found by me here. It was a large, tender, juicy piece of chicken leg heavily stuffed with chicken keema, an exceptional item.

Considering the price at which the overall service came, I planned NOT to visit this place again.

The decoration and ambience of the restaurant is good. But the food taste is quiet ordinary. And the prices is also on the higher side. They have to take care regarding the taste

Well it is situated in a nyc location .. away from chaos... I visited it on 1st Jan'16...The decor n ambience is too good, along with the lights which adds to the mood.. Foods were good n tasty specially 'kasturi kebab'. Services were nice.. staffs r good behaved n courteous. Rates of food are also fine. But the drawback is they don't have much desserts . They even didn't had mocktails to serve on that day.

One of the worst place to stay. There was no water on 1st Jan 2017. No breakfast available at 8am. After 2 hours of wait we had to leave without taking bath and breakfast. No water previous day as well. Very tough time with 2 kids.

The manager had no shame to write on my invoice that the guest couldn‚Äôt take bath as there was no water and also the breakfast was not ready by 8am but we need the payment in full. Let me know if anyone wants to see the invoice and comments. My email address is ritz.ag@gmail.com. my number +44-7872338711

Shouldn‚Äôt be more than 2 star hotel with 1 star service. Please avoid.

Oriental cuisine is okay. Not comparable to the kind of food you would get at a speciality restaurant. Reasonable prices. Virgin Mojito is bitter. Not good..pan fried chilli fish was amazing. Hakka noodles too.

This ¬†review comes a bit late though.¬†
Two of us went to this restaurant with high expectations just after Bijoya Dashami 2016 (mostly it was Muharram).
Finding it is quite easy using google maps.
It is a small beautifully decorated restaurant with almost no people around, so I think that is a good way to spend quality time with your date!
Ordered Dragon and Phoenix soup, Kasturi kebab, Lat me Kai and noodles (guess it was Schezwan variety, do not remember it).
Now coming to the food, we loved all the dishes except Kasturi kebab, which we took on the server's recommendation. It was a sheer waste of money!
Also, I think the servers are not up to the mark when it comes to explaining the menu to the customers. Food and setting being good, I think it's very important to have a good service to ensure repeat customers. Firstly, we wanted to order bharwan tangri and we were dissuaded by the server saying kasturi kebab is better, and we were disappointed. Secondly, he does not know selling tactics, I mean come on! Bharwan tangri is costlier, people should push that dish to the customers ideally, that is what other restaurants would do! So, my humble suggestion is to concentrate on the training of the servers properly, rest everything was amazing!

Reflexion was in my wishlist for the longest time ever,visited this "hidden gem" today with high expectations and booked a Private Dining Room(PDR) which you have to book by calling them and they will charge additional Rs 500 for the booking.Reflexion is located at the ground floor of Majestic Suites,G maps will lead you there.Coming to the food,we ordered:
STARTER
1.Jalapeno Cheese Chilli Toast(will give it a 4 out of 5)
2.Kasturi Kebab(5 out of 5 as it was so yummy)
MOCKTAILS
1.Blue Lagoon(4 out of 5)
2.Virgin Mojito(5 out of 5)
MAIN COURSE
1.Penne Pasta with Mixed sause and chicken pieces(it was the best pasta i had so 5 out of 5)
2.Chicken Shashlik(rice had a variety of flavours and the chicken was also tasty so 4.5 out of 5)
3.Cheese Chilli Kulcha(it was so delicous,i could smell the ghee in itüòç)
DESSERT
1.Caramel Custard(4 out of 5)
P.S-I Wanted to have Brownie with ice cream but it was not available at that time,and also Caeser Salad which we ordered,but was not available so we ordered the regular green salad.
Reflexion is worth the money,the service they offered was too great,the best thing is the ambience of the Private Dining room with dim lights and cozy sofas with granite tables,giving you the perfect romantic mood for a meal.The food was also awesome and was worth the money.

This place has some impressive interiors, but isn't located at a place where you just go, explore and get in... You need to plan before.
We went there for a Christmas special lunch buffet. The menu seemed impressive but several items weren't available. Some items were really great and some tasted even below average which averaged out the overall experience. The service also seemed slackened. 

Ambience- Great 
Food- Average 
Service- Slackened

Sometime the location doesn't matter. Reflection-The Majestic Suit is fine dine restaurant located few kms out of Kolkata. The Dining place is Majestic with huge seating capacity.

Apple Mojito is something really awesome to start with. Mind blowing decoration and fantastic in taste.

For the starter order Fish Ajwani Tikka and Lassoni Tengri Kebabs. Lassoni Tengri is just wonderful to taste. Also I liked the Majestic Kebabs.

Then we took the Fried Pomfret, came in beautiful decoration and tasted fine.
Stuffed Aloo Dum was perfectly made with stuffings inside. Really good.
You can't afford to loose the Chilli Oyester Lamb, it was another best dish I had there.

If you love Biryani, Mutton Hydrabadi is just for you. Their Biryani preparation is really well. And taste is rich.

And then the favourite part of all. Cream Caramel on Custard was just brilliant in taste and looks. And also try the Gems Bond. I tried both of them on recommendation of a friend and both stood to be very good.

Reflection's service and ambiance is unbeatable. This Place is one of the finest you will find in this budget.

Must Visit. :)

This restaurant is truly a hidden gem. It is just 10 minutes‚Äô drive from CC2 and location is correctly updated in gmaps. Food is really awesome and few items are pretty unique and I really loved them. 

Mutton pasinda kebab it was literally melting in mouth. Mushroom Cabana, I have never seen an item so innovative prepared with mushroom. Kasturi Kebab, the chicken was really soft and tasty. Malabar prawn curry is also really tasteful and the prawn was cooked perfectly. They also serve mocktails, I tried one with watermelon and it was really good.

I will recommend Reflexion as a place where you will get really good food  with good service. Looking forward for my next visit.

The location is the most negative point about this restaurant. Otherwise food is good. Nasi Goreng rice is a must try, although the fried chicken served to us along the dish was overtly salty. The Chicken Thai Green Curry had more of vegetables than chicken. The pan fried chilli fish and dragon Phoenix soup were quite up to the mark. Plus full marks to decor and ambience.

This is truly a hidden gem in Kolkata.. located in the Majestic suites hotel in Rajarhat.. Gmaps will come to your rescue in finding this gem.. it is a must visit place. Loved everything about the service and food. No complaints. My personal recommendations will be mushroom cubana, mutton pasanda kebab, watermelon based mocktail, malabar prawn curry, fish begum bahar and mutton biryani. The owners of the place are really nice people. This place is perfect for family get2gethers, corporate meetings and friends hangout. Do visit you wont regret.

Reflexion is one such place which is a good example of the phrase "donot judge a book by its cover". The location of this place somewhat goes against it; the place is situated in the middle of a residential area, far far away from actual rajarhat and is a part of a hotel The majestic suites.

The look:

It is kept very clean and is well decorated, the seats are arranged basically for as four and six seaters.  Plenty of glass works made in a certain pattern creates a nice ambience.

The food:

The food is kept normal and devoid of any fancy approach. Have to say few dishes are better than many restaurants out there and few dishes on which they still have to work on. The quantity of a single dish is prepared keeping in mind that it will serve two, so that is a thumbs-up.
Over all the food is quite descent. The price of which is moderate and will not steal your smile with the bill that you might make.

The service:

The place generally stays empty so the service is quite quick and you are treated with all the attention you need. The people are nice and you will not  be bothered with anything else.


P.S: Location is seriously an issue.

Went for the birthday treat of my husband...took a special candle light dinner with sufficient amount of balloon decoration which I asked for.... ambience was good... behaviour was extremely nice....food was delicious!! Went for the chef's choices...each of them were lovely...a bit hold over the salt would be the only thing I can suggest and ofcourse interiors can be a little better for the special personal dining areas....enjoyed everything!!! :)

Difficult to locate. It on the main road of rajarhat connecting with the road connected towards the Honda showroom opened on the main road. From outside its very simple, but from inside its beautiful. Valet parking is available. Went on sunday for lunch, was a sudden program. They didnt had continental items which were in the menu. They didnt had a menu for mocktail or beverages. We had ordered sweet corn soup, crispy chilli Babycorn, stuffed potato, veg. Fried rice, Babycorn and brocoli in tausi sauce and fresh lime soda sweet. There serving need to improve, foods were falling on us and on the table. Quality and quantity was good. Pocket friendly. Food was delicious.

Pi cant even believe how this restaurant got 4.4 rating. Fake people and own staffs are commenting and giving rating to get a high rating .

Food and drink was pathetic. Even fried food they just microwave and serve you.

Somany pictures of drinks you can see in the photos, real thing is they don't have those drinks . They have only limited 3-4 drinks and they don't have menu for this , like a dhaba waiter would sing it for you..

Due to the really impressive reviews, I decided to give this restaurant a try. In terms of location, it will be a bit difficult to reach here as it is located at the farthest end of the city and due to that, when I finally reached here, it was already 2:30PM.

Now comes the reason why I am rating it a bit lower. After we went inside, none of the waiters greeted us and we¬†were on our own to select the table and most of the empty tables were dirty. There were tissues on the tables and on the seats as well. We finally sat down on one and waited for the menu. Even after fifteen minutes of waiting, still none of the waiters seemed to have noticed us and we were getting frustrated. Finally, we called one of the waiters and he then called some other guy to attend us and he gave us the menu after that.

After going through the menu, we decided to order. There are three sections, Indian, Continental and Oriental and the waiter told us that Continental dishes were unavailable. That was disappointing and we chose the starters from the Indian and Oriental section. We ordered,
1. Murg Hariyali Kabab and the waiter told us that it would take a lot of time(30mins) so we canceled.
1. Kasturi Kabab
2. Lat Ma Kai

The starters arrived after 20mins and we were getting impatient. As for the tastes, they were delicious! Both the starters were amazing and I have absolutely nothing but praise for them. Then we browsed through the menu again and started ordering the main course and the waiter now told us to only order from Indian. Another disappointment.
We ordered,¬†
1. Plain Rice
2. Peas Polao
3. Fish Kolhapuri
4. Murg Kagani

Once again, the dishes were awesome. The gravy was delicious and the portions were also good for two people. The food was the only thing that deserved the praise. After the bill arrived, we gave the waiter the debit card but even after trying for 10minutes, he couldn't get it to work as there was no signal inside. Again a disappointment. Finally, I paid them through PayTm.

So to sum it up,
Pros :¬†
1. Amazing food
2. Ambience is very nice

Cons:
1. Service is a real disappointment.
2. Of the three sections (Indian, Continental and Oriental) only one (Indian) was available.
3. Payment service was painful.

So if you care only about the food then this place should be on your list, otherwise, maybe other places can be a better choice.

Awesome place and awesome foods. Located in a bit outskirt otherwise this could be one of the best restaurants in the city. I loved every food served here and the pocket pinch was also relatively less. Behavior of staffs also welcoming. Definitely want to visit again.  From soup to kebab and traditional Indian to continental taste was not bad for any dish. Definitely want to visit again. The caramel custard was also good in desert.But on the Mahalaya day there was some electricity issues. Pls look into that.

Situated quite far from the main city makes the place not so popular unless it gets reviewed. Hence, on the occassion of my brother's last day in Kolkata, we decided to visit the place. The decor is quite mesmerizing, with bright and beautiful colors everywhere and the place is light up quite nicely. We had ordered Minestroni A la Italiane Soup was filled with pasta, bits of corn and topped with some cheese, which was the best I have tasted till date! Also the curd kebabs were extremely soft and melted in the mouth.
For the main course, we had ordered shabnami koftas and fish begum bahar with masala kulchas and garlic naan. I must mention that the koftas were extremely soft served in a kind of sweet of gravy which balanced the spicyness of the kofta (I don't eat spicy food). The fish too was extremely soft and had a perfect combination of tangyness and texture.
After a fulfilling meal we decided to have drinks for which we ordered virgin mojitos and a apple mojito, both of which were quite decent and the virgin mojito tastes quite better than what you can get in any other eatery.
This place is a must visit. Do not forget to book a cab on your way home. Also, do not miss out on the soup.

Reflexion is the reflexion of what we call a fine diner Multi Cuisine Restaurant. Located at Rajarhat just few mins ahead from City Centre 2 near the Green Heights Complex at Chotopul. This place is all about happiness and a luxurious feeling.¬†
With the luxurious Interiors and designs you see the charm itself which need no introduction. The Place have been renovated again and now inclusive of the mocktail section inside the restro.¬†
Dined in here with some of my close friends for some fun and pre Diwali Dinner.
It all started with few rounds of Mocktails in forms of Mango Delight, Apple Mojito, Lemon Grass and Water Melon. Each and every drink has their own distinctive taste and equally very refreshing. Special mention to Apple Mojito which was awesome.
Secondly we had Some starters from the menu. As we were too many so it needed quite some plates. We has the Veg Gold Coin first up. It was the Veg starter. I am not fond of veg Starters but liked it very much.
The Lasoni Tangri Kabab, Fried Pomfret as well as the Majestic Kabab raised the level up.¬†
We also had the Russian Salad which to me was quite a satisfactory. Special Mention for the Nasi Goring Rice which is a must try dish here. Really tasty and innovative one.¬†
In the Main Courses we had the Mixed Hakka Noodle, Chilli Oyester Lamb, Mutton hydrabadi, Murgh Handi Laziz and Navaratna Pulao just kept us interested throughout the time with their brilliant taste.¬†
Lastly we had the Desserts in forms of ¬†Gems Bond which was a ice cream based desser with chocolate crunches as well as gems over it. Then it has the Caramel Custard which really going to take ur breath away with such an amazing taste.
Overall the Dinner here was a superhit. Kudos to the Management and the staff.

Established on Rajarhat Main Road, Majestic Suites is an exceptional business lifestyle hotel that caters comprehensively to the requirements of families and discerning business travellers, by giving them an environment of luxurious living.

An inseparable and imperative part of the hotel is their multicuisine restaurant, Reflexion. Entering the grandiose lobby, you‚Äôll find the restro to your left. Its interiors are adorned with fine wooden finish doors/walls. The ebullient golden lighting encourages a cheerful mood. The furniture is both adaptive and appropriately comfortable and supplemented with cushioned chairs. There are adjacent lounges as well, if you want some private space.

Shahbaaz Zaman, in association with Mr. & Mrs. Lundia, had invited me to a foodies‚Äô meet at Reflexion where an extensive pre-set menu awaited us. So without further deferral let‚Äôs get on with the appraisal.

Hospitality and service is what drives this place. The attending staff works excellently under the supervision of more than capable, Mr.Subhasis Das. Despite being a manager, he attends to his guests on a personal level and remains aware of their requirements, which makes you right at home. All in all, the service was quite exemplary and at par with any fine dine in the city, if not better.
Not to forget to thank my foodie friends with whom the evening might not have been such a wonder. And the owners are an absolute charm.

So folks that was about it from Reflexion.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Festive season has not died with the end of Durga Puja. Diwali is just around the corner. The festival of fire and lights calls for a special evening of its own. And so we went for a dinner at the farthest corner of the city- New Town, Rajarhat. Driving on the empty lanes of New Town was something I did not experience before. The highways digress and lead you to isolated lanes that are very alien to the Southerners of Calcutta. I will not say that it is the easiest place to locate, but Google Maps makes it simple and leads you straight to The Majestic Suites Hotel.

REFLEXION is my Cloud 9........
The ambience was quite elegant and soothing ¬†and the food was just excellent.....
We tried MINESTRONI A LA ITALIANA for soup and it was just AWESOME!!!!!!!!
The creamy texture of the soup , teamed up with loads of pasta and hints of basil just stole my heart....
After that my mum had chicken scalopini ...... I tasted it n it was the best...... The lemon and ginger flavoured ¬†chicken and the well cooked and marinated vegetables complemented each other very well.....
Me n my dad decided to have oriental food. So, we ordered Singapore noodles with Chicken in Oyster sauce. N guess wat? There were real oysters in it!!!!! I had them for the first time in my life. After having all these , my stomach was totally full, but who dares to skip dessert , huh? We had mud brownie for dessert and the muddy brownie with a hot center and cold vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate ganache was like heaven!!!!!! The prices were quite affordable and service was good.
And lastly, if u're wondering, the DISH OF THE EVENING was the CHICKEN SCALOPINI. YOU should really try it.!!!!!!!!

This restaurant has indian, oriental and Chinese cuisines. We tried sezwan noodles and chicken Manchurian. Food was was good. Ambiance and decor were good as well. Would visit again.
            

This is my second review from 4th visit of the restaurant. We ordered the same dish from our first visit.Unfortunately the taste was not the same and on top preparation was not worth it. The noodles were overcooked as we spotted multiple lumps. The eeg scramble were overcooked and we found egg shell as well. This was unacceptable from a restaurant. On further questions we came to know that they have changed the chef. Definitely a wrong decision from skill perspective. This is my last visit to the restaurant.

I went there to catch up with fellow foodies before Diwali! The hotel is enormous, beautifully decorated and I loved the touches added for the 'puja' season.

The owners, manager and all membere of the team were extremely polite and courteous!

Food and beverages :

*Mocktails :
 apple, watermelon and lemon rass mojito : each of the mocktails was very well made and presentation was killer. My pick would be the apple one. It was so so delicious!

Food:

Paneer tikka : Very good. The paneer was moust and the flavours had seeped in.

Veg gold coin : Delicious.

Lassani tengri kabeb: Extremely well made and juicy.i loved it.

Majestic kebabs : I haven't had anything like this before. The chicken kebabs were pink-ish in color. The dominating flavour was of the 'anar dana' powder used in the marination. Very nice.

Fish ajwani tikka : very fresh and tasty. Fish was perfectly cooked, juicy and flaky.

Fired pomfret : Pomfret was perfectly cooked and the dish was flavourful.

Mushroom and peas Risotto : I liked it. Very cheesy and yummy.

Nasi Goren rice : I loved he generous amount of exotic ingredients used in the dish. Loved it.

Chili Oyster lamb : Beautiful. Loved this dish.

Stuffed aloo dum and naan : the aloo dum was oh so delicious. It was stuffed with flavourful 'chena' and the gravy was tasty as anything. Naan was nice and buttery as well.

Dessert:

Gems bond : Presentation was killer. In a tall conical glass was a scoop of strawberry ice cream and numerous other crunchy elements along with 'gems'. I absolutely LOVED this dessert.

Creme caramel : The caramel sauce was nice and red, perfectly sweet and the custard was how it should be. It was pretty good.

Highly reccomended!

Situated in one of the many nooks and crannies of the concrete maze known as Rajarhat,Reflexion is well worth the visit. The interior and ambience of The Majestic Suites is very soothing and crisp and chic at the same time. Sprawled over a very large area with great seating capacity. Had diner with friends for a pre-Diwali meet. 
We had Spicy Mango Delight,Apple,Watermelon and Lemongrass Mojito for drinks. The apple mojito was the best in taste with its freshness and the lemongrass mojito had the best presentation out of the lot.
The Veg gold coin is a great option for a starter. Deep fried balls of vegetable coated with sesame seeds makes it crunchy and tasty. The lasooni tengri kebab and majestic kebabs were well made with the chicken retaining a lot of its softness and juiciness. The fried pomfret was a favourite of mineüòç.
The mushroom and peas risotto and the Nasi Goring rice are very good options for people who like continental food. The risotto had a very creamy baked cheese layer on top which paired well with the risotto rice. The Nasi Goring rice served with a poached egg on top,prawn chips and chicken,made for a perfect meal. The chilli oyster lamb and the Chef's special roasted lamb with rice and gravy were delicious to say the least. I highly recommend them. We also had butter naan with stuffed aloo dum and daal majestic. The aloo dum stuffed with paneer was a popular dish amongst me and my friends. Mutton Hyderabadi and Murgh Handi Laziz were the non-veg options to be had with the naan. Both dishes were excellent. Well cooked chicken and mutton served with rich gravy filled with flavours.I can't fault them üòÉ. They also make a mean Navratan Pulao. 
When you have such a good meal you expect the dessert to be excellent too. The caramel custard totally lived up to the expectations. Light custard topped with the caramel syrup is an unbeatable combination and they got it just right. We also had Gems Bond,which was strawberry ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with Gems. 
The service was good,although it can be a little faster. The staff was very professional and polite.
After dining at Reflexion I must say that my Diwali celebrations stated early this year üòÅ. Thanx for the lovely meal Reflexion!

Reflexion was like an oasis in the mid desert, particularly I say this because of the location. None the less, had a great time during the pre-diwali meet here.
The ambience is absolutely flawless. Quite a spacious one and well decorated too. The staff there are extremely polite and helpful.
Beginning with the mocktails that we had, each one was perfectly made. Spicy Mango Delight, Watermelon Basil Mojito, Apple Mojito which apparently tasted the best and Lemongrass Mojito which was the clear winner in terms of its presentation.

For starters we had:
Veg gold coin- crisp fried balls of veggies with a coating of sesame seeds. Delicious!
Lassoni Tengri kebas- well prepared chicken kebab.
Majestic kebab and Fish Ajwani Tikka were good too.

For main course,
Russian salad- which I liked pretty much. Chicken, vegetables, mayo, cheese mixed together.
Mushroom & peas risotto- perfectly done.
Mixed Hakka noodles- the usual saviour, nothing special though.
Nasi Goring rice- one of the best preparation with poached egg, chicken and prawn chips.
Chili oyster lamb- decent, because I've had better lamb dishes elsewhere.

Apart from that, the indian dishes that we had:
Navratan pulao with Murgh Handi laziz. Both complemented each other well.
Plain naan went well with paneer stuffed aloo dum and Dal Majestic.

No matter how full you are, you should always make space for desserts. And that was the best part of the meal.
Cream caramel- the caramel custard with syrup. Amazing!
Gems Bond- tastes as good as it sounds. Strawberry ice cream with chocolate sauce served in a martini glass, topped with gems.

Had a lovely time here. However the service could be a little faster. Else, not a scope to complain. :)

The long drive to Rajarhat was worth it!¬†

You'll definitely get a "Feel Good" vibe once you enter the place. The interior is done tastefully. They have a general seating area along with spacious yet cozy cubicles for hosting private parties.¬†

The management & the staff are friendly and courteous. ¬†They will definitely make you feel at home.

While we were waiting for the other friends to arrive, they served us tea, which arrived well presented on a tray. Tea was good :)

We ordered :

Spicy Mango Delight - For those who do not like their drink too sweet and want to try something different, go for this one. It is a mix of salt, pepper and lime with green mango.

Water Melon Mojito - Perfectly made and tasted great. Loved it!

Lemon Grass - As refreshing as a mocktail could get.¬†

Apple Mojito : The winner hands down! If you are missing it, you are at a loss!

Next for Starters, we ordered :

Jaitun Paneer Tikka - Large chunks of Paneer with filling. It was soft and tasted decent.

Veg Gold Coin: If I didn't taste this, I would've never got the idea that a veg starter could be so amazing! Coated with sesame seed, it was crispy, succulent and tasted great!

Lasooni Tengri Kebabs - As good as it can get. The pieces are large, spicy and juicy.

Majestic Kebabs - This kebab should definitely be on your list of "Must Have" items. One of the ingredients is pomegranate and served with a tasty dip, this kebab will melt in your mouth.

Fish Ajwani Tikka - Tasted decent. Could have been little more juicy.

Russian Salad - Tasted average.

Fried Pomfret - Well cooked, tender and tasted really good.

Nasi Gorang Rice - ¬†Again, another item to be listed in your "Must Have" list. This gandharaj flavored rice, served with Prawn Papad, chicken and poached egg, is a visual treat as well as a gastronomic pleasure!¬†

For Desserts, we ordered :

Gems Bond - Strawberry Flavored icecream served with bits of wafer & gems. Tasted okayish.

Cream Caramel - Tasted decent.

I was too full so I couldn't have the other items which were ordered. But you should definitely try their Mixed Hakka Noodles, Stuffed Aloo Dum, Mutton Hyderabadi, Navaratan Pulao and Murg Handi Laziz. All these dishes deserve 5/5.

Recommended!

We had booked for private party with friends. The choice of menu was ours that was agreed upon. The fish menus were badly made. Kabiraji did not have "that" taste. Chital was more shocker. Over fried and over salty plates were quite a disaster. They did not even provide the salad. The party hall beside the restaurant is quite cosy for 30 people as far as the seating arrangement is concerned.

I recently visited this outlet situated at rajarhat during the puja time. Though it was a rush hour the service was impeccable. I loved the ambience. I had the mushroom cabana, palak soup,mojito and paneer tikka. All of which was delicious and the mojito was refreshing. The majestic kebab was very different and was out of this world. I enjoyed the north Indian cuisine too and the navratan pulao was exquisite. Since I could not decide upon the dessert the waiter suggested to us the caramel custard and that was by far the best dessert i had in a really long time. Located in the hotel majestic suites it may be a little difficult to find but is definitely worth visiting.

situated in the rajarhat area, reflexion stands out as a beautiful restaurant. it was an amazing experience with a combination of stunning decor and overwhelming food. we had the american corn kernels, crispy chilly babycorn and paneer chilly for starters alongwith chilly garlic noodles and hot and sour soup which were all mouth watering when presented and delicious to eat. i loved their private dining area which was very comfortable and cosy.. the service was also very well coordinated. totally worth every penny!!!

Located on old rajarhat road, this place is a bit hard to find but it is worth experiencing. Ambiance is very pretty and service is also good. Coming to food we ordered a lot of dishes as we were many people so don't remember every dishes we ordered. The quality of food is very good especially the soups. The dragon and Phoenix soup tasted just and the Tom kha has a unique taste with coconut and lemongrass flavour. I liked the thai smoked chicken and another chicken starter don't remember the name which was also Chinese. We mainly tried their chinese food which they nailed. We took only fish marinara from continental section which comes with two fish fillets with white mushroom sauce and spaghetti with smashed potato. The fish was fresh and the dish tasted really good but dint like the smashed potato, it lacked flavour. In desert we tried the caramel custurd which tasted just wow. Pocket pinch was pretty reasonable for the food and ambiance there.

Totally a hidden gem.
Presentation of food was great.
Tried the watermelon cooler on the suggestion of the waiter and it was ok.
Food was really great, especially mushroom caba√±a, smoked style Thai chicken with peanut sauce. The majestic kebab was the show stopper. Caesar salad was great too.
Good value for money.
Would love to visit again.

A sudden plan of team lunch took us to this multi-cuisine restaurant joint. Route direction? If you are coming from Narkelbagan/Unitech area, go straight from Akankha more, upon reaching the Rajarhat road, take a right turn, Reflexion will come to your right, within 1 km.¬†

Once entering, the first thing that catches your attention is the d√©cor & ambience. It‚Äôll give you pretty much a fine-dining sort of feeling. The waiters are fittingly trained & well behaved, even though the service is a tad tooo slow. Now, coming to the food; we ordered, a Non-veg Ceaser Salad, Bharwan Tangri (as starter), Fish Begum Bahar, Navratna Pulao, Butter Naan & Grilled Chicken. Coming to the details itemwise:

‚Ä¢	Non-Veg Ceaser Salad: In one word, was fresh & refreshing. The chicken pieces were sufficient & it complemented the taste well. The taste of black olive & lettuce mixed well with the grated cheese. A slightest hint of bitterness in the flavor, but, overall we liked this.

‚Ä¢	Bharwan Tangri: Innovative is the word. Tangri Kebab stuffed with Chicken keema. It was delicious. The juicy & luscious kebab was stuffed with minced chicken keema. The keema was on a drier side which went perfectly with the outer moist chicken. Passionately recommended.

‚Ä¢	Fish Begum Bahar: Made to perfection. The fish was fresh & juicy. The gravy was a bit rich in flavor but it‚Äôs perfect to take with the Pulao /Naan.

‚Ä¢	Navratna Pulao: Show-stopper. I had perhaps tasted better Pulao in any other outlet in this price range.

‚Ä¢	Butter Naan: Nothing‚Äôs special. They served this hot & it‚Äôs nice to have with a spicy Indian gravy.

‚Ä¢	Grilled Chicken: A let down for us. The sauce spoiled the show. It was neither spicy nor bland. It had a different kind of flavor, which we thought did not go well with our palate.  

Pocket pinch is on a lower side considering the ambience & food they provide. The bill was within 1.5k (They gave 10% corporate discount as well) for 4 of us. Pretty satisfied with the North Indian cuisine. Their service needs some improvement. Even though the continental main course was a spoiler,  I would not conclude with merely 1 item here. Coming back to taste some more Continental items along with the Oriental section of menu which was undiscovered during our first visit. A nice choice for North Indian dishes on any day.

Well..we tried this restaurant yesterday only and it's overall a good experience. 
Valet parking is available so there is no issues with parking your car. You need to cross the hotel reception to enter the restaurant.
The restaurant ambience is good. It's just after puja so the decorations done keeping the festive season is still there and we loved the same.
We have seen reviews in Zomato and also have recommendations from friends so we were pretty much sure about the menu and what we are going to order! We ordered for majestic chicken and mushroom cabana as starters and chicken steak as the main course. Mushroom cabana and chicken steak were really good. Majestic chicken took huge time to serve and it was served as part of desert üòú.. We would have loved the majestic chicken more if it would have been served with nutty dips (as seen the recommendations and must try) but alas we were served with pudina chutney. We asked for the same and was informed that the nutty dip is finished and not prepared again. A big disappointment for us. 
Price was the items were less pinch to pocket. Just that majestic chicken is a bit high as compared to other items we have tried. Also I would like to inform you all that they take quite sometime to serve so it's better you have some spare time. The restaurant staffs were very humble and ready to assist you for all your queries. The food is quite good and hence I would definitely recommend my friends to try at Reflection and hopefully we will have more better experience with food served with proper dips and less time taken to serve.
Best of luck Reflection!! Hopefully you will take the necessary suggestions and take relevant actions for providing better experience to your customers.

An ideal place for a good dinner, set aside from the hustle bustle of the city.

Ambiance:
There's valet service so parking is not a problem. You enter via the reception of the hotel. The shelves of the restaurant are decked up with colorful Mason jars and some beautiful crockery. The seating is spacious and there's soft music playing. The place looks very comfortable with the options of couch and chair. 

Food:
The chicken majestic kebab is less on the spice. The flavors are amazing though, the chicken is soft and very tasteful. Six pieces of chicken are served along with a 'badam' dip which adds a star to this. The dip is a tad bit sweet which is mostly overshadowed by the strong nutty flavor. A must try! The mushroom cabana is a little crunchy on the outside and there's stuffed spinach inside. However, I couldn't really find the spinach. Tastes much like chilli mushrooms.
The chicken methi malai is amazing. The curry if creamy and tastes real good with both roti and rice. The fish begum Bahar is just about alright. The fish is tasty and fresh while the curry is nothing special. Vegetable pulao is a good pick. Lots of veggies and some paneer. The fresh lime can quench your thirst.
Fried ice cream for dessert wasn't great for me. It had a coconut-y flavor, and I don't particularly appreciate that. It's served on a big piece of pineapple.
All in all, the veg pulao, chicken majestic kebab and chicken methi malai were impressive!

Service:
The staff is very polite and the service is pretty quick. With that said, the prices are much on the higher side and only a few of their dishes are worth that kind of money.

They may me good in serving north Indian food but they are pathetic in making "continental". The floury drumsticks with raw meat heavily coated with breadcrumbs were disastrous. Chewy chicken roast had a horrible bitter dressing (reduced stock or whatever). Why should anyone have roadside quality food paying a 3 star bill. (1lit. mineral water was Rs. 100) Apple mojitto was good and refreshing though.

Last evening we went to this restaurant for dinner.  Its a bit far from the city but if you like long drive you will enjoy the food after the drive.  Its in Rajarhat.  The road which goes in near the honda showroom then take the rightfrom that road.  We had beer and some non alcoholic drinks.  And ordered the starters,  kasturi kebaab,  chandni kebaab,  and majectic kebaab.  Good taste.  I must say chandni kebaab was excellent.  Main course we ordered Dum Ghosth Biryani and Murgh Kaali Mirch.  The biryani was real good.  Light and a nice smell.  Murgh Kaali mirch was also a good one.  Nice ambience and friendly behavior.  Liked it.

I had gone to the hotel for some work. This place is a few minutes from Eco park. I had heard about the good food here from a friend.
The restaurant Reflexion is located on the ground floor opposite the reception.

The interiors are beautifully done up. And the Pujo feel was quite evident with the additional decorations done to mark the festival.

We ordered
Pot tea
Fresh lime soda
Schezwan Noodles
Crispy chilli baby corn
Mushroom cabana

Everything was really good taste wise. Special cabana was a perfect mix of a Continental dish with a Chinese twist. Perfectly cooked whole mushroom stuffed with spinach and cheese and batter fried tossed in a tangy schezwan gravy. It was amazing taste, texture and flavour wise. And were a perfect accompaniment to the schezwan noodles. Service was quick and the pricing is reasonable.

The only drawback from my perspective was the location. Its quite a bit of a drive.

To start with,this place is very difficult to locate but an Ola or Uber would lead you right. The hotel looks good with magnetic gates and all. The restaurant itself looks magnificent. It was what you call it as elegance at its best. 
We went ahead with chicken drumsticks and fish and chips as starters. Both were fabulous so full marks on that. Presentatiom was again,pleasing. 
We ordered lime sodas and a spicy mango drink which was actually really spicy. It was very different from the usual mocktails. For the main course we had chicken spaghetti alfresco and it was food on point. I was personally very very pleased with their food. 
Staff was friendly. Its a place you should definitely try your tastebuds on.
The only problem is their location. And I was regretting coming here during the pujas. Couldn't lay my hands on their main menu. The pujo menu is a much much condensed version. 

P.S - prices are much more than mentioned in Zomato. It's around 1600-1700 for 2 people.

Wonderful food and staff, it offers valet parking, only downside is it's location. You will have to plan for to visit this restaurant, but taste of food compensates for that. I have been here couple of times.

Its rightly stated that - 'A recipe has no soul,You as the cook must bring soul to the recipe .' 
The chefs of Reflexion have literally brought out the soul to the recipes. It's a multi cuisine fine dining restaurant starting from Continental, Indian & Oriental. 
Its slightly aloof as its difficult to locate and there's no conveyance easily available. Better to take your own car or book a cab. 
It's a part of Majestic Suites and I must say that the interiors are well thought off and beautifully implemented. It looks so classy and royal and resplendent in true sense.
Waiters were extremely friendly and courteous and made us really comfortable.
Service was prompt too.

Speciality: Mushroom Cabana - The recipe was so magical that once it gets inside your mouth,you would realise the secret of it. Loaded with cheese and mushroom made in the form of pakoda tossed in tangy garlic sauce.

Kasturi Kebab- must for non. vegetarians. My friends loved it to the core.

San Francisco Veg. Roll - such a scrumptious roll loaded with saut√©ed corn and spinach. Happy to see such new dishes on the menu and innovative recipes.

Smoky Chicken which gave a new dimension to chicken. Couldn't believe that chicken could taste this way as well. 

Masala Kulcha was average. Would have tasted better if it would have been a lil soft and contained more of stuffings.

After days, could kill my hunger for a decent fine dining place in Calcutta.

Hey people! I‚Äôm sure all of you must be keeping super busy for the festive preparations, shopping and all sorts of plans and more. Oh yes! The festive season calls in for such a mood itself. Along with the festivity, comes our urges to have the best of the food during the Puja days be it a lunch with friends or a dinner at a classy fine-dine restaurant with family or close ones. One such name in my list is Reflexion.

A lavish spread of Puja Special fiesta at Reflexion..!

A reflection of great food, friendly hospitality and fine dining clearly does justice to the phrase ‚ÄòReflexion‚Äô. Located in one quiet street at Rajarhat, this restaurant is a part of the Royal Majestic Suites and is situated on the ground floor. The ambiance is somewhat sleeky and grandeur, and instantly transports into an atmosphere of fine dining. The location is a bit tricky, so unless you know your way around, better resort to Google Maps, or hop on to Bus Number 211. The obvious question here might be, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the big buzz with this place‚Äô? My answer to this would be ‚ÄòFood‚Äô. Not being circumspect to the other clear pointers, if I had to clearly judge this place in terms of the quality of food, this place would emerge as one of the toppers in my list. Very recently, team #panchphoron was invited over here for a sneak-peak to check into their Puja Special Menu, and following were the array of delicacies we feasted upon:
            
¬†¬†

Mocktails:

Watermelon celery cooler: Chilled watermelon juice mixed with celery. Cold, refreshing and not too sweet, this was a perfect drink to begin with.

¬†

Nutty fruity: A lovely concoction of grenadine syrup, pineapple juice and orange juice.
                                          ...

It‚Äôs just a matter of few days left and once again like every year the great grand festival of Durga Puja will be celebrated in a ravish and pride manner all over the country and especially our own city Kolkata where one knows it well how to welcome the Goddess and double the enjoyment over great food and refreshments in the huge process of the celebration . There is no celebration or nor fun complete if you don‚Äôt get to eat the best during the festive season .And thats‚Äôs why it is important to shortlist the best places to feast on during the rejoiceful occasion .

Puja Mania on board with Reflexion..!

Eat like a king or savour like a queen ‚Äì your choice. Looking for an unmatched fine dine experience to some place away from the hustle bustle of Kolkata, this pujas? Reflexion is your call.¬† Indeed a hidden gem located¬† slightly off the route, the gastronomic experience is surely going to suffice it. Reflexion is a Family multicuisine restaurant which¬† offers authentic Indian Chinese delicacies and a variety of other dishes that you can savour upon.
            

Location:  The location is indeed tricky. Located a bit in the interiors of Rajarhat, New Town. Reflexion is a part of the royal Majestic Suites, located on the ground floor.  3 Chotopol Raigachi is the address so Google map is the only aid in this case. All those availing public transport,  211 bus route will emerge as your saviour.

Decor and Ambience: Reflexion is a planned restaurant with organized seating. The decor is done in the mix of beige and browns. The yellow tinge given by the chandeliers and bold lights bring out the grandeur of the place. The ambiance is indeed captivating.

Staff:  The staff is amicable, welcoming , courteous and makes sure you are well attended to.

Food: Was invited to the soft launch of their Puja menu and was taken aback by the great food served to us.

Mocktails ‚Äì

1. Watermelon celery cooler ‚Äì The refreshing flavour of watermelon garnished in with celery gave the cooler a sweet and refreshing tinge.

There‚Äôs no dirth of eateries in the city of joy. All in all there are more than seven thousand listings on zomato itself. That‚Äôs only the tip of the iceberg. Not even taking in account the uncountable stalls & roadside shops that served excellent food, there are also hundreds of restaurants who haven‚Äôt enlisted themselves. Recent times have seen a new trend blooming. The three star & mid-sized business class hotels are opening the doors of their in-house restaurants to the common people. Recently was invited to one such eatery.
The hotel I‚Äôm talking about is Majestic Suites, Rajarhat. I being a full on southerner, Rajarhat is a location pretty out of the earth to me. All I keep hearing is the unavailability of transport & good marketplaces. However on checking the restaurant‚Äôs page found plenty rave reviews & was highly excited for the visit. Coming to the location, from the akansha rotary take the Rajarhat main road (take the left if you are coming from CC2), take a right where the road ends, continue few hundred meters, cross Putting Apartments & Majestic Suites will be on your right. The restaurant is on the ground floor. It‚Äôs very well designed, spacious & lively with bright colours & ample ambient light. The restaurant even got two private dining areas complete with comfy couches, should you want to host a small meet up. We were personally welcomed by the owners & the manager who are very jovial. A huge spread awaited us, I was doubtful about how much I would be able to try.

I visited this place on my birthday and I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality of food served. I was with a large group of people and so we ordered quite a few dishes like crispy baby corn, lovely corn, San Francisco roll, paneer pakoras, mushroom cabana, paneer tikka and corn dumplings and none of the dishes disappointed. My personal favourite was the crispy chilli baby corn and lovely corn as their flavor was spot on. Usually these dishes get quite soggy once they cool down but it wasn't the case here. It was quite crispy throughout which was a treat. We ordered the chilli garlic noodles, schezwan noodles, vegetable dumplings in soy sauce and penne arrabiatta and again all the dishes were amazing. They have a wide variety of dishes for vegetarians. And though it's a multi cuisine restaurant, the taste of each cuisine is authentic and packs a punch. As it was my birthday, we were given free dessert which was fried ice cream and it was delicious! This was the first time I was trying this dessert and I will return again for it! The decor, ambience and service are very good. The staff is courteous and well trained. This was a perfect dinner and I can't wait to visit again!

This place is not very well advertised or known to people only because of its aloof location but the place and the restaurant actually serves food that is at par with popular restaurants.

For starter they have valet parking..Phew!! The staffs are very polite and welcoming and the hotel itself was very well done with a little lawn at the entrance. The restaurant is not very massive. Can seat about 10 families i think but the interior was very well done with mason jars ,good lightings etc. The owner has very modern contemporary taste.

We Ordered-For starters we had tandoori chicken and bharwaan tangri- the tandoori was yum and very well done. Did not have any stale smell and was soft and succulent. The bharwaan tangri was a new dish. It was tangri but stuffed with chicken keema. Was humongous in size and also tasted pretty well.

For main we had butter naan, mutton kasha,veg puloa and fish begum bahar from the north indian menu. The fish (basa) needs a special mention as it was beautifully done and had no fishy smell. Tasted like meat. Moreover the fish was cooked to perfection.

From the continental section we had the chicken steak and the fish marinara- ¬†The chicken from the chicken steak was absolutely perfect. It was so soft that one could not hold it with a fork for too long as it broke and fell. The gravy was yum and blended perfectly with the chicken. The mashed potatoes was yum, definitely not bland and sauteed veg were well done too.

Next the fish marinara was done in white sauce with lemon and garlic. The fish was perfectly done but it lacked sauce. Had it been little more gravier it would have been yummy. It felt dry but the mashed potatoes was yum. This dish was served with spaghetti which tasted good with all kinds of herbs but it was chewy and hard. Needed more boiling time. However beautifully presented.

Over all the food was good. Price ok as per the food served.

We had a little complaint though. There was a tiny spider on the plate which probably climbed down from above but they should be careful as they are serving food and hygiene should be top their notch priority. Have the place vacuumed meticulously from top to bottom. For this i have deducted.5.

This was kind of a hidden gem for me! It's located a bit on the interiors of rajarhat, on the ground floor of Majestic Suites. They have vallet parking and the service is quite good and fast. Ordered a Spicy Mango delight following the suggestion from the staff - it was indeed delightful - the spices add a tangier touch to the mango. The grilled house chicken seemed very tempting in the menu so decided on it - And I was overwhelmed at my choice. One of the best steaks I have had in Kolkata - Reminded me of my Bangalore days.
The lunch was totally worth the pocket punch and I am definitely going back soon.

Was here Monday to have a quick lunch.heard so much about their mutton Hyderabadi biriani so had to try it..so i ordered a Biriani and murg kagani which is also featured in zomato and mojito on the side.servive was quick,the waiters are very well mannered.

Coming to the biriani it was very good. the mutton pcs were very soft ,but i found it a bit much masaladar the i would have loved a bit more white rice ,the quantity for 340 is bit low too on the rice front.it had complementary raita with it which was very good,coming to murg kagani which was perfect.ckn pcs were good,the gravy was lip smacking.i could not finish it so packed the rest.
The mojito was good too but like most of the places it had more ice than the drink itself.only 3-4 sips and ends üò•.

They have valet parking,though the place is bit backwards the inside is very good.its not that big but less crowded.
I would visit again to try some continental dishes.

I went to this place with my spouse this weekend with lots of expectations. And I am very happy to say that there a lot more to explore than my expectations. The food was fresh in smell and taste both. But the best point was interior and ambiance. We just loved that. The service was also very appreciable from the staff. Only thing they need to do is to update menu with drinks and desserts. I will expect more variety of mocktails in my next visit.

Went to this place after reading such positive reviews.First of all this place will be difficult to find who doesn't know the way around Rajarhat, Not a place for family customers who are planning to visit at night.Not an apt locality to travel at night.
We ordered Chef's speciality Grilled house chicken and Murg kagani along with Cheese garlic naan. Grilled chicken was not a full meat instead a breast and leg piece, However the taste and aroma was good. Murg kagani was too oily but taste was "ok".¬†
Ambiance was pretty good and the staffs were very kind.¬†
Overall this place for me is overpriced, and is just ''one of the bottle'' and nothing special which could tempt me to visit a restaurant in such a pathetic location.

The marination of the chicken in continental dishes was so good that I never tasted something of this sort before.. Must visit for all.. Located in 211 bus route.. Its around 3 kms from City Centre 2, which means around 60 INR ride in Uber..

Hearing about this fine dining restaurant for a while so decided to give it a go on the Independence Day afternoon. Located in a slightly off route, the restaurant was relatively empty. It's part of the royal majestic suite. The staffs welcomed us. They also have valet parking. The lobby is nicely done. The restaurant is also nicely decorated. The staffs are very cordial. 

Coming to the food, we ordered chicken Kasturi kebab, their signature dish. I found it nothing exceptional. We decided to order continental so ordered fish Mariana and chicken steak. Fish Mariana is basically a betki fillet poached with white sauce. It comes with two risks, mashed potato and spaghetti. The fish was very well cooked and tasted fresh. The spaghetti has more chilli flakes and made it very spicy for a continental dish. The chicken steak is not just normal breast piece. It is stuffed with onion pepper and comes with brown sauce. It comes with rusks vegetables and mashed potato. Found it a little too salty for our pallet. For dessert we ordered brownie with ice cream and caramel custard both lived up to expectations. The dishes were good but we're not flawless. Would love to try other dishes sometimes.

Ok so, I'm so much excited writing this review for the entire team of reflexion. You guys were fantastic and the food too!
On the occasion of belated birthday of my sister we visited there.
This restaurant actually belongs to the hotel, majestic suits . The location makes it a bit difficult to get there, but once you're there all your efforts shall truly bear fruits.
The ambiance was captivating.The restaurant was amazingly decorated in the shades of white and beige.
As soon as we were seated, we were given spicy crispy papad which was complimentary. Impressive at the first stroke.
Ok so, we ordered (starters)
Blacken chicken- it was a chef's special item and the taste was good and different. It had mushroom, colourful veggies.
Bharwan chicken tangri- as the name suggests, it had four legs of chicken, juicy, stuffed with kima. Wonderful again :)
Main course comprised of
CHICKEN BIRIYANI- a bit more flavoured, colourful and different from the regular biriyani people of calcutta are used to. Delicious.
SCHEZWAN RICE NOODLES- good again.
CHICKEN FRIED RICE- it tasted okayish.
So we were done and asked for the bill . In the mean time we were given to fill up a form to jot down our experience and our initials. We were waiting for the bill when we saw some of the staffs bringing something. It was an ice cream cake for my sister's belated birthday as they became aware of it from the form we fillep up previously. We're so happy to have received this surprise. The cake was made of vanilla ice cream on which her name was written with chocolate sauce. These guys made our day.ahh!
The staffs are very friendly and cordial . Besides food,their smiling faces and good manners make the place more charismatic.
Price was reasonable, at par with the quality and quantity of food.Overall, a happy experience . I would surely visit again :)

Reflexion recently been the most popular family restaurant in New Town or Rajarhat area. Location is odd hence private transportation recommended. They have valet parking. Ambiance and decor was tasteful. Have small family gathering rooms for big groups. ¬†
Coming to food we went for Reshmi Kebab, Kasturi Kebab and Golden fried Prawns. None of them are unioque dishes but their preparation and presentation made it stand out from the crowd. Also had Cantoni Fried Chicken just perfectly cooked chicken covered with cornflakes and batter to made it crispy.

In main course we had Kang Ka Ree, Fish Begum Bahar , Fish Kolhapuri ¬†with Steamed and Jeera Rice. Kang Ka Ree which thai chicken yellow curry just goes perfectly with steamed rice. In Indian Fish Begum Bahar was good but not mind blowing for our taste buds. We couldn't able to figure out difference in taste with Fish Kolhapuri. Looked like same dish with two different names. Both the dish were expensive but fish was fresh catch bhetki.

Servers were found bit clumsy. Were dropping things all over while serving. Too dilly dally in serving crockery and cutlery. Had to ask few times for water. Main course too much time to serve. Wont say this is not expensive but would say quality of cooking compensates higher price. Will come back again for mocktails and starters.

This eatery kept showing up in Zomato in collections and recommendations, and so after catching a movie at City Center, we decided to visit this place.

First of all, the place is tricky to find, as it is a part of a hotel, I think. So basically you have to walk inside the hotel to be led to the diner.

The place is neat and minimal. The lights were bright, a little too bright for my mates who prefer a little dimly lit eating atmosphere. We ordered quickly and the service was fairly prompt.

The food was well cooked. That's all I can say about it. We ordered Blacken Chicken for starter, and Singapore Rice and Fried Rice for main course with a side of Lamb in Hot Sauce. While the rice was moderately good, the lamb and the chicken starter both were quite delightful. For dessert we ordered Brownie with Ice Cream, which was again good but not special.

Summing it up, the food is above average here. The portions were a little less, considering the prices. For a quick lunch/dinner it's definitely a good place. Would recommend for a one time visit.

Had been planning to visit this place for a long time. Finally had the chance yesterday when I planned a family dinner at Reflections in Majestic Suites.
The location can be tricky- head straight from ecopark and take a you turn at cc2 and then left, it is near Purti Star residential apartments in Rajarhat road.
Majestic suites is a decent property in the vicinity. 
The restaurant looks amazing!

Reflextions is a planned restaurant with organized seating. The decor is done in shades of beige, browns in yellow lighting. 

Here's goes my food experience. 
APPETIZER:
‚Ä¢ Nawabi kumbh which was stuffed mushrooms. I liked the marination on the mushroom and it tasted good. However, no chutney was served with this dish!
‚Ä¢ San Francisco veg rolls , which had veggies, mozzarella cheese and parsley in a crispy roll cover.
#recommended

DRINKS
‚Ä¢ Virgin Mojito was well made
‚Ä¢ Mango spice mocktail (forgetting the name) was very good with mango juice, lime, green chillies and pepper in a Salk rimmed glass #recommended

MAINS
‚Ä¢ Veg lasagne was prepared well and tasted really good!
‚Ä¢ Dal Makhni did justice to its name. Simmered and cooked to perfection, I loved it! #recommended
‚Ä¢ nargis kofta was Paneer stuffed kofta in a white gravy. It was tasty and I really liked the balance and salt and sugar in the dish
‚Ä¢ veg jhal farezi was smoked in a tangy gravy and tasted very very good #recommended
‚Ä¢ jalape√±o and Paneer kulcha which I feel could be bettered
‚Ä¢ chilli cheese nan which was nice
‚Ä¢ garlicnan was good, 
‚Ä¢ Tandoori roti was made crispy and light

DESSERT
‚Ä¢ brownie with ice cream was ordered and it tasted amazing. The brownie was fresh and filled with walnuts. The crumb of the brownie was very good. It was smothered with ganache and topped with ice cream

Overall the service was pretty good and the staff was extremely warm. 

A great place for a lovely evening with your family and friends.
I wish the team the very best!

The location of this restaurant is really odd, not easily accessible during nights. Parking facility is also weird. But if you leave this aside and enter the restaurant, things start to get better, the ambience is good. Food served is also good, I really enjoyed the salt n pepper chicken here.the waiting time between starters n main course is huge.staff is polite and helpful. This place is worth a re visit but only if one can adjust with the location.

Reflexion really hard to locate , as this is located in Rajarhat , Newtown . Around the corner is one of the leasure known place for tasty  food in the city probably. The place has an amazing ambiance and nicely decorated .Their food is also mouth watering with a amezing hospitality.Enjoyed a great dinner with friends. You are made to feel welcome from the first moment and the staffs are attentive and courtious . The chinese dish Mushroom Cabana was one of the delicious item among all what we had . If you ned a break from the hatric schedule then please plan to visit Reflexion for a mind blowing experience. Keep it up ........

With outstanding hospitality, a spellbinding ambiance and an eclectic combination of exquisite world cuisine, Reflextion has become a front runner for 'the fairest of them all' spot in no time!!In you go and you are greeted with a warm welcome from the receptionist. We were truly pleased with the decor, lighting, the good music. The inside is a totally different story as opposed to the exterior. Large glass walls, colored bottles, chandelier ;the designer indeed has a great taste.

Not very easy to locate.....but if one follows the google map to The Majestic Suites then this beautiful restaurant can be reached. Located inside the hotel this restaurant has 3 private dining areas and i had the pleasure of using one. Its warm. And cosy.... the service boys were very friendly and cooperative.  We ordered virgin mojito, mushroom cabana, chiken lehsuni kebab. Delicious is the word. Main course was good too. I would like to mention that its a good value for money and i would b coming again. Also saw their banquet halls n rooms. It was nice. A good property in this location. Just a piece of advice to them.....to put the restaurant board outside the hotel as well.

Visited this place today with family. Going by the exteriors i Did not think i will have such a wonderful experience. Who says it's not a gem. It is truly a hidden gem. The place is truly majestic. Nice decor with jars and bottles.....soothing atmosphere. I ordered for mushroom cabana....veg SanFrancisco roll. Both the items were nice and different. Really yummy. 

The Palak shorba was tasty and so was the finger  lickering fish begum bahar. Caramel custard was suggested by staff and was average. The place is little far but I would love to come here again.

Away from all the huddles and puddles, pandemonium and condomonium of the busy city; we rush along the the lonely highway leaving behind the green lashes and suddenly came across another Hidden Gem of the town... Reflexion... in the womb of The Majestic Suites...

So we started with Mushroom Cabana... A recommended dish... To me it was average although the quality of the mushroom was exceptional from it's softness to the way it was optimally cooked...¬†

Next, another so-called famous one... Kasturi Kebab... Highly flavoured with kasuri methi and cashews yet I would say I have had better Kebabs elsewhere...¬†

And now came the Shot of the day... ¬†
Combo of Dragon Phoenix Soup and Blacken Chicken... The half poached egg over the hot soup to go with the chicken slices tossed with olive, coriander, red & yellow bell peppers was enough to blow out my friend's running nose
One word for these two : "IT'S FANTASTICO"

Last of the starters' list was Thai Chicken Smoke Style... It had an uncanny essence of smoke over the teriyakis with usual peanut sauce....¬†

After whole lot of playing pool all over the starters... Cheese and Chilli Kulcha and today's Runners-up Fish Begumbahar for the main course... The fish inevitably needs a special mention of it's ultra-softness and it's nerve-luring gravy...¬†

A special mention of the decor and the courteousness of the waiters...
Worth visiting this far off the city..

Landed to yet another overrated and average restaurant...the reviews and the rating and the growing popularity of this place made me travel a very long way which took abt 2 hrs journey by uber and a taxi bill of 350 bugs...so i hoped my visit would be worth the heckle bt it absolutely was not...
the ambience was good though but i found the place a bit small to b called a grand restaurant...we took dragon n phoenix soup and their signature dish kasturi kebab for starters...the soup was good bt the kebab was one of the worst that i have tasted in my lif...improperly cooked and very hard and unpleasant...for main course we had peas polao,fish begum bahar,murg kagani,chilli cheese kulcha...all the items were extremely average except the fish begum bahar which was the best dish out of the lot there and was actually delicious...aftr our dissapointment with the food we did not risk taking desserts...hope to have a better experience the next time

I was here today and had faced horrible experience. My table was even booked for 8'o' clock and we were there before tym,we were allotted table hand to hand but the service what was offered was horrible just can't imagine. We were total 6 persons and had coupon from little but they didn't serve us our order in time we were sitting idol after some partial supply from the management till 9:45 and after we complained about the service they didn't bothered and sharp 9:45 we walked off the hotel saying thank you the manager for not serving the food as we were here for having it for free. He didn't knew that we have Infact paid the whole amount in advance. After saying the manager these words he didn't bother to stop us also. This was the service and respect given to the customers. 3 manchaow soup and one hot and sour soup was order but he gave ONLY one manchaow and and hot and sour after 15 mins when we complained he said we gave 2 soups in one bowl only. What do the hotel staff think the customers are fool or what. Horrible I will suggest all the person's not to visit the place anymore. When they can't treat a customer for 1 hour 45 mins then what's the use of going there.

Visited with close friends group on a Sunday dinner time. The place was not easy to locate if you are not staying in that area. Well decorated place both exterior and interior design. 
We ordered Dragon Phoenix soup, kasturi kabab, and one more chicken based continental starter. It took them more than 45 mins to bring these 3 items. We were almost on the verge of loosing patience with such slow service. Few of the other table guests didn't have that much of patience and left the restaurant. 
We went for veg pulao, naan, Chicken Lajawaab, mutton rogu·πÖ juice and Caesar salad in the main course cum salad time. These were served pretty fast compared to the time taken for making starter available at tour table end. 
Taste wise almost all the items are flawless. Even the soup was really adding extra miles to my food journey. 
Food 5/5
Ambience 4/5
Service 1/5 for slow service. Otherwise staff is courteous and tried doing to best of their abilities.

Restaurant with good decor, courteous staff, though located in a secluded place. Went after reading reviews and looked like an exciting place. Starters were fine but main course is a big let down. First dahe ki kabab was not dahi k kabab. They should name it something else, bcoz it set the wrong expectations with ppl who had dahi k kebab. The main course gravy was very bad. We ordered nargisi kofte and panner khurchan. Kofte was dry.. Where as panner tasted like rubber. Moreover, there was hardly any panner in it. I am not sure this is particular to Kolkata or may be the dish served was not good. May be they should look to drop such dishes from menu, rather than getting flaked for it. Looking to visit again, but will never order vegetarian food.

In true words.. a hidden gem.. I don't know where to start.. yes found it in zomato.. the first things which drawn my attention.. a restaurant.. located in an odd place how could get such an amazing rating :D

As I mentioned odd place.. so let's start with the place.. and more clearly how to reach there. It's better to get a taxi/ ola/ uber ( and if u hv ur own car dats owssum:P) , the place is majestic suites. From chinar park/cc2/ anaksha turn left if u going toward new town. Then after 4 mins u will be on rajarhat road. Then turn right. It's a big building having banquet and restaurant. Just look for majestic suites. Reflection is the ground floor restaurant in that building.

Now coming to most important section : food

Mocktail
_______________________
1. Appeal mojhito: yes, very good in taste
2. Spicy mango delight : excellent one. Owsum. The spicy thing in this drink is just owssum.

Starters
__________________

1. Kasturi kebab: chicken kebab. Very good in taste. 
2. Sanfransisco veg roll: this is just terrific in taste. 
3. Thai smoke chicken: what can I say about this. Excellent. Chicken taste owsum, the veg with that tosses with lemon leaf and the sauce. Heavenly.

Soups
______________________

1. Palak shorba :very good.

2. Mutton nihari shorba : this is just superb. Please try this. Otherwise u cannot understand how good is this.

Main course
_______________________
1. Mixed fried rice: okay type. Nothing good or bad.
2. Mutton hydrabadi biriyani: the best mutton biriyani I have ever had.
3. Fish begum bahar : bhetki fish preparation. Owssum one.
4. Malabari jhinga curry : prawn preparation. Just owssum.
5. Lamb in hot garlic : shredded lamb. Owsum preparation. Must try.
6. murg kagani : tandoor chicken in red gravy.. not excellent but yes good in taste.
7. Veg white pasta: good one.

Dessert
________________

You will not find desert option in menu. Ask them which is available.
We were little disappointed not having the fried ice crm on that day.

1. Caramel custard: excellent.
2. Hot brownie with ice cream: excellent again


And yes the decoration of the restaurant is very eye-catching. It's more attractive in evening I guess. We had a visit in day time - in lunch. Next time will surely go for a dinner.

Little expensive though. Cost 5600 INR for 6 people.

Yes.. at the end I reailze, why they having a that good rating , inspite of having a odd location. :)

To the management: a humble request.

____________________________

This is just the beginning. So please keep this quality and hospitality.  You are the long run horse. So please keep it up. Cheers :)

This place is downright a treat to the eyes. Majestic suites, Reflexion, very aptly named.
Located a bit far away ( read 8 kms) from Sector V, you would definitely not expect a place like this in that locality. Ample space for parking. The outer appearance is okayish, but it's what inside that really mattered.
In you go and you are greeted with a warm welcome from the receptionist. We were truly pleased with the decor, lighting, the good music. The inside is a totally different story as opposed to the exterior. Large glass walls, colored bottles, chandelier ;the designer indeed has a great taste.
Now to the food.
We took :
~ Kasturi kebabs (chicken) - soft tender chicken. Good to taste but nothing extraordinary
~ Bhetki Capital Paris - bhetki fish made to perfection , served with Spicy spaghetti and mashed potatoes. The dish overall was good. I felt a little more seasoning to the fish would be great.
~ Mushroom Cabana- spinach stuffed mushroom with cheese, tossed in schezwan sauce. This had a good amount of flavors and spices. Loved it.
~ Caramel Custard pudding - a big bowl of one of my favorite desserts. Soft pudding, lovely caramel crusting. A Must have !
Overall it's a great place to woo your significant other !

The location is a little out of main area, personal vehicle is a must to visit this place. Perhaps, that is why the place doesn't draw much crowd. However, the ambience is excellent. ¬†This ia good place for ¬†persons who dont want much crowded place as the place itself is very peaceful. Food Quality and presentation is one of the best. ¬†Good Service is an additional advantage. ¬†Every item we ordered was really amazing . Good place to have Romanric dinners. Very few place in kolkata have good food with great ambience.

You can never go wrong with this place, except maybe the fact that it is located too far away! The decor is very tasteful and with a great ambience complete with Kenny G playing in the background and the staff waiting on you hand and foot, makes the experience no short of luxury dining but at such reasonable prices!! And the food is to die for!! We ordered dragon phoenix soup and blacken chicken as starters. The soup was a mouth-watering concotion of chicken, prawn, mushroom and vegetables topped with beaten egg white. The blacken chicken also, turned out to be quite good. Also we had virgin mojito and blue sky for drinks- both well mixed and quite refreshing!! However, what really impressed us was the main course- Fish Marinara and grilled house chicken. While the fish marinara was deliciously prepared with cheese and cream sauce smeared fish with mashed potato and noodles, the chicken was perfectly grilled and soaked up with a heavenly sauce that opened up new levels of pleasure in our tastebuds. And the service...oh so efficient..and the waiters so well-behaved!! This place could have a frequent hangout had it not been so far from my home, but would love to drop by again!

I never thought such a great restaurant to be in that location. Location a little bit off city but when I visited, it's none other than WoW!!!! You can get a delightful positive crowed-less ambiance. This is must a location advantage. As you enter the place you are welcomed by a magnificent setting, a delightful interior decoration and the luxuries of modernity. ¬†Sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of ¬†interior art work and equal importance from host. You might not find dragon meat on the menu, but you‚Äôll find pretty much anything else that walks, swims or flies, cooked up in more ways than there are people around you ;). The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters, main course and desert. All the products were fresh and the dishes had the warmth of home-made food. The chefs takes great care in selecting the best quality ingredients. What a pity that the service does not accompany the high quality of the cooking. Thankfully the Manager and host is always around willing to exchange some kind smile and words with all his clients.
 I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours. Looking forward to visit this soon again.

If you own a car or a bike, and longs for rides and good food, then i will recommend this place. Located a bit offset area of Rajarhat (Bathtala) a lil hard to locate. A cruz in the long stretchy roads of rajarhat-newtown when your hungry stomach need some apetite, grab the opportunity to visit this place. Located in The Majestic Suites, Star Residency Building.
Ambience is one of the key attraction of this place. The interiors, the furnishings, the wall decors, hangings, crockeries are top notch.
Staffs are of well eticate and and friendly.
Coming the main part the food, as it was my first visit there i opted for the North Indian Cuisine and ordered the following things-
1. Kasturi Kebabs: Dice of chicken well marinated with cashew paste, cheese, and whole lot of spices. Really mouth watering.
2. Masala Kulcha: It was very ordinary in taste as in all other restaurants.
3. Chicken Biriyani: Though the aroma of the dish was quite amazing, bit it misses the most important part which a bengali desires in his/her biriyani. Yaa guessed it right, it misses the 'aloo'. Nevertheless they serve 2pieces chicken with it.
4. Murgh Handi Lazeez: This was a stand out dish among all. Diced chicken cooked in thick red curry tastes awesome. A lil bit on the spicier side.
5. Mocktails-
(a) Spicy Mango: The presentation was really eye catching, but it will be a hot favourite for the spice lovers. As the name suggest, mark my words it's really, really spicy.
(b) Midnight Beauty: A sweet drink topped with scoops of ice cream and a Cherry. Looks fantastic and tastes  is heavenly.
Value for money I would give it a 3 out of 5 as I think so. Overall a good experience, locationwise a bit far from my place still one or two visit is considerable.
P.S. They serve a complementary papad and raita with the biriyani.

I wish there was an option of negative rating. Happen to see the listing here and the great reviews and ratings. So I called for a home delivery, they told me that they haven't started with home delivery yet. I offered to pick up the order of they can keep my order ready. I was told that they don't take orders over the phone. Ultimately I asked for directions and went to pick up the food. Upon reaching the place, I was told that the parking is at the rear of the building and the valet offered help to park my car. But since I drive a big and an expensive automatic, I don't prefer the valet's parking my car. Reaching the parking, it was a tight parking for my SUV, but somehow managed it. Had to walk back to the resturant through some kaccha mucky road cuz of the rains.
My order was two portions of hydrabadi chicken biryani. I enquired if they serve any salaan with the biryani, and was told only raita will be served. That should have been my first hint, but I ignored it. Waited patiently for the order for about 20mins or so.
Finally it was dinner time( biryani time). To my utter disappointment. It looked nothing like a biryani. The chicken was as if it was boiled and then fried. Absolutely tasteless. The rice was something what my mom makes with left over rice.... Fried with some spices and turmeric. Where on earth you see curry leaves and dry chillies in the hydrabadi biryani? Mayb some curry leaves in the Kerala biryani. The rice quality was very ordinary. I was shocked to be served a biryani of this standard in a city which loves it's biryanis. I have tried biryanis all over the country and also in other countries. But this one changes the definition of a biryani. Complete disappointment. Try at your own risk.

Firstly, I shall like to thank Zomato for featuring this restaurant .

This a place where I liked every aspect of it.

1. Food:

This place serves Continental, Oriental, Indian. We wanted to explore oriental and Indian (not a big fan of continental).  We ordered Dragon Phoenix Soup, Drums of Heaven, Chicken Biryani , Kaali Mirch Kebabs. Dragon Phoenix Soup was pretty good with a spicy touch over the Lung-Fung soup. Drums of Heaven was served crispy and tangy. It had stir fried veggies with it which made it more tasteful. Then for the chicken biryani, quantity wise it was adequate for us two, after 2 starters. Taste wise it was quite satisfying to the taste buds. It was light on spices and oil which made it pretty much preferable for us. Lastly the kebabs were juicy and had spicy taste of 'Kaali Mirch' added to it.

2. Ambience:

Though the Hotel Majestic Suites is situated a bit inside of Rajarhat area, but one cannot deny the fact it is one those places with fine and elegant decors. The restaurant has a spacious and clean dining area. The main attraction should be the private dining space which is perfect for both romantic dates as well as family events. We were celebrating our birthday, so we had opted for the private dining space. They had decorated the place perfectly with candle-light arrangement. We were also served with complimentary Mojitos (quite refreshing ).

3. Service:

Service is what that defines hospitality of a restaurant. And we should definitely say that we were provided with the best one over here. The staffs were expert enough to serve the food at the correct intervals, change plates between meals and always to keep a check if we need anything. The manager even came by to ask if everything was fine.

Overall, this excellent experience at Reflexion encourages me to recommend this place to all.

A special mention for the friendly staff they are very helpful and prompt in terms of service and behaviour. ¬†Though the place is a little offbeat but the quality of the service will surely pronounce your name to all the foodies.
I have a small request if possible please include the desserts in your menu.

The location is a little off beat and the approach a little shady,  specifically if you plan to visit in the evening.  Perhaps, that is why the place doesn't draw much crowd during these hours. However,  the ambience and service is quite nice and the food is quite good too. Very few places make a good crispy chili baby corn and Reflexions has it spot on! We tried the Indian fare and I must say every item we ordered was equally delectable! A special mention should be the chili cheese kulcha that I couldn't get the most of.

Service - 4.5/5 
This place was a great visit. We ordered Dahi Kebabs, Manchow soup, Mushroom cabana, dumplings, veg pulao, dal makhani, mojitos and brownie for dessert. The soup was lovely and so were the Kebabs. The mushroom cabana is so well cooked but slightly spicy. We love spicy food so it wasn't a problem for us! Dumplings and the cabana were cooked in the same sauce though. The dal makhani was cooked well though it was slightly sweet. The mojitos were nothing great and they should have a separate dessert and beverage menu. Also, continental food wasn't available and that was a slight disappointment. 
Coming to the ambience, it is nice. It's a fine dining place. We were 4 and we chose to sit in the private room which made our experience even better. 
The staff is courteous and polite. Service is top-notch. 
I really wasn't expecting this place to be so good but it went beyond our expectations. Our bill totalled to just ‚Çπ1620! Complete value for money! Loved it.

This restaurant is just amazing! The moment you enter this restaurant, it will set up your mind for a good experience. With the ambient light and neat but beautiful decorations, it sets up expectations for beautiful experience. Then comes the food and that is when you start wondering, why did you not came here before!!! The taste not only amazes your taste buds, but fills up your heart with the joy of having excellent food after a long time. From the soups and starters to the dessert, it was a journey to remember!
Let us go to the details,
Soups: Veg Tom Sum soup and Chicken lemon coriander soup - both were good in taste and texture. The Tom Sum soup has coconut milk, finely chopped vegetables and the beautiful aroma of lemon leaves. The lemon coriander soup was also good in taste, simple but tasty.
Starters - Thai smoked chicken and Pepper Chilli fish - the fish was excellent in taste, well cooked and had nice aroma. Served with saut√©ed vegetables, it was a complete enjoyment. The chicken dish was served with a custom sauce which was very different in taste. 
Main course - mixed Hakka noodles and mixed pan fried noodles - mixed Hakka noodles was properly cooked, noodles was very thin, not much oil, the way a proper Chinese noodles should be. The pan fried noodles was a bit fried, with gravy, kind of chop suey, I felt. Rich with shrimps egg poach and chicken, it had very nice taste and flavour as well.
Side dish - Hunan chicken and lamb in hot garlic - the Hunan chicken was awesome! Very little oil and spices, but very rich in flavour. The chicken was soft and well cooked. It complements the Hakka noodles. The lamb was tasty, again not much oil and spices but great in taste.
Dessert - caramel custard - this completes the experience! A bit more sweet, but not over sweet. Rich and creemy, it just melted in mouth. Awesome!!
Will be back, definitely, for the Indian and continental dishes! Hope they will do the same magic as well!

last evening we spent an wonderful time in Reflexion on the eve of my wife's birthday. Best Part is their Candle light dinner. They will arrange a separate room with cozy sofa, granite Table with candles, Red Roses and chilled AC. It will give you the feelings of a perfect Romantic Dinner with your beloved one.¬†

Food is awesome and Price is Reasonable. Staffs are very much attentive and if you just look at them, they will come to you and ask if you need something.¬†

we ordered Spinach Soups and Mushroom Kabana in Starters . Both are well made and taste was good. In main meal , we ordered Kasturi Kabab and in the desert , we ate Burned Ice-cream.¬†

They gave us 1 blue lagoon cocktails as a complimentary drinks and little surprised, they didn't charge for those special arrangement. otherwise, they charge 500 RS for this special arrangement. Perhaps , as they are new in the town , trying to lure customers by giving some special discounts and freebies.¬†

If you are staying in Rajarhat or nearby City Center 2 , this is a must visit place for the romantic couples. also if you want to have a small family gatherings of 6-7 people, you can choose this place too. they are very new , so trying their everything for the customers.¬†

We will surely visit this place very soon.¬†

New resturant with good food and along with Good ambience , although my friend threw her birthday bash along with pool party @ The Majestic  . Food was quite tasty but according to me the desert (fried icecream ) stole my heart .  People of kolkata should try once atleast the desert .

Ambience
This place is listed to be a romantic restaurant, but basically it is not the ideal place for a date! But nevertheless, the furniture is good, and the decor is satisfactory.

Service
The food took too long to arrive and the staff was a bit unacquainted with the additional menu which did not feature in the menu card. But the people were friendly and extremely courteous.

Appetizers
We ordered for an oriental dish, Lat me kai (chef special).
It was as perfect as we had expected it to be! The tender chicken pieces were delicately cooked in a strongly flavoured sauce. This dish would easily bag a 4.5/5 !

Mocktails
Firstly we ordered for Virgin Mojito and then Blue lagoon. The mocktails were refreshing and were exactly like they are supposed to be. Sadly, Reflexion's mocktail menu is not at all developed, and mocktail lovers would find themselves at a loss out here.

Main course
After much debate, we ordered for Fish marinara (chef special). Oh my, it was a terrific beauty! Served with spaghetti and mashed potato, this dish is a must try. The fish is cooked in white sauce with button mushrooms and the flesh melts in your mouth.We would definitely give a 5 /5 for this splendid dish!

Delightful experience. Its a long way to go for a drive but the end result was remarkably amazing.
I sincerely thank Mr. Subasish and Mr. Suja for handling our lovely dining evening. Ours was a candlelight dinner made very special, when the staff arranged a private dining space exclusively for us. The whole place was put up like a hotel room, it cannot get any more ROMANTIC than this. It was quiet and humble. The staff was very courteous. 
Now for the food. The portions are of ample sizes. Although we didnt had enough space for main course after the starters, we still managed to gulp in a complimentary caramel custard. 
We tried the corn dumplings in chilli basil sauce, which was spicy, yet delicious. Next up was dahi kebabs, it melted straightaway through the knife as well as in our mouths. Last was stuffed aloo, a little dry, yet tasty. For the drinks, we had spicy mango delight and apple mojito. They were served in a mason jar and i liked the presentation. The mango one was Maaza with green chillies and all. So nothing much delightful about it, but thumbs up for apple mojito. 
It was a rich experience and an evening thoroughly enjoyed.

When I read Reflexion, the first thing that comes to my mind are mirrors!!

'Mirror Mirror on the Wall, who is the Fairest of them all? ' - A famous quote from Snow White

With outstanding hospitality, a spellbinding ambiance and an eclectic combination of exquisite world cuisine, Reflextion has become a front runner for 'the fairest of them all' spot in no time!!

Do you remember that feeling, when you walk into a place and your JAWS JUST DROP? For a few seconds you are SPEECHLESS?¬† It MESMERIZES you in a way that you are just transported to another world; a world of perfection!! It CAPTIVATES you in a way that everything else seizes to exist!! An AWE-INSPIRING moment!! Well my first few seconds inside Majestic Suits was just that, it was a mesmerizing, captivating and awe-inspiring!!

I attended a Food Bloggers Meet at REFLEXION, The Majestic Suit on a Saturday evening. An entire evening was planned for us; it included a lavish spread, a tour of the entire property and a heartwarming, interactive session with the owners Punit Lundia and Akshita Chamaria Lundia. To begin with, Majestic Suits is located at Raigachi, Rajarhat right beside Green Heights Complex.¬† As I walked in I was enamored of the Majestic Suits property. Majestic Suits advocates that they are a unique business lifestyle hotel that caters comprehensive needs of families and business travelers; with Valet Parking, 24Hour Surveillance, Gym, Pool, Community Halls, Fax & Photo Copy Service, Lavish Rooms & Banquets with world class amenities they have lived up to their word. A Special mention of their Banquet Halls, these have gained popularity in no time for marriage receptions and office conferences. Away from the cacophony of the city, but just 7 Km from the airport, it is distinguished by its innovative and modern lifestyle trends. sfhkkllll-small

The entrance has a warm, golden glow with elaborate carved walls and ceiling art and fancy lamps; it exuberated lavishes. Reflextion Restaurant is at the left of the entrance, on the ground floor. Aptly suiting its name, the beautiful and intricate glass work gave the place a reflective dimension. The area is lavishly done with modernized furniture which is both comfortable and chic & private rooms elaborate sofas and marbled tables. The artistic wood work, the sophisticated golden lights, and the perfect color balance between white-golden-brown engulfed me in a sense of luxury and panache.

Undoubtedly the d√©cor was mesmerizing. But the ‚ÄòMAJESTIC‚Äô appeal of Majestic Suits doesn‚Äôt end only at d√©cor. They promise to make your holistic experience a ‚ÄòMAJESTIC‚Äô one!! And they completely lived up to it!¬† Mr. Kaushik Karmakar, the operations manager showed us around the property ‚Äì rooms, banquets, terrace area, pool, etc and peeked our interest with hotel fact. He was an informative man. Mr. Subhasish Das is the F&B Manager, and the mentor for the entire team of Stewards. While I have come across a few efficient managers not many do it as effortlessly as Mr.Das. He is friendly, attentive, warm, quick with decisions, engaging and well the list continues. But it is this man who took my experience from good to plain WOW!! He and his team of stewards were plain perfect. Even five starts do not have this kind of efficiency when it comes to service. Punit and Akshita are the quintessential hosts, their warmth is contagious. We engaged in a heartwarming, interactive session. Humility, geniality, humorous are a few adjectives that is apt for this fantastic duo. Their entire team of Majestic Suits was so affable, affectionate and gracious that they have now become my yardstick when it comes to hospitality.

Now it‚Äôs time to talk about the food. The special menu that was curated for us was gigantic. This gave me an opportunity to understand the culinary diversity that Reflexion is capable of offering, and also¬† satiate the hungry soul within myself.

MOCKTAILS:

#Apple Mojito:¬† An old school mojito with an apple twist. Everything about this drink was refreshing, yet there was a subtlety about it. A truly brilliant start! This is a¬† must try.

#Jamaican Night Out: The right combination of milk, chocolate, coffee gave the drink a rich flavor. Add to that a cinnamon twist and what you get is pure bliss. The Kit-Kat garnish satiated the child in me that craves for chocolate.

#Spicy Mango Delight: I like uncommon mocktails, and this was one such drink. A spiced combination of un-ripped mango and green chilies gave the drink a sourly-spicy-hot. That fact that this was a non-sweet drink made it stand out. It became my favorite in no time. A must try.

#Pineapple Mojito: With a strong flavor to offer, this drink was different from the other mojito that we tried before. The presentation was pretty.¬† A yummilicious drink and one of my favorites of the evening.

#Watermelon Juice: A low sugar, pure watermelon juice. The perfect fit for all health fanatics. It‚Äôs also a brilliant pallet cleanser and can be introduced between two different kinds of cuisine.

STARTERS:

#Stuffed Aloo: A grand beginning - potatos stuffed with minced paneer, veggies and cooked in clay oven. The presentation, the taste, the aroma truly exquisite.

#Nawabi Kumbh: Mushroom cooked with in-house spices in a tandoor. The nawabi flare to this dish was just perfect - Mushroom being my favorite, this dish was definitely one of the high-points of the evening!

#Kasturi Kebab: Keeping up with the nawabi flare kasturi kabab came next - chicken marinated with kasturi methi, cashew paste, cheese, and other indian spices and cooked on a tandoor. It was big sized kabab; it was soft, well marinated and simply melted in my mouth. A must try.

#Crispy Chili Babycorn : Crispy, Fresh, Yummy a few adjectives for the classic dish! A must try.

#Mutton Pasinda Kabab: Boneless mutton marinated in chopped coriander and chef special spices.A truly delicious delicacy.

#Golden Fried Prawn: Fresh prawn fried with a thick coating of batter and served with sweet chili sauce. A perfect transition from our nawabi-ana starters. The prawns were fresh & well-cooked. Presentation plain Wow! A must try.

#Sanfrancisco Veg Roll: The veg rolls were a prefect blend of minced corn, spinach and cheese; it was deep fried with a coating of chili flakes and came with a helping of mushroom sauce . While the coating was slightly on the thicker end, the taste and presentation were top notch.

#Cantonese Fried Chicken:Sliced chicken with a thin bread-crumb coating and came with a helping of hot garlic sauce. It's crunchy, yet juicy appeal was captivating; definitely one of my favorites of the evening. A must try.

#Thai Chicken Smoked Style: Chicken marinated in Thai spices and smoked. With a hint of lemon grass this dish was another ideal starter; the peanut butter sauce that came with it just added on to the flavor.

#Fish Finger: 6 big sized fish fingers came with a serving of tartar sauce. Another classic which deserves accolade.

SOUP:

#Palak Shorba: A thick, creamy shorba that won my heart with its grand taste. A must try.

#Veg TomSom Soup: Coconut based Thai Soup. With a strong falvour of lemongrass with a multitude of veggies, this dish was topnotch. This was my favorite soup on the evening, and it is another must try.

#Mutton Nihari Shorba: Mutton bone marrow slow cooked - a true nawabi delicacy. Its was delicious to its core.

MAIN COURSE:

#Dal Makhani: They have done justice to the typical punjabi dal. It was creamy, aromatic indulgence. A must try.

#Nargis Kofta: Kofta(minced paneer & veggies) cooked in a sweetish, mild white gravy. I was engulfed by its richness in taste. Another must try.

#Methi Matar Malai: A perfect vegetarian dish with peas cooked in methi and cream.It was an yummilicious preparation.

#Murgh Lajawaab: A sweetish chicken preparation in secret spices of the chef. the chicken was succulent and tasted ,marvelous. A must try.

#Chicken Steak: Chicken breasts stuffed with capsicum, onion, bell pepper , grilled and served with veloute sauce. A delicious preparation and beautiful presentation.

#Fish Begum Bahar: A delicious bhetki preparation in rice saffron gravy.

#Kang Karee: A stupendous preparation of chicken in thai yellow curry. The subtle flavor of lemon grass this dish was a hit!

#Kameng Khai Wan: Basil flavored thai green curry with zuccini, bell pepper, mushrooms. A worthy choice if you are a vegetarian.

#Mandarin Fish: A nice preparation of fish with citrus-y Mandarin sauce.

#Malabari Jhinga Curry: A yellow creamy coconut milk gravy with mid-sized fresh prawns . This was the show stopper of the evening! It was delectable beyond words. A must, must try!

#Roasted Chicken: A WHOLE chicken marinated in chef special recipe diced vegetables and mashed potato. I was just aghast by the size of this dish., it was plain HUGEEEE- well so I had to take a picture with it :P I lovely preparation, palatable to its core. A must try.

#Mutton Hyderabadi Biryani: OOOHHHH GOD!! This is one of the best Biryani's I have had in the city!! The mutton was well-cooked, the rice had the right amount of fragrance(not to much, like most places) and spices. This was the second show stopper of the evening. A must, must try.

#Tandoori Bread Basket: An assortment of masala kulcha, laccha paratha, butter naan. YThe breads were well made.

#Hunam Vegetable with Veg Fried Rice: Veggies like mushroom, carrot, onion, broccoli, beans, baby-corn cooked in soya garlic sauce, spiced with dry chilies and topped with wine. A delectable creation.

DESSERTS:

#Fried Ice Cream: Vanilla Ice cream with a thick coating on dough with a coconut twist. It tasted nice.

#Caramel Custard: It looked enticing from even afar. I block of custard topped with caramel. A pure indulgence.

#Darshan with Butterscotch Ice-cream: Crispy fried noodles wih honey and butter-scotch ice cream. Another classic dessert.

While leaving we were bid goodbye with caramelized Pan and Toffees. They made sure that every moment at Majestic Suits is plain "MAJESTIC"!! I sincerely thank Punit and Akshita for this stupendous experience! I wish the team of Majestic Suits all the very best for the future! May they reach pinnacles of success!

Reflextion is the multi cuisine restaurant of the next big upcoming property of the Ludias called the Majestic Suites. This place is remarkable in terms of their luxury stay, Banquets and restaurants. Everything about this place is something different than so many places in the city that makes it a must visit one.

I was here for a food tasting event in their restaurant called the Reflextion.

-> Top notch customer service
-> All the necessary amenities available

**Location**

Majestic Suites(Reflextion) is located at the upcoming area of the city at Rajarhat Newtown.It will be at your right side once you cross Derozio Collge.(3 mins drive)The best way is the right side from the Akansha more if your are coming from city centre 2.

Well I was here for a food tasting event and believe me guys the list of that day can itself be a menu for any restaurant.
Humongous list of food and drinks followed by some desserts.

Mocktails:

Spicy Mango Delight: I love spicy mocktails and this one was one of my favourite.

Excellent one. The twist of spice with mango was the best part about it.

#MushroomLoversDelight

**Service**
"Now that's what I call customer service"-- Everything from the table service to hospitality and reception was outstanding.
All the staffs serving was very very well trained with the food details as well as customer service.
The manager Mr. Subhashis is one the best in this case I have met so far. Loved his behaviour sense of humour as well as carrying forwards his sense of responsibility.
My special thanks To Mr.

Rajarhat!! A place that is perceived to be the new dimension of the modern day cityscape of Kolkata, resulting in the quintessential development of several gigantic corporate hubs, and blue chip condominiums all around. Perhaps this has ignited a paradigm shift in the hospitality industry to come up with ideas to be a part of the renaissance and extend their offering at this place. And one such name that deserve special mention is "THE MAJESTIC SUITES", which houses a majestic restaurant any foodie will crave for- REFLEXION is the name.

The moment you step inside, you'll receive a plush vibe and a warm welcome, along with the mesmerizing ambience soothing your soul. The interiors are class apart with an utter reflection of a sophisticated presentation.

Regarding the service, firstly I should express my gratitude and respect to the directors of the place

I stay nearby to this hotel, so one fine day on a weekend me and my wife visited this newly opened restaurant. The ambiance and staff behavior was heartwarming. Coming to the food, let me state this that I have had an amazing experience of biryani at arsalan and aminia...but this restaurant made me forget bout them. The north Indian dishes here are just out of the world. Loved the experience. You just found a permanent customer!!

After a very long time it was a perfect 5.0 wala experience... these place was again proving that... location dosent matter when you dosent compromise with your quality and quantity of food... and if it came with an excellent ambience and outstanding service... what more is needed...

I'm sure when you will take your drive to reach here... you will feel it's impossible to get anything impressive from here... but you will came out with some very good memories and smiling faces... And if you will meet Mr.Subasish the F&B manager you get flowed with his hospitality... We went there with a large group of 11 foodies and he handled the situation like nothing... also it's need to mention that there are other customers too... 

The decorations itself justfy the name Reflextion... yes it's wonderfully designed with glasses and veniers and bright light works making it very classy... Ambiance was mesmerizing... Try to have there PD space it has a charm of its own...

Now coming straight to the food and beverages...

REFLEXION: AN EXTRAVAGANT FOOD AFFAIR
========================================

Reflexion,a multi cuisine restaurant of The Majestic Suites established in Rajarhat reflected luxury and class from its inception. The place awed and astonish me with everything that evening. From its food to its decor, from service to hospitality everything seemed to be flawless .I was invited for a foodie meet by Mr.Punit Lundia, the owner of Lundia Group and The Majestic Suites. A very humble and fun loving person. A person with whom anyone would love to talk with.
Though its not near to my house, I reached in time. The first impression when I entered the place was phenomenal. I am an admirer of great decor and this place fits perfectly in it. The interior is impressive and extravagant. The golden lights gives a rich feel and matches well with the setup. When I further entered the restaurant I was galvanised with the furniture and wooden works of the interior. The private lounges had a posh look and added points to its name. As I entered, the staffs greeted with a smile. They looked after each and every minute things possible and that gives you an idea of their service. The hospitality team headed by their manager Mr. Subhasis Das was outstanding that evening. Mr. Das was attentive and did his job incredibly well. His managerial skills need a special mention. Kudos to him and his team.
After we settled down, the menu for the evening was before us. The menu was specially made for the foodie meet and was never ending ,with a wide range of variety in it. The excitement increased rapidly as I saw the items on the menu. And then the wait was over when it all started.
So it all started with Mocktails,
Apple Mojito was the first drink which came on the table. The drink was refreshing but it diverted a bit from its basic. The mint was over powering the apple flavour in this drink. I liked its presentation though.
Pineapple Mojito was outstanding with its presentation but lacked with the same issue as previous. The pineapple flavour was missing somewhere in the drink.
Jamaican Nite Out as the next drink oozing my taste bud as chocolate is one of my favourites. The chocolate delicacy was as good as it looked. The sweetness in the drink was just inch perfect with coffee and cinnamon punch giving an edge to the drink.
Spicy Mango Delight was the best drink of the evening making me ordering one more. It was just too good with its taste. It was spicy, tangy and wonderful. The presentation engraved an impression too.

The endless Starters came next.

It all started with some veg starters. The Stuffed Aloo, Nawabi Kumbh and Sanfrancisco Veg Roll came on the table.
Stuffed Aloo was decent. A hard crust with a soft upper layer. Less spicy and a nice dish to start with.
The Nawabi Kumbh had its own distinctive taste. Stuffed mushroom cooked with home made spices. The spicy and rich tasted nice with the green chatni which was served along with it.
Sanfrancisco Roll was the best veg starter of the evening. Cheese mixed with corn, spinach coated with chilli flakes and fried served with spicy sauce.
The Non Veg starters started with Kasturi Kebab and was served with the well known Green Chutney. The marination of chicken and mixing of spices was done well but it tasted ordinary, just like any other place.
Next came the Mutton Pasinda Kebab which did justice to its creation. It was soft, well spiced and tasted really good. The kebab was once again served with the Green Chutney.
The Golden Fried Prawn came next which was one of the highlights of the evening. It was delicious. Perfectly fried, well spiced and served with sweet chilli sauce. The presentation was top notch too.
The famous snacks of Kolkata and Bengalis came next. The Fish Finger came next and it was a hit. The upper layer was crispy and well fried. It was served with Tarter Sauce.
Cantoni Fried Chicken was the third consecutive hit in the starter section. Though it was lil oily but the taste was worth remembering.
Thai Chicken Smoke Style was spicy. It lacked the juiciness inside but it was negligible and tasted good with peanut sauce.

The long list of Starters ended but it was just the beginning.

So as it was planned, we went for a tour of the Big Hotel. Was quite impressed with the interior and the rooms. They have a classy banquet hall which they give for different purposes. The rooms are comfortable and worth its price.
After the tour was completed we came back to resume the food-a-thon we paused in the middle.

The Soup started next.
Three different Soups came back to back. Palak Shorba, Mutton Nihari Shorba & Veg Tom Som Soup. The Palak Shorba and Mutton Nihari Shorba was decent. The Mutton Nihari Soup had a good aroma and the flavour was coming well. But the best of the lot was the Veg Tom Som Soup.

The long awaited Main Course came next.
The veg section had these dishes in the list:
Dal Makhani
Nargis Kofta
Methi Matar Malai
Hunan Vegetable with Veg Fried Rice
&
Kameng Khia Wan

The Dal Makhani was rich and well cooked and was decent to have with Tandoori Roti
The Nargis Kofta was on the sweeter side, creamy and soft making it delicious when it entered the mouth.
Methi Matar Malai was not one of my favourite as I am not a fan of Green Peas.
The Rice was light, with lots of veggies and less oily making it a hit.
The Thai Green Curry was really good with an aroma which stole the heart. It didn't looked that good but tasted just the opposite.

Now coming to my personal favourite. The Non Veg Main Course had some great variety.
Murg Lajawaab
Fish Begum Bahar
Kang Ka Ree
Malabari Jhinga Curry
Mandarin Fish
Chicken Steak
Roasted Chicken
Mutton Hydrabadi Biriyani

Well these are the comments on the non veg section:
The Murg Lajawaab really tasted Lajawaab (Amazing) and kept me on the edge of the seat with its tangy and spicy taste.
The Kang Ka Ree had a nice flavour of Kaffir Lime which made all the difference. The chicken too was of soft and tasted nice.
The Malabari Jhinga Curry was one of the best in the main course section. It was yellow, creamy and had a nice flavour to relish.
The Roasted Chicken looked amazing and the best out of all the dishes. But it was not as good as it looked.
The Hydrabadi Biriyani was well cooked and the pieces of mutton were soft.
The Chicken Steak had great expectations but disappointed a bit. I found it to be over spicy and didn't like the preparation.

Well the ending is very important in a meal and they had some great stuffs in the Dessert Section.
Caramel Custard came first and was great to be honest. From its presentation to its taste everything was bang on.
Fried Ice Cream came next creating a great hype but it was just decent. The outer coating of coconut had some problem which made it ordinary.
The Darsan With Butterscotch Ice Cream ended in a good note to complete the food feast.

Well, this was a great test for my appetite and I passed with good marks. It would not been possible without such a great service of the staffs. Everything was perfect and its very rare to see such co-ordination. The hospitality had been superb. So once again thanks to Mr.Punit Lundia for inviting everyone.
The great evening ended with some good conversation with the owners. The goodie bags were presented to us as token of love at the end.

A long way to go ahead.

Ambience is definitely a plus point and food is good, both quantity and quality wise. But the location is very bad. Options of desserts is also less. Using mason jars for decoration is definitely unique. A nice experience altogether.

Reflexion - An exquisite place to dine in. 

===== 

Intro + Location: Well, it is located far away from my house. I was invited my Shahbaaz Zaman, a connoisseur and a friend to visit the reflexion restaurant. This place is a part of Majestic Suites and as soon as i entered the hotel, i was mesmerised by the interiors. They are really well decorated and was courteously invited by all the staffs. It was a good gesture of hospitality which i personally must appreciate. We took cab and it's located somewhere near Raigachi, Rajarhat, New Town Kolkata. 

After taking my seat, i started observing the menu card. The menu card was specially designed for all the foodies/connoisseurs who were supposed to attend with special comments space to help the foodies and connoisseurs to pin down their thoughts about food and their overall experience. It was an altogether menu prepared for all of us. I must appreciate again here the management's effort on taking time for preparing a special menu for all of us. Nevertheless, they started serving us one after the other. 

=====

What we had: 

Mocktails: 

‚Ä¢ Apple Mojito - If you talk about the presentation of this mocktail, it was peerless and splendid. The drink was quite chilled and was very soothing and refreshing to taste. A must try. It had a kick of mint to it which made the overall experience quite worth it.   ‚úå‚úå

‚Ä¢ Spicy Mango Delight - It was spicy as well as sweet at the same time. A blend of mango and green chilly with right amounts and proportions with tinge of tangy. A must try as well.  ‚úå ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Jamaican Nite Out - No words can describe how this mocktail tasted. It was so smooth like melting in the mouth. The little tinge of cinnamon to it was like an icing on the cake. I personally loved the taste of this drink. However, there lies a little scope of improvement with respect to the presentation. The presentation was good but can be excellent. It had one kitkat on top 

Starters: 

‚Ä¢ Stuffed Aloo - It was aloo stuffed with crumbles and mixed aloo and paneer cooked in clay oven. It tasted just fine. Personally, as a vegetarian, this dish seemed below par to me. It should not be made sweet because both the sweetness and the spicy flavour isn't going hand in hand. 

‚Ä¢ Crispy Chilli Baby Corn - It was good. It was less spicy than usual. Crunchy, crispy and even perfectly sauted in the sauces in the right amount. Well presented and lip smacking to the palate. ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Nawabi Kumbh - This dish refers to stuffed mushroom with house spices which was cooked in clay oven. I am personally not a mushroom fan but i can vouch for this dish. I literally took the whole piece in my mouth at a time with some chutney on it. Tasted great. I must say. ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Sanfrancisco Veg Roll - It was one of the best vegetarian dishes i tasted in a long time. It was crispy on the outside tasty and succulent on the inside. It comprised of cheese mixed with corn and spinach. It was fried but had quite less oil content which i personally liked it very much. Thanks to the chef for making it impeccably. It's a must try for the vegetarians. ‚úå ‚úå 

‚Ä¢  Kasturi Kebab - I personally liked the name. The chicken were usually more like chicken reshmi kebab with cashew paste and cheese marination. However, as the name suggests, there was a lack of flavour of the fenugreen leaves.  I would like to bring it to the attention of the management that the dish was beyond words and the chicken was super tender. The ultimate chicken kebab after a long long time!! It was just melting in the mouth!! ‚úå ‚úå  

‚Ä¢ Mutton Pasinda Kebab - This kebab had chef's special spices and coriander. I personally loved this kebab. I am not a die hard mutton meat lover but this meat was super tender and juicy. Would taste excellent with the green chutney and if served super hot. Mutton lovers, don't miss on this one.  ‚úå ‚úå 

‚Ä¢ Golden Fried Prawn - Presented in a very impressive way. I took a bite from one of my foodie friend. It tasted soft and the prawn lovers should not miss out on this one. It was served with sweet chilli sauce which made it taste even better. ‚úå ‚úå 

‚Ä¢ Fish Finger - The most common dish which is available across the city of joy and enjoyed by all the Bengali food lovers. Fish finger is something which is available everywhere and sometimes either served with tartar sauce or tomato ketchup. The one which we had at Reflexion was served with tartar sauce. It had a pungent smell to it here which was probably a turnoff for me. I hope they take care of it next time when i pay a visit. :) 

‚Ä¢ Cantoni Fried Chicken - It was great to taste and was served with hot garlic sauce. However, oil content was quite high though. Oil should be kept low in this dish specially. Please take special note to this. 

‚Ä¢ Thai Chicken Smoke Style - It comprised of chicken marinated in thai sauce and was served with peanut butter sauce. It was something unique which i had after quite long and did not taste like the dishes i usually have. It is highly RECOMMENDED. Try it with peanut butter sauce to enjoy and satiate your palate. ‚úå ‚úå 

Finally, a long list of starters ends. *sigh*

Soups :

‚Ä¢ Palak Shorba - The palak shorba was good. It had cream floating on top. It had palak crushed into it. Tasted good but should've been thicker. 

‚Ä¢ Veg Tom yum soup - The name sounded like tomato soup to me. However, it was their version of coconut thai soup. It had all the healthy vegetables like zucchini, brocolli and so on and so forth. Must try. The coconut milk flavour is my favorite and i could get the essence of it here. ‚úå ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Mutton Nihari Shorba - It was out of the world. Slow cooked preparation it is. It was splendid. Mutton was super succulent and the flavor was enticing and alluring at the same time. ‚úå ‚úå 

Main Course :

‚Ä¢ Dal Makhani - It was usual creamy daal. It tasted amazing and must try. Creamy and rich how we Indian's like it. Was topped with cream. ‚úå 

‚Ä¢ Nargis Kofta - I tasted just the gravy of it. The gravy tasted amazing. it was  saffron eyed paneer kofta prepared in mild white gravy. ‚úå 

‚Ä¢ Hunan vegetable with veg fried rice - Tasted superb. Had most of the fresh seasonal vegetables and was cooked in soya garlic sauce. ‚úå‚úå 

‚Ä¢ Murg Lajawaab - I had loved all the chicken dishes here. This had too much of tomato in gravy though. Please take notice of it. A little spice touch could make the dish really mouth melting. ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Fish begum bahar - It was bhetki cooked in rich saffron gravy. Was excellent. Fish lovers should not miss out on this one.   ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Kang karee - It refers to chicken in yellow thai curry. It tasted super awesome and i will surely order this the next time i come here. I personally loved it. It had that coconut milk touch to it.   ‚úå‚úå

‚Ä¢ Kameng Khia Wan - Referred to vegetarian Green Thai Curry. I liked it but preferred kang karee more. 

‚Ä¢ Roasted Chicken - It was insane. One full roast chicken for all of us. Tasted amazing. Was roasted to perfection and i was in awe when i saw how the dish was. Must try!! It was served with mashed potatoes and veggies. The mashed potatoes had a garlic touch to it and i personally loved it. ‚úå‚úå

‚Ä¢ Mutton Hyderabadi Biryani - The biriyani was dum cooked. It was full of flavors and spices. It comprised of aloo, rice and tender mutton pieces. I loved the flavor. The rice was cooked to perfection and so was the aloo. There was no such place where i felt that this dish lacked in something. It had perfect amount of oil and was not so heavy as well. I am coming back for this as well. ‚úå‚úå

‚Ä¢ Tandoori Bread Basket - It comprised of tandoori breads. Were fine. 

Desserts: 

‚Ä¢ Caramel Custard - Was good but not great. The Caramel custard can be enhanced a lot more!! Take care of it. 

‚Ä¢ Fried Ice Cream - It was good. However, the dessert sections i personally feel needs to improve a bit. 

=====

Special thanks to: 

‚Ä¢ Firstly, i would again like to thanks Shahbaaz Zaman for inviting me here and hosting such a wonderful meet. Means a lot. The place was treat to the eyes and the experience was jolly. 

‚Ä¢ The second place which i believe is of the Management. The staffs served us courteously and with love. I must thank them and i did thank each one of them personally for serving us endlessly one after the another without acting as if they are fatigued. 

Special Thanks to Mr. Punit and his better half for inviting us out here. 

Special thanks to Mr. Subhasish as well who hosted us perfectly and patiently. It was a right attitude on his part and he played a major role in serving us with perfection. 

‚Ä¢ Special thanks to all the foodies who were present out here. My experience was more enjoyable because we gathered, shared happy moments and spoke over food.

=====

‚Ä¢ Fine dining restaurant.

‚Ä¢ Serves most of the cuisines.

‚Ä¢ Amazing hospitality.

‚Ä¢ Decent serving speed.

‚Ä¢ Food quality is good.

Wow is an understatement for this newly opened restaurant at rajarhat. I work in Unitech building and stay in a rented apartment at rajarhat, I feel so lucky to have such a wonderful experience just 5 minutes away from my home. The hospitality is awesome, they havent started their home delivery, but still on request they did it for me without decreasing the quantity (normally the quantity is less in a take away). I am a regular visitor now and have tried almost all of the menu. The continental food is just mouth watering...biryani is worth mentioning too....overall an amazing experience.

I was simply passing through the Rajarhat Main Road heading towards Rajarhat Police Station for some personal reason. While passing, I have a glimpse of the exterior of a Hotel named as The Majestic Suites at Chotopol by the side of Rajarhat Main Road. While returning decided to peep into the hotel from inside as myself also belong to the same industry. The moment I stepped on to the reception lobby and turned to my left casually, just a single word I murmured - "WOW". It was the restaurant named as "Reflexion". The stunning interior with a blend of elegance and royalty reflects in inches. Being hungry we couldn't resist us from ordering my all time favorite Biryani. When the steward came with the smokey handi it was smelling amazing, still keeping my fingers crossed when I took the first spoon inside the mouth, guys I can bet that, the Biryani of Reflexion is surely going to give a competition to ¬†Arsalan or other renowned biriyani houses in Kolkata. It's a must try if you are visiting Reflexion.

Mr. and Mrs Lundia in collaboration with Shahbaaz organized a food meet for the 12 of us.

The hotel is located in a lane off Rajarhat, might be difficult to locate in terms of the distance but the destination and their food is worth the journey!
Expansively built, huge, clean, nicely decorated Majestic Suites! Their in-house restaurant, Reflexion was the chosen place for the evening meet.

Mr. Subhashish needs special mention here, he was with us throughout, walking us through the dishes, making us feel comfortable, engaging us in light conversations, even trying to match our wavelength to lighten the evening mood! Wow...excellent warmth and hospitality.

Moving on to the menu:

1. Mocktails¬†
- Apple Mojito: Flavorful, ample apple slices and refreshing.
- Spicy Mango Delight: What a delightful concoct! The spice quotient was controlled yet so tangy and delicious! Wow!
- Jamaican Nite Out: good old chocolate made our day!¬†
- Pineapple Mojito: The pineapple flavour could have been less subtler and the sugar syrup took it's place but nonetheless needs a mention!

2. Starters

- SanFrancisco Veg Roll: a vegetarian yet innovative starter.
- Kasturi Kebab: Best when eaten hot, and tastiest when dipped in green chutney.
- Mutton Pasinda Kebab: Delectably soft, cooked to perfection. Easily melts in your spice and it bombarded with various spices!
- Golden Fried Prawn: Yumm coating, nor too thick nor too thin. The fish quality was excellent, lacked a little in salt but understandable since they have to cater to different kinds of eaters.
- Fish Finger: Do not expect the usual! Tasted good.
- Cantoni Fried Chicken: Chicken winglets served with hot garlic sauce.
- Thai Chicken Smoke Style: Completely different from what I had tasted till date. The flavors come out best when smeared and eaten with peanut butter sauce.

3. Soups

- Palak Shorba: generous dollops of cream in pretty green shorba, looked beautiful, tasted clean.
- Veg Tom Som Soup: The perfect blend of coconut milk, chillies and shallots.
- Mutton Nihari Shorba: I have never tasted anything as exquisite as this one...rich in flavor.

4. Main Course - Indian

- Dal Makhni: The dal was superb.
- Nargis Kofta: Looks royal and tastes yumm. The white color tempted us to taste and keep asting the dish, it was finger lickingly good!
- Methi Mattar Malai: Mattar, how can mattar be so good!! That added touch of coconut, the sweetness, made it delicious!
- Murg Lajawaab: The gravy was well cooked and the fragrance was tong. It was on the sweeter side.
- Fish Begum Bahar: The fish was good.
- Malabari Jhinga Curry: The coconut gravy was impeccable. the prawns were perfectly cooked.
- Mutton Hydrabadi Biriryani: You have tasted enough biriyani if you are living in Kol but then you haven't tasted it all unless you try it here! Light, flavorful, delicious, yummy, forced to eat with your hands, leaves a smile on you face!
- Tandoori Bread Basket: Lacchcha paratha, Butter nan and masala kulcha.

5. Main Course - Chinese

- Mandarin Fish: Fish quality was okay. Gravy was good.
- Hunan Vegetable with Veg Fried Rice

6. Main Course - Continental

- Chicken Steak: Chicken breast with a stuffing. Accompanied with a veloute sauce.
- Roasted Chicken: The chicken was well cooked and the sauce covering the chicken was good. Mashed potato and veggies were the perfect accompaniments.

7. Desserts

- Caramel Custard: Needs to special mention, known to everyone. The sweetness quotient was controlled.
- Darshan with Buttrscotch Ice Cream: The darshan was laced generously with honey. It needed to be consumed quick. The combi of darshan and butterscotch was pairing up well.
- Fried Ice Cream: Good attempt.

The evening ended on a happy note, where the owners interacted with us, and the surprises that were revealed in the end made our day!!

They had arranged for chocolate pan, and personalized gifts! ¬†Excellent place with no complaints!!¬†
They have banquet halls which can be ¬†booked for family events. The hotel has something to offer to their guests! Keep continuing the excellent work!! :)

Sunday lunch went here with my family. Had butter naan...black daal....fish begum bahar and mutton biryani. Loved the food. Great value for money. It was my birthday so they offered me a complimentary dessert. So was more than happy. Food is really tasty. Service could have been little faster...never mind.

My Registry Marriage was arranged at The Majestic Suites. It was an overall good experience.¬†

Positives :¬†
> Very polite behaviour of the staffs
> Paying attention to the needs of everyone
>¬†The ambience
> Good food (but it could have been better if there were less pressure on that day, the hotel was hosting a Tollywood party so understood ¬†:) ¬†). I liked the Crispy corn and the fried rice.

Negatives:
> None as such only that the food rates could have been a little less

Overall I will say its a a great place to host any party.

Amazing place
The food is very tasty and the restaurant has a very nice decor. All the things that I tried were a real treat. Its extremely close to city centre 2.
The chicken steak was one of the best that I've ever tasted and the Chinese items were filled with flavour. They also have a small area within the restaurant to host a small get together. The experience was great!

This restaurant is inside the Hotel Majestic suites and is right opposite my house Green heights on rajarhat Road. i just wanted to try out the place being so close and had a wonderful experience. Amazing decor and ambience. Really liked their private dining area....could ¬†not sit there as minimum 10 PAX is mandatory. I ordered for fish begum bahar and murg butter masala with tandoori rotis. Had a great experience. Would love to visit again.

I visited there twice and Mutton Biriyani is a special mention. The taste was amazing. We ordered stuffed Paneer Pakoda and chicken Kasturi kebab and they were out of the world. 
I tried blackend chicken on my next visit and it definitely turned out to be their signature dish. Caramel custard is a worth mention too.

I haven't seen such a huge variety of cuisines at any other restaurant except REFLEXION.  Ambiance is very calm and composed with trained staffs and quick service. The private dining space gives the required privacy in the house.  It also gives nice offers and discounts. Now we have a good restaurant option in rajarat apart from city centre 2. What a relief!!

I have been there for once and ordered few snacks. Apart from the food which i liked the most is the ambience. Was bit confused about the combination but the captain helped me and my friends to have those dishes which are absolutely economical for us. And I am very much satisfied with the service. We had Chinese and the taste was heavenly. I would def try to take out sometime to visit the place one more time with my family and friends.

Went to Reflexion with my family after Saturday movie night. This was my second visit to the newly opened joint in Rajarhat. The multi cuisine restaurant is a part of a newly opened Boutique hotel in Rajarhat "The Majestic Suites". We reached at the joint around 9:30 pm and were super hungry. We were seated on a six seater table which I must say had a very plush feel. The best part was the Interior and the ambiance of the place, very calm and soothing. As we were starving, we asked the captain to bring us any three starters of his choice (two veg and one non veg) as quick as possible. We were recommended to try out chicken kasturi kabab, lovely corn (which was similar to crispy corn kernels) and stuffed aloo. The dishes were served to us in another 10 mins which was pretty quick and the items looked yummy. Being a hardcore NV, I took a good helping of Kasturi Kabab. To my amazement, the chicken was very juicy and rich in flavor. Me and my brother, emptied the platter in another 5 mins. I tried the stuffed aloo, the potatoes were cut into half and stuffed with paneer masala and dry fruits. It was both interesting and tasty. Moving on to main course, we ordered for dal majestic, fish begum bahar, murg lazawaab, hunnan vegetables, chilly garlic Noodles and butter Naan. All the items were equally good. The dal majestic was similar to dal Bukhara. To top it up, we were offered caramel custard as a complimentary dessert which was out of the world. Overall, we had a great time @Reflexion. We will definitely visit again to try out their Conti items as well.

Went there with 3 of my friends after hearing from others about their Kasturi Kebab. The menu was huge. Tried their Kasturi Kebab and Mushroom Cabana (recommended by the staff), and were superb in taste. The staffs were well trained & attentive, knew about the dishes and their suggestions were also good. We enjoyed our food and the ambience (since a new joint, so very few customers), and were very well attended. Wish to try their Chinese & Continental Stuffs in future.

First of all should tell all, that I never expected such a flashy restaurant in that area. Should give a hats off to the owners. Coming to the food, Mushroom Cabana, Lat Me Kai, Veg Spring Rolls were heavenly. In the main course, Hakka Noodles was just as expected. Hyderabadi Murg & Mutton Rogan Josh made my day. The menu was so extensive, I dont think I can complete it in 4-5 visits even. A dinner to remember.
