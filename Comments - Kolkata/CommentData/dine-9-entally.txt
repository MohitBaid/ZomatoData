I would say the food quality is such a poor that you will find problem in your health. Me and my friend went for a lunch and after having lunch,my friend started vomating at that moment and i am suffering from bad stomach problem.i am still under medication. I would recommend not to visit this restaurant. We are going into a restaurant for good and quality food and they are lacking in that terms.

Very poor....they have put up delicacies in the menu that they never serve. Even the beverages dont turn up as they should. Not a good place if you r looking for variety.....

This restaurant is located in entally and was suggested to me by one of my friend I would rate this restaurant below average because it was not at all a nice experience for me ! What to talk about? #food #entrance #ambience #hygiene?? None of them deserves to be rated ! The entrance is shady and talking about food which is not at all tasty and hygienic ! I ordered hot and sour soup which had  dead ' Red Ant ' although they replaced it but still it was not worth trying! This place really needs to improve much ! I will think twice before entering to this place again !

Update :Changing my review . 
This restaurant plays with basic health and safety standards . As me and my brother entered the restaurant it was completely empty and there was no one to take the order. Soon a man came and handed over the menu after 6-7 minutes. We ordered for a stir fried vegetables which came with free 'ants'. The chilly garlic noodles we ordered was not at all spicy so we sent it back . It came again but was still no spicy so i told the waiter to get some chilly  paste ,he came after 10 minutes with some ketchup in a dessert bowl. So we told him that we want chilly paste which is used in all chinese dishes . He again came back with some green chilly sauce in a broken teacup . All the items in the cruet were also dried up and filled around months back . The waiters were also rude and said that this is all they can offer . So we left with the food untouched .
