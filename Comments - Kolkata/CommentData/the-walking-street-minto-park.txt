Love the food, especially the Maggies and the Mumbai Grilled Sandwich which is a must try. Love the options for juices as well and then topping it off with ice creams

Its a pretty small place bt perfect if u are in a hurry or wanna grab a lil snack..had the tandoori maggi it was amazing and classic maggi with extra masala ( who minds a lil extra masala in maggi ðŸ™ˆ) had cheese masala fries evn that was nice..its a combination of three ventures which is pai's malgudi..kwality walls n yellow straw
Pai'malgudi has the most amazing gun powder onion dosa..it was so crisp n tasty just like old days (when malgudi restro was near vardaan )
The juices of yellow straw was really nice specially their sitafal shake and watermelon and muskmelon juice and the fresh lime water was damn refreshing..service is fast bt the place is really small so one can sit n ear in their car or take a parcel
