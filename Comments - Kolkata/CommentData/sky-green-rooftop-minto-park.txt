An awsome place for veggie lovers. The food is too good and the quantity is appreciable.  If we are looking for value for money,  this is the place.  Response time is good and moreover the rooftop adds another flavour.  Keep up skygreen way to go.

Fresh and tasty food with pretty decent decor and ambience. I have no idea why this place is so deserted. I kind of like this place for quick bites. They don't have ac. The rooftop view is not at all nice. Staff members are very good. Service is pleasingly vast. They do offer a huge menu.
