We tried their Mac N Cheese with Corn Pasta. Really loved it. The price is also pocket-friendly. It cost us ₹ 80 only. The quantity was sufficient too.

A small kiosk near Bhawanipur College/Diocesan School.I visited this for the first time.No fixed seating arrangements just a stool here and there.I ordered a number of things and all of them had already been sold out.So I had to eat nachos which were available.The taste and presentation both were good.I will visit again to try the other things in the menu.

Good place to be in especially the cheese Maggi is very nice. The people there are also very polite and helpful. Do not try mac and cheese as it tastes very bad.

Brilliant cheese WaiWai and Burger. You can complain that it is the same as Nick n Nack but then the staff here isn’t as rude. 
Fried Oreo and Cheese WaiWai is a must try. 

An underrated place.

It is under renovation as of now. Went there after seeing the reviews here and I was not disappointed.
I had a friend along with me and we tried Mac n Cheese, Cold Coffee and Fried Oreos.
Fried Oreos was the reason I had decided to give it a go. I was utterly disappointed. It tastes like a normal Bengali delicacy MALPOA and had nothing to be WOW about.
Then comes the Mac n Cheese. It was awesome. We both loved it. Recommended.
The Cold Coffee was fine too.
It's cheap and the quality and quantity you get is excellent. Highly recommended. But for me, the fried oreos was a big let down. Will visit again for sure.

A small shop near story,elgin. Serves variety of fast foods. There are no sitting arrangements as such. Tried the cheese wai wai and mac n cheese. While the cheese wai wai was really good, the mac n cheese was decent. The cheese corn momos are also good. Overall a good place for a quick snack.

Ordered food from this joint last week. Quality of food is good. Quantity is quite sufficient. Food was good. The following items were ordered :-

1.Fried Oreos -  Haven't tried anything like this before. Very delicious and absolutely yummy.  Must try for everyone!!! 

2.Vegetable Burger -  Burger was good. Quantity was sufficient to fill your belly. 

3. Veg Momo -  It was OK. Not so good. Had much better in other places. 

4. Cheese Maggi -  Another best thing. Must try for everyone

Overall,  the items were quite good and tasty. Will definitely recommend others to try.

I had higher expectations from On the wheels, but the same were not met. The items were not bad, mind you, but they just did not touch the bar. 
We had ordered Macroni and cheese, cheese wai wai and potato herb burger. The former could be given a pass, and the latter 2 items were good, but better items are available at other places. That being said, On the wheels is a value for money outlet, and I can definitely see students rushing to this place. I, myself would not mind a second visit, but hopefully, they can improve the small things, like the cheese sauce/dip in wai wai, the chips served with burger being fresh (ours was stale) etc.

I had ordered Nachos in a Cone, Fried Oreos and veg noodles and manchurian. The quantity is really good for the price. The nachos and fried oreos were good but the noodles and manchurian was okayish.It needed to be more flavourful.

A great place caught my eyes as I was walking on Elgin Road. I was hungry like hell. So this little food cart was a god sent gift for me. The Corn and Cheese Momo was awesome. Pure cheese melting in my mouth with some spinach and corn in it. I was so hungry that forgot to snap a photo. But took a photo of the wonderful French Fry dish. Served in a cone. Deep fried and topped with Mayo. Great taste. Loved It too. Must visit for a quick and cheap snack time. Cheers!!!!

Attractive little yellow cart outside the Sony world showroom. Great place to grab a quick "lunch- on the go" at  pocket friendly prices. Love the Rajma chawal and the colourful momos, especially the cheese corn ones(must try).  Overall, tasty and fresh food at very reasonable rates.

I have always been an avid reviewer on zomato and this time I am writing down this review for my brother's venture after I have  finally tasted the food and tested the quantity and quality. 

On The Wheels is a yellow coloured food cart placed outside the Sony showroom in Elgin road, near Bhowanipore college. It churns out various types of comfort food.

I started with the French fries, served in a cone with a swirl of mayo, the quantity was good and the taste and texture amazing.

Then we went on to eat the noodles and Manchurian. The taste and quantity was spot on. As per the pricing of Rs 60 goes .It gets full marks.

The best thing about this cart is one can be rest assured about hygeine as Nikunj is taskmaster when it comes to cleanliness. 

What I really loved is the fried Oreos. With a drizzle of chocolate sauce it is a really innovative dessert. 

I had the sandwiches too and they were good to say the least.

The coloured Momo's are the show stoppers here 
The yellow usual ones
The red spicy ones
And the green cheesy corn ones. 
The colouring was something all had advised him against but he had gone ahead with it. I liked the cheese Momo's as they were different.

Overall I had a great experience.

I have visited them 3-4 times and tried all their momos. Their cheese & corn momos are really good and filling. In general the team there is friendly with the owner himself dealing with the customers. Also tried their set meals which are good value for money. They can up their presentation a bit but overall a great spot.

Delicious food. Amazing location. Unique Concept. Pocket friendly. The rajma chawal, Mac n cheese, Chhola Bhatura, Exotic Colourful momos are superb.
The sandwiches and burgers are amazing. The French fries and nachos in a cone are mind blowing.

Mini food truck right outside forum! Home made chutney and momos. Burgers were there as well. Try out the fried Oreos 👌

I recommend heading there before heading into forum, ppl generally tend to hog here after movies and all the good stuff finishes really fast.

On The Wheels is one of a kind Food Truck, parked strategically outside the Bhowanipore college area. A really good idea to attract a lot of customers. #RajmaChawal is their stand out item. I have been ordering it regularly. I also got my hands on #Mac-N-Cheese but it fall flat on the taste, but a good effort. Sadly, #chholekuche is never available. And, #NoodlesAndManchurian & his better half #FriedRiceAndManchurian is in search for a better flavour, i feel. I'm surely going to recommend everyone for their spectacular homely #Rajmachawal.

Crossed this small joint on my way from Forum. Its so small that I almost missed it. I tried the Green Corn and Cheese momos. Was in a hurry so they were kind enough to pack it. 
The momos were good. Different in taste as well. The sauce served with the momo was lipsmacking! 
For the price the food was really reasonable!! 
Can't wait to try more stuff :)
