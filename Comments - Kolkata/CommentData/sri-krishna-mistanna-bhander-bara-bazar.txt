This place had been my favourite since childhood days. For the last 15 years o my life, I visited this place for their special mishty Doi. They also keep variety o sweets like Ghewar n rasmalai but occasionally. It's just behind the Tarasundari Park, just at the start of Barabazar!

This outlet is located by Nimtala Street. The place sells good quality sweets at low price. I visited here and tried few of their sweets. Liked their Rosogolla, Lancha and sandesh very much. 
Prices are much low sweets range  Rs.5-10 mostly.

Situated in front of tara sundari park back door. Famous for it's dahi and rossogulla. Decent sized outlet with 5-6 tables to sit. Ambience and hospitality was good. Quick service and pocket friendly price. Tried their rossogulla, samosa and dahi 100th of times from my childhood. Taste was still the same delicious. Must try place. Recommended.
