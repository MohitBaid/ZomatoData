This place is quite old and have visited a couple of times earlier during school and college days.

Recently went there and tried Chicken Cutlet which was served with Potato Chips (thats newly incorporated i guess) and salad.

The food was taste but the place has become shabby and the ambiance might not be liked by you. Good food in reasonable price.

Until yesterday,I didn't know about the existence of this place. It is situated amidst the chaotic New Market and has a old world vibe. The staff who attended us was extremely rude and treated us like misfits. However, we chose to order Chicken Chowmein and a bottle of cold drink. The Chowmein served was decent in quantity and sumptuous in terms of quality. Due to the reasonable prices of the food, this place is okay to grab some quick bites.

I used to like the food here eons ago.. The coffee is still good.. But everything else has just hit the ceiling.. The famous huge moghlai paratha here has become a tad too oily and i cannot make out what do they stuff it with. It tastes like soya flour n bread crumbs to me.. The potato on the side is dry and tasteless.. The the fish fry has reduced in size with a barely there fish slice.. The coating is too thick n u feel like u are chewing rubbery bread crumbs.. The indian dishes are too plain and the quantity is blink n miss..its definitely not pocket friendly considering the quantity they give and the lack of air conditioning.. The staff of course give u n old world feel.. Not worth the food but just worth the old memories and that is about the only reason why the place is teeming with patrons...

Food is not really pocket friendly.. bit on the higher side I would say, although quantity is sufficient and taste is satisfactory. But the place is extremely dingy. There are few cabins but I really felt the seating arrangements could have been improved. Me and my friend had to rush and get hold of a table just as the people seated there were about to get up. We had to sit there waiting for the staff to clean up the dirty plates and leftovers! That was horrible.

Situated just at a corner of New Market area, Esplanade.

AMBIENCE: Its big area with largly maintained sitting arrangement. But it does not have any AC facility. It has cabin for families nd couples. Due to humid weather outside I felt little suffocating. But Overall ambience is average.

SERVICE: Now the service was good and staffs were also very co-operative. Initial I ordered Chicken biriyani but due to lack of time I cancelled it and changed to Chinese. And the staff did it with no fuss at all. Cleanliness is maintained.

FOOD: The price of food here are quite in a handful budget, and can be afford by everyone. The food was good. I ordered Chicken chowmin and it was served hot and in proper time what it needs to be taken. I guess to me the chicken was little more chewish.
But overall the food was good.

Overall experience at Regent was average.

Regent has always been a great experience. The phrase "foodie's paradise" definitely fall fit to describe Regent. It has been serving its customers with food and love for the past 80 years. This place is not about great ambience or fancy gourmet cuisines, it is about the spice and flavours of India. It's about nostalgia and stories of how someone came with his grandfather and now comes with his grandson. Regent is the perfect blend of delicious food and nostalgia. I think everyone should experience the feeling when in Kolkata. 
Special mention : Kabiraji is a must try.

An old joint situated in new market, this place is a decent option for mughlai dishes. The place is non-AC. They have few cabins apart from the usual table chair seating. Food is average. The biriyani we had was not extraordinary but certainly better than the present standard of new market aminia. The price is average. Overall, you can visit this food joint once in a while if you are tired of the regular options .

really have nothing much to write about this restaurant..
an old, traditional (non AC & having Cabin system), but not such renound but popular restaurant..
located at the heart of the Kolkata.. Esplanede area, very near to New Market..

serve Indian, Mughlai & Chinese all.. we've tried the Indian & Mughlai..

avarage taste.. Good but nothing special..
Biryani was a bit sented, with a bit salty flavored mutton makes it different.. but not bad..
quantity is good enough for one, both main coarse and side.. but good amount of mutton (as we tried mutton only)..

overall.. not a fine dine out place but not bad for eating..

This place always make me nostalgic as I used to come here in childhood days with family, generally during puja shopping. This place is known for its kabiraji and moghlai. Went there after a quite long time. Their taste has degraded but this place is still like before with people sitting with tea and chatting. This place may be far behind well decor restaurants neither have professional and courteous staffs but it gives a feeling old Kolkata.
Best thing to try here is kabiraji along with cutlet and moghlai paratha as these are the things happening for years

Food is good. Quantity is also decent. But the price is not at par with the food. Dude, who's gonna pay 170 bucks for a plate of mixed chowmein in a dirty inn with no AC and proper fans? Alright, I payed. 
Though the food is nice, there are better restaurants to walk into in that area.

Regent Restaurant was once quite a buzz and due to this fact, my uncle, who used to once reside in Kolkata wanted me to buy stuffs from this place.

It is located in New Market Area in the corner just opposite to the ATMs of SBI and others alike, on Chowringhee Street. The time I was asked to order from this place, Zomato was not known to exist and hence did the blunder of buying stuffs.

I went there and asked to pack the Regent Special Mutton along with another item of Mutton followed by Chicken Korma and a Stew. There were one or two random items too which I do not remember now being it such an old incident.

Since, the preparation and time was taking a bit of time, I sat in one of the seats meant for dine in, and a shrewd waiter immediately came to inform me that I cannot sit if I don't order for food which I could have countered but decided against. After a long time, when the food came packed, I paid for the same and went back home.

On reaching home, we hunched upon the food to which I did not like the Chicken and the Mutton preparation was pathetic. While others did not comment much, as it was uncle's wish to order and didn't wanna disappoint him. Well, the order was a complete disaster.

A visit to be avoided much!

Kolkata is all about the old world and past relics. The city exudes a heady mix of modernity laced within the bowels of an effervescent past. Kolkata is also about its food. And the glory it radiates is simply irresistible. One such past relic is The Regent restaurant. Located near New Market on the rear of The Grand, diagonally opposite of the KMC, this misnomer of a restaurant is ever flowing with visitors. And a majority of them are patrons. It is not a classy or snazzy joint. But Kolkata breathes in here. The bhaat and mutton jhol is at its best when served piping hot at The Regent. It is a favourite haunt for couples tired from the tour of the bustling New Market. The Moghlai paratha is another delicacy which they call a legend here.
So if Esplanade or New Market beckons, you know where to look for food.

Kashmiri biriyani was really amazing. Its full with gretted grated cheese and boiled egg and kismis. they used tandoori chicken in butter chicken masala and its taste yummy. The only drawbacks of this place is the ambiance. Its not good at all. Service was good and its a very pocket friendly restaurant.

This restaurant has old charm of being in the heart of Kolkata and has a fan following of its own but unfortunately I found the food is not good enough and not even at par in comparison with the street foods. It just serves some common stuffs those are eaten more frequently than any other food items.  Not just that, I found the place is untidy and extremely unhygienic. It has quite a good location for doing an easy business even if it tries with similar and common items, but only if they serve with zeal and tidiness.  I would give negative recommendation for anyone. Owners, Do it in better way or otherwise don't do it at all.

I wish there was an option to give a '0' rating.
We walked into this resturant tired and hungry afer spending the entire day at new market but were rudely shocked.
The ambience was poor.The staff looked like they couldn't care less about anything.
We ordered prawn chow mein and fish butter masala ......the food arrived and we had taken 2 spoons of the prawn chow mein when we saw chicken bits in it. As my mother doesn't eat chicken we called the waiter and asked him to change it.He responded by grumbling and made us wait for an astounding long time before finally the prawn chow mein arrived. It appeared that the cooks had just picked the bits of chicken off as I spotted some tiny bits of chicken still there. 
Afer all this hassel it just didn't taste good.The fish butter masala tasted like the typical bengali 'macher jhol' which was a far cry from the original item we ordered.To top it all the food was ridiculously expensive for such poor quality,quantity and the other things that I just mentioned. 
All in all a horrible experience.

Today I decided to visit regent after my work for lunch since i was in a hurry. Regent is located at opposite of rang mahal near peerless inn. This restro's a very busy place since its near to the market so shoppers always pay a visit here.

I opted for a normal chicken biriyani. It had a normal piece of chicken & an aloo. The taste was okayish & quantity was decent but nothing wholesome. The chicken wasn't served with the biriyani but instead a piece from some curry was served which was unacceptable

But the only reason im rating this low is due to the exhorbitant pricing of the menu. The prices are too steep in my opinion. Being a non a.c restro i surge is too high. My biriyani cost 150 which wasn't a justified tag at any means. The service was good though!!

Fish kabiraji, mixed chow both gravy and hakka, egg fried-rice and mutton korma are my personal favorites. The food is worth the money they charge. The service is quite fast however the waiters have a little attitude problem. 
Lets talk about the food now. The fish kabiraji that they serve has a big chunk of fish that has been deep fried after dipping in a batter, it comes with salted potato chips. Its enough for one person quantity wise. The fish is always fresh, taken into consideration that I have had this too many times there. It has a little hard crust on the outside and the fish just melts in your mouth.
The mixed chow has egg, prawn and chicken in it. Perfectly cooked. I find it very yum. A plate of mix chow is enough for two people only if you are okay sharing it with your partner.
The mutton korma has this sweet spicy taste and the mutton just melts inside your mouth.

 The rest you need to go to find out.

It's a pretty decent restaurant based in New market area. I still remember when I was in school and I came here for my first date. Lol! We had less  money and we were very hungry and so within ₹100 bucks we got quality food. There is nothing fancy at all about this place. It gives you the retro feel. The people outside of Kolkata may find this place amazing as my elder sister is a mumbaikar. So, I introduced my mom to this place one day we went for shopping and last year my mom introduced my sister to this place and she felt very happy. So, extra 0.5 for the nostalgia.

The waiter serving us was rude and arrogant, uninterested to do his job. Rolls, kabiraji andx other hits were unavailable and disappointed me further. The service used to better. 
Unless there is no improvement, this shall be rated at 2.5 and that too for the past experiences.

A roadside restaurant close to New Market. At times have dropped in here after strenuous hours of shopping in New Market in the afternoon. Have tried their fish fry, biryanis. Food here is good. For some quick meal a decent place to check in.

Below avarage food quality and territory. Old fashioned hotel. Management and staffs are okaish. Quick service. We ordered spcl.  Moglai paratha. Find nothing special in it. More or less road side street food taste.. price range doesn't  match with the food standard. Potato side dish was a disaster.

An old fashioned restaurant located near New Market. The pricing here is cheap but the quality is mostly like a roadside stall. Used to drop here quite a number of times many years back while roaming in and around Esplanade. Particularly loved their Rice and Chilly Chicken. Have tried their Roll as well, but the quantity used to be pretty less.

This was a all of a sudden meal which I had with my brother when we went for some work near New Market. Nothing to say about the ambience as these kinds of restaurant don't need to work on that. Always hustling with crowds. We order Chicken Biriyani for both of us. The service was damn quick and the Biriyani was good too. Totally worth it.

I've literally frown up with this place in my heart. A date with parents at New Market always ends here. Yes I love this place, despite what people say (people are too much into air conditioners, fancy appearacnces, and great decor, fine dining). It's a place you oughta be if you just love good food and the old Calcutta charm. Must haves include Mughlai Paratha, Kabirajis, Paratha with Mutton Kosha and their signature pudding.

Located near the new market area this place is among the old favorites specially in school college days when our pocket money used to be less and in Kolkata the food scene was conservative.

Always liked their gravy noodles and the usual fishes like chilli Chicken or Indian dishes like chap and roti etc. I don't have any idea about present condition but it still carries the old style Kolkata restaurant flavor which I like.

Generally I order chilli Chicken and fried rice. But yesterday I had tandoori roti with chilli chicken. For food I could have given 4 but for decoration and serving the rating from me is 3.

New Market is full of restaurants & Regent is one of the oldest. Its simple & old looks may make you think, there is some value for money foods available.

Decorations : Just after entering into the restaurant you will find old school looks & why not, its based on an old Calcutta style building. Lots of sittings are available & everything is basic but clean. Its non AC so long hanging ceiling fans from the higher roof is there. Separated personal sittings are also there. New painted walls are very empty.

Staffs & Management : Their are lots of sits & a number of staffs available to handle those too. Although they aren't fast enough or their chef aren't fast enough, so order takes time to get onto your table.

Foods : They have a huge menu to choose from  simple Chinese to Moghlai. But they doesn't have any special dishes of them.

Chicken Roll : Roll was made of very thin Paratha, that was also very lightly fried. Chicken pieces inside of that was ordinarily. Very less chicken pieces & much of onions were there. Sauces were ordinary too. All of this didn't make the roll tasty at all.


Special Moglai Paratha : Moglai came in a separated plate with another plate of dry potato curry & salads. Moglai itself was big in size & very crispy brownish fried. It made me feel that its tasty but I got disappointed by the first bite. It was fully poured with fried eggs inside, where chicken pieces were really hard to find. Full of green chillies & onions were filled inside that felt really odd to taste. Smell of oil was not good that ensures its of bad quality. Overall the taste of the Moglai was not good at all, better to say worse.

Pricing : Pricing is relatively higher considering its a non AC restaurant. All the dishes are above 100 bugs but the taste doesn't even justifies that. However they doesn't add any kind of service taxes with your bill.


Conclusion : Being in New Market if you are thinking about to try Regent, you gotta be kidding me. With such a bad quality food for a higher price than you think of, you can only expect a worst experience over here. An absolutely not recommended for foodies, even for people dying out of hunger.

This is clearly one of my favourite outlets for having Fish Kabiraji and Mutton Cutlet. 
Yummy and delicious kabiraji is soft and full of taste to its core. 
Mutton cutlet also has no points to be deducted as the outer coating is at optimum thickness and doesn't feel you are having a biscuit instead of a Mutton cutlet. 
Other than these snackies I have seldom tried other food items as their quality is not upto the mark.

As I write this review I see a lot of uncomplimantary reviews posted.I feel a little dejected because instead of being a wham/bam/thank you ma'am kind of reaction a little bit of historical perspective helps in really unlocking the values of places like this.

This is an old place catering to several sections of people.It used to cater to footballers of the Calcutta Maidan smaller football clubs,hence they used to have a transparent chicken stew served with toast.I think they have discontinued it now.It used to cater to middle class shoppers at the new market area who could not or did not want the Park Street fine dining.So along with Anadi cabin on the other side of the K.M.C building they served a mean chicken kabiraji and cutlets.But most of all the main servings were for the shopkeepers,vendors and employees of the K.M.C for whom they served the chicken curry with rice,mutton curry with rice and a fish curry as well.Ladies and gentlemen to judge this place you have to have the mutton curry with rice and salad and though the quality of mutton has gone down,on their day they can give better places a run for their money.It is what I had and cannot complain at all.

I read quite a bad review for Regent. But actaully I am quite a fan. If you know how to dig in food, Regent is okay.
Pros.- 1) Reasonable for mango people
2) Almost all kind of food (very Indianized version )
3) A large area
4) when you don't have time to go anywhere else, and you need fast food, its the right place
5) A charming/ cute boy attempting to communicate in English will make you smile

Cons- 1) don't expect the word hygiene here
2) The washroom section makes you sick
3) Most of the people are rude and not listening to you at all
4) Most of the food are spicy.

* Tips- 1st grab a table, put your bag there. Before doing anything, order as simple as possible. Keep looking for your order, ask for it many times like you are in a hurry. Don't try any dessert item. Try Regent special mutton, yellowish curry filled with shredded eggs. Also, Rooti is preferable decision over rice.

My relation with this restaurant goes way back since I was a kid. Long hours of walking, hearing that hullabaloo in that afternoon shopping, with parents would finally end up here.
All that hopping in with my sis for some Biryani was bliss. Hardly used to try anything while we were small.

Back in the those days, the content provided was far more than sufficient, covered the full plate basically. & that view in itself filled me with content & joy. 
The meat - tender, rice having the exact amount of spice and the epic yellow potato - perfection!
However, I'd lie if I say I was satisfied with whatever I got, as I always asked for more, considering the huge foodie that I was ( & am ). I used to fight with my sis to gimme more & like as if she was so ready to offer. I got none.

I went there again yesterday with my sis. Hungry as a pig.
Ordered a Mutton Biryani, Mutton Korma & 2 plain Naans.

Mutton Biryani : DRY! Period. In the facet of taste, its th'e' Biryani of Regent Restaurant with no change at all. The same look, the same rice & seems to be the same method of preparation. Pity it was dry. The rice was dry but the mutton pieces were not and were moist & tender; so it turned out to be a strange "rainy-summer'' combination. Weird right? But the glorious potato...YEAH baby...it remains as glorious and sublime as it was in its previous years. Moist, yellow & yum!

Muttom Korma : Mutton - check! Gravy - check! Salt - check! Greasy - check! Taste - check! Yum? - Do i still need to mention?
Exactly the right amount of salt & sweet. Loved the small surprises of cashews & raisins with each bites. You shouldn't be wondering twice before placing your order. Just Go For It!

Naan : Ummm...not that good! Sorry. I have had better Naans. It was a plain Naan by the way. & considering this restaurant is so way old ( read ancient ) & specializes in Mughlai, I was expecting better. Not that its bad. Its just not exactly how I had wanted my Naan to be. Something was a miss.

All in all, a wee bit disappointed with the food. Its hard to miss that the quality & the quantity that they are providing is going down the mark each time I visit.
But, well...this restaurant is pretty senior and considering a lot of other restaurants are propping up, its tough to match their tastes if they don't improve theirs.

The staff service remains still the same! ;) Indifferent. They come, they serve & they go ( with a stern look for tip - mind you! ). They are like the no-nonsense staff. Not much shu-sha...

Despite the minute shortcomings, I WILL visit this restaurant again, no doubt about that.
I have way old memories attached with this place. It was a family time - always & who doesn't love that! ;)
A little bit of nostalgia engulfing while i finish this post! : I

Never mind! You, reader, I will advise you to go there once & try it out yourself.
Ciao! :)

Such a piece of shit it was, We ordered a plate of Chicken Bhartha and Butter nans!!! The butter naan seemed to be papads with soft places within..... The chicken bhartha was with excess of butter and the shredded chickens were quite hard!!!! And finally it ended up causing severe headache and stomach pain to her! The service was quick, but the food is below the grade!!!

This is a place my father has been visiting since his childhood till date. And i am now an young adult and still they are standing strong. The moment you enter you know that you get a flavor of the old Kolkata. Food is pretty standard nothing fancy. Though i should say that those of you don't like oily foods should avoid because like any typical Bengali dish they use lots of oil while cooking which is quite evident from the food.

This is one of those classic old Calcutta restaurants that has been around from a lot of time. I used to visit this place since I was 5 years old with my grandma and my mother and thus I also have a sentimental place for this. When you visit for the first time, expect bad service from the waiters as they're really old and grungy and the service is a little slow. But the food is better than their behavior :D don't expect impeccable quality but its above average. Most of the times I've had a fish fry or a fish cutlet along with chicken bharta and a mixed fried rice. If you're in this area and looking for a filling quality meal this is the place to go to.

The food is amazing , at pocket friendly prices! Great for post-shopping lunch! Their Butter Naans and Kulchas are a must try. Chilli chicken is good. Their items are served piping hot, so be careful not to burn your tongue!!! The place has secluded seats if you want some privacy . The main part of the eatery is a little cramped and crowded , and is always teeming with people! The place has never disappointed me and makes me nostalgic every time I visit .

I have been to regent so many times since my school days but never got the chance to express my views, for that would like to thank zomato. Though there is so many gigantic name here in kolkata for the food genre like biriyani but i like regent's biriyani and chicken tandoori the most.. But there is few bad part as well like they dnt have a.c facility though the food price is not lesser than any other standard restaurant and i would not like to recommend the place for them who give importance on the ambiance of the restaurant..

A step inside regents brings back memories of old. The food is pretty good and the heritage feel of it is a bonus

By far one of the worst n unhygenic place ever to have food, the pricing is exactly the same even more in some cases compared to any mid range resturant, but despite the fact of this amount of money, they dont even have an AC, the plates they gave us had some small yellow spots which clearly shows that the dishes wernt perfectly washed, the food was the same, the food was so unhygenic we had just 20-25% n had to throw away the rest, Regent had a name, its one of the oldest place to have food but i guess with time they forgot to keep their name in a good way n started making profit only n no goodwill, it was a nightmare for me to go there n i am done with that place until n unless they make improvements...

This classic destination can be called as a "heritage site" in  the city of joy,The location of the restaurant is something which is a dream for every restaurant of India,and Regent's food does it pretty well to balance the equation.People come here from the edge of the city to experience the class of food and excellent service.The place is mostly gathered by the shoppers who come nearby to shop in The big market and then sit here to relax and please their tummy.The chicken biryani,the mutton kosha,and even the Chinese items will just keep your thumbs up!!

I realy like this place a lot.I am a big fan from by childhood.Whenever I visit new market this is the place where I end up visiting...
Their mouth watering Kabiraji,And rezala amazed me again and again all over the years.They surve all kinds of mugalai food and some indianised Chinese.I love their kabiraji this is the best kabiraji in the whole world.I realy don't like the behaviour of the waiters same like coffee house but the service is faster so nothing to complain about.This place is always too crowded so if you are not getting a place in the little room then its not so good.As very pocket friendy place any one can enjoy the food so always thumbs up..

Last week, post office I was going to a friend's place to celebrate the sudden spell of showers in Kolkata. En route to my friend's place near New Market I decided to pick up some snacks from this place. 

Location and Ambiance: Regent Restaurant located at one corner at close proximity to Chaplin Square and Roxy movie hall. Enter the road between The Oberoi Grand and Peerless INN and the last establishment on your right would be the restaurant. 
Nothing special about the ambiance as it is one of the oldest restaurant in the city serving Indian and Indianised Chinese. My friend told me that this restaurant is operating from pre independence times and one would readily agree given the set up. What I liked about the ambiance is that it is pretty spacious and clean. It is not air conditioned but very well ventilated. Though the furnishing is basic, it is comfortable and not cheap. There are even some semi open booths at one end which were once famous during the 1970s. 

Food and Service : I was not too sure what to order so thought of trying both Indian and Chinese, hence ordered one Chili chicken and 1 Chicken Pakora. We were asked to have a seat while we await our order to be delivered. I could see a lot of people having Mughlai Paratha at the restaurant. So my friend and I decided to try it out while we wait. The paratha accompanied with salad was served in 7-8 minutes flat. The size was big enough for a filling lunch/dinner. Thank God we decided to order one and share. The paratha was crisp, had generous filling of masala, egg and other ingredients which I am not too sure of, but it tasted really nice. Both of us were really impressed and finished it off within minutes. Priced at Rs 55, the Mughlai Paratha is a real steal :) 
By the time we were done with the paratha, our parcel was also ready. Service is good, the staff is polite and we were served at blazing fast speed. 

Back at my friend's place we had the chicken Pakora first. The coating and taste was just average. However the chicken filling was solid. By the time we started having the chili chicken, it was cold but then they were pretty decent in size and had a thin cornflour coating. It is more of Indianised chinese, but then it is good enough. 

Definitely a must go place if you are near the New Market area and want a quick bite. I really loved the Mughlai Paratha. They also have a special Mughlai Paratha priced at Rs65, will try that the next time I'm there. 
Our entire order including the Mughlai Paratha was billed at Rs345 which is very much affordable. They accept cards for bills above Rs200. A 3.5 for Regent

Firstly- a confession from my side. I am and will continue to remain biased towards this joint. Why? Reason is this joint has been frequented by my grandfather,father and me since my childhood days.I have dined in/packed my food on countless occasions and believe me they have made me happy every time. And that is what matters at the end of the day. A well fed bong is a happy bong :) 
Recently tried out the chicken korma,chicken tikka kebab masala and the mixed veg.All the items were very good.The chicken tikka kebab masala really stood out from the rest.The dish comprised of boneless pieces of chicken tikka cooked in a thick, spicy rich gravy.Neither too spicy and nor too dry.Just as i want it.Only flip side is that this dish takes considerable amount of time in preparation.Other items were well made too.
Honestly speaking so far i have polished off a decent portion of the menu.And i can safely say that their forte is the traditional bengali snack items- fish fry,kabiraji,afghani,moghlai porota etc.
Service-Waiters are moody and indifferent at times.Myself being an old timer get special attention and suggestion about items to order as always.
Hygiene- Manageable but nowhere close to fine dining joints. The place has been recently refurbished thus resembles a fresh look.
Fellow foodies might have a contrarian view about this joint , each to his own- i say.

This place has been in existence since the thirties(YES you read it right, 30s) and  qualifies to be among the still rocking Bengali owned budget joints in the city.It is frequented by office-goers given the vicinity of KMC headquarters and shoppers of  New Market and Lindsay street shopping area.The restaurant is a strictly no-frills joint and serves a whole variety of Indian &  Indianised Chinese dishes.One should visit this joint only for the food and not for ambiance. I would say that the typical variety of Bengali/Kolkata snack is their forte.I am referring to the quintessential Mughlai Paratha,Kabiraji,fish fry,cutlet etc.The main dishes are still quite good and are quite satisfying to the taste buds.  I would recommend items like Chicken Korma,Mixed veg,Chicken Afghani,Chicken tikka masala-kebabs cooked in a spicy thick gravy and the Biriyani from quite a decent spread of items in the menu.The only drawback of the place is that the place gets very crowded during lunch hours and getting a seat is a hassle at times.
Once upon a time this place was a rage among people from various cross-sections of society especially the Maidan going football fan  but has lost its charm due to dwindling footfalls in the New Market area  after the onset of Malls in Kolkata. They have this cabin style seating arrangements for couples  and families thus reminding one of the bygone cabin hotel era.I visit the place for the double whammy of food and nostalgia.Cannot get better than this, can it?

They make really nice egg puddings. Apart from that they are average, I agree. Good place to rest your feet when tired from shopping at Esplanade.

The top things we look in a restaurant is the ambiance, the service and the top most is the food. This restaurant got 0 (ZERO) in the first two part from my side. Being enough modest I can say their service is worst than you could ever imagine. The 1st experience of this place is enough for me to avoid this for ever.  I've gone their with my friend and finding no seat the waiter told us to go to the last "Cabin" ( Here you'll get the old Calcutta style cabin service, though it is not a separate one), when I placed the order for one Mughlai paratha they simply refused to serve any kind of single dish inside the cabin, I don't know the reason. Afterwards they made us to share table with two other person. We have already ordered that's why we shared the table otherwise I was about to leave this shit place. The food was not bad but the waiters are least bothered to ask you for any kind of service, and you have to "request" them and wait to get any thing.  I personally got such a horrible 1st time experience, so I'm not going to give it any kind of try for ever, rest upto you. Thank you.

I have heard about this place from many sources. So I checked in on the way of my puja shopping. The place is shabby and furnished in old fashionista way. May be the ideal place for the elder generation to be precise. Wooden chairs and tables are the only decoration you can find. 

I was craving for food, so I ordered Chicken Biryani and Chicken Curry, though I am not fan of mutton. But I need to mention that they took more than 40 minutes to serve me. In y craving hours I looked at others plates and only drank water. There was a saying that you would eat anything in starvation. But when they served my food I found it very difficult finish. The Biryani they presented was drab in taste, and unluckily it was not warm enough. The Chicken Curry was lacked in flavors but the chicken was tender, that only thing I survived on. 

The service as I said earlier is very sloth. But the place carries scent of old ‘Calcutta’.

A bit like everyday hotel. Amidst of crowded dhramtalla market street,dis restaurant is a way to go. Ambience though not pleasing at all. Food tastes quite good.

although an old favourite of the older generation, i find this food joint coming nowhere near to nizam's which is just adjacent to it. but one can try the moglai paratha. it's wholesome and tasty. the chicken afghani is also good. not at all recommended for people who consider ambiance of a restaurant to be an important part of it.
