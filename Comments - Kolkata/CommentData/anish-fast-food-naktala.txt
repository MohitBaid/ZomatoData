This place is just 2 minutes from where I stay and so I regularly order food from here. Though the outlet is small it is quite hygienic. The fish fry, noodles, rice , chilli chicken , lemon chicken, moghlai are tasty and cheap at the same time. The service provided is also commendable. Overall a nice and affordable place.

A small take away counter with a huge fan following in the naktala areas. They offer rolls, cutlets, moghlai parathas and various Chinese items. Their best are the rolls. My personal favourite- the chicken cutlet..  heart shaped it has an old world vintage kolkata charm in it.

A very small take away counter. They make quite nice chinese. I had noodles yesterday. It was quite sufficient in quantity and good in taste. No sitting arrangements. You have to stand and wait for your food.

The place is small but they surely provide nice food. I am obsessed with the gravy version of mixed noodles.
But I have to wait for a long time here And I dont like that...dey do not even have sitting arrangements.
