Excellent Bengali food - I had it delivered to my home. I would have given 5 ðŸŒŸ but the delivery was a bit delayed due to the place was understaffed.

The fodd contains lots of hairs. Yyeeaakk.... be careful while eating. The barber shop is attached with the restaurant so lots of hairs present in food.

Sixth person crowds this place, no proper second table, and in summer, it's an oven. 
The food is average, service is good. The only option around for a decent lunch and dinner. Chinese- it's not much going to tense, have a heap, the hot garlic fish was too good, paratha stuffed with potato was too nice to resist. Mix noodles, fried rice, all comes in good smell and taste. Seat availability is never predictable, and that's what going to bother. Around NIOH, you won't find another place to rest your butt out... The Abhiskar gets that advantage, but they lack the skill to explore it.

Ordered food from here today as none nearby were delivering for lunch and really had no expectations as i never visited this place or ordered food and also no reviews here made me sure that it is not one of those very notable places to order food from and yet decided to give it a try as an experiment.
Ordered Malai Kopta, Mix Veg, onion salad and rotis. I won't say I was impressed with their delivery as even after being nearby it took them more than an hour, other than that the oil was spilled all over the food when I received it.
Mix Veg was indeed too oily but preparation was an average one, wasn't as bad as I expected it. Malai Kopta was decent too only I felt it could have been more tasteful. However the food was according to the price I paid and quantity was sufficient too.
No regrets at the end!
