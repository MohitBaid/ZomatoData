This is very very old local sweet shop tucked in a corner plot along the main Southern Avenue stretch in the portion between the new swimming pool and Rabindra Sarobar stadium. 
My review pertains to their Dhakai Parota (originally known as Dhakai Bhakarkhani in Bangladesh). They prepare it so nicely that to me, theirs is the benchmark I've seen in India. It is served alongwith cholar daal.

This is a "para" Mishti dokan and I simply love their mishti doi which is too good. Their doi is different from those of other nearby shops....they have a "Lal" mishti doi which is deliciously creamy with a thick set rabri like layer on top making it yummy. This said the rest of their stuff is ordinary. The specialty is the Daccai porotha served with cholar dal which I didn't like at all. Hygiene too is a problem which they need to address.

I was a daily visitor of this place when I was in school. This place is too famous for their "khasta kachori". They make it superbbbb. I bet you wont find any better anywhere. Its kind of a fulko luchi and cholar dal pured inside. Totally bhuribhoj jalkhabar.Â 
And talking about their sweets, rasogolla, lancha, and rasomalai are too good. If you are in southern avenue area, dont go away without having from here.

its a 'mishtir dokan', i don't think you'll need anymore reason to drop in here. we all love mishtis, dont we...
 you will get conventional mishti doi ,sondesh, langcha and rasogollas here. but the showstopper is the 'dhakai porota', its a layared fluffy porota and is served  with cholar daal. which is out of the world.

This is a small sweet shop located near the soutern avenue swimming pool back gate. I would highy recommend the Lal doi and the dhakai porota with cholar dal. The lal doi is its speciality and is a must on sunday lunch at my home. dhakai porota is a huge hard crust luchi with sweet cholar dal and is yummy. Their sweets are alos reasonably priced but not as good as the doi
