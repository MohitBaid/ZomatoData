Tawa is a small joint in Bhawanipur located near Julian Day School. A kiosk where you would get Chinese Fast Food and Kathi Rolls. It is a place mostly preferred for take away. The place needs to be lil cleaner and hygienic. I had a Egg Fried and Chilly Chicken which was quite decent and at the price its a good deal to get. The rice was not oily and tasted decent. The Chilly Chicken had a thick outer coating which I didn't like, but the taste was nice. The packaging was good too and the delivery was quite fast.
Overall a nice place to have some decent fast food in very reasonable price.

This is a small take away counter located opposite to julian day school. Once some guests visited my house without prior info. So, i came here and ordered egg fried rice and chilli chicken. 
The quality of food was really disappointing as well as the quantity. The food packets are very small. The rice used im fried rice was quite thick as used in steamed rice. The taste was otherwise good. The chilli chicken was good but nothing extraordinary. I wont recommend this place as there are better restaurants nearby !

The food is average. I liked the Chinese. For a small fast food centre ,the food is good. But the food quality has gone down as I have seen in days .

A small chinese food joint located opposite to julien day school, previously named as Suruchi, offered good food at low price.. Now, food quality becoming disgusting and doubling the rates. Recently had chowmine twice and it was over-boiled and oily, no taste at all.. Bubye Tawa, u lost an old customer.

This is a small fast food joint located in Ramesh Mitra Road Indra Roy Road crossing opposite Julien Day school.Since it is located very near to my place I have had food from here numerous times.
When it first started it used to prepare very tasty food and at very cheap prices.Of late the quality of the food in one word is inconsistent.The prices have also gone up of late but it is still reasonable.
My favourite item here is the egg tarka.It is really tasty.But of late,sometimes it is a real let down.They also make decent rolls and pakoras.The chowmein and chilly chicken are okay.The service is prompt.
There is no question of ambience as there isnt any! There is no seating facility as such. There are just a few stools outside.It is mainly meant for some snacks or takeaway.
In short this is like any other small fast food joint,but where the quality of the food is slightly better specially the egg tarka.

Just located in the location of Food Station,in Bhowanipur,5 minutes from my house. It serves good quality of food,well quantities following with acceptable service. The place where i see most teenagers having roll after tuitions and though its not a standard restaurant it serves tasteful food sometimes and sometimes tasteless. I often go there and deliver especially pakoras from there. My favourite dishes in this eatery is Chicken Pakora and Fish finger. It is not having any ambience at all just a board written"SURUCHI". Anyone can visit there any time cause all the time food is available but not between 12am to apparently 7am.i would rate it 3 stars.
