Had momos several times on visiting New Market. Momos taste good. But the staffs' behavior are something of concern. They are very casual in approach and do not care if somebody is dissatisfied with the food quality. Sometimes they don't even turn back to answer if someone asks which dishes are available. That is very rude!

Tried almost all their items- steamed momo, panfried momo, chicken spring roll. Pretty cheap. No taxes. Very quick service. I make sure to hit this place whenever I go shopping to shreeram arcade. They've outdoor sitting provision. Nothing too special about this place but this is a must-try if you're sport for quick bites!!

Cheap momos available but the place is really dirty. When I tried the momo here, somehow I felt it was not fresh. So I tried again another time and I got the same result. Disappointing.

Didn't like this place much. The Momos were a bit stiff according to my disliking. The only good thing about this outlet is the convenient location.

A pocket friendly small outlet at New market area near Shree RAM Arcade. Got a plate of momo which didn't have enough stuffing inside and failed to deliver according to my expectation. Although the service was quick to suffice your quick hunger.

Small momos outlet near new market area. Price was pocket friendly but not worthy. Staff was not so friendly. Hospitality and ambience was average. Service was quick but presentation was too bad. They served in steel plate which I didn't liked. Steam momos dough was thick and filling was less. Soup was also watery. Pan fried momos were Delicious. Spicy and juicy.

Good stuff, the hot n tangy sauce is awesomeness.  The momo skins are a bit too doughy but overall its fine. Am not a fried momo fan but in love with the pan fried momos here, good stuff.

Decent momos in this small joint. Had fried momos. Tastes good.. But there is no proper place to seat n eat. If they arrange a place for seat n eat that would be great.

A small yet so much crowded food stand of the area, food quality is kinda bad but the price is cheap. Sitting arrangement is some stools randomly put in front of the joint. Service n employee behaviour is not up to the mark.

Well..few years before..being a newcomer..I didn't know most of the places in Newmarket and this was the place where I used to have momos..stuffing is quite less..the outer layer is too thick..the soup is watery..even a few years back they didn't taste so awful..even prices were less..so..iv stopped having momos here..its a waste to the taste buds.:(

Some years ago, I thought they make okayish momos but as the years passed by, their momos' quality have deteriorated like anything along with the price rising up. It is very unhygienic. Atleast they should maintain the basic hygiene, the "rastar momo walas" are cleaner with their stuffs and surroundings. A few plastic stools are all that it offers for ppl to sit. I would definitely not go again.

This place has got some disastrous rating here :-D, trust me it is not that disastrous, only not really good. Had been to this place couple or three times I guess. 
It's cheap and so is the quality of momos served, nothing like darjeeling momos. And yea, unhygienic. A day I saw a dead rat lying in front of the shop. Made me sick enough not to eat from them after that day.

The lamest excuse in the name of momos ... They have unhygienic and dirty space to being with .. the staff entering just kicked the stool ... Sick ! The chicken momo was very poorly made and the sauce was the cheap bottled red chili sauce with a little coriander. Had packed a veg momo too... on opening the pack i realized that there was no sauce given .... the momos were covered in black specs of dust and the box had a dead insect laminated in it .... i almost puked . 

1 star is also too much  for them .

Darjeeling momo junction - doesn't remind you of Darjeeling momo's in anyway.

It's located in the lane of new market where various fast food stalls are located. As I tried street side momo it was horrible so I thought to try at the momo junction.

As I didn't want my experience to be more horrible I just ordered one veg momo. The momo was believe me horrible. The thick layer of dough was very hard to eat. The momo wasn't at all succulent. The soup served with it was served with an unwashed rusted spoon which didn't make me try it one bit. They added soya beans in it which looked like chicken so made me shocked at once. 

As per the hospitality issues, I had no issues with them. 

Service was prompt. Prices were reasonable. Quality wasn't up to the mark.

I got myself a plate of chicken momo the other day while browsing through new market as this place looked promising. However, failed to deliver. too doughy momo skin, without enough filling inside - and I did not like the chutney served with it at all... too mild and underwhelming. Although served, hot, the skin of the momo was still quite tough and thick.
