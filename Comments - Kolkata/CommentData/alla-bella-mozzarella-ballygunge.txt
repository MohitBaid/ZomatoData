This is an amazing place for pizza lovers. They will bake the pizzas live in a wooden oven, which gives them a lovely flavour. Their chocolate fondue full of gooey goodness is also a must-try item. Though the prices are on the higher side, it is worth every penny if you want to experience good pizza in Kolkata. Will keep returning to this place.

They serve really nice Pizzas here. I was not so much impressed by the Pasta though. And there was focaccia which I didn't like at all. But I have been told they have worked upon it. I'd say, one should definitely explore this place.

The Pizzas and Pasta dishes are here pretty good and can be worked upon but it's something else that blew my mind. The mushroom soup they serve is to die for, it tastes simply amazing!

Pretty and cozy place with limited seating space. It is the lane opposite 6 Ballygunge Place. We ordered potato fritters in Alfredo sauce, alla Bella mozzarella pizza, lasagna and pizza with broccoli, jalapeño and sun-dried tomatoes and dessert was wood-fired molten chocolate cake. The wood-fired pizzas were amazing, cheesy and each topping had a distinct taste. The lasagna was average and I felt that cheese was overpowered by maida. Potato fritters was crazy amazing in taste. But the winner for the evening was the dessert.
So overall, must have is Pizza and Dessert.

Woodburn Pizza is the USP of this eatery. Its a small place with seating capacity of approx 15 and offers fresh thin crust pizzas. There are not too many options to select as the menu is crisp. Pizaa Al Alla Bella and Penne Arrabiatta were the favorites. We also tried the homemade Patate Fritte in Arabiata.
The pizza had a soft and delicate texture with an almost puffy crust. This is a result of the “moist” heat that the wood oven provides.
The Pasta was spicy while the wedges were also nicely prepared.
Instead of waiting at the table we witnessed the live preparation of the Pizza and were entralled by the mechanism used.

A slice of Italy in the midst of a busy city!
Ambience--the moment you enter this apparently unassuming cafe, you get straight transported to an old world italian cafe and the music they play is a major reason for that. Haven't been to a place with more authentic Italian ambience!
Service-- is slow. Since they make their pizzas in the wood fire oven right in front of your eyes, visit the place with time in hand.
Order- we ordered their special thin crust pollo pizza, a lasgana and for dessert the chocolate fondant.
Food-- the pizza is the best I've had in the city. It was mindblowing and so so authentic. Not the indianized pizza we are used to having. Lasagna was okayish.
The fondant bowled us over so much that we had to order another one!
Bill- around 1700. So yes a bit on the costlier side.
Overall-- can visit again just for the ambience and the music and the pizza. Felt like I'm in the godfather movie!

I m not a blogger ..... But somehow i feel i must share some highlights from my visit to this place.
The first order was indeed nice ....Arrostito Peperone... Yummy! Quantity could have been better.
My friend and i ordered 2 varieties of pastas.... I kept waiting to my pasta which did not arrive almost till my friend was donewith his eating. On asking for it we realised the order was not even noted. Some more wait and it finally was served. Half hearted effort. Pasta was horrific. We left half the stuff on the plate.
There we no other guests. 
The staff then started playing music on their mobile or some cheap video clips which was so annoying. After a couple of few expressions of discomfort that stopped. 
While paying the bill i asked for water. Again no response. It was only when i started coughing and my friend raised his voice asking for water did i get a sip.

To summarise: Bad food .... Bad service

This place came highly recomended by a foodie in Kolkata. But i landed in a nightmare. Perhaps someone should read and seriously take some action to put things right.

Really cute place and the food was great. However, overall experience was less than average.... wanted to sit by the windows but one Ac was spewing dirt and the other water... also the mess created by the AC was not even cleaned.... 
when we sat at another table and asked for the AC vent to be shifted up they said the swing wasn't working either...
When the ice came, it was dirty 
Also, we asked for music to be played repeatedly but to no avail.
Service was also average
I never write reviews but just wanted to share some constructive criticism cos the place has so much potential!! It can be a 5/5

We also oredered a desert which was molten lava cake. It was really very nice...the chocolate flowing was too much... full liquidy inside. Amazing place to have good italian. Though the muisc track was bad no english or hindi songs. They play some other language only. N the location is little inside from the main road. Its inside the lane after birla mandir opp to petrol pump.

Had the most horrid experience with the representative of Alla Bella Mozzarella and service of Zomato. I am the last person to write on Facebook let alone be active. 

I called the restaurant to ask them if they have a delivery service. They told me to place my order on zomato or swiggy.

I placed the order on Zomato hoping that being located so close the food would arrive in a jiffy. A part of the order was a Pizza. The food arrived 75 minutes later. The Pizza was ice cold and not edible. I called the restaurant to inform them about the same. The representative had this to say:

Our pizza was ready and lying with us for quite some time. The Zomato guy came in late to collect it so there is nothing we can do about it. We did not send it using our in house delivery service and our role is to keep the food ready for them to pick up! 

I am not from the food industry but if your selling pizza how can you knowingly let it leave the restaurant when it is not in the right condition. 

I hope Zomato uses the right equipment to deliver pizzas. You need an insulated carry case or something to maintain the temperature of food! Moreover be on time! 

Nothing against the restaurant but they sure need to improve on their customer service big time.

Located in the bylanes of Ballygunge beside Patha Bhavan, Alla Bella Mozzarella is a fairly new place for pizza lovers.
Me and my friend were initially confused with the Italian names of the dishes which the waiter was kind enough to clear it up.
Among the many recommend ones we opted for the Polla Pizza and Sphagetti Di pollo
The sphagetti di pollo was awesome with thick cheesy sphagetti mixed with minced chicken pieces and it tasted heavenly.
On contrast the Pollo pizza was not up to that mark.
Tge wood fried pizzas were a tad more fried with small amount of smoked chicken.
Among the starters we were disappointed when we came to know of the unavailability of Tiramisu and Bisconitto and thus we had to settle for the Wood Friend cicolanto fondette.
It took a ridiculously long time to arrive however the taste made up for it.Thick gooey chocoate with vanilla ice cream was a bit too much to not fall in love with it.
Would love to come back again maybe once more to try out some of the remaining pastas..

So.. I finally went visited this place after a long long wait. Finding friends who agree to eat italian and travel 40 mins to get there are both a difficult combination. 

The resturant is easy to locate and greets you with a huge sign board. On entering the resturant, the ambience is nice, with minimal seating and nice lighting. You can see the famous pizza oven through the glass panel of kitchen..

We ordered: 
Caesar Salad - It was tasty , but far too much mayonense to be a salad. It had adequate chicken and croutons. And the seasoning was good & paramesean grated on top. But felt it was too rich. 

Crumb Coated Pollo - Average. The chicken pieces were good size with a thin coating. The dip in the side was good too. 

Pollo Pizza- was delicious. It had the stringy cheese effect. Thin crust cooked to perfection. But had a little less toppings than expected, but the cheese was a lot. 

Overall it's a nice place to visit for a good warm meal.  Price was 1225 for our three orders. 

Would I recommend Yes! But only if you are in the vicinity.

Went there for pizza. The place is situated on a narrow bylane, not far from Ballygunge phari. 
Ambience: 5* - absolutely loved the decor, and the Italian music playing in the background was making me feel like I'm in an authentic Italian pizzeria. 
Food- ordered Pizza Funghi. The thin crust was crispy and had plenty of topping. Delicious.
Beverage- homemade lemonade was ok and refreshing, but it's not smth to write home about.
Will visit again for one of the best pizzas in Kolkata.

Hideousness is an understatement for this place. Risotto does no justice to the name itself, instead was a mushy n goey mix of cream and some cheap rice. It should have been named a salted rice pudding. Most unpleasant meal and they will charge a bomb for it. Bon Appetite

I visited this place on 25.06.2017, on entering the place I found it empty. I had heard a lot about this place so my friend and I dropped in today at 4:45pm in the evening. 
The ambiance was alright, what I really liked were the moustaches carved on the chairs. The music is just too loud. As we entered we got seated near the window seat.
We ordered the ham, cheese, mushroom pizza and a carneberry lemonade.
The pizza arrived within 20 minutes and it was delicious. It was excellent from the quality of the bread to the toppings everything was perfect. 
It was the carneberry lemonade which was disappointing, just normal carneberry syrup poured in cold water and served in a normal glass. 
The staff on the other hand is not attentive, they are busy chatting amongst themselves, you have to call them repeatedly to catch their attention. So service was a huge disappointment also. 
If I do go back it will be just for the pizza and nothing else.

The initial dissapointments began with the unavailability of salmon fish that day , which i wishlisted having here after hearing some raving reviews from few fellow foodies. My next choice was linguine mushroom pasta , which also  they couldn't serve due to the unavailability of truffle oil . The staff kept on offering other suggestions so that we change our minds to skip it , and on sticking to that particular dish , lastly he admitted that it was not available.

We settled for one FETTUCINE CARBONARA ,  heavily brushed with oil which rather spoiled the taste. The staff suggested to try half- half pizza, BOLOGNA and POLLO. The pizza was baked properly and we liked the bologna more. But when it came to the billing , i expected they would add half charges of both , instead they charged the full portion price of the pizza bologna with higher price. This is unfair. The WOOD FIRED CHOCOLATE FONDANT took almost half an hour to arrive , not one of the best versions i had , was good enough . 
The prices are stupidly high comparing what we get , neither there is a spellbinding decor or a super level of service for which they charge 6.5% compulsorily and government taxes on top of it. The staff were actually confused and uninformed of the availability and details of the dishes , served food late and took almost 20mins to clear the bill. In this competition of restaurants popping up in every bylanes of south kolkata serving affordable and wonderful cuisines , i don't see any reason to come back here and end up spending so much. Not worthy at all.

It is a small dimmly lit place with not much seating area. The food was good, especially the soup for which I could give it a 4 star but the service was not good at all. The restaurant did not have ketchup for which the waiter had to go and buy. Ketchup is a basic essential especially in an Italian restaurant. The waiters were friendly so they understood and bought the ketchup.

Ordered Margharita pizza from this place today. It was awful. The crust was overbaked and flaky- like a thin,hard biscuit. The topping was almost rotten- the cheese was puffed up, chewy and sour. I paid Rs 418 for this 12 inch of inedible food. Horrible experience.

So we ordered food for delivery and the result was a shocker. They sent us the pizza in pasta boxes! BUT that's not what pissed is off. When we called the restaurant a "so called" customer manager named John claimed that this was how they delivered pizzas and they didn't keep pizza boxes. That was a blatant lie because I've packed pizza from here before a D got boxes.
 The manager then proceeds to argue with us over the next 10 minutes about this without sounding the least bit apologetic. When we demanded for a refund he asks us to call the owner of the establishment and promptly hands over the number. 
Meanwhile I've threatened him that I'm going to be going to the restaurant right away and I'm going to be leaving a bad review on social media and he says and I quote 'you're going to get a refund so what's your problem after that".. Like WOW

Upon calling the restaurant and after much shouting the customer manager John just said he will refund my money as if thats the solution?!???? FAIL FAIL FAIL!

Was really fond of this place, until I found hair in my pizza ! Really loved the food but highly disappointed with their delivery. They had called and said during my order that they ran out of pizza boxes but when they replaced my pizza, it was in a pizza box ! I wonder how it managed to pull off such a disaster !

Cozy atmosphere and nice service. Great salad and their pizzas will make your day. They also serve a mean cioccolato fondente. Prices are a bit on the expensive side, but what you get in return is worthwhile.

I was eyeing this place for a long time. Made a sudden plan to go for lunch today. It's external appearance is quite shabby. But the interior is very beautiful with dim lighting and lanterns. The staff was friendly but the place is slightly understaffed. We ordered a Margherita pizza and one lasagna. The pizza was good, not extraordinary but pretty good. The lasagne arrived almost half an hour later and it was slightly disappointing. It was too spicy and the quantity was not enough for the cost. Overall good for a one time visit but overpriced.

Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon and it was empty which got us thinking about the food here.
But after having the food we were more than happy with it. We didn't order much. We ordered 2 large pizzas- Pollo pizza, which was smoked chicken and herbs and the Bologna pizza which had a mutton topping. Both the pizzas we're very tasty and now I can count this as one of the great pizza places in Kolkata.

Really disappointed with the food and the service . The lasagne was extremely chewy and the pizza was tasteless . The home made lemonade had no flavour at all 
The entire restaurant has only one person taking order and serving the food

Had gone to this place on a sunny afternoon for a quick lunch. Had ordered their ACM Classico which didn't have the regular tomato purée instead had a fine amount of pesto paste on the pizza. It had jalapeños, rocket leaves, feta and olives. We even added mushrooms. It comes in 8slices. We had ordered their oven baked molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream which was average.

Been there just a few days back .
The place is so pretty and is located inside a peaceful bylane. Coming to the food :

Al fungi pizza : This pizza tastes great and has the perfect amount of cheese. And the best part is definitely the open kitchen, and how the pizzas are made from brick wood. Its filling for two people.

Spaghetti with minced chicken : Tastes good. The noodles consists of the right amount of flavour. However the quantity is small.

Location - If you are coming from Park circus side,take a left turn after crossing Kwality at Ballyunge phari (take the lane next to Kotak Mahindra bank), go for 120m and you will find All Bella Mozzarella. Similarly if you are coming from Gariahat side ,take a u turn at ballygunge phari and follow the above instructions.
Ambiance - A small Italian joint with good furniture. Moderately lit and the space is well managed here. 
Food quality and quantity- This is our first visit here and wanted to taste something of their recommendations. They asked to order Pollo Pizza and we had ordered the same.  The taste was good. Pizza 🍕 size was okay for two. pizza is incomplete without coke so we ordered it with the pizza.
Service- Service was between average and good
Look forward to try more of their item specially their pasta
Pocket pinch - 2 coke and one pizza will cost you around 800.

Difficult to locate but a quaint little place in a peaceful alley in Ballygunge. Nice decor and good choice of music too.
We had the Pollo Fritto for starters. It had 4 pcs of crumb fried chicken with a truffle mascarpone cream dip. The dip was to die for!
Then we went for the Quattro Formaggio pizza. 12"inch pizza with 8 slices. It was amazing!
For dessert we had their Wood-fire cioccolato fondente. It was so good, we ordered another one again!
Definitely going back. Quite reasonably priced too!

Took my mom for some Italian indulgence.. was there in the evening so the place was pretty desserted. The decor is really simple but cute. Styled like a road side tuscan pizzeria...really charming! Ac was not chill enough though.. so the amount of food sweat we had was the only not so good thing bout this place. Ordered for Pollo fritto as anti pasti... basically crumb fried chicken in mascorpone dip
 The chicken pieces were super crunchy..the dip delectable. Truffle taste wasnot very detectable. Next was Bella Italia pizza... massive and scrumptious!! One of the best mushroom ham thin crust in the town! One word for the pizza was perfection. The pizza followed with Rissotto Al Funghi.. it was really delicious.. though the rissotto rice was not aldante..the rich gooye taste made up for it...BIG Time.. The portions were quite hearty..had to pack both pizza and rissotto back home. Yes i had a fab breakfast today.. Staff is courteous.. So to sum it up..i definitly will be back for some more fill in Mozzerella.. !!

A good Pizza joint for people who prefer something beyond Dominos. But that's pretty much it.
The pasta was pretty basic for me as were tge drinks (nothing signature I must add).
I had two kinds of pizza. The Quattro Formaggi (in pic), was cheesy yet had a nice bite to it. The Normal Chicken one was decent enough but would have liked a tad more bits of Chicken.
Overall, good place for pizza lovers and adda.

Happen to visit here for a nearby home experience of Italian cuisine as am put up in vicinity.Starting from food to hospitality all score 4 out of 5 .One of most important aspect of good Italian restaurant is the quality and variety of mocktail they have on the cards.All that they lack in this section which they really need to work on.And yes one of the instance where we asked for ketchup and all that we was handed was regular pouches.I mean that's such a strange thing to encounter.So to balance equal for me it's a 3 with lot of room for improvement.

A bit hard to locate but it's on the lane opposite to the Dakshinapan market. Space is limited. Looks like some street side pizzeria in Italy. I tried their pizza, which they made in a brick oven right before my eyes. It was so so delicious. Would love to try the other items too.

Hadn't eaten much here, but the place is small, comfy and it has a completely different environment. 
The staff are friendly. 
The two dishes that I had were the (I don't remember the names) garlic bread with cheese and the lasagne. Both were really good, worth it intact. I'm yet to try out the woodfired pizza.

Great decor. Room is filled with wooden chairs and tables. Service is tad bit slow but i guess thats because of their wood fired pizza. 
Now we had the cream mushroom soup which was very very heavy. It was not something for me. It was tasty no doubt but not something you can have more than 5 spoons off. The pizza was tasty! And tasty is like an understatement. Absolutely authentic Italian pizza so do not expect the dominos pizza. 
The place is in my opinion a bit expensive. They charged a bottle of mineral bottle for 85bucks. This things usually dont bother me but i mean this had to catch my eye. 
The beverage options are very less so i really hope they add some more.

I found this restaurant on Zomato while looking for a place which serves italian. Later I remembered that I had passed by it many times on the way to a friend's house and although we had planned to go in on various occasions, we had given it a miss seeing the long queue outside. Well, it was not at all crowded when we went there for dinner last night. I just love this joint! the decor is very rustic, with soft lighting and they actually play Italian music here! Which was a big plus for us because most places we go to play the same old chart toppers all the time. The food is good. We had Patate Fritte with alfredo, Lamb Lasagna, Risotto with mushrooms and Chocolate Fondant for dessert. The Risotto was good, but could have been a little less salty.  Everything else was delicious. Our only regret is that they  did not have the tiramisu. Also no alcohol on the menu. Would have been lovely to have a glass of wine to go with the wonderful food. Will definitely  go back and try the wood fire pizzas next time.

I was really excited when I heard about this place but this place turned out to be a total disappointment. 

Staff - pathetic; they don't even bother serving you a glass of water on your table if you're waiting for someone at the restaurant. You've to ask for it repeatedly. Food was okay. Less variety as compared to other Italian chains! 

They don't have much stock with them either is why when I asked for another aerated drink (Thums Up); they said that it got over. 

If you really want a mouth smacking penne Arabiatta; then visit this place else not. That's the only dish I liked. 

Overall an okay experience. Wouldn't call myself a happy customer nor would I recommend this Italian joint over any other in Kolkata!

A fairly new place in the Ballygunge area but it is simply so nice. This place boasts of a quaint ambience and very well mannered staff. Foodwise too the experience was really good.

Cranberry lemonade: This was a winner. It was very refreshing and tangy.

Lemon iced tea: I felt this was too sweet, didn't like it much.

Foccaccia mozzarella cheese garlic bread:
This was fresh and cheesy.

Brushetta al pomodoro ;I didn't like the taste of this much since it was a cold appetiser. But it depends upon preference.

Al funghi pizza: The pizza is the best thing this place serves. It's so cheesy, fresh and the thin crust is perfect. Loved it.

Alfredo penne: The pasta too was beautiful. Very creamy.

Pesto Di salmone: it was a salmon dish accompanied by a soup and was just so beautiful to taste. Loved it.

I liked the dessert as well. It was chocolaty, perfectly baked and tasted different. Love it.
Must give this place a try.

Been here with my foodie friends in lunch time to try some of their italian snacks, signature drinks and dessert. 
It was situated in Balligunje Phari area. I suggest you to use maps ro reach the exact location if you're not familiar to that area.
Decent sized outlet with proper sitting arrangement. Designed and decorated very beautifully. Designed in old italian restaurant style with retro bulbs, brick walls, wooden chairs, wood fire and beer container shaped Wall bulbs. Fully Italian themed restaurant love the décor.
Ambience was really nice and so as hospitality. Very friendly and helpful staff. Service in reasonable time and presentation was superb. Reasonable price. 
In drinks I tried Homemade Lemonade which was so refreshing and amazingly delicious. Little tangy and very sweet love the taste and it looks fantastic too.
In starter I tried Focaccia Mozzarella cheese garlic bread which was the tastiest dish of focaccia bread I've ever tried. Melting mozzarella topped wood fired focaccia bread coated with thin layer of garlic paste tastes heavenly delicious. Loved it. Then I tried their signature dish called Al Fungi Pizza it was a wood fired thin crushed mozzarella topped mushroom pizza which tastes amazingly delicious. One of the best pizzas I've tasted. We ended with their most famous dessert named Wood fired cioccolato fondente as it's name it was wood fired Choco lava cake which was perfectly made. Hot and heavenly delicious dark chocolate lava comes out from spongy brownie tastes heavenly. Served with vanilla scoop.
Before rapt up like to thank management and staffs for serving us with happy smiles.
A must try place. Personal favorite. Amazing experience. Highly recommended to all.

Alla Bella Mozzarella is a cosy restaurant situated near Ballygunge Phari, serving authentic Italian cuisine. The name of the restaurant means "The Beautiful Cheese". The name of the dishes on the menu are Italian too, which make them hard to pronounce, but soft and easy on the taste buds as they are quite flavoursome. I had gone here for lunch yesterday with a couple of friends. We had ordered:-
Bruschetta Al Pomodoro
Focaccia Mozzarella garlic bread
Pollo Fritto- Bite sized pieces of crumb fried chicken served with a creamy dip. Great choice for a starter.
Penne Alfredo- White sauce penne pasta. Very creamy and tasteful.
Pesto di Salmone- Steamed Salmon with cooked with pesto and served with potato and mascarpone fondue. This dish was yummy and was screaming Italian flavours.
Al Funghi Pizza- Super thin crust and hence it was crispy. Loaded with cheese and mushrooms. Delight for any pizza lover.
Wood-fired Cioccolato Fondente- Molten chocolate cake,cooked in a wood-fired oven, served with vanilla ice cream. This was a perfect, chocolatey ending to the meal. The cake is very soft and the molten chocolate oozing out when you cut it, is a great sight.
The decor is simplistic with a rustic charm. Service is good. Would love to come back here.

Alla Bella Mozzarella is one of those hidden wonders of the City serving delicious Italian dishes. I paid a visit here last week and what I tasted was really impressive.
Here are the few things I would recommend you to try at Alla Bella Mozzarella.
• For the pizza lovers I thing the Al Fungi Pizza and the Bolo Gana pizaa are both excellent choice. Thick soft crust with beautiful toppings.
• Tre Formaggi Di Salamon, well the pocket pinch is hard for this small dish is brilliant. The salamon rolled up and is much juicy with its layers of cheese.
• Cranberry Lemonade : This drink not only looks beautiful but also good in taste.
• For the love of Pasta go for the Bolognese Spaghetti, which is served with Classic Lamb Raghu on top. Very good in taste.
• Desserts, take the Wood Fried Cioccolate Fondente, this will be one of the best desserts you will have. The hot chocolate with the Vanila ice cream and the brownie makes a perfect combination.
.
Pocket pinch was big, but reasonable due to the superior quality of food. Ambiance is nice and their service is also worth mentioning. Everything went very well.
Recommend.

This place was long on my check list and yes yesterday (on a sunday) I finally manged to visit this place.First things first there were only 4 customers on a Sunday eve and apparently all of them veg.Well to my relief on getting the limited menu card I found that it was non veg .
We wanted to have coffee which was there on the limited menu (2 pages) but the waiter said the machine isnt working.
We ordered some very basic stuff.
Chicken in breadcrumbs(pollo fritto) 310 - with a cheese dip..5 pieces of small disproportanate chicken cutlets perhaps pre-packaged frozen stuff.Seriously overpriced and very inadequate quantity.
Spaghetti in pesto sauce which was a veg dish to begin with at 300 + and had to add chicken with additional payment.I love pesto sauce and to be honest this was the worst I have had in my life.
Too much basil and oil making the sauce bitter..no cheese.The chicken in the pasta was like boiled and added, seemed like a last minute realisation to add them.Guess what they even had Parmesan cheese as an add on, who on earth does that.
So I eneded up paying 900 for these two dissapointing dishes.I am not complaining for the prices but the food that they offer is not worth it.I eat out every weekend and have never complained unless asked but yesterday I had to let them know that food quality was poor.

For all the Italian cuisine lover. This place is a must visit for all. The flavourfull restaurant is one of the best in the city of joy.  
Located in the lane after Ballygunge Phari bus stop.  
Absolutely lovely brick work in decor and music playing in the background makes the place beautiful.  

Beverage - 
Lemon Ice Tea - You don't want to miss on this one. Very few places in the city serve as good ice tea as them. Absolutely Flavourful. 


Food-
Focaccia Mozarella Bread- 
Soo cheesy.  Loved it completely, the slice of focaccia bread loaded with mozarella.  

Tre Formaggi de Salmone -  This is my favorite from all.  Fish with three layer cheese. Cant get better. 
Recommended for all fish lovers.  

Sphagetti Bolognese- This one was good, but i am not a big fan of the dish. The tangy flavour with lamb. 

Bologna - The thin crust pizza with spicy onion and red chillis made it wonderfull. Loved it completely.  

Dessert - 
Wood Fired Cioccolato fondente - 
This is one of the best chocolate fondente you will ever taste. Served vanilla scoop. The dish taste amazing. 

Lastly,  the service 
It was very attentive and looked after.  

Alla Bella Mozarella is a big Yes and Recommended for all.

Looks like a childish escapade.

A small outlet snugged at the corner of ballygunge place, it serves wood fired pizzas and all things Italian. The concept is pretty good but the food is far from tasty. The pizzas are thin crust and taste not that good. 
Be it the lasagna or red sauce pasta, nothing went up to the mark. They were completely bland. 
Only thing that tasted better was white sauce pasta (that too with extra cheese ) and garlic bread. 

I would like to thank the staff for bringing me a cake when I needed. They went up all the way to Kookie Jar and Skyline, just to get my cake. It was a great gesture. I would have given 3* to them, but the courtesy and amicability of the Staff is what won my heart. 
Thanks

If you are a lover of the Italian cuisine, this place brings you the flavours of authentic Italian food straight from a cafe in Europe! 
Its located in a tiny lane after the Ballygunge Phari bus stop ! It's a small place with brick walled decor and soft music playing in the background. 
Food : 
Foccasia Mozzarella bread: It was a thick slice of foccassia bread loaded with amazing Mozarella. 
Tre formaggi de salmone : This was my favourite item out of all and I highly recommend this dish to all fish lovers! 
Spaghetti Bolognese: Al dente spaghetti with tangy and delicious minced lamb! 
Al Fungi pizza : Thin crusted heaven packed with mouthful mushrooms! 
Chocolate Fondente: There couldn't have been a better way to end my meal. Delicious fondente with chocolate sauce oozing out of it ,served with icecream ! 

Beverages : 
Homemade Lemonade : This was an average lemonade. Nothing extraordinary !
Loved the place and the service !
Must visit!

Tucked away in the lanes of Ballygunge, this place is a must visit!
Dropped in for a sumptuous lunch here.
Friendly ambiance with an equally friendly staff.
We started with the Focaccia Mozzarella, followed by Pollo Fritto and Tre formaggi di Salmone.
The salmon was my personal favourite even though I'm not a big fan of salmon in general. The combination of the fish and cheese stuffed in, the dish was an obvious hit!
The Focaccia Mozzarella was not up to the mark.
For drinks, we had ordered a Homemade Lemonade, a Cranberry Lemonade and a Lemon Iced Tea.
Again, the Cranberry Lemonade is something I'd order anytime of the day. Superb!
For main course, we ordered an Al Funghi and a Bologna Pizza. Al Funghi was great. I personally do not prefer mutton so much, so the Bologna Pizza was okay for me.
For dessert we ordered the Wood-fired cioccolato fondente. This was again one of my favourites. Soft cake with a moderate crunch outside and warm liquid chocolate oozing out of the choco lava cake which was served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, finally adding up to my delightful experience at Alla Bella Mozzarella.

Visited this place for the first time......food was good but the only problem we had was the guy making the pizza had no gloves on and was putting non veg as well as the veg topping without cleaning his hand. I think for hygiene reasons too they should be having different gloves for veg and non veg.....

Care to stop by this cute Lil Italian delight, Sir? 
Well, it seems the joint says so. Standing humbly and silently a few minutes away from Mukti World, this place emanates "home".
The woody enchants, the fetching, calm decor and mostly the winsome sight of the stone oven, yes.
Nothing extensive to write since it was a just a pleasing 'checking-out' stop.
Had 'Lamb Lasagne', cooked exactly like it should be, though I felt it inclined towards a more tangy taste. 'Wood-fried ciccolato fondete' was as treat to the palate as it was to eyes, was as inviting as it could be.
Modern Classic Cafe. I don't know what will you call it, apart from the place calling you back.
Oh yeah, they play AMAZING music. One of very few such places that set the mood just right!

This is my 200th review and there is a story behind as to how we went about selecting this place.

Little Italy in the middle of Kolkata. True story.

Located in a very subdued residential area of Ballygunge. You would miss this place if you were not actually actively looking for it. The story started like this. My friend was craving for a cheese day and was being orgasmic over Mozzarella Bread sticks. When doing a google search for it, she found this place in one of the 1st few results and was like - Lets go there today. So by 8.30 PM, we were seated in this place. The place looked every bit like a italiano risorente. They had a wooden oven, visible to everyone. You could actually see your pizza being baked and cooked there. The place was a lil tiny with wooden tables and chairs. When we reach there, only 1 table was occupied. So we got ourselves a window seat. Not that great a view but nonetheless a window. Regarding the staff they were courteous and helped us with the venue. The Christmas festivities was still in the air as the meal towels were of red and green color. Moving to the music, they were playing like my present playlist and we were actually tapping our feet to it. The perfect setting one can ask for the 1st dinner outing of the year. 

Speaking of dinner, we ordered the following. Please do remember we were celebrating the self-proclaimed "International Cheese Day" that night.  So please forgive us if you don't approve of our choices.

1. Caesar Salad: She likes lettuce and the salad had cheese. Also, on the table, there was this container or whatever you want to call it which held 2 oils - Olive Oil and Vinegar.  Which when mixed with the salad gave itself a unique flavor.
 
2. Patate Fritte Mix Sauce:  Crispy potato wedges in mixed sauce, having olives and mushrooms. Find of the day for me! 

3. Quattro Formaggio Pizza: Basically 4 cheese pizza. We had discovered it in one of our earlier sojourns. And we swear by it now. The best part it was cooked on the oven in front of us. We could actually see the burnt base of the pizza. And the cheese was the best of its kind! 

4. Fettuccine Alfredo: We ordered a dish more and after the onslaught, we could not have had more. So we got this thing packed. The first few swirls that I have had of it was amazing! 

5. Wood Fried Choccolato Fondente: The Dessert of The Year. Molten chocolate, which was made in the wooden oven, served with ice cream.  I don't have a great sweet tooth but a few spoonful of it was kinda blissful. 

All this time we were enjoying the music, talking, laughing, etc. and as luck would have it, the place ran out of time and they had to inform us that they were closing down. We did have a great time and do plan to come back here, when they get the mozzarella sticks back, as it was the dish which brought us here but they were not serving it here anymore.

Though the food was good for the first time their service was extremely horrendous! We ordered a pizza from their website and recurve a confirmation mail but after inviting all our guests and keeping them waiting for an hour we finally called them to ask for our order and they behaved as if we talked in Latin and paid no heed to what we were saying. Their behaviour was extremely rough and I have never faced anything like this ever in the past. When we told them that this is not right in their part they said the website did not exist and they couldn't do anything. in fact our whole party was ruined because of them. Very BAD! extremely disappointed.

Ordered a chicken caesar salad today. Packing was good. It was supposed to be a chicken caesar salad but it had plenty of iceberg lettuce but namesake chicken. Not expected!!!! Taste was good but was disappointed by the quantity of chicken . 
Went ahead and ordered a Pollo Pizza.  Here again- great packing, great visual impact,  but disappointing pizza- bitter because of an overdose of basil and whole garlic. Even the Base was not upto the mark. 
Hardly had any chicken and cheese was not enough. 
Don't think will ever order again. Team needs to understand that just packing cannot compensate for lack of taste and very little of the key ingredient.

We came here Sunday night 18/12/2016 at around 8:30 PM. We ordered instantly for a Pizza and Lasagne. After 45 minutes we got our Lasagne which was not hot and the waiter smashed it while serving. We asked for salt which never came btw. Then after 15-20 minutes we followed up for the pizza. Music was very loud which made already inattentive waiters hard to call. All and all waste of a Sunday dinner.

Kolkata peeps, stay away from any form of home delivery from Alla Bella Mozzarella. Maybe the restaurant serves fresh food, but my experience with a pizza (ordered through Swiggy) last night almost landed my husband and myself in hospital. Started feeling queasy and nauseous almost immediately after consuming the pizza. We have been up all night with severe food poisoning. Truly an inconsistent establishment with double standards regarding food safety for the well-being of their customers, who they prefer to treat as morons. Bad bad bad! Unacceptable.

If one wants to experience the fine tastes of Italy in he city of joy, Alla Bella Mozzarella is the place to go. It is a fairly spaced restaurant with an amazing and quirky decor. The brick walls and the large woodfire oven add to the dining experience. Along  with a few friends, I had gone to this place last week. It is at ballygunge phaari and easy to locate. 

We ordered-

Ice tea- It was good, but could have been more flavourful.

Tre Formaggi Di Salmone- sound difficult though, but this was the show stealer! The tender salmon was generously filled with cheese. This is a must try.

Pollo Fritto- It consisted of crumb fried chicken and a dip. Presentation and taste was very good.

Focaccia Mozzarella- Freshly baked bread with aromatic rosemary. A very nice dish indeed.

Spaghetti Bolognese- We ordered the chicken one and the quantity was quite fulfilling. 

Pollo pizza- An amazing combination of smoked chicken, rosemary and spinach. pizza lovers should definitely try this one.

And to end with, Biscotti Al Ciocoolato- freshly baked cookie dough with belgian chocolate and ice cream. It was a very good combination as the chewy cookie went well with the vanilla ice cream.

The overall experience was wonderful. The staff is very efficient. Would definitely recommend this place to all the pizza lovers.

You want Italy on your plate with soothing ambience and comforting music playing in the background? Visit this place! Yes, as offbeat as the name goes, it serves delicious Italian cuisine with their innovation.

The interior is pleasing, comfortable and has a warmth in itself . Though a small room yet with the view of the live pizzas crusting in the huge wood fire oven, you'll get goosebumps.

Finally got the place ticked off my bucket list with Aagnik Ghosh 😌😁

We ordered for a lot of food!!

For starters we got a Salmon and three cheese bite size pieces cooked to perfection. This was my first try on salmon and I absolutely am trying it again.
A portion of crumbfried chicken with a star dip with a lovely garlic flavour.
Also a decent foccaccia bread with loads of cheese on it.
Accompanying the starters we had the House Lemonade, and Cranberry lemonade !

Turn for the Wood fire oven pizzas, we tried the vegetarian and non vegetarian type.
A mushroom and herbs pizza, and a chicken and rocket leaves pizza. Though I am not keen on rocket leaves, nonetheless it was a good try on them.

A Mutton Bolognese Spaghetti, just perfecto!
My hero dish! The perfect meat gravy and glossy spaghetti 😌

Now for desserts, since I am bad with names , it was a skillet cookie, warm and chewy drizzled generously with chocolate sauce and served with vanilla bean ice cream. The correct ending to a sumptuous meal ✔

If you want a piece of Italy in the city of joy
You should definitely visit this place.
A very good place for casual dining.

Coming to the décor  
The place is absolutely bellissimo (beautiful). The first thing that you will notice is the gigantic wood fire oven, and it's marvelous. Their kitchen is split into two segments. The front opening is with the wood fire  oven and you can see them making the pizzas in front of you. And all the other things takes place in the other segment.

The resto is light up with some dim lights and they play good music as well.

I visited this place with a friend Onooshka since we wanted to try out this place for a long long time, finally we did.
Mission accomplished. Yay!

We ordered…

For beverage

*Cranberry lemonade
*Homemade lemonade
And I liked how they serve the mocktails in those glass containers.

Food.

*Tre Formaggie Di Salmon - the dish was intricate! Fillets of salmon rolled with three cheese and served with a  cheese dip.

*Pollo Frito - crumb fried chicken served with a dip of truffle  mascarpone cream.  The dip was amazing. I@ licked my fingers quite a number of time. Hahah!

*Focaccia mozzarella - home made focaccia bread with mozzarella and garlic and tipped with rosemary

*Al Funghi Pizza - 12” pizza served with mozzarella and roasted  mushroom. And the wood fire add up the flavour.

*Pollo pizza - this one was my favourite, such a mixture of flavours. Smoked chicken, rosemary, spinach, caramelised onion and roasted garlic.

*Spaghetti Bolognese - this one lip smacking awesome. I just loved it and those minced lamb, aah!

For Dessert we order,
Biscotto Al cioccolato - fresh baked cookie dough served in a cast iron pan with some vanilla ice cream.

The service was absolutely good, and they guided us with e orders.

Will come back soon.

"Alla Bella Mozzarella" is an Italian restaurant serving some excellant dishes with wonderful ambience. The resto is in 6th Ballygunje Road. It is a beautiful small cottage type restautant. The interior's are beautifully decorated with warm dim light's covering the entire ceiling. Chair's & table's are solid and comfortable. This was my first time i visited this place with a friend. We actually didn't knew about the place. One of my friend recommended us to visit there. And trust me it was worth spending money on quality food they served..it was marvellous!
Am not a big fan of Italian foods but this place completely changed my mind! First we had "Ice Tea" for refreshment. It was good.
For the starter's we ordered "Tre Formaggi Di Salmoni" it was our first time we ate the fish salmon. I can't express how i felt when i had the first bite. It was beyond excellance! You won't bilieve until & unless you try the dish!
Then we had "Pollo fritto and Foccacia" they were good too. Main course we had "Pollo Pizza" & " Pollo Spaghetti". The pizza's were soft, well cooked, juicy with cheese and for the non-veg eater's full of chicken. Spaghetti was also nice and creamy.
Lastly we had a wonderful desert.
This one my favourite. "Biscotto Al Cioccolate" choco cookies with hot chocolate served with Vanilla ice cream. It was heaven!
I had a great evening with great food! If your looking for an Italian Resto you must try this out! :)

It was our anniversary, and we decided to try something new and settled down for Italian. We shortlisted this place after going through the reviews on Zomato.
The place is in the opposite lane of 6th Ballygunge place. It's a minute's walk from there. The restaurant is perfectly decorated and reminded me of those old Hollywood films. The music played was Italian and with the food, it felt like Venice. It's a small place so no unwanted noise was there and I enjoyed my meal in peace. 
Now coming to the food, for someone like me who does not know anything about the cuisine but the pizza, it was awakening time. We went for Ice tea, and it was cutely packed. 
Then for the starters we had Pollo fritto and Tre Formaggi di Salmoni. The fritto was alright, but the salmone was great. I had salmon for the first time, and am thankful to the steward for suggesting the dish. The Foccacia was perfect too.
For the main course we had Pollo Spaghetti and have nothing much to say as am a 'rice guy' more. 
Now you come to a Italian resto and not have pizza, your up for hell, and I don't want to die in the first place. So we had the Pollo pizza, and it was the best I had. 
And lastly, to satisfy my sweet tooth we had the Biscotto Al cioccolato, and it was divine.
Something I dint like about the place? If I had too be overtly critical, it would be that, why I did not discover it before. 
Had a lovely evening and am looking forward to visit again.

For your next dinner date head straight to Alla Bella Mozerella. It's a cosy little place with warm lighting on a quiet lane opp 6 Ballygunge Place. The decor is minimalistic  with cute pieces that hold your attention. But what makes the dinner date perfect is the food - fresh, warm, tasty with some interesting innovative items on the menu.The food is filled with the right flavours, not overtly cheesy and the portions are just right. 
We sipped the cranberry lemonade - refreshing and sweetish while we debated our choices before placing the order.
Antipasti - Cheese stuffed salmon - A little less cheesy and more fishy,  a nice starter if you are in the mood for some salmon
Pizza A La Corleone - Bacon, zuchhhini, spinach and roasted garlic . The wood fired, thin crust, whole wheat pizza had a really interesting combination of flavours. Made right in front of you and served into your plate right from the oven, the pizzas are supremely satisfying
Spaghetti Di Pollo - Garlic butter and minced chicken - Tasty, creamy and garlicky
Fetucinne Carbonara - Wow! Eggs, parsley, bacon and cheesy! 

What they could do better? 
What they need to work on a bit is the salt content; we found everything a bit too salty for our liking.
The other of course is a request to add a non-veg risotto since all the 3 on the menu are veg. We really missed it!
Until the next dinner date comes around, i will cherish the flavours of the mozzarella!

This place is a hidden gem in terms of pastas and pizzas . Do try the linguine with the truffle oil and the  bacon carbonara pasta . The pizzas are really good too and so is the capsicum soup . What I didn't like however was the Caesar salad . The  dressing and the contents are not at par with some of the contemporary restaurants.

Spaghetti Di Pollo was lovely. Really enjoyed it's flavours. Pepperoni pizza was okay types. Toppings should've been more for the price. Also the cheese was little overcooked smelled like ghee(I don't that smell). Would like to try lasagne and Risotto if there's a next time.

Price is on the higher side but quantity is decent.

Décor is nice.

Overall it's a nice dining experience.

How can I not love the cuisine which is responsible for introducing Potatoes, Tomatoes and Bell peppers to us and naturally when my blogger friend Dolon asked me to join her at  Alla Bella Mozzarella which is a Kolkata based Italian food joint I gladly accepted. Apart from Dolon, Poorna was also there along with Pooja and Kinkini so you can imagine how perfect the Italian luncheon  was on a Sunday with my blogger friends.

Alla bella mozzarella is a new restaurant in the vicinity promising to serve up some authentic Italian cuisine. 

We ordered a mozzarella pizza and an aglio olio pepperocino. The aglio olio had too much oil according to me, aglio olio is made in oil but here they had drowned it in oil quite literally. The pizza on the other hand was very nice and also tasty. Can't comment about the service and ambience as the food was home delivered. Will update the review next time I go there!

Done with the festive mood?Got your weekdays mundane?

Here's a one stop remedy for any time meal for yourself or your friends or family folks!...Alla Bella Mozarella , just  as the name sounds quirky, the place is also  quite warm and cozy and can make you feel comfortable for any meals be it lunch, dinner or brunch scenes too rather.

This place is located near Ballygunge Phari and the interiors of the place is tooo cute and warm.

I love Italian cuisines restaurants and specially the ones which serve you wood fired pizzas...Yeah!This place has excellent  wood fire pizzas where the cheese would simply just melt in your mouth.

This restaurant has amazing music and the interiors of the place is quite unique and attractive.The well made bricked walls, the well located barrels, the wooden tables and the live wood fire pizza maker simply adds on to the  ambience.There's a live kitchen area where you can see whats being made for you in a very neat and organised way.The food is decently priced and the quantity is also good

our order was quite small and simple unlike other times as it was brunch scene with my bestie and two of us were more keen to try the special dishes only basically!

The waiter suggested us to try the signature pizza and the very famous pomodro sphagetti and we like obedient customers, blindly ordered for it and were thoroughly satisfied.The dishes were just fabulous.

The Pizza Al Alla Bella was the signature dish was excellent in taste.the toppings added on superbly to  the taste and was very crisp  and yummy.A must try for all the pizza lovers!

Our next order was spaghetti Pomodro which was another crazy dish well topped with basil leaves and freshly chopped tomatoes.The taste was simply delicious and was well cooked and tossed with pomodro cheese.

Wata delight the dishes were!

I wish I could try for more , but was too full and as it was just the two of us, we were less inclined to go for any further order as deserts were just waiting our way...

No meal is over without some melting deserts, and no Italian mean is over without some yummy molten cakes...Yayyyy!! So, We ordered for Wood fired cioccolate fondente which was another in house speciality.Its basically molten lava kinds cake baked in the wood fired oven which is centre filled wit oozing chocolate truffle sauce which is simply toothsome.You won't stop finger-licking the sauce.Its sooo sooo chocolaty and yummy.

It was a perfect end to the meal .
So this was a short and sweet brunch scene in a nice and warm place .

All the Italian food lovers, should visit this place and try out the delicacies here...!
Have a look at what we ordered for..

Walking into this cosy restaurant in Ballygunge is like stepping into a nice little trattoria away from all the hustle and bustle. Patrons are welcomed by Italian melodies and the soft lighting as well as the warm service staff which adds to the comfort. There are many dishes on offer One of the main draws of this restaurant is the wood-fired oven, an age-old method of cooking. Some of the dishes, such as the pizzas are baked in it. The Arrostito Peperone is a capsicum and parmesan cheese zuppa and a must-try in this restaurant. The Spaghetti Bolognese and Penne Arrabiatta were our favourites among the pastas. The Spaghetti Bolognese is divine with perfectly cooked spaghetti with melting-in-your-mouth meat ragu. The Penne Arrabiata had a lovely mix of flavours as well.
Their pizzas are thin crust and the wood-oven gives them a nice rustic flavour, even lifting the taste.The Quattro Formaggio is a four-cheese vegetarian pizza which is delicious without being heavy. Among the non-vegetarian pizzas, we had the Pollo, a yummy chicken pizza.
The Pollo Di Mascarpone will keep giving you cravings! Yummy, grilled chicken with a cream cheese fondue is a perfect meal in itself. Dessert is of course, always our favourite part! The Cioccolato Fondente has a nice crumbly crust with a melting centre. It's like digging into a volcano! It comes with a side of vanilla icecream which takes you to heaven!

After eating here for 3+ times, i have to say this place is about to be dead. 3 months has been since the washroom was promised that it'll be fixed but still is not functional. They had 5+ vegetarian starters which is cut down to 1 and even after repeated feedback hasn't been reinstated. Today everyone in the place was furious with the people cause each and every dish was stale and still they charged for the food. I'm never coming back here again and i would recommend you to stay 1 mile way.

🍕🍕This is a fairly new Italian joint in Ballygunge Place which has bagged some good reviews.. Their speciality is the wood fire oven they make their pizzas in.. Being quite excited about that fact, i decided to visit this place. The decor is quite rustic yet cozy which i liked.. we ordered a Bella Italia which is basically a ham and mushroom pizza. It took them over half an hour to make this single pizza. The pizza was quite good.. Service was disappointing and they charge a total of 25% tax...

Went to this place after hearing a lot of good things from my friends about it. I can say that I was not disappointed. The place, though not very big, was pretty cozy and ambient and it being just across the road from my house is an added advantage. The food is very good. We ordered the three cheese stuffed salmon, which was by far the best salmon i ever had, a pasta, which was nice as well and lasagne, which were cooked to perfection. Overall I'd say that this place is worth the money. Would highly recommend.

Went with a lot of expectations. Nice cozy ambience in the bylanes of Ballygunge place. Have a good range of dishes to choose from. Had ordered a veg lasagne with zucchini and spinach, which was good, and ordered carbonara with bacon, which was a bit disappointing. The quality of Bacon served was not great and the dish missed the flavour of cheese. Overall the food was satisfactory .

Well, there are so many places where you would get multiple cuisines, but Alla Bella Mozzarella is not one of those. These place deals in only authentic Italian cuisines and nails it in every department. Well, before starting with the review I must say, I just loved the name, its catchy and its fun to say. Went to this place few days back with some of my friends to try something new and I found this place to be apt.

Location: As you come from Ballygunge Phari towards Gariahat you have to just move towards your left and you will find your place. Follow your Zomato Map, it will be easier.

Service: The service was great. The staffs were courteous and polite. They took a bit of time but the wait was worth.

Food:

# Caesar Salad : Smocked Chicken, Lettuce with capers, croutons and parmigiano. The dressing was just too good. The ingredients were very fresh. The only suggestion from my side would be to cut the lettuce little smaller in size.

# Pollo Frito: The crumb fried Chicken was really crispy from the exterior and juicy inside. The truffle mascarpone dip was hit along with the chicken.

# Tre Formaggi Di Salmone: Well, one of the best salmone I had. It was so soft and juicy, it melted as it went inside the mouth. I can still dream of the cheese melting down.

#Fettuccine Carbonara: The pasta was a hit again. The bacon doing the trick for me as I am a big bacon lover.

# Pollo Pizza - The thin crust pizza with smoked chicken, spinach, caramelised onions, garlic and a hint of rosemary. It was good but surely not the best of the evening.

#Lasagne: The classic lamb meat lasagne was always an attraction for me. The tangy cheesy taste was too good for me to have it over and over again.

#Pollo Parmigiana: Parmesan Crusted Chicken accompanied with Spaghetti. It would have been a loss if I wouldnt have ordered this. Still drooling when I am thinking about it.

#Wood Fired Cioccolato Fondente: The molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice-cream is one of the signature dishes of the place and you can imagine how good it can be. If you are here, you cant miss this to complete your meal.

Last Words:
One of the best places to have authentic Italian cuisines in the City of Joy. If you are craving to have something different and out of the regular dishes, this place will impress you for sure.

4/5 for this place.

Are you a cheesy person? Are you a cheese lover? Do you melt when you see the ooeygooey melty cheese coated food? If you have said yes to any one of the above questions then you just HAVE to drop by to this place! Even if your answers are no to the question just go there once and thank me later. B-) Situated at the bang opposite lane of 6 Ballygunj Place, one can find the place very easily.

I visited this place after following reviews of many on zomato. However, I felt more of disappointed with the place. The ambience is good, with good interiors, well behaved staff and good music. 
But the food was just average. We ordered mix sauce pasta and Alla Bella Pizza. Pasta was good. But the pizza was absolute waste of money. We could not even complete the entire pizza. 
The place is average, but given the price, not worth a visit.

I feel so amazed when I see that so many new places are coming up in my school neighbourhood. It feels like these places are blooming in my own locality only!
Came to this place a few days back with some of my friends for a reunion. The experience was fantastic. Loved the place from starting till the end, every bit of it.
Pollo Fritto - Crumb fried chicken served with truffle mascarpone. This dish was an absolute hit. Loved the dip along with.
Tre Fromaggi Di Salmone - I have never had such good salmon before. It's so fresh. Salmon rolls along with three types of cheese, it tasted brilliant.
Fettuccine Carbonara - If you follow my writings regularly, you would have known by now how I crave for bacon. Fettuccine in white sauce along with bacon and egg, I am still dreaming of it.
Pizza - Forgot the name. It had smoked chicken, onions and roasted garlic with hints of rosemary. The aroma was a bit unusual but tasted pretty good.
Lasagne - This was the traditional lamb meat lasagne. If it was your first time, you will love it as many of my friends did. I think the cheesy part could have been a little more.
Wood fired cioccolato fondente - Ah! I can write a 1000 words about this only. Honestly, the best lava cake I have had till date. The chocolate sauces oozed out like a fountain and it tasted divine with the vanilla ice cream. The brownie was crumbly outside and very soft to chew. 
Drinks - 
Cranberry Cooler
Lemonade
Would prefer the cranberry one anytime. Lemonade needs a little betterment. But the presentation of drinks in glass bottles is really something unique.
As they make everything afresh in the oven, it is important to note that you must have enough of time because every cooking takes a lot of time. Service is really good. Loved the ambience, open face brick walls. fancy old school Italian music creating the mood. Recommended to try. Visit and don't miss the brownie anyhow. Happy Dining! :)

Oh...how my heart melted when the cheese melted in my mouth and how it missed a beat when the pizza sighed in the oven!!
I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this place. The place charmed me with it's decor, music , service and the most important factor, the food.
The Caesar's salad was perfectly prepared with fresh slices of smoked chicken .
The smoked Salmon was out of the world with perfectly prepared fish oozing with fresh gooey cheese.This is a must have if you are visiting this place
In main course the "Fettuccine Carbonara" was the pasta cooked to perfection.
The pizza, thin crusted , @topped with chicken, spices,herbs and caramelized onion was a total delight .
Pollo parmigiana was impressive with perfectly crusted chicken topped with parmesan , accompanied with spaghetti.
The dessert literally will melt yr heart. We had their signature dessert comprising of molten chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream. 
This it was an affair with food whose memory lingers in yr heart urging you to visit thr place again and again

After long time I went for outing with friends and I think this is one of the best till date amongst all the places I visited. It was a small restaurant in Ballyganj place with impressive decor giving strong Italian vibes with equally awesome italian music . We ordered Pollo pizza, Nonveg Lasagna and Chocolate fondant .
And the Pizza was so mind boggling that I was speechless.Though I didn't try all the authentic pizza places in Kolkata, I still can say it is one of them .
The final touch was the dessert. The oozing hot , liquid chocolate coming out of the fondant along with the vanilla ice cream was simply divine .
The price was somewhat too much because it included the service charge.
Otherwise I am very happy with the restaurant.

If you wish to have a great dining experience and make your date/friends/family thank you for a wonderful treat...please do visit Alla Bella Mozzarella.

3 - 4 minutes walk from Ballygunge Phari, this place has a decently done entrance, interior is not too big but is warm and classy.

We ordered Lemon Ice Tea, Cranberry Lemonade and Regular Lemonade.
Unlike most restaurants, the drinks came in small glass bottles with perfect proportion of ice, thereby not making them too watery.
While the Cranberry one smelled a bit like syrup, it was fresh and refreshing nevertheless.
The Regular Lemonade was decent too. Perfectly made to quench your thirst.
And now the winner! Tea lovers, please do not miss the Lemon Ice Tea. I am sure you will re order it :)

Next we had
Caesar - smoked chicken, iceburg lettuce, capers, croutons and parmigiano : Creamy chicken with the perfect mix of condiments on a bed of iceburg lettuce. Even if you hate to spend on salads in restaurants (like me), still I would insist you order this one. You will love it!

Pollo fritto : Crumb fried chicken served with truffle mascarpone. Crispy outside, succulent inside...served with dip, this dish too deserves a thumbs up.

Tre formaggi Di Salmone : Basically cheese stuffed Salmon. To be honest, I've never had a better salmon dish before. We re-ordered it, unless you are too full, I bet you will do the same.

Fettuccine Carbonara : Pasta with eggs, parsley, bacon and parmigiano. Rich and creamy, this dish was cooked to perfection. Loved it.

Pizza : Made with smoked chicken, rosemary, spinach, caramelised onions and roasted garlic. This was the only dish that disappointed me a little. Tasted decent but the amount of toppings could have been more generous.

Lasagne : A traditional lamb meat one. Creamy, smooth and a subtle meat flavour...this was one of the best dishes we tried.

Pollo Parmigiana : Parmesan crusted chicken accompanied with spaghetti. While I felt the spaghetti could have been little more spicy...the delicious parmesan crusted chicken compensated for it.

Next we ordered their signature molten chocolate cake served with vanilla bean ice cream. All I can say is that...Good ending to the perfect meal.

Service : Great. You will find nothing to complain about.

Portion: Sufficient. Price: Little on the higher side.

Absolutely Recommended. Visit at the earliest. Thank me later!

This place was bookmarked by us since it opened and atlast today we got a chance to visit this place.Its a small restaurant with countryside looks that only serves italian cuisines.The place is a complete delight as they are one of the few Italian restaurants where you will find most dishes made out of "Wood fired oven".Though its a small place but is very well decorated with space very well utilized.Now coming to the basics-

Service-The food service was quite good and the staff was also trained very well with the dishes but they were quite unresponsive to customers.Like after finishing our food we have to ask them about 3-4 times for our bill.

Ambiance-We were quite dazzled with the ambiance at this place.The whole place is equipped with rustic themed elements such as a postbox,barrels,dimlighting and patchy brick walls.Most of the food is cooked infront in a wood fired oven which is just placed where the dining area ends, separated by a glass.And at last for this section,the music played goes very well with the place and feels soothing.

Food-The food at this place was extremely good.Starting of with the mocktails we had-

1:Cranberry Lemonade-This drink was extremely refreshing with a mixture of sweet and sour taste and is highly recommended

2:Focaccia Mozarella-This whole thing was made with focaccia bread that comes with a filling of garlic and melted cheese.

3:Penne Arrabbiata-It was the best tomato sauce pasta we ever had and is worth trying.

4:Wood-fired Cioccolato fondente-This dessert was a sort of molten lava cake that comes with vanilla icecream and believe us that the chocolate that oozes out of the fondente extremely pleasant to eyes.

Food-4.5/5

Location : Just walk down the lane opposite to 6 Ballygunge place, you'll find this place to your left.

Ambience/Decor : The first thing that you'll notice is the giant wood fire oven. They have a sort of an open kitchen where the pizzas are made in front of your eyes. The place is beautifully lit with downlighters and the dim yellow light gives overall a calm vibe to the place.

Beverages:

I loved the way the mocktails were served in those glass bottles. Brownie points for using black straws as well!

* Lemonade : Nice and refreshing.

* Cranberry lemonade : Very nice. Sort of syrupy. Mixture of sweet and sour.

* Lemon iced tea : Very refreshing. It had bags of tea flavour in it.

Food:

* Caesar salad : The portion of the salad was very generous. Smoked chicken(cut into strips), iceburg lettuce, capers, croutons tossed with a yum dressing and topped with parmesan cheese was served! I loved the dressing, the chicken and the dressing was appropriate.

*Pollo fritto : I loved this one. Crumb fried chicken served with a dip of trufle mascarpone. The cheese dip was amazing. The chicken fritters were super light and crunchy. 

*Tre formaggi Di Salmone : This dish was exquisite! Fillets of salmon fish rolled around a mixture of three cheeses are grilled and served with the same cheesy dip. I loved every bit of it. The fish was fresh and full of flavour.

*Fettuccine Carbonara : This pasta dish was absolutely yummy and cheesy! The pasta is tossed with eggs, parsley, bacon and parmigiano cheese and served. I loved the quality of bacon used and the cheese was exquisite.

*Pollo pizza(12") : This pizza was made in front of us in the wood fire oven. Smoked chicken, rosemerry, spinach, caramelised onions and roasted garlic are the toppings. The pizza was pretty good.

*Lasagne : Who doesn't love lasagne? The pasta sheets beaitifull, the lamb ragu was very tasty and the cheeey bechamel sauce was exquisite!

*Pollo parmigiana : I Loved this dish! Parmesan crusted chciken(Crumb fried) and served with spaghetti, the cheesy dip and some sort of tomato Salsa. The spaghetti was silky and cooked 'al dente'. The chciken was exquisite.

* Wood-fired ciocolato fondente : This dessert was made in front of us in the wood fire oven. The chocolate fondant was sooo delicious. Perfectly chocolatey and gooey in the middle. Went very well with vanilla ice cream served.

Service: staff was very courteous and polite and met our every need!

The name n the menu make u wanna check out the restaurant,but my suggestion would be if ur a absolute Italian food lover this is not the place to go , what people don't understand is just by having a fancy name and even fancier menu ,it does not make it a good Italian restaurant. One of my worst experience , funny part the staff had no idea about the menu or even the details about the food preparations ,agree there aren't the chef but the basics at least should be known ,the only reason they get 2.0 is coz of the ambience and music but unfortunately that's not what makes a restaurant run ,the kid who is taking orders expect his perfect spoken English sadly have no clue about the menu what are the preparations , by the way u will never find quite a few drinks never available there and I assure u the white sauce pasta tastes like Maggie wala pasta ,well my best wishes to alla bella mozzarella for getting better in the near future .
I did forget to mention incase u order a pizza just inform them that u would not like it burnt.

Monsieur and madame, sitting down inside, what you’d call an Italiano ristorante, you might ponder upon the thought “why always pizzas or pastas?”. Allow me to tell you that all your thinking ends here. The inception of Alla Bella Mozzarella caused Kolkata to have one more stop for an authentic Italian restaurant.

Ambience/Decor : The first thing that you'll notice is the giant wood fire oven. They have a sort of an open kitchen where the pizzas are made in front of your eyes. The place is beautifully lit with downlighters and the dim yellow light gives overall a calm vibe to the place.

Beverages:

I loved the way the mocktails were served in those glass bottles. Brownie points for using black straws as well!

* Lemonade : Nice and refreshing.

* Cranberry lemonade : Very nice. Sort of syrupy. Mixture of sweet and sour.

* Lemon iced tea : Very refreshing. It had bags of tea flavour in it.

Food:

* Caesar salad : The portion of the salad was very generous. Smoked chicken(cut into strips), iceburg lettuce, capers, croutons tossed with a yum dressing and topped with parmesan cheese was served! I loved the dressing, the chicken and the dressing was appropriate.

*Pollo fritto : I loved this one. Crumb fried chicken served with a dip of trufle mascarpone. The cheese dip was amazing. The chicken fritters were super light and crunchy. 

*Tre formaggi Di Salmone : This dish was exquisite! Fillets of salmon fish rolled around a mixture of three cheeses are grilled and served with the same cheesy dip. I loved every bit of it. The fish was fresh and full of flavour.

*Fettuccine Carbonara : This pasta dish was absolutely yummy and cheesy! The pasta is tossed with eggs, parsley, bacon and parmigiano cheese and served. I loved the quality of bacon used and the cheese was exquisite.

*Pollo pizza(12") : This pizza was made in front of us in the wood fire oven. Smoked chicken, rosemerry, spinach, caramelised onions and roasted garlic are the toppings. The pizza was pretty good.

*Lasagne : Who doesn't love lasagne? The pasta sheets beaitifull, the lamb ragu was very tasty and the cheeey bechamel sauce was exquisite!

*Pollo parmigiana : I Loved this dish! Parmesan crusted chciken(Crumb fried) and served with spaghetti, the cheesy dip and some sort of tomato Salsa. The spaghetti was silky and cooked 'al dente'. The chciken was exquisite.

* Wood-fired ciocolato fondente : This dessert was made in front of us in the wood fire oven. The chocolate fondant was sooo delicious. Perfectly chocolatey and gooey in the middle. Went very well with vanilla ice cream served.

Service: staff was very courteous and polite and met our every need!

The name n the menu make u wanna check out the restaurant,but my suggestion would be if ur a absolute Italian food lover this is not the place to go , what people don't understand is just by having a fancy name and even fancier menu ,it does not make it a good Italian restaurant. One of my worst experience , funny part the staff had no idea about the menu or even the details about the food preparations ,agree there aren't the chef but the basics at least should be known ,the only reason they get 2.0 is coz of the ambience and music but unfortunately that's not what makes a restaurant run ,the kid who is taking orders expect his perfect spoken English sadly have no clue about the menu what are the preparations , by the way u will never find quite a few drinks never available there and I assure u the white sauce pasta tastes like Maggie wala pasta ,well my best wishes to alla bella mozzarella for getting better in the near future .
I did forget to mention incase u order a pizza just inform them that u would not like it burnt.

Monsieur and madame, sitting down inside, what you’d call an Italiano ristorante, you might ponder upon the thought “why always pizzas or pastas?”. Allow me to tell you that all your thinking ends here. The inception of Alla Bella Mozzarella caused Kolkata to have one more stop for an authentic Italian restaurant.

Pizzas are the food for the soul and Alla Bella makes them very well. I had heard a lot of mixed reviews about this place but my person experience was great.
We ordered a spaghetti in pesto sauce which was yum. The asparagus risotto was the silent hero of the meal. And the pizzas were great too. We tried fungi and their special pizza. The only weird thing was that 

they put corn on the fungi pizza which was sad.
The service was quite slow though. We had to wait for 15 minutes for someone to take our order. It seemed like only one person was managing all the tables. They didn't have any drinks except canned ones. Not even lemonade!
But the food was great and that's why they've gotten a 3.5! 

Visited again after a few days. The service was much better this time. We tried the aglio oglio and the ariabiatta pasta. They were both fantastic. The pizza was also amazing that day. Really looking forward to going again!

Absolutely phenomenal place nestled in the quiet bylanes of Ballygunge. It's one of the few places where you can truly be at peace (no honking, beautiful + tiny place - 30 seater). 
I was certain that no place in the city would have pizza as good as the one they serve at

The place is not as cool as the name suggests. Location was not tough to find since I m a South Pointer. The location is quite and serene as well as the restaurant plus the music, ambience & staff dress code were all giving me the feeling as if I m having food in Italy. Seeing their open wood burn brick set was giving a good feeling.
All 3 items we ordered La Picante pizza Veg Lasagne and Spaghetti Arrabiata were edible and OK.
Done with the pros now the cons :
The seating arrangement is bit compact and crammed up not typical of an Italian restaurant. The worst part we had to pick our plates for all the 3 items served to us (me and my wife at the corner in a group of 5). I hated that most.
There were only 2 staff for orders serving cleaning etc on a seat capacity of 30 so we had to wait to order though the food was served well in time. The staff were mute.
The quantity were less compared to price for me and very few options in the menu.
Leaving I was wondering that Corner courtyard Cafe mezzuna Hakuna matata would have been a better option at the same price or less. Go at last if u really want to try a new place.

Your wait for the next best Italian trattoria ends with the sumptuous fare that Alla Bella Mozzarella offers.Nestled in a not-so-busy lane of posh Ballygunge place, it is a small but cosy Italian eatery that offers much more in terms of service and value for food.Greeted at the door and seated quickly. Excellent start with the perfectly seasoned and balanced in flavour Arrostito Peperone soup (roasted red bell pepper soup) . The Anti pasti selection and focaccia mozzarella for us was a bit bland but it was quickly replaced by the rich, meaty and luscious spaghetti Bolognese in a traditional lamb sauce. The Pizza's are not really that great to write home about but the creamy risotto al funghi and smoked pollo di mascarpone make up for most of it . The star of the evening was the decadent  cioccolato fondente -their signature molten chocolate cake baked in their wood fired oven. It's supremely unmissable! The chocolate oozing out has just the right amount of sweetness to captivate your taste buds...until next time, Ciao!

approximate cost for two : INR 1000

The place is a tiny lil hub for diggers of italian cuisine and the ones in eternal search for new places. The oven infront makes it quite a view to watch batches of pizza bread being embellished with toppings and waiting fir their turn to for a heated makeover inside it. The Bologna Pizza, Spaghetti Bolognese and Caeser Salad with smoked chicken were concocted good enough to compliment the food! The service is crisp just like the pizza crust. Ambiance is more like peppy cafe. A good experience in Ballygunge!

I've never been to Italy. Sure, I have heard about it from friends who have visited the land of Pizza but personally, I have minimal exposure to Italian culture. Whatever cognizance my mind has about this beautiful country is all because of its splendid cuisine and obviously, football.

 Speaking of Italian Cuisine, I have always found it extremely creamy that I adore, full of natural flavours, and exotic ingredients. But then, my knowledge of Italian cuisine is limited to the menu of various Indian restaurants. I didn't have a benchmark to test these Italian dishes against. Now, I think I do. 

Alla Bella Mozzarella is THE Italian place in town. I strolled in here engrossed in Nietzsche's "Beyond Good and Evil" and found the place not just beyond good, but exceeding expectations. Brilliant interior decor, delectable and gratifying food, incredible service, you name it and this place has it. 

My server for the afternoon was Varun and he guided me throughout the dish selection process. It was his effort and recommendation that made the experience such a satisfying one. Thank you, Sir.

I ordered a Cranberry Lemonade, a Mozzarella Focaccia, a Fettuccine Carbonara, and Wood-fired Cioccolato fondente. 

The combination of the tangy lemonade and the slightly lactic taste of the Focaccia was unreal. Very smooth texture and the lemonade kept on throwing surprises at me. At one moment it was sweet and in the next, it was all tart and zesty. Highly recommended.

The Pasta was very well done and I wouldn't hesitate to call it the best Pasta I have had in Kolkata thus far. Brownie points for the smoky feel of the bacon. Added amazing layers of taste to it. The wood-fired Cioccolato Fondente  is arguably among my three best desserts of all time. 

The place is actually not very large and people might have to wait to get a table. However, the wait is totally worth it. The ambience reminds you of those street Italian cafes playing Canzoni Italiane on a loop. The service is impeccable and deserves a special mention. If you haven't visited this one yet, don't waste any more time and drop in for some Autentica Cucina Italiana.

Although the place is bit small and you might have to wait for a table. But still the pizzas and the pasta is different, amazing, thin , cheesy, and awesome. It's just one of the best pizza I had tonight. You also get to have a peek of the special oven in which they prepare the pizza. 
Have a great day.

It is a rare sight in Kolkata, to find a restaurant which serves a singular cuisine. Alla Bella Mozzarella has been modelled as a signature European café, serving an internationally acclaimed cuisine in the traditional way. Whenever we talk about the Italian cuisine, we tend to refer to just a pasta or pizza – when instead there is so much more than these stereotype dishes. ABM brings to you exactly those items which come straight from the authentic Italian dining scene.

ABM is located in a tiny lane just off Ballygunge Phari. You might have to do a bit of searching, but then this place is no less than diamond in a coal mine. The restaurant has an incredible façade which just adds to the positive vibes this place emits. Once you step inside, European theme hits you with an amplified magnitude. Classic and rugged décor, set in a dimmed lighting, is what greets you. The raw brick wall texture, bright yellow bulbs and vintage lamps are also aptly suited to the motif. Speaking of classic style and authenticity, the place has an open wood-fired oven setup. Now there’s something you don’t see every day.

Talking about the service, which was impeccable, there are no less words of appreciation. The head server, Mr Gabriel, managed the whereabouts pretty well.

So folks that was about it from Alla Bella Mozzarella.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Not exactly located in any prime location, this place is somewhere little deep inside a lane (close to Choudhary House).

The moment I entered, there was this difference decor and ambience, pretty much the english style (4/5 for the ambience).
Limited menu, average taste of Pizza, more than average pricing and no music lands this place with a thumbs down on my first experience.

P.S. Areas to be worked upon mentioned^

Alla Bella Mozzarella.. Lot of people will be just take the name like any other but if you talk about a person like me then i was very curious to know about the meaning of this name. Its is "The Beautiful Cheese" and when we talk about cheese then Italian food will always going to strike down your head. Very less places in the city we have who serves some very fine authentic Italian dishes but if you are missing out of those Italian Cravings then you gotta come check this place out to fulfill your wish for sogno italiano. LOcated at Ballygunge Phari opposite way to the newly made banquet 6 Ballygunge place.

From the outer look to the inside it all gives you a feel of little Italy in Kolkata. Rather than the food the ambiance is also a factor to look out with its complete Italian attire towards the sitting, tables, chairs, lights, dim lamps and walls for sure. The entire ambiance is so classy to be worth describing and when i talk about the service so it is just one of a kind. Being led by Mr. Gabriel on the service part that day when i went there. And he done some commendable job to provide us what we actually look for while we dine in somewhere.

Took the seats and started the evening with some colorful and delightful Mocktails. 

1. Cranberry Lemonade - Served in a huge glass bottle, to be mention you have to mix the entire drink with the straw to get the fullest of the fizziness and unbelievable taste. A perfect drink to start the evening just refreshed the entire fatigue.

2. Homemade Lemonade - This was the second drink of the evening which came to the table and not less than the first one we had. Served on the same bottle and being looked very nice with a big small cut piece of lemon inside.

3. Lemon Ice Tea - A very decent ice tea. Worth ordering once.

Later we had one the table some astonishing Zuppa aka soups in forms of

1. Arrostito Peperone - This was the roasted bell pepper soup which carried good amount of thickness and flavourful taste which just banged in.

2. Zuppa Di Funghi - Second soup just stole the show. This was a Mushroom based soup with parmigiano. I am not a Mushroom lover but this did a fair job and made me interested.

Being done with the Liquid part we were all hungry for some perfect Authentic Italian and craving hard from our stomach and it was time when we were ready to have it.

1. Caprese - Started of well with the presentation of dish. Being served with Pesto dip the salad contained bocconcini, tomatoes(that wasused for the base, basil leaves and oilve oil with the the inhouse bread.

2. Focaccia Mozzarella - Homemade focaccia bread traingle in shape with rosemary and Mozzarella(Cheese) inside but the quantity was lesser than i expected it to be. 

3. Spaghetti Bolonese - This was my personal favorite for the evening. Keema being throned over the spaghethi and looked royal and being topped with basil leave. Going extremely deadly together and the amount was truly justified.

4. Penne Pesto - The greeny affair. Made with the green basil sauce and mixed really well to give a proper flavor of the dish. 

5. Pizza Al Alla Bella - First large pizza dropped on the table and it was veg one. topped with tomatoes, black olives, fresh onions and bocconcini. Size was perfect and had a soft chew with it but the crust at the end was a bit hard.

6. Pollo Chicken Pizza - The second pizza on the table but this time it was the Non veg one. Contained smoked chicken, caramalised onion which was just wow to taste, rosemary, spinach and roasted garlic which enhanced the taste to double.

7. Pollo Di Mascarpone - A very simple looking dish but with the aunthencity on the plate to fulfill the palette. Grilled cut Chicken was with a mascarpone cheese fonde to be dipped over them and to make some impact.

8. wood-fired cloccolato fondente - I was just imagining why it is their signature ? Until it came on the table we had a look at it to believe it. It was the molten chocolate cake baked in the wood fire oven which we mainly find in Italty. Oh lord this was just a stellar with the Vanilla ice cream.

Loved the ambiance and service and the food was spot on to the expectations. Atleast we have now a place to have some real Italian flavor on the cards. Recommended place.

This place has been on my list for a long time. I chanced upon the opportunity to visit this place yesterday. Tucked away in the lanes of Ballygunge, the restaurant is a sheer delight!
The name depicts an Italian place, and this place IS your one stop solution for Italian food. Most of the items are oven made, and served piping hot. The open brick wood oven is the USP of the place. 
Our server for the evening, Gabriel was a delight to talk to! He is jolly, vigilant, and helpful.

We tried the following:

**Drinks** 
- Cranberry Lemonade - Lemonade never tasted better. Perfect drink for the evening. I was only used to the cranberry breezer before I tried this. 

- Lemonade - The easy peezy frizzy lemonade, drank best with Italian cuisnes starting today!!

- Ice Tea - The good old iced tea but leaves you with no complaints. 

As we move on to the main course, imagine travelling to Italy, sitting inside one of the cafes, on the cobbled streets, brightly lit with yellow bulbs, beautiful music in line with the cuisine, and good food.

- Arrostito Peperone: A bowl full of flavorsome red pepper paprika soup. Warm, tasty, spicy, creamy.

- Zuppa Di Funghi: Mushroom and cream soup. The soup was full of flavors, and tasted amazing. My favorite of the evening!

- Caprese: A salad of tomatoes, mozzarella chunks, and basil leaves. Accompanied with a pesto dip and two home baked bread slices.

- Focaccia Mozzarella: As the name suggests, focaccias baked with mozzarella cheese inside. Tad a bit too dry but when dipped in the pesto sauce, the entire taste changes.

- Penne Pesto: Penne pasta cooked in the perfect pesto sauce. Looked rick, perfect texture, tasted good.

- Spaghetti Bolognese: The good old bolognese pasta, instead of the meat balls , you have generous minced meat sauce. The pasta's cooked perfectly with a  lot of olive oil hence it is not dry. The salt quotient is perfect. The meat sauce is bang on taste!! Recommended.

- Pizza Al Alla Bella: A round think crust pizza. Crisp and full of flavor. The pizza sauce is perfect with sundried tomatoes, black olives, fresh onions, and bocconcini as the toppings!

- Pollo: The chicken pizza. The base and pizza sauce remains common. The toppings get more flavorsome with smoked chicken, caramelised onions, rosemary, spinach, and roasted garlic.

- Pollo Di Mascarpone: This was the jewel of the evening. Such brilliant yet subtle favors! The entire meat chunk was cut into perfect round meat slices. Filled with goodness and loaded with mascarpone cheese fondue.

- Risotto Al Funghi: Mushroom risotto with no compromise in quantity. 

- Wood-fired choccolato fondente: Their signature choco molten cake. A thin slice and the goodness of chocolate oozes out. Placed on crumbs and accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. The perfect end to a full some, flavor some dinner.

Alla Bella Mozzarella, I am definitely recommending you guys to all the people in my list. :)

2. Focaccia Mozzarella - Homemade focaccia bread traingle in shape with rosemary and Mozzarella(Cheese) inside but the quantity was lesser than i expected it to be. 

3. Spaghetti Bolonese - This was my personal favorite for the evening. Keema being throned over the spaghethi and looked royal and being topped with basil leave. Going extremely deadly together and the amount was truly justified.

4. Penne Pesto - The greeny affair. Made with the green basil sauce and mixed really well to give a proper flavor of the dish. 

5. Pizza Al Alla Bella - First large pizza dropped on the table and it was veg one. topped with tomatoes, black olives, fresh onions and bocconcini. Size was perfect and had a soft chew with it but the crust at the end was a bit hard.

6. Pollo Chicken Pizza - The second pizza on the table but this time it was the Non veg one. Contained smoked chicken, caramalised onion which was just wow to taste, rosemary, spinach and roasted garlic which enhanced the taste to double.

7. Pollo Di Mascarpone - A very simple looking dish but with the aunthencity on the plate to fulfill the palette. Grilled cut Chicken was with a mascarpone cheese fonde to be dipped over them and to make some impact.

8. wood-fired cloccolato fondente - I was just imagining why it is their signature ? Until it came on the table we had a look at it to believe it. It was the molten chocolate cake baked in the wood fire oven which we mainly find in Italty. Oh lord this was just a stellar with the Vanilla ice cream.

Loved the ambiance and service and the food was spot on to the expectations. Atleast we have now a place to have some real Italian flavor on the cards. Recommended place.

This place has been on my list for a long time. I chanced upon the opportunity to visit this place yesterday. Tucked away in the lanes of Ballygunge, the restaurant is a sheer delight!
The name depicts an Italian place, and this place IS your one stop solution for Italian food. Most of the items are oven made, and served piping hot. The open brick wood oven is the USP of the place. 
Our server for the evening, Gabriel was a delight to talk to! He is jolly, vigilant, and helpful.

We tried the following:

**Drinks** 
- Cranberry Lemonade - Lemonade never tasted better. Perfect drink for the evening. I was only used to the cranberry breezer before I tried this. 

- Lemonade - The easy peezy frizzy lemonade, drank best with Italian cuisnes starting today!!

- Ice Tea - The good old iced tea but leaves you with no complaints. 

As we move on to the main course, imagine travelling to Italy, sitting inside one of the cafes, on the cobbled streets, brightly lit with yellow bulbs, beautiful music in line with the cuisine, and good food.

- Arrostito Peperone: A bowl full of flavorsome red pepper paprika soup. Warm, tasty, spicy, creamy.

- Zuppa Di Funghi: Mushroom and cream soup. The soup was full of flavors, and tasted amazing. My favorite of the evening!

- Caprese: A salad of tomatoes, mozzarella chunks, and basil leaves. Accompanied with a pesto dip and two home baked bread slices.

- Focaccia Mozzarella: As the name suggests, focaccias baked with mozzarella cheese inside. Tad a bit too dry but when dipped in the pesto sauce, the entire taste changes.

- Penne Pesto: Penne pasta cooked in the perfect pesto sauce. Looked rick, perfect texture, tasted good.

- Spaghetti Bolognese: The good old bolognese pasta, instead of the meat balls , you have generous minced meat sauce. The pasta's cooked perfectly with a  lot of olive oil hence it is not dry. The salt quotient is perfect. The meat sauce is bang on taste!! Recommended.

- Pizza Al Alla Bella: A round think crust pizza. Crisp and full of flavor. The pizza sauce is perfect with sundried tomatoes, black olives, fresh onions, and bocconcini as the toppings!

- Pollo: The chicken pizza. The base and pizza sauce remains common. The toppings get more flavorsome with smoked chicken, caramelised onions, rosemary, spinach, and roasted garlic.

- Pollo Di Mascarpone: This was the jewel of the evening. Such brilliant yet subtle favors! The entire meat chunk was cut into perfect round meat slices. Filled with goodness and loaded with mascarpone cheese fondue.

- Risotto Al Funghi: Mushroom risotto with no compromise in quantity. 

- Wood-fired choccolato fondente: Their signature choco molten cake. A thin slice and the goodness of chocolate oozes out. Placed on crumbs and accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. The perfect end to a full some, flavor some dinner.

Alla Bella Mozzarella, I am definitely recommending you guys to all the people in my list. :)

Monsieur and madame, sitting down inside, what you'd call an Italiano ristorante, you might ponder upon the thought "why always pizzas or pastas?". Allow me to tell you that all your thinking ends here. The inception of Alla Bella Mozzarella caused Kolkata to have one more stop for an authentic Italian restaurant.

When it comes to authentic Italian food, this place does the cuisine justice.
Starting from their selections of soups to basically everything.
*Arrostito Peperone: A warm coloured soup, rich in taste served with a swirl of cream. There is a subtle hint of paprika which makes the experience delightful.

*Zuppa di funghi: A delicious bowl of mushroom soup, thick in texture and rich in taste.

*Cranberry Lemonade: A nice, refreshing drink with a hit of cranberry that comes after a few seconds of sipping. An ideal drink for summer. Not too much pizzaz, but somehow gets you wanting for more.

*Caprese: Six pieces of Caprese served with a side of woodfired oven made breads. Capreses, in simpler words are tomatoes served as a base, with basil leaves and cheeses on the top. The secret is to put these pieces into the pesto dip before every bite.

*Focaccia Mozzarella: Four Focaccia breads stuffed with Mozzarella cheese. From a visual point of view, it looked delectable, especially with the fresh rosemary leaves. From a taste point of view, only a person with a developed Authentic Italian palette would be able to appreciate the subtle flavours of this dish.

*Penne Pesto: Penne pasta served in a nice, green pesto sauce. Although visually it looked delicious, when it came to flavour, it failed to impress. The pasta was spot on but the sauce lacked depth.

*Spaghetti Bolognese: On a bed of spaghetti sat our generous spread of keema which was topped with basil leaves and finely grated cheese. The pasta was delicious and the quantity was enough to leave a hungry man full for more than half a day.

*Pizza Al Alla Bella: A large sized, thin crust pizza with black olives, sundried tomatoes, fresh onions and much more. Nothing beats an authentic Italian pizza and this dish truly exemplifies that.

*Pollo: This pizza is a sheer beauty to look at. With its smoked chicken, caramelized onions, spinach and rosemary it was in all its glory. A beautiful pick if you're a pizza lover.

*Pollo Di Mascarpone: This dish is everything. Gorgeous, boneless chicken cut into small pieces and drenched over with mascarpone sauce. A must try if you're in this place.

*Wood-fired Chocolate Fondente: Oh. My. Gosh. Excuse my enthusiasm, but the name and the dish both deserves every bit of my childish excitement. Alla Bella Mozzarella's signature molten chocolate cake wood-oven baked served with a side of ice cream and crumbs. One word- delicious!

Located in the lane just opposite to 6, Ballygunj place.Service is very very slow.. Nothing great about the food.. Went to this place to try the wooden fiery style pizza. Ordered chicken pasta, Bruchetta bread and Mixed meat pizza. The taste of pizza was not up-to the mark.

Crispy thin wood burn pizza with your choice of topping goes just too delicious. Alio olio is good too. 
Cozy small place but worth a visit.

Absolutely love it! The bell pepper soup and the cranberry juice topped it. The ambience is perfect and the quaint setting and the feet tapping music gives this place the Italian jazz that sets it apart. The appetiser is limited especially when you are looking for veg selections but nonetheless this is one lovely joint I am sure to visit again. The staff service a little slow but terrific.

I visited this place with lots of hope but was overall quite disappointed.
We reached around 9 pm and there was no live music as claimed by the management. I had specifically called up and enquired about valet parking since I am somewhat medically challenged. Though I was lucky to get a parking close by, it does not have a valet service. Being a residential area, I was asked to park at a specific place by the restaurant representative. Halfway through my dinner I was asked to shift my car. It was ridiculous. 
The Stewart hardly understood anything except the food order. 
After finishing our food, we found out to our utter surprise that it does not even have a wash basin; leave aside a wash room !!!!
These things were pretty annoying. 
The food was acceptable; the pizza was good though no where close to competition. 
If I have a choice; I would definitely not visit again. 
I just hope the management looks into this since most of the people eating out look for overall satisfaction which was missing.

It's a small place in the lanes of Ballygunge. I had been wanting to try this place out since a very long time. We had the pizza Alla bella, lasagna and lemonade. The lemonade was served in milk bottles and was very refreshing. It was sour and sweet and tasted good. There was an orange slice inside the bottle to retain the flavour of the drink. The lasagna was also good. Two layers of pasta sheets with spinach, zucchini and a generous amount of mozzarella in it. But what I loved here was the pizza. It was loaded with olives and had the bitterness of sundried tomatoes. There were juicy slices of onions and the tomato sauce base was tangy and fresh. I think it is safe to say that this is the best place for pizzas in Kolkata. Or Atleast one of the few great places where you get authentic pizzas. I highly recommend this place to everyone. It has a lovely ambience with dim lighting and the staff is very friendly. You can even watch the chefs cook and there is a big woodburn oven at display. Lovely place with lovelier food.

Due to recent reviews, I had kept my hopes low for Alla Bella Mozzarella, and maybe it was because of that, but I had enjoyed my outing here. After wanting to visit this place since it's inception, I finally did so about a year later, despite it being a 5 min walk from my home. 
Had gone on a weekday lunch, and it was mostly empty. The songs were good, and as for the food, it's amazing. Had ordered risotto primavera and 4 cheese pizza. And I loved them both. Although my friend found the pizza underwhelming and even complained to the staff. Immediately the staff had replaced our pizza with a new one. He was still critical about the replacement, but we both enjoyed. Do try the pizza with the olive oil and chilli flakes, if you crave that kind of taste. 
Coming to the price, it was expensive. The above mentioned items cost 1000, but we went in knowing that. So all was as expected. If you want to try the risotto, this is the place.

Had fried calamari and pizza. The calamari was not good - the batter was too thick and there was hardly any squid inside. It was more oily than I thought it would be, and the quantity was not enough. Pizza (had Corleone) was actually very good and fresh. The toppings were adequate and the service was fast.

We four friends did look up the reviews before going for dinner at this new restaurant in my locality but were sadly disappointed. The food was not up to the mark. We had ordered Pizza Al Alla Bella and Mozarella in Carroza to start with. The Pizza was average, it had sundried tomatoes, onions, basil and black olives, but the Mozarella in Carroza (crumbfried mozarella)was tasteless. For the main course we had ordered Spaghetti Di Prawn Aglio and Spaghetti Pesto,  but both were very oily and hardly had any taste. It was just tossed in a lot of oil, and you would really have to look for the prawns or vegetables with the microscope. Both the Spaghetti  were so unpalatable that we had to order another Pizza Al Alla Bella to appease our hunger.
Service is also very slow even though customers were less as we went on a weeknight. It being a expensive place though taxes are not separately charged we had a very high expectation.

The food overall was nice...I think if they work on their service their rating would go up...overall a decent experience ...

Writing this review even before the food has arrived. That's how the experience has started. It looks like the place is getting ready to close doors pretty soon or maybe they're just surviving on Swiggy deliveries. Not a place that I would recommend to go for a sit down meal. Was handed a bottle of water to go to the washroom since there was no water. Wonder what the management and owners are doing about maintaining the place!

Yesterday was my 4th visit to Alla Bella. All 4 experiences have been excellent. I usually don't post any reviews but this time I have no option but to post it considering that the relatively new place continues to serve us well. I am a vegetarian to start with and always thought I would get limited choices at an Italian joint. But I was wrong. The soups are good and so are the starters. The Pastas stole the show and so did the Risotto. The wood fired pizzas are excellent. The "Homemade Lemonade" seemed quite popular in my family though I avoid soft drink but I tasted it and it was quite good. Their signature dessert "Fondente" (spell check) was again most amazing. Service has always been good even when they are jam packed. Another visit stands due very soon. Billing was also not very high at Rs 2000 for a meal for 3.

A tiny, rustic cafe off Ballygunje which celebrates the richness ot Italian cusine. Alla Bella Mozzarella lives up to its gregarious charm is all set to surprise you with its widespread menu. This eatery reminds us of cobbled streets, hidden lanes and amidst that snugs comfortably pizzerias in Italy. 

Location: Set off in the obscure lanes of Ballygunje. Just a left turn from Ballygunje Place and you hit headon.

Decor and Ambience: Inside is super cosy, with a warm and hospitable ambience of a typical pizzaria. bulb shining to its yellowish tinge, crude whitewashed brick walls,wood furniture, highlight of a wood fired oven bring in the true essence of old Europe and exemplify the rich Italian dining experience. 

Staff: The service staff is less amicable, distracted, inattentive and confused and the strength being less, they are unable to balance it when large crowd pools in.

Food: What came across our table was simplt fantabulous.

Beverages : 

1. Lemon iced tea
                                                                ...

I have been here a few times earlier. Food wise, have never face issues, but today apparently the chef may have messed up because there was more salt than required in most dishes we had called for.

And to the Management of the restaurant, get a working toilet for God's sake. It's time you should. We aren't living in the Dark Ages or some village to be carrying water bottles inside the stinky cubicle to wash with.

place is very small and if crowded will be congested. We called for wood fired Pizza Al Verdure, Margherita, Spaghetti Pesto, Rissoto Prima Vera and Inhouse Signature Molten cake baked in wood fired oven. The food was good. Service was a tad slow than expected. The restaurant is quite Economical according to the bill what we paid for 4 pax. Negative was that the washroom was shut as there was no running water. And two dessert items were not available in spite of them having a very Ltd dessert menu. Not a place which will wow, if you are hungry and around this area you could give it a go.

I have been here a few times earlier. Food wise, have never face issues, but today apparently the chef may have messed up because there was more salt than required in most dishes we had called for.

And to the Management of the restaurant, get a working toilet for God's sake. It's time you should. We aren't living in the Dark Ages or some village to be carrying water bottles inside the stinky cubicle to wash with.

place is very small and if crowded will be congested. We called for wood fired Pizza Al Verdure, Margherita, Spaghetti Pesto, Rissoto Prima Vera and Inhouse Signature Molten cake baked in wood fired oven. The food was good. Service was a tad slow than expected. The restaurant is quite Economical according to the bill what we paid for 4 pax. Negative was that the washroom was shut as there was no running water. And two dessert items were not available in spite of them having a very Ltd dessert menu. Not a place which will wow, if you are hungry and around this area you could give it a go.

Located in the bylanes of ballygunge (close to 6ballygunge place), this italian bistro/restaurant had me with their interiors and the open clay oven! But that was just it!
Was here yesterday for a dinner and found the place to be small but cosy. Around 10 tables cover the dining space. The rustic brick walls, dim lighting, barrel wall installs are eye catchy.
We ordered for the following-
1) Pizza al Alla Bella which with toppings like olives, sundries tomatoes, bocconchini and onions. The pizza had the bocconchini n onion missing( only spotted a strand of onion on the pizza wooden plate!). Ithe sauce on the base was good but the lack of toppings completely spoiled the experience of a open fire oven pizza!
2) the primevera risotto was good n creamy but lacked garnishing and the plating was ridiculous!

Overall a lot of things fell short with the food and presentation. Service was decent.
One question: why charge a crazy 85 for bottled water and 105 for cold drinks?

The restaurant needs to make marathon improvement in order to survive in an already competitive cuisine market- Italian!
I love italian , but wouldn't want to visit this place again!
We paid 1080/- for our meal.
Request the management to look into improvements asap because the place seems promising!

Verdict: not recommended at the moment.

Have heard great reviews about this place. So had reasonably high expectations. Starting with the ambience it was very rustic and quaint. When we went in it was somewhere around 5 pm so ours was the only table occupied. For some reason the staff decided to turn off the charming music playing which was weird and turn down the ac
Our server was a young boy who seemed quite clueless. He took our order and came back 15 minutes later to inform us that seafood and bacon weren't available. Which seriously limits the food options. I can have chicken based pasta or pizza pretty much everywhere else
Another unsettling thing was the staff standing and chatting quite loudly nearby. 
Now coming to the food. The plus is the open style kitchen where you can see the pizza being prepared by hand and then being put in the pit fire
The homemade lemonade was beyond delicious. Just the right balance of lemon sugar n hint of salt to quench your thirst and a perfect accompaniment with your meal
The spaghetti de pollo was delicious. The pasta al dente. The chicken was generously proportioned. And the sauce was rich and creamy
Coming to the pizza however and here is where it got disappointing for me. Since i was expecting perfection. Starting with the base. Just because the pizza is thin crust the base doesnt have to resemble a burnt naan. Which this pizza did. Coming to the topping. The sauce was average. The cheese very very less and the meat was next to none. Also someone teach these people that marinara sauce doesnt mean minced meat over tomato sauce. And lstly the description of the marinara pizza said it hd fresh coriander which along with the cheese the chef supposedly forgot to add
My 3* review is only for the pasta and the lemonade but the place needs to majorly up its game in terms of its pizza as well as staff if they want to do well.

Great food ! 
Authentic flavours ! 

I personally like speciality restaurants with small menus as it shows a dedication to quality. The pastas are great and the wood fired oven pizzas are even better. Great to see that they even have a whole wheat option for the pizza and the taste was great. 

I found the bolognaise a bit to saucy, but the fish and chicken secondi was great. The doneness of the pasta was just a shade above al dante, which I personally actually like.

The tiramisu was over, which frankly I am quite ok with as when u make limited numbers it could possibly run out. What I am not ok with is no boconcini. 

Service definitely could be better no doubt. 

Fo price paid..... A tad bit on the expensive side !

True to its word on late night delivery of wood burn pizza. Ordered the mushroom and baby corn pizza and was delighted with the light smokey taste. Will have to try out more of the menu to up the rating.

Ordered a pollo, mozzarella, pepperoni pizza with spaghetti bolognese. Ordered 4 cokes and a cranberry lemonade. Lemonade was good, spaghetti was good but had too much of tomato making it too sour. Pizza base of all three pizzas were charred. Sent it back to get a new one which took us 20 minutes more. After eating the food in bits and pieces and getting the burnt taste did not bother eating anymore. Disappointing as the staff serves burnt food without even checking it. Rating 2 for the cranberry lemonade which was refreshing. Inside decor is good but music is too loud forcing the people to speak louder thereby making it harder to talk to the person sitting next to you.

The cream of mushroom and minestrone soup were spot on - fresh and tasteful...the homemade lemonade and cranberry lemonade disappointed with disproportionate amount of syrup in both of them....
The wood fired bread for starter was ok, ABM Classico and Al Verdure Pizza just about good enough...I think the mixed sauce penne pasta was the stand out prep. 
I must also put forward a caveat that I doubt my tastebuds to completely appreciate authentic Italian.
Unlikely to come again

I could not believe a restaurant serving such awesome food existed in Kolkata !! I happen to visit this Italian restaurant and was amazed with the interior and food options and taste ! The staff is too courteous.. We had ordered the mushroom soup - which was splendid , wedges in red sauce - very different , pizza - ala bella special was really well baked in the wood oven , Spagetti - pesto sauce is a must eat there and asparagus risotto was yummy too !! Was not left with any space in my tummy for the dessert but that is due !!!! And ofcourse to quench the thirst was the cranberry based drink and ice tea !!! All in all I soooo loved the place... Staff is too courteous to Guide u well what I order as well !!!

A small restaurant near Ballygunge Phari, Alla Bella Mozzarella has got mixed reception among the lovers of Italian Food in the city. Located pretty close to 6BP flagship near Ballygunge Phari, this one is a surprise find in the narrow by-lane.The name itself makes not so much meaning as ‘Alla’ & ‘Bella’ are simply female names prevalent in Russia/Ukraine & Italy respectively. It’s the innovative rhyming with mozzarella that gives it a masterstroke. Immediately establishing the fact that this is all about some cheesy delights. & Rightly so. Not only the name, the decor is also modeled after a rustic looking joint, lighting a bit dim, bare-bricked walls looking like some European tavern. Quite goes with the mood. Though the restaurant claims to serve ‘wood fired pizza’ all that I could find was a big brick oven with gas-fire inside. In any case there wasn’t any wood in the oven.

Alla Bella Mozzarella, located on the lane opposite to the petrol pump adjacent to Hazra Road, is as quirky as it’s name. This place specializes in Italian cuisines, as the name suggests. Recently, Panchphoron was invited here for a food tasting session. The restaurant, though small, has got a fine decor. Here, pizzas are prepared from wood fire in front of customers, which is a delight to watch.

Decent little pizzeria with a standard italian fare. The menu has limited options for veg. They have a wood fired oven and use fresh ingredients which reflects in the taste. Loved the Grilled chicken and Bell pepper soup. Only downside is their tiny portions which would be barely enough for 1 severely hungry person. Overall, not a bad experience.

Finally got a table here after going back last Saturday. 
Last Saturday was in Ballygunge and called them if they have a table. They said they have vacancy. Reached 5 mins later and was told that there is 30 minutes waiting

So tried again this Saturday. Was told that they don't take bookings on weekends. So after waiting for 20 mins got a table. On entering we saw that the owner was sitting alone on a 6 seater for almost 30 minutes keeping a table for one of his relative/friend.

While placing the order the waiter said he will just come back and then he went to the owner's friend table and started taking their order keeping us waiting for 10 minutes to place the order. 

The salad and the soup was good. The spaghetti , risotto and pizza was excelent. 

We ordered the desert and was told that it comes with vanilla ice cream . But when the desert came there was no ice cream. When we told them the waiter said he forgot to get it and will get it right away. Waited for 10 minutes and the. Was told that the ice cream was over. How on a Saturday night at 9.30 can your ice cream get over?????

Even after such good food, but with such a service would not recommend anyone to go there unless you are related to the owners. 

If you want to entertain your relatives then why open the place to public. Might as well keep it private for your relatives .

A small and cozy joint, this place serves an all Italian spread. The rustic interior with the brick wall, a letter box with the word 'Commenti' inscribed on it, a firewood oven and other knick knacks give you the feeling of an authentic Italian restaurant. Coming to the food, me and my colleagues started off with Zuppa Di Fungi, a creamy mushroom soup and Minestrone, a classic Italian soup with fresh vegetables. The texture and flavor of the mushroom soup was really nice while the Minestrone was comforting with all the veggies in the clear and flavorful broth. We then proceeded to the pizza and pasta section and ordered the Pollo and the Pepperoni Pizza, along with Spaghetti di Prawn Aglio. Being a foodie whose highly addicted to pizza, I was a bit disappointed with their version of the wood fired thin crust pizza. A fast food joint like Domino's is more generous with their pepperoni than what they provided, little shavings of pepperoni scattered here and there on the pizza. The Pollo hardly had any smoked chicken and all the other ingredients mentioned in the menu were scantily placed.  Coming to the pasta, the first element of surprise came when we saw that it contained tiny button shrimps whereas the menu clearly stated Prawns, and there was a lot of butter used in the preparation which defied the whole purpose of having a dish like this on the menu. One of us wanted to speak to the Chef but we were told by that customers are not allowed to speak to the Chef. We encountered a rude reply from the staff who was attending us when we asked about the preparation of the pasta dish, as the Chef was unreachable. He clearly had no idea about the food that he is serving to the customers. After this unpleasant moment we wanted to end our meal on a sweet note, so we ordered their Tiramisu and Biscotto Al Cioccolato. One should not expect much when it comes to Tiramisu as the version they serve at this restaurant is a plain sponge cake with coffee flavor. For someone whose trying Tiramisu for the first time, this one came as a big let down. The Biscotti Al Cioccolato was nice despite it being dry inside and not gooey.  Overall an average experience. Would not pay a second visit.

I went to this place on the recommendation of family members. I found the food to be amazing.  The potato wedges in alfredo sauce,  the pesto spaghetti,  the mushroom risotto are all to die for. Special mention to the mushroom risotto.  Its the yummiest version i have tasted.  The pizza was also very good but i have had better.  It should have been overloaded with toppings but it was not.  The toppings were very sparse.  But it tasted good.  The menu is not at all pricey and they charge a reasonable amount considering the quality of food that they serve.  The only drawback is that its a small place and feels a bit cramped.  But i can easily overlook this for the tasty food.  Yummy is all i can say.

A fairly decent experience with good food. The prices seem pretty reasonable for most restaurants at this range. 
Must try Spaghetti Di Polo and Wood Fired Ciocolatto Fondente.
Although a bit disappointed for not being able to try their dishes which include bacon as they had run out of it. 
Definitely will go again 💯

I have always been on a lookout for nice spaghetti that will blow my mind and make me not wanna share any inch of it...this place provides you that. it serves good food..but good food alone does not lift a restaurant to a high pedestal. I had first visited this place 3-4 months back and the washroom was broken. And so many months later its still broken. If a restaurant hosts a washroom then it should be usable by a human. Its like people do not even have the liberty to wash your hands because you will find stinky unflushed shit in the pot. Naturally after that you will just wanna leave and not eat. I would love to keep having their pasta but emptying your bladder and forgetting your hygiene issues seems to be too big a price to pay for a good plate of pasta.

First of all I loved their interiors, but not sure why they have a guy opening doors though. It is rustic inside but with a door man outside.
Service was good, food was excellent. Prices are average, I would like to visit again.
One of the few places in Calcutta serving wood fired oven pizza, I am not exactly a fan as they are not very filling but I like to have it once in a while and they make good pizzas.
Specially liked their pepper soup.

Went to the place on the high recommendation of my friend, it’s got a small quaint feeling to it but after few seconds the ambiance became non tolerable as the Ac & the exhaust were not working properly. We ordered our meals and had to step out to get away from the smoky & stuffy feeling. My friend for whom it was a third visit did say he didn’t face such problems in his earlier visit, so the restaurant just might have been having a bad day. 

The menu is limited and being a group of five we ordered quite a bit of collection given on the menu. Sad to say i didn’t enjoy a single starter whereas all the main course dishes were fabulous for me, loved the pasta, pizza as well as the risotto. The prices are cheap considering the kind of high quality food served by them. 

If the Ac had worked fine the experience would have been much better.

I had heard a lot about this place so decided to try it out. 
The futticini carbonara and the grilled fish in lemon caper buttet sauce were so much better than the pizzas that it was a letdown overall since wanted to have pizzas more than anything at the time. 
The pollo pizza was good and so was the bacon pizza. 
Although the thin crust of the pizza was exceptional the quantity of the sauce used was bad. It felt like eating bread with toppings. Which is the main reason for an average review. 
Pizzas need sauce. No need to be stingy with it. 
The flavour of the toppings used were quite good and one can tell that the toppings were fresh. 
But still, ordered pizza from here instead of dominos and was disappointed. Would have rated 3 or lower if pasta and the fish had not been so good. 
Well, every cloud has a silver lining and on that dinner the pasta and the grilled fish were the silver lining at that time.

If you are looking for authentic Italian food, look no further. The dishes are simple using quality ingredients as it should be. Pasta is always al dente. Hands down the best pizza I had in India so far. I am Italian and I'm rating this full marks. I come here when I need a bite of home. I don't care how long I have to wait to get in as long as I get in :) I could not make a better pesto myself. If I could rate this restaurant a 10 I would.

Alla Bella Mozzerella: 

The Calcutta ( oh yes CALCUTTA always)  food joint scene reminds me of the Geri Halliwell song " Its raining men" . Only in this case " its raining restaurants". Never before has this city seen this kind of inundation of  food joints. They are opening at a fast pace, shutting down at a even more rapid pace. But that’s how the food business is I guess with the highest mortality rate. 

Coming to this petite , cozy joint and hoping it does not meet the same fate as others.

I came to know about this from my sister who is another foodie and there is hardly any joint that has escaped her ever prying eyes! 

Location: The narrow lane opposite “ 6 Ballygunge Place” , you will have to go further inside before it pops on the left hand side.

Décor: Very well made. Rustic brickwork walls, a nice letter box with the words ‘ Commenti’ inscribed on it, a firewood oven, lots of knick knack to make you feel in an Italian restaurant. The overwhelming aroma of olive oil, wood fire pizzas entice your senses futher.

Items Ordered:  

1.	Roasted tomato basil soup- One of the best I have had in recent times, that smokey flavor of burnt tomatoes was so good.

2.	Funghi soup- Blow me down! Another winner, too good. Must try. Perfect balance of creaminess and mushroom flavor.

3.	Tomato basil bruschetta- nothing great, can be avoided.

4.	Pizza alla bella- spicy but the bread was quite thick. It was average. Have had way better pizzas at TCC or Little Italy.

5.	Risotto Al Funghi- I don’t think that a single morsel of rice was left in the dish after we finished. Phenomenal! It was gorgeous.

6.	Wood Fired chocolate fondant-  No other dessert was available other than this. It was below average. Lacked taste. Try this at Little Italy. Its heavenly.

Billing-  Considering that the total bill was around Rs 2000 between the 4 of us, I would say its very good value for money. But there were no taxes at that point. Add another 20%  and then it does not appear that cheap but still reasonable than its peers.

Conclusion: It’s a joint with a lot of potential I believe. I would go back for the soup and risotto definitely.

Place is small, nice and quaint. Decor is mediocre however simple and nice. Service is slow and appetizers take a long time. It took 20 minutes to serve two people one appetizer. Food choices are nice as menu is strictly italian but mostly has popular dishes.

A nice joint but need to work on their service and presentation. Also there is no comllimentary bread to munch on while waiting on food. Most italian places offer a basket of assorted breads to keep customers busy while they wait on food.

3/5 stars for me!!

Tucked away in a small lane in ballygunj the place is very very small with hardly a seating of 35 people.

With only 2-3 staff the service is also not very good.. They are still very un organised probably because they have just started..

The food menu is completely Italian with a good variety of options available for vegetarians.. The pizza which is there speciality is very very good specially because I was looking for one with fresh herb leaves and really loved it.. The drink option was very very limited and was not good also.. The pasta was also pretty decent. 

However the weirdest thing about the place is their Mis management. We had to wait for 20 mins for the bill which was wrong twice. After first correction the second correction was merely made by hand by deducting the gross amount and ignoring the taxes. We were so fed up by end of it that we left and did not argue also on it.

All in all they really need to improve in service front.

At the time of placing my order i was informed by Ranjit the server that the waiting time would be 10-15 minutes but had to wait for 50 minutes without one. There is no service standards followed by the service staff and the owners should look into it. Very poor did not expect such a poor quality standards by this place very disappointed that I wasted my valuable time in such a place. The servers do not follow the basic norm of service that is first come first serve basis

Tucked inside a quiet Ballygunge Place lane is Alla Bella Mozzarella, the newest Italian restaurant in town. My friends Poorna and Shikha were speaking very highly of this new restaurant so on Mother’s Day, I dropped in with my parents. It’s only been a couple of months since Alla Bella Mozzarella opened but the restaurant has already become really popular. We went in around 1 pm and only a few tables were available. Within 15 mins those got booked too and then, there were people standing outside waiting to get a free table.  Queues in front of a restaurant can only mean one thing. Good food and yes, Alla Bella Mozzarella serves really good Italian food!

Tucked away in a small lane in ballygunj the place is very very small with hardly a seating of 35 people.

With only 2-3 staff the service is also not very good.. They are still very un organised probably because they have just started..

The food menu is completely Italian with a good variety of options available for vegetarians.. The pizza which is there speciality is very very good specially because I was looking for one with fresh herb leaves and really loved it.. The drink option was very very limited and was not good also.. The pasta was also pretty decent. 

However the weirdest thing about the place is their Mis management. We had to wait for 20 mins for the bill which was wrong twice. After first correction the second correction was merely made by hand by deducting the gross amount and ignoring the taxes. We were so fed up by end of it that we left and did not argue also on it.

All in all they really need to improve in service front.

At the time of placing my order i was informed by Ranjit the server that the waiting time would be 10-15 minutes but had to wait for 50 minutes without one. There is no service standards followed by the service staff and the owners should look into it. Very poor did not expect such a poor quality standards by this place very disappointed that I wasted my valuable time in such a place. The servers do not follow the basic norm of service that is first come first serve basis

Yesterday night I got my food home delivered using zomato online order app from Alla bella.. We ordered risotto primavera, fatate arrabiata. When I called up the restaurant to confirm the order, the manager didn't even bother to listen to what I had to say and started saying rudely that we will do when we receive the order. Then I asked him to calm down and listen to what I had to say. After that when I cleared that I have just placed an order and these two dishes I want but I am allergic to asparagus so pls avoid that which I had mentioned along with the order but still confirming as to last time the items which I asked to exclude were included. The manager spoke very badly and has no sense of talking. After 1.5 hours I received my order as the delivery person reached on time but the restaurant didn't hand over the food. After 1.5 later when I had my risotto which tasted good but was more liquidy so it started falling in the packet I was delivered but fatate arrabiata which is a potato based dish which I called for a kid could not even had a bite of it because it was fully burnt and when I tasted it tasted like a burnt charcoal. I again called up the restaurant and without hearing what I had to say the same rude ill mannered guy said now what.. You got the order right and he disconnected.. If this is how the restaurant would run then I feel sorry for whoever the owner is! I wish I could give the rating in negative.

My friend was very excited to try this new place since its very close to here home and she had read decent reviews on Zomato. But this place failed to live up to our expectations.  We tried the fried calamari which was overcooked and chewy and the quantity was meagre. Then we tried Spaghetti di Pollo. The spaghetti was too oily and chicken was overcooked. We also tried Pollo di Mascarpone and I was not surprised to find the chicken overcooked even the potato mash wasn't good. The most sad part however was the fresh lime soda. My advice is please use fresh limes while making it, because limes are available in abundance and are cheap as well. Plz don't use bottled syrups or cordials for making fresh lime sodas.

The place is quite small with around 5-6 tables only so you better go prepared or have a reservation. It's inside a narrow lane so parking could also be challenging. Seating isn't that comfortable and you feel a little cramped and rushed while eating here. However all said and done the food is good. The pesto pasta, fried mozzarella, alla bella pizza (wood fired of course) were quite good and I recommend them.

Please do not request their food to be delivered home. They took over 2 hours to deliver the food and on calling repeatedly their response at every stage was that the delivery boy was on his way. They are also absolutely unsure about where the location is, as the food delivery boy was searching for Kolkata - 20 in Alipore. My 1.5 is simply for their food. That's definitely of great quality.

I just would like to share my experience : I requested for home delivery (as I am not feeling well these days) and over phone they conveyed on delivery in 1 hour. After that time, I called them and food was not yet ready and they asked for 30 minutes extra; I had to agree. Finally, after several call and reminder, food has reached my place at 10.50 pm ( I have ordered at 8.15 pm)... after approx. 3!!!. This event is related to yesterday.

Today I thought to try again...maybe I was unlucky last time: over phone they have refused my request for home delivery as my place is "too far and they have only on delivery boy". I live approx. 4 km far from restaurant...

Its a tiny cozy pizzeria tucked inside Ballygunge Circular Rd. It has got really rustic interiors and is lighted with filament bulbs which makes it really attractive.I loved the Spicy Alla Bella Pizza and the Cranberry Lemonade here . The pizza crust is very thin and well done. Its a delight to bite into their pizzas .Although I really feel they could add more toppings to their pizzas and could improve on the service front in terms of waiting time.Still , owing to the quality of the food and good value for money,I would recommend it to anyone looking for authentic yummy pizzas .

This is a tiny joint in one of the bylanes of Ballygunge. But what a place. It took two attempts but I finally managed to get a table a couple of days back. Just goes to show the popularity and for good reason.

We had a couple of people who were eating No Onion/Garlic food and impressively they had a number of options for them.

The Mozzarella in carozza was quite nice and the sundries tomato pesto served along side was just right to cut through the cheese. The Roasted Pepper soup and the Tomato Basil soup were both excellent.

We ordered two pizzas, The Margherita (without Onion and Garlic) and the Pizza Alla Bella. Both were quite good. The Pizza Alla Bella had a slightly spicy sauce which gave it a nice kick. The pasta with tomato and basil we ordered (again without onion/garlic) was saucy and heaped with basil giving it a very nice and strong basil flavour. The lasagna ordered was tasty but missing some tomato/cheese sauce. While it was not dry the sauce was a bit watery.

For desserts we had the chocolate fondant which was great to taste but needed some ice-cream to cut through the slight bitterness of the chocolate.

The main reason I have not given a higher rating to Alla Bella is that the service was quite sub standard. With a seating of just about 30 odd customers and 3-4 servers the attention expected was sorely missing. If your tables server went on a break the others were least bothered to take an order or serve. Even the service was generally without a smile and with a tired and irritated look by the other servers. With Italian eateries opening up by the dozen and pasta's and pizza's available all over the city service is where they will need to win the repeat customer.

Another important point is that I was quite excited about the wood fired pizzas. Unfortunately the chimney was out of order and we got pizzas cooked in the same oven but with gas heating. The smokey flavour was thus sorely lacking in the pizzas.

I would also suggest that you reach early and be prepared to wait as it is a small restaurant and do not take reservations.

Looks small, quaint and cosy, but do go there with a great, hearty appetite, because once you start eating, you'll want to try out more.  The spaghetti, pizza and cake we ordered was beautifully flavoured and the presentation was not sloppy either. Perfect ambience to chill out with friends or family. They serve the best chocolava cake in town, the chocolate ganache inside it is rich, flavourful and delicious. A decadent desert. The staff could be a wee bit friendlier and the quantity of food could be increased, but apart from that there are no complaints.

Tucked away in a little corner, opposite 6 Ballygunge Place, is the newly opened All Bella Mozzarella. I checked it out with some recommendations from Nikki Dhandhania, who graciously reserved a table for me. And I would like to stay the place scored really well on both the food and decor. Starting off with a mushroom soup - flavoured with the meatiness of mushrooms, and not overpowered by the taste of cream, was a hit. It was followed with a crunchy and spicy potato wedges in red sauce with olives and capers. The alla bella pizza was spicy and tantalised the taste buds with a crust that was thin and light. The mushroom risotto is a must-try for any mushroom lover. I would recommend going and eating there instead of calling a home-delivery because that's how Italian food should be eaten- fresh and right out of the kitchen! We reached at 7.30 so we were able to beat the crowd and get orders timely. Would surely be visiting again.

Even though they just had to cover 2 tables, it took them 40 mins to bring our food. Food was good, no complaints about it. We ordered Calamari, Penne im basil sauce and Pollo Pizza and chocolava cake. All of them were really good!. Its slightly pricy but worth it! ;)

Tiny little place in Ballygung. The place gets really crowded on weekends so make sure you come early. Pizza takes time to get ready so be prepared. The staff was a bit impolite and impatient. They wanted us to leave as quick as possible because there was a large number of people waiting outside. That kind of spoilt the experience. would visit again to try their pastas but not on a weekend.

The place is nice and quiet.

We tried the WOOD FIRED which is their speciality.

Good part about them is that you can order two different pizzas in 1. 

we ordered Half Al Fungi Pizza and Half Cipola Di Patate so you can actually try 2 in 1.

Then we ordered desert Chocolate Fondant. was like a choco lava cake small piece costed 250 seemed very over priced taste was quite same. 

BEWARE: Their washroom is not working since a long time. so u cant wash ur hands nor go to the washroom. Decent Experience. Iliked the Pizza

Ordered napoletana pizza from this upcoming pizza joint this evening. Food was packed well but Pizza turned out to be just okayish, just meeting the threshold for a satisfactory pizza nothing great. The pizza edges were very dry and kept as leftovers after the meal. The pizza was supposed to be a thin crust pizza one so I guess the topping got all the more soggy and the edges drier by the time it was delivered. I would suggest people to only order from here if they are really hungry and less options available around them. Definitely would like to see whether there is any marked difference in the dine in facility available.

Times when you don't want to go out of your house you order pizza. And that's what I did on a Thursday night at home. The delivery is kind of slow (although the place is 2 mins from my place) it took 40 mins for this pizza to come. Certainly, IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. The wood...

Long overdue review!

I spotted this restaurant in the 'Newly Opened' section as I was browsing Zomato one fine day. The words 'Wood Fired Oven Pizzas' caught my attention and I knew right then, that I had to go there. So, one Sunday morning, we (three of us) went in search of this restaurant, which took us a while to locate (Thank you, Google Maps! No thank you, Kolkata cab drivers).  

As we entered, I noticed that it wasn't exactly huge, and to add to that, the wood fired oven took up a lot of space, as it was in full view of the diners, separated by a glass panel. The interiors were tasteful, but minimalistic, with the brickwork giving it a rustic look. 

Since it had taken us a while to locate the restaurant, we were all very hungry and decided to order main courses straight away, instead of dwelling on appetizers and salads. We first ordered a Spaghetti in Arrabiatta Sauce, a Margherita Pizza and a Fettuccine Carbonara. The food finally arrived after what seemed like an eternity (because we were super hungry). The Pizza was very good, crisp, seasoned with basil, however a little more cheese wouldn't have hurt. The server had informed us earlier that Fettuccine would not be available, so the Carbonara pasta was made with Spaghetti instead and it turned out to be decent. 

However, what stole the show, was the Pomodoro Spaghetti which was served to us by mistake, instead of the Arrabiatta Sauce that we had ordered. It was half way through the meal that we realised this and when we informed the server of the mix-up, he very politely agreed to replace the dish. Even after eating all of this, we weren't completely satiated, so we ended up ordering another pizza, The Melanzane, which had eggplant slices on it, making it look like a vegetarian rendition of the classic Pepperoni slices on pizzas. Again, well done on the pizzas!

While we were dining, the proprietors of the restaurant, who are two young men in their twenties, stepped up to our table and enquired about the meal. Congratulations on the restaurant, you guys! 

Finally, we called for the cheque, which didn't include the Pomodoro that was served to us by mistake. While the food was excellent in quality, I would like to mention that the serving portions, especially for the Pasta dishes, were a tad small (and I have a pretty small appetite). Barring that, it was a great experience. 

I would definitely like to visit this place again!

So, the ratings for Alla Bella Mozzarella would be as follows: 

AMBIENCE: 3.5/5

FOOD: 4/5        

SERVICE:  4/5 

VALUE FOR MONEY:  3.75/5

Tucked into a quaint lane in Ballygunge, Alla Bella Mozzarella provided for an excellent venue for a small reunion. The exposed brick walls, an open kitchen, and soft music created the ideal ambience to enjoy the traditional Italian beauties. Highly recommend the Pizza Alla Bella for all veggie lovers and the Chocolate Fondant for sweet nibbles !

In short, "horrible". If you have to take revenge on someone, ask him to positively visit this place. Restaurant is an "experience" business as the world has moved on from "just food". 

Problems we faced (me and my family of 3):

1. Zero coordination. Even after reserving table in advance, arrived to find there's no record of it and had to wait almost 20 mins to be agreed by the serving person to give us a table. Later on found that the same is to be experienced by many more including a group of elderly people (well into their 60s) who decided to come here for a birthday celebration. Feel really sorry for them as they had to walk out after waiting for quite sometime.

2. AC doesn't work. It's a "Nazi" gas (heat) chamber. In a while, all including the serving guys were busy rubbing their faces to keep it dry. Some chap (deciphered him to be the owner tinkered with the AC remote but not to much help & he soon disappeared...why to take the pain of resolving it when people who have come in are anyway going to pay...now, not many would walk out!)

3. Even after placing the order, we had to wait too long. Ok, I take it...grilled items take time. But soft drink?! Waited for the glasses or even a straw to come to the table for another 15 mins (I had a child with me who cannot drink from the can and needs a straw). Me and my wife had to remind them almost 4 times and last time with a raised voice. 

4. The serving guys seemed to be agnostic to any of the customers' trouble or feedbacks. In fact, one of them didn't even bother to listen to anyone. A lady from the other table kept on asking for a Sprite and he didn't even look at her. She had to walk up to him to ask. It can't be that we and the other table occupiers had heard her and not the serving guy!

One positive: the food tasted decent (but not anything great that You'ld ignore all these bad experiences to come for it).

There's some serious trouble. Either they have opened to sell it out quickly by showing that they have a restaurant here (the vicinity has almost 8 restaurants and still all run full) or the runner needs a serious reviewing of their entire modus operandi. Btw, I am resident of the same locality and got disgraced today. 

My worst ever experience of dining.

I would have loved to give a 4 rating review to this restaurant, but the only reason for this is they lack in providing the basic facility like water in the wash room. May be i would love to visit the outlet super soon just to witness the turnaround when it comes to staff efficiency and managing facilities.

This 30 odd seater restaurant is located at Ballygunj place, in a narrow lane is definitely making its presence felt in the neighbourhood. It was a sunday evening when me along with my foodie friend decided to check this place out. anyway, it was in our wish list and it was well due. When we reached there it was around 8 pm and the restaurant was packed. they were running a wait and there were 3-4 groups waiting to be seated. they quoted us 45 minutes and we got a small teable for two within the time frame.

Coming to the food, the menu consists of hand picked popular italian delicacies. Insalate, Antipasti, Patsa, Pizza, Secondo and dolci, all features the tried and tasted italian dishes. the one section that stabds out is wood fired Pizza. i guess they are quite serious about this stuff and every tables were having one or the two from it. 

We ordered our POLLO PIZZA WHICH HAD A TOPPING OF Mozzarella, smoked chicken, onions and rosemary. it was well done. and served quite perfect. the accompaniments served after being asked for it. for pasta we ordered Spaghetti in arabiata sauce with chicken strips. food tasted good. and the portion size were enough. 
Ambience was quite impressive and contemporary. Open from 12.30 Noon to 10.30 PM. also known for late night delivery of woodburn pizza.

Overall experience was average but can be better if the quality of ingredients are improved, as the Menu and taste profile is good.
Pizzas were nice!

Visited this small joint Alla Bella ! It's a very compact one. 
Pizza was yummy! 
Spaghetti in pesto sauce was bullshit. 
Pasta pomodoro was extremely spicy! 
And to top it all.. The service was so slow that by the time I completed my dinner they couldn't manage to get my fresh lime. 
They really need to do something about the SERVICE!! If u go out to dine that's an important element.

Excellent, authentic Italian food. Pizza was perfectly cooked and the pasta was al dente. Antipasti and Dessert compliment the meal really well and good choice of non-alcoholic drinks. Quick and prompt service with very competitive pricing. USP is the cosy, warm ambience which makes for a very enjoyable dining experience. Really happy when I heard they deliver as well! Glad I found this gem tucked away in Ballygunge. Top marks.

#went to dine at this place on a Saturday but unfortunately couldn't get a place as it was full !
Tried another weekday ! And could get through the  cozy Italian restaurant ...though it has a small cozy ambience , it's perfectly made for a smooth dining experience ! :) loved the fire chamber for the wood fired pizzas! And the dim lighting ! I had to take away a pizza due to time shortage so just ordered their margarita pizza and it was a Perfect! Thin crust wood fired pizza! Would surely call for more deliveries from them! Keep it up! :)

Visited place last week. Turn on your google maps to locate this place. Small but decent place. Staff were generous and friendly. Ordered a spaghetti which was good. Had good flavours. Best was their tomato soup. Amazing loved the taste. Though i had to ask them to change the glass and water twice. The glasses were not properly washed. 
Still the food had good flavour.

The restaurant is a brain child of my younger grandson Naman...I have been there twice so far but has had home deliveries and deliveries at the Chitrakoot Art gallery which i frequent for evenings..Yesterday I told them about it and they wanted to sample a Pizza..It was delivered well in time..My friend Mr Prakash kejriwal liked it so much that he wanted two more so that everybody present there could have enough of it..It was delivered promptly..This morning my friend wanted its phone nos to order food from there whenever he felt like..He is a foodie and very discerning...My friend Ms. Shubha Pal, owner of Floatel, has appreciated its quality...
There was some service problems initially but its being taken care of..I am impressed when I was told that on certain evenings customers kept waiting in the cars so that they could dine there...It means that the quality is being accepted by the diners..Please do tell them about the areas which need to improve as its the first venture of Naman and his friend Raghav..They will definitely look into them....
Its gaining on reputation as home delivery orders came in from as far as Salt Lake..
My thanks to all of you who have been there..Do keep on visiting as your patronising it shall make it successful..

My experience wasn't pretty good this time. I'd looked up reviews on zomato before ordering dinner for my family. On their suggestion, we ordered one pizza and a spaghetti to feed three mouths. The quality is up to the mark, however the quantity is below average. A spaghetti is clearly not sufficient for one person. The pizza lacked the crisp crust you'd assume comes along with a thin crust order- a disappointing experience as that too wasn't enough to satisfy an average appetite. Recommended for- people who seek quality food.

Small italian joint in Ballygunj.. Parking is a bit of a problem. One waiter was doing running around and couldn't take order properly. Refused to give some sautéed garlic cause he couldn't understand what we wanted but then we asked the chef and it was delivered. The food takes time here.
Uovo di spinaci- yumm 
Spaghetti arrabbiata - yummy 
Aglio olio - don't try at all! 
Funghi pizza - so so 
 Pizza al alla bella- better than funghi
Risotto primavera - bang on and flavoursome 
Tiramisu- was warm ( strange!)

We ordered home delivery and food came after  more than two hours and was surprised to see Salad bowl almost empty.. When I called them up reply was .. Sir it might have become soggy !! So soggy that it becomes 1/10th of the serving size.. You will choke on rissoto and pasta as it really kicks up your lung, god knows what spice they put in it. Attaching a pic of their salad when delivered !! 
RATING MINUS ZERO

Easily one of the nicest looking restaurants in Calcutta, given their limited space. Warm and friendly, it's perfect for a summer afternoon. The food is bold, authentic and reeks of deep taste. Even though woodfired pizzas are their USP, I personally love the pastas and risottos. The chocolate fondant would definitely be one of the best desserts I've had at a restaurant. They also have the most adorable letter box for comments. Great job guys!

Located in a small lane of Ballygunj, this 30 seater eatery is a visual delight.- brick walls, open kitchen, well lit up. The staff was courteous and polite.
Coming to the food, there were the usual Italian fare. We had the bell pepper soup which was the highlight of the evening. A different dish which had a very comfy feeling. Next we had the eggplant merezapana ( not sure about the name), which was basically a baked dish. It was pleasant. Even people who don't like eggplant can try this classic Italian dish. We also had the Al fungi pizza- crunchy base, good sauce and filled with mushrooms. 
My only disappointment with this place was that the ravioli mentioned in the menu, was not available.

Located in Ballygunge, Alla Bella Mozzarella is a an authentic Italian spot! My first dining experience at the restaurant surpassed my expectations delightfully! Unlike the many fast food 'pizza points', ABM has thin crust, freshly baked, firewood oven made pizzas. The dishes have a unique preparation that gives an onus to try! The patate frite in arabiata sauce was brilliant ! Aglio e olio fans must give ABM a shot for their taste buds to relish it scrumptiously! If you have a sweet tooth, ABM would not be disappointing. They have a variety of different desserts that can easily encourage you for the second one ! My personal favourites is the  chocolate mouse and panna cotta ! The cozy, European style decor and the firewood  oven easily add to your dining experience ! A very well worked concept and a brilliant management! Wish lots of luck for its upcoming success !

A crazy horrible experience!! Heard decent reviews about this place from a fellow food-blogger of our group I asked a friend to pick up pizzas from here. He got home a chicken pizza which was bad, overcooked and almost burnt on the top! I don't understand as to how being a new place they could play up with their reputation so bad. The agli olio was tad oily, seemed to have been drenched in oil. God help this place. Will never go or order from here!

With a delay in delivery upto 2 hrs we had to ultimately cancel the order
Just a foolish attempt to advertise something which cannot be delivered
Orders at 10:30 pm is also taking more than 1.5hrs to deliver at ballygunge circular road itself
Ridiculous service

The place was shady and empty when we arrived there. We had ordered a pizza and a drink. The drink was okay though just filled with ice , the pizza was not cooked properly moreover the person serving it to us dropped a slice upside down. He didn't even do anything about it but simply placed it on our table and went away. They were getting some work done which involved drilling and ruining our time there. Would never visit again.

The restaurant is well thought off but nonetheless what keeps it going is the service they provide and the food they offer. The waiters were very unattentive and vague about the products they offered. They did not serve cold drinks. They said they did not have ice available and none of the drinks were cold. We still went ahead and ordered some kind of a drink which did not even look like a restaurant production. The glasses were half full and the glass. Provide small glasses if you can not give full quantities. The bill took more than 30 mins and the food even longer. The food was very average and half of the things on the menu are not even available in the restaurant. The pizza was not at all cooked properly and when we told the waiter to give us a fresh one he said that the pizza's come out like what we had in front of us. overall it was a bad experience and I would'nt go try it again.

A well done up Italian Cafe off Ballygunge Place. The restaurant is small but looks really nice. Dimly lit, with themed walls and a good exterior. The wood fired oven is on display which adds to the value of the place. We ordered for Garlic Bread with Cheese, Two Pizzas, A pasta and a risotto. The Risotto was very nice and we practically licked the bowl off. Garlic bread, Pizzas and and Pasta were ordinary to taste and portion sizes were too small for what they charge. We ordered for 4 mains and a starter between the 4 of us but were still not full. However, whats got their rating so low in my books is the confused and clueless service. Food took ages to come and guy forgot to communicate to the kitchen that we had ordered two pizzas although the kitchen was about 5 feet from our table. Pizzas took 40 mins to arrive which is far too long. Also, I found the staff to be very inattentive as we had to to actually call them 3-4 times for one of them to arrive at our table. 

Verdict : Go there for the ambience. Its really good. But if its great Italian good you seek, look elsewhere.

Pasta was perfect (one of the best I have had in cal) so were the pizzas. The best part is they deliver till 3am giving us some mid night ordering options and rescuing us from the 'Don'. The desserts could have been better I feel which I think will be with time. Over all amazing food. Check this place out ASAP  :)
