The restaurant is just beside of paradise cinema hall. We ordered chicken garlic kebab - taste was good. After that we ordered tandoori roti, mutton boneless masala & chicken chap. They served us chicken boneless masala instead of mutton boneless masala. After so much requests, they accept their fault & agreed to change the item to mutton. But the mutton & chicken pieces were cold from inside, but the gravy was hot. It may be effect of preserving the mutton & chicken pieces in the refrigerator. But that totally destroyed the taste of the food.

ordered tomorrow night from here! I ordered masala kulcha ,laccha parata,murgh makhani ,kadai murgh for dinner with my friends ! Packaging was good and hygienic! masala kulcha was very good but the other item was not upto the mark ! 
laccha parata tasted like it is from the roadside foodstall ,Murgh makhaani was not so much tasty ,And the kadai murgh the worst thing i had ever tasted ! really needed some quality check !

This presumably is one of the best restaurants for Indian food.Love to eat here in a pleasant atmosphere and lots of varieties and a buffet during weekends.
They have maintained the quality of food since years.
It's our regular getaway whenever we want to eat Non-vegeterian dish.
Full marks for the Food!

Happened to be in esplanade recently and had to pop into the legendary restaurant. While the food is freaking fantastic, it would be nice if the restaurant didn't treat customers like sh*t. In the 30 minutes I spent at the restaurant, the waiter came twice: to take an order and to leave the food. And the restaurant was empty so such service is absolutely unexpected.
I'll go for the food but takeout is the only way I'll do it.

When the mood strikes for some 'Mughal Appetizers', 'Aalishan' tries hard to keep your stomach on the track. Speaking of which, we tried Palin Naan with Chicken Tangri Butter Masala. The texture of the butter masala was containing quite a mouthful flavours. It's hard to resist to lick your fingers I must say. A delicate example of fine cooking. I suggest not to resist so much, let 'Aalishan' do the rest. ;)

A small place between many other restaurants in esplaned.not very crowded especially the 1st floor is really peaceful....

Food : As a dinner we ordered 4 plates cheese kabab.6 plates of chicken biriany 3 chicken bharta and firni...

Kabab : the cheese kabab was the chef's recommendation comes in 6 pieces in a plate.was taste was too good...

Biriany : It had the finger licking taste not much spicy and heavy....

Chicken Bharta : nice taste nd light....

Firni : nothing special....like others restaurants of kolkata.

Ambiance : ambiance was good ....not crowded at all....quite place for dinner...

Service : we booked a table 1 day prior....it was the birthday party of our friend...they service was lil bit show because of few staffs were there....but the incharge and the staffs both were good...

Price : not high and cheap too....comparable with the tastes of the dishes...

Nice experience and recommended....

Aalishan Restaurant,Located at the heart of Esplanade jst beside Paradise Cinema Hall. 

Alright so If you're planning for a sumptuous lunch this is not the place because you will perhaps not get what you desire.
Not a single starter was available n though we had initially ordered butter tandoori roti which they said would be avaible,but after 10 mins they informed that it wouldn't be available.. So had to order paratha which was the only thing available.
Chicken Bharta and Murg Tawa Masala was good in taste,pricing is reasonable, quantity is good..overall good  and fine.Also a suggestion do try their Hyderabadi Biryani,its quite popular though we didn't order.

But yes if you're going for lunch then only expect Biryani.

This restaurant, just beside paradise single screen movie hall, is a hidden gem of Kolkata. In the last month, we have ordered at least 4-5 times from this restaurant and there was not a single moment where we got disappointed with their food quality.
This place is famous for its North Indian food and mughlai items. The place looks a normal plain looking restaurant like another thousands in the city of joy.
But the food quality differs this place from any other restaurant including Arsalan and aminia. I know Arsalan lovers will not like this, but aalishan is simply way better than Arsalan, at least now a days.
I ordered variety of items every time, eg. Murg musallam, chicken achari tikka, tandoori butter masala, mutton boneless masala, mutton and chicken biryani, naan, kulcha, firni to name a few among others. Every one of my colleagues was thanking me for choosing the restaurant over Arsalan, the regular choice of Bengalis.
Murg musallam is an item which most restaurants don't even dare to try. It needs perfection at its best. These guys presented us with a big pot containing a whole chicken with cashew and raisin rich gravy. The taste was marvelous. Biryani is undoubtedly one of the best available in Kolkata right now. Tandoori butter masala and chicken achari masala were surprisingly good, given we had already consumed the murg musallam. Please do try at least the musallam, achari and kulcha if you plan to visit this restaurant or order from it.. in fact, the mutton dish was the usual gravy dish which we didn't like that much as others but it was good nonetheless.
The only disappointing part of this place is their service time. I waited for 45 minutes for 10 kulchas, though I agree that they were really yummy and soft and justified the time taken to some extent.
Pocket pinch is considerably lesser than its peers. A complete meal alongwith firni cost me only 2500 bucks for 9 people and we had biryani, musallam, achari everything in the menu.
Highly recommended... Cheers!!!!

Easy to locate. Situated just beside paradise cinema. I ordered mutton biriyani and garlic chicken kebab. But after 5 min, the waiter came and informed that kebab was not available so I ordered chicken reshmi kebab. The kebabs were well cooked and pretty good. The biriyani was just average in taste and quantity was okay. The service was great. Prices very affordable and another good thing waa they didn't charged tax.

Situated next to Paradise Cinema, Esplanade, this place is a paradise for food lovers. The restaurant has two floors, good service, good ambiance, clean interiors and most importantly, delicious food. Try getting a seat in the 1st floor. We ordered hyderabadi biryani, chicken butter masala and tandoori roti. Hyderabadi biryani was beyond our expectations. Quantity and quality both were great. The prices are surprisingly reasonable. The name "Aalishan" is justified well!

oh Jesus! perfect dine with the worst behavior experienced at here on Christmas eve. First when we reached there the manager told us sit here but there was no ac and no light.  So we choose a sit  at front but manager continuously  said why we sit here roughly. Without menu card he said what would you like to order.  If you treated like that then no one will come here again... Beside a group also told me that before us the manager also treated them same way. shame on you...
Now come to the food is very nice and good quantity.We ordered chicken biriyani, chicken tikka butter masala , tandoori roti.
I would recommended all you to visit here for food but if your first priority behavior then never.

One thing they have very few options if you opt for veg dishes.More veg dishes should be included in their menu.

Located on Bentick street, near Esplanade, this was the first time I had visited this eatery. The decorated and ambience is soothing.  The menu is quite extravagant. The show stealers are the Boneless Chicken Biriyani and the Mutton Keema Curry mainly because of the price.  

I had takeaway so can't describe much about service and staff.  But overall found it good.  My order was made available in the right time.  I was in a hurry and this sense of urgency and prioritising customers is highly appreciated. 

I had ordered the Mutton Biriyani and the Chicken tikka kebab.  The Biriyani was delicate and light and not the heavily spiced,  dalda drenched rice and meat concoction that is sold as Biriyani. Only one disappointment was that one of the packets of Biriyani had a very bad piece of mutton. 

Pricing is economical and service Is quick.  Overall a good experience.

Worst food and experience ever. We order chicken Tengri kabab and they serve spoiled chicken. After complaining about this they change it but that also rotten once. Ultimately we told them to serve main course. In main course we order biriyani. The rice of the biriyani was not properly cooked. I would like to suggest that don't went to this returant to waste your money.

A pretty place with cozy ambience,and good North India/Mughlai Cuisine...tats Aalishan summarized.....
The Place,when we went was almost empty,with one or two tables ocuupied probably bcz it was past lunch hour....

Coming to the food,we ordered Chicken Reshmi Kabab for starters...Decent sized kababs,soft BT could hv bn softer ,but tasted delicious..
For main course there was Butter Naan and Mutton Roganjosh..The Naan was quite soft and freshly baked BT I personally found the Roganjosh excess salty......Do try the Firni here...it's worth it...

The staff is very courteous and prompt and serving is way faster than lots of other places......its a pocket friendly joint...All that we ordered came neatly within 500 bucks....So since Esplanade Area has only a few pocket friendly yet good restaurants my advice wud be giving this place a try....

Would soon update on the Biriyani and other dishes at this place

Though it was a gamble, it came out to be a real hit.. I simply loved their chicken tikka masala n paneer butter masala... I would recommend u to have these two dishes..

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:
Esplanade area has got some very fine restos as well as it lacks restos in some locations. With the time taste of people and needs towards the food have rapidly changed. On this note this new opened resto is at Bentinck Street just beside Paradise cinema. Certainly not one the biggest and the best over here but this newly opened place is trying to get better in their food department.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF:
Ambiance is decent enough. Its nearly a 50-60 seater resto approx. With black chairs and glass tables. The bl;ack ply interiors looks good with the chairs. They have got two sections downstairs with non ac and the upper is ac. The best part is the menu prices are same for both. Staffs are very friendly and very polite.

FOOD:
We took the Chicken Biriyani and chicken reshmi butter masala for parcel after such tiring match at the eden gardens.
When the biriyani was packed it was cold, just the reshmi butter masala which was made at that point was hot.
it took 20 mins to reach home till then the cold got coolest. 
We opened the box  took it in the plates. The look of the biriyani was pleasing but the taste was a COMPLETE FAIL. The meat was also very pale. It was dry and hard, seemed it is kept for the entire day then served.
Chicken reshmi butter masala was thou a bit satisfactory but it was also very average. Mixing it with the biriyani couldnt make the biriyani worthy.

Briyani: 5/10
CRBM: 7/10

QNQ AND PRICES:
Quality was very average and quantity too. Prices are not upto the standards for what they are offering.

CONCLUSION:
It could happen we took the last set of biryani from them so it might happen they served us what they made in the evening. Still improvement is required because oufcourse we are paying for the food so we definetly need quality.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Went there this puja on 5mi... It was completely empty then. We were the only customers that time. Hence the staffs took special care of us. The interior decoration of the restro is very fine. Due to lack of time we could only had biriyani there. But eagerly waiting for a second visit here anytime soon.
Now coming to the quality and the quantity both of them were quite good. Price isalso very reasonable. Moreover they do not impose any extra vat...


Edited- recently had their chicken roll and i must say it is one of the best if not the best roll i have ever had... Everything about that roll from paratha, to chicken stuffings was perfect.. 
Love to have their rolls again and again....  😀😀😀
