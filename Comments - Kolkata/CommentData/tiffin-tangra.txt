Very very bad food and remarkably bad service. Simply wastage of time and money. We ordered one green tea, one sandwich, 2 toast and 2 cappuchino. After 30-40mins the boy came and told they cannot provide sandwich and toasts as there is no bread. And serve the green tea and cappuccino. The quality and test of the cappuchino is very bad.and the green tea was also bad. Strongly disappointed.

Ordered Chicken Tandoori Chicken Butter Masala, Garlic Naan and Amritsari Kulcha.

The Tandoori Chicken Butter was quite tasty and oil content was minimal. The Amritsari Kulcha was tender, but it was devoid of nuts. The Garlic Naan was not good at all. It seemed that chopped garlic was just sprinkled atop the Naan. The Garlic wasn't even roasted.

If one is searching for a place to hangout with friends or colleagues over tit bits or pocket friendly lunch, this is the apt place to hop in! The signature dish to try for is the Chicken Roll and the Thali during the afternoon. Also, added advantage is its Dhaba at Night! *wink*

Good place for evening snacks. The place has a good feel about it. A bit on the noisier side, it is more like the sophisticated dhaba types. Didnt get to order much for the first time, will surely experiment with the food.

Just discovered this awesome place to satisfy hunger without digging a hole in pocket or purse!
You can have a quick snaking just like I had, or you can pamper your tummy with heavy dose, choice is yours...
The rates are really reasonable, the decor is really peppy and eye friendly..
The hospitality of the staff is really admirable as they keep a concerned eye on customer satisfaction and take feedbacks for further betterment.
The taste of food gives a homely feeling and the proportion of flavours are perfect. At least I found them perfect in whatever I had.
They have an outdoor seating arrangement as well as a non AC dorm like arrangement. They have seating arrangements on the above floor as well.
I found it to be a perfect adda zone.

Been to tiffin today during lunch time since I had an office meeting nearby and couldn't find any other restaurant. I ordered their Amish Thali . Price was reasonable but food quality was pathetic. Was served tasteless paneer and one bland potato dish. Couldn't eat it all because of the taste. Had to sit in the non-AC section since the upper was closed for some reason. 

Overall a bad experience.

Small cute outlet with affordable food. A much needed place in EM bypass. They don't have a lot of finger foods/cafe food. They serve Indian meal mostly. They are quiet slow and laid back, should work on bettering they service. Coffee was okay. The place looks quite good but food and service is not the way it should be. We ordered Chicken Bharta, rotis and coffee. It was just alright.

This is a real small joint almost at the crossing of Topsia on the left near Biswakarma building. The first floor is AC section, but when we went, it was closed for maintenance. Surpsisingly, they made a killer egg devil@ 40/- and a nice dhaba-wali chai. The mala tikka, which I took for home, was soft and tasty and also pretty value for money. I didn;t like the dry chilly chicken, hence........ Overall, a nice pocket-friendly place.

This place is located at Topsia More,opposite Trinity Tower. I was there once and had lunch. Food was good and price was reasonable too. Ordered fried rice and chilly chicken. Taste was awesome. Their cutting chai are perfect for tea lover. They have proper sitting arrangement with two sections, AC and Non AC. Staff behaviour was good and service was fast too.

Tiffin is located close to topsia More, Opposite Porche showroom. Owned by Ambuja Neotia and aimed at serving quick meals to the working executives at affordable prices, this good joint looked promising in terms of cleanliness,  staff efficiency and decor. I liked a specially done wall where they have all kinds of Tiffin boxes painted in different colours and fixed 

The menu have interesting headings such as chaa Kafee thanda,  Niramish thali and Amish thali of the day. Two sets of menu bundled in one. During the day 9 morning to 7 pm and 7 Pm onwards to midnight,  it boasts of popular dishes such as Palak matter Makai,  Paneer butter Masala, Biryanis,  fried rice and many other Chinese and Indian delicacy.

We along with our team, checked in at the restaurant at around 1.30 Pm and they have the ground level almost occupied, which is a Non AC section. We were directed to the first floor which is AC equipped. Water and menu cards served promptly. 

We ordered paneer butter masala,  Dal makhni with choices of breads. Though food took time to arrive but taste was good. 

Worth visiting once for the sheer price and value for money factor.

This restaurant is located near topsia more, opposite the Porsche show room. it's a two storeyed building. The first floor is AC, and the ground floor is non-ac. We went to the first floor. This place is beautifully decorated. I simply loved the ambiance. The candy crush themed decoration on the wall was unique! The staffs‚Äã were courteous.

Now coming to the food. We ordered tandoori chicken and cappuccino first. Both were good. Nothing extraordinary. Then we wanted to order some main courses. So the waiter told us about the newly added Chinese section, which wasn't printed on the menu. We ordered chicken fried rice and chilli Chicken combo. Both items were nice, not too spicy. Price was reasonable.
Overall, had a great experience.

We went there for dinner last night. It was around 9:50pm when we arrived, and even though it was near to my place, it was my first time coming to this place. The food was nothing but ordinary and I found nothing special. We ordered for one americano, green tea, butter naan, paneer butter masala and chicken bharta for two. Like I said, ordinary food but the service was a bit too much. I understood the server was trying to be nice and polite but I felt like we didn't get our own personal space. Nevertheless, it was nice.

It's a reasonably priced restaurant but the quantity of food is a little less. 
I've eaten the Chicken butter masala and mushroom masala here. It was nice. The Ambience is nice and all in all of was a good experience.

Read about it in News Paper when it was Launched. Happened to be near it for some work and spotted it. Tiffin being part of the Ambuja group, I started feeling hungry.

Immediately went their and chose to sit at first floor, the Air conditioned Service Area with around 20% higher prices than the self service open area.

Visit 1 :We ordered Mushroom, Garlic Naan and Phulkopir Singara.

Mushroom Masala was pieces of Mushroom in Garlic Spicy Gravy . You get good taste of Mushroom with Gravy complimenting it.

Garlic Naan was a full size naan cut in multiple pieces topped with Garlic & Butter,cooked perfectly.

Singara was OK.

Food was served in Good Quality Plastic Cutlery with water in Hard Plastic Disposable Glasses.

Pricing was pocket friendly with prices mentioned inclusive of Taxes. Thumbs up to the management.

Visit 2:

Needed an Excuse to visit, time was of High Tea. Sat in the self service area on ground floor.

Ordered Cutting Chai with Chana Batura and Veg Sandwich.

Chana Batura: Though the Batura was good, chana served was like Pindi Chana, completely dry and spicy.

Cutting Chai was good. Better than most of other places and just for 11 RS. My friend, who chose to taste 1 sip from my cup ended having 2 cups inspite of being Diabetic.

Veg Sandwich was OK.

Visit 3:

Lunch time, near to Tiffin, where else to go.

Ordered Veg Thali at self service area which was full and had to line up for my Thali.

Thali consisted of  Potato Veg, Mix Veg, Dal, Rice, Roti, Sweet and Pickle.

Tasted like home food without much spices. Quantity enough for one person.

Visit 4: Waiting for an Excuse or work in that area üòÅ

Good Quality food at very reasonable prices with Seating space, This would be best place on my list.

I am quite fond of places that serve comfort food at comfort prices, I went there with less than 500 bucks in my pocket and came out thoroughly satisfied.There are two levels in this eateria/cafe/takeway joint. The ground floor is Non-AC. The meal is dhabaesque, ambience and decor quirky cool and service quick and clean. Located next to The Grid, I suggest you get your tipple in The Grid and have dinner here......Much love to this place ü§óü§óü§ó

Ive ordered a couple of times on home delivery from here. Its more to say a very average kind of food with an average pricing. They have not kept their pricing too steep nor do they commit a very outlandish taste. I feel that at the level which they intend to be, the quality and taste of food here does outweigh the pricing. ¬†i mean comeon, where in Kolkata can u get a decent n hygienic quality luchi aloodum at Rs 31.¬†
Keep up the good work team Tiffin.

It opened as a respite for the ones who work in and around this location but soon after, I guess everyone  have realised it's worth ! Extremely pricey for the kind of food they offer. The food is nothing great. The Biriyani is tasteless, the sandwiches are too costly for the amount they provide (note: they do not even have sandwich breads and so, they make use of the regular brown breads). The only thing which me and my colleagues like here is their cutting chai ! 

I hope they lessen the prices a bit for the kind of quality they offer. Also, the menu should have more options.
