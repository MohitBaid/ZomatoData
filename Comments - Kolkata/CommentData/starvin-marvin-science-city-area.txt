I had to specifically come here and write this special review to admire the sheer cheat of a restaurant this place is . Apparently after landing back from a late night flight I decided to go forward and order from this joint . Sadly 1:50 minutes down after placing my order and already requesting for a earlier than usual delivery , I end up being told by the restaurant later that they have a shortage of delivery boys and that it will be done soon . Wow . Kudos to the amazingly poor service . I can't imagine I have to go hungry because of such casual behaviour.

Delivery needs some improvement. But the food made up for it. It was worth the wait. 
The food was well packed and still warm.
The steamed momos, surprisingly, did not get soggy. They were very tasty.
I also loved the Starvin Marvin Murgh Cheese Kebab.
Paneer Tikka was okayish.
The Pizza Naan was sooo good. The sides were oozing out cheese.
Butter Naan, Dal Makhni were good too.
Kalakand Cheesecake ending on a sweet note.

This place serves very unique and tasty food.The combination of their recipies can never go wrong!
We ordered in from here: 
Being a Momo lover I have obviously ordered Chicken Momo,Cheese Chicken Kebab,Paneer Tikka for starters.
We had steemed Rice, Kachalonka Murgi, Mutton Rara,Veg Pulao, Pizza Naan in the main Course

The best thing is that this place is opened till 5am in the morning and also delivers in South Kolkata :)
For it's unique combination of food,I will highly recommend this place for all the foodies.

This is a delivery joint that serves you well all through the night until 5am...so this joint is a savior for late night hunger pangs..though it takes a bit more time in the delivering process and has no seating available.
Also keep in mind to order a bit early as they served as almost 2hrs hence the given time
Some of the very good dishes that made us super happy were
#green chilli chkn:this one was pan fried chilli chkn which was too good and the color came out to be green which was unique in a way.the pieces were impressive and tender too.
# paneer Tikka kebab: this one was okayish
Main course:
#patiala murgh:this one came with a thick gravy that tasted good but the chkn could have been more tender
#kancha lonka murgi:this was a green chkn curry and not to worry it wasn't super hot...rather it was good and meat was tender
#butter naan:this was a large and soft one
#plain rice: perfectly made one
Dessert:
Kalakand Cheesecake:this one is sure to lift the mood
A good place to try out!!

This place pretty good as far as delivery joints go. They deliver food from noon to 5am in the morning, which is a real savior. 
Delivery however, was slow the one time I ordered. I ordered : 
Chicken Steam Momo : Generously filled but arrived cold, otherwise enjoyable. 
Chicken Cheese Kebab : This is the real deal. Succulent pieces of chicken slathered in gorgeous cheese sauce. Loved it. 
Murgh Patiyala : Well cooked chicken in a nice creamy gravy. 
Kancha Lonka Murgi : Really spicy and has that green chilly kick. Really good. 
Butter naan : Soft, buttery naan, also arrived cold, but stayed soft, which was awesome. 
Kalakand cheesecake : Really unique invention. Kalakand sandesh on buttery biscuit crust. Surprisingly good. 
Overall, a really good joint for delivery. Would definitely try again.

Starvin' Marvin is located in Science City Area and they delivers to your door till five in the morning,isn’t it great?Yes,and the foods are qualitatively amazing.We ordered  variety of dishes from that place last day.

In starter,Starvin' Marvin Cheese Kabab was over the top,it’s soft and terrific in taste,highly recommended of them.

Abul Chilli Kabab was also impressive and little different in taste,a must try.

Chicken Steam Momo was also enjoyable.

In main course,Patiyala Murgh was mouthwatering and delicious with the Butter Naan.

Kacha Lanka Murghi is one of the highly recommended of them,it’s excellent in taste and lipsmacking.One can try it with Steam Rice.

In dessert,Kolakand Cheesecake is a special and interesting item of them,it’s yummy and wonderful.

This joint is a must try if you want to enjoy quality food by sitting at home even it’s late night.

Starvin' Marvin - a door to happiness.

It's another great lip-smacking food home delivery joint based place. Too lazy to go out? Wanna have some lip-smacking delicious food? Having major craving at night? Well dont worry for Starvin' Marvin is all set to serve you hot delicious food at your doorstep. Contact them on this number +91 8420442222. They are open till 5 AM. Also, what’s better than enjoying all of that goodness delivery food at your home in the comfort of your couch, a snuggle blanket, and Netflix?

Now lets talk about what I had. 

STARTERS :

1) Chicken Steam Momo 

2) Starvin' Marvin Murgh Cheese Kebab 

3) Abu Chilli Kebab 

Starvin' Marvin Cheese Murgh Kebab is an excellent starter, which melts in mouth like butter and cheese tastes amazing when served with garlic sauce, green chutney and vegetable salad. Abu Chilli Kebab had a wonderful taste which tasted spicy and flavourful.

MAIN COURSES :

1) VEG Pulao 

2) Pizza Naan

3) Dal Makhani

4) Kancha Lanka Murgi 

Pizza Naan tasted out of this world. It was mine most favorite dish and I loved it so much. Kancha Lanka Murgi is a popular bengali murgh dish flavored with lots of Green Chilies.The smell is different, yet amazing.

DESSERTS :

1) Kalakand Indian Style Cheese Cake : Tasted heavenly. It has Indian sweet flavors of Kalakand which gels very well and balances with the sourness.Ah! I'm drooling right now at the thought of these. A perfect way to end a perfect meal. 

The delivery is very prompt and the quality as well of the quantity were a value for money. Also, the packaging is top notch. Highly recommended place. Do give it a try. 

I'm looking forward to dropping in here again!

So tonight we happened to order from this joint. Which I came to know about recently. They specialize in Indian cuisine, and they're pretty good with it.
We ordered for their special murgh cheese kebab (must try),  green chilli chicken, steamed Momos, and Abu chilli kebab(must try) and paneer tikka for starters. They delivered it steaming hot to my place which is pretty far from their joint. So things up to that. 
For mains, we settled for steamed rice, veg pulao, pizza naan (must try), and butter naan as Staples. 
And daal makhni , patiala murgh, kancha lonka murgi as sides. For desserts my choice was the kalakaand cheesecake. 

This stays open till 5am, and ready to deliver good food to your doorstep. Hurry!

Ordered chicken fried rice and chilly babycorn at midnight on Sunday. Instead of chicken fried rice I got egg fried rice and instead of crispy babycorn what I got was soggy babycorn cause they took 2 hrs to deliver the food. When I called the restaurant the chef was so rude. All over pathetic experience and never going to order from this place.

We ordered several times from this place. The food served was of quite good quality. But on ordering multiple times I guess they decided to fool us. The portions were considerably reduced, the food looked slimy and not appetising enough. The major complaint is regarding the bills they issue. Firstly, its not authentic because there is no mention of the restaurant anywhere neither is there a mark that the bill is for this restaurant. On reaching out to them, they promised to get back to us but all in vain. We still got no response whatsoever. Neither were the bills stamped. We want someone to respond and get the bills stamped urgently. This is highly disappointing. Look into this matter asap.

A delicious menu of Starving Marvin-
Now a days we often hangout with our dear once and prefer to eat outside.But sometimes we would like to eat food at home.Keeping on this in mind various home delivery joints are gradually opening every corner of the City."Starvin' Marvin" is newly open food joint to satisfied our test buds.I have visited there earlier with Rajdeep Bhattacharjee.Their service was so good with a great welcome.Homely ambiance and hospitality.This food joint is located at 159B, Metropolitan Co-operative Housing Society, Ground Floor, Near Bypass Dhaba, Kolkata, West Bengal 700105.Now a days most of the people tend to work at night shifts for them this joint is life saver.The service time of this food joint is 11:45AM to 5AM.They serve North Indian,Italian as well as Chinese dishes.Different types of dishes are served here.

After visited this joint I tasted some delicious foods,like-

Chocolate Shake-At first we welcomed with tasty chocolate shake. It can be made by mixing chocolate syrup(or chocolate powder) with milk (from cows, goats, soy, rice, etc.). It can be purchased pre-mixed with milk or made at by blending milk with cocoa powder and a sweetener (such as sugar or a sugar substitute), melted chocolate, chocolate syrup, or a pre-made powdered chocolate milk mix. Other ingredients, such as starch, salt, carrageenan, vanilla, or artificial flavoring are sometimes added.
Chicken Sate-This is a delicious starter which is grilled for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until meat is cooked through and has light grill marks. Serve chicken skewers with Peanut Dipping Sauce, and garnish with basil or cilantro and chopped peanuts.

Green Chicken-This is made with chicken pieces with pudina and corriender.Tastes really good.
Special Biriyani-They made a smoky flavor biriyani which taste different and really good.

Mutton Rezala-This is a popular recipe made with mutton pieces marinated with nuts and coconut.This dish goes well with nun and paratha,
Dal Makhani-This is a authentic Punjabi dish made with various types of dal. The primary ingredients are whole black lentil (urad), red kidney beans (rajma), butter and cream. The dish gets its richness from the use of cream, however, it can also be prepared with yogurt, milk or no dairy.

Egg Moong-This is a signature dish of this food joint made with moong dal with egg.
Naan-Naan is a leavened, oven-baked flatbread[1] found in the cuisines of Central Asia and South Asia.Nun goes well with  gravy dishes.Pizza naan is one of their specialties.
Gulab Jamun-Gulab jamun is a milk-solid-based South Asian sweet, particularly popular in the Indian subcontinent, notably India, Nepal (where it is known as lal mohan), Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as Myanmar. It is also common in Mauritius, Fiji, southern and eastern Africa, Malay Peninsula, and the Caribbean countries of Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname and Jamaica. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from freshly curdled milk. It is often garnished with dried nuts like almonds to enhance flavour.This is a perfect dessert for the end of any dishes.

Raita-Raita is a common name of a condiment from the Indian subcontinent, made with dahi together with raw or cooked vegetables, more seldom fruit, or in the case of boondi raita, with fried droplets of batter made from besan.A good dessert for digestion and it tasty really good.

Chocolate tandoori with cherry on top-This is anathor signature dish made with tandoori  with spreaded chocolate and cherry.
This is my first experience with Starvin' Marvin.I tasted their Chinese cuisine in Panchphoron's annual group meeting where they served delicious Chinese dishes for our dinner.
They prepared four different dishes-one rice,one noodle and two types of side dishes.All the dishes  packed perfectly with plastic box and send to us.The non-veg chicken dish is a perfect blend of spices and the veg dish is also good in taste.The dishes we tried are,

Veg Fried Rice-A dish of cooked rice that has been stirred fry in a wok or frying pan mixed with lots of vegetables like beans,carrots,capsicum and chillies.It has less oil which makes it healthy and tasty.

Veg Hakka Noodles-Prepared on a high flame continuously cook a toss process.Various types of chopped vegetables cooked with spices.Before serving garnish with chopped vegetables and spring onoions.
Hot Garlic Chicken-s a sweet, deep-fried chicken dish that is served in North American Chinese restaurants.It content:

Sauce: soy sauce, rice wine, rice-wine vinegar, sugar,[10] cornstarch, dried red chili peppers (whole), garlic.
Batter/breading: egg, cornstarch.
Dish: Broccoli, chicken dark meat (cubed).
This is a tasty Chinese dish goes well with rice.
Sliced vegetables with Hot Garlic Sauce-Various types of vegetables like-broccoli,carrot,onion are sliced and use in a gravy.The gravy is slightly sweet in taste.Not so thick but taste is extremely good.

We enjoyed these dishes very much.The quallity and quantity both are so good.Stravin' Marvin a must have place to try the various dishes.This dishes also pocket friendly than anyone can effort and enjoy the food.I would like to thank the owner and entire managment of Sravin' Marvin.All the very very best.Thank you Rajdeep Bhattacharjee and the team panchphoron.

This takeaway is just about 500m from my place. I have been meaning to order from here for quite sometime, but some of the negative reviews on Zomato kept me thinking otherwise. Anyway, i finally risked ordering yesterday and boy, I was so thankful to my intuition that I did!

I had ordered one Starvin' Marvin Murg Cheese Kabab and half Tandoori Murg, as evening snack for two people. The taste of the food was just mind blowing. The six pieces of melting cheese-wrapped kebabs were just otherworldly. Soft, cheesy and full of that tangy signature tandoor taste, it's bound to fulfill your tastebuds' wildest fantasies. It's as good as Arsalan's. The Tandoori Murg needs special mention here because unlike most other random restaurants serving tandoori chicken, this one was juicy and well-cooked and not skewered dry. I hate that kind of tandoori chicken which has been left in the grill for so long that it becomes charred, bland, dry n hard. But this one was just roasted to perfection, with the right amount of spicy gravy smeared all over it and the juicy flesh was all teeming with flavours.

Overall it was an absolutely fantastic experience. The delivery took a little long, considering I stay so close by. But then that was because the food was freshly prepared after the order was placed, and that was very evident from the food quality. The packaging was perfect too, with no messy spillage and included sufficient amount of the green chutney that's a must with kebabs. This, in my opinion, is highly recommended to those who are craving a nice meal in the evening and even in the odd hours of the night.

Starvin’ Marvin- the newest home delivery joint to fulfill your hunger pangs at odd times of the day. Home delivery joints are nowadays life saviors during the hunger pangs at odd hours; the situation then is such that neither do we want to or have the time to cook, nor do we have the time to go out and eat. Voila!! here comes your rescuer- Starvin’ Marvin a hidden gem which has opened it’s doors recently for the foodies of Kolkata. Being located is a busy area like science city has already given it the advantage of exposure to large number of people. The main reasons why i’m referring to it as a hidden gem are:
                                                                ...

Starvin’ Marvin is the new entry to the list of home delivery food joints in Kolkata. Now a day we can find many home delivery joints here and there, but only few actually manage to create the charm and live up to expectations, and Strvin’ Marvin surely one of them. The place delivers mouth-watering Chinese, North Indian, Italian cuisines at a very pocket friendly price. Recently we (Team #Panchphoron) gathered for a group discussion, in our club house at Salt-lake and we decided to order dinner from Starvin’ Marvin. The delivery was quick and convenient. The packing was also nicely done. We ordered Veg Fried Rice, Veg Hakka Noodles, Hot Garlic Chicken and Sliced Vegetables in Hot Garlic Sauce. Quality and quantity both were very satisfactory. Coming to the foods,

Veg Fried Rice- Nicely cooked with lots of veggies, had a smoky flavour, taste was superb. Try it with any gravy preparation as per your choice. 

Veg Hakka Noodle- Noodles tossed with different types veggies and the different spices. It was not oily, perfectly cooked yummy noodle preparation. The best side option for this dish will be Hot Garlic Chicken. 

Hot Garlic Chicken- This preparation was simply delicious. Medium pieces of boneless chicken marinated with different spices and dipped into a batter and fried perfectly in oil and the added into a spicy, thick garlic flavoured gravy and cooked for some time. Different types of spices, sauce and sliced bell pepper added into it to make it more delicious. Chicken cooked very nicely and the preparation was fingerlicking. A perfect side dish option. 

Sliced Vegetables in Hot Garlic Sauce- Another delicious veg option. It was very good in taste not very spicy, yet very delicious. Different types of fresh vegetables boiled nicely and added into a garlic flavoured gravy. It was perfectly cooked. Try it with any noodles or rice preparation. 

The dishes we had were really good in taste and cooked perfectly. Just try it sometime. They have a decent size menu and they deliver in late night also. My best wishes for them and . Happy eating everyone. Good Food Feel Good.

This is the first time ever any Food Blogging Group has got their own Club-Room with fully furnished modern amenities to chill out whenever they want.

As a team, we met...We chilled out...We had fun...And all these were incomplete without Good Food...

And #StarvinMarvin helped us with good food delivered to our door-step.

You can also order from Starvin Marvin..They are one of the new born delivery outlet babies of this city of joy. And for those who have their night shift in office and very often think, from where they can order; Starvin Marvin is there to give your tummy a better treat.

Last but not the least thank you Rajdeep da for gifting #US this #ClubRoom... 

We had :

Veg Fried Rice : This is a very known dish to all of us, but the thing that I liked the most was the quantity and the smokey flavor of the dish.

Sliced Vegetables in Garlic Sauce : According to me this was the show stopper of all the dishes that they sent. I just LOVED it. From the name itself you can understand, there were so many sliced vegies like - Zucchini, Bell-Peppers, Cauliflower, corn....The taste was a bit sweeter but the garlic flavor added the actual zest.

Veg Hakka Noodles : hakka noddles is basically dry noodles fried with some vegetables. 

Hot Garlic Chicken : This dish is particularly supposed to be spicy with garlic flavor. But I didn't find anything extra to this particular dish..This could be better.

But anyways, as I work late at night, I'll definitely order from here again and again.

I'am a foodie and I'm a Panch phoron forever. #am2pmFood

i cant actually review the food because i rejected the food. if the delivery is delayed so much there is no point in giving such option to this restaurant. it lives up to the name Starvin' Marvin by keeping their customers "Starving"

Awesome food and nice service. I loved the pizza naan, Dal makahni and the mutton raara. Also I liked the idea of them calling me the next day for feedback. Keep it up.

Had a good experience when we ordered food from here last night. The chicken tikka masala was very tasty and the masala kulcha was great. The delivery took around 45mins, which was fair enough given the rain outside. The management even called me for feedback and the service was very satisfying.

Loved the food especially their chinese section. Had ordered for Tomyum soup, pan fried chilli fish and mixed pan fried noodles. All were great. I would only suggest them to improve the packaging of the soup as it was a bit leaky. Other than that i would just suggest team STARVIN MARVIN to keep rocking!!!

I ordered Paneer Makhanwala.It tasted good but the service was poor food got delivered after almost 30-40 minutes.The restaurant needs to work on delivering food on time.Ordered momos yesterday and they literally had bones.Tasted horrible plus it took a long time after the estimated time of delivery to arrive.

Ordered rumali roti which was very good but the two chicken dishes were disappointing.for starters please mention the number of pieces u provide per plate so we can order accordingly.but apart from that the butter chicken was ok with small pieces and the Tikka masala had two pieces with over dose of methi and salt.

I ordered for 4 masala kulcha- something we really loved from here because of its texture and filling. Extremely disappointed because it was under cooked, raw, hard and inedible.

Ordered for Dal Makhani and it was full of oil and less of dal.
The staff reached with no change. The bill amounted to ₹370 and he did not have change of ₹500.

Expected a lot more because of the first time experience. Turned out to be a complete disaster in the 2nd order.

1.Pathetic food first impression
2.Ordered butter in tandoori roti paid 10 rupees extra got nothing and roti was like tearing leather
3. Oily like they get oil for free in store
4. Packaging- below average when received all got messed up nyways leaving that aside
5. Food - negative/5
Nyways have far better food in different outlets which are currently online at night
If anyone in the management does read this please note please improve everything this is not how you should cheat or deliver food
THANK YOU

Here's a picture of a cheese paratha I ordered from this restaurant which had no 'cheese' in it . Charging Rs. 85/- for this piece of undercooked dough isn't worth it.

Pathetic services, order food at midnight, got the delivery at dawn. No management. Completely disgusted experience. Will never suggest any one to order food from here. No care of emotions and feelings of people either. No sense of responsibilities either. And the food qualities also sucks. Too mch oily. Yuks..

Home delivery is a complete disaster. It's currently two hours after the delivery time, three hours after the order was placed. Zomato, predictably, keeps BSing me that the order is going to be here in five minutes. They've said this so many times in the chat that I've lost count, stretching back to two hours ago. The restaurant now claims they sent it out half an hour ago and that the delivery guy is stuck in traffic. Neither Zomato nor the restaurant has an explanation for why the order was sent out two hours after it should have been sent out. Nor can the restaurant explain how "pujo traffic" caused him to not send the order out till an hour and a half after the delivery time. Every time I come back to Zomato for a delivery order, I regret it. Every. Single. Time. Zomato's given me yet another credit, another apology, and told me to come post this review, since that's the only option I have. What difference does it make? I'm giving up and just taking the bike out to a dhaba. Do *not* order from these guys if it's late at night and you're hungry, or you will end up with no food hours later and no other places open.

One of the most worst restaurant in kolkata . The manager dosnt know how to speak with the customer . I Ordered chicken pasta they have given me veg pasta . Nd whn i complained he abused me amd told me i am a drunkered . I dnt expect such kind of restaurant to be there  in zomato . Nd even before hand i called him and requested him not to call on the number which is regestered in zomato as my mom is in hospital hu is using that number . But they ignored nd called my mom up and disturbed her when i complained he was using abusing terms . I request zomato team to delist this restaurant from its list as it is not capable of being on the list

An all night delivery joint. They have a decent sized menu at pocket friendly prices.  Delivery was quick and convenient. My order comprised of Veg steam momos and paneer roll.  The packaging is very basic with the momos arriving in aluminium foil container and the roll wrapped in aluminium foil. The momos though as the name suggest is veg momo it has crushed cottage cheese inside too which didn't go very well with me. The momos are thin and perfectly steamed.  Momo sauce needs to be worked upon.  The paneer roll is not a Kathi roll but a rumali Roti roll. It has cilantro chutney inside too which might offend some.  Paneer peices are huge and the roll is more than sufficiently sized.  Overall a good experience but packaging still needs to be worked upon.

Ordered from this restaurant for a dinner at office. 

The delivery was on time. The food receive was warm enough. 

Packaging: 3/5
Chicken butter masala: I doubt if it had butter. The flavour was clearly lacking and the chicken was all bones. Terrible. 1/5

Paneer Tikka masala: The dish was okayish. Tasted decent. Portion was good enough with 4 medium sized paneer pieces. 3.5/5

Roomali roti: The rotis were divided into three parts for easy eating. 

The restaurant must ensure that they provide the chicken without the bones.
