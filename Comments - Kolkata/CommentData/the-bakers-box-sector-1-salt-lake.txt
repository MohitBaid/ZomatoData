The packaging did nt have the cheese bun and I ordered it , had to ask zomato for a refund . The pasta was poorly packed a bigger container could have been used rather than filling it up till the brim . Was expecting much more .

I won't beat much around the bush. I ordered this pretty looking customized red velvet cake for 2 days back for my biryhday. Initially I was very very sceptical as this is only a homegrown bakery and I was placing the order on WhatsApp and for the very first time experimenting, one can say. Generally, I pick my cakes from Cakes and Kookie Jars. But I needed my customisation this time. So, I thought let's see what it unfolds! While placing the order I was not really sure if they were getting my specifications, also what if they don't remember the date or call it off last min. I just duly paid the advance and although I could just paytm the amount, I visited them to pay it. I met the owner and I was assured. As promised the cake was delivered on right date and time! And about how the cake was? I am placing another order with them for Sept for my mom's birthday.

Doing office works since morning..got some cheesy craving in the afternoon ;)
Ordered chilli cheese toast and rum balls. They were really nicely packed.
The toast was really nice, the best part being they didn't use chilli but instead they used soft capsicums which have a wonderful aromatic flavor and there was sufficient cheese also
The rum balls were soft and fresh, I generally don't like rum balls much but these were really nice.
I have cut 0.5 points coz the order arrived after 40mins of placing the order
Truly recommended !!

Ps. I had exactly half of the original quantity and have then clicked the picture ;) so the original amount was double of what u can see in the images below.

Ordered blueberry cheese cake for a sudden cheesecake craving. The packaging is innovative but inconvenient in small glass jar. They should provide a spoon tht fits. Tasted very average.

I ordered a red velvet tea cake and a blueberry cheesecake. Starting off with the good, the red velvet cake was really good. They customized how they would bake the cake as per my request and used oats as well. The red velvet cake was really good. The cheesecake was decent. It was mostly heavy cream mixed with blueberry and a good crust in a jar. If you like baked cheesecakes, this won't cut it. Overall, a good delivery experience.

Having read all the fab reviews on Zomato regarding this place decided to order their Chocolate Crepe via Zomato.
Delivery was prompt enough and the food reached more or less on time.
The crepe had been packed well in a plastic box with the name of the bakery stuck on it in pretty pink.
It looked like a long roll, with a soft smooth filling of dark chocolate.
HOWEVER, I was utterly disappointed because the crepe emanated a stale smell that made it almost difficult to consume it. Had expected a better offering from such a popular establishment.

Baker's box is my go-to place for home deliveries. From Mediterranean to Italian to Oriental cuisines, they provide a wide range of options to choose from. Whether it's breads I want to pick or order a full-fledged meal they have it all. Their dessert menu is quite tempting as well. My personal favourite remains creme brûlée. Another recommendation would be red velvet cupcakes. So anyone looking for yummilicious sweets/savouries to be delivered at your doorstep, this is a must tryout.

I ordered from here once before for my cousins birthday and this time I called for my parents 25th anniversary cake. This was the first time they made this sort of a cake with so much of customization and did a wonderful job. Since we don't like fondant they made the entire thing in chocolate truffle and chocolate ganache with minimal usage of fondant for decoration. The chocolate they used was of very good quality and the taste was very good...not too creamy and not too dry. Thank you baker's box for the wonderful cake and cupcakes. Keep trying new things!

Being a foodie by nature the 1st thing that caught me was the menu. Fabulous picks!
The broccoli tikkas and cheese samosas where just perfect and soothing to the taste buds. Me and my family totally enjoyed the hi-tea and bonding over these snacks. And to end the perfect evening we had the perfect dessert to indulge in, Death by Chocolate. Thanks Prerna for making our family hi-tea so complete with super tasty food!
Cant wait to pick some more yummy stuff from you sooooon!

Recently, I was appointed the official Food Critic of Tastes of India (ToI), the biggest food carnival in Kolkata, which was held from 25 to 26 February 2017 at Nalban Food Park.

The Bakers Box was one of the participants there.

I opted to taste their Cheese Samosa and Red Velvet.

Cheese Samosa: I was required to wait a bit to get my share of this medium sized fusion snack, as it was deep fried right in front of my eyes.

It was well cooked, cheesylicious and tasted extremely nice.

Beware of the utter hot molten cheese inside and eat it with caution, in small bites.

Red Velvet: It comprised of a mini sized red velvet cupcake with an almost equal sized cream cheese topping. The cupcake tasted average, but the melt in the mouth topping tasted quite nice.

Ran into The Bakers box at the SLURP AND BURP CARNIVAL at nalban food park on the 25th Feb, 2017. They had set up a booth in there. Tried the Khowsuey. Must say that it was perhaps one of the worst khowsuey I have come across in my entire life. No taste, no flavour , inadequate ingredients provided along with takeaway !

Sweetness revamped @ The Baker’s Box..!

Kolkata and its inseparable affinity for sweets has been intrinsically related. With time Rosogollas may have been replaced by chocolate tarts, but the sweet tooths of Kolkata crave for great dessert parlours. One of the newest baby in the food map of Kolkata is The Baker’s Box. At The Bakers Box, they supply the most basic of cakes to custom made creations. The Baker’s Box also serve delectable savoury and sweet platters. The Baker’s Box is a brain child of Mrs. Prerna Churiwal, an entrepreneur who started baking at quite an early age to make her dream come true. And thus The Baker’s Box with its amazing bakes- baked cakes, muffins and savouries is indeed a hot seller.
            

Location : Situated near the Saltlake Swimming Pool,  the address reads CF 318, Sector 1 , Salt Lake.

Wallet factor : A good 300 INR is great for two people.

Food : An irresistible dessert corner with a wide range of options – savouries, cakes, muffins, tarts. You just got to wish for it.

​In the last few years, Kolkata has seen a number of home bakers coming up to the food scene. And these days the home bakers ain’t any less popular than the proper bakeries. One such places I’ve come across recently is ‘The Baker‘s Box‘. The mastermind behind this project is Prerna Churiwal. She has her office close to Salt Lake Swimming Pool, which is exclusively for delivery and takeaways. I was invited here for a bloggers meet. We were served an array of items, starting from savouries to pastries. Let’s take a briefing on the ones I tasted at The Baker‘s Box.
                                                                ...

The Baker's Box - served us a very good English breakfast for 35 persons early in the morning in central Kolkata at predesignated time, at a very short notice.
The food was very well presented and immaculate.
Kudos to the team . Looking forward to using their services  in future also :)

Let’s not beat around the bush and give a flowery introduction as if someone is going to evaluate me on this piece! To put things straight, I am NOT very fond of sweet dishes or desserts, in general. So when I am taking the pain to review a joint which primarily produces cakes and desserts, it clearly means there is some spark in their dishes which interested me. The Baker’s Box has a Home Baker kinda setup in Saltlake Sector-1 area, though this place is a rented out property only for the purpose of baking and cooking, it’s not typically a residence. You can expect home deliveries from this place; also you can opt for take-aways after making prior appointments and placing your orders in advance. I have come across couple of home bakeries / eateries across the city that can better be termed as disasters, but not this one. So I was pretty skeptical before visiting this place and hoped the offerings would suit my palate. In fact, I was invited by the owner, Mrs.Prerna Churiwal and I had several bloggers and reviewers from Panchphoron food bloggers group along with me for this food tasting session. We reached the address later in the afternoon and I realized the place might be bit tricky to locate for a person not so familiar with the locality.

Baker's Box is a newly opened catering and bakery service in Salt Lake area which is doing a pretty good job in the recent times. I would like to thank Mrs. Prerna Churiwal for sending me over a box of delicious goodies to try and fill myself up with joy.
The packaging was pretty good. The box was elegant and I loved the items in it as well.
Strawberry Cheesecake - This was a dessert in a jar. The jar contained two layers of cream, strawberries and a layers of crushed cookies. It was excellent. The cream was thick and had a distinct flavour of strawberries. A perfect delight to cheer you up!
Blueberry Cheesecake - Another excellent dessert. Similar was of presentation. Devoured the layers humongously. Only suggestion is the compote could have been thicker.
Nutella Centre-filled Muffins - This was fantastic. Loved the simultaneous fudgy and cakey texture of this muffin. The Nutella oozing out created all the drama. Had a delicious frosting on top which made the cake even better. Definitely recommended.
Molten Lava Cake - This was more of an amateurish kind. It was a good as they are trying it newly but need to work upon it a bit.
Chocolate Chip Cookies - The cookies are pretty good. A bit salty by the taste, contains chunks of choco chips inside which is an absolute delightful thing. You just need to order it from them.
Baker's Box, being a new venture in the city of joy is doing a pretty good job. Love the way how they are presenting themselves. The desserts and cakes are pretty good actually. Interested to try out the Indian, Chinese and Continental items from here as well. Best wishes to the team and also a big thank you to Mrs Prerna Churiwal. Happy Dining! :)

So basically I ended the year 2016 on a really sweet note. Being invited to The Baker's Box was such a delight. So, this was a Panchphoron event on the 31st of Dec and I happily accompanied my foodie friends to taste the delicacies of The Baker's Box!

About the location, you lost me there. It's near salt lake sector 1 and after that the GPS is my saviour.

This place has no seating arrangement and will cater to your orders via home delivery. Oh such a delight to sit in your cosy room and enjoy super gooey chocolate cakes!

The menu for the evening :

• First up was the cheese straws - Who doesn't know cheese straws? This flaky and buttery bite is hit among kids and grown-ups! So why wouldn't I love it? This was made perfectly with the right amount of crunch and softness!

• Mini pesto pizza - these were immensely cute. Tortilla chips with toppings was what this was. It had a lot of cheese. The idea was really innovative. Thumbs up for this dish.

• Next up was the Cheese Samosa - oh my god. I loved this one. It was soooooo good. Cheese and mayo and everything sinful was filled inside the crispy outer crust of the samosa. I helped myself with 3 of them, so you can understand how good they were. Strongly recommended!

• Lavash with hummus - I hadn't ever tried this Lebanese dish. So this was my first time and I loved it. The Lavash is really crispy and resembles a papad, only much tastier. The hummus was delicious. Such a tasteful dish.

Now coming to the sweet dishes :

• Death by chocolate - this was such a goooey creation. My heart is already melting at the thought of this cake. Made of pure chocolate, it had an essence of coffee which gave it a slightly bitter aftertaste. Perfect for dark chocolate lovers. Absolutely recommended.

• Lemon cake - since I'm not much of a lemon lover, I wasn't really excited with this preparation. But when I took a bite, I found it quite delectable. If you love lemon tarts, and all things lemony, then this is your thing.

• Gulabjamun cake - this is a sponge cake with the infusion of the great Gulabjamun, which makes the Gulabjamun cake the ultimate Indian inspired festival cake. And here it was right in front of me. It tasted amazing and I couldn't keep my hands off it. Recommended!

• Lastly, the best of the lot, the Crème Brûlée - This is a dessert consisting of a rich custard base topped with a contrasting layer of hard caramel. And at Baker's Box you'll find an added bonus, i.e, a piece of marshmallow. This. Is. The. One. Thing. You. Need. To. Order. Oh my god. I still can't get over the beauty and richness of this particular dish. This tasted downright amazing and I think I've gone bonkers over this one particular dish!! Recommended to the power infinity!!!!

So with that ended our eventful afternoon at The Baker's Box. It was a pleasure to be there and taste the delicious items. Loved the place. All my love to team Baker's Box!

P.s. each of us had also received a hamper which had a number of savouries for us. These were Oats and chocolate muffins, Chocolate lava cake and cheese straws. Both the muffin and the lava cake tasted brilliant! My sweet tooth was satiated to the core and the credit goes to The Baker's Box!

Everything about Kolkata is believed as sweet and sugary. We Kolkatans are the sweetest, politest people you’ll meet. Bengali, the language of most of the citizens, is, hands down, the sweetest, most melodious one you’ll hear, at least in India. Our food often has a gentle touch of sugar, even the savoury dishes. And, let’s not even get started on our desserts! We’re so obsessed with desserts that we fought for the position of Rosogolla’s originator! We love sweets from all across the world, from Ghari to Gingerbread. We love every local sweet shop, every bakery. And, it’s time we welcome The Baker’s Box in Kolkata with open arms, too!
                                                                ...

This 2017 has been a sweet start for me. On this sweet and happy note, let me introduce you to The Baker’s Box which brings in for you the best of freshly baked cakes, muffins, desserts and savories.

A big thank you to Mrs. Prerna Churiwal, owner, The Baker’s Box, for sending over the wonderful package of her bakery products to my home for tasting. Located in Salt Lake, Sector 1, The Baker’s Box works in a take-away format of bakery. One can order their products and they send those over to your address. Such an easy way of getting the tasty products at the ease of your home!

Now, let me come over to the items that I had received from The Baker’s Box, and I was amazed to get them.

Molten Lava Cake – I had always been an ardent lover of these. First stored in the freezer and then heated for 10 to 15 secs before serving, these molten lava cakes are a real bliss!!

Tangy Lemon Tart – Tanginess and sweetness perfectly blended in this lemon tart. The crunchy biscuit tart containing the lemony cream is a pure joy indeed!

Espresso Brownies – Who doesn’t love brownies? I so absolutely love them. And, these brownies had a special flavor added to them. The slight smell of coffee triggered the caffeine lover in me. So, I was all thumbs up for these brownies.

Apple Crumble – Apple Crumble is one of their signature products. The apple pulp made base was tasty and fresh, and it came with a baked layer, which perfectly complemented the taste of the apple.

Double Chocolate Cookies – Cookies and chocolates always pair up well. And, here its double chocolate baked cookies. Extremely chocolaty, I loved these in every bite.

My verdict about The Baker’s Box :- 

To sum up, I would say that this new bakery in the city is absolutely a must try. They even accept bulk orders for parties. As of now, their structure is only of a take-away system. However, you can always visit this place with your friends for a quick bite of desserts and cakes. The products that The Baker’s Box had sent to me were really fresh and worth appraisal. I would definitely love to try some other items from their menu soon.

So with that ended our eventful afternoon at The Baker's Box. It was a pleasure to be there and taste the delicious items. Loved the place. All my love to team Baker's Box!

P.s. each of us had also received a hamper which had a number of savouries for us. These were Oats and chocolate muffins, Chocolate lava cake and cheese straws. Both the muffin and the lava cake tasted brilliant! My sweet tooth was satiated to the core and the credit goes to The Baker's Box!

Everything about Kolkata is believed as sweet and sugary. We Kolkatans are the sweetest, politest people you’ll meet. Bengali, the language of most of the citizens, is, hands down, the sweetest, most melodious one you’ll hear, at least in India. Our food often has a gentle touch of sugar, even the savoury dishes. And, let’s not even get started on our desserts! We’re so obsessed with desserts that we fought for the position of Rosogolla’s originator! We love sweets from all across the world, from Ghari to Gingerbread. We love every local sweet shop, every bakery. And, it’s time we welcome The Baker’s Box in Kolkata with open arms, too!

This 2017 has been a sweet start for me. On this sweet and happy note, let me introduce you to The Baker’s Box which brings in for you the best of freshly baked cakes, muffins, desserts and savories.

A big thank you to Mrs. Prerna Churiwal, owner, The Baker’s Box, for sending over the wonderful package of her bakery products to my home for tasting. Located in Salt Lake, Sector 1, The Baker’s Box works in a take-away format of bakery. One can order their products and they send those over to your address. Such an easy way of getting the tasty products at the ease of your home!

Now, let me come over to the items that I had received from The Baker’s Box, and I was amazed to get them.

Molten Lava Cake – I had always been an ardent lover of these. First stored in the freezer and then heated for 10 to 15 secs before serving, these molten lava cakes are a real bliss!!

Tangy Lemon Tart – Tanginess and sweetness perfectly blended in this lemon tart. The crunchy biscuit tart containing the lemony cream is a pure joy indeed!

Espresso Brownies – Who doesn’t love brownies? I so absolutely love them. And, these brownies had a special flavor added to them. The slight smell of coffee triggered the caffeine lover in me. So, I was all thumbs up for these brownies.

Apple Crumble – Apple Crumble is one of their signature products. The apple pulp made base was tasty and fresh, and it came with a baked layer, which perfectly complemented the taste of the apple.

Double Chocolate Cookies – Cookies and chocolates always pair up well. And, here its double chocolate baked cookies. Extremely chocolaty, I loved these in every bite.

My verdict about The Baker’s Box :- 

To sum up, I would say that this new bakery in the city is absolutely a must try. They even accept bulk orders for parties. As of now, their structure is only of a take-away system. However, you can always visit this place with your friends for a quick bite of desserts and cakes. The products that The Baker’s Box had sent to me were really fresh and worth appraisal. I would definitely love to try some other items from their menu soon.

First of all thanks to Baker's box for sending us over some great medley of products from their bakery.They started this venture from november,2015 and is indeed running successfully.The best thing about them is that they donot compromise in quality.They sent us-

1:Expresso Brownie-These were the best brownies we ever had.Every bit of it had a flavour of coffee and will just melt in your mouth after having the first bite.

2:Molten Lava Cake-This cake was delicious in taste but the outer layer was quite thick than the usual molten lava.

3:Lemon Tart-It was the first time i have tasted a lemon tart and i must say it was quite delicious but the baked tart needs to be crisped a little more in order to enhance the overall taste of the tart.

4:Apple Pie-This pie was extremely delicious in taste and the inner filling of crushed apple just complimented the outer baked part.

5:Double chocolate chip cookie-This cookie was a show stealer.The taste and crispiness was just at par and tasted excellent when eaten mildly warm.

Overall their desserts are worth trying and their home delivery option would make it convenient for many.

Food-4.5/5
