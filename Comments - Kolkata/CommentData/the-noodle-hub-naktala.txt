The buffet available in this restuarant on the weekends are quiet pocket friendly along with the choice of items provided. The ambience is good and the staffs are friendly enough but the place is not very spacious. Although ,the food quality was up to the mark but the fish item specialy made for the christmas eve lunch was too aweful along with the chicken dish. The desert however was great and would brag the best food option.

We went on a Saturday hence could avail thie buffer service which I must say is damn cheap for the quality and variety.Food ratings as follows(all the food were included at their weekend buffet menu @261 with taxes)
Veg starter- 4/5 it was actually better than the non veg one and tasted damn good..maybe a bit more sauce would hve made it tastier
Dragon chicken(non veg starter)-3/5..the Dish was excellent but it was NOT boneless..and that spoils all the fun..such tasty the sauce and chicken was...but it was filled with bones
Mixed veg - 3.5/5 the dish was good with mushroom babycorn broccoli..but the curry tasted a bit weird
Chilli chicken dry-4.5/5 excellent it was..and boneless too
Egg fried rice-4/5 Standard chinese fried rice I would say
Egg chow- 4/5 Again the chow was pretty tasty too
Darshan with ice cream- 4.5/5 excellent dessert..I had 7-8 scoops of vanilla ice cream..the darshan was sweet and crunchy too
Ambience -5/5
Service&staff-4.5/5 Very courteous they were..came regularly to serve water and take the plates..
Overall great place to fill ur tummy and GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY..Will surely visit this place again.

Went on to munch in their unlimited buffet. It gives good quality of food at a very low pinch on pocket. Especially the chicken hot n sour soup is great.
Although on the starter they had veg strangoff-reaally nice with crunch thats a big thumbs up frm a non veg freak,den they had dragon chicken which was not authentic yet with a low budget it will not allw u to complain much. In the main course they had fried rice, egg noodles , mix veggies in thai curry, chilly chicken. I tried noodles n chilly chicken only..N it was pretty satisfying. They serve vanilla ice. Cream n darshaan in Desert. Overall the buffet was decent, Preety much filling n great üëç for students n family outting with a low budget.

It is located near geetanjali metro station, 5mins walking distance from the metro station.Buffet at price ‚Çπ249+taxes is really unbelievable. This is the cheapest buffet i have ever had at this price and the food was really good.

Visited this restaurant today with friend. It's about 10 minutes walk from the gitanjali metro station. Ambience was really good. Let's come to the food, all I can say that this is a decent buffet in this amount. We were 5 and the cost was around 1300. Probably this is the cheapest buffet I have ever had.

Visited this place on a weekend. Basically this is the cheapest buffet i ever had. So coming to the details.
Location: its near garia. If you are travelling in metro then you have to walk almost 10mins from gitanjali metro station.
Ambience: good
Food: so i was there for the buffet. The soup was tangy and refreshing. Then in the starter there was dragon chicken. Tasted good. Panfried veggies. Also tasted good but could be more crunchy. Then there was veg dumpling. I honestly didn't like that. For the main course there was a chicken dish (probably sanghai/Mongolian chicken) and a rice dish and a noodle one. The chicken and rice were ok but the noodle was not at all up to the mark. In desert there was ice cream and darsaan.
Overall it was a decent buffet for 261.

¬†

The restaurant has a authentic chinese decoration with beautiful colour combination, including the heritage chinese red colour that adds to it's extra beauty. The most attractive part of the interior decoration are the paintings of Buddha. The ambience becomes more soothing when they play soft music that adds extra beauty to the whole ambience of the restaurant.

4. MIX VEG IN WHITE SAUCE
5. SZECHUAN CHICKEN
6. EGG FRIED RICE

All the dishes in buffet are served hot and are very delicious to taste. Though they have a very pocket friendly price but they still maintain very good quality.In overall this chinese restaurant place to visit.

HOSPITALITY:
Hospitality was the best thing that I liked most about this place. The manager is very humble and goes down to each and every customer, asking them about¬† the food, the staff's are very sober and@ generous.

In overall this place deserves a 4.5 rating. We are looking forward to visit this WONDERFUL place again.

Have been there in the bucket list for quite a while, and we finally gave it a shot last afternoon for lunch. Budget friendly buffet with decent spreads. Located at 356/3/1, N.S.C. Bose Road, Near Naktala Mini Bus Stand, Naktala, Kolkata.

One of the best Chinese buffet at a super affordable price. They have very courteous staff and the ambiance is perfect. The unlimited buffet priced at 249 definitely helped in making that decision.

In Buffet we had :

1) Chicken Manchaw Soup
2) Potato Hunan Style
3) Jaba Style Chicken¬†
4) Mixed Veg in Hot Garlic Sauce
5) Kumpao Chicken
6) Egg Hakka Noodles
7) Veg Fried Rice with Egg
8) Darsaan with Ice Cream

The buffet isn't grand, like the ones you would expect in some places. However, the food is delicious and the price is definitely way less than most places. Almost all the dishes will satiate your stomach. Overall, a happy atmosphere for happy dining.

It comprised of chicken thai soup, 1 veg starter (bella veg) , 1 non veg starter( mongolian chicken),egg fried rice,noodles,chicken sambal,veg side dish,darsan with icecream...
All the dishes tasted good except mongolian chicken.
Firstly, it was not boneless. Secondly, the taste too wasn't upto the mark.
Nevertheless, at 294 rs , you can't expect anything more.
Highly recommended place if you are broke , running short of money but still have a big appetite üòÄ

Soup, one veg starter one non-veg starter, one type of rice and noodle respectively , one veg dish, one chicken preparation, ice-cream with darshaan... Nd it costs 294 (249+taxes) per person for buffet ... They could have got better review if the chicken starter was boneless .. I would recommend to give it a try ...

We tried the weekend buffet at this place. With taxes, it costs Rs 294 per head. The food quality is pretty good and for such a low price the buffet spread is quite sumptuous.

The buffet menu has -

1 soup
2 starters - 1 veg and 1 chicken
2 main side dishes - 1 veg and 1 chicken
1 rice item
1 noodle item
And finally 1 dessert - Darshan with ice cream 

The food was good and so was the service by people like Surojit and others..
Very well mannered staff..

This is the second time I ordered food. I had asked for guidance. Inspite of that I turned up with food I could not enjoy. I had ordered chilli garlic noodles. I had in mind the Kylie Kwong recipe but i landed up with overdone noodles soaked in a badly made szechuan sauce with added sweet. It was horrible. Coming to my chicken with oyster sauce and chilli was a mess. It niether had chilli nor oyster sauce. the flavour was dunked in soya sauce. 
It was neither value for money nor tasty.

The buffet was started from 12 am to 3 pm.
The food was 6 course.
Soup
Two Starters in Chicken
Fried rice and Chowmin
Chilli chicken
As a desert vanilla ice cream.
The service was very good and also the food was good.
The best is the starter. Need to improve the quality of food like Soup and Main course.

Just Sad and Depressing.
I wanted to cancel my order in next 10mins time. I ordered a soup. I informed zomato they said that the order is in the kitchen. I called up the resturant the next moment. The behaviour of the person pickiing up the phone was so rude he gave the phone to another person and he said. The food is out for delivery. Now it cant be cancel and the resturant is 10mins walking distance from my house.
The delivery boy reached after 1hour 18min. While the zomato time 45mins where still left and i called the resturant. Anyway i received the order and the money got wasted.
Management is horrible. They dont have the courtesy to talk or even be humble.
Oh not to forget the taste wasnt anything to die for. I was even willing to change my order and get something else. But there wasnt any co operation. 

This place is a Big NO NO from now on.

Situated in Naktala on the NSC Bose Road, a nice place to hangout with family & close ones. I liked their decor & esoecially their service quality and hospitality. They also has buffet facility on their 1st floor on Saturdays and Sundays. We ordered Mixed hakka noodles, Mixed noodles in white sauce and Chezwan Chicken. The quantity of the food was more than sufficient. I also liked the taste and their ingredients that they used for the white sauce like Gherkins. It had a hint of authentic chinese touch in it. The price of the food is also reasonable as these 3 dishes costed us INR 726 including GST. Moreover I am very much satisfied with this place. A mist visit for foodies out their to cherish their taste buds on some authentic chinese food.

We went for the buffet today.. First thing I noticed was the ambience of the place.. It was so relaxing to just sit there.. Then the hot chicken soup was served.. That was delicious.. Then came veg and non-veg starter.. Well in starter I liked the veg one over the non-veg one.. Veg one was fried potatoes mixed with salt and pepper..It was mouth watering..non-veg one was dry chili chicken. Then for main course there was egg rice and noodle with for veg foodies creamy vegetables, and oyster chicken for non-veg foodies. The food in this section was above average. Then there was darsan and ice cream for dessert. They were nice too. We ordered virgin mojito separately which was kind of okay. All the staff were friendly and we'll behaved. 

All right long story short. All of this for 300 bucks. Now that's interesting right! A must visit if you are looking for buffet at cheap price in Kolkata. Awesome place.

P.S.: Just one thing. Staffs should notice the glasses of customers and fill them with water accordingly.

We had seen the name of this restaurant in the list of Cheap buffets in Kolkata on internet.
So we decided to visit this restaurant on one fine weekend.
The price of the buffet is pocket friendly.
This buffet is absolutely nice for non veg foodies but for veg foodies I wont suggest this place.
It had a basic 8 course chinese food in the buffet.

Begins with sweet corn chicken soup which was hot and nice.
Starters had Crispy roasted potatoes and dry chilly chicken.The food was cold and they later on served it hot on the table after we had complained about it.
It tasted far better when served hot.
Maincourse had egg fried rice,egg noodles,oyster chicken and Creamy vegetables.The food taste was  good.
Dessert has only darsaan and ice cream.Since darsaan was unavailable we got two scoops ice cream each.I wish they improve the dessert section.

The only problem I face here is the service,it takes hours just to serve even if u order before hand. very slow service.

Mum's bday and I decided to take her out for lunch.... 
It's Maha Navami today so I expected heavy rush  hence I booked a table through Zomato. We got a table with ease

Gud ambience, striking exterior, gud service. I was a bit disappointed because I went making up my mind to try the dimsums but sadly they weren't able to serve due to some issues. It a was a bit of a let down.

Ordered chicken hot and sour soup-awesome flavour hence recommended, mixed Hakka noodles- could be better as it was way too dry, prawn in oyster sauce- great dish, darsaan with vanilla ice cream- well this stuff was gud but could be better with slight additions. I wish they put a bit more honey and add white sesame which shall highten not just d look but also d taste.

Noodle hub is recently getting a lot of attention due to it's cheapest buffet available only @199/- on weekends. There are around 8 dishes that are served in buffet. Starting with a soup, followed by a starter. Then comes the main course consisting of a dish of noodle, rice and a side dish, ending with deserts and a single scoop of ice-cream. Sounds great, right? But, there is catch, the starter or the chicken side dish aren't boneless. So, it's kind of tiring to eat. Also, the food quality isn't that great either. 
The service isn't much to talk about.

disappointed....yes that would be the synonym for the utterly unbutterly hub.....that's named noodle hub.... we went there only because it boasts of serving great buffet at the cheapest price in town....well what they serve is no near delicious....the variety was very few....the chicken had a stinky flavour, the rice was overspiced with coriander(veg), stale chowmein(just egg)...and served only one scoop of ice cream that too with a fork...like who is so dumb to eat ice cream with a fork?XD....the only thing good was the chicken soup, which had some generous amount of chicken for which I have gave the extra 1 star XD....
want a buffet at low cost?-have a visit
want good food?- don't go...haha

We went for the buffet lunch of Sunday and reached around 12:15.¬†
Ambiance: The buffet was on first floor. The place has very few seats to accommodate huge crowd.¬†
Service: The staff was well behaved,although many review bad behavior
Price : 249 + taxes
Food: We were served the following menu

1.	Chicken sweet corn soup: It was thick and sweet, probably one of the best items on menu
2.	Potato salt & pepper: The potatoes were fried and sprinkled with spices.
3.	Chinese Roasted Chicken: Fried chicken in a sauce. It was dry and little spicy but well cooked. Most of the pieces had bones.
4.	Mixed Vegetables in white sauce: The white sauce had soupy consistency and variety of soft vegetables.¬†
5.	Chicken in black pepper sauce: Pieces were similar to roasted chicken and the pepper sauce was too spicy.
6.	Egg fried rice: plain rice with egg
7.	Morning glory noodles: noodles with egg and green. Goes well with noodles
8.	Darssan: Tasted like sweet nimki or khaja
9.	Ice cream scoop: Ice cream is served on the table once you finished eatingOverall budget friendly buffet and tastes okay. Suggest reaching early, as people who came late had to sit in ground floor and come up again and again to take the food; it can be annoying for anyone.

I do not like to rate this restaurant experience at all. My wife ordered Chicken Fried rice and Chilli Chicken for taking away. I was prepared to have a solid dinner at home.
But, when I started eating, it's horrible. Chickens in the friied rice were not fresh, it's hard to chew, not tender. Chickens used in the side dish is also not tender and took effort to chew and swallow. Chicken were not fresh. Spend 500 bucks on the food and all go in vein. 
One more thing, properly print the term 'CGST' and not 'CGHT' in the bill. Same for 'SGST'.

Awfully Bad Experience. Worst Buffet. Tasteless food. Rude Behaviour. Inconvenient Preparations.
I visited the retaurant this sunday for buffet lunch. It has been the place of hype for last 1 month so wanted to give it a try. They maintain first come first service so couldnt reserve a table which I wanted to do since I heard that they attract huge crowd.
We reached at 12:45. Upon reaching we were informed that the first floor is full and food is served only at the first floor except the soup and ice cream. So we have to go to the first floor everytime to bring the starters and the main course. Like seriously! If you are having sortage of place can't you make a preparation to serve food to the ground floor also. The person at the reception or I think the main waiter was extremely rude and his attitude towards us was not at all appreciable. He doesn't know how to welcome or how to handle guests. He was reluctant in his behaviour when we asked if we could wait for the first floor to get empty for two seats. There was no place for waiting. You have to wait outside or if you stand inside you might get clash with anyone going upstairs for taking food or coming downstairs. There was no glasses on our table and they didnt serve water until we asked for it.
Coming to the food. The first was soup. I dont know why but the same man insisted us to take the starter first and he said we will be served soup in the meanwhile. Who eats starter before soups! and not only us, he was telling this to other people also and I didnt find a reason. He informed one family that they have to wait for the soup because it is not ready yet but they found soup to be ready on the first floor. It was hot an soup soup which was too good with lots of chicken and veggies. The sad part is it is the only dish that was good in the buffet and it is served only once.
Next we took the starters. There was potato chilli in palm sauce. It was soft, succulent but not tasty. Then there was chilli chicken with bone which was full of bone and very little chicken.
In the main course we had cirspy veggies in gravy which was extremely sour. Next there was chicken which was basically tasteless. It was full of outer crust and again very little chicken. So every time we had to take many pieces to have the adequate amount of chicken and on this the waiter would be looking at your plate like you have done some sins which is very much uncomfortable. They had egg friedrice and egg noodles. I dont know who was the cook otherwise I would have asked that where did he learn to make egg fried rice with no veggies. Just omit the egg and call it plain rice. Neither the fried rice nor the noodle was at all tasty. We had to force ourself to eat the food since we didnt wanted to waste food. We didnt even try darshan though i like it too much. They were supposed to serve ice cream. When we finished our main course we were sitting there hoping somebody might come up with the ice cream. Suddenly again that man came to ask us if we had done and if we can leave the place. This time I behaved rudely too and asked him serve the ice cream first which he is supposed to. He gave a look and served melted small scoops of strawberry Ice cream. One small scoop each and ice cream is also served once only. Though I dont like strawberry flavour but still the ice cream was better than the food. We also took thumps up thinking that it might help our taste buds. Our total bill was 653. 294 for each and 65 for half of a thumps up bottle of Rs.35. And I regretted for chosing such a restaurant which ruined my sunday afternoon lunch.
The management should be really concerned about the staff behaviour because it is a serious issue at this restaurant. With the same price or 100 bucks more one can have way better buffet at The wall or haka with way better staff behaviour. Good welcoming attitude is highly necessary for pleasing the guests even when the food is not that tasty and it covers up many other backdrops.
I was disgusted with the behaviour so avoid the plan of clicking pictures of starters and main course at the end.

First of all let me mention how bad my luck is ... I've been eyeing this restaurant's buffet for about a month and finally managed to reach there this Saturday .... And guess what they increased the price. :(
Now coming to the food, I found it was just unworthy of all the hype.
1. Chicken sweet corn soup --> tasted nice, and the only item I actually liked 
2. Potato salt and pepper --> fried potato sticks tossed in some salt and pepper ... Tasted just okay, nothing extraordinary
3. Chinese roasted chicken --> bone-in chicken pieces in a dry sauce made with some soya sauce and curry leaves ..... Again tasted only okayish, nothing special
4. Mixed vegetables in white sauce --> as the name suggests, mixed vegetables in white sauce ... Again tasted only okayish, missed any zing of some Chinese or Asian flavours
5. Chicken in black pepper sauce --> again tastes just decent, not very bad but again missing any kind of zing
6. Egg fried rice --> plain rice tossed with very little scrambled eggs, no vegetables in it, no zing of flavours or spices .... Damn disappointing .... Almost tasteless
7. Morning glory noodle --> again only boiled noodles tossed with very little eggs and extremely few green leaves ..... Which seemed to be some cauliflower leaves and all ...... This tastes utter rubbish .... And believe it or not ..... The chowmein worth Rs.30, which the guy at the footpath near my house makes, is a hundred times better than this so called "morning glory noodle"
8. Darsaan with ice cream --> tasted more like the sweet nimki you get at melas in Kolkata, at Rs.40 or 50 a kilo .... And one tiny little scoop of ice cream

Plus when I was all disappointed with my meal and wanted another bowl of soup at the end, as that was the only thing I found good in the menu ..... The waiter started misbehaving, saying that I can't take another bowl.

Basically me and my friend, we wasted some hard saved 294 rupees per head ..... That's some amount for college goers.

If someone wants to have a lot of delicious food at a very low price, I am definitely gonna recommend this place. But at the same time I wanna mention the staffs at this place need to be trained properly; they are ill mannered, unprofessional and they kept on bothering us with silly things. There was this one person who told us that we could use another new plate for the main course and then when we did so, there was this another waiter who embarrassed us because of it. Besides I find that the buffet price has increased lately but there's no such change with the menu or no new dishes added. The chickens were not boneless which kinda ruined the appetite, and I wish they had unlimited ice cream; they served us a very tiny scoop of ice cream which was disappointing.But the soup was amazing and also the veg starter was very well cooked. So the 3 stars are basically because of the ridiculous staff or else this place would have deserved more. And hopefully the next time I visit this place I find something extra added to the menu. .

Bad behaviour of staffs, visited buffet a few days ago, as we were sitting a longer time than usual, they were barking at us. We visited at 12:30pm & were there till 3pm. It's a buffet and you can sit as long the place is open. It's scheduled to close at 3:30pm, but from 2:30pm only they started barking. & at last they served their anger with the scoop of ice cream. Almost melted ice cream they gave, after complaining about it, they didn't even bother to hear us. Food is good & price is good, & it's always a good deal at the buffet.

Visited the restaurant on Sunday with my mate and was stunned to see a crowd of approx. 150 people including both seated and waiting.. But the staff was courteous and efficient to handle it.. Small goof ups is understandable.. Food was good and sumptuous.. Decor was good.. Chicken was quiet expected was served with bone.. As I don't expect them to serve boneless chicken at 199.. Which is very much unusual and doubtful.. Due to the unexpected crowd, the staff was kind enough to inform us that they are sorry to give us more than one scoop of ice cream in dessert.. Overall experience was good and satisfied.. Yummy.. A must visit in the Puja again...

I generally don't give poor reviews to any of the restaurant, but for this one I have to because they've left us with no other option. The 199+ taxes Buffet menu has attracted plan of foodies from various places of the city but to me it's a complete disappointment. It's crowded had to wait for 1.5hours. The service was disastrous, the waiters not willing to help and took them 20-25mins to refill every menu. As it's they only give two non veg side dishes of chicken which didn't taste good, more to the fact none of the pieces were boneless. It felt like we're having a gravy full of bones with no chicken. Ice cream as mentioned in the buffet menu was only a scoop. You can't ask for more. So basically what's the point in adding it to the buffet menu ?  Moreover the food gave severe stomach aches after reaching home and I didn't have surplus quantity of food because it didn't taste well and it's excessively spicy. My suggestion is not to waste Rs. 235(inc taxes) on this.

The worst possible service I have ever got from any restro. The offer of 199+taxes on buffet was there. The food on the buffet counter was finishing off very quickly as for the amount of guests visiting that restro due to the offer going on.. It was pretty incorrigible of the staffs to not refill the food on the buffet counter when they were half way finished. People were waiting with plates in their hands for 20mins..& there were no food on the counter. When you guys can't manage such crowd ..why are you taking them in then? Now...coming to the food, awful..is the word. Soup was okayish. Everything was too much spicy. There was no boneless chicken preparation which was more frustrating. They were supposed to give a chocolate ice cream scoup at the end..but they gave a vanilla one cause they went out of stock. Shitty place..shitty service..shitty management. Never going to visit again..& will spread this word to my friends & clan. -_-

I could say like it's the cheapest buffet you can get in Kolkata. You have to spend only 200 rupees , yes you heard it right, just 200 rupees( taxes extra). They are providing chinese buffet. In the menu there were 3/4 chicken items and one veg item which is okay just to fill your tummy. You have to reach there before 12:30 pm otherwise you have to wait for long time. They are not providing any drinks in buffet. Lastly they served a scoop of ice cream ( no falvour choice). I think I don't want to talk about decor, it's normal. Overall considering the buffet price, it's good.

Went there for a Sunday Buffet. The outlet was extremely crowded. We had to wait for 2 long hours for our turn. So it is advisable, that you reach the place by 12:30 p.m. 
Food: There was'nt much variety. Only the Schezwan Chicken is worth mentioning. It was okayish, considering the Buffet cost 235 bucks.
Ambience: Crowded in weekends. Be an early bird to avoid crowds.
Decor: Nice

Please do not go there. They have called it a buffet but the staff stares at you when u take some extra pieces of chicken than the normal. Once the food is finished, it requires 20 mins to fill it up, so people has to sit quietly for 20 mins. And the staff pressurises u to leave the place as soon as possible. They even didnt give the icecream. Plus the food was also of bad taste apart from the starter soup.

Best place to have a pocket friendly buffet in the town. They have a jaw dropping price of Rs.199+taxes. for their chinese lunch buffet available only on Saturday & Sunday.
So for Rs 235(199+taxes) we got chinese hot & sour soup, chinese roasted chicken, salt & pepper potato, Korean fried rice, mongolian noodles, Mixed veg in white sauce,Black pepper chicken & finally darsaan. All the dishes were amazing & so tastefull specially the potato & the mix veg in white sauce. But the noodles was really bad & some kind of fishy smell was coming out of that. But overall for all the other items, amazing price & finally the super cool ambiene I'm giving 4.5 rating!! Had such a nice experience. Will visit again for sure‚ò∫‚ò∫

Originally went for the buffet lunch but were asked to wait 50 mins outside in the searing heat. Absolutely no waiting area onside for the waiting customers so we opted for the seating menu. Ordered the lemon coriander soup which was way to acidic for our taste, it was more of a dhaniya chutni soup. For our main course went with chilli garlic noodles along with a thai chicken which was recomended by the server and it was spicy beyond mesure.. We could only taste the chilli flakes.. A disppointing experience overall.. Would not recomend

Waiters lack the courtesy to respond to ur queries about when ur food will arrive.. Had to wait for more than one hour for my order and still it did not arrive.  Kept asking the waiter for fifteen mins when the food would arrive,  he could not come up with any answer. Left the restaurant in a huff only to be followed by the waiter outside to tell me that my food was ready.  Food (taste, quality)  - 3.6/5, service - 2.5/5.

Chicken sweet corn soup (very nice)
Veg starter
Non veg starter
Butter fried noodles
Egg fried rice
Chilli chicken
Veg dish
Darssan
Ice cream of your choice
Though the food quality is not very good but it's totally worth the price you are paying. A must visit if you stay near this place.

This has been on my bucket list for quite sometime and I must say that I am quite impressed. The ambience is decent and so is the service .
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I tried out the weekend buffet here. It had a non veg soup, a veg starter, a non veg starter, egg fried rice, butter garlic noodles, a veg and a non veg side dish, darssan and ice cream. The experience was satisfactory and the food served here is absolute value for money. The only thing to keep in mind is that the ice cream served is only 1 scoop, the rest is unlimited.

FINAL VERDICT- For 235 bucks post tax, you cannot really ask for more. The only con I would say is the fact that the chicken is not boneless. Other than that its good value for money and definitely recommended.

The way the order was taken over phone was very professional. The food was delivered on time. The food tasted good. Had ordered Tai Si Chicken and Chicken Fried rice. Quantity was good for two people, the food wasn't oily and felt very light. The gravy was very different kinda flavoured. We enjoyed the food. The total including taxes and delivery charges was Rs 413. 

Will surely order from here next time I crave for chinese

This is a very okay place with very okayish food and bad service. The waiters aren't alert enough and come thrice to ask you for the same orders. And the food gets served super late. But the wait would still have been worth if the food was delicious, but it failed to do that too. Overall, this is an average restaurant, so go there only if you run out of places to go.

Its situated near our locality. Good connectivity. Staffs were good. Ambience was also great. The buffet here costs Rs. 240 only including tax. Its the cheapest buffet menu I have seen. Its a 8 course meal. The food was also good. But it can be better if they try. A bit of suggestions for them. In the buffet menu if they can give boneless chicken it would be great. In exchange you can raise the price of the buffet menu from Rs. 240 to Rs. 350. Overall it was good. 
Thank you.

Not a good place at all... It's a waste even to spend a single penny there... Being a Chinese restaurant they hardly know how to make it. Neither the staff is good.

I have been here a few times with my friends. This place serves good chinese food at decent prices.
The ambience and the service is pretty good. As far as the food goes the starters are pretty good with the honey chilli pork deserving a special mention. The chilli garlic noodles was awesome. The buffet is also pretty good and the quality of the food far exceeds the price.
This place is a must visit for people who like chinese . To sum up , a pretty decent experience.

You know I have passed this fine looking restaurant many times, wondering how would this place be. Today I finally decided to go in for dinner. Situated in Naktala, the d√©cor and ambience of the place is pretty decent and far better than the usual other Chinese eateries spread across Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose road. We ordered for chicken fried rice , konjee Krissy lambs and stir fried chicken in hot basil sauce.

All three dishes were great. Very tasty and the rice had good flavour. The konjee lamb was hot and crisp, the stir fried chicken was nice with a overwhelming basil flavour. Good diner overall. Worth a try !

A wonderful place near Naktala.. The outlook is very attractive nd so is the ambience..It feels cozy..The service needs to improve abit as they are abit slow...The menu card showed many unique dishes including Burmenese dishes but they were not available....

We started with crispy chilli Baby corn nd spring roll..Both were spicy..We then ordered Our main course including fried rice, Manchurian, garlic noodles, etc..we ended our meal with fresh lime soda..
If you stay near Naktala , Usha, Garia Area in South Kolkata, its a perfect place to go with your friends and family.

P.S.  Their home delivery service is also good. I ordered twice and both were good.

This place serves the cheapest buffet spread on Saturdays and Sundays only  for lunch. And I have to admit , almost each and every dish is equally good.
I visited this place 2 times to have the buffet spread. The staff are really courteous. The restaurant is really easy to locate...it is on NSC Bose Road.

Now for the food: 

Soup(4.5/5):Sweet corn chicken soup which was just the right amount of everything.

Starters(4.25/5):The pepper fried veggies was a very unique and tasty dish.
The dried chilli chicken was made to perfection.

Mains(3.5/5)-The egg fried rice and shezuan noodles were okayish and so was the garlic chicken.What I likes the most was the bokchoy in green curry which was something really appetizing.

Dessert (5/5):Thums up for the darsaan that's served with a scoopful of vanilla ice cream. The darsaan is one of the best I've had in the city, absolutely made to perfection,with the right amount of sweetness, stickiness and crunchiness.

Today along with my colleagues visited The Noodle Hub and am totally floored by the quality of food. We ordered for chicken hot n spicy soup, butter garlic fish, stir fry chicken in chilli plum sauce, stir fry spicy noodles and sliced chicken in black pepper sauce and fresh lime soda ... all of them tasted perfect. They didn't take much time to serve and that's a very positive sign.
The quantity of the food was ample for our appetites. The sliced chicken in black pepper sauce was the best. All the other items were too yummy as well.
We were totally satisfied with the service and the decor along with the ambience was absolutely soothing.
Would love to visit again. Kudos and keep it up üëç

Food
Man Chow soup was yummy
Both veg and non veg starter tasted really good
Main course had chicken and veggies with noodles and rice dish which was also lip smacking
Darshan and ice cream was as beverages which gave the best conclusion to the buffet

Ambience was too good

Service was prompt and fast ......staff behaviour was good 

Pocket pinch is quiet reasonable

Love to visit again.. will recommend my friends and family

The noodle hub is quite close to my residence. I was surprised to find the closing time to be 1130pm....far beyond which most established restaurants serve. Anyway....we decided to try it out. 
We reached at 10pm....to find no one at the enquiry desk and also to find the place extremely understaffed. They had no idea how long we would have to wait....nothing....as if they are running a picnic. They were unsure if we would get a table any time soon....and funny, we got a table within 5mins.
Next we waited...and finally after asking twice got a menu card. 
Anyway....all this is excusable if a restaurant is having a rush hour. 
But the food and service was terrible. 
The cold drink was anything but cold....it was a drink i guess.....tasted like pepsi mixed with water.
Then the soup....chicken sweet corn soup....we had instructed 2soups to be divided among three....they completely forgot that part....and when we asked why....they argued that we should do it ourselves....we were left dividing the soup. 
The soup was below average....after a lot of adjustment with salt, pepper, vinegar, soya sauce, ketchup and what not...it was eatable.
Then came mixed hakka noodles....a joke....there was supposed to be chicken, egg and fish....there was hardly anything beyond some chicken....and yes, no salt....it was boiled and smelt egglike.
The side order was prawn something....which has a few malnourished prawns coated with something to make them fatter and a gravy drowned in salt.
Oh yes....and the restaurant is a zoo.....there is no decorum.... noisy guests, loud sounds everywhere and an annoying phone that keeps ringing every 2 minutes....how can one eat in such  a circus. 
P.S....a few customers were sent back bcz there was no food....and the ones seated constantly kept getting served things different from what they had asked for....utter confusion in every aspect....what is ordere? What is goin to be taken away? Who is going to take away? How will they pay?
I mean seriously....cut your cloth as much as u can afford to.....make the closing time near about 9....so that you can feed people actual food.
And did i mention the price is on the high end! 

I wish the rating was possible in decimals as well....1 seems a little too high for me. 
This review is coming from a person extremely fond of food and who rarely complains about food....but your restaurant today was 50 shades of wrong. Now i know one more freak place i need to avoid. 
Thank you for the experience.

Pocket friendly Buffet in d town. Saturday afternoon 240rs incl.tax. 1st of all if you go there within 1pm then you have to wait for some time for food. around 1.15pm they start service, but full buffet setup complete around 1.30pm. its ok coz this restaurant not specialized in buffet, buffet only for weekends lunch. so they begin with chicken sweet corn soup, crispy veg in congee sauce,spicy black paper chicken, after that egg rice and egg noodle, with spicy chicken gravy. ¬†in dessert only darsaan, and only 1 scoop vanilla flavor ice cream, mind it only one scoop. ¬†all item are tasty but spicy, and all chicken items are with bone(disappointing)!! but within 240rs unlimited food its more then ok!

Visited once to try their Buffet which is probably the most pocket friendly in d town. It consists of 8course meal both veg and non veg.Started with soup and then one non veg and veg starter with egg rice and noodles with each of veg and non veg side dish. At the end single scoop of ice cream. The food is unlimited and tasty too but the chicken dishes were consisted of bony pieces. The buffet is only for Saturday and Sunday lunch and it costs around 225 rupees including all.

Tibetan Momos, suimai and Thai food were not available, neither the Khow suey, they seemed like a decorative part of the menu üòú ... However, the fish preparation was very good, and the prawns.. we had pan fried fish, shezwan prawns, burnt garlic fish, and chicken wantons... the Honey chilli pork also had a perfect balance between sweet and spicy... Portions were generous... Did not like the mayo mustard sauce.. a tad salty and spicy, didn't sit well with the otherwise chinese preparation of the rest of the food... A good place to have 'Kolkata' chinese, not really a fine dining place, service is a little slow, but the food was piping hot, and the virgin mojito was awesome üëç a complete value for money dining experience üòäüòä

Coming to the ambience and decor it is very simple and minimalistic .
Food :
1.Chicken Soup ( 4/5)
2.Langsa Chicken ( 2/5)
3. Congee style veg ( 3/5)
4. Coriander Chicken ( 3/5)
5. Egg fried rice ( 4/5)
6. Noodles ( 3/5)
7.Darssan ( 4/5)
8.Icecream 4/5)
Nothing worth to crave for but you can try this place out if you love Chinese cuisine...
199/- per person + taxes is the pocket pinch which is ok as the food is not really mind blowing...

Ordered online through Zomato today. Seriously dissappointed with the food quality. The pan fried noodles was pathetic-salty and bitter with overuse of soya sauce. The crispy chicken with plum sauce had no chicken at all. Just fried vegetables and potatoes. Honey glazed lemon chicken was starchy and the chicken seemed to have refrigerated for a long time.

We had visited Noodle hub a year back. Food was back then. I am flummoxed at the deterioration of quality and taste. I mean the food was so obnoxious that the restaurant can be sued.

Pathetic seriously!!

Yesterday we ordered 2 chkn pan fried noodles, chk rice noodles and bhetki in schezwan chilli sauce from this place....first of all we ordered a bit late around 10:30 pm, and the restaurant took the order for home delivery stating that it will take an hour.....but after 11:30pm also we couldn't reach the restaurant nor did they contacted,highly unprofessional...we had to visit the restaurant and then they started preparing the food!!! Now coming to the food, it was pathetic, chkn rice noodles didn't have a single pc of chkn!!!! pan fried noodles was watery and fish dish was tasteless....in the past they did serve good food but i guess somehow the restaurant is not capable enough to handle crowd during festivals and occasions, so better avoid.....

Great place. Nicely decorated. They have buffet and they got some crowd for it. When i go there around 3p.m, I was surprised to see so many people still having their buffet. But I was there to try something other than there buffet menu. So I orderd noodles, drums of heaven, crunchy‚Äã chicken in sweet and sour gravy and dharshan one plate of each items. First I have to tell about the quantity. I have to pack almost all of the item because It's too much for 2 people. Then about the the taste, it's more than good. Nice ambience. Surely try again.

Never imagined that this good food and this good buffet restro is there beside my house! Willing to make it there from the day it inaugurated but its been late! Lastly I made it there to have the buffet which they only on Saturday and Sunday in just Rs. 199/-.
I am mesmerized! Though the buffet consists of 10 recepies, you can eat as much as you can, you can eat your heart out!

Coming to the Review,
POSITIVITY -
1. Food - The buffet dishes are awesome! Eat you heart out! The buffet is mainly consisting of 2 types of Soups, 2 types of Starters, 2 types of Main Dishes, 2 types of Rice/Noodles, 2 types of Desserts.
 The buffet menu is given below!
2. Serving time - Buffet, Serve Yourself! Luckily I was the person to start the buffet on that very day and they took some time and cooked the menus! It was tounge burning hot!
3. Decoration - Good Decoration! But the ambience can be better! 
4. Staff behaviour - They will escort you from the outside door to you seat and will help you to server your buffet!
5. Pocket Pinch - 199/- plus Tax per person, Saturday & Sunday! Go, eat as much as you can!

NEGITIVITY -¬†
1. Buffet Menu Variations can be more! Will love to see more variations in their menu!

BUFFET MENU -¬†
1. Veg Corn Soup
2. Chicken Manchow Soup
3. Chicken Chilly
4. Potato Chilly Palm Sauce
5. Chicken in Black Pepper Sauce
6. Mixed Veg in Hot Garlic Sauce
7. Burnt Garlic with Coriander Rice
8. Egg Noodle Singapore style
9. Darssan
10. Ice Cream of Your Choice

If you live around or near this place, this restro is a must try! I never tried their normal menu, but I will do quickly! Have a Great Meal! :-)

Have ordered before and food was good, so ordered again last night, 3 plates of Mixed Hakka Noodles via Swiggy, what they sent was shocking!! plain noodles with just a few strands of eggs, a few strands of capsicum and onion and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE! I was so shocked that I took a video of opening and pouring of the content of one of the three containers as evidence! Must have missed a step in between where prawns and chicken are to be added, and that's pretty unprofessional, specially when you haven't cooked your dinner on this day and are relying on what a restaurant sends to you. Swiggy hasn't replied either! They were supposed to call between 4PM and 6PM.

Noodle Hub is a nice restuarent in naktala.The restuarent is beautifully decorated and the restaurant really has a good family ambience.
I visited this for many time and have got a good response from this chinese restaurant.
We ordered: schezwan chilli baby corn for starters and chicken pan fried noodle, mixed fried rice and pan fried chilli fish for the main course.
Schezwan chilli baby corn- This is a nice baby corn dish to start your meal and the thing that I liked is it was not too dry and was really tasty.
Chicken pan fried noodle - This is one of the most recommended dish and I will personally recommend everyone to try this dish. It is a gravy noodle cooked with vegetable and chicken and it's awesome.
Mixed fried rice-This is a average dish.  The fried rice is very dull and it is not very tasty.
Pan fried chilli fish - This is another must try dish and it's really tasty and delicious.The dish is bit dry but it taste nice.The fish is well cooked in a hot and sour gravy .
Overall it is a nice place to eat and I think this is the best chinese restuarent in naktala.

Located just beside the Arambagh and few steps away from my home this place is a must try for all Naktala people :P. Well I have been here for several times. Liked their Thai menu. The dumplings were very good. For me the farm house lamb was very special. Compared to their Thai menu Chinese menu was not up to the mark. The service was very slow. This statement is reflected to my rating. I must admit when ever I feel hungry I give a try to this place. :)

Good place to dine in. Service is normal, food is quite tasty, hospitality is super good with awesome ambience. Ordered sliced chicken in schezuan sauce, mixed fried rice and one virgin mojito. Located just near gitanjali metro station. Want to try their buffet as they are providing in such a low cost. Sadly I went there on weekdays and buffets are just on weekends.
Must visit! üíú

We ordered Kowloon Vegetable Spring‚Äã-rolls, Chicken Tom Yum Noddles, Chicken Momo, Veg Pan Fried Noodles. The order was accepted promptly. They didn't have a pork dish and immediately informed me and suggested a replacement. The order was well packed and delivered quickly. The noodles were really well cooked and and the portion size was good. The momo was cooked well with a think outer skin. The spring roll was average. Would definitely order again.

Coming from the U.S. I have had to settle for allot of indian/chinese food. But this place delivers an authentic Chinese taste. The Noodle Hub delivered a satisfying meal to my home. They took care in packaging and the veg hot and sour and chicken tom kha soups arrived hot and steaming with no spillage. The chicken sui mui appetizers where excellent. Our main course also very tasty but I have to give a shout out to the Crunchy chicken in plum sauce. It was sweet and spicy pefect crunchy outer layer with tender chicken on the inside. The pan fried chicken rice and Noodles again some of the best Ive had in india. So glad to have found this place. If your looking for authentic chinese food and not just some greasy hybrid, try this place!!

Reasonably priced and conveniently located, this restaurant serves competently prepared Chinese and Thai food. My daughter loves having the Onion and Mushroom Fried Rice with the Honey Glazed Lemon Chicken. It's a good enough place to visit for those who stay in the vicinity and don't want to go too far for a decent restaurant meal.

Zomato suggested this place to us when we were lost in Naktala, NJC Bose road. This place is definitely a hub for the noodle lovers. What a variety! We walked in the dine-in with hunger pangs and the ambience was a china town. The aroma of boiling veggies and sauces entailed to our seats. We ordered fish and some dumplings to begin with. The waiters were not that accommodating but I would give them 3/5. They were just doing their job-serving and lifting.(could not help with the menu). The seating was mediocre but the food was great. We also ordered Pan-fried noodles and Hakka noodles. The rich sauces are a surprise, one wouldn‚Äôt be able to discover them just by looking. We were very happy with our order. Decent place to hang out with friends. The Saturday lunch is a must try- at least that is what I have heard from my friend circle.

With great enthusiasm and expectations visited this place for first time with my family on the last day of 2016. But...It was a disaster.. We waited for 45 minutes for the food to come..with an ancipitation that the delay in serving is justified as it was New years eve. But to avoid further delay I went up to meet the manager to know the status of our order. To my surprise the manager looked confused and replied that our order was not received at the kitchen. When asked the boy who took our order he replied that it was served to other table. It was around 10:35 pm with a kid feeling very helpless. I left the place after having some food which the manager gave us ( may be ready food ordered by other guests). Also the food quality is not ok . There are so many Chinese restaurant around in Kolkata. So to my understanding it is a poorly managed place where waiter's are not trained , manager do not have courtesy and food quality was not ok. Please do not waste your time and money here and there are lot of place to get quality food. I will not recommend to any of my family friends and to my corporate friends.

Not too far away from the Gitanjali (Naktala) metro or from Bansdroni, great decor and service! All the dishes which I have tasted so far has good quality and quantity. They make lovely spicy black pepper chicken and the drinks are also good!

Quaint and nice. The moment you step in, exudes a calming effect. The staff are helpful, they even customised their starter according to request.  Food ranges between very good to satisfactory.  Loved the drink, lychee sparkle. The roasted pork in Orange sauce is a definite try but would have preferred a little more mushroom wise populated version of the  Golden fried onion with shiitake mushroom rice. And lastly, the staff should not offer the disaster served in the name of mango pudding.

Went to meet my friend and she suggested we drop by here for lunch. The restaurant looks very nice and is lit well.. would have ordered a la carte but saw a buffet was laid out. On enquiring we were told they have a weekend buffet at 199+ taxes so we opted for that. The buffet had soup which was served on the table. A chicken and a mix veg starter. Chili chicken and mixed veg in gravy, egg noodles and rice and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. For the price they are charging food was good. The chicken starter can be a bit more soft. Ordered a virgin mojito.A suggestion would be to remove the seeds of the lemon while adding in the drink. Otherwise it is uncomfortable to drink. 684 was the bill including tax and service charge. Overall a good experience.

I am at a loss to understand how this restaurant has managed so high ratings as the food i got from 'em was poor in one word! Firstly let me clarify that  my review is based on home delivery solely and i havent dined there(given the quality of food, dont intend to dine anytime soon :-P ) . Anyways, this chinese restaurant is at a stone throw distance from my residence and we for some reason or other hadnt tasted their stuff till then. That night we had ordered mixed friedrice - 2plates, chilli chicken with coriander sauce-1, and tsing hoi chicken-1. I found the quantity enough to serve 3people(we dont eat much). However only friedrice was okeyish. Chilli chicken is apalling, i dont know what spices were used..coz surely dint taste anything like chilli chicken. Either they goofed up or till now i didnt have chilli chicken in my life(which isnt possible). Moving on, tsing hoi chicken was the worst of the lot...the curry resembled more of a momo chutney than anything else...with dry chilli floating in it. One of the worst chinese i had in recent times. Sorry but ...if you build a spanky new restaurant with beautiful interior and courteous staff dresses in suits....you should also focus on your core competency that is food!! Great ambience and high price solely doesnt imply that the food is good....and for a restaurant if the food isnt....then i am afraid my friend you are gonna fall behind in this race of competitive market

Situated near Gitanjali metro station is this quite spacious chinese restaurant offering a decent variety of preparations. Would have given a 4 point rating but for the quantity of food. Prices are steep though the d√©cor, ambiance and taste gives one a sense of satisfaction. We ordered a chicken sweet corn soup, crispy fried chicken in chili plum sauce and double fried chili pork and all the dishes had distinct flavours. This three dish venture of ours drew us a bill of 800/-! Would like to come back here only when my purse is heavily stashed!

Yesterday for the first time I have ordered from The Noodles Hub and it is worth mention that I am fully satisfied with the food as well as with the on time food delivery. My order was consisting of Butter Garlic Fish, Crispy Fried Chicken in Sweet and Sour Sauce, Chicken Stir Fried Hakka Noodles, Chicken Stir Fried Rice and Singapore Rice Noodles and was sufficient for around 4 people.¬†
The Butter Garlic Fish, which was well cooked and perfectly flavored with garlic. I found both Chicken Stir Fried Hakka Noodles, Chicken Stir Fried Rice decent, moderately cooked and with a good amount of chicken chunks. The Crispy Fried Chicken in Sweet and Sour Sauce indeed was a good option to choose for however, Singapore Rice Noodles was amazing ¬†with thin rice noodles flavored with slit red chili and spices.
I am for sure going to try other items from their¬†menu in future.

To the chefs of this restro.. U need to learn how to balance the spice.. hot doesn't mean pouring of chilli flakes in the dish.. there are other restaurants in the area who r serving better food than u ppl... very disappointed.. a 2 star from my side

Again I am back to review my experience in The Noodle Hub.¬†

It was the Puja time that we visited this Chinese restaurant and my experience went quite well.

Firstly, the location of this place is super awesome.. right upon thre NSC bose road.. Our hungry tummies were thus comforted Right after watching Naktala Udayan Sangha..¬†

Coming to the food now.. we ordered Spicy Black Pepper Chicken for starters.. for the main course, we had Sliced Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce, Chicken in Chilli soya and Corriander Sauce, Egg Stir Fried Rice and Pan fried Veg Noodles..The quantity served seemed a bit less at first that made us consider ordering one more plate of noodles.. but later we found our tummies quite full with the food,..so, the quantity served was ample.. the quality of the food was also satisfactory.. the tastes were mind blowing despite me trying pan fried noodles for the first time.. the chicken items were mindblowing too.. the items for the puja menu was less in number bt quite good bt price was a bit overtly increased for the pujas.. still i would consider it quite cheap for authentic and unconventional chinese..

Lastly coming to the services.. the pace seemed to be a tad slow nd the wait too long.. The behaviour of the satffs was cordial but number of staffs need to be increased I guess..

overall my experince was good enough and i would surely recommend it for chinese lovers like me..

An excellent choice for some good & tasty Chinese food. Service is par expectation. Seating & ambience was comfortable and nice. Staffs were very decent and they help you make smart food choice. Hygiene was good.¬†
I opted for takeaways. These guys packed the food and named the containers, which was too good...!! No confusion in what is being served.¬†

My review is solely based on the takeaway I tried today from this new eatery located at Naktala (which looks very posh and spacious)
I had parceled mixed noodles, chicken fried rice and chili chicken. Reading the reviews I had high hopes from this place but I was really disappointed. The rice was fine. The noodles was a little soggy but still edible however the chili chicken!!!! Oh my god. The amount of oil floating on top just makes you feel sick. It was burnt, overcooked and excessively salty. Plain bad. So disappointed. I expected so much better :(
I'd still go there in person to make up my mind finally.

This restaurant is not doubt one of the best chinese outlets in Naktala , Garia area. I was introduced to this place by Shahbaaz Zaman and i thank him for finding out this hidden gem. The food was beautifully presented and was tasty and palatable.Some of the items we tried were-
Laksa Lamak- This was the thick seafood noodle soup. This soup rich , creamy, the coconut milk flavour took this to a new level.
Spicy Chicken and celery dumplings- This is by far the best dumplings that i have ever tasted. The coating is translucent , yet when you cut through the stuffing does not fall apart and the dip augments the taste.
Korean Grilled Chicken- The chicken was beautiful, tasty and spicy
Xing Zang Pork-A bit dry but the dish will no doubt win the hearts of every pork lover.
Leek and Basil Vegetable-This dish is the perfect concoction for the health concious. Richbin exotic vegetables in a light gravy this strikes a perfect balance between health and taste.
Geang Penang Gai- As our host explained Geang means chicken and this was shredded chicken in a rich coconut milk gravy flavoured with herbs.
WholeBhetki In Thai Shiraja Chilli Sauce- Presentation wise one of the best dishes, it had fish in a tangy sweet sauce that is sure to petfectly blend with any rice or noodles.
Jumbo Prawn in Chilli Basil Sauce-The prawns are neautifully sjaped and the gravy is thick and delicious
Steamed Fragrant Rice-This complimented the Chicken dish perfectly.
Chicken Malayasian Noodles-This flat noodles was perfectly done.
Now coming to the dessert, well their dessert surely needs spl mention, firstly for the ingredients used and secondly because of the unique taste.- Tub Tim Grawp was the perfect was to end this amazing dinner. This was made with water chestnut dipped in coconut milk and rosewater.
Let me mention that the restaurant is offering an 8 course buffet at only 200 rupees!!Argha Banerjee , Sebi Ghosh , Alivia Ray , Kaushik Saha ,

Update:(4.11.2017)
I visited this place today to try the buffet menu. The buffet was an eight course meal.
It included
Sweet corn chicken soup. The soup was tasty and served hot.
Crispy vegetable as one of the starters was also delectable and it was crispy as the name suggests.
There was another chicken starter which had basil leaves. It did have tiny bones in the pieces but tasted good nevertheless.
Coming to the main course.
They had egg rice and noodles both of which tasted pretty good. The side dishes included korean chilly chicken and mixed vegetable in white sauce. The chicken in this case was really soft and tasted amazing.
Finally there was darsaan with vanilla icecream which was served unlimited.
There was no limit to how many times you take a particular item which was a plus point. The food was served hot and fresh and also refilled the moment the dishes were over. Overall at this price point of 249 rupees this is a very very good choice.The staff were also very courteous and helpful.

Located very close to Gitanjali metro station, this is a very pretty place. Spread over two floors , this restaurant is well decorated. I had ordered Mixed rice and Crispy fried chicken in sweet and sour sauce. The food and pricing is decent.The quantity is also sufficient. The staff is friendly, which is an added bonus. The only drawback is that they take a lot of time in serving the food.

Located at a distance of 3-4 min walk from the Mastarda Surya Sen ( Naktala area ) metro station right next to the mini bus stand. 
This place looks quite impressive from the outside. With blazing yellow lights reading "The Noodle Hub" 
You are welcomed by a  typical chinese eatery aura. Beautiful red flowery wallpapers and dim yellow lights. 
We had a sumptuous spread  comprising of thai and chinese cuisines
1. Laksa Lamak : an amazing noodle soup with shrimps and dominating coconut flavour with a little tangy taste. Tastes really good 
2. Spicy chicken and celery dumpling : a very fine coating of the dimsum with juicy , tasty chicken filling was one of the best of the evening
3. Korean grilled chicken : thin slices of chicken grilled in korean spices tasted different with a smoky flavour 
4. Lotus stem with chilly plum sauce : This is something out of the world . Crispy pieces of super tasty lotus stem saut√©d in chilli plum sauce was amazing
5 Xing Xang pork : a liitle fibrous though.. the pork tasted good .
6. Leek and basil vegetables : since i do not like such dishes i wouldnt be a correct person to judge but from the others across the table it seemed to be a nice one
7. Gaeng Penang Gai : now Gai means chicken in Thai. This dish was coconut gravy based with peanuts. Tasted yum and complemented well with the fragrant rice.
8. Fragrant steamed rice : fresh amromatic fine rice was good for a main course
9. Malaysian chicken noodles : Flat noodles with chicken tasted perfect 
10. Tub Tim Grawp : a coconut based dessert moctail with water chestnut dipped in rose syrup stole the show. It was amazing and a *must have* for dessert. Its one of a kind.
Thank you

Location : If you are travelling by metro, get down at Gitanjali(Naktala) metro station and then ask your way to the Naktala mini bus stand(3 minute walk). This place is located just near The mini bus stand.

We ordered via swiggy. In one word, the food was horrible. The worst of the lot was Mixed fried rice. There was no veggies. The prawn pieces were mashed and smelly. There were hardly three to four chicken pieces. Pan fried noodles was bland and tasteless. Sliced chicken in hot garlic sauce was a watery curry made of lal mirch powder. We called the restaurant afterwards. They didnt even apologize. Made it apparent that they didint care.

Very near to the Naktala Bus Stand. Dined in here last Saturday. This place caters a variety of Chinese cuisines. Wr ordered American Choupsyey  and Crispy Chilly Baby Corn. The baby corn was satisfying, but, the American Choupsyey, oh my my, it was way too sweet, I could literally see honey on my plate while having my choupsyey. Nevertheless, it has a very nice ambiance and the staff is polite and courteous. 
But it was not worthy of Rs.416 for these dishes atleast!  And on top of that they were not accepting cards and we got to know that when we had to pay. I mean atleast you should your customers beforehand to avoid such harassments!

This place has a weird interior like its food. Didn't understand the meaning of the painting inside. It was copied from MANGA Comics. Food : Pathetic..First time saw a Pan Fried Noodles in white sauce ( only cornflour ). Tsing Hoi Chicken was the worst. Dipped in a mixture of sauces which gave zero taste. Only bright point the Tom Yum Soup. But the overall experience has forced me not to visit this place again.

The Noodle Hub has really got a good exterior. A symbol of fish across the restaurant is a big attraction. It has done its job and made me curious to explore it.

Ambience is nice. ¬†Staff were cordial.

But the menu is extremely average and no signature dish.¬†

However the taste for all the dishes ordered i.e Pan fried noodles, Devil Pork and Thai Mango Pudding is good in nature.

Special suggestion that one should try the Thai Mango Pudding it is really nice

This is another joint near my home popular by word of mouth....

The home delivery was quite on-time in a committed time frame of 40min considering the multiple items on order....

We had ordered pan fried prawn-veg noodles, chilly chicken, mushroom in ginger-chilly & fish in mayo-mustard sauce....for the entire effort the bill was ‚Çπ979....seemed a tad bit higher but then the amounts were good so seems ok....quality & taste were above avg but the sauces provided with the noodles was less than expectations....the packaging / hygiene was avg / just about ok

Overall a gud buy & worth the buck spent....

Very simply one if the best pork preparations I had ..and yes , my recommendation is the honey chili pork. The service and humbled response from people around will make you come back again. Noodle hub is simply YUMMMMMM!!!

Visited there few weeks ago... this place is located near my home so went there to spend some time in an evening. We ordered veg fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and fruit punch... fruit punch tastes really delicious but veg rice and the chicken were not upto the mark. Beside all this, what I really disliked about this place is the way all the staffs stared at us... they kept staring all the time and that made the ambience extremely uneasy and ridiculous... anyway, it can be tried out if you have little bit of time and less money...

RIght on through road and very near to Gitanjali metro, this place has an excellent location. But that's about it! Food is average. 
Sweet corn chicken soup ... too sweet. Classic dishes should be perfected.
Prawn spring roll... actually veg roll with few prawns which is not adequate even to add flavor...and the filling is grossly overdone.
Mixed fried rice .... good, best of the lot.
Prawn with greens and garlic...nice. the greens consist of ch. cabbage, bell pepper and broccoli.
Soya chilli chicken with coriander sauce..
quite spicy and would suit the palate of foodies who loves indianised Chinese.
Chicken haka noodles ... nothing special
Darsan .. crispy and well made, but served without icecream...we had to order it separately....
price ... very affordable
ambiance ....good
service .... there is scope for improvement

Had spotted the place a couple of times so to celebrate mom's birthday we landed up there... first the positives.. nice decor, comfortable sitting...clean restroom...food is good...but quantity is very less... specially main course.... service is fast but the waiters do not know how to serve...with five of us....it was like the first three were given proper serving but the last two landed up with hardly two spoons...on commenting they picked up from the other plates n redistributed....a complete no no....for the remaining we preferred to serve ourselves...dim sums were not available...price n quantity don't go hand in hand...overall a ok type of experience..might prefer home delivery than visiting again...

This place has come up recently located very near to my house. I was planning to visit this place soon and it was a Sunday afternoon that laziness trapped us so much that finally we got food ordered from here.
We called the place up, ordered food over phone and my brother went to collect the food from the place. It came in the usual plastic containers labelled with names of dishes on it written with permanent markers.
Chicken Sui Mai, Pan Fried Chilli Fish were there in the starters. For main course, we had taken Singapore Rice Noodles and Chilli Garlic Noodles along with Hunan Prawns and Roasted Pork in Orange Sauce.
The sui mais were good. We were actually looking for prawn ones but they were not available although mentioned in the menu. They also had a variety of dim sums mentioned in the menu, none of which were available except for the chicken sui mais. Hence we were one way forced to take this. The dimsums tasted good itself. But they didn't give us the proper sui mai sauce, instead a spicy red sauce served with momos generally at roadside stalls.
I must say that the main course was not at all up to the mark. The Singapore Rice Noodles was so oily and tasteless. None of us liked this. In Chilli Garlic Noodles, the balance of red chilli sauce was on the higher side. It was spicy and hot. Not at all suitable to every taste buds. Hunan Prawns were good. But the portion was too less compared to the price and quality. Roasted Pork in Orange Sauce was very good. The portion was sufficient, taste was delicious. It had a tangy sweet thing still we could devour the non veg meaty aroma. Our choice and also recommended by the person over the phone, this was absolutely delightful. Love every bit of it.
Except for the pork dish, other dishes were either too bad or portion was less. Even the quality wasn't that good because one of my friends got his stomach upset after having food from here. Can't rate it anymore for now because we got the food delivered at home. Maybe later, if there's a chance of a dine in experience at The Noodle Hub, the rating may go higher. Till then, Happy Dining! :)

Amazzingg!!l went there 2-3 times,with very little expectations tbh.However,the food bowled me over.We were a large group and had ordered dry chilly chicken & crispy fried chicken in sweet and sour sauce for starters,mixed fried rice(without pork),gravy chicken noodles,hot garlic chicken in gravy,stir fried chicken in hot basil sauce,chicken in chilly soya and coriander sauce,& darshaan with ice cream for dessert.Each one of the dishes is spectacular except for the stir fried chicken in hot basil sauce.It was way too sour and tangy for me and no one quite liked it much.The other dishes were but lipsmacking.The ambience would be a 3.6 out of 5. Can't wait to visit again.Good job!

Located just beside Arambagh near to Naktala Petrol pump, this is a new eatery. Decorated well and the ambience is good. The fried rice is very light and dry. White rice with small pieces of chicken and egg, quite different from normal fried rice served in restaurants. The Chicken sweet corn soup is good, bt a bit too sweet taste. The Tsing Hoi chicken was good. The hakka noodles is very good. Would prefer the noodles than the rice here.Overall a decent place.

After reading da postive reviews about their khao suey i ws really eager to try it! So after trying it i ws nothing but massively disappointd. Either the people giving it good reviews havnt had a proper khao suey or i ws really unlucky and the chef screwd it up. The proportion and the consistency of da gravy ws totally off. Too much gravy nd it tasted bad!! They should take it off from their specials list. The pan fried noodles ws decent if nit amazing. The noodle hub failed to impress me heavily.

Do you remember that eatery which you call it your own find? Maybe you chanced upon it while taking a stroll with a friend? Or it was you shelter on a rainy afternoon? Or just an experiment after you have been thoroughly bored with the BarBQs and Mainland Chinas of the city? And after a breath taking experience, you have badgered all your friends till they have tried this place; and now they have accepted your ideology and call you its brand ambassador? And whoever new you meet and end up talking about food, you always suggest this place? While no one has heard of this place, you can‚Äôt stop talking about it after your chanced-experience? Well this is what happened to me when I was invited for a food event with a group foodies to Noodle Hub!! If you know what this feeling is, I‚Äôm sure you are on you way there and just browsing through my blog to see what to eat. :P¬† If you have never had this experience, then just trust me ‚Äì get up, go, eat at Noodle Hub and that‚Äôs all you will be talking about the next few weeks!! 

Tucked away in a far corner of Kolkata, Noodle Hub is a true FIND! I started off and after a lot of twists and turns, traffic jams,stopping people on en-route to ask the way, GPS confusions resulting in low battery; I reached more than an hour later. Noodle Hub surpassed all my expectations, from food to decor everything was impeccable. Frankly I was expecting it to be a small eatery with nothing special to offer, but now it has become one of my favorite Pan-Asian joints in the city. It was a two story restaurant, how many even big brand names have that? The place is huge! With ornamented wallpaper in white and red, Chinese posters,wall hangings, beautifully sculptured hanging lights, An elegant stairway, bold wooden furniture, & paintings of buddha this place looked sober and enigmatic. The Owner, Sanjoy Roy and his associate Dipanjan Ghosh where the perfect hosts and when we got to chatting, I learnt so much from them about Pan-Asian delicacies. It was a lovely experience.

Reasons To Visit:
Exquisite Food
Cheap Prices
Bored of Run-Of-The-Mill Chinese? ‚Äì This is the place for you

Must Haves:
I cannot pick a few, because everything that I had was purellyyyyy delicious!! Try anything from below and you will not be let down!!

We started our foodathon with Fresh-Lime-Soda (salted). It s was nice and refreshing. Then Prawn Hargaon & Chicken Sui Mai came. Both came with an helping of a Garlic-Chili-Tomato Sauce. The Prawn Hargaon was basically a version of prawn momo, it had lots of minced, fresh prawn and tasted yummilicious! The Chicken Sui Mai was primarily chicken dumplings, it too had lots of stuffing. The dumplings and momos were a grand beginning to a grand feast !! There were hands down one of the best I had, had in a long long time. The meat was fresh, juicy, well marinated, basically everything that one can hope and dream for!! 

Then Gai Shai Takrai came, it was a fried chicken¬† starter with lots of lemon grass, chilies, onions & garlic. This was a the show stopper of the evening!! The portion was huge, the flavors were just perfect and the taste was plain mind blowing. I loved it!! While I was still trying to scrap of any remains from the bowl of Gai Shai Takrai, the Chicken Khao Suey arrived. THIS IS THE BEST KHAO SUEY I HAVE EVER HAD!!! The presentation was beautiful, with small bowls of chopped chilies, coriander leaves, lemon, burnt garlic, spring onion, golden fried onion, crispy rice and a giant sized bowl of the main Khao Suey. The Khao Suey was plain heavenly! With the first mouthful I was captivated by its rich, yet sweetish and nutty flavor. If you are ever here, this dish is a must try!

The came Plain Rice and Thai Green Curry. The green curry was PERFECT!! It was rich & creamy, with the right amount of lemon grass, coconut milk, chicken strips and mushroom!! OHHH!! I love Thai food and this was plain ecstasy!! Malaysian Noodles arrived soon. Its primarily a version of Pad Thai. It was quite delicious, though I would have liked some more prominent flavors in it. With the noodles, we were served Prawn in Hunan Sauce, Pakchoy in Oyster Sauce, Roasted Pork in Orange, Sauce Sliced Fish with Green and Garlic. The prawn came in a red spicy sauce, the pieces were huge, another addition to the lovely dinner that I was having. As the evening passed my experience went from good to great to plain WOOOWWW!! The Pakchoy in Oyster Sauce was exquisite. This dish is mainly Chinese Cabbage (Pockchoy) and Mushroom with other veggies in a black oyster sauce. It‚Äôs subtle, fresh flavors simply engulfed me!! The Roasted Port in Orange Sauce was spicy and tasted very different from the others!! This dish was very palatable and I was left licking the spoon. OHH MY!! WHAT AN ENDING ‚Äì The Sliced Fish with Green and Garlic was¬† perfection personified. This white gravy dish came with lots of fresh veggies like bell pepper, broccoli, pakchoy among others.¬† 

For desserts we had, Thai Mango Pudding and Chocolate Wanton. The pudding was very innovative, and had a sour-y fresh taste. The¬† wantons had fresh baked brownie stuffing and garnished with chocolate sauce. They were yummmiliciousss!!

This Pan-Asian Casual Dinning won my heart and soul. I Thank Sanjoy for this lovely experience and wish the Team of Noodle Hub all the very best for the Future!!

The place was on 5he checklist for long. A big thank u to my colleague for treating me to lunch here. 

I had come here having some assumptions as to how its going to be and how would it feature against the assumptions I had about Authentic and good Chinese. Also the fact that it is of the same owner as Mainland China made us expect a lot out of the place.

The ambience and decor was really good. It had a Oriental feel to it. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The outlet is two storied and has a calm n cosy feel to it. 

The food was extraordinary. We ordered the honey glazed chili pork which was simply finger licking good. For mains we ordered the Cantonese Panfried Mixed Noodles and the Tai Chin Fish. Both the dishes were sufficient in quantity and superb in quality. The seafood was fresh and had was utterly satisfying.

Will be back here for sure. Had a lovely experience
Cheers.

Located far far away from part street, it was a treasure hunt of sorts for me, finding¬†The Noodle Hub¬†at Naktala.¬†I was , in all honesty and with all due respect, expecting this place to be a very humble, small chinese eatery. No sooner my cab arrived its destination however, I was stunned! Stunned by the sheer size of this place. Two Storeys for a Chinese diner is unheard of. And the place was packed when I left, so its not all vacant space!
                                                                ...

Craving for Chinese? Bored with old ones or big names? Here is the one stop solution - The noodle hub .. Yes I can bet you and vouch on the food which surely gonna satisfy you totally.

**Location**
This place is a easy find located on the NSC Bose road at Naktala crossing right on the road and clearly visible one and a big one indeed. It's right beside the Naktala mini bus stand.

**Decor & Ambiance**
The two stored restaurant was decorated very simply and neatly with decorated wallpapers and hanging cute designer lamps all around. The Chinese paintings were just setting up the theme just perfect. Loved their exteriors very much very eye catching.

**Food**
This where they score the best. Their best part of the food.
Food was really commendable in terms of taste, quality and quantity.

Starters:
Prawn har gao: Lovely blend of prawns stuffed in Dimsum is perfect start of the evening.
#Recommended

Chicken sui mai:

Gai sai takrai: Chicken starter with lemon grass flavor tossed in sauce this starter was yummy.
#MUSTTRY

Chicken khao suey:
This Burmese delicacy was very well made and presented well. All raw ingredients fried onions, garlic , corriender etc were served with the soup which was egg deeped into it... Very very delicious..
#HighlyRecommended

Mains:
Sliced fish with green & garlic: Fish was fresh and the quality was also maintained.

Roast pork in orange sauce: Loved the pork dish a lot specially the orange sauce was delicious with it.. Amazing
#Porkloversdelight

Chicken Thai green curry: The Thai curry had very distinctive flavor and blend well with soft juicy chicken pieces. Went well with the steamed rice.

Prawn Hunan sauce:
Prawn size was generous and with the Hunan sauce it was divine.

Pakchoy in oyster sauce: Pakchoy with oyster sauce was for trying different veg variety.

Malaysian Noodles: I simply loved this noodles made with Thai noodles was simply the perfect one with the mains

Desserts: Though the dessert is not their forte but this had a chance to try some.

Thai Mango Pudding: Decent in taste a little different one. Not too sweet at all

Chinese choco wantons: A nice way to sum up the whole food experience.

**Service**
Service was absolutely spot on. We were sitting on the 1st floor of the restaurant and the ground floor was filled with other guests but still there was no gap at all. Everything was on order and worth a visit.

I was here on an invitation by Mr. Sanjoy Roy the owner whom I would like to thank for having us there with him. He was just a perfect host for the evening. Thanks a lot and All the best for your future endeavors.

This brand new place welcomes its guest with a lovely decorated exterior. Very novel. The inside space is a bit crampy and small. The items we tried there were all well cooked and very flavoursome. I'm definitely visiting again.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:
Newly opened at Naktala (Near the mini bus stand). The name itself gives you a brief idea of what this place will be all about. When it comes to noodles it has to be Chinese for sure, when we talk about Chinese this place gives you the perfect blend of Chinese authenticity. From the look to the table the atmosphere spreads some positivity in you to be more eager for this place.¬†

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:
The outside look is quite promising so is the inside with a decor of giant fish at the top . At the main door i met Mr. Dipanjan who greeted me with a warm welcome. Its a fine diner with two floored sitting arrangement with good numbers of tables in the ground as well as the second 1st floor with all chilled air conditioned. With quite cool wallpapers and soothing music you feel good enough and the atmosphere surely make you feel like China.¬†
Service was on a satisfactory note with only one person serving us on the table. ¬†Still i believe it could have been much better on the service side. And special thanks to Subrath for taking the hardship of serving us on the table. Management was very cooperative and friendly on the other hand to deal with us.

FOOD AND BEVERAGES:
The evening started well with few outstanding refreshers and later with some mind blowing food on the tables. List as follows:

--DRINKS--

1. Fresh Lime Soda Sweet-Sweet and Salt: Both the drinks were very refreshing, served twice in two different glasses still managed to maintain the taste to the same level.

--STARTERS--

2. Chicken Sui Mui : The dimsums were pretty good. The outer layer was soft enough filled with good amount of chicken and steamed almost to perfect.

3. Prawn Hargao : It looked quite cute and decorated nicely. The quality of prawn was fresh enough.

4. Chicken Khao Suey: This was my second try to Khao suey and surprisingly this was better from the previous one. Sliced cut egg on the above with saffron in color. Filled with sliced chicken and noodles and corns tasted pretty nice.

5. Gai Sai Thakrail : This was certainly one the finest one on the table. Every person just loved it. From the decoration to the marination and to the preparations it was i guess flawless. ¬†Quantity was very good in number and it tasted awesome.

--MAIN COURSE--

6. Sliced Fish with Green and Garlic : Sliced pieces of fish with garlic flavor, smell was really nice and so was the taste. Very soft and the blend was coming in the tongue.

7. Prawn in Hunan Sauce : Again a great choice for the main course. The quality of the prawn do surprised me again with the taste was just fabulous. Marination was excellent came with good number of veggies in it, soft and juicy.

8. Pakchoy in Oyster sauce : It was good but could have been much better i think.¬†

9. Malaysian Noodles : Flat noodles with veggies. Looked appealing and tasted the same too. Something different in form of noodles for me. Liked it!

10. Steam Rice : It was a normal rice with good quality.

11. Chicken Thai Green Curry : Green curry with sliced chicken in it. Contained seasonal veggies in it thou average in taste but going well with the rice.

--DESSERTS--

12. Thai Mango Pudding : After looking at it expectations were high but got lil disappointed. I hoped this to be a bit pulpy in the center. i guess over freezing was something made it worse.

QUALITY AND QUANTITY:
Quality was spot on. Each and every dish we had were as fresh it can be. The raw materials used were very good. Quantity wise all the dishes were enough for two in a single order.

CONCLUSION:¬†
It was such an pleasing experience having such great food and all thanks to Mr. Roy for having us. I wish Team Noodle Hub all the best and wish them to open their new branch soon at Jodhpur park if m not mistaken. Cheers!

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Noodle Hub is one of the newest and promising authentic chinese restaurant available in the Naktala area near Gitanjali metro station.

‚òÜAMBIANCE AND DECO‚òÜ
Ambiance was very nice and this restuarant has seating arrangements divided between two floors. Decorated with paintings and chinese wallpaper. I liked a lot.

‚òÜService and Management‚òÜ
The management was fine and properly maintained by his co owner Mr. Roy and now I would mention Mr Subrath our server on that evening, he did a great job but there is a room for improvement in service.

‚òÜDrinks‚òÜ
Tried sweet lime soda and sweet and salty lime soda. Both were perfect.

‚òÜStarters‚òÜ
They served us two kind of dimsums,
‚óèChicken Sui Mui: I liked that particular dimsum, very juicy and tasty.
‚óèPrawn Hargao: It was also good.

Another starters that we tried was,
‚óèKhao Suey: Am not the very fond of Khao suey but it was perfect and taste great.
‚óèGai Sai Thakrai: Very good quantity of chicken, excellent choice for starter and the quantity available for 3 peoples easily.

‚òÜMain Course‚òÜ
In main course they served plenty of dishes and those were,
‚óèSliced Fish with Green and Garlic: Very soft and well cooked that was.. I liked a lot.
‚óèPrawn in Hunan Sauce: Again another fabulous dish from them, very big portion and plenty of tiger prawns available on that dish.
‚óèChicken Thai Green Curry: Its average. Nothing special.
‚óèPakchoy in Oyster sauce: Pure veg item, taste was average.
‚óèMalaysian Noodles: Flat noodles tossed with vegetables with flavoured sauce. Taste was unique and good.
‚óèSteam Rice: Normal.

‚òÜDesserts‚òÜ
They served two desserts.
‚óáThai Mango Pudding: I don't like pudding but I liked there a lot.
‚óáChocolate Wanton: Wanton contains brownie, not very sweet. Perfect balanced. Quite good.

I would call this place a hidden gem. A place in naktala serving such amazing food was hard to believe. I being a very critical person could hardly find flaws here. It's a two stored resturant, the one at the ground floor being more Functional. Simple and classy interiors with amazing hostsstarted my lovely experience for the evening. We started our meal with a chicken dimsum which was astonishing. A khowsuey came next which stole my heart, it was the best khowsuey I have ever had, you have to heave to believe it. Next was a prawn hargao which was perfect from within, the outer covering I felt was a little thick, tasted good enough. A chicken takrai which made me steal a peice from my friends place,too good. We jumped on to the main course next a stunning green thai curry with fluffy rice,it was just so subtle yet elegant. On my request we got pakchoy in oyster sauce with mushroom and I loved the dish. The Malaysia noodles were flawless. The hunan prawn had big fresh prawn cooked to perfection. The fish with Asian greens was a delight,it just melted in my mouth. We ended our meal with thai mango pudding which was decent, a very different from conventional ones. The  chocolate roll which came next was too good. I don't generally rate places this high but the noodle hub deserved every bit of it :) amazing job team...

Located very near to the Gitanjali Metro stop, this restaurant is a real gem in this area. Beside ala-carte they also serve combo lunch packages(for single and coupon). We redeemed our Nearbuy voucher and ordered a chinese lunch. To start with, we had clear soup, fresh lime soda, and chicken starters. The main course was also delicious and the quantity enough for the six of us. The service is quick and the staff friendly. Vanilla ice-creams were served for desserts A scrumptious lunch, overall.

Mixed Hakka Noodles... Stir Fried Chicken Rice...Sliced Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce...name it...taste it...love it... Serving with passion @ 11:30PM speaks high about the culture of this place.

My first visit to this restaurant with my friends. The ambience was quite nice. And yes..the food was great! The names on the menu were tempting! We wanted to try something new and risked it. But those dishes won our hearts. Each tasted different from the other. The communication with the waiters were not great still it was fine and of course you can't expect a huge professional waiter serving you when you know its a new restaurant. I will definitely recommend this place to others! And I m planning to try their home delivery service too. Hope to give them 5 stars after my second trip to this place!

The next door restaurant and I ordered through swiggy. As per the menu I ordered chicken stir fry, chicken in hot garlic sauce,
In noodles I had ordered Malaysian and chicken noodle and also ordered chicken stir fry rice.
They called and informed that they don't have Malaysian noodles and replacement gave Singapore noodles.
The dishes were bit spicy and Singapore noodles was too dry
But felt the restaurant is average 
Food 3.5/5

But most of the foods were not up to the mark..They didn't have most of the dishes which were written on the menu card..Pan fried fish was good,but dry chili chicken was very salty..Conzy Crispy lamb was so so..The mixed fried rice was good & also the prawn preparation..

I went to this place on Sunday evening with my family. We ordered roasted pork, fish in oyster sauce, prawns, chicken fried rice and Singapore rice noodles. All the dishes except for the rice noodles were simply awesome! The rice noodles were chewy and hard, Chowman beat them to it, but the rest were as amazing as Chowman. My family is very fond of Meifoon/rice noodles, so if they don't make it good, we wont be able to go back much, which is a pity. The place is nice.

There is a lot in the menu and almost all dishes are available whether chicken,fish, prawns or pork. The service is good and fast. Quality and quantity both are as per the price.

A nice snug place with an amicable ambience and minimal d√©cor. The food quality was not excellent and was akin to Indian Chinese. Went on a busy Navami night and was relieved to be seated without waiting may be because it was relatively new.

The Coriander Soup was extremely thin and pungent and the Sliced Chicken was actually more like light battered chicken pakora. The Double Fried Chilli Pork was probably the only fulfilling dish. The noodles and the rice were nothing great either but Tsing Hoi Chicken and Spicy Black Pepper Chicken helped to finish it off.

An okay place to visit if you are looking for some coziness, where you can sit with your partner or friends and are ready to compromise on the food to some extent.

Last weekend i had dinner in this eating house.I had Golden fried prawns for the starter followed with thick lemon coriander soup.for the main course I had Tai chin chicken & mixed Hakka noodles.This food joint has adequate seating arrangement.Parking available just on the next by lane of this restaurant.Soup was nothing very astounding.Noodles was tasty but tai chin fish was a big let down.Though the quality of the Fish was good but the preparation was not at all good.

I normally never review places this low, but this place is an exception.

We ordered, and we waited and waited. We waited over an hour for the starters, and then over 40 mins for the main course. Then another 25 mins for the bill,

The double fried pork was a horrendous. They totally wasted the opportunity.
The rice noodle was average and the prawn in picked chilli sauce was below average.

3.5/5 for ambience, 0.5 for food, 0 for service.

Never coming again. Would never recommend anyone to come either.

The Noodle Hub is a relatively new restaurant in Naktala, near the Banti Petrol Pump! The place is very inviting from the outside! The restaurant is not that big, but is decorated in a very nice way! I have been to this place twice by now! Ordered the Spicy Black Pepper Chicken and Crispy Chicken with Plum Sauce, Mixed Fried Rice, Chili Fish, and a Sweet Corn Soup. The soup was pretty average ( too sweet for my taste). The starters are good, although they can improve the quantity. The Mixed Fried Rice and the Chili Fish is just brilliant and can give any other restaurant a run for their money. Overall, the quality of the food is superb. Service is very, very poor and they take a long time to serve your food! By the way, prices are tax inclusive which makes this place very cheap! If they can improve their service, this place has everything in favour of it!Give it a try! I am sure they won't disappoint!

Wouldn't know how the food is because after waiting for almost an hour we did not get our order and had find another restaurant at 11 pm. Service is severely lacking. When we enquired after 20 minutes or so, the guy who took our order said it was getting ready. But after almost an hour when we could not see that guy and another person there went to check their system, he could not find our order. When enquired with the guy who took our order, he could not even remember the order and started making excuses like the food was served to some oter table then he asked for more time, etc. In the 1 hour that I spent in the restaurant almost all the tables had one problem or another. One of the tables got thier fresh lime after completing their meal, people who ordered takeaway had to wait not because of food but because their bill was not ready. As we left, it did not seem to bother them either. I liked their menu but not going ever again.

Well this is a new Chinese joint next to naktala petrol pump..... Decent interiors covering 2 floors... Music in the background...moderately lit.... I must say staff very courteous and helpful... Scope for improvement is there as they are not very adept in explaining the dishes to a layman... But still the effort is there... Now coming to food... 
For starters we had:
Sichuan chili baby corn - its ur regular crispy chili baby corn with a fancy name is what i felt..... Tasted good....

Spicy black pepper chicken - A very nice &  hot preparation with black pepper... Well cooked and perfect for ur taste buds... 

Butter Garlic fish - its more of a fish dipped in batter and fried... Taste OK.. 

Hot & sour veg soup - Regular prep with regular taste

Main Course:
Stir fried chicken rice - seemed more like steamed rice with chicken chunks.... The fried part was missing

Chili Garlic noodles - very very well prepared... One should have it if has a craving for something hot nd spicy

Seasonal vegies mixed in hot garlic sauce - they give u this mix of seasonal vegies with a gravy of hot garlic... Tasted gud but was the vegies were too crunchy

Tsing hoi chicken - a spicy dish in red gravy... Well prepared & well tasted

Fresh lamb in sapo sauce -  Preparation not out of the world.... Lamb pieces were chewey..... So i would go for this dish once again... The lamb should be more soft. 

Dessert:
Darsaan - a nice dish... Its more of small pieces of papad dipped in honey... Goes very well with a scoop of vanilla ice cream 

Price: I would say its ok... Around 15-20 bucks less per dish compared to other renowned Chinese joints.... Also they do not charge any taxes at all.... We paid around 2300 bucks for six of us... So good value for money... I would definitely go once again to try some other dishes of theirs... May be som dimsums this time... Will review once again after i visit.... But i must say with some minor tweaks nd changes... They can be a very popular joint in the coming days...

Not going to rate this place. Had ordered the 'Crispy fried dry fried chicken' for home as a tester, because it had just opened up. It cost some 195 bucks, but shockingly the guys handed me a very light container, which was the first dampener(unexpectedly light). When we tried it, it was 8 pieces of very thinly sliced fried chicken that tasted worse than peyaji, and had no taste and definitely did not live up to the price or the name! The restaurant that was here before "Red Earth" was a local disaster.. This one isn't far behind it seems. Having tried places like Hatari and Chowman and plenty others, this one will never be visited by us again.

It came as a pleasant surprise to find out this Dine out, one just cannot miss it if you are coming down the N.S.C.Bose Road. I took my time out to venture into this hot-spot and I was swept off my feet.The Decor..Par Excellence & the food was equally intriguing. I took the Double fried Chilli pork to start off..then the Prawn Sui Mai, followed by the Chicken Khao Suey...All as per their recommendations & I must say all of them were simply mindblowing. Wanted to try the Date Pancake...but by then I ran out of steam, hopefully next time.....Looking forward to my next visit.

We saw the Noodle Hub on our way and just decided to visit them for lunch. Its very inviting from outside. We reached towards the end of lunch time and was happy to see them welcome us with a smile.

Interior 2.5
The interior is nice but NOT Asian. Nor is the music. But the menu looked interesting

Soup and Starter 4
We started with the Chicken Khao Suey Soup. Its Burmese style soup with a Coconut based gravy server with crispy rice and crispy noodle, along with julienne ginger and wedge of lemon....looked tempting tasted amazing. We loved the soup esp. in a winter afternoon. Thick and full of veggies, and generous pieces of chicken. The crispy rice and noodle complemented the smooth texture. Ginger and lemon balanced the taste of coconut base soup.
Then came our lovely wings. Perfectly fried and covered with a balanced thai sweet chilli sauce. We anyway love wings and this was surely well made. So it deserves a 'yummm'.

Main course 2.5
DISAPPOINTING. We ordered stir fried hakka noodle and chicken in Hot Basil sauce. The noodle was over cooked and hence too soft. Not much veggie and no sign of proper stir fry. The chicken was badly coated. You could taste the powdery corn starch. The sauce was good but nothing amazing. Overall we just lost the initial wow. It felt like the chef just asked a helper (not even the sous) to prep the main course while he went for a break.

Service 3.5
Nice and warm. You will feel welcome.

Overall 3
Just for the Soup, Wings and the service. Also the price was reasonable. We will probably try once more esp. because they promised us a authentic chinese soupy noodle. But you are around them and are hungry, try them. If you want good noodle, i dont recommend them yet. They opened in mid Oct 2015 and probably need time to settle down with their chef first.

The elevation of 'Noodle Hub' attracts the sight at the very onset. The inside decor, the sitting space, the upholstery and ¬†the cutleries are of highest standard.The starters , soups are absolutely different from what we are used to get in Kolkata'n Chinese restaurants except big names.. I want leave for others to find out how the main course delicacies are being served by their own rather being guided by my comments...

I wish I could rate this place more than 5.¬†A spacious place with ever smiling courteous staff- this place greets you affectionately right since you take the first step in. ¬†

Coming to food, noodle hub is definitely THE place for a ala carte. The crispy chicken with chilly plum sauce is an amazing experience. They serve sichuan chilly baby corn, fresh mashroom in ginger chilly, golden fried prawn all veg & nonveg delicacious. C. In main course we have tried roast pork in orange sauce. We had ¬†a fresh lime soda to gulp down the starters and it was perfectly refreshing. ¬†Overdose of good food for the day.

Fabulous pork, prawns and pickled chicken. Khau suey is part of Burmese cuisine. A meal by itself. As a part of a deli menu, it did surprise me, but a delicious one indeed! 
If I wanted a meal with a friend in the neighbourhood, this will be the place. Am looking forward to it expanding soon to my neighbourhood

This place is an awesome place to be in. The ambiance is so nice and pleasant. The staff has taken care of every little detail in making the restaurant look so very nice and classy. The food was really good. Even that, they have even included some delicious new recipes. So the foodies can keep experimenting. The quantity of the food is good. Their service is very very nice. I would also like to add that dining here is easy on the pocket. They impose no taxes. Would love to be there again. :)

I have seen this restaurant while passing through Naktala. The exterior of the restaurant  is very interesting. So decided to try this out. Well decorated two floored restaurant. They serve chinese as well as Thai dishes. We have ordered a hot and sour soup and chicken sui mai. The soup tasted quite simple, nothing special in it but the sauce served with sui mai was really tasty. One of the staffs suggested us to try pan fried noodles.The noodle was very tasty with lots of veggies in it. Along with it we have tried chicken in bell pepper sauce. Light gravy,soft chicken pieces and good in taste. The staff also insisted to try darsaan in dessert with vanilla ice cream. Those who have a sweet tooth can really go for this. Over all the restaurant is quite impressive but the staffs need to be prompt as they were a little baffled handling the crowd at peak hours. They also need to sort out their menu.  Having lot of stuffs printed but not available for order does not make sense. But they have just opened. Hope they will sort this out.

It is a welcome addition in the Naktala location. we as a resident of Naktala waiting for a good dining place. I must write my experience of my last visit which was just after puja.¬†
Ambience : very pleasant and modern interior but the exterior is amazing and very eye catching.¬†
Food : we had below items.
1) chicken coriander soup: a lemony thick soup with very good coriander flavour. people who like coriander flavour will enjoy the soup.
2) Prawns in Hunan sauce : Wow! it was great piece of art, awesome flavour and high quality prawns.
3) Mixed hakka noodles : very good quality noodles with generous quantity of veggies and non veg.¬†
4) Ginger rice : best quality farm grains of rice.¬†
5) Pork in devils sauce : I think they serve the best roast pork in town. I will go to this place again again for the pork preparation only.¬†

Overall a must visit place for all the chinese food lovers. Well done

A new addition in our area which opened last month during durga puja which demonstrated a very good marketing strategy to up their name during the busy puja days. A very attracting name & place. Their main branch is in mumbai & now they are expanding their chain slowly & steadily starting from kolkata.

I have mainly had take aways from this joint. Till now i have tried the following items:-

1. Chicken fried rice- Very light in taste made with chicken & spring onions. They dont use any veggies which would resemble of chowman. To enjoy their fried rice,one must take a spicy side dish or else they wont enjoy their meal.

2. Chicken hakka chow- Typical indo chinese chow made with generous amounts of chicken & veggies. They chow which they use is of much better quality than you would find in any place in this area.

3. Stir fried chicken- A great chicken side dish which must be tried. Made with bell peppers,capsicums & onions. The dish consists of good chunks of chicken giving a tangy & salty taste which exactly what i like.

4. Crispy chilli babycorn- spicy babycorn made with parsley/dhania. A treat for any spicy food lover

5. Chilli fish(dry)- Had tried this in my first try but it didn't Impress me much since it lacked proper seasoning & had too much of pepper which disbalanced it's taste. Hope they have improved upon it by now.

This place offers expensive food if compared with other food outlets present here but also the quality of food they serve is also of higher quality. So as a foodie i would happily like to visit this place week in & week out. Keep up the good work guys!!
