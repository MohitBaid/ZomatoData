Always makes me nostalgic each time i visit this punjabi take away outlet located just at the corner of new market and new empire. The only place in kolkata that i die to visit only to have the chana and kulcha. Have been visiting this eater since my childhood days with my mom. They have small seating area inside and a few stools in front of the shop.

Their chola bhatura is a must have for me whenever I am in the new market area.
The bhatura is soft and delicious and I specially love the chilli tangy chutney they serve with the chola.
The place is very reasonable though being a stall the seating is not comfortable.

Location: A stone's throw from Citi Mart; at the dogleg from Citi Mart to SimPark Mall.

This small eatery has been here for years now serving majorly Chola Bhatura along with a few other types of chaat which include Samosa Chaats and also fresh fruit juices.
The ambiance isn't something to mention as its pretty non-descript just has plastic stools as seating arrangements.

Sampled the Chola Bhatura from the items on offer:

- The Chola visually looked decent but was just about average to taste. Needed little more flavoring. Have had better from a similar kind of eatery.
- The Bhaturas [2 pieces] were neither hot nor fluffy and was way too greasy.
- Was served along with a green chilli & lemon chutney (tasted average) and sliced onion.
As a whole the dish highly disappointed me. One can purely give this place a miss.

Prices were reasonable but, the quality failed to justify the low prices!
Service was quick by the smiling Staff.

â€¢ The eatery adjacent to this place serves a better quality of the same fare.

Overall a bad experience.
- Would revisit for the remaining fare, comments due.

I didn't even know the name of this outlet until my brother told me despite having their chole bhature since I don't even remember when!
And finding it on zomato was like the best thing ever xD

Anyway, this outlet is situated near citimart. It is the very first outlet of this lane. I loooove love loooooooovvvve their chole bhature. Specially the bhatura which is just so soft and yum! They serve it wen onions as green chutney. Mix the green chutney with the chole and it gives takes the chole to just another level. 

Besides their legendary chole bhature my mom and I also love their samosa chaat and the fresh juice they make. Unlike other roadside joints the juice here is not just water. 

The staffs are very quick and extremely warm. 
Whenever I'm at new market it is mandatory to have their chole bhature .. Either sitting their or take it home!
