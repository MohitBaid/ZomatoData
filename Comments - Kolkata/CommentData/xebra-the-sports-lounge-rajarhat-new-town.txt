It's nice to have a bar at office campus but the experience is not so good. 
Beer served was not chilled. Staffs are very casual in their approach. 
All starters are pathetic only dry chilli chicken is somehow edible. 
Ambience is also very average.

A decent sized lounge located at ecospace business park. It's basically a part of the Eco vista club.

Location: It's at New town block D near Unitech building and adjacent to Aliah University. Though the location might be a constraint but that is manageable.

Ambiance & Decor:
I really liked the decor and interiors here. The red sofas gives it a very classy look along with mirrors set up along side. 
The bar counter is a bit small but that's in a good as it has left plenty of place for other activities. 
I liked the fact that they have kept a pool table for the customers which can be used while you enjoy your drink and food.

Food :
Food is very ordinary. I tried some of the  Chinese and Indian starters which is just about ok.
The mocktails were very refreshing though.
I would ask them to work on the presentation part.

Service: 
Service is decent but a bit slow may be that becoz this place stays empty or less crowded most of the time.
There is a room for lot of improvement and they have the resources to pull quality customers as well.

The lounge is in my office premises. Quite good ambience they have pool in the house. Food and drinks quality is good price is a bit high. But you can enjoy any kind of sports while having the food and drinks.

This Lounge is in my office courtyard. Though I have visited only twice here, once with a friend and another for a team party.
My experience:
There are two pool tables. It is a paid play here.
There is a DJ section right above the bar counter. Plays nice tracks.
The seats are comfortable. Quite a lounge set.
The drinks are expensive here. Also the variety is quite less. I never got a Budweiser Magnum here.
The food you order here, will make your bill rise high where your tummy still yearns for more, for the money you pay.
I would have rated this place bit more but for the couteousness of the staff.
