The ambience of the restaurant is bright and cheerful. The seating area is large and well organised. The seafood items are particularly very good here. The golden fried prawns are highly recommended. In chicken, the kung pao chicken and crispy chicken are delicious. The chilly garlic fish is worth a try. Overall, too good! Kudos to the entire team.

Beijing Tangra entices you with a visit on a common myth that the best chinese food in calcutta is at China town and Beijing is the best place to be. The history of Beijing and more so its owner Monica Lu is well documented and this also would push you to a visit. The food, ambiance and the service is very average. The bar menu and service is pathetic. I am afraid that I did not find any original chinese taste nor flavor in the food. A bowl of green chutney on the table completes the chinese food experience. There is no doubt that the quality and quantity is generous but the food is quite what you would get in the multitudes of chinese places in Kolkatta. Not worth the effort to go to a noisy place with average taste. Avoidable history.

Well firstly to start with, I've been a regular at this place for some years now. It's like I've been visiting this place since my birth! 
This restaurant is known to serve the city's best of the best Chinese . Located in the chinese locality of Calcutta, Tangra.
As a frequent visitor my staples are-
Hot and sour / Thai soup. Chicken drums of heaven/Golden fried prawn for starters. 
I absolutely love the gravy noodles they serve here with red hot chilli fish and the same old fried rice chilli chicken combo is a must have. 
Also the Chicken Chopsuey is not bad either. 
Choco brownie for dessert is hands down my favourite. 
But on a recent visit to this place for a weekday lunch,
I surprisingly find that the quality and taste of the food has deteriorated by leaps.
It's disappointing because of the expectations. 
Well, choco brownie remains perfect though. 
Also, I am a huge of the green chilli sauce that they provide here. 
P.S: still my fav and go to place for chinese!

When it comes to authentic Chinese food, Beijing is my family's first choice. I have been there multiple times previously, but this is my first visit as an adult. 
I had ordered Crispy fish fry, chicken hakka noodles, chilli garlic chicken, crackers and chicken mushroom soup. The Bhetki in fish fry was well cooked and the other dishes was also excellent. The service was prompt and the price is just reasonable. Thank you Beijing, my time and money was well-spent.

Located in the most famous China town in Tangra/Topsia  region. Extremely spacious restaurant & ambience is soothing. Staffs are quite courtacoeus. We ordered chicken mashroom  clear soup as starter. It was excellent 2 begin with. Then we ordered mixed hakka chow & chicken sanghai as our main course. Amount was quite enough for two. Chicken was very tasty but not at all spicy. They served within 5 min. So highly recommended  for Chinese cuisines in kolkata.

The first experience - Valet parking is provided. The place is pretty big and the prices are not too exorbitant. The food is pretty good and you can really have some family time here. With soups starters noodles and a main course you can wrap up in 500 a head if you're more than 4 people.

A authentic Chinese food destination with reasonable price. The place is quite big to accommodate many people, serves you many variations of Chinese foods. We ordered chicken mashroom soup, mixed meifoon, mixed fried rice, hot garlic chicken, peking chicken, hakka noodles, garlic prawn and lime soda. Quantity was more than enough for us. Soup was not that good. We found nothing special in fried rice that was quite simple. But the meifoon(rice noodles) was so good as well as the hot garlic chicken. Prawn size was big enough to make us happy. Peking chicken was also tastes average. Over all it js a good place to hangout.

LOCATION: It is situated in a dingy alley in Chinatown. Valet parking is available.
AMBIENCE: It is well lit but doesn't have much of an ambience. 
SERVICE: It is disarmingly slow.
MENU: Covers all chindian food.
FOOD: The chicken dumplings were served fresh & hot & was gulped down fast. The Beijing fried rice was okayish & so was the hot garlick fried chicken.

I visited China town couple of time previously, but today's experience in Beijing is the worst, u cant even compare the service with other renowned restaurants of Kolkata... the food quality was too bad to be ...we ordered Mushroom dry pepper(the name something like that), Prawn Chow, Egg Fried Rice, Thai chicken.We have to wait for around 25 mins for the food and the starter and the main course came at the same time.All the food was oily and we were joking whether the oil price had gone down.The waiter was not available and every time we were looking for someone ... after finishing the food we again order a different kind of mushroom item with drinks and it came after 45 mins and 3 reminders.The customer service was too poor to be.To me, Bigboss or Kim Ling is far better in the customer service and food quality.I don't know how a heritage kind of restaurant offers u such bad service. 
P.S¬† I don't booze, but my friends were complaining that the other restaurants serve alcohol with some complimentary snacks or nuts ... whereas in Beijing it wasn't there.

We ordered a Mixed Noodle, Mixed Fried Rice, Prawn Meat Balls, Beijing Special Chilli Chicken and Sweet & Sour Prawns. Apart from the Prawn balls, which were a bit dry, but tasted delicious, the other items lived upto my expectations. 

Loved the food, Would recommend it to those who are yet to discover this place.

Food overall : The food is average, feel like people come here to drink with that they dont even serve chakna.
Serving : 2/10 Worst thing had to wait for food even when it was not crowded.
Atmoshpere : 4/10 nothing special.
One time visit is more than okay.

all the restaurants in tangra kolkata CHina town was once at the Apex of Chinese delicacies in kolkata but now with so many restro s, cafes and fine dinning serving extra ordinary to good Chinese food, tangra restaurants especially BEIJING has lost it's rank ..

NO doubt Beijing gives u the old China town feel and brings back so many childhood memories but the food is very very ordinary ,extremely average.. üòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüòîüôÅ
menu is vast, serving at least 10 + varieties of just chowmein and rice, but tastes very average..
food and alcohol prices are competitive,
quantity is good
quality and taste are very average üòî
ambiance is classic China town
cleanliness and service is just fine, no complaints

I will definitely visit Beijing for the old China town charm
but not for great Chinese food anymore

I visited Beijing after a long time. I had good memories of the food earlier.
But I was utterly disappointed to see the quality of food. The Chicken Sweet Corn soup was thin and contained lot of water. Taste was also not good.
The gravy Chicken Chowmein had water flowing out. In fact it should be called Soup Chowmein. 
The Prawn Fried rice was full of Soya sauce and tastes horrible. The prawns were frozen ones and smelling.
The Chilli Chicken had only onions and chillies. No capsicum/bell pepper. 
Inspite of such quality, the prices of the items were high.
Bhai Phonta Lunch totally wasted.
I would not suggest Beijing to anybody.

I am fond of Chinese in Chinatown. I will surely say that Beijing is much better than Kim ling and Golden joy. I ordered chili garlic pepper fry as starter. And must say one thing that they serve original bhetki than the basa fish (as per my taste buds). Very few restaurants provide this quality fish. In main course I ordered mix haka noodles, it's awesome, the prawns are soft as well as fresh and flavourful. But in side dish chiken sanghai was a little stiff though tasty. 

Overall Beijing is so far the best restaurant in Chinatown.

Staffs are friendly and professional 
Decor is pretty good.
Washroom is enough clean.

My thumbs up for Beijing.

This restaurant is passable at best. The service took such a long time. Time taken between the appetizers and the main course was almost an hour and and when we had asked to bring the bill it took almost 45 minutes. Half the items on the menu that we had asked were not available like the spring roll,crispy fish, Duran noodles with ice cream etc. Its only saving grace was the the dessert chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. The brownie was not too sweet and was moist and went well with the ice cream.

First floor was closed and the seating arrangement in ground floor is looking like a marriage hall . 
The service was also ordinary and took much time to deliver even normal food like chili chicken . Peeper chicken and mix rice noodles was not bad ,rest prawn fry and everything was nothing to boast of .All in all disappointing experience in one of the premier resturant of Chinatown . Hope it was a one of case ,please improve to recover your old glory .

On panchami night, 7 of us went to this most hyped joint of China town. The ambience is subtle and nice , the sitting area is huge. So we ordered 

Chicken fried rice - The rice was stale with very minimal amount of veggies . 
Manchurian chicken - The gravy was completely bland. 
Garlic chicken - It tasted exactly like the Manchurian chicken , they made the same gravy for all chicken preparations I suppose. 
Chilli garlic rice - Too much of garlic destroyed the taste and we could smell some bad odour from the dish. 
Chicken Hakka noodles - Noodles were far better than the rice , done neatly and tasted good. 
Sanghai fish - This dish could actually make our night a bit better after such disastrous dinner. The fish was very spicy with a tangy flavour and we absolutely loved it. 

We also ordered tuborg strong and Budweiser . The service was prompt but the staffs were very indifferent. Never going to this place again. :(

The most important thing about a restaurant is it's food, ambiance and service.
Ambiance : The place was well decorated and clean.
Food: It was not my first time visiting this place and the food standard has been maintained and was satisfactory.
Service : This is reason for which the restaurant got it's low rating. I was with my family and as we entered the restaurant no one attended us and later they could not make up their mind in which table to place us in, asking us to go to this table once and that table once. The indecisiveness of the waiters was overlooked by us. But during the meal a number of waiters came by and started chatting leaning on the couch where my father was seated causing him to feel uncomfortable. I would really appreciate it if the service was improved but such casualness was not expected. Picture attached.

Beijing....one of the famed restaurant of the chinatown...is the place we went for lunch!! Firstly the chicken starters are great...dont miss 'em. The quality of food is great and the price is resonable. One can find liquor for drinks as well. However its a place which is good for families as well. The staffs are ok. There is vallet parking...so that you dont have to figure out where to park the car in the congested lane in which the restaurant is loacated. But its a must try for indo-chinese lovers!!

Hi
Had very high expectations regarding the restaurant going by zomato ratings. The pricing is completely arbitrary and undeserving of the brand of chinese food being served there. The quantities are great and must be satisfactory for large groups of famished and tipsy gourmands. Table cruvet set, tomato ketchup (not seen one in any "authentic chinese" restaurant I've been to) et al were of flimsy plastic built and the wait staff's courtesy seemed plastic also. Tried chilli garlic chicken upon their recommendation which was tasty and decidedly forgettable more so if you consider paying
three hundred rupees and a tip üò§. Also my limited knowledge of chinese cuisines tells me the extensive use of pork lard as a cooking base is a given; how can an establishment claiming to serve authentic chinese not serve or even use any pork product? üòï

I have been visiting this restaurant since my childhood days with my family, relatives and close ones. I have real good memories of this place.  Last visit was last night. The chinese here is so tempting that I cannot miss out on it whenever I want to relax. Getting seats do become difficult on holidays and weekeends. It serves alcohol too. I can't get enough of their fish and chicken preparations whether that's pepper fried fish in chilli/chilli garlic or Beijing special chilli chicken. Soups like the prawn/chicken wanton soup is my all time favourite. One shall definitely try their fried chilli baby corn and their cantonese noodles. They have an elaborate menu. They serve duck , prawns and mutton preparations. The quantity of the food served is extremely good. They have their portions of half plates and full plates when it comes to their side dishes. So, if you are in Kolkata and China Town is in the list to make visits, do sneak inside Beijing for a sumptuous meal.

Had been there recently when in Kolkata. The food and service was good. However it was a bit more oily. Golden fried Prawns were good. Other food of chicken were also good but more oily. However the service was good and fast.

I came here yesterday. The place is quite good. We ordered chicken & mushroom soup,chrispy baby corn for starter and for the main course we choose kung kao chicken and egg fried rice with sweet and sour lime soda. It's took almost 30 munits to deliver. The soup is nice tangi flavour with small qubes of chicken and mushrooms. And the baby corn are average. 
Then come to the egg fried rice, it's so light and full of flavour of vegetables and egg. The kung pao chicken is full of kaju nuts and it's give the dish a nice  crunch . But the quantity is quite small. 
Over all the experience is nice. :)

Heard the good review about this restaurant and I traveled more then 1 hr to reach here but I have made the mistake as I am really pissed off right now yes rite now because I'm writing this while having grenade looking type of fried chicken which has floor inside the chicken and they don't have a chicken dumpling and their excuses are hilarious..
And they have room full of manager but their knowledge about the cusine is big zero...watever i asked about the food..their only answer is chilli peppers or chilli garlic...
God bless me...I'm leaving right now...

*This Indianised Chinese restaurant is known to me since childhood. It used to be the place for family get together.

*One of the best restaurant in kolkata.Food is good. I like their green sauce a lot.

*The only con are the waiters and manager over there.They don't bother to take orders. Yesterday I waited for half an hour(yes half an hour), until I had to get up and tell them to take orders.
Cutting 0.5 for service .
I have tasted basically everything on their menu as I am the frequent visitor.

*Best foods :
Wonton soup.
Mixed hakka chow

Had heard a lot about this place and paid a visit last month... But was not very satisfied with the food.. We ordered drums of heaven which turned out to be just deep fried dry drumsticks instead of tossed in sauce.. And then we had ordered mixed noodles and garlic fish and a chicken item.. They all tasted the same n bland.. The bathroom tiles on the walls look quite tacky.. They should wrk on the decor too.. Those washroom type tiles on the wall look terribly tacky...

The food was good.
But the price is little higher compared to other restaurants in the locality. Moreover, most of the foods were not available. To my surprise they clearly said that no mocktails & ice cream were there & even some hard drinks too were unavailable. I don't know for what they kept the restaurant opened.

After quite some time it was time again for a family dinner and by that I mean me and my parents. We decided to go to Tangra and checked into the renowned Beijing restaurant. Well the first choice was definitely Big Boss, a place which I really like but it being overcrowded we had to find an alternative and I'm extremely sorry to say I regret having done that. The service was really not up to the mark. Very disappointing rather. A huge group had come to have dinner and all they did was shout like hooligans and play music at a very loud volume. Yes,they had got their own speaker. We on the table right beside were getting very disturbed and inspite of us complaining twice , they hardly did anything to get things under control. It's not the first time I came here but surely this was the last. The food was okay but not what they usually serve quality wise. Overall it was a very disappointing experience for me. I hope this review rings some bells.

Over the years, Beijing has undoubtedly lost its charm to a great extent. It continues to be a busy, rather a bit too noisy restaurant which may not do good to its ambience. The food is disappointingly average. You'd expect some exotic Chinese flavours, but instead you get an Indian imitation of Chinese food. Quality of service has dropped considerably. It's decent to hang around for food and drinks with friends, but if you're a foodie looking for authentic Chinese, you might want to prefer Beijing in China over this one.

Went there with my on a sunday night for some booze along with chinese food. 
The booze is pretty expensive as they serve only in pegs whereas in many places you can order the full bottle. 
Coming to the food , ordered mixed chowmein both gravy and hakka, peking chicken , schezwan chicken. 
The side dishes were okayish but the hakka chowmein sucked and sucked bad. 
Would definitely choose other restaurants at China town from the next time and also the staffs weren't that cordial either.

The first thing I'd say about this place is please make a reservation if you want to visit. Even though the restaurant is very spacious, it is always crowded. The interiors are nicely done, although you'll not focus on that coz the food is SO GOOD.
We ordered Chicken dumplings, Crispy fried Wontons, Lung Fung soup, Garlic chicken, Shanghai Fish, Mixed fried rice and Noodles. Chicken Dumpling is the must have dish. Each dumpling was huge and delicious. I think 12-14 were served in one plate and we just couldn't have enough of it!
The Lung Fung soup was tasty but was actually pretty heavy for a soup, in my opinion. The Wontons were disappointing.
The main course dishes lived up to our expectations. Both the noodles and rice was amazing, and so were the side dishes. The pocket pinch is also reasonable, given the quality and quantity of the food.
The thing you need to keep in mind while ordering is that they serve huge portions. So order wisely.
And never forget to order dumplings. üòÅ

Tangra is mini China in Kolkata. Beijing one of its centres. Ever want an authentic Cantonese dish this is the place. Sichuan dishes are good but Cantonese much better. Duck and Crab dishes are good. A let down in interior but makes up for the food.

Worth the 30 minutes wait!

I've never waited for a restaurant table for 30 minutes. But trust me this place was worth the wait. 
As above we waited for 30 minutes and as soon as we got the table our starters were ordered within 15 seconds. Yes I was so hungry we were keeping track of time. 
The starters came back for the second round (It was yum)
The main course was a bit oily but you can't expect more from this place. Full on Indian Chinese. The portions are huge. 
The place has got this really chill and lively vibe. We had a really good time just being ourselves.
We ordered a lot (4 starters, 2 noodles and 3 mains) and the bill said it :P

Long before the days of Zomato and social media buzz, China Town had earned a very special place in the hearts of the food loving Bengali. We had Chinese settlement in a few places in the city and Tangra is one of them where these Chinese owned or worked in the tanneries. Later, they shifted to the restaurant and hotel business and an entire food district developed in this part of the city. Beijing was one of the stars in that district. My childhood had been filled with visits to Beijing and other restros here almost every weekend.
In fact, Beijing become so very favourite of our family that we didn't usually go to other places except here. Nothing new to say about the delicious Chinese they serve that'll make u come back time n again. Meifoon and Chicken Drumsticks are my favourite. There are  lots of other good stuff as well on their menu. I'll not write any further except that those who are new to the city and haven't been to Tangra, make a dash immediately because u r missing out on Kolkata's one of the major food legacies.

My first visit at China Town was almost 7years ago.It was a busy afternoon,without any Suggestions,we landed up at Beijing.
The fleet of waiters was huge.Nice and Cozy Ambience.Well greeted by the security guard and the captain.
I clearly remember what i ordered.
Golden fried Prawn,Prawn chips,Crispy fried chicken,Mixed Meifoon and Mongolian chicken.
That day was a memorable one for us.It was amazing.
But the next visit dissappointed us.Service was so so poor.
From the first visit,the place did not seemed economical.But theire PREMIUM service was what balanced everything.
Feels sad.

Supposed to be the best restaurant in China Town,the waiters think this tag gives them the right to be high handed and snobbish...the food is good no doubt,but not significantly better than big boss next to it...pricing is a bit expensive,doesnt justify the quality of the food,and there might be some problems finding a parking spot...overall a good Chinese restaurant with decent food,but not good enough to justify the fine dining attitude adopted by its staff

Food - When craving for some Chinese food, this is one of my favourite destination. Excellent food served in both quality and quantity and obviously the taste is unforgettable. My personal favourites here are the golden fried prawn, chilli garlic pepper chicken, honey chicken, lemon fish and gravy noodles. This restaurant serves the best honey chicken in the city!

Ambience - Good ambience to visit with family and friends. 

Service - Attendants are good. Food arrives a bit late.

Rates - Appropriate rates with quality and quantity.

As I have already told that Chinatown is the bestest place to taste the chinese delicacies in Kolkata Beijing is the key restuarant there with lots of varieties in food items. Waiters are good and there's nothing to mention about the taste, it's awesome and the ambience is also great with large space decorated by chinese lanterns.

Costly.. quality is good but quantity can be improved. Can be considered as fine dine. So overall experience is okay. If you're going out with family, Beijing can be considered but to hangout with friends or if you're looking for a pocket friendly place, there are places other than Beijing.

Right in the middle of China town, this place is warm and big. Cozy ambiance and an elicit menu to choose from, you will get a lot of items. For some reason, I didn't find the flavours to be exotic or out of the world. All in all, it serves great portions and tasty food at the best prices, though a bit tricky to reach. But hey, China town is a must one time visit for the years it has seen.

Visited there a fine afternoon with my friends. I've always loved this place. This place will never disappoint you. The food is always satisfying. The plus point about this place is the food is not very rich. It's light so you won't feel full after eating. 
Ordered shanghai fish for starters. It was different. Liked it. Then for main course we ordered noodles, fried rice and pepper chicken. Everything satisfying except the fact that I lost a 500 rupee note there.

The Ambience is very basic. Doesn't stand out much. Just as a banquet with dinner served, the place is loud, not preferable if one wants a quite meal with your accompanients. 
Now coming to the staff, they are the type who don't give a damn. The person who is serving you will only serve you if you ask another waiter for something no reply from then otherwise they don't even listen.
The alcohol price are also higher here compared to other places in Tangra 
Now coming on the food 
Chicken hot and sour soup-Soup is very basic too, very sour infact. The orange colour gives it a strange look.
Fish finger-half a plate of fish fingers, 6 pieces in number of small in size, though it was very crispy but it had less stuffing in it, had more maida than fish.
Veg Hakka noodle-Next was a Hakka noodle veg which was nice had a decent amount of vegetables 
Veg fried rice-same as the noodle it was verry basic just vegetables and rice with less seasoning 
Chilli chicken-which had decent amount of chicken pieces which were proper chicken pieces and not pakora 
both we're verry basic in taste but good
All in all I ate food but didn't enjoyed

Mixed fried rice .
The other dishes i usually try here are  Spring chicken,  Chilli garlic fish,  Chicken rice noodles,  Schezuwan chicken.
This place is a must visit for Chinese lovers.

If u a chineese food lover n ur taste buds craves for varieties of soup, this is the ultimate heaven for u. I would recomend u to jst surf the backdrop of this joint a little before u pay the visit. It will add more thrill n satisfection. Chiken asperagus soup, thai soup deserv mentioning. Others include golden fried prawn, crispy fish among starters. Their mixed fried rice are exceptionaly excellent but the chiken items stand as similar as any other chineese dish of any reputed restru. Ambiance is good, table booking recommended if u want to join after 7pm. Plz pay attention to the giagantic fish swiming while u are there :)

Helpful staff, welcomed me with a good parking spot, which can be a PITA elsewhere! 
Well lit, Cosy and comfortable seating.
We ordered the Thai chicken soup which was too heavy for me and had unevenly diced mushrooms which were rubbery and did not go well altogether with the other ingredients. 
The drums of heaven had 12 drumsticks and was juicy and succulent at the same time crunchy outside. Well fried indeed but I love my drums of heaven with some sauces and gravy.
Beijing special fried rice had generous chunks of meat and was well seasoned(no pork). 
The green pepper prawn was good but I felt it was a bit overpriced. But I would say go for it!

I had to face a huge waiting time between starter and mains ( 30 mins, unacceptable to most) which left a bad aftertaste but I was too tired to complain.

Ambience is good but service is aweful. It was a Sunday dinner plan and wanted to have good Chinese food. One person in the front showed us the table which wasn't cleaned at that time after their previous guest left but still they wanted us to stand beside the table. It took about 15-20 minutes to ready the table. We ordered chilli chicken, pepper chicken, chicken drumsticks & mixed hakka noodles. Pepper chicken & noodles were OK sort of but it was the worst chilli chicken I ever had. Though the drumstick was lip-smacking as it was crispy in the outside and very soft in the inside. Overall their quality is getting down & down.

One of the best restraunts in Tangra area, the interiors are well made up with floral pieces. The Air-conditioning is nicely regulated and comfortable.

Coming to the service it seems to be slightly regimented as none of the service personal smile , though service is not at all slow, and they do serve guests platter to plate when ever required.

Coming to the food, ordered for Drums of heaven which was served with Tomato Ketchup and Sweet Chilli sauce. It was crisp from out side and soft inside.Portion size is of 12 pieces.

In main course, Sichuwan Chicken was my choice with Beijing Special Fried Rice. Sichuwan Chicken was spicy and slightly sour in taste with 12 pieces of succulent pieces of chicken  which were nicely braised in the gravy. 
Beijing Special Fried Rice had chicken, scrambled eggs, pork, shrimps , mushroom and veggies.The rice preparation went quiet well with the choice of main course.
Portion sizes are adequate for three adults and yes the prices are on the higher side.VAT and Service Tax is extra on the menu rates .They have an elaborate menu for alcohol also, but Breezer was the choice in my case. Over all a nice experience with some very nice food.

I have visited this place 4-5 times in a span of 7 to 8 year, every time I have realised that the food quality and taste has gone down a bit. This time whatever we order was mostly tasteless and bland. Probably this is the last time I am visiting here. This is only running and thronged because of its earlier name and glory and not for the current quality and taste. The service also is poor.

It was a Sunday dine out with family. The place got packed up by 8.30pm. Service is slow, food is costly and is really not value for money. Tried chicken spring roll, chicken wanton, chilli prawn, prawn wafers, mixed fried rice along with hot garlic chicken. Wantons were good and the rice was also nice but nothing else was tasty. Will opt for other options in china town the next time I visit.

A nice place. One should go and book a seat before 7 since it starts getting crowded after that. The quantity of the food is very good. The taste is fine. Ambience good, too.

Had a pretty good experience the other day.. okay, so I hadn't ever been to the popular China Town of Kolkata before, so I was really excited to explore the place. Initially, I was tossing between Big Boss and Beijing, then finally came here. The staffs are decent. And the food, quantity wise is massive. We were thinking to order a soup for two, then the staff said half serving would be enough for two. I was hesitating a bit, but then ordered for the half servings. And, as he said, it was enough. Then ordered some cocktails along with a beijing speacial fried rice and schezwan chicken. Again ordered half a plate of chickn as they told us it would be sufficient (he told that it contained 6 pieces), but I think there were more than 6 pieces. Quality wise it was pretty decent, I won't say it was the best I ever had, but okayish for me and it's cheap (according to the quantity they provide). The ambience was also nice. Though I didn't like the cocktails that much. But overall I was satisfied with the whole experience.

The authentic indo-chinese cuisine. We love to have meal here. We just love the chinese cuisine. We had been here several times.
The best dishes are the momo, the spring roll - it is giant spring roll (I never had so giant spring roll), the shanghai chicken, the homemade fried noodle and the wonton soup. 
The service is moderate.

The main reason for rating this place as 1.0 is because of the service as the waiters and staff didn't paid attention and were busy with there own things and even after the payment we were asked to pay a tip and that was really ridiculous despite of having such good foods the staffs in this restaurant are ruining it's standard. Happily I won't visit this place again since for me service holds equal value.
Nevertheless please find my review for the food below.
The place is located in tangra, which is known as China Town in Kolkata. Pretty well maintained place.
We ordered soup along with chilli chicken (dry). The manchow soup was really great but the dry chilly chicken lacked salt. 
For the main course we mixed fried rice and garlic chicken. Really well made and directly attacking the taste buds.

Went to have some good Cantonese cuisine. But the food they served didn't appeal my palate. Ordered Thai Soup (Chicken), Mixed Rice Noodles & Garlic n Ginger Fish. Out of these, only the soup is worth mentioning, other items were bland. Service is quick but literally lacks soul. The order takers can start off by smiling at least. Eventually one of the waiters asked me directly why I didn't tip him & he asked for explanation! This was the second & last time I visited the capital of China here in Kolkata. Recommendation: NO

While the decor and ambience is great n cozy, service was quick n food was good as well. Ordered mixed fried rice and thai chicken gravy. Mixed fried rice had veggies with lots of chicken,egg,prawn while thai chicken tasted tangy n wasnt that spicy as per menu. Only issue is that menu states that food contains msg. In times when everyone is food n health conscious, a menu endorsing msg may not go doen that well. I noticed after ordering food n may not go bcak again.

Service depends on the waiters.Someday its good someday its not.Taste of Food is very good over here.Location is a bit remote.Actually the whole tangra region is like that.Cost is a bit high than the other restaurants in tangra,but the taste is also good.
A perfect place for reunions,friendly meets or family dinners.Very sober and sophisticated.

There was a time when Chinese food meant Tangra...and Tangra was synonymous with Chinese food. Tangra was one part of the town which we use to frequent and there was not one restaurant here, that we had not tried. Today, our visits to Tangra may have gone down but the "Tangra type Chinese food" still does occupy a special place in our hearts. Beijing is one of the better places here. The ambience is very good....seating arrangements are comfortable, the area is spacious with lots of tables, the decor is top class. The food.....as usual..."lip smackingly", "finger lickingly" good. The Crispy Fried Wantons and the Golden fried Prawns are beyond compare. I can bet that nowhere else in Kolkata will you find the above mentioned items in the manner that they are prepared here. The Hakka Chowmein, Chilli Chicken and the Green Pepper Chicken,as usual were of the highest standards, the typical 'Tangra' standards. But I was a wee bit disappointed with the Fried Rice. This particular preparation seems to have taken a plunge compared to the one they used to serve in the yesteryears.
All in all, still a great place to visit with family and friends for your Sunday lunch or a weekend dinner.

This is a good restaurant at China town. In starter... Sichuan duck goes well with a peg of scotch.... 

But fried rice... chilly chicken... garlic chicken etc.. All these contemporary dishes are Indianised like any other kolkata restro... So nothing special about it. In fact I personally doesn't like chinese main course dishes. 

Its a spacious restro, ambiance was good. Serving time was also quite fast. But seating arrangements (which we were offered) could be a bit more comfortable. 

Pocket-wise it is a fairly priced place.

Beijing and China Town have almost become synonymous of each other. It is one of the most popular restaurants in Topsia and very rightly so. That almost everything they have in their menu is excruciatingly mouth watering, still, a special mention to their prawn chips, golden fried prawn and their honey lemon chicken. Good Lord, I am drooling already. So if you are in China Town and if you haven't been to Beijing, you are missing out on something delicious- literally n metaphorically.

Heard about this place...read about the reviews- one of the highly recommended place for kolkata Chinese!!! 
I started to slurp over this thought!!!
For sheer excitement of giving my taste buds a treat I landed here with my family!
30 mins waiting time persuaded me towards expectation of good food! 
Nevertheless we plonked with the menu and ordered to get out of starvation!
1) sweet corn chicken soup- no salt..less flavour....boring!
2) chicken chilli dry- not at all spicy! Taste buds were just dormant!
3) chicken fried rice- dish I haven't identified yet!
 Some veggies n rice!
4) rice noodles- strands of noodles, some chicken, 
5) Shangai chicken- weird combination of flavours...tops the chart of being useless dish!
6) washroom- utter disgrace and smelly!

All my lip smacking dream went down the drain...money paid was utterly wasted!
Wanted to rate 0 but being kind and obligations towards humanity gave 1!

This is an very old famous chinese restaurent. I visited this place often when i was young and now recently i got a chance to pay a visit on my uncle and aunt's anniversary . They did not work much on the ambience though but the food quality is maintained . Coming to the food we ordered pepper chicken and fish fry as starters. I loved the pepper chicken and its highly recommended. Fish was good too. We also ordered thai shoup with mashroom and i really liked it. Coming to the main course we ordered mixed fried ruce, hakka veg noodle, and Cantonese chicken noodle. All three was tasted in small amounts. Cantonese was my fav among the three. For side dish we ordered garlic chicken and it was good too. I overall liked the food and it is one of my favourite chinese restaurant.

Never had food so bad in a restaurant of this stature. Chef doesn't even know how to make an egg drop and it looked like an omelette in sweet corn soup. Lung Fung soup had some egg white froth on top and what was underneath didn't taste much different. Sweet and sour chicken with pineapple and American chopsuey tasted just about decent. So was fried rice. Dry honey chicken tasted like it was made with burnt molasses; I don't think a bee ever touched that. Cantonese chowmein didn't taste much like anything but eggs. But lemon fish took the cake. Horrid little pieces of a lowly river carp, filleted so badly it still had skin, cooked dry inside. I'm used to a nice flaky basa or bhetki. This was not expected here. Finally ended up filling up with prawn chips and pineapple blossom, which have earned most of the points I have grudgingly given. I am certainly not coming back. The ambiance is rowdy, service is not prompt and I miserably fail to see the charm of this place.

Went there last year with a friend. The place is neat and the ambience, soothing. The waiters are well informed about the menu; service is pretty great, though slow. The beer appears too fast and have to wait a long time for the starters. So that's a downside.
Coming to the food, it really is good. We'd ordered a couple of beers, a half Kung Pao Chicken, a Mixed Noodles and a Chicken Manchurian. The quantity is sufficient for two and the quality is decent. But the price appeared a bit high compared to what they had to offer; we'd to shell out 1.4k for it. So, good for a one time visit.

I should actually curse this place. It is because of Beijing, I didn't get the chance to try out other restaurants at the Kolkata Chiney Para. Earlier we used to visit another restaurant Evergreen. But later we shifted here and since then, it has become a constant in our lives. 
We have tried almost anything and everything from here. May upload the pictures when I visit this place next time. Now, I shall tell you what you must order next time when you're here -
Golden Fried Prawns
Crispy Chilli Babycorn
Crispy Mushroom
Lemon Fish
Lemon Chicken
Honey Chicken (YOU SHOULD ORDER THIS!!! IT'S MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE. EVERYTIME I COME HERE, I HOG ONE WHOLE PLATE AND GET BACK ONE PLATE FOR HOME!)
Mixed Rice Noodles
Try these dishes and trust me you will be really eager to thank me personally! Happy Dining! :)

Heard a lot about this place as the most authentic Chinese restaurant in kolkata, but to my surprise this place was a total mess.
Checked in few couples of month ago on some special occasion and I must say this decision turned out to be disaster.
We order one Mixed Fried Rice and one Prawn Fried Rice along with Fish Manchurian and Chilly Chicken; then after a decade they finally turned up with our order which was not even hot neither well served; now the crunch point is all they brought was 2 Mixed fried rice along with Chicken Manchurian and Chilly Chicken instead of the those which we ordered.

Hence totally horrible experience.¬†
Even their staff was so busy taking in customers that they were least bother of what the existing ones are facing.

Thumps Down.

Situated in China Town this place is a great option for all Chinese food lovers. The ambiance was nothing special but the food was amazing. Had visited this place with my cousins and we enjoyed alot. The service was quite fast and the quantity is sure to impress anyone. 
We had ordered :
# Drums of Heaven: Crispy outside Tender and juicy inside a perfectly enjoyable starter accompanied with Sweet Chilly sauce. 
# Beijing Spcl. Chilly Chicken: Very different version of the normal chilly chicken. The flavour was different and I loved it. Must try at this place.
#Sichuan Fish: Quite similar to the preparation of the chilly chicken. The fish was very tender and the dish was delicious.
#Shanghai Chicken: Crispy chicken tossed in a hot and sweet sauce. 
I loved all the dishes served to us. An ideal place to visit with a family or friends.

Beijing restaurant  is located at Topsia , which serves Chinese delicacies.

Ambience is fine. service is bit slow , staffs are nice too. This place is always crowdy due to its popularity.

Tried chicken manchow soup, Chicken Hakka chow and chilli garlic chicken . Soup was tangy, tasty with good fillings. Chow was tasty and well cooked with ample fillings. Chilli garlic chicken was very tasty and tingling.

Pocket pinch is bit high but foods were superb.

Overall a satisfactory place to dine in Chinese cuisine.

I have visited Beijing Restaurant many times. It is located in China Town called Tangra very close to Topsia Crossing in Kolkata city.
The food and presentation is good, especially Chicken 65, Chili Chicken, Prawn Chips and of-course noodles.
It is always very crowded during lunch and dinner time, so hard to get a seat, so you might have to wait 5 or 10 minutes to get through.
The customer service is good, and their behavior is also not bad, but yes since the restaurant is packed up all the time, they are little busy.
It is little expensive compared to other Chinese restaurants located nearby in Tangra, but worth trying it.

Starters were good. Main course nothing special. Pricewise expensive...

But this low rating is just due to their sheer customer negligence and unwelcoming attitude. They take customers for granted and behave in a way that they are doing some kind of favour even when they are charging for it!! 

I went at 3pm for lunch and there was queue. There were no less than 20 staff roaming around but seemed very busy! When I asked where to register my name for waiting, one person sent me to reception and the reception sent me back to him! Again without even attending me, he reluctantly redirected me to someone else and when I was again sent back, he told : "Oh, sorry! Actually no one is registering any name"!!! What kind of welcome is this?? Is it a dirty joke or what? 

Even after this I kept patience but after we had a seat and placed orders, realised what mistake we had made! Again so many staff roaming around but not paying any heed if you call them. Five staff are flocking in front of one table for the same work and posing as "busy"! If you get a plate, you are lucky; don't expect a spoon until you shout at them the fifth time! Call them for an order and they are vanished! What a mess!!

Wanted to talk to the manager there itself but I was told by the waiter that he doesn't sit there! Hope ur resto really wants to serve people with delicious chinese food packed with a smily face. That's the intent for opening such a restaurant, right?? My experience says ur unprofessional staff are more busy in repelling customers than atrracting them!

A BIG NO TO THIS MISBEHAVING RESTAURANT. NEVER GONNA VISIT AGAIN AND I WILL MAKE SURE TO CIRCULATE THIS EXPERIENCE TO AS MANY FOODIES AS I CAN SO THAT THEY DON'T SPOIL THEIR MOOD BY COMING HERE!

An old, much loved classic with its quality mostly intact. Chilly baby corn, spring rolls, veg haka chow, tom yum soup, everything was satisfying. The service is surprisingly attentive. A useful tip is to stick with the steward's recommendations. Anything we ordered was vetoed by him with the helpful suggestion of a better, fresher dish :) Hence, unfortunately, I cannot recommend a whole lot of dishes on my own. On the upside, he wasn't wrong! Not a bad meal at all!

Beijing is one of the oldest & popular restaurants of China-Town area..
Heard a lot of it but never tried before, finally this Christmas day we'd been here..
but our experience is not so good..
that might be for the over crowded occasional day.. but I can share what we feel..

Service was not so nice.. not even attended properly...

Decor in the ground floor was good, but in the 1st Floor (Family Section) is like any Hall / Banquet..
Not like any professional restaurant...

Food was not good.. those tastes like any ordinary restaurant...

overall we're disappointed with this place..

Best Tangra style chinese food in town, perhaps. Service was excellent. Ambiance was quite OK. Best of all met Monica Liu, the owner of Beijing, and known as the (Food) Don of Tangra!

We  were visiting Kolkata over the Christmas holidays, and knew that Beijing was going to be on our hit list for Kolkata chinese food. In Dubai, where we‚Äôre from, you can literally order ‚ÄòTangra style‚Äô at a few select chinese restaurants where they have chefs imported from Kolkata, and you have an inside track. But this was Tangra. The real Tangra. And Beijing had the winning corner on Tangra style Chinese food, all right.

Monica Liu, the legend owner of the restaurant (and four others) came and sat with us and had a long chat with us ‚Äì which was quite the dessert after we had a pretty awesome lunch. She had started off small (learnt the art from her mother way back when) and shared that her winning food recipes were really created to please her husband‚Äôs demand for the perfect chinese at home. Beijing‚Äôs food sets out to be Cantonese or mainland, but does have a lot of southern china influence (Sichuan and Hunan). And of course, the twist and turns one would expect to please the local palate. Hong Kong cantonese it isn‚Äôt, but when in Rome, we do as the Romans would. Right?

We were five, and seated rather cozily at a table for six. It wasn‚Äôt crowded, being early-ish on a Friday afternoon (the day before Christmas eve). Service was very helpful, very attentive, keen to please, ready too explain and recommend dishes, and of course help with serving the portions all round. Overall, the experience was quite pleasing.

We started with a large Crab Thai Soup which we shared ‚Äì and it was a decent soup bowl serving for each of us. The soup was tangy, and more like a thick noodle soup than a tom yum, but it did certainly tasted very much Thai. We didn‚Äôt want to stuff ourselves before the mains, so ordered just one dish - the Chicken Dumpling which was basically half a dozen large chicken wontons done to perfection. The dumplings had generous stuffing and the outside was soft and not too doughy.

For mains we had three dishes : Pepper Chicken Chilli Garlic, Vegetable Delight with Button Mushroom and Baby Corn, and the top dish: Peking Phoenix Emperor Prawn.

The Pepper Chicken Chili Garlic was a spicy, garlic dosed pepper chicken that was way more Hunan than Cantonese (meaning, spicy, tangy, garlicky) and would please the local tastebud. The Vegetable Delight was a generous serving of fresh chinese greens with soft baby mushrooms and off-the-farm-fresh succulent baby corn. This was a great vegetable dish to accompany the otherwise overload of non veg dishes. It would be a great dish for our vegetarian friends. We ordered ours spicy, but it wasn‚Äôt over the top spiced, and was just a nice warm dish for a windy, chilly December day in Kolkata.

Our piece de resistance was the Peking Phoenix Emperor Prawn. A tempting, mouth watering presentation of large prawns in a fairly balanced sauce ‚Äì a blend of cantonese simplicity with a touch of southern china burst of flavour. The prawns were done to perfection ‚Äì large, soft pieces that were just so difficult to share. But we did. In the spirit of Christmas giving and all that. This is one of the most expensive dishes on a fairly varied and extensive menu, and it‚Äôs worth every the two new 500 rupee notes and then some.

The food ‚Äì all of it ‚Äì did have MSG. If you have MSG intolerance, ask ahead not to have MSG added to your dishes. Otherwise, most dishes were low on oil and seemed pretty healthy.¬†

Overall, Beijing in Tangra is a delightful food experience. If you really want to get a taste of what most Kolkata folks like by way of chinese this is your place to go. Yes, it‚Äôs a large restaurant. Yes, it‚Äôs not cheap. Yes, parking can get difficult. But, no, you just shouldn‚Äôt miss it. For all the tea in China.

Horrible food of the century !!! The place was a far cry from authenticity !! Very slow in their service....  And nothing warm and welcoming about this place. We ordered only 3 things and I am glad for it... Spring roll takes half n hour to be served, and not worthy of anybody's time... And noodles ... U get them better on the streets of Kolkata...And I have no words left for the veg manchurian...I Believe it was the icing in the cake to bad food...  zero value for your money and time both..   plz go at ur own risk !! And I am not sorry at all for speaking my mind..

One of the best chinese restaurants in Kolkata. Located at China Town, Tangra. Service is very good. This restaurant offers delicious chinese dishes having good quality & quantity at reasonable prices. Ordering Hakka Noodles is better than ordering fried rice. Chilly Garlic Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken & Chicken in Green Pepper are the best side dish options. Must visit for all foodies.

This has always been my go-to place for Chinese food. Today my parents bought Chicken Wantons and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The Wantons are my all-time favourite. They are very crispy and the chicken inside is fresh too. It tastes extremely good with sweet sauce with chili flakes that they usually serve at the restaurant. I like the sauce but they didn't pack it with the Wantons today. Instead they pack green chilli sauce which was extremely spicy but went great with the Wantons no doubt. Sweet and Sour chicken is yummy too. Love the pineapple slices in it.

Beijing is probably the best restaurant in China Town. Always a good place to have great Chinese food at affordable prices.

Thought I'd have lamb in my lunch. But ended up having chicken. I had mixed fried rice and kung pao chicken. It tasted good. They didn't had duck. So my dream of having something other then chicken was shattered. I had a preparation of mushroom and baby corn which was pale and non spicy. I'd say too light. Then had cocktails there. I had a glass of screw driver. Enjoyable food but I'd think twice before I pay another visit

For all the Chinese food lovers in Kolkata, this is the place to be. Tangra is anyway famous for its Chinese food and Beijing is probably one of those places which you can trust one of the best restaurants in this area, overcrowded in the weekends.
Staff behavior is good, food is awesome but it‚Äôs mainly for non-vegetarian as they have wide variety of non-vegetarian foods but still vegetarian will not be disappoint.

Ordered Egg Hakka noodles which was not oily & taste great missed the spark in Veg fried rice which I was excepting from such reputed restaurant but still they make me fall in love with their chilly paneer dish which was little spicy and with flavor of butter paneer were visible and in proper square form and it was served very decently not be missed last the bouncer their green chutney be aware before trying‚Ä¶it has great taste with sweet and chilly flavor but it will make u fire from everywhere‚Ä¶.

But overall I can recommend anyone to visit here. It's more over one of the best in China town. Couldn‚Äôt have dessert as tummy was full as the quantity of all dishes is quite sufficient...

Just you must be sure enough on the expense here, it's a bit expensive...

This is the second time I visited the place. Authentic Chinese tailor-made for Indian palette and I totally loved it. Today I went with family for a great together. We ordered prawn crackers, chilli garlic pepper prawns and chilli chicken dry for starters and mixed noodles and fried rice, Thai chicken and Shanghai prawns as main course. Food came in good quantity, served hot. The bearers were courteous.

Beijing, a highly non recommended place if you want to dine with your family. The ambiance is pathetic and very claustrophobic with people drunk people shouting and creating a mess..coming to the food, it not at all at-par with the other big restaurants in the area and also over priced with lack of any plate presentation. In main course we had ordered a plate of honey chicken which was served burnt and bitter..quite obvious the sugar was over cooked and burned and turned into black jack which was terrible and when we complained to the head waiter he argued that that is how they serve honey chicken here burned. He went on arguing when we requested him to call the manager and said the manager was not available at the moment. Very ill mannered and rude waiters. Never coming to this place again and highly not recommended from my end to others.

Now coming to the food, we had Golden Fried Prawn which was good(The prawns were really big in size). Then we had Duck Schezwan, it was not that good. In the main course we had Egg Rice Noodles and Shanghai Fish, these were not that special.

For me it is a one time go place. Nothing that special.

For all the Chinese food lovers in Kolkata, this is the place to be. Tangra is anyway famous for its food and Beijing is probably one of those places which you can trust blindly. 

Getting a place for a big group could be a challenge on holidays but the wait is definitely worth it. The glasses that they serve tour drink in may disappoint you but the cocktails would not. They would not decorate your drink though.

We've had drums of heaven, fried corn, fried fish, mixed noodles, hing Kong rice and chicken side dish. None of the items disappointed us 

For smoking you would have to go outside on they busy and narrow road in front and smoke. That could be a thing of discomfort for the smokers. But really, great job on the food!

China town is always in the to go list when visiting Kolkata. This place is an old Chinese community in Kolkata. Beijing is one of the best restaurants in this area. Other restaurants should learn the service from these people. They serve the food withing 15 minutes of the order. The quality of food is very nice, so is the variety.

This is another place where I am quite regular since my childhood. Perfect "Indianised" Chinese food. Yes you saw it right Indianised. You will hardly find authentic Chinese food in India. The reason is it doesn't go with the Indian taste buds. Here they serve Hunan Style mostly. But it is delicious. Try out Schezwan Prawns and yes the quantity is quite good. The only concern is its decor which looks dated but guys go for it... It is worth it....

Was on a 3 day food trip to kolkata and beijing was not at all on the menu. Someone on the last day suggested us to try this place located at china town and we ahead. It was jam packed. 2 floors and not a single table to eat. Had to wait for a few minutes and finally got a table. Ordered golden fried prawns, crispy chicken and chicken rice noodles. The starters were good specially the prawns, but still the taste couldnt justify the rate tag. 985 was too much for those prawns. The chicken rice noodles were horrible though. Couldnt make out whether i was having rice or noodles. Crispy chicken was amazing. Overall not a bad experience.

I am going to be totally frank about the fact that Big Boss was my first choice, but due to lack of seats on doshomi durga puja, Beijing was the place we chose to had dinner.
Unlike Big Boss, the diner table weren't arranged over lapping each other. Given the fact that the restaurant was full with people, our food came in within said time! We ordered noodles, chicken rice, one side dish for chicken and other of prawn. For starters we had two chicken and one prawn item. The prawns were jumbo in size and really good!
Though i found the place to be little pricey, the food was good overall!

But her Beijing is the best.
Though we have also the best chinese restaurants here like Big boss and Golden joy.
Let me start with the food we ordered.
Prawn chips
Beer
Golden fried prawn (Big boss is better)
Drums of heaven: Great
Sichuan fish (awesome)
Chilli fish dry
Mixed fried rice
Kung pao chicken (great)

Beijing is  my favourite when it comes to restaurants in the Tangra area. Today we decided to visit here as we thought it would be less crowded on account of Laxmi Puja . As expected the place was quite empty . Beijing's decor & ambience have remained the same , even the staffs are almost the same . We ordered the following :
Crispy Fish : Though we mainly prefer DOH but today chose Crispy fish . It was really crispy with less coating & good quality fish & with sweet chili sauce tasted heavenly.
Mixed Cantonese Chow : This gravy preparation is their specialization . Each time I try it I find it better than the last time . The quality of Chow & taste of gravy is second to none .
Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken dry : Another of my favourites . I tasted it first here way back & since then has remained my favourite . An awesome combination with Mixed Cantonese Gravy Chow .
Schezwan Rice : A good preparation but not as great as the previous one , Spice & tasty .
       One of their signature items is Roasted Duck but it is better to have it during winter .
        Overall nice experience with eagerness to come back again .

There was not huge rush as well, still the quality & quantity both compared to the price and other eateries around like Big Boss & Golden Joy is horrible. Prawn chips - half cooked. Chilli garlic pepper fish - hard & stale.

Would not recommend to anyone again.

On Navami day ( 10.11.16) after some Durga Puja pandal hopping 3 of us decided to have lunch at Beijing restaurant in China Town, Tangra, Kolkata. It is situated in a narrow street which is dotted with many chinese eating joints. The environment outside is not very clean though. But once inside you can feel the difference. Ambiance is nice and bustling with diners in 2 floors. We had to wait for about 30 mins before we were seated at a corner table. Straight away we went down to business and ordered chicken sweet corn soup, chilly chicken (gravy), Fish with baby corn and mushroom, mixed fried rice and chicken hakka chowmein. Soup was served immediately but it took a while for the main course to arrive due to the heavy rush. Soup was good and big chunks of chicken could be seen. Hakka chwomein was tasty and the fried rice was fine but a bit oily. I guess these dishes have been indianised to suit our taste buds. Fish with baby corn and mushroom was very good. Chilly chicken was standard stuff. Helpings per dish were very generous and the best part was the reasonable pricing that won't burn a big hole in the pocket! Total cost was about Rs 1500!

The service provided here was not at all good this time, the last time it was really good . It is declining day by day . They keep on blaming the new staffs but the same mistakes are repeated after warning them . We ordered something else and came and served something else, the ice cubes are literally thrown in the drink glasses  and after telling them to do in a proper way they seem to have not yet bothered. I won't visit such places again where the services are not good and satisfactory. I hope it change for a betterment.

Yesterday (on the auspicious evening of Maha Nabami) went to Beijing with two friends of mine in the evening, in midst of horrible downpour. We chose to leave all the dining options in Mani square because Beijing has always been a tried and tasted option for us. We were rudely told by the restaurant authority that only "families" are allowed and family means at least one "lady" needs to be in the group. We did explain that we are frequent to this place and that's why we in the midst of downpour leaving other options. But we were showed the door. We decided yesterday we are never going back to this place and also will discourage our friends and family to avoid this restaurant. Goodbye Beijing. 
P.S. - The rating is solely based on the experience we had yesterday evening.¬† I feel sorry for the chef's working here. Clearly the management is ruining the reputation.

This place had been on my list for a long time. It is one of the most reputed and famous Chinese restaurant in the city. The place is huge,with two floors of seating and numerous tables. We ordered chilli garlic pepper fried chicken for the starters. The dish was tasty,crispy fried chicken with chopped chillis. For the mains we had Shanghai Chicken, Hakka noodles and fried rice. All the dishes tasted good. But the food was too oily and was not at all authentic. I had gone there expecting authentic Chinese taste.  There is a good variety on the menu and it may seem a little expensive but the quantity they offer is quite a lot. The service was quick and prompt but the waiters who served us were extremely rude and indifferent towards us and all other customers. We were getting pretty heated up and saw the same on nearby tables. Even after a customer complained , the waiter wasn't even courteous enough to apologize. It was an alright first time experience. But I don't really look forward to going back soon.

Visitor in Kolkata, heard a lot about  Chinatown, first visited Big Boss and it was a big dud, locals suggested to try Beijing. So came to Beijing, ordered the mixed rice noodle, if you thought it is a combination of rice AND noodles then it is clear that you have come from outside. It is actually noodles made of rice, thin noodles compared to traditional what we from Mumbai are used to. Quantity wise the portion is very large and more than sufficient for 2 adults. Taste wise nothing out of the world or probably I had high expectations, but for sure far better than Big Boss. Big Boss the service also sucks. Chinatown striked off my list.

After a poor outing at Big boss we were reluctant to visit chinatown again but went to beijing by its reputation to give it a try but we were surprised to find excellent food there, they dont serve authentic chinese, their food is heavily indianized but still we loved all the items very much. Dining area is big which is common in chinatown, waiters were bit rude, ambiance ordinary , no chinese feel at all but food was excellent. They have vallet parking system which is good, dont have to worry about parking your car. Now coming to the food, ordered chili garlic fish, chicken fried wanton, dry seczwan chicken and crispy mutton spare ribs for starters, all were good. for main course ordered chicken meifoon, egg fried rice, fish n hot garlic sauce, shanghai prawns and special chili chicken. , all were very good. booze is not cheap, quite expensive. we were a group of 8 people and per head cost was above rs 1000. overall had a satisfactory experience.

It is a chinese family restaurant which provides great value for money. The quantity and the quality of food is amazing. We had orderded hot garlic chicken  half which had 8 pieces .The chicken was soft and tender and the taste had the perfect blend of Chinese flavours. The waiters are very friendly and the place is quite big. Surely a recommendation.:)

Went there during afternoon of 12th Sept 2016 on my best friends birthday. Its was a nice experience.
The AMBIENCE here was nice though we were sent to bar as didn't hav ne gal with us. But the bar was nice clean and not gloomy & dark like bigboss.
THE FOOD
i. Starter: Had CHILLI GARLIC PEPPER CHICKEN DRY - It was really light the chicken well cooked and soft but had a nice CRISP to it with a spicy zest. Though I always hav this dish whenever I go to ne Chinese restaurants in Tangra. It was really good and had two plates of it.
ii. Main Course: We had:
a. Mixed Fried Rice: Well it was good too.. had such good Fried Rice in a long time.. it was light and not too oily and had enough ingredients in each bite to make it interesting.
b. Chicken Manchurian: The Size of Manchurian Balls was good but the Gravy was a downer. It was really bland. Though they added salt and made it a bit spicey after complaining about it being bland. But didn't actually enjoy it. Never gonna hav it again here.
The Behavior & service here of the staff is really nice and they are quite helpful. Cudn't hav ne dessert as our tommy was full as the quantity of all dishes is quite sufficient...for Two well eaters like us..

Beijing being one of the restaurants in China Town never lets you down!! Had been there today with a group of friends. Their service is quick and the delicacies are really mouth-watery! What more can a foodie expect when all the expectations are met!! I would recommend people to try out the dishes over here!

I think i have visited all the chinese restaurants in kolkata and this will be the first on my list. 
Went there on a weekend. Superb ambience. Great service.really affordable. 
A great food joint for broke students like us. Although the prices of the booze is on the higher sides. But who cares when you get the best chinese in kolkata. 
Go there once you will start hating mainland china for overcharging you. 
Must try- drums of heaven

Beijing restaurant is located in "china town" Tangra near to the Bigg boss restaurant. 
Went there once last year... tried mixed fried rice, chicken pakoda, chilli fish..  Very good taste but their service was not impressive. Else fine....

Beijing is one of my favourite choices from the Chinese food joints in Tyangra‚Ä¶  I started going there probably since late 90s with Dad followed by the hilarious trips with friends and so on‚Ä¶ One thing remain same which is nothing but that typical Tyangra feel and decent Chinese food there even after having several options now in Kolkata. I went there yesterday after a long time and the best part is the food is as good as always. Our order was consisting of my favourites given when it comes to food my family and pals completely rely on my choices. We started with the perfect Prawn chips (this is my little one‚Äôs favourite and she ended on having 5 chips) followed by Drums of heaven (as decent as always) and Crispy fried Lamb (this one is worth having at Beijing). As main course there was mixed Chili Garlic Fried rice and Beijing‚Äôs special Noodles along with Dry Chili Garlic Fish (this one is my favourite) and ended with Ice Cream with Walnut toffies (another favourite of mine; vanilla ice cream topped with loads of crunchy Walnut toffies)‚Ä¶Last but not the least there was long Iceland tea and cold drink to match with my choice of food at Beijing.

A standalone top rated elite property of china town in kolkata , BEIJING has always been an old favourite of mine. Dropped in for lunch with an old friend and whats better than unending conversations over some chinese and chilled beer! We ordered half portion of  PEPPER GARLIC CHICKEN for starter and that was utterly delicious, just that the quantity was much less . MIXED HAKA NOODLES and SCHEZWAN CHICKEN in main course , the noodles was tad oily but had ample lot of prawns and chicken and the schezwan sauce here is amazing , unlike other places , less spicy and on the sweet side. Food was very palatable but the it took a while to arrive , service needs a lot of improvement .

Beijing,well it's one of the legendary places to gorge on Chinese food in Kolkata. It's not easy to hold Ur own in Chinatown for so many years but Beijing has done it effortlessly. I love this place and been coming here since time immemorial but lk other old Jem's of Kolkata which HV lost their sheen over the years Beijing has went from strength to strength.
Ambience: only thing that bugs me about Beijing is the ambience. They can definitely improve in that.
Food: the food is above reproach. The noodles are an inspiration and what I found most amazing about this place is the chicken and how succulent and juicy they are(sorry KFC).
Service: very warm and generous. Over the years I HV developed this sorta friendship with some of the person's there.
Price: o plz this food is priceless
Overall I love this place.plz enjoy the Chinese here.

Favourite since childhood. The chinese delicacies they serve is something one craves for. The prawn items are heavenly along with the chicken dishes. The varieties on their menu is enormous and gives a tough time to customers to choose. Every item is as great as the other. A bit costly but absolutely worth it. Ambience is great. Remains packed all the time. Table reservation is recommended henceforth if you're planning to visit on weekends. The staffs are co-ordial and the decor is amazing! The food quality and the quantity is top knotch which goes without saying. Keeping it short. The pictures will do the talking.

Chinese food lover? Your search ends here.
Beijing won't disappoint you. A must try for all.

Chinatown is one of the places that is a must visit place for every Calcuttan. So being a Calcuttan it was sooner or later that i visited this place.So this weekend i finally had a chance to visit this place with my family.We had booked a table beforehand since its difficult to get a place at this establishment without prior booking. We arrived at around 1:30 and was shown to our seats.I was impressed by the chinese decorations and wall hangings.We settled down and started ordering.For starters we had chicken clear soup,chicken asparagus soup,chicken drumstick and spring chicken.Also for drinks we took sweet lime soda.The starters arrived and we delved into it.The drumstick was fried chicken leg pieces and spring chicken was also fried chicken.We were a little disappointed as we had expected the drumstick to be with gravy.Nevertheless the starters made up for it.The soup was also light filled with pieces of chicken.For main course we ordered beijing special noodles,beijing special fried rice,chilly garlic chicken and sweet n sour fish.The food took around 15 mins to arrive and when it arrived we could smell the aroma even before we divulged into the food.Coming to the food the rice was light and tasty filled with adequate portions of chicken,prawn,mushroom and egg.Along with it the chilly garlic chicken tasted just heaven.The chilly garlic chicken was little crispy not much spicy and prepared to perfection. The noodles were a class apart and had good portions of chicken,mushroom,egg and prawn.It tasted delicious but it was the sweet n sour fish that stole the show.The fish was soft,succulent and melted in mouth.The gravy had right blend of spices and was delicious too.One thing to mention is the portions of the food they provide,one plate is more than enough for two people.We didn't have any desserts as we were already full.One thing to say that the food was very light and we didn't feel heavy at all.The total bill was around 3404 which is quite reasonable.Hoping to come back soon.

It was a visit after a very long time...was surprised to see that the taste & quality is still the same..though they have hiked their prices a lot but that is more or less becoming a general trend...the fish dishes were heavenly..especially the crispy fish..also shanghai fish & chilli garlic fish were equally good...more than enough quantity (typical characteristics of the restaurants in china town)..their signature preparation Meinfoon (rice noodles) also was good enough..only negative I feel is the parking provision..not enough space like bigboss...a night well spent with good food...

Last time I visited this place, a couple of months back, I had Chicken Manchow Soup in the starter. Then Mixed Fried Rice & Chicken Hakka Noodles, with Lemon Chicken, Hakka Chicken and Shanghai Chicken. Everything was good and perfect, & I believe it's better than Mainland China.

In main course we ordered chicken fried rice, sanghai chicken, chicken in hot garlic sauce and green pepper chicken. All the chicken dishes were average and  so was the fried rice. 
Overall i thing i expected the food to be more than just average in an restaurant in china town.

I am a frequenter at this place so I'll keep it short and simple. If you are looking for quality Chinese at affordable prices, this is the place for you, undoubtedly. One negative aspect of this place is that you hardly find a restaurant ambience, no music to sooth your tough day  and the cacophony when the place is filled is often highly disturbing.

I have been a regular visitor to Tangra , Kolkata‚Äôs Chinatown for a quarter of a century. My favorite eatery in those days was Kim Ling opened in the early 1990‚Äôs by Monica Liu , ‚ÄúThe Queen of Tangra‚Äù as she has been dubbed. This formidable lady is a true ode to ‚Äúwoman power‚Äù and is someone who I greatly respect and admire. Today her ‚Äúculinary kingdom‚Äù consists of five restaurants all extremely successful and serving up the famed ‚ÄúTangra Chinese Cuisine‚Äù that the City of Joy is known for ‚Ä¶ yes Kolkata‚Äôs love affair with Chinese food carries on unabated.

Beijing is my all time favourite place for Chinese cuisine. Located in country's only China town, Beijing never fails to give me a wow and yum experience.
This time, I ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken and Cantonese Noodles.
I experimented with Kung Pao Chicken and I have no regrets. Cooked richly with cashwenuts the dish was divine. It wasn't excessively oily nor was it extremely nutty. It has quite an generous amount of shredded chicken. This dish should be a must have for all Beijing goers.
The Cantonese Noodles was oriental in its true sense. It had a tinge of raw taste which I absolutely loved. Cooked with mild spices and green vegetales and prawns and chicken this is the type of noodles which I expect from a place in China town. Had a lovely experience.

I however would expect a more prompt and warm service. Recommended.

Bon apetit üëå

Rather the only place, where it loses out to Big Boss, is the parking. Although it still has a valet parking, but it does not have that enormous parking lot which Big Boss has.

This place is known for its quality Chinese. Pricing is on the higher side compared to other restaurants in China Town. But still this place is worth visiting. 

Although they have bumped up the prices recently, but it's worth it. Since, the price is a bit on the higher side, you would expect the crowd to be filtered. 

So, for entrees, we went for Crispy Chicken, Honey Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken. None of the entrees failed to impress us. All of them equally delicious and still the taste of Kung Pao Chicken lingers in my taste buds. Toufu has been, for quite a time, on my list and I finally tasted it here. For the mains, the Chilli Garlic Noodles and Lemon chicken was fantastic. Portions were enormous. 

The decor is equally good. The place is well maintained. Worth visiting again. Definitely on my list, for a visit again.

Useless extra charges on alcohol even excluding taxes
Never order tofu dishes, the quantity of tofu will aggravate you

The food is really bad.We ordered crispy chilli baby corn,all we got was a few dead peices of fired baby corn tossed with two handfulls of green chillis and some garlic seasoning.cost-300 app(not worth it).fried rice tasted like it was re heated in the pan before serving,and stir fired veggies were;just stired fried veggies with some salt to taste,nothing else.I have been to swankier places with better prices and serving portions.If you dont drink alcohol or take duck faced selfies with your food,this is not the place for you.(.5 stars extra for the waiter who warned us that the soup was bad.)

Chicken Hakka Noodles...Chicken Fried Rice...Schezwan Prawn...Beijing Special Chilli Chicken...Garlic Chicken Chilli...Each item scores over other...It will be unfair to review one....Take ur own sweet time and savor each one of them...

Beijing is the poshest restaurant in tangra. Well it's as posh as tangra will let you be. It predates big boss and golden joy as the go to place. It's not much different on the affordability range than most of the other restaurants and it's definitely showing some wear and tear. 
Food here is reasonably good in fact the golden fried prawn is delish. We were here last in February and we gorged on the spring rolls, crab and bangalir bestest chilli chicken .

I think one of the best Chinese cuisine in the town with a good variety of Chinese food,  noodles and rice are really good. The side dishes and starters are good too. It has a good family ambiance compared to the other resturants in China Town. Good place to go in big groups too. The owner and the waiters and staffs are very well behaved and welcoming.

Got introduced to dis place quiet late. But as dey say best things come at last, so is Beijing. Located at Tangra famously known as Chinatown of Kolkata - dere Drums of Heaven, Golden fried Prawn and Kung Pao Chicken are best in the city. Ambience is good. Amount is good as per cost.Service is fast and waiters are helpful. The place has been renovated few months back but d food remains awesome.

I was highly disappointed with Beijing!
I have had friends going gaga over the food of Beijing saying it serves authentic Chinese.However I beg to differ!

I wouldn't say the food was bad however I have had much better Chinese in other restaurants of Kolkata.
There is nothing special about this place.The ambience is average,the food is average the location is bad (but we can't help if its in Tengra),the waiters look bored.However you can't complain about the quantity.It is more than enough for two people and just right for 4 people.

I don't think I will re visit.

Some places are considered legendary for a reason. Beijing in the Tangra, Kolkata's very own Chinatown is a case in point. Its amazing Indo-Chinese fare keeps drawing in people again and again.¬†

Coming to the food, we tried their Dry Chilli Fish and Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken for appetizers. The fish is not what you would expect; it consists of solid chunks of batter fried fish tossed with aromatics, the dish isn't saucy at all. Yet, it is an excellent example of beauty in simplicity, all the flavours melded together beautifully. The chicken was crispy, spicy and had a strong hint of garlic which I absolutely loved.

I have never been a fan of Chinese dishes with a watery gravy, and so we asked the waiter for suggestions on a dish on the dry side to go with our Chicken Hakka Chow for our main course. We were suggested the Kung Pao Chicken, and an excellent suggestion it was, too. Small pieces of shredded chicken tossed in a spicy, tangy sauce with a generous helping of spring onions and even more generous helping of fried cashewnuts which added a textural dimension to the dish which I loved.

We also ordered fresh lime soda which was refreshing and went excellently well with the starters and mains. We skipped dessert (something I rarely do) as we were in a hurry but it was a little meal worth remembering. I will definitely revisit this place. Definitely recommended for all lovers of authentic Indo-Chinese cuisine.

Had been there last evening for a family dinner. Mainly because younger daughter has come home for a few days after a long time. Regret to say, was disappointed. Beijing seems to have changed. For the worse. Service was lack-daisical, waiters appeared 'lost'. Portions appeared of dissimilar amounts between tables, particularly for Prawn Crackers. Nothing to complain about food taste, though.

An overrated over hyped restaurant.Only running due to the fame it has already gained. Food quality very average so.is the ambience.Only plus point is that they serve in a good quantity. THEIR half plate of every dish will be enough for 2 persons easily. Though they claim to be selling authentic Indo chineese dishes but i would say Many other underrated restaurants sell better chineese dishes. Very average quality food .nothing special.
Servicemen were friendly.

I visited the legendary Beijing recently with a group of friends. The service staff is not at all welcoming. They didn't even come and ask us for water in the next 10 mins when the restaurant wasnt full.. There were hardly us and another group. So on service quotient the lack badly and need to improve. Now coming to the main part, the food.. We order chilli pepper prawn, chilly pepper chicken, crispy fried fish in starters and for main course Cantonese chowmein and honey chicken. The food was very ordinary but the honey chicken was very good.. It wasn't too sweet but had a perfect balance of sweet and savoury. All in all I would score this place 2 and if asked whether to revisit, I would like to try other legendaries..

I am sure everyone would appreciate this place for their good food and service but the horror i faced this evening was terrific. I with some of my office colleagues had gone for a dinner to this place today and when we were just done with our meal were leaving this place. One of my friend's son had gone to use the washroom and when he returned from there he was just afraid and started pointing to one of the house keeping staffs telling us that he had tried to touch his private parts. Two of my colleagues even tried to confront the guy but he denied. When me and the mother( of the child ) who was also my colleague approached the manager he called the house keeping guy and asked him to say "sorry" to us!! If only "sorry" was an excuse to molest a child of 12 year old. We also informed the other  parents who were present there with their family including children. We are going to lodge an FIR against that person and against BEIJING for this case. We cannot let loose that criminal. We only didnt behave rudely in the restaurant premises because they might use our actions against us.

Visited them today. Ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka and Manchurian. The manchurian gravy was really bad. Too much salt in it rendered it non-eatable. When I asked them about it, although the price was reduced but the behaviour of the Manager was rude. I was shocked by his behaviour. Would think twice before visiting this place again as neither is the food quality any good nor is the behaviour of the manager.

I also ordered for the fried wantons, the preparation took me by surprise it was yummy, eaten it in several places and cities but this one is super different and worth a try.  What I really liked about this place its not swanky, but definitely serves some delicious food. The quantity is decent definitely not less, serve is also good.

The food they serve is probably  is still among the best in tangra. We had golden fried prawns, chicken drumstick, chilli fish, garlic chicken to name a few. All the food was hot and tasted as good as they always do. The service has improved too. Good outing all in all.

I went here with sky high expectation after hearing a lot from my friends.Although the food was overall good it was nothing that deserves special mention.For starters we had order drums of heaven followed by Beijing special noodles,chicken fried rice and sezchuan chicken and garlic fish.Noodles tasted great with a perfect blend of spices and had chicken,mushroom,mutton and prawns in it,whereas the fried rice,garlic fish sezchuan chicken was good to taste but nothing extra ordinary.
What ruined my appetite was the Cantonese noodles which we ordered later.First of all it was too bland for Indian taste and on top of that it had a very strong bitter taste to it. When we complained about it strangely we were told,that the dish had this slight signature taste to it(which i had not felt at any other restaurant).
The service was prompt and staff is courteous.
Overall i would rate 2.5 considering all the above factors and the price,which a bit on the higher side for the quality(and quantity) offered.

The diners across the city is cooking up a storm with oh so many different flavours and twists...in this fast moving era the bland flavours need to be reworked fast.

The basic problem with this places in china town is that the dont have well trained staff. Of course the food is good but then again the type of rates they charge they should at least have trained and courteous staff. I went there on a weekday only for takeaway and saw that the restaurant is totally empty with only one table occupied. There was at least 8 waiters all gossiping among themselves and I had to call them thrice. I dont what why they were so busy gossiping and just kept ignoring customers. My revommendation. Totally a messy place if you are looking for good service.

It was wonderful to see that Beijing still remains the flagbearer of the China Town eateries and continues it‚Äôs delightful tradition of serving delicious indian-chinese cuisine.

Saturday 7 PM and almost 70% of the ground floor tables were full. It is ironic that the traditional teetotaler, non-alcoholic-beverage-savvy middle class Bengali families still throng Beijing, while they consciously avoid the nuveau-rich Big Boss, Fung Fa etc .. which are mostly funded by IT and industries of their ilk ,at China Town. With the advent of malls, food courts and branded franchisee bar-restaurants, I have witnessed the gradual reduction in footfall in and around tangra. Not to mention the gala buffet and dinner served by Sigree which is less than 2 kms away, still, Beijing remains a ‚Äúsafe and tested‚Äù option for even suburban Bengali families travelling to china town for Chinese food.

It is interesting to note that most of the Chinese joints in Tangra, would normally open up their 1st floor for family dining place, knowing fully well that without the bar-binge crowd, it is almost impossible to generate the revenue the sustain. Kudos to Mrs Monica Liu for keeping the tradition alive ! !

Enough of my nagging and emotional badgering ‚Ä¶ We ordered the tried and tasted(a million times maybe ! ! !) Chilli Garlic Fried Pepper Chicken along with prawn papads. The starter retains the same 15-16 pieces of perfectly marinated boneless chicken strips, with a batter which is heavy on eggs, not to make the coating thick ! ! Sauted and cooked with julienned garlic and green chillies, was a treat which I have gorged on for the last 20 years. Brilliant !

For main course we ordered (for a family of 2 and a half) half portions of sweet and sour chicken and chilly fish each and a mixed fried rice.

Chilly fish was bhetki cooked with soy sauce and green chilly and the sweet and sour chicken had the traditional cucumber, onion and tomato based gravy.

Orders were served very promptly, just like always and the balance and the carefully calibrated soy-tomato ketchup vs fish paste garnishing was exquisite.

Not being cynical at all, I wondered, in today‚Äôs world of Yauatchas, Chillis, TGI Fridays and Mainland Chinas ‚Ä¶ how could Beijing, completely isolated on a potholed road with open drains, survived and even forced such reverence from fans and patrons alike ! What‚Äôs the secret sauce ?

4.0 on my scale.

Soup H&S 1/2, great fill shredded chicken mushroom, excellent, they say if u don't try golden prawn the u have not visited this place, so tried, but different the what  I thought, but good.

Last week we visited Beijing to eat some snacks . its very easy to locate. the decor is good and the enviornment is cosy. The waiter's are very prompted and well mannered. we ordered chilly garlic chicken, crispy fish, prawn chips and golden fried prawn.
chilly garlic chicken: it tastes good but chilly and garlic the main ingredients were missing in the preparation. dont understand why they called it "chilly garlic" chicken!!!

crispy fish:  medium sized fish pieces fried in corn flour batter .. fish was fresh and juicy.. the item was nice
 
prawn chips: really enjoyed it with a bottle of beer. chips were crispy nd not vry oily.

golden fried prawn: 5 pieces of medium sized prawn costs 960 bucks!!!!!!! its tastes ordinary .. and it was oily ...  

overall a mixed experience. the food is nothing extraordinary . For 1 time visit its okay.

We were having Chinese cravings and went to Tangra after a really long time as we were looking forward to having a lot of prawns for starters. It was a Sunday evening and we decided to try Beijing for the first time. It wasn't too crowded as we went around 730pm and sat down to order. The place had better interiors than most places around there but their staff didn't know much about the menu when we asked him for his recommendations. Was about to order a prawn starter and realised that a 5/6 portion of tiger prawns was priced at 950 plus tax which shocked us totally. Most 5 star hotels don't charge as much for prawns. We didn't want to compromise on our orders as we knew other restaurants around serve prawns at half that price. So we walked out of the place ! But i think the owners need to review their pricing as there are enough options around this place !

Visited the joint after almost a decade.It was a Friday afternoon.The joint was fairly crowded though finding a vacant table was not a problem at all.Had the following:
1. Mixed Fried Rice
2. Beijing Special Chilly Chicken
3. Kung pao Chicken
4. Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish
5. Chilly Garlic Chicken

Now coming to the analysis of food.Truth be told, the good part was that the serving time was prompt and quantity of each dish was adequate.No worries on that.But the taste of the dishes was somewhat lacking.Difficult to express in words but somehow felt it was run of the mill stuff that one gets to have in any local Indianised joint.The fried rice was bit too oily though had loads of shredded chicken and shrimps.Surprise element was the presence of green peas in the rice.Cannot remember to ever sample green peas in a Chinese dish-too much Indianisation perhaps. The Kung pao chicken was bit gooey for my liking- i prefer it to be a bit crispy and dry.No complaints on the generous amount of cashew nuts in the dish though.Both the Chilly Garlic Pepper Fish and Chicken dishes were essentially deep fried fish and chicken served with a liberal dose of chopped green chillies.Quite hot and spicy and definitely not for the faint-hearted. Do not fail to ask the staff to serve the Chilly Honey sauce.It is awesome and acts as a perfect neutraliser to the sizzling hot dishes.
We also had a couple of drinks.Prices of alcohol is quite steep though.
Run of the mill service,food quality,staff attentiveness etc.Not the experience to induce a repeat visit in the near future.

i have been to china town several time and i always had a good time there, but this time i went to Beijing with my family, but we had the worst time ever there regarding food. the service was not good , the food was a disaster. we felt ripped off. we were so disappointed. our money got wasted and we left empty stomach because the food was not good. i'll not recommend anyone.

This place is situated inside the China Town of Kolkata called Tangra and serves authentic Chinese food. I had huge expectations, however the service was slow and the staff behaviour was not so good. The food however was good but nothing extraordinary. The Chilly Honey Chicken was tasty and went well with Hakka Noodles. Overall average experience! Ambiance is good.

This place had been on my wish list since a long time...so today we decided to celebrate our anniversary at Beijing...we had ordered chicken hakka noodles,Shanghai chicken and fresh lime soda...the noodles were perfect and since I love spicy food,the Shanghai chicken was mind blowing...the quantity of side dish was 12-13 pieces (full plate) ..though I felt that the quantity of noodles was on the lower side..the green chilly chutney deserves a special mention ..taste wise they are definitely upto the mark..fresh lime soda was fine...very prompt service..the food arrived within 10 minutes of placing the order..the staff were extremely cordial and polite...one of the best places in China Town......

Visited Beijing again for ashtami lunch.. even if it was crowded,they handled it with ease.ordered mixed fried rice and schzwan chicken..and they nailed it..even if it was pujo their neither the quality nor quantity faltered...

well my mother in law flew in from atlanta to spend a few days with us and she really wanted to check out THE INDIAN CHINESE cuisine. so last sunday all of a sudden we made the plan and arrived there. Even though my normal place is hot wok, with family u r somewat restricted in choice of places. Anyhow, as starter we ordered drums of heaven and potato manchurian (as we were curious and yes it killed the cat again). the drums were supposed to be served with hot sauce( @waiter) which was actually a sweet sauce in reality and the potato manchurian is basically a plate of french fries with lot of extra spices and GARLIC .. tons of it, garnished with a pool of oil in the plate.
Main course: I dont eat fish and rest of my family is vegetarian, this review does not include seafood or FW food.

well the portions served for my sichuan mixed rice and their sichuan veg rice noodles was so intimidating and we knew we wont be able to finish tat and we got the extra portions packed (stopped at sharmas ¬†to load up on lassi and puri on the way to beijing.. cant help it lol)

now the chicken side dish of garlic pepper chicken dry was okaish,

to be safe we went with the classic option of veg manchurian ,even though the sauce was ok, the manchurians were hard in the middle. ¬†not so grt!

anyways , will i go back there? Ya why not ! the variety in Veg Section is huge and well eating once doesnt qualify cutting it out of our list of places to go to.
but next time we will definitely take the risk of ordering something unknown, hehe

Used to be an awesome Chinese place a decade ago. 

The quality has really dropped now, the Chinese food is full of oil and smells old. Some of the food items is really stale specially if you go for lunch on a weekday. 

Portion size is good though which is probably the only plus. 

Staff is not bothered and is not courteous when compared to the price that we pay for the service

Have been here many a times. You will find the restaurant on your left just after entering China town. Food is good here. Some of my favourites are Chilly Garlic Prawn, Chilly Crab Claws (if available), Mixed Cantonese Chowmein and Honey Chicken. Nice clean environment. Sufficient seating capacity. However, in comparison to the portions, the prices have gone really up nowadays. They are charging Rs.750 for a portion of standard sized prawn, which I feel is exorbitantly high.

Me and two of my friends were on a shopping spree that evening. From Forum to Quest, and getting sale in brands, was like which made it a great shopping evening. We stay in Tangra itself, so soon as we got back from our shopping spree we were hungry soon. We planned to go and have something in a nearby restaurant in China Town, so we came over to this place.
We entered, the place seemed okay. It was crowded. Decor was of red, yellow, and golden, it was good but nothing wow. Ambience could have been better.
We did not have much time in hand, and we were there just for something so that it could fill our tummies. We ordered for Sweet Corn Chicken soup half portion, which was sufficient for both of us. For drinks, we ordered one Sweet Lime and Blue Mint, which tasted not-so-good.
The staff was not so co-operative, had to tell them multiple times to get things done.
Prices, I feel, is on the higher side compared to the place, ambience and food quality.
Nothing great!

It is one of the best Indian Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. Although ambiance is not that great and location is bit let down, but food and its price compensate its let downs. One should try their wantons, Chilly chicken (with Bone), Rice noodles. Price of liqueur is very reasonable.

Extremely disappointed with the food and quality vs average rating of 3.8. 

1. The food quality is that of a street hawker 

2. They have not evolved at all compared with the Chinese restaurants which have  come up recently 

3. If you expecting that great kolkata Chinese food, please don't go here as you would be extremely disappointed

Visited this place hoping to eat authentic Chinese food as recommended on Zomato. We were greeted by a rather glum captain, who immediately told us most of the non veg (mutton, duck, crab etc) dishes were unavailable. 
Crispy chicken and chow noodles were not good at all. Our only solace was the veg fried rice, which was actually tasty. 
We were expecting a decent China town experience in Kolkata, didn't dare eat Chinese food after this.

I've been to Tangra a few times, heard a lot about this restaurant. Tagged as a legendary one among the Kolkatan Chinese scene, my recent visit turned out to be a disappointing one.
The interiors id designed along chinese styles with bamboos & dragons etc. Seating arrangement is spacious. However I think they have some problem with their air conditioning system. It was uncomfortably warm , inspite of reminding twice the issue was hardly solved.
Coming to the food we ordered Crispy Chicken, fried Prawn balls as starters along with Tom collins, Long Island Ice tea & Cool Green sea from the drinks menu.
Crispy Chicken was overcooked, other eateries around tangra serve it in a much better fashion. Fried prawn balls were not that great in taste. i believe, since I was not there to have drinks this time, the side dishes did not appeal to me much.
The Cool Green Sea I ordered was just a waste of money. It was never meant to be a starter drink. i shouldn't have ordered it as it mostly ruined my appetite with the ice cream, soda & syrup combination. From the appearance Long Island Ice tea seemed lacking the citrus pulp. So much so, my friend actually added juice of half a lime to make it gulpable. The Tom Collins was fine.
From the food menu we ordered Egg Chowmein & Mixed Fried Rice along with Chilli Garlic Chicken. I think from the attached photos it is quite evident how worthless they were. I mean they were bad, literally competing with the roadside roll shops. The chickens in the side dish were hard & flavorless from the inside.
as for dessert, darsan wasn't available so had to settle for Kesar pista, butterscotch, Tutty Fruity & Black Forest Sunde.
At 135-145 rs the two scoops of ice creams were a rip-off. The presentation was too bad, the price tag unjustified.
The Tutty Fruity & Black forest Sundae were disappointing as well. I have had better at much lower price.
Overall it was a bad experience.
I am not sure whether I'll visit Beijing again.

One of the most popular resturant in kolkata it located at china town. Had crispy fish, chicken lolipop, thai soup,prawn friedrice and dry chilli chicken. The taste of the fish was heavenly and the lolipop was also very good thai soup was just like most resturant. The prawn fried rice was very good and full of prawn and chilli chiken was also good overall a very good restutant. Price is a bit on the higher side. Staff and ambience is very good and plesant.

I'd say the most overrated restaurant in Kolkata. Beijing is located right at the entrance of Tangra which is the Chinatown of Kolkata. Knowing it's highly praised reputation we visited this place right before our flight back to Delhi. 
We couldn't have been more disappointed...
To start off the ambience is very dull. Old decor and furniture that probably hasn't been changed in over a decade. The restaurant wasn't even well lit with no artifical lighting or sunlight coming in.
There were always about 8-10 staff members roaming around the restaurant like vagabonds, hovering over and staring at you while you eat; which makes you feel very uneasy. 
The food was not great either. We started out with
1.Crispy Fish: well cooked with a good seasoned batter and fried to perfection. 
The mains:
1. Beijing Hakka Chow: a blend of mushrooms, noodles, soya sauce, prawns and chicken. Although it tasted okay. The whole thing just didn't blend together. It seemed like each individual was cooked separately and then the whole thing was just dumped onto the plate at once.
2. Veg Fried Rice: a generic fried with nothing special and no unique zest. 
3. Chili Garlic Prawns: let's just say there was no chili or garlic a really bland sauce that was just overdosed on soya. Even though the prawns were cooked well the sauce was a let down. 
4. Schewan Fish: a ridiculously sweet, plain old tomato curry, which was absolutely boring to eat. 
Desserts: 
Darsan with Ice Cream: really bland not so crispy darsan with plain old vanilla ice cream. Nothing impressive.
All in all a very disappointed lunch and i can say for sure I'll not be visiting Beijing ever again.

We left home almost as soon as we came up with the thought.

I have been to this legendary Chinese Restaurant for dinner recently and have the following opinion about it
1.Ambiance - It is situated just at the entrance of the China Town.Ambiance wise it is one of the best in China Town.It is very spacious and well maintained. We were seated in the upper floor.It had a huge wall decor of dragon on a red wall. The sofas were very comfortable. one of the most well-maintained and well-lighted restaurant.
2.Hospitality - The doorkeeper was very courteous. Even the other staffs were well mannered and polite. But they took 45 mins to serve the main course - mixed noddle and chili garlic chicken, and that too after repeatedly telling them to bring the food.
3.Food - We had huge expectation after going through the reviews here but was disappointed a bit. We ordered the following:
¬†a. Kung Pao Chicken (Dry) - This is one of the best starter I have ever had. the chicken was well cooked .It was very spicy and was scattered with generous amount of cashew. Very tasty and a must have¬†
b.Beijing Hakka Noodles - This is their speciality dish. Hakka noodles with chicken, mushroom, prawn, mutton and what not. But on that day, mutton was not available and they informed us beforehand only. It was quite delicious and upto the mark
c.Chili Garlic Chicken - Quite disappointed with this one.It had so much extra salt and was average.
Disappointed with the time they took for serving the main course and even after the long wait, the chicken dish was disappointing.

Rely very good spot to fill your belly. Ordered 'drums of heaven', 'lemon chicken' & 'mixed fried rice'. The drums of heaven were "crispy from the outside & juicy from the inside" ;-P   the chicken bits of the lemon chicken were very soft, unlike those rubbery boiled bits you get in other resturants. Lastly the mixed fried rice satisfied me for the day.
Added to the fine earthy ambience which took away all the journey's tiredness and a very friendly service, this is a place i would recommend for multiple visits.

A perfect place for family dining is what Beijing stands for. We visited this place on 1st January 2016.The place was all lit up beautifully and decorated with Christmas trees here and there.
 However I would recommend reservation in advance if you are going on a holiday .the waiting time for us on new year's eve  was around 40 min. They have also opened a family section on the second floor which didn't use to be there few years back. This was my 4th visit and not to my surprise had a nice dining experience. There the crowd is a bit loud usually but then family get together are meant to be noisy and fun.  
What we ate

Starters - had tried the delicious prawn balls earlier, so this time we went for Pepper chicken fried( Dry) which consisted of shredded fried chicken cooked in chilli pepper - 2 portions sufficient for 6


Under main course, we ordered
2 mixed fried rice( prawn and chicken were in ample amount)
2 chicken fried rice
Schwezwan Chicken
Chilli garlic pepper fish
The rice portions were extremely generous and sufficient for 7.  The schwezwan chicken was no surprise but the show stopper was the fish item. Also none of the course was spicy 
And we were full to the mouth. It was a good day ended with my new year resolution of  staying health on good food for the next 365 days :)
The cheque was around 2800 for 7 which seemed a relief and made us all happy

I've heard a lot of great stuff about this place. This was my second visit. I was too young to remember anything when I went there for the first time.

The steamed chicken dumpling (10 pieces) is quite good. The sauce they serve along with it is perfect. Great starter!

The Manchurian Fish (dry) is okay-ish. Nothing great about it. The fish tasted a bit stale and hard. The Chili Chicken (gravy) was anything but Chili Chicken. No chili. There is absolutely nothing spicy about this dish.

The chicken fried rice is full of onions. Firstly, I dislike onions. Secondly, most of the Chinese restaurants in Calcutta do not serve onion in the rice. Thirdly, I don't understand why they put SO MUCH of onions.

The things good about this place are the ambience, the courteous and prompt staff, and the clean washroom, which, frankly speaking, a lot of restaurants do not maintain properly.

One of the most expensive restaurants serving chinese cuisine in kolkata doesnt deserve the 'mouthshut award of best chinese cuisine in kolkata 2013' which they proudly hang on their wall.
We ordered crispy chilly babycorn for starters. It was the most appaling crispy chilli babycorn i hv ever had. Undercooked nd tasteless. I hv had better crispy chilli babycorn in a roadside shop opp city centre1.
For the main course we ordered mixed hakka chow, chilli garlic chicken(which was horrible too) and sichuan prawn. Only sichuan prawn was good. 
Next wen we were going to order dessert they let us know that they were out of stock with ice cream. 
A restaurant in the much-celebrated china town is out of ice cream stock on new years eve at 10pm. Just imagine!
Overall: horrible experience. Deserves negative rating...but alas zomato doesnt allow that!

I went on 31st December 2015. I was not privileged to visit this place. I had to wait for 30 minutes although tables were available. Waiters served food after multiple request. We ordered American Chopsey and paneer chili in veg and prawn rice noodles and chicken Manchurian and Sichuan in Non veg. Starters were pathetic ie baby corn and paneer seems to be stale. Non veg items were up to the mark but disappointed with service a lot.

Just Edible food...¬†So being a popular restaurant in the heart of china town.. you expect good food. Food here is barely average. We left half the stuff uneaten. Over spiced ... over cooked.. unbalanced food. 

We went for lunch. The Decor was more a canteen , than a fine dining place. the service was ok. Had the 

- batter fried prawns (too much batter, no splicing on meat , over cooked meat), 

- Chicken lolipop - its called something else, but tasted exactly like that. 

- pecking duck - some one should fire the chef for such a bad dish. The meat was not evenly cooked and excessively salted. 

- noodles - Same noodles you get at your colony road side vendor. 

The only saving grace they have is the sauce on the table - spicy and sweet. 

This place is completely avoidable.

Its a famous place for oriental cuisine at Tangra. But truly I couldn't find any reason of fame. First of all I would like to point out that the staff members are rude. The food is good for its price, but nothing so special. Yes the ambiance is nice. May be because I have tasted better oriental cuisine in some other restaurant, I didn't like this place that much. But if you live in Tangra or visiting Chinatown for any reason, you can give it a try. You may like it.

China Town is one of those places where you can sit down and go on chatting for hours and hours. Visited Beijing on Boxing Day to meet up with some friends.¬†
Along with the booze, we had ordered prawn crackers, drums of heaven, fried chicken balls, dry chilli chicken and chilli garlic prawn served dry. The chilli chicken was the best among these, and the fried balls were a bit dry in my opinion.
In the main course, we had ordered mixed fried rice and mixed noodles with schezwan chicken. The dishes tasted good and well worth the Chinese flavour.
The service was a bit sloppy at times and the decor needs refurbishing.
Recommended for everybody.

If you got a gang of 10-12 friends and looking for a laid back lunch or dinner experience, then this is the place. Food is amazing and so is the quantity. A colossal menu of Chinese dishes will surely leave you bewildered while ordering. Interior has a nice ambience and is huge with plenty of tables. Its definitely one of the best restaurants in the locality.

Price is reasonable but the only thing I dislike is the amount of gravy noodle coz¬†it was not sufficient for two person. If you are going to Tangra you can try Beijing atleast once.

If u r fan of Oriental cuisine and u hvnt been to Tangra its blasphemy...and Beijing is one of the most famous joints in this area.I hv visited this place thrice and the ambience never changes. Its alwyz buzzing with customers,dimly lit and awesome food..Sit over at the general seats or the semi-secluded area...coming to the food-they hav all varieties of chinese food but what makes it different is the amount..its simple huge...especially the sides..Try the Garlic chicken or the Schezwan chickn...and in staples will be the Beijing Special Fried rice which has almost all forms of protein in it..

Unlike many other restaurants in Tangra, this one is very clean and well decorated. for starters we ordered crispy spring corn and Bloody mary. Corn was quite good, and portion was enough for 2. Bloody mary- I will say was even better than ¬†The Park. For maincourse we ordered Cantoneese mixed rice and chicken in black bean sauce. Both of them were satisfactory and portions were good. For a crispy corn, 2 bloody mary, a lime soda, a cantonese rise and half chicken we were charged 1500. Which we find justified.

Beijing's location is its biggest plus. Located as the first of sorts in a locality of chinese joints called Chinatown, Beijing serves itself well by putting up a reasonable exterior, too.

The restaurant is divided into two compartments separated by a 4ft partition. The one where people drink is the noisier one while the other is for families for a relatively quieter (you can't expect fine dining in Chinatown) meal in peace.

Reasonably priced like it's neighbors, the place doesn't stand out from the rest. Food is pretty good: typical spicy chinese fare. Service is excruciatingly slow and painful. They can be a little less arrogant for their own good.

Tip: Big Boss, a few yards from Beijing, is a much better option.

The China town , the earliest of home of the Chinese settlers in Kolkata, has always mesmerised me. Most of the renowned cities of the world has its own Chinatown and we kolkatans are also lucky to have our own Chinatown, especially for their style of food.
I cannot imagine what a Bengali would do, if he never had been exposed to the Chinese culinary delights! Thanks to our Chinese settlers, I never had to know that.
The Beijing being the premium restaurant of the China town, I have always wanted to visit, never had the chance though. Anyways, with sheer stroke of luck we ended up here yesterday night (thanks to the inept administration of Ahare Bangali festival)!
It is the 1st restaurant in the series of Chinese eateries that decorate this place.
The ambience isn't much to talk about, typical Chinese restaurant with ample space, lit with dim yet classy lights had a vibrant feel to it.
We were a pack of 6 hungry ppl, seated comfortably in the 1st floor, we begin to scour thru the menu card for some immediate respite to the fires burning in our stomach!!
For starters, we ordered a large bowl of Thai chicken soup, a plate of chilli garlic chicken and crispy fried fish, based on the suggestion of our attendant. The attendant, though seemed to be in a bit hurry in taking our orders rather than helping us in ordering. Anyways, after 5-7 minutes came the chicken starters. 13-15 pieces of decent sized chicken crisply fried and coated in garlic, chilli flavoured sauce and was served with saut√©ed pieces of chilli.The coating of the chicken was minimal and spicy. The pieces were soft. In short it was yum. We were so hungry that within seconds it disappeared from our dishes. Then I realised that the starter came before the soup. But before I could do anything about it, the crispy fish was rushed in. Anyways, without much complaint we started to devour our fish starters. 13 pieces of fish fillets , crisply fried were served. The fish pieces were succulent and coated minimally. It went well with the pudina chutney served on the table. After starters came in the Thai chicken soup. One large bowl was enough for us 6 persons. The Thai soup was bland, unlike the Thai soup I had have in other restaurants. Though filled with decent amount of minced pieces of chicken and egg, it was a letdown.
Then for main course we decided to have a mixed fare of chow and rice. We ordered 2 plates of chicken schezwan Hakka chow, at our own risk, against the caution of the attendant and the 2 plates of mixed fried rice. For side dish we settled for a plate of shanghai prawn and kung pao chicken.
The schezwan chow was reddish in color, fiery spicy and filled with decent long shreds of soft chicken. It is one of few spicy dishes that I'll remember forever. Our sinuses were cleared and eyes watered immediately :D. The shanghai prawn, was the sane one. 7 huge pieces of prawn served in a thick nicely flavoured gravy, went well with fiery chow. The prawn size was huge and it was cooked nicely, not overtly fried and succulent.
The mixed fried rice had a balanced taste and filled with decent amount of chicken, prawn and egg. It was tasty. The kungpao chicken is a shredded dry ish chicken dish served with huge dose of cashew nuts. It tasted okay. Almost one plate of fried rice was extra and we had to pack it.
In the end, we had to cool our buds with a tall glass of fresh lime soda. It was perfectly made, right amount of sweet, sourness and fizz.
Overall it was a mixed affair we had yesterday night, with highs and lows. But definitely this restaurant is better than other Chinese restaurants I've tried in China town.
PS its 1200 bux for 2 ppl.

Beijing stands tall at the entrance of food street@Tangra. It is a good shot at chinese dine out. Large seating area spread across 2 floors.

Servings are large and so is the price per dish. I don't think it was that big a value for money deal.¬†

Starter recommended was chicken fingers - it was crispy and hot.
The soup we ordered was really mediocre - manchow. :( :(

Main course was ok ok. Fried rice was good, a little dry...¬†
The mixed hakka noodles was good except the mutton pieces which were very hard.

Overall a good place for chinese.

Visited this otherwise good Chinese restaurant a couple of days ago, on navami night. Was disappointed by the food. We ordered drums of heaven & crispy fried mushrooms, but we received deep fried chicken, which had no resemblance to the dish, but the mushrooms were nice (& overpriced). Then we ordered egg & chicken noodles, a mixed rice noodles and lemon chicken. The noodles had a good changes flavour, having said that, the noodles want the thick noodles they served and the lemon chicken was way too sweet.
Will hope for a better experience.

The trip to Beijing in tangra is not a pleasant one. First I visited them on 18th October 2015 with my family. We ordered for chilli chicken and momos. The chilli chicken served was good however we were not served momos at all and we kept waiting for almost an hour and we came to know momos was not available. Next week again visited them on 21st October 2015 and the experience was not at all good. Most of the items on their menu is not available. The staff is horrible and highly unprofessional. Really worst experience.

I was there with my family last evening and the best possible way to describe my experience was "Nothing Special". Food was okay and the service was ordinary. It seems the servers are angry with the customers so much that they try to act rudely even to first timers. Of course, there are exceptions and not everyone were acting the same way. My advice to first timers would be not to try new things and never try lemon chicken if you like spicy food. Lemon chicken is actually sweet. Thai soup is good.

Probably the best restaurant in China Town. Been there many times. All the food items are of great quality specially the starters are superb. The only thing that bothers me is the lack of cocktails & mocktails.

Chinatown in Tangra is all about the food. Ambiance is just about decent nothing eccentric about it. But the food is very good. Not at all a pocket pinch, perfect place for a good family gathering. Been here for normal dinner and birthday party. All my ratings goes to the good food at a good value.One can try any item on the menu with a guarantee of good taste, but my recommendation would be to try their duck dishes. Havent had such good duck any where else in Kolkata

Dishes we loved- Golden fried prawns, Peking Duck, Duck szechwan

Coming back to the restaurant...yes it served us well every time we went there.
Warning:: don't you dare try to go there during durga puja!! You'll never ever find a place for yourself ;) forget about the folk you are with!!!
Anyway better try this place in off season & try some starters (crispy chili baby corn or some chicken drums or fried wonton ) with soup...they also serve good fish (the garlic one)
Overall its a nice junction to hangout with your kinda ppl.

This is one of the oldest restaurants in kolkata located at tangra commonly known as China town.Ambiance is very nice and quiet as compared to other restaurants in china town.Food is very much satisfying to your taste buds and you will get nice brands of alcohol there.

This weekend we headed for this much acclaimed restaurant in Tangra. I must admit this place doesn't disappoint at all. The staff are courteous, service is efficient and decor is nothing Ott but has a minimal yet cosy feel to it. The thing to rave about is the Chinese fare they serve...in one word, its sumptuous! The soup was spot on and so was the main course. The place was a lil crowded but that could in no way dampen the service. Do I need to mention how much I m looking forward to visit this place again ? The efficiency and food fare that this place provides, absolutely demands  it!

After long time I have visited this restaurant with my family today for Sunday lunch. It was almost full but we didn't need to wait. The decor, ambience don't required any special mention. The taste of authentic Chinese food of this restaurant remains same. We ordered chilli garlic chicken and pepper fish as starter, in maincourse mixed friedrice, meifoon and peking chicken. The bill was 1500 for us, we were 4 people. The service was superfast. And in my opinion this is the best restaurant in China Town along with Kim ling.

This is another legacy restaurant of Kolkata which will disappoint you if you are looking for authentic Chinese food.The typical style of Chinese it serves can be modestly described as "better quality street Chinese" that you get at cheaper prices everywhere in Kolkata including ¬†most other restaurants in Tangra itself.
I seriously feel this a place for non experimental Indian Chinese lovers who would usually like to stick to few specific dishes while eating out.The starters, main course comprises of dishes that you get at most other Chinese joints.
But if you visit Tangra (China Town) you are most likely to find Beijing having a substantial crowd compared to most others .This is primarily due to its strategic location at the mouth of Tangra lane, nice and spacious seating arrangements and both the floors having a suitable family ambiance.
I have visited the place several times and can vouch for the quality of food it serves.It has few desert options as well which you don't get at most other joints in Tangra.

One of the finest in tangra...though the price may seem to be a bit on the upper side ¬†for some people but it's completely worth the money....Nice place to go for even for drinks..
Coming to food,I usually prefer the Spring Chicken for starters,which is more like a signature dish of Tangra!!!The wantons are perfectly seasoned with the right amount of spices..For mains,I usually go for Manchurian or Kung Pao with fried rice
I have tried their prawns too and they are fresh and good...

Beijing... Honestly I loved the place... Food is good, service is quick and easy. The best part is you don't need to care about parking your car. They take care of it. I love Chinese food and simply can't take it if its not prepared properly. But Beijing has a very elaborate menu and the food tested really good. The menu has one advantage that it comes up with the option of full/ half plate servings. Not too pricy. The stuff is very attentive and well behaved. So thumbs up.

Beijing is what a Bong wants off a Chinese Restaurant. That being said, Beijing is some sister concern of Kim Ling and the menu is nearly same at both places and the food's almost identical. I have been to Kim Ling more often than Beijing. 

It's a legendary restaurant, I don't need to stop to say that the food here is good. I love their Crispy Fried Fish and Manchurian Prawn. The prawns are always unfailingly well cooked. 

Service is more or less quick and the waiters are courteous and helpful. 

It's always been for us a good old faithful place for family eat-outs with far too many happy memories. :)

Tangra or Chinatown comes with a plethora of options for dining in. But Beijing has stood its ground for its taste of 'Indian' Chinese, over the years.

You can order the usual chinese fare starting from their soups (sweet corn or manchow) to the starters (prawn crackers, crispy fish etc. ) If you are lucky, you can get through to their Duck menu, else you always have Kung Pao or Shanghai chicken to fall back on. The mixed Cantonese rice goes well with all this. The booze is also priced competitively, should you want to down a peg or two.

I have been to this joint for enormous times and this review is a summation of all the visits. This joint in located in Tangra and is a famous for its Chinese food. The ambiance is not than great,  the upper seating area gets opened only after the lower part is completely filled. However my personal preference being the ground floor seating area.

I love the Mixed thai this is one of the best thai soup one can get in Kolkata. Apart from that, crispy fish golden friend prawns are also great.

Hakka noodles, friend rice, chilli chicken, pepper chicken are also nice. 

Tip: 

1. Don't order beer here, you need to believe your eyes when you see the bill for a beer

2. For soups, don't ask them to make it 1 by 2 or half then 1 by 2 rather ask for full bowl or half bowl according to your requirement. The justification to this will be there in your bill if you have tried the above before.

Their staffs r swift and courtsios. Foods are authentic and yummy. Very soothing ambience. Ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken then chilli garlic pepper fish, then ordered green pepper chicken dry, some Black forest ice cream and had few pegs of whisky. My friend ordered some chicken mushroom soup. Moderately priced. Great food and hospitality. Looking forward to visit there from now onwards at least once in a month. I remember in 2005 I had hosted my 20th birthday party there........ I love their shanghai chicken dry,chilli garlic pepper chicken,green pepper fish/chicken.

I will classify Beijing as one of the 'New Tangra' eateries.It was not there when I used to visit Tangra in the eighties or early nineties.
If one airlifts the Beijing restaurant to say,Park Street,the decor and ambience would fit in.What I mean is there is little of authentic Tangra simplicity here including the predominance of the colour red which is rarely seen here.
We ate a lot.Golden fried prawn,non veg spring rolls,mixed hot pot,mutton ribs,chilli chicken,Shanghai chicken,Cantonese gravy noodles.....All the food was good with the golden fried prawn and the sweet chilli sauce and the soup being outstanding.
But did the food reflect on the typical culinary traits that differentiated Tangra Chinese from the rest of the city?Other than the Chilli Chicken,sadly no.And that is the saddest part.

Visiting a Chinese restaurant in tangra was on my list for the longest in Kolkata. And finally managed to go there on the recommendation of a local colleague! I was told that Beijing would be a good choice though I came across several others in the same lane which also looked quite busy.

We had beer and ordered a chicken chilly along with sweet corn crab soup followed by American chopsuey the food was no surprises! I would not say it was different from a Chung fa in Pune or flora in Mumbai. The space is humongous and really dull and dated! Yet the quantities were great and prices reasonable. I found a lot of people entertaining large groups here. So if your looking for a gourmet Chinese experience in Kolkata neither  Beijing nor tangra may be your choice!

To start with, we were greeted warmly by the staff of Beijing. There were ample number of staff members eager to help us to our table. The service time was way shorter than the time taken to decide the menu. The food was top-notch in taste. The service of the staff was very amiable. The ambience was just what a good restaurant should have. When here, do try the Beijing special fried rice. The attached pic is of the same dish. Besides, chicken in hot garlic sauce is a very good option. And though the price on the menu looks to be on the higher side, but when you are going with a group, the food will be worth the money. No matter it is one of the best in China Town.

We had Chinese settlement in a few places in the city and Tangra is one of them where these Chinese owned and worked in the tanneries. Beijing was one of the starts in that district. Beijing is popular for finger licking Chinese in the heart of the China Town on this side of the great wall. Nothing new to say about the delicious Chinese they serve that will make you come back again and again.

Started with the legendary Beijing and wasn't disappointed. It was a simple soup and salad lunch but the Honey Chicken was so amazing that it has whetted my appetite for more. Want to try their gravy noodles next. Thank you Beijing for flagging off my Tangra journey so sweetly and memorably. (PS: The staff was super nice)

This place offers great personal experience and is perhaps the most legendary restaurant in Chinatown. There ambiance , the seatings and the way the staffs greet and treat the guests are truly praiseworthy.  The staffs go to great length to ensure you spend quality time with good food irrespective of your order size. Coming to the food they are ge best in rice items in the entire area however Namking has better offering for true Chinese cuisine lovers. The starters are as good as any other place in Chinatown but the quality of oil and spices they use is a notch higher than its peers in the area and they take a good care of hygiene.  Budget wise they are perhaps the costliest in Chinatown but their services justify every penny they charge.

Very bad experience. Firstly, we found a piece of hair in the plate of drums of heaven. The waiters were not well mannared. While taking the starter plates from us, they just said 'dekhi' and took the plates. Further, the dishes (mixed fried rice and GARLIC CHICKEN) were not so tasty and we did not smelled it or tasted it like garlic chicken. In spite of garlic chicken, I think, we were served sweet and sour chicken. Very bad experience from Beijing.

Food and ambiance --- average... Price is moderate...but my main concern is authenticity...this is not a pure Chinese restu...it's indo-Chinese..that means tastes are as usual converted into Indian context...you can have that type of food taste in any standard Chinese restaurant in proper kolkata...you need not go that odd place...The flavor of 'tangra' is missing...not recommend for going that odd area for indo-Chinese food..

One of those legendary restaurants in China Town where every single family from Kolkata has atleast visited once. Has been there for decades now. The interiors hasn't changed over the years. Still the same Chinese lights and simple tables. But the problem of clumsiness still exists. The tables are placed very close to each other and that can be very annoying. The quality of crowd has gone down a lot. But the food is still almost the same if not exactly like before. My personal favorite is ' Crab Claws'. But sadly this particular item is not available round the year. Another favourite item of mine is Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken. Do try their Drums of Heaven and their Cantonese Chowmein. If you are a fan of spicy items then try their Schezwan Fried Rice and Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce. Serving time is quick and they have ample waiters to serve you. But try to avoid this place on weekends due to too much rush as the waiting time can be 1 hour also.

Beijing is one of the best restaurants at Tangra. It is quite spacious with good seating arrangements allowing some privacy too unlike other restos over there where one table almost gets on top of another. Coming to the food, it was quite delicious, the starters were mouth melting. I tried the Blue Lagoon cocktail.....it was so good I simply had to go for another one. Since we went in the evening, the place was quite enough. The staff is quite vigilant and helpful as well. Pricing is also good, you get value for money. Would surely recommend this restaurant to people.

Picked up food from here last evening around 10. The place was completely packed so ordered a take away. The food was horrific, bland and tasteless and dripping in oil. Had seen rave reviews about this place on zomato and it also holds a 3.8 rating, that's why really wanted to try this place for a while but was gravely disappointed.

Beijing is that one restaurant that I have been to countless number of times.Yes its a legend of China Town.But my last visit was just okayish.Had crispy chicken,drums of heaven,mixed fried rice,gravy chowmein,chili chicken and a fish preparation.I felt the starters are too dry.However the main course was good enough with enough quantity for two.The service is good enough.The best dish was probably the mixed gravy chow!China Town is the ideal place for people looking to booze.For foodies?Not quite.

The best Chinese Restaurant in this city. There are several restaurants in China Town but among all, Beijing is the best. Several time we visited & when we get few time, we try to hop there. They prepare one dish, Chicken Cashew Nut, me & my husband both love that dish so very much. They also prepare very good duck dishes. My mom visited there only once, but she also like the place.

I will surely mention here like I do for all my reviews on restaurants in China Town.
When you think of pure and delicious Chinese cuisine, China Town is the only place you should think of visiting at that very moment. Beijing I believe is the best restaurant at China Town now. The food here is mouth-watering. The amount of the served dishes is enough for two people. I remember ordering mixed rice noodles, chousuey, garlic chicken for mail course and korean stick and prawn chips for appetizers along with sweet corn soup. The food was awesome and so were the politeness of the staff. Ambiance is posh and soothing here. Beautifully decorated place for a lovely Chinese lunch or dinner.

Beijing is indeed one of the better family restaurants in China Town area and recommended for first time goers since it is quite conveniently located at the start of Matheswartala Road towards the famous alley of China Town..They have the asme owner as Kim Ling situated in the same locality and their food taste almost similar..guess they have the same recipe..However based on my personal experience of visiting both Kim Ling and Beijing a number of times I would definitely Recommend Kim Ling over Beijing any day simply because the prices of all the items are a bit Higher at Beijing though the quality and quantity remains the same and they don't serve half portions of their starters..Also the service at Beijing is quite slow..last time we visit it took them almost 40mins to serve our starters!!The only aspect in which Beijing scores is their ambiance..If you want to dine in a better decorated place with your family to get a glimpse of fine dining experience definitely you can give this place a try..Some of the better dishes are their Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken, Golden Fried Prawn, Mutton Spare Ribs, Szechwan Fish Dry and their Rice Noodles preparations..One word of caution: this place is not ideal for cheap booze..alcohols are a bit highly priced and they don't serve alcohols in bottles..Also you may face parking issues on weekends..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 2.5/5
Service: 3/5

Beijing is hands down the best restaurant in china town.. My favourite here is the Tom yum soup. I bet no other place makes the soup the way they do, it's zingy, tangy and spicy. The chilli garlic pepper chicken is a must try and one of the most popular items here. Tried the crispy chicken it was good, it's strips of chicken with green chilli paste within, squeeze a lime over it n enjoy ur appetiser. For the main course my favourites r the chilli chicken, the Beijing special chilli chicken, chicken manchurian, Kung pao chicken.. I simply love the chicken Hakka noodles here.. The noodle is so smooth. The Cantonese noodles too is very good but I prefer the Hakka more. Not too found of the fried rice here as the rice quality is not too good n does not suit my palate. The fresh ground green chilli sauce here adds more flavour to the food..

Perhaps the expectations were quite high, after having heard a lot about Tangra's chinese.. We managed to reach this place, thanks to google maps.. Ordered Golden Fried prawns for starters and a chicken clear soup. Both of them were pretty good but on moving to the main course, we were a bit disappointed. Although the rice and noodles seemed decent, the garlic fish lacked that authentic chinese taste. Judging neutrally the place is good enough, however it becomes difficult to keep this in overall top5 Chinese joints, once you start to compare.

This is one of the most popular and well known places in the Chinese lovers paradise lane, the china town. Located just at the mouth of the street, its a place with decent sitting arrangements and parking facility. We went for a casual lunch and started with chicken thai soup. We ordered one full to make it 1/2. The waiter suggested us to take half and make it 1/2..... Wen it was served, i was shocked to find two bowl full of soup!! Too generous in quantity. The soup tasted good, the coriander flavour is something i love in dat. In maincourse we ordered a mix gravy noodles with chicken in green pepper (dry). Both were damn tasty. Ds chicken also, we ordered half plate which has 6-7 pieces in it!! In an all the food experience was highly satisfying.

Apart from the fact that this place servers mind boggling chinese food at reasonable prices; the ambience of the place makes it even better.

Some of the dishes that are a must trytry are
Kung pao chicken, cantonese chicken, chicken Szechwan meifoon, duck Szechuan, crispy chicken.

But the only fact that there is a real dearth of parking space an great delay in service that prompted me from giving 4 stars.

Beijing has always been a favorite of mine. Be fore this, I had been there thrice and everytime has been a delight. This time was also no different. I went there with my office colleagues on a Sunday for lunch.Despite the crowd on a Sunday,I feel the service was okay.

We had ordered a plate chicken meat balls for statrers with Orange Tango as the drink. It was very tasty.

For the main dish, we ordered Black Pepper Chicken and Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce along with egg chow and egg fried rice.The best part of Beijing is always its quantity.It is really money for value.The Black Pepper Chicken was very good and spicy. Overall, a great outing and look forward to visit it again.

I know I know, when it comes to Chinese especially from china town, Kolkata this is the place to be! 
But seems like quite unfortunately the place has gone to the dogs for the time being. Staff roams around like a bunch of clueless buffoons!! 
We ordered a couple of starters like prawn crackers and fried chicken wontons which were excellent! 
We also placed an order for an aerated drink, which was not served even though we repeatedly asked for one. 
When the waiter realised that we have asked for the cold drink thrice someone came walking over to our table quite lazily and placed a thumbs up with the cap on,no glasses no straw no bottle opener mind you!! 
Then after a couple of minutes someone came over with a bottle opener, after that someone else with a glass!! After asking for a chilli garlic sauce repeatedly for over 10 minutes ( by the time starters were almost over ) another clueless waiter walked lazily to our table! We were exasperated by then and told them off for their awful service! The service improved temporarily because of this for some time! 
The chicken mushroom soups arrived swiftly which were nice & hot and then again we had to wait for quite sometime for the main course. 
Chicken Cantonese chowmein & garlic chicken were good and quantity wise quite filling! 
I would personally request the management to look into this  matter and train their staff properly, they are downright anything but  irritating!!

I have started my Chinese cravings with this restaurant. Beijing is one of the best family restaurant in tangra. It is dimly lit with constant bustling sound of ppl talking. The waiting time is a bit long here but the waiters are very polite. I love most of their soups and momo. I personally feel that u get the best momo here. I have never experimented with the menu here and have always stuck to basic noodles or rice and a chicken side dish. I love the taste of the food here and the quantity they give is quite a lot.

China Town in Kolkata is a well known place for all the food lovers and Beijing is a landmark restaurant there. I went on a weekend and there was a queue for tables. If i am not wrong this place is always crowded. Due to paucity of time i opted for parcel.

I had ordered garlic pepper fried chicken half plate and it was delicious but very dry. More like a snack and if you have more than 2 people then go for a full plate.

Next i had their chilly chicken which was average. Considering the hype about this place i thought the food was indeed tasty but not anything out of the world.

Their beijing haaka noodles and beijing spl fried rice was indeed very tasty. When it comes to chinese i always opt for their fried rice and the one served here was worth every penny.

Now coming to ambiance i would say it had typical Chinese decor, dim lights et al but cannot be considered a top notch fine dining place. There were sofa arrangements on one end and normal seating arrangements on the other. But overall a good place to dine at.

Price wise i would say the place is expensive but they give you the option to go for full plate or half.¬†

Staffs are courteous but overtly occupied due to its crowd and because of that the service is pretty slow. Even to get the bill they took more than 10 minutes. I think they need more hands.

The most famous name in tangra. But disappointed me the last two times I went there. Typical Indian Chinese is what they serve but quality of food is below the standard of any other well known restaurant in tangra or in the city. It is the time for them to concentrate on the quality and taste rather than continue leveraging their already gained brand value which would definitely fade out with time slowly in this new era of competitive market.

It's one of the first restaurants you will encounter when you enter the tangra hotel alleys from the front side.  

It  serves a real good spread of Chinese dishes... A always try the spicier items and the drum sticks... 

Two things you should be concerned about.... 1.. It is always crowded... And weekend empty tables are a rarity.... And then there is the parking... The establishment doors not have their own parking space which is a bummer... It's quite a chaos at times in the Weekend

Beijing is always associated with Tangra so much so that it has become a landmark/reference point of this part of town. I have had their food for around ten years or more. My loyalty to this place is like, if I am in Tangra, to dine, its very difficult to convince me to eat at any other joint here.¬†

Ambience:
Suitable for both family sit down or a rendezvous with friends. A very typical ¬†oriental setup with minimalistic d√©cor. A quick warning this place is really noisy on a busy day so you have to bear that before drawing any conclusions.

Food:
I have had a lot of stuff here but would only name the ones that i have found the best.

Pepper Chicken dry: Tastes really good and an absolute must have. It particularly goes very well with Beer, providing you are having one.

Lemon Chicken: This is a bit sweet and tangy so obviously caters to only selected palate.¬†

Golden Fried Prawns: You can try this if you like batter fried prawns.¬†

Chilly Chicken Dry: This comes with loads of fried green chillies and tastes wonderful with Hakka noodles. One cannot miss a kolkata Chinese food without chilli chicken. Its actually the heart of all Bong Chinese food lovers.

Mixed Fried rice and Hakka Noodles is something that you have to order with any Tangra Chinese food as thats the centre piece and all other dishes are actually accompaniments. Its funny but face it we love it that ways.¬†

Price: Average priced place with absolutely no compromise on quantity.

Final Verdict: The 1.5 points deducted is due to the fact that this establishment has off late deteriorated in terms of taste. I can't be hypocritical deducting more points as every establishment has its ups and downs. I think this place can revive, if it puts effort and focuses on the fundamental principle of taste and taste alone. Till then, Best of Luck!

Been here just today. As usual typical awesomeness of kolkata china town. 

We ordered Chicken Mushroom soup which is superb. You must order 1/2 as the full portion is huge in quantity. 

Then in starter we ordered Chicken Spring fry I never tasted something like this.  The chicken was superbly cooked and soft. 

In main course I ordered Chicken Cantonese Rice which is a rice recipe in white gravy. Superb. 

Overall, awesome experience with a few cocktails. 

Super value for money. Loved it.

I have been to Beijing like 4 times now. The restaurant is good for sure. Ordered duck gravy, green pepper fish with mushroom and chicken starters. The fish was not good. The other items were good. Ambiance wise they have not changed much over the years. I think the serving guys can work on their presentation skills. Food waiting time was pretty less but it was almost empty on a Saturday afternoon. I think Beijing needs to ramp up a bit in everything to stay in the competition.

The famous china town of kolkata holds ground to some of the best chinese restaurants in the country, so i had heard and china town also known as Tangra is home to Beijing, one of the most recommended restaurants there. And as suggested by everyone, they were definitely worth the visit. One cannot describe everything around here and you must visit this place to experience it. The orders placed take barely 10 mins to get to your table (yes! its that fast) and every dish of theirs will just keep you gripped. The mix of flavors and the prawns papad i guess is something you cannot miss out on. Well another thing, there is some spicy green chutney served, oh that is the best . it sure is spicy, had me chugging a few drinks down to kill the spice. Cheers guys!

My first visit to a China Town, started with Beijing. Went recently in 2015. It is an indo-chinese restaurant. Not a luxurious but homely ambiance. There was vallet service.¬†
We didnt have to wait for our food for long.¬†
The starters were hot to serve, and was extremely delicious. The prawns were fresh and the chicken was tender.¬†
The noodles were OK.¬†
This is heaven for an indo-chinese food lover.¬†
The price ¬†could have been a bit on the lower side. However, the quantity per plate was good.

Just when you enter china town, you hit to this place. It's not a very out of the world or a fine dining place but when you enter you feel transferred to chine for a bit. The menu is filled with non-vegs only until you turn to the last page to see a few vegetarian options. This place bustles with a huge local population that savors the Chinese taste that we have grown up eating and not the authentic food served in most of the fine dining restaurants in the city. It's not a place that makes you feel happy but you wouldn't mind eating here for a change. The starter I ordered wasn't there at 7.30 in the evening with half the restaurant empty. The people around were indecent and weird. Maybe it's just a wrong day for me, try your luck for the crowd. Don't want to comment about the food much since it's not typically a place for vegetarians..

A visit to the hometown after 19 years meant dining at a place that was special and Chinese in Kolkata seemed to be synonymous with Beijing. The place is done up in '80s interiors and is run by Chinese.

We ordered for a Chicken with green pepper, fish in hot garlic sauce, veggie wontons, ¬†spring potato, a veg hakka chow and a mixed meat fried rice. All this for 2 people !

The chicken was supreme, pretty close to what I had in mind while choosing the place - authentic Hakka Chinese -the home of chicken Manchurian.¬†

The fish was kind of a let down after the chicken. The fried rice was sumptuous and total VFM. The veg starters were also very good. The chow was again some of the best noodles we've had.

I noticed a pricing disparity between ¬†the starters and the mains. Food except for the mains doesn't come cheap but taste is something which is non compromisable here.¬†

Beijing lived up to its billing and Tangra is a must on the next visit to the City of Joy :)

Cashew nuts chicken is my personal favourite
But you need to be in time for a nice dinner. If you are here by 9 you will enjoy your food hot and tasty or else they are tired to serve you once it clocks 10

This visit was not recent but few weeks back when took my entire extended family of 12 adults to the most legendary establishment in Tangra. Parking is always a concern here but at Beijing it was not a issue at all. They have valet parking option. 

The restaurant‚Äôs usp is its grandeur and strategic location among its closest competitors. We had their center long table reserved for the big gang. Don‚Äôt expect waiters to be smart and fluent in English but rather they are old school. I didn‚Äôt find them rude but on slower side. As most visit Tangra because of low price of booze hence sometimes crowd tends to be noisy and out of place. As a boon Beijing being little towards higher side price wise hence some filtration is in place.

In starters we ordered for Prawn Crackers, Drums of Heaven, Golden Prawn and Kung Pao Chicken. Always crackers the most favourite among the group with cold drinks. Its prawn mixed with tapioca flour and sundried before deep frying. Drums of Heaven is glorified name of Chicken Lollipop but spicy. Golden Prawns are fresh and succulent king prawns covered with light golden batter. Kung Pao Chicken is diced dry chicken tossed with bell peppers and cashew nuts. Unfortunately crab was not available for the day which dampened our spirit a bit. Restaurant should ensure availability of their signature dishes which helped them to become a legend. We didn't order any booze as except me rest of the group is teetotaler.

Before entering main course we had Hot and Sour Chicken Soup which was average. In main course we ordered Chili Garlic Chicken, Lemon Fish, Sanghai Chicken and Schezwan Chicken. All of them are match winners for ages but I still give special mention for Lemon Fish which had uniqueness in its taste. Along with also ordered Mixed Hakka Chowmein and Mixed Fried Rice.

Desserts are must after such extravagant dinner but unfortunately it‚Äôs next to impossible to get good desserts at Tangra other than darshaan or brownie or clich√© tutti frutti. We settled for Choco Brownie. Would not rate much for this as it was brownie bought from local bakery served on table topped with ice cream scoops. 

Bill was around INR 5500 without alcohol is on higher side compared to Tangra standard. Service was slow and servers are absent minded. Have to chase them to get a job done.

The birthplace of Indo-Chinese!!! We went there on a sunday evening!! It was almost empty. We ordered wanton soup , drums of heaven, beijing special mixed rice noodles, Schezwan fish, shanghai fish and kung pao chicken.. The soup was amazing!! The starters was a bit too hard and the batter contained tiny bits of stones.. But the rice noodles made up for it. It was full of egg, chicken, mutton , prawns and mushroom. The quantity was enough for two people. The noodles were made perfectly. We ordered half plates of both the side dishes and felt that the quantity was sufficient. Schezwan fish was soft and yummy , but a bit on the tangy side. The shanghai fish was a bit spicy but delicious. Kung Pao Chicken was brilliiant!! The service was fantastic. Value for money. Highly Recommended.

Beijing is the bigger brother of Kim Ling and is more visible owing to the unique large space it occupies right when you enter Tangra. Valet parking spaces are available on request. 

The food is quite great and is also inexpensive.

When the brother comes to town, treats are inevitable. This is one kind of happiness which can be fathomed only by those who are blessed with an elder sibling (preferably a working one!). Having little taste for fancy new restaurants, this man only swears by the classic ones which have existed for ages. That is partly how we ended up in Beijing for our very first lunch of the year. Located in the little China Town of Kolkata which embodies most of the city‚Äôs Chinese milieu, this two floored restaurant is quite spacious and clean. 

Our orders were simple and consisted of the good old Chicken Sweet Corn Soup followed by Chili Garlic Pepper fried chicken (dry), Mixed Hakka chow, Cantonese mixed rice and Szechwan chicken with gravy. The sweet corn soup was perfectly done with a well-seasoned partly clear broth, ample amount of sweet corns and nicely boiled chicken strips. It tasted like HEAVEN. After a much needed gap, another delectable appetizer was served. Chili garlic: the two words are capable enough to stir up the world in me. This blended in with fried chicken and pepper was total awesomeness.  One can just keep craving for more. The mixed Hakka chow had a mild flavor with generous portions of chicken, prawn, egg and vegetables. The Cantonese rice wasn‚Äôt something we‚Äôd usually order for, but brought a nice change to our palate nonetheless. There was rice, egg, chicken and vegetables (mostly spinach) submerged in a thick broth like gravy which tasted bang on when mixed with a bit of the spicy Szechwan gravy. 

The quality and quantity deserve full points. Prices are extremely affordable when you‚Äôre in a big group. Even their service is quite prompt. On a cold winter afternoon, nothing could be better than this heart-warming Chinese meal.

The waiter seemed uninterested in suggesting us any dish.We were enthusiastic to eat duck and crab,but alas,he said-the duck wont be nice and crabs are not available.He went away during taking the order and was having a heated discussion with his colleagues.

Verdict-It has quite a name in China town,so dont give it a miss.

Good place to eat Kolkata style Chinese food.

We ordered a lot of stuff.¬†

Pineapple blossom (Mocktail) - Thick pineapple based milk shake, perfectly sweet to my taste.

Sweet and Sour Prawn - Was the bit too sweet to my taste. Sour part missing. The prawns were big, fresh and soft.

Mixed Rice and Mixed Hakka Chow are good. They can be eaten with any sides.

¬†Peking checking was good, in black bean sauce, medium spicy.

Wonton (Fried crispy dumpling) was a bit disappointing. They were prepared well but unfortunately i don't like the fried oily taste.

Chicken baby corn and button mushroom was a bit of a unexpected surprise. It had watery translucent gravy with huge mushrooms, lots of corn and small chicken pieces. We initially though it would be tasteless. However it turned to be good. Lots of healthy vegetables and soft chicken. (Disclaimer: Not for people who prefer spicy food)

Overall almost all the dishes were good. Food was moderate to low spicy. Items marked sweet are really sweet. May be it is a bit of Bengali influence.

I went to Beijing at Tangra with family for a relaxing and sumptuous Sunday lunch. Reached the place just before rush hours, so got a private space. D√©cor and other restaurant items are very much same in all Tangra eateries.
As I prefer traditional 3 course meal, we started with chicken creamy mushroom soup. It was very tasty. When ever I went to Tangra, I always order prawn wafers. I simply love this combination.
Next, in the main course, we took special Beijing mixed fried rice & meefoon. It was full with chicken, prawn, mutton, mushroom & eggs as if in each bite you will have a mouthful of them. In side dish, we had chilly garlic fish & pepper fry chicken. Fish item was fine n tasty. But felt like pepper chicken was missing some marination or spices. But, overall main course was nice.
At the end I fulfilled my desire with walnut caramel ice-cream.
Now the price - all these with Rs 500 for each including tax.
So far I have visited around 5 top restaurants in Tangra with highest Zomato ratings, I found price was they are almost same, but in terms of value for money, I would rate Beijing as the best.

This is perhaps the most well known Indo-Chinese restaurant in Tangra. I have been there on countless occasions. Its difficult to keep up with the bevy of Indo-Chinese restaurants that keep cropping up in the city, yet this place kind of holds its own. The Crispy Chicken found here is second to none. Even better than the ones we find at Tung Fong. Another of my favorites here is the Sichuan Duck coupled with the delectable fried rice. There goes the savoury items which of course it is famous for. My only gripe would be the lack of quality desserts. The city has a sweet tooth and desserts are evolving. Overall each visit here is going to provide a wonderful experience and you will find yourself recommending the place to friends and family. Cheers everyone. Happy dining.

China Town boasts of some of the most fine Chinese cuisines and dishes available in the City of Joy. If you are in the mood for some brilliant Chinese food without making your pocket much light, then Beijing is your ultimate destination.

Key Features:

1. Mixed Noodles: This is the first dish you should order for your main course. I would recommend Noodles over Rice for Beijing, in spite of being a rice lover myself, for the sole reason of quality. Rice-noodles can be another choice you might want to check out if you are looking for something different. 

2. Prawn: Although the price might be a tad too heavy as compared to chicken and fish, but the large variety of prawn dishes as well as the aroma, not to forget the taste, makes the food even more enjoyable.

3. Price: The dishes are pretty much affordable as compared to any other decent restaurant of Kolkata. 

Other Ratings:

1. Quality: 4/5

2. Quantity: 4/5

4. Ambience: 3/5

5. Variety: 3.5/5

6. Price: 4/5

7. Availability: 4/5

I was introduced to China town by a very dear friend. Beijing was the first choice and now after eating there multiple times I can confidently say that its the heart of China town. It has beautiful and bright ambiance. My favorite combination of red and white table cloths and hanging lanterns which you find in most of the Chinese restaurants. Food quality is very very good. Its delicate and fresh. ¬†I love the garlic chicken and hakka noodles here. Prawns are very soft. food is extremely tasty. I won't say this place is economical. For college students its not. But if you want to have Chinese its better if you come here rather go to Mainland China.

My first tryst with the awesomeness that is Chinatown. Beijing stands first among a line of eateries in this locality, and welcomes you with gleaming eyes. One of the costlier options of the area, this place is sure to win your heart. 

The decor is done up with traditional Chinese motifs. Frankly, on any crowded day, one would pay least attention to the surroundings and gorge on the delicacies. The dishes are tasty and fulsome; the drinks on offer are tantalizing. In fact, once you manage to get a table, you'll realize that the wait had been worthwhile. 

I have been to Chinatown quite a few times and dined in many of the available options, and its safe to say that Beijing is my favorite.

Checked into this place on the Diwali night for a happy meal with my family. Tangra was deserted and thus we didn't found much crowd at this place either. We ordered our food and they served it within minutes. It was sooooper faaast !! And to be honest the food was served hot and at it's best. Loved the food. Loved the ambience of the place. And the best thing about this place is their table arrangements, you'd scarcely notice restaurants arranging their tables diagonally. Spent a wonderful evening and thus a twinkling 5 star rating from my side! :)

I was about to review this restaurant. Then I read some of the reviews given by others. Some of the reviews are exactly what I wanted to say. 

Yes, this place was absolutely awesome few years ago. But of late food quality has degraded a lot. Quantity-wise it is ok but it is the quality that sucks. Sorry for my language. Duck Schezwan is worst I have ever had. I have tried lot of dishes her and have been disappointed by most of them. Ambiance is average and service is also prompt. Do not visit on festive days, specially durga puja as they serve poor quality food because of the crowd. 

Parking on weekends and festive days is a problem.

Ok I just added this restaurant to my "Never ever to Visit" List. The restaurant is , rather was, very well known and acclaimed highly among the foodies of Kolkata. So I went in with a friend of mine today. I have to admit that I have never ever tasted as vile a chowmien as they fed us today. I was taken aback by the bowl of tasteless saltless wormy thing they had put infront of us. Add to it, the utterly unbearable deepfried crumbling baby corn (the corns looked like the daddy of baby corns!) The entire experience was marred by another thai soup which was not even close to being a soup.
Overall I wont ever dare to make another visit to this place. And its overly expensive too. 627 INR for thai(or whatever soup) a bowl of noodles(or whatever) and baby(daddy corn) fries. Unbearable.#Swansong

P.S. Zomato should now introduce negative rating.

we have ordered beijing special hakka noodles which was good but quantity was not enough.
red garlic chicken was average..
lastly to satisfy the tastebuds we ordered lemon chicken & it was really awesome.. i luvd it..
now come to the point of hospitality... it was just pathetic. :(

Well , visiting to China town has reduced now--but during college days this was a place of re-union and parties. And this is 1 restaurant where we have been several times.In a nutshell- my suggestion would be get yourself a bottle of liquor of your brand and drink with your mates--trust me even if you behave a bit crazy, staffs will warmly help you out. They are well-mannered and very prompt.Coming to starters--taste some of there spicy dishes with sip of your liquor--you will definitely enjoy them.For main dishes¬†I would not recommend Hakka noodles , the taste seem to be more in other surrounding places.Moderate price for every item and remember to order liquor bottles instead of pegs whenever you visit here.

Nice ambience n service makes Beijing a "must visit" restaurant in Tangra. On top of that when you get lip-smacking starters in front of you, you have no other choice apart from concentrating on to them. Only thing is many of the dishes (Duck, Crab) may not be available depending upon the time. Else its a complete "thumbs up"..

Beijing and big boss are two restaurants in china towns we visited frequently during my internship days...be it a unit get together or a birthday treat..good Chinese and cheap booze had always been a priority and china town fulfils both...well Beijing is the most well known restaurant in china town serving a blend of indianised Chinese cuisine...a bit spicy a bit oily...to satisfy Indian taste buds...but the important point is the taste is not compromised...the decor is nice, service prompt, staff are courteous cz they never kicked us out despite the madness we used to have after gulping down few pegs...:-P 
well food is good...all the well known Chinese dishes are cooked very delicately...their Thai chicken and drums of heaven are awesome...price is moderate...overall a pleasant experience every time i visited this place...

My college friends n I decided to visit the place at around 4pm. We were hell hungry. This was my 1st trip to Beijing.
A cosy and comfortable place with friendly waiters. Nothing to talk about the decor.
There were 13 of us, and we had ordered loads of food. From mixed chow, rice, hot garlic ch, sanghai ch, schezwan ch, chilli paneer etc..
Food was soo tasty and came in large quantities. Finally we ordered beer, breezer for the ladies n tooti frooti ice cream. The bill was around 5600 which was slightly on the higher side but well justified for the grand treat we had.
I give it a huge thumbs up, a great place to hang out wth family n friends.

Ambience is good...went with few of my friends...quantity of food they serve is adequate or rather more than adeqauate...budget place not much costly...

Heard about from zomato only. Seems nice in a bit of difficult locality....wonton soup is okay and noodles decent. Can come out with a company as it predominantly seems to be harbouring families. Prices okay as per the menu. Servers are a bit experienced(if i can use that for age), so obviously pay attention to tippers.....ambience okay for a 300-500per person budget.

Beijing is what I consider the only family dine in place in China Town. The food there is very good and the quantity of food you get for the money you spend is really mindblowing. The ambience is pretty nice and the service is good too. So if you have a large group and want to cut down on costs but still have some nice Chinese, Beijing is the place.

Want to have Chinese? Huge group? Wanna have fun! Go visit Beijing. I don't need to say anything more. The name is enough.

P.S. Try their rooftop version someday(opens only during Chinese new year I guess). I visited that place just once. Pure bliss. :)

Used to go here a lot during my student days and recently re-visited and its still the same. Decor unchanged, some of the staff still unchanged and most importantly the quality of food is still fantastic.

Drums of heaven- 5 star
Fried Mushrooms- 5star
Prawn Crackers-5star

Pepper fried Chicken- 4 star ( little more spice would have gotten it 5)
Fish in Garlic Sauce- 5 star
Beijing Special Hakka Chow-5 star

Overall all a grt dining experience and pocket friendly too, good service staff, a little crowded but hey when that's only testament to how good they are.

Visited on navami night..n the experience was "Do not go there again"..
The starters (drumsticks, spring fried fish, prawn chips) were delicious no doubt..but the main course was a total disaster..the Beijing special fried rice was yaak! Prawn fried rice was below average..
Chicken munchurian, n other side dishes tasted like any other road-side dhaba serving Chinese..
The person attending our table was extremely rude and nonchalant of our complains regarding delay in service..
Food quality could be down due to pujo-rush, dts acceptable..but even in the rush, the staff was gossiping around n 'chilling' without bothering about our orders.
In short, all of us (13 people) were disappointed and certainly not coming back.

Of the numerous Tangra restaurants, this is my favourite. It is probably the oldest and best in China Town in terms of the quality of food they serve and the ambience (the price is quite high which makes it less crowded and less noisy). The food is superb...can't name just a few. The prawns they serve are wonderful in taste and size as well. I completely love the way the fried rice looks here, it's completely white ( unlike other places where they use extra soya sauce to make it spicy ) The chicken starters are delicious. They have a very special kind of green chilli sauce, which is rare to find anywhere else.¬†Make sure you go there and find out yourself. Trust me it will be one of your best gastronomic decisions. :)

DISAPPOINTED!!
I visited the restaurant on sunday, the 5th october. Service, food quality & environment was nightmarish. The better restaurant for chinese in kolkata has become lower than mediocre. I think it is high time the kolkatans seek much more respectable options to satiate their appetite for chinese food.

Went to Beijing after 2 years yesterday. I am highly disappointed with the service & attitude of the waiters! Very argumentative and impatient! We ordered for sweet corn chicken soup, the waiter came back and argued we ordered for hot & sour soup. And with such arrogance! They pushed a larger serving of soup to us and the waiter did not bother to serve us the main courses. We served ourselves, not a problem. Just while we were leaving, he made sure he stood around for the tip!
Overall spoiled the experience for us. Prices have gone up drastically, without any improvement in the quality and taste! Got an overall feeling they started taking their popularity & legacy for granted. Hopefully I'm not going back there. Ever.

It is the costliest and one of the largest Tangra restaurants. Very good food and because of the price the daily noise making crowd of Tanga dont venture here much. But there are plenty of food lovers in calcutta to fill up this place every day. No single dish can be singled out. Keep revisiting and try out all the dishes in a life time!

Beijing - one of the best, oldest and authentic chinese cuisine in kolkata, probably the best one in china town. from the tangra main road come inside china town, beijing is just at the front left. they have car parking facility in front. their ambience is quite good, rather a bit traditional. among the stuffs you will find many chinese indivisuals (it's quite common in restaurants at china towns).  their behaviour is quite good. i have called a person atleast 8-10 times for some quiries and everytime he attended our table without any agitation. their service is also prompt. 

now regarding food, i tried drums of heaven in starter along with mixed fried rice and hot garlic fish in main course. the starter was very good. their chicken drumsticks are directly fried, they don't dip them in any sauce preparations. hence, it was crispy and tasty enough.  there were 10 pieces in a plate, so nothing to complain about the quantity. the mixed rice was fine, but the quantity is quite less. 1.5 plate of that would be sufficient for a standard foodie. also in that, the chawl is not too thin.  in the side dish, they have full/half both choices available. we took the full, having 10 pieces. the preparation was good, but i expected a bit more spice in that. in general, they do not peovide too much spice in spicy preparations even. coming to the price, i should say that it's standard. the quality and quantity they provide, it is not over-priced from that aspect.

so, as a whole i can highly recommend that place to everyone and can assure that you won't be disappointed...

This is my first time in kolkata during Durga Pooja and my friend suggested we go to Beijing for dinner before going pandal hopping for the night. And boy I was glad I did! We ordered chicken pepper fry, chilli fish and chicken clear soup for starters along with prawn papads. The fish was yummy and done correctly with the right amount of seasoning! The chicken was good but slightly tough in both the starters and the soup. For mains we ordered mixed chilli garlic chow which was pretty epic along with fish in black pepper sauce. What was really noticeable was the quantity for that price. Everything was very reasonably priced. There are many restaurants in that lane but Beijing definitely stands out.

Well after a long long time today I visited Beijing, after almost 8-9 years but I've to admit they maintain the same quality. The ambiance is good(I think the best in China Town). At the first look the price per plate is little bit high with respect to the other restaurants but the quantity per plate was huge(much more than the others). We ordered 2 mixed Cantonese rice noodles, half Szechwan chicken, half Beijing special chilli chicken and soft drinks and our bill was around 1050 bucks. And the food was for 3 hungry lads. Though we planed to visit Kim fa but it was closed from 2:30 to 6:10 pm so we went to Beijing but it didn't disappoint us. I can say it is one of the best restaurant in China town if not the best....

The menu had a rich number of options to choose from and a quite a wide variety of alcohol. The food was absolutely delicious.
We ordered prawn crackers, egg drop soup, peeking duck, and kung pao chicken . 

The place isn't too costly nor too economic. Would definitely visit again this puja

What suddenly happened to their food standards? Shockingly, they are serving very less quantity food. I have been coming here since I was a kid. They were the best. I want to come back here again and again. My family has been in love with this restaurant for many years now. Our favourite dish has been boiled chicken with baby corn & mushrooms. Ambience is good. Quality of the food is very good. Waiters are attentive. QUANTITY SHOULD BE KEPT IN CHECK.

Beijing is one of the best restaurants in Tangra or China Town area. Beijing is more of a high class restaurant in this area which has a variety of restaurants spread over. The taste of the barbecue chicken which i tried years ago still lingers. The chilly tofu was also yummy and made veg chinese food taste delicious. The drinks are a bit expensive compared to other restaurants in the area. Weekends are full house here so you have to ensure you enter early to avoid long waiting. A perfect place for a family gathering with an averagely done up interior.

They were hosting a Chinese wedding reception here the day we went and it seems like they had a few Teochew specialities on that menu like fish ball soup - when we asked for it, we were told that they didn't have it in the regular menu. No worries - surely we'd find some Cantonese specialities on the menu. Too bad that's not necessarily the case - ¬†no steamed fish with ginger and scallion, no Cantonese roast duck, no claypot chicken, no jouk - this place has the most bog standard Indian Chinese menu you can imagine.¬†

So that's what we ended up ordering - some sweet and sour fish or something, some kung pao chicken (may Sichuanese food gods forgive me) and some wontons. Not bad if that's what you're looking for. But why go all the way to Tangra for this?

Folks, if you are in the area think and be no where else other than Beijing. The balance this place maintain with the taste of its servings and the price.. unbeatable. Enough alcohol choices to get you sloshed and ample menu to let you attain nirvana. Golden fried prawns, Heineken and 180 ml single malt, thats the nirvana I am indicating. Must visit.
Staff: pro
Food: hot and spicy, rich taste.
Ambiance: good. Almost China.

Though there are numerous Chinese restaurants in and around tangra, this is by far the best. I have observed lot of people saying it as expensive... But. Living in Bangalore it doesn't even pinch my pocket. Well, even if the restaurant is expensive, I really enjoy the food, Ambience and the service. Of all the dishes available, my favorite is golden.fried prawns and malaysian noodles. 
Ps- book a place before you go. Otherwise you might have to wait for long.

Beijing restaurant as we all know is a renowned place in tangra. The ambience is good. The food is fabulous especially the Beijing special items in the menu. A must try is Beijing special hakka chicken & chicken in dark pepper sauce. Regarding pricing,  it doesn't burns a hole in your pocket. As almost every restaurant in tangra offers full(14pcs)/half plate(7pcs). The only downside of this place was it's self righteous staff who are most of the time clueless. Overall verdict-  "good place, best food & decent pricing."

Probably the best and the most expensive restaurant in the China Town locality of Kolkata.
I remember being here a very long time back,but the food was something that really made me return to this place time and again.
If you're planning to hop into Beijing make sure you are there with your best of friends and you're not planning to get clean bowled when it comes to the pocket.
Ambience wise it is really good and very much in contrast to the putrid smell of the locality.Just that it gets over crowded on weekends.
Mein foon, Schezuwan chicken, Chinese chilli chicken boneless and dry are the dishes I would go for along with a few pegs of 100 Pipers.
Otherwise one can simply settle for a few snacks which are very sumptuous here.Try out the Fried Wontons and Chicken steamed Momo for an evening.
The desserts are very limited here.I would rather settle for a few mocktails in this place,instead.
Now being such an old restaurant one would really expect to come up with new preparations in Chinese, paying more attention to the desserts. All in all Beijing is a good hit on a Sunday but it is really time for the owners to make it big and come at par with the other leading Chinese food outlets in town.

I never tend to find anything negative about this place apart from its distant location from my place. Yes, I am kind of biased. In this entire phase of transition from me being a regular visitor to a occasional one today, Beijeing quite successfully lives up to its standard. Its 'golden fried prawns' being an all time favorite is a must irrespective of the cuisine I am up for every time¬†
I fall in love yet again with its crispy crunchy bite with the perfect blend of spice and the refreshing taste that really gives one the feeling of having tasted something really tasty. Apart from the food, I personally feel that it the smiling faces of the people happily @ service which takes the entire experience to a higher level all together - atleast for me it does!. So guyz! Keep It Up!

They have seating capacity in 1st floor also which they mainly use during the Pujo rush.. Coming to the most important aspect, the FOOD!! I just love their Drums of Heaven, Golden Fried Prawns and Dry chili crab/prawn/chicken... These 3 dishes are MUST as no one can even think of beating them in making these 3 dishes better. You can choose any one of the soups to go well with these starters. The Hakka noodles is one of the best in town.. The American Chopsuey is good too.. I am not a big fan of their main course gravy items but all are reasonable good.. I just go there for their Killer starters.. Amazing place .. a MUST try

For the main course we went for the mixed fried rice which has a good quantity of prawns, chicken etc in it. The szechuan lamb is perfect and just the way it shuld be. They serve alcohol as well and its moderately priced. Just be prepared to wait if u opt to visit on a weekend.

Beijing was an authentic chinese joint in Tyangra serving ppl of Kolkata since atleast last 12 years. Previously it used to serve good quality food with wholesome portions. However on recent occassions our visit to this restaurant was unsatisfactory. The quality of food has depleted, the portions have been reduced and service quality has also dampened. This may be due to extreme popularity of the joint- they are now committed to serving the mass and not the class (quality). 
Its high time the mngmnt makes an introspection.

Well, have been there a lot of times, but a recent fresh experience allows me to write this review. I went there on a Sunday afternoon and was quite happy to find a nice place for parking and a great place to sit. A man quickly came with the menu and we took little time to order the following:Fried Chicken WantonBeijing Special Fried RiceSichuan DuckThe course was simple but I was really looking forward for this duck. I was surprised to find that they did not have flavoured Smirnoff, I guess every big and small drinking place these days have the options, but they did not. Anyways we settled with the plain one, which came the first. Our starter was taking some time, so we asked for some crisps to have with the drink. And they swiftly denied having. And we settled with that too. Next came our Chicken fried wantons, these were pretty good and fried nicely, though the wantons were very ordinary but the frying made it acceptable.The rest of the order arrive quickly, and our Beijing Special Rice was completely WOW! I could see less rice and more of mushrooms, chickens, chunks of muttons, eggs and vegetables all around. I totally loved it. And with the spicy sichuan duck it blended superbly. The duck also was really awesome. I wish it could have been a little less rubbery but I have no complaints with anything else.¬†Only one more thing, I know you fall under the legendary section in Zomato, but I guess to remain there, Some consistency is needed to be maintained, I am happy with the deliciousness of the food, but I saw a number of flies near our food, which is not acceptable. Moreover I feel the hospitality could have been better.

This is my favourite Chinese Restaurant in Kolkata. Have been here since i was 15 years old. 


Place is really nice with the Family section on the ground floor offering comfortable seating. 


I love the starters here. Golden Fried Prawn with sweet chilly sauce is a must eat here.


Main course offers lots of options.

Quantity is good and a dish is appropriate for 2 people only.


The chefs, i guess, are the most experienced ones. But still, sometimes you can taste the food and find it a bit different from the last time. Maybe a bit of extra salt or other ingredients.

That is the only drawback.


Valet is good. they really have a proper basement parking and do take good care of your cars.

The thing with such restaurants is that, over time, they somewhat shed the reasons for their earlier fame. I am disheartened by its food. I have been going to this place since I was 6, the quality of the food has deteriorated and the portions have also reduced. The ambience is still the same, but that is not enough for a fantastic meal. There are only a handful of dishes that are worth mentioning like the fried chicken and fish in garlic and the Cantonese noodles. Their special chilli chicken is also good. I hope they are able to keep up their status as one of the best joints in china town, Calcutta.

I had been in this restaurant last week...This restaurant is one the renowned restaurants in China Town. The food and ambiance was very good. The decor was traditional Chinese. Even the service was very quick. You need not have to wait for a long time to get the food on table.

We were 5 people.We have ordered the below.

In starters : Crispy chilly pepper chicken,chicken wonton,prawn wanton and Beijing style chicken.
In main Course: Mixed Rice noodles,Shanghai Chicken and Peking Duck. 

All the dishes were brilliant. I liked Crispy chilly pepper chicken and prawn wanton the most. The bill was around Rs 3500/-.

This is a must try restaurant.I would recommend everyone to try it out at least once.

My friend was looking through the Legendary section in Zomato and discovered she hasnt been to Beijing! It took her 10mins to call up all the friends for a dinner and we all reached Beijing by an hour!
It was a saturday night and all the tables were filled as expected.. the server was very polite though and arranged a table for 6 of us in 5mins!!

We took time for finilizing the starters as everyone wanted their favourite items to be odrered and settled for Smoked Lamb and Crispy Chicken. The order was served quite fast.. and we jumped on the plates.. The Lamb preparation was superb.. perfect blend of spice and that lovely smokey flavour.. The sweet chilli sauce and the green chilli sauce played the perfect role of accompaniment.. hit the right chord in all of us! It was so good that we immediately ordered a 2nd plate of Smoked Lamb!! 
Crispy chicken was also good.. but with almost the same taste as many other chinese restaurants.. 

Meanwhile we decided our main course, and ordered Mixed Chilli Garlic chowmein, Chicken Fried Rice and Mixed American Chopsuey. The server halped us a lot while choosing the sides.. and we decided to order Chilli Garlic Chicken. 

Meanwhile a friend joined us and we had to ask the waiter atleast thrice before he paid a heed to our words and finally brought an extra glass, without water!! We were disgusted and called another waiter to put some water into the glass.. And most of them looked reluctant, I donno why!! Reluctance in serving water.. that too in a restaurant in Tangra.. raised my eyebrow!

It took almost 20mins to serve our order.. The Mixed Chilli Garlic chowmein was awesome! Noodles and generous amount of prawns and meats and eggs.. tossed in a spicy sauce.. created heaven, truly!! Chicken Fried Rice was stricty OK.. And what upgraded the experience was the Mixed American Chopsuey. It was a little sweet to some of my friend's taste, but I loved it thoroughly!! The Chilli Garlic Chicken was very good.. the light gravy with loads of garlic, with marinated chicken balls.. tasted great! 

In the meantime, one of us felt like having some fish.. and we called up the server for suggestion.. We settled for a plate of Shanghai Fish dry..

Now while we had almost finished our dinner.. and the plate of lambs were served.. along with Shanghai Fish.. The lamb was again super-tasty! The plate got finished off in a jiffy! With the same level of expectation, we went for Shanghai Fish.. and disappointment.. major disapointment!! Overtly salted.. barely any flavour..The Fish chinks tasting like dump of cornflour.. We tried calling the waiter..and no one paid heed.. after waving hands and a number of calling, some one appeared.. and on our complaint, he replied that it was too late to complain... He would have replaced the same if informed earlier!! We asked how?? Only if you people were available around, right!!!!! And.. he just went away!! We were awestruck... by his odacity.. it had almost spoiled our mood unless another waiter came in within 5-6minutes and informed us that they would "let go off" that particular dish.. he was polite enough when saying that!

Time for dessert.. and I was longing for that looong glass of Tutty Fruity.. while another friend wanted Chocolate Brownie with Icecream... We ordered both.. Tutty Fruity was served in a middle-sized glass... tasted good.. would have been better with jelly cubes...The brownie was hard.. kind of chewy.. and I completely hated it.. 

The bill came in as 4687/-.. not really OK considering the quality of food and also that this was China Town!!! Somehow.. not a pleasant experience overall!

Beijing is quite a favorite restaurant for a lot of people in Chinatown. It is a big name there and I am personally a fan of the place. Their food is excellent and their ambiance is also quite nice. I have very little to add about the food because its status among restaurants in Chinatown should be self explanatory as far as quality is concerned. I love their crispy chicken salt and pepper or the dish that comes to that effect. I find the restaurant tariff to be a bit on the higher side but then it has quality and time by its side. An absolute recommendation from me!

I am surprised to find I have not reviewed this as of yet! Anyway,Beijing and Kim Ling have been two of my most favourite places in China Town for quite a while. Later I came to know that they are actually sister establishments with this one being the more newer one.

The food here is very good from start to finish.The soups and starters are all more or less pretty good.Among the starters the Golden Fried Prawns deserve mention.The size of the prawns are impressive and they are fried to perfection with a coating I really like.The Drums of Heaven and the Lung fung soup are also worth a mention.

I really love the Beijing special Dry Chili chicken.It is awesome.It goes brilliantly as starter,main course and also with drinks.Among the main course,the chili crab claws here is legendary.The rice noodles or meifoon are one of my personal preferences.I feel the rice noodles here are better than that is available at most other places.Apart from the rather typical and common Chinese items like Schezwan and manchurian which are all pretty good I like the lemon fish.Its quite worth a try.

The quantity of the food is good.Although the prices have gone up of late,they still remain pretty moderate.But this place I think is slightly more expensive compared to a few other places in china town.

This is also a decent place to have drinks.The pricing of drinks was very reasonable in the past but have gone up of late.The cocktails are also quite well made specially the planter's punch.

The ambience is nice and simple.The place is quite spacious and the tables are well spread out and that is something I like.The service is one thing which is rather slow and needs improvement.

Like most other places in China Town this is one of the best options if you are visiting in a large group or you are giving a treat!

In short this is an old favourite and although I do feel it has gone down a bit,it still remains a good option for an overall satisfying meal.

Beijing had always been on my list , and we a couple of friends decided to pay a visit on a sultry summer afternoon. The decor   was simple and inviting. 
We ordered Drums of heaven as starter and it tasted really good. In the main dish, I had the Chicken Chilli garlic Rice Noodles and it was awesome and the portions were also good value for money. We decided to try the Schezwan Duck and it was tender and tasted really nice. 
The only drawback is the waiters seemed disinterested and service was slow for a near empty restaurant.
Overall a nice experience and  Definitely a must try for all Chinese lovers.

If you love chinese food and want to have a hearty meal with drinks provided your pocket being pinched mediumly, this is the place. The ambiance is awesome , perfect place for a family outing on lunch/ dinner . You can indulge in all authentic chinese dishes , their taste and quality being awesome and up to the set norms. The service is every friendly. We went a party of 11 people and the pocket pinch was around 5000+ including drinks+vat+servicetax / other taxes. This place is a foodie's heaven.

this place is simply not worth the money it charges. We had hot pot soup (uninspiring), golden fried prawns (too much batter) and crispy fish (mediocre taste) - and these dishes convinced us to find better fare elsewhere. We eventually moved to Golden Joy (five minutes away) and finally managed to satisfy our taste buds - but not before shelling out over two thousand bucks for the not so appealing meal at Beijing.Total waste of time and money; definitely not going back there anytime soon.

I have been eager to try the Chinese at Tangra for long. And so I was super excited when my friends planned lunch at Beijing, which, according to them, is the best joint at Chinatown. It was 1 p.m. and most of the tables were occupied. Though there were two floors for seating, they had limited it only to the ground floor, which is not such a good idea at a peak hour.  The waiter came to our table after we had called three times and took down the order with a bored look. However, these smalls things don't bother me as long as food is good.
 The overall feel of the place is so very Bengali. The menu, thankfully, was exclusively Chinese. We had ordered Drums of heaven, crispy fish  for starters. Both were good-tasting. I specially loved the green chutney along with it. Lung fung soup was ordinary, not much to speak of.  For the mains, chopsuey, fried rice, hakka noodles and two side dishes..chicken with cashew nuts and prawn in hot garlic sauce. Chopsuey, specially was superb..it had the right balance of sweet and sour, which is a bit difficult to find. Others were good too. But I strongly feel the joint lacks authenticity.They have moulded the taste and flavour of the dishes, according to the local taste. It can be, at best,  labelled as Bengali Chinese. I did not get the Chinatown feel I was looking for, in terms of food and ambience. My friends remarked that the standard has gone down. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable visit!

Had a great evening over here. Starting with the starter we had drums of heaven which was so tasty that I craved for more of it. This appetizer was really very tempting along with the dip with which it was served. Following this the order was given for the soup. Selecting from among the list of soups was the toughest decision indeed!!! Finally we all opted for Sweet Corn Soup- Chicken. This was mild and soothing. Coming to the main course, Chicken American Chopsuey was mouth-watering. Though initially I was not sure of this particular dish but finally I must admit that this was the best I have had over there. Chicken Rice Noodles was equally delectable and tempting. Mixed fried rice was rather normal in comparison with these two. Shanghai Chicken, Chicken In Hot Garlic Sauce and Chicken with Pepper were the choices for side dish. All three were of great taste but the taste of Shanghai Chicken will be remembered always. It was so delicious. This I do want to try out once more from this place. In the desserts category , Choco Brownie and Black Forest Sundae was being ordered. Relished Black Forest Sundae very much. The serving time was good. The ambiance was also very good. I enjoyed this place very very much.

This is one of the best restaurants in Tangra. Unlike Big boss it does not have enough parking facilities, however that does not stop it from becoming as good as Big boss (if not better) when it comes to its kitchen products. I like its ambience better than any restaurants around. The moment you get inside you will be welcomed by our very familiar chinese smell, if you understand what i mean. I would recommend you the prawn dishes over here. Also you can try ducks and crabs, as you would not find these in many restaurants.
They have some strange named dishes. To give you an essences of it, the next time I go I have decided to eat phoenix emperor prawn!

On hot summer Sunday afternoon , we landed up in Beijing to have our lunch. Luckiliy, we got a 6-seat table for 4 of us, and a kid of 1 year.

We had Kung Pao Chicken, and Mushroom Spring Mushroom to start with. While the chicken was good, the cracker was excellent. It was crunchy and with Mushroom inside,it was something to go very well, with our Bacardi breezer, Vodka and cold drinks.

Moving to main course, me+wife took Gravy Chowmein with Shanghai Chicken. I portion was enough for 2 of us. My friend couple, who are regular visitor over there, went for their "tried n tasted" Chicken Cantonese Rice, with Lemon Fish.
Overall, the service was quick, and taste was good.

They offered a baby chair too for my kid, who was comfortable seated there, with out any "hungama".

A nice experience indeed.

Beijing - Excellent Chinese food with excellent ambiance at Tangra.
============================================================
Brief:

 I had been to Beijing Restaurant with my brother when i was heading towards Royal enfield Service center. This restaurant is located in the heart of Tangra and the " mesmerising exteriors" drove me inside to give this place a try. This place has a free valet parking. As i entered inside, this place had huge ceilings and simple decor with a little classy touch to it with an open bar too. I was quite impressed with the decor and as we entered inside, we immediately took our seats as we were quite restless to try the food out here in Tangra. I have been hearing a lot about the Chinese food in Tangra from my parents and even my foodie friends and this review goes for you people specially. 
============================================================
Food:-

As i was given the A la carte, i was a little hesitant as the prices of the chicken dishes were sky high. The gravy dishes were divided into full and half. Well, i was like the gravy item is so costly. However, my assumption went wrong when i asked the staff about the quantity of half plate which he mentioned that half plate consists of near about 8 pieces. I was like 8 pieces in half plate is quite lovely. Thereafter it immediately struck me about why the dish was so costly. Well nevertheless, we ordered:- 

1) Szechwan Chicken - This dish was excellent. However, i could clearly make out how they had prepared it because the chicken was a little cold and the gravy was sizzling hot. It's because they had kept the cooked chicken in the refrigerator and thereafter, added to the gravy. I would further like to request the management to saut√©/mix the chicken properly for a little longer time before serving and make sure that the oil is kept to a very low level. The new thing which i noticed here was that they had added a pinch of Coriander in the chicken. The gravy was less. :)

2) Chicken Chilli Garlic Rice - It was excellent. The rice was boiled perfectly and the chicken was added excessively. However, oil was a little more than required. But, yes, it did taste lovely.

This two costed us 460 bucks including taxes which i think is pretty good if you want to dine in at a restaurant having a good ambience. These two dishes filled our stomach perfectly. Not too much and not too less!
============================================================
Meal for two: 600-800 max
============================================================
Pros:-

1) Excellent ambience with enough air to breathe.
2) Courteous stewards.
3) Prompt service. (Not as fast as bar b q but good enough) 
4) Quality food.
5) Hygiene is maintained well. 
6) Valet Parking. 
7) Serves veg, chicken, duck, crabs, fish and mutton under one roof. 

Cons:-

1) On the costly side. 
============================================================
Summary:

Food quality 4/5
Food quantity 4/5 (The gravy quantity if kept a little high would do wonders)
Hygiene 4/5
Taste 4/5
Hospitality 4/5
Value for money 4/5
Ambience 4/5
============================================================
Conclusion:

I have attached a few pictures of this place. 
I would love to visit it again due to the good service and the quality food. :-)

Visited Beijing a couple of days back. The food was terribly bad. We have ordered mixed gravy noodles, mixed fried rice and schezwan chicken. The noodles were over boiled and tasteless. The rice were so hard that you have to be extra cautious to chew it. The chicken was something that astonished us. Even road side chicken curry is better than that dish.
But we used to visit this place during our college days. The food was delicious in those early days.
So, to the owner(s) and the chef(s), please rectify yourself. At least, I will not recommend anyone to visit your restaurant.

China Town is synonymous with this beast of a restaurant. The Peking Chicken, Rice Noodles, Chopsuey and Honey prawn were truly delicious. I'd go as far as to say that the food was flawless. Mutton Spare ribs Szechuan style was another treat for the tongue. Only complain I have about this place is that the ambience was not appealing. But the amazing food compensated for that. I'd love to visit again soon.

Ambience is nice but the food is average. Service is good. Dry items like chilli chicken, chilli baby corn, spring mushroom and chilli fish are good. The items like hakka chowmien, fried rice, rice noodles are average but the gravy items like veg manchurian and chilli chicken tastes quite bad. You will find improper quantity of salt in them, either less or more than required.

Ok reached this place on a tuesday at 4.30 . The place was pretty empty as it is an odd time for people to go for lunch. Since we were starving for food we didnt waste time and placed the order.
The order took around 10 mins to reach our table which was really good .
The order consisted of
crispy spinach: it was good
chilli garlic rice: the rice had some nice flavors and was not too spicy
shangai fish: this was a dish with a great taste . 

Overall the food was superb the ambiance was amazing.. the staff was prompt and courteous....

There was a time when a trip to Beijing was must during our yearly summer holidays n Calcutta. We would wait for that evening when cousins would pile into a cab and make our way into seedy China Town. The food would be secondary to the excitement of eating in China Town. Well that was then, now Beijing doesn't really hold up to its standards anymore. Or maybe we have tasted better food and have higher expectations from a place that charges like this. 
Food wise, apart from the regular items, please beware of their crab dishes...the last time i'd taken my sister and her kids for a meal there and since the kids wanted crab we reluctantly ordered something. We tasted a spoon and felt something totally amiss. Later the bill added insult to injury as we were not at all pleased to pay so much for below par food :( 
Havent gone back to Beijing after that and i doubt i would ever again. The ambience has turned seedier, with bad lighting and general mustiness. There are better options in this vicinity now. Moreover it's better to let some memories remain happy and unsullied by reality.

Okay this place will always be special to be because I met my fianc√© here.
Waiters are warm and friendly.
Location is convenient because it is close to the entrance of China Town.
 The ambience is good. You can chill out with your friends in the ground floor or come with your family and kids to the elegantly decorated first floor.
 The food is great. They give a sumptuous amount. Be it their soup, chowmein, thupka, fried rice the taste of authentic Chinese food lingers in your mouth for a long time.
It is pocket-friendly. Very.
Drinks are amazing. Try their cocktails. Even other drinks are surprisingly inexpensive.

There are many restaurants available in Tangra China town, but probably every family wants to go to 'Beijing' the family restaurant. It is the first place that you have noticed while entering the china town. Known for it's food and ambiance, Beijing is a winner all the way.

We have many encounters with Beijing, every time we got satisfied. Ambiance is pretty quiet to noise at times, totally family environment. Red is the theme here, be it on the ground floor or first floor. Seating arrangement is not cramped, minimal but decoration is apt.

Food is always good here. Specially the starters. Portion is huge. Drums of heaven is absolute must here. Everything in the 'Special' is good. Be it sea food or fish or chicken, you will not be disappointed. Never tried any desserts here so can't comment on that. Pricing is at par according to portions.

Overall if you want to gather a good experience without a pocket hole, you can always try "Beijing".

It was a special occasion for one of my special friends and Beijing was an obvious choice. Being a weekday and our choice of an early evening timing, we got a relatively crowd free ambience. The service needless to say became much faster. We ordered - golden fried prawn, mutton spare ribs, duck schezwan and prawn balls. Everything was steaming hot but the standout was the mutton spare ribs. Extremely soft and succulent with an amazing taste. Try the chilli garlic version. The manchurian version was also spot on with lesser zing but equivalent taste. The duck was slightly hard but isnt it always!!!! Great food with good tinge of authentic chinese incorporated.

I simply love this restaurant. If you want to have authentic Chinese food in Kolkata, be sure to visit this place. Everything about it is perfect, the food, the service and the ambiance. Its my family favourite chinese restaurant. To begin with, the Mixed Thai Soup is one of a kind here. Most of the starters are yummy, be it Veg or Non-Veg. As a main course, in my suggestion, the best is Chicken Meinfoon(Rice Noodles) with any of the chicken/prawn preparations as sides. Be sure try their Duck preparation in winter.

It was on the occasion of the Marriage anniversary  of an associate of my father, quite a while back, that I happened to visit this place. We reached there at about 7:00 pm and we were showed our way upstairs by an attendant, where the gathering was on. The sitting that had been arranged were still empty. Guests started pouring in @7:30 and the serving started at 8:00. The service was outrageously slow. 

We had Prawn Crackers for starters along with Chicken Hot & Sour Soup. I liked both of them. The soup had the perfect touch of spiciness. We had to wait quite a bit for the main course.

Next came the Chicken Fried Rice which was as usual as we get in popular Chinese restaurants. Along with it came Garlic Chicken(Gravy) which was a bit salty.. Following it came Chili Fish, which was again nothing extraordinary. By this time I was full and couldn't try anymore and to mention that I was tired to the point that I was drowsy. 

The ordeal of the slow service finally ended with a Kesar Pista Ice Cream. 

After that I kept pestering my parents to leave asap.

Certainly the best in Tangra/China town area, also more expensive than any other in that area..the prawns recipes are a must try and the quantity is also sumptuous. The prawn chips and the fish fingers are also a must try along with your favorite drink..the ambience is quite good and this restaurant is very easy to locate as it is right at the front if you are entering the China town area. Must try for all Chinese food lovers.

Apart from the fact that this is lip-smacking and authentic Chinese food, the portions are amazingly large, given the price! This stands out as the so-called new age restaurants have taken the opposite strategy. Maybe I say this because I may be old fashioned when it comes to eating out. But I'll still recommend restaurants like Beijing for a truly sumptuous and vale for money experience in China Town. The Kung Pao chicken and prawn Mei Foon are must to be tried. Unfortunately crabs weren't available when we visited but that could be a seasonal thing I'm guessing.

Tangra means beijing and beijing means tangra. beijing is authentic chinese at its best!!! It is a family restaurant and the decor resembles that as well. Ifound it quite neat and clean. The service is swift and the ambience is nice. the food is SUPERB!!! everything from the soup to the rice and the side dishes made me feel that this is THE BEST chinese i have had in the entire city till date. Moreover, I'm not a big fan of lemon chicken but, the lemon chicken here made me want more. To put it simply, I LOVE BEIJING and will definitely go back for more!!!! MUST HAVE: chocolate brownie with ice cream.........OHHHHH HEAVENLY!!!

Beijing is probably one of the best places for eating out with family. The ambiance is very cosy and the food is obviously very yumm. I have been to this place twice and I must say that both the times, I fell in love with their food! On my last visit, I had ordered Crispy Chicken, Chicken Dumpling and Prawn Crackers for the starters. Each one of them were delicious. The Crispy Chicken also became one of my favourite chicken dishes and I would love to visit Beijing again just to try this out! Next was the Chicken Wanton Soup which was very appropriately made. For the main course we ordered for Chicken with Honey, Chilli Fish, Thai Garlic Prawn with Beijing Hakka Chow and Chicken Rice Noodles. All the dishes were quite sumptuous and I would highly recommend this place for all who visit Kolkata for the first time, and for the Kolkatans, I am sure Beijing is already on their list of best restaurants in town! 

All the best to the team of Beijing and I hope it flourishes more with time!

Sister concern of Kim Ling, Beijing was opened much later (probably late 90s or early 2000s) and we used to call it "the new hotel which had that big fish"... but slowly, it became a family favorite. We have been frequenting this place for a considerable period of time now, and well, although it is not as great as Kim Ling or Kafulok (those are the go-to places on my list in Chinatown), this place does have its merits. My last visit was with my family and one mushroom-crazy sister, who ALWAYS orders spring button mushrooms. In fact, the entire family loves it, but she is more of a fan of the dish. My father and I were more inclined towards the drums of heaven, so we veered that way. Mothership was more into the Thai Soup, and as I wanted some too, split a soup between us. The evening rolled on, and soon we were busy attacking Chicken Chow mien, Chicken with button mushrooms (the sister strikes again!) and lemon fish. Our meal, along with drinks, was reasonably priced, and the food was piping hot and the server was attentive. Thumbs Up!!!

A family dinner on Sunday lead to a group of us heading to our old favorite Beijing and as always we were very happy to enjoy an excellent meal there. Chicken Thai Soup , Crispy Chilly Baby Corn , Chicken Fried Wantons and my most adored Chilly Garlic Crab Claws made for a magnificent beginning to our feast (I would not be doing it justice to just calling it a meal ) . All of our starters and the soup were delicious. This was followed up by Chicken Rice Noodles (Meifoon) , Lemon Chicken , Kung Pao Chicken and Chicken Foo Yung all of which were polished off by us. We ended with a Tutti Frutti and were barely in a condition to climb into our cars and stagger home after stuffing ourselves with all that lovely food. The service was quick and good as always despite a huge rush so that deserves a special mention.

----- 05 Nov, 2012 -----

Went there again for dinner on Saturday and all I can say is I always come back with a huge smile on my face everytime I visit. We were lucky to be able to get the "chilli-garlic crab claws" and that initself was enough to transport us straight to foodie bliss !!! We also had the crispy spinach which was great and one the only dish vegetarian dish that I order here by choice as a hard-core non-veg. Schewzan Fried Rice, Crispy Garlic Pepper Potatoes, Cicken Meifoon and Honey Chicken followed. My only complaint was that the spring rolls we ordered for starters was very oily.

----- 11 Oct, 2012 -----

I first met Monica Liu (owner of Beijing) as a 17 year old who would frequent her restaurant Kimling in Tangra. Back then there were just a few tables and stools and even our cold drinks were sourced from the local panwala on order. Since then she has become a one woman empire who owns Kimling and Beijing in Tangra , Tungfong on Free School Street corner and Mandarin on Rashbehari/ Southen Avenue Crossing. 
Though it is no longer a pocket friendly option for a hungry student but there is something about the taste of the food that has me hooked for over 20 years. Start with the Chicken Thai Soup and Spring Chicken, for mains the Special Fried Rice and Mixed Meat MeiFoon (Rice Noodles) with Honey Chicken/ Chili Garlic Prawn (or Chicken) and Red Garlic Chicken (or Prawn) and your in foodie heaven. My personal all time favourite are the Chili Garlic Crab Claws but alas you have to order in advance and even then of late they are hardly ever available .... that perhaps is my major complaint. 
And last but not least is their GREEN CHILI SAUCE is superb and available at all of Ms. Liu's restaurants. Its just awesome!

I think Last when I tried here in 2009, the food was extra ordinary.

When I visited last month, it was a shock, food was average, drinks over priced compared to other restaurants in their area (almost double).
Being a weekday the family people were less, more drunkards around. Problem here is I did not find any separate family enclosure, hence the place was a mess.
Lastly service was poor, waiters least interested to give options as per your taste.
Will think twice before visiting again.

It was a lunch with my boyfriend's family at Beijing. heard a lot about this restaurant being a favorite at china town.
it was their umpteenth time and my first time there at beijing though I have been to china town a lot of time but to different restaurants.
the ambience is just wow, dim lighting n large spacious seating area. and i super loved the painting of pandas which is just on your left when you enter the restaurant.
but I had some problem with the food there, especially when people told me a lot about the great taste of the food.
we ordered chicken american chopsuey, chicken hakka fried rice , shanghai chicken and chicken in hot garlic sauce.
well, apart from the chicken side dishes I didnt find the former two much edible. the chopsuey tasted weird with very less salt and more like a runny tomato kethup with capsicums in it.
and the quality of rice of the hakka chicken fried rice was very bad. none of us liked it.
but the side dishes were good.
the waiters behaved well though they seemed so confused god knows why! 
hope they do upgrade the quality of some of their dishes because many people still go to Beijing to get the best of china town. :)

I visited this place last year and I can tell that the food isn't really gonna disappoint you. We had all the babycorns,chicken lollipops and the hot n sour soup as starters and we had sizzlers after that. Though some of my friends who had been here before told me that they didn't get sizzlers when they came here with their families last time ( I guess I just got lucky!)
Stuff like choco brownie,tutty fruity, blue lagoon and like are there for desserts. The atmosphere is actually good. Enjoy!

I was visiting this place for the last 10-12 years. The ambiance has not changed a bit. The restaurant now has two floors with the first floor exclusively for the family and any other party. But, I always liked to sit in their ground floor because I always find it to be more jovial atmosphere with all the hustle bustle, that perfect light to indulge in your poison, and some neat sitting areas. Compared to many other Chinese restaurants in the Tyangra area, Beijing is spacious and the tables are set apart in a distance that it provides the required privacy as well.

I was not that adventurous in Beijing but I think I had tasted all the starters they had to offer, and they are lovely. When we visit now, we always start the course with our family favorite - Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken (crispy fried chicken seasoned with pepper and coated with garlic, served in a bed of chopped chillis and garlic), and Drums of Heaven (nothing but chicken lollypop but sinfully hot). Also try out - Capsicum Chicken, Crispy Fried Baby Corn, Golden Fried Porn etc. In the main, try out the Mixed Szechwan Noodles, Dry Garlic Chicken, Dry Chicken Manchurian, Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce, Sweet and Sour Fish (a bit too sweet) etc.

They have a good collection of drinks available with offers going around some times. They also have some regular cocktails and mocktails.

Summarily, the place is value for money and taste. Purists will probably crib about the bit too much influence of Indian style in the Chinese dishes prepared in the restaurants in Tyangra but if you forget about the theories and authenticities, it can be great fun as well.

Well, Tangra has countless restaurants offering Chinese cuisine but what makes Beijing stand out from the rest is the quantity of food it serves and the kind of ambiance it offers. 
It is indeed a place where you can visit with a large group and see how all your friends get a decent portion from just one  plate of starter/ side dish or main course that you have ordered. Yes, whatever you order the quantity is huge. So either go in a group or ensure that your stomach is empty. 
The ambiance here is much better than its competitors. The food however is a tussle between decent and good. While some dishes are very good, some are decent. You can ask the waiter to guide you according to your palate. 
But whatever you order here make it a point to order for a plate of crispy fish and a plate of chilli garlic pepper chicken dry along with a bowl of tom yum soup. You can also consider dabbling with some crab claws or biting into some juicy chicken dumplings. In the main course try some rice noodles over normal noodles or else choose for Cantonese chow or chopsuey.

As far as I remember Beijing used to be THE LANDMARK or the alternative name for China Town/Tangra. If Beijing is the capital of China, then Beijing restaurant used to be the capital of China Town Kolkata, ofcourse for its food. 
Yesterday I was in the mood to have Chinese (as always), but wanted to try some new place as I was bored of repeated visits to Golden Joy.Though this was not my first visit to Beijing, the last time I had been here was alteast 6-7 years back with my parents. I always had the impression that Beijing is comparatively costlier and it justifies the pricing with quality Chinese food. So thought of trying it out yesterday.

Location: Located at the heart of China town near Big Boss. Finding the restaurant should not be a problem. It is a land mark itself ! Parking is available outside the restaurant as well as in the basement. One strange thing I noticed, is that if you want to park your car in the basement then you have to opt for valet parking and handover the keys to one of the attendants. Even if you want to park yourself then you cannot. They will handover the keys to you only after you are done with your meal before leaving. While it is a very good gesture to keep attendants for valet parking, at the same time it should not be restricted! Quite strange ! 
Ambiance : The restaurant is housed on the ground floor, big enough to accommodate 60-70 diners. Table placement is good enough, not cramped into each other. Enough space to move around. But the decor and interiors are simple and basic like any other Chinese restaurant. 
The Food: Since I and my friend was not planning a very heavy lunch, we decided to start with main course. We wanted to have a quick lunch and go for shopping we ordered One Chicken Cantonese noodles(gravy) and One Chicken with Vegetables stir fried(half) along with one fresh lime soda (sweet). The waiter was kind enough and made a bit of modification as we wanted the chicken to be a bit spicy so that it goes well with the bland gravy noodles. He instructed the cook to make the chicken in schezwan sauce. Such gesture is very much appreciated :) 
The fresh lime soda arrived in few minutes and it tasted horrible. We complained and it was replaced by making a new one. This time it tasted better. Nothing over the top though. The food arrived in another 10 minutes. The gravy noodles had more gravy than noodles. No doubt it was filling but it the gravy filled my belly more than the noodles. The vegetables portion in the noodles was generous. The taste was strictly okay, nothing superior to what is available elsewhere. The chicken with stir fried vegetables was good, especially in schezwan sauce. It was spicy and tangy. Went well with the noodles. Serving size was just okay but did not do justice to the price. 
Honestly speaking food is over priced here. The half plate chicken costed Rs205 and the noodles Rs150. The chicken slices were small (around 8 slices). At any other restaurant, a full plate of chicken costs around Rs250 which includes 14-15 pieces minimum. The taste is also nothing exotic to justify the pricing. Alcohol pricing is also on the higher side, which is understandable. Such pricing keeps the tipplers away who might spoil the comfort level of the fellow diners. A Tuborg (650m) is priced at Rs180. IMFLs are priced around Rs125-Rs200 for each peg (60ml).

Final Verdict: To be frank I was disappointed. May be I had high expectations or I ordered the wrong items ! I did not find the food special in any way. The quantity and pricing is not justified. This is the only reason restaurants like Golden Joy has such a huge number of fans. The food at Beijing is fine but I would prefer going to Golden Joy instead for better food at very reasonable pricing and freedom to park as you like :) 
A 3 for Beijing ...

Beijing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...the first thing the  very name rings the bell in our mind is of the Capital of China! In Kolkata , Tangra, Beijing  is one such restaurant  offering exotic  Chinese Cuisine. The restaurant  is very simple , yet elegant. It has two floors, ground & first & is located exactly opposite the Big Boss! I happened to be there late  yesterday after noon , much against my wishes though ,  as I normally prefer to go to Big Boss .Of late since the quality of food at Big Boss has deteriorated my wife & I decided to give it a try. Unlike the  Big Boss , there is a dearth of parking space here.
I wanted to try Schechuan Crabs but was informed by the waiter that it wasn‚Äôt available, so we ordered for Golden Fried Prawns instead . It was nice & palatable. I found It was pretty expensive compared to Big Boss as there were only seven  prawns  to the usual twelve pieces generally served at Big Boss( and is also priced lesser)  .Since we are fond of Mixed Thai Soup, we ordered for a  medium bowl  & split it into two. I had to ask for Soya , chilli & the sweet chilli sauce as  I found that there was only salt & pepper cruet apart from Chilli vinegar & Green chilli & coriander chutney in a small ceramic  bowl.
Since we weren‚Äôt in the mood to have  rice, we ordered for Cantonese style mixed Chowmein  and  Schechuan Prawns(Dry) .I must say that we were really impressed with it the food. The service was average.The appearance/profile  of the waiters was far from wanting  & this is one area which should be looked into, since it makes a great difference on the overall  impression!
 This place is pretty expensive compared to Big Boss & we actually ended up paying a little less than 2k!
On the whole I would rate it at 3.5/5.

Beijing is and always has been one of Kolkata's finest Chinese restaurants.I've been here many a time and have sometimes been thoroughly satisfied and other times been gravely disappointed.
There are a lot of appetisers to choose from but some are are almost never available.
I'd suggest the chilli garlic fish, and the spring chicken for starters. I advise you not to experiment much in this restaurant as the quality of the dishes vary greatly. Have the lung fung soup if available.
The main course is a strong department for Beijing. It offers good quality and reasonable quantity on a plate. The rice noodles are good but not excellent. The Cantonese noodles are exceptional and appeals to every platter.But I'd have to say that the fried rice is par.
Most of the side dishes are amazing and this is where Beijing separates the milk from the cream. You can't really go wrong but order the crab carefully. The unavailability of the crab adds to their list of cons.
Beijing maybe does not deserve a 3.0 rating but I'd give it a 3.2 or a 3.3 if I could.
To conclude Beijing was a top class Chinese restaurant which invited frequent visits of mine but after the ascent of places like tung fong my visits here have lessened.

Best ambience in china town. No doubt the food is great too, specially the starters and a few mains. Chili garlich pepper fish, crabmeat balls (not always available though) in spicy schezuan sauce, golden fried prawn, honey chicken, and as always with their sibling kim ling, the spicy hot n sour or thai soups are some of my personal favourites. Highest price tag in china town too, although the serving size is definitely for carnivorous dinosaurs.

There was a time when the only destination for Chinese food in Kolkata meant China town. But gone are those days and its better if people got out of theit hangover. First of all the area is not at all safe for late nights and the problem of finding a cab there is a herculean task. Even if you take your car beijing doesn't have a parking space and parking your car in those narrow bylanes there is always a high chance of another car denting it. Coming to the restaurant proper the place is quite spacious and the tables are well spread. The waiters are well mannered but they need to have a better idea about their food and not run about asking which dish is spicy and not. One thing I would definitelt add is that they don't serve authentic chinese. They serve good chinese but it is no way authentic. I have had authentic chinese food in Nepal where even getting thr order across was difficult as the waiter didn't understand a single word of English or any other language I knew and trust me the food there either tasted like broth or of chilli paste. If authentic chinese is your motto I say go to Eau Chew another very old chinese joint trying to educate people that chinese doesn't mean only MSG!! I only say this because beijing is in no way cheap and you get better food without having to go to Chinatown!!

Food is excellent. Lots of options, to choose from. Service is prompt. 
Folks looking for an occasion or excuse to toast, would enjoy the starters. Dont miss, one of my fav. Crispy Fish - Small pieces of your familiar fish fry, but cut above the rest in terms of quality.  Fish is extremely good, and is just pure cubes of fish fillet.

Keep on trying the innumerable optiions, while you toast.
For folks, who would gorge on the food list, go ahead.

Over the years the locality has modified slowly- you can see towers and gates resembling a true china town, but the conveyance options remain sparse. So think about taking a car, if u drop in at night.

Otherwise, all in all a favorite den for me!!

For some a good music makes their day, for others its a good movie while some prefer a good book. But if its brilliant Chinese at reasonable price and in a moderate ambiance that has the capability to make your day worthwhile, don't miss Beijing.

Located in a place crammed with Chinese restaurants around it, this place still has the potency to fill its large seating capacity on a regular basis.

The first time I went here was a few years back and the route we took to reach this place was not at all appealing. The roads were dingy and due to slight rainfall on the previous night had become dirty and stingy as well. Tangra is not someplace where people would love to go if not for the Chinese restaurants that make it famous. Beijing is a flagship restaurant of this place and once you enter here you are bound to forget the locality.

Beijing is a large restaurant on the basis of seating capacity, yet it is well maintained and provides a good if not great ambiance. My first visit to Beijing was also my first visit to any restaurant in Tangra. I had gone their with one of my friends and this being our first time we were not at all aware of the quantity. We started by ordering a plate of dry chilli chicken and a plate of chicken wantons. Being sure we were new to the place the waiter politely ad-viced us to take one and then think before ordering the other. There aren't too many restaurants in Kolkata that would do that. 

We ordered half plate of each. I was taken aback by the sheer quantity of food. There were around 12 pieces of chicken and that many number of wanton fries as well. Oh Lord!! This made me fall in love with Beijing. The taste was brilliant. Having had dry chilli chicken loads of times I was not prepared for such quality and quantity at such a moderate price. It was soft and crunchy and had the right punch of bitterness to it. The wanton fries were also equally good. The crispy layer was superb and inside was succulent chicken. I am not the type who favors a diet or counts the calories in his food. We both can eat like monsters. Otherwise after having these two dishes we wouldn't have ordered anything else. 

In the main course we were very careful and ordered chicken fried rice and ginger fish. Both were excellent and quantity followed the suite of the starters. The ginger fish had the right hint of spices and the smell of ginger was also perfect. We didn't order anything in deserts but the next time when I was at Beijing I found their deserts, especially the tutti-fruity ice cream to be a class winner.

Considering the quantity, quality and pricing I would give this place a 5 on 5. Gosh!! I just became hungry again!!

The two words, "Authentic-Chinese" and "Beijing" go hand in hand, when it comes to Kolkata. More than Mainland China, the experience of gustatory delight is guaranteed by Beijing restaurant, located at Christopher Road, Tangra, off the EM Bypass. The flavours of Chinese fine-dining - colour, smell, flavour, shape, emerge perfectly from the servings at Beijing.

It is extremely popular throughout Kolkata. The Szechwan Duck, Green Pepper Fish, Lemon Prawns, Prawn Balls, are the dishes which will make you crave for more. Their condiments are one of a kind. I have tried chopsuey in other places, but authentic & mouth-watering American Chopsuey is found only Beijing, they embrace your taste buds. The smell of their food is the prevailing factor for which you won't be able to resist yourselves, even if your tummy does not permit ! As for desserts, I'll recommend Choco-Brownies & Black Forest Sundae. 

Pros:  Food is served hot, clean and delicious. None of them tastes repulsive. Authentic Chinese food is an asset factor. Perfect cooking is a promise; spices & herbs completely blended in food ingredients; fish portions are good and soft; the prawns are clean. Noodles are thin; Rice is well cooked & soft. Staff is okayish. Definitely a family place; with friends you'll enjoy more. Space is not a problem, & yes Birthday cakes are allowed.

Cons: Parking for your car is problem. Still you need a car because getting a cab on your way back even after 7pm is a herculean task. Not a much recommended place during festive seasons, there is a huge queue & reservations go askew. Sometimes crowd is really noisy. Along with hard-drinks Beijing might bill you heavily or else reasonable for authentic Chinese platters. Table allotment is disappointing since they'll strictly allot table exactly as per no. of heads and that might not be desirable every time.

Overall to sum it up, Beijing is always a good experience for anyone, compared to any other Chinese restaurant in China Town or rest of Kolkata. You won't be able to say 'Adieu' that easily!

Went there many times.but the last time the experience was terrible.we were served rotten prawn and undercooked chicken.such a bad experience.otherwise the ambience is good but tends to be noisy.main attraction is the pricing which was cheap.

Popularly known as the china town of kolkata- Beijing is located at EM bypass, tangra region. It will be slightly difficult to find the place if you are going for the first time.
This has been my second visit to this place after a very long time.

PARKING: Though they provided us with a parking in the backyard of their restaurant but the driveway to it was dirty, dark and looked unsafe. So i would say parking is an issue.

FOOD: Authentic Chinese food comes to my mind when we talk about this place.We ordered for spring chicken in the starters which tasted good. The quantity of food ( particularly in the starters section) have decreased over the past few years. I tried their mixed haka chow min along with garlic chicken and mixed fried rice in the main course. They serve you the base (sweet or spicy) depending on your taste. I ordered for the sweet base in the chicken dish as am fond of sweet food. The garlic chicken tasted good along with the haka chow min. The ONLY disappointment was the mixed fried rice. The prawns were a bit too hard and dry and in overall it did not taste good.

AMBIANCE: Average! 

PRICE: Reasonable compared to any good Chinese outlet in kolkata. The price of the main course such as garlic chicken ,sweet n sour chicken etc are comparatively high.

foods good place after all these years still looks decent. pricing is also descent not too expensive. place needs to be seriously revamped it can do better. For a chinese restaurant the service is slow ordering snacks takes a while even with simple things like prawn chips which is just deep frying a serve no prep required. so thumbs down on service.

A China Town restaurant is incomparable to any other Chinese restaurant in kolkata. And this is one of the best. Authentic Chinese cuisine at moderate prices. Like the other China Town restaurants,the chilli pudina chutney is the condiment i die for. coming to the food, well everything is good. i am a huge fan of their Meifoons. Their chicken starters have a huge variety to choose from,and i personally prefer those more over the gravy items. The ambience is nice,staff are courteous,must visit restaurant in China Town.

Beijing is a very popular restaurant in Tangra (China Town) where you get the best of Chinese cuisine. The moment you reach there the attendants will take possession of your car and you don't have to worry about the parking (at least I never had a problem). It's a huge restaurant spreading from one end to another is tables and chairs with decorative wooden partitions. Food here is quite affordable but not cheap if compared with other restaurants in the same area. Everything is cool accept their rice dishes which I like the least.Try their wantons, golden fried prawns and other starters you will love it.

Authentic Chinese. Yea thats what comes to your mind when you talk about Beijing. The place is one of the fews destinations in the city which boasts of authentic chinese food.

Located just off the EM.Bypass and in the tangra region, the place is popular for being a party of the 'Chinatown' of Kolkata. The food is mouthwatering and delicious. The decor is average though. The good quality food and moderately priced alcohol makes it an instant hit. 

The food is excellent and is pretty reasonably priced as well. However the driveway leading to the restaurant can be a bit dirty and smelly . Also, parking is a problem although Beijing does offer an underground parking. Another problem is that they prohibit all men groups !!! 

Overall a must try for all chinese lovers!!!!

This restaurant serves one of the best chinese food in town. My review on the food I had - 
Drums of heaven - tasted more like tandoori chicken...missed the chinese flavour
Veg fried rice - had fresh vegetables and was good
Veg manchurian - yummy
dry chilli chicken -  the chicken was very soft and tasted delicious... the nly problem was it looked too pale... I mean for a second I thought I should skip it but thankfully I had it and I liked it.
chicken schezwan - must try... the gravy just melted in the mouth. In fact everyone in my family thought it was the best they had.

I will recommend that the restaurant owner should check their ac since everyone was perspiring while eating and it did not feel good. Apart from that no complains.

Heard lot about his restaurant that this is one of the best among the Chaina Town restaurants, but we had a bitter experience. Last Friday we went there with my office team for dinner but disheartened with the food quality and service. 

1. We ordered 1 mushroom, 1 corn, 1 plate of Chicken Drumsticks and 1 prawn crackers as starters....they served 2 plate of corn, 11 pieces of drum sticks (whereas the plate consist of 12) when complaining about this, the waiter asked about the order several times and then only replaced one plate of corn with some mushroom dish (not the one we ordered). The fried baby corn was not crispy...the mushroom preparation was very bad. The drumsticks were good in comparison to other dishes.

2. In the main course we have ordered Hakka chowmein along with fish in Szechuan fish and chilli chicken. The preparation was good but some portion of the fish got some bad/pungent smell. The chowmein was good and chicken was ok, but the service was very very bad. Even one of the guys waiting just beside our table just waiting for us to finish our food quickly so that he can ask for some tips.

I will rate the food as 3/5 but the service and behavior 1.5/5 .

Rarely do you get to visit a restaurant in Kolkata that offers authentic Chinese cuisine at very nominal rates. Yes Beijing Restaurant, located at Christopher Road, Tangra, Kolkata, is one restaurant where you can enjoy a plateful of authentic and mouthwatering Chinese delicacies at reasonable prices.  Exactly one year ago, I dined in this restaurant with some close relatives of mine. After enjoying our day at Science City and Nicco Park, we decided to take the road that led to Tangra. Tangra has a whole lot of Chinese eateries, most of which offer delicious and authentic Chinese dishes. And most important all, you do not burn a hole in your pocket while enjoying a three-course meal in most of these Chinese food hubs.

Beijing is one of the oldest and most popular Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. We got there in the evening. Voraciously hungry, we placed our orders, which included a-la carte meal- dimsums, soups, main course and yummy desserts. We had spring button mushrooms, chicken dumplings and spring prawns with Lung Fung Chicken Soup. Each item was awesome! Within forty five minutes of serving our dimsums and soups, the waiters arrived with steaming hot food. For our main course, we ordered some Cantonese chicken, Szechwan duck, chicken in black bean sauce, Chicken American Chopsuey and Chicken Cantonese rice. Served in good quantity, the food at Beijing restaurant was hot and delicious! The spices, sauces and herbs perfectly blended in each item, emitting a delicious aroma to excite our taste buds! Finally, the waiter arrived with our yummy dessert - a black forest sundae and Choc√≥ brownies. The soft brownies and the ice cream melted in our mouths, leaving a lasting sweetness.  

However, there are some disadvantages in dining at Beijing restaurant. If you plan to dine there, then avoid taking your car. Finding a proper car parking lot nearby is truly hazardous. I did not like the ambience of the restaurant. The dimly lit area looked unclean. But their food was really awesome. Overall, it is a nice place to enjoy authentic Chinese food at pocket-friendly prices.

Though I am not a Chineese Fan but this is one of the place in Kolkata which i like a lot...
Their Golden fried Prawn - OMG is just awesome....

I wonder how a chineese place can make such good mutton spare ribs... Fantastic !

Steamed Chicken for all low Calo lovers - 1 of the best in town...

Mongolian Rice, Special mixed fied rice, Chilli Chicken, Mushroom& Baby Corn Chicken - excellent.

If you come to Tangra & dont know where to eat.. just hit this place !! You will be satisfied completely !! 100 % =)

Personally I just love the place though the location is very weird and parking the car is a big problem. This place has never ever disappointed me till date. The place is quite big and decorated decently. The food is too tasty and mouth watering. Its quantity is very very impressive and is impossible for one person to finish. The prices are so affordable that you always have a smile on your face when the bill arrives. 
The staff is friendly and cheerful.
Only I guess during summers they should take care that the ac is working properly because no one likes perspiring while eating a good and tasty meal. 
So I would rate it 4 too be honest and reasonable.

I am a frequent goer in this restaurant. If anyone in kolkata wants to taste real chinese cuisine, beijing is a good place. The entire ambiance gives you a feel of china. The quality of food is very good. The price is quite suitable for the quality and quantity they serve. I usually take dry schezuan chicken with beer and then go for the main.  This restaurant is equally good for your friends, family and special one.

Traveling from south city to have over priced liquor from Beinjing seems pointless. Pricey drinks. Funny pricing system. Good waiters, friendly. not being sure if the drinks we ordered was actually what was served.*highly suspicious*. Food-wise, it's a good place. Nothing I'd travel twice 2 months for. Maybe once in 2-3 months. Ambiance is about average, though they could do with a make-over!:)

First of all,the advantage of this place is only for its location in a very odd place. Food is lovely and quantity is great. Being a chinese lover i eat also eat huge quantities and this place is having a mediocre ambience. The location is the only thing which prevents me fro going there. Pricing is reasonable and service is up to the mark. I know that BEIJING can improve these conditions, but they don't need of improving food quality,because its just delightful. Its a very nice place for having chinese dishes and suggestion goes to folks for having food here. 3stars  for it and 2 stars i would have given if they improve their service and ambiance.

I remember visiting this place since I was in class V. I love some of the dishes served here like the prawn wafers which are served with a yummy green chutney. Then I love the pepper garlic chicken and the gravy chowmein. The chicken gravy chowmein is cooked with fresh vegetables and non veg items. It tastes yummy. All their starter items are also tasty. The standard and quality has dropped since few years but its a good place for some chinese bites!!!!!

the only place in the whole china town which i prefer to visit. Its plush, It has great ambiance and one can visit with family. and best Chinese food in whole china town. the price is slightly on the higher side but the quantity is huge. once visited with my big joint family of 20 people. Had prebooked a family table over phone. The staff was helpful & polite they arranged for a separate table in the upper floor and when my dad was ordering food then the waiter suggested that how much quantity to order otherwise the food will be wasted, that was a nice gesture.

This will be on the more expensive side. Grandest of all the restaurants in that area and an absolute family favourite.

Situated at the heart of the so called "china town or tangra" in kolkata, Beijing undoubtedly serves some of the finest chinese cuisines in town....Though a bit costly compared to the other restaurants of the nearby lanes in tangra, the taste of the food served here is really exquisite...average cost of the chicken delicacies is around Rs 250 per plate (contains 12 pieces) while that for fish/prawn dishes are a bit higher; around INR 360 for the fish ones and 500 for the prawns....all main dishes contain 12 pieces per plate (unless otherwise stated)...coming to starters, chicken drums of heaven taste good....in a word, BEIJING is a nice place to hang out with family or friends..the waiters are very well dressed, the seating arrangements are also quite spacious...service is very quick!! 
 Final Word: LOVE CHINESE, GO BEIJING!! <3 <3
