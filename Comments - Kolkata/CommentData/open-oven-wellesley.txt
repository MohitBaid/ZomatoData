Not Exactly in Wellesley...
It is in Elliot Road,Tram Line.
Easy to Locate. Food worth the money.
But usually the items stated are not available.

Yes I will give it a four star because of the fewer options for a one pound cake. The dark chocolate is too dark, yes it is. Try the pastries out here, they are amazing. If it gets the support just like the "Mio Amore" then it might dethrone the latter. Yes it can, it just need a revised menu with some more item in it.

Ordered a chicken puff and a vegetable puff from here. The patty was really soft and flaky and the filling was delicious. I also had their truffle pastry which was rich and creamy and they used good quality chocolate in it. The sponge cake lacked the chocolate flavour to some extent , but it tasted good overall. Reasonable and well packaged food.

This particular cake shop is 100 meters from my new home and I had the chance to visit it today. It is located on Elliot Road and Royd Street crossing just along the tram line.

It is a small shop with not much varieties of cakes available. They also have selected pasties in display but it didn't charm me up.

I entered the shop and found none inside. Just after an minute or so, I found a comparatively young guy attending us. Surprisingly enough, he observed us entering the shop but did not give any gesture as if he is the owner or attender. It was only when I kept searching for people, he turned up.

I took two types of cake slices and asked him to pack which was done swiftly.

The cake tasted good but somehow I could not get the satisfaction as expected from the visit.

A not much recommended outlet.

I have had mostly savouries from this place ie. Chicken patties. It tastes really good. This place was our hangout spot after school. Having ice creams and savouries from this place since my childhood. 
The price is moderate and its a good bakery.

This bakery is located in Eliot Road and serving mouth watering and delicious cakes and pastries. I don't know the name of the pastry I have taken but the taste was amazing. You should try there  at least once if you are a pastry lover.

Open oven is a was new name for me till the time I tried my first cake from here. Few months back it was brought on the  occasion of a friend's birthday. It was chocolate cake and exactly cant remember the name but mostly a truffle cake as far as the taste I remember. It was soft and rich in taste also I was pretty impressed by the price they are offering. This is really commendable and I wish to try out them next time as well. They are quite good at their work.Much appreciated!!

I was in the area yesterday evening  n was passing by this place so thought of trying this place.. so i took a slice of chocolate pastry and I must say it was very soft and the chocolate tasted very nice..

As it's almost next to a school it's very good for the students, because it's pocket friendly.

Tasted their chocolate cake at a friend's birthday a few days ago, and really liked it. The sponge and the frosting both were pretty good. Hope to drop by and sample some of their other offerings soon.

#My Experience : A cake fro this outlet was ordered for a friends birthday. Firstly the packaging was nice, my friends had to travel with the cake but it didn't lose consistency. The taste was rich, delicious and frankly quite engulfing. The cream was think and had the right amount of sweetness. The cake was dense. Totally Recommended!! 

Wish the team great luck for the future!

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: Located at the Elliot road just beside the Assembly of God Church School, 2 minutes from my office. This place is not Mio amore or Kathleen but they are just like them with those same options and stuffs for you. Dealing with the pastries, cakes and various patties and pizzas you have some options to choose in your price range.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF: Ambiance is very ordinary and poor. Small place with food items all around you. No sitting arrangement as well, you need to stand and it. When i went in a single lady who was there running the shop. Sitting idle and was polite.

FOOD: I had been passing from this store for over a year but never went in or tried it out. Today was the day to go and try and i ordered Chicken Pizza as well as Chocolate Caramel.

Chicken Pizza was very good. The bread was soft, Filled with good amount of chicken, capsicum, tomato, etc with the cheese crust over. Being heated in the oven it tasted even better. 

Chocolate Caramel was a surprise for me. generally while we bite a cake its hard a bit. When i took my first bite it was all soft from outside and Inside. The upper crust of Chocolate was very tasty. I was feeling like eating a chocolate Dhoklaa.

CP: 8/10

CC: 8/10

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of the stuffs are good, quantity was satisfactory. Prices are fine but Rs.35/- for such a small pizza and cake is not a fair thing.

CONCLUSION: Overall experience was a good one. Thou i found the variety was shorter as displayed on the menu.

NOTE: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Cakes are really prepared very well here and it is made fresh also as if u want it in an hour they will bake it and keep it for you so that's a good thing about this place which will not dissapoint you in those terms , now if you ask me about the look of the shop then I would recommended a few interior deco is needed as it looks as it hasn't been renovated or maintained for sometime so that needs to be checked on otherwise everything else is fine including the care taker and shop owners are cool minded people so they help you with suggestion based on your choice .

My verdict - if you tired of kookie jar and bakeries like them then you need to explore this place .

I did not quite know there existed such a great bakery amidst the crampled and the damped royd street. I was there for an interview and it was nearly the lunch time when the interview got over and I was intending to have something.  But I was unsure of what would be avialable in a desserted place like royd street, when like a genie this place struck my eyes. And I entered this.  The place smelled of fresh food and fresh cream. All the food items looked amazingly fresh. But what drew me real close was the chicken quiche.  it had a cheesy layer above and looked amazing. So I chose it over the chicken wrap. And there it was served hot and fresh. It was bursting with Cheese from all corners and tasted amazing.  A must try.  The next one that I tried was great. The chocolate pearl pastry. Amazingly tempting. Chocolate cream and caramel crumbs embedded. The base of the cake can however be worked upon. But I am definitely going back again.

I had heard decent reviews about the couple of outlets of Open Oven and decided to take away couple of muffins and brownies on my way while passing it by.

This is a small outlet in Royd Street. The store looked neat, clean, tidy but no seating arrangements. There were quite a few items on display. I got couple of  plain , chocolate muffins and walnut brownies packed. The first thing that shocked me were the extremely reasonable pricing with the items costing 12, 15, 30 each.

The plain muffin was very nice moreso considering such prices. It was pretty soft with tasted good. I dint like the chocolate muffin though mainly because of the flavour of chocolate which i felt was of inferior quality. The walnut brownie was pretty good for 30 bucks. The quality of chocolate used dint bother me so much here and i felt the brownie was exactly as it should be instead of some places nowadays who tend to turn it into a pastry. But i also felt it could have been a couple of days old and not so fresh.

Overall it was a mixed experience but would like to try its some of the other offerings !!!
