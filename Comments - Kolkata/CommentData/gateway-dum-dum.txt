This is the most below graded restaurant in this zone.We booked our table for a candle light buffet dinner during the puja days.But as we entered this hotel on the booking date we were shocked to see that lots of people had gathered outside with no vacant space.There arrangements were horrible and the staffs lacked knowledge about how to manage a buffet dinner.We wasted a hefty amount of time as we have to board a cab from a long distance to attend the dinner.

The ambiance was good.. I liked it personally... Especially the candle light dinner idea.. 
The food was yummy... I tasted each and every dish except fish curry... I don't like fish but I ate fish fingers... It was so mouth watering.... Starters were delicious especially fish fingers n paneer 65

Coming to main course.... I liked egg noodles... Chicken Manchurian... Chicken fried rice.... Peas pulao... Dry fry was ok... Scheuzan paneer was again a plus point for me... 
Panner tikka masala and naan was nt good... It could have been more better... 


Last but nt the least all deserts were yummy... I mixed two icecreams n put gulab jamun n ate... It was really yummy... Same I did with gajar halwaüòäüò≥üò∂üòç

This is one hotel plus restaurant situated at Airport 1 no gate crossing. It generally does not serve bufft, but had one special event during Durga Puja. We went on Saptami night. Not going to detail menu, as attaching as image. It costs Rs 399 including tax. Number of items and quality was extremely good according to this price. Specialty was environment. They arranged Candle Light Dinner for couples. It was awesome. Overall very nice experience. Thanks to the restaurant management for arranging this special event.

Faltu restaurant, yesterday we visit for buffet 399 rs, but the food quality was very bad. Chicken is kasa and Manchurian is horrible, chicken 65?? Tasteless, to much spicey, they arrange this buffet at a small place, tables are t-table, so frankly speaking when u are arranging a buffet they why u gyz r not offering big tables?? One thing the golap jamun , ist time I was eat in my life that, it smells bad! Another thing the ice cream, u mentioned straberry and vanilla bouth. But only statbery icecream they providing. But the staffs are good. 
Overall experience bekar
Just screw of 400 ys

This hotel restaurant is situated at airport gate no 1. If you are not having much money, then this is your place, but don't get fooled with the low prices. The food here is very delicious. I have been there for 6-7 times and non of the time I was disappointed. The staffs are decent, the place is small but managed in a very good way. Try their kebabs and biryani. This place never disappoints.

Had a satisfying experience in the restaurant of the hotel gateway. It is right on the joint of vip road and jessore road. Restaurant's interior is well decorated.Their menu is big spreading from bengali to continental. I ordered cream of tomato soup topped with small soaked pieces of fried or toasted bread and fresh white cream . Quantity was average and it tasted awesome. Took another dish named au gratin chicken which was a baked continental item and prepared with chicken broth, grated cheese, flour, frozen peas and carrot and served with tabasco sauce. It was hot and tasted good. Prompt service and behaviour of the staffs were very decent.

We went there on 19th May, and ordered a Fish Thali(Katla). Eating there was a great experience. There were so many items and the piece of fish was very big. The items were spot on and special mention goes to the vegetable curry that came in one of the bowls. 

We recieved a fried side(eggplant or potato fries), roti, rice, daal, vegetable curry, fish curry, gajar ka halwa and curd. If you want a satisfying meal, do try their Thali. It's worth the price you pay.

Situated Opp airport gate no 1 this is a perfect place to spend quality time with your partner. The ambience is good. We ordered a Veg Grilled Cheese Sandwich which was made very quickly. It was perfectly made with proper contents of Cheese, decorated with potato chips. Than we ordered a Chicken Reshmi Kebab which was again awesome. The size of the kebab pieces were huge. The chicken was properly marinated real value for money. Finally we ordered a death on chocolate which was valued at 120 RS a perfect steal. Topped with brownie cake, chocolate sauce and 2 gallops of ice cream. Finally I took a chicken Penne pasta for delivery which was a wrong decision not at all creamy. Olive pieces were not cut,less veggies. Overall it's a good place to hangout from the busy traffic outside.

It was completely horrible. We had ordered two but none of them was drunk completely. But rest of things were good. Hope they will do better in future and will definitely improve their services.

The place is located just at the junction of jessore road and vip road. Its a restaurant and a hotel with the restaurant at the ground floor. We went during the pujas and got a seat rightaway which is not common during pujas. We ordered chilli chicken fried rice schezwan chow and chicken manchurian. The food was good but nothing exceptional. But provided the much needed satisfaction of the stomach. Will come again and try out the other dishes.

I often come here to have it with my girlfriend. It's pretty pocket friendly and ambiance is very cozy. Hope you like to dine here too.

This restuarant is at the junction of vip road and jessore road. The atmosphere and environment is nice... Both chinese indian and continental food is available... I have been there few times. Have tried chinese as well as biriyani.. Biriyani is really nice here.. One can also take away from here.. Waiting time is 10-15 minutes.. Service boys are polite and co operative... Recommended... Higher mid range in terms of quality and cost.

I have been living in kolkata from last 2 years and gateway is the most value for money restaurant near airport. The devor is simple and not classy but the food is very gud as compared to north indian food. The prices are reasonable too..we had starters and 2 vegetables with breads in just over 500. I highly recommend this restaurant.

First thing is, don't go by the ambiance..decor is very simple..nothing classy is there.
But Food was quite good.¬†
We ordered Pan Fried Chili Chicken ( was bit hot, but super tasty), burnt garlic noodles ( taste was good, full of prawn and chicken, but no burnt garlic!!) and Chicken Manchurian ( the gravy was proper, not the chili chicken gravy :) )¬†
In my 2nd visit, I tried mixed gravy noodles and that is absolutely awsome!! Must try

And it won't burn your pocket too!
Overall it's okay for a casual dinner with friends and family.

A total waste of money,i feel visiting this restaurant really was a mistake. The decor,ambience everything is so cheap,and so is the quality and quantity of food. What's remarkable here is the price of the dishes,they charge you so much for such bogus preparations! I hated my first visit and took an oath of not visiting here again!

I have just been there once and I would say I was not disappointed. I won't say the food was something like I have never tasted before and I would like to visit the place again and again but if put in simple words it is good restaurant located near airport. 

The restaurant was neat and clean with very well mannered attendants. The waiter was kind enough to fetch my mom a magazine she pointed at while waiting for the food to arrive. Only thing that bugged me was that waiters were talking very loudly amongst themselves. After hours of pandel hopping we were tired and we didn't want to try dishes we were not accustomed to. So we ordered NAN AND CHICKEN BUTTER MASALA. The food was good and I had no complaints. The pocket pinch was not much. We were surprised when they brought us the bill. They made a mistake and charged us for one plate of chicken butter masala instead of two plates. When we rectified their mistakes they were very grateful.
