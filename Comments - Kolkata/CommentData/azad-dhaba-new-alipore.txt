Food: Had a chicken biryani here. A full plate has one chicken leg, one boiled egg and a piece of boiled potato. The taste was good but didn't stand out. I would say there is value for money considering the price. (3.5/5)
Ambience: This is just like any urban dhaba so not much effort in decor. The place was very clean though which earns it some points. (3/5)
Service: The service was also very standard. They were very prompt and did not delay their service even a little. (4/5)

Overall: I would recommend Azad Dhaba for occasional visits (when you get bored of everyday meals and want a small change ;-P)

Food is good especially the chicken kebabs and rolls. Service is prompt. Cleanliness is up to the mark. Staff is helpful. Ambience is satisfactory. The pricing is reasonable. All in all a value for money place.
