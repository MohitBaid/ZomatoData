Royal sweet, the name itself expresses something better than the best. The place is easy to locate and anyone can easily reach. All sweets are good especially the mawa laddoo and aflatoon halwa and in a very reasonable rate, for those who loves and fond of sweet , this place should visiit!

One of the popular and old sweet shops, located just off 7 point crossing. They mostly specialized in making halwa's and laddoo's. The products usually have a good quantity of ghee and mawa accompanying them. Gajar ka halwa tasted good, but I like the one served at Tiwari's more. Try Aflatoon ka Halwa from this place, if you are around!

This Karaya Road shop is a pleasure for humans with sweet tooth. Royal sweet has grown up the ladder in a snap and retained its leading position since then. The mad rush at the shop speaks about its popularity. This shop had actually made justice to its name. You must savour the royal taste of authentic aflatoon ka halwa, dodhiya mithai and muskat ka halwa. The special Royal Mawa Laddu is the USP. I specially recommend this shop for festival gifts.

This is a take-away shop, so the rating is strictly on the basis of the taste bud experience.

Royal is one of oldest sweet shop in Park circus area. It is mainly famous for its laddoo. The laddoo are made of ghee and mawa. These are very tasty. Apart from laddoo the pista halwa was also good. Its a decent reasonable sweet shop.

Location: Beside Hotel Diamond Heights; In a bylane off 7-point crossing.

Royal Sweets is a pretty famous shop among the localities of the area and in case locating it is a problem, kindly enquire around for directions (I did just the same :P). 
This sweet shop has a very different fare as compared to other sweet shops of Kolkata. It includes Halwas, Mawa items, chikki type items etc.. but, have no Chena items on offer. They have a variety of Halwas on offer including Anjeer, Gajar etc. There preparations are in pure desi ghee.
Tried the Gajar Halwa and Mawa Ladoo.

- The Gajar Halwa had a higher amount of Mawa as compared to grated carrots in it. A complete miss.
- Mawa Ladoo was made of pure Mawa along with a hint of Rose water. Tasted decent.

A reasonably priced place.

Overall was a below average experience. 
- Might just give it a miss. Better options available.
