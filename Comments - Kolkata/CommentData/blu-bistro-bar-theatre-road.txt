Blu is a Bar cum Restaurant in the Aauris Hotel, Theatre Road. The restaurant has a very vibrant and interesting decor with fantastic lighting. Seating arrangements were good with sufficient room for privacy. 

The service was very slow initially but gradually it turned out to be the best part of our dining experience. 

To begin with, we had ordered for Thai Peanut Salad Wanton Cups. The Wanton had a filling of cabbage, carrot and peanut in Thai dressing. Surprisingly we found the dish to be extremely spicy yet tasty. The Wantons also consisted of red chilies, thus making it extremely spicy.  Since we liked the taste of the dish, we could not help ourselves from finishing it but with tears rolling from our eyes.

Then, we placed an order for Veg green curry, Prawn Fried-Rice and Veg Manchurian. 

*The Veg Green Curry was a Thai preparation with vegetables in green sauce, served with steamed rice. The dish was delectable with plenty of assorted vegetables and we enjoyed every bit of it. 

*We had clearly instructed the staff not to add any chicken to the prawn fried-rice as some of us could not have chicken and to prepare the Fried-Rice only with prawn and egg. Yet, we found pieces of chicken in the Fried-Rice that too towards the end of our meal. On complaining, at once, the fried-rice was freshly prepared and another plate of Fried-rice was served to us, and this time perfectly prepared.

*The Veg Manchurian was prepared with too much of soya sauce giving it a bitter taste. It also had a very unpleasant taste because of a thick layer of batter that was on the Vegetable ball. Yet again, the management had taken proper care of our displeasure and got it replaced for Vegetables in Hot Garlic Sauce instantly. This tasted absolutely amazing and we were contented indeed. 

Even though we faced a lot of dissatisfaction, the prompt service was very impressive thus making it a wonderful dining experience. The quality and quantity of the food are good. Shall visit this place again especially for the excellent services rendered here.

Ambiance is okayish. Food is average. Overpriced for what they offer. Ordered a number of dishes but the only thing that I liked was the dessert Mad for Mud. Service is slow.

Last night dinner was a horrible one, after a wonderful experience in the sky bar aauris we came down to blu for our dinner, while ordering our food staff insisted to order paneer makhanwala which we refused by saying it would be sweet and we dont want anything sweet in main course, he insisted again by saying it wont be sweet and he will make sure he makes it spicy and we ordered that and dal makhani with breads. Paneer was tooo sweet to handle, we asked the staff to change it as we wanted a spicy one and we didnn@t know more horrible is yet to arrive at our table. Paneer which was so called changed was only added with loads of chilli powder and that too not cooked properly as we got a taste of raw chilli powder. Dal was good but came of no use and evening well started at aauris black sky bar changed to be the horrible friends bday night

Chic Blue Decor with high rise chairs and funky music, makes this place a vibrant tavern. Its combination of both conventional and contemporary set up, makes it a happy family and a casual chit chat peer place. Being a regular to the #Blackskybar, we decided to take a try with Blu. It was a friends date and we ordered Cashew Chicken Lettuce Wrap, Hummus Flatbread with Sundried Tomatoes,Dynamite shrimps,  Pizza De Manaqish. The Cashew Chicken Lettuce Wrap was Delicious, easy and bursting with flavor. it was a perfect concoction of chicken stock, soy sauce, ginger, hoisin sauce, vinegar, and cornstarch. Hummus Flatbread with Sundried Tomatoes had a fun twisted flavor. The tangy of tomato and the hummus recipe created a warm depth to the flavor. shrimps were as usual good and the pizza was impeccably adorable. We were then introduced to their amazing liquor offer wherein the price of pegs falls based on the no of total pegs ordered. So people in large group looking forward to a good drinking session, do not miss this place as they are happily serving 12 pegs Chivas @ 4200. Folks, one should not miss this Slurrrrpy deal at Blu Bistro & Bar. Stop Feeling Blue and just be in Blu.

This another new gem at the heart of the city with a concept of wholesale bar market where the more you order the lesser u pay. The food menu is good and it tastes good as well. Try the humus flat bread and Pizza De Calabria... The dessert platter is also good. Prices are reasonable for liquor if you order in bulk. Makes sense..

A new place with a new concept. BLU-BISTRO&BAR runs on a wholesale market concept where you pay less of you order for more at once. The food menu has a lot of variety and whatever I had was very good. The this crust pizza is crisp and delicious. The LIIT was yum with a lot of zing as it should be. A great new place over all.

BLU has been reincarnated as a Bistro Bar with a super new concept. It's a chic new place with great interiors and lively music. The food is to die for. I tried the cashew chicken lettuce wrap and the hummus flat bread. Both were top notch. The pizza de Calabria was nice and crisp but the real winner is the new bar menu which is designed in such a way that a group of friends can order in bulk at once and save a lot of money.. Over all its a fabulous new place... Must go.
